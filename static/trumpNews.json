The move marks a shift away from arms long supplied by Israel, with which Colombia cut ties last year. President Gustavo Petro, a former leftist guerrilla fighter who took office in 2022, announced in 2023 that Colombia was breaking relations with Israel, accusing it of committing genocide in Gaza. Since the start of the war in Gaza, Petro has compared Israeli military actions to Nazi crimes and the Holocaust, and he has pledged to join South Africa’s case against Israel at the International Court of Justice. The new rifle is being manufactured by the state-owned arms company Indumil, which has been tasked with producing 400,000 weapons over five years to gradually replace existing stock. Colombia’s military has relied on Israeli-made Galil rifles since the 1990s, assembled locally from Israeli-supplied parts. The Galil, developed by Israel Military Industries in the 1970s from the Finnish RK 62, itself based on the AK-47, served for decades as a standard-issue rifle for Israeli forces and police. Indumil says the new weapon is 15% to 20% lighter than the Galil. But defense experts question whether Colombia can meet full-scale production goals without significant costs. Petro has widened his stance against international arms purchases. In addition to halting contracts with Israel, he recently froze weapons deals with the United States after former President Donald Trump removed Colombia from Washington’s list of allies in the war on drugs. Petro has used increasingly harsh rhetoric toward Israel, at one point writing that “the killing of 5,300 Palestinian boys and girls is Nazism” and declaring, “They say Israelis are not Nazis, but they are.” During last month’s United Nations General Assembly in New York, Petro joined a pro-Palestinian demonstration, where he called for the creation of a “large army to liberate Palestine” stronger than the U.S. military. He also urged American soldiers to refuse orders, prompting the U.S. to revoke his visa.","summary":"President Gustavo Petro, a former leftist guerrilla fighter who took office in 2022, announced in 2023 that Colombia was breaking relations with Israel, accusing it of committing genocide in Gaza","url":"https://www.ynetnews.com/article/byvxrg9nel","image":"https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/09/30/rkZOU1ht3ge/rkZOU1ht3ge_0_0_3000_1983_0_large.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-10-01 01:08:44","author":"Ynet, Afp","authors":["Ynet, Afp"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"il","sentiment":0.051},{"id":365011732,"title":"Politico reporter under fire after social media posts attacking Trump, MAGA voters resurface","text":"A reporter for Politico is facing criticism for several social media posts attacking President Donald Trump as well as his voters have resurfaced while she is covering his presidency. Cheyanne Daniels began working for Politico in May as a breaking news reporter after her three-year stint as the race and politics reporter for The Hill, according to her LinkedIn profile and her Politico staff page. A report published Tuesday by The Washington Free Beacon has put a spotlight on her hyper-partisan social media activity going back to 2016. The posts were made while she was in journalism school between 2016-2021. \"Trump — oh you don't deserve the truth people have thrown at you? Well I don't deserve a racist, homophobic, sexist, misogynistic president\" Daniels wrote in September 2016, according to screenshots published by the Free Beacon. TA-NEHISI COATES CALLS CHARLIE KIRK A ‘HATEMONGER' WHO SHOULDN'T BE CELEBRATED In 2020, she admitted that she cried in reaction to Trump's first victory while rejoicing Joe Biden's victory. \"4 years ago, I cried when I realized Donald Trump had been elected, knowing horrible things were to come. Now, I'm in my apartment in D.C., hearing people cheering in the streets screaming that he has been defeated, and I'm crying once again. But for a very different reason,\" Daniels wrote on Nov. 7, 2020. Days later, Daniels took aim at Trump voters. \"Trump may have lost the election but over 70 million people voted for him — and some of those voters were people who felt, like their demagogue, that MY life as a Black woman doesn't matter, that I shouldn't exist, I threatened the purity of white power,\" Daniels said. HILLARY CLINTON RIPS WHITE MEN OF 'A CERTAIN RELIGION,’ SPARKS BACKLASH FROM CONSERVATIVES She also had fun over the news that Trump's official government social media accounts would be handed over to the forthcoming Biden administration on Inauguration Day 2021 while taking a swipe at Trump voters. \"This shouldn't be news. Trump lost. Biden won. What's that thing Magatts said in 2016?? Oh that's right 'He'S yOuR pReSiDeNt GeT oVeR iT,'\" Daniels exclaimed. EDITORIAL OVERHAUL: WASHINGTON POST'S NEW OPINION CHIEF FEELS THE WEIGHT OF THE CHALLENGES AHEAD As outlined by The Free Beacon, Daniels has been covering major stories in recent days like the White House's response to the looming government shutdown and the administration's efforts to end the Russia-Ukraine war. The Free Beacon also wrote that Daniels locked her X account after the outlet asked her about her posts. Neither Daniels nor Politico responded to Fox News Digital's requests for comment.

Officials say recent incidents show familiar warning signs: assailants operating without organizational backing, funding or foreign direction, using knives, improvised firearms or cars close to their homes. The emerging pattern recalls the “individual attacker” violence that erupted in September 2015 and left 27 people dead and more than 200 wounded before eventually being suppressed in late 2016. Defense leaders insist the situation today is more stable than it was a decade ago, pointing to ongoing Israeli military operations across the West Bank and tighter coordination between the army, police and the Shin Bet internal security agency. But they warn that the sequence of recent attacks — four major incidents in less than a month — underscores how quickly events can escalate. A chain of attacks The streak began earlier this month with a shooting in Jerusalem’s Ramot neighborhood, where two gunmen from the nearby villages of Qatana and Qubeiba opened fire with improvised weapons, killing six Israelis. Ten days later at the Allenby Bridge crossing to Jordan, a Jordanian aid-truck driver armed with a pistol shot and killed two Israeli soldiers at close range. Another 10 days later, a Palestinian from Nablus attempted a car-ramming attack at the Git Junction, accelerating his vehicle toward an army patrol. One soldier tried to stop him, while another opened fire and accidentally killed his comrade. On Sunday, a Palestinian from the village of Beit Fajjar, south of Bethlehem, rammed his vehicle into two teenagers near the al-Khader junction south of Jerusalem, wounding both. In each case, the attackers acted independently, without handlers or a command structure, security officials said. Echoes of the past The 2015–2016 wave of lone wolf violence was fueled by religious tensions over the Temple Mount, known to Muslims as the Noble Sanctuary, home to the al-Aqsa Mosque. Riots and clashes spilled into widespread violence, with young Palestinians inspired by social media or incitement carrying out dozens of spontaneous attacks. Back then, Israeli forces took months to adapt. Once they did, they expanded raids in villages, cracked down on incitement, made thousands of arrests and introduced deterrence measures such as demolishing attackers’ homes. The combination, along with reduced tensions in Jerusalem, eventually quieted the violence. “This is not yet a wave like we saw 10 years ago,” a senior officer said. “But it is a dangerous sequence of attacks, and the concern of escalation is very real.” Military presence and countermeasures In the past year, Central Command under Maj. Gen. Avi Blot has launched broad campaigns across northern West Bank refugee camps such as Jenin, Nur Shams and Tulkarm. The army has demolished dozens of structures, widened roads and stationed troops inside camps for extended periods — a physical presence officials say boosts deterrence and limits terrorists’ freedom of movement. The Shin Bet has also foiled dozens of plots, including a cell accused of planning to assassinate National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir, another that produced rockets near Ramallah, and networks preparing explosives and car bombs. Meanwhile, the West Bank police district under Cmdr. Moshe Pinchi has prioritized weapons seizures, arguing that firearms in criminal hands can easily reach terrorists. Officials have also accelerated punitive demolitions. Within days of the Ramot shooting, the homes of the two gunmen were sealed, and one was destroyed within weeks — a shorter timetable than in the past that commanders say increases deterrence. A volatile season Beyond the attacks themselves, the security climate is affected by broader factors. The Jewish holiday season and the Palestinian olive harvest, which often sparks friction between settlers and farmers, are beginning. Images of destruction from the war in Gaza are also fueling anger in Palestinian communities. Political uncertainty adds to the tension. Discussions in Israel about possible annexation of West Bank territory, as well as U.S. diplomatic maneuvers under President Donald Trump’s administration, remain a backdrop to the unrest. Preventing escalation Senior officers liken the current situation to coffee boiling in a pot — manageable if carefully watched, but quick to spill over if neglected. They stress that while the recent surge does not yet amount to a full wave of terrorism, the risk of escalation is serious. For Israel’s defense establishment, the challenge is to stop the chain of attacks before it hardens into a pattern — and to do so before the country marks a grim anniversary of the lone wolf violence that claimed so many lives a decade ago.","summary":"A decade after a wave of deadly lone wolf attacks, Israeli security officials are warning of a troubling resurgence; recent shootings and car-rammings in Jerusalem and the West Bank have raised fears of escalation despite new military crackdowns","url":"https://www.ynetnews.com/article/bjugog9nex","image":"https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/09/11/HJi5gFljgg/HJi5gFljgg_0_0_3000_2001_0_large.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-10-01 00:58:30","author":"Elisha Ben Kimon","authors":["Elisha Ben Kimon"],"language":"en","source_country":"il","sentiment":-0.134},{"id":365010062,"title":"Special Report w/ Bret Baier - Tuesday, September 30","text":"to top close Video This video is playing in picture-in-picture.\n\n Your Preview Pass expires in 00:00 Don't have a TV subscription?\n\nFull Episode September 30, 2025 41:15 \n FULL EPISODE\n\n EXP 7 DAYS\n Special Report w/ Bret Baier - Tuesday, September 30 \n Donald Trump, Israel, White House\n Tags MOST RECENT EPISODES | VIDEOSSPECIAL REPORT | FULL EPISODES","summary":"Donald Trump, Israel, White House","url":"https://www.foxnews.com/video/6380460030112","image":"https://a57.foxnews.com/cf-images.us-east-1.prod.boltdns.net/v1/static/990505083001/5680bdfc-b79c-44e6-a39c-1fdaa7cdde9c/e3bfe142-af52-4d28-acb8-edc2bb80ffc4/1280x720/match/1024/512/image.jpg?pubId=694940094001?ve=1&tl=1","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-10-01 00:57:56","author":null,"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.076},{"id":365013980,"title":"Kamala Harris’ candid memoir reveals her ‘ideal’ vice president – and why she thinks she lost","text":"It is downright eerie to read, right now, Kamala Harris’ memoir of her 2024 presidential campaign. These events feel so far away now, when we read them from within the frequent shocks of the Trump presidency, from troops on the streets of Washington to the indictment of former FBI director James Comey. But the chapter titles – beginning “July 21. 107 Days to the Election” – remind us the election was just last year. \n\n“It says a lot about how traumatised we both were by what happened that night that Doug and I never discussed it with each other until I sat down to write this book,” Harris reflects about election night: her campaign at an end and Trump triumphant.\n\nThe book is not the whole story – not by a long shot. But her words about these events resonate with a ring of truth.\n\nBook review: 107 Days – Kamala Harris (Simon & Schuster)\n\nThe first chapter, Sunday July 21, covers the day Joe Biden – who disintegrated before our eyes in his catastrophic debate with Trump – withdrew from the race, with no road to victory. \n\nHe did want to endorse Harris, but “not for a day, maybe two”. She told him that would be “ruinous”. She argued that she was not just “the candidate in the strongest position to win”, but “the only person” who would preserve Biden’s legacy. “At this point, anyone else was bound to throw him – and all the good he had achieved – under the bus.”\n\nShe draws on her call notes to supply the reactions of various senior Democrats to the news that day, from Bill Clinton (“Oh my god, I’m so relieved!”) to Gavin Newsom:\n\nHiking. Will call back. (He never did.)\n\nThroughout, Harris is relentlessly sharp in recollecting the campaign – and very candid on all the principals, including the love of her husband, Doug Emhoff. \n\nIt takes courage to write about such an agonising, devastating defeat – after an historic, exhilarating campaign – so quickly and so personally. Memoirs are rarely written this quickly. (We are still waiting, five years later, for the second volume of Barack Obama’s memoirs.)\n\nIn writing this book, she got by with a little help from a “special friend”: Pulitzer prize winning Australian author Geraldine Brooks. Harris’ acknowledgements note her deep appreciation of working with Brooks, whose “ferocious and brilliant artistic insights were indispensable.” \n\nThe book fully reflects that. And who knows? Brooks one day might collaborate with Kamala on an inaugural address.\n\nCandid, but loyal about Biden\n\nHarris is candid about Biden’s decline, but still essentially loyal. \n\n“On his worst day, he was more deeply knowledgeable, more capable of exercising judgment, and far more compassionate than Donald Trump at his best,” she writes. “There was a distinction between his ability to campaign and his ability to govern.”\n\nBob Woodward, the dean of presidential journalists, reached the same conclusion in his last book, War.\n\nHarris writes:\n\nof all the people in the White House, I was in the worst position to make the case that he should drop out. I knew it would come off to him as incredibly self-serving if I advised him not to run. He would see it as naked ambition.\n\nThe choice, she says, should not “have been left to an individual’s ego, an individual’s ambition. It should have been more than a personal decision.”\n\nIn other words, this was a decision his family and associates did not want to make. But it was imperative the national interest be placed above Biden’s personal interest.\n\nThe Harris campaign kept the core of Team Biden. “I didn’t have time to build a new plane; I had to fly the aircraft available.”\n\nOne of Biden’s closest advisors, Mike Donilon (criticised in Jake Tapper and Alex Thompson’s recent Biden book, Original Sin) left Harris’ campaign two weeks in. \n\nShe describes him, during Biden’s 2024 campaign, filtering poll data and presenting “the numbers in soothing terms […] really there was nothing to see here”. At these briefings (which “made no sense to me”), she writes, “Doug had wanted to stop sitting next to me because he got tired of me kicking him under the table when I asked a question and got a nonanswer.”\n\nPete Buttigieg ‘too big of a risk’ as VP\n\nHarris delivers the goods on her vice-presidential search. She admits Pete Buttigieg (a personal friend) was her first choice and the “ideal partner” – but the then transportation secretary, with his husband and children, was “too big of a risk” for “a Black woman married to a Jewish man”.\n\nJosh Shapiro, governor of Pennsylvania, came across to her as wanting a co-presidency. “At one point, he mused that he would want to be in the room for every decision […] I had a nagging concern that he would be unable to settle for a role as number two.”\n\nShe viewed senator and retired astronaut Mark Kelly of Arizona very favourably, but was afraid the Trump attack machine would try to take him down on his (excellent) military service record – just like the Republicans did to John Kerry in 2004. The man who led that effort, Chris LaCivita, was now a top Trump campaign aide.\n\nCould a captain, used to deference and respect, adapt to an opponent’s national campaign specifically designed to disrespect him, to cut a hero down to something small?\n\nOf course, the military service slander she feared with Kelly was employed against her eventual choice. Minnesota governor Tim Walz, who served in the National Guard for 24 years, was accused by vice president JD Vance of “stolen valor” for his misstatement, while arguing for an assault weapons ban, that “these weapons of war that I carried in war” had no place on civilian streets, though he didn’t serve in combat.\n\nHarris found the chemistry she wanted with the “genuinely self-deprecating” Walz: an all-American decent guy next door, with great values and common sense. “He had no fixed ideas about what the role of vice president would be, saying he would do whatever I found was most useful for him to do.”\n\nShe writes that her senior staff favoured Walz, “to a person”, as did her sister – while husband Doug Emhoff, interestingly, leaned towards Shapiro.\n\nWe will never know if Shapiro or Kelly would have carried their swing states, perhaps changing the outcome of the election.\n\n‘Don’t ever let them make you cry’\n\nTrump’s outrages on the campaign trail were rife. Harris takes us behind the scenes to reveal her reactions to key moments, like Trump’s infamous statement to the National Association with Black Journalists: “I didn’t know she was Black until a number of years ago when she happened to turn Black and now she wants to be known as Black.” (Her mother is Indian; her father Jamaican.) \n\nTo campaign aide Brian Fallon, who wanted her to “punch back with a big speech about my racial identity”, she retorted:\n\nToday he wants me to prove my race. What next? He’ll say I’m not a woman and I’ll need to show my vagina?\n\nHarris takes us into her July 25 meeting with Israel’s Benjamin Netanyahu during her campaign. She also tells us she believes Israel was right to respond to “the atrocities of October 7”, but criticises the “ferocity” of Netanyahu’s response, including “the number of innocent Palestinian women and children killed and his failure to prioritize the lives of the hostages”. She was tough. \n\n“I interrupted to reiterate the need for an immediate ceasefire and a day-after plan that gave Palestinians some kind of political horizon.” Netanyahu did not like what he was hearing – especially from her. “He wanted Trump in the seat opposite him. Not Joe. Not me.”\n\nHarris does acknowledge Biden gaffes, like when he put on the MAGA hat of a Trump supporter he was joking with, who offered it to him. Her internal monologue went: “Don’t take it […] Don’t put it on.” Then: “He put it on.” That photo carried the caption, “Biden endorses Trump over Harris.” A bad day on a trail that had only 107 days. \n\nWhen Harris talks about being a woman in politics, she sounds a lot like Julia Gillard. \n\n“As any woman in a public-facing job knows, it takes us longer,” she writes about the two hours she needed to get ready on the campaign trail – make-up, hairstyling, “more complicated apparel choices”. Women are still judged on these seeming trivialities, she writes, over “the consequential matters we’re engaged in”.\n\nShe relates a conversation with German chancellor Angela Merkel. “They used to call me this – this ugly bird. And at first it hurt me deeply.” Angela leant towards Kamala. “Don’t ever let them make you cry.”\n\nHarris never does.\n\n‘I know Donald Trump’s type’\n\nHarris’ speeches hit Trump where it hurts. As California’s attorney general, she told crowds:\n\nI took on predators of all kinds […] Predators who abused women, who ripped off consumers, cheaters who broke the rules for their own game. So hear me when I say […] I know Donald Trump’s type.\n\nThe crowds “exploded” at this line, she writes. \n\nThere are phrases in English that do a lot of work for you. “I know his type” is one of them. We’ve all said it about someone of low character whom we’ve personally known.\n\nShe had big rallies. And big money. She was fully competitive.\n\nHarris told America what Day One of President Kamala Harris would look like. “When elected, I will walk in with a to-do list full of priorities on what I will get done for the American people.”\n\nBy contrast: “On day one, if elected, Donald Trump would walk into that office with an enemies list.” Does anyone following American politics today doubt that?\n\nBy her own account, the wisest advisor in her campaign was David Plouffe, who ran Barack Obama’s successful 2008 campaign. But like a Shakespearean ghost, Plouffe’s warnings haunt this play. He counselled her Trump was doing better than in 2016 and 2020, and the assassination attempt had pushed his turnout up 20%. “Whatever you think his turnout will be, add ten per cent.” \n\nHer campaign strategists were not happy about Harris’ continued praise for Biden in her speeches, urging her to stop. Plouffe put it bluntly: “People hate Joe Biden.” Harris quotes those words twice.\n\nWhy does she believe she lost?\n\nThis is her verdict: “One hundred and seven days were not, in the end, long enough to accomplish the task of winning the presidency.”\n\nTrump got three million more votes in 2024 than he did in 2020. Harris got six million fewer votes than she and Biden did in 2020.\n\nAll that Harris was proud of – the landmark legislation on infrastructure, health care and clean energy – would not deliver their full benefits before the election. In the run up to November, she writes, inflation and interest rates were high, and there was no immediate relief.\n\nHarris wanted to talk directly to Trump supporters, but it never happened. She wrote:\n\nI wished I could ask every one of them. What are you angry about? What about me makes you angry? Is it your health care, your grocery bills, a backbreaking job that doesn’t pay what you’re worth – and what can I do to help you?\n\nShe did not reach them.\n\nShe combated Trump’s strength on immigration and border issues, and the issue of Gen Z facing a future without good prospects. An anti-trans campaign ripped across the country: “Kamala is for they/them. President Trump is for you.” It was reported more than US$21 million was spent by Trump and Republicans on anti-trans and anti-LGBTQ television ads as of October 9 2024.\n\nHarris peaked in mid-September. She never had a lead clear of the polls’ margin of error. \n\nOn election day, she believed she would win.","summary":"In her campaign memoir, Kamala Harris reveals her true thoughts on Joe Biden, takes us behind the scenes of her presidential candidacy and dishes the occasional dirt.","url":"https://theconversation.com/kamala-harris-candid-memoir-reveals-her-ideal-vice-president-and-why-she-thinks-she-lost-266047","image":"https://images.theconversation.com/files/693559/original/file-20250930-56-jz4e2v.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&rect=0%2C49%2C3999%2C1999&q=45&auto=format&w=1356&h=668&fit=crop","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-10-01 00:48:32","author":"Bruce Wolpe,Non-resident Senior Fellow,United States Study Centre,University of Sydney","authors":["Bruce Wolpe","Non-resident Senior Fellow","United States Study Centre","University of Sydney"],"language":"en","source_country":"au","sentiment":-0.114},{"id":365011380,"title":"Donald Trump warns US military officials of 'invasion' within country","text":"Virginia [US], October 1 (ANI): US President Donald Trump on Tuesday (local time) warned of an “invasion” within the country, which is not different from a “foreign enemy”. He said that it is difficult to trace such enemies as they do not wear uniforms, CNN reported. Trump was addressing a gathering of top US military officials at the Marine Corps Base Quantico in Virginia.“We’re under invasion from within. No different than a foreign enemy, but more difficult in many ways because they don’t wear uniforms,” Trump said, as per CNN.President Trump stated that he suggested that Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth use some of the dangerous US cities for military training.“In our inner cities, which we’re going to be talking about because it’s a big part of war now. It’s a big part of war. I told Pete that we should use some of these dangerous cities as training grounds for our military, National Guard, but military. Because we’re going into Chicago very soon,” he said, as quoted by CNN.The US President further considered San Francisco, Chicago, New York, and Los Angeles as “unsafe” places, stating that his administration would address them one by one. “San Francisco, Chicago, New York, Los Angeles.

The Wall Street Journal reported this week that Israel helped shape the plan and pressed for amendments included in the final draft. The newspaper noted that the proposal stops short of endorsing a two-state solution, instead referring to “the aspiration of the Palestinian people” for self-determination. Arab officials told the paper that the absence of a clear path to Palestinian statehood could make Saudi Arabia and other states reluctant to finance the deal. At his weekly Cabinet meeting, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said the plan used “complex wording” on the question of a Palestinian state. “The Palestinian Authority is off the table,” he said. “Even to the Peace Council, no representatives are being appointed from it. The conditions are many and stringent, and Israel and the U.S. will decide whether the PA meets them.” U.S. officials have insisted that if Hamas rejects the plan, Washington, Israel and international partners would move forward in areas of Gaza already outside Hamas’ control. Arab participants in discussions included officials from Qatar, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates. Hostages at the center The plan requires all Israeli hostages, alive and dead, to be returned within 72 hours of Israel’s public acceptance. In exchange, Israel would release 250 Palestinians serving life sentences and 1,700 Gazans arrested after Hamas’ Oct. 7, 2023, assault, including all women and minors. For each deceased Israeli hostage returned, Israel would transfer the remains of 15 Gazans. Hamas may find that demand difficult to meet. The group has claimed that it does not know the location of all the hostages, saying some were lost during Israeli bombardments. Analysts believe the group could ask to release captives in phases, rather than all at once. Israeli officials stressed that political approval of the deal will only begin after Hamas agrees. If that happens, an Israeli delegation would travel to Doha for detailed talks. As in previous ceasefire attempts, both sides would have to negotiate complicated security issues, including withdrawal lines for the Israel Defense Forces, intelligence activity and deployment of forces. Netanyahu is expected to win Cabinet approval for any deal, though not without opposition from far-right ministers. Arab pressure and mediation Arab officials told the Journal that while the plan calls for an immediate release of hostages, Hamas could resist due to operational difficulties. They also stressed that without a pathway to Palestinian statehood, Saudi Arabia is unlikely to back the initiative. At the same time, officials from Qatar, Egypt and Turkey reportedly met with Hamas negotiators to discuss the plan. Al-Jazeera reported that Hamas “confirmed it will responsibly study the American ceasefire proposal” and issue an official response after consultations with other Palestinian factions. Sources in Qatar, Egypt and Turkey delivered a stark warning to Hamas leadership: the deal is the last chance to end the war before Gaza’s situation collapses further. According to the reports, they told the group they will not be able to continue providing political, economic or diplomatic backing if it rejects the ceasefire terms. “This is a decisive moment,” they said. “Any delay or evasion will sever ties and deepen Hamas’ international isolation.” Trump’s role and the Peace Council President Trump announced that he will personally head a new “Peace Council” tasked with overseeing Gaza’s transition. Former British Prime Minister Tony Blair is among those expected to serve alongside Arab and international representatives. The plan calls for a temporary international stabilization force, known as the ISF, to enter Gaza immediately. The ISF would be tasked with training vetted Palestinian police forces, coordinating with Israel and Egypt to secure the borders and prevent arms smuggling, and ensuring the safe flow of goods. So far, no country has formally agreed to contribute soldiers, but estimates suggest that thousands could be drawn from the United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia and Azerbaijan. A senior Israeli official said the plan is not open to renegotiation. “The plan presented by President Trump is a ‘yes or no’ proposition,” the official said. The White House, however, has indicated it may allow minimal adjustments, but no drawn-out process. Hamas response Diplomatic officials expect Hamas will not outright reject the plan but instead answer with conditions. The group has already signaled it may not be able to release all hostages within 72 hours and could seek a phased timetable. Qatar’s prime minister and foreign minister, Mohammed al-Thani, said in an interview with Al-Jazeera that Hamas had received the plan and that discussions were “general.” He added, “We hope everyone will view the proposal constructively and seize the opportunity to end the war.” Al-Thani said the plan “achieves the main goal of ending the war,” but acknowledged that “there are issues requiring clarification and negotiation.” He pointed specifically to the question of IDF withdrawal. “Arab and Islamic countries have made every effort to keep Palestinians on their land and achieve a two-state solution,” he said. Prisoners and internal politics One of the most contentious issues is Israel’s release of Palestinian prisoners. Israel has said it will not free symbolic figures such as Marwan Barghouti. Still, with about 280 Palestinians serving life sentences in Israeli prisons, officials fear that nearly all could end up being freed. Netanyahu will need Cabinet approval for the agreement, where he is expected to secure a majority. But far-right factions are expected to strongly oppose large-scale prisoner releases. Israel’s freedom of action in Gaza Another unresolved issue is the scope of Israel’s security freedom in Gaza once the ISF takes over. Under the plan, Israel is not to occupy or annex the territory. Instead, the IDF would gradually withdraw according to milestones agreed with the international force, Arab states and the U.S. A perimeter security presence could remain until Israel is satisfied the terror threat has been eliminated. The 20-point plan The Trump administration issued a 20-point outline to accompany the proposal. Among its main points: Gaza would become a demilitarized, terror-free zone international aid would pour in for reconstruction a technocratic Palestinian committee would manage day-to-day services under international supervision until the Palestinian Authority completes reforms and regional partners would guarantee compliance. The plan envisions eventual Palestinian self-determination, though without committing to immediate statehood. “As Gaza development advances and the Palestinian Authority reforms, conditions will emerge for a credible path toward Palestinian statehood,” the outline states. President Trump has said Israel has already accepted the plan and that “the ball is now in Hamas’ court.” But with questions still hanging over hostages, international troops, Palestinian governance and Israel’s freedom of action, it remains unclear whether the proposal can take hold.","summary":"Absence of a clear path to Palestinian statehood could make Saudi Arabia and other states reluctant to finance the deal, Arab officials told the Wall Street Journal","url":"https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hkojrg9nex","image":"https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/07/19/SyOOodt8el/SyOOodt8el_0_0_850_479_0_large.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-10-01 00:39:00","author":"Itamar Eichner, Lior Ben Ari","authors":["Itamar Eichner, Lior Ben Ari"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"il","sentiment":-0.06},{"id":365013000,"title":"Trump Reportedly Withdraws Nomination Of Conservative Economist For Labor Stats Chief","text":"The White House reportedly pulled economist E.J. Antoni’s nomination to lead the Bureau of Labor Statistics on Tuesday, according to multiple reports.\n\nPresident Donald Trump said in August that he was nominating economist Antoni to lead the Bureau of Labor Statistics after firing Commissioner Erika McEntarfer over a weak July jobs report. The Trump administration’s nomination of Antoni drew criticism over what Axios called a potential politicization of the Bureau of Labor Statistics. CNN and the Associated Press first reported his withdrawal.\n\nAlmost immediately after his nomination, Antoni stirred controversy by suggesting the agency suspend publication of its jobs report until internal issues were resolved. Antoni, the Heritage Foundation’s top economist, has previously questioned the credibility of the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), saying its monthly jobs reports often resemble “random outputs” in a post on X.\n\nJuly’s modest job gains came after the BLS revised down employment figures for May and June by a total of 258,000 positions, according to a statement from the White House. That same release said that the agency adjusted its estimate for payroll growth between March 2023 and March 2024 downward by 818,000 jobs — marking the second-largest annual revision in its records.\n\n“A lengthy history of inaccuracies and incompetence by Erika McEntarfer, the former Biden-appointed Commissioner of the Bureau of Labor Statistics, has completely eroded public trust in the government agency charged with disseminating key data used by policymakers and businesses to make consequential decisions,” the White House press release said.\n\nThe White House did not immediately respond to the Daily Caller News Foundation’s request for comment.\n\nAll content created by the Daily Caller News Foundation, an independent and nonpartisan newswire service, is available without charge to any legitimate news publisher that can provide a large audience.

Finebuam discussed how the assassination of Charlie Kirk impacted him deeply and personally. And that led to one of the biggest revelations from the interview, with Finebaum telling Travis that he has considered leaving ESPN to run for US Senate as a Republican. An incredibly honest and courageous admission to make at far-left ESPN. RELATED: EXCLUSIVE: Paul Finebaum 'Considering' Leaving ESPN To Pursue U.S. Senate Seat As A Republican But Finebaum also spoke more about how ESPN has been inconsistent in how it handles politics, depending on which prominent figure is involved. In one part of their discussion, Finebaum said he had an opportunity to interview President Donald Trump in Washington DC ahead of Trump attending a game between the Alabama Crimson Tide and the LSU Tigers during his first term. \"What do you think would happen if you told ESPN that you were going to have President Trump on your radio show?\" Travis asked. \"I almost did that once,\" FInebaum said. Travis asked what happened, and Finebaum admitted that ESPN \"killed it,\" preventing him from what would have been a gigantic opportunity. Finebaum said he reached out to a friend in DC, who said he might be able to get him an interview with Trump as part of the promotion around the Bama-LSU game. His friend said it was \"looking good\" to get Trump on Finebaum's show. Then they stopped it from happening. \"I called my boss,\" Finebaum said. \"And they killed it.\" Travis asked him, \"What's the reaction when you think you're going to interview the president, and they say, ‘nope, not happening?'\" \"I was devastated,\" he responded. \"They told me that we are not allowed to mix politics and sports.\" But of course, there's a near certainty that would not have been the response for a politician with a different ideology. \"What do you think they would have said if it were Barack Obama and you had the opportunity,\" Travis asked. \"Well, I think the answer is pretty evident,\" Finebaum said. \"Andy Katz went to the White House every year [for the bracket]. It was a turning point for me. It really wasn't about politics at all, it was the idea of going to the White House to interview the president. And it wasn't about politics, it was about a football game, the biggest game of the year in college football.\" A game that Trump was going to attend as well. \"I never exactly knew where the kill button came from, but it didn't happen.\" Only at ESPN would it be perfectly acceptable to do fun videos with Barack Obama with March Madness brackets every year, then shut down Finebaum from having Donald Trump on the radio to talk college football. Finebaum Says His Mom Wasn't Happy With Republican Vote Finebaum also said others in his personal life weren't happy with the fact that he supported Donald Trump in the 2024 election, including even his own mother. \"What do you think the reaction is going to be in the larger college universe, so to speak, of Senator Finebaum, or the possibility of Senator Finebaum,\" Travis asked. \"Because I think to your point, and I'm going to give you credit for this, you have been a Republicans buy sneakers too guy, a Democrats buy sneakers too guy, a Michael Jordan-era, ‘Hey I want to try to talk to everybody that likes college sports.’ Obviously, to get elected, you have to pick a side, what do you think the reaction to this process will be like for you?\" \"Clay, there might be some surprise. Because I don't think anybody knows what I am. I grew up the son of two liberal New York Jews. My sister was born in New York. Not long before my mother died in 1994, I called her on election day…I told her I voted for the Republican, and my mother, who I love dearly, maybe the most important person in my life, because my Dad died when I was 15, she hung up the phone.\" \"I had one of my best friends, who I grew up I told a number of years ago I was going to be on Fox News…He said, ‘I’ll refuse to watch it.' So I grew up around a lot of this. \"My mother hanging up on me, still stings, and she might hang up…but that's ok.\" Finebaum also said he's not running away from anything, saying that Trump had been a Democrat, and that it's possible to move past the views you have as a younger person. His wife, he added, is a Republican and comes from a Republican family. This is much more representative of the average American family situation than the Mina Kimes, Jemele Hill type personalities that have so frequently operated with impunity around politics. And it's humanizing to hear Finebaum's story.

Russia is assuming the rotating presidency of the United Nations Security Council for the month of October.\n\nNotably, October 24 will mark 80 years since the founding of the United Nations as the global body officially came into existence on that day in 1945, after the Soviet Union had submitted its ratification of the UN Charter, ensuring the necessary number of ratifications.\n\nRussian Permanent Representative to the UN Vasily Nebenzya will present the Security Council's monthly agenda at a press conference at the organization's headquarters.\n\nIn a month, the UN Security Council usually holds about 20 meetings on various issues. The UN security body reached a historical milestone in September, holding its 10,000th formal meeting since 1946, with the number of adopted resolutions approaching 2,800.\n\nRestrictions against Iran were one of the main topics on the council’s agenda in September, and discussions may continue into October. In late September, the UN Security Council rejected a draft paper submitted by Russia and China that called for a six-month extension to Resolution 2231, which underpins the Iran nuclear deal. The United Nations' sanctions on Tehran came into effect on September 28, after the E3 (the United Kingdom, France and Germany) had triggered the snapback mechanism. Meanwhile, Russia pointed out that the reimposition of sanctions had no legal force as the snapback had been activated with violations.\n\nResolution 2231 will expire on October 18. Russian Deputy Permanent Representative to the UN Dmitry Polyansky said earlier that all restrictions and regulations provided for in the document would no longer be relevant after that date.\n\nIran nuclear deal\n\nIn 2015, Iran, along with China, France, Germany, Russia, the UK and the US signed the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), resolving a crisis that had begun in 2002 amid Western accusations that Tehran was seeking nuclear weapons. However, in 2018, US President Donald Trump announced Washington’s withdrawal from the JCPOA and reinstated all sanctions against Iran. In response, Tehran declared in 2020 that it would scale back its commitments under the JCPOA and restrict International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) inspectors’ access to the country’s nuclear facilities. However, the agency continued its inspections until the recent escalation of tensions between Iran and Israel.","summary":"Russian Permanent Representative to the UN Vasily Nebenzya will present the Security Council's monthly agenda at a press conference at the organization's headquarters","url":"https://tass.com/politics/2023421","image":"https://cdn-media.tass.ru/width/1200_4ce85301/tass/m2/en/uploads/i/20251001/1455105.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-10-01 00:30:48","author":"Tass","authors":["Tass"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"ru","sentiment":-0.171},{"id":365013616,"title":"Assassinations and Attempts That Rocked America — From Trump to Charlie Kirk... and Why One Shooter Is Now a Free Man","text":"These incidents have left the country stunned, with all of them changing history.\n\nRadarOnline.com can reveal some of the most shocking assassinations and attempts ever.Abraham LincolnAbraham Lincoln died on April 15, 1865, just a few hours after stage actor John Wilkes Booth shot him in the back of his head while at Ford's Theatre the previous evening.

And so, Senate Democrats have sacrificed the American people to Democrats' partisan interests.\" Republicans tried and failed to again advance their CR, which would have extended government funding until Nov. 21 with the main goal of giving lawmakers more time to pass the dozen spending bills needed to fund the government, a feat that hasn’t been accomplished since the 1990s.

Still, Schumer was resolute that Thune and the GOP needed to come to the negotiating table to solve that issue and craft a bipartisan CR. \"We hope they sit down with us and talk.

It took\nbarely 12 hours for this “peace plan” to begin to\nunravel. Already, Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu has\nbailed out of the few commitments that he made at the\nWhite House. No, there won’t ever be a Palestinian state;\nno, not even a reformed Palestine Authority will ever\nbe allowed to govern Gaza, and if any IDF withdrawal\noccurs from Gaza at all, it will be “modest” at\n\nHamas however, has to meet all the demands being\nmade of it - and quickly, or else. In reality, this “peace\nplan” is little more than a loaded gun being levelled at\nthe head of every Palestinian. No surprise, really. We’ve\nall been to the Gaza Peace Deal casino before. (See May\n2024. See January\n15, 2025.) Many of the points in the latest incarnation\nof the plan have been tabled– and rejected- before, with\nboth sides having their “under no circumstances”\nsticking points. So...what is the purpose of recycling so\nmuch that has already been discussed and rejected, and\ndressing it up as if it offers a significant new\nopportunity?\n\nOne logical explanation is that this\npeace plan – especially in the light of the absurd\ntimetable Donald Trump has imposed on Hamas –has been set\nup to fail. In which case, as\nFred Kaplan has pointed out on Slate, it\nwould be more accurate to treat this gambit as Trump giving\nhis pal Netanyahu the green light ( and cover) to finish the\ngenocidal war in Gaza, and by any means Israel\n\nAs presented, the plan is a win/win for\nIsrael. If Hamas signs up, Netanyahu gets the hostages back,\nwith no strings attached. If Hamas doesn’t sign, the US\nhas just given Israel a licence to complete the genocide.\nNone of which has stopped Foreign Minister Winston Peters\nfrom continuing to suck up to Trump, by\nwelcoming the American plan as an example of “global\nleadership.”\n\nAt the time of writing, Hamas\nhadn’t yet indicated what its response will be. Two of its\nkey allies – Qatar and Turkey – have reportedly urged\nHamas to sign. In the past, Hamas has said it will not\nunilaterally lay down its weapons, release all of the\n20 remaining live hostages (this time, within 72 hours!)\ndestroy all of its tunnels, disband as a political entity\netc without any equivalent concessions being made by Israel.\nSuch as: respecting a permanent ceasefire, and\nwithdrawing its forces from Gaza which - lest we forget,\nIsrael still occupies illegally, in defiance of\ninternational law and multiple UN resolutions.\n\npoint, even the extent of Israel’s commitment to the\nexchange of the Hamas-held hostages for a group of\nPalestinian prisoners being held in Israeli jails remains\n\nMissing the\n\nRegardless, Trump is giving\nHamas “3 to 4 days” to sign up to a plan that still\nlacks any number of essential details. Even amidst the self\n-congratulations at the White House, Trump and Netanyahu\nsaid they would not be taking questions, because they were\nstill waiting for “signatures and approvals” on some of\nthe relevant documents.\n\nMeaning: a lot of key details\nare still up in the air, and Hamas is being pressured to\nsign a blank cheque on them. This is not (yet) a peace plan.\nAt best, it is merely a framework for further negotiation\nover missing details that will be crucial to the outcome on\nthe ground. Under the deal, it is being proposed that a\n“board of peace” chaired by Donald Trump will (a) get to\ndecide who (besides Tony Blair) will be in Gaza’s\n“transitional government” (b) what its governing powers\nwill be and (c) when if ever, it will hand over the reins of\npower, and to whom. All of the details on this have yet to\nbe revealed.\n\nAlmost everything else is equally opaque.\nFor example: which countries (besides Pakistan and\nIndonesia) will comprise the armed forces that will form the\n“International Security Force (ISF)” that will police\nGaza, and what powers will it have – especially with\nrespect to policing the actions of the Israeli military?\nThis isn’t a mere technicality. When Israel kicked the\nUnited Nations out of food distribution in Gaza, it handed\nthat job over to the US -led Gaza Humanitarian\nFoundation.\n\nAs a result, food kitchens have become\nlethal death traps that have already killed three times as\nmany Palestinian civilians as the entire death toll of\nIsraelis and foreigners killed by Hamas on October 7.\nPalestinians have very good reason to fear any US-led\npolicing force in Gaza. (A force of UN peace-keepers would\nbe the least worst option. Why isn’t it being embraced?)\nWhat safeguards can Palestinians have that the ISF and IDF\nwill not jointly operate a similar “shoot on sight”\npolicy with respect to Palestinians in Gaza, while backing\noff any actions against the IDF?\n\nFinally...after all\nthe talk about the need for “democratic” solutions to\nthe Israel/Palestine conflict, we now have a 20 point\n“peace plan” for Palestine that doesn’t seem to have\nany input from Palestinians beyond ticking the “yes to all\nthe above” box.\n\nTrue, the plan does envisage that an\nalready docile and even further neutered Palestinian\nAuthority (PA) might (some day) be allowed to administer\nGaza, but only on terms that the West dictates, and only\nafter the PA has subjected itself to a “reform\nprogramme” to our satisfaction, and only after an election\ngets held (sometime) between candidates that Trump, Blair\nand their cronies have vetted and pre-approved. As mentioned\nabove however, Israel is already rejecting even this\ngrotesquely emasculated form of democracy.\n\nRegardless,\nit is a “deal” that’s being presented to Hamas as an\noffer it can’t refuse. Otherwise.... Palestinians in Gaza\nwill be ‘eliminated” by Israel, no further questions\nasked. If Hamas do eventually sign, make no mistake: the\nreluctant peacemakers here will have been Hamas, not the\nIsrael/US partnership that has inflicted such immense and\ndisproportionate suffering on the civilian population of\nGaza.

rolling out a new visa aimed at attracting foreign talent in the fields of science and technology.\n\nThe K visa comes into effect from Wednesday, following a proclamation last month by the State Council, China’s cabinet.\n\nThe visa has attracted particular attention in light of United States President Donald Trump’s tightening of the eligibility rules for the H-1B, which Silicon Valley heavily relies on to recruit skilled labour from overseas.\n\nWhat is the goal of the K visa, and how does it work?\n\nThe Chinese government has cast the visa as part of its efforts to attract foreign talent to boost the country’s competitiveness in science and technology.\n\nMinistry of Foreign Affairs spokesman Guo Jiakun on Tuesday said the visa’s purpose was to “promote exchanges and cooperation” between science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) talent from China and other countries.\n\nThe visa is the latest in a series of recent reforms intended to make China more attractive to foreigners, including streamlined visa processing and the introduction of a redesigned permanent residency card.\n\n“From the 1980s to the 2010s, China used to lose talent to developed countries such as the United States,” Zhigang Tao, a professor of strategy and economics at Cheung Kong Graduate School of Business in Beijing, told Al Jazeera.\n\n“Now the task is to keep local talent and also attract some global talent.”\n\nChinese officials have said the K visa, which will be open to graduates of recognised universities and young professionals engaged in STEM-related fields, will offer more flexible conditions than existing options.\n\nThe main advantage of the visa is that, unlike previous skilled migrant programmes, it does not require sponsorship by an employer.\n\nHowever, many key details of the visa remain unclear, including duration of stay and unspecified requirements related to age, educational background and work experience.\n\nIs the K visa likely to attract foreign talent?\n\nEdward Hu, immigration director at consultancy Newland Chase in Shanghai, said there has been strong interest in the visa, with inquiries up more than 30 percent since August.\n\nHu said there has been particularly strong interest from prospective applicants in India, Southeast Asia, Europe, and the US.\n\n“The K visa fills a gap in China’s talent system by lowering entry barriers for younger STEM talents – complementing the existing R visa, which targets top-tier experts,” Hu told Al Jazeera, referring to the visa as a “strategic move” to position China as a top destination for early-career STEM talent.\n\nThe R visa, introduced in 2013, is aimed at “high-level and professional” foreigners who are “urgently needed” by the state, and requires sponsorship by an “inviting organisation”.\n\nStill, China’s drive to expand its talent pool with the K visa faces challenges.\n\nWhile China has made moves to open to foreigners, the country is still far less internationalised than the US.\n\nUnlike the US, China rarely grants citizenship to foreigners.\n\nWhile Chinese permanent residency is more feasible to obtain, it is still only granted to a tiny fraction compared with the roughly one million non-US citizens who receive green cards each year.\n\nChinese work environments also present a language barrier for English-speaking applicants when compared with their Silicon Valley counterparts.\n\nMichael Feller, chief strategist at Sydney-based business consultancy Geopolitical Strategy, said Chinese companies would need to offer English-language roles and “international-style” work schedules to compete with US firms.\n\n“I can’t imagine many foreign graduates interested in the ‘9-9-6’ work-life balance that many Chinese firms are known for,” Feller told Al Jazeera, referring to the 72-hour workweek famously endorsed by Alibaba founder Jack Ma.\n\nWhat does the K visa have to do with the H-1B?\n\nWhile China’s drive to recruit talent has cast Trump’s crackdown on immigration in sharp relief, there is no direct link between the introduction of the K visa and his moves to rein in access to the H-1B.\n\nBeijing officially unveiled its visa on August 7, weeks before Trump announced the introduction of a $100,000 fee on H-1B applications, sending shockwaves through the tech sector, especially in India, the source of about 70 percent of visa recipients.\n\nHowever, many observers have suggested that the US’s inward turn could be to the benefit of other countries seeking to attract talent, including China.\n\n“The K visa is incredible timing from China’s perspective,” Feller said.\n\n“It’s unlikely that Beijing knew that Washington was about to hike the fees for its own H-1B visa category, but it certainly gives the K visa added impetus in the global war for talent.”\n\nHu of Newland Chase said he expected the shift in policy around the H-1B to “significantly boost” the appeal of the K visa, “positioning it as a timely alternative for affected talent”.\n\n“The K visa offers a low-cost, sponsor-free pathway – aligning with the global surge in STEM talent demand and making China a more accessible option,” he said.","summary":"China is rolling out a new visa aimed at foreign talent in STEM just as the US is tightening eligibility for the

Fletcher, under-secretary-general for humanitarian affairs and emergency relief coordinator.\n\nHe said the world body's teams, networks, supplies and expertise are in place and ready to be mobilised quickly and efficiently, as was done during the previous ceasefire that broke down in mid-March. As consistently emphasised, it is essential to end all attacks, restore public order, and facilitate humanitarian access to and throughout Gaza, Xinhua news agency reported.\n\nFletcher said that eliminating restrictions on the entry of critical items and the work of international nongovernmental organizations remains a key request. These steps would allow humanitarians to resume community-based services at a level that ensures no one is left behind.\n\nIt is also critical that the private sector is able to operate at a meaningful scale, he added, noting that humanitarian aid alone cannot meet the full scope of needs in Gaza.\n\nIt will be crucial to ensure that these conditions are sustained, along with generous and reliable funding, as well as the restoration of decimated facilities and infrastructure, said Fletcher.\n\nThe UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA), which Fletcher heads, warned that areas across the Gaza Strip, especially Gaza City, continue to come under heavy Israeli bombardment.\n\nThe UN Human Rights Office said that between Wednesday and Sunday, Israeli strikes intensified in the northwestern part of Deir al-Balah, with at least 89 Palestinians reportedly killed in at least a dozen separate incidents.\n\nOCHA said the Gaza health authorities reported that 175 people, including 35 children, have died from starvation and malnutrition since the confirmation of famine in the Gaza governorate in August.\n\nThe UN relief agency for Palestine refugees reported that in Gaza City, its teams operate 18 shelters for more than 4,000 people, although 28 others remain inaccessible or had to be evacuated. Only one of the agency's five medical points in Gaza City remains operational, said OCHA.\n\nSource: IANS","summary":"United Nations, Oct 1 (SocialNews.XYZ) UN relief chief Tom Fletcher recently welcomed US President Donald Trump's Gaza peace proposal for opening new possibilities to deliver large-scale, desperately needed life-saving aid. \"We are ready and eager...\n\n\nThe post UN relief chief sees US Gaza peace proposal opening possibilities for aid delivery appeared first on Social News XYZ.","url":"https://www.socialnews.xyz/2025/09/30/un-relief-chief-sees-us-gaza-peace-proposal-opening-possibilities-for-aid-delivery/","image":"https://i0.wp.com/www.socialnews.xyz/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/01/202510013526475.jpg?fit=729%2C589&quality=80&zoom=1&ssl=1?v=1759281007","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-09-30 23:57:51","author":"Gopi","authors":["Gopi"],"language":"en","source_country":"in","sentiment":-0.162},{"id":365007584,"title":"Democrats vote down GOP funding bill, putting government on path to shutdown","text":"WASHINGTON -- Senate Democrats have voted down a Republican bill to keep funding the government, putting it on a near certain path to a shutdown after midnight Wednesday for the first time in almost seven years.\n\nThe 55-45 vote Tuesday on the bill to extend federal funding for seven weeks fell short of the 60 needed to end a filibuster and pass the legislation. It came as Democrats are making good on their threat to close the government if President Donald Trump and Republicans won't accede to their health care demands. Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said Republicans are trying to \"bully\" Democrats by refusing to negotiate on an extension of health care benefits and other priorities.\n\nA government closure would mean that hundreds of thousands of federal workers could be furloughed or laid off. Trump threatened retribution on Democrats for a potential shutdown, saying Tuesday that it could include \"cutting vast numbers of people out, cutting things that they like, cutting programs that they like.\"\n\nInstead of negotiating, Democrats and Republicans angrily blamed each other Tuesday and refused to budge from their positions.\n\n\"It's only the president who can do this. We know he runs the show here,\" Schumer said Tuesday morning, after a bipartisan White House meeting the day before yielded little progress. \"Republicans have until midnight tonight to get serious with us,\" Schumer said.\n\nTrump and his fellow Republicans said they won't entertain any changes to the legislation, arguing that it's a stripped-down, \"clean\" bill that should be noncontroversial.\n\nSenate Majority Leader John Thune. R-S.D., said Republicans \"are not going to be held hostage\" by the Democrats' demands. The GOP-led House was on a weeklong recess, unavailable for immediate votes even if the Senate did find bipartisan agreement. And far from entering into negotiations, Trump instead posted a fake, mocking video of Democrats on Monday evening after the White House meeting.\n\nAfter Tuesday's votes, it was increasingly unlikely that either side would blink before the deadline.\n\nBlame game escalates\n\nWhile partisan stalemates over government spending are a frequent occurrence in Washington, the current impasse comes as Democrats see a rare opportunity to use their leverage to achieve policy goals and as their base voters are spoiling for a fight with Trump. Republicans who hold a 53-47 majority in the Senate needed at least eight votes from Democrats after Republican Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky opposed the bill.\n\nStill, Schumer said Trump and Republicans would be to blame if the government shuts down.\n\nThune said before the vote that he was \"hoping there are Democrats out there who are reasonable and understand what's at stake here.\"\n\nThe last shutdown was in Trump's first term, from December 2018 to January 2019, when he demanded that Congress give him money for his U.S.-Mexico border wall. Trump retreated after 35 days - the longest shutdown ever - amid intensifying airport delays and missed paydays for federal workers.\n\nDemocrats' health care asks\n\nMillions of people could face higher insurance premiums if the health care subsidies expire at the end of the year. Congress first put them in place in 2021, during the COVID-19 pandemic, to expand coverage for low- and middle-income people who purchase health insurance through the Affordable Care Act.\n\nDemocrats have said they want the subsidies immediately extended. They have also demanded that Republicans reverse the Medicaid cuts that were enacted as a part of Trump's \"big, beautiful bill\" this summer and for the White House to promise it will not move to rescind spending passed by Congress.\n\n\"We are not going to support a partisan Republican spending bill that continues to gut the health care of everyday Americans,\" House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries said.\n\nThune pressed Democrats to vote for the funding bill and take up the debate on tax credits later. Some Republicans are open to extending the tax credits, but many are strongly opposed to it.\n\nIn rare, pointed back-and-forth with Schumer on the Senate floor Tuesday morning, Thune said Republicans \"are happy to fix the ACA issue\" and have offered to negotiate with Democrats - if they will vote to keep the government open until Nov. 21.\n\nNo agreement at the White House\n\nThe bipartisan meeting at the White House on Monday was Trump's first with all four leaders in Congress since retaking the White House for his second term. Schumer said the group \"had candid, frank discussions\" about health care and the potential for health insurance costs to skyrocket once expanded Affordable Care Act tax credits expire Dec. 31.\n\nBut Trump did not appear to be ready for serious talks. Hours later, he posted a fake video of Schumer and House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries taken from footage of their real press conference outside of the White House after the meeting. In the altered video, a voiceover that sounds like Schumer's voice makes fun of Democrats and Jeffries stands beside him with a cartoon sombrero and mustache. Mexican music plays in the background.\n\nAt a news conference on the Capitol steps Tuesday morning, Jeffries said it was a \"racist and fake AI video.\"\n\nSchumer said that \"we have less than a day to figure this out\" and Trump is trolling on the internet \"like a 10-year-old.\"\n\nA critical, and unusual, vote for Democrats\n\nDemocrats are in an uncomfortable position for a party that has long denounced shutdowns as pointless and destructive, and it's unclear how or when it would end. But party activists and lawmakers have argued that Democrats need to do something to stand up to Trump.\n\n\"The level of appeasement that Trump demands never ends,\" said Sen. Peter Welch, D-Vt. \"We've seen that with universities, with law firms, with prosecutors. So is there a point where you just have to stand up to him? I think there is.\"\n\nSome groups called for Schumer's resignation in March after he and nine other Democrats voted to break a filibuster and allow a Republican-led funding bill to advance to a final vote.\n\nSchumer said then that he voted to keep the government open because a shutdown would have made things worse as Trump's administration was slashing government jobs. He says now that he believes things have changed, including the passage this summer of the massive GOP tax cut bill that reduced Medicaid.\n\nShutdown preparations begin\n\nThe stakes are huge for federal workers across the country as the White House told agencies last week that they should consider \"a reduction in force\" for many federal programs if the government shuts down. That means that workers who are not deemed essential could be fired instead of just furloughed.\n\nEither way, most would not get paid. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimated in a letter to Iowa Sen. Joni Ernst on Tuesday that around 750,000 federal workers could be furloughed each day once a shutdown begins.\n\nVirginia Sen. Mark Warner, a Democrat, said some of the many federal workers in his state support a shutdown.\n\n\"What I hear from federal workers is they've been on a slow, shutdown firing since the beginning of this administration,\" Warner said. \"They want us to push back.\"\n\nFederal agencies were already preparing. On the home page of the Department of Housing and Urban Development, a large pop up ad reads, \"The Radical Left are going to shut down the government and inflict massive pain on the American people.\"\n\nAssociated Press writers Seung Min Kim, Kevin Freking, Matthew Brown, Darlene Superville and Joey Cappelletti in Washington contributed to this report.","summary":"The 55-45 vote Tuesday on the bill to extend federal funding for seven weeks fell short of the 60 needed to end a filibuster and pass the legislation.","url":"https://abc7.com/post/government-shutdown-senate-democrats-vote-down-gop-funding-bill-hours-before-looming-deadline/17913173/","image":"https://cdn.abcotvs.com/dip/images/17913148_092925-wabc-ap-government-shutdown-img.jpg?w=1600","video":"https://vcl.abcotv.net/video/kabc/093025-kabc-5p-govt-shutdown-vid.mp4","publish_date":"2025-09-30 23:57:00","author":"Mary Clare Jalonick, Lisa Mascaro And Stephen Groves","authors":["Mary Clare Jalonick, Lisa Mascaro And Stephen Groves"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.34},{"id":365009016,"title":"Trump Must Carry Out His Threat to Implement DOGE 2.0 During This Government Shutdown","text":"Now that Democrats have shut down the government by voting against a clean continuing resolution that would have kept funding at Biden-era levels, President Donald Trump needs to fulfill his threat to fire more bureaucrats.\n\nWhile Republicans offered to keep funding the government at Biden levels until Congress can pass annual funding legislation, Democrats have unreasonably demanded that Congress continue generous COVID-19-era Obamacare subsidies and reverse the Medicaid reforms in the One Big Beautiful Bill Act passed earlier this year. Since funding legislation requires 60 votes to pass the Senate, Republicans needed at least seven Democrats or independents to help pass the resolution, and they only got three.\n\nLast week, the White House Office of Management and Budget released a memo, telling federal agencies that if the government were to shut down, they should consider engaging in Reductions in Force to begin the process of laying off employees in projects that are not funded during the shutdown or that are inconsistent with Trump’s priorities.\n\nDemocrats who marched alongside federal government unions in protesting Trump’s efforts to cut the size and scope of the federal government through the Department of Government Efficiency should have considered this when voting against funding the government.\n\nWhat Happens in a Shutdown?\n\nA senior administration official told The Daily Signal that the administration has engaged in hundreds of phone calls preparing for a shutdown, and the process will be normal, but will also feature the RIFs.\n\nA government shutdown means the normal appropriations from Congress cease, so only a few government functions still operate. Some government functions receive other forms of funding—such as the Internal Revenue Service that collects money through taxes or the patent examiners who are funded through patent fees. Other government functions are deemed too essential to be put on hold, such as the military and Secret Service protection for the president and others.\n\nMany government functions are considered not “essential,” and therefore, they will cease.\n\nAgencies will furlough many employees—ordering them not to work because there is no funding for their functions. Most of these bureaucrats will return to work when the funding has been restored, often with backpay. \n\nStatutorily mandated government functions do not end permanently, and they must be resurrected when funding returns. The administration has a fair degree of latitude when it comes to deciding what is and is not essential, however.\n\nIn the 2013 shutdown, for example, President Barack Obama made a show of roping off national parks. Rangers even closed the parking lots at Mount Vernon, the home of George Washington, despite the fact that a private organization, not the federal government, owns the property. \n\nSimilarly, Trump has a fair amount of latitude in determining what counts as essential, and the functions he deems non-essential may highlight areas the administration should trim.\n\nAs Don Devine, President Ronald Reagan’s personnel director, told The Daily Signal on Tuesday, the fact that many federal bureaucrats are considered not “essential” in a shutdown “presents a real opportunity.”\n\nFundamentally, the administration aims to do more with less. The premise of these shutdown RIFs is the same premise as DOGE—the government can fulfill its statutorily-mandated duties with fewer, better-trained staff and more up-to-date tools, and the same kind of creative destruction that helps private sector businesses thrive will help the government become more effective.\n\nStanding Up to Unions\n\nOn Tuesday, the American Federation of Government Employees, the largest federal government union, filed a lawsuit aiming to block the OMB memo, claiming that it violated the Administrative Procedures Act.\n\nThe lawsuit claims that the memo misstates the law and that any work to carry out a reduction in force is not authorized under the Antideficiency Act, which stipulates how the government should operate during shutdowns.\n\nImportantly, the AFGE press release warns that the OMB memo involves “directing agencies to issue mass RIF notices that could strip employees of back pay rights, violate agencies’ statutory duties, and even target workers whose jobs are essential to protecting life and property during a shutdown.”\n\nYet no agency has published a RIF notice, and until such notices come, this statement relies on speculation about harms.\n\nFurthermore, when an agency announces a reduction in force, that does not result in immediate termination. Reductions in force involve a notice period during which staff will examine each employee, look at their rights, where they will likely be able to find their next job, and provide further notice if the employee is over 40. \n\nOf course, the legal challenge is no surprise. The AFGE has filed multiple lawsuits against the Trump administration, seeking to block the president’s reforms, particularly on DOGE. \n\nThe Trump administration should follow the law and abide by any lawful court orders to come out of this case. However, it should not be cowed by a federal employee union’s opposition to further reforms to streamline the federal government.\n\nFundamentally, another round of reductions in force is good for the federal government, and this government shutdown presents an opportunity for agencies to clean house.","summary":"Now that Democrats have shut down the government by voting against a clean continuing resolution that would have kept funding at Biden-era levels, President Donald...

For some Americans, it’s becoming closer to reality. \n\nThe new tax legislation under President Donald Trump’s ‘One Big Beautiful Bill Act’ might enable millions to avoid paying any federal income tax for the tax year 2025, when they file in 2026.\n\nEstimates from the Tax Policy Center suggest the percentage of households not paying income tax could rise from 40% to 42%.\n\nPeople who will benefit the most from the new tax law include parents, overtime workers, tip-makers, seniors aged 65 and up, and adoptive families.\n\nTipped workers will be able to deduct up to $25,000 in tips from taxable income, and overtime workers can deduct up to $12,500 of overtime pay. \n\nSeniors will be allowed to deduct an extra $6,000 on top of their standard deduction. \n\nParents can claim a child tax credit — $2,200 per child — with refundable options, and the adoption tax for families is now refundable. \n\nThis is largely due to additional deductions, including the standard deduction, child tax credit, and earned income credit, allowing many working- and middle-class taxpayers to completely eliminate their income tax burden without needing intricate tax strategies.\n\nExperts say that, because the new tax breaks mostly go to lower and middle-income taxpayers, they will not blow a huge hole in the budget.\n\nThis is partly because these groups contribute a smaller proportion of the total federal income tax revenue, especially when compared against tax reductions for high-income individuals or businesses.\n\n‘These deductions won’t affect government deficit so much,’ Fort Lauderdale economist Michael Szanto told the Daily Mail. \n\nAccording to Szanto, the top 10% of earners in the United States already contribute the bulk of federal income taxes. Therefore, unless these taxpayers receive substantial tax reductions, overall federal revenue won’t decrease significantly.\n\n‘Payroll taxes on the other hand disproportionately affect lower income families,’ Szanto explained.\n\n‘Those who receive large amounts of their income through tips and overtime can be helped by this new package,’ he continued. \n\n‘Everyone should work carefully to study to maximize the credits and deductions applicable to their respective situation.’\n\nKarla Dennis, a tax expert and CEO of the tax strategy company KDA, Inc., stated, ‘Ordinary, hardworking Americans will see the most advantage.’\n\n‘The way to maximize this new law is to be intentional with planning. Families should use retirement accounts, health savings accounts, and dependent care accounts to reduce taxable income,’ Dennis said.\n\n‘Workers should be sure to claim every credit they qualify for, especially child and education related credits. Seniors can lean on the larger standard deduction and lower tax rates on investment income. \n\nShe added: ‘The people who track their finances and use these tools during the year will be the ones who truly win… Everyday Americans can now benefit in a very simple way while wealthier households will need to focus on layered planning.’\n\nThe Wall Street Journal presented multiple different scenarios in which someone could pay $0 in federal income tax.\n\nFor example, a married couple that makes $100,000 (including overtime pay) with two kids under 13 could use child tax credits, standard deduction, and maybe overtime/tip deductions to reduce tax to $0. \n\nA single waitress with one child could use tips deduction, earned income tax credit, standard deduction, and child credit to eliminate her tax bill.\n\nOr a retired couple with multiple income sources could use standard deduction, senior deduction, charitable deduction, and tax-exempt portions of Social Security to reduce income tax to zero.\n\nNotably, even if someone pays nothing in federal income tax, they may still pay payroll taxes, state income tax, sales tax, and property tax. \n\nIn many cases, these taxes are larger than any eliminated federal income tax.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nEver wondered what a tax-free life would look like?

As young at heart as ever, the Mallow native offers a few nuggets of advice - and a few amusing insights for good measure, including on Trump and Tommy Tiernan's use of the F-word.\n\n“There have been a lot of changes over the years, some of which are very positive but others that are not so welcome. \n\n I’m definitely not a Donald Trump fan. He thinks he is God but, in actual fact, he doesn’t have a clue what he is saying. \n\n\"The sad thing is that nobody can say a word against him.\"\n\n\"Another thing that has changed is television. I remember the old shows like The Riordans and Upstairs Downstairs. They were great, as was Glenroe, but there is too much bad language on television today. \n\n\"I loved Tommy Tiernan’s talk show but he uses the F-word far too much. You wouldn’t see it on BBC. It wouldn’t and shouldn’t be allowed. It’s a pity because Tommy Tiernan’s show is very good and he has the most interesting guests.” \n\nShe acknowledges that some changes, however, are for the better including how society treats people with disabilities.\n\n“In my day you would never see a person with disabilities. They were either locked away or kept behind closed doors which was really sad. Today, people with disabilities are very much included in society. \n\n\"They have opportunities now and can go so many places which wasn’t the case in my day. The only shame that still exists is for children with special needs who can’t get places in schools. That to me is very wrong.” \n\nNora, who has five children, 16 grandchildren and nine great grandchildren, says there are some parts of getting older which she finds difficult.\n\n“My husband Frank Moloney is dead six years now. He was 95 years old and previously worked on the railway. I miss him a lot. I hated closing the door into an empty house after he died. That was probably the hardest part.” \n\nAnd she puts her alert mind and youthful appearance down to good genes.\n\n“I do have expensive taste and use Lancome products on my skin but it’s the luck of the draw I think. My mother always looked healthy and she never wore make-up. You couldn’t afford it back then. All she ever used was a bit of moisturiser but that was it. \n\n\"The best thing about being my age is you can do what you like. I have had to slow down and remember there are some things I can’t do anymore. I couldn’t go up on a ladder, but I get up at 7.30am every morning and go to mass. \n\n\"I didn’t learn to drive till I was 50 so I was a very late learner. Now, I drive myself to swimming every day and do bridge twice a week. \n\n\"If the blinds are down, you’d have somebody coming over or ringing to make sure I’m not dead since I’m always out and about.” \n\nNora said her family endured struggles growing up, but paid tribute to her own mother.\n\n“My father was killed while working as a postman. He had an accident on his bicycle and only lived for a week after. I was seven and the youngest was three months. \n\n\"My mum was marvelous. She was a great cook and made all our clothes. We had hens and turkeys and were very self-sufficient. The only thing we really had to buy was tea, sugar and butter.” \n\nAccording to Nora’s daughter Mary, the 100-year-old is adored by the whole family for being so kind.\n\n She has 16 grandchildren and nine great grandchildren and remembers every one of their birthdays and the day they were born. She’ll send a card to every one of them without fail. \n\nShe describes her as extremely independent and resilient.\n\n“Mum went on a cruise in January. Unfortunately her luggage got lost on the flight over. She adores her style and would have loved to have worn something new every night but when something goes wrong she just accepts it. I think this has a lot to do with her resilience.”","summary":"Nora Moloney has a few things to say about Donald Trump and Tommy Tiernan's use of the F-word","url":"https://www.irishexaminer.com/news/munster/arid-41714919.html","image":"https://www.irishexaminer.com/cms_media/module_img/9604/4802262_13_seoimage1x1_LC_20nora_2001.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-09-30 23:53:00","author":"Irishexaminer.com,Sarah Horgan","authors":["Irishexaminer.com","Sarah Horgan"],"language":"en","source_country":"ie","sentiment":-0.151},{"id":365004418,"title":"A new push for peace: What part did Australia play in the 20-point plan for Gaza?","text":"Just hours after that moment of reflection at the largest Muslim place of worship in the UAE, the White House was thick with anticipation as United States President Donald Trump and Israel&apos;s Prime Minster Benjamin Netanyahu addressed the press pack — with no questions taken — to spell out a new plan for peace. When asked about what role Australia might play in a \"day after\" scenario if the peace plan works, Albanese has been quick to underscore Australia&apos;s status as a middle power and one that is far from the conflict in the Middle East. Last week, Albanese took to the United Nations podium in New York for the first time since being elected . He argued for middle powers to work together to bring global chaos into order, spelling out the potential for those countries to wield more power. And while not all the countries that strategically confirmed recognition of statehood last week would be defined as middle powers, heavy hitters like the United Kingdom and France were acting in tandem with Australia, Canada, Portugal and a handful of other countries to definitively break with the US and throw their support behind a Palestinian state . Recognising statehood was Australia&apos;s big foreign policy power play in the Gaza space, but going it alone would have barely registered a splash. The wall of so-called \"like-minded” Western countries shifting together created something different. Momentum. So Albanese jetted into New York for the UN General Assembly and made Palestinian recognition his first announcement. On that first day, under a giant framed photo of rippling water, he also met with the King of Jordan, Abdullah II, and they spoke about the two-state solution and what could be achieved at the UN. Then, as Albanese spoke with an array of world leaders, a conversational thread was unfolding throughout his longest international trip since he first came to power. The future of Gaza was on the agenda in bilateral talks with France. President Emmanuel Macron led the shift to statehood, alongside Saudi Arabia. In the UK, Prime Minister Keir Starmer told reporters his one-on-one talks with Albanese at 10 Downing Street included forward planning for the region, if a ceasefire could be achieved. After both nations moved to recognition, \"now we needed to find a way forward to end the fighting, free the hostages and deliver a long-term peace for Palestinians and Israelis alike,\" a statement from Starmer read. At Stoke Lodge, the Australian High Commissioner&apos;s London residence, former Labour Leader Tony Blair, the man touted by the White House to help lead a transitional authority in Gaza after a ceasefire, was deep in conversation with Albanese, describing him as a friend. Albanese later told reporters he thought Blair could play a \"constructive\" role, the pair have been in ongoing communication about the conflict. All these conversations, and many more with Foreign Minister Penny Wong that haven&apos;t been listed, have taken place over the last 11 days. But the outcomes for Australia are unclear. When Macron revealed discussions about a multinational peacekeeping force in Gaza after the conflict is over, Albanese said he would give \"consideration\" to any Australian involvement, at the appropriate time. The question of Australian boots on the ground was \"hypothetical\", according to Wong. In the White House joint press conference with Netanyahu, Trump said some countries \"foolishly recognised the Palestinian state … but they’re really, I think, doing that because they&apos;re very tired of what&apos;s going on\". That reference reveals the momentum had an impact on Trump&apos;s thinking, a concession about the level of conflict fatigue and frustration. Former Australian Ambassador to Lebanon Ian Parmeter said the developments show the government made the right decision. \"My assessment is that the Trump 20-point plan vindicates the decision of Australia and several other Western countries to recognise a Palestinian state,\" Parmeter, currently a research scholar in Middle East Studies at ANU, said. \"Our recognition was well-timed and puts us on the right side of history. It also adds to international pressure on Israel to abide by the Trump plan.\" But he said it was important not to outsize the impact of Australia&apos;s actions. \"That said, I have no doubt that Trump had other considerations in mind in producing his plan and pressuring Netanyahu to accept it. Trump doubtless saw an opportunity and decided to go for it big time.\" UN special rapporteur focused on counter terrorism and torture, Ben Saul sees the joint international movement on recognition as a significant step towards a resolution. \"Recognition by Australia and others undoubtedly intensified pressure on an isolated US to break with the failed status quo in Palestine and insist that Israel compromise to accept the Trump peace plan,\" Saul said. But he&apos;s also warned there are many unknowns about how Hamas and the Palestinian Authority will now fulfil their obligations. \"Elements of the plan positively reflect global opinion, but there are also major international law red flags, including inadequate respect for self-determination and statehood, a lack of concrete timeframes and benchmarks, continued partial occupation by Israel, a lack of United Nations supervision, and no justice and accountability,\" he said. The stakes are high. \"If the plan is implemented in full, it will be the biggest step forward in Middle East peacemaking since the Oslo Accords. Trump&apos;s Nobel stocks will rise enormously,\" Parmeter said. In an exclusive interview with SBS News in New York, Wong considered the question of Nobel status for Trump. When asked if she thought Donald Trump deserved the Nobel Peace Prize, Wong responded; \"What I can say is no one has been able to end this war in Gaza, and he is uniquely placed to be able to end the war in Gaza and set the region on a path to peace, and I hope he is able to do that\". For Albanese, the critical shift to lay the groundwork for the statehood push was the movement from Arab states and the role the broader Middle East will play. The talks with MBZ in Abu Dhabi matter, even if they took place on a refuelling stop for Albanese. In a joint statement released after the hour-long talks, the pair appealed for a ceasefire, the release of hostages and aid to be delivered.

The collapse of negotiations underscored deep partisan fissures, with both Republicans and Democrats trading blame as federal agencies brace for immediate disruption. The deadlock was cemented on September 30, when the Senate voted 55-45 in favour of a Republican-backed continuing resolution passed earlier by the House. The bill, however, fell short of the 60 votes needed to overcome a filibuster, effectively killing the proposal. Senate Majority Leader John Thune (R-SD) accused Democrats of “hostage-taking” over their demands for healthcare protections, telling colleagues on the floor, “This is the Schumer shutdown.” Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) rejected that characterisation, arguing that Republicans had “hijacked” negotiations with partisan riders. Appearing on NBC’s Meet the Press, Schumer said, “We need a serious negotiation, not one-party ultimatums.” President Donald Trump, who presided over the last shutdown in 2018-2019, convened congressional leaders at the White House on September 29 in a final attempt at compromise. But the meeting quickly devolved into recriminations. According to aides present, Trump criticised Democrats for blocking what he described as a “clean” extension, while Democrats countered that the bill contained hidden cuts to Medicaid and foreign aid. Votes Today Seal the Deal – Senate's Dual Failures and Blame Barrage The Republican bill, formally designated H.R. 5371, sought to extend funding into December while advancing GOP priorities. Despite support from three Democrats—Sen. John Fetterman (PA), Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto (NV), and independent Sen. Angus King (ME)—the measure was blocked under the chamber’s cloture rule. Democrats had introduced their own alternative, a one-month extension until October 31 that preserved Affordable Care Act subsidy protections. That plan failed 47-53 along party lines after a Republican filibuster. Sen. Rand Paul (R-KY) opposed both proposals, citing what he called “fiscal irresponsibility.” On the House side, Speaker Mike Johnson (R-LA) accused Democrats of prioritising politics over governance. Speaking to CNN, Johnson warned, “Their demands are outrageous and their obstruction is harming government workers and Americans who rely on these services.” Progressive Democrats, led by Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), staged an online rally throughout the day, accusing Republicans of pushing “MAGA cuts to healthcare.” In contrast, conservative figures such as former Trump adviser Stephen Miller used social media to accuse Democrats of “choosing criminal aliens over citizens.” Get Latest News Live on Times Now along with Breaking News and Top Headlines from US News and around the World.","summary":"The United States government has officially shut down for the first time since 2019 after Senate votes failed to approve funding.

Dr. Larry Braunstein, who died in 2007 and ran his practice in Queens, is said to have diagnosed Trump as a favour to his landlord at the time, Fred Trump, according to recent reports. Dr. Elysa Braunstein and Sharon Kessel, the daughters of the deceased doctor , relayed this tale to the New York Times, stating that it was a story often told by their father. \"It was family lore,\" Elysa Braunstein shared with the Times, adding that it was \"something we would always discuss\" within their circle of family and friends. However, the Times was unable to find any documents to back up the family's claims. Elysa Braunstein confessed she wasn't certain if her father had ever actually examined Donald Trump , reports the Irish Star . Records obtained by the Times reveal that Dr. Braunstein rented his office in Jamaica, Queens, from Fred Trump during the 1960s. His daughters informed the publication that their father provided the bone spurs diagnosis as a courtesy to the elder Trump. \"I know it was a favour,\" Elysa Braunstein told the Times, suggesting that this \"small favour\" gave her father \"access\" to Fred Trump. \"If there was anything wrong in the building, my dad would call and (Fred) Trump would take care of it immediately,\" she added. In 1968, following his graduation from the University of Pennsylvania, Donald Trump was diagnosed with bone spurs in his heels at 22 years of age, as reported by CNN. Prior to receiving this medical assessment, Trump had postponed military service on four occasions to complete his education. During a 2016 conversation with The Times, Trump revealed that a doctor \"gave me a letter – a very strong letter – on the heels\" which he presented to draft boards. Trump couldn't recall the physician's name when questioned during the interview. Heel spurs are bony growths resulting from calcium deposits forming on the heel bone. The condition can be treated through stretching exercises, orthotic devices, or surgical intervention. The president confirmed he never underwent an operation for this ailment. President Trump's wellbeing has come under examination since he began his second term in office. His administration revealed this summer that the president had been diagnosed with chronic venous insufficiency. This medical condition develops when veins in the limbs sustain damage, which may result in swelling, aching, and discomfort.

HUD officials pushed back on those claims, noting the banner did not refer to an election, and did not mention any party or politician by name.\n\nMessages to federal employees\n\nEmployees across the federal government have reported receiving messages noting Trump’s general opposition to a shutdown.\n\nEmployees at the Departments of Interior, the Food and Drug Administration and the Department of Justice received a message noting that Trump “opposes a government shutdown, and strongly supports the enactment of HR 5371,” the GOP-backed bill to fund the government through Nov. 21.\n\n“Unfortunately Democrats are blocking the resolution in the Senate due to unrelated policy demands,” the message went on. “If Congressional Democrats maintain their current posture and refuse to pass a clean continuing resolution to keep the government funded before midnight on Sept. 30, 2025, federal funding will lapse.”\n\nSome agencies, like the Securities and Exchange Commission, posted more informational notices online, detailing planning for operating status changes “concurrently with the rest of the federal government.”\n\nFurloughs and layoffs\n\nSome federal employees would be furloughed during a shutdown, and the White House’s budget office has warned agencies to consider permanently cutting staff in some of the areas that would be affected, a new twist on the situation.\n\nIn a memo released last week, the Office of Management and Budget said agencies should consider a reduction in force for federal programs whose funding would lapse this week, are not otherwise funded and are “not consistent with the President’s priorities.” That would be a much more aggressive step than in previous shutdowns, when federal workers not deemed essential were furloughed but returned to their jobs once Congress approved government spending.\n\nA reduction in force would not only lay off employees but eliminate their positions. That would trigger another massive upheaval in a federal workforce that has already faced major rounds of cuts this year due to efforts from the Department of Government Efficiency and elsewhere in the Trump administration.\n\nAli Swenson in New York contributed reporting.","summary":"It raised questions about possible Hatch Act violations, which limit partisan activities by federal employees.","url":"https://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/2025/09/30/congress-shutdown-messaging/","image":"https://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/APTOPIX_Trump_60231-1.jpg?w=150&strip=all","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-09-30 23:47:25","author":"Associated Press,Gqlshare","authors":["Associated Press","Gqlshare"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.37},{"id":365012964,"title":"Watch: Mike Johnson Blasts Democrats' Government Shutdown Hypocrisy with Their Own Words","text":"House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-LA) put the Democrats on blast with their own words, showing their hypocrisy as they protested against previous government shutdowns while refusing to put a stop to the looming shutdown that will occur at midnight Tuesday if they do not compromise with Republicans.\n\nJohnson has the following video playing on loop on a television outside his office in the U.S. Capitol, pointing out the blatant contradictions of Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY), House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries (D-NY), Rep.

He and Hegseth, a former Fox News pundit, addressed hundreds of top military officials who were hastily summoned from around the globe to Virginia. Here, they were lectured on troops' physical fitness and their loyalty to the Trump administration's anti-DEI initiatives. But amid the bizarre spectacle, the US President made a chillingly authoritarian admission. \"I told Pete [Hegseth], we should use some of these dangerous cities as training grounds for our military,\" Trump said. \"It's the enemy from within and we have to handle it before it gets out of control,\" he added, allegedly referring to criminals and immigrants. These dual messages highlight the Trump administration's efforts not only to reshape contemporary Pentagon culture but also to enlist military resources for the president's priorities and decidedly domestic purposes. This includes quelling opposition to his administration's often baseless shows of force on Democratic cities he claims have \"out of control\" violent crime. \"We're under invasion from within. No different than a foreign enemy but more difficult in many ways because they don't wear uniforms,\" Trump said. Hegseth summoned hundreds of military leaders and their top advisers from around the globe to the Marine Corps base in Quantico, without publicly disclosing the reason. According to The Associated Press, his speech primarily revolved around well-worn talking points that depicted a military hindered by \"woke\" policies, and he suggested military leaders should \"do the honourable thing and resign\" if they disagree with his new approach. While meetings between military brass and civilian leaders are not uncommon, this particular gathering sparked intense speculation due to the speed at which it was convened and the secrecy surrounding it. The fact that admirals and generals from conflict zones were called for a lecture on race and gender in the military highlighted how the country's culture wars have become a key agenda item for Hegseth's Pentagon, even amidst widespread national security concerns worldwide. Bryan Clark, a senior fellow and director of the Centre for Defence Concepts and Technology at the Hudson Institute, commented that the Secretary of Defence's speech on Tuesday seemed more aimed at generating public relations content than \"aligning the leadership around a set of ideas that the Trump administration is going to pursue.\" Clark said that there had been some anticipation that Hegseth would discuss budget priorities, military investments or the new national defence strategy, which the Pentagon is expected to unveil soon. Clark commented that the message didn't align with the seriousness of an event that gathered hundreds of senior military leaders in one room. \"You'd think that the purpose of that would have been something more dramatic and important than grooming standards and physical fitness standards,\" he remarked. Janessa Goldbeck, a former Marine and current CEO of the Vet Voice Foundation, suggested that the defence secretary's speech on Tuesday was more about \"stoking grievance than strengthening the force.\" She criticised Hegseth's plan for relaxing the rules for discipline in the military, equating abuse with toughness, as the \"mark of someone who's never seen the real thing. \"It takes no strength to hit a recruit - it takes real strength to teach one,\" she stated. \"I had a front-row seat every day to the extraordinary training our recruits receive from the most disciplined, professional Marines in the fleet,\" Goldbeck recalled her experience at Marine boot camp in California, while pointing out that Hegseth \"never served as a drill instructor and never trained a recruit.\" The secretary \"has a cartoonish, 1980s comic-book idea of toughness he's never outgrown,\" she said. \"Instead of focusing on what actually improves force readiness, he continues to waste time and taxpayer dollars on He-Man culture-war theatrics.\" Trump, meanwhile, has already pushed the boundaries of a nearly 150-year-old federal law, the Posse Comitatus Act, which limits the military's role in enforcing domestic laws. He has dispatched National Guard and active duty Marines to Los Angeles, threatened to do the same to tackle alleged crime and illegal immigration in other Democratic-led cities, including Portland and Chicago, and increased troops at the U.S.-Mexico border. National Guard members are generally exempt from the law as they are under state authority and controlled by governors. However, the law does apply to them when they're \"federalised\" and put under the president's control, as happened in Los Angeles over the Democratic governor's objections.","summary":"Trump told senior generals that they will be going to 'war' against American cities after deploying troops in urban areas across the country","url":"https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/us-news/trump-vows-use-dangerous-cities-35993157","image":"https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/article35993156.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200b/0_Israels-Benjamin-Netanyahu-Meets-With-Trump-At-The-White-House.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-09-30 23:41:02","author":"Peter Rubinstein,William Morgan","authors":["Peter Rubinstein","William Morgan"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":0.029},{"id":365004266,"title":"Pete Hegseth had a lot to say when he summoned military leaders. Here are some facts and context","text":"Armed with a 10-point plan and pacing a stage in Quantico, Virginia, on Tuesday, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth enumerated for hundreds of assembled military leaders just how much of the force's policy, philosophy and culture will change for more than 2 million Americans in uniform under President Donald Trump's command.\n\n\"For too long, we’ve promoted too many uniformed leaders for the wrong reasons based on their race, based on gender quotas, based on historic so-called firsts,\" Hegseth said. The approach, he said, made the Pentagon “less capable and less lethal.” Hegseth talked up his and Trump’s focus on “the warrior ethos” and “peace through strength.\"\n\n“No more identity months, DEI offices, dudes in dresses. No more climate change worship, no more division, distraction or gender delusions. No more debris,” he declared.\n\nHere are some of Hegseth's words and some context behind them:\n\n ‘The highest male standard’ \n\nWHAT HE SAID: “Any place where tried and true physical standards were altered, especially since 2015, when combat arms standards were changed to ensure females could qualify, must be returned to their original standard.”\n\nTHE BACKSTORY: It's not clear what Hegseth meant by returning physical expectations to their “original standard.” But military culture and the role of women have changed dramatically in recent decades, and Hegseth aims to change them back.\n\nIn 2015, then-Defense Secretary Ash Carter ordered that all military jobs be open to women. That change followed three years of study and wrangling and was a formal recognition that thousands of women had served — and many were wounded or killed — on battlefields in Iraq and Afghanistan.\n\nCarter said then that the military could no longer afford to exclude half the population from high-risk military posts and that any man or woman who meets the standards should be able to serve. Special operations forces, in surveys done in 2015 and more recently, said women lacked the physical or mental strength to serve in elite commando units and doing so could hurt the units’ effectiveness.\n\nHegseth said the policy will be to ensure that “every designated combat arms position returns to the highest male standard.” But he was careful to say that the policy is not an effort to block women from serving. \n\n“When it comes to any job that requires physical power to perform in combat, those physical standards must be high and gender neutral,” he said. “If women can make it, excellent. If not, it is what it is. If that means no women qualify for some combat jobs, so be it. That is not the intent, but it could be the result.”\n\nJenn Bennie, an Iraq War veteran and former combat helicopter pilot, said she agrees with Hegseth's comments. “That is the standard I upheld when I became a Navy pilot in 2001. It was a pilot standard and it benefits everyone, including women who have met that universal requirement,” she wrote in an email. \"It lets everyone know that every pilot is mentally and physically combat-capable to go into warfare, putting no one under undue risk.”\n\n ‘What were the military standards in 1990?’ \n\nWHAT HE SAID: “What were the military standards in 1990? And if they have changed, tell me why. Was it a necessary change based on the evolving landscape of combat, or was the change due to a softening, weakening or gender-based pursuit of other priorities?”\n\nTHE BACKSTORY: Before 1991, women were barred by law from flying combat missions and serving on naval combat ships. Noting the performance of female pilots in the Persian Gulf War, Congress rescinded the laws in the early 1990s. By 1994, women were allowed to serve in most roles not involving direct ground combat.\n\nFaced with the fallout of the Vietnam War and racial tensions within the ranks, the military was trying to boost recruitment numbers, said Gary Solis, a former Marine Corps prosecutor and military judge who has taught the laws of war at universities.\n\n“It was needed and I don’t believe it weakened the military,” Solis said.\n\nIn 1991, the U.S. launched its assault on Iraqi forces in Kuwait. In purely military and political terms, the first Gulf War was a tremendous success. The U.S. held together an allied army, its war effort was supported by a number of United Nations resolutions, and the conflict cemented its position as the sole world power following the end of the Cold War and the collapse of the Soviet Union.\n\n ‘Fat troops’ \n\nWHAT HE SAID: “Frankly, it’s tiring to look out at combat formations or really any formation and see fat troops. Likewise, it’s completely unacceptable to see fat generals and admirals in the halls of the Pentagon and leading commands around the country and the world. It’s a bad look.”\n\nTHE BACKSTORY: Three-quarters of Americans aged 17 to 24 are not eligible for military service for several reasons, including extra weight. Being overweight is the biggest individual disqualifier, affecting more than 1 in 10 potential recruits, research has showed.\n\nSome have debated whether the physical requirements demanded of service members across the board are still relevant or should be adjusted according to the job so the armed forces can maintain the pool of talent it needs for today’s high-tech warfare, while competing with higher salaries offered by the private sector.\n\nIn 2016, the Navy loosened its body fat restrictions to allow those who failed their physical fitness exams three or more times to get one more opportunity to be tested under the more lenient guidelines. The Navy said at the time it had been losing too many talented sailors. Some were resorting to liposuction, diet pills and other measures to save their careers.\n\nThen-Navy Secretary Ray Mabus said the service was not lowering standards but rather adjusting to reality: People today, in general, are bigger but not necessarily fat. \n\n ‘Kill people and break things’ \n\nWHAT HE SAID: “You kill people and break things for a living. You are not politically correct and don’t necessarily belong always in polite society.”\n\nTHE BACKSTORY: The throughline of Hegseth's remarks was that members of the military are there to, first and foremost, “unleash overwhelming and punishing violence on the enemy,” through continual mission training and maintaining equipment. In terms of attitude, he said he expected aggressiveness and risk-taking and turning away from what he has called a “woke” culture that he says has weakened the military.\n\nThat was why, he told the gathered military leaders, the changes being implemented would include how complaints alleging toxic leadership are dealt with, how infractions would be recorded on personnel records, and how promotions would be handled.\n\nSince taking on the role, Hegseth has ordered significant cuts to the top military ranks and has fired several leaders, including the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, a Black general, and the woman who was the Navy's top officer. On Tuesday, he said his reasoning for those firings was that “it’s nearly impossible to change a culture with the same people who helped create or even benefited from that culture.”\n\nBut the idea that the U.S. military isn't well-trained and highly effective “is almost disparaging to them,” said Richard Kohn, professor emeritus of history and peace, war and defense at the University of North Carolina.\n\n“They’ve been in combat, they’ve been adopting and adapting to very complex weapons systems.

Kevin Stitt tweeted a picture of a New York state commercial driver’s license his officers seized during an “enforcement action” on an interstate highway.\n\nThe name on this official state document, found on one of 125 illegal-immigrant drivers apprehended by the Oklahoma Highway Patrol: “No Name Given”. \n\nNo city or state suffered more on 9/11, but this single incident shows how even the Empire State has forgotten the lessons of that horrible day — and how New York’s solicitousness for illegal immigrants is setting America up for a tragic replay.\n\nAll but one of the 19 illegal aliens who carried out those attacks in 2001 had some type of US-issued identification document. \n\nAs Richard Barth, then-assistant secretary for policy development at the Department of Homeland Security, told the Senate in March 2007, the terrorists found it easy to fraudulently obtain driver’s licenses and state-issued IDs.\n\nTake Hani Hanjour, the Saudi national who hijacked American Airlines Flight 77 and flew it into the Pentagon that morning, killing 184 innocents. He had IDs from three different states. \n\nThose US-issued IDs, Barth noted, “enabled the hijackers to maneuver throughout the United States in order to plan and execute critical elements of their mission” — allowing them to “rent cars, travel, take flying lessons and board airplanes.”\n\n“The 9/11 hijackers evidently believed that holding driver’s licenses and ID cards would allow them to operate freely in our country,” he chillingly concluded. “And they were right.”\n\nThe bipartisan 9/11 Commission, tasked with investigating those attacks and making recommendations to ensure they could never be replicated, recognized that easy access to domestic IDs created an unacceptable vulnerability to our homeland. \n\nIn their final report, the commissioners advised the federal government to set stringent new standards for driver’s licenses.\n\n“Fraud in identification documents is no longer just a problem of theft,” they explained. \n\n“At many entry points to vulnerable facilities . . . sources of identification are the last opportunity to ensure that people are who they say they are and to check whether they are terrorists.”\n\nIn response, Congress passed the REAL ID Act of 2005. \n\nAmong other things, it established verification requirements states must follow in issuing licenses and other IDs that can be used for federal purposes — like boarding aircraft and entering federal buildings — and mandated that certain information appear on those documents.\n\nIncluding, at section 202(b)(1): “The person’s full legal name.” \n\nThe image Gov. Stitt tweeted shows a purportedly REAL ID-compliant New York state CDL, identifiable by the star in its upper right-hand corner. \n\nAnd yet, that document was issued to “No Name Given.” \n\nPerhaps the Given family decided to pull the cruelest possible prank on their newborn child and christened him “No Name.”\n\nMore likely, though, a New York Department of Motor Vehicles clerk issued what’s supposed to be among the most secure documents in our nation — an ID allowing the bearer to enter a nuclear facility — to an individual who failed to provide that most rudimentary identifier, a full legal name. \n\nWorse is the fact that this is not a simple ID, but rather a commercial driver’s license. \n\nThe 9/11 hijackers had to overpower flight crews and steer massive aircraft at high rates of speed to commit their attacks. \n\nThink of the carnage a malevolent trucker with the wrong cargo could wreak.\n\nThere’s a reason that semis on our highways are emblazoned with hazmat placards like “flammable gas,” “explosives” and “radioactive”: They warn other drivers to steer clear or risk calamity.\n\nBut what if calamity on a massive scale, impacting tens of thousands of our citizens, is the reason the driver is barreling down the highway? \n\nThat’s not a “bad commute” — it’s a national disaster. \n\nA goal of the REAL ID Act was to ensure only US citizens and legal immigrants could obtain compliant IDs. \n\nNew York, having decided it can ignore our immigration laws, has now apparently set its sights on bypassing other federal mandates, as well.\n\nUntil this issue is resolved, President Donald Trump would be within his rights to bar travelers from using New York state “REAL IDs” when attempting to board aircraft or enter federally protected facilities.\n\nThere’s no reason for “No Name Given” to have a REAL ID commercial driver’s license — and New Yorkers, of all people, should understand why.\n\nAndrew Arthur, the fellow in law and policy at the Center for Immigration Studies, drafted the Real ID Act of 2005.","summary":"The REAL ID Act is meant to ensure only US citizens and legal residents can obtain compliant IDs. New York has apparently set its sights on flouting it to benefit illegal immigrants.","url":"https://nypost.com/2025/09/30/opinion/illegal-immigrant-trucker-no-name-given-reveals-grave-danger/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/09/newspress-collage-u13067x5k-1759272277875.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&1759258095&w=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-09-30 23:39:34","author":"Andrew Arthur","authors":["Andrew Arthur"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"zm","sentiment":-0.105},{"id":365008026,"title":"White House Withdraws Pro-Crypto Brian Quintenz's Name From CFTC Chair Nomination","text":"The White House withdrew former Commodity Futures Trading Commissioner Brian Quintenz's nomination to run the agency late Tuesday, capping off a month-long fight over U.S. President Donald Trump's pick for agency chair.\n\nTrump tapped Quintenz shortly after retaking office. Quintenz joined venture firm Andresseen Horowitz's global head of policy, and has been an adviser to firms like prediction marketplace Kalshi since leaving the CFTC following his term as commissioner.\n\nIn a statement to CoinDesk, Quintenz said, \"Being nominated to chair the CFTC and going through the confirmation process was the honor of my life. I am grateful to the President for that opportunity and to the Senate Agriculture Committee for its consideration. I [am] looking forward to returning to my private sector endeavors during this exciting time for innovation in our country.\"\n\nPolitico and Punchbowl News earlier reported that the White House had withdrawn Quintenz's nomination.\n\nQuintenz has made statements in favor of the crypto industry since his first term as commissioner, including floating the idea of a self-regulatory organization for the industry similar to securities markets' Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA). Despite this, crypto exchange Gemini co-founders Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss — both of whom support Trump — opposed his nomination in late July, with Tyler telling CoinDesk that he did not believe Quintenz's views on developers and his work with Kalshi qualified him for the role.\n\nHowever, Quintenz released messages he had exchanged with the Winklevoss brothers earlier this month, suggesting that they really opposed his nomination because he would not commit to a public view on a CFTC enforcement action against Gemini. In his messages, Quintenz said that it would be better for a \"fully confirmed chair\" to review the CFTC's actions.\n\nCrypto lobbyist organizations and companies wrote a public letter supporting his nomination in a late August bid to put his nomination back on track.\n\nStill, the White House asked the Senate Agriculture Committee to postpone a vote on Quintenz's nomination a few times in July. Last week, Semafor reported that it had begun vetting new candidates to run the agency, which at present is helmed by Acting Chairman Caroline Pham. All of the other commissioners at the agency at the start of 2025 have since left, and Pham has indicated her intention to depart as well at some point, CoinDesk previously reported. \n\nThe CFTC's potential lack of a permanent chair comes as Congress considers legislation that would give the agency a more prominent role in regulating crypto spot markets, though the legislative process is likely to be delayed by a pending government shutdown. \n\nUPDATE (Sept. 30, 2025, 23:48 UTC): Adds additional context, clarifies that Quintenz joined a16z following his term as CFTC commissioner.","summary":"Gemini's co-founders Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss opposed Quintenz's nomination.","url":"https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2025/09/30/white-house-withdraws-brian-quintenz-s-name-from-cftc-chair-nomination","image":"https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/cff39550b58cdf0f7708d3970f3213095998c9af-1835x1032.jpg?auto=format","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-09-30 23:36:41","author":"Nikhilesh De","authors":["Nikhilesh De"],"language":"en","source_country":"in","sentiment":-0.267},{"id":365002116,"title":"Dems in hot seat after DHS warns their frontline workers will go without pay if shutdown hits","text":"As the federal government heads towards a potential shutdown starting on Wednesday, the Department of Homeland Security assures that immigration and border operations will continue, but said that those frontline workers could be going without pay.

Over 3,000 Nonprofits Sound Alarm on New Trump Directive","text":"More than 3,000 nonprofit organizations from across the country have signed onto an open letter first shared with Newsweek rebuking President Donald Trump’s directive targeting groups accused of supporting “organized political violence.”\n\nWhy It Matters\n\nThe White House last week issued NSPM-7, a missive titled “Countering Domestic Terrorism and Organized Political Violence,” which orders his administration to investigate groups it suspects promote political violence. Critics have raised concerns about whether the directive could be meant to chill the First Amendment’s guaranteed right to free speech as Trump has accused the left of provoking violence.\n\nWhat NSPM-7 Says\n\nUnder the order, the National Joint Terrorism Task Force (JTTF) shall “coordinate and supervise a comprehensive national strategy to investigate, prosecute, and disrupt entities and individuals engaged in acts of political violence and intimidation designed to suppress lawful political activity or obstruct the rule of law.”\n\nThe JTTF and its local offices would “investigate potential Federal crimes” relating to “recruiting or radicalizing persons” for political violence, terrorism, conspiracy against rights or the violent deprivation of a citizens’ rights.\n\nThe directive also said that institutional and individual funders, as well as offices and employees of organizations, deemed responsible for, sponsoring or aiding “principal actors engaging in the criminal conduct” can be investigated. Nongovernmental organizations and Americans abroad with “close ties to foreign governments, agents, citizens, foundations, or influence networks engaged in violations of the Foreign Agents Registration Act” could also be investigated.\n\nIt listed “common threads animating this violence conduct,” including anti-American, anti-capitalist and anti-Christian views. It also mentioned “support for the overthrow of the United States government,” “extremism” on gender, race and migration, and hostility toward individuals who hold “traditional American views on family, religion, and morality” in naming the “threads.”\n\nNonprofits Rebuke Trump Directive\n\nThe directive has sparked alarm from nonprofits and other critics of the administration, who believe it is a form of retribution against those who have funded left-wing groups like billionaire George Soros, who Trump said would be a “likely candidate” for investigation, according to The New York Times.\n\nMore than 3,000 nonprofit organizations from across the United States rejected the missive in an open letter provided to Newsweek.\n\nPresident Donald Trump attends a news conference in Aylesbury, England, on September 18.\n\n“We won’t mince words. No president–Democrat or Republican–should have the power to punish nonprofit organizations he disagrees with. That is not about protecting Americans or defending the public interest. It is about using unchecked power to silence opposition and voices he disagrees with,” the letter reads. “That is un-American and flies in the face of the Constitution, including the First Amendment bar on targeting organizations for their advocacy.”\n\nThey wrote that the organizations threatened by the directive “have a mission to serve the public good” and are “composed of everyday people fighting for dignity, safety, and opportunity.”\n\n“This attack on nonprofits is not happening in a vacuum, but as a part of a wholesale offensive against organizations and individuals that advocate for ideas or serve communities that the president finds objectionable, and that seek to enforce the rule of law against the federal government. Whether the target is a church, an environmental or good government group, a refugee assistance organization, university, a law firm, or a former or current government official, weaponizing the executive branch to punish their speech or their views is illegal and wrong,” the letter reads.\n\nLawyer Norm Eisen, co-founder of Democracy Defenders Fund—one of the groups represented in the letter—told Newsweek the letter shows that nonprofits are “standing strong” against the directive.\n\n“Over 3,700 of them are speaking out in a single voice to say nonprofits are an essential part of our country.

His latest album, “Debí Tirar Más Fotos,” became the first of 2025 to surpass 7 billion Spotify streams on Sunday.\n\nHe is known for proudly representing his home island of Puerto Rico in his music and his public platforms, where he shares the U.S. territory’s culture and the challenges that it faces. (Puerto Ricans are U.S. citizens.)\n\n“What I’m feeling goes beyond myself,” Bad Bunny said in a statement announcing his selection. “It’s for those who came before me and ran countless yards so I could come in and score a touchdown … this is for my people, my culture, and our history. Ve y dile a tu abuela, que seremos el HALFTIME SHOW DEL SUPER BOWL.”\n\nBad Bunny recently wrapped up a sold-out 31-show concert residency in San Juan, Puerto Rico, which drew hundreds of thousands of fans and is estimated to have generated more than $700 million for the island. Later this year, he will embark on a worldwide stadium tour that will include stops in Mexico, Japan, Australia and France.\n\nThe U.S. mainland was noticeably missing from his list of tour venues.\n\nHe said in a recent interview with i-D magazine that he was worried that U.S. mainland shows would have exposed his Latino fan base to U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement raids.\n\n“ICE could be outside. And it’s something that we were talking about and very concerned about,” he said in the interview.\n\nHe was already on shaky ground with Trump’s supporters.\n\nIn 2024, Bad Bunny offered his support for Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris, sharing a video of her plans for Puerto Rico on his Instagram – just moments after a speaker at Trump’s rally in New York City referred to the U.S. territory as a “floating island of garbage.”\n\nBad Bunny has been vocally critical of Trump. In 2017, hearrived at the Somos Livebenefitconcert, which was held to raise money for disaster relief, weeks after Hurricane Maria, wearing T-shirt that read: “¿Tu eres twitero o presidente?” (“Are you a tweeter or president?”) And he explicitly criticized Trump with vulgarities in a 2020 song.\n\nIn July, he took aim at Trump’s immigration policies in the music video for his song “NUEVAYol,” featuring a voice that sounds like Trump’s apologizing to immigrants.\n\n“I made a mistake,” the voice says. “… I want to say that this country is nothing without the immigrants. This country is nothing without Mexicans, Dominicans, Puerto Ricans, Colombians, Venezuelans, Cubans.”\n\nWhat are MAGA commentators saying?\n\nThe Super Bowl announcement triggered swift criticism from MAGA influencers, including several from the sports world.\n\n“No songs in English should not be allowed at one of America’s highest rated television events of the year,” Danica Patrick, a former professional racing driver and rising conservative pundit, wrote on X.\n\n“Do a little homework and it’s obvious that Bad Bunny is so much worse than most realize. Can you say, DEMONIC??” wrote Sage Steele, a former ESPN anchor and conservative speaker.\n\nTomi Lahren, a conservative commentator, reposted an AI-generated video of Bad Bunny saying he was never performing in the United States again because of ICE concerns and suggested sending Tom Homan, Trump’s border czar, to the Super Bowl.\n\nJack Posobiec, another right-wing commentator, suggested that Turning Point USA host a “counter-Superbowl halftime show” with rock band Creed. He blamed “Barack Obama’s best friend” Jay-Z for the selection of Bad Bunny as the headliner. Jay-Z’s company Roc Nation has a partnership with the NFL to produce the halftime show.\n\n“The NFL is self-destructing year after year,” Benny Johnson, a prominent podcaster, wrote on X.\n\nSome prominent Democrats responded to Johnson’s post. “Another MAGA Karen trying to censor popular artists,” wrote Sen. Ruben Gallego (D-Arizona).\n\nWhat has Trump said?\n\nTrump has not commented on Bad Bunny’s selection as the Super Bowl headliner, but that could change any minute.\n\nTrump has long had a tumultuous relationship with the NFL, predating his first term as president. As a businessman, Trump tried unsuccessfully on several occasions to become an owner of an NFL team.\n\nDuring his first term as president, Trump demanded that NFL owners fire or suspend players who kneel during the national anthem in protest and urged fans to boycott.\n\nThe league, which has long marketed itself as a bastion of patriotism, eventually created policies to keep protesting players in the locker room during the anthem.\n\nTrump’s relationship with the NFL has seemingly improved. Earlier this year, he became the first sitting U.S. president to attend the Super Bowl. In May, Trump announced that the 2027 NFL Draft will take place on the National Mall in Washington.","summary":"The Puerto Rican recording artist opposed Trump in 2024 and is not offering tour dates in the U.S. mainland to avoid exposing his fans to ICE raids.\n\n\nThe post Why Bad Bunny’s selection as the Super Bowl halftime headliner is sparking MAGA fury appeared first on Boston.com.","url":"https://www.boston.com/news/politics/2025/09/30/why-bad-bunnys-selection-as-the-super-bowl-halftime-headliner-is-sparking-maga-fury/","image":"https://bdc2020.o0bc.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Bunny-68dc66eb7188e-768x432.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-09-30 23:32:03","author":"Washington Post","authors":["Washington Post"],"language":"en","category":"entertainment","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.37},{"id":365011634,"title":"The Supreme Court’s newest decision could make it impossible to end the shutdown","text":"On Friday, the Supreme Court handed down an order that could completely upend the balance of power between Congress and President Donald Trump. The order effectively permits Trump to cancel $4 billion in foreign aid spending that he is required to spend under an act of Congress. \nTrump claims the power to “impound” funds, meaning that he will not spend money that has been appropriated by Congress. Until Trump’s second election, legal experts across the political spectrum agreed that impoundment is unconstitutional. Indeed, many doubted whether someone could even make an argument supporting impoundment. As future Chief Justice William Rehnquist wrote in a 1969 Justice Department memo, “it is in our view extremely difficult to formulate a constitutional theory to justify a refusal by the President to comply with a congressional directive to spend.”\nThe justices, however, appear to have voted entirely on partisan lines in Friday’s decision, in a case called Department of State v. AIDS Vaccine Advocacy Coalition. All three of the Democratic justices dissented, while none of the six Republicans publicly disagreed with the Court’s decision. (The Court did not reveal how each of the Republicans voted, so it is theoretically possible that one of them quietly dissented.)\nThe Court’s decision, moreover, is wrong. The justices in the majority explained why they voted to let Trump cancel this spending in a single sentence. While they did not actually rule that Trump acted lawfully, they determined that “the Government, at this early stage, has made a sufficient showing that the Impoundment Control Act precludes” this suit, seeking to restore the funds in question, from moving forward.\nBut, as Justice Elena Kagan writes in dissent, the Impoundment Control Act states that “‘nothing contained in this ActLee Jun Seong...shall be construed’ as ‘affecting in any way the claims or defenses of any party to litigation concerning any impoundment.’” In other words, the Impoundment Control Act states that it must not be read to cut off lawsuits challenging a president’s decision to cut off federal spending. So the justices in the majority read that law in a way that is explicitly forbidden by the law’s text.\nIn fairness, the Republican justices’ decision does include a line suggesting that they may revisit the question of whether Trump can unilaterally repeal a federal spending law in the future. But even if these justices eventually admit their error and reverse course, their initial decision is likely to cause an extraordinary amount of harm to the nation while it is in effect.\nThat’s because the AIDS Vaccine decision came right as the federal government was about to shut down. To reopen it, Congress will need to find the votes to enact a new spending law. And the Supreme Court just made that task exceedingly difficult, because Trump can’t be trusted to honor the terms of any deal that reopens the government if he can cancel federal spending that is part of that deal.\nWhy the AIDS Vaccine decision is bad news for anyone who wants the government to reopen\nThe timing of this decision could not have been worse — at least if you believe in continuity of government. At midnight on Wednesday, funding for much of the federal government will expire, which means that the US government is entering a shutdown. Trump has threatened to slash federal benefits and fire many government workers during this shutdown.\nAlthough Republicans control both houses of Congress and the White House, the Senate’s rules ordinarily require 60 votes to pass legislation — and Republicans only hold 53 seats in the Senate. Democrats proposed giving Republicans the additional votes to keep the government open in return for canceling looming cuts to Obamacare and Medicaid.\nThis sort of negotiation is very normal. Democrats and Republicans typically have different spending priorities, and they ordinarily reach some sort of compromise eventually that will allow them to fund the government.\nHistorically, however, these compromise agreements were possible because both parties could rely on the other to honor the agreement after it became law. But the Supreme Court’s decision in AIDS Vaccine suggests that, even if congressional Democrats and Republicans reach a deal where Democrats get some of the health care spending that they seek, Trump can simply cancel that spending after the bill ending the shutdown is signed into law. If he could cancel the foreign aid spending Congress authorized, as the Court just indicated he can, why couldn’t he cancel anything else the legislators agree to?\nThat implication of the justices’ decision means we may be in for a very long shutdown. Negotiating something as important and as complicated as the US federal budget is a difficult task under any circumstances. But it may be impossible when one of the parties cannot trust the other one to keep its side of any bargain.\nAlternatively, Republicans may change the Senate rules to allow the bill to pass by a simple majority vote. That would likely mean that the minority party would be cut out of all future budget negotiations, unless it controls at least one house of Congress. But both parties have historically included senators who are reluctant to allow legislation to pass by a simple majority. So it is unclear that Republicans have the votes to end the shutdown that way.\nThe United States, in other words, may now be entering a prolonged period of extraordinary dysfunction. And the Republican justices bear as much blame for that dysfunction as anyone.","summary":"On Friday, the Supreme Court handed down an order that could completely upend the balance of power between Congress and President Donald Trump.

As the article points out, over 700,000 folks have contributed to “yes on 50,” while virtually all the money in opposition has come from a single billionaire. The real headline-worthy ratio is 700,000-to-1.\n\nThe fact that billionaires continue to buy our democracy out from under us is itself a main reason to support Proposition 50.\n\nEl Sobrante\n\nBest result is pulling\nback from gerrymander\n\nRe: “Gerrymander ploy puts state GOP in a bind” (Page A6, Sept. 24).\n\nMichelle Cottle properly notes the collateral damage in the ongoing gerrymandering war set off by Donald Trump’s demand that Texas give him five more GOP congressional seats: the five Republican representatives endangered by California’s response.

Even Trump’s most loyal and subservient supporters are expendable in pursuit of his goals.\n\nMy ideal outcome of this redistricting war is for both the Texas and California legislatures to repeal their gerrymanders, and for the governors of the two states to meet in some neutral location — Las Vegas would seem appropriate — to sign the repeals.\n\nMerlin Dorfman\n\nEast Contra Costa\nneeds wider Highway 4\n\nHighway 4 is a vital road for many in East Contra Costa County, especially students and families who rely on it every day. Even though it was widened a few years ago, traffic remains a major problem.\n\nA 2023 U.S. Census Bureau survey found Brentwood residents have the longest average commute in the U.S., at 46 minutes per day. Many live in Brentwood, Pittsburg or Antioch because housing is more affordable, but this means long drives to work in Oakland or San Francisco.\n\nFor students, long commutes take away time for studying, resting and being with family. They also make it harder to pursue opportunities like internships or jobs further away.\n\nBrentwood has added more businesses, like Costco and medical offices, to create local jobs, which is a good step. But leaders must also improve Highway 4 and expand transportation options, like BART, to save time and strengthen our community.\n\nRamiro Espino\n\nReligious violence is\ndestroying country\n\nRe: “Shooter attacks, burns church” (Page A1, Sept. 29).\n\nMy heart aches for this Latter-day Saints community. Four lives lost, their sacred space destroyed.\n\nWhat troubles me is the pattern: Minneapolis in August, Lexington in July, now Grand Blanc. Houses of worship are becoming targets, revealing something deeply broken in our society.\n\nYes, Thomas Sanford bears responsibility, but religious hatred doesn’t spontaneously appear — it’s fueled by rhetoric that treats difference as a threat, by leaders who choose division over unity.\n\nAs faith communities, we must stand together. An attack on our Latter-day Saints neighbors is an attack on all who worship freely.\n\nThe question isn’t just “Who did this?” but “What are we becoming?” We honor these victims not through more blame, but by building the beloved community our scriptures call us toward — where religious difference is celebrated, not feared.\n\nMay their memories be a blessing. May their deaths not be in vain.\n\nLaurie Manning\nSan Leandro\n\nU.S. needs leaders who\nmeet issues positively\n\nIn the 1930s, our country was faced with extreme income inequality as was apparent in the Great Depression. Fascism had taken over major European countries, and a World War loomed. Josef Stalin had engineered a famine to suppress Ukrainian nationalism that killed over 3 million Ukrainians.\n\nToday, we are again seeing increased income inequality, which is highly visible in our homeless population. Fascism is on the rise around the world. And Vladimir Putin is trying to militarily obliterate the sovereign country of Ukraine.\n\nWithout attaching the label of political parties, I note that our president in the late 30s tried to bring hope and unity to our country through his “Fireside Chats.” The president today creates and adds to the divide that threatens the health of our country through his daily social media comments. We need leadership that can respond to these events in a way that better reflects the nation’s principles.\n\nTrump embarrasses\nself after UN mishaps\n\nDonald Trump has raged and called for investigations into the shutoff of the UN escalator after he boarded it, as well as the teleprompter, which failed to function for his address to the UN. He has the Secret Service investigating the incidents.\n\nThe UN has provided two responses. Stephane Dujarric, a spokesman for the UN Secretary-General, replied that a White House videographer may have been walking backward while filming and accidentally triggered a safety feature at the top of the escalator on the comb step, which is designed to stop the escalator to prevent a person or object from getting caught in the machinery. As for the nonfunctioning teleprompter, the UN has denied wrongdoing and pointed out that the U.S. delegation is responsible for operating its own teleprompter.\n\nI suppose that when you hire “only the best people,” you get snafus such as these and are left to blame others.","summary":"Also: Pulling back &#124; Widen Highway 4 &#124; Religious violence &#124; Positive leadership &#124; UN mishaps.

Figure skaters with cats on their heads, dog astronauts gobbling tennis balls, unusually agile horseback riders standing astride multiple animals — these were some of the snippets seen in its short video presentation.\n\nSure, the model still struggles with dialogue — notice that the scenes feature mostly voiceover when there are words at all. And slow down the videos to individual frames and you’ll see plenty of hallucinations. But OpenAI did enough shiny things Tuesday to make users take notice. The company will release — first by invite, and then presumably commercially — a tool that will let users prompt these videos into existence and share on their social feeds. Now instead of dunking on people with off the rack memes or shooting a quick video to troll our friends we’ll just prompt them into existence.\n\nRelated Stories\n\nDid Kimmel Cancellations Hit Disney+? There Might Be an Impact, But Don't Bet on Seeing It\n\nNew 'Simpsons' Movie Set for 2027 Release\n\n“Sora 2 can do things that are exceptionally difficult — and in some instances outright impossible — for prior video generation models: Olympic gymnastics routines, backflips on a paddleboard that accurately model the dynamics of buoyancy and rigidity, and triple axels while a cat holds on for dear life, “the company said in a statement.\n\nSo what will this mean for our content landscape? For Hollywood producers? For all of us entertainment consumers? The news also comes amid reports that the company will launch a Sora-powered social app and that Hollywood studios will need to opt out — read: request takedowns — of any video it finds distastefully close to its own protected IP. Taken together, these news developments seem to be hinting at a world of video we’ve been waiting on for a while now. The AI-ification of our TikTok feed is upon us.\n\nThe Hollywood Reporter’s senior tech editor Steven Zeitchik and senior features editor Julian Sancton sat down to make sense of what they saw.\n\nJulian Sancton: So how do you read today’s announcement? Does OpenAI, which has been having not-so-open talks with Hollywood about encouraging the use of their tools in traditional filmmaking, now give up that approach in favor of allowing the public to make 10-second clips? Or is this just a way to make some cash until the technology to make longer clips becomes viable?\n\nSteven Zeitchik: The $64,000 dollar question. Or I guess $500 billion question, given OpenAI’s valuation: Are they trying to be AI TikTok or do they still have hope of being next-gen Pixar? Of course, maybe we’re being too old-line in our thinking. Maybe there won’t be a next-gen Pixar — maybe that top down, elite producers-mass consumers binary, if OpenAI has its way, is a model of the past. Maybe what they’re really after is a world where studios are just sort of IP gatekeepers and we’re all creating within it.\n\nJS: It certainly seems like being AI TikTok is cheaper and more profitable! At least for OpenAI. And it’s a lot more attainable now.\n\nSZ: And so where does all this leave high-end Hollywood-type video? There are only so many hours in the day, and if these tools catch on we’ll be spending a lot more of them watching or creating our own slop-y videos instead of the professional kind. Studios and even influencers will feel the squeeze.\n\nJS: I would be very surprised if Hollywood allows this “opt-out” model to stand unchallenged. The studios, as you’ve noted before, would much prefer to control the memeification of their IP.\n\nSZ: Right, doesn’t this all work its way toward a deal? Like right now studios are fighting and OpenAI argues fair use and it’s very line-in-the-sand. But ultimately it seems to me it’s all about setting terms for negotiation. Sora 2 or Google Veo or whatever tool we use to create these videos will come with branded characters, and studios will get a cut of that. They’ll move more from a production model to a rights-management model. Which has kind of been happening anyway.\n\nJS: But do you think studios will really go for that? I do doubt that studios would be happy making movies without having to deal with actors and writers and crews.\n\nSZ: You think they’d prefer to deal with actors and crews?\n\nJS: I think for all their cutthroat tactics and greed, the execs did not necessarily get in this business just to make money. Scratch most of them and you’ll find a failed artist.\n\nSZ: The Matt Remick factor. I guess it comes down to how many of them there are — the quiet idealists in the C-suite. You think there are many. You’re much more of an optimist than I am.\n\nJS: Let’s not forget the studios are also still smarting from the strikes. So they don’t want to openly pursue these meme business models.\n\nSZ: Very smart point: the labor optics aren’t great if they’re making deals with these companies.\n\nJS: And the more AI is used for memes the more solid the unions’ leverage gets. The guild leaders can say “Is that the business you want to be in? Or do you want to be in business with us?\n\nSZ: That’s true. But the boards have a say here too. Pixar — not to pick on them — but Pixar takes on many billions of dollars of risk and many thousands of employees of overhead. OpenAI and SV will essentially be saying “Here’s a much shinier proposition we have for you, Hollywood — give us your stuff and we’ll make you Pixar money without having to build the thing or take flyers on 10-year development cycles.”\n\nJS: I should say I’m a little skeptical of what these tools can do. It’s still just prompting a model and seeing what you get, like a slot machine. That’s what they all are. And there’s also the consumer-appeal factor. ChatGPT’s great innovation was the simple user interface which I haven’t seen here yet.\n\nSZ: That’s true. But I think we both agree that today’s drop does make it easier for us to imagine a world, collectively and individually, where you don’t have to shoot a video to post it. Like it will seem like cheating for a second and of course also frustrating because of all the hallucinations and flying unicorns but it does seem like the road is getting dramatically shorter from where we’ve been to a place where we just speak/type a video and then share it\n\nJS: It’s notable that OpenAI is launching a wide ad campaign for Sora 2 and the app, including print ads. They want this to be the standard. It will make it easier for people to try their hand at it. What takes a little savvy now — the horribly offensive Chuck Schumer deep fake that Donald Trump re-Truthed — will be at anyone’s reach in no time.\n\nSZ: And then toss in the IP factor, assuming those deals are made and legal issues are worked out. I can troll you for not going to that party but instead of just words I can have Luke Skywalker do it. Fun for you, for me, and fun for Disney’s coffers!\n\nJS: It’s just so depressing to see how quickly these AI companies pivoted from this lofty talk of AI’s potential to change the world for the better to just pouring gasoline on the social media dumpster fire.\n\nSZ: You were hoping for AGI.\n\nJS: I’m just amazed by how tech history is repeating itself. It took about 10 years for technoutopianism to curdle into dangerous, brainrotting enshittification with social media. AI has achieved it in less than 3. I guess it does speed up progress! \n\nSZ: See you’re bleak too. You just garb it in a cloak of optimism. But you’re right of course. Sam Altman and OpenAI have been touting different forms of Artificial General Intelligence — a machine than can reason like a human – for years now. And we just keep getting souped up iterations of ChatGPT.

Like most shameless of them all, Robert Marx, who said that he was close to finding the greatest Spanish treasure ever lost, a life-sized solid gold statue of the Madonna and child. He never provided evidence that it was even made.\n\nSZ: So you’re saying Sam Altman is the Robert Marx of Silicon Valley.\n\nSZ: I guess it’s better than being the Richard Marx of Silicon Valley.

But with so much less room for risk, where is the next PTA coming from? That’s what worries me. The automation of production — as opposed to the digitization of distribution, which is what we had in the streaming era — feels like it will lead to so, so much more slop. Obviously there will be exceptions.\n\nJS: So PTA and Slop and little in-between?\n\nSZ: It would be a fitting mirror to the death of the middle class in our broader economy.\n\nJS: Quality inequality.\n\nSZ: At least there’s a phrase AI could never come up with.\n\nTHR Newsletters\n\nSign up for THR news straight to your inbox every day\n\nPodcast Industry\n\nPodcast Networks’ New Pitch: Hosts Are the Ultimate Influencers\n\nJimmy Kimmel\n\nProtest Disrupts First FCC Meeting Since Kimmel Suspension: “Fire Brendan Carr, Censorship Czar!”\n\nJimmy Kimmel\n\nDid Kimmel Cancellations Hit Disney+?

But Democrats voted against the continuing resolution, also called a CR, with Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer leading the charge to a shutdown. \n\nOnly Sens. Catherine Cortez Masto (D-Nev.), Angus King (I-Maine) and John Fetterman (D-Penn). joined the Republicans. Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) was the only Republican to oppose it. \n\nThe vote sets up a full-blown government shutdown, the third during Trump’s two presidencies and the first since 2018-2019, from 12:01 a.m. on Wednesday, October 1.\n\nThe vote came a day after a failed negotiation session on Monday.\n\nA key sticking point this time around has been healthcare with Democrats wanting to include an extension of expanded health care subsidies for the Affordable Care Act’s marketplace that expire at the end of the year. Republicans accuse Democrats of using that money to pay for healthcare that goes to undocumented immigrants.\n\nAnd a resolution appeared far off as tempers flared, increasing the odds of a shutdown by the hour, and inflamed by Trump’s rhetoric about Democrats. Late Monday, Trump posted a vulgar and racist deepfake AI video of House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries dressed in a Mexican serape and sombrero with big handlebar mustache as Schumer was depicted yelling obscenities and saying, “Nobody likes democrats anymore.”\n\n“It’s only the president who can do this. We know he runs the show here,” Schumer said Tuesday morning, after a bipartisan White House meeting the day before yielded little progress.\n\n“Republicans have until midnight tonight to get serious with us,” Schumer said. “But they’re lying because they know they're screwed if this debate turns into one about healthcare. And guess what? That's just what we're doing. We are making this debate a debate on healthcare.”\n\nSenate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., said Republicans “are not going to be held hostage\" by the Democrats' demands. The GOP-led House was on a weeklong recess, unavailable for immediate votes even if the Senate did find bipartisan agreement.\n\nThe shutdown fight has served as a test of Schumer and Jeffries’ leadership of the Democrats, as their rank-and-file members and base voters have increasingly lost faith in their ability to stand up to Trump.\n\nBut a shutdown also comes with significant risks as Trump threatened massive reductions in the federal workforce when speaking on Tuesday morning. \n\n“Now, with that being said, we can do things during the shutdown that are irreversible, that are bad for [Democrats] and irreversible by them, like cutting vast numbers of people out, cutting things that they like, cutting programs that they like,” Trump said late Tuesday afternoon from the White House.\n\nDemocrats have pointed to the fact that the Trump administration has significantly reduced the federal workforce already thanks to the Department of Government Efficiency, which Elon Musk ran in the first part of the year, and the work of Office of Management and Budget Director Russell Vought.\n\n“These workers are not bargaining chips,\" Sen. Mark Warner (D-Va.), who represents numerous federal employees, told The Independent. “If anything, they say that the Trump administration, Vought and the Department of Government Efficiency have cut the federal workforce to the bone, so this is an empty threat.”\n\nIt’s not entirely clear what an off-ramp would look like to end a government shutdown, as Republicans control both houses of Congress. House Speaker Mike Johnson sent the House home earlier this month after he passed the continuing resolution and has not brought the House back in session since then.\n\nBut Democrats are back in Washington and hope to apply maximum pressure. Still, they have yet to come up with a strategy. Sen. Ruben Gallego of Arizona — who on Tuesday called Trump “an idiot” — told The Independent that the off ramp would be people who benefit from the subsidies “getting to keep their health care.”\n\nGovernment shutdowns rarely have the desired effect of the party standing in the way of a continuing resolution or budget deal. In 2013, Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) famously shut down the government to defund the Affordable Care Act, which led to him delivering a pseudo-filibuster where he read Green Eggs & Ham by Dr. Seuss. That ultimately failed and it did not translate well when Cruz vied for the Republican nomination for president.\n\nIn 2018, Democrats failed to earn relief for undocumented immigrants brought to the United States as children when they shut down the government. \n\nThen later that year, Trump refused to negotiate with Democrats, saying, “I am proud to shut down the government for border security.” \n\nThat led to a 35-day shutdown, the longest in history, which caused his support to bleed. When the government re-opened in January 2019, Trump did not receive money for his proposed border wall with Mexico. \n\nBut Democrats think they have a chance to win over the public. \n\nCentrist Democratic pollster Blueprint put out a survey on Tuesday showing that 48 percent of voters would blame Trump and Republicans in Congress for a government shutdown. Only 33 percent of voters would blame Democrats. \n\nThe poll also showed that independents would blame the GOP by 21 points, with 50 percent of them blaming Republicans and only 35 percent blaming the Democrats.\n\nAt the same time, Senate Republicans pointed to polling from The New York Times and Siena College showing that 65 percent of respondents thought that “The Democrats should not shut down the government, even if their demands are not met.”","summary":"Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries get their caucus to hold fast against a continuing resolution written by Republicans","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/democrats-schumer-jeffries-government-shutdown-b2836865.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/09/30/20/57/GettyImages-2238377669.jpeg?width=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/rSIg45pi-4VHSaSK0.mp4","publish_date":"2025-09-30 23:27:21","author":"Eric Garcia","authors":["Eric Garcia"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.302},{"id":365013002,"title":"Schumer’s Bid To Shut Down Government Exposes Democratic Fissures","text":"Senate Democrats blocked a clean extension of government funding late Tuesday evening, but a handful of Democrats bucked Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer in an effort to avert a looming government shutdown. \n\nThree members of the Democratic caucus — Sens. John Fetterman of Pennsylvania, Catherine Cortez Masto of Nevada and Angus King of Maine — voted with Republicans to fund the government. The bipartisan spending bill still failed to clear the upper chamber’s 60-vote threshold during a vote of 55 to 45. (RELATED: Democrats Who Voted Against Funding Government Are Suddenly Hysterical About ‘Harm’ Shutdown Would Unleash)\n\nThe vote highlighted internal disagreement among Senate Democrats over whether to plunge the country into a government shutdown. The trio notably voted with Schumer to prevent a government funding lapse in March.\n\n“[I] cannot support a costly government shutdown that would hurt Nevada families and hand even more power to this reckless administration,” Cortez Masto said in part in a statement following the vote.\n\nRepublican Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul voted down the measure with Democrats, citing the funding measure’s failure to cut spending.\n\nPresident Donald Trump said Tuesday that he believes a shutdown is likely given Democrats’ refusal to back the seven-week stopgap measure to temporarily fund the government through Nov. 21.\n\nSenate Majority Leader John Thune attributed the Democratic caucus members backing the GOP spending bill as a prime example of intraparty dissent with Schumer’s intention to shut down the government.\n\n“I think that there is a recognition that the strategy that the Democrat leadership is employing here is the wrong one,” Thune said during a press conference following the vote. “We’re going to have some more votes, and we’ll see where the Democrats come down.”\n\nGovernment funding will lapse on Wednesday at 12:01 a.m. if the Senate does not approve the House-passed funding measure by the deadline. Top Democrats have thus far signaled they are willing to shut down the government if GOP lawmakers and Trump do not agree to their various demands.\n\nSchumer’s hardball tactics in the current funding fight are a stark departure from his decision to work with Republicans to fund the government in March. The move drew the ire of his fellow Democrats, exposed intraparty disagreement and sparked talk of a competitive primary challenge when he is up for reelection in 2028.\n\nA funding lapse could have far-reaching consequences across the federal government with the White House warning that critical nutrition assistance programs for low-income women and children will expire on Oct. 1. Congress has sent zero appropriations bills to Trump’s desk for the upcoming fiscal year, meaning that a shutdown would affect every agency.\n\nThe failed vote was marking the second time Schumer has led Democrats in skirting Republicans’ efforts to fund the government ahead of the Oct. 1 deadline.\n\nDemocrats filibustered the same House-passed bill on Sept. 19 immediately following its passage in the lower chamber largely along party lines. \n\nDemocrats’ $1.5 trillion counter-proposal that would undo cuts to foreign aid and public broadcasting as well as reverse GOP reforms to Medicaid also failed to get the requisite 60 votes to clear the upper chamber.\n\nSenate Republicans hounded Democrats on Tuesday over their hypocrisy on rejecting a short-term spending bill despite rubber-stamping 13 similar measures under former President Joe Biden.\n\nRepublicans have also highlighted Democrats’ previous opposition to shutting the government down over unrelated policy demands. \n\n“The Minority Leader once again refused to admit it is Democrats who are driving America into a shutdown. Let me remind everyone what Senator Schumer himself said in 2013,” Senate Majority Whip John Barrasso said on the Senate floor on Tuesday. “He said, ‘What if I persuaded my caucus to say, ‘I am going to shut the government down… unless I get my way?’ It’s a politics of idiocy. A shutdown is idiocy.'”\n\nStill, Schumer and the majority of his caucus are demanding Republicans agree to their policy concessions in exchange for keeping the government open.\n\n Democrats have been largely silent about how they plan to end a government shutdown if Republicans keep balking at their requests. \n\n“We also believe the fact that they wouldn’t negotiate with us, which became clear last week … the American people don’t like that,” Schumer said Tuesday during a Democratic leadership press conference. “So we think we’re on our front foot as we go into this fight.”\n\nAll content created by the Daily Caller News Foundation, an independent and nonpartisan newswire service, is available without charge to any legitimate news publisher that can provide a large audience.
