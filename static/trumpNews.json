Data released by global outplacement and business and executive coaching firm, Challenger, Gray, and Christmas Incorporated, shows that in just the first two months of this year, 221,812 Americans have lost their jobs. These job cuts are 33% higher than for the entire 12 months of 2024.\n\nJob cuts have been significant in the government, retail, technology, consumer goods, and financial ... [+] sectors.\nChallenger, Gray, and Christmas\n\nFebruary’s layoffs were the highest monthly job cuts level since July 2020, when factories and offices globally were being forced to shut because of the severity of the Covid pandemic. In recent decades, the only February that was worse for monthly job cuts, was February 2009, during the global financial crisis. “Private companies announced plans to shed thousands of jobs last month, particularly in Retail and Technology. With the impact of the Department of Government Efficiency [DOGE]\n\nactions, as well as canceled Government contracts, fear of trade wars, and bankruptcies, job cuts soared in February,“ said Andrew Challenger, Senior Vice President and workplace expert for Challenger, Gray & Christmas.\n\nOf significant concern is that jobs are being cut in every sector of the economy throughout the whole country. Daily government and private sector announcements show that job cuts will continue for the foreseeable future.\n\nGovernment Job Cuts\n\nPresident Donald Trump’s and Elon Musk’s slashing of federal jobs has led to record losses in the government sector. As of the end of February, 62,530 government workers were fired in comparison to 151 in 2024. The 62, 530 jobs cut represent 28% of all jobs cut in the first two months of 2025. The remaining job cuts are in the private sector and in education.\n\nMORE FOR YOU\n\nSpaceX Loses Contact With Starship As Videos Appear To Show Fiery Breakup\n\nNetflix’s Best New Show Nabs A Perfect 100% Critic Score, 94% Audience\n\nElon Musk Is Officially $121 Billion Poorer Than His Peak—As Tesla Stock Erases Most All Of Its Election Rally\n\nAt the time of this writing, Trump was preparing an Executive Order to dismantle the Department of Education; whether all employees will lose their jobs or whether some will be transferred to another part of government was not clear.\n\nBy far, the most significant job cuts have been in the government sector.\nChallenger, Gray, & Christmas\n\nPrivate Sector Cuts and Slowdown in Hiring\n\nWhile the media has rightly focused on the federal job cuts, those federal cuts, the whiplash effect of Trump’s tariff actions, and changes in technology, are all leading to significant losses in the private sector as well. Every time federal jobs are cut, those cuts lead to more job losses in the private sector given the significant number of accountants, consultant and auditors that provide services to every part of the government.\n\nAfter government sector cuts, the largest cuts are in the retail, technology, consumer goods, and financial sectors. In the first two months of this year, a total of 45,375 retail jobs were cut; this is a staggering 570% increase the 6,751 retail jobs cut in the same period in 2024.\n\nUncertainty about the direction of Trump’s policies and a decrease in consumer spending is also slowing down any new hiring. According to ADP, private sector employment in February only grew by 77,000 jobs, barely half of what the economist consensus had forecast. Private sector jobs in January had grown by 186,000.\n\nMost Job Cuts Are In The East\n\nJob cuts in the eastern part of the U.S. in the last two months are over 100% higher than they were in 2024, overwhelmingly because of the DOGE cuts. Job losses in the state of New York are already 50% of what the losses were in 2024, primarily due to job cuts in retail, technology, and financial service sectors.\n\nThe steepest cuts have been in the East, because of the federal government cuts.\nChallenger, Gray, and Christmas\n\nNo Respite In Sight\n\nUnfortunately, job cuts in the government, education, and private sectors will continue to increase. According to Forbes Contributor Chris Westfall, in just the first three days of March, almost 100 companies, big and small, announced upcoming layoffs. DOGE is also continuing to fire federal workers as well as independent financial regulatory professionals.\n\nFollow me on LinkedIn.

The contentious legislation has fuelled tensions in the ethnically-divided Balkan country. The complaint filed at the country's Constitutional Court jointly by Bosnian presidency member Denis Becirovic and two other officials argues that the laws passed a week ago by Bosnian Serb lawmakers violate Bosnia's constitution and a peace agreement that ended Bosnia's 1992-95 war.

The European Union said the laws “undermine the constitutional and legal order” of Bosnia, the functionality of its institutions and threaten fundamental freedoms of its citizens. Republika Srpska, the Serb-run part of Bosnia, must comply with Bosnia's laws and its constitution, the EU added. “The EU urges the political leadership of the Republika Srpska entity to refrain from and to renounce provocative, divisive rhetoric and actions, including questioning the sovereignty, unity and territorial integrity of Bosnia and Herzegovina,” said the statement.

The U.S. Embassy in Bosnia issued a statement saying it is deep concerned about the Bosnian Serb decree. \"The United States is resolute in advancing our interests in Bosnia and Herzegovina,\" the statement said. “For 30 years, our commitment to the Dayton Peace Agreement and a stable and secure Bosnia and Herzegovina has been unwavering.” Laws represent a coup, officials say Bosnian Serbs passed the legislation after a Bosnian court convicted Milorad Dodik, the pro-Russia president of the Serb-run entity in Bosnia called Republika Srpska. Dodik was sentenced last month in absentia to a year in prison and a six-year ban from public office for his separatist moves. Dodik, who is not in imminent danger of arrest, said he plans to ignore the verdict, which becomes official after an appeals process. Bosnia's officials say that the set of laws represent a coup and a major step in the disintegration of the country advocated by the Bosnian Serb separatist leader. Bosnia consists of two entities, one dominated by Bosnia's Serbs and the other run by the Bosniaks, who are mostly Muslim, and Croats. The Dayton peace accords that ended Bosnia's war, which killed more than 100,000 people, also envisaged that the entities are bound by joint state institutions, including the army, top judiciary and tax administration. Bosnia's rotating three-member presidency is made up of Bosniak, Serb and Croat members while an international envoy overseeing peace has the authority to change laws and impose decisions in Bosnia. Russian backing for Dodik Dodik was convicted for disobeying the decisions of High Representative Christian Schmidt that sought to curb Bosnian Serb pro-independence drive. He has repeatedly called for the separation of the Serb-run half of Bosnia to join with neighboring Serbia, which prompted the former U.S. administration to impose sanctions against him and his close allies. Dodik, a supporter of U.S. President Donald Trump, has had Russia's backing for his policies. Following a meeting with Serbia's President Aleksandar Vucic in Belgrade, Dodik on Thursday accused Bosniak officials in Sarajevo of seeking a conflict and wanting to abolish the Serb entity. “We are not the ones who want war and conflict,” insisted Dodik. Passing of the new laws has spurred fears of incidents between rival Serb and central Bosnian police forces. The war in Bosnia erupted when the country's Serbs rebelled against independence from the former Yugoslavia and moved to form a mini-state of their own with the aim of uniting it with Serbia.

As a result of the order, titled \"Defending Women from Gender Ideology Extremism and Restoring Biological Truth to the Federal Government,\" the NEA has asked grant applicants to certify that they will not use federal funds to \"promote gender ideology.\"\n\nIn an interview with NPR, ACLU lead counsel Vera Eidelman said the NEA's \"gender ideology\" prohibition is unconstitutional under the First and Fifth Amendments. She said it also violates the NEA's governing statute.\n\n\" This new prohibition runs directly counter to the point of the NEA, and to the point of art in general, which is to explore ideas, explore the diversity of human experience,\" Eidelman said. \"Forcing artists to be a mouthpiece for government views really runs counter to that.\"\n\n\"It is a cruel irony that we may now be ineligible for funding because our so-called 'gender ideology' is being targeted by the U.S. government,\" said Adam Odsess-Rubin, founding artistic director of the National Queer Theater, in an online statement. The New York-based company is seeking funding for its upcoming annual Criminal Queerness festival focusing on plays by dramatists who hail from countries with strong anti-LGBTQ+ laws. \"These new requirements threaten the expression of not just our organization, but artists around the world whose identities have been criminalized.\" The National Queer Theater was offered a grant for 2025 but the award is \"pending processing.\"\n\nThe NEA did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nThe agency has been the target of protests for imposing this and other restrictions falling under Trump's executive orders.\n\nIt recently had to dial back a different executive order-related rule asking grant applicants to certify that they, \"will not operate any programs promoting 'diversity, equity, and inclusion' (DEI) that violate any applicable Federal anti-discrimination laws, in accordance with Executive Order No. 14173\" after The National Association of Diversity Officers in Higher Education and other groups sued the Trump Administration last month and won. \n\nThe NEA was not involved in that lawsuit. But like many other federal agencies, it subsequently had to update its Assurance of Compliance. The arts agency now states that it \"is not currently requiring any grantee or contractor to make any 'certification' or other representation pursuant to Executive Order No. 14173.\" \n\nEidelman said her team has asked the court for an expedited hearing and to issue a preliminary injunction or a temporary restraining order.","summary":"The lawsuit pushes back against a recent executive order from President Donald Trump that asks funding applicants to agree not to promote \"gender ideology\" in their work.","url":"https://www.npr.org/2025/03/06/nx-s1-5320245/lawsuit-nea-gender-ideology-restrictions-trump-executive-order","image":"https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/1920x1281+0+0/resize/1920x1281!/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fb4%2F54%2F5529248a4e46baf23ba78fbebb05%2Fthumbnail-cqf-2024-pac-nyc.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-03-07 00:43:49","author":"Chloe Veltman","authors":["Chloe Veltman"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.007},{"id":297534148,"title":"Trump says he plans to visit Saudi Arabia soon","text":"WASHINGTON, March 7. /TASS/.

Kennedy Jr.‘s wife, regarding the recent death of an unvaccinated child in Texas due to a measles outbreak.\n\n “Hey Cheryl Hines, it’s Jack Schlossberg, I just got out of the shower,” he said in the video. “We’ve never met, but I’ve got a favor to ask. I need you to call up the family of the child who died of measles, and say sorry. Can you do that for me, babe?”\n\n He continued, “Almost every single case of measles is in someone who’s not vaccinated. I think you’re the perfect person to say sorry.”\n\n A rep for Hines declined to comment on Schlossberg’s remarks when contacted by The Hollywood Reporter.\n\n Schlossberg, who is late President John F. Kennedy’s grandson and an outspoken Democratic advocate, has previously criticized Kennedy Jr. for being vocal about his anti-vaccine perspective. Kennedy Jr. was also recently confirmed as President Donald Trump’s Secretary of Health and Human Services.\n\n Last week, the first U.S. death from measles since 2015 was confirmed by state officials in Texas when a child who wasn’t vaccinated died from the highly contagious — but preventable — respiratory disease, the Associated Press reported. The death was part of an ongoing outbreak in the state. And on Thursday, health officials in New Mexico announced that an unvaccinated adult who was infected with measles had died, though the cause of death has yet to be confirmed, ABC News reported.\n\n When asked about the measles outbreak last week, Kennedy Jr. was initially dismissive, calling it “not unusual.” However, he backtracked shortly after in an editorial published by Fox News on Sunday, saying the measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine “is crucial to avoiding potentially deadly disease.”\n\n As for Hines, while she has previously expressed disdain for Trump since his first term, she decided to stand by her husband when he dropped out of the 2024 presidential race and endorsed the now-president. She also hasn’t publicly shared her viewpoints on vaccines, though she told The Hollywood Reporter last year that she did receive the COVID-19 vaccine, unlike Kennedy Jr.\n\n “I did what I needed to do to work,” the Curb Your Enthusiasm actress said at the time. “If I wasn’t working, would things be different?

The journalist asked whether Prime Minister Narendra Modi could leverage his relationship with US President Donald Trump to resolve the Kashmir issue.“Removing Article 370 was the first step,” Jaishankar said, referring to the BJP government’s 2019 decision to revoke Jammu and Kashmir’s special status.“Restoring growth, economic activity and social justice in Kashmir was step number two.

Once that is done, I assure you, the Kashmir issue will be resolved,” the minister said.Chatham House chief executive Bronwen Maddox, who moderated the discussion, noted that several questions were being raised about Kashmir and human rights.Earlier, the UK’s House of Commons had conducted a debate titled “Government support for human rights in Jammu and Kashmir”, led by Labour MP Sarah Smith.Asked whether the Indian Government acknowledged any shortcomings in its human rights record, Jaishankar said India had been often targeted through politically motivated campaigns. “There can be situations which require redress and remedy,” he said, emphasising India’s human rights record stood stronger compared globally. “Any concern on human rights is really misplaced. I don’t see any justification for it,” he said.Jaishankar reiterated the importance of ensuring equal benefits for all Indian citizens, an argument he has previously used to defend the government’s human rights record.Reacting to Jaishankar's remarks, Jammu and Kashmir Chief Minister Omar Abdullah said the BJP-led government was never stopped from reclaiming PoK but questioned its stance on J&K’s land under Chinese occupation.Speaking in the J&K Assembly, Omar said, “The External Affairs Minister says they will take back PoK. Did we ever stop them? They criticise the Congress over Haji Pir Pass. During the Kargil War, they (NDA regime) had an opportunity to reclaim it back but couldn't. If they can do it now, they should.

Are sanctuary cities still standing in the way of the crackdown?\n\nHoman's typical response serves as something of a reality check for the president, whose campaign promise to deport millions of people is colliding with the practical difficulties of detaining immigrants and then transporting them across the globe.\n\n\"We need to increase the arrests,\" Homan said he has told Trump, recounting their conversations in an interview with The New York Times. \"They're not high enough.\"\n\nInside the administration, there is growing frustration about the pace of arrests and deportations, even as Trump mobilizes the full weight of the federal government behind his mission to carry out the largest deportation operation in U.S. history.\n\nHoman acknowledged he could not predict the number of people the administration would deport this year, citing financial shortfalls at Immigration and Customs Enforcement.\n\n\"The more money you have, the more successful we're going to be,\" he said. \"So people always ask me, 'How many you think you can arrest?' I say I have no idea.\"\n\nSo far, federal data shows that the administration has made nearly 23,000 arrests in the past month, up sharply compared with the Biden administration. But daily arrests have fallen since immigration agents exploded out of the gates in the opening days of Trump's term. And deportations have not kept pace with the number of arrests, which means that the number of people waiting in ICE detention has surged, straining resources.\n\nTrump has so far been happy with the progress in driving down the number of border crossings to historic lows, people familiar with his thinking say. But the pace of deportations has been a source of vexation in particular for Homan and Stephen Miller, the architect of the president's aggressive immigration policies, who know that the clock is ticking to make good on the president's plan.\n\nA Public Relations Blitz\n\nBipartisan frustration with immigration helped propel Trump back to the White House in November, and his advisers have made sure to promote his crackdown.\n\nTrump aides allowed Dr. Phil McGraw, the celebrity talk show host, to ride along during deportation raids in Chicago. The White House posted what it labeled an \"ASMR\" video of ICE agents preparing shackles while people were led onto a deportation flight. And the administration has enlisted agents from the FBI and other federal agencies to help detain people and send them off to Guantánamo Bay, Cuba, on military flights.\n\nKush Desai, a White House spokesperson, said in a statement that \"after four years of the Biden administration's outright incompetence, the Trump administration has re-established no-nonsense enforcement of the immigration laws of the United States.\"\n\nBut the immigration raids and roundups do not always go as planned.\n\nIn February, Homan stood before ICE agents with a television news crew on hand before a deportation operation targeting gang members in Aurora, Colorado. Trump said during the presidential campaign that Aurora had been taken over by throngs of criminals, even though officials there said his characterization was not based on reality.\n\nThe operation was a dud. Hundreds of agents in the town ended up arresting around 30 people, according to Homan. And it was not just Aurora. In San Diego, some FBI agents who were directed to assist ICE have grown frustrated over being redirected from their duties every day for the past month only to produce a handful of arrests, according to officials familiar with the matter. FBI agents also have been asked to help identify the locations of immigrants who are in the country illegally, officials say.\n\nAnd in the field office in Washington, D.C., FBI agents and analysts have expressed frustration about doing immigration work rather than pursuing threats to national security, including monitoring Russian intelligence officers operating in the United States, a former U.S. official familiar with the matter said.\n\nICE arrests in communities take up enormous time and resources. Officers spend weeks researching immigrants on their target lists, mapping out their locations and habits. Each target requires several officers and agents and often hours of waiting.\n\nIn recent years, immigrant rights activists have educated people that they do not, in fact, need to open the door to ICE officers. Instead, they can wait inside and ignore the requests. Homan has said the administration will seek more warrants signed by federal judges to be able to enter homes.\n\nICE would prefer to pick up immigrants in the country illegally from jails and prisons throughout the United States. But so-called sanctuary cities limit how much local law enforcement can cooperate with federal immigration agents, with the goal of ensuring that immigrant communities feel safe to talk to local law enforcement.\n\nDeporting immigrants can also present diplomatic challenges. The United States has struggled to secure enough planes and deportation agreements with other nations to efficiently return people to their home countries.\n\nRamping Up Arrests\n\nStill, the Trump administration is focused on raising the number of arrests.\n\nTo that end, Trump's advisers have shaken up ICE leadership. They are considering deporting people who have been found to have a legitimate fear of torture in their home countries to third nations, according to documents obtained by the Times. And Homan said the administration could also reinstate the practice of detaining immigrant families -- a tactic that has come under fire because of concerns that detaining children, even with their parents, can cause permanent developmental damage.\n\n\"We need family residential centers,\" Homan said, adding that the administration is considering reopening detention facilities in Dilley and Karnes City, Texas. \"It's an option. We got a lot of options on the table.\"\n\n(BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM.)\n\nTo address the shortage of detention beds, the administration is considering using military sites across the country -- an extraordinary use of wartime resources.\n\nThe Department of Homeland Security is also pushing the Internal Revenue Service to turn over the addresses of hundreds of thousands of people it wants to deport in a request that could violate taxpayer privacy laws.\n\nBut without substantial help from Congress, former ICE officials say, Trump's ambition for mass deportations is unlikely.\n\n\"Their hands are tied,\" said William Figueroa, who was an ICE deportation officer for 35 years. \"There's not enough agents and there's not enough opportunity to get these people.\"\n\nIt's not clear how much can be done legislatively. Even though Trump's party controls the House and Senate, Republicans have disagreed over the best strategy.\n\nFormer and current officials with the Department of Homeland Security say the pressure to ramp up arrests is palpable and that some worry that the administration's goals are out of line with reality. Others say a culture of fear has spread throughout the agency, with DHS even threatening to give employees lie-detector tests to crack down on leaks.\n\nRussell Hott, who was the leader of the deportation wing of ICE before he was reassigned last month, has acknowledged that the agency's rank and file was strained.\n\n\"I know it has been a trying time, professionally and personally, for many of you particularly those in the field,\" Hott said in an email informing agents that he was leaving his position. \"Fatigue and stress are inherent to our work, especially as operations have intensified.\"\n\n(END OPTIONAL TRIM.)\n\nTrump's advisers are now looking for additional groups of people to deport quickly.\n\nThe administration will soon revoke legal status for immigrants who enrolled in a Biden-era program that allowed migrants fleeing four troubled nations to remain in the country temporarily and legally, according to an official familiar with the matter. Immigrants in that program who did not apply for another form of protection would be subject to deportation.\n\n\"Trump's desire to increase the number of people locked up in detention is in deep contrast with the demands of local communities where immigrants are welcomed and valued,\" Marcela Hernandez, the organizing director at the advocacy organization Detention Watch Network, said in a statement this week. \"It is clear that Trump will use every opportunity to demonize migrants while also undermining what communities want and need. This moment demands a national outcry.\"\n\nIn a sign of the growing sense of urgency, the Trump administration is also considering measures with the hope that immigrants will simply decide to leave on their own. A multimillion-dollar advertising campaign by the Department of Homeland Security warns immigrants to leave the nation or else be \"hunted down.\"\n\nThis article originally appeared in The New York Times.","summary":"WASHINGTON -- Just about every week since taking office, President Donald Trump has called Thomas D.

The administration has purged the Pentagon of several senior officials, called for the end of birthright citizenship and attempted to shut down the U.S. Agency for International Development.

Earlier on Thursday, she spoke by telephone to Donald Trump, after which the United States president announced he was suspending tariffs on imports from Mexico until at least April 2.\n\nSheinbaum greeted reporters with a jovial “Buenos días” before walking to her lectern with a broad smile on her face.\n\n“We’re going to read the post of President Trump,” she said, referring to his announcement on social media that “Mexico will not be required to pay Tariffs on anything that falls under the USMCA Agreement.”\n\n‘We are getting results, President Trump’\n\nSheinbaum noted that she presented to Trump U.S. Customs and Border Protection data that showed that the quantity of fentanyl seized at the Mexico-U.S. border declined 41.5% to 263 kilograms in February compared to 450 kilograms the previous month. She said that Trump wasn’t aware of the statistic, and attributed it to the increase in fentanyl seizures in Mexico.\n\nSheinbaum said she also highlighted that her government has deployed 10,000 additional National Guard Troops to Mexico’s northern border as part of a deal in early February that staved off tariffs until March 4.\n\n“I also told him about the meeting in Washington with his security team and our security team, … where a series of cooperation and collaboration agreements were reached,” she said.\n\n“Then I told him, ‘We are getting results, President Trump,'” Sheinbaum said.\n\n“… ‘Now that you’ve implemented tariffs, how are we going to continue cooperating, collaborating, with something that harms the people of Mexico?'” she said, referring to tariffs, as she continued to recount her call with the U.S. president.\n\n“It wasn’t a threat, not at all, simply: ‘Understand that, for me, the most important thing is my people,'” Sheinbaum said.\n\n“… At the beginning, he stated ‘the tariffs are staying, and we’ll review it later’ … but I kept informing him about the many things we’ve done in Mexico in relation to security, even the decision the [federal government’s] Security Council took to send 29 prisoners to the United States,” she said, adding that she told Trump about other security results her government has achieved, including the arrests of thousands of suspected criminals.\n\n“And finally, he made the proposal to postpone everything until April 2, [with] a different review, the review of reciprocal tariffs,” Sheinbaum said.\n\nA ‘reciprocal relationship’ would be one in which ‘they don’t charge us tariffs either’\n\nSheinbaum highlighted that the vast majority of goods Mexico exports to the United States and imports from the U.S. are not subject to tariffs thanks to the USMCA trade pact, which superseded NAFTA in 2020. That statement was true until 12:01 a.m. Tuesday, when 25% U.S. tariffs on Mexican goods took effect.\n\nThe USMCA stipulates rules, including “rules of origin,” that products must comply with in order to travel across borders in North America without being subject to tariffs.\n\nThe trade agreement has allowed for free trade between Mexico, the United States and Canada for almost five years, but it didn’t stop Trump putting tariffs on Mexican and Canadian goods two days ago.\n\nSheinbaum emphasized that because Mexico doesn’t impose tariffs on imports from the United States, a “reciprocal relationship” would be one in which “they don’t charge us tariffs either.”\n\nIn that context, she expressed optimism that tariffs won’t be imposed on Mexican goods when the United States places reciprocal tariffs on imports from other countries next month.\n\n“In any case, we continue to work together,” Sheinbaum said.\n\n“In other words, the Mexico-United States-Canada trade agreement is respected.”\n\nAMLO’s good relationship with Trump a factor in tariff suspension, Sheinbaum says \n\nA reporter asked the president whether she believed that Trump, in deciding to suspend tariffs on Mexican goods, took into account the views of automakers that have plants in both Mexico and the United States.\n\n“It’s very probable that everything had an influence,” Sheinbaum said.\n\n“Remember the day that … [Trump] announced the tariffs, stock markets in the United States fell and there were a lot of United States businesspeople who said, “This isn’t good for us,'” she said.\n\n“They did their own work to speak with President Trump. Obviously, everything has an influence, and I believe the relationship of respect we’ve had [with the United States] also has an influence,” Sheinbaum said.\n\nShe said she believed that the “good relationship” Trump had with former president Andrés Manuel López Obrador was also a factor in the U.S. president’s decision to suspend tariffs on imports from Mexico.\n\nSheinbaum noted that López Obrador was “one of the few people in the world who said ‘this is bad'” when Twitter suspended Trump’s account after the United States Capitol Attack on January 6, 2021.\n\n“President Trump obviously remembers that, right? All that has an influence on the good relationship because he obviously knows that [AMLO and I] are part of the same movement and that we have always referred to him with respect,” she said.\n\n‘We favor trade with countries with which we have agreements’ \n\nAsked about the future of the USMCA and Mexico’s trade relationship with China, Sheinbaum noted that a review of the trilateral North American free trade pact is scheduled to take place in 2026.\n\nAs a result of “all these talks” between Mexico’s economy and finance ministers and the United States commerce and treasury secretaries, “it’s very probable” that “a lot of these things from this review will start to be seen now,” the president said, apparently indicating that changes to USMCA will be made before next year’s review.\n\n“What have we always said? We also have to carry out reviews of the trade agreements we have, due to our sovereignty and our self-sufficiency, and due to the strengthening of our economy,” Sheinbaum said.\n\n“But in the end, we favor trade with countries with which we have [trade] agreements. Remember, we don’t have a trade agreement with China, and we’re importing a lot of products from China,” she said.\n\nSheinbaum noted that the influx of Chinese goods to Mexico has had an adverse impact on manufacturing in the country. In that context, the government announced tariffs last December that targeted cheap Chinese clothing and textiles.\n\nLate last month, Sheinbaum said that imposing additional tariffs on imports from countries with which Mexico doesn’t have free trade agreements, such as China, was an option.\n\nShe said at the time that the implementation of tariffs on Chinese exports to Mexico wasn’t a “condition” that had been set by the United States, although Bloomberg had reported that “the Trump administration told Mexican officials” including Minister Ebrard “that they should put their own duties on Chinese imports as part of their efforts to avoid tariffs threatened by President Donald Trump.”\n\nLate last week, U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said that Mexico had proposed matching U.S. tariffs on China.\n\nSheinbaum said on Thursday that Mexico “has to review the tariffs” it currently has in place on imports from China, and stressed that her government wants to “recover” and “strengthen” Mexican industry.\n\n“Why? Because that provides employment, strengthens us, generates well-being, reduces violence,” she said.\n\nAs part of the ambitious Plan México economic initiative, the government is aiming to reduce reliance on imports from China and other Asian countries in order to protect Mexican manufacturing.\n\nTo achieve that goal, it appears almost certain that the Mexican government will move to implement tariffs — or higher tariffs — on Chinese goods.\n\nBy Mexico News Daily chief staff writer Peter Davies ([email protected])","summary":"A jovial President Sheinbaum celebrated her successful call Thursday with Donald Trump that she told reporters convinced him to pause U.S. tariffs on Mexico.\n\n\nThe post &#8216;We continue to work together&#8217;: Thursday&#8217;s mañanera recapped appeared first on Mexico News Daily","url":"https://mexiconewsdaily.com/politics/sheinbaum-tarrifs-paused/","image":"https://mexiconewsdaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/1022248_Mananera-Claudia-Sheinbaum_web-Graciela-Lopez-Cuartoscuro.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-03-07 00:20:49","author":"MND Staff","authors":["MND Staff"],"language":"en","source_country":"mx","sentiment":-0.234},{"id":297532936,"title":"Everyone Wants To Know About Trump’s Crypto Summit","text":"The Crypto Summit is viewed to be a key moment for the Crypto Industry.

Today I was on the Quantum Expedition X Space, and that was the topic of the day.\n\nOn March 7, 2025, the White House will host a groundbreaking Crypto Summit, bringing together government officials, regulators, and influential leaders from the crypto industry. This landmark event signifies the highest-level political support yet for cryptocurrency regulation and innovation in the United States.\n\nPresident Donald Trump will convene the summit, marking a notable shift toward proactive, collaborative policymaking in the crypto space. David Sacks, serving as the administration's Crypto Czar, is tasked with steering digital asset policy towards a more inclusive, innovation-driven direction.\n\nAlongside Sacks, key regulatory figures like Mark Uyeda, Acting Chair of the SEC, and Caroline Pham, Acting Chair of the CFTC, are expected to outline a framework that balances innovation with investor protection. Bo Hines, Executive Director of the Presidential Working Group on Digital Assets, will facilitate dialogue aimed at developing coherent policy strategies and actionable recommendations.\n\nCrypto has become a hot topic from CES to Davos and now with a special US Crypto Summit.\n\nMORE FOR YOU\n\nNetflix’s Best New Show Nabs A Perfect 100% Critic Score, 94% Audience\n\nElon Musk Is Officially $121 Billion Poorer Than His Peak—As Tesla Stock Erases Most All Of Its Election Rally\n\nToday’s NYT Mini Crossword Clues And Answers For Thursday, March 6th\n\nConfirmed Industry Attendees For The Crypto Summit\n\nConfirmed industry attendees include leading figures who collectively represent significant segments of the crypto ecosystem, offering diverse insights and advocating for their distinct interests. According to multiple reputable sources, including Reuters, CoinDesk, Economic Times and Bloomberg, these influential voices are:\n\nMichael Saylor, Co-Founder and Executive Chairman of MicroStrategy\n\nMatt Huang, Co-Founder of Paradigm\n\nCameron and Tyler Winklevoss, Co-Founders of Gemini\n\nBrad Garlinghouse, CEO of Ripple\n\nBrian Armstrong, CEO of Coinbase\n\nSergey Nazarov, Co-Founder of Chainlink\n\nVlad Tenev, CEO of Robinhood\n\nJ.P. Richardson, CEO of Exodus\n\nShayne Coplan, CEO of Polymarket\n\nKyle Samani, Co-Founder of Multicoin Capital\n\nZach Witkoff, Co-Founder of World Liberty Financial\n\nArjun Sethi, CEO of Kraken\n\nKris Marszalek, CEO of Crypto.com\n\nA representative from Consensys\n\nShayne Coplan, CEO of Polymarket, announces his invitation to the Crypto Summit on X.\n\nMain Agenda: Regulatory Clarity In the Crypto Summit\n\nThe summit's primary agenda aims at achieving critical milestones in U.S. cryptocurrency policy. Foremost among these is regulatory clarity—a decisive shift away from enforcement-driven approaches toward explicit guidelines.\n\nIndustry leaders attending the summit have long advocated for clearer regulatory frameworks that would provide stability and predictability, essential to fostering innovation and attracting investment.\n\nWith the SEC recently dropping high-profile lawsuits against major exchanges such as Kraken, Uniswap, and Coinbase, the administration has signaled its intent to create a more collaborative environment.\n\nCrypto Strategic Reserve Debate At The Crypto Summit\n\nAnother central focus of the summit is the proposal for establishing a U.S. Crypto Strategic Reserve. Participants will debate the composition of this reserve, notably whether it should include Bitcoin alone or incorporate a broader range of cryptocurrencies such as Ethereum, Solana, XRP, and Cardano.\n\nThe implications of such a reserve are profound, positioning the U.S. as an innovator and leader in global financial strategy, potentially reshaping geopolitical financial dynamics. Industry representatives like Michael Saylor are expected to strongly advocate for Bitcoin’s primary inclusion due to its widespread institutional acceptance, stability relative to other digital assets, and potential as a digital gold standard.\n\nRipple will be advocating for alternatives to BItcoin (Photo Illustration by Davide Bonaldo/SOPA ...

Proposals under consideration include significant tax advantages such as zero or substantially reduced capital gains taxes for long-term cryptocurrency holders.\n\nTaxes will be one of the discussion points for the Crypto Summit (Photo Illustration by Scott ... [+] Olson/Getty Images)\nGetty Images\n\nSuch measures, if enacted, could significantly reshape investment behaviors, positioning the United States as a highly attractive destination for crypto entrepreneurs, businesses, and investors globally.\n\nControversies and Debates Expected At The Crypto Summit\n\nDespite widespread optimism, several controversies and debates surround the summit. A major issue revolves around centralization versus decentralization, with critics voicing concern that increased government involvement could compromise cryptocurrency's foundational decentralized ethos.\n\nAdditionally, controversy has arisen from debates over the fairness and transparency in selecting which cryptocurrencies are included in the proposed strategic reserve, with particular attention to potential conflicts of interest within the Trump administration's connections to certain crypto projects.\n\nConcerns also exist regarding whether summit discussions will lead to tangible, actionable policy outcomes. Some skeptics worry that, despite high-profile attendance and dialogue, the practical impact might be limited without immediate legislative follow-up. These observers argue the summit might simply be a starting point rather than an endpoint for substantial policy developments.\n\nAn Inflection Point for U.S. Crypto Summit Policy\n\nNevertheless, the March 7th Crypto Summit represents a significant inflection point for the cryptocurrency industry in the U.S. The administration’s explicit embrace of digital assets as integral components of national economic strategy reflects a forward-looking vision. By directly engaging leading figures from the crypto industry, the White House seeks to leverage their insights and expertise to craft policies that clarify regulations and foster a supportive environment for innovation and growth. Ultimately, the Crypto Summit could decisively position the United States as a global leader in crypto innovation, setting a benchmark for other nations.\n\nFollow me on Twitter or LinkedIn.\nEditorial StandardsForbes Accolades","summary":"President Donald Trump will convene the Crypto Summit, marking a notable shift toward proactive, collaborative policymaking in the crypto space.","url":"https://www.forbes.com/sites/digital-assets/2025/03/06/everyone-wants-to-know-about-trumps-crypto-summit/","image":"https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/67695172c2a016a4f6b2c302/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-03-07 00:20:21","author":"Contributor,Davide Bonaldo,Sandy Carter","authors":["Contributor","Davide Bonaldo","Sandy Carter"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.484},{"id":297527612,"title":"New Generation of Civil Servants, and Their Skills, Are Forced Out of Government","text":"WASHINGTON -- About six months ago, Alex Brunet, a recent Northwestern University graduate, moved to Washington and started a new job at the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau as an honors paralegal. It was fitting for Brunet, 23, who said he had wanted to work in public service for as long as he could remember and help \"craft an economy that works better for everyone.\"\n\nBut about 15 minutes before he was going to head to dinner with his girlfriend on the night before Valentine's Day, an email landed in his inbox informing him that he would be terminated by the end of the day -- making him one of many young workers who have been caught up in the Trump administration's rapid wave of firings.\n\n\"It's discouraging to all of us,\" Brunet said. \"We've lost, for now at least, the opportunity to do something that matters.\"\n\nAmong the federal workers whose careers and lives have been upended in recent weeks are those who represent the next generation of civil servants and are now wrestling with whether they can even consider a future in public service.\n\nThe Trump administration's moves to reduce the size of the bureaucracy have had an outsize impact on these early career workers. Many of them were probationary employees who were in their roles for less than one or two years, and were among the first to be targeted for termination. The administration also ended the Presidential Management Fellows Program, a prestigious two-year training program for recent graduates interested in civil service, and canceled entry-level job offers.\n\nThe firings of young people across the government could have a long-term effect on the ability to replenish the bureaucracy with those who have cutting-edge skills and knowledge, experts warn. Donald F. Kettl, a former dean in the School of Public Policy at the University of Maryland, says that young workers bring skills \"the government needs\" in fields like information technology, medicine and environmental protection.\n\n\"What I am very afraid of is that we will lose an entire generation of younger workers who are either highly trained or would have been highly trained and equipped to help the government,\" Kettl said. \"The implications are huge.\"\n\nThe administration's downsizing could have a lasting impact, deterring young workers from joining the ranks of the federal government for years, Kettl said.\n\nAbout 34% of federal workers who have been in their roles for less than a year are under 30, according to data from the Office of Personnel Management. The largest single category of federal workers with less than a year of service are 25- to 29-year-olds.\n\nThe federal government already has an \"underlying problem\" recruiting and retaining young workers, said Max Stier, the president of the Partnership for Public Service. Only about 9% of the 2.3 million federal workers are under 30.\n\n\"They're going after what may be easiest to get rid of rather than what is actually going to make our government more efficient,\" Stier said.\n\nTrump administration officials and billionaire Elon Musk, whom the president has tasked with shrinking the federal government, have defended their efforts to cut the workforce.\n\n\"President Trump returned to Washington with a mandate from the American people to bring about unprecedented change in our federal government to uproot waste, fraud and abuse,\" Harrison Fields, a White House spokesperson, said in a statement.\n\nDonald Trump has vowed to make large-scale reductions to the workforce, swiftly pushing through drastic changes that have hit some roadblocks in court.\n\nLast week, a federal judge determined that directives sent to agencies by the Office of Personnel Management calling for probationary employees to be terminated were illegal, and the agency has since revised its guidance. Still, it is unclear how many workers could be reinstated.\n\nThe abrupt firings that have played out across the government so far came as a shock to young employees.\n\nThey described being sent curt messages about their terminations that cited claims about their performance they said were unjustified. There was a frantic scramble to download performance reviews and tax documents before they were locked out of systems. Some said they had to notify their direct supervisors themselves that they had just been fired.\n\n(BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM.)\n\nOn the morning of Feb. 17, Alexander Hymowitz sat down to check his email when he saw a message that arrived in his inbox at 9:45 p.m. the night before. An attached letter said that he had not yet finished his trial period and was being terminated from his position as a presidential management fellow at the Agriculture Department. It also said that the agency determined, based on his performance, that he had not demonstrated that his \"further employment at the agency would be in the public interest.\"\n\nHymowitz, 29, said he was dumbfounded. \"My initial thought was, obviously something is wrong,\" he said. \"How could I get terminated for performance when I've never had a performance review?\"\n\nHymowitz, who had worked on antitrust cases and investigations in the poultry and cattle markets for about six months, said he was not given many further instructions. The next day, he decided to walk into the office and drop off his work equipment. \"I just assumed that's what people do when they get fired,\" he said.\n\nAround 8 p.m. on Feb. 11, Nicole Cabañez, an honors attorney at the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, found out that she had been terminated after she realized she could not log into her work laptop. Cabañez, 30, worked in the agency's enforcement division for about four months, investigating companies that violated consumer financial laws.\n\n\"I was prepared to help make the world better,\" Cabañez said. \"It's honestly very disappointing that I never got that chance.\"\n\nDuring her first year at Yale Law School, Cabañez said she originally planned to work at a large law firm, where she would have defended companies and made a lucrative income after graduation. But she said she wanted to work in public service to help people get relief through the legal system.\n\nCabañez said she was now applying for jobs with nonprofits, public interest law firms and local governments. But she said she worried that the job market, especially in Washington, would be \"flooded with public servants.\" She said she could not file for unemployment benefits for three weeks because her agency had not sent her all of the necessary documents until recently.\n\n(END OPTIONAL TRIM.)\n\nThe impacts have stretched beyond Washington, reaching federal workers across the country, including in Republican-led states.\n\nAt 3:55 p.m. on Feb. 13, Ashlyn Naylor, a permanent seasonal technician for the U.S. Forest Service in Chatsworth, Georgia, received a call from one of her supervisors who informed her that she would be fired after working there for about nine months. Naylor said she initially wanted to stay at the agency for the rest of her career.\n\n\"It was where I have wanted to be for so long, and it was everything that I expected it to be from Day 1,\" Naylor said.\n\nNaylor, 24, said she felt a mixture of anger and disbelief. She said her performance evaluations showed she was an \"excellent worker,\" and she did not understand why she was fired. Although she said she was devastated to lose her job, which primarily involved clearing walking trails in the Chattahoochee-Oconee National Forest, she was not sure if she would return to the agency in the future.\n\n\"It would be really hard to trust the federal government if I were to go back,\" Naylor said. She said she was considering enrolling in trade school and possibly becoming a welder since she is still \"young enough\" to easily change her career.\n\nAlthough some said their experiences have discouraged them from pursuing jobs with the federal government again, some said they were intent on returning.\n\nJesus Murillo, 27, was fired on Valentine's Day after about a year and a half working as a presidential management fellow at the Department of Housing and Urban Development, where he helped manage billions of dollars in economic development grants. After standing in countless food bank lines and working in fields picking walnuts to help his family earn additional income growing up, Murillo said he wanted to work in public service to aid the lowest-income earners.\n\n\"I've put so much into this because I want to be a public leader to now figure out that my government tells me that my job is useless,\" Murillo said. \"I think that was just a smack in the face.\"\n\nStill, he said he would work for the federal government again.\n\n\"For us, it's not a partisan thing,\" Murillo said. \"We're there to carry out the mission, which is to be of service to the American public.\"\n\nThis article originally appeared in The New York Times.","summary":"WASHINGTON -- About six months ago, Alex Brunet, a recent Northwestern University graduate, moved to Washington and started a new job at the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau as an honors paralegal.

I completely agree with you on that,’ Newsom responds. ‘It is an issue of fairness. It’s deeply unfair.’\n\nKirk challenged him to call out the case of AB Hernandez, a high school trans athlete dominating women’s long jump and triple jump in California.\n\nNewsom avoided that case but said he agreed with Kirk’s overall stance that it was unfair for women to compete with an athlete born a man. \n\nBut he went on to say that it was important to ensure that vulnerable communities were protected.\n\n‘There’s also humility and grace … that these poor people are more likely to commit suicide, have anxiety and depression, and the way that people talk down to vulnerable communities is an issue that I have a hard time with as well,’ he said. \n\n‘So both things I can hold in my hand. How can we address this issue with the kind of decency that I think you know is inherent in you, but not always expressed on the issue?’\n\nNewsom is widely expected to run for president in 2028. And he has shown a willingness to engage with conservatives and appear on Fox News as he dissects the wreckage of Democrats’ 2024 election campaign.\n\nIn the first episode of his podcast he admitted that Democrats simply could not compete with the reach of Trump and Elon Musk right now. \n\n‘We’re toast,’ he said. \n\nHis new show is designed to bring him together with people on the opposing side. And he promised to interview architects of the MAGA movement.\n\n‘This is going to be anything but the ordinary politician podcast,’ he said. ‘I’m going to be talking to people directly that i disagree with, as well as people I look up to.’ \n\nBut supporters and even his own staff will be shocked at how much they agreed on an issue that was weaponized bu Donald Trump and his supporters to show how liberal Democrats had lost the plot.\n\nNewsom said that his friends had raised the issue of fairness in sport, and as a father of four, including two girls, he understood the problem \n\n‘Even my own friend cohort … people say: What the hell is going on, why aren’t you calling this out? When did this happen?’ he said.\n\nAsking questions about the fairness of transgender athletes should not be off limits, he said: ‘We have to own it.’ \n\nPublic opinion has hardened on the issue.\n\nA recent Pew Research Center survey found that two thirds of American adults favor or strongly favor laws require trans athletes to compete on teams that match their birth sex. \n\nOn Tuesday it provided Trump with one of his biggest applause lines when he announced he had signed an executive order to ban men from playing in women’s sports. \n\nDuring the closing weeks of the 2024 campaign, Democratic candidate Kamala Harris struggled to respond to her stance on transgender rights.\n\nNow, with Republicans in control of the White House and both chambers of Congress, party thinkers are trying to work out how to come back from Trump’s big win in the culture wars.\n\nNewsom discussed some of those big issues with Kirk, a firebrand activist and head of Turning Point USA who is known for his take-no-prisoners approach.\n\nHe is now a key figure in Trump Land, sitting in on crucial meetings at Mar-a-Lago while the incoming president built his administration at the end of last year.\n\nAt times he seemed to school Newsom, who admitted his 13-year-old son was a fan of Kirk’s during their back and forth on what happened in the 2024 election.\n\n‘I’s not just that this was like the Willie Horton ad of 2024 it wasn’t just like a Lee Atwater brilliance,’ he said referencing an ad designed to stoke racial fears or a legendary political strategist, ‘it’s that it reflected truth that the voters felt.’ \n\n‘I appreciate that ,’ said Newsom. \n\n‘Because voters felt as if their country was slipping away,’ continued Kirk. \n\n‘Now you have … the Democrats have a choice. You can say to those people, you’re racist, you’re Nazis, you’re fascist, You’re terrible. Or you can listen and be like, why is it that a steel worker in Pittsburgh who’s voted Democrat his entire life is voting for Trump despite all of .. you know … the stuff that’s been thrown at him?’\n\n‘It’s a pattern, and the trans thing is just one of those things.’\n\nNewsom also faces up to the challenge facing Democrats. \n\n‘We are losing. I feel it’s asymmetric, the asymmetry of Donald Trump and Elon Musk sending out tweets, or you doing social media … to me doing a three minute hit at three o’clock in the afternoon on CNN. I mean, how the hell would we compete?’ he asks.\n\n‘We’re toast.’","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nGavin Newsom, governor of uber-liberal California, broke ranks with fellow Democrats on&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Gavin Newsom disagrees with California liberals and criticizes transgender athletes competing in women&#8217;s sports during a discussion with Charlie Kirk: &#8216;It&#8217;s very unjust&#8217; first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/politics/gavin-newsom-disagrees-with-california-liberals-and-criticizes-transgender-athletes-competing-in-womens-sports-during-a-discussion-with-charlie-kirk-its-very-unjust/","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/03/06/02/95893961-14466989-image-a-37_1741227221356.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-03-07 00:17:07","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.226},{"id":297525288,"title":"Creator of AI Gaza video shared by Trump warns of possible dangers","text":"Solo Avital and his partner created an AI video satirising US President Donald Trump's proposal to \"take over\" the Gaza Strip. \n\nThe president would later share the video on his site Truth Social. \n\nIn an interview with BBC News, Avital highlights the dangers of AI's ability to create highly convincing fake content, which could have serious consequences.","url":"https://www.bbc.com/news/videos/cdrxkm6r856o","image":"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/05c0/live/add8c4d0-fad4-11ef-896e-d7e7fb1719a4.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-03-07 00:16:25","author":null,"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":0.243},{"id":297525290,"title":"Kyodo News Digest: March 7, 2025","text":"The following is the latest list of selected news summaries by Kyodo News.\n\nWASHINGTON - U.S. President Donald Trump on Thursday complained about what he perceives as the nonreciprocal nature of his country's decades-old security treaty with Japan.\n\nWhile speaking to reporters in the Oval Office, Trump suddenly touched on Japan. \"I love Japan. We have a great relationship with Japan, but we have an interesting deal with Japan that we have to protect them, but they don't have to protect us,\" he said.\n\nTrump pauses tariffs on imports from Canada, Mexico until April 2\n\nWASHINGTON - U.S. President Donald Trump on Thursday paused until April 2 his administration's tariffs on imports from Canada and Mexico that are covered by a North American free trade pact, the latest move in an unpredictable sequence that has been affecting companies and financial markets around the world.\n\nTrump's decision came only two days after his 25 percent tariffs on goods imported from the two countries took effect, and followed his talks earlier in the day with Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum.\n\nNissan may hold board meeting Tues. with CEO Uchida's fate in focus\n\nTOKYO - Nissan Motor Co. will hold a board meeting possibly on Tuesday to decide on its new management structure, a source close to the matter said Thursday, with attention growing on the fate of CEO Makoto Uchida following the collapse of merger talks with Honda Motor Co.\n\nThe board's decision will reflect the discussions held by Nissan's Nomination Committee, which is made up of five directors, four of whom are independent outside directors, and chaired by Andrew House, former president of Sony Interactive Entertainment Inc.\n\nTOKYO - A bullet train made an emergency stop near a station in Tokyo on Thursday after two cars decoupled, leading to a 3-hour suspension of bullet train services in eastern Japan and raising safety concerns as the incident was the second of its kind for the Tohoku Shinkansen Line in less than six months.\n\nThe disconnection involved the Hayabusa and Komachi high-speed trains on the shinkansen line that links Tokyo to northeastern Japan, similar to the previous decoupling in September. No one was injured in the incident.\n\nTOKYO - Seven & i Holdings Co. said Thursday it has appointed outside director Stephen Dacus as CEO, as it seeks to maximize its corporate value through a massive share buyback and restructuring under the new leadership, to fend off a takeover bid by a Canadian rival.\n\nDacus, a former CEO of the operator of rival retailer Seiyu Co. which was part of U.S. retail giant Walmart Inc., will replace Ryuichi Isaka to become the first non-Japanese CEO of Seven & i, subject to approval at its general shareholders' meeting on May 27.\n\nJapan affirms fighter jet cooperation with British foreign secretary\n\nTOKYO - Japanese Defense Minister Gen Nakatani and British Foreign Secretary David Lammy affirmed Thursday in Tokyo that the two nations will continue to collaborate on their trilateral project with Italy to develop a next-generation fighter jet by 2035.\n\nThe two also agreed to deepen bilateral cooperation as \"each other's closest partners in Asia and Europe\" and shared the view that the security of Europe and the Indo-Pacific region is \"inseparable,\" according to the Japanese Defense Ministry, apparently with Russia's invasion of Ukraine and China's growing military presence in mind.\n\nTOKYO - The Nakamise shopping arcade, a popular tourist attraction in Tokyo's Asakusa, is nearing the completion of its first roof replacement since the aftermath of World War II.\n\nThe work, part of which was open to the media Thursday, started in June of last year after roof leaks due to the deterioration of tiles in place since 1945, according to Caname Co., the firm handling the renovation.\n\nOSAKA - Six pitchers combined on another one-hit shutout as Japan routed the Netherlands 9-0 on Thursday to sweep a two-game exhibition series, allowing only two hits over 18 innings.\n\nManager Hirokazu Ibata picked a young team with next year's World Baseball Classic in mind and the players delivered back-to-back commanding wins at Kyocera Dome Osaka after prevailing 5-0 in Wednesday's opener.\n\nVideo: Evacuation order for northeast Japan wildfire may be partially lifted","summary":"Photo taken on March 6, 2025, shows the submarine Raigei following a ceremony marking its delive...","url":"https://english.kyodonews.net/news/2025/03/aef2b77753ad-kyodo-news-digest-march-7-2025.html","image":"https://img.kyodonews.net/english/public/images/posts/1eafeb412bce569447b3f62cbab26130/photo_l.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-03-07 00:16:19","author":null,"language":"en","source_country":"jp","sentiment":0.17},{"id":297527130,"title":"There is no reason that America should look like Europe, says Steve Forbes","text":"to top close Video This video is playing in picture-in-picture.\n\nThe Evening Edit March 06, 2025 05:02 \n\n There is no reason that America should look like Europe, says Steve Forbes \n Forbes Media chairman Steve Forbes discusses President Donald Trump pausing most of Mexico and Canada tariffs on ‘The Evening Edit.’\n Facebook Twitter Email Copy to clipboard Copy to clipboard \n\nTags WHAT TO WATCHSHOWSTHE EVENING EDIT | LATEST EPISODESTHE EVENING EDITV-VIDEOSPOLITICS","summary":"Forbes Media chairman Steve Forbes discusses President Donald Trump pausing most of Mexico and Canada tariffs on ‘The Evening Edit.’","url":"https://www.foxbusiness.com/video/6369698201112","image":"https://a57.foxnews.com/cf-images.us-east-1.prod.boltdns.net/v1/static/854081161001/8a4334c1-2e81-4cd3-83a7-bf1da7f81afe/874c93c4-60d5-40ca-ab53-2c8d8667b955/1280x720/match/1024/512/image.jpg?ve=1&tl=1","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-03-07 00:14:21","author":null,"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.153},{"id":297526896,"title":"European Union shows strong support for Volodymyr Zelenskyy following dispute with Donald Trump","text":"EU leaders on Thursday put on a show of solidarity with Volodymyr Zelenskyy at a summit designed as a riposte to the hostile treatment of the Ukrainian president by the Trump administration in the US.\n\nFive days after Zelenskyy was ejected from the White House following a clash that led to the US suspending military aid and intelligence support to Kyiv, he was promised “enduring” support by all but one of the bloc’s leaders.\n\nThey also pledged to increase their own defence capabilities in the face of an uncertain transatlantic bond.\n\nHungary’s pro-Russia premier Viktor Orbán refused to support the joint statement of support, forcing the other 26 leaders to issue a text without him.\n\n“Dear Volodymyr, we have been with you since day one,” said António Costa, European Council president, who chaired the leaders’ summit. “We continue to be with you now, and we will continue in the future.”\n\nThe split underscores the significant geopolitical shift created by Trump’s embrace of Russia. Zelenskyy, who joined the EU leaders for lunch, said afterwards: “It is very important that Ukrainians are not alone. We feel it and know it.”\n\nThe leaders, with the exception of Orbán, called for Kyiv and other European capitals to be involved in any negotiations about the future of Ukraine. Trump has opened bilateral peace talks with Russia that do not involve Kyiv or Brussels.\n\nHowever, the White House has appeared to soften its stance towards Ukraine in recent days. On Thursday, Trump’s special envoy Steve Witkoff said the administration was in talks to arrange a meeting with a Ukrainian delegation in Saudi Arabia to agree a framework for “a peace agreement and an initial ceasefire”.\n\nPete Hegseth, the US defence secretary, said that the US freeze on supplying weapons to Kyiv was a “pause, pending a true commitment to a path to peace”, adding that the White House was “very encouraged by the signs we’re seeing”.\n\n. The joint EU statement nods to increased military support for Ukraine and the readiness of states to “contribute to security guarantees based on their respective competences and capabilities” to a post-conflict state.\n\nOrbán has said that Trump’s stance on the war means the EU’s support for Ukraine needs to change.\n\n“It doesn’t matter in what form we state our support for Ukraine, just that we do,” said one diplomat involved in the talks. “At this particular juncture, it would be disastrous not to.”\n\nA separate statement, agreed by all 27 EU leaders, endorsed new defence funding initiatives proposed by the commission. These include changes to the bloc’s debt and deficit rules to exempt an increase in defence spending, and an instrument that would provide €150bn in loans to capitals to spend on military capabilities.\n\nBoth ideas were given broad political support, but the details of both are yet to be negotiated ahead of approval by governments.\n\n“Europe must become more sovereign, more responsible for its own defence and better equipped to act and deal autonomously with immediate and future challenges and threats with a 360° approach,” the 27 leaders said in the statement, which did not refer to the US.\n\nThe loan instrument, targeted at specific capabilities including air defence and drone systems, would be “as flexible as possible with as few strings attached”, one EU official said, to ensure fast adoption. It would use existing Nato criteria to ensure it was being correctly spent, they added.\n\nThe structure enables the commission to get around an EU treaty ban on direct military expenditure by instead boosting the European defence industry’s output. Some of that production could be used to arm Ukraine.\n\nAdditional reporting by Alice Hancock in Trowbridge","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nUnlock the White House Watch newsletter for free EU leaders on Thursday&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: European Union shows strong support for Volodymyr Zelenskyy following dispute with Donald Trump first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/business/european-union-shows-strong-support-for-volodymyr-zelenskyy-following-dispute-with-donald-trump/","image":"https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ft.com%2F__origami%2Fservice%2Fimage%2Fv2%2Fimages%2Fraw%2Fhttps%253A%252F%252Fd1e00ek4ebabms.cloudfront.net%252Fproduction%252Ff05bfc00-34f1-4946-9338-d600953941e0.jpg%3Fsource%3D","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-03-07 00:12:01","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0},{"id":297527620,"title":"Trump Administration Prepares to Revive and Expand Travel Bans","text":"WASHINGTON -- The Trump administration is finalizing a new ban on travel to the United States for citizens of certain countries that would be broader than the versions President Donald Trump issued in his first term, according to two officials familiar with the matter.\n\nA draft recommendation circulating inside the executive branch proposes a \"red\" list of countries whose citizens Trump could bar from entering the United States, said the officials, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the sensitive internal deliberations.\n\nOne of the officials said the proposed red list currently consists mainly of countries whose nationals were restricted under versions of Trump's previous travel ban.

On Wednesday morning, the group put out an emergency statement that urged Afghans with valid visas who are currently outside the United States to come back immediately.\n\nThe recommendations also have an \"orange\" group of countries whose access would be curtailed but not completely barred.

Trump, I am writing to inform you that your position as Special Counsel of the US Office of Special Counsel is terminated, effective immediately.’”\n\nDellinger argued that his firing was illegal because of a federal law indicating that special counsels can only be removed by the commander in chief “for inefficiency, neglect of duty, or malfeasance of office.”\n\nHe also pointed to DOGE chief Elon Musk’s initiative to layoff federal workers to claim he’s “needed now more than ever.”\n\nThe Trump administration countered that the removal protections shielding Dellinger were unconstitutional.","summary":"Hampton Dellinger ended his legal battle to stay on as head of the Office of Special Counsel one day after a panel of judges on the DC Circuit Court of Appeals ruled in favor of the Trump administration and lifted a lower court’s injunction which blocked the president from removing him from the independent agency. ","url":"https://nypost.com/2025/03/06/us-news/watchdog-agency-head-fired-by-trump-ends-fight-to-keep-his-job/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/03/99894827.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/i7Jqs09n-RyIcpnTz.mp4","publish_date":"2025-03-07 00:11:42","author":"Victor Nava","authors":["Victor Nava"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.531},{"id":297529270,"title":"\"Don't think I'm a criminal\": Crypto fraudster Sam Bankman-Fried maintains innocence from prison","text":"Convicted fraudster Sam Bankman-Fried shared his opinions on life behind bars in a new interview with former Fox News host Tucker Carlson.\n\nThe founder of the scammy cryptocurrency exchange FTX spoke to Carlson from the Metropolitan Detention Center in Brooklyn, New York.

I gave to Biden’s campaign, I was optimistic he’d be a sort of solid center-left president,” Bankman-Fried said, adding that he was “shocked… not in a good direction” by the Biden administration and its stances on crypto. “By late 2022, I was giving to Republicans privately as much as Democrats. That started becoming known right around FTX’s collapse, so that probably played a role.”\n\nSome of his biggest criticisms of the Biden administration, he says, centered on its heavy-handed crypto regulations and oversight plans. He told Carlson the crypto industry would “hopefully” be in better hands under the Donald Trump administration, one which has welcomed crypto titans with open arms.\n\n“You look at what the Trump administration said, you know, going into office. There are a lot of good things. There are a lot of things that, you know, were very different from the stance that the Biden administration took, that guys around the SEC took,” Bankman-Fried said.\n\nWatch the full interview below:\n\nwww.youtube.com/watch?v=dN1CR2dyfo8","summary":"The man behind FTX shared what its like to spend time with rapper-mogul Diddy in a Tucker Carlson interview","url":"https://www.salon.com/2025/03/06/dont-think-im-a-criminal-crypto-fraudster-sam-bankman-fried-maintains-innocence-from/","image":"https://mediaproxy.salon.com/width/1200/height/675/<?= https://media2.salon.com/2022/11/sam_bankman-fried_1237125010.jpg ?>","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-03-07 00:10:58","author":"Griffin Eckstein","authors":["Griffin Eckstein"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.15},{"id":297532080,"title":"Female athletes fire back at Nike's controversial Super Bowl ad: 'Ignoring the real problem'","text":"Nike debuted its first Super Bowl commercial in 27 years last month, and while a star-studded female lineup of athletes was involved, the ad received criticism for the company’s stance on supporting transgender athletes competing in women’s sports.

Powerlifter April Hutchinson, who was suspended from the Canadian Powerlifting Union for two years for speaking out against a trans athlete entering competitions in women’s categories, took exception to the part of Nike’s ad about flexing. \"I’ve never been told that I can’t flex or can’t do this or that,\" Hutchinson said.

I don’t think anyone is telling women in sports they can’t champion their sport,\" Liilii explained. \"Fake feminism,\" \"pretending to care about women\" and \"Nike is ignoring the real problem\" were lines used by other athletes in the video. The \"real problem\" is the main point of what XX-XY Athletics was getting across in its video response to Nike. \"Women can flex, be confident, be emotional, fill stadiums. And win. But what can’t they do? Speak. On one subject in particular: protecting women’s sports,\" an XX-XY Athletics press release said. \"’Just Do It’ – that’s your slogan, isn’t it Nike? Just do it. Stand up for women. It’s the easiest thing in the world to do,\" sports civil rights advocate Riley Gaines said, ending the video. When the Nike ad came out, Jennifer Sey, a former U.S. gymnast and founder/CEO of XX-XY Athletics, quickly called out Nike on X. \"You’re so full of it. The only thing female athletes are told they can’t do is stand up for the integrity of their sports, for keeping men out of women’s sports. Literally, that’s the only thing,\" Sey wrote in response to the commercial on X. Michele Tafoya, the veteran sports broadcaster and journalist, also took exception to it.

Musk attended Trump's first Cabinet meeting -- at times taking center stage.\n\nMusk ruffled feathers when he posted on X last month that all federal employees would receive an email demanding details of their work from the past week -- a move that caught some in the Trump administration off guard and caused widespread confusion, sources told ABC News. It created tension among members of Trump's Cabinet, as multiple agency heads told their employees to hold off on replying until they themselves were briefed on the situation.\n\nThrough DOGE, Musk has overseen cuts of thousands of federal government employees.

Last time, those countries included Cuba, Iran, Libya, North Korea, Somalia, Sudan, Syria, Venezuela and Yemen.\n\nThe draft tentatively proposes adding Afghanistan to the group whose citizens would be categorically barred from entering the United States, according to one of the officials.\n\nShawn VanDiver, the head of a nonprofit group that helps resettle Afghans who worked with U.S. forces during the war, said he learned from officials that Afghan citizens would be subject to a complete travel ban.\n\nOn Wednesday morning, the group put out an emergency statement titled \"Afghan Travel Ban coming\" that urged Afghans with valid visas who are currently outside the United States to come back immediately. Later Wednesday, Reuters also reported that Afghanistan would be recommended for a complete travel ban.\n\nThe recommendations also have an \"orange\" group of countries whose access would be curtailed but not completely barred. For example, only certain types of visas might be issued -- like for relatively affluent people traveling for business, but not immigrants or tourists -- and the length of visas could be shortened. Applicants would be required to have in-person interviews.\n\nCountries in a third or \"yellow\" category would be given 60 days to change some perceived deficiencies or they would be added to one of the two other lists, the officials said.\n\nThose issues could include failing to share with the United States information about incoming travelers, purportedly inadequate security practices for issuing passports, or the selling of citizenship to people from banned countries, as a loophole around the restrictions.\n\nIt is not clear whether people with existing visas would be exempted from the ban, or if those visas would be canceled. Many Afghans have been approved for resettlement in the United States as refugees or under special visas granted to people who assisted the United States during the war. It is also not clear whether green card holders, who are approved for permanent residency, would be affected.\n\nAbout 200,000 Afghans in their native country and 51,000 outside, half in Pakistan, are in the official pipeline to come to the United States, with tens of thousands ready to travel and with housing already arranged, said VanDiver, a Navy veteran who is president of AfghanEvac, the nonprofit group.\n\n\"This is the most vetted population that there has ever been,\" he said in an interview Thursday. \"It is crazy how much these people go through.\"\n\nHe added that many veterans of the war in Afghanistan who had voted for Trump now felt fury as word of a possible travel ban has spread. \"They're saying, 'This isn't what I voted for,'\" he said. \"The deal was you need to bring our wartime allies home. And they're just betraying these folks.\"\n\nIn one of the many executive orders he issued on Inauguration Day, Trump ordered the State Department to start identifying countries \"for which vetting and screening information is so deficient as to warrant a partial or full suspension on the admission of nationals from those countries.\"\n\nTrump gave the State Department 60 days to finish a report for the White House with such a list -- meaning it is due in about two weeks. He directed the Justice and Homeland Security departments and the Office of the Director of National Intelligence to work with the State Department on the project.\n\nThe State Department press office said in a statement that it was following Trump's executive order and was \"committed to protecting our nation and its citizens by upholding the highest standards of national security and public safety through our visa process,\" but it declined to comment on internal deliberations.\n\n(STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)\n\nThe State Department's Bureau of Consular Affairs was assigned to take the lead in coming up with a first draft, according to the people familiar with the matter, but the lists for each of the three categories are still in flux.\n\nIn addition to security specialists at the other departments and intelligence agencies, regional bureaus at the State Department and U.S. embassies around the world are reviewing the draft. They are providing comment about whether deficiencies identified in particular countries are accurate or whether there is a policy argument -- such as not risking disruption to cooperation on some other priority -- to reconsider including some.\n\nTrump's policy of categorically barring entry to citizens of certain countries traces back to his campaign call, in December 2015, for \"a total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States until our country's representatives can figure out what the hell is going on.\"\n\nAfter he took office in January 2017, Trump issued what became the first of an iterative series of bans. They initially focused on a set of Muslim-majority countries but later also encompassed other low-income and nonwhite countries, including in Africa.\n\nThe first travel ban caused chaos, in part because Trump issued it without warning. Some people learned that they had been barred from entry only after they arrived in the United States. Major protests were held at airports against the new administration.\n\nCourts blocked the government from enforcing the first two versions, but the Supreme Court eventually permitted a rewritten ban to take effect.\n\nWhen Joe Biden became president in January 2021, he rescinded Trump's travel bans as one of his first acts and returned to a system of individualized vetting for people from those countries.\n\nBiden's proclamation labeled the travel bans \"just plain wrong,\" calling them \"a stain on our national conscience\" and \"inconsistent with our long history of welcoming people of all faiths and no faith at all.\" The actions, Biden said, also \"undermined our national security\" by jeopardizing \"our global network of alliances and partnerships.\"\n\nIn his executive order in January setting in motion the restoration and expansion of travel bans, Trump said he was acting to protect American citizens \"from aliens who intend to commit terrorist attacks, threaten our national security, espouse hateful ideology or otherwise exploit the immigration laws for malevolent purposes.\"\n\nThis article originally appeared in The New York Times.","summary":"WASHINGTON -- The Trump administration is finalizing a new ban on travel to the United States for citizens of certain countries that would be broader than the versions President Donald Trump issued in his first term, according to two officials…","url":"https://www.berkshireeagle.com/nyt/trump-administration-prepares-to-revive-and-expand-travel-bans/article_e70e6700-48e1-5818-b025-c2718b49c619.html","image":"https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/berkshireeagle.com/content/tncms/custom/image/2b802cce-8455-11ec-8935-3f9640429655.jpg?resize=600%2C315","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-03-07 00:08:59","author":"Charlie Savage and Edward Wong,North Adams Pride","authors":["Charlie Savage and Edward Wong","North Adams Pride"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.114},{"id":297527976,"title":"LILLEY: Doug Ford pushes ahead on retaliation as Donald Trump blinks","text":"Like pulling booze, it’s a move that will get noticed.\n\nThe Kentucky Distillers Association, representing most of the bourbon makers in the U.S., issued a statement earlier this week saying the trade battle will have “far-reaching consequences.”\n\n“That means hardworking Americans – corn farmers, truckers, distillery workers, barrel makers, bartenders, servers and the communities and businesses built around Kentucky Bourbon will suffer,” the statement read.\n\nThe industry already suffered under a trade war with the European Union and England that ran from 2018 to 2022, and they are trying to rebuild.

But they come at a time of heightened concern in the Western world over Trump’s cozy relationship with Russian President Vladimir Putin, who has long seen NATO as a threat, and as the U.S. president seeks to pressure Ukraine into agreeing to a peace deal with the country that invaded it three years ago.\n\nDefense Secretary Pete Hegseth sent the alliance into upheaval last month when he said in a speech that the U.S. would not participate in any peacekeeping force in Ukraine, which is not a NATO member, and would not defend any country that participated in it if attacked by Russia.\n\nTrump said Thursday in the Oval Office that other countries would not come to the defense of the U.S. — though they have done exactly that, in the only instance that the Article 5 defense guarantee was invoked.\n\n“You know the biggest problem I have with NATO? I really, I mean, I know the guys very well. They’re friends of mine. But if the United States was in trouble, and we called them, we said, ‘We got a problem, France. We got a problem, couple of others I won’t mention. Do you think they’re going to come and protect us?’ They’re supposed to. I’m not so sure.”\n\nArticle 5 was invoked after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks, leading to NATO’s largest operation in Afghanistan. France’s military participated in the operation.\n\n“We are loyal and faithful allies,” French President Emmanuel Macron responded Thursday, expressing “respect and friendship” towards U.S. leaders.\n\n“I think we’re entitled to expect the same,” he said.\n\nMacron invoked “centuries-old history,” namechecking the Marquis de Lafayette, a 19-year-old French nobleman, who was a major-general in the American Continental Army during the Revolutionary War, and Gen. John Pershing, commander of the American army in France during World War I. Macron added that a few days ago, he met American World War II veterans who landed on Omaha Beach as part of the D-Day invasion of Nazi-occupied France.\n\nFrance and the U.S. “have always been there for each other,” Macron said.\n\nWhen asked Thursday if it he was making it U.S. policy that the U.S. would not defend NATO countries that don’t meet military spending targets, Trump said, “well, I think it’s common sense, right? If they don’t pay, I’m not going to defend them. No, I’m not going to defend them.”\n\nTrump has suggested since his 2016 presidential campaign that the U.S. under his leadership might not comply with the alliance’s mutual defense guarantees and would only defend countries that met targets to commit 2% of their gross domestic products on military spending.\n\nThe U.S. is the most powerful nation of the seven-decade alliance, has the largest economy among members and spends more on defense than any other member.\n\nThe U.S. was one of 12 nations that formed NATO following World War II to counter the threat posed by the Soviet Union to Western European during the Cold War. Its membership has since grown to 32 countries, and its bedrock mutual defense guarantee, known as Article 5, states that an attack on one member is considered an attack on all.\n\nTrump on Thursday also seemed to suggest the U.S. commitment to NATO might be leveraged in his trade war as he seeks to target what he says are unfair trade policies with other nations, including the European Union.\n\n“I view NATO as potentially good, but you’ve got to get, you’ve got to get some good thinking in NATO. It’s very unfair, what’s been happening,” Trump said. “Until I came along, we were paying close to 100% of NATO. So think of it, we’re paying 100% of their military, and they’re screwing us on trade.”\n\nOn Wednesday, Trump’s choice for NATO ambassador, Matt Whitaker, said at his confirmation hearing that in regards to the U.S. commitment to the NATO alliance and specifically Article 5, “It will be ironclad.”\n\nLast year, NATO’s Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg said a record 23 of NATO’s 32 member nations had hit the military alliance’s defense spending target.\n\nTrump has taken credit for countries meeting those targets because of his threats, and Stoltenberg himself has said Trump was responsible for getting other nations to increase their spending.\n\nAssociated Press writer Sylvie Corbet in Brussels contributed to this report.","summary":"Trump’s comments denigrating NATO are largely in line with his yearslong criticism of the alliance.","url":"https://www.ocregister.com/2025/03/06/trump-nato/","image":"https://www.ocregister.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Trump_Speech_60732_b6b3ab.jpg?w=1024&h=682","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-03-07 00:07:00","author":"Associated Press","authors":["Associated Press"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.173},{"id":297532000,"title":"Trump casts doubt on NATO solidarity, despite it aiding the US after Sept. 11","text":"By MICHELLE L.

PRICE\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump on Thursday expressed uncertainty that NATO would come to the U.S.’s defense if the country were attacked, though the alliance did just that after Sept. 11 — the only time in its history that the defense guarantee has been invoked.\n\nTrump also suggested that the U.S. might abandon its commitments to the alliance if member countries don’t meet defense spending targets, a day after his pick for NATO ambassador assured senators that the administration’s commitment to the military alliance was “ironclad.”\n\nTrump’s comments denigrating NATO, which was formed to counter Soviet aggression during the Cold War, are largely in line with his yearslong criticism of the alliance, which he has accused of not paying its fair share toward the cost of defense. But they come at a time of heightened concern in the Western world over Trump’s cozy relationship with Russian President Vladimir Putin, who has long seen NATO as a threat, and as the U.S. president seeks to pressure Ukraine into agreeing to a peace deal with the country that invaded it three years ago.\n\nDefense Secretary Pete Hegseth sent the alliance into upheaval last month when he said in a speech that the U.S. would not participate in any peacekeeping force in Ukraine, which is not a NATO member, and would not defend any country that participated in it if attacked by Russia.\n\nTrump said Thursday in the Oval Office that other countries would not come to the defense of the U.S. — though they have done exactly that, in the only instance that the Article 5 defense guarantee was invoked.\n\n“You know the biggest problem I have with NATO? I really, I mean, I know the guys very well. They’re friends of mine. But if the United States was in trouble, and we called them, we said, ‘We got a problem, France. We got a problem, couple of others I won’t mention. Do you think they’re going to come and protect us?’ They’re supposed to. I’m not so sure.”\n\nArticle 5 was invoked after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks, leading to NATO’s largest operation in Afghanistan.

The Trump administration has since announced a freeze on military aid and suspended intelligence-sharing with Ukraine -- decisions that could have dire consequences for Ukraine's war efforts.\n\nAmong the attendees in Brussels were President Zelensky, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, European Council President Antonio Costa and French President Emmanuel Macron, who in remarks on Wednesday said Russia is no longer just threatening Ukraine but is also potentially now a serious threat to Europe.\n\nThe 27 EU leaders signed off on a move to loosen budget restrictions so that willing EU countries can increase their military spending. They also urged the European Commission to seek new ways \"to facilitate significant defence spending\" at the national level in all member states, a statement said.\n\nThe EU's executive branch estimates that around 650 billion euros ($702 billion) could be freed up that way.\n\nThe leaders also took note of a commission offer of a loan package worth 150 billion euros ($162 billion) to buy new military equipment and invited EU headquarters staff \"to examine this proposal as a matter of urgency\".\n\nHungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban, a staunch supporter of Trump and considered to be Russian President Vladimir Putin's closest ally in Europe, refused to endorse part of the summit statement in favour of Ukraine.\n\nBut all 26 other EU leaders approved the bloc's stance that there can be no negotiations on Ukraine without Ukraine and that the Europeans must be involved in any talks involving their security. The Europeans have so far been sidelined in the US-led negotiations with Russia.\n\nOne of the primary outcomes of the summit is a renewed commitment from European leaders to boost their defence budgets.\n\nWith the war in Ukraine continuing and the EU seeking to rely less on US support, leaders discussed ways to enhance Europe's military capabilities. The European Commission proposed measures such as fiscal flexibility and even joint borrowing to help member states increase their defence spending.\n\nVon der Leyen warned that Ukraine -- and Europe as a whole -- have arrived at a \"watershed moment\".\n\n\"Europe faces a clear and present danger, and therefore, Europe has to be able to protect itself, to defend itself. We have to put Ukraine in a position to protect itself and to push for lasting and just peace,\" she said.\n\nHungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban also called for strengthening European nations' defence capabilities.\n\nAfter a meeting with Macron in France on Wednesday, Orban took to X and said: \"My meetings in France confirmed that while we may disagree on the modalities of peace, we do agree that we must strengthen the defence capabilities of European nations.\"\n\nLuxembourg's Prime Minister, Luc Frieden, reiterated the need for Europe to enhance its defence capabilities, saying it should happen even if some member states disagree.\n\n\"We need more European defence, and if one or two countries do not want to share that view, I think that the others should go ahead as much as they can. And that is what I am advocating for,\" Frieden said before the meeting in Brussels.\n\nZelensky has continued to receive firm backing from European leaders, who also discussed the expansion of military aid and potential security guarantees for Ukraine.\n\nZelensky thanked European leaders for their continued support, saying it meant Ukraine was not \"alone\" in its fight to repel Russia's invasion.\n\n\"It's very important you made a strong signal to the Ukrainian people,\" he said.\n\nOutgoing German Chancellor Olaf Scholz reiterated a rejection of any \"dictated peace\" in Ukraine as talks between Washington and Moscow fuel fears of an unfavourable settlement being imposed on Kyiv.\n\n\"It is very important that we make sure that Ukraine does not have to accept a dictated peace but that it is a just and fair peace that guarantees (Ukraine's) sovereignty and independence,\" Scholz said.\n\nAt least 20 countries, mostly European and Commonwealth nations, have expressed interest in joining a \"coalition of the willing\" proposed this week by the UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer to support Ukraine.\n\nStarmer said the UK, France and other nations would form this coalition to draw up plans to offer Ukraine support in the event of a peace deal to end Russia's war.\n\nCountries that have publicly indicated they would consider sending peacekeepers to enforce a deal include Australia, Ireland, Luxembourg, Belgium and Turkey, which has the second largest army in NATO after the US.\n\nA number of other countries have not ruled out sending soldiers, including Canada, Denmark and Sweden.\n\nWhile details remain under discussion, the message was clear: Europe remains united in supporting Kyiv in the face of Russia.\n\n\"Europe as a whole is truly capable of winning any military, financial, economic confrontation with Russia. We are simply stronger,\" Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk said.\n\n\"We just had to start believing in it. And today it seems to be happening.\"\n\nDuring the summit, Belgian Prime Minister Bart De Wever said his country expects to deliver F-16 fighter jets for battle in Ukraine in 2026. He said the promised delivery of the jets had been delayed because Belgium is awaiting delivery of new F-35s to replace them.\n\nFor its part, Sweden said it will send up to eight Gripen fighter jets to take part in a NATO mission to police the airspace of Poland, which borders Ukraine.\n\nThe move comes after Sweden suspended plans to send its domestically developed Gripen fighter jets to Ukraine last year.\n\nA particularly notable moment in the summit came from Macron, who proposed extending France's nuclear deterrence umbrella to other EU countries.\n\nSuch a move aims to strengthen Europe's defence position. However, it was met with mixed reactions. While some leaders welcomed the idea, others expressed concerns about nuclear policy complexities within the EU.\n\nPoland and the Baltic nations welcomed Macron's proposal.\n\nScholz expressed reservations, emphasising NATO's existing deterrence system and advocating for increased defence spending across Europe instead.\n\nAsked to comment on France's offer, Scholz said: \"What we have in terms of nuclear involvement, … I don't think that should be given up.\"\n\nDespite the strong support for ramping up defence capabilities, divisions remained over how to fund Europe's increased defence efforts. Some countries, including Hungary, have voiced scepticism about joint financing plans and proposed defence commitments.\n\nRussia, meanwhile, said it would not accept the presence of European peacekeepers in Ukraine, claiming that would signal direct NATO involvement in the war.\n\nThe Kremlin also strongly decried as \"extremely confrontational\" Macron's warning on Wednesday about what he called Russia's \"threat to Europe\" and the need for unity.\n\nHis speech indicated that France is thinking about \"continuing the war\", Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said.\n\nIn remarks on Wednesday to women who lost relatives in the war, Russian President Vladimir Putin said that his country should choose a peace in Ukraine that will ensure the long-term security of Russia and its sustainable development.\n\n\"We must choose for ourselves a peace option that will suit us and that will ensure peace for our country in the long term,\" Putin said.\n\n\"We don't need anything else, but we won't give up our own,\" he added.\n\nWhile the summit underscored Europe's determination to support Ukraine and boost its defence capabilities, it also revealed ongoing debates over funding and strategic direction.\n\nThe coming months will be vital as EU leaders work to move these discussions into concrete actions, ensuring Europe can sustain its role in supporting Ukraine while reinforcing its own security, experts said.\n\nSource: IANS","summary":"Brussels, March 7 (SocialNews.XYZ) European Union leaders have convened for an emergency summit in Brussels to address escalating security concerns after the suspension of US military aid to Ukraine.

remains unclear.\n\nSince then, the US has paused military aid and intelligence sharing with Ukraine.\n\nThe US president is “very encouraged by the signs we’re seeing” from Ukraine, Mr Hegseth said.\n\nSir Keir has been seeking to support Ukraine to keep countering Russian aggression while showing the US that the UK is committed to stepping up its defence efforts.\n\nOfficials from around 20 largely European and Commonwealth countries took part in talks on Wednesday about his “coalition of the willing”, it is understood.\n\nNot all the countries interested in the plan would necessarily provide troops to a peacekeeping force but they could potentially contribute in other ways.\n\nRussian foreign minister Sergei Lavrov said the move would amount to the “direct, official and unveiled involvement of Nato members in the war against Russia” and “it can’t be allowed”.\n\nThe UK has signed a deal worth nearly £30 million with an Anglo-American security firm to provide Ukraine with more advanced attack drones and the Chancellor has signed off a £2.26 billion loan to Ukraine financed with the profits of seized Russian assets.\n\nRachel Reeves said the Government will work with Ukraine for “as long as it takes”.\n\nShe said: “The world is changing and that’s why this Government is stepping up to take defence spending to 2.5% of GDP, funded by a reduction in the aid budget.\n\n“And we’ve just signed off the extraordinary revenue acceleration loan agreement, to be repaid by the profits on sovereign Russian assets, to unlock £2.26 billion additional for Ukraine to help them fight this war after Russia’s illegal invasion.”\n\nThe first third of the loan – a £752 million tranche – was sent to Ukraine on Thursday.\n\nMs Reeves visited RAF Northolt and met Armed Forces personnel and suppliers sending equipment to Ukraine’s military to mark the occasion.\n\n“Now more than ever in this changed world, Ukraine needs our support as a reliable partner to secure peace following Russia’s unprovoked invasion,” she said.\n\nEuropean leaders meanwhile backed new defence spending plans aimed at freeing up billions of euros as the bloc grapples with the prospect of Mr Trump reducing security assistance for Europe.\n\nThe 27 EU leaders signed off a move to loosen budget restrictions so that willing EU countries can increase their military spending, which could free up around 650 billion euros (£545 billion).","summary":"Sir Keir Starmer has been seeking to support Ukraine to keep countering Russian

Bankrupt Iran in 'Updated Sanctions' Policy","text":"U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent hinted at a major shift in policy towards Iran, saying the Trump administration aims to make the Mideast nation \"broke.\"Newsweek reached out to the State Department and the Treasury via email for comment.Why It MattersDuring his first administration, President Donald Trump took a hardline approach to Iran. He has remained a persistent critic of former President Joe Biden's Iran policy.Trump campaigned on aggressive financial reform across the government and using economic pressures and policies abroad to transform American foreign policy. He already has enacted and retracted tariffs against Colombia, Canada and Mexico and applied tariffs to Chinese products.The administration—and Bessent, in particular—has argued about economic security guarantees instead of military security guarantees. Bessent met with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to champion this concept.What To KnowBessent spoke at the Economic Club of New York on Thursday, first in a fireside chat with Fox Business host and former director of the National Economic Council Larry Kudlow, then taking questions from members.During the exchange, Bessent addressed some foreign policy, touching on tariffs but also adding a nugget about Iran: \"If I were an Iranian, I would get all my money out of the rial now.\"\"Making Iran broke again will mark the beginning of our updated sanctions policy,\" he added. \"Watch this space. If economic security is national security, the regime in Tehran will have neither.\"Trump enacted a \"maximum pressure\" campaign against Iran during his first administration, applying sanctions and enforcement mechanisms on those violating sanctions that helped drive down Iran's oil exports to near zero.However, Bessent warned that overreliance on sanctions could also prove detrimental, saying, \"President Trump expressed his view that overuse of sanctions could affect the U.S. dollar's supremacy.\"\"I couldn't agree more and would add that not unlike the overuse of antibiotics, the target becomes immune and mutates. Lackadaisical sanctions simply create new markets which then must be sanctioned and so on,\" Bessent added.Biden saw this firsthand as Iran's exports increased year over year, thanks to China ignoring sanctions and aiding Iran as it built a trading system using the Chinese yuan and a network of middlemen, avoiding exposure.What People Are SayingRepublican South Carolina Representative Joe Wilson, on X, formerly Twitter: \"Grateful that Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has stated that the USA will collapse Iran's economy by shutting down its oil industry. Can't happen soon enough!\"Republican Arkansas Senator Tom Cotton earlier this week: \"We need to ensure that Iran does not acquire nuclear weapons, and we must be ready to act if necessary.\"What Happens NextBessent did not clarify how the Trump administration would seek to hit Iran, but Trump has already rolled out sanctions against several nations. The administration is operating in the Middle East as it seeks to achieve several foreign policy goals.","summary":"President Trump has looked to resume the \"maximum pressure\" campaign against Iran he started during his first administration.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/treasury-secretary-us-bankrupt-iran-sanctions-2040963","image":"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2602156/treasury-secretary-scott-bessent-iran.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-03-07 00:01:10","author":"Peter Aitken","authors":["Peter Aitken"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.278},{"id":297524558,"title":"Evan Low — once the youngest openly gay mayor in the country — will now lead two key LGBTQ+ organizations","text":"Following his loss in the Congressional District 16 race last November, former Assemblymember Evan Low has found a new gig: serving as the president and CEO of the LGBTQ+ Victory Institute and the LGBTQ+ Victory Fund.\n\nLow, 41, who in 2009 was the youngest openly gay mayor in the country when he selected for the position while serving on the Campbell City Council, will lead the two organizations dedicated to training and electing the next generation of LGBTQ+ officials.\n\nLow’s appointment to the role comes as President Donald Trump has targeted transgender individuals through recent executive orders and some Democrats — like former Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg — have raised concerns about the Supreme Court overturning a 2015 landmark ruling that legalized same-sex marriage.\n\n“Today, we face an existential crisis,” Low said in a news release announcing his new job. “The LGBTQ+ community, along with other historically excluded communities, are being systematically legislated out of existence. I am committed to ensuring our voices are not just included, but impossible to ignore — and represented at the highest levels of office.”\n\nLow got involved in politics at a young age with his election to the Campbell City Council in 2006 when he was 23 years old. He served as mayor from 2009 to 2014 when he was elected to the California State Assembly.\n\nAs a state legislator, Low represented a district that represented Cupertino, Santa Clara, Sunnyvale and parts of north and west San Jose. He served as the chair of the California Legislative LGBTQ Caucus and in 2023, Low — along with State Sen. Scott Scott Weiner — introduced an amendment to enshrine same-sex marriage in the state’s constitution. Proposition 3, the subsequent 2024 ballot measure to repeal 2008’s Proposition 8, was overwhelming passed by voters.\n\nIn December 2023, Low jumped into a crowded field to replace U.S. Rep. Anna Eshoo in the House of Representatives. He tied former Santa Clara County Supervisor Joe Simitian for second in the primary, though a contentious recount knocked Simitian off the November ballot. Low lost the race to now U.S. Rep. Sam Liccardo, the former mayor of San Jose.\n\nLGBTQ+ Victory Action Board Chair Wade Rakes said in a news release that Low “will not only expand opportunities but also reinforce the positive influence of LGBTQ+ leaders across the U.S. and internationally. His expertise, experience and humanity will fortify Victory to build an even stronger, more inclusive future for all.”\n\nLow said that the Victory Fund and Victory Institute has “shaped (his) journey in public service.” In 2008, Low was a part of the Victory Institute’s David Bohnett Leaders Fellowship, which sent him to the Harvard Kennedy School’s Senior Executives in State and Local Government. Low later served on the Victory Institute’s board of directors.\n\n“As a twenty-year-old candidate, I experienced firsthand the power of our commitment to training and electing future leaders,” Low said. “Twenty years later, I am coming home to continue that mission — welcoming current and new supporters in our work to secure more seats at more tables and make our voices heard in more halls of power worldwide.”\n\nLow will succeed former Houston Mayor Annise Parker.","summary":"Low, 41, who in 2009 was the youngest openly gay mayor in the country when he selected for the position while serving on the Campbell City Council, will lead the two organizations dedicated to training and electing the next generation of LGBTQ+ officials.","url":"https://www.mercurynews.com/2025/03/06/evan-low-once-the-youngest-openly-gay-mayor-in-the-country-will-now-lead-two-key-lgbtq-organizations/","image":"https://www.mercurynews.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/SJM-L-FIRETECH-1114-4.jpg?w=1024&h=683","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-03-07 00:00:39","author":"Grace Hase","authors":["Grace Hase"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.241},{"id":297532078,"title":"300K NYC public school students didn’t show up to school last year, according to report","text":"A report highlighted in the New York Post says that 300,000 New York City public school students did not show up to school last year. \"Teachers' unions de-emphasized the importance of coming to school after COVID, which sent a signal to students that attending class was optional,\" Lindsey​​​​ Burke, director of the Center for Education Policy at The Heritage Foundation, told Fox News Digital in a statement. \"This continues to have devastating effects on student learning outcomes.\" The New York Post story reported that \"The number of K-12 students deemed chronically absent — or out for 10 days or more in the 180-day school year — has spiked from 26.5% in the 2018-19 term preceding the COVID-19 pandemic to 34.8% in 2023-24,\" according to a study they covered exclusively for The Manhattan Institute. TRUMP DRAFTING EXECUTIVE ORDER ABOLISHING DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION: REPORT Those numbers would suggest that over 300,000 of 900,000 students in the New York City Public School system were absent. Spending for students in New York school districts, however, has vastly increased. A January report by the Citizens Budget Commission found that \"New York’s school districts are set to spend $89 billion in the 2024-25 school year—$36,293 per student. Over the past four years, total spending per student has grown by 21.0 percent, or 4.9 percent annually.\" Even with the large increases in funding, proficiency levels for subjects including math and reading are also suffering. EDUCATION DEPARTMENT OFFERS STAFF $25K INCENTIVE TO QUIT BEFORE MONDAY DEADLINE The National Assessment of Educational Progress, or NAEP, found that last year, only 33% of NYC’s fourth grade students were proficient in math, compared with 23% in 2022 and 32% in 2019. Twenty-eight percent of the city’s fourth graders were proficient in reading. Twenty-three percent of eighth graders in the Big Apple were proficient in math and 29% were proficient in reading, with reading up slightly from 25% and 27% in 2022. Burke told Fox News Digital that the increase in spending coupled with the decrease in proficiency \"troubling.\" \"The fact that New York now spends $36,000 per student per year on K-12 education — a breathtaking amount of taxpayer money - makes chronic absenteeism that much more troubling,\" she said. \"New York is now spending $89 billion annually on public education — more than the GDP of Croatia — yet academic outcomes remain flat. Fewer than 3 in 10 eighth graders can read proficiently — a statistic that should keep New Yorkers up at night.\" She added that \"New York families would be far better served by the state giving them access to a portion of the $36,000 spent per year to pay to attend a school of choice. These new numbers add urgency to the need for universal school choice in NY.\" President Donald Trump, who campaigned on eliminating the Department of Education during the 2024 presidential election, is expected to issue an executive order calling on the new Secretary of Education, Linda McMahon, who was confirmed Monday as the 13th Secretary of Education, to begin the process of abolishing the department.

(On Wednesday, Trump granted a one-month exemption on imports from Mexico and Canada for U.S. automakers. On Thursday, he delayed imposition of most of the tariffs on Mexico for a month.) That is going to hurt the U.S. consumer with price increases on everything from car parts to toys and clothing.\n\nThe article on Page A1 on March 4 shows that economically, things are different in Trump’s second term, which will affect inflation more.\n\nI thought Trump campaigned on reducing grocery and gas prices, which the tariffs won’t help. Trump at least kept the Canadian energy tariff levy to 10% because of the cost to northern states.\n\nInterest rates may not be able to come down for a longer period in 2025, according to the article.

And after his election victory in November, he pointed to the market rise as a sign of optimism. But since his inauguration in January, Trump has been relatively muted about stocks, even after the S&P 500 reached a record high on Feb. 19.

Earlier this week, the US temporarily suspended military aid and intelligence-sharing with Ukraine in a bid to pressure President Volodymyr Zelenskyy into fast-tracked negotiations with Russia.Both decisions risk having disastrous consequences for the country on the battlefield.Zelenskyy, who attended the summit in person and expressed gratitude for the bloc's continued backing, has announced his team would meet with American officials next week in Saudi Arabia, the same country that previously hosted US-Russia talks.\"We're very thankful that we're not alone,\" Zelenskyy said on Thursday morning.Leaving the meeting, Orbán struck back against criticism.\"The isolation is relevant to the European union. The European Union has isolated itself from the US, isolated itself from China because of the trade war, and isolated itself from Russia because of the sanction policy,\" the Hungarian premier told reporters.\"So if someone is isolated here, it's the European Union. Hungary has good relations to all three directions, so we are not isolated at all.\"Orbán said boosting military and financial assistance for Ukraine was \"simply too much\" for the bloc because, he warned, the US would not \"be part of that in the future.\" Asked about his personal relationship with Zelenskyy, which has been characterised by tensions and public rows, Orbán said: \"He is the president of Ukraine, and I respect all the leaders of sovereign countries, so I respect him.\"Pressed if Zelenskyy was the \"right person\" to conduct negotiations, Orbán simply answered: \"You know, he's the leader of Ukraine.\"","summary":"\"We respect Hungary's position, but it's one of out 27. And 26 are more than one,\" António Costa said after an EU summit focused on Ukraine's future.","url":"https://www.euronews.com/my-europe/2025/03/07/hungary-is-isolated-antonio-costa-says-after-orban-blocks-joint-eu-text-on-ukraine","image":"https://static.euronews.com/articles/stories/09/09/85/78/1440x810_cmsv2_b8c818c6-5772-5f80-98c1-51dfdd6cc837-9098578.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-03-06 23:59:10","author":"Jorge Liboreiro","authors":["Jorge Liboreiro"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"fr","sentiment":-0.169}]}
