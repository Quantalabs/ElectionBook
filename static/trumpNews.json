Agents with ICE in Washington, D.C., arrested Hyrum Baquedano-Rodriguez, 26, in Fairfax, Virginia, on May 2, officials said in a news release. \"Though the court saw fit to drop his most recent charges, Hyrum Baquedano-Rodriguez has been convicted of numerous crimes in Virginia and represents a calamitous hazard to our Virginia residents,\" said ICE Enforcement and Removal Operations Washington, D.C., Field Office Director Russell Hott. Officials said his charges include abduction of a person with intent to defile and burglary, entering a house to murder, rape, etc. FAIRFAX COUNTY, VA., REPEATEDLY RELEASED HONDURAN CHARGED WITH SEX CRIMES, IGNORED ICE DETAINER REQUEST: FEDS \"Every one of his convictions represents another one of our neighbors that Baquedano-Rodriguez has victimized. ICE Washington D.C. will continue to prioritize public safety by arresting and removing criminal alien offenders from our Washington, D.C. and Virginia communities,\" Hott said. ICE officials said Baquedano-Rodriguez was first arrested by U.S. Border Patrol agents on Aug. 25, 2018, after he illegally entered the United States near Yuma, Arizona. Baquedano-Rodriguez was then released on an immigration bond by a DOJ immigration judge in Eloy, Arizona, on Jan. 22, 2019. Fairfax County police arrested Baquedano-Rodriguez on Nov. 9, 2021, and charged him with three counts of indecent liberties, including exposing genitals to child and indecent exposure. Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin said his administration's top priority is \"protecting Virginians.\" \"Protecting Virginians has been a top priority of our administration since day one, and it should be a priority for every leader at the federal, state and local level,\" Youngkin said. \"That’s exactly why the Virginia Homeland Security Task Force is so important. I’m grateful to our law enforcement officers at every level for working hard to keep Virginians and Americans safe, and I’ll always stand with them.\" ILLEGAL IMMIGRANT RELEASED BY BIDEN ADMIN PLEADS NOT GUILTY TO MURDER OF GEORGIA GRANDMOTHER Homeland Security also confirmed the arrest and said Baquedano-Rodriguez remains in ICE custody. \"MAKING AMERICA SAFE AGAIN: @ICEgov arrested Hyrum Baquedano-Rodriguez, an illegal alien, after a Fairfax County court dropped charges for abduction of a person with intent to defile and burglary. This child sexual predator will remain in ICE custody pending his removal,\" the department shared in a post on X. Officials said Baquedano-Rodriguez was convicted in September 2022 of entering property with intent to damage by a Fairfax County General District Court and sentenced to 18 months in prison and imposed restitution. Less than two weeks later, officials said the Fairfax County Juvenile and Domestic Relations Court convicted him of disorderly conduct and contributing to the delinquency of a minor, and he was sentenced to 12 months in prison for each conviction. Baquedano-Rodriguez was convicted again, officials said, in March 2023 of entering property with intent to damage by Fairfax County General District Court and sentenced to 12 months in prison. Then, in June 2024, officials said a DOJ immigration judge in Annandale, Virginia, ordered Baquedano-Rodriguez removed from the United States to Honduras. TWICE-ARRESTED HONDURAN ILLEGAL IMMIGRANT ACCUSED OF SEX CRIMES APPREHENDED A THIRD TIME On May 2, 2025, the Fairfax County Juvenile and Domestic Relations Court dismissed Baquedano-Rodriguez’s charges for abduction of a person with intent to defile and burglary: entering a house to murder, rape, etc. However, later that day, officers with ICE Washington D.C. arrested him in Fairfax, Virginia, and served him with a warrant of removal. Baquedano-Rodriguez remains in ICE custody. This was not the first time a Honduran national with a criminal background was released by Fairfax County officials. Last April, Fairfax County repeatedly released a Honduran national charged with sex crimes and ignored an ICE detainer request. Immigration officials arrested the 30-year-old Honduran national at his residence in Bladensburg, Maryland, on April 15, after Fairfax County twice released him.

They’re all made in China, by the way, practically all of them. They kill your birds and they ruin your beautiful landscapes.”\n\nAccording to the complaint, the move has stalled dozens of wind energy projects and forced at least one federally approved offshore development near New York to halt construction.\n\n“This administration is devastating one of our nation’s fastest-growing sources of clean, reliable, and affordable energy,” James said in a statement. “This arbitrary and unnecessary directive threatens the loss of thousands of good-paying jobs and billions in investments, and it is delaying our transition away from the fossil fuels that harm our health and our planet.”\n\nThe lawsuit contends that Trump’s directive violates the Administrative Procedure Act and exceeds presidential authority by imposing a blanket freeze without statutory justification or due process. The plaintiffs are seeking a preliminary injunction to immediately restart the permitting process while litigation proceeds.\n\nThe coalition said in a press release that the halt undermines states’ ability to meet clean energy mandates and rising electricity demands.\n\nNew York, for instance, is legally required to generate 70 percent of its electricity from renewables by 2030 and 100 percent by 2040 under its Climate Law, they noted, adding that the state’s wind sector currently supports over 4,400 jobs and is projected to create 18,000 more in the next decade.\n\n“Those jobs will not materialize if these projects are halted,” James and the co-plaintiffs stated in the press release. “The administration’s indefinite blockade could leave billions of dollars in states’ clean energy investments stranded or underutilized and significantly harm their economic development.”\n\nBesides New York, the other plaintiffs in the case are attorneys general from Arizona, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, New Jersey, New Mexico, Oregon, Rhode Island, Washington, and the District of Columbia.\n\nThe White House dismissed the lawsuit as a politically motivated effort to block the president’s agenda to reassert “America’s energy dominance.”\n\n“Instead of working with President Trump to unleash American energy and lower prices for American families, Democrat Attorneys General are using lawfare to stop the President’s popular energy agenda,“ Taylor Rogers, White House assistant press secretary, told The Epoch Times in an emailed statement. ”The American people voted for the President to restore America’s energy dominance, and Americans in blue states should not have to pay the price of the Democrats’ radical climate agenda.”\n\nTrump’s Jan. 20 directive also ordered a government-wide review of all existing wind leases, including the condition and safety of idle turbines, and instructed federal agencies to evaluate whether defunct projects should be dismantled. It was issued alongside a series of executive actions aimed at fast-tracking domestic oil, gas, and mineral extraction and repealing Biden-era climate regulations.","summary":"The coalition seeks a

during US and China trade war chaos","text":"Australian mining companies are walking a tightrope between China, the nation's biggest market for our resources, and the United States, our greatest ally.\n\nThe trade war between them could open up some big opportunities but there is also a risk that Australian companies could get caught in the crossfire.\n\nChina has banned exports of some rare earths and critical minerals to the US, a move that threatens high-tech industries there.\n\nIn August, the Chinese government embargoed the supply of gallium to the US.\n\nGallium is a key component in thermometers, semiconductors, LED screens, smartphones, and Blu-ray technology.\n\nThey also banned germanium, which is used in space tech, renewables and telecommunications; antimony used in bullets and other weapons; and graphite used in electric vehicle batteries.\n\nUS Critical Minerals executive director Harvey Kaye said the embargo has become a geopolitical issue.\n\nUS on fast track\n\nIn response, US President Donald Trump has issued a raft of executive orders to cut red tape, speed up mining approvals, and wants to fund projects by creating a new sovereign wealth fund.\n\nUS Critical Minerals is one of those companies listed for fast-tracking, according to Mr Kaye.\n\n\"We have ability through small mining exemptions, categoric exemptions, and the Defence Production Act to fast-track something that would have taken a few years [to get approval] down to 12-14 months,\" Mr Kaye said.\n\nHe thinks US government money could flow into processing projects in Australia.\n\n\"We're in direct conversation as we speak with the [Export-Import] bank … to encourage trade both ways,\" he said.\n\nAustralian miners vulnerable\n\nMining generates more than $450 billion in export revenue for Australia, with most of that from iron ore and coal, according to the Minerals Council of Australia.\n\nCritical mineral exports are estimated to be worth just $7.6 billion this financial year according to the March Resources and Energy Quarterly  Report from the Department of Industry Science and Resources but that could still increase significantly according to Professor Vlado Vivoda, the director of the Strategic Minerals Advisory and Research consultancy and a professor at the University of Queensland.\n\nAustralia is also the number one processor of lithium globally, although the price has fallen to its lowest level in four years.\n\nProfessor Vivoda said China has used its market dominance as a processor of critical minerals and rare earths to kill off competition from other countries, which is exactly what it did recently to Australia's nickel and lithium industries. \n\n\"They flooded the market with cheap Indonesian nickel, that's produced under not best practice … and a lot of our producers in Western Australia had to put mines into care and maintenance,\" he said.\n\nHe said the sector needs protection.\n\nHe said the relationship with China has a chequered past. \n\n\"China has been the backbone of the Australian economy for a lot of lot of years, but … there have been certain frictions in that relationship,\" he said.\n\nChina banned key Australian commodities during the previous Liberal government including coal, barley, seafood, wine and beef.\n\nAll of those bans have since been lifted with China recently granting 10 new red meat companies access to the Chinese market and approving new protocols to allow Australian apples to go to China in increasing volumes.\n\nGovernment policies\n\nCritical minerals are a priority for the re-elected Labor party, which has provided tax breaks for miners and promised to set up a federal reserve of critical minerals. \n\nIt would offer voluntary agreements to miners to buy some of their output, and create a national stockpile of the minerals, effectively underwriting mines by guaranteeing some demand.\n\nProfessor Vivoda thinks that's a good idea.\n\nThe Minerals Council of Australia is less sure.\n\nThe council's northern Australia executive director Cathryn Tilmouth said the policy could impact the commercial viability of Australian operations.\n\nShe said miners would need support to deliver those minerals to a reserve.\n\n\"To ensure they were able to afford energy, that they had appropriate IR (industrial relations), legislation, that they were able to get through the approvals processes, that they weren't facing the removal of fuel tax credits,\" she said.\n\nWalking the tightrope\n\nRST Solutions is one of those Australian companies walking the tightrope between China and the US. \n\nThey are working on mining projects all over the world, including China, and are expanding into the US through a partnership there. \n\nThey have provided environmental services to the big Stargate nickel processing plant set up by the Chinese in Indonesia to produce ferronickel and new energy nickel battery materials.\n\nOperations manager David Handel said they were helping to clean up the mine site. \n\n\"Sediment is getting washed off the mines into the waterways, so we're trying to stop it at the source,\" he said.\n\nHe said Australian companies have a lot to offer in terms of expertise in mining sustainably, but he doesn't think it will be easy for other countries to combat China's dominance of the sector.\n\nAnd he's not concerned about the trade war and US tariffs because the Australian dollar is low, making his company's products and services relatively cheap in that country.\n\n\"Our Aussie dollar is so low, we're so attractive still, so these guys aren't even blinking when we're talking tariffs, it's not even coming up in conversation,\" Mr Handel said.","summary":"Australian mining companies could benefit from

CQ Brown Jr. \n\nThey also have fired the only two women serving as four-star officers, as well as a disproportionate number of other senior female officers.\n\nIn the earlier rounds of firing, Hegseth said the eliminations were 'a reflection of the president wanting the right people around him to execute the national security approach we want to take.'\n\nAs Pentagon chief, Hegseth has touted his efforts to root out any programming or leadership that endorses diversity in the ranks, tried to terminate transgender service members and begun sweeping changes to enforce a uniform fitness standard for combat positions.\n\nIn a memo announcing the cuts Monday, Hegseth said they would remove 'redundant force structure to optimize and streamline leadership.'

US ... More President Donald Trump said Sunday he was ordering new tariffs on all films made outside the United States, claiming Hollywood was being \"devastated\" by a trend of US filmmakers and studios working abroad. The announcement comes as the White House is coming under mounting criticism over its aggressive trade policies that have seen Trump impose sweeping tariffs on countries around the globe. (Photo by Frederic J. BROWN / AFP) (Photo by FREDERIC J. BROWN/AFP via Getty Images)\nAFP via Getty Images\n\nIt was the message heard around the world that will forever change productions around the world. Hollywood executives and producers are reeling after President Donald Trump’s Sunday announcement that could place film production squarely in the crosshairs of his expanding tariff war, threatening to fundamentally reshape how and where content is created worldwide.\n\nPresident Trump made this announcement via post on his Truth Social platform, stating that he has directed his trade representatives to implement a 100% tariff on all foreign-produced films. He claims Hollywood studios are shifting production overseas to take advantage of financial incentives offered by other countries.\n\nAfter a life-altering pandemic in 2020, an unprecedented labor strike with WGA, SAG-AFTRA and DGA in 2023, and an increasingly soft theatrical market, this latest issue feels like the final straw in a series of distressing factors that could upend the film and television business as we know it. But a tariff proclamation is also filled with ambiguity and uncertainty. While many speculate the impacts of what experts are predicting to be a “seismic” industry shift, producers must strategically proceed with their work and be prepared to pivot when the revised posts come in.\n\nAs an entertainment lawyer focused on studio and producer representation, here are a few tips that I have been repeating on loop to industry clients and connects since the announcement.\n\n1. Remain Calm\n\nAs an industry, we should all add this to the list of challenges that come with bringing a project into fruition. While the tariffs present a host of new issues, the focus for producers now needs to be on what they can control and on monitoring what they cannot.\n\nMORE FOR YOU\n\nDelete Any Texts On Your Phone That Include These Messages\n\nToday’s NYT Mini Crossword Clues And Answers For Monday, May 5th\n\nConfirmed — 19 Billion Compromised Passwords Published Online\n\n2. Made in America\n\nIf you are a U.S. producer, plan to shoot in the United States… for now. While we do not yet know the full impact of the tariffs and its guidelines, if there is a way to make something in the U.S. in 2025, I would advise that you stay put in America. In the past 24 hours alone, we have already heard of films pulling out of Canada for fear of the tariff repercussions.\n\n3. Bet Your Dollar on American Estimates Only\n\nWith the unknown impact of how the rest of the world will respond, as a producer or financier, you can only rely on how a project may perform in the United States. Foreign sales will almost certainly be negatively impacted but the extent is unknown. Whether foreign territories provide reciprocal tariffs or incentivize the acquisition of local content, foreign sales and even the estimates around foreign sales will be in a state of freefall for the coming weeks. Suffice to say, the 2025 Cannes market will be filled with even more groans on moans than years past.\n\n4. Keep Your Eye Out for Loopholes\n\nWithout any guidance on what the tariff means, producers need to bob and waive for how to make it work. Many questions are up in the air and top of mind. Is Puerto Rico part of America? Will U.S. incentives improve as a response or become complacent because producers have less motivation to shoot elsewhere?

Prior to news in March of finding a buyer, the listing had gone down to $6.9 million, suggesting the purchaser secured an even better bargain than that reduced price.\n\nThe home featured an impressive 3,381 square feet, with four bedrooms and three bathrooms. \n\nAmong the penthouse’s amenities were a sauna and a rooftop deck with a stunning view of Manhattan.\n\nThe views inside the apartment were nearly as good thanks to its abundant windows and a glass-encased room that gives a stellar view of the East River.\n\nOther amenities include a doorman on duty 24 hours a day and a convenient live-in superintendent.\n\nRecords filed with the city register indicate that the penthouse, which is located at 255 E. 49th St. in Midtown East, was sold on April 23.\n\nThere was sparse information available about the buyer, but it is reportedly a shell company operating under the name Sky Space LLC. \n\nThe records also indicate that the penthouse was originally two units that had been combined prior to O’Donnell’s 2017 purchase.\n\nLast month, the comedian explained that her decision to leave the US was influenced by the goals of the Project 2025 movement, which laid out a series of right-wing plans for a second Trump administration ahead of the 2024 election.\n\nDonald Trump claimed during the campaign season to know nothing about Project 2025, and his campaign went as far as to say people involved with the group would be banned from the government, but he has since installed several people involved with the project or nominated them to cabinet positions. \n\nWhile speaking to CNN, O’Donnell blamed Project 2025 for making life for her and her nonbinary child Clay feel unsafe, but she expressed positive feelings about her new life in Dublin.\n\n‘I have no regrets. Not a day has gone by that I thought it was the wrong decision,’ she said. ‘I was welcomed with open arms. \n\n‘I knew that after reading Project 2025 that if Trump got in it was time for me and my non-binary child to leave the country.’ \n\nShe also distanced herself from a first wave of stars who threatened to leave the US prior to the election, including Ellen DeGeneres and America Ferrara, by clarifying that she waited and ‘made the decision with my family and my therapist’ after seeing early plans for the new administration.\n\n‘When [Trump] won, we made the plan into action and we were gone before he was inaugurated,’ she explained.\n\nThe League Of Their Own star — who has long been a critic of Trump and has publicly feuded with him over the years — said it was ‘heartbreaking’ to see what he has already done to the US.\n\n‘I knew that if I was in the United States and watched him destroy the country and the constitution — and really pay no mind to the laws that the Founders stood by and that our country stands for as a beacon of shining light and freedom for the rest of the world — that should he do what the Heritage Foundation said he was going to do, in that Project 2025, that we were going to be in big trouble,’ she said.\n\n‘It’s as bad as they promised, and even a little bit worse, it’s been heartbreaking and very, very sad to watch.’","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nRosie O&#8217;Donnell might be regretting her decision to sell her New York&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Rosie O&#8217;Donnell, a Wealthy Celebrity, Faces Major Setback After Leaving the US first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/news/rosie-odonnell-a-wealthy-celebrity-faces-major-setback-after-leaving-the-us/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Multi-millionaire-Rosie-ODonnell-rocked-by-huge-loss-after-fleeing-US.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-05-06 00:51:48","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.004},{"id":318201096,"title":"Migrants deported by Donald Trump set to be sent to Rwanda hotels built by Britain","text":"Migrants deported by Donald Trump may be housed in Rwandan hotels paid for by British taxpayers, reports claim. The Rwandan government will discuss housing people removed from America in facilities that were built by the UK, it is understood today. When asked if the British facilities would be used for the American scheme, a Rwandan government official reportedly said: \"Those are details that will be discussed at an appropriate time.\" Under the new agreement, Rwanda would join the list of \"third countries\" where Mr Trump's administration sends deportees, similar to El Salvador. The US President has been criticised for sending migrants to \"hell on Earth\" prisons in El Salvador , including Kilmar Ábrego García, who last week Mr Trump said he can \"bring back\" man but \"won't\" . Rwanda has already received some migrants from the US, including at least one Iraqi national, according to a diplomatic cable TV station. But Britain's use of the accommodation has been blasted and was scrapped by Keir Starmer days after Labour won the general election in July . The Tories had introduced it, however just four migrants were sent to the African state, all voluntarily. Olivier Nduhungirehe, Rwanda's foreign affairs minister, said the country was in the \"early stage\" of talks with Mr Trump's administration. The US has already struck a similar deal with El Salvador. Mr Nduhungirehe told The Telegraph : \"This aligns with our broader policy of offering second chances to migrants facing challenges in various parts of the world .\" When Mr Starmer axed the deportation plan here, the Tories insisted the programme hadn't started. However, it received legal clearance from the High Court of Justice and was scheduled for June 14, 2022 - two years before Labour came to power. Yet, it hit snags, such as a last-minute interim measure by the European Court of Human Rights. Labour has instead diverted the money to fund a new Border Security Command, designed to use counter-terror style powers to end people-smuggling gangs. But it is thought some £700million of taxpayers' money went into the Tories' plan, including £290million in payments to Rwanda, as well as the costs of chartering flights that never left the ground. It also cost the taxpayer to detain hundreds of people and then release them, and to pay for more than 1,000 civil servants to work on the scheme. Britain spent at least £318million to pay for asylum facilities and boost economic development in Rwanda, it is reported today. More than 40 per cent of Brits surveyed in a YouGov poll in April 2022, weeks before the scheme was to start, said they disagreed with the Conservative Party's programme.","summary":"British taxpayers have paid for the Rwanda accommodation, part of a scheme widely criticised since it was introduced - and new plans involving Donald Trump have also been slammed","url":"https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/politics/migrants-deported-donald-trump-set-35175297","image":"https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/article35175311.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200b/1_President-Trump-Signs-Executive-Orders-At-The-White-House.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-05-06 00:47:52","author":"Bradley Jolly","authors":["Bradley Jolly"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.347},{"id":318196314,"title":"Mike Pence Rips Trump by Name After Avoiding It at Kennedy Award Speech","text":"Former Vice President Mike Pence criticized Donald Trump by name Monday after failing to directly call out the president in a speech just 24-hours earlier.\n\nPence spoke to CNN the day after receiving the John F.

The president also pardoned more than 1,500 supporters who had been charged with or convicted of crimes connected with the Capitol riot, including serious assaults on police officers protecting the building and lawmakers inside. Some of the rioters chanted “hang Mike Pence” because they didn’t want the then-vice president to certify a legitimate presidential election.\n\nFourteen militant group leaders had their sentences commuted, but Tarrio received a full pardon and was immediately released from prison.\n\nWithin a month he was arrested again for simple assault after being accused of whacking a phone out of a protester's hand during a rally outside the Capitol.\n\nAlthough Tarrio himself was not in Washington, D.C. during the Jan 6 attack due to a court order, prosecutors charged that he had helped coordinate the action and encouraged Proud Boys remotely from a hotel room in Baltimore.\n\nIn a post-pardon interview with far-right broadcaster Alex Jones, Tarrio said: \"I’m happy that the president’s focusing not on retribution and focusing on success, but I will tell you that I’m not gonna play by those rules.”\n\nThe “people who did this, they need to feel the heat. They need to be put behind bars, and they need to be prosecuted!\" he emphasized.","summary":"Tarrio was sentenced to 22 years in prison for conspiring with other Proud Boys to attack the U.S. Capitol on Jan 6, 2021.

But Wyler insisted, and that’s how we have Audrey Hepburn and Gregory Peck tearing through the streets of Rome on a Vespa, among many of Princess Ann’s iconic scenes.\n\n Why in the name of the Piazza Navona am I bringing up a movie from nearly three-quarters of a century ago now? Because it was in that moment and the moment of Quo Vadis just before it that modern global Hollywood was born. Shooting overseas slowly but surely became a regular thing for U.S. studios, first in Italy, then in England. By the 1990’s both the U.K. and Australia were actively trying to lure productions with incentive packages, and in the 2000’s Hungary, Spain and other European countries were following suit. So much so now that we have the perfect opposite of the Wyler situation: studios and foreign governments are begging for movies to be shot overseas, and directors have to fight if they want to shoot in the U.S.\n\n That is, until Sunday night, when Donald Trump sought to turn back the clock and undo some 75 years of history. Using the blunt instrument of a tariff, he sought to bring us back to that pre-Wylerian times of a default shooting on a Southern California backlot, or at least whatever U.S. state is currently offering the most generous tax incentives.\n\n “The Movie Industry in America is DYING a very fast death,” he wrote. “Other Countries are offering all sorts of incentives to draw our filmmakers and studios away from the United States. Hollywood, and many other areas within the U.S.A., are being devastated.”\n\n Declaring his desire for a “100% tariff on any and all Movies coming into our Country that are produced in Foreign Lands” — a prohibitive number, as no studio has that kind of margins — Trump said he was “authorizing the Department of Commerce, and the United States Trade Representative, to immediately begin the process of instituting” said tariff.\n\n The post launched a disruptive pinball under the glass table of Hollywood, even as a Trump spokesman shortly after appeared to walk back the plan. All the discounts a production gets from shooting overseas, whether through the relative weakness of a local currency or the incentives a government offers, would mean nothing compared to this draconian penalty. And so, Trump’s logic goes, studios will just bring all the productions they outsourced right back to these shores. Voila, thousands of crew jobs and economic benefits restored.\n\n In some ways this is exactly the logic that drives so much the tariff movement — and all the attendant questions. Does a penalty for shooting overseas really mean all that film and television production will now happen in the U.S.? Or does it simply mean there will be less production overall? Probably a bit of both, but certainly one can’t downplay the latter as a possibility. Occupying a reality where the default is already a quickly shrinking release slate, studio executives, it seems plausible, will simply decide to cut back further rather than maintain the same output at a higher cost.\n\n Just as one can’t dismiss the protestations of Apple and Nike that they just can’t make their products cost-effectively without these overseas discounts and must either cut back or raise prices, studio executives will tell reps — and Wall Street — that they’re combating tariffs by reducing output or raising prices themselves.\n\n But this is where comparisons to other products end. Much has been made of how Trump can even enforce tariffs on a service (there’s no port of entry, for starters) but it seems to me an even more fundamental question abides, a distinction Trump either doesn’t know or doesn’t care to know.\n\n When you’re talking about, say, an iPhone put together in China, it really is manufactured overseas; the design has long been rendered and workers are just assembling parts. But that’s not what happens on a Hollywood or even American indie movie. Since every movie is its own startup creation, it really is a U.S. product no matters where it winds up shooting. The script is generally written here, the project is developed here, actors are cast here and notes are given here. The idea that somehow a film shot in Europe is fully “manufactured overseas” like an iPhone or pair of Nikes simply doesn’t take understand or take into account how a Hollywood film’s development works, and how American it is regardless of where cameras roll.\n\n Of course it’s possible Trump understands this and is going ahead anyway. Which raises the question of what Trump is really up to — in a phrase, is he trying to save Hollywood or screw it? Certainly he does not seem interested in helping his Hollywood. All three of the president’s handpicked “ambassadors” would suffer under the tariffs. Mel Gibson is getting ready to shoot his new Passion of the Christ movie in Italy (in the same studio as Roman Holiday), Sylvester Stallone just released his England-shot action movie A Working Man that he co-wrote and produced, and Jon Voight barely mentioned tariffs in his own new plan; he’s unlikely to want this either.\n\n Many of Hollywood’s allies on Capitol Hill would suffer too. California senate Democrat Adam Schiff has been working hard behind the scenes for a federal tax credit – an uphill climb to be sure, even only in the form of a tax credit at a moment when the White House is eager to distant itself from any perception of the federal government helping the arts, but something that would genuinely be effective in returning production.\n\n “I share the administration’s desire to bring movie making back to the United States,” Schiff said in a statement to The Hollywood Reporter on Monday. “While blanket tariffs on all films would have unintended and potentially damaging impacts, we have an opportunity to work together to pass a major federal film tax credit to re-shore American jobs in the industry.”\n\n Schiff’s words are music to Bob Iger’s ears. This is what studios really want, and perhaps need — an incentive to shoot here, not a stick to rap them if they don’t. But if there’s a willingness to employ these means, Trump has yet to show it.\n\n Instead, the person he seems to be listening to is Sean O’Brien, the teamsters chief who has cultivated a relationship with the president. On Monday O’Brien and the group’s motion picture division leader Lindsay Dougherty were among the few leading figures with Hollywood connections to publicly offer applause for what Trump was doing. The Teamsters’ interests may align with and explain Trump’s — a populist move that punishes Hollywood elites in the name of its workers, with a few older action stars as collateral damage.\n\n One of the key concessions that Wyler made that enabled him to produce his film in Italy was to shoot in black-and-white. This decision reduced costs for the studio so the movie could shoot in a more expensive overseas location but gain authenticity. \n\n Trump is now again betting that studios will find a way to lower their costs so they can shoot somewhere more expensive, this time not in the name of authenticity but employment. It’s a risky bet. When it comes to cheaper foreign countries, Hollywood executives, like Princess Ann, may not know how to say goodbye, or have the budgets.","summary":"Does he believe he’s saving Hollywood or screwing Hollywood?","url":"https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/business/business-news/donald-trump-movie-tariffs-reason-1236208039/","image":"https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/GettyImages-2212645664.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-05-06 00:30:25","author":"Steven Zeitchik","authors":["Steven Zeitchik"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.136},{"id":318196344,"title":"This is a 'case study' for what's wrong with sanctuary cities, says DHS official","text":"to top close Video This video is playing in picture-in-picture.\n\nThe Evening Edit May 05, 2025 05:07 \n\n This is a 'case study' for what's wrong with sanctuary cities, says DHS official \n DHS assistant public affairs secretary Tricia McLaughlin weighs in on judges blocking President Donald Trump's deportations of violent criminals and 'due process' concerns on 'The Evening Edit.'\n Facebook Twitter Email Copy to clipboard Copy to clipboard \n\nTags POLITICSWHAT TO WATCHSHOWSTHE EVENING EDIT | LATEST EPISODESTHE EVENING EDITV-VIDEOS","summary":"DHS assistant public affairs secretary Tricia McLaughlin weighs in on judges blocking President Donald Trump&apos;s deportations of violent criminals and &apos;due process&apos; concerns on &apos;The Evening Edit.&apos;","url":"https://www.foxbusiness.com/video/6372391835112","image":"https://a57.foxnews.com/cf-images.us-east-1.prod.boltdns.net/v1/static/854081161001/dfa294ff-c30b-4270-a316-6ef507dafd6b/27ca7f09-13f2-40e3-ab1b-5c72e4920917/1280x720/match/1024/512/image.jpg?ve=1&tl=1","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-05-06 00:30:10","author":null,"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.356},{"id":318200566,"title":"Hong Kong’s freight forwarding industry takes hit from trade war","text":"Hong Kong’s freight forwarding industry is suffering collateral damage from an intensifying tariff war between China and the United States, shaking the city’s crucial role in re-exporting goods, business leaders have warned.\nMany manufacturers with more than 15 per cent of business exposure to China-US trade had been forced to slash jobs or save costs, said Joyce Tai, executive vice-president for worldwide partnerships at Nasdaq-listed global freight booking platform Freightos.\n“There will be [a] huge economic hit, and probably more so on the Hong Kong side, because … Hong Kong is a pass-through,” she said.\nThat is driven by tariffs of 145 per cent that US President Donald Trump recently imposed on Chinese imports. He also levied so-called reciprocal tariffs on most of the US’ trade partners, but to a lesser extent.\n“And the impact of the same tariff imposed [on] Hong Kong is just probably a lot heavier than that we are seeing on mainland China,” Tai said.\nAccording to TAC Index, an air freight intelligence provider, the index of outbound routes from Hong Kong fell by 3.1 per cent week on week in the four weeks leading to April 28, leaving it 3.6 per cent lower year on year.\n“Market players have been trying to navigate volatility and turmoil in global trade caused by the on-again, off-again saga of new tariffs into the US, as well as an end to the ‘de minimis’ exemption for small packages of under US$800,” TAC Index editor Neil Wilson said, who expected further falls in air cargo rates.\nBefore the tariff war, the city’s value of exports to the US gained 4 per cent year on year, reaching HK$70.25 billion (US$9.06 billion) in the first quarter, according to the Census and Statistics Department. But the value of imports sank by 6.2 per cent, falling to HK$51.7 billion.\nAnalysts said they expected tariffs would dampen exports and re-exports to the US from early April.\nThe trade war would also have implications for Hong Kong’s mandate to be an international maritime and transshipment hub, serving as a bridge between the country and the rest of the world.\n\nFreightos’ head of research, Judah Levine, highlighted “reports of quite a significant pause or cancellations of orders” and ocean freight bookings, “specifically out of China”.\n“We know that carriers are cancelling many sailings, very high levels of sailings that were scheduled from China to North America for the coming weeks,” Levine said, expecting lower ocean freight volumes if the tariff situation remained significant.\n“That shows a drop in demand for ocean freight out of China to North America, to the United States.”\nFor some businesses, tariffs are “not unviable, and certainly if shippers [and] importers are ordering anyway, you would see those costs passed on to consumers,” he added. “And I do not think we are seeing that just yet. The tariffs only went into effect a couple of weeks ago, so there will still be time for those costs … to show up.”\nIn late April, German container carrier Hapag-Lloyd said its customers had cancelled 30 per cent of shipments to the US from China as a result of the trade conflict.\nForty-one per cent of container capacity scheduled from Hong Kong to North America’s west coast in the week starting Monday has been cancelled, and 32 per cent in the coming two weeks, according to supply chain research firm Sea-Intelligence. While high, this is not outside of the normal supply volatility seen on the liner services from Hong Kong to North America.\n“For the services from Hong Kong to North America, we do not see any discernible increase in the number of blank sailings for April or May, which is contrary to what we see for the overall transpacific trade,” said Alan Murphy, chief executive and founder of Sea-Intelligence.\n“One could speculate that as Hong Kong has lost significant presence on the transpacific over the past decade, there is less optionality to cut capacity on the services from Hong Kong.\n“In 2013, Hong Kong had 30 weekly services connecting to North America, but by 2024 this had dropped to just 10 weekly services, and in the 2025 networks this has dropped even further to just seven weekly services.”\nThe situation is further aggravated by a growing number of manufacturers setting up operations or trading in Mexico to take advantage of the zero-tariff benefits under the US-Mexico-Canada trade agreement and tax incentives.\n“A lot of manufacturers that we know of … are already taking measures to either cut down their labour forces, or they are looking at different ways to save money,” Tai said.\nLevine, meanwhile, said that “since the previous Trump trade war, we’ve seen a gradual shift away from China and towards … alternatives. Mexico was a big beneficiary of that”.\nHe added that investments from China into Mexico and logistics flows between the two countries were on the rise.\nMexico-based industry leader Stefanie Pan Xueyun said: “During [and since] the pandemic … we’ve been receiving Chinese companies every month, a lot of them coming to Mexico.”\nReasons include the cost, logistics, uncertainty of labour availability and tariffs, according to Pan, manager of Asia business development at American Industries Group, which has developed 17 industrial estates and served more than 300 companies in Mexico.\nFor instance, Hong Kong-listed battery producer Leoch International Technology is building its second factory in Mexico.\n“Since the pandemic, we have noticed changes in the concept of a global supply chain referred to as the global village, which is gradually shifting towards regionalisation,” said Leoch’s executive director and chief investment officer, Helen Hong Yu.\nSteve Chuang Tzu-hsiung, chairman of the Federation of Hong Kong Industries, expressed concerns about the unpredictability of US trade policy.\n“How am I to know what Trump will say tomorrow? [If he] says that Mexico gets 145 per cent tomorrow, what then? Wouldn’t my investment be in vain?” Chuang said.\n“Therefore, such unpredictable policies in the US, changing with each passing day, make it fundamentally impossible to conduct business.”","summary":"In week starting Monday, 41 per cent of container capacity scheduled from Hong Kong to North America’s west coast cancelled.","url":"https://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/hong-kong-economy/article/3309130/hong-kongs-freight-forwarding-industry-takes-hit-trade-war","image":"https://cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2025/05/05/01a9ea82-5c02-4cbc-9749-54946565c564_a05af080.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-05-06 00:30:08","author":"Lam Ka-Sing","authors":["Lam Ka-Sing"],"language":"en","source_country":"cn","sentiment":-0.338},{"id":318194928,"title":"Met Gala 2025: Zendaya, Miley Cyrus, Gigi Hadid and Lana del Rey lead the glamour on fashion's biggest night","text":"Black Friday\n\nLatest Headlines\n\nKate Middleton\n\nPrivacy Policy\n\nTuesday, May 6th 2025\n\n5-Day Forecast\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMet Gala 2025 red carpet divides fans as Anna Wintour garbles attempt to explain theme: live updates\n\nTwo British Superbikes riders, 21 and 29, dead after 11-man crash which was shown on live TV saw Oulton Park event cancelled\n\nThe France expat dream that became a nightmare: British mother, 65, is seen dancing and smiling with her French lover in video captured just months before she was stabbed to death \n\nLIZ JONES: Meghan and Nicola are ruthless troublemakers who have ripped weak manchildren Harry and Brooklyn from their families.

Renewed fighting hasn’t forced Hamas to surrender, nor has it resulted in the release of more hostages.\n\nThe cabinet has decided that the most likely way to succeed, is to increase the military pressure.\n\nOne Israeli official explained the shift in strategy to me as away from “clear and leave” to one of “clear and hold”.\n\nThat is a military tactic used by Western forces in the past, by the US and British in parts of Iraq and Afghanistan for example.\n\nMuch can be said in criticism of those wars, but the allied intention was never to permanently occupy either of those countries. We cannot confidently say the same in respect to Gaza.\n\nIsraeli commentators today are divided in their opinion of whether the plan is to conquer and hold all of Gaza or just large swathes of it.\n\nAlso unclear is how long the “hold” element will be: until the hostages are released? Until Hamas is no longer able to fight? Or permanent.\n\nSources have told me that’s yet to be defined, but the latter – a permanent Israeli occupation of Gaza – is no longer an unrealistic or unthinkable prospect.\n\nRead more:Israeli pilots’ letter reveals deepening riftSeriously ill children from Gaza allowed into UK\n\nPresident Trump’s announcement in February that America should “own” and redevelop Gaza, with all Palestinians forced to leave was extraordinary but could, to some extent, be dismissed coming from a President that doesn’t have the patience or time span to achieve something so complex and controversial.\n\nWhat it did do, however, was legitimise a dream that some in the Israeli government hold. Discussions are reportedly taking place with a number of countries to rehouse Gazans.\n\nThe Israeli government says it intends to push Gazans into the south of the strip, to give it freedom to operate elsewhere. It’s not too much of a stretch to envisage a situation where the population is moved into the Rafah area on the border with Egypt, Rafah would then effectively become an enclave within Gaza and the responsibility of aid distribution becomes Cairo’s problem.\n\nBenjamin Netanyahu’s announcement last week, that the goal of “supreme victory” is now the defeat of Hamas, not the return the hostages, effectively ends any hope for a permanent ceasefire in the short term.\n\nThe implication is that even were Hamas to release all the remaining 59 hostages tomorrow, Israel’s war in Gaza would not be over.\n\nFurthermore, if Israel is committed to the total defeat of Hamas, as opposed to a political solution that sees Hamas leaders leave Gaza and the group disarmed for example, then that is an ambition that could take many more years of fighting to realise, if ever; just imagine how many young Gazans have been radicalised as a result of the last eighteen months of war.\n\nWe cannot, confidently, say where this will all go. There remains some small hope that Donald Trump’s visit to Saudi Arabia, UAE and Qatar later this month will push the sides towards a new agreement but the ‘day after’ in Gaza has retreated over an ever-retreating horizon and the only certainty now seems to be increased fighting for many months to come.","summary":"Israel&#8217;s decision to expand military operations inside Gaza is a significant development with perhaps permanent consequences for the future of the Strip and the two million Palestinians who live there.

But cameras at 70 intersections aren’t coming down soon.","text":"The Denver City Council decided against extending the contract for about 100 license-plate readers throughout the city Monday amid concerns about the system creating a mass-surveillance network.\n\nBut the cameras, which are perched at about 70 intersections throughout Denver, will stay up through at least the end of the year.\n\nThe city installed the cameras in 2024 as part of a pilot program attempting to reduce car thefts in the state. The system, which photographs nearly 2 million cars per month, has led to about 170 vehicle recoveries and 300 arrests since then. Law enforcement can also use the photos to help solve other crimes, like homicides and hit-and-runs.\n\nThe pilot program, originally scheduled to end in February, will continue despite the unanimous “no” vote from the City Council, said Jordan Fuja, a spokesperson for Mayor Mike Johnston.\n\n“We estimate there is enough unspent funding in that contract that it will be able to last through the end of the year,” she said.\n\nThe new contract would have extended the program for two more years, adding $666,000 to the agreement with Flock, the company that installs the license-plate scanners. Denver has paid Flock about $339,000 for its services to date.\n\nThe scanners take photos of every car that passes through the covered intersections. If a plate matches one listed as stolen or involved with a crime, the Denver Police Department is notified of the location within about 15 seconds. The photos are stored for 30 days unless they are flagged as part of an investigation.\n\nCouncil members and members of the public have voiced concerns over what could happen if law enforcement officers or the federal government misused the information in some way.\n\n“We know that it can help solve crime,” Councilman Kevin Flynn said. “But I think since maybe Jan. 20 of this year, those concerns are greatly heightened and have a new reality about them.”\n\nFlynn was referencing the inauguration of President Donald Trump, who has promised to carry out mass deportations of immigrants who are in this country illegally.\n\nOther agencies beyond the Denver Police Department have access to the data, including some that cooperate with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials. Those who use the information have to attest that they won’t pass it along to ICE, said Denver police Cmdr. Jacob Herrera.\n\nJohnston’s office proposed the two-year contract extension in March but ultimately asked the council to reject the contract extension Monday, following backlash from residents.\n\n“We acknowledge that today’s environment is much different than when the pilot began in early 2024,” Fuja said in a written statement.\n\nThe cameras are “a critical component” in the city’s efforts to reduce auto thefts, according to the statement.\n\nOver the next year, city officials plan to convene a task force to address the concerns, Fuja said. That could mean tweaking the contract or approving new policies to further address concerns. The council would have to agree to extend the contract for the cameras to stay up past this year.\n\n“(We) look forward to continuing conversations with the community to discuss public safety benefits and ensure that we are addressing privacy and security concerns,” according to the statement.\n\nThe council was originally set to consider the resolution April 14, but the mayor’s office postponed it to answer council members’ questions, council spokesman Robert Austin said.\n\nStay up-to-date with Colorado Politics by signing up for our weekly newsletter, The Spot.","summary":"The cameras, which are perched at about 70 intersections throughout Denver, will stay up through at least the end of the year.","url":"https://www.denverpost.com/2025/05/05/denver-license-plate-readers-flock-cameras/","image":"https://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/TDP-L-LICENSE-PLATE-CAM_JAC7960x.jpg?w=1024&h=683","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-05-06 00:26:01","author":"Elliott Wenzler","authors":["Elliott Wenzler"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.293},{"id":318195440,"title":"Oakland mayor’s two-year budget calls for layoffs but spares police officer cuts","text":"OAKLAND — Faced with a crushing financial deficit totaling $265 million over the next two years, Oakland’s interim mayor proposed a budget Monday that includes dozens of layoffs and the freezing of hundreds of other positions.\n\nBut the two-year budget spares the city’s police and fire departments from further staffing cuts.\n\nCouncilmember Kevin Jenkins — serving as the city’s acting leader before Mayor-elect Barbara Lee is sworn in later this month — laid out what he called a “pathway to financial stability” aimed at beginning the long, arduous process of reshaping the city’s checkbook from its usual pattern of stinging annual deficits. He did so in a seven-page budget summary ahead of the full budget’s formal release, which was expected at a yet-to-be-announced hour Monday evening.\n\nJenkins’ proposal includes cutting 80 jobs that are currently staffed, though city officials on Monday expressed optimism they could shuffle all but less than a dozen of those people to similar, now-vacant positions with the city. In addition, more than 325 vacancies will remain unfilled.\n\nCity officials on Monday did not describe which departments would be impacted by the job cuts.\n\nCalling public safety the city’s “top responsibility,” Jenkins proposed funding 678 sworn police officers for both upcoming fiscal years. He also proposed funding six police academies over the next two years, along with two firefighter academies.\n\nJenkins also wants to drop the number of fire station closures from three to two, and have those two closures rotate throughout the city. For example, the two fire stations in the Oakland hills that were recently closed for budgetary reasons will likely reopen over the summer fire season, while others facing lower call volumes will temporarily shut down, city officials said.\n\nJenkins stressed that four more fire stations would have closed had voters not recently approved Measure A, a sales tax increase which is expected to add $20 million to the city’s budget next year and $30 million the following year.\n\n“We are working very diligently to restore public safety in the city,” Jenkins said at a press conference Monday afternoon. “You see from the election that recently happened that residents are demanding that they want to feel safe in the city that they love.”\n\nThe budget proposal now heads to the City Council, which is expected to haggle over amendments and changes ahead of a June 30 deadline for passage. City staff also must hold public budget meetings in each council district for residents to offer their input.\n\nThe budget — which calls for $2.1 billion in spending from July 1 through June 30, 2026, and another $2.2 billion the following fiscal year — is largely contingent on federal funding remaining steady, even as President Donald Trump vows to gut federal spending in the coming years.\n\nIt also assumes the passage of a yet-to-be-drafted ballot measure in June 2026, which could bring in another $40 million in tax revenue for “ongoing public safety resources,” according to the budget overview released Monday. That tax revenue — if put on the ballot and passed — would pay for services and staff currently on the city’s payroll, city officials said.\n\nThe proposal comes at a turbulent time for Oakland as the city grapples with a perilous budget crisis and an ongoing leadership void.\n\nOakland leaders have warned the city faces a $265 million budget shortfall over the next two fiscal years, amid lagging revenues from taxes on real-estate transfers and business licenses, along with rising overtime costs for the city’s police and fire departments. That deficit includes a $138 million shortfall during the next fiscal year — which runs from July 1 through June 30, 2026 — and a $127 million shortfall the following fiscal year.\n\nAlready this year, the city has laid off 42 employees and demoted 34 others to rectify a deep budget shortfall in its current fiscal year. Other steps to balance the current fiscal year budget have included temporarily closing two fire stations, cancelling all police-training academies and slashing $2.6 million in funding for outside nonprofits and a host of other grants and citywide programs.\n\nIn the process, several agencies — among them Moody’s, Fitch and S&P — have lowered Oakland’s bond rating, making it more expensive for the city to borrow money for infrastructure projects. That could complicate plans outlined Monday by Jenkins to buy $180 million in bonds for affordable housing projects over the next two years, along with $50 million in bonds for street paving projects.\n\nOakland isn’t the only municipality in the Bay Area to struggle financially. San Francisco faces a $876 million shortfall over that same two-year time period, while the city of San Jose is grappling with a $60 million shortfall in the coming fiscal year.\n\nUnique to Oakland, however, is a run of deep political upheaval within the mayor’s office. In November 2022, voters recalled the city’s former mayor, Sheng Thao, barely two years into her first term. About two months later, a federal grand jury indicted Thao — along with her romantic partner and the father-and-son duo running the city’s recycling contractor — on federal bribery charges tied to an alleged pay-to-pay bribery scheme.\n\nSince the recall election, two councilmembers have served as interim mayors, including Jenkins, who authored the budget released Monday. The city’s fourth mayor in seven months — Lee — is expected to be sworn into office later this month with the goal of serving out the remainder of Thao’s original four-year term.\n\nThe budget’s rollout was, itself, a rocky process. Jenkins last week delayed its release by four days, citing “a period of transition following the recent election.” The announcement came two weeks after Finance Director Erin Roseman submitted her letter of resignation amid growing scrutiny over her handling of the city’s coffers.\n\nAlso missing recently has been any hint of the city’s latest five-year financial forecast, which is typically released in the weeks ahead of the mayor’s two-year budget proposal. City officials expect that document to be released by the end of the month.","summary":"The proposal includes cutting 80 jobs that are currently staffed, though city officials on Monday expressed optimism they could shuffle all but less than a dozen of those people to similar, now-vacant positions with the city.

Quincy Jones and completed in 1965.\nHer mid-century home features four bedrooms, six-and-a-half bathrooms with a wine cellar, pool, and guesthouse; it also has city and ocean views sitting on almost two acres of land.\nIt previously had a hillside vineyard but garden designer Marcello Villano and landscape architect Anne Attiger transformed her outdoor space into an oasis consisting of terraces, Asian-inspired pocket gardens and interconnected rooms, according to Architectural Digest story that profiled her home. \nJennifer told the magazine during her February 2018 issue that she'd 'want to be a designer' if she wasn't an actress because she loves 'the process.'\nThe Morning Show star said: 'There's something about picking up fabrics and finishes that feeds my soul.'\nThe actress said when she originally bought the home, architect Frederick Fisher had done a renovation but it was too minimal and cool for her taste, specifically the massive red-painted door.\nShe felt a connection with the home and worked with AD100 interior designer Stephen Shadley to help her transform the house into her home.\nIn addition to Stephen, she also enlisted the help of designers Kathleen and Tommy Clements and Jane Hallworth.\nFriendsLos AngelesJennifer Aniston\n\nShare or comment on this article: \nJennifer Aniston 'intruder held at gunpoint' in shocking 'home invasion'\n\nAdd comment\n\nComments 21\n\n Share what you think\n\nWorst rated\n\nThe comments below have not been moderated.\n\nThe views expressed in the contents above are those of our users and do not necessarily reflect the views of MailOnline.\n\nAdd your comment\n\nEnter your comment\n\nBy posting your comment you agree to our house rules.\n\nSubmit Comment\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual.\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual\n\nWe will automatically post your comment and a link to the news story to your Facebook timeline at the same time it is posted on MailOnline.

As “the threats rise across the world, Europe will not compromise on its principles,” she said.\n\nMacron said that the French government would also soon make new proposals to beef up investment in science and research.\n\nLast month, hundreds of university researchers in the United States had National Science Foundation funding canceled to comply with US President Donald Trump’s order to end support to research on diversity, equity and inclusion, as well as the study of misinformation.\n\nMore than 380 grant projects have been cut so far, including work to combat internet censorship in China and Iran and a project consulting with Indigenous communities to understand environmental changes in Alaska’s Arctic region.\n\nSome terminated grants that sought to broaden the diversity of people studying science, technology and engineering. Scientists, researchers and doctors have taken to the streets in protest.\n\nWhile not mentioning the Trump administration by name, von der Leyen said that it was “a gigantic miscalculation” to undermine free and open research.\n\n“We can all agree that science has no passport, no gender, no ethnicity, no political party,” she said. “We believe that diversity is an asset of humanity and the lifeblood of science.

Maura Healey, along with five other governors of northeastern states, is spearheading a meeting with Canadian provincial leaders in Boston to delve into the impacts of the tariffs imposed by President Donald Trump.\n\nIn a statement, Healey’s office said the meeting will focus on “how American and Canadian leaders can continue to work together to maintain strong trade relations that benefit local businesses and residents.”\n\nThe invitation by Healey, Maine’s Governor Janet Mills, New York Governor Kathy Hochul, Connecticut Governor Ned Lamont, Rhode Island Governor Daniel McKee, and Vermont Governor Phil Scott was sent to the premieres of New Brunswick, Newfoundland and Labrador, Nova Scotia, Ontario, Prince Edward Island, and Québec. \n\n“Canada is Massachusetts’ number one trading partner,” Healey said in a statement. “For generations, we have enjoyed a strong partnership and a healthy exchange of energy, lumber, dairy, cars and car parts, seafood and more. … But President Trump’s tariffs are undermining this partnership, making it harder for businesses to keep their doors open, and increasing the cost of everything that the New England and Canadian people rely on.”\n\nIn 2024, Maine saw more than $6 million in commerce with Canada, Mills said in a statement. \n\n“Our economies and our cultures have enjoyed strong relationships for generations, which is now strained by the president’s haphazard tariffs and harmful rhetoric targeting our northern neighbors,” she said.\n\nIn a statement, Scott said he is looking forward to the meeting to find ways to “mitigate” the cost increases resulting from the Trump administration’s tariffs. \n\n“As I have said in the past, I don’t believe increasing tariffs on our friends and close allies is in the best interest of Vermont or the United States,” he said. “A trade war with our friends to the north, our largest trading partner, seems like a bad idea.”\n\nHealey has been warning that Trump’s tariffs on Canadian energy alone could cost Massachusetts consumers nearly $1 billion, with the increase for the New England region likely reaching $2.5 billion. \n\nThe Trump administration has instituted a 25 percent tariff on most Canadian goods. \n\nDetails on the meeting will be forthcoming, according to Healey’s office.","summary":"“Canada is Massachusetts’ number one trading partner.\"\n\n\nThe post Healey, Northeast governors invite Canadian premiers to Boston for tariff meeting appeared first on Boston.com.","url":"https://www.boston.com/news/politics/2025/05/05/healey-northeast-governors-invite-canadian-premiers-to-boston-for-tariff-meeting/","image":"https://bdc2020.o0bc.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/https___arcmigration-prdweb.bostonglobe.com_r_Boston_2011-2020_2019_01_03_BostonGlobe.com_Business_Images_RinaldiHealey01-67c7368daf44e-768x432.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-05-06 00:12:33","author":"Dialynn Dwyer,President Donald Trump","authors":["Dialynn Dwyer","President Donald Trump"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.25},{"id":318196316,"title":"Opinion: Just Send the Met Gala to the Consignment Store of History Already","text":"Once the crown jewel of fashion’s social calendar, the Met Gala has officially devolved into a pageant of Pick Me energy—an orgy of try-hard looks and desperate influencer posing, now dominated by the TikTok generation’s endless thirst for attention.\n\nThis year’s theme, “Black Dandy,” was chosen with all the subtlety of a Balenciaga combat boot at a point when DEI was still in fashion and it looked as though then-Vice President Kamala Harris might win.\n\nBut the irony is thicker than Kim Kardashian’s lip liner: a celebration of Black male tailoring, from a Vogue editor who spent decades rarely supporting Black designers and rarely featuring Black talent on the cover of her magazine. Don’t be surprised if former Vogue editor-at-large André Leon Talley’s ghost haunts the party and trips a few people on the steps.\n\nAnna Wintour may have turned herself into the Met’s eternal gatekeeper—her name now permanently etched on the Costume Institute—but the event’s legacy is looking more cursed than curated. While it’s raised millions for the museum, it’s also raised micro-bladed eyebrows for the company it has kept.\n\n(I attended once, to support Oprah who was co-chairing. When I went to the loo the bathroom was full of models who having done the obligatory red carpet were plotting their escape from their advertiser overlords. I was home by 10.15pm. It ended surprisingly early for a New York gala.)\n\nLet’s rewind two years when Sean “Diddy” Combs paused on the Met steps to launch his so-called couture collection. Today, Combs doesn’t have much choice about what to wear. He’s held without bail at the Metropolitan Detention Center in Brooklyn charged with sex trafficking and racketeering, which he denies. Jury selection for his trial started today as his lawyers scrambled to find a potential juror who hasn’t seen the hotel surveillance video—released by CNN—that shows Combs violently attacking his then-girlfriend, Cassie Ventura.\n\nGhislaine Maxwell, another former Met Gala attendee, also can’t make it to this year’s event. Like Combs, she’s in prison having been found guilty of sex trafficking a minor. Her 2003 all-denim ensemble is gathering dust along with her reputation. \n\nHarvey Weinstein won’t be attending this year either which is good news for the potted plants. And former fashion maven Kanye West‘s invitation probably got lost in the mail now that he’s now selling $20 t-shirts with swastikas. Still, Wintour must be worried that this cringe-artist might crash the party like he did at the Grammy Awards in Los Angeles in February. West wore an all-black outfit while his “wife” Bianca Censori wore her birthday suit. \n\nLesser creep Charlie Rose was a fixture at the gala until he wasn’t. Same for Bruce Weber and Mario Testino—photographers once worshipped by the glossy elite, now sidelined after each were the subject of multiple MeToo allegations. (Weber settled with his accusers; Testino denied wrongdoing.)\n\nLast week Riccardo Tisci, the former creative head of both Givenchy and Burberry, was accused of sexual assault and drugging a man. He denies it. Alexander Wang, another darling of the Vogue circle, called similar allegations of abuse “baseless.“ That’s the thing about the Met Gala: it gives air cover to those with the right stylist and the right connections.\n\nEven the most powerful now seem wary. LeBron James, who once found himself awkwardly gracing the cover of Vogue with a wide-eyed Giselle Bündchen in a spread many deemed racially tone-deaf, suddenly bowed out of this year’s festivities, citing, of all things, a knee injury, despite being its honorary co-chair. Meanwhile, Mark Zuckerberg and Elon Musk opted out entirely—perhaps realizing that they shouldn’t attend an event when its hostess has publicly banned their boss Donald Trump from attending. \n\nTo be fair, the gala remains a fundraising juggernaut, netting tens of millions for the Met Museum and its Anna Wintour Costume Center. But in the process, it has made fools of many in their breathless quest to be the most clicked-on person in the room. \n\nThis year’s crowd has its share of bona fide celebrities: Diana Ross, Demi Moore, Anne Hathaway and Miley Cyrus for starters. But they rubbed shoulders with an influx of twenty-something social media stars paid for showing off their borrowed diamonds. This group seems less interested in honoring art and fashion history and more obsessed with snagging a viral moment. One influencer stood on the Met steps live-streaming for six hours. Another collapsed in what turned out to be a calculated faint.\n\nThis isn’t fashion. It’s performance art with a publicist. And the devil is still wearing Prada.","summary":"Photo Illustration by Elizabeth Brockway/The Daily Beast/GettyOnce the crown jewel of fashion’s social calendar, the Met Gala has officially devolved into a pageant of Pick Me energy—an orgy of try-hard looks and desperate influencer posing, now dominated by the TikTok generation’s endless thirst for attention.\n\nThis year’s theme, “Black Dandy,” was chosen with all the subtlety of a Balenciaga combat boot at a point when DEI was still in fashion and it looked as though then-Vice President Kamala Harris might win.\n\nBut the irony is thicker than Kim Kardashian’s lip liner: a celebration of Black male tailoring, from a Vogue editor who spent decades rarely supporting Black designers and rarely featuring Black talent on the cover of her magazine.

That's very nice, that's a great honor.' \n\nHe then joked with her family and her fiancée, professional boxer Chris van Heerden, that he now understands why they fought so hard for her return.\n\nTurning his attention back to Karelina, Trump asked her how long she was left languishing in the Russian prison - to which she replies 15 months.\n\n'That's a long time,' Trump acknowledges. In another clip, Karelina could be seen thanking the president for securing her release.\n\nThe ballerina was arrested while visiting her family in Yekaterinburg in February 2024, when Russian authorities discovered she donated $51 to the Ukrainian aid group Razom - and accused her of supporting the Ukrainian army.\n\nShe was sentenced to spend 12 years in a penal colony, but was freed in a prisoner swap last month.\n\nIt was negotiated between the intelligence agencies of Russian President Vladimir Putin and US President Trump, and saw Karelina freed in exchange for Russian national German Arthur Petrov, who was arrested in Cyprus in August 2023 on US charges of smuggling sensitive microelectronics to Russia.\n\nHeartwarming photos from her return showed Karelina embracing her fiancé at Joint Base Andrews in Maryland and walking away with a smile on her face and flowers in her hands.\n\nPetrov, meanwhile, was extradited to the US and was later released in Abu Dhabi.\n\nFollowing her return, van Heerden praised Trump for his efforts to bring his fiancé home.\n\n'The old administration didn't do nothing for her. We're very thankful for President Trump and the new administration,' he told TMZ.\n\nThe boxer recounted that there were 'a handful of people in the old administration that were amazing,' but he swiftly realized it would not be enough to bring his partner home. \n\n'About eight months in we knew we were going to struggle with the Biden administration,' van Heerden said, adding that he had 'faith and belief that President Trump would bring her back.'\n\nKarelina also praised the president for his efforts, adding that she was not yet ready to speak publicly about her ordeal. \n\n'I'm just really grateful to President Trump and the government for bringing me back and it just really feels good to be home,' she said.President Donald Trump briefly met with ballerina Ksenia Karelina inside the Oval Office on Monday, weeks after she returned to the United States\n\nTrump was sworn in for a second term as POTUS in January, and his administration set to work negotiating the terms of Karelina's release in the months since. \n\n'This young ballerina is out, and we appreciate that,' Trump said during a Cabinet meeting immediately following the revelation she'd made it home. \n\nCIA Director John Ratcliffe, who was reportedly involved in prisoner negotiations with FSB Director Alexander Bortnikov, was among those who greeted Karelina at the airport in Abu Dhabi.\n\nHe, too, praised Trump for bringing the Los Angeles-based dancer home. \n\n'Today, President Trump brought home another wrongfully detained American from Russia,' Ratcliffe told the Wall Street Journal. \n\n'I'm proud of the CIA officers who worked tirelessly to support this effort, and we appreciate the Government of the United Arab Emirates for enabling the exchange.\n\nNow-ousted national security adviser Mike Waltz added that: 'The United States welcomes the return of American-Russian ballerina Ksenia Karelina.' \n\n'President Trump and his administration continue to work around the clock to ensure Americans detained abroad are returned home to their families.'\n\nKarelina's release marks the second prisoner swap between the US and Russia since Donald Trump took office in January.\n\nRussia in February freed Marc Fogel, a schoolteacher and former employee of the US embassy in Moscow.\n\nFogel had served three and a half years of a 14-year sentence for drug smuggling after being caught in possession of a small amount of marijuana.\n\nIn exchange, Washington released Alexander Vinnik, a convicted Russian cybercriminal who had pleaded guilty in a US court to conspiring to launder money.\n\nBut at least 10 other Americans remain behind bars in Russia on various charges, hoping that their government can secure their release.\n\nThey include Stephen Hubbard, a 73-year-old native of Michigan jailed in October for nearly seven years on charges that he served as a mercenary in Ukraine.\n\nHubbard had been living in the Ukrainian town of Izium and was arrested after Russian forces took control of the city in 2022.\n\nHis relatives rejected claims that Hubbard served for Ukraine, pointing to his advanced age. He was designated in January as wrongfully detained.\n\nGordon Black, an active duty US staff sergeant based in South Korea, was also detained last May in Russia's Far East on suspicion of stealing money from his Russian girlfriend.\n\nA court in June found Black guilty of stealing 10,000 roubles ($104) from the woman and threatening to kill her, sentencing him to three years and nine months in prison.\n\nAnother American citizen, Joseph Tater, was sentenced to 15 days in jail last August for 'petty hooliganism' after he was alleged to have abused staff at a Moscow hotel, which he denied.\n\nHe should have been released after serving the small sentence, but Russian news agencies say he is now being investigated on a more serious charge of assaulting a police officer, which carries up to five years in prison.\n\nA court in September denied his appeal to be released from pre-trial detention and he remains in custody.\n\nAnd, in one of the most high-profile cases, American citizen Eugene Spector - who was born in Russia and then moved to the US - was charged last August with espionage.\n\nHe had served as chairman of the board of Medpolymerprom Group, a company specializing in cancer-curing drugs, state media said.\n\nSpector had pleaded guilty to helping bribe an assistant to an ex-Russian deputy prime minister. It was not clear how he pleaded to the espionage charge.\n\nNow, those prisoners hope Trump's efforts to renew diplomatic ties with Russia will see them freed in the coming months.\n\n'The exchange shows the importance of keeping lines of communication open with Russia, despite the deep challenges in our bilateral relationship,' a CIA spokeswoman told the WSJ following Karelina's release.\n\n'While we are disappointed that other Americans remain wrongfully detained in Russia, we see this exchange as a positive step and will continue to work for their release.","summary":"President Donald Trump met with Ksenia Karelina, 33, a ballerina he helped free from a Russian prison, inside the Oval Office on Monday.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-14681175/Trump-ballerina-Ksenia-Karelina-Russian-prison.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/05/06/00/98062171-0-image-a-14_1746486055333.jpg","video":"https://videos.dailymail.co.uk/video/mol/2025/04/11/2201628616021852796/1024x576_MP4_2201628616021852796.mp4","publish_date":"2025-05-06 00:05:30","author":"Editor,Melissa Koenig","authors":["Editor","Melissa Koenig"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":0.042},{"id":318193850,"title":"Penny Wong pushes back on Donald Trump’s film tariffs","text":"The country’s top diplomat has pushed back against Donald Trump’s proposal to slap 100 per cent tariffs on foreign-produced movies, saying Australia and the US benefit from making “great films together”.\n\nIn a social media post on Monday, the US President claimed the “Movie Industry in America is DYING a very fast death” because of foreign incentives and declared it “a National Security threat”.\n\nThe threat has sent a shockwave through Australia’s film industry, which has benefited greatly from a surge in American interest since the Covid-19 pandemic largely due to lower production costs.\n\nForeign Minister Penny Wong said on Tuesday the relationship worked both ways.\n\n“We’ve got Australian actors who work on American films,” she told the ABC.\n\n“We have American films which are filmed here in Australia. We have collaboration between our artists in the creative industries.\n\n“The collaboration is a good thing, so let’s not get in the way of that.”\n\nUS Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, a staunch advocate of Mr Trump’s tariffs, reposted he boss’s remarks and said: “We’re on it.”\n\nBut Screen Producers Australia – the film industry’s peak body – said it was “unclear” how Mr Trump’s proposal would work.\n\n“At this stage, it is unclear what this announcement means in practice or how it will be applied and implemented,” SPA chief executive Matthew Deaner said in a statement.\n\n“There are many unknowns for our industry, but until we know more, there’s no doubt it will send shockwaves worldwide.”\n\nTony Burke, who holds the arts portfolio in addition to home affairs, has also pledged Labor “will be standing up unequivocally for the rights of the Australian screen industry”.\n\nSenator Wong also said the Albanese government would be pushing to ink a new trade agreement with the European Union in a bid to build resilience in the face of Mr Trump’s tariffs.\n\nAxing a $5.2bn tax on luxury vehicles is reportedly on the table.\n\n“Obviously, the EU free trade agreement would be an important part of that trade diversification,” Senator Wong told ABC radio.\n\n“So we will keep working on that because if we’re a trading nation, we don’t want to be part of trade barriers because it’s not good for us.\n\n“It’s an act of economic self-harm, so of course we’ll engage with the European Union and others.”","summary":"Australia’s top diplomat has pushed back at Donald Trump’s latest tariffs targeting a key Australian industry.","url":"https://thewest.com.au/news/penny-wong-pushes-back-on-donald-trumps-film-tariffs-c-18596996","image":"https://images.thewest.com.au/publication/C-18596996/9b2b249332d555ccbeac60eb822ad3962423eef0-16x9-x0y0w2048h1152.jpg?imwidth=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-05-06 00:05:22","author":"Joseph Olbrycht,Joseph Olbrycht-Palmer","authors":["Joseph Olbrycht","Joseph Olbrycht-Palmer"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"au","sentiment":0.095},{"id":318194590,"title":"Penny Wong pushes back on Donald Trump’s film tariffs","text":"Camera IconForeign Minister Penny Wong has pushed back against US President Donald Trump’s latest tariff proposal.

The administration previously froze $2.2 billion in federal grants to Harvard, and Trump is pushing to strip the school of its tax-exempt status.\n\nHarvard has pushed back on the administration’s demands, setting up a closely watched clash in Trump’s attempt to force change at universities that he says have become hotbeds of liberalism and antisemitism.\n\nIn a press call, an Education Department official said Harvard will receive no new federal grants until it “demonstrates responsible management of the university” and satisfies federal demands on a range of subjects. It applies to federal research grants and not federal financial aid students receive to help cover tuition and fees.\n\nThe official spoke on condition of anonymity to preview the decision on a call with reporters.\n\nThe official accused Harvard of “serious failures” in four areas: antisemitism, racial discrimination, abandonment of rigor and viewpoint diversity. To become eligible for new grants, Harvard would need to enter negotiations with the federal government and prove it has satisfied the administration’s demands.\n\nThe administration has demanded a series of changes to campus policy, including reforms to crack down on protesters and pursue more viewpoint diversity among faculty.\n\nIn a letter Monday to Harvard’s president, Education Secretary Linda McMahon accused the school of enrolling foreign students who showed contempt for the U.S.\n\n“Harvard University has made a mockery of this country’s higher education system,” McMahon wrote.\n\nHarvard’s president has previously said he will not bend to government’s demands. The university sued to halt its funding freeze last month.\n\nHarvard’s suit called the funding freeze “arbitrary and capricious,” saying it violated its First Amendment rights and the statutory provisions of Title VI of the Civil Rights Act.\n\nThe Trump administration said previously that Harvard would need to meet a series of conditions to keep almost $9 billion in grants and contracts.\n\nThe school in Cambridge, Massachusetts, has an endowment of $53 billion, the largest in the country.

It was a dangerous time, and people were frequently “disappeared.”\n\nI never thought I’d be watching similar scenes play out here in America.\n\nIn March, President Donald Trump invoked the archaic Alien Enemies Act to disappear over 100 Venezuelan immigrants to a megaprison in El Salvador. This law was passed in 1798 as part of the Alien and Sedition Acts, a suite of highly partisan statutes designed to target immigrants under the guise of national security. Thomas Jefferson allowed three of the four laws to expire, but the Alien Enemies Act remains.\n\nThe Alien Enemies Act grants the president sweeping powers to detain or deport immigrants based solely on nationality during times of war. The law has been used just three times: in the War of 1812, World War I, and, infamously, in World War II to imprison Japanese-Americans in internment camps — a shameful chapter in our history.\n\nTrump has illegally used this law now to sidestep due process. The men sent to El Salvador under the Alien Enemies Act were given no trials, no judges and no opportunities to argue their case. Their families were given no information on their whereabouts.\n\nThe Trump administration has admitted in court that at least one of the men imprisoned, Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a Maryland father with protected legal status, was wrongfully deported. The administration called it an “administrative error,” but despite this admission — and a unanimous Supreme Court order — it is still refusing to bring him back. Kilmar and these men remain in prison with no end in sight. That is morally reprehensible.\n\nThat is why I’ve stood with my colleagues to call on Trump to bring Kilmar Abrego Garcia home, and I’ve helped introduce legislation that would finally repeal the Alien Enemies Act.\n\nTrump would like to make this a debate about deporting criminals. But it’s really about our fundamental rights. The Constitution requires the government to give every one of us the right to fairly contest allegations.\n\nIf the government can abuse its authority and deport anyone without due process, then none of us are safe. Trump is moving us closer and closer to that reality.\n\nJust recently, three children — all U.S. citizens — were deported to Honduras. One of the children, a 4-year-old with Stage 4 cancer, was deported without medication. If this innocent child who has committed no crime is not returned to the U.S., he has been handed a death sentence, as his medical team is in the United States. The presiding judge — a Trump appointee — said it’s their “strong suspicion that the government just deported a U.S. citizen with no meaningful process.”\n\nIn March, Rümeysa Öztürk, a graduate student, was walking down the street when plainclothes ICE agents ambushed her and took her from her school in Massachusetts to a detention center in Louisiana. It appears her detention is due to an op-ed she co-authored in her school paper.\n\nIf these instances sound unlawful and un-American, it’s because they are.\n\nTrump is working to weaponize immigration enforcement to create an increasingly brutal and unaccountable system — one where anyone could be mistreated, denied justice and left without recourse. No American voted to give up rights or access to due process when Trump won last year.\n\nWe all must stand united against these continued attacks on immigrants, our Constitution and the rule of law.\n\nJuan Vargas has represented the San Diego border region in the House of Representatives since 2013.","summary":"We all must stand united against these continued attacks on immigrants, our Constitution and the rule of law.","url":"https://www.ocregister.com/2025/05/05/juan-vargas-trump-administrations-hostility-to-due-process-is-un-american/","image":"https://www.ocregister.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/SUT-Z-EL-SALVADOR-3.jpg?w=1024&h=682","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-05-06 00:02:14","author":"Juan Vargas","authors":["Juan Vargas"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.135},{"id":318193728,"title":"You won't believe what the GOP wants to call its awful budget bill","text":"Congressional Republicans have reportedly settled on the name of their legislation that will slash Medicaid benefits in order to pay for President Donald Trump's tax cuts that overwhelmingly benefit the richest Americans.\n\nAccording to Punchbowl News, the bill will be called the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, a play on Trump’s demand that Republicans put all of his policy proposals into “ONE BIG BEAUTIFUL BILL.”\n\nPunchbowl reported that Republicans had been toying with calling the legislation the Renewing the American Dream Act.

CQ Brown Jr. They also have fired the only two women serving as four-star officers, as well as a disproportionate number of other senior female officers.In the earlier rounds of firing, Hegseth said the eliminations were “a reflection of the president wanting the right people around him to execute the national security approach we want to take.”As Pentagon chief, Hegseth has touted his efforts to root out any programming or leadership that endorses diversity in the ranks, tried to terminate transgender service members and begun sweeping changes to enforce a uniform fitness standard for combat positions.In a memo announcing the cuts Monday, Hegseth said they would remove “redundant force structure to optimize and streamline leadership.” He said the aim was to free the military from “unnecessary bureaucratic layers.”Adding to the turmoil in the Pentagon, Hegseth in recent weeks has dismissed or transferred multiple close advisers, tightly narrowing his inner circle. He also has been facing questions from both Democrats and Republicans about his handling of sensitive information and use of the Signal messaging app.There are about 800 general officers in the military, but only 44 of those are four-star general or flag officers. The Army has the largest number of general officers, with 219, including eight four-star generals.The number of general officer positions in the military is set by law. Members of Congress were not provided with the advance notification they normally would receive on the cuts but were given a “very brief alert” this afternoon, according to a congressional staffer, who spoke on condition of anonymity to provide details not made public.The cuts were first reported by CNN.RELATED STORY | 'Troops Hate It': Hegseth criticizes and cuts Women, Peace, and Security programThe Pentagon is under pressure to slash spending and personnel as part of the broader federal government cuts pushed by Trump and ally Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency.Hegseth last week ordered a sweeping transformation of the Army to “build a leaner, more lethal force,” including merging or closing headquarters, dumping outdated vehicles and aircraft, slashing as many as 1,000 headquarters staff in the Pentagon and shifting personnel to units in the field.Also last week the Army confirmed that there will be a military parade on Trump’s birthday in June, as part of the celebration around the service’s 250th birthday.

Zohran Mamdani is polling above nearly all the moderate candidates in his party’s mayoral primary race — and raising the most money — with the backing of the Democratic Socialists of America (DSA). Experts told the Daily Caller News Foundation that the race could shape left-wing politics across the country by reinvigorating DSA candidates who grew increasingly unpopular over the past four years.\n\n“I do think that the DSA candidate is absolutely capable of winning,” Chris Talgo, a research fellow for the conservative Heartland Institute, told the DCNF.\n\nTalgo co-authored a report on the growing momentum of far-left campaigns in 2024, which found that 94% of candidates endorsed by the DSA and two other socialist organizations won with an average margin of 49 points. Talgo said New York’s mayoral race will be a “test case” for Democrats’ future ideological leanings.\n\n“Are they going to go more toward the center, or are they going to go even more toward the left?” Talgo told the DCNF. “I think that these kind of races are going to … give us an interesting, you know, picture into that.”\n\n“If Mamdani became mayor, the significance for the future of socialist politics would rise immeasurably, probably in direct inverse proportion to the fortunes of NYC if his policies were implemented,” author and conservative commentator Seth Barron told the DCNF. Barron primarily covers New York City politics and culture.\n\n“To have the nation’s biggest city run by an avowed advocate of radical wealth distribution, defunding the police, and the arrest of Israeli citizens for ‘war crimes’ would demonstrate that, at least in blue cities and states, the future of socialism is rosy,” Barron said.\n\nMamdani polled at 22% for the June primary falling behind former Democratic New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo’s 45% in a Honan Strategy Group survey conducted in April. The DSA endorsed Mamdani in October, and his poll numbers jumped by 13 percentage points between January and April.\n\nMamdani and Cuomo’s campaigns did not respond to multiple requests for comment. (RELATED: Democrats Running For Mayor In Crime-Ridden New York City Suddenly Back Cops)\n\n “Defunding the police is ultimately about creating balance. As Mamdani puts it, it isn’t about eliminating ‘everything that creates harm in our society,’ or an invitation for chaos. Rather, it’s a chance to respond to problems differently than we have.” https://t.co/dWfz0eacN8 — Zohran Kwame Mamdani (@ZohranKMamdani) June 5, 2020 \n\nIf Mamdani wins the primary, he would face New York City Mayor Eric Adams, who is running for reelection on an independent ticket and fell behind the state representative, Cuomo and Democratic candidate Brad Lander in recent polling. Adams was elected as a Democrat in 2022 but lost the support of some in his party after criticizing former President Joe Biden’s handling of illegal immigration.\n\nThe top two candidates represent different generations competing for power among Democrats.\n\nMamdani was born in Uganda but raised in New York as the son of an “anti-colonialism” scholar at Columbia University. The candidate is focused on bringing numerous “free” programs to New Yorkers, such as a $30 minimum wage, de-prioritizing the role of local police and arresting Israel’s prime minister if he ever enters the city.\n\nCuomo was born in Queens, supports Israel, wants to grow the police force and is more than twice Mamdani’s age. His economic solutions include tax relief and increasing “affordable housing” among other more moderate ideas.\n\nWhile Mamdani’s campaign has raised more than $8 million in private contributions and public matching funds, neither Cuomo nor Adams has received public funding due to the state’s procedural hurdles. Cuomo’s campaign will reportedly qualify for public matching funds by May 12 if it corrects a paperwork error, while Adams was denied matching funds due to suspicions stemming from Biden-era federal corruption charges against him that were dropped by the Trump administration.\n\n“The Democrat party right now is still in somewhat of a civil war, and I think that the momentum and the money is on the side of the much more progressive [candidates],” Talgo said.\n\nBeyond endorsing Mamdani, the DSA has also fundraised for his campaign and conducted voter outreach ahead of the election. One New York DSA leader said in February that the group hopes to “transcend the rightward shift we have seen among New Yorkers” after several counties swung toward President Donald Trump in 2024 by single and double-digit margins.\n\nDSA’s national and New York City chapters did not respond to multiple requests for comment.\n\nA Mamdani win would also counter losses DSA experienced during Biden’s term, which included declines in membership and campaign victories tied to financial struggles and internal disputes.\n\nDSA endorsed fewer candidates and ballot initiatives in 2024 than in any year since 2019, data from the group’s website shows. The ballot initiatives touched on workers’ rights, abortion, alleged police overreach and other issues.\n\nStill, only 45% of the 2024 campaigns won, a decrease from over 50% between 2020 and 2023, according to the DCNF’s analysis of the data. The analysis excluded DSA campaigns promoting a “noncommitted” vote as well as two elections that resulted in runoffs.\n\nThe number of DSA members in good standing peaked in April 2021 at about 79,000 before sliding down by more than 9,500 over the course of the Biden years, according to data posted online by affiliates of DSA. By last December, the number was 69,155 but has since increased by more than 7,000 since January. Some bumps in membership appeared to correspond with the anti-police Black Lives Matter protests that erupted in summer 2020, Trump’s first term in office and the Supreme Court’s 2022 decision to overturn the national abortion precedent Roe v. Wade. \n\nWith the gradual decline in membership came a lack of dues payments, resulting in financial problems and occasional reports of infighting.\n\nDSA leaders passed a resolution in early 2024 to lay off 12 full-time employees to account for a projected budget deficit of more than $1.2 million. A flurry of debate about DSA’s future has ensued since the onset of its “budget crisis,” with members accusing one another online of mismanaging the organization — or claiming DSA’s nonprofit fundraising arm is too “conservative” for their movement. Some members wrote that leaders ignored signs of the budgetary gaps early on and that “little was done to prevent” the financial shortfall until it became serious.\n\nAntisemitism and the Israel-Hamas war have been another dividing line among different groups of Democrats. Mamdani and DSA have especially drawn criticism for their anti-Israel stances, with local activists accusing Mamdani of currying the favor of antisemites.\n\nDemocratic Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York also criticized DSA in 2023 for staging protests in support of Palestinians shortly after Hamas’s Oct. 7, 2023 terrorist attacks. The DSA pressured Ocasio-Cortez and former Democratic Rep. Jamaal Bowman of New York, both DSA members, to take stronger stances against Israel by issuing statements and temporarily declining to endorse them for reelection. DSA’s New York City chapter proposed a measure to censure Ocasio-Cortez for hosting a panel on antisemitism but ultimately rejected it.\n\nRegardless, Talgo told the DCNF that Mamdani’s framing of economic problems as a war on the middle class could appeal to many New Yorkers struggling with growing costs of living. Housing costs, for example, have risen faster than incomes across the city from 2019 to 2023, according to the Fiscal Policy Institute.\n\n“Although I completely, completely disagree with the DSA’s policies, I will at least give them some credit that they are addressing some of those core concerns,” Talgo said. He said establishment Democrats’ years of dismissing populist presidential candidates, such as DSA-backed Democratic Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont, may come back to bite them. \n\n“When you look at, like, [Ocasio-Cortez] and Bernie going on their anti-‘oligarch’ tour, they’re the ones who are drawing the big crowds,” Talgo said.\n\nTalgo said one could also blame a Mamdani victory on Cuomo being a “very flawed candidate” due to his history of scandals and sexual harassment allegations, which prompted his resignation from office. Such a win would still embolden the same leftist factions whose radicalism has been blamed for Trump’s reelection, analysts told the DCNF.\n\n“[Mamdani’s] victory would vindicate the DSA as the central force within the Democrat Party,” Barron said. “It would pave the way for the nomination of AOC in 2028, formalizing her unofficial status as the foremost Democrat in the United States.”\n\nAll content created by the Daily Caller News Foundation, an independent and nonpartisan newswire service, is available without charge to any legitimate news publisher that can provide a large audience.

It has also led to the US dollar weakening substantially since the president’s ‘Liberation Day’.\n\n“If the US dollar drops in value, the return for foreign investors falls, making them less attractive.\n\n“Trump has also openly posed the idea of firing Fed chair Jerome Powell.\n\n“Foreign markets do not like that level of interference in what is meant to be an independent agency.\n\n“Again, this could very easily dissuade investors.”\n\nWhen it comes to trade negotiations between the US and Asian trade partners, some are already recognising their position as large bondholders.\n\nAs part of his ‘Liberation Day’ tariff spree, Mr Trump imposed tariffs of 24% on Japan.\n\nSpeaking on Friday, Japan’s finance minister Katsunobu Kato said the country’s massive holdings of US treasuries can be “a card on the table” in trade negotiations with the Trump administration.\n\nHowever, it’s not just US government debt that is maturing in 2025.\n\nAccording to S&P Global, between 2024 and 2026, US companies face a $2.3tn maturity wall — $1.8tn of which is scheduled for 2025 and 2026.\n\nSimilar to the US government, much of this debt was also issued in the era of 0% interest rates. This made refinancing at the time practically free.\n\nNow, however, the interest rate environment tells a different story.\n\nThese two phenomena occurring at the same time can put major financial pressure on markets.\n\nIn addition to driving up competition for investor capital, both the US government and companies may have to offer higher yields to attract investors.\n\nFor companies operating on tight margins, this could make it more difficult to roll over debt, which may lead to downsizing, the impacts of which — for a global company — could be felt across the transatlantic pond.\n\nMeanwhile, the US government also risks rising interest expenses, which could further exacerbate its already increasing fiscal deficits.\n\nThe next 12 months will be extremely difficult to predict, Mr Finn added.\n\nTime will tell how well the US will weather its mounting debt walls, but what is certain is that Trump will have to focus on more than just tariffs and a pride war with China may be the least of his concerns.","summary":"US government debt has ballooned in the past decade to more than $36tn (€31.84tn), achieved by running budget deficits every year since the early 2000s.","url":"https://www.irishexaminer.com/business/economy/arid-41626636.html","image":"https://www.irishexaminer.com/cms_media/module_img/9217/4608979_1_seoimage1x1_iStock-1441906670.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-05-05 23:56:00","author":"Emer Walsh,Irishexaminer.com","authors":["Emer Walsh","Irishexaminer.com"],"language":"en","source_country":"ie","sentiment":-0.358},{"id":318193264,"title":"Israel has no choice but to take control of Gaza and at last destroy Hamas","text":"Israel has called up tens of thousands of reservists in advance of plans to capture — and this time hold — all of the Gaza Strip, should Hamas refuse to agree to a cease-fire by May 16.\n\nThe escalation is understandable; indeed, almost inescapable: What other choice does Israel have? \n\nHamas won’t agree to any serious deal short of a permanent end to the war that allows it to survive and maintain its death-grip on Gaza — which it has vowed time and again to use to stage more Oct. 7, 2023-style attacks on the Jewish state.\n\nSo Israel can’t permanently halt the war with Hamas in control of Gaza, yet no other nation has offered a realistic plan to end the Hamas threat, nor to govern Gaza.\n\nSo Jerusalem is giving Hamas one last chance to agree to permanently surrender control of the strip, or to get a temporary cease-fire if it frees the last hostages, including an American, Edan Alexander.\n\nIf Hamas doesn’t bite by the time President Donald Trump wraps up his Middle East trip next week, the IDF will once again order evacuations, starting in Gaza’s north, and systematically clear and retake control of all Gaza. \n\nThe Jewish state would then hold those areas indefinitely to prevent Hamas’ return — though a government spokesman says the plan isn’t meant to produce a permanent occupation.\n\nOperation Gideon’s Chariots will roll out gradually, but won’t stop until Jerusalem controls all of Gaza — and Hamas has no place to hide.

Garber.\n\nThe Trump administration earlier froze $2.2 billion in multi-year federal grants, and President Donald Trump wants to revoke the Ivy League school's tax-exempt status if it doesn't make the changes. Also, the Trump administration has threatened to not allow international students to attend.\n\nAn Education Department official told reporters on Monday that Harvard will receive no new federal grants, of more than $1 billion, until it \"demonstrates responsible management of the university\" and satisfies federal demands on a range of subjects.\n\n\"Those investigations would need to lead to resolution agreements that bring Harvard back into compliance with federal law. They could also open up a broader negotiation if they were interested in accelerating that,\" the official said.\n\nThe unnamed person accused Harvard of \"serious failures\" in four areas: anti-Semitism, racial discrimination, abandonment of rigor and viewpoint diversity.\n\nThey include banning masks at campus protests, requiring merit-based hiring and admissions, and giving foreign students' discipline records.\n\nIt does not apply to federal financial aid students to help cover tuition and fees, including Pell Grants. Tuition at Harvard, which has an enrollment of more than 21,000, was more than $56,000 this year and the total cost of attendance was almost $83,000, according to its financial aid website.\n\nHarvard announced last month that families with incomes of $200,000 and less will not pay tuition.\n\nHarvard sued the Trump administration on April 21 after rejecting a letter on April 11 outlining the demands.\n\nThe 51-page lawsuit, which was filed in federal court of its home state of Massachusetts, asks a judge to block the funding freeze, arguing it is \"unlawful and beyond the government's authority.\"\n\n\"All told, the tradeoff put to Harvard and other universities is clear: Allow the Government to micromanage your academic institution or jeopardize the institution's ability to pursue medical breakthroughs, scientific discoveries, and innovative solutions,\" Harvard's lawyers wrote.\n\nGarber, in a letter addressed to the Harvard community with the lawsuit announcement, said the actions \"have stark real-life consequences for patients, students, faculty, staff, researchers, and the standing of American higher education in the world.\"\n\nHarvard is the oldest higher education schools in the United States, founded in 1636.\n\nThe school's endowment is valued at $53.2 billion, but it's considered a long-term investment and not a slush fund.\n\nThe Trump administration also has paused funding at other private schools, including Columbia, Cornell, Brown and Northwestern.","summary":"Harvard won't receive any new federal grants until it meets demands from the Trump administration, the Education Department said Monday.","url":"https://www.upi.com/Top_News/US/2025/05/05/Education-Department-wont-allow-new-Harvard-grants-until-meets-demands/7671746486341/","image":"https://cdnph.upi.com/ph/st/th/7671746486341/2025/upi/60ab73c1851f1f1feceadcc083d490f0/v1.2/Education-Department-to-block-new-grants-for-Harvard-until-policies-change.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-05-05 23:55:13","author":"Allen Cone","authors":["Allen Cone"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.373},{"id":318192506,"title":"US jury’s $30m verdict brings hope for Cuban exiles over confiscated land","text":"Cayo Coco in Cuba. Photograph: City Image/Alamy\n\nFrom The Guardian, UK\n\nLawsuit brought under Helms-Burton could spur others pursuing compensation for property seized by Castro\n\nLong before it became one of Cuba’s most popular tourist destinations in the 1990s, the small island of Cayo Coco, with its pristine beaches and powdery white sands, attracted a different kind of clientele.\n\nInspired by its unspoiled beauty, and his observations of shack-dwelling fishermen scratching out a meager living, Ernest Hemingway set scenes from two of his most famous books there, including the 1952 classic The Old Man and the Sea.\n\nThen came the giant all-inclusive mega-resort hotels that have proliferated in recent decades along the island’s northern coast, and brought in millions of desperately needed dollars for a largely destitute Cuban government.\n\nNow, there’s a bitterly contested multimillion-dollar lawsuit that has implications for the descendants of dozens of Cuban exiles in the US who have been fighting for decades for compensation for land and property seized following Fidel Castro’s 1959 communist revolution.\n\nMario Echeverría, head of a Cuban American family in Miami that says it owned Cayo Coco, and saw it stolen from them in Castro’s aggressive land reforms, won a $30m verdict this month from the travel giant Expedia after a two-week trial. The jury said Expedia, and subsidiaries Orbitz and hotels.com, illegally profited from promoting and selling vacation packages at hotels there.\n\nThe rare lawsuit was one of the first brought under Title III of the 1996 Cuban Liberty and Democratic Solidarity Act, also known as the Helms-Burton Act. The act was designed to finally open a legal pathway for such compensation claims, but was suspended by successive presidents until Donald Trump made the decision to activate it in 2019.\n\nThe intention was to deter US and international companies from investing in Cuba by exposing them to potentially huge financial penalties for conducting business there.\n\nFor Echeverría, who reminisced about his grandmother tending the beachfront at Cayo Coco in a moving Spanish-language interview with UniVista TV earlier this year, the verdict is not the end of the story.\n\nHe and his family may never see a penny after Federico Moreno, the district court judge overseeing the case, paused the award and set a further hearing for August seeking “specific evidence” that the family itself legally acquired the land on Cuba’s independence from Spain in 1898.\n\nThe only other previously adjudicated Helms-Burton penalty, a $439m illegal tourism ruling in 2022 against four major cruise lines operating from Havana, was overturned last year. An appeals court said a claim by descendants of the original dock owners was essentially out of time.\n\nA handful of other cases, meanwhile, have stalled – including one by the oil giant Exxon Mobil that claims various Cuban state corporations are profiting from its confiscated land.\n\nBut those at the forefront of the fight for justice say the Expedia case in particular brings hope to scores of others pursuing compensation for property they insist was illegally seized.\n\n“There are 45 other suits that are making their way through the courts, there may be more new ones after this verdict also,” said Nicolás Gutiérrez, president of the National Association of Sugar Mill Owners of Cuba.\n\nGutiérrez is a Miami-based consultant who has worked with hundreds of dispossessed exiles and their families, in addition to pursuing amends for his own family’s lost houses, farmland and mills.\n\n“We are hopeful that this is just the beginning. We waited 23 years, from 1996 to 2019, to have the key provisions of Title III be put into effect by President Trump, and now there’s new generations of families in these cases I’m working with,” he said, adding:\n\n“The old guys back then are gone, but in many cases their kids have continued with their crusade. Some have given up, some have been sort of reactivated along the way, and it’s not only justice for the families, it’s like a historic and moral commitment. We sacrificed and built up prosperity in Cuba that was taken for no good reason.”\n\nGutiérrez also believes that desperate conditions on the island could hasten the fight.\n\n“They never recovered from the pandemic with tourism. The sugar, nickel and rum industries, and tobacco to a lesser extent, have been run into the ground. Remittances and trips are going to be further cut by the Trump administration, and that’s really what they’re relying on now,” he said.\n\n“They don’t even have electricity for more than a couple hours a day.\n\n“Someday, relatively soon, there will be a big change, and if a future Cuba wants to attract the serious level of investment it will need to dig itself out of the hole that this totalitarian nightmare has dug over the last 66 years, what better way to inspire confidence than to recognize the victims of the illegal confiscations?”\n\nAnalysts of Cuban politics say the government is taking notice of the Helms-Burton actions. These analysts are also looking into the ramifications of Trump’s existing and planned crackdowns designed to increase financial pressure on the communist regime.\n\n“There are people looking at the impact it’s having overall in the investment scenario in the island, and apparently it’s having some chilling effect,” said Sebastian Arcos, director of Florida International University’s Cuban Research Institute.\n\n“The most important chilling effect is the fact that the Cuban economy is going nowhere, and everybody knows it.\n\n“The government stole properties from many thousands of Cubans, and what we’re seeing now is a systematic attempt of many of the people who inherited these claims from their families not to try to recover, because it’s impossible to recover anything as long as the Cuban regime is there, but at least to punish the regime financially for doing what they did.”\n\nIt’s unclear if Echeverría’s family will become the first to actually receive compensation, but with stretches of Cayo Coco’s northern coastline now consumed by the concrete of almost a dozen super-resorts offering more than 5,000 hotel rooms, they accept the land will not be returned.\n\nTheir attorney, Andrés Rivero, said in a statement: “This is a major victory not only for our client, but also for the broader community of Cuban Americans whose property was wrongfully taken and has been exploited by US companies in partnership with the Cuban communist dictatorship.\n\n“We are proud to have played a role in securing justice under a law that had never before been tested before a jury.”\n\nExpedia did not reply to specific questions. A spokesperson said in a statement to the Guardian: “We are disappointed in the jury’s verdict, which we do not believe was supported by the law or evidence. We believe the court was correct to decline immediate entry of judgment and look forward to the court’s consideration of the legal sufficiency of the evidence presented to the jury.”\n\nCan you help us hit our support goal?17,577 of 50,000 readers\n\nFacts are sacred.

Speaking to reporters from the Oval Office on May 5, Trump claimed he only saw the image the previous evening and suggested artificial intelligence might have created it. The image gained further attention after the official White House account reshared it online. Catholics criticized the post as insensitive, particularly during mourning for Pope Francis, whose funeral Trump attended last week.\nTrump Says ‘I Had Nothing to Do With It’\nWhen asked about the image, Trump said, \"I had nothing to do with it. Somebody made up a picture of me dressed like the pope and they put it out on the internet. That's not me that did it, I have no idea where it came from, maybe it was AI, but I know nothing about it, I just saw it last evening.\"\nTrump addressed the issue during an impromptu press exchange, where he maintained that the post was not his doing and dismissed the criticism as media-driven outrage.\nMelania Trump’s Reaction: ‘Isn’t That Nice?’\nDuring the same exchange, President Trump shared First Lady Melania Trump’s reaction to the viral AI-generated image showing him dressed as the pope. “Actually, my wife thought it was cute. She said, ‘Isn’t that nice?’” Trump told reporters in the Oval Office. He followed up with a lighthearted remark about the papacy and marriage, saying, “Actually, I would not be able to be married, though. To the best of my knowledge, pope's aren't big on being married, are they? Not that we know of.” Trump used the moment to downplay the controversy surrounding the image, framing it as harmless humor.\nTrump Criticizes Media, Says 'Catholics Loved It'\nResponding to questions about Catholic backlash and the AI pope image posted from a government account, President Trump shrugged off the controversy with trademark flair. “They can’t take a joke,” he told reporters. “The Catholics loved it.” When pressed further, he rolled his eyes and added, “Give me a break. Somebody did it in fun—it’s fine. You have to have a little fun, don’t you?” Trump turned the solemn into the satirical, suggesting the outrage was more media frenzy than faithful fury. “It’s just a picture,” he quipped, “not a papal decree.”\nVice President Vance Defends The Post As A Joke\nVice President JD Vance, a practicing Catholic, also addressed the controversy. After Bill Kristol, editor-at-large of The Bulwark, questioned him in an X post asking, \"Are you fine with this disrespect and mocking of the Holy Father?\" Vance responded directly.\n\"As a general rule, I'm fine with people telling jokes and not fine with people starting stupid wars that kill thousands of my countrymen,\" Vance said, referencing Kristol’s past support for the Iraq invasion.\nThe image remains a point of contention among religious groups and political observers, while officials continue to debate whether such posts belong on official government accounts.\nAlso Read: PM Modi Lauds IPL Prodigy Vaibhav Suryavanshi As ‘Son of Bihar’, Watch","summary":"The image remains a point of contention among religious groups and political observers, while officials continue to debate whether such posts belong on official government accounts.","url":"https://www.newsx.com/world/trump-responds-to-ai-pope-image-uproar-i-had-nothing-to-do-with-it/","image":"https://www.newsx.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Donald-trump-4.webp","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-05-05 23:47:29","author":"Aishwarya Samant","authors":["Aishwarya Samant"],"language":"en","source_country":"in","sentiment":-0.029},{"id":318192714,"title":"Barbie-maker Mattel to hike U.S. prices as tariffs raise costs","text":"Barbie-maker Mattel withdrew its annual financial targets on Monday and said it would increase prices for some products in the United States as Trump administration’s sweeping tariffs bump up input costs for the toymaker.\n\n“Given the volatile macroeconomic environment and evolving U.S. tariff landscape, it is difficult to predict consumer spending and Mattel’s U.S. sales in the remainder of the year and holiday season,” it said.\n\nThe U.S. represents about half of Mattel’s global toy sales, and the company imports about 20% of its goods sold in the country from China. Mattel said it would reduce imports into the U.S. from China to below 15% by 2026.\n\nThe U.S. and China have hiked tariffs on each other’s goods to more than 100% since U.S. President Donald Trump took office earlier this year, in a full-on trade war between the world’s two biggest economies that has upended global supply chains.\n\n“There’s no question that tariffs are creating disruption in the industry. Many companies have stopped production and shipping to the U.S. as a result of tariffs from China. We do support the Toy Association’s advocacy for zero tariffs on toys,” Mattel CEO Ynon Kreiz told Reuters.\n\nThe company will also make changes to its supply chain to reduce China-sourced product in the U.S. For instance, it was ramping up production of the UNO card game in India to serve the U.S. market and was increasing flow from China towards international customers, Kreiz said.\n\nApart from China, Mattel imports products such as Barbie dolls and Hot Wheels toys from Indonesia, Malaysia and Thailand, which were also hit by reciprocal tariffs from the Trump administration in early April before being paused for 90 days.\n\nMattel expects about $270 million in incremental costs from tariffs this year, beginning in the July quarter, but mitigating actions are expected to fully offset those costs, outgoing finance chief Anthony DiSilvestro said on a post-earnings call.\n\nThe company said it would also temper promotions to save costs and increased costs-savings target for the year to $80 million from $60 million.\n\n“The toymaker is squarely in the crosshairs of Trump’s tariff war,” said Zak Stambor, senior analyst at Emarketer.\n\nMattel had earlier targeted 2025 adjusted earnings per share between $1.66 and $1.72 and annual net sales growth of 2% to 3%.\n\nIn contrast, peer Hasbro, which sources about half of its toys and games sold in the U.S. from China, maintained its annual forecasts in April, helped by strength in its gaming segment.\n\nKreiz, however, said the second quarter was off to a strong start with demand growing.\n\nMattel’s first-quarter net sales of $827 million beat analysts’ average estimate of $786 million, according to data compiled by LSEG. It also posted a smaller-than-estimated adjusted loss per share of 3 cents.\n\nThe company bought back shares worth $160 million during the quarter ended March 31 and maintained its $600 million repurchase target for 2025.","summary":"Barbie-maker Mattel withdrew its annual financial targets on Monday and said it would increase prices for some products in the United States as Trump administration&#8217;s sweeping tariffs bump up input costs for the toymaker.","url":"https://www.staradvertiser.com/2025/05/05/breaking-news/barbie-maker-mattel-to-hike-u-s-prices-as-tariffs-raise-costs/","image":"https://www.staradvertiser.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/web1_2025-05-05T200911Z_1590238313_RC295R9G2A7H_RTRMADP_3_MATTEL-RESULTS.JPG","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-05-05 23:47:00","author":"Reuters","authors":["Reuters"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.11},{"id":318201740,"title":"‘Romania First’ – Bucharest’s Pro-EU Premier Announces His Resignation","text":"Romania’s pro-EU Prime Minister Marcel Ciolacu on Monday announced his resignation, deepening political turmoil a day after a far-right candidate topped the first round of a tense presidential vote rerun.\n\nFar-right EU critic George Simion topped Sunday’s election first round, while the ruling coalition’s candidate narrowly lost out to Bucharest’s mayor, Nicusor Dan, for the second spot.\n\nWith the ruling coalition’s candidate Crin Antonescu knocked out of the running, Ciolacu would likely have been replaced by the new president, who appoints the premier.\n\nCiolacu said his party would leave the ruling coalition but would probably hold on until after the election run-off, scheduled for May 18 and which is being closely watched by Brussels and Washington.\n\nRomania, which borders war-torn Ukraine, is an EU and NATO member. \n\nHis Social Democrats (PSD) party leaving the ruling coalition “implicitly leads to my resignation as prime minister”, Ciolacu, 57, told reporters after a party meeting.\n\n“We saw how Romanians voted yesterday (Sunday), which means that the ruling coalition has no legitimacy, at least in this formula,” he added.\n\nOnce the PSD leaves the governing coalition, it would no longer have a parliamentary majority.\n\nCiolacu said that his party’s ministers would discuss with their coalition partners whether or not they would remain in the government on an interim basis.\n\n“The future president would have changed me anyway,” Ciolacu said.\n\n‘Worst possible moment’\n\nCiolacu’s resignation “comes at the worst possible moment, adding political risks and fears” in a country already struggling with the highest deficit in the EU, 9.3 percent at the end of 2024, according to political analyst Radu Magdin. \n\n“The political system will re-stabilize after we have political clarity as regards the new president of Romania,” Magdin told AFP, adding that the resignation “gives a boost to Simion who is better than Dan at capitalizing on political chaos.”\n\nCiolacu said his party would not publicly support either Simion or Dan, instead asking their party supporters to “vote as they wish, according to their own conscience”.\n\nThe Social Democrats’ coalition partners said they were supporting Dan.\n\nIn Sunday’s first round, Simion, who leads the nationalist AUR party, gained almost 41 percent of votes, double the score of the pro-EU Dan, an independent.\n\nDan narrowly edged out Antonescu.\n\nAUR and other far right parties hold around a third of the votes in parliament.\n\nCiolacu has ruled out forming a government with AUR as long as he is party president.\n\nA far-right victory in the second round could mark a shift in the country’s foreign policy. The president represents Romania at EU and NATO summits and can veto EU votes.\n\nCampaigning on a vow to put Romania first, Simion, a fan of US President Donald Trump, has criticized “Brussels’ unelected bureaucrats’, accusing them of having meddled in the Romanian elections.\n\nIn December, Romania’s constitutional court scrapped the presidential ballot after far-right politician Calin Georgescu unexpectedly won the first round.","summary":"Ciolacu’s resignation “comes at the worst possible moment, adding political risks and fears” in a country struggling with the highest deficit in the EU.

However, there was no need to use nuclear weapons, the Russian leader said. “And I hope that this will not be necessary in the future either.”\nRussia has sufficient forces and means to achieve everything that was necessary for Moscow in the military operation that began in 2022, Putin said, referring to the year the Kremlin launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine.\nPutin and his leadership have repeatedly threatened to use nuclear weapons against Ukraine and its allies during the war.\nThe US government was under the impression that Moscow could be preparing to drop a nuclear bomb in the autumn of 2022, according to reports. Washington delivered a stern warning to Russia through diplomatic channels at the time.\nThe test attack with a new Russian medium-range missile on the Ukrainian city of Dnipro in November 2024 is also considered a nuclear threat.\nThree people were killed by Ukrainian attacks in the Kursk border region, local governor Alexander Khinshtein said on Monday.\nTwo women died when a Ukrainian drone hit a car carrying five people, the official wrote on Telegram.

Jeff Merkley, D-Ore., was among the Democratic senators who reportedly spoke out during the Thursday meeting and told The New York Times the World Liberty-MGX deal is “a selling of influence” and “a massive form of corruption we haven’t witnessed.” Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., told the paper “no senator” should support the Senate bill, because it “will make it easier for the president and his family to line their own pockets.”\n\nMerkley and Warren asked the U.S. Office of Government Ethics on Monday to open a probe into the MGX-World Liberty deal, arguing that if it’s completed it “would represent a staggering conflict of interest, one that may violate the Constitution and open our government to a startling degree of foreign influence and the potential for a quid pro quo that could endanger national security.” The senators noted the chairman of MGX is Sheik Thanoun Bin Zayed Al Nahyan, the National Security Advisor of the United Arab Emirates.\n\nKey Background\n\nThe MGX-World Liberty Deal was unveiled last week at the Token2049 convention in Dubai by Trump’s son, Eric Trump, and Zach Witkoff, a founder of World Liberty Financial and the son of Trump’s Middle East envoy, Steve Witkoff. Trump began promoting World Liberty Financial in August, when the purpose of the venture was a bit murky, though it’s since solidified itself as a crypto dealer with activities that have repeatedly raised conflict-of-interest alarms, including Trump policy announcements that have briefly boosted the value of its stock. It has multiple foreign investors, The New York Times reported recently, noting that they would be prohibited from donating to Trump’s campaign under federal law. A spokesperson for World Liberty, David Wachsman, said “it would be false, absurd and dangerous to suggest that investments or partnerships with World Liberty Financial were conducted as some sort of political quid pro quo,” adding that “never has an investor or partner requested any political favoritism. Nor would we ever entertain such a possibility.”\n\nFurther Reading\n\nTrump Crypto Deals Provoke Senate Backlash and Calls for Investigation (New York Times)\n\nSecret Deals, Foreign Investments, Presidential Policy Changes: The Rise of Trump’s Crypto Firm (New York Times)\n\nTrump Sons’ Deals on Three Continents Directly Benefit the President (New York Times)\n\nFollow me on Twitter.
