Here's what we know (and don't know)","text":"A large number of mysterious drones have been reported flying over parts of New Jersey and the East Coast in recent weeks, sparking speculation and concern over who sent them and why.\n\nNew Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy wrote to President Joe Biden asking for answers. New Jersey's new senator, Andy Kim, spent Thursday night on a drone hunt in rural northern New Jersey, and posted about it on X.\n\nMurphy and law enforcement officials have stressed that the drones don't appear to be a threat to public safety, but many state and municipal lawmakers have nonetheless called for stricter rules about who can fly the unmanned aircraft.\n\nThe FBI is among several agencies investigating and has asked residents to share videos, photos and other information they may have about the drones.\n\nWhat's the deal with the drones in New Jersey?\n\nDozens of witnesses have reported seeing them in the state starting in November.\n\nAt first they were spotted flying along the scenic Raritan River, which feeds the Round Valley Reservoir, the state's largest aquifer, about 50 miles (80 kilometers) west of New York City.\n\nBut soon sightings were reported statewide, including near the Picatinny Arsenal, a military research and manufacturing facility, and over President-elect Donald Trump's golf course in Bedminster.\n\nThe aircraft have also recently been spotted in coastal areas.\n\nRepublican U.S. Rep. Chris Smith said a Coast Guard commanding officer told him a dozen drones closely followed a Guard lifeboat near Barnegat Light and Island Beach State Park in Ocean County over the weekend.\n\nFederal officials offer assurances that drones don't pose a threat\n\nThe growing anxiety among some residents is not lost on the Biden administration, which has faced criticism from Trump for not dealing with the matter more aggressively.\n\nIn a call with reporters Saturday that was organized by the White House, senior officials from the FBI, Pentagon, FAA and other agencies sought to assure people that the drones are not a national security or public safety threat or the handywork of a malicious foreign actor.\n\nAn FBI official, who spoke on condition of anonymity under ground rules set by the White House, said the public concern is understandable but added, \"I think there has been a slight overreaction.\"\n\nPentagon spokesperson Maj. Gen. Pat Ryder said Thursday that the military's initial assessment after consulting with the Department of Homeland Security and the National Security Council — that the drones are not of foreign origin — remained unchanged.\n\nNew Jersey congressman wants the military to take action\n\nA New Jersey congressman has urged the Pentagon to authorize the use of force to bring down one or more drones to try to figure out who deployed them.\n\nThe objects could be downed over the ocean or in an unpopulated area on land, Smith said Saturday at a news conference.\n\n\"Why can't we bag at least one of these drones and get to the bottom of it?\" Smith said.\n\nRep. Jeff Van Drew, another Republican Jersey Shore-area congressman, has also called for the military to shoot down the drones.\n\nMonmouth County Sheriff Shaun Golden said people should not take it into their own hands to shoot down drones, which would break state and federal laws.\n\nDrones have been spotted over New York City\n\nDrone sightings have now been reported in New York, where a permit is required, and Mayor Eric Adams said the city was investigating and collaborating with New Jersey and federal officials.\n\nThe runways at Stewart International Airport — about 60 miles (100 kilometers) north of the city — were shut down for about one hour Friday night because of drone activity in the airspace, Gov. Kathy Hochul said.\n\n\"This has gone too far,\" she said in a statement.\n\nThe governor called on Congress to strengthen the FAA's oversight of drones and give more investigative authority to state and local law enforcement.\n\n\"Extending these powers to New York State and our peers is essential,\" she said. \"Until those powers are granted to state and local officials, the Biden administration must step in by directing additional federal law enforcement to New York and the surrounding region to ensure the safety of our critical infrastructure and our people.\"\n\nAre these drones dangerous?\n\nThe White House has said that a review of the reported sightings shows that many of them are actually manned aircraft being flown lawfully, echoing the opinion of officials and drone experts.\n\nThe federal Homeland Security Department and FBI also said in a joint statement they have no evidence that the sightings pose \"a national security or public safety threat or have a foreign nexus.\"\n\nAssemblywoman Dawn Fantasia, who was briefed by the Department of Homeland Security, said the reported drones have been up to 6 feet (1.8 meters) in diameter and sometimes travel with their lights switched off. This is much larger than those typically flown by drone hobbyists, and she said they appear to avoid detection by traditional methods such as helicopter and radio.\n\nWho sent the drones?\n\nAuthorities say they do not know.\n\nThe FBI, Homeland Security and state police are investigating the sightings. Authorities say they don't know if it is one drone that has been spotted many times or if there are multiple aircraft being flown in a coordinated effort.\n\nSpeculation has raged online, with some expressing concerns that the drone or drones could be part of a nefarious plot by foreign agents.\n\nOfficials stress that ongoing state and federal investigations have found no evidence to support those concerns, but Rep. Smith on Saturday echoed such speculation.\n\n\"The elusive maneuvering of these drones suggests a major military power sophistication that begs the question whether they have been deployed to test our defense capabilities — or worse — by violent dictatorships, perhaps maybe Russia, or China, or Iran, or North Korea,\" he said.\n\nPentagon spokeswoman Sabrina Singh said Wednesday that the aircraft are not U.S. military drones.\n\nWhat have officials said about the sightings?\n\nTrump has said he believes the government knows more than it's saying. \"Let the public know, and now. Otherwise, shoot them down!!!\" he posted on his social media site.\n\nSen. Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut said Thursday that the drones should be \"shot down, if necessary.\"\n\n\"We should be doing some very urgent intelligence analysis and take them out of the skies, especially if they're flying over airports or military bases,\" Blumenthal said.\n\nExperts, however, warn not to shoot at anything in the sky.\n\nTrisha Bushey, 48, of Lebanon Township, New Jersey, lives near Round Valley Reservoir where there have been numerous sightings and said she doesn't believe the assertion that the drones aren't a risk to public safety.\n\n\"How can you say it's not posing a threat if you don't know what it is?\" she said. \"I think that's why so many people are uneasy.\"\n\nAre drones allowed in New Jersey?\n\nThe flying of drones for recreational and commercial use is legal in the state, but it is subject to local and Federal Aviation Administration regulations and flight restrictions.\n\nIn New York City, a permit is required to take off or land an unmanned aircraft.\n\nOperators must be FAA-certified.\n\nHave drones been spotted anywhere else?\n\nSightings also have been reported in Virginia and elsewhere.\n\nTwo people said they spotted an aircraft Thursday night near Virginia Beach that was unlike any other they've seen.\n\nThe object was over the ocean, and they watched as it slowly moved over an Army National Guard facility, John Knight told The Virginian-Pilot.\n\n\"It was definitely different,\" said Knight, who took videos of what he thinks was a drone the size of a small truck.\n\n\"It flew like a helicopter but made no noise,\" he added.\n\nThe Virginia National Guard did not have any aircraft operating in the area Thursday night, according to spokesperson A.A. \"Cotton\" Puryear. Its leadership is aware of the incident and it's under investigation.\n\nAnother military installation in the area is Naval Air Station Oceana Dam Neck Annex. NAS Oceana, the East Coast master jet base in Virginia Beach, is aware of recent reports of sightings in the area and is coordinating with federal and state agencies to ensure the safety of its personnel and operations, Katie Hewett, public affairs officer, said Friday by email.\n\nKnight submitted the videos Thursday night to the FBI tip line.\n\nIn Massachusetts, 10 to 15 drones were reported hovering over a home Thursday night in Harwich on Cape Cod. A resident told police they were bright and she observed them for more than an hour.\n\nEarlier that evening, an off-duty police officer in the same town noticed similar activity near a public safety complex, police said. The information was forwarded to the FBI and Massachusetts State Police.\n\nDrones were also spotted last month in the U.K. The U.S. Air Force said several small unmanned aircraft were detected near four military bases in England that are used by American forces.","url":"https://mb.com.ph/2024/12/15/mystery-drone-sightings-keep-happening-in-new-jersey-here-s-what-we-know-and-don-t-know","image":"https://images.mb.com.ph/production/DRONE_SIGHTINGS_86e2e23c9a_272dccae86.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-12-15 01:24:03","author":"Trisha Bushey","authors":["Trisha Bushey"],"language":"en","source_country":"ph","sentiment":-0.075},{"id":273252314,"title":"Ukrainian drones strike Russia as Kyiv reels from consecutive massive air attacks","text":"KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — Ukrainian drone strikes on southern Russia killed a 9-year-old boy and set fire to a major oil terminal, officials said Saturday, the day after Moscow launched a massive aerial attack on its neighbor that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said was one of the heaviest bombardments of the country's energy sector in the nearly three-year war.\n\nThe boy died when a drone struck his family's home outside Belgorod, a Russian city near the border with Ukraine, local Gov. Vyacheslav Gladkov reported on Saturday morning on the Telegram messaging app. His mother and 7-month-old sister were hospitalized with injuries, Gladkov said.\n\nHe posted photos of what he said was the aftermath of the attack, showing a low-rise house with gaping holes in its roof and front wall flanked by mounds of rubble.\n\nElsewhere in southern Russia, Ukrainian drones overnight hit a major oil terminal in the Oryol region, sparking a blaze, Ukraine's General Staff reported. Photos published by the General Staff and on Russian Telegram news channels showed huge plumes of smoke engulfing the facility, backlit by an orange glow.\n\nOryol Gov. Andrey Klychkov confirmed that a Ukrainian drone strike set fire to a fuel depot. He said later the blaze had been contained and that there were no casualties.\n\nRussia's Defense Ministry on Saturday claimed its forces shot down 37 Ukrainian drones over the country's south and west the previous night.\n\nRussia pummels Ukrainian energy targets\n\nThe Ukrainian strikes came a day after Russia fired 93 cruise and ballistic missiles and almost 200 drones at its neighbor, further battering Ukraine's energy infrastructure, around half of which has been destroyed during the war. Rolling electricity blackouts are common and widespread, and Zelenskyy charged Friday that Moscow is \"terrorizing millions of people\" with such assaults.\n\nAccording to Ukraine's air force, Russia kept up its drone attacks on Saturday, launching 132 across Ukrainian territory. Fifty-eight drones were shot down and a further 72 veered off course, likely due to electronic jamming, it said.\n\nThe Russian Defense Ministry said its forces used long-range precision missiles and drones on \"critically important fuel and energy facilities in Ukraine that ensure the functioning of the military industrial complex.\"\n\nThe strike was in retaliation for Wednesday's Ukrainian attack using U.S.-supplied the Army Tactical Missile System, or ATACMs, on a Russian air base, it said.\n\nKyiv's Western allies have provided Ukraine with air defense systems to help it protect critical infrastructure, but Russia has sought to overwhelm the air defenses with combined strikes involving large numbers of missiles and drones called \"swarms.\"\n\nRussia has held the initiative this year as its military has steadily rammed through Ukrainian defenses in the east in a series of slow but steady offensives.\n\nBut uncertainty surrounds how the war might unfold next year. U.S. President-elect Donald Trump, who takes office next month, has vowed to end the war and has thrown into doubt whether vital U.S. military support for Kyiv will continue.\n\nNorth Koreans reportedly in combat in Kursk\n\nZelenskyy said Saturday that a \"significant number\" of North Korean troops were being deployed by Moscow in assaults in Russia's southern Kursk region, where Ukrainian troops have held on following a stunning cross-border incursion this summer.\n\nIn a televised address, Zelenskyy said that North Korean soldiers have so far not entered the fight on Ukrainian soil, but claimed they are already taking \"noticeable\" losses.\n\nElsewhere, Ukrainian officials reported that Russian shelling on Friday and overnight killed at least two civilians and wounded 14 others in front-line areas Ukraine's south and northeast.","url":"https://mb.com.ph/2024/12/15/ukrainian-drones-strike-russia-as-kyiv-reels-from-consecutive-massive-air-attacks","image":"https://images.mb.com.ph/production/AP_24348604778385_4746bca05e.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-12-15 01:24:03","author":"Associated Press","authors":["Associated Press"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"ph","sentiment":-0.199},{"id":273252050,"title":"How Many of Those Thousands of Illegal Chinese Young Men Biden Let into America Are Drone Operators?","text":"At least 36,000 individuals from China, many of whom are young men of military age, have entered America illegally since President Joe Biden repealed the secure border left to him by his predecessor and successor in the Oval Office, Donald Trump.\n\nLet's not forget that hundreds of individuals known to be terrorists have also entered the country illegally as a result of Biden's throwing the border doors wide open to all comers. And those numbers only account for the individuals known to have crossed into the U.S. illegally.\n\nThere's also this fact: nobody knows with any certainty how many more — hundreds, thousands, tens of thousands? — individuals associated with terrorist groups and/or nations in addition to China that seek to destroy the United States of America are among the legions of \"got-aways.\"\n\nThat statement is based on official U.S. Customs and Border Protection data published by the House Committee on Homeland Security, which observed in an October report that:\n\n\"Not only are more suspected terrorists illegally crossing our borders, but apprehensions of Chinese nationals illegally crossing the border have also increased over 1,000 percent under the Biden-Harris administration, compared to FY2017-FY2020. These encounters have included individuals with ties to the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) and the People’s Liberation Army, according to information obtained by [DHS Committee] Chairman [Mark] Green (R-Tenn.).\"\n\nWhich raises an obvious question:\n\nHow much longer must the American people wait for President Joe Biden, Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin, outgoing FBI Director Christopher Wray, and the impeached Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to come clean about why they seem to be doing nothing about those thousands of drone sightings around and above U.S. military and intelligence facilities here and abroad?\n\nAs Amazon founder and Washington Post owner Jeff Bezos recently told the journalists who are driving the credibility of his newspaper into a bottomless pit, \"reality is the undefeated champion.\"\n\nHere are five facts that collectively point to a dangerous reality that can explain those drone sightings that began a month ago:\n\nThe drone sightings are virtually all above, around or in the near-vicinity of key U.S. military and intelligence facilities, including particularly important ones in New Jersey, Virginia, California and Nevada.Many of the drones observed by thousands of citizens, as well as local and state law enforcement officials, are large devices, often described by those observers as being \"as big as an SUV.\" Amateurs don't operate such devices for fun.Such drones can be designed and operated as extremely dangerous reconnaissance and subversion devices, gathering and transmitting mountains of electronic, digital and photographic intelligence at far less cost than spy satellites and other traditional methods.Collecting information about facilities such as nuclear missile silos, naval port operations, counter-intelligence locations, supply depots, and research and manufacturing assets is by definition done for the purpose of targeting for destruction.China has, since the Clinton administration in the mid-1990s, flouted export controls of sensitive U.S. defense and other technology, conducted a staggering variety of intelligence operations against this country, notably including hacking operations penetrating dozens of government agency systems, as well as an unknown number of spies gathering classified documents. Check out this Newsweek summary of a tiny slice of the most recent examples of Chinese subversion.Biden allowed a Chinese intelligence balloon to traverse the entire U.S., spending days above countless military facilities including Minuteman nuclear missile and SAC manned bomber bases. For reasons known only to him, Biden didn't order the balloon to be shot down until it passed beyond the East Coast.\n\nTaken together, this fact pattern points to a reasonable and terrifying possibility — these drones in the U.S. are being operated for intelligence purposes by Chinese illegals and abroad by Chinese intelligence assets.\n\nThis country has never before knowingly experienced anything like the balloon and drone invasions of sovereign U.S. airspace seen during the Biden administration. The leadership of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) that controls Beijing and the Peoples Liberation Army (PLA) knows that the man who becomes president on Jan. 20, 2025 would react totally differently from Biden.\n\nWhich suggests that the massive number of drone sightings is evidence of a mission that must be completed before that date.\n\nThat leaves us with a stark question: what happens after the mission is finished, but before Trump becomes commander-in-chief?","url":"https://pjmedia.com/marktapscott/2024/12/14/are-those-thousands-of-illegal-chinese-young-men-biden-let-in-drone-operators-n4935139","image":"https://media.townhall.com/cdn/hodl/2018/271/d0f873f9-8292-48cd-b28c-a0528749c79c.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-12-15 01:22:03","author":"Mark Tapscott","authors":["Mark Tapscott"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.121},{"id":273251396,"title":"'We're not going back:' Calgary postal workers defiant in face of impending back-to-work order","text":"CFIB President Dan Kelly on Friday welcomed the prospect of Canada Post staff being ordered back to work but said the strike has done irreparable damage both to business and the federal crown corporation.\n\n“The cost of the strike to small business has been profound,” he said in a statement Friday.\n\n“Nearly three-quarters of small firms report they will reduce their dependence on Canada Post going forward, making it even more challenging for the corporation to operate in the future.”\n\nAttending Saturday’s rally was Alberta Federation of Labour President Gil McGowan, who read a letter he’s sent to federal government and Canada Post officials that emphasized the constitutional right to strike that’s been acknowledged by Labour Minister MacKinnon.\n\n“So which is it — do workers have the right to strike or not?” said McGowan.\n\n“This is sending a message to all employers that all they have to do is stall negotiations.”\n\nHe called for the firing of Canada Post’s board of directors.\n\nU.S. president-elect Donald Trump has expressed a desire to privatize the U.S. Postal Service which lost $9.5 billion in the last fiscal year.\n\nBut pushing that change would likely trigger a backlash from rural, heavily Republican-voting jurisdictions that rely on the federal service.\n\nX: @BillKaufmannjrn","url":"https://calgarysun.com/news/local-news/were-not-going-back-calgary-postal-workers-defiant-in-face-of-impending-back-to-work-order","image":"https://smartcdn.gprod.postmedia.digital/calgaryherald/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/canada-post-strike-121424-gya-10.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-12-15 01:16:03","author":"Bill Kaufmann","authors":["Bill Kaufmann"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"ca","sentiment":-0.344},{"id":273251394,"title":"ABC agrees to give $15 million to Donald Trump’s presidential library to settle defamation lawsuit","text":"Trump, Stephanopoulos and ABC executives signed the settlement agreement on Friday.\n\nThe document bore Trump’s bold, distinct signature and an electronic signature with the initials GRS in a space for Stephanopoulos’ name.

(AP) — Blake Horvath outplayed Bryson Daily at quarterback, accounting for 311 yards and four touchdowns to help Navy beat No. 22 Army 31-13 on Saturday.\n\nHorvath threw for 107 yards and two touchdowns and ran for 204 yards and two TDs. Navy (9-3) snapped a two-game losing streak in the series. The teams entered this Army-Navy matchup with a combined 19 victories, the most in the 125-game history of this storied clash.\n\nDaily, who finished sixth in the Heisman Trophy vote this year, threw a touchdown pass of his own, but he was intercepted three times. Army (11-2) fell behind 14-0 in the second quarter and never completely recovered. The Black Knights were coming off a victory over Tulane in the American Athletic Conference title game — the first league title in program history.\n\nIn front of a crowd that included President-elect Donald Trump at the Washington Commanders’ home stadium in Landover, Navy took the opening kickoff and drove 65 yards, reaching the end zone on a 1-yard run by Horvath.\n\nDaily, who had been intercepted only once all season, had a pass picked off in the second quarter by Dashaun Peele. The Midshipmen took advantage of a short field, going ahead 14-0 on an 18-yard pass from Horvath to Brandon Chatman. Daily answered with a TD pass of his own — 23 yards to Hayden Reed.\n\nBoth teams were run heavy as expected, but they did combine for 25 pass attempts — including what was probably the biggest play of the game in the third quarter. After a field goal made the score 14-10, Horvath connected with Eli Heidenreich, who broke free up the left sideline for a 52-yard touchdown.\n\nThat was Horvath’s 13th touchdown pass of the season and Heidenreich’s sixth TD reception — both tying school records.\n\nDaily missed an open Casey Reynolds in the end zone early in the fourth, and Army settled for a field goal.\n\nNavy then faced fourth down near midfield, but Landon Robinson — normally a nose guard — ran 29 yards on a fake punt. Although Robinson fumbled at the end of the play, the Midshipmen were able to recover.\n\nHorvath’s 1-yard scoring run made it 28-13, and Daily was intercepted twice more before the end of the game.\n\nNavy, which won its first six games this season and also spent time in the Top 25, completed a sweep of Air Force and Army to win the Commander-In-Chief’s Trophy for the first time since 2019.\n\nThis was the first of two straight Army-Navy games in Navy’s home state of Maryland. Next year’s edition is in Baltimore.\n\nThe takeaway\n\nArmy: It’s been a historic season for the Black Knights in some ways, but anyone who follows this rivalry knows how empty the losing team feels. Daily threw for 65 yards and ran for only 52.\n\nNavy: In an impressive year for both of these teams, the Midshipmen earn the ultimate bragging rights. It’s a defining moment for Brian Newberry in his second season as Navy’s coach.\n\nPoll implications\n\nArmy is in danger of dropping out of the Top 25, although the Black Knights will have a chance to win a bowl before the next poll comes out.\n\nArmy: Faces Louisiana Tech in the Independence Bowl on Dec. 28. That’s a new opponent for the Black Knights after Marshall backed out of the game.\n\nNavy: Faces Oklahoma in the Armed Forces Bowl on Dec. 27.\n\nGet poll alerts and updates on the AP Top 25 throughout the season.

Terrified West Coast residents sound the alarm as crisis spreads to four more states","text":"Mysterious drones are terrorizing US cities from coast to coast as the eerie objects have now been spotted in California, Massachusetts, Florida, Wyoming, Maryland, New York and New Jersey.\n\nNow, the inexplicable issue has now reached a boiling point as President Joe Biden remains silent, refusing to address the mounting crisis, fueling country-wide fear and confusion.\n\nTerrified residents on the West Coast, specifically in Riverside County, California, are the latest to have spotted the flying objects in the sky after questions were first raised about drones in New Jersey airspace. \n\nDamon Angel, who lives in Temecula, told NBC LA that he has seen drones flying in the sky above his home on three nights this week - describing them as 'the size of a car.'\n\nAngel revealed the concerning flying objects are 'dead silent' and unlike any amateur drones he's come across before. \n\nHe said: 'It's kind of crazy. It's something that not a lot of people can believe because it's so outlandish. It's the size of a car.\n\n'I've played with drones as a kid and I've had the little, tiny square ones or whatever. But these ones aren't like that, and so they're just giant triangles with lights on them that are dead silent.' \n\nAnother West Coast local said that he saw 'several' drones in the airspace on November 29, which he described as being eerily similar to those seen in New Jersey this week. \n\nThe countrywide sightings are causing mass hysteria as witnesses take to social media to share the peculiar sightings, begging for answers from government officials, and from the Biden administration, who has remained silent.\n\nOne concerned Massachusetts resident said 'We've got drones!' after seeing five drones fly over her home on Friday. 'When I came out he was filming probably five of them, and it was freezing cold, we just stood there in awe.'\n\n'Drones have been flying over my house every single night all night in the Bay Area in California for weeks!! I didn't think anything until it was out all over the place! I have so many videos! WTF is going on??!,' one user on X wrote.\n\n'Over 100 drones are flying over New Jersey, New York, and Pennsylvania. The drones are the size of SUV'S and came from the Atlantic Ocean and are flying over critical infrastructure and military bases,' wrote another.\n\n'Just random, multiple drones flying around, roughly 45 minutes to an hour every night,' Wyoming's Niobrara County Sheriff Randy Starkey, recalled as he watched some of the flights himself.\n\n'Not really sure where they're from, what they were doing or why they were doing it. We watched them go straight up and do some maneuvers and disappear,' Starkey added. \n\nThe increased airspace activity, believed to be occupied by the peculiar drones, has even forced airports to temporarily shut down.\n\n'Last night, the runways at Stewart Airfield were shut down for approximately one hour due to drone activity in the airspace. This has gone too far,' New York's Governor, Kathy Hochul said in a statement on Saturday.\n\nEarlier this week, both the governor of New York and the former governor of Maryland took to social media demanding transparency and clarity on who is controlling the mysterious roaming objects.\n\nHochul also called upon Congress and President Biden to pass a bill that would reform legal authorities to strengthen the FAA's oversight of drones and would extend counter-UAS activities to select state and local law enforcement agencies.\n\n'Extending these powers to New York State and our peers is essential. Until those powers are granted to state and local officials, the Biden Administration must step in by directing additional federal law enforcement to New York and the surrounding region to ensure the safety of our critical infrastructure and our people,' she said.\n\nMeanwhile, Larry Hogan, the former governor of Maryland, posted on social media on Friday that he had seen 'what appeared to be dozens of large drones in the sky' above his home. \n\n'The public is growing increasingly concerned and frustrated with the complete lack of transparency and the dismissive attitude of the federal government,' Hogan said in a post on X that included a video of shining lights in the sky. \n\nPresident-elect Donald Trump echoed their sentiments, demanding the aircrafts be shot down until the government can inform the public.\n\n'Mystery Drone sightings all over the Country. Can this really be happening without our government's knowledge. I don't think so!' Trump wrote on Truth Social.\n\n'Let the public know, and now. Otherwise, shoot them down!!!'\n\nHowever, the FBI and the Department of Homeland Security has since issued a statement claiming there is no national security or public safety threat posed by the drone sightings, many of which are 'manned aircraft, operating lawfully.'\n\nOver the last few weeks, federal officials have received nearly 5,000 tips, regarding the suspicious drones, however, the FBI has said only 100 of the tips have been 'worthy of further investigation.'\n\nUsing interviews with witnesses and the copious footage, investigators have determined that at least some of the roaming objects were misidentified as drones, according to officials from the FBI, Department of Homeland Security and Federal Aviation Administration.\n\nThe federal officials have since confirmed drone sightings over military bases in New Jersey, including Picatinny Arsenal, but have no evidence the devices were operated by a foreign government or authority. \n\nLocal governments can however impose their own restrictions on drone use, thought it is generally not illegal to fly drones in most locations, with the exception of restricted zones like some military sites. \n\nAccording to a statement released earlier this week by President Biden's national executory spokesperson, John F. Kirby, the investigation had not yet turned up any illegal activity.\n\n'To the contrary, upon review of available imagery, it appears that many of the reported sightings are actually manned aircraft that are being operated lawfully,' Kirby said on Thursday.","summary":"Mysterious drones are terrorizing US cities from coast to coast as the eerie objects have now been spotted in California, Massachusetts, Florida, Wyoming, Maryland, New York and New Jersey.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-14193771/Drone-crisis-sightings-California-New-Jersey-states.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2024/12/15/00/93159275-0-image-m-15_1734222777837.jpg","video":"https://videos.dailymail.co.uk/video/mol/2024/12/13/3420625007199435563/1024x576_MP4_3420625007199435563.mp4","publish_date":"2024-12-15 00:50:14","author":"Editor,Samantha Rutt","authors":["Editor","Samantha Rutt"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.334},{"id":273248252,"title":"President-Elect Trump Taps Familiar Name to Head Special Envoy Team","text":"President-elect Donald Trump is continuing to choose top members of his incoming administration, and his latest announcement is both a familiar name and a former employee of his.\n\nRic Grenell has worked in politics and government for decades, including a stint in the first Trump administration. Now, the incoming president has tapped him to serve as Presidential Envoy for Special Missions.\n\n\"Ric will work in some of the hottest spots around the World, including Venezuela and North Korea,\" Trump's announcement said.\n\nGrenell is a prominent Republican figure who has served in multiple high-profile roles within U.S. federal government and conservative political circles. Over the span of roughly two decades, he has become known as a staunch ally of Trump, as well as a seasoned strategist in foreign policy and national security communications.\n\nGrenell’s early career included communications advisory work for various Republican officials. During the George W. Bush administration, he served as the Director of Communications and Public Diplomacy for the U.S. Permanent Mission to the United Nations, working closely with then-U.N. Ambassador John Bolton. In that capacity, he played a key role in crafting and managing the public messaging around the U.S. mission and its foreign policy objectives.\n\nWhen President Trump took office, Grenell rose to greater national prominence. In 2018, he became the U.S. Ambassador to Germany, one of America’s most crucial diplomatic posts. His tenure in Berlin was marked by a direct, and at times confrontational, style. He pressed for stronger European action against Iranian financial networks and publicly encouraged German firms to reduce business ties with Iran. \n\nHe also urged Germany to meet NATO spending commitments and took a hard line on other transatlantic trade and security issues, frequently drawing attention for his blunt public statements.\n\nIn 2020, Grenell was tapped by President Trump to serve as Acting Director of National Intelligence, making him the first openly gay person to hold a Cabinet-level position. In that role, although brief, he oversaw the nation’s 17 intelligence agencies, pressed for the declassification of certain documents related to the Russia investigation, and pushed for greater transparency from the intelligence community.\n\nAfter leaving these posts, Grenell continued to serve as a trusted Trump ally and advisor, occasionally stepping into the media spotlight to comment on foreign policy and national security issues. Through these roles, Grenell solidified his standing as a high-profile conservative voice, closely aligned with the agenda and public style of the Trump administration.\n\nYou can read Trump's full statement announcing Grenell's appointment below.\n\nSTATEMENT FROM PRESIDENT DONALD J. TRUMP\n\nI am pleased to announce Richard Allen Grenell as our Presidential Envoy for Special Missions. Ric will work in some of the hottest spots around the World, including Venezuela and North Korea. In my First Term, Ric was the United States Ambassador to Germany, Acting Director of National Intelligence, and Presidential Envoy for Kosovo-Serbia Negotiations. Previously, he spent eight years inside the United Nations Security Council, working with North Korea, and developments in numerous other Countries. Ric has a B.A. from Evangel College and a M.P.A from Harvard. Ric will continue to fight for Peace through Strength, and always put AMERICA FIRST.","url":"https://redstate.com/joesquire/2024/12/14/president-elect-trump-taps-familiar-name-to-head-special-envoy-team-n2183228","image":"https://media.townhall.com/cdn/hodl/2020/248/aa234dbf-1b7d-4e36-bdff-6ea0ee593802.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-12-15 00:49:03","author":"Joe Cunningham","authors":["Joe Cunningham"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.295},{"id":273248254,"title":"HuffPo Gets Wrecked by Community Note for Hot Take on Daniel Penny at Army-Navy Game With Trump Team","text":"As we reported, President-elect Donald Trump, Vice President-elect JD Vance and a bunch of their incoming team were all at the Army-Navy game on Saturday. While there, they were met with an enthusiastic reception and cheers. \n\nAmong the people in attendance were Speaker of the House Mike Johnson, Vivek Ramaswamy, Elon Musk, Tulsi Gabbard, Mike Waltz, and Pete Hegseth. \n\nIn addition to the members of Trump's incoming administration, Daniel Penny was in attendance at Vance's invitation. Penny had just been acquitted in the death of Jordan Neely because Penny was trying to defend the people on the subway in New York City. \n\nThat's a nice picture. Penny's lead attorney Thomas Kenniff said he was \"very humbled and grateful to be invited.”\n\nREAD MORE: \n\nSo you had to know that the liberal media weren't going to leave that alone, that you were going to get a hot take from some outlet. \n\nIt was the Huffington Post that went all in on the hot take. They not only got ratioed, but they even earned a Community Note. The tweet got over 2.8 million views with virtually every comment ripping the media outlet's spin. \n\n\"The man accused of killing Jordan Neely, a homeless Black man, will sit beside the future president and vice president at the Army-Navy game,\" their tweet said.\n\nMany weighed in noting Penny had been acquitted in the case on Monday and that Neely wasn't just a \"homeless Black man.\" \n\nThe Community Note eviscerated the HuffPo, calling the tweet \"purposely misleading\" and noting Penny was \"acquitted by a jury of his peers.\" The note also explained Penny had immobilized someone who had threatened others including a mother and child. \n\nIs it any wonder that Americans no longer trust the media when they read things like this? We saw CBS' Lesley Stahl bemoaning how people no longer trusted the media and the media was \"hobbling.\" She ridiculously blamed Trump, not the media's own behavior. Maybe they should check themselves when they post things like this, Lesley? When you can't put such basic information out there -- or you wouldn't -- maybe there's a problem. \n\nJust a thought. \n\nREAD MORE: \n\nI took a look and most of the media outlets did seem to include \"acquitted\" in their titles.

ties","text":"Britain has become the 12th member of a trans-Pacific trade pact which includes Australia, Japan and Canada as it seeks to deepen ties in the region and build its global trade links after leaving the European Union.\n\nBritain announced last year it would join the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP) in its biggest trade deal since Brexit.\n\nThe accession means Britain will be able to apply CPTPP trade rules and lower tariffs with eight of the 11 existing members from Sunday - Brunei, Chile, Japan, Malaysia, New Zealand, Peru, Singapore and Vietnam.\n\nThe agreement enters into force with Australia on December 24, and will apply with the final two members - Canada and Mexico - 60 days after they ratify it.\n\nThe pact represents Britain's first free-trade deals with Malaysia and Brunei, but while it had agreements with the other countries, CPTPP provisions go further, especially in giving companies choices on how to use \"rules of origin\" provisions.\n\nThe CPTPP does not have a single market for goods or services and so regulatory harmonisation is not required, unlike the EU, whose trading orbit Britain left at the end of 2020.\n\nBritain estimates the pact may be worth STG2 billion ($A3.9 billion) a year in the long run - less than 0.1 per cent of GDP.\n\nBut in a sign of the strategic, rather than purely economic, implications of the pact, Britain can now influence whether applicants China and Taiwan may join the group.\n\nThe free-trade agreement has its roots in the US-backed Trans-Pacific Partnership, developed in part to counter China's growing economic dominance.\n\nThe US pulled out in 2017 under then-President Donald Trump and the pact was reborn as the CPTPP.\n\nCosta Rica is the next applicant country to go through the process of joining, while Indonesia also aims to do so.","summary":"The UK has cemented its biggest trade deal since Brexit, officially joining the

days after his acquittal in Jordan Neely’s subway death","text":"Daniel Penny, the former US Marine who was recently acquitted of the killing of New York City subway rider Jordan Neely, spent Saturday rubbing elbows with President-elect Donald Trump and Vice President-elect JD Vance at the annual Army-Navy football game in Maryland.\n\nThe death of the homeless Black street performer sparked outrage and demands for justice for homeless New Yorkers, while Penny — and some witnesses aboard the train — argued he was a danger to others onboard. The former Marine held Neely in a lethal chokehold for more than six minutes.\n\n“He was just threatening to kill people,” Penny told Fox News host Jeanine Pirro. “He was threatening to go to jail forever, to go to jail for the rest of his life.”\n\nPenny emerged as a heroic figure among Republican officials and on right-wing media. Following his acquittal, Vance invited him to the Army-Navy game.\n\n“Daniel’s a good guy, and New York’s mob district attorney tried to ruin his life for having a backbone,” Vance wrote on X earlier this week. “I’m grateful he accepted my invitation and hope he’s able to have fun and appreciate how much his fellow citizens admire his courage.”\n\nDonald Trump Jr shared a photo of Penny with Trump and Vance alongside the caption \"common sense reigns again!!!\"\n\nOn May 1, 2023, Penny placed Neely in a chokehold for nearly six minutes, continuing even as passengers on the train disembarked and Neely became motionless.\n\nPassengers became alarmed when Neely reportedly began yelling on the train that he needed food, water, shelter, a job, and that he was willing to die. He also reportedly threw trash at passengers.\n\nThe city’s medical examiner’s office concluded that Penny’s chokehold killed Neely due to compression of the neck.\n\nAfter Neely’s death, Penny was charged with manslaughter and negligent homicide.\n\nProsecutors dropped a more serious manslaughter after a Manhattan jury deadlocked on a verdict.\n\nOn December 9, he was acquitted on the remaining charge of criminally negligent homicide.\n\nBoth charges were felonies and carried the possibility of prison time.\n\nDuring his trial, a GiveSendGo fundraiser for Penny's legal defense became the second most successful campaign in the site's history, raising more than $3 million, thanks in large part to right-wing support.\n\nMeanwhile, protesters across New York City held events demanding justice for Neely’s death.\n\nThe family of Neely has since filed a wrongful death lawsuit accusing Penny of negligent contact, assault, and battery that caused injuries and ultimately death.\n\nNeely, who had previously worked a street performer and Michael Jackson impersonator, had a history of homelessness and schizophrenia. He had been previously accused of assaulting people at subway stations, but he did not touch anyone on the day he was killed.\n\nPenny joined several other incoming Trump administration officials and prominent Republicans in the president-elect’s suite.\n\nFormer Fox News host and defense secretary nominee Pete Hegseth; proposed director of national intelligence Tulsi Gabbard; House Speaker Mike Johnson; incoming Senate Majority Leader John Thune; Pennsylvania Senator-elect David McCormick; and Tesla and X CEO Elon Musk were also in attendance.","summary":"JD Vance invited ‘good guy’ Penny after he was found not guilty in the killing of the homeless New Yorker","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/deniel-penny-donald-trump-army-navy-game-b2664540.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2024/12/15/00/2024-12-15T001746Z_288367263_RC29PBAFRPZD_RTRMADP_3_USA-TRUMP.jpg?width=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-12-15 00:43:46","author":"Graig Graziosi","authors":["Graig Graziosi"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.297},{"id":273246632,"title":"Trump will put pressure on Ukraine, but not on Israel","text":"Having served at the Pentagon as undersecretary of defense under Donald Rumsfeld, Douglas Feith had played an active role in the “war on terror” after 9/11 and in particular in the run-up to the Iraq war in 2003. Today, in an interview with Kathimerini, the veteran analyst explains that US foreign affairs and the two wars – in the Middle East and Ukraine – were not decisive factors in Trump’s election victory. “I should note,” he adds, “that while China is the most important US national security issue, there was no major debate between the candidates on China policy.”\r\nFeith does not share beliefs that Trump will cause a rupture in the US relationship with the North Atlantic Alliance. “President Trump did not pull the US from NATO during his first term,” he says, “despite his harsh criticisms. His main complaint was that the allies are not spending enough on defense and are effectively free-riding on the United States.”\r\n“I should mention,” he points out, “a long line of US presidents before Trump made the same complaint, though in gentler language, and with less success. If the allies do more to share the burden of our common defense, President Trump can be expected to preserve the Alliance.”\r\nThe former undersecretary expects the re-elected president to stick to his special relationship with authoritarian regimes. “Mr Trump speaks in terms of realpolitik about authoritarian leaders. He does not care whether the leaders are authoritarian or democratic. That was true during his first term and is likely to remain true in his second term.”\r\n“Mr Trump,” says Feith, “has criticized the Biden administration as weak, so he will want to strengthen US deterrence. However, the key is whether he will greatly increase the investment in US deterrence.”\r\nWhile the re-elected president has stated that his intention is to end the two wars, he does not hold the same stance on Israel and Ukraine: “While he called on Israel to end the current war quickly, at the same time he clarified that Israel should do so by defeating its enemies. He has not said that about Ukraine. Ukrainian leaders worry that he is suggesting that he may pressure them to stop fighting before they can make a deal with Russia acceptable to them.”\r\nRegarding the relationship with Tehran, Feith comments that “Iran is a major problem for the US. Trump’s team has stated that the policy of maximum economic pressure will be revived and this will limit Iran’s ability to cause harm in the region, but it will not necessarily bring down Tehran’s regime or stop its nuclear weapons program.\r\n“Now that Israel has largely neutralized the threat from Iran’s proxies in Lebanon [Hezbollah] and destroyed Iran’s air defenses, President Trump can pressure Iran militarily with lower risk. We will have to wait to see if he wants to take military advantage of Iran’s vulnerability either by action directly against Iran or by action against the Houthis or other proxies.”","url":"https://www.ekathimerini.com/politics/foreign-policy/1256142/trump-will-put-pressure-on-ukraine-but-not-on-israel/","image":"https://www.ekathimerini.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/5f6a557d3f7acc7b93bbc9f849a27e5e_Stigmiotupo-2024-11-22-16-03-39-1-960x580.jpg?v=1734027128","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-12-15 00:39:04","author":"Athanasios Katsikidis","authors":["Athanasios Katsikidis"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gr","sentiment":-0.163},{"id":273248728,"title":"Trump picks ex-Ambassador to Germany Grenell as presidential envoy for special missions on N.

The real hero in this story is the person who called 911 at McDonald’s this morning.” “We do not kill people in cold blood to resolve policy differences or express a viewpoint,” Mr. Shapiro said.\r\n\nThat it took a Governor’s statement for people to see through a crime that happened in broad daylight is a telling sign. Regardless, observers and columnists attribute the sympathy pouring in for Mangione to the hatred reserved by the public for insurance companies.\r\n\nAmong other evidence recovered from the crime scene were bullet casings that had the words ‘Deny’, ‘Defend’ and ‘Depose’ written on them — a play on the phrase ‘Delay, Deny, Defend’, apparent tactics used by insurance firms to refuse claims. Also found in Mangione’s possession was a hand-written manifesto that criticised American companies’ corporate greed. “Frankly these parasites simply had it coming,” the note stated. UnitedHealthcare, however, has said Mangione was not its customer.\n\nAs police try and figure out if Mangione, who had a back problem and did correction procedure, acted out of self-interest or handed out “vigilante justice”, public support has swelled. His X account grew by more than 4,00,000 followers since the shooting, close to $31,000 was raised on GiveSendGo and “#FreeLuigi“ and “hot assassin” tags spread on social media — with engagement levels crossing what was witnessed during Donald Trump’s assassination attempt.\r\n\nIn Mangione, people found a “folk hero” who stood up for them against an industry that has long become a target of public ire. With an estimated market valuation of $560 billion, UnitedHealth, the parent company of UnitedHealthcare, ranks 19th on Forbes’ list of the world’s biggest companies. However, look past the insurance firm to see that the individuals involved are mired in a strange paradox.\r\n\nAccording to a Reuters report, Thompson had a modest working-class upbringing in rural Iowa. He graduated with a Bachelor’s degree in business administration from the University of Iowa in 1997. He is a certified public accountant and worked for six years at the accounting firm PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) before joining the United Group in 2004 as Director of Corporate Development, according to Forbes.\r\n\nThis is in stark contrast to the privileged upbringing of Mangione, someone believed to have carried out an “anti-capitalist” attack. Born into a prominent real-estate family in Baltimore, Mangione received Bachelor’s and Master’s degrees from the Ivy League University of Pennsylvania with an interest in computer science. He also served as head counsellor at a pre-college programme at Standford. The tuition fee at the high school he attended stands at $37,690 this year. He worked as a software engineer at TrueCar, an online marketplace based in California. For a brief while, he stayed at a co-living space in Honolulu, Hawaii, for $2,000 per month.\r\n\nSix months ago, he fell off the public radar with his mother filing a missing complaint in November.\r\n\nInvestigators are scouring his social media accounts for further clues and a concrete motive. Save for a goodreads account where he posted a review commending the “prescient” nature of Unabomber Ted Kaczynski’s Industrial Society and its future, Mangione’s political standing can only be described as heterodox at best.\r\n\nThe fact that Mangione’s motive and ideology have not been deciphered so far is worrisome for it then leaves only one plausible explanation. Much like the 2021 Capitol attack, it shows the public’s eroding trust in institutions. A fallout of that is the common man disregarding civic sense and becoming emboldened to take the law into his own hands. Mangione, who spoke about a “symbolic takedown” in his manifesto, then becomes a hero for those disenchanted with the system.","url":"https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/luigi-mangione-anti-capitalist-hero/article68986193.ece","image":"https://th-i.thgim.com/public/news/national/9unfqr/article68986195.ece/alternates/LANDSCAPE_1200/Luigi%20Mangione.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-12-15 00:37:03","author":"Adithya Narayan","authors":["Adithya Narayan"],"language":"en","source_country":"in","sentiment":-0.474},{"id":273245870,"title":"South Korea’s Yoon impeached by Parliament over botched attempt to impose martial law","text":"SEOUL - South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol was suspended from his duties after Parliament passed a Bill to impeach him, 11 days after his botched attempt to declare martial law sparked massive protests to oust him. \n\nMr Yoon’s future now hangs in the balance as his case proceeds to the Constitutional Court, which has 180 days to decide whether to uphold or overturn his impeachment. In the interim, Prime Minister Han Duck-soo is Acting President. \n\nTwelve lawmakers in Mr Yoon’s own party crossed party lines to vote with the 192 opposition members in the 300-strong National Assembly to gain the two-thirds vote required for the Bill to pass. In an earlier impeachment vote on Dec 7, Mr Yoon’s People Power Party had stood behind him, defeating the motion.\n\nLoud cheers erupted outside the National Assembly when the result was announced, from a massive crowd of at least 145,000 people, waving light sticks and dancing with joy to the news. Some had travelled to Seoul from as far as the southern cities of Busan and Tongyeong.\n\nSimilar rallies were held at other cities across the country such as Daegu, Gwangju and Jeju.\n\nPolitical scientist Ahn Byong-jin from Kyung Hee University, who was in the crowd, saw the vote as a “successful first step”, but the outcome is not yet certain.\n\nThe Bill must be approved by at least six justices in the Constitutional Court, but only six of the nine seats are filled, and a unanimous decision looks unlikely.\n\n“Just as how we never imagined we would ever see martial law declared in our country again, we need to be very cautious that unseen variables might just crop up again,” Prof Ahn told The Straits Times, noting that Mr Yoon is a “very desperate man who will do anything to push back”. \n\nMr Yoon is said to be relishing the chance to argue the legitimacy of his martial law decree in the Constitutional Court. \n\nIn a written address to the nation after passage of the Bill, Mr Yoon said the suspension was only a “temporary pause”, and expressed frustration that all his efforts in pushing reforms for the country may have been in vain.\n\nHe added that he would never give up, and that he would “continue to do my utmost for the country until the very last moment”. \n\nIt was his second public address in three days. On Dec 12, he delivered a televised statement defending his martial law declaration on Dec 3 as within “the President’s legal authority to protect the country and normalise state affairs in a catastrophic emergency that paralysed state affairs”. This was widely seen as his admission of culpability for masterminding the decree, which he was forced to rescind only hours after making it.\n\nMr Yoon has been named a suspect on insurrection charges. South Korean police, which raided his office on Dec 11 in search of evidence, said on Dec 13 that they were considering filing an arrest warrant for him and searching the presidential residence as well. \n\nAnalysts say the political process of impeachment is likely to hasten the legal proceedings.\n\nProsecutors have already arrested several senior officials close to Mr Yoon for their connection to the case – former defence minister Kim Yong-hyun, who is alleged to have masterminded the martial law debacle, both the National and Seoul Metropolitan police chiefs, a Defence Counterintelligence Command chief and the head of the Capital Defence Command.\n\nKyonggi University’s professor of political science and law Hahm Sung-deuk foresees that the authorities will want to arrest Mr Yoon “as soon as possible”.\n\n“The impeachment has made it easier for either the prosecutors or the police to arrest Mr Yoon, because he is not president any more,” said Prof Hahm. “If he is still sitting in office, it will be very difficult to do so, because his security office will block such actions.” \n\nThe impeachment vote has also thrown South Korea’s diplomacy into a flux, as foreign partners will not want to engage with Seoul during the leadership vacuum. This comes as the United States President-elect Donald Trump is due to be inaugurated in January 2025, and against the backdrop of rising threats from North Korea’s new-found alliance with Russia.\n\nMr Han sought to assuage concerns about a leadership vacuum by immediately convening a Cabinet meeting on Dec 14. He told reporters that while his heart was heavy, he pledged to do his best to “stabilise state affairs”. \n\nWith the impeachment Bill passed, attention has quickly pivoted to the Constitutional Court, where the final decision now rests. \n\nMr Yoon’s impeachment is the third in South Korea’s history. Late president Roh Moo-hyun’s impeachment in 2004 was overturned by the court after 63 days, while former president Park Geun-hye’s impeachment was upheld after 91 days in 2017. \n\nBut whether the court can decide as quickly this time around remains to be seen. \n\nWhile the court’s Acting Chief Justice Moon Hyung-bae has promised a “speedy and fair trial”, the court currently has only six out of nine seats filled. \n\nSouth Korea law stipulates that at least six justices must approve an impeachment for it to be upheld. And while not impossible, it is unlikely for all the current six justices to reach a unanimous decision.\n\nOf the current six justices, two were appointed by former president Moon Jae-in and said to be liberal-leaning, while one was appointed by Mr Yoon and seen as conservative-leaning. The other three are considered moderate with conservative leanings. \n\nKyung Hee University’s Prof Ahn believes that the strong public opinion may influence the council’s final decision to some degree, but he admits to feeling nervous because one of the justices is known to be “very conservative”. \n\n“If they cannot reach six votes to uphold the decision, then the process may drag on,” he told ST. \n\nThe ruling party and largest opposition Democratic Party have nominated their respective favoured candidates to the council, which is slated to be deliberated by the National Assembly later this month.\n\nKyonggi University’s Prof Hahm told ST that he does not foresee the vacancies to delay the impeachment decision. Pointing out that two of the current six justices are due to retire in April 2025, he says that it is very likely for the decision to be made before that happens. \n\nAnd while Mr Yoon is said to be preferring to be impeached so that he could argue the legitimacy of his martial law decree in court, he may have neglected to weigh the costs of the legal noose tightening around his neck at the same time, said Prof Hahm.\n\nHe added: “Mr Yoon is also a prosecutor-general who put many people into jail but has never been to jail himself. It is one thing to be impeached, but another to be imprisoned. A prison sentence will be very difficult for him to take.” \n\nJoin ST's Telegram channel and get the latest breaking news delivered to you.","url":"https://www.straitstimes.com/asia/east-asia/s-koreas-yoon-impeached-by-parliament-over-botched-attempt-to-impose-martial-law","image":"https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/ae0a4563c0f350cace80f255b1fa21cd97ad3a18b62c80e0140b67a9788c16dc","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-12-15 00:36:03","author":"Wendy Teo","authors":["Wendy Teo"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"sg","sentiment":-0.273},{"id":273245732,"title":"Where Tilman Fertitta plans to grow and decelerate his businesses in 2025","text":"Tilman Fertitta is as zealous as he’s ever been.\n\nThe Landry’s Inc. CEO and Houston Rockets owner isn’t slowing down after being crowned Houston’s richest billionaire earlier this year. Fertitta took the No. 1 Bayou City spot on the 43rd annual Forbes 400 list for the first time, boasting a net worth of $10.1 billion as of Sept. 1. Fertitta — whose business interests range from restaurants and real estate to professional sports and car dealerships — is also the first non-energy billionaire in Houston’s top spot.\n\nIn 2024, Fertitta expanded his Houston real estate empire, acquiring luxury mixed-use development River Oaks District and land adjacent to it, as well as an office building next to his Post Oak development. He opened The Corner Store in New York’s SoHo neighborhood in October — which is already the city’s hardest reservation to get — and recently acquired Keens Steakhouse in the city. Additionally, Fertitta expanded his automobile business and opened the Rockets’ new $70 million practice facility.\n\nFertitta is bullish on 2025, he told the Houston Business Journal, saying he has a number of deals in the works. He added that next year could be his \"best year yet.\"\n\n“2025 could be a really fun year,” Fertitta said in a one-on-one interview. “I definitely haven’t lost the zeal to do a deal. I’m as hungry today as I’ve been.”\n\nFertitta’s optimism stems from the results of the 2024 presidential election, in which Republican Donald Trump defeated Democrat Kamala Harris. Increased regulations have stymied some of his businesses the past four years, he said, but the expectation of deregulation in Trump’s second term has given him newfound confidence.\n\n“I do think 2025 is going to be a great opportunity for every type of business because of deregulation,” Fertitta said.\n\nGrowing Fertitta's empire\n\nFertitta’s real estate strategy heading into 2025 is the same as it has been in the past, though where he invests might be different.\n\nFertitta’s strategy is to invest in asset classes that others are not buying. That was the case when he purchased the Montage Laguna Beach Resort and Hotel in Southern California in 2022, when institutional dollars weren't in hospitality. It was also true when he bought River Oaks District earlier this year given the lack of investment in the space. \n\nInvestors continue to shy away from hospitality and are moving away from office, Fertitta said.\n\n“​Money moves like a herd,” Fertitta said. “If all your institutional money is not buying this particular asset class right now, then none of them do it.”\n\nThat gives Fertitta the opportunity to invest in those spaces, he said. The billionaire has already been active in both hospitality and office in recent years. Other than his acquisition of Montage Laguna Beach, he purchased Hard Rock Hotel & Casino Lake Tahoe in 2023 and an office building at 777 Post Oak Blvd. this year.\n\nFertitta isn’t limiting his geographic reach as he looks to expand his portfolio. While he said it is much friendlier to do business in Texas than in places like California or New York, stricter regulations won’t discourage him from making an acquisition in a particular state. \n\nIn particular, Fertitta plans to acquire additional trophy assets — such as River Oaks District and The Post Oak — especially in Houston. Fertitta \"absolutely\" expects a deal to come to fruition in 2025.\n\n“If you’re looking for assets that are trophy assets, you’re looking for opportunities,” Fertitta said. “It’s where institutional money is not at. That’s what gives you the opportunity to buy.”\n\nFertitta also plans further investment into his current assets locally, most notably River Oaks District.\n\nHe’s planning a “Phase 2” or “River Oaks District 2.0” for the future of the property, including adding more luxury retailers and building more open space. Since he acquired the property, the development has added Japanese restaurant Azumi, luxury women's clothing brand L'Agence, floral brand Venus et Fleur and mattress-maker Hästens.\n\n“The one thing I can always promise is (River Oaks District) is going to be in much better shape with me owning it than anybody else,” Fertitta said. \n\nRestaurant slowdown predicted\n\nWhile Fertitta’s real estate activity is poised to continue at a steady pace in 2025, he expects his restaurant businesses to slow down.\n\nFertitta has opened 10 restaurants so far this year, but he expects that number will likely decline in 2025 to five or six. He's planning to open restaurants next year in cities such as Scottsdale, Arizona; Columbus, Ohio; San Diego; and Irvine, California, among others. However, he said the rising costs of construction, leases and labor has \"gotten out of hand,\" leading him to decelerate his plans for the restaurant business.\n\n“It’s a problem in the restaurant industry right now,“ Fertitta said. \"You can’t afford to build them, and you can’t afford to hire everybody to run them.\"\n\nOne of the few restaurants he may open next year could be an expansion of The Corner Store concept to Houston. When asked if he planned to bring the popular New York restaurant to Houston, he said he would be open to it, though it would likely be under a different name. Fertitta added that it would be very similar, if not basically the same, to the New York restaurant.\n\nAdditionally, Fertitta said the business of restaurants has shifted in a way he doesn't agree with. Rising costs have led to what he described as “club restaurants” — concepts that have tens of investors, if not a hundred, who all put money into the business. While the return isn't great for the individual investors, it’s keeping the restaurant industry afloat, he said.\n\n“If that’s going to be the restaurant model going forward for everyone, I don’t know if that works for me,” Fertitta said.\n\nWhere Fertitta is placing his bets\n\nWhile Fertitta's restaurant ventures will slow in 2025, he sees the opportunity to continue growing his gaming business.\n\nFertitta is currently remodeling the Hard Rock Lake Tahoe, which will become his eighth Golden Nugget Casino when it is completed by the end of next year. Additionally, Fertitta is continuing to explore plans for his proposed 43-story hotel-casino project on the Las Vegas Strip. Fertitta got approval from Clark County in October 2022 to build a 2,420-room upscale hotel.\n\nThe project would increase Fertitta's presence in Las Vegas, where he also owns a Golden Nugget Hotel and Casino downtown.\n\nIn another move perhaps indicating Fertitta's bullishness on gaming and casinos, he increased his stake in Las Vegas-based Wynn Resorts (Nasdaq: WYNN) to 9.9% in November, becoming the company's largest shareholder.\n\nWhile Fertitta expects his overall gaming business to continue growing, it likely won’t be in Texas. A new legislative session begins in January, and there have been renewed calls to legalize gambling in the state. However, two separate bills that would have legalized sports betting and casinos failed during the 2023 session.\n\nFertitta said it’s “starting to look like that might never happen.”\n\n“I’m for gaming in Texas,” Fertitta said, adding that if legislation ever passed legalizing casino development in the state, he would \"love the opportunity to build one multibillion-dollar property.\"\n\nSelling to the masses\n\nFertitta also plans to expand his automotive dealership portfolio.\n\nFertitta acquired Norman Frede Chevrolet in Clear Lake earlier this year. It's the first non-luxury dealership for Fertitta Automotive Group, which also sells brands such as Bentley, Bugatti and Rolls-Royce at its Post Oak Motor Cars dealerships at the Post Oak Hotel and in The Woodlands. Fertitta Automotive Group recently added a Lotus dealership in The Woodlands — though Fertitta said he also is interested in acquiring additional non-luxury dealerships.\n\n“To be able to buy a dealership in Texas that sells Suburbans, Tahoes and Chevy trucks, that’s a no-brainer,” Fertitta said of the Norman Frede Chevrolet acquisition. “It’s no different than if I could buy a Ford dealership that sells F-150s.”\n\nFertitta later said, “I own fancy and casual restaurants. I think it's good to sell to the classes and the masses.”\n\nAdditionally, Fertitta said he is still interested in expanding his professional sports portfolio. Fertitta acquired the Rockets in 2017 but unsuccessfully bid on the NFL’s Washington Commanders in 2023. The billionaire is also continuing his efforts to bring an NHL franchise and a WNBA team to Houston.\n\nDespite losing out on the Commanders, Fertitta is still interested in becoming the owner of an NFL team. When asked if he would take a minority stake in a professional football team — like he did with the Houston Texans before being forced to sell his stake in 2008 — he said he would do so only if it included a path to majority ownership.\n\n“I’m just not a minority guy anymore,” Fertitta said.\n\nSign up here for the Houston Business Journal’s free morning and afternoon daily newsletters to receive the latest business news impacting greater Houston.","url":"https://www.bizjournals.com/houston/news/2024/12/13/tilman-fertitta-2025-opportunities-growth-plans.html","image":"https://media.bizj.us/view/img/12883465/tilmanfertitta*1200xx2547-1436-0-893.png","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-12-15 00:34:03","author":"Chandler France","authors":["Chandler France"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.096},{"id":273248334,"title":"ABC News to pay US$15 million to Trump library to settle lawsuit, court documents show","text":"WASHINGTON: ABC News has agreed to give US$15 million to Donald Trump’s presidential library to settle a lawsuit over comments that anchor George Stephanopoulos made on air involving the civil case brought against the US president-elect by writer E.

We have five years to see whether the complexity and frequency of military exercises with the [Chinese] People's Liberation Army evolves in ways that rival the intensity with the US military,\" Sambhi added.\n\nAccording to the report, Prabowo's early choice of state visits gave a glimpse of his strategic thinking for Indonesia's place in a region of rapidly evolving military competition.\n\nAfter visiting Australia in August and Russia in September as Indonesia's president-elect, Prabowo visited China in November, when he was elected president. Shortly after, he travelled to Washington, DC, where he met with President Joe Biden, capping the visit with a phone call to the US's president-elect Donald Trump.\n\nIn late November, Prabowo visited the United Kingdom and met with British Prime Minister Keir Starmer and King Charles.\n\nA lecturer in Southeast Asian politics and security at the National War College in Washington, DC Zachary Abuza highlighted Subianto's choice of countries to visit--Russia and China--before visiting the United States, and stated that \"the decision to visit Russia and China ahead of the US certainly raised some alarm bells about what he is going to do with the bilateral relationship.\"But the order of the countries that Prabowo chose to visit could have also been more an issue of logistics and timing than a symbolic indication of strategic intent as a visit to the US would have been complicated while the country was in the middle of a presidential election campaign in October and early November, Abuza added.\n\nAbuza also noted that the new Indonesian president could strengthen ASEAN (the Association of Southeast Asian Nations) especially given the growing rivalry between Beijing and Washington in Southeast Asia, Al Jazeera reported.\n\nWhat is certain, according to Abuza, is that \"Prabowo is going to be a different figure\" when it comes to foreign policy and the new Indonesian president may also mean a strengthened Association of Southeast Asian Nations [ASEAN] amid the regional rivalry between Beijing and Washington.\n\nPrabowo \"understands that ASEAN is more effective with a stronger Indonesia at the helm\", Abuza said.\n\nFurther, Sambhi of Verve Research suggested that analysts will closely observe how Indonesia, under Prabowo's leadership, expands its regional security partnerships.\n\nSambhi of Verve Research said that \"analysts would likely be looking at how Indonesia under Prabowo might deepen and diversify its regional security partnerships away from the twin poles of Washington and Beijing.\"Other security partners for Indonesia may include Australia, France, India, the Philippines, South Korea and Vietnam, Sambhi said.\n\n\"The more Indonesia does with other middle and emerging Indo-Pacific powers, the better for the region in mitigating the impact of US-China rivalry,\" she said. -Subianto, born in Jakarta in 1951, Prabowo began his military career in 1970 when he enrolled in the Indonesian Military Academy, from which he graduated in 1974 before joining the Indonesian Special Forces Command (Kopassus).\n\nThroughout his military career, he was accused of a string of human rights abuses while in active service, including accusations of abuses in East Timor and Indonesia's West Papua, as well as involvement in the bloody race riots in 1998 during the fall of then-president Soeharto - of whom he was once a son-in-law, as reported by Al Jazeera, (ANI)","url":"https://www.australiannews.net/news/274850054/how-indonesia-prabowo-subianto-is-treading-careful-balance-amid-us-china-rivalry-report","image":"https://cdn.bignewsnetwork.com/ani1734146340.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-12-15 00:30:03","author":null,"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"au","sentiment":0.234},{"id":273247918,"title":"ABC to Pay $15 Million to Settle a Defamation Suit Brought by Trump","text":"ABC News is set to pay $15 million to settle a defamation lawsuit brought by Donald J.

Is it any surprise then that the Merriam-Webster word of the year is “polarization”?\n\n“Polarization means division, but it’s a very specific kind of division,” said Peter Sokolowski, Merriam-Webster’s editor at large, in an exclusive interview with The Associated Press ahead of Monday’s announcement. “Polarization means that we are tending toward the extremes rather than toward the center.”\n\nThe election was so divisive, many American voters went to the polls with a feeling that the opposing candidate was an existential threat to the nation. According to AP VoteCast, a survey of more than 120,000 voters, about 8 in 10 Kamala Harris voters were very or somewhat concerned that Donald Trump’s views — but not Harris' — were too extreme, while about 7 in 10 Trump voters felt the same way about Harris — but not Trump.\n\nOxford’s 2024 word of the year is actually a phrase\n\nThe Merriam-Webster entry for “polarization” reflects scientific and metaphorical definitions. It’s most commonly used to mean “causing strong disagreement between opposing factions or groupings.” Merriam-Webster, which logs 100 million pageviews a month on its site, chooses its word of the year based on data, tracking a rise in search and usage.\n\nLast year’s pick was “authentic.” This year’s comes as large swaths of the U.S. struggle to reach consensus on what is real.\n\n“It’s always been important to me that the dictionary serve as a kind of neutral and objective arbiter of meaning for everybody,” Sokolowski said. “It’s a kind of backstop for meaning in an era of fake news, alternative facts, whatever you want to say about the value of a word’s meaning in the culture.”\n\nIt’s notable that “polarization” originated in the early 1800s — and not during the Renaissance, as did most words with Latin roots about science, Sokolowski said. He called it a “pretty young word,” in the scheme of the English language. “Polarized is a term that brings intensity to another word,” he continued, most frequently used in the U.S. to describe race relations, politics and ideology.\n\n“The basic job of the dictionary is to tell the truth about words,” the Merriam-Webster editor continued. “We’ve had dictionaries of English for 420 years and it’s only been in the last 20 years or so that we’ve actually known which words people look up.”\n\n“Polarization” extends beyond political connotations. It’s used to highlight fresh cracks and deep rifts alike in pop culture, tech trends and other industries.\n\nAll the scrutiny over Taylor Swift’s private jet usage? Polarizing. Beef between rappers Kendrick Lamar and Drake? Polarizing. The International Olympic Committee’s decision to strip American gymnast Jordan Chiles of her bronze medal after the Paris Games? You guessed it: polarizing.\n\nEven lighthearted memes — like those making fun of Australian breakdancer Rachael “Raygun” Gunn’s performance — or the proliferation of look-alike contests, or who counts as a nepo baby proved polarizing.\n\nParadoxically though, people tend to see eye to eye on the word itself. Sokolowski cited its frequent use among people across the political spectrum, including commentators on Fox News, MSNBC and CNN.\n\n“It’s used by both sides,” he said, “and in a little bit ironic twist to the word, it’s something that actually everyone agrees on.”\n\nRounding out Merriam-Webster’s top 10 words of 2024:\n\nTikToker Jools Lebron’s 38-second video describing her workday makeup routine as “very demure, very mindful” lit up the summer with memes. The video has been viewed more than 50 million times, yielding “huge spikes” in lookups, Sokolowski said, and prompting many to learn it means reserved or modest.\n\nTaylor Swift’s song “Fortnight,” featuring rapper Post Malone, undoubtedly spurred many searches for this word, which means two weeks. “Music can still send people to the dictionary,” Sokolowski said.\n\nThe solar eclipse in April inspired awe and much travel. There are tens of millions of people who live along a narrow stretch from Mexico’s Pacific coast to eastern Canada, otherwise known as the path of totality, where locals and travelers gazed skyward to see the moon fully blot out the sun. Generally, the word refers to a sum or aggregate amount — or wholeness.\n\n“Texts developed by AI have a disproportionate percentage of use of the word ‘resonate,’” Sokolowski said. This may be because the word, which means to affect or appeal to someone in a personal or emotional way, can add gravitas to writing. But, paradoxically, artificial intelligence “also betrays itself to be a robot because it’s using that word too much.”\n\nThe word was looked up 60 times more often than usual when, in March, a ship crashed into the Francis Scott Key Bridge in Baltimore. “When you have one moving object into a fixed object, that’s an allision, not a collision. You’re showing that one of the two objects struck was not, in fact, in motion,” Sokolowski said.\n\nThis summer on the TV news show “Morning Joe,” Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz called Republican leaders “weird.” It may have been what launched his national career, landing him as the Democratic vice presidential nominee. Though it’s a word that people typically misspell — is it “ei” or “ie”? — and search for that reason, its rise in use was notable, Sokolowski said.\n\nWhether the word was used to raise questions about President Joe Biden’s debate performance or Trump’s own age, it cropped up often. It refers to conscious intellectual activity — such as thinking, reasoning, or remembering.\n\nPander was used widely in political commentary, Sokolowski said. “Conservative news outlets accused Kamala Harris of pandering to different groups, especially young voters, Black voters, gun rights supporters.” Whereas Walz said Trump’s visit to a McDonald’s kitchen pandered to hourly wage workers. It means to say, do, or provide what someone — such as an audience — wants or demands even though it is not “good, proper, reasonable, etc.”\n\nIn 2003, Merriam-Webster decided to make “democracy” its first word of the year. Since then, the word — which, of course, means a form of government in which the people elect representatives to make decisions, policies and laws — is consistently one of the dictionary’s most looked up. “There’s a poignancy to that, that people are checking up on it,” Sokolowski said. “Maybe the most hopeful thing that the curiosity of the public shows, is that they’re paying attention.”\n\n— By ANNA FURMAN Associated Press\n\nAssociated Press polling editor Amelia Thomson-Deveaux contributed reporting.\n\nWhich words defined the last 10 years, according to Merriam-Webster?\n\n1. 2023: authentic\n\n2. 2022: gaslighting\n\n3. 2021: vaccine\n\n4. 2020: pandemic\n\n5. 2019: they\n\n6. 2018: justice\n\n7. 2017:feminism\n\n8. 2016: surreal\n\n9. 2015: ism\n\n10. 2014: culture","summary":"Merriam-Webster chooses its word of the year based on data, tracking a rise in search and usage.","url":"https://www.oregonlive.com/nation/2024/12/merriam-websters-2024-word-of-the-year-announced.html","image":"https://www.oregonlive.com/resizer/v2/XZLIEZX3KNA43GZCWGWR7WWQAU.jpg?auth=248dbdfa661f291f4c5997dd850471ad8ac3deb5066fc38a9335694f2f437af9&width=1280&quality=90","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-12-15 00:21:12","author":"The Associated Press","authors":["The Associated Press"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.284},{"id":273242706,"title":"ABC News to pay Trump $15m in defamation case","text":"ABC News has agreed to pay $15m (£12m) to US President-elect Donald Trump to settle a defamation lawsuit after its star anchor falsely said he had been found “liable for rape”.\n\nGeorge Stephanopoulos made the defamatory statements repeatedly during an interview on 10 March this year when he challenged a congresswoman about her support for Trump.\n\nA jury in a civil case last year determined Trump was liable for “sexual abuse”, which has a specific definition under New York law.\n\nAs part of Saturday’s settlement, ABC will also publish a statement expressing its “regret” for the statements by Stephanopoulos.\n\nThe network also agreed to pay $1m towards Trump’s legal fees.\n\nAccording to the settlement, ABC News will pay $15m as a charitable contribution to a “Presidential foundation and museum to be established by or for Plaintiff, as Presidents of the United States of America have established in the past”.\n\nThe network also agreed to pay $1m towards Trump’s legal fees.\n\nUnder the settlement, the network will post an editor’s note to the bottom of its 10 March 2024 online news article about the story.\n\nIt will say: “ABC News and George Stephanopoulos regret statements regarding President Donald J Trump made during an interview by George Stephanopoulos with Rep.

It's president, Vladimir Putin, is often portrayed as a kind of mafia boss/KGB agent hybrid and, in fairness, its not hard to see why.A brief step back however allows us to see that many of the more notorious actions of Putin's Russia are barely distinguishable from those conducted by the US and its allies.1. Attacking UkraineIt's been nearly three years since Russia launched what it calls the \"Special Military Operation\" in Ukraine, or as the BBC likes to say, \"full scale invasion\".There is no doubt that this has caused untold suffering to the people of Ukraine, not to mention many in Russia. The ongoing nature of the conflict makes it practically impossible to know with surety the exact death toll, but it is safe to say it's well into six figures.The Wall Street Journal estimate that the number of dead and wounded at over a million. In addition to this almost seven million Ukrainians have fled their homeland as refugees.Why did Russia do this? Russia has characterised Ukraine as being under the control of a hostile and even \"Nazi\" regime and has said that its actions in Ukraine are in defence of Russian security. They have also made questionable claims that Ukraine is developing biological weapons.Is it possible that Putin learned from George W. Bush that invading a sovereign nation is acceptable if you don't like its regime, and can claim it represents a security threat that is developing weapons of mass destruction?The US led invasion and occupation of Iraq cost the lives of hundreds of thousands of people, displaced many more, and while it officially ended in 2011, its effects are still being felt.2. Dissidents Mysteriously DyingWhen Yevgeny Prigozhin died in a plane crash last year there were few in the west who doubted that Putin or those close to him were involved. Similarly, the death of Alexei Navalny in prison this year, led to much finger pointing at the Russian president.Putin of course denies ordering the death of either individual.No such denial however was made by Ukrainian secret services when it came to the lesser-known death of Illya Kyva. Kyva was a member of the Ukrainian parliament with pro-Russian sympathies. He was killed in Moscow last year by the Ukrainian SBU, who far from issuing denials, boasted about it on TV.Questions have also been asked about the fate of US citizen and YouTuber Gonzalo Lira. Lira was arrested by Ukrainian authorities for supporting the Russian attack on Ukraine. Lira later died of pneumonia in prison, with his father laying the blame on Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky and US president Joe Biden. His father also claimed his son had been tortured, something Ukraine denies.3. Airspace Fun and GamesFor many years now it's been common to read accounts of Russian military aircraft flying suspiciously close to British airspace and indeed to the airspace of other NATO countries. Often this results in a story about RAF fighters being used to escort or warn away the offending Russian.What is less commonly reported however is that British planes also engage in excursions near Russian airspace. In 2022 Russian fighter jets, in an incident that could easily have become deadly, fired missiles in response to an RAF surveillance mission over the Black Sea. The Black Sea is a lot closer to Sevastopol than it is to Southend.4. Spies, Diplomats and JournalistsEarlier this year Russia and the USA conducted a prisoner swap. Among those exchanged were Russian FSB agent Vadim Krasikov and Wall Street Journal journalist Evan Gershkovich, who was being held on espionage charges by Russia. The Wall Street Journal denied that Gershkovich was a spy and the US government declared that he was being \"wrongfully detained\" by Russia.Russia and Britain have also been engaged in tit-for-tat expulsions of diplomats, with each claiming that the expelled diplomats are actually engaged in espionage. Britain has denied that its diplomats were engaged in espionage.We have no reason to think that Gershkovich or anyone else detained or expelled by Russia are spies. He was almost certainly arrested so that he could be used as a bargaining chip in negotiations with the US.However, let us ask ourselves the following questions. Is it likely that Britain and the US have spies or intelligence assets active in Russia? If they do, is it possible that sometimes Russian intelligence might catch them? If they were caught, could we expect British or US authorities to admit that those caught, were in fact spies?Logic would suggest that sometimes scenarios like the above could play out.5. Russian InterferenceA Romanian court recently ordered the complete re-running of the country's first round of presidential elections, citing Russian interference in the now annulled vote in November. Similarly, circa 2016 it was a commonly held view in certain sectors that Russian interference allowed the first election of Donald Trump as US president.By 2021 however casting doubt on the legitimacy US presidential elections had become highly unfashionable, mainly because Trump himself started doing it, albeit for different reasons.Russia, of course, has denied interfering in either election.One of Russia's grievances against the West and one of the justifications it gives for the current conflict, is Western support (interference?) for the 2014 Euromaidan protests in Ukraine. The protests led to the deposition of the pro-Russian, but elected, president of Ukraine of the time, Viktor Yanukovych.US Assistant Secretary of State, Victoria Nuland, visited the protestors and handed out food parcels to them, while former Republican presidential candidate John McCain also gave a speech to protestors where he urged Ukraine to embrace a European future.There are many other examples of Britain and the US acting, either openly or behind the scenes, to remove leaders they do not approve of in countries that are not their own.The point of this is not to say that Russia is in fact good, and the West is bad, nor vice versa. The point is to demonstrate that both Russia, the US and Britain are playing the same game of international politics.It is sometimes a very rough game that can cause misery for ordinary people around the world. Perhaps the ends each power has in mind are different, but the means used to get there do occasionally appear to be very similar.","url":"https://www.ibtimes.co.uk/mirror-mirror-world-stage-are-russian-western-tactics-more-alike-we-think-1729531","image":"https://d.ibtimes.co.uk/en/full/1721943/vladimir-putin.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-12-15 00:21:03","author":"William Dove","authors":["William Dove"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.164},{"id":273242660,"title":"Hawk Tuah Haliey Welch's Crypto Team Nets £2.59M Amid Botched Token Launch, Fans File SEC Complaints","text":"The launch of the HAWK meme coin, spearheaded by social media influencer Haliey Welch, has devolved into controversy as reports reveal that her crypto team profited £2.59 million ($3.3 million) during a chaotic rollout.The token's value crashed by 95% shortly after launch, sparking investor outrage and leading to complaints filed with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).Welch, 22, now faces the possibility of lawsuits for her involvement in what some have labelled a \"rug pull\" scheme.Viral Fame to Crypto InfamyWelch shot to internet fame earlier this year after a TikTok video about relationship advice went viral, amassing her over 2.5 million followers.Leveraging her newfound popularity, she ventured into crypto, pitching the HAWK token as a community reward for her fan base.The token, launched on the Solana blockchain, was marketed as an opportunity for fans to participate in giveaways tied to Welch's podcasts and merchandise.However, the coin's value plummeted shortly after peaking at a £392 million ($500 million) market cap, leaving many fans and investors with significant losses.Blockchain data from Bubblemaps revealed that nearly 90% of the token supply was manipulated by insiders or snipers who bought large amounts during the launch.Welch claimed in a post on X (formerly Twitter) that her team had done its best to prevent snipers, but the damage was already done.Insider Profits and Allegations of MisconductAccording to Bubblemaps CEO Nicolas Vaiman, the HAWK team orchestrated a \"one-day pump and dump,\" pocketing £2.59 million ($3.3 million) in profits.The data revealed that 17% of the token supply was allocated to 285 early investors, many of whom sold their holdings immediately, destabilising the coin's price.The launch also saw only 3% of the tokens made available to the public through the Meteora exchange, contradicting Welch's claims that 20% would be distributed to fans as giveaways.Additionally, the team collected an estimated £1.57 million ($2 million) in fees from the exchange.Journalist Stephen Findeisen, known as \"Coffeezilla,\" confronted Welch's team during a heated audio event on X Spaces.He criticised the launch as \"one of the most miserable, horrible launches I've ever seen\" and accused the team of insider trading.These allegations were denied by Alexander Larson Shultz, a team member nicknamed \"Doc Hollywood,\" who has ties to Canadian entertainer Howie Mandel.Legal Risks for WelchAs the controversy deepens, Welch may face legal repercussions. According to Scott Armstrong, a former US Department of Justice prosecutor, Welch could be subject to civil or criminal investigations for misleading her followers. \"The optics are obviously terrible and have the hallmarks of a rug pull,\" Armstrong said.Welch's lawyer, Christian Barker, stated that she was paid £98,135 ($125,000) to promote the coin, alongside a 50% share of the net proceeds after expenses.While Welch claimed ignorance of crypto regulations, such as those that led to legal action against Kim Kardashian for promoting unregistered tokens, many believe she was used as a marketing tool by experienced crypto insiders.Rising Complaints and SEC InvolvementDisgruntled fans have filed complaints with the SEC, accusing Welch and her team of fraudulent practices.Meanwhile, blockchain analysis suggests that the token launch involved coordinated efforts to maximise insider profits at the expense of public investors.The HAWK debacle highlights the risks associated with speculative meme coins. With cryptocurrencies gaining mainstream attention from figures like Donald Trump and Elon Musk, experts warn that scams involving unregulated tokens are likely to increase.Investors are advised to steer clear of volatile, low-cost tokens promising quick returns. Instead, experts recommend focusing on more established cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum, which offer stability and can be accessed through regulated exchange-traded funds.Disclaimer: Our digital media content is for informational purposes only and not investment advice.

His time at the helm came to an end with the election of Democrat Barack Obama in 2008, with voters optimistic a push to the left would bring an end to their nation’s involvement in foreign conflicts.\n\nSince then, Bush has mostly taken a back seat, periodically weighing in on the current political climate. Last month, he released a short statement congratulating Donald Trump on his victory and expressed hope his country would emerge from its recent political turmoil.\n\nHe has now appeared in front of the camera to comment on the exploits of Churchill in the Churchill at War series, offering up the American perspective of Britain’s greatest struggle.﻿\n\nChurchill is often hailed as the indispensable leader who rallied Britain and the Allied powers to victory in World War II. His unwavering defiance against Nazi Germany, stirring speeches and strategic brilliance have solidified his place in history.\n\nHowever, closer examination of his leadership reveals a complex figure whose actions, while undeniably pivotal, were not without controversy and ambiguity.\n\nChurchill’s rise to power coincided with one of Britain’s darkest hours. In May 1940, as France fell to the German onslaught, Churchill became Prime Minister, vowing to fight on “whatever the cost may be, whatever the hardship may be, we will never surrender.” \n\nIn his appearance in the documentary series, Bush commented on how Churchill’s complex family life would have generated even more pressure for the leader who was forced to make unthinkable decisions every single day.\n\n“The world, at times, is starved for strong leaders. Churchill was a strong leader,” Bush said.\n\n“It had to be lonely,” Bush said.\n\n“I think if you have a dysfunctional family, the pressures have got to be double.”\n\nBush mentioned the fact Churchill never wallowed in self-pity at the circumstances he was placed in, at least not in front of the cameras.\n\n“One of the real problems with leadership is when you’re full of self pity.\n\n“‘Why me? Why couldn’t this have happened under somebody else?’”\n\n“Churchill never seemed to have that kind of self-pity.\n\n“I don’t know about destiny. All I know is he got thrown into a difficult situation and dealt with it.”\n\nBush also commented on the tense situation facing Americans at the time. It was barely 20 years after the closure of WWI, and the US was fundamentally opposed to rejoining another European war.\n\n“It wasn’t all that long before WWI that Hitler began to make his moves in Europe,” Bush continued.\n\n“Most Americans said ‘we’re not going to do that again, that’s none of our business’.\n\n“The people’s voice matters, and the voice was loud and clear: ‘We don’t want to be involved’\n\n“Roosevelt had to manage that and at the same time listen to another voice that was equally as loud. And that was ‘help’.”\n\nAs news of the Nazi regime’s atrocities made its way across the pond, coupled with Japan’s expansionist aggression in the Pacific, the US was compelled to swing its military might across the globe once more.\n\nChurchill went on to forge a crucial alliance with the United States, recognising the importance of American military might in defeating the Axis powers. \n\nChurchill’s vision for a post-war world, which he outlined in his famous Iron Curtain speech, warned of the growing threat of Soviet expansionism, which turned out to be an accurate assessment of what would become the Cold War.\n\nLike Bush’s, Churchill’s legacy is not without its blemishes. \n\nHis policies, particularly in India, have been heavily criticised in the decades after his death. His insistence on maintaining British colonial rule, despite growing calls for Indian independence, led to widespread unrest and violence. Additionally, his role in the Bengal famine of 1943, where millions of Indians perished, remains a controversial chapter in his history.\n\n“Churchill hung on to imperialism as a way to keep England great, but the world was moving away from that,” Bush said in the documentary.\n\nSome historians argue that Churchill’s focus on European affairs, particularly the war against Germany, overshadowed the plight of the Indian people. They contend that his policies exacerbated the famine by diverting food supplies to British troops and stockpiling resources for the war effort.\n\nWhile his legacy is undeniably complex, it is important to acknowledge his triumphs. Several WWII scholars have claimed the outcome would have been far less favourable if Churchill had not become Britain’s leader.\n\nHe was, as many historic figures are a product of his time shaped by the attitudes and beliefs of his era and criticised long after his death for things he truly believed would benefit the world.","url":"https://www.news.com.au/finance/work/leaders/former-us-president-george-w-bush-reemerges-in-winston-churchill-netflix-documentary-he-dealt-with-it/news-story/8a24f19019416836bea4c06734d53c34","image":"https://content.api.news/v3/images/bin/13470da62fca6515e71dde89b65165b1","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-12-15 00:17:03","author":"Alex Blair","authors":["Alex Blair"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"au","sentiment":-0.139},{"id":273242554,"title":"Star, network’s $25 million Trump apology","text":"ABC News has agreed to pay a $US15 million ($23.6 million) donation to a “Presidential foundation and museum to be established by or for (Mr Trump), as Presidents of the United States of America have established in the past”, the network said.\n\nIt will also pay $US1 million ($1.57 million) to cover Mr Trump’s legal fees, according to the settlement. \n\nMr Trump slapped ABC and Stephanopoulos with a lawsuit in Miami federal court after the network star incorrectly said multiple times Mr Trump was “found liable for rape” during a This Week interview with Republican representative Nancy Mace from South Carolina. \n\nABC News and star anchor George Stephanopoulos also would issue statements expressing their “regret” to an online article version of Stephanopoulos’ March interview, the settlement noted. \n\n“ABC News and George Stephanopoulos regret statements regarding President Donald J.

That’s some prestigious company for a woman who’s never held a full time paying job and is never getting access to the nuclear codes.\n\nThis would be interesting news in and of itself, but then Google released its annual Year in Search report, laying bare what eight billion of us have been tippity tap two-finger typing into that search bar for this year. I’ll spare you the suspense – a whole lotta Kate.\n\nIn 2024, the princess was the second most searched for person on the planet, behind He Who Cannot Be Shamed. In the United States, she was the most searched for non-politician.\n\nTaylor who now? Elon huh?\n\nBut we’re not done yet. At the same time all this Kate-ness was coming out, the two biggest mainstream celebrity magazines in America, People and Us Weekly, were simultaneously splashing her across their covers for the umpteenth time this year.\n\nIt’s a Kate-athon!

If the princess stands for fortitude and resilience after the last 12 months, what does the duchess stand for?\n\nThe year started with such promise for the House of Montecito.\n\nA Grace Kelly approved red carpet turn in January in Jamaica with the boss of Paramount along with Prince Harry, The Duke of Sussex seemed to presage a big year for the couple, an assumption that got a massive boost when the duchess unveiled her lifestyle brand American Riviera Orchard (ARO) in March. \n\nCome April, they announced they had two new Netflix series simmering away, his about polo, hers about entertaining.\n\nThey also branched out on the charity front, taking themselves off on two dupes of a royal tour, first to Nigeria and then Colombia.\n\nExcept none of this has really managed to land.\n\nThe tours were successful in that they made for plenty of good photo opportunities but failed to meaningfully improve their standing as humanitarian leaders.\n\nARO has faced a series of setbacks, having its trademark application knocked back before the duchess was forced in December to seek a three month extension from the US patent office to get things in order.\n\nMeanwhile, the ARO website launched on March 14 but is still naught but a holding page inviting fans to join the waitlist. They are still waiting, nine months on. \n\nThe world continues to be deprived of the chance to buy the Meghan approved napery and marmalades and various whatnots and tchotchkes that I’m not sure anyone is specifically crying out for. (Though her taste is excellent if you ask me).\n\nThen last week, Harry’s Polo debuted – only to be met by biting reviews (a “tedious inside-look”; “a dull indulgence about a rich person’s pursuit”; “destined to fall … into obscurity at the speed of light”) and a resounding lack of public interest. (As of the time of writing, it had failed to make the top ten most watched shows on Netflix, according to website FlixPatrol).\n\nThe fear of the flop is real.\n\nAs yet, no date has been set for the launch of Meghan’s entertaining show, which finished filming in June last year.\n\nWhich brings us back to the question of, what does the duchess now symbolise? Celebrity? TV? The hunt for the almighty dollar? Entrepreneurialism?\n\nMeghan’s post-palace brand has gone from being a valiant truth-teller to a confused hodge-podge and her wider relevance has clearly suffered.\n\n2025 could change all that, with ARO’s unveiling and her new show.\n\nTIME ended up handing Person of the Year to Donald Trump.

Daylight savings begins on March 31, the clocks are turned forward, and it ends in October. \n\nThe Northern Territory, Queensland and Western Australia don’t bother with daylight savings at all. \n\nDaylight savings was first implemented by Germany in 1916 to conserve energy and power during World War 1, and then Europe and the United States followed suit. \n\nThe idea was pretty simple.\n\nIf there was more daylight during the hours people are typically awake, there’d be less need to use power resources. The added bonus is that people would get more recreational time to enjoy sunlight.\n\nThe system has existed for decades, but Mr Trump has vowed to change it. \n\n“The Republican Party will use its best efforts to eliminate daylight saving time, which has a small but strong constituency, but shouldn’t,” he wrote.\n\n“Daylight saving time is inconvenient, and very costly to our nation.”\n\nMr Trump’s claim that daylight savings costs money isn’t baseless. \n\nA study by Chmura Economics and Analytics estimated daylight savings time costs the US more than $430 million a year. \n\nThe study claimed that daylight savings was more than just a “lost hour of sleep” and that it can lead to an increase in “heart attacks, workplace injuries in the mining and construction sectors,”.\n\nIt can also reduce productivity for people who work in offices, and ultimately costs America money. \n\nMr Trump’s statement immediately caused a debate, with some in complete agreement with him and rubbishing the system. \n\n“Hopefully, the whole world will follow. Most of the people I asked said they hate daylight saving,” one shared. \n\n“My Dad will thank you for this! He is upset since they changed the hours and he has to walk while it’s dark at 4pm!!”\n\nSomeone else replied to Mr Trump’s statement and said, “Great,” another wrote, “Thank you,” and one said they “fully support” axing daylight savings. \n\n“Daylight Savings Time is pure nonsense,” another claimed. \n\n“Yes! Enough is enough,” one cheered.\n\n“It is so inconvenient anyhow! Plus the loss of financials because of it,” one mused. \n\nNot everyone supported Mr Trump’s plan, though. Many pointed out that daylight savings gives them more work/life balance. \n\n“I’ve voted for you three times. If you make standard time permanent it will be the biggest disappointment ever,” one person wrote and warned Trump not to take “away” his golf time after work.\n\n“The problem is that during the winter, people will be going to work and kids will be going to school in the dark,” one pointed out.\n\n“This means winter darkness continues and long summer’s nights get cut,” someone else wrote.\n\n“I just want it to be light when I go to work and when I get home,” one said. \n\n“Please, please keep daylight savings all year! We get way longer days, and we need the sunlight. When we go back to standard time during the winter, we get tons of seasonal depression,” one begged.","url":"https://www.news.com.au/finance/money/costs/enough-is-enough-donald-trump-divides-with-daylight-savings-plan/news-story/fb4847902435e486ce42cd3cfe5d2d8c","image":"https://content.api.news/v3/images/bin/cf3c35c543f13adecbb8c18d505e287c","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-12-15 00:17:03","author":"Mary Madigan","authors":["Mary Madigan"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"au","sentiment":-0.082},{"id":273243014,"title":"Horvath outduels Daily as Navy upsets Army","text":"LANDOVER, Md. -- Blake Horvath outplayed Bryson Daily at quarterback, accounting for 311 yards and four touchdowns to help Navy beat No. 19 Army 31-13 on Saturday.\n\nHorvath threw for 107 yards and two touchdowns and ran for 204 yards and two TDs. Navy (9-3) snapped a two-game losing streak in the series. The teams entered this Army-Navy matchup with a combined 19 victories this season, the most in the 125-game history of this storied clash.\n\nDaily, who finished sixth in the Heisman Trophy vote this year, threw a touchdown pass of his own, but he was intercepted three times.

The Midshipmen took advantage of a short field, going ahead 14-0 on an 18-yard pass from Horvath to Brandon Chatman. Daily answered with a TD pass of his own -- 23 yards to Hayden Reed.\n\nBoth teams were run heavy as expected, but they did combine for 25 pass attempts -- including what was probably the biggest play of the game in the third quarter.

Trump first threw his support behind the idea of permanently keeping America on daylight saving time in 2019 when state legislatures across the nation were considering eliminating the practice. Arizona and Hawaii are the only two states that don’t observe daylight saving time. In 2022, the Senate unanimously and surprisingly passed a bill from Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) — now Trump’s pick for secretary of State — to make daylight saving time permanent, but it died in the House. Sen. Ed Markey (D-Mass.), one of the bill’s cosponsors, who joined with Rubio again just two months ago to renew their push to “lock the clock,” continued that call on Friday in response to Trump’s post. “Switching the clocks just doesn’t make sense for a country on the move,” he said in a statement to POLITICO. “But we need permanent daylight saving time — more hours of daylight in the evening means more hours to get things done.”","url":"https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2024/12/13/congress/trump-daylight-saving-time-00194329","image":"https://www.politico.com/dims4/default/4479aaa/2147483647/resize/1200x/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.politico.com%2F7f%2Fe6%2F3ee732184bdcb1c564d7f98d523e%2Fhttps-delivery-gettyimages.com%2Fdownloads%2F2167195104","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-12-15 00:13:04","author":"Kierra Frazier,Lisa Kashinsky","authors":["Kierra Frazier","Lisa Kashinsky"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.273},{"id":273242012,"title":"ABC and Stephanopoulos to pay Trump $15M, apologize in defamation suit settlement - POLITICO","text":"ABC News and anchor George Stephanopoulos reached a settlement with President-elect Donald Trump on Saturday, with the network agreeing to issue an apology and pay a Trump-related foundation $15 million in addition to $1 million for Trump’s attorney fees.\n\nThe settlement, filed in federal court in Miami Saturday afternoon, marks a win for Trump, who sued the network and its star anchor for libel after Stephanopoulos said on air that Trump was found liable for the rape of writer E.

Miami-based U.S. Magistrate Judge Lisette Reid issued the order Friday, signaling that Trump’s status as president-elect is not a reason to put off sworn questioning of him in connection with the suit he filed. “The parties are reminded that the Court ‘has already granted a lengthy discovery period . . . and, with Election Day now behind us, there is no reason for any further delay,’” Reid wrote, quoting an earlier order in the case. Reid said Trump’s deposition must take place “in person” in the Southern District of Florida, which includes Trump’s Florida residence, Mar-a-Lago. Trump sued ABC after Stephanopoulos said on air that Trump raped writer E. Jean Carroll, who won a civil verdict against Trump for sexual abuse last year. The jury did not back Carroll’s rape claim against Trump, but in a subsequent opinion, the judge presiding over the case emphasized the distinction between the legal definition of rape and its more colloquial understanding. Spokespeople for Trump and for ABC did not immediately respond to requests for comment. The suit against ABC is one of a series of cases Trump filed against news organizations and perceived political enemies after leaving the White House in 2021. The suits, in which Trump claims financial damages sometimes up to billions of dollars, generated fodder Trump could point to during the 2024 campaign highlighting his continued fight with what he claimed to be his opponents in the mainstream media. However, the legal cases now carry a potential hangover for the president-elect, as they expose him to the possibility of court orders directing him to offer sworn testimony and fork over documents related to the cases. Trump could avoid depositions and other demands in the cases he filed by seeking to drop or settle them, but a spokesperson said last week that he plans to keep pressing forward.","url":"https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2024/12/13/congress/judge-orders-trump-deposition-00194361","image":"https://www.politico.com/dims4/default/a4e16b8/2147483647/resize/1200x/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.politico.com%2F0f%2Fe8%2Fd68f0ef040dc9ea553ca9eb41fb4%2Ftrump-82098.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-12-15 00:13:04","author":"Josh Gerstein,Kyle Cheney","authors":["Josh Gerstein","Kyle Cheney"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.507},{"id":273241986,"title":"Trump picks Devin Nunes to lead Intelligence Advisory Board - POLITICO","text":"“Devin will draw on his experience … and his key role in exposing the Russia, Russia, Russia Hoax, to provide me with independent assessments of the effectiveness and propriety of the U.S. Intelligence Community’s activities,” Trump said Saturday in a Truth Social post.\n\nThe board “has access to all information necessary to perform its functions,” according to the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, as well as direct access to the president.\n\nNunes has led Trump Media since late 2021.

Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York and Gerry Connolly of Virginia are racing to lock down votes to lead their party on the Oversight and Accountability panel. Many Democrats saw Ocasio-Cortez as having the upper hand heading into next week, but both Connolly and Ocasio-Cortez’s camps are confident of their chances, with Connolly’s supporters saying they will have the support of a majority of the caucus and the Steering Committee. Ocasio-Cortez also has a team working to whip votes in her favor, said a person granted anonymity to discuss her operation. The powerful Steering and Policy Committee will convene on Monday to debate and vote on recommendations to the full caucus for the committee leadership positions. Then, the full caucus will vote Tuesday morning on the committee contenders. The caucus generally follows the steering panel’s recommendations. Connolly’s supporters believe they have roughly 130 yes or lean yes votes, according to a House Democrat granted anonymity to discuss the Virginia lawmaker’s whip count. There are 215 members of the Democratic Caucus next Congress. The House Democrat added that they were “confident” Connolly had “locked up” both a majority of the Steering Committee and the full caucus. “Gerry has the support of a majority of the Democratic Caucus. We are confident he will be the top Democrat on the House Oversight Committee, and I think he will be very good at that job,” said a senior Democratic aide close to Connolly’s whipping process. Ocasio-Cortez and her allies, meanwhile, have been having conversations with a broad cross-section of the caucus as she tries to rally support for her bid. She and Connolly made closed-door presentations to the Democratic Caucus’ power centers — the tri-caucus of affinity groups and the ideological caucuses — and they’ve also quietly approached their fellow lawmakers on the House floor as they laid out their vision for the panel. The recent backing of key Democratic constituencies and belief that they have the backing of most current Oversight Committee members has bolstered the confidence of Ocasio-Cortez’s allies. Democrats see the high-profile panel as a foil to President-elect Donald Trump and his allies. The race in many ways is a test of how far Democrats will go as they face a pent-up urge to make sweeping generational changes within the caucus, a yearslong push that threatened to boil over post-election. Democrats don’t have term limits for their panel heads, leading to grumbling among younger Democrats whose paths upward have been stifled. Top Democratic leaders are all publicly professing neutrality in the ranking member contests and say they’ll let the caucus work its will. But former leaders aren’t bound by the same concerns. Connolly has a powerful backer in his corner: Former Speaker Nancy Pelosi has been privately stumping for Connolly, a longtime ally, and making calls on his behalf, according to three people familiar with the situation. She’s also been boosting her fellow Californians Rep. Jared Huffman for the Natural Resources Committee and Rep. Jim Costa for the Agriculture Committee. Punchbowl News earlier reported the Pelosi outreach. Democrats mounted challenges to committee leaders who had faced questions about their attendance and ability to serve as ranking members amid health struggles. Rep. Jerry Nadler of New York stepped out of the Judiciary race, and Rep. Raúl Grijalva of Arizona also ended his committee bid. Rep. David Scott of Georgia has stayed in the race to be the top Agriculture Committee Democrat despite strong challengers. But Connolly supporters reject any comparison between their race against Ocasio-Cortez and the other Democrat-on-Democrat battles and specifically point to Pelosi’s support for him. The former speaker has been unflinching in her work over the past year to pressure Democrats she feels are no longer up to the job, including President Joe Biden and reportedly Nadler, to give up their positions. Connolly said he was diagnosed with cancer in a statement after the election. In private conversations as he sought the top Oversight spot, the House Democrat said, Connolly has pledged to his colleagues that he will be transparent about the status of his diagnosis, including if it were to unexpectedly worsen. Connolly ran for the top Oversight job last Congress, ultimately losing to Rep. Jamie Raskin of Maryland, who’s jumping to be the top Judiciary panel Democrat. A second House Democrat, granted anonymity to disclose private discussions, said Raskin has told colleagues he is staying neutral in the race to succeed him at least until the Judiciary race is settled. Some ideological lines were drawn too, with Ocasio-Cortez winning the Progressive Caucus endorsement and Connolly winning the endorsement of the centrist New Democrat Coalition’s leadership. Ocasio-Cortez won the Congressional Hispanic Caucus’ endorsement as well, though at least one of its members — Rep. Linda Sanchez (D-Calif.), the chair of its political arm — is whipping for Connolly, according to the first House Democrat granted anonymity. Rep. Gregory Meeks (D-N.Y.) is also whipping for Connolly.","url":"https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2024/12/13/congress/aoc-connolly-oversight-fight-00194320","image":"https://www.politico.com/dims4/default/14180d1/2147483647/resize/1200x/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.politico.com%2Fc5%2F66%2F7000bacd463994f5a19052a44fff%2Fu-s-congress-81525.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-12-15 00:13:04","author":"Daniella Diaz,Jordain Carney,Nicholas Wu","authors":["Daniella Diaz","Jordain Carney","Nicholas Wu"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.104},{"id":273241978,"title":"McConnell hits back at polio vaccine skeptics: ‘Dangerous’ - Live Updates - POLITICO","text":"Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell sharply criticized associates of Robert F.

But for millions who came after me, the real miracle was the saving power of the polio vaccine,” McConnell said. “Anyone seeking the Senate’s consent to serve in the incoming Administration would do well to steer clear of even the appearance of association with such efforts.” McConnell was not alone in his criticism. \"It’s outrageous and dangerous for people in the Trump Transition to try and get rid of the polio vaccine that has virtually eradicated polio in America and saved millions of lives,\" Majority Leader Chuck Schumer said in a statement. \"RFK Jr. must state his position on this.\"","url":"https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2024/12/13/congress/mcconnell-slams-polio-vaccine-skeptics-00194353","image":"https://www.politico.com/dims4/default/d96b4c4/2147483647/resize/1200x/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.politico.com%2Fb6%2Fb1%2F4a015db44c9bba94539db4b02431%2Fu-s-congress-39864.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-12-15 00:13:04","author":"Anthony Adragna","authors":["Anthony Adragna"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.157},{"id":273241980,"title":"Republicans fill coveted openings on Ways and Means - Live Updates - POLITICO","text":"The House Republican Steering Committee selected Republican Reps.

RFK Jr's skepticism reignites the debate","text":"Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who is one of President-elect Donald J. Trump’s choice to head the Department of Health and Human Services has vowed to remove fluoride from the US public water supply. His skepticism about fluoride has reignited the debate about whether fluoride is good or bad. RFK Jr.’s pledge that Trump’s administration would ‘advise all U.S. systems to remove fluoride from public water’ has sparked an outcry among health experts, who believe fluoridated water is safe and essential for protecting oral health in children.In a post shared on X, in Nov. 2024, he said, \"On January 20, the Trump White House will advise all U.S. water systems to remove fluoride from public water. Fluoride is an industrial waste associated with arthritis, bone fractures, bone cancer, IQ loss, neurodevelopmental disorders, and thyroid disease.\" — RobertKennedyJr (@RobertKennedyJr) He also stated that “It reduces IQ in exposed fetuses at way below therapeutic doses. Please see the attached link for more detailed information. Michael Connet is the attorney who just won a landmark Federal court case against the FDA for failing abysmally to protect public health against fluoride exposures.”Let’s take a look at the fluoridation of drinking water and whether it's good or bad. 116328110Fluoride is a mineral occurring naturally in water, soil, and air. It has been proven to prevent dental cavities. Fluoride works by strengthening the tooth's enamel, thereby making it more resistant to the acids produced by the bacteria that cause tooth decay. Before the fluoridation of public water supplies, most Americans struggled with tooth decay. After the introduction of fluoride in water, it dipped, in both children and adults.115399527What do experts say?116328124The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has called fluoridation of drinking water one of 10 great public health interventions of the 20th century because of the dramatic decline in cavities since community water fluoridation started in 1945. Contrary to RFK Jr.’s beliefs, the CDC also recommends using fluoride toothpaste and drinking fluoridated water if it is available where you live.116328137 111919784The American Dental Association too agrees that community water fluoridation helps prevent tooth decay. “Even in an era with widespread availability of fluoride from various sources, other studies show that community water fluoridation prevents at least 25% of tooth decay in children and adults throughout their life span. The scientific weight of sound evidence around the benefit of community water fluoridation is clear and compelling,\" Linda J. Edgar, D.D.S., president of the American Dental Association said in a release.

Amid ongoing reports of mysterious drone sightings in New Jersey, the President-elect used the opportunity to mock former New Jersey Governor Chris Christie, sharing an image of Christie enjoying a McDonald’s Happy Meal delivered by drones.The meme, posted on Trump’s Truth Social platform and Twitter, was a thinly veiled jab at Christie, who had been a vocal critic of Trump during the 2024 GOP primary. The former president captioned the post with his thoughts on the ongoing drone mystery: “Mystery Drone sightings all over the Country. Can this really be happening without our government's knowledge? I don’t think so. Let the public know, and now. Otherwise, shoot them down!!!

Christie, who dropped out of the 2024 presidential race earlier this month, centered his campaign on criticizing Trump’s leadership and legal troubles, calling him a “failed leader” and accusing him of prioritizing personal interests over the nation.Trump’s latest meme seems to be a victory lap over Christie’s failed campaign. The choice of a McDonald’s Happy Meal—a frequent target of jokes about Christie’s weight—adds a biting layer of humor to the dig.Christie’s silence amid the drone mysteryInterestingly, Christie has not commented on the wave of unexplained drone sightings across New Jersey and New York, leaving the public to wonder whether Trump’s meme was a lighthearted critique or a deeper swipe at Christie’s absence from the conversation.Trump's tactical meme strategyThis isn’t the first time Trump has used memes and humor to rally his base. By mixing politics with entertainment, Trump keeps the spotlight on himself while simultaneously undermining his rivals.

They can get old.\n\n“I see some women doing it, Helen (Mirren) does it really well. And Judi (Dench).”\n\nCher starred in Tea With Mussolini with Dame Helen, Dame Judi and Dame Maggie Smith in 1999.\n\n“I kind of just wanted to listen to those girls, because there are all kinds of stories that they’re telling about being there,” Cher said.\n\n“I had a scene with Maggie, and I was sweating it. I was really like having the vapours, and Maggie said: ‘Don’t be ridiculous.'”\n\nCher also spoke about the challenges of parenting following the Oscar and Grammy-winning singer and actress filing a petition for control of the finances of her son Elijah Blue Allman, citing his struggles with addiction and mental health.\n\n“You can do your best, and you can be supportive, and you can keep trying,” Cher said.\n\n“Elijah is so intelligent, and the truth is he’s so bright and so smart, but it hasn’t served him well, because he’s in that kind of, above all of us.\n\n“He’s thinking beyond what we’re thinking – but it hasn’t helped him, really.\n\n“I loved Gregory (Allman, father of Elijah Blue), so I thought, I will stick with him because he’s going to change.\n\n“There are a lot of people who do and he tried hard. I remember once I was so exasperated, and I said: ‘I’m so sick of you going to rehab’, and he said: ‘So am I, but I keep going for you.’\n\n“But they get demons, and it is what it is.\n\n“With my son, I’m not going to give up on him, but it’s difficult.”\n\nSpeaking about her son Chaz, who is a transgender man, Cher said: “It was hard for me. It was really hard. I was so frightened.\n\n“Chaz is great, a great person, we’ve gone in and out a couple of times. But we’re very close. I’m close to both of them.”\n\nIn January, Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Jessica A Uzcategui ruled that a conservatorship was urgently needed for Allman, and declined to grant her the petition.\n\nSince releasing her new Christmas album earlier this year, Cher has discussed that the next record will be her final one.\n\nShe said the new record “will probably be my last, because you’re not really supposed to be singing at my age,” as “your voice runs out, you can’t hit the high notes or whatever”.\n\n“I’ve got great songs, so I really want to try my best, to do my best,” she added.\n\nCher, who has sold more than 100 million records around the world, has enjoyed a hugely successful film career, winning the best actress Oscar for 1987’s Moonstruck.\n\nHer other film roles include 2018’s Mamma Mia!

Ndërsa zgjedhjet po afrohen, modeli gjerman i biznesit po kriset, shkruan The Economist.\n\nMinistria e Financave e shtetit jugor gjerman Baden-Württemberg, ku kanë selinë kompani gjigante si Bosch, Mercedes dhe ZF Friedrichshafen, është një vend i përsosur për të kuptuar ankthet e Gjermanisë.\n\nRajonin e ka mbërthyer frika e deindustrializimit teksa po afrohen zgjedhjet që duket se do t’i japin fund mandatit të kancelarit Olaf Scholz, nëse nuk shkarkohet më parë nga partia e vet.\n\nDanyal Bayaz, ministri i Financave i shtetit Baden-Württemberg, shqetësohet se Gjermania nuk ka arritur të përfitojë siç duhet nga globalizmi i 15 viteve të fundit, duke mos investuar mjaftueshëm në sferën publike, në një epokë me norma të ulëta interesi.\n\nTani, përballë krizës së energjisë, rritjes së konkurrencës nga Kina dhe mundësisë që Amerika e Donald Trump të vendosë tarifa importi prej 10-20%, modeli i biznesit i Gjermanisë, duket se është “në kolaps”.\n\nZoti Bayaz ankohet se Gjermania nuk pati aftësinë për të shfrytëzuar teknologjinë e re, pavarësisht se vendi njihet në fusha si kërkimi dhe inxhinieria. Ai vë në dukje se firma e fundit startup e suksesshme në Gjermani, ishte SAP, një kompani softuerësh, e themeluar që në kohën kur Franz Beckenbauer udhëhoqi ekipin e futbollit të Gjermanisë Perëndimore drejt fitores, në Kampionatin Europian të vitit 1972.\n\nGjermania ka mbi 60 herë më shumë banorë se Estonia, por vetëm 15 herë më shumë kompani “unicorn” (“njëbrirëshe”, firma private startup me vlerë mbi 1 miliard dollarë).\n\nKy është një problem i njohur për ekonominë e vendit. Industria gjermane, sidomos kompanitë e vogla dhe të mesme, i kanë përqendruar forcat në rritje dhe zgjerim, duke e lënë industrinë të papërgatitur ndaj goditjeve të papritura teknologjike, si ardhja e automjeteve elektrike. Lidhjet e rehatshme midis biznesit, bankave dhe politikanëve, nxitën vetëkënaqësinë dhe qëndresën ndaj reformave të reja.\n\nRespektimi dogmatik i rregullave fiskale çoi në ndryshkje të urave, prishje të shkollave dhe vonesa të trenave. Rritjet në tregjet e huaja shtuan fitimet e bizneseve gjermane për njëfarë kohe, por ky model i udhëhequr nga eksporti, e la Gjermaninë të pambrojtur kur erërat e globalizimit u kthyen në drejtimin e kundërt.\n\nTani, Gjermania po korr atë që mbolli, edhe pse vitin e kaluar zuri vendin e Japonisë, si ekonomia e tretë më e madhe në botë. Në fakt, vendi pothuajse nuk ka pasur fare një rritje reale të PBB-së, që nga koha e pandemisë. E ardhmja bëhet edhe më e zymtë po të marrin parasysh rreziqet e një lufte tregtare të shkaktuar nga Donald Trump.\n\nKompania Volkswagen, që është prodhuesi më i madh i makinave në Europë, do të mbyllë për herë të parë në historinë e vet 87-vjeçare, deri në 30,000 vende pune. Papunësia e vendit ka qenë historikisht e ulët, por tashmë po rritet.\n\nNjë tjetër shqetësim i madh për kompanitë gjermane janë çmimet e larta të energjisë, sidomos pasi Gjermania u detyrua të shkëputej nga gazi rus, pasi Vladimir Putin pushtoi Ukrainën. Gjendja e vështirë e kompanive është veçanërisht problematike në një vend si Gjermania, ku manifaktura ende përbën rreth 20% të vlerës së shtuar bruto.\n\nKjo është pothuajse sa dyfishi i kontributit që jep kjo industri në vlerën e shtuar bruto të Francës, megjithëse, pasi manifaktura industriale gjermane arriti kulmin në vitin 2018, që atëherë pesha e saj në vlerën e shtuar bruto të vendit, është ulur më shpejt se në çdo shtet të BE-së (shih grafikun 1), veçanërisht në sektorët që përdorin shumë energji, si prodhimi i çelikut.\n\nPorositë janë pakësuar dhe investimet e planifikuara janë shtyrë, ose janë zhvendosur jashtë vendit. Shefi i kompanisë së çelikut Thyssenkrupp, që ka dalë me humbje, ka thënë se Gjermania është “në mes të një deindustrializimi”.\n\nEdhe shitësit me pakicë janë goditur nga kriza. Pas pushtimit të Rusisë, Raoul Rossmann, i cili drejton një zinxhir farmacish me seli pranë Hanoverit, që mban mbiemrin e familjes, vizitoi me radhë degët e kompanisë për të gjetur një mënyrë si mund të kursenin në faturat e energjisë.\n\nProbleme të tjera janë mungesa e punëtorëve të kualifikuar ndërsa popullsia gjermane po plaket, dhe shtresat e burokracisë, shumica e të cilave burojnë nga Brukseli, dhe që Instituti IFO në Mynih, llogarit se i kushtojnë ekonomisë gjermane 146 miliardë euro (154 miliardë dollarë) në vit. Sipas Sander Tordoir në Qendrën për Reformën Europiane (CER), një faktor i rëndësishëm në rënien e ekonomisë gjermane ka qenë edhe ndryshimi i marrëdhënieve me Kinën.\n\nNë dekadat 2000 dhe 2010, Gjermania ishte në një pozicion të përsosur për të kënaqur oreksin kinez me makinat, kimikatet dhe pajisjet e sakta gjermane. Eksportet e mallrave gjermane drejt Kinës u rritën me 34% midis viteve 2015 dhe 2020, ndërsa ato të vendeve të tjera ranë. Deri në vitin 2020, Kina ishte një importues neto i makinave, por vitin e kaluar, ajo u bë eksportuesi më i madh në botë.\n\nKështu, kompanitë kineze po shndërrohen nga klientë, në konkurrentë, duke i rrëmbyer pjesën e tregut jo vetëm industrisë gjermane të automobilave, por edhe kompanive të tjera prodhuese gjermane. “Nuk ka të bëjë vetëm me automjetet, por edhe me makineritë dhe kimikatet”, thotë zoti Tordoir.\n\nSiç vë në dukje Clemens Fuest, nga qendra IFO, Kina tani përbën vetëm 6% të totalit të eksporteve gjermane, afërsisht sa Holanda fqinje. Por marrëdhënia e Gjermanisë me Kinën, nuk ka të bëjë vetëm me varësinë nga eksportet. Në një studim, zoti Tordoir dhe Brad Setser, një ekonomist në Këshillin për Marrëdhëniet me Jashtë, përshkruajnë se si “goditja e dytë e Kinës”, mund të përkeqësojë edhe më tepër problemet industriale të Gjermanisë.\n\nTregu i brendshëm i Kinës nuk mund të përthithë prodhimin e tepërt të prodhuesve të tij të subvencionuar nga shteti, dhe ndërsa ata kërkojnë klientë jashtë vendit, ka shpërthyer suficiti tregtar i vendit. Ky është një problem për kompanitë gjermane që operojnë brenda vendit dhe jashtë.\n\n“Tregjet e ndikuara nga shteti kinez, mund të ofrojnë nivele të paarsyeshme financimi për investimet kineze, duke lënë në baltë prodhimin gjerman”, shkruajnë ata.\n\nNdërsa eksportet gjermane në Kinë kanë rënë, Amerika ka zënë pjesërisht vendin e tyre (shih grafikun 2). Disa kompani kanë shfrytëzuar mundësitë e hapura nga shkëputja e Amerikës nga teknologjia kineze; të tjera kanë përfituar nga subvencionet e Ligjit për Uljen e Inflacionit. Por Donald Trump është një kërcënim për të gjitha këto.\n\nAi jo vetëm që mund të rrisë tarifat, për të cilat banka gjermane Bundesbank mendon se mund ta zvogëlojnë PBB-në gjermane me një pikë përqindje, por kufizimet e reja amerikane mund të godasin edhe kompanitë prodhuese gjermane që përdorin inpute kineze. Këto veprime nga ana e Amerikës do të shtynin eksportuesit kinezë që të kërkonin tregje alternative jashtë Europës.\n\nNjë diplomat thotë se industria gjermane është e ndarë për sa i përket Kinës. Kompanitë Volkswagen dhe BMW po planifikojnë investime të reja të mëdha në prodhimin kinez.\n\nPër shkak të lobimit nga sektori i saj i makinave, Gjermania ishte një nga pesë shtetet europiane që votuan kundër tarifave të BE-së ndaj importeve të makinave kineze, në tetor. Brenda qeverisë gjermane ka shumë tension midis diplomatëve dhe politikanëve më të ashpër.\n\nKëta të fundit duan ta ndëshkojnë Kinën me kufizime tregtare për mbështetjen e ushtrisë ruse, ndërsa të tjerë që shqetësohen më tepër për industrinë, kanë frikë se kjo është një masë që Gjermania me rritje të ulët ekonomike, nuk mund ta përballojë dot.\n\nHistoria e deindustrializimit mund të jetë më e ndërlikuar nga sa duket. Humbja e vendeve të punës në sektorin e manifakturës, ul produktivitetin e Gjermanisë, që tashmë ka qenë në rënie prej vitesh. Por vlera e shtuar bruto në manifakturë ka mbetur e qëndrueshme, edhe pse prodhimi ka rënë.\n\nMe fjalë të tjera, disa prodhues gjermanë, mund të bëjnë mallra më të vlefshme, duke shitur më pak prej tyre. Kjo metodë e “cilësisë mbi sasinë”, siç shprehet Deutsche Bank, mund të jetë premtuese për kompanitë gjermane të teknologjisë së lartë, duke përfshirë makinat luksoze. Gjermania vazhdon të ketë përparësi në teknologjinë e gjelbër, duke përfshirë turbinat me erë dhe elektrolizatorët.\n\nPor kjo nuk mund të kompensojë humbjet në fusha të tjera. Gjermania duhet të kapërcejë “zakonin e saj të keq industrial”, thotë Moritz Schularick nga Instituti i Kiel-it për Ekonominë Botërore.\n\nIndustritë që përdorin shumë energji, nuk janë rritur për dy dekada. Sektori i makinave ka humbur vendet e punës prej gjashtë vjetësh dhe një kthesë në horizont duket e pamundur. “Për vite me radhë, ata kishin besimin se ‘ne jemi më të mirët’, dhe papritmas kjo mbaroi”, thotë një zyrtar i BE-së.\n\nForca të thella strukturore veprojnë në modelin industrial të Gjermanisë. Të bindësh gjermanët se duhet gjetur një alternativë ndaj të qenët fuqi e madhe në eksport, është një përpjekje që kërkon vite, jo muaj. Nuk mund të kompensohet lehtë as rënia e tregtisë me rajonet e tjera të botës.\n\nPavarësisht përpjekjeve të shumta të Gjermanisë, bisedimet për tregti të lirë midis BE-së dhe bllokut amerikanojugor Mercosur, janë zvarritur tashmë prej 25 vjetësh. (Franca, midis vendeve të tjera, është kundër marrëveshjes.)\n\nDisa mendojnë se një mjet më i dobishëm për t’i dhënë vrull ekonomisë, do të ishte reformimi i një pjese të modelit gjerman që duket se është kthyer në pengesë: frena e borxhit, e cila kufizon deficitin buxhetor strukturor vjetor të qeverisë federale në 0.35% të output-it. Frena e borxhit është një relike e një epoke të shkuar, thotë Max Krahé nga grupi kërkimor Dezernat Zukunft, me seli në Berlin.\n\nKy ligj është krijuar në një kohë kur Gjermania mbështetej në vendet e tjera me deficite, për të nxitur ekonominë e saj. Në një botë ku globalizimi ka ngecur, ky model nuk funksionon më.\n\nNdërkohë, nevojat e Gjermanisë për investime publike (që sipas një vlerësimi shkojnë në rreth 600 miliardë euro gjatë dhjetë viteve), janë bërë tepër të mëdha për t’u shpërfillur (shih grafikun 3).\n\nPër më tepër, nevojiten edhe fonde të reja për mbrojtjen. Gjermania këtë vit arriti më në fund objektivin e NATO-s për shpenzimin e 2% të PBB-së në mbrojtje, por vetëm falë një fondi të posaçëm që së shpejti do të përfundojë. Me shumë gjasa, do të nevojiten edhe më tepër për të plotësuar kërkesat e administratës së re Trump.\n\nPër këto arsye, mendohet se koalicioni i ardhshëm qeveritar, ndoshta i udhëhequr nga kancelari i ardhshëm Friedrich Merz, udhëheqësi i Partisë Kristiano-Demokrate i qendrës së djathtë, do të jetë i hapur për një reformë modeste në ligjin e frenimit të borxhit. (Gjermania do të mbajë zgjedhje në muajin shkurt, pas përmbysjes së koalicionit tripartiak këtë muaj.)\n\nNëse kryhen reformat e nevojshme, lulëzimi i investimeve mund të ndihmojë në kompensimin e humbjeve të eksportit në një periudhë afatshkurtër. Gjermania do të përfitonte shumë nga investime në arsim dhe infrastrukturë, fusha ku është mbrapa kolegëve europianë dhe investime të tilla mund të përshpejtojnë normën e rritjes afatgjatë të vendit.\n\nKa shumë ide për reforma, duke përfshirë rritjen e deficitit të lejuar (ose zëvendësimin e tij me udhëzime më të gjera), përjashtimin e investimeve publike nga kufijtë e huamarrjes ose krijimin e fondeve jashtë rezervave për infrastrukturën ose mbrojtjen.\n\nSidoqoftë, për t’u kthyer në ndryshime në Kushtetutë, të gjitha këto do të kërkonin një shumicë prej dy të tretash në të dyja dhomat e parlamentit.\n\nDhe ka shumë gjasa që në zgjedhjet e ardhshme, partitë e skajeve të fitojnë rreth një të tretën e pakicës në Bundestag, që mjafton për të hedhur poshtë propozime të tilla ligjore. Për këtë arsye, socialdemokratët në qeveri, i kanë kërkuar zotit Merz që ta japë që tani mbështetjen për reformën, pasi kjo do t’u jepte partive pro-reformës mbështetjen që i nevojitet për miratimin e saj. Deri tani, ai nuk ka pranuar.\n\nThorsten Benner, i cili drejton Institutin Global të Politikave Publike të Berlinit, thotë se Gjermania është zhvendosur nga “optimizmi i lehtë” i viteve të qeverisë së Angela Merkelit, në një “kurth të zymtë” ku probleme si politika jofunksionale, kufizimet e frenës së borxhit, burokracia e tepërt dhe mosbesimi publik, përforcojnë njëri-tjetrin. Ai shpreson se qeveria e ardhshme mund të veprojë si një forcë ndryshimi.\n\nKjo nuk është e pabesueshme. Në vend ka një rënie morali aq të thellë, sa që është rritur ndjesia se një ndryshim rrënjësor është tashmë i pashmangshëm. Në këtë sfond do të lidhet marrëveshja e koalicionit të ardhshëm qeveritar.\n\nMerz mund të pranojë reformat e frenimit të borxhit nëse aleatët e tij bien dakord për uljen e taksave ose reformën e mirëqenies. Por do të ishte shumë ironike nëse llogaritë e thjeshta parlamentare pengojnë një ndryshim të madh dhe të nevojshëm për Gjermaninë.","url":"https://www.gazetatema.net/ekonomia/rrezimi-i-mitit-gjerman-nga-nje-ekonomi-ne-lulezim-ne-nje-ekonomi-te-de-i471390","image":"https://media.gazetatema.net/gazetatema.net/media3/-1200-630-45d69cbf51b49e904767135425c2bc36.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-12-15 00:00:16","author":"Tema","authors":["Tema"],"language":"en","source_country":"al","sentiment":0.088},{"id":273246662,"title":"Tim Walz thought his lack of wealth was 'real flex' against Trump: 'How ... did we lose to a billionaire?","text":"Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz marveled in a post-election interview that middle-class Americans struggling with economic issues chose billionaire Donald Trump over him and Vice President Kamala Harris, a team he billed as a more middle-class ticket by comparison. Walz, Harris' running mate, sat down for an interview with Minnesota Public Radio on Thursday where he weighed in on what he thought went wrong during the Democratic presidential campaign. He concluded there must have been a disconnect with the Harris campaign’s messaging to middle-class voters if they went on to vote for a rich candidate like Trump. \"I thought it was a real flex when the Wall Street Journal pointed out that I might have been the least wealthy person to ever run for vice president,\" Walz told MPR News. HARRIS NEVER LED TRUMP, INTERNAL POLLS SHOWED — BUT DNC OFFICIALS WERE KEPT IN THE DARK \"How in the world did we lose to a billionaire or a venture capitalist, when we were making the case of a country attorney and a high school teacher?\" he asked later in the interview, contrasting his ticket with Trump’s. Walz made the point that he thought his more humble economic status should have appealed to voters, and seemed puzzled that wasn’t the case. \"And I thought that would be something people say, ‘Well, this guy knows where we’re coming from. He’s had to pay his bills and still does,'\" he said, referring to himself. Earlier in the discussion, Walz stated, \"And this is the one that keeps me up at night, is I focused my whole career in focusing on the middle class… And it seemed like a lot of good ideas were coming from the Democrats.\" KAMALA HARRIS' BUNGLED ANSWER ON ‘THE VIEW’ ABOUT BIDEN SEEN AS TURNING POINT FOR CAMPAIGN \"I still believe that,\" he continued, \"but apparently in this election, not the majority of Americans did. They chose to vote with a billionaire, who’s talked about not paying overtime, who has a long history of not paying his workers, someone who wants to take away the ACA.\" Seeing this, Walz concluded that this happened because his party did not communicate their middle-class appeal well enough. \"So, I come back to the conclusion, is we did not do a good enough job – we as a Democratic Party and we as a ticket – did not do a good enough job of showing them that we understand where they’re coming from,\" the governor said. He added, \"And I feel like one of my roles is – going forward here is – figuring out a way to make the case to the public, the American public, is that the Democratic Party really is focused on the things they care about.\" CLICK HERE FOR MORE COVERAGE OF MEDIA AND CULTURE In an interview with local Minnesota outlet KSTP-TV last week, the governor admitted he was surprised that his ticket lost the 2024 election. \"It felt like at the rallies, at the things I was going to, the shops I was going in, that the momentum was going our way, and it obviously wasn’t at the end,\" Walz said. \"So yeah, I was a little surprised.

The bazar360.com website said the dollar was being sold for about 755,000 rials. \n\nFacing an official inflation rate of about 35%, Iranians seeking safe havens for their savings have been buying dollars, other hard currencies, gold or cryptocurrencies, suggesting further headwinds for the rial. \n\nThe dollar has been gaining against the rial since trading around 690,000 rials in early November amid concerns that once inaugurated in January, Trump would re-impose his \"maximum pressure\" policy against Iran with tougher sanctions and empower Israel to strike Iranian nuclear sites. \n\nIran's currency again declined after the board of governors of the U.N. nuclear agency IAEA passed a European-proposed resolution against Tehran — increasing the risk of new sanctions — and following the downfall of Syria's President Bashar al-Assad, a long-time ally of the Islamic Republic. \n\nTrump in 2018 reneged on a nuclear deal struck by his predecessor Barack Obama in 2015 and re-imposed U.S. economic sanctions on Iran that had been relaxed. The deal had limited Iran's ability to enrich uranium, a process that can yield fissile material for nuclear weapons. \n\nIran's rial has lost more than 90% of its value since the sanctions were re-imposed in 2018.","url":"https://www.voanews.com/a/iran-currency-slips-to-new-lows-amid-us-europe-tensions-/7901604.html","image":"https://gdb.voanews.com/67029E6E-6A38-4CF4-BB13-0B39E49A0214_w1080_h608.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-12-14 23:56:21","author":"Reuters","authors":["Reuters"],"language":"en","source_country":"et","sentiment":-0.365},{"id":273239766,"title":"Trump taps Truth Social CEO Nunes to lead intelligence board","text":"WASHINGTON — \n\nU.S. President-elect Donald Trump on Saturday named ally Devin Nunes, a former U.S. lawmaker who now runs Trump's Truth Social platform, to serve as chairman of President's Intelligence Advisory Board. \n\nNunes, a longtime Trump defender who led the U.S. House of Representatives Intelligence Committee during part of Trump's first White House term, will remain Truth Social CEO while serving on the advisory panel, Trump said in a post on the platform. \n\nAs committee chair, Nunes alleged that the FBI had conspired against Trump during its investigation of Russian interference in the 2016 presidential elections in which Trump defeated Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton. \n\n\"Devin will draw on his experience as former Chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, and his key role in exposing the Russia, Russia, Russia Hoax, to provide me with independent assessments of the effectiveness and propriety of the U.S. Intelligence Community’s activities,\" Trump wrote. \n\nThe President's Intelligence Advisory Board is a White House panel that offers the president independent assessments of intelligence agencies' effectiveness and planning. \n\nTrump on Saturday also named IBM executive and former U.S. Department of Homeland Security official Troy Edgar to serve as the department's deputy secretary, and businessman Bill White to serve as the U.S. ambassador to Belgium.","url":"https://www.voanews.com/a/trump-taps-truth-social-ceo-nunes-to-lead-intelligence-board-/7901587.html","image":"https://gdb.voanews.com/8E6AA711-FB87-4837-B19C-20076EE33A64_w1080_h608.jpg","video":"https://www.voanews.com/embed/player/article/7901393.html","publish_date":"2024-12-14 23:56:21","author":null,"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"et","sentiment":0.098}]}
