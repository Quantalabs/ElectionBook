China’s Xi’an Jiaotong University has appealed for students at Harvard, singled out in Trump’s crackdown, promising “streamlined” admissions and “comprehensive” support.\n\nTrump’s administration has enacted massive funding cuts for academic research, curbed visas for foreign students - especially those from China - and plans to hike taxes on elite schools.\n\nTrump alleges top US universities are cradles of anti-American movements. In a dramatic escalation, his administration last week revoked Harvard’s ability to enrol foreign students, a move later blocked by a federal judge.\n\nMasaru Ishii, dean of the graduate school of medicine at Osaka University, described the impact on US universities as “a loss for all of humanity”.\n\nJapan aims to ramp up its number of foreign students to 400,000 over the next decade, from around 337,000 currently.\n\nJessica Turner, CEO of Quacquarelli Symonds, a London-based analytics firm that ranks universities globally, said other leading universities around the world were trying to attract students unsure of going to the United States.\n\nGermany, France and Ireland are emerging as particularly attractive alternatives in Europe, she said, while in the Asia-Pacific, New Zealand, Singapore, Hong Kong, South Korea, Japan, and mainland China are rising in profile.\n\nSWITCHING SCHOOLS\n\nChinese students have been particularly targeted in Trump’s crackdown, with US Secretary of State Marco Rubio on Wednesday pledging to “aggressively” crack down on their visas.\n\nMore than 275,000 Chinese students are enrolled in hundreds of US colleges, providing a major source of revenue for the schools and a crucial pipeline of talent for US technology companies.\n\nInternational students - 54% of them from India and China - contributed more than $50 billion to the US economy in 2023, according to the US Department of Commerce.\n\nTrump’s crackdown comes at a critical period in the international student application process, as many young people prepare to travel to the US in August to find accommodation and settle in before term starts.\n\nDai, 25, a Chinese student based in Chengdu, had planned to head to the US to complete her master’s but is now seriously considering taking up an offer in Britain instead.\n\n“The various policies (by the US government) were a slap in my face,” she said, requesting to be identified only by her surname for privacy reasons. “I’m thinking about my mental health and it’s possible that I indeed change schools.”\n\nStudents from Britain and the European Union are also now more hesitant to apply to US universities, said Tom Moon, deputy head of consultancy at Oxbridge Applications, which helps students in their university applications.\n\nHe said many international students currently enrolled at US universities were now contacting the consultancy to discuss transfer options to Canada, the UK and Europe.\n\nAccording to a survey the consultancy ran earlier this week, 54% of its clients said they were now “less likely” to enrol at an American university than they were at the start of the year.\n\nThere has been an uptick in applications to British universities from prospective students in the US, said Universities UK, an organisation that promotes British institutions. It cautioned, however, that it was too early to say whether that translates into more students enrolling.","summary":"TOKYO/BEIJING/LONDON: Universities around the world are seeking to offer refuge for students impacted by US President Donald Trump’s crackdown on academic institutions, targeting top talent and a slice of the billions of dollars in academic revenue in the United States.\n\n\n\nOsaka University, one of the top ranked in Japan, is offering tuition fee waivers, research grants and help with travel arrangements for students and researchers at US institutions who want to transfer.\n\n\n\nJapan’s Kyoto University and Tokyo University are also considering similar schemes, while Hong Kong has instructed its universities to attract top talent from the United States.

Trzaskowski had a narrow lead in pre-election opinion polls, but the difference was within the margin of error. \n\nVoting was due to end at 9 p.m. (1900 GMT), with exit polls published soon afterwards. The electoral commission says it hopes final results will be announced on Monday morning or early afternoon. \n\nParliament holds most power in Poland, but the president can veto legislation, so the vote is being watched closely in neighbouring Ukraine, as well as in Russia, the US and across the EU. \n\nBoth candidates agree on the need to spend heavily on defence, as US President Trump is demanding from Europe, and to continue supporting Ukraine in its fight against Russia’s three-year-old invasion. \n\nBut while Trzaskowski sees Ukraine’s future membership of NATO as essential for Poland’s security, Nawrocki has recently said he would not ratify it as president as this could draw the alliance into a war with Russia. \n\nTrzaskowski says strong relations with both Brussels and Washington are essential for Poland’s security, but Nawrocki, who met Trump in the White House in May, prioritises relations with the United States. \n\nTurnout stood at 24.8% at noon, the head of the electoral commission, Sylwester Marciniak, told reporters on Sunday. That compared with 24.7% at the same stage of voting in the second round of the presidential election in 2020, when final turnout was at 68.2%. \n\n“The most important thing is foreign policy,” said IT specialist Robert Kepczynski, 53, who was voting in Warsaw. “We can’t look both ways, to the US and the EU - and looking only to the US for help is short-sighted.” \n\nEconomist Maria Luczynska, 73, said that going to vote made her emotional. “(The election) is important because this is how we decide our future. What country my daughter, my grandchildren will live in.” \n\nIf Nawrocki wins, he is likely to follow a similar path to outgoing President Andrzej Duda, a PiS ally who has used his veto power to block the government’s efforts to undo the previous PiS administration’s judicial reforms, which the EU says undermined the independence of the courts. \n\nComing around a year and a half since Prime Minister Donald Tusk took office, the vote provides the toughest test yet of support for his broad coalition government, with Nawrocki presenting the ballot as a referendum on its actions. \n\nIn 2023, huge queues outside polling stations in large cities forced some to stay open later than planned. Analysts said that high participation by younger, liberal, urban Poles was crucial in securing a majority for Tusk. \n\nTrzaskowski is hoping that such scenes will be repeated on Sunday. \n\n“Encourage everyone, so that as many Poles as possible vote in the presidential election,” he told a rally in Wloclawek, central Poland, on Friday.","summary":"WARSAW: Poland was voting on Sunday in a tight presidential election that will determine whether the country cements its place in the mainstream of the European Union or turns toward Donald Trump-style nationalism. \n\n\n\nBoth Rafal Trzaskowski of ruling centrists Civic Coalition (KO) and his rival Karol Nawrocki, backed by nationalists Law and Justice (PiS), are hoping to mobilize their supporters and clinch the race.

After owners left, buildings were \"over-run\" and \"hijacked\" for illegal occupation. The cost to the state to rebuild them could exceed their value, and in such cases the courts could rule that an owner qualified for \"nil compensation\", he said. \n\n\"Nil is a form of compensation,\" Macpherson added, while ruling it out for farms.\n\nJohannesburg mayor Dada Morero told South Africa's Mail & Guardian newspaper that he wanted to use the buildings for the \"public good\", like accommodating around 300,000 people on the housing waiting list.\n\nHe added the owners of nearly 100 buildings could not be located. \n\n\"They have abandoned the buildings,\" he said, adding some of the owners were from the UK and Germany.\n\nBut Mabasa and Karberg told the BBC that in such cases compensation would probably still have to be paid for the buildings, though not the land.\n\nIf the state could not locate the owners, it \"must deposit the compensation with the Master of the High Court\" in case they returned or could be traced later, they said.","url":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cn05gnyzgd6o","image":"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/243d/live/8665f900-3d3b-11f0-af00-f94ff1cabcc0.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-06-02 01:00:01","author":"Farouk Chothia","authors":["Farouk Chothia"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.604},{"id":327142584,"title":"Transgender Athlete AB Hernandez shines at California State meet amid Trump’s controversial ban threat","text":"Sixteen-year-old AB Hernandez, a transgender athlete from Jurupa Valley High School, stood on the podium after the California Interscholastic Federation (CIF) state championships on Saturday(May 31), sharing two first-place titles in the high jump and triple jump, and finishing second in the long jump. But this wasn’t a typical meet. For the first time, CIF applied a new rule that allowed medals to be awarded in a way that recognized Hernandez’s wins while also honoring the performances of cisgender athletes as if Hernandez had not competed.Trump’s new orderThis compromise was born out of intense national debate. Just weeks earlier, President Donald Trump had signed an executive order demanding that transgender girls be barred from competing in girls’ sports, threatening to withhold federal funding from California if the state didn’t comply. The pressure ignited fierce discussion on fairness, rights, and how to balance them in school athletics.Despite this, the awards ceremony was peaceful and joyful. Hernandez and Brooke White of River City High School, who placed second in the long jump, embraced warmly on the podium, sharing smiles and medals. The high jump event ended in a three-way tie, with Hernandez and two other athletes clearing the same height, further underscoring the competitive nature of the meet.

That’s just PEPFAR, the HIV. You add them all up, that’s 300,000 dead, and we’re four months in. You add that all up and accumulate that over four years the number of dead grows very high,\" Brooks said on PBS News Hour Saturday. \"There are mass murderers in the world, Pol Pot, Mao Tse Tung, Stalin. We don’t have anybody on the list from America,\" Brooks added. TRUMP 'AGREED' ON SHUTTING DOWN USAID, ELON MUSK SAYS The New York Times columnist conceded the so-called deaths that he claims Musk is responsible for are not \"the same kind of genocide\" perpetrated by the despots he cited, but maintained that Musk’s closure of USAID made him partially responsible for mass deaths. The casualty counts Brooks cited were provided by a Boston University digital tracker that monitors deaths that it claims occur from changes in U.S. foreign aid created by Global Health Professor Brooke Nichols. When filtered for USAID cuts, the tracker states that 99,528 adults and 207,680 children have died this year from \"funding discontinuation.\" The communist regime Khmer Rouge killed between 1.5-3 million people between 1975 and 1979 in the Cambodian Genocide when the group plunged the country into mass violence targeting intellectuals and religious minorities following their overthrow of the Cambodian Monarchy and installation of Pol Pot as dictator in 1975. Thirty-eight million people died of starvation during Mao’s Great Leap Forward and the ensuing famine it produced. Mao biographers Jung Chang and Jon Halliday estimate that Mao was responsible for over 70 million peacetime deaths. Stalin killed over six million of his own citizens in the gulags, the Great Terror and other actions. CLICK HERE FOR MORE COVERAGE OF MEDIA AND CULTURE Brooks is purpotedly one of the few conservative voices at the New York Times. However, the columnist has espoused liberal views on a host of topics and has praised Biden’s presidency. He has also positioned himself as a fierce critic of President Donald Trump. \"Trumpism can be seen as a giant attempt to amputate the highest aspirations of the human spirit and to reduce us to our most primitive, atavistic tendencies,\" Brooks wrote in a recent column. USAID was set up in the early 1960s to act on behalf of the U.S. to deliver aid across the globe, particularly in impoverished and underdeveloped regions. The agency now operates in 60 nations and employs some 10,000 people, two-thirds of whom work overseas — though most of the on-the-ground work is contracted out to third-party organizations funded by USAID, according to a BBC report. The Trump administration, however, has argued that USAID is a corrupt organization that is mishandling U.S. taxpayer dollars. DOGE froze USAID funds and sent much of its staff home shortly after Trump took office. Musk, who was spearheading the DOGE effort to root out \"waste, fraud and abuse\" in government, has said the agency is beyond repair. The Trump administration announced that it would be cutting 90% of all USAID contracts in April. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP U2 frontman Bono recently made a similar claim as Brooks on Joe Rogan's podcast, saying 300,000 people have died due to USAID cuts.

Critics also warn that the bill's spending cuts would prove insufficient to pay for the proposed tax cuts and other spending priorities.However, some Republicans have voiced reservations about supporting the bill, with the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimating that it will add $3.8 trillion to the national debt over the next 10 years.The House of Representatives passed the bill by just one vote, 215-214, as two Republicans broke ranks and joined every House Democrat in opposing the bill.What To KnowPaul has spoken out against the spending bill and said he will not vote to pass it due to the inclusion of a mechanism that would allow Congress to increase the nation's debt limit by $5 trillion.On Sunday, the senator appeared on CBS News' Face the Nation when host Margaret Brennan asked, \"Do you have three other Republicans who will stand with you to block this bill?\"Paul responded: \"I think there are four of us at this point, and I would be very surprised if the bill at least is not modified in a good direction.\"He continued: \"I want to vote for it. I'm for the tax cuts. I voted for the tax cuts before, I want the tax cuts to be permanent, but at the same time I don't want to raise the debt ceiling $5 trillion, so I've told them if you take the debt ceiling off the bill, in all likelihood I can vote for what the agreement is on the rest of the bill. And it doesn't have to be perfect to my liking, but if I vote for the $5 trillion debt, who's left in Washington that cares about the debt? The GOP will own the debt once they vote for this.\"The GOP senator said Trump's \"big, beautiful bill\" increases spending by about $320 billion for the military and for the border.\"To put that perspective, that's more than all the [Department of Government Efficiency] DOGE cuts that we found so far, so the increase in spending put into this bill exceeds the DOGE cuts,\" he said Sunday.Paul then cited what he called inflated spending on the southern border wall, noting that the Trump administration managed to carry out its deportations without needing new spending or equipment and therefore deeming such expenditure in the bill is \"asking for too much money.\"\"In the end, the way you add it up to see if it actually is going to save money or add money is how much debt are they going to borrow—$5 trillion over two years is an enormous amount,\" he said.What People Are SayingSenator Rand Paul of Kentucky wrote on X, formerly Twitter, on Sunday: \"The American people, like the Great People of Kentucky, do not support Biden spending levels and $5T in new debt. Therefore, I will not. It's simple.\"Senator Ron Johnson, a Wisconsin Republican, wrote on X on Sunday: \"The House Budget process focused on $1.5 trillion in reduced spending and ignored the looming debt crisis. I am preparing a report: FY2025 Budget Reconciliation, Facts & Figures. I hope to complete it shortly and hold a hearing on it before we take any more Senate votes on the budget.\"President Donald Trump on Truth Social last week: \"THE ONE, BIG, BEAUTIFUL BILL\" has PASSED the House of Representatives!

Hate and violence of any kind will not be tolerated in Colorado,\" Senator Michael Bennet, a Colorado Democrat, wrote on X, formerly Twitter. \"I will remain in contact with local officials as new information becomes available.\"Meanwhile, a senior White House official told Newsweek that President Donald Trump \"has been briefed\" on the attack.Why It MattersThe FBI quickly said the attack in Boulder was being investigated as terrorism on Sunday, although local police initially said they had not yet made that determination. The attack reportedly came as peaceful demonstrators protested in support of freeing Israeli hostages who continue to be held by Hamas amid the ongoing war in Gaza.The ongoing Israel-Hamas war was sparked by an October 7, 2023, attack led by Hamas and allied Palestinian factions against Israel, resulting in the deaths of around 1,200 people and the abduction of 251. Today, around 58 people, fewer than half of whom are believed to still be alive, remain captive in Gaza. Over 54,000 people have died in Gaza, according to the Hamas-led Palestinian Health Ministry in the war-torn territory amid Israel's subsequent military campaign.The area where Sunday's attack occurred, known as Pearl Street Mall, attracts visitors and locals with its shops and restaurants. It is also the site of many local performances and demonstrations.What To KnowSeveral people are injured after the attack, according to local law enforcement. The extent of the injuries have not been confirmed, but local law enforcement said they ranged from minor to more severe, and that the suspect was injured as well.The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) said Sunday that it is investigating a \"targeted terror attack\" in Boulder, according to FBI Director Kash Patel in a post on X.\"We are aware of and fully investigating a targeted terror attack in Boulder, Colorado. Our agents and local law enforcement are on the scene already, and we will share updates as more information becomes available,\" he wrote.Deputy FBI director Dan Bongino also posted to X, saying the attack was being probed as an \"act of terror.\"\"All of the necessary assets will be dedicated to this investigation. If you have any investigative tips please contact the FBI. And if you aided or abetted this attack, we will find you. You cannot hide,\" Bongino wrote.Local law enforcement said during a Sunday afternoon press conference that the scene was contained and that a suspect was in custody. They did not release the individual's identity or share information about a motive. While they noted that they'd been in touch with the FBI, they said they had not yet determined it was a terrorism.Images from the scene of the attack showed an Israeli flag on the ground. The organization Run for Their Lives, which demonstrates peacefully for Israeli hostages held by Hamas, was holding an event in the location when the attack occurred.What Political Leaders Are SayingColorado Governor Jared Polis, a Democrat, wrote on X: \"As the American Jewish community continues to reel from the horrific antisemitic murders in Washington, D.C., it is unfathomable that the Jewish community is facing another terror attack here in Boulder, on the eve of the holiday of Shavuot no less. Several individuals were brutally attacked while peacefully marching to draw attention to the plight of the hostages who have been held by Hamas terrorists in Gaza for 604 days. I condemn this vicious act of terrorism, and pray for the recovery of the victims.\"Representative Jeff Crank, a Colorado Republican, on X: \"Sickened by the targeted terror attack in Boulder this afternoon. We are closely monitoring the attack and praying for the victims and first responders on the scene.\"Senator John Hickenlooper, a Colorado Democrat, on X: \"Hate of any kind has no home in Colorado. We're monitoring the reports of a horrific terror attack in Boulder this afternoon. Our thoughts are with the victims and their loved ones.\"Representative Gabe Evans, a Colorado Republican, on X: \"My team is monitoring the attack of terror just outside our district in Boulder. Hate has no home in Colorado. We are praying for all those affected. Thank you law enforcement for quickly responding to the scene. Please follow their updates as more information is released.\"Representative Joe Neguse, a Colorado Democrat, on X: \"We are closely monitoring, and are in contact with local law enforcement regarding the horrific attack on Pearl Street Mall. Praying hard for the victims.\"Denver Mayor Mike Johnston on X: \"Our hearts are with Boulder as we mourn the innocent victims of senseless violence. Denver Police Department is in contact with Boulder PD to provide any support they need. Hate has no place in Colorado.\"Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, a New York Democrat, on X: \"I'm closely monitoring the situation in Boulder. This is horrifying, and this cannot continue. We must stand up to antisemitism.\"Representative Elise Stefanik, a New York Republican, on X: \"I am heartbroken watching the footage of the horrific attack in Boulder, Colorado. A peaceful group of pro-Israel demonstrators holding a vigil for the hostages was reportedly attacked and set fire with Molotov cocktails by pro-Palestinian terrorists. This appears to be yet another act of antisemitic terrorism on U.S. soil. I'm praying for the victims and will continue demanding that the criminals responsible are brought to justice.\"What Happens NextAuthorities have yet to release more details about the victims and the suspect taken into custody.

A Nato summit later this month is expected to push for members to hit 3.5 per cent by 2032, while US President Donald Trump has already called for a jump to 5 per cent within the alliance.\n\nMr Healey told the BBC's Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg show: 'We have a historic commitment to increasing defence spending to 2.5 per cent in two years' time [2027]. We haven't hit that level since Labour was last in power in 2010. And an ambition to meet 3 per cent in the next Parliament.'\n\nThe presenter challenged him, asking: 'So it's still just an ambition? That's not a guarantee.'\n\nMr Healey declined to confirm spending 3 per cent of GDP in the next Parliament, instead talking about being able to 'deliver the vision' of today's review.\n\nSome of that vision was made clear last night as the Ministry of Defence announced plans to build up to 12 new nuclear-powered attack submarines to boost the Royal Navy's commitment to the Aukus Pacific defence partnership with Australia and the United States, while investing £15 billion in warheads.\n\nBut the first of these UK-built submarines is not expected to enter service before the late 2030s, defence sources confirmed last night. It will also be for future Parliaments to honour this spending commitment, so it could be cancelled.\n\nLast night, the Conservatives leapt on Labour's apparent muddle on defence, accusing Mr Healey of weakening UK security.\n\nTory defence spokesman James Cartlidge told the Mail: 'These promises on submarines are a fantasy fleet without real money to back them up.\n\n'The fact is, John Healey has been forced into a humiliating climb down by the Treasury after confirming, as recently as Thursday, that defence spending would definitely rise to 3 per cent.\n\n'But by Sunday he was backtracking completely. John Healey has been badly let down by the Chancellor – so now he knows how the rest of us feel.'\n\nIn an effort to clarify the situation, a Labour source told the Mail last night: 'He [Mr Healey] was expressing an opinion [to The Times last week], which is that he has full confidence that the Government will be able to deliver on its ambition to spend 3 per cent of GDP on defence in the next Parliament.'\n\nThe Mail's Don't Leave Britain Defenceless campaign has lobbied successive governments to commit to boosting military spending to 3 per cent by 2030, with defence chiefs warning the country cannot afford to delay.\n\nNaval experts welcomed the plans for up to 12 attack submarines – which are nuclear-powered but do not carry the UK's nuclear deterrent. But Matthew Savill, from the Royal United Services Institute defence think tank, added: 'This will be tremendously expensive and will have a lot riding on Aukus surviving as well as the expansion of the current maritime construction capacity of the UK.'\n\nEx-Navy commander Tom Sharpe agreed, saying: 'There is a ton of resourcing required. \"Up to 12\" is classically vague. One thing is for sure, the current Government defence spending commitment of 2.5 per cent of GDP by 2027 will not provide this.'\n\nIt comes after the Mail exposed how, in September last year, the Royal Navy did not have a single attack submarine at sea.\n\nMr Healey labelled today's review a 'message to Moscow', with the building of bomb factories, the purchase of thousands of long-range weapons and investment in drone technology and cyber defences. But he said he does not expect to raise the number of soldiers until the next Parliament.\n\nThe externally-led review, written by former Labour defence secretary and Nato secretary general Lord Robertson, makes 62 recommendations which the Government is expected to accept in full. The Prime Minister is expected to say today: 'National security is the foundation of my Plan for Change and this plan will ensure Britain is secure at home and strong abroad.","summary":"The Defence Secretary (pictured, with Sir Keir Starmer) has rowed back on a commitment to spend 3 per cent of GDP on national security by 2034.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-14770331/Labour-accused-embarrassing-retreat-defence-spending-Secretary-downgrades-GDP-military-pledge.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/06/01/22/98946073-0-image-m-73_1748812894884.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-06-01 23:12:37","author":"Editor,Mark Nicol","authors":["Editor","Mark Nicol"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.117},{"id":327136998,"title":"Michael Cohen Admits He’d ‘Selfishly’ Accept Trump Pardon: ‘It Would Make My Life a Little Easier’ | Video","text":"Michael Cohen would “selfishly” accept a pardon from the president if he were to issue one, Donald Trump’s former attorney told MSNBC’s Ayman Mohyeldin, Catherine Rampell, and Antonia Hylton on Sunday. \n\nDoing so “would make my life a little easier, going back into real estate, dealing with banks and so on,” he noted before adding, “But it’s not going to change my life.”\n\nCohen also said he had hoped to be pardoned by former President Biden. \n\n“I also am concerned about the 70 million Americans, 70 million that are basically scarlet lettered for the rest of their life as a felon,” he explained. “I did my did my time. I paid all the restitution … I owe no money. Why should I be a felon for life? That’s not the way the system should work.”\n\nIn that vein, Cohen also noted those approximately 70 million Americans “are all afflicted by the fact that they have felony convictions.” He added, “They can’t get housing. They can’t get bank accounts. You can’t get credit cards and so on.”\n\nFormer Congressman Jesse Jackson, Jr., is also hoping to receive a pardon from Trump. He and Cohen are “working on a policy that we believe would be like from the hand of God, which is what the president’s power that’s granted him in the Constitution,” Cohen explained. \n\n“So you look at the list of people, though, who have received pardons and commutations in recent days and weeks. What do you make of the pattern that’s emerging here, though? Some of them are really bad individuals,” he continued. “Others are also caught up in white collar tax issues. And I agree with the tax issues, the nonviolent. But there are several who, let’s just say, stole over a billion dollars, paid back 100 million dollars and now receive the pardon.”\n\nCohen also cited Trump’s “first term to the goal of using pardons in large part for a form of criminal justice reform” when the president “was meeting with Van Jones and others and, you know, it was in part a way for him to actually reach out to black and Latino voters.”\n\n“That does not seem to be his focus this time around,” he concluded.\n\nWatch the interview with Michael Cohen in the video above.","summary":"The president's former attorney also raised concerns about the \"70 million Americans ... that are basically scarlet lettered for the rest of their life as a felon\"\n\n\nThe post Michael Cohen Admits He&#8217;d &#8216;Selfishly&#8217; Accept Trump Pardon: &#8216;It Would Make My Life a Little Easier&#8217; | Video appeared first on TheWrap.","url":"https://www.thewrap.com/michael-cohen-admits-hed-selfishly-accept-trump-pardon-it-would-make-my-life-a-little-easier-video/","image":"https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/michael-cohen-msnbc.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-06-01 23:03:47","author":"Stephanie Kaloi","authors":["Stephanie Kaloi"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.57},{"id":327136436,"title":"FBI investigating 'targeted terror attack' in Colorado, director says","text":"The incident comes amid heightened tensions in the United States over Israel's war in Gaza, which has spurred both an increase in antisemitic hate crime as well as moves by conservative supporters of Israel led by President Donald Trump to branded pro-Palestinian protests as antisemitic.\n\nHis administration has detained protesters of the war without charge and cut off funding to elite US universities that have permitted such demonstrations.\n\nBrooke Coffman, a 19-year-old at the University of Colorado who witnessed the Boulder incident, said she saw four women lying or sitting on the ground with burns on their legs.

Originally from Conwy, she now lives and works in Washington DC, following a spell with the BBC and an international English news channel in Turkey. \n\nShe tries to support Welsh journalism as much as possible and has held sessions on journalism for the Coleg Cymraeg Cenedlaethol. As well as receiving the honour of the Gorsedd, she will also lead the Wales and the World at the Eisteddfod in Wrexham this year.\n\nRhun ap Iorwerth is best known as Anglesey's Senedd Member and since 2023 as leader of Plaid Cymru.

His former BBC colleagues, Dewi Llwyd and Dylan Jones, will also be invested into the Gorsedd this year. Dewi Llwyd, Bangor, reported on some of the biggest news stories in Wales and the world for almost half a century and was the face of S4C's election programmes. \n\n Until his recent retirement, Dylan Jones, Denbigh, presented various news programmes on radio and the football preview show 'Ar y Marc' since 1992. He began commenting on football matches in 1986, and became a news reporter after commenting on the Hillsborough disaster. \n\nLili Mai Jones is part of the women's football revolution in Wales and especially in Wrexham. Playing for the Wrexham Club Academy from the age of 12, she played for two seasons for Everton before rejoining Wrexham and has won a number of international caps for her country at under 15 and under 17 level. She is a familiar voice on radio and television programmes, discussing the growing influence of football on the physical and mental health of young women.\n\n The Aykroyd brothers, David and Nigel, from Bala are also honoured by the Gorsedd. They run a highly successful nightwear, daywear and swimwear company, which is an important employer in rural Wales. The contribution of the brothers has improved the arts, a number of initiatives and local sports, with the support that has driven CPD Y Bala to the Welsh Premier League and facilitated their European achievements, but one example of the contribution of the two to their local community. \n\n Three long serving volunteers are also being honoured by the Gorsedd this year.

For the Eisteddfod family, Dylan Wyn Jones, Mold, is 'Dylan Carafáns', and that is because he led the organization of the Eisteddfod's caravan field for many years. A mathematician and information technology specialist by profession, he spent two decades working across Europe before returning to Wales to ensure a Welsh language education for his children. And Dilwyn Price, Old Colwyn, is known to generations of Welsh children as the bubbly and infectious leader of the Urdd Jamborees.

But imagine if he added a key word and called it the Gulf of North America. That simple tweak would trigger a meaningful shift in perspective.The gulf’s current name dates to the mid-sixteenth century, coined by Spanish cartographers mapping the waters of New Spain, then a colony that encompassed much of present-day Mexico and parts of the southern US. It is, in other words, a legacy of European imperialism. True to his worldview, Trump envisions a new American imperialism, extending from Panama to Greenland.Geographically, the claim is a draw: depending on how you measure it, the US and Mexico have roughly the same amount of coastline along the gulf. What is clear is that the body of water is essentially enclosed by North America – an integral part of the Western hemisphere.Renaming it the Gulf of North America would serve as a reminder of that. It would also be a historic way for Trump to mark the first Fifa World Cup hosted by the three North American countries – Mexico, the US, and Canada – in 2026.To understand the Americas’ strategic importance in the twenty-first century, we must begin with their people. By mid-century, nearly one in three US residents will trace their heritage to Latin America, just as many once traced theirs to Europe. Economically, culturally, and politically, Americans of Hispanic origin will be more oriented towards Latin America, rather than towards Europe or Asia.Nearly 60% of Latinos in the US are of Mexican descent, laying a foundation for greater cross-border integration. While Trump has issued an executive order designating English as the official language of the US, Spanish is certainly not going away.Hundreds of millions of people in countries with close ties to the US speak it – Miami, for example, is often described as Latin America’s economic capital. In states like Texas, California, and Florida, Spanish-English bilingualism is often a practical necessity for business, education, and governance.Ironically, Trump has helped advance North American economic integration by accelerating the turn towards industrial policy that began with president Barack Obama’s auto-industry bailout and US$90 billion investment in clean energy. To be sure, Trump’s version relied on a different strategy: tariffs, tax cuts, and deregulation.His successor, Joe Biden, combined these approaches – retaining Trump’s tariffs while rebuilding infrastructure and subsidising green and high-tech industries. Both Trump and Biden encouraged nearshoring in response to geopolitical rivalry with China and post-pandemic supply-chain shocks. Now, Trump is doubling down on his first-term trade and economic policies.Mexico has been a major beneficiary of this shift. In 2023, it overtook China to become the largest US trade partner, with its total goods trade reaching nearly US$800 billion. In 2024, Mexico received more than US$35 billion in foreign direct investment, part of a larger nearshoring trend in Latin America.US firms are increasingly investing in Mexico, as well as countries in Central and South America, not just due to their proximity, but also because they are young, digitally connected, and economically ambitious.Even with rising US protectionism, the region’s geographic and cultural alignment makes it a better bet than Europe or Asia for companies producing goods and services for the US market.Politically, however, Trump often paints the region as a cesspool of criminality, focussing on gangs and drug trafficking. He is pressuring Mexican president Claudia Sheinbaum to stop the flow of drugs and people over the border, using his 25% tariff on Mexican auto, steel, and aluminum exports as a powerful bargaining chip.Moreover, Trump frames problems in a way that allows him to step in with “solutions” that suit his interests and, crucially, can be easily spun into political wins.For example, by emphasising the China-Mexico fentanyl pipeline – where China supplies precursor chemicals that Mexican cartels use to manufacture the drug – Trump justifies his trade war on both countries.Likewise, Trump has focussed his ire on the relatively small number of undocumented migrants in the US who have committed crimes – a problem that he can “address” with dramatic mass deportations of alleged Latin American gang members.Once this performative phase ends, Trump will almost certainly revive and take credit for the package of immigration reforms contained in last year’s bipartisan border-security bill, which the Republicans killed at Trump’s behest, so that he could continue campaigning on illegal immigration.These reforms could lay the groundwork for a US-Mexico migration agreement that would create a more fluid visa system for provisional workers. But decreasing immigration in the long term requires strengthening the Mexican economy and improving the government’s ability to fight corruption and protect its citizens.Meanwhile, demographic forces will continue to do their work. American Latinos will build businesses that connect communities across the Western hemisphere. Cultural and educational exchanges will grow organically. Even as many governments implement stricter visa rules, US citizens can still travel, study, and retire in Mexico and other Latin American countries.When Chicago-born Cardinal Robert Prevost became Pope Leo XIV, US newspapers trumpeted the first American pope. But the Vatican News heralded the arrival of the “second Roman Pontiff – after Pope Francis – from the Americas”. The point was not that Prevost had spent decades in Peru and had become a naturalised Peruvian citizen.It was that Pope Francis was from South America, and Pope Leo “is from the northern part of the continent”. Viewing the Americas as one continent is a useful way to see the world – an outlook that will probably gain ground this century.Trump is unlikely to accept my suggestion about the Gulf of North America. But his successor might. Regardless of the name, it is the geographic and economic reality.

You’ll also find data-based updates on past Daily Kos reporting, plus a vibe check on a trend that’s driving politics.\n\n“They are wrong. There is nothing to sustain that.”\n\nThat’s what former President Joe Biden said during an appearance on “The View” in early May, denying widespread reports that he suffered stark cognitive decline during his final years in office. But Americans just aren’t buying it.\n\nNew data from YouGov finds that Americans believe not only that Biden’s health and age limited his ability to carry out presidential duties but also that Democrats concealed his health information from the public. And these issues cut to the heart of a current problem facing the Democratic Party: How can it regain credibility with voters—including many Democrats—who just don’t trust the party right now?\n\nJust 6% of Americans think Biden’s age and health had no effect whatsoever on his ability to carry out presidential duties, according to a new poll YouGov conducted for The Economist. Eighty-six percent of Americans think his ability to be president was at least somewhat limited by his age and health, including 58% who think he was “severely limited” by it.\n\n“The Democratic Party at large didn’t buy into it,” Biden also claimed on “The View,” pointing to his victory in the 2024 Democratic presidential primaries, which were essentially uncontested.\n\nBut even before his disastrous June 2024 debate with Donald Trump, which culminated with the sitting president exiting the presidential race, Biden’s age and health worried Democrats. \n\nIn a February 2024 poll from YouGov, only 21% of Democrats said his health and age would not limit his ability to carry out presidential duties. A higher share (24%) said he would be “severely limited.” And in a New York Times/Siena College poll fielded that same month, 56% of Democrats and 59% of voters who backed Biden in the 2020 election said Biden was too old to be an effective president.\n\nOther polls from before the debate show similar numbers. In fact, in a YouGov poll from July 2022—two years before he dropped out of the 2024 race—only about 1 in 4 Democrats said Biden’s health and age had no effect on his ability to be president. \n\nAnd the numbers have only gotten worse for Biden. The latest YouGov/Economist poll finds that only 12% of Democrats think his age and health had no effect at all on his ability to be president, and 1 in 3 Democrats think his health and age severely limited him.\n\nThe issue has always been there for Democrats. And beyond that, Democrats aren’t the only people who vote in elections. The vast majority of registered voters (73%) in February 2024 thought Biden was too old to be an effective president, according to the New York Times/Siena College poll.\n\nWhy does this matter when Trump, a conspicuously deranged man, is the sitting president? Let’s be clear: Trump’s age and cognitive health are absolutely the more important story right now. And Americans are worried about it. In another new YouGov poll, just 31% of Americans think Trump’s age and health have no impact at all on his ability to be president. Another 29% thinks those things “severely limit” him, and that includes a majority of Democrats (58%) and a plurality of independents (29%).\n\nStill, the topic of Biden’s health and how Democrats handled it aren’t just issues of the past. They also threaten how the public views the Democratic Party at large. \n\nMost Americans (57%) think that Democrats hid information about Biden’s health from the public while he was president, according to the latest YouGov/Economist poll. That includes not only 1 in 4 Democrats but also more than 1 in 2 independents.\n\nOf course, if there was a cover-up, it clearly wasn’t a very good one. Just look at those pre-debate polls.\n\nEither way, a sizable portion of the voters the Democratic Party relies on to win elections just watched party officials spend years claiming that Biden was as sharp as ever and able to take on another presidential campaign, in the face of strong evidence otherwise, all while they themselves were worried about it. Is it really a surprise the party now faces such terrible favorability ratings?\n\nOnly 38% of Americans have a favorable view of the Democratic Party, while 60% have an unfavorable view, according to the Pew Research Center. That puts the party 22 percentage points underwater, compared with the Republican Party, which is 13 points underwater. However, more tellingly, just 75% of Democrats have a favorable view of their own party—the lowest share Pew has found in the past six years.\n\nTalking through what happened with Biden—what the party ignored, what it got wrong—is a good way for Democrats to regain credibility in the eyes of voters, to let them know that they’re done covering their ears, and that they want to listen again.\n\nAny updates?\n\n The “big, beautiful” tax bill that House Republicans passed recently would gut food assistance for low-income Americans, and that’s got even some Republicans vocally pissed. But a new data model from Data for Progress finds just how unpopular it is: In every House district in the nation, less than 15% of voters support cuts to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program.\n\n The Trump administration is narrowing access to COVID-19 boosters—so much for conservatives trying to claim the slogan “my body, my choice”—but a lot of Americans might not notice. Seventy percent of Americans haven’t gotten a COVID-19 vaccine in the past year, according to a new YouGov/Economist poll. And only 33% want to get a booster if one is approved this fall.\n\n In late April, Canada’s Liberal Party won an electoral victory everyone had expected them to lose handily—that is, until Trump returned to the White House and promptly started attacking the nation. And Liberals’ pushback to Trump seems to have helped them: 68% of Canadians who voted in the election said Trump played a role in their vote, according to a newly released YouGov survey. Eleven percent said he was their top concern when voting, and another 21% said he was a major concern.\n\nHowever much voters came to doubt Biden’s ability to carry out his presidential duties, they still gave him a much higher job approval rating than they currently give Trump.\n\nAccording to Civiqs, 46% of registered voters approved and 48% disapproved of how Biden was handling his presidency as of May 29, 2021, making for a net approval rating of -2 percentage points. Meanwhile, on May 29 of this year, 43% approve and 54% disapprove of Trump—a net approval rating of -11.","summary":"Survey Says is a weekly column rounding up the most important polling trends or data points you need to know about.

Barr asked Social Services Minister Tanya Plibersek and former deputy Prime Minister Barnaby Joyce on Monday.\n\nThe Sunrise guests clashed on Rudd's effectiveness as US ambassador. \n\nPlibersek said Rudd has been 'extraordinarily active' and developed 'excellent' relationships with both Republicans and Democrats.\n\n'You know that he's hardworking. He's got enormous capacity.

Trump later said on Truth Social that it will also apply to aluminium imported into the US.\n\n'We're imposing a 25 per cent increase. We're going to bring it to 50 per cent, the tariffs on steel into America, which will even further secure the steel industry in the United States,' Trump told the crowd of workers. \n\nTrade Minister Don Farrell said the new hike was 'unjustified' and 'not the act of a friend', and Australia would continue to oppose the tariffs.\n\n'They are an act of economic self-harm that will only hurt consumers and businesses who rely on free and fair trade.

President Donald Trump's ongoing clash with Harvard has ignited passionate discussions across the board. From sharp insights to thoughtful critiques, your comments have brought fresh perspectives that deepen the debate. Whether you agreed, challenged, or expanded the narrative, your voices once again brought this story to life in unexpected ways.Here are some of your highlighted comments from the past week.On the Latest on Donald Trump's Clash with Harvard Original Article: Donald Trump Says Harvard is 'Getting Their A** Kicked'Background: Trump and his administration have cracked down on Ivy League institutions, such as Harvard and Columbia University, since taking office in January.Original Comment: \"I'm not sure what Trump is trying to prove here. It's silly to think he is just hurting Harvard, he is permanently damaging the International reputation of the US and damaging its reputation for those that want to study in the US. And for what? A couple protests and some DEI policies. Trump decided that's worth tanking 10 Billion dollars in research from arguably the best university in the US. And he's proud of it.\" - KevinBer702What Makes the Comment Noteworthy: The commenter cuts straight to the heart of the broader consequences behind Trump's actions. Rather than focusing solely on the political optics, they highlight the potential damage to America's global reputation and its standing in higher education.On Plans for Trump's Administration to Revoke Visas for Chinese Students Original Article: Marco Rubio Announces New Plan to Revoke Chinese Student VisasBackground: Secretary of State Marco Rubio announced a new plan on Wednesday to \"aggressively revoke\" student visas issued to international students from China.Original Comment: \"Another court challenge that will end up as another loss for Trump. Can't single out students based on their race or national origin for blanket visa revocation, and any decision must be rooted in credible and sufficient evidence of some tangible threat to national security concerning the specific student. Nearly all Chinese students at Harvard are the very cream of the crop, and actually add significant value to US university education. National security threats are managed by our security clearance system and controlling access to secret and top secret information, not by the visa system.\" - MetteyyaWhat Makes the Comment Noteworthy: The commenter challenges the policy with a clear, informed perspective, arguing that targeting students undermines both legal standards and the strength of U.S. academia.On Calls for Universities to Align with the Trump AdministrationOriginal Article: Linda McMahon Says Colleges Must Be 'In Sync' with Trump AdministrationBackground: Education Secretary Linda McMahon said in an interview that U.S. colleges and universities should be \"in sync\" with the Trump administration.Original Comment: \"Only in a totalitarian nation-state would any university be REQUIRED to be \"in-sync\" with the presidential administration. Universities by definition are autonomous regarding academic rigor and freedom; they are apolitical.\" - countryman_1776What Makes the Comment Noteworthy: The commenter argues for the principle of academic independence, warning against political interference in universities. They highlight concerns that requiring alignment with the administration could undermine the core values of academic freedom and institutional autonomy.Further Reflections on Universities Aligning with the Trump AdministrationOriginal Comment: \"The American university system has been the envy of the world for decades. That's due in large part to the deeply rooted tradition of academic freedom. The expectation that a university be in sync with the administration is antithetical to the idea of academic freedom.\" - vasant073What Makes the Comment Noteworthy: This reader emphasizes the global reputation of the American university system, attributing its success to long-standing traditions of academic freedom. They challenge the notion that universities should conform to political agendas, reinforcing why such expectations conflict with academic ideals.On Asian Colleges Trying to Woo Harvard Students – and The Possible FalloutOriginal Article: Asian Colleges Aim to Woo Harvard International StudentsBackground: As Harvard University faces looming restrictions on enrolling international students, colleges across Asia are positioning themselves to attract some of the world's brightest minds.Original Comment: \"So the US has an advantage in research, medicine and AI but if you are telling potential students to go somewhere else, the money that foreign tuitions that could be used for us citizens scholarships would also disappear. This is unironically the biggest mistake you can make.\" - andrew.lansanganWhat Makes the Comment Noteworthy: The commenter points out the potential economic and academic fallout of pushing international students away.

But the majority of the tariffs were paused by Trump for 90 days in the wake of stock market volatility.\n\nSpeaking with Fox News, Lutnick said he expects the President to stand firm when that 90-day pause expires at the start of July.\n\nA key trade deal would be with China, which US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said has \"not been a reliable partner\" and claimed it was holding back products in the global supply chain.\n\nThe president's top trade advisers presented a united front in their appearances on separate US morning television programmes on Sunday.\n\nThey remained steadfast on the tariff agenda, which has faced ongoing challenges in the nation's court system.\n\n\"Tariffs are not going away,\" Lutnick said in response to the court cases.\n\nHe added that the US \"could sign lots of deals now\", but the Trump administration is working to \"make them better\".\n\n\"You're going to see over the next couple of weeks, really, first-class deals for the American worker,\" he said..\n\nAnd on the expiration of the 90-day pause, Lutnick said: \"I think that's the deadline, and the President's just going to determine what rates people have if they can't get a deal done\".\n\nWhen the pause expires, in theory, it would enact sweeping tariffs on countries across the globe.\n\nImports from about 60 trading partners that the White House has described as the \"worst offenders\", including the European Union, Vietnam, South Africa and more, will face higher rates.\n\nTrump has described these taxes as payback for unfair trade policies.\n\nOn Friday, Trump announced the US will double its current tariff rate on steel and aluminium imports from 25% to 50%, beginning on Wednesday.\n\nLike with most of the announced tariffs, Trump said the move would help boost the local steel industry, while reducing US reliance on China.\n\nUS steel manufacturing has decreased in recent years, and countries like China, India and Japan have become the world's biggest producers.\n\nThe steel tariffs come as many hold their breath waiting for further announcements. from the Trump administration.\n\nTrump's tariff policies have upended global trade, and cracks have formed - or widened - among relationships between the US and other countries, including some of its closest partners.\n\nWorld watches for news of US-China trade deal\n\nThe levies have worsened relations between China and the US, the two largest global economies, and launched the countries into a tit-for-tat trade battle.\n\nUnder a trade truce struck in May at Geneva, the US lowered tariffs imposed on goods from China from 145% to 30%. China's retaliatory tariffs on US goods dropped from 125% to 10%.\n\nBut a larger trade deal between the countries has not been established.\n\nOn Sunday, Treasury Secretary Bessent told CBS News, the BBC's US news partner, details of the trade will be \"ironed out\" once Chinese President Xi Jinping and Trump speak, but he did not say exactly when that conversation is expected.\n\n\"What China is doing is they are holding back products that are essential for the industrial supply chains of India, of Europe. And that is not what a reliable partner does,\" Bessent said.\n\nThe Treasury Secretary claimed China could be withholding some products because of a \"glitch\", or he said it could be \"intentional\" - but the administration would not know for sure until a call with both countries happened.\n\nOn Friday, China urged the US to \"immediately correct its erroneous actions, cease discriminatory restrictions against China and jointly uphold the consensus reached at the high-level talks in Geneva\".\n\nWhite House National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett told ABC News on Sunday that Trump and Xi are expected to talk this week, and said \"both sides have expressed a willingness to talk\".\n\n\"The bottom line is that we've got to be ready in case things don't happen the way we want,\" Hassett said of the expected China talks. \"Because if we have cannons without cannonballs, then we can't fight a war.\"\n\n\"We have to have a steel industry that's ready for American defence,\" he said.","summary":"US President Donald Trump is not planning to extend the pause to his sweeping global tariffs, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said.","url":"https://www.myjoyonline.com/trumps-tariffs-not-going-away-as-deadline-for-deals-loom-top-adviser-says/","image":"https://www.myjoyonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/image-1688.png","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-06-01 22:30:00","author":"Abubakar Ibrahim,Bbc 30pm","authors":["Abubakar Ibrahim","Bbc 30pm"],"language":"en","source_country":"gh","sentiment":-0.26},{"id":327128300,"title":"Is Nvidia a Buy?","text":"Nvidia (NVDA -2.85%) just delivered another record-breaking quarter, sending its stock up 5% and tying Microsoft as the most valuable publicly traded company by market capitalization, at the time of this writing. Despite the strong results, questions linger as the company faces mounting geopolitical pressure and tariff uncertainty. Let's break down the chipmaker's latest performance and explore what the current challenges mean for long-term investors to determine whether Nvidia is a buy, hold, or sell.\n\nHere are the results from Nvidia's latest blowout quarter\n\nFor the first quarter of fiscal 2026, Nvidia reported $44.1 billion in revenue, representing a 69% year-over-year increase and a 12% increase from its previous quarter, fiscal Q4 2025. Nvidia's net income totaled $18.8 billion, a 26% increase year over year, despite the company incurring a $4.5 billion charge related to new U.S. export restrictions.\n\nAs for highlights, the company's data center revenue surged to $39.1 billion in the quarter, representing a 73% increase from the prior year. Management also announced that it will be building factories in the U.S. in partnership with others to produce artificial intelligence (AI) supercomputers, which may alleviate some tariff concerns.\n\nAdditionally, Nvidia continued to return capital to shareholders, with a modest quarterly dividend of $0.01 per share, and repurchased $14.1 billion worth of shares during the quarter. Notably, the management has spent $40 billion over the past 12 months on share buybacks, decreasing its share count by just 0.8% due to the company's massive $3.4 trillion market capitalization.\n\nTariff twists and turns\n\nWhile Nvidia continues to break records, it encountered the aforementioned geopolitical hiccup during the quarter. On April 9, the U.S. government abruptly required Nvidia to secure a license before shipping H20 chips to China. The problem? H2O was already deeply embedded in the company's go-to-market strategy and had generated $4.6 billion in revenue during the quarter. Nvidia was left holding the bag on $4.5 billion worth of unsellable inventory and was unable to ship an additional $2.5 billion in orders before the restrictions took effect.\n\nThe China market, once seen as a dependable pillar of growth, now represents a major wildcard for Nvidia. With U.S. firms locked out, Nvidia warned that losing access to this near-$50 billion AI accelerator market would materially benefit foreign competitors.\n\nJust after Nvidia released its fiscal Q1 earnings, another twist emerged: A federal court blocked President Donald Trump from using emergency powers to impose broad tariffs. While the decision, which the Trump administration intends to appeal, may ease trade tensions for now, it highlights how quickly trade policy can shift and put the brakes on Nvidia's unparalleled growth.\n\nNvidia's Blackwell is its next growth driver\n\nDespite the company's geopolitical headaches, Nvidia continues to innovate. Its Blackwell chips -- designed for massive-scale AI workloads -- are the company's next big breakthrough, according to CEO Jensen Huang. To support its growth, the company launched Blackwell Ultra and Nvidia Dynamo during its latest quarter, designed to power the next generation of reasoning AI models. Huang said:\n\nGlobal demand for Nvidia's AI infrastructure is incredibly strong. AI inference token generation has surged tenfold in just one year, and as AI agents become mainstream, the demand for AI computing will accelerate. Countries around the world are recognizing AI as essential infrastructure -- just like electricity and the internet -- and Nvidia stands at the center of this profound transformation.\n\nTo support the development of its Blackwell product, Nvidia announced in April that it will build and test these chips in Arizona and its AI supercomputers in Texas. Given the company's tariff concerns, it's an unlikely coincidence that management chose the U.S. as the location for manufacturing its newest product.\n\nLooking ahead, management projects $45 billion in revenue for its next quarter, plus or minus 2%. Notably, that outlook includes an $8 billion hit from ongoing H20 restrictions, which will continue to impact gross margins. When excluding the projected $8 billion loss, management believes it will achieve a range of \"mid-70%\" gross margins later in its fiscal 2026, which would be in line with its 75% gross margin for its previous fiscal year.\n\nIs Nvidia a buy, sell, or hold?\n\nGiven Nvidia stock's meteoric rise, it still trades at a steep 45 times trailing earnings. Yet the company has largely grown into that premium, with a three-year median price-to-earnings ratio of around 63.\n\nAs a clear leader in the fast-moving world of artificial intelligence, Nvidia continues to break new ground, most recently with its next-generation Blackwell chips and AI supercomputers. For growth-focused investors seeking exposure to transformative AI technology, Nvidia remains a compelling long-term investment, even amid geopolitical risks and an elevated valuation multiple.","summary":"Here's a look at Nvidia's latest quarterly earnings and management's outlook.","url":"https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/06/01/is-nvda-a-buy/","image":"https://g.foolcdn.com/image/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fg.foolcdn.com%2Feditorial%2Fimages%2F816364%2Fnvidia-headquarters-with-grey-nvidia-sign-in-front-with-nvidia-logo-1.png&amp;op=resize&amp;w=1200&amp;h=630","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-06-01 22:30:00","author":"Collin Brantmeyer","authors":["Collin Brantmeyer"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.181},{"id":327126706,"title":"Fresh call for new US envoy after latest Trump tariff threat","text":"Barnaby Joyce has renewed his call for a new Australian ambassador in Washington after Donald Trump pledged to hike blanket tariffs on steel and aluminium to 50 per cent.\n\nThe Coalition attack dog said on Monday that Australia’s continued failure to secure a carve out came down to Kevin Rudd, who has been Canberra’s envoy to the US since 2023.\n\nMr Rudd, a former Labor prime minister, has been highly critical of the US President over the years, calling Mr Trump a “village idiot”, “nuts”, the “most destructive president in history” and a “traitor to the West”.\n\nMeanwhile, Mr Trump has called Mr Rudd “nasty” and “not the brightest bulb”.\n\nMr Joyce argued that while Mr Rudd was a “good guy”, he was not right for the job.\n\n“Kevin Rudd is a good guy but he’s not kicking a goal in the United States,” the Nationals MP told Seven’s Sunrise.\n\n“There is a difference in the relationship between him and the Trump administration.\n\n“I believe the first thing you have to do is give Kevin another job somewhere else – get an ambassador who actually can work closer with the United States.\n\n“You can’t have the Australian ambassador unable to make the connections at the highest level of the United States.”\n\nAsked if Mr Rudd alone was the weak link, Mr Joyce said he thought “we can do better for the United States”.\n\n“I’m not saying he’s a bad ambassador, but he’s not suited for the United States,” he said, adding it was “quite apparent” Mr Rudd was “just not hitting it off” with Mr Trump.\n\nOnly the UK has managed to receive an exemption from the Trump administration’s tariffs.\n\nBut analysts have questioned the merits of the deal, as London was forced to give US companies greater access to other parts of the British economy to lock it in.\n\nMr Rudd has the firm backing of Labor, with the Albanese government crediting him with much of the diplomatic legwork around AUKUS.\n\nRetired Liberal Party old guard have also continued to stand by the ambassador, including past political rivals.\n\nAppearing opposite Mr Joyce, Social Services Minister Tanya Plibersek came to Mr Rudd’s defence.\n\n“Kevin has had an extraordinarily active time as ambassador,” she said.\n\n“He’s got excellent relationships with both Republicans and Democrats.”\n\nMs Plibersek went on to praise Mr Rudd as “hardworking” and as having “enormous capacity”.\n\n“He’s an excellent ambassador, and at the end of the day, Australia chooses our ambassadors,” she said.\n\n“We don’t allow other countries to choose our ambassadors for us.”\n\nMr Trump over the weekend declared on social media that it was his “great honor to raise the tariffs on steel and aluminium from 25% to 50%, effective Wednesday, June 4th”.\n\n“Our steel and aluminium industries are coming back like never before,” he posted.\n\n“This will be yet another BIG jolt of great news for our wonderful steel and aluminium workers. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!”\n\nAustralian Trade Minister Don Farrell blasted the tariffs as “unjustified and not the act of a friend”.\n\n“They are an act of economic self-harm that will only hurt consumers and businesses who rely on free and fair trade,” he said in a statement on Saturday.\n\n“We will continue to engage and advocate strongly for the removal of the tariffs.”\n\nMr Farrell said last month a deal was before the Trump administration and the ball was in the US’ court.","summary":"A prominent Coalition MP has called for a switch of Australia’s most important envoy after Donald Trump’s latest tariff threat.","url":"https://thewest.com.au/news/fresh-call-for-new-us-envoy-after-latest-trump-tariff-threat-c-18891557","image":"https://images.thewest.com.au/publication/C-18891557/11e934e6fccce486c7dea53aca4f9978a1cd6bdc-16x9-x0y0w2048h1152.jpg?imwidth=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-06-01 22:29:50","author":"Joseph Olbrycht,Joseph Olbrycht-Palmer","authors":["Joseph Olbrycht","Joseph Olbrycht-Palmer"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"au","sentiment":-0.028},{"id":327129236,"title":"50 Cent Says He's Will Speak to Donald Trump About Diddy Pardon","text":"As you know ... 50 Cent's taken quite a few shots at Diddy since the super producer was arrested back in September -- clowning him a few times.

(EPA Images pic)SAN FRANCISCO: JPMorgan Chase chief executive Jamie Dimon voiced concern Sunday at the risk of a looming US debt market crisis sparked by the Trump administration’s economic policies.“It’s a big deal. It is a real problem,” Dimon told Maria Bartiromo on FOX Business Network’s “Mornings with Maria” show, according to an excerpt of the interview that will air in full Monday.“The bond market is going to have a tough time. I don’t know if it’s six months or six years,” he said.Dimon cautioned that once investors become aware of the impact of rising debt levels, interest rates would skyrocket and markets would be disrupted – a dangerous scenario for the world’s biggest economy.“People vote with their feet,” he stressed.Investors “are going to be looking at the country, the rule of law, the inflation rates, the central bank policies,” he said, warning that “if people decide that the US dollar isn’t the place to be,” financing US debt will become more expensive.Historically, the US has been able to rely on market appetite for low-interest US Treasury bonds to support its economy.Yields briefly climbed last week, amid concerns about President Donald Trump’s divisive budget plan.The plan would among other things extend the gigantic tax breaks introduced during Trump’s first term, spurring fears of a ballooning federal deficit.In mid-May, for the first time ever, the US lost its triple-A credit rating from Moody’s.When it announced the downgrade to Aa1, the ratings agency warned that it expects US federal deficits to widen dramatically over the next decade.The White House’s back-and-forth announcements of towering tariffs slapped on countries around the world are also creating considerable uncertainty and thus market volatility.Dimon already warned in April of “considerable turbulence” facing the American economy, pointing to the impact of tariffs, trade wars, inflation and budget deficits.US treasury secretary Scott Bessent on Sunday downplayed Dimon’s predictions of a debt market crisis.“I’ve known Jamie a long time, and for his entire career he’s made predictions like this,” Bessent said during an interview on CBS.“Fortunately, not all of them have come true.”Bessent acknowledged that he “was concerned about the level of debt.”But he said “the deficit this year is going to be lower than the deficit last year, and in two years, it will be lower again.”“We are going to bring the deficit down slowly,” Bessent added, insisting that addressing the deficit was a “long process.”“The goal is to bring it down over the next four years, (and to) leave the country in great shape in 2028.”","summary":"Jamie Dimon warns rising federal deficit could spark soaring interest rates and market turmoil once investors react.","url":"https://www.freemalaysiatoday.com/category/business/2025/06/02/us-debt-market-crisis-looming-jpmorgan-chief-warns/","image":"https://media.freemalaysiatoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/2dae19cc-jamie-dimon.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-06-01 22:23:10","author":"AFP","authors":["AFP"],"language":"en","category":"business","source_country":"my","sentiment":-0.185},{"id":327135984,"title":"Maya Jama looks sensational in a glamorous floral gown as she steps out in Mallorca ahead of new Love Island series","text":"Black Friday\n\nKim Kardashian\n\nVictoria Beckham\n\nHarry Styles\n\nAmanda Holden\n\nBritain's Got Talent\n\nPrivacy Policy\n\nSunday, Jun 1st 2025\n\n5-Day Forecast\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMultiple people injured in 'targeted terror attack' in Boulder, Colorado as suspect hurls Molotov cocktails at pro-Israel rally\n\nNato must brace to be attacked by Putin warns Germany's defence chief - as Zelensky celebrates 'brilliant, historic' drone strike that 'wiped out a third of Russia's strategic bombers in $7billion blitz'\n\nRevealed: The infamous Scottish gangsters shot dead by hooded gunman outside an Irish bar on the Costa Del Sol\n\n'I moved out of our bedroom into the box room.

Email tips@dailymail.com \nBy AMY LAMARE FOR DAILYMAIL.COM \n Published:23:10 BST, 1 June 2025 |Updated:23:17 BST, 1 June 2025 \n\nIt's been 20 years since The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants was released.\nThe friendships between its stars Carmen (America Ferrera), Lena (Alexis Bledel), Bridget (Blake Lively) and Tibby (Amber Tamblyn) are going strong two decades later. \nNow, the film's director Ken Kwapis, 67, is sharing his insights into Blake's first film at age 16.\n'It's hard to imagine anyone else other than Blake Lively as Bridget, even though it was her first acting job,' Kwapis reflected to People. \n'I mean, she was 16 when she came in to audition and yet she won it in the room. She had such a sort of intuitive connection to this character.' \nHe devised a way for the four young stars to bond quickly as they had to film scenes from the beginning and end of the movie right away and didn't have a lot of time to bond normally. \nFrom A-list scandals and red carpet mishaps to exclusive pictures and viral moments, subscribe to the DailyMail’s new Showbiz newsletter to stay in the loop. \n\nIt's been 20 years since The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants was released. Blake Lively, Alexis Bledel, Amber Tamblyn and America Ferrera seen here in 2005\n\n'The challenge was that the four actors had never met before this film, and the characters don't have a lot of scenes together. \n'Basically the four of them are in scenes at the beginning and the end. They bookend the film,' Kwapis noted.\n\n State of Taylor Swift and Blake Lively's friendship after subpoena was withdrawn \n'So the challenge for me in pre-production was how to take these four actors toward each other and turn them into lifelong friends quickly. \n'And so one of the things I tried to do is create certain exercises that would help the four of them bond. I mentioned this one in my book, that I sent the four actors off to a thrift store with, I don't know, $75 or $100 apiece with the instructions to buy something in character and to also advise the others in character as well.'\nThe License to Wed director said that the exercise was 'an interesting way to rehearse without actually rehearsing a scene.'\n'It was an exercise that gave them a chance to create a shorthand that they were able to use to, again, create that sense that these were friends from birth.'\nAnd it worked! The young women developed a bond and remain friends to this day.\n'It's so amazing and it's particularly rare in show business. I think that in show business people have intense relationships for a short time and then go their separate ways,' Kwapis said.\n\nThe friendships between its stars Carmen ( America Ferrera ), Lena (Alexis Bledel), Bridget ( Blake Lively ) and Tibby (Amber Tamblyn) are going strong two decades later. Blake seen here in 2004\n\nNow, the film's director Ken Kwapis, 67, is sharing his insights into Blake's first film at age 16\n\n'It's hard to imagine anyone else other than Blake Lively as Bridget, even though it was her first acting job,' Kwapis reflected to People\n\n'I mean, she was 16 when she came in to audition and yet she won it in the room. She had such a sort of intuitive connection to this character.' Ken Kwapis seen here in 2015\n'But in this case, these four actors came together, played four best friends and then have remained best friends. So actually, it's rare and wonderful,\" Kwapis says.\nThe seasoned director has also kept in touch with the ladies.\n'I'm definitely in touch with the others now and then and, again, I feel like it's been wonderful to become friends with all of them and I hope to work with them again,' he said.\nBlake's co-stars also came to her support in the ongoing legal battle with her It Ends With Us co-star and director Justin Baldoni. \nIn a joint Instagram post, Tamblyn and Ferrera released a statement signed by all three of them, including Bledel, who is not active on Instagram.\n'In support of our sister, Blake,' they wrote in the caption and signed off with a red heart emoji and their first names.\n'As Blake's friends and sisters for over twenty years, we stand with her in solidarity as she fights back against the reported campaign waged to destroy her reputation,' the trio's statement read.\n'Throughout the filming of It Ends With Us, we saw her summon the courage to ask for a safe workplace for herself and colleagues on set,' they stated.\n\nHe devised a way for the four young stars to bond quickly as they had to film scenes from the beginning and end of the movie right away and didn't have a lot of time to bond normally. Blake seen here in 2005\n\n'The challenge was that the four actors had never met before this film, and the characters don't have a lot of scenes together. The four of them are in scenes at the beginning and the end. They bookend the film,' Kwapis noted. Blake seen here in 2025\n\n'And we are appalled to read the evidence of a premeditated and vindictive effort that ensued to discredit her voice,' they continued.\nThe three actresses also condemned Baldoni's alleged attempt to 'bury' Lively — as he and his team reportedly stated in a private message that was made public in the court documents — under the guise of having good intentions and trying to shed light on domestic violence, the pivotal message of It Ends With Us.\n'Most upsetting is the unabashed exploitation of domestic violence survivors' stories to silence a woman who asked for safety,' Lively's Sisterhood costars wrote. 'The hypocrisy is astounding.'\n'We are struck by the reality that even if a woman is as strong, celebrated, and resourced as our friend Blake, she can face forceful retaliation for daring to ask for a safe working environment. We are inspired by our sister's courage to stand up her herself and others,' the statement continued.\n'For anyone seeking more information or engaging in this important conversation online, please read the full legal complaint in the investigative reporting by Megan Twohey, Mike McIntire, and Julie Tate for the New York Times.\nFerrera, Tamblyn and Bledel tagged Lively in their post.\nAdditionally, Ferrera and Tamblyn shared the post on their Instagram Stories alongside the link to the New York Times article about the lawsuit Lively filed on Friday.\n'I was a confidant for my sister Blake while she went through some of this experience,' Tamblyn wrote alongside her Instagram Stories post.\nJustin BaldoniBlake Lively\n\nShare or comment on this article: \nBlake Lively's former director details her behavior during first acting job amid Justin Baldoni legal war\n\nAdd comment\n\n Share what you think\n\nWorst rated\n\nThe comments below have not been moderated.\n\nThe views expressed in the contents above are those of our users and do not necessarily reflect the views of MailOnline.\n\nAdd your comment\n\nEnter your comment\n\nBy posting your comment you agree to our house rules.\n\nSubmit Comment\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual.\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual\n\nWe will automatically post your comment and a link to the news story to your Facebook timeline at the same time it is posted on MailOnline.

The attack targeted a Boulder Run for Their Lives event, which is a weekly meeting of Jewish community members to run or walk in support of the hostages kidnapped on October 7, the Anti-Defamation League said. Purported footage from the scene shows the alleged assailant, whose identity has still to be confirmed by law enforcement, shouting, \"This will end when Palestine is free for us all,\" and screaming to \"end Zionists\" while shirtless, holding the components of makeshift firebombs. The alleged attack comes less than two weeks after a deadly shooting in Washington, D.C., when two Israeli embassy staffers were killed in what senior U.S. officials deemed a targeted act of antisemitic violence. Local police were still confirming how many people were wounded, but the local police chief said there were \"multiple\" victims, suffering from wounds ranging from minor to life-threatening ones. In a press briefing, police chief Steven Redfearn said emergency calls indicated people were being set on fire, and emergency responders encountered multiple victims consistent with burns and other injuries. Local news footage also showed multiple people being treated for burn wounds. A suspect at the scene was taken into custody without incident, though police have not identified him yet. The suspect was hospitalized with minor injuries, the police chief said. Boulder police told the public to stay away from the scene on a post on X, and are requesting all aircraft to avoid flying over the scene of the incident, saying \"helicopters circling the scene are making it impossible for our drones to investigate.\" U.S. President Donald Trump has been briefed on the incident, according to a White House official. U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio said the country was \"united in prayer\" for the victims. \"Terror has no place in our great country,\" he said. Multiple government organizations said they were monitoring and investigating the attack, including the FBI, Department of Homeland Security and National Counterterrorism Center. FBI Director Kash Patel said it was a \"targeted\" terror attack. FBI Deputy Director Dan Bongino said the incident was being investigated as \"an act of ideologically motivated violence based on the early information, the evidence and witness accounts.\" Colorado Gov. Jared Polis, who is Jewish, said, described the event as a \"vicious act\" of terrorism. \"My thoughts go out to the people who have been injured and impacted by this heinous act of terror,\" he said. \"Hate-filled acts of any kind are unacceptable.\" \"As the American Jewish community continues to reel from the horrific antisemitic murders in Washington, D.C., it is unfathomable that the Jewish community is facing another terror attack here in Boulder, on the eve of the holiday of Shavuot, no less,\" the governor said. \"Several individuals were brutally attacked while peacefully marching to draw attention to the plight of the hostages who have been held by Hamas terrorists in Gaza for 604 days,\" he said. \"I condemn this vicious act of terrorism, and pray for the recovery of the victims.\" Redfearn would not confirm whether Jews or the pro-Israel community were specifically targeted. \"We understand there's a lot of tensions in the U.S.,\" he said. \"Once we have a clear motive, we'll act accordingly. If that was motive was a group was targeted, we'll step up and ensure that additional security and presence.\" Boulder's Jewish Community Center said details were unclear, but they \"are saddened and heartbroken to learn that an incendiary device was thrown at walkers at the Run for Their Lives walk on Pearl Street as they were raising awareness for the hostages still held in Gaza.\" \"Our hearts go out to those who witnessed this horrible attack, and prayers for a speedy recovery to those who were injured,\" the statement read. Colorado Democratic Rep. Jason Crow said he was \"closely monitoring reports of a terror attack at Pearl Street Mall in Boulder.\" \"My thoughts are with everyone impacted by this senseless act of violence,\" he said. \"Hate-fueled violence has no place in Colorado.\" House Speaker Mike Johnson said, \"This violent, antisemitic attack is heartbreaking and deeply disturbing. We pray for the victims and for law enforcement to deliver swift justice.\" \"Terrorist sympathizers have made it clear they will do anything to try and silence the Jewish people and those who support Israel,\" he said on X. The Israeli ambassador to the UN, Danny Danon, said the \"terrorism against Jews does not stop at the Gaza border – it is already burning the streets of America.\" He called for \"concrete action to be taken against the instigators.\"","summary":"Witnesses said a man reportedly threw firebombs into a crowd at a Run for Their Lives event, dedicated to hostages held in Gaza.

This relationship -- specifically with China -- may be coming to an end if President Donald Trump gets his way. The maker of the iPhone used the large and cheap labor market of China and other Asian nations to cheaply build and assemble its hardware before selling to consumers around the world, making a tidy profit in the process.\n\nNow, with large tariffs implemented on imports from China, Apple has begun to move some of its manufacturing to India in order to hedge its bets. However, this caught the ire of Trump, who said that Apple will face a 25% tariff on iPhone imports and that the products should be made in the United States in order to reshore manufacturing.\n\nAccording to analysts, building iPhones in the United States will greatly raise Apple's operating costs. Does that give investors a reason to sell the stock?\n\nStuck between China and the United States\n\nDue to higher labor costs, assembling iPhones in the United States would increase Apple's variable costs for its hardware products. Analysts estimate it would cost Apple tens of billions of dollars to switch manufacturing to the United States while raising the per-unit price from $40 to $200 or higher. It is possible that Apple could make up these costs by raising the retail price on iPhones, but that is asking a lot from consumers when flagship devices already cost around $1,000.\n\nLast quarter, Apple's product division generated just under $25 billion in gross profit, which is revenue minus manufacturing/assembly costs. If Apple is forced to pay high tariffs or manufacture its phones in the United States, these large gross profits may disappear, leading to less bottom-line income and free cash flow. On top of the higher costs in the United States, Apple's supply chain wouldn't be immune from tariffs, with parts of the iPhone imported from Asia and still subjected to high tariffs as of this writing.\n\nIn actuality, around half of Apple's gross profit comes from its high-margin services segment, which will not be directly impacted by tariffs. This includes revenue from the App Store and distribution agreements from Google to be the default search engine on the Safari web browser. In fiscal year 2024, $71 billion of Apple's total gross profit of $181 billion came from services.\n\nThese high-margin revenue streams are under attack from antitrust lawsuits. Apple is now forced to allow mobile applications to use alternative payment methods to sidestep its 30% fee on payment processing, which could lead some profits to disappear. Current lawsuits may bar Apple from accepting a huge $20 billion (or more) annual payment from Google for default search engine status, another potential profit hit coming down the line. \n\nSlowing revenue growth, falling behind in AI?\n\nEven before these threats from tariffs and antitrust lawsuits, Apple was not firing on all cylinders compared to the other \"Magnificent Seven\" stocks. Over the last three years, Apple has only grown its revenue by a cumulative 3%. Alphabet's is up 29%, Microsoft's is up 36%, and Nvidia's is up a staggering 339% over that same time frame. The company is simply not growing much anymore as it fails to deliver any new hardware device that comes close to the popularity of the iPhone.\n\nIn artificial intelligence (AI), Apple may be falling well behind the competition. It has failed to release updated services for Siri while letting competitors like Alphabet post cutting-edge breakthroughs in text, video, and image generation for consumers. This is not showing up in the numbers today, but Apple is at major risk of failing to win in the next great technology paradigm, which will impact its bottom line eventually despite its wide brand moat today.\n\nAAPL Revenue (TTM) data by YCharts\n\nIs now the time to sell Apple stock?\n\nApple stock is down 17.8% this year. I believe the stock still looks overvalued for investors today. It trades at a price-to-earnings ratio (P/E) of 31, which is higher than the S&P 500 average and higher than Alphabet even though Alphabet is growing much faster.\n\nLow-growth stocks trading at a premium earnings multiple are dangerous to own, even if they have been strong performers in the past. Apple may see its earnings finally move in the wrong direction if tariffs, lawsuits, and failures to win in AI lead to deteriorating power in the global technology landscape. It wouldn't shock me if Apple's profits were lower in five years compared to today.\n\nFor these reasons, Apple stock is an easy sell from your portfolio right now.","url":"https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/06/01/apple-stock-did-president-trump-just-give-investor/","image":"https://g.foolcdn.com/image/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fg.foolcdn.com%2Feditorial%2Fimages%2F819868%2Fsocial-media.jpg&amp;op=resize&amp;w=1200&amp;h=630","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-06-01 22:15:00","author":"Brett Schafer","authors":["Brett Schafer"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.586},{"id":327126338,"title":"Trump ‘Not Given Heads-Up’ of Ukraine’s Far-Reaching Drone Strikes In Russia, Officials Say","text":"US President Donald Trump was not given a heads-up about the surprise attack on a number of Russian airfields by Ukrainian intelligence services, which reportedly destroyed more than 40 planes well within Russian territory, two senior administration officials told reporters on Sunday.\n\n“This was purely a Ukrainian operation; the US has nothing to do with it,” one official told Kyiv Post.\n\nTrump spent Sunday morning golfing at his property in Sterling, Virginia.\n\nSecretary of State Marco Rubio spoke on Sunday with Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov, at Russia’s request.\n\n“Secretary Rubio reiterated President Trump’s call for continued direct talks between Russia and Ukraine to achieve a lasting peace,” spokesperson Tammy Bruce said in a readout of the call.\n\nUkraine’s security services confirmed on Sunday that they had launched a massive drone attack against five air bases inside Russia, reaching Siberia for the first time.Kyiv said that the operation, code-named “Spiderweb,” was prepared for over a year and a half “under the personal supervision” of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.“An absolutely brilliant result.\n\nA result achieved solely by Ukraine,” Zelensky himself noted in a post on X. “Our people involved in preparing the operation were withdrawn from Russian territory in time,” he added.\n\nThe Sunday strikes came just a week after Trump lambasted Russia’s autocrat Vladimir Putin following days-long mass air attacks on Kyiv. However, the US President later appeared to set another two-week deadline for the Kremlin, threatening a different response if the Russian counterpart was still stringing him along.\n\nAs Kyiv Post reported last week citing two senior officials, Trump has been “seriously considering” lifting all Biden-era restrictions on Ukraine’s war effort, as he believes that the current status quo “does not serve our common interests of bringing Russia to the [negotiation] table,” as one official put it.\n\nSeveral leading pro-Ukraine Republicans on Sunday hailed Ukraine’s latest operation. Congressman Don Bacon reacted to the news by quoting a biblical passage noting that “Putin has sown the wind and is now reaping the whirlwind.”\n\n“The Russians were using their strategic bombers to fire cruise missiles and other weapons into Ukrainian cities. The bombers were very legitimate targets,” Bacon noted on social media.\n\n“Russia bombs cities. Ukraine bombs military targets,” he concluded.\n\nLeading Senator Lindsay Graham, who was in Kyiv last Friday, said in a social media post that the “ever-resourceful Ukraine used creative drone warfare tactics to successfully attack Russian bombers and military assets used to kill Ukrainian citizens and destroy their country.”\n\n“Russia indiscriminately kills men, women and children. It’s time for the world to act decisively against Russia’s aggression by holding China and others accountable for buying cheap Russian oil that props up Putin’s war machine,” Graham noted.\n\n“If you want this war to end, push China to help end it,” he concluded.\n\nThe US Senate is set to move ahead this week with Senator Graham’s bipartisan bill imposing more sanctions on Russia over its three-year-old war in Ukraine.","summary":"‘This was purely a Ukrainian operation and the US has nothing to do with it,’ one official told Kyiv Post.

Subscribe to our YouTube channel to see more of his videos.\n\nHello, this is Victor Davis Hanson for The Daily Signal. So much has been said about the media, the mainstream media, the legacy media. There’s not really much to add because we all know that it’s not really a disinterested media but it’s kind of a Pravda-like propaganda organ. I’ll give you a few examples.\n\nMore recently, when Cyril Ramaphosa came to the White House, the president of South Africa, did you see the word “ambush”? It was in every mainstream paper, every left-wing website, every radio—NPR, PBS, CBS, MSNBC. It’s like the Democratic operatives issue a Pravda-like order and then these mindless people just say, “Okay, today’s talking points are…” \n\nHe met President Donald Trump. He wasn’t really surprised that Trump was going to confront him because he bragged that he was gonna confront Trump. There was no secret place. It wasn’t a sudden, unexpected attack from a secret place—the definition of an ambush. Yet, it was ”ambush,” “ambush,” “ambush,” “ambush.”\n\nAnd when some questions arose about the visit, it was just typical. The White House press secretary, Karoline Leavitt, fielded a question from an NBC journalist. She was very angry because Donald Trump mentioned to President Ramaphosa, “See this picture of a thousand graves.” She said, “Well, he was lying. There weren’t graves.” And the press secretary replied back, “They were commemorations.” Each one of those crosses represents a dead South African who was murdered by virtue of his race. And she said, “Yes, but it’s not…”\n\nSo what they were arguing about—NBC—was semantics that Trump had improperly—and he had improperly—confused “grave” with “cenotaph,” a cenotaph. That’s “kenos” in Greek, meaning “empty.”\n\nSo, these crosses were not on top of a dead person but they represented a dead person. But NBC was so fixated on embarrassing the president that they didn’t even want to discuss the fact that there were a thousand crosses and they did represent individual lives destroyed because of their race. But she just wanted to make the point that you could nullify all of that and excuse it by saying they were not graves but cenotaphs. And there you have it.\n\nSo lately, we see it everywhere. And we had the tragic killing of Yaron Lischinsky and his fiancee, Sarah Milgrim, the two Jewish diplomatic workers in Washington. And what was interesting about it—I’ve been reading the mainstream media accounts. So, Elias Rodriguez goes in there, shoots—empties a gun—21 times, murders this wonderful couple, and then he yells, “Free Palestine.”\n\nAnd they just can’t resist. They have the description of the shooting. They mention who he was. They don’t mention the left-wing groups that he worked with or the funding that came from places like the MacArthur Foundation that funded groups that he used to work for. Or they don’t mention the fact that his father attended Congress as a guest of a Democratic congressman.\n\nBut they do do this: About eight, usually about eight paragraphs down, they say, “And tensions rose because of the Israeli assault on Gaza and the thousands of deaths.” In other words, they’re trying to contextualize the murder by saying that this person was driven to it in the manner, perhaps, like Luigi Mangione, who shot the UnitedHealthcare executive. In other words, there’s always a contextualization.\n\nAnd when you start to add all of this stuff up, it all is in an atmosphere of Jake Tapper co-authoring this “Original Sin” book when he was one of the principle people who promulgated the idea that former President Joe Biden was completely fit and anybody who questioned it—Lara Trump was a good example—he demonized and tried to destroy on national TV. Now he’s gonna make millions saying, “I didn’t do it. They did.” \n\nAnd it’s an indictment of the Biden circle, who knew that he was cognitively challenged. We knew it. I shouldn’t even say they knew. Everybody knew it. But they were prevented from commenting or they were demonized if they did comment by the media and by the Biden team.\n\nAnd this is on top of the fact that the media never even looked at the released records. They never even asked a question—as they did of Donald Trump’s cognitive abilities. They never said, “Did he have a PSA test?” Trump, it’s on his medical records. Former President Barack Obama did. They didn’t ask any of these things.\n\nAnd now they’re trying to say, “We were hoodwinked.” No, you weren’t hoodwinked. You were operating in the same fashion you did to promulgate the Russian collusion lie that you never apologized for, the laptop disinformation lie that you’ve never apologized for, the 51 intelligence authorities that you never apologized for, the partnering of the FBI with social media to censor the news before the 2020 election that you never talked about.\n\nThis is a pattern. And it won’t stop with this. And the result is you wonder why, whether when you look at liberal polls or liberal media, nobody has any confidence anymore, nobody trusts you. \n\nDon’t you understand that when you say, “Ambush,” “ambush,” “ambush,” “ambush,” or you ask questions that don’t even get to the point, just a matter of semantics, we know what you’re doing? You’re trying to gin up momentum, enthusiasm for a cause, a left-wing cause that 50% of the population just doesn’t support.\n\nWe publish a variety of perspectives.

Why These Unstoppable Stocks Are Better Buys","text":"There's no denying it. Amazon (AMZN -0.31%) has been one of the market's most rewarding stocks for nearly the past three decades, rallying more than 270,000% since its 1997 initial public offering. This thrilling performance is a big reason so many investors are betting on the company now -- they're hoping for more of the same magic. And maybe they'll get it.\n\nAs the old cliché reminds investors, though, nothing lasts forever. Yesterday's winners aren't necessarily tomorrow's.\n\nWith that as the backdrop, here's a closer look at three unstoppable names other than Amazon that you might want to consider adding to your portfolio.\n\nIt's not exactly a coincidence that one of the stocks worth considering besides Amazon is the un-Amazon, or anti-Amazon. That's Shopify (SHOP -0.31%).\n\nSimply put, Shopify helps brands establish and manage their own e-commerce presence.\n\nWhen the worldwide web was still relatively young and online shopping was still new, companies were content to use Amazon's high-traffic website as a sales platform. Things changed, though. As time marched on and its business matured, Amazon.com became crowded and competitive (including with Amazon itself). Sellers eventually figured out they'd be better served by their own online store. That's what Shopify facilitates.\n\nAnd it's doing more and more of it. Although the company doesn't disclose its customer count any longer, somewhere on the order of 5 million stores sold a confirmed $292.3 billion worth of goods and services last year, translating to $8.9 billion worth of revenue and $1.1 billion in net income for Shopify itself. Those figures are up 24%, 26%, and a swing from a loss of $1.4 billion (respectively) year over year, extending a long-standing growth streak. Analysts expect a similar growth rate for at least the next several years, too.\n\nThere's actually an even longer growth runway ahead of Shopify, however.\n\nSee, for as big as the e-commerce industry has become, the U.S. Census Bureau reports that only about 16% of domestic retail spending is done online. The rest is still done in-store. While there's some consumer spending that will only ever be made in person, that's a lot of potential business to win. The shift away from third-party platforms to home-grown e-commerce stores only bolsters Shopify's potential upside.\n\n2. Rocket Lab\n\nThe world's been sending satellites into orbit since the late 1950s, and even putting people on the moon as of the 1960s. Space flight has become so commonplace, in fact, that many people no longer think much of it.\n\nThe next era of rocketry is likely to rekindle this lost excitement, though, not so much because it will look different, but because it will happen so much more often and will serve so much more purpose. It will also be more cost-effective, largely because the development of the newer rocketry technology has been privatized.\n\nRocket Lab USA (RKLB -1.75%) is one of these for-profit rocket companies.\n\nAs of the latest count, Rocket Lab made 64 successful launches of its reusable Electron rocket, deploying a total of 225 fairly small satellites. This proven solution is going to remain in demand indefinitely, as small orbital satellites become more and more important to telecommunications service providers. Indeed, there are more than 40 satellites in Rocket Lab's current launch backlog.\n\nBut the company isn't stopping there. It's thinking bigger. Literally. Its Neutron rocket is a medium-lift launch vehicle capable of putting up to 1,500 kilograms worth of payload en route to Mars or Venus, making it at least a partial competitor to SpaceX's Falcon. Using Rocket Lab's rocket to get equipment and personnel headed to the moon, of course, will be easy by comparison.\n\nRocket Lab USA isn't profitable yet, and probably won't be at any point in the immediate future.\n\nBe patient, though. Goldman Sachs expects the global satellite market to grow sevenfold between now and 2035, jibing with Global Market Insights' forecast for average annualized growth of 14.6% through 2034 for worldwide commercial space launch business.\n\nFinally, add used car dealer chain Carvana (CVNA 2.45%) to your list of unstoppable stocks that have become better bets than Amazon.\n\nYou know the company. Although it's not the first or only chain of used car dealerships, it certainly seems like the biggest and best known. And by some measures it is. For the record, however, Carvana itself estimates it only controls about 1% of the United States' highly fragmented used car business.\n\nThat's not an indictment of its marketability, though. That tiny number mostly underscores the potential growth awaiting an enterprising outfit with the wherewithal to consolidate some of this industry with clever marketing and the smart use of technology.\n\nThat's Carvana, of course -- not that the company needs any serious help in the growth department.\n\nYes, higher import tariffs on new cars and automobile parts ultimately works in favor of the used car market. Carvana doesn't exactly need the newly raised tariffs to remain in place to thrive, however. Raw inflation was doing plenty to help this company prior to President Donald Trump taking office. The company's 2024 top line of $13.7 billion was up 27% from 2023's lull, bouncing back from the swoon following its post-pandemic sales surge.\n\nAnalysts are calling for similar growth at least through 2027. And, with Standard & Poor's Global Mobility reporting the age of the average car on U.S. roads now at 12.8 years, the outlook makes sense -- a swell of car owners are soon going to be forced into making these purchases, before repairs and maintenance of their current cars become costlier than they're worth.\n\nIt's arguably the riskiest of the three stocks in question here just because its big run-up from March's low has pushed it beyond analysts' consensus target of just over $300. It wouldn't be crazy to wait for at least a small pullback.\n\nJust don't get stingy. The bigger-picture backstory here is a firmly bullish one.","summary":"As Wayne Gretzky put it, \"Skate to where the puck is going, not where it has been.\"","url":"https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/06/01/should-you-forget-amazon-why-these-unstoppable-sto/","image":"https://g.foolcdn.com/image/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fg.foolcdn.com%2Feditorial%2Fimages%2F820161%2Frocket-launch.jpg&amp;op=resize&amp;w=1200&amp;h=630","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-06-01 22:05:00","author":"James Brumley","authors":["James Brumley"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.136},{"id":327127354,"title":"US says trade row with China could ease after Trump-Xi talks","text":"US President Donald Trump participates in a welcoming ceremony with China’s President Xi Jinping during his 2017 visit to Beijing. (Reuters pic)WASHINGTON: A logjam in the trade talks between the US and China could be broken once Presidents Donald Trump and Xi Jinping speak, US officials said Sunday – a conversation they said could happen soon.Trump on Friday accused Beijing of violating a deal reached last month in Geneva to temporarily lower staggeringly high tariffs the world’s two biggest economies had imposed on each other, in a pause to last 90 days.China’s slow-walking on export licence approvals for rare earths and other elements needed to make cars and chips have fuelled US frustration, The Wall Street Journal reported Friday – a concern since confirmed by US officials.But US treasury secretary Scott Bessent seemed to take the pressure down a notch on Sunday, telling CBS’s “Face the Nation” that the gaps could soon be bridged.“I’m confident that when President Trump and Party Chairman Xi have a call that this will be ironed out,” Bessent said, however noting that China was “withholding some of the products that they agreed to release during our agreement.”When asked if rare earths were one of those products, Bessent said, “Yes.”“Maybe it’s a glitch in the Chinese system. Maybe it’s intentional. We’ll see after the president speaks with” Xi, he said.On when a Trump-Xi call could take place, Bessent said: “I believe we will see something very soon.”Kevin Hassett, director of the White House’s National Economic Council told ABC that the call could happen “this week” but that he had no confirmation of a scheduled time.Since Trump returned to the presidency, he has slapped sweeping tariffs on most US trading partners, with especially high rates on Chinese imports.New tit-for-tat levies on both sides reached three digits before the de-escalation this month, where Washington agreed to temporarily reduce additional tariffs on Chinese imports from 145% to 30%.China, meanwhile, lowered its added duties from 125% to 10%.Commerce secretary Howard Lutnick told “Fox News Sunday” that China was “slow-rolling the deal,” adding: “We are taking certain actions to show them what it feels like on the other side of that equation.”“Our president understands what to do. He’s going to go work it out,” Lutnick said.Lutnick also said that a US court battle over Trump’s tariff strategy – one court’s ruling to block the tariffs has been stayed pending an appeal – would ultimately end with a win for the president.“Tariffs are not going away,” Lutnick said.‘We’ve got to be ready’Separate from the China deal, Trump said Friday he would double sector-specific tariffs on steel and aluminum to 50% starting June 4 – sparking ire from the European Union, which said it would retaliate.Hassett said China’s dumping of low-cost steel was hurting US industry – which in turn was hindering US military preparedness.“The bottom line is that we’ve got to be ready in case things don’t happen the way we want, because if we have cannons but not cannonballs, then we can’t fight a war,” Hassett told “This Week.”“And if we don’t have steel, then the US isn’t ready, and we’re not preparing ourselves for something,” he added.“We have to have a steel industry that’s ready for American defence.”","summary":"Treasury secretary Scott Bessent expects a conversation soon between the leaders of the world’s two largest economies.","url":"https://www.freemalaysiatoday.com/category/highlight/2025/06/02/us-says-trade-row-with-china-could-ease-after-trump-xi-talks/","image":"https://media.freemalaysiatoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/cfac5a20-donald-trump-xi-jinping.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-06-01 22:04:42","author":"AFP","authors":["AFP"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"my","sentiment":-0.219},{"id":327125580,"title":"Ukraine, Russia Set For Istanbul Talks Even As Deadly Air Strikes Intensify Back Home","text":"Delegations from Ukraine and Russia are scheduled to meet on June 2 in Istanbul for the next round of peace talks, even as air assaults are ramped up in the military struggle back at home.\n\nRussian state media reported that the Kremlin’s negotiating team had arrived at Istanbul's Ataturk Airport late on June 1 in anticipation of talks to begin at 1 p.m. the next day in the Turkish city.\n\nMeanwhile, in a presidential decree, Kyiv said that Defense Minister Rustem Umerov will head Ukraine’s delegation, backed by at least a dozen other officials.

Zhang is an expert on technology regulation and antitrust in China, and her research focus has recently been on artificial intelligence oversight. This interview first appeared in SCMP Plus. For other interviews in the Open Questions series, click here.\nHow will the new US-China tariff war affect the Chinese technology sector and competition between the two countries on artificial intelligence?\nTariffs can affect the Chinese tech sector in two main ways.\nFirst, there are the direct effects. Higher tariffs make it harder for Chinese tech products to compete in the US market. If the tariffs stay relatively modest – like the levels we saw before “Liberation Day” – Chinese suppliers might absorb some of the extra costs. Prices would go up a bit, but their products might still be competitive. But if the tariffs go up dramatically – say, to the 145 per cent that President [Donald] Trump proposed before China and the US reached an agreement in Geneva – then Chinese products would probably lose their price advantage and be effectively shut out of the US market.\nSecond, there are indirect effects. As Chinese companies face more trade barriers from the US, they’ll need to work even harder on cutting costs and scaling up. A good example is what we saw in response to the chip embargo – many Chinese tech firms started open-sourcing their AI models. That’s a more cost-effective and collaborative way to keep developing advanced technologies when resources are tight. I expect we’ll see similar strategies in other areas like electric vehicles, batteries and renewable energy. These firms are going to keep pushing hard to make their products even more competitive.\nAt the same time, they’re not going to sit still. I think we’ll see Chinese companies look more aggressively to other markets – Asia, Latin America, Africa. And we’ll likely see more efforts to deepen trade with Europe, including offering technology transfers in exchange for market access.\nOf course, there’s a lot of uncertainty ahead. But one thing is clear: Chinese firms are going to face serious challenges in the coming years under the Trump administration.\n\nChina has been in a frenzy over DeepSeek in the past few months. How do you assess its significance, and does it mean the AI gap with the US is narrowing?\nI think the most important thing about DeepSeek is not necessarily the technology breakthrough. It’s more the realisation that we don’t necessarily need to rely on a huge amount of computing resources to train AI models. The emergence of DeepSeek has challenged the traditional notion of the law of scale that Silicon Valley companies have supported or pursued. It has also challenged the dominant positions of the leading AI companies, such as OpenAI.\nThe AI industry is going to change significantly because there will be less effort spent on training advanced AI models because people can just rely on open-source AI models like DeepSeek.\nInstead, more effort will be spent on AI applications and other AI tools.\nThe use of computing power and resources has also changed quite dramatically. Most of the computing power used to be spent on training AI models, and now that those resources are being shifted to inferencing, they could be less reliant on Nvidia’s GPUs and not necessarily rely on very high-end computing resources.\nIn that respect, it could also benefit Chinese hardware companies like Huawei, because DeepSeek now uses a lot of Huawei chips for inferencing. This could also help other domestic Chinese hardware companies.\n\nDoes it indicate that US technology export restrictions on China have failed?\nI have always thought that the US restrictions on technology exports would fail.\nFor export restrictions to succeed, you have to assume very good enforcement. You also have to assume that people don’t find ways around them. And neither of these assumptions holds in reality.\nFirst, there will never be perfect execution of export restrictions, there will always be loopholes, and the US Commerce Department has also complained that it doesn’t have enough personnel to enforce many of the restrictions.\nThat’s why there have been reports of how people can get even cheaper Nvidia GPUs in China than in the US, which goes to the second point I was talking about, because the longer these export controls are in place, the more likely it is that people will find ways around them.\nDeepSeek is a perfect example of that because US export control creates this scarcity of demand for Chinese companies to access GPUs. So Chinese AI firms have to find a more efficient way to train the AI models. And that incentivises them to be even more innovative.\nMany people in Washington DC might disagree with me. They argue that the emergence of DeepSeek just shows that export controls work, because Liang Wenfeng, the founder of DeepSeek, said that export controls are one of the biggest obstacles they face.\nNo one denies that US export controls have made life very difficult for Chinese AI firms. But they seem to be completely overlooking the unintended consequences here, because first of all, the US chip embargo creates new demand for Chinese hardware companies to fill the void left by US exporters.\nAnd secondly, you make Chinese companies more creative. People in the United States have been puzzled why OpenAI doesn’t come up with these creative ways to train the AI models. Because they don’t have those kinds of restrictions.\nDespite what I’ve said, my prediction is that the US government, and based on what we’ve seen with the recent actions from the Trump administration, will most likely continue to double down on export restrictions.\nAnd towards the end of the [Joe] Biden administration, they even put in place an AI diffusion framework that divides countries into different tiers. And not just making it harder for China to get access to advanced chips, it also makes it difficult for many other countries in tier two – like UAE, Singapore, Malaysia – to access chips to build data centres.\nThis kind of restriction will further accelerate China’s progress in hardware development because now you are not just restricting China but other countries as well, which creates further demand for Chinese chips.\nAnd let’s also keep in mind that nowadays, because of the arrival of DeepSeek, the demand for GPUs has now shifted from training to inference work, which doesn’t necessarily require very high-end Nvidia chips.\nI think if the Trump administration continues to push a similar framework like the AI diffusion framework … it will be a kind of strategic gift for the Chinese hardware companies like Huawei.\n\nWe’ve been talking about the AI race between the US and China for a while. What are their respective advantages and weaknesses in AI? And is it still possible for other players to catch up?\nThere are a number of countries that are quite good, like several European countries such as the UK and France. And even the UAE has been able to produce quite advanced AI models. But right now I think the US and China will continue to lead in AI.\nI think they will continue to do so for the foreseeable future because both countries already have very strong momentum and very top and competitive firms with plenty of resources and talent.\nSo it’s a bit harder for other countries to catch up. Now, one of the specific advantages of the US is its ability to innovate, especially scientific breakthroughs from 0 to 1.\nChina is very good at product diffusion, and its execution strength has been clearly demonstrated in recent months with the success of DeepSeek and many other leading AI companies, which are able to offer comparable AI products at a tiny fraction of the cost of their US rivals.\nI think these two countries complement each other in terms of their strengths. If they can cooperate and work together, it would be a perfect team.\nChinese AI models, including DeepSeek, tend to use an open-source approach, while American ones are more proprietary. What are the advantages and disadvantages of these approaches? Is open-source sustainable in the long term?\nOpen-source AI models have been one of the ways for companies to catch up with the frontier AI models. That’s why Meta is becoming a kind of maverick player in the US. Because everyone else is closed-source.\nAnd I think the US companies are closed-source on the AI models for a number of reasons. One is national security concerns. They don’t want the most advanced AI models to fall into the hands of adversary countries, including China.\nThe other one is about competition. They have spent billions of dollars training the AI model and they don’t seem to be getting much in return if they open-source it. Now the question is whether it would be sustainable for Chinese AI companies to continue the open-source AI models.\nThe next step will depend on how Chinese AI companies start to monetise their open-source AI models. Right now, if you want to access DeepSeek’s API [application programming interface], they charge you a fee. The model itself is free, and you can even download it yourself, but to deploy it, you need to have access.\nI think the open-source model then becomes a way for these AI companies to combine it with other features and other services that they can charge consumers for in order for the business to be sustainable.\nSo the next step is for Chinese companies to find a sustainable way to commercialise these AI products.\nWhere does regulation stand in the AI race? How does China’s approach differ from that of the US and the EU?\nAI regulation is a very broad topic because AI products touch on many different areas of law.\nThe development, the deployment, the use, the consumption of AI products involves many areas of law. If you think about intellectual property law, there’s a lot of controversy about intellectual property infringement. And think about tort law – who should be held liable for AI product liabilities? There’s also issues about defamation – who should be liable for this AI content? There’s also issues about data privacy in terms of the use of personal data in training AI models.\nGenerative AI is posing new challenges to many of these existing laws, particularly intellectual property, which is exactly why there’s so much litigation in the US, because the content creators, don’t think that the use of their copyrighted material should be considered fair use under US copyright law.\nBut I think the biggest problem we’re facing right now with AI regulation is how to regulate the safety of AI, and particularly the risk of frontier AI models, because that’s something that we don’t have a lot of existing laws on. That’s why other places – for example, the European Union has tried to address these issues in the EU AI Act.\nThe Biden administration issued an executive order in October 2023 which also tries to impose some oversight and transparency requirements on frontier AI models. And China has introduced interim measures for the management of generative AI services in 2023.\nThose interim measures are also very broad and touch almost everything. It doesn’t specifically address how to regulate the risk of frontier AI, although it does put a pretty strong emphasis on the content moderation obligations for AI model developers and especially those that provide services to the public.\nIn practice, those companies that offer services to the public need to get approval from Chinese regulators by submitting an application to the Cyberspace Administration of China. But the CAC’s main focus remains on content moderation.\nSo China does not seem to have taken strong and comprehensive measures to regulate frontier AI risks. However, China’s AI capabilities are developing rapidly. And AI is a technology that has such wide applications. I’m just concerned that if we don’t take proper preventive efforts to regulate this technology, there could be problems down the road – like AI misuse, AI incidents, or even disasters.\nHas regulation failed to keep up with the pace of AI development?\nThere’s always a pacing problem, in that the law often fails to keep up with the technology development.\nThere are two schools of thought when it comes to regulation and the first one is that a lot of people, particularly those in the industry, believe that we shouldn’t rush to regulate this technology because it’s developing so fast and it’s so nascent at the moment. They think that too much regulation will harm its further development, particularly people from China.\nAnd so there are many reasons why the industry has a strong preference for relaxing regulation. But other people will say, you know, if we don’t do enough, then by the time we intervene it will be too late. I have sympathy for both sides.\nAnd particularly, when we’re talking about frontier AI risk, it’s really hard to regulate because – for the most part – we don’t really know how AI works. So how we can effectively regulate AI is a very big puzzle.\nBut nevertheless, I think countries like China and the US, who are the pioneers in this field, should at least make some effort to think about how to regulate it. Proactive thinking about how to design and improve AI regulation is like buying insurance.\nEven if there is a very small chance that AI might get out of control, if the consequences are serious enough, we should take some precautions. We should at least make an effort today, rather than waiting until the catastrophes are about to happen.\nChina has so far been slow in rolling out a nationwide law to regulate AI. What are the factors behind that?\nThere are a lot of reasons why China is being held back.\nFirstly, it is similar to the concerns of the industry that regulation will hold back innovation.\nAnd secondly, geopolitics and the geo-tech rivalry with the US also play a role, because both countries feel that we shouldn’t tie our own hands at this point to accelerate our own AI development, when China is already facing so many restrictions from the US.\nChina doesn’t want to put obstacles in the way of its own domestic innovation. China is kind of walking a tightrope when it comes to regulating AI, and they have to strike a very delicate balance, deciding on the one hand that this technology could have dangerous capabilities, but on the other hand they don’t want to stifle innovation.\nSimilarly, if you look at the United States, like the J.D. Vance speech in Europe recently and all the signals coming out of the White House, they are also abandoning all the previous efforts of the Biden administration and now taking a very lax stance, at least at the federal level, on regulating AI.\nChina’s governance structure is complex. For example, the Interim Measures for the Management of Generative AI Services in 2023 was jointly issued by seven departments. Which department has the most say in regulating AI? And what role might China’s new National Data Bureau play in this?\nWhen it comes to enforcing the interim measures it is undoubtedly the CAC. Because this is the agency where AI developers would have to submit their safety assessment.\nThe Ministry of Science and Technology and the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology are also powerful AI regulators in China, in the sense that they are more in charge of how to promote the development of AI rather than regulating its content.\nBased on public information, this National Data Bureau appears to be responsible for collecting and consolidating important data, with the aim of analysing it to identify valuable insights.\nThe bureau’s success in coordinating data resources could provide significant input for AI models. And if this data could be used for training purposes without violating the law, that would be a huge advantage.\nBut so far I haven’t heard any concrete news about how the National Data Bureau has played a practical role in accelerating these efforts.\nIn other countries, like the UAE, they have an AI minister dedicated to collecting data and promoting the development of AI.\nBeijing initiated a regulatory storm against big tech companies a few years ago. Can AI expect something similar?\nThe Chinese government is in a honeymoon phase with the whole AI industry – we see this very clearly with the recent symposium that President Xi [Jinping] held with the leading Chinese tech entrepreneurs [with] several AI bosses sitting at Xi’s table. Clearly the government recognises that this is an important technology that can accelerate China’s industrial capability and can also bring back a lot of the animal spirits for Chinese private entrepreneurs and also significantly improve investor sentiment.\nI think the Chinese top leadership recognises the important role of these AI companies and they will be extremely cautious about introducing any rules and regulations that might be perceived negatively by foreign investors who have just started to come back into the market.\n\nIf a “super AI” were to emerge would it happen in China, the US or elsewhere? What policy and regulatory preparations should be made for that day?\nI think it will happen first in the US, because they have almost all the frontier AI models that we are talking about.\nIn terms of human-like robots, I think China is very good, but they’re not driven by frontier AI models, so we’ll have to wait and see how it goes. But I would not be surprised if we also see a DeepSeek moment with humanoid robots from China.\nIn terms of policy and regulatory preparation … there were various AI labs in the US that put a lot of effort into doing imaging, safety testing and so on.\nAnd there was a point where companies such as OpenAI were pouring tremendous resources, like 20 per cent of their computing power, into safety projects. So, on the surface, it looks like there is quite a commitment for US AI labs to do alignment before a product release.\nI’m not sure how much effort Chinese AI developers have put into testing AI products. I think those tests are going to be tremendously important when we start thinking about new and emerging AI products such as autonomous agents and humanoid robots.\nI am concerned that if companies rush to launch the products and these products are so accessible and affordable – thanks to China’s product diffusion capability – then that could pose quite a serious threat to society. I think Chinese regulators should start thinking about what to do about these potential problems and make sure that these companies have sufficient safety testing internally before they launch products to the public.","summary":"Angela Zhang is a law professor at the University of Southern California Gould School of Law.

He was always on top of his briefs.”\n\n“Original Sin” was published in May with reports that a “politburo” of longtime Biden aides — and even family members like First Lady Jill Biden and the president’s son Hunter — were really running the country, while the president served as little more than a figurehead.\n\nIt also claimed Biden was largely incapable of maintaining his focus for extended periods of time, and that his administration actively worked to conceal his decline from the public even as he pursued a second term in the white house.\n\nBiden ultimately dropped out of the presidential race in July after a disastrous and largely incoherent performance against Donald Trump during their presidential debate.\n\nAllies of Biden have denied the allegations in “Original Sin,” insisting that its authors didn’t know what they were talking about.\n\n“The people who wrote those books were not in the White House with us, and they didn’t see how hard Joe worked every single day,” former first lady Jill Biden told “The View” earlier in May.\n\nThe book’s release coincided with the news that Biden had been diagnosed with an “aggressive” prostate cancer.","summary":"Former President Bill Clinton denied explosive new claims that President Joe Biden&#8217;s cognitive decline left him unable to run the country &#8212; and insisted he was &#8220;never&#8221; worried about the 82-year-old&#8217;s competence. “I saw President Biden not very long ago, and I thought he was in good shape,&#8221; Clinton, 78, told CBS Sunday Morning when...","url":"https://nypost.com/2025/06/01/us-news/bill-clinton-insists-biden-was-in-good-shape-despite-bombshell-claims-of-decline-from-insiders/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/06/comp-clinton-denies-claims-biden-105712126.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/0dMJ5P8A-RyIcpnTz.mp4","publish_date":"2025-06-01 21:59:39","author":"Alex Oliveira","authors":["Alex Oliveira"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.157}]}
