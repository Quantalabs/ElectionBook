The official added that the intensive work is ongoing and will continue in the coming days as mediation efforts move forward.\n\nThe leaders agreed that this is a critical moment for Ukraine, for its people, and for the shared security of the Euro-Atlantic region, underscoring the importance of continued coordination among key partners.\n\nAs European officials work closely with Washington on Ukraine, Trump's interview published Tuesday revealed widening strains in transatlantic ties. US President Donald Trump criticised Europe's handling of immigration and the war in Ukraine, describing the region as 'decaying' and 'weak', comments that come amid growing unease between Washington and several long-standing allies.\n\nIn the Politico interview, Trump renewed pressure on Ukraine, urging President Volodymyr Zelensky to move ahead with elections despite the ongoing conflict and claiming Moscow currently had the 'upper hand'. His remarks followed the release of the administration's national security strategy, which drew sharp reactions from several European capitals.\n\nTrump argued that migration policies had left European nations vulnerable, saying, 'They want to be politically correct, and it makes them weak,' adding that there were 'some real stupid ones' among Europe's leaders. He also voiced frustration with Europe's role in Ukraine as discussions continue on a US-backed proposal to end the conflict.\n\nRecalling a past exchange at a NATO summit, Trump said, 'NATO calls me daddy,' while criticising defence contributions, stating, 'They talk, but they don't produce. And the war just keeps going on and on.'\n\nEuropean governments, despite these tensions, have intensified efforts to maintain alignment with Washington since Trump's return to office--particularly on Ukraine. A French minister described the US strategy as an 'extremely brutal clarification' of Washington's current stance.\n\nIn his interview, Trump said countries including Britain, France, Germany, Poland and Sweden were being 'destroyed' by migration. He also criticised London Mayor Sadiq Khan, calling him 'horrible, vicious, disgusting', prompting Khan to respond that Trump was 'obsessed' with him.\n\nOn Ukraine, Trump reiterated calls for elections, saying, 'I think it's an important time to hold an election. They're using war not to hold an election... It gets to a point where it's not a democracy anymore.' Ukraine postponed its 2024 elections due to martial law following Russia's 2022 invasion.\n\nHe added it 'would be nice' if Zelensky read the US proposal, noting that 'a lot of people are dying.' US negotiators held talks in Moscow last week and continued discussions with Ukrainian officials, though no breakthrough has been announced.\n\nZelensky, responding Tuesday, said he was 'ready for the elections' if security could be ensured and indicated that Ukraine planned to send an updated version of its position on the US plan.

Before the election, political opponents also accused the government, helmed by Castro and her left-leaning Libre Party, of intimidating election authorities.\n\nPreliminary results show Rixi Moncada, Libre’s presidential candidate, trailing far behind centre-right Salvador Nasralla and Trump-backed Nasry Asfura, who currently leads by a small margin of about 40,000 votes, or about 1.32 percent.\n\nResults have yet to be finalised, and Moncada has said that she will not recognise the outcome as legitimate. Nasralla has also condemned Trump’s intervention before the election, saying that the US leader’s threat that ties with Honduras would suffer if Nasralla won, cost him votes.\n\nTechnical issues experienced during the counting process by the National Electoral Council (CNE) have also added to the uncertainty, and CNE leader Ana Paola Hall requested the military to deploy forces outside of buildings where ballots are being stored.\n\nProtests seeking clarity on the outcome of voting have remained peaceful, but tensions remain high, stoked by memories of previous flawed elections and violent repression following the 2009 coup.\n\nCivil society groups have urged calm and patience.","url":"https://haitigazette.com/honduran-military-vows-to-ensure-orderly-post-election-power-transfer/","image":"https://haitigazette.com/app/uploads/2025/12/AP25344132150384-1765394275-Iq4u8M.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-10 23:42:41","author":"Cb_usr","authors":["Cb_usr"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"ht","sentiment":0.184},{"id":386897946,"title":"Trump Administration Adds Militarized Zone Along California's Southern Border","text":"SANTA FE, N.M. (AP) — The Trump administration is adding another militarized zone to the southern U.S. border to support border security operations — this time in California.\n\nThe Department of Interior on Wednesday said it would transfer jurisdiction along most of California’s international border with Mexico to the Navy to reinforce “the historic role public lands have played in safeguarding national sovereignty.”\n\nThe newly designated militarized zone extends nearly from the Arizona state line to the Otay Mountain Wilderness, traversing the Imperial Valley and border communities including Tecate.\n\nSince April, large swaths of border have been designated militarized zones, empowering U.S. troops to apprehend immigrants and others accused of trespassing on Army, Air Force or Navy bases, and authorizing additional criminal charges that can mean prison time. More than 7,000 troops have been deployed to the border, along with an assortment of helicopters, drones and surveillance equipment.\n\nThe military strategy was pioneered in April along a 170-mile (275-kilometer) stretch of the border in New Mexico and later expanded to portions of the border in Texas and Arizona.\n\nThe Interior Department described the newest national defense area in California as a high-traffic zone for unlawful crossings by immigrants. But Border Patrol arrests along the southern U.S. border this year have dropped to the slowest pace since the 1960s, amid President Donald Trump’s push for mass deportations.\n\n“By working with the Navy to close long-standing security gaps, we are strengthening national defense, protecting our public lands from unlawful use, and advancing the President’s agenda,” Interior Secretary Doug Burgum said in a news release.\n\nAn emergency declaration by Trump has thrust the military into a central role in deterring migrant crossings between U.S. ports of entry. Legal experts say the strategy flouts a ban on law enforcement by the military on U.S. soil and thrusts the armed forces into a potentially politicized mission.\n\nThe new militarized zone was announced Wednesday as a federal judge ordered the Trump administration to stop deploying the California National Guard in Los Angeles and return control of those troops to the state.\n\nTrump called up more than 4,000 California National Guard troops in June without Gov. Gavin Newsom’s approval to further the Trump administration’s immigration enforcement efforts.","url":"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/trump-administration-adds-militarized-zone-along-california-border_n_6939fde2e4b053d6e8ece7c6?origin=home-politics-feed-unit","image":"https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/6939fde519000027167f3cec.jpeg?cache=jraWfGRXg1&ops=1778_1000","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-10 23:20:56","author":null,"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.205},{"id":386900064,"title":"Trump says US has seized 'very large' tanker near Venezuela and that 'other things are happening'","text":"Take part in our latest brand partnership survey\n\nWe need your help now\n\nSupport from readers like you keeps The Journal open.\n\nYou are visiting us because we have something you value.

For multiple… pic.twitter.com/dNr0oAGl5x— Attorney General Pamela Bondi (@AGPamBondi) December 10, 2025 \n\n“We’ve just seized a tanker on the coast of Venezuela, a large tanker, very large – the largest one ever seized, actually,” Trump told reporters at the start of a roundtable with business leaders at the White House.\n\n“And other things are happening, so you’ll be seeing that later.”\n\nBondi said the tanker was part of an “illicit oil shipping network” used to carry sanctioned oil from Venezuela and Iran.\n\nUS media reported that the tanker was heading for Cuba, another American rival, and was detained by the US Coast Guard.\n\nTrump just said the tanker “was seized for a very good reason.”\n\nTrump’s announcement came a day before Venezuelan Nobel Peace Prize winner and opposition leader Maria Corina Machado was set to address the world from Oslo after coming out of hiding.\n\nMachado, who won the Nobel for challenging Maduro’s grip on power in oil-rich Venezuela, has not been seen out in the open for months after threats to her life.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nVenezuela had warned she could be arrested as a fugitive if attempting to re-enter the country after traveling for the Nobel, but Trump warned Caracas against any such step.\n\n“I don’t like if she would be arrested, I wouldn’t be happy with it,” Trump told reporters.\n\n‘State terrorism’\n\nAfter saying she was coming to Norway but would not arrive in time for Wednesday’s prize ceremony, Machado will make her first public appearance at a press conference in Oslo at 9.15 Irish time tomorrow, Norway’s government said.\n\nAccepting the award on Machado’s behalf today, her daughter delivered her blistering acceptance speech, in which she urged her compatriots to fight for freedom against “state terrorism” by Maduro.\n\nTrump’s administration has piled pressure on Maduro in recent months, deploying a fleet of warships and the world’s largest aircraft carrier under the pretext of combating drug trafficking.\n\nThe United States has also carried out deadly strikes on more than 20 alleged drug boats in the region, killing at least 87 people.\n\nWashington has accused Maduro of leading the alleged “Cartel of the Suns,” which it declared a “narco-terrorist” organization last month.\n\nTrump told Politico on Monday that Maduro’s “days are numbered” and declined to rule out a US ground invasion against Venezuela.\n\nMaduro – the political heir to leftist leader Hugo Chavez – says the US is bent on regime change and wants to seize Venezuela’s oil reserves.\n\nThe Venezuelan army swore in 5,600 soldiers on Saturday after Maduro called for stepped-up military recruitment.\n\nTrump’s administration also alleges that Maduro’s hold on power is illegitimate and that he stole Venezuela’s July 2024 election – a claim backed by opposition leader Machado.\n\nSince going into hiding, Machado’s only public appearance was on 9 January, in Caracas, where she protested against Maduro’s inauguration for his third term.\n\n- © AFP 2025 \n\nSend Tip or Correction\n\nEmbed this post\n\nTo embed this post, copy the code below on your

But it does not include insurance coverage for military families to get fertility treatments, including embryo transfers for in vitro fertilization, something opposed by Republican House Speaker Mike Johnson of Louisiana, a social conservative.\n\nThe legislation is a compromise between versions of the NDAA passed earlier this year by the Senate and House, both controlled by Trump’s Republicans. Members of both parties urged lawmakers to support it even if they objected to individual provisions.\n\n“I do support this bill. This does not mean that I do not have concerns. I do,” said Representative Adam Smith of Washington, the top Democrat on the House Armed Services Committee, in a speech before the vote.\n\nTrump in May asked Congress for a national defense budget of $892.6 billion for fiscal year 2026, flat compared with 2025. The House bill set spending at that level, but the Senate had authorized $925 billion.\n\nThe NDAA authorizes Pentagon programs, but does not fund them. Congress must separately pass funding in a spending bill for the fiscal year ending in September 2026.\n\nIn addition to the typical NDAA provisions on defense acquisitions and competition with rivals like China and Russia, this year’s bill focuses on cutting programs reviled by Trump, such as diversity, equity and inclusion training.\n\nThe NDAA is one of a few major pieces of legislation to make it through Congress every year and lawmakers take pride in having passed it annually since 1961.\n\nThis year’s process was a bit rockier than usual.\n\nThe rule paving the way for the House vote passed earlier today by only 215 to 211 after a long delay in which a few Republicans changed their votes from “no” to “yes.”\n\nTrump has said he will sign the NDAA into law once it reaches the White House.","summary":"WASHINGTON >> The U.S. House of Representatives passed a massive defense policy bill today, authorizing a record $901 billion in annual military spending, paving the way for the must-pass measure to become law for a 65th straight year.","url":"https://www.staradvertiser.com/2025/12/10/breaking-news/house-passes-901b-defense-bill-sending-ndaa-to-senate/","image":"https://www.staradvertiser.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/web1_20251210_brk_cap01.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-10 23:00:00","author":"Reuters","authors":["Reuters"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.028},{"id":386900056,"title":"Ukraine sends US updated plan to end war","text":"Take part in our latest brand partnership survey\n\nWe need your help now\n\nSupport from readers like you keeps The Journal open.\n\nYou are visiting us because we have something you value.

And we said, before we go to a meeting, we want to know some things,” Trump added.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n“They would like us to go to a meeting over the weekend in Europe, and we’ll make a determination depending on what they come back with. We don’t want to be wasting time”.\n\n‘Let people fight it out’\n\nTalks between US officials and Russian President Vladimir Putin in the Kremlin last week also failed to reach a breakthrough.\n\nThe threats of a full Trump pull-out have come at a delicate time for Zelenskyy, whose army is on the back foot in the war-torn eastern Donbas region while a corruption scandal engulfs several of his close associates.\n\nThe Ukrainian leader – who Trump has accused of not reading the plan – said yesterday the plan had been broken down into three documents – a framework 20-point agreement, and two separate papers: one on security guarantees and another on Ukraine’s post-war recovery.\n\nEarlier today, Zelenskyy said he had held an online meeting with US President Donald Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner, US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and BlackRock CEO Larry Fink to discuss Ukraine’s recovery.\n\n“This could be considered the first meeting of the group that will work on a document concerning reconstruction and economic recovery of Ukraine,” Zelenskyy said on social media.\n\n“We have also updated our reflections on the 20 points of the framework document for ending the war. It is overall security that will determine economic security and underpin safe business environment,” he added.\n\nBut US leader gave the latest in a series of hints that he may walk away from a conflict he blames on his predecessor Joe Biden, and which he once said he could end within 24 hours of returning to office in January.\n\n“Sometimes you have to let people fight it out and sometimes you don’t,” Trump said on Wednesday.\n\n“But the problem with letting people fight it out is yet you’re losing thousands of people a week. It’s ridiculous. The whole thing is ridiculous.”\n\n- © AFP 2025 \n\nSend Tip or Correction\n\nEmbed this post\n\nTo embed this post, copy the code below on your site\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEmail “Ukraine sends US updated plan to end war”.\n\nRecipient's Email\n\nFeedback on “Ukraine sends US updated plan to end war”.\n\nYour Feedback\n\nYour Email (optional)\n\nReport a Comment\n\nPlease select the reason for reporting this comment.\n\nPlease give full details of the problem with the comment...\n\nDonald Trump\n\nVladimir Putin\nVolodymyr Zelenskyy\n\nNews in 60 seconds\n\nCommunity in grief\n‘We won’t be intimidated’: Edenderry turns out for vigil to mourn Mary and Tadgh\n\nEimer McAuley\n\nnew childcare plan\nIncreased income limits to reduce childcare bills for thousands of working families in 2026\n\nChristina Finn\n\n32 mins ago\n\nThe Morning Lead\nImmigration fell significantly last year but asylum applications reached a record high\n\nAndrew Walsh\n\n37 mins ago\n\nNicolas Maduro\nTrump says US has seized 'very large' tanker near Venezuela and that 'other things are happening'\n\nMan charged after arrest as part of cross-border investigation into violent right-wing extremism\n\nthe postmortem\nFF review to be published next week as reports swirl Gavin agreed to candidacy in early August\n\nballinalack\nMan airlifted to hospital following collision between truck and car in Westmeath\n\nLuas Green Line to remain out of service until after 'evening peak commuter period'\n\nGardaí release footage of fatal Edenderry arson that killed four-year-old boy and his great-aunt\n\nFactCheck: Does the US really buy 80% of its imported butter from Ireland?\n\nDavid MacRedmond\n\n'Profound breach of trust': Teachers' union slams Minister over Assessment of Need changes\n\nmore from us\n\nInvestigates\n\nMoney Diaries\n\nThe Journal TV\n\nJournal Media\n\nAdvertise With Us\n\nAbout FactCheck\n\nOur Network\n\nFactCheck Knowledge Bank\n\nTerms & Legal Notices\n\nTerms of Use\n\nCookies & Privacy\n\nAdvertising\n\nCompetition\n\nmore from us\n\nTV Listings\n\nGAA Fixtures\n\nThe Video Review\n\nJournal Media\n\nAdvertise With Us\n\nOur Network\n\nThe Journal\n\nFactCheck Knowledge Bank\n\nTerms & Legal Notices\n\nTerms of Use\n\nCookies & Privacy\n\nAdvertising\n\nCompetition\n\n© 2025 Journal Media Ltd\n\nTerms of Use\n\nCookies & Privacy\n\nAdvertising\n\nCompetition\n\nSwitch to Desktop\nSwitch to Mobile\n\nThe Journal supports the work of the Press Council of Ireland and the Office of the Press Ombudsman, and our staff operate within the Code of Practice.

This pushed the final passage vote from 4 p.m. to 4:45 p.m.\n\nReps. Lauren Boebert (R-CO), Tim Burchett (R-TN), Anna Paulina Luna (R-FL), Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-GA), and Thomas Massie (R-KY) were the consistent “no” votes on the rule for over an hour.\n\nJohnson could only afford to lose three Republican votes due to his razor-thin margin, so leadership had to bounce back and forth between the five to try to sway them.\n\nAt one point, an unlikely quad — House GOP Conference Chairwoman Lisa McClain (R-MI), Johnson, Greene, and Massie — were sitting in a row together talking. McClain mostly chatted with Greene while Johnson spoke to Massie, though Greene and the speaker had a brief conversation before Majority Whip Tom Emmer (R-MN) joined the conversation.\n\nOn the other side of the room, a handful of centrist Republicans did not cast a vote, forcing leadership to leave the conservative holdouts and join their group to convince them to vote for the rule. Among the centrist holdouts included Reps. Brian Fitzpatrick (R-PA), Nick LaLota (R-NY), Mike Lawler (R-NY), and Rob Bresnahan (R-PA).\n\nEventually, all the centrists voted for the rule, and four of the five conservative holdouts flipped their votes from “no” to “yes.” Massie remained the sole “no” vote on the rule.\n\nGreene said in a post to X that she flipped to a “yes” because Majority Leader Steve Scalise (R-LA) promised that her bill, the Protect Children’s Innocence Act, would get a vote next week on Wednesday. She said the legislation is “one of President Donald Trump’s key campaign promises and executive orders,” which comes as she and the president are at war over her outspokenness on the issues within the Republican Party.\n\nBoebert, Burchett, and Luna told CNN that they spoke with Secretary of State Marco Rubio to ensure that money for certain non-governmental organizations will not go to the Taliban, an issue Burchett, in particular, has been pushing. They also said that they got assurances on moving forward with Luna’s bill banning congressional stock trading and a concession from the speaker on a crypto bill to prevent the creation of Central Bank Digital Currency.\n\nA failed rule vote would have been a significant blow to Johnson’s leadership. Though historically a rare occurrence, Johnson has had six rule votes fail under his leadership since taking up the gavel from ousted Speaker and former Rep. Kevin McCarthy. The last rule failure was on July 15, when 13 conservatives tanked a rule vote for a slate of cryptocurrency bills and an appropriations bill over problems with some of the crypto legislation.\n\nLeadership has frequently blamed the razor-thin majority and the diversity of ideologies among their conservative colleagues as the reason for the drama, but Johnson himself has repeatedly said he wished he could have a “normal Congress.”\n\nThe NDAA now goes to the Senate for final passage. The legislation is likely to come up for a vote next week.","summary":"The National Defense Authorization Act passed the House on Wednesday afternoon, a win for Speaker Mike Johnson (R-LA) after he had to endure another round of drama from members of his own conference.

Jacky Rosen (D-Nev.), one of eight Democrats who voted to fund the government last month, said in an interview with HuffPost. \n\n“I was proud of that,” Sen. John Fetterman (D-Pa.) said of his vote. “Forty-two million Americans had food insecurity, and all these people weren’t getting paid around here, too.”\n\nAt the time of the vote to end the shutdown, the senators insisted the conditions were ripe for a bipartisan deal to extend the subsidies. \n\n“There was zero chance of dealing with the ACA issue as long as the shutdown continued… but there’s a lot better chance now,” Sen. Angus King (I-Maine) said at the time. “I would take a reasonable chance against no chance every day.”\n\nThe vote Democrats were promised on health care as part of the deal is set to arrive on Thursday. But it’s safe to say the “reasonable chance” of dealing with expiring subsidies will ultimately result in nothing, meaning health insurance premiums will rise by hundreds of dollars per month for an average family.\n\nDemocrats are set to offer a three-year extension of the subsidies. The bill will fail due to widespread GOP opposition to anything having to do with Obamacare. Republicans have also insisted on making reforms to the subsidy program, which was originally passed by Democrats amid the COVID-19 pandemic. \n\nRepublican senators, under pressure on health care, decided earlier this week to offer a competing GOP bill on the Senate floor that would replace the enhanced Obamacare subsidies with a taxpayer-funded Health Savings Account. But that plan will also fail to garner the necessary 60 votes to advance in the Senate because of opposition from Democrats, who maintain it would offer “junk insurance” that wouldn’t cover serious illnesses.\n\nThe failure of a vote on extending the subsidies this month would come as no surprise. Many Democrats warned during the shutdown that Republicans had no intention of following through on health care if the government reopened. But the moderates in the Democratic caucus, who had misgivings about their party’s strategy from the beginning, ultimately relented after 43 days of partisan gridlock that led to long lines at food banks around the country and widespread delays and groundstops at the nation’s busiest airports. \n\nKing, an independent who caucuses with Democrats, maintains that voting to fund the government was ultimately the right thing to do, even as he acknowledges there’s unlikely to be a solution.\n\n“They’re going to have an opportunity to extend the tax credits, and now they’re scrambling to put together some other proposal, which doesn’t appear to me to be very persuasive,” King told HuffPost. “Either we’re going to extend the tax credits, or my Republican colleagues are going to own the massive increases that are about to take place, and frankly, I don’t understand why they don’t want to come to the table.”\n\nDuring the shutdown, Republicans said over and over again that they’d be willing to sit down and discuss health care after Democrats voted to fund the government. President Donald Trump even vowed to invite top Democratic congressional leaders to discuss the issue at the White House. That didn’t happen, and after an aborted attempt to unveil his own plan, Trump instead endorsed the alternative GOP plan authored by Sens. Bill Cassidy (R-La.) and Mike Crapo (R-Idaho) that would convert the Obamacare subsidies into a direct payment to Americans.\n\n“Under the Democrats’ plan, the insurer decides your care,” Cassidy said Tuesday. “Under ours, the patient has the power to shop, compare prices, and lower health care costs.”\n\nHealth experts, however, said the GOP plan wouldn’t prevent skyrocketing health insurance premiums for people enrolled in Obamacare health insurance exchanges and for people on private insurance next year. They also noted that healthy people could be better off under that plan than people who are sick.\n\nSeveral other Republicans have introduced proposals that would extend the subsidies for one or two years, but they include more stringent limits on eligibility and restrictions on state funding for abortions. \n\nDemocrats who urged their party to hold the line on government funding last month said that GOP opposition to extending the subsidies was all too predictable. And even if a bipartisan deal somehow comes together in the coming weeks, there’s no guarantee that it would be taken up by the GOP-controlled House.\n\n“Republicans weren’t telling the truth when they said they’ll negotiate in good faith once the government opens,” said Sen. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.). “We’re looking at partisan proposals because the majority leader is not interested, and has never been interested, in getting to a bipartisan solution to the health care crisis that’s about to descend across our country. I wish that weren’t the case, but it’s always been the case.”\n\nIf there’s one silver lining Democrats can take away from the health care fight, however, it’s that they’re putting Republicans on defense ahead of next year’s midterm elections. Polls show that lowering costs is a top priority for most Americans, and Republicans in both the House and Senate have struggled to coalesce around a single idea to address health care affordability. Trump, meanwhile, has repeatedly dismissed “affordability” in general as a con job and a Democratic hoax. \n\n“I just think it’s too complicated and too difficult to get done in the limited amount of time we have left,” Sen. Thom Tillis (R-N.C.) told reporters on Wednesday of the various GOP plans on health care.\n\nTillis, who is retiring next year, has repeatedly warned that Democrats will hammer the GOP over the issue if they don’t act.\n\n“If you created an extension [of Obamacare subsidies] of some sort, you can create that forcing mechanism that maybe gives us the opportunity to work on that next year.

But I’m telling you, if we don’t get something done in December, Democrats are not going to play ball next year.”\n\nJennifer Bendery contributed reporting.","url":"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/obamacare-premiums-democrats-shutdown_n_6939cecbe4b028000c5a9cd4?origin=home-politics-feed-unit","image":"https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/6939ceef19000079087f3caa.jpeg?ops=1778_1000","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-10 22:30:57","author":"Igor Bobic","authors":["Igor Bobic"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.365},{"id":386898788,"title":"In a region coveted by Putin, how one targeted city carries on","text":"After a particularly harrowing night of Russian drone and missile strikes this month, Viktoria Horban knew exactly what she would do to lift the spirits of her beleaguered city near the front lines of Russia’s war on Ukraine.\n\n“I thought, today is the right day to put up the Christmas decorations in the shop,” says the ebullient store clerk at Ramazan, a women’s fashion shop on Sloviansk’s main square, where she has “helped women feel beautiful” for 23 years.\n\n“I knew the tree and the twinkling lights would cheer people up,” she says. “With all the sadness and uncertainty we are experiencing, I thought we needed something happy and bright.”\n\nDespite valiant efforts like Ms. Horban’s, these are far from the happiest of times in Sloviansk, a city in Ukraine’s eastern Donetsk region known for its ceramics industry – and which is less than 20 miles from the front.\n\nA turbulent decade saw the city briefly seized by Russia-backed separatists in April 2014, then liberated months later at high cost by Ukrainian forces, only to face the accelerating violence of the full-scale invasion which began in February 2022. Now, a depopulated and largely economically inactive Sloviansk is again under threat.\n\nRussia’s onslaught of strikes against civilian infrastructure here has recently intensified, while Russian forces on the eastern front line, stalled and perishing at devastating rates over the summer, have again made small – but for Ukrainians, demoralizing – territorial advances.\n\nBut perhaps most harrowing for the people of Sloviansk are Russian President Vladimir Putin’s repeated vows to take all of Ukraine’s Donetsk region – 70% of which his forces already occupy – either through a diplomatic agreement or militarily.\n\nEven as Ukraine and its European allies mount resistance to U.S. pressure for territorial concessions, that menacing vow puts Sloviansk and the neighboring industrial city of Kramatorsk in Mr. Putin’s crosshairs. And it leaves Sloviansk’s residents, now thought to number less than 50,000, down from 111,000 in January 2022, contemplating a forbidding future for themselves and the city they call home.\n\nFor one thing, they are well aware of the scorched-earth tactics Russia has resorted to in the territory it has seized. The nearby city of Pokrovsk, which a fatigues-clad Mr. Putin claimed last week had fallen to his forces, offers the latest testimony. Drone footage accessible online shows a lifeless, bomb-blasted urban expanse of collapsed buildings and charred vehicles. Posts from Russian military media depict soldiers raising the Russian flag over destroyed municipal buildings.\n\nOn Wednesday, Oleksandr Syrskyi, commander in chief of Ukraine’s armed forces, said five square miles in Pokrovsk’s north remain in Ukrainian control.\n\n“We don’t want to leave”\n\n“We all know what Putin is saying. Of course, it is very scary, and it makes us think what we might have to do for our family’s safety,” says Nataliia Grigorova, who recently brought husband Andrii and son Mykyta on a tour of the Christmas decorations in Sloviansk’s Mulberry Park, where she is employed.\n\n“But we don’t want to leave, we have made our lives here,” she adds as she smiles tenderly at Mykyta, who watches ducks floating on a park pond. “Sloviansk is our home.”\n\nThe lament and worry that grips people here over the geopolitical vise their region is held in is augmented by knowledge that U.S. President Donald Trump appears to be siding with Mr. Putin on his demand for all of Donetsk. The United States once vowed to support Ukraine against Russia “as long as it takes.”\n\nWhite House officials as well as European officials briefed on Mr. Trump’s latest stab at a Ukraine peace plan say territorial concessions, and specifically the ceding to Russia of all of the larger Donbas region, which includes Donetsk, are indeed a key feature of the proposal.\n\nOn Sunday, President Trump expressed frustration over Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy’s resistance to the plan. Then, a day later in London, European leaders advised Mr. Zelenskyy to stand firm on his refusal to cede to Russia any territory under Ukrainian control – including 30 percent of Donetsk, where an estimated 100,000 Ukrainians live.\n\nMr. Zelenskyy has said that giving up all of Donetsk – including the cities of Sloviansk and Kramatorsk – would not only gift Mr. Putin territory it might otherwise take him years to conquer, but it would also open the gates to a Russian invasion of regions south and west of Donetsk.\n\nMr. Zelenskyy said on Wednesday he’d be sending an amended peace plan to the U.S. “soon.”\n\n“How would you feel?”\n\nAt the dress shop, Ms. Horban says that, though Mr. Putin’s pledge directly threatens the people of Sloviansk, it should also be of concern to the wider world.\n\n“I would ask anyone, how would you feel if someone came to your house and said to you, ‘One way or another I will take your home, so you might as well just give it to me?’” she says.\n\nBut the Russian leader’s threat also has implications for international security, she adds. “If Putin gets his way, to me, it says we have returned to the days when it’s the guy with the biggest stone who wins.”\n\nAt Sloviansk’s Fire Station 37, senior firefighter and rescue coordinator Dmytro Udalov confirms that Mr. Putin’s words are the talk of the town – no doubt part of the Russian president’s objective.\n\n“Everyone is aware of what he said, they know what Russia does in the places it occupies, and it makes them scared,” says the Sloviansk native. To explain “what Russia does,” he turns to firetruck driver Pavlo Chernyi, who transferred to Sloviansk from Pokrovsk in January.\n\n“The fear that what I lived through in Pokrovsk might be repeated here – who doesn’t have that feeling in his stomach?” Mr. Chernyi says.\n\nMr. Udalov says the last three years of firefighting and rescue operations in Sloviansk have demonstrated just how much more dangerous and challenging emergency service work has become.\n\n“We now have to deal with the glide bombs and the drones,” he says, indicating the anti-drone netting that now cloaks the firetrucks like a fishnet. “We have to worry about the double-taps,” he says, referring to the Russian practice of hitting a site, waiting for emergency services to arrive, and then striking the same spot to maximize casualties.\n\nJust hours after Mr. Udalov spoke, a Russian glide bomb struck a Sloviansk apartment tower, killing one woman and destroying or damaging dozens of apartments.\n\nAs repair work got underway the next morning, emergency workers in lime-green vests tossed chunks of plaster, insulation, and mangled appliances from exposed upper floors. Volunteers with the Angels of Salvation humanitarian organization cut plywood to cover blasted windows against the cold.\n\nOutside one building’s door, a group of Jehovah’s Witnesses waits to help a “sister in faith” move out belongings while her unit is repaired.\n\n“These are very stressful times in Sloviansk, all we can do is help each other and pray to God to support our sister Liudmyla who lost her home, and all of us living here,” says Nataliia Borzenkova, a nurse who plans to stay in Sloviansk “for now” because her job is secure.\n\nHer fellow church member Hennadiy Kumpan says he has only swear words he’s not supposed to use to describe Mr. Putin, so he vows to keep quiet. But he then offers: “How am I supposed to feel when someone comes to my place and says, ‘You can’t live here, I’m taking it’?”\n\nFor many in Sloviansk, the sign that Mr. Putin’s vow has taken a critical step closer to fruition will be the day local administrators declare a mandatory evacuation of children. That, they say, would be a dark day in Sloviansk’s fight to remain a place where families can live and flourish in safety.\n\nAt Fire Station 37, Mr. Udalov says it’s always the elderly who most resist leaving and relocating to safer areas. He understands their “sentimental feelings” for their homes, but says holding out until the last minute also puts others in danger.\n\nAnd while he has no desire to leave his hometown, Mr. Udalov says he tells himself his life would not be over just because it was no longer in Sloviansk.\n\n“I’m not so attached to this place as the elderly are. If I lose my apartment, I can rent one somewhere else. I have even thought,” he adds, “that if it happened soon, I would be able to see how they celebrate the New Year in another city of Ukraine.”\n\nOleksandr Naselenko supported reporting for this story.","summary":"Russia’s Vladimir Putin has vowed to take all of the mostly occupied Donetsk region either through negotiation or militarily.

Yet tucked into the over-3,000-page bill are several measures that push back against the Department of Defense, including a demand for more information on boat strikes in the Caribbean and support for allies in Europe, such as Ukraine.\n\nOverall, the sweeping bill calls for a 3.8% pay raise for many military members as well as housing and facility improvements on military bases. It also strikes a compromise between the political parties — cutting climate and diversity efforts in line with Trump’s agenda, while also boosting congressional oversight of the Pentagon and repealing several old war authorizations. Still, hard-line conservatives said they were frustrated that the bill does not do more to cut U.S. commitments overseas.\n\n“We need a ready, capable and lethal fighting force because the threats to our nation, especially those from China, are more complex and challenging than at any point in the last 40 years,” said Rep. Mike Rogers, the GOP chair of the House Armed Services Committee.\n\nLawmakers overseeing the military said the bill would change how the Pentagon buys weapons, with an emphasis on speed after years of delay by the defense industry. It’s also a key priority for Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth. Rep. Adam Smith, the top Democrat on the armed services panel, called the bill “the most ambitious swing at acquisition reform that we’ve taken.”\n\nStill, Smith lamented that the bill does not do as much as Democrats would like to rein in the Trump administration but called it “a step in the right direction towards reasserting the authority of Congress.”\n\n“The biggest concern I have is that the Pentagon, being run by Secretary Hegseth and by President Trump, is simply not accountable to Congress or accountable to the law,” he said.\n\nThe legislation next heads to the Senate, where leaders are working to pass the bill before lawmakers depart Washington for a holiday break.\n\nSeveral senators on both sides of the aisle have criticized the bill for not doing enough to restrict military flights over Washington. They had pushed for reforms after a midair collision this year between an Army helicopter and a jetliner killed all 67 people aboard the two aircraft near Washington’s Ronald Reagan National Airport. The National Transportation Safety Board and families of the victims have also voiced opposition to that section of the bill, raising concerns that it would make the airspace more dangerous.\n\nHere’s what the defense bill does as it makes its way through Congress.\n\nBoat strike videos and congressional oversight\n\nLawmakers included a provision that would cut Hegseth’s travel budget by a quarter until the Pentagon provides Congress with unedited video of the strikes against alleged drug boats near Venezuela. Lawmakers are asserting their oversight role after a Sept. 2 strike where the U.S. military fired on two survivors who were holding on to a boat that had partially been destroyed.\n\nThe bill also demands that Hegseth allow Congress to review the orders for the strikes.\n\nReaffirm commitments to Europe and Korea\n\nTrump’s ongoing support for Ukraine and other allies in Eastern Europe has been under doubt over the last year, but lawmakers included several positions meant to keep up U.S. support for countering Russian aggression in the region.\n\nThe defense bill requires the Pentagon to keep at least 76,000 troops and major equipment stationed in Europe unless NATO allies are consulted and there is a determination that such a withdrawal is in U.S. interests. Around 80,000 to 100,000 U.S. troops are usually present on European soil. It also authorizes $400 million for each of the next two years to manufacture weapons to be sent to Ukraine.\n\nAdditionally, there is a provision to keep U.S. troops stationed in South Korea, setting the minimum requirement at 28,500.\n\nCuts to climate and diversity initiatives\n\nThe bill makes $1.6 billion in cuts to climate change-related spending, the House Armed Services Committee said. U.S. military assessments have long found that climate change is a threat to national security, with bases being pummeled by hurricanes or routinely flooded.\n\nThe bill also would save $40 million by repealing diversity, equity and inclusion offices, programs and trainings, the committee said. The position of chief diversity officer would be cut, for example.\n\nIraq War resolution repeal\n\nCongress is putting an official end to the war in Iraq by repealing the authorization for the 2003 invasion. Supporters in both the House and Senate say the repeal is crucial to prevent future abuses and to reinforce that Iraq is now a strategic partner of the U.S.\n\nThe 2002 resolution has been rarely used in recent years. But the first Trump administration cited it as part of its legal justification for a 2020 U.S. drone strike that killed Iranian Gen. Qassim Suleimani.\n\nLifting final Syria sanctions\n\nCongress would permanently remove U.S. sanctions put on Syria after the Trump administration temporarily lifted many penalties.\n\nLawmakers imposed economically crippling sanctions on the country in 2019 to punish former leader Bashar Assad for human rights abuses during the nearly 14-year civil war. After Syrian President Ahmed al-Sharaa led a successful insurgency to depose Assad, he is seeking to rebuild his nation’s economy.\n\nAdvocates of a permanent repeal have said international companies are unlikely to invest in projects needed for the country’s reconstruction as long as there is a threat of sanctions returning.\n\nLack of IVF coverage\n\nDemocrats criticized Johnson for stripping a provision from the bill to expand coverage of in vitro fertilization for active duty personnel. An earlier version covered the medical procedure, known as IVF, which helps people facing infertility have children.","summary":"The annual National Defense Authorization Act typically gains bipartisan backing.","url":"https://www.twincities.com/2025/12/10/us-congress-defense-bill/","image":"https://www.twincities.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/US_Australia_Britain_Hegseth_37584-1.jpg?w=1600&resize=1600,900","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-10 22:24:43","author":"Associated Press","authors":["Associated Press"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.134},{"id":386896376,"title":"First of 30 oil lease sales planned for Gulf of Mexico draws $279 million in bids from companies","text":"By MATTHEW BROWN and MATTHEW DALY\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) — Oil companies offered $279 million for drilling rights in the Gulf of Mexico on Wednesday in the first of 30 sales planned for the region under Republican efforts to ramp up U.S. fossil fuel production.\n\nThe sale came after President Donald Trump’s administration recently announced plans to allow new drilling off Florida and California for the first time in decades. That’s drawn pushback, including from Republicans worried about impacts to tourism.\n\nWednesday’s sale was mandated by the sweeping tax-and-spending bill approved by Republicans over the summer. Under that legislation, companies will pay a 12.5% royalty on oil produced from the leases. That’s the lowest royalty level for deep-water drilling since 2007.\n\nThirty companies submitted bids, including industry giants Chevron, Shell and BP, federal officials said. The total amount of high bids was down by more than $100 million from the most recent lease sale in the Gulf of Mexico, under former Democratic President Joe Biden, in December 2023.\n\n“This sale reflects a significant step in the federal government’s efforts to restore U.S. energy dominance and advance responsible offshore energy development,” said Laura Robbins, acting director of the Gulf region for the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management, which is part of the Interior Department.\n\nThe administration’s promotion of fossil fuels contrasts sharply with its hostility to renewable energy, particularly offshore wind. A judge on Monday struck down an executive order from Trump blocking wind energy projects, saying it violated U.S. law.\n\nEnvironmentalists said the fossil fuel sales would put wildlife in the Gulf at an higher risk of dying in oil spills. Spills occur regularly in the region and have included the 2010 Deepwater Horizon tragedy that killed 11 workers in an oil rig explosion and unleashed a massive spill.\n\n“The Gulf is already overwhelmed with thousands of oil rigs and pipelines, and oil companies are doing a terrible job of cleaning up after themselves,” said Rachel Matthews with the Center for Biological Diversity.\n\nErik Milito, president of the National Ocean Industries Association, an industry group, said the takeaway from Wednesday’s sale was that the Gulf “is open.”\n\nWhile results of individual lease sales may fluctuate, Milito added, “the real success is the resumption of a regular leasing cadence.”\n\nThe industry and Republican lawmakers had complained that the Biden administration conducted only a handful of lease sales in the Gulf — the largest source of U.S. offshore oil production — as it moved away from fossil fuels to address climate change.\n\n“Knowing that (another lease sale) is coming in March 2026 allows companies to plan, study, and refine their bids, rather than being forced to respond to the uncertainty of a politically-driven multi-year pause” in leasing, Milito said.\n\nAt least two lease sales annually are mandated through 2039 and one in 2040.\n\nAdministration officials cited the new, more predictable schedule as a reason for the lower bidding by oil companies. “They are not pressed to come in all at once,” Robbins told reporters at an online news conference.\n\nThe Gulf lease sale supports an executive order by Trump that directs federal agencies to accelerate offshore oil and gas development, Interior Secretary Doug Burgum said in a statement. The sale should unlock investment, strengthen U.S. energy security and create jobs, he said.\n\nBut Earthjustice attorney George Torgun said the Trump administration conducted the sale without analyzing how it would expose the entire Gulf region to oil spills, how communities could be harmed by pollution and how it could devastate vulnerable marine life such as the endangered Rice’s whale, which numbers only in the dozens and lives in the Gulf of Mexico.\n\nThe environmental group has asked a federal judge to ensure that the lease sale and future oil sales better protect Gulf communities.\n\nOnly a small portion of parcels offered for sale typically receive bids, in areas where companies want to expand their existing drilling activities or where they foresee future development potential. It can be years before drilling occurs.\n\nThe drilling leases sold in December 2023 and during another sale in March 2023 are held up by litigation, according to Robbins. A federal court ruled this spring that Interior officials did not adequately account for impacts to planet-warming greenhouse gas emissions and the Rice’s whale.\n\nBrown reported from Billings, Montana.","summary":"Thirty companies submitted bids, including industry giants Chevron, Shell and BP.","url":"https://www.twincities.com/2025/12/10/trump-oil-lease-sale/","image":"https://www.twincities.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Trump-Oil_Lease_Sale_63364-1.jpg?w=1600&resize=1600,900","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-10 22:15:49","author":"Associated Press","authors":["Associated Press"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.162},{"id":386896760,"title":"David Letterman: Donald Trump Is a ‘Fool’ Who ‘Should Expect and Examine Every Bit of Ridicule He Receives’","text":"David Letterman sat down for an interview on “Jimmy Kimmel Live!” and came out swinging against Donald Trump, who is often the subject of ridicule during Jimmy Kimmel’s monologues.

Trump confirmed the news shortly after.\n\n“We’ve just seized a tanker off the coast of Venezuela – large tanker, very large, largest one ever seized, actually,” Trump said during an event at the White House. “And other things are happening. So you’ll be seeing that later, and you’ll be talking about that later with some other people.”\n\nAt a roundtable with business leaders, when faced with questions about the tanker, Trump encouraged reporters to “follow the tanker”. He also declined to identify the vessel’s owner.\n\n“You’re going to get that information later,” he said, adding later: “I assume we’re going to keep the oil.”\n\nThe Trump administration has ramped up threats against Venezuela, deploying considerable military forces to the Caribbean region. That includes the deployment of the world’s largest aircraft carrier, the USS Gerald Ford, and its strike group to the southern Caribbean.\n\nUnder Trump, the US has also carried out a campaign of lethal strikes against alleged drug-trafficking boats in the Caribbean Sea and eastern Pacific Ocean, with the Trump administration identifying Venezuela as the origin point for some of the vessels. At least 22 boats have been attacked, and an estimated 87 people have been killed.\n\nTrump has repeatedly threatened to continue the bombing campaign by pursuing strikes on land as well.\n\nVenezuelan President Nicolas Maduro has said that the US is seeking to topple his government.\n\nHe has responded with his own military buildup along Venezuela’s coast and indicated his country’s armed forces would resist a military attack from the US.\n\nOil exports are a key source of revenue for the South American country, which exported more than 900,000 barrels per day last month. Oil futures rose following the seizure.\n\nAl Jazeera correspondent Mike Hanna noted that information about the tanker seizure remains scarce.\n\n“There aren’t many details about the seizure of this tanker, apart from the president’s confirmation,” said Hanna.\n\nBut, he added, the seizure is likely to escalate an already volatile situation in the Caribbean.\n\n“This does mark a massive escalation in terms of US action against Venezuela. It has been reported that President Trump has been pondering for weeks now what kind of action to take in Venezuela and has been very clear that he is contemplating regime change,” he said.\n\nBut the US has taken action to seize high-value materials linked to Venezuela in the past. In February 2024, under then-President Joe Biden, the US seized a cargo plane Iran allegedly sold to Venezuela, claiming it violated sanctions on Tehran.\n\nThen, a year later, the Trump administration seized a Dassault Falcon 2000EX jet linked to a state-run oil company in Venezuela, also claiming sanctions violations, this time against restrictions on the South American country.\n\nThe Maduro government denounced that seizure as “brazen theft”.\n\nTrump also recently declared Venezuelan airspace closed to travel, prompting foreign airlines to pause their flights to the country.\n\nTrump’s rivalry with Maduro stretches back to the Republican leader’s first term in office, when he imposed a campaign of “maximum pressure” on Venezuela.\n\nThe latest spike in tensions, however, has been met with domestic and international condemnation.\n\nJust this month, two United Nations experts issued a joint statement expressing “deep concern about mounting pressure from the United States on Venezuela”.\n\nPolls in the US also show disapproval over the escalating tensions. A November poll from The Economist and YouGov found that only 17 percent of US adults support using military force to overthrow the Venezuelan government, with 45 percent opposed.\n\nAnd on Wednesday, a Reuters/Ipsos poll released on Wednesday found that 48 percent of respondents expressed opposition to the administration’s targeting of alleged drug vessels, widely considered illegal under international law.\n\nAbout 45 percent, meanwhile, said that they generally supported using force near Venezuela to stem the flow of drugs, with 36 percent expressing opposition.\n\nWhile Trump indicated earlier this month he had been in contact with Maduro, he told reporters on Wednesday that he has not spoken to the Venezuelan leader since then.","url":"https://stvincenttribune.com/trump-admin-seizes-oil-tanker-off-venezuela-coast-reports/","image":"https://stvincenttribune.com/app/uploads/2025/12/breaking-news@2x-bo1SJL.png","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-10 22:06:09","author":"Cb_usr","authors":["Cb_usr"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"vc","sentiment":-0.04},{"id":386896210,"title":"US Congressman Randy Fine suggests Palestinians should ‘be destroyed first’  - St. Vincent Tribune – Daily","text":"United States Congressman Randy Fine, an ally of President Donald Trump, has suggested that the Palestinian people should be destroyed, boasting that he is not afraid to be called Islamophobic.\n\nDuring a congressional hearing on Tuesday, Fine – who has a long history of Islamophobic and anti-Palestinian statements – cited the myth that Israelis are banned from going to some areas in the occupied West Bank due to “apartheid” imposed against Israeli settlers.\n\nIn reality, the Israeli military, which controls the Palestinian territory, has signs warning settlers against entering Palestinian towns for safety concerns.\n\nBut settlers, often armed and protected by Israeli forces, regularly storm and ransack Palestinian villages. At least two US citizens have been killed in settler attacks this year.\n\n“When you are dealing with a group of people who continually call for the destruction of the State of Israel, who are OK with signs that say, ‘Jews may not enter these areas’, we want to be free of Jews, how do you make peace with that?” Fine asked Morton Klein, president of the Zionist Organization of America, during the hearing.\n\n“How do you create a long-term solution with that? Or is there another way that we have to go?”\n\nKlein – who previously used the slur “filthy Arab” and called for profiling Muslims in the US – said Islam needs to undergo a “reformation” and accept “Israel as a Jewish state”.\n\n“Nobody wants to talk about it. They’re afraid of being called Islamophobic,” Klein said.\n\nFine interrupted, saying, “I’m not afraid of that.”\n\nThe Republican US congressman, who represents a district in the state of Florida, then doubled down on his volatile rhetoric.\n\n“I don’t know how you make peace with those who seek your destruction. I think you destroy them first,” he said.\n\nA United Nations convention defines genocide as “acts committed with intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnic, racial, or religious group, including killing, causing harm, preventing births, forcibly transferring children, and imposing life conditions to cause destruction”.\n\nIsrael’s genocidal war on Gaza, which has killed nearly 70,400 Palestinians and turned nearly the entire territory into rubble, aimed to destroy the Palestinian people, leading rights groups and UN investigators have said.\n\nAbed Ayoub, executive director at the American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee (ADC), slammed Fine, calling him “the Temu version of Benjamin Netanyahu,” referring to the discount online retailer and the Israeli prime minister.\n\n“He’s hated by Republicans and Democrats for his policy of Israel first, Israel second, Israel third — Americans nowhere.

At least two US citizens have been killed in settler attacks this year.\n\n“When you are dealing with a group of people who continually call for the destruction of the State of Israel, who are OK with signs that say, ‘Jews may not enter these areas’, we want to be free of Jews, how do you make peace with that?” Fine asked Morton Klein, president of the Zionist Organization of America, during the hearing.\n\n“How do you create a long-term solution with that? Or is there another way that we have to go?”\n\nKlein – who previously used the slur “filthy Arab” and called for profiling Muslims in the US – said Islam needs to undergo a “reformation” and accept “Israel as a Jewish state”.\n\n“Nobody wants to talk about it. They’re afraid of being called Islamophobic,” Klein said.\n\nFine interrupted, saying, “I’m not afraid of that.”\n\nThe Republican US congressman, who represents a district in the state of Florida, then doubled down on his volatile rhetoric.\n\n“I don’t know how you make peace with those who seek your destruction. I think you destroy them first,” he said.\n\nA United Nations convention defines genocide as “acts committed with intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnic, racial, or religious group, including killing, causing harm, preventing births, forcibly transferring children, and imposing life conditions to cause destruction”.\n\nIsrael’s genocidal war on Gaza, which has killed nearly 70,400 Palestinians and turned nearly the entire territory into rubble, aimed to destroy the Palestinian people, leading rights groups and UN investigators have said.\n\nAbed Ayoub, executive director at the American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee (ADC), slammed Fine, calling him “the Temu version of Benjamin Netanyahu,” referring to the discount online retailer and the Israeli prime minister.\n\n“He’s hated by Republicans and Democrats for his policy of Israel first, Israel second, Israel third — Americans nowhere. He’s basically a foreign spokesperson at this point, and not even a good one,” Ayoub told Al Jazeera.\n\n“His unhinged, genocidal rhetoric shows his desperation as he tries to appease his bosses back in Tel Aviv.”\n\nThis isn’t the first time that Fine – who was elected to Congress earlier this year with the endorsements of Trump and the American Israel Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC) – has made inflammatory statements about Palestinians.\n\nIn 2021, Fine commented on a social post with a photo of a dead Palestinian child asking him how he sleeps at night with: “Quite well, actually!

Grilled Over Struggling Farmers: 'Are You Listening To Your Constituents?'","text":"CNN anchor Brianna Keilar on Tuesday demanded an answer from Rep. Mark Alford (R-Mo.) about the concerns of struggling farmers, one of whom recently said the industry is in extremely dire straits as a direct result of President Donald Trump’s tariffs.\n\nAlford appeared on “News Central” to discuss the matter with Keilar and quickly noted that the president has announced a $12 billion relief package for farmers, maintaining that Trump is solving the problem without acknowledging that he caused it.\n\n“We are giving the farmers their safety nets through 80% of the farm bill that was passed through the One Big Beautiful Bill,” the Missouri Republican told Keilar. “Those safety nets are there. An increase in reference prices. We are helping the American farmers.”\n\nAlford added that Trump “knows the importance of feeding America and the world.”\n\nKeilar noted that some farmers themselves appear to disagree, citing one in particular who reportedly confronted Alford during a town hall earlier this year to state that Trump’s tariff policy “really affects my world” and that the lawmaker is “skirting the issue of China.”\n\nKeilar also noted that American Soybean Association President Caleb Ragland told CNN on Tuesday that the Trump relief package “will only take care of about a quarter of the losses” that the average soybean farmer in the U.S. has endured this year.\n\nTrump announced a sweeping 10% baseline tariff in April on all U.S. imports, with levies on many countries set even higher. China, the largest buyer of U.S. soybeans, responded by halting those purchases entirely before resuming at a drastically lower level.\n\nThis has left U.S. farmers who rely on China in a difficult position, and while Trump plans to pay them under the Agriculture Department’s new Farmer Bridge Assistance Program, even Fox News star Brit Hume said this is only necessary because of his tariffs.\n\nKeilar on Tuesday asked Alford if the Trump administration is aware that farmers have been forced to pay a higher price for necessary materials such as fertilizer as a result of the tariffs — while selling their product at a much lower level because of those same tariffs, as well.\n\n“Do you think the administration is understanding this?” Keilar asked Alford, who replied: “They do, and they understand as I do that it was [former President] Joe Biden that drove up the price of fertilizer and fuel with his war on fossil fuels.”\n\n“Well, no, that’s not what this farmer told you,” she said. “So what do you say to him?”\n\n“Well, that’s what I’m saying to you,” replied Alford. “I’m telling you right now, fertilizer prices still need to come down. We have four, five fertilizer producers, we have fertilizer being produced in Ukraine and Russia—”\n\n“But that’s not what this farmer told you, and he’s the farmer who’s telling you — sir, excuse me,” Keilar interrupted. “This farmer, you heard him, he said this to you. This farmer explained to you when he saw his prices rise.”\n\nWhen the conservative lawmaker argued that fuel prices have decreased and will continue to do so “thanks to Donald Trump,” Keilar once again reiterated: “Are you listening to your constituents? Because he was very clear about why his prices were going up.”\n\nAlford responded by noting that he “did 15 stops” on a town hall tour and took 256 questions from his constituents, many of whom yelled at and insulted him. Alford then said he does “remember that farmer,” only to minimize his worries and praise Trump.\n\nHe said, “I understand his concern, but the large number of farmers in Missouri believe in Donald J. Trump and that he’s going to get things done.”","url":"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/mark-alford-brianna-keilar-struggling-farmers_n_69399d61e4b007ac563b3da9?origin=home-latest-news-unit","image":"https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/6939d6fa1900002e0b7f3cb5.jpeg?cache=I8oar8Ut4S&ops=1778_1000","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-10 21:48:15","author":"Marco Margaritoff","authors":["Marco Margaritoff"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.351},{"id":386897796,"title":"Trump Says the US Has Seized an Oil Tanker off the Coast of Venezuela","text":"WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump said Wednesday that the United States has seized an oil tanker off the coast of Venezuela as tensions mount with the government of President Nicolás Maduro.\n\nUsing U.S. forces to seize an oil tanker is incredibly unusual and marks the Trump administration’s latest push to increase pressure on Maduro, who has been charged with narcoterrorism in the United States. The U.S. has built up the largest military presence in the region in decades and launched a series of deadly strikes on alleged drug-smuggling boats in the Caribbean Sea and eastern Pacific Ocean. The campaign is facing growing scrutiny from Congress.\n\n“We’ve just seized a tanker on the coast of Venezuela, a large tanker, very large, largest one ever seized, actually,” Trump told reporters at the White House, later adding that \"it was seized for a very good reason.”\n\nTrump said “other things are happening,” but did not offer additional details, saying he would speak more about it later. When asked what would happen to the oil aboard the tanker, Trump said, “Well, we keep it, I guess.”\n\nThe seizure was led by the U.S. Coast Guard and supported by the Navy, according to a U.S. official who was not authorized to comment publicly and spoke on the condition of anonymity. The official added that the seizure was conducted under U.S. law enforcement authority.\n\nVenezuela has the world’s largest proven oil reserves and produces about 1 million barrels a day. Locked out of global oil markets by U.S. sanctions, the state-owned oil company sells most of its output at a steep discount to refiners in China.\n\nThe transactions usually involve a complex network of shadowy intermediaries, as sanctions have scared away more established traders. Many are shell companies, registered in jurisdictions known for secrecy. The buyers deploy so-called ghost tankers that hide their location and hand off their valuable cargoes in the middle of the ocean before they reach their final destination.\n\nMaduro did not address the seizure during a speech before a ruling-party organized demonstration in Caracas, Venezuela’s capital. But he told supporters that the country is “prepared to break the teeth of the North American empire if necessary.”\n\nMaduro, flanked by senior officials, said only the ruling party can “guarantee peace, stability, and the harmonious development of Venezuela, South America and the Caribbean.”\n\nMaduro previously has insisted the real purpose of the U.S. military operations is to force him from office.\n\nDuring past negotiations, among the concessions the U.S. has made to Maduro was approval for oil giant Chevron Corp. to resume pumping and exporting Venezuelan oil. The corporation’s activities in the South American country resulted in a financial lifeline for Maduro’s government.\n\nThe seizure comes a day after the U.S. military flew a pair of fighter jets over the Gulf of Venezuela in what appeared to be the closest that warplanes had come to the South American country’s airspace. Trump has said land attacks are coming soon but has not offered more details.\n\nThe Trump administration is facing increasing scrutiny from lawmakers over the boat strike campaign, which has killed at least 87 people in 22 known strikes since early September, including a follow-up strike that killed two survivors clinging to the wreckage of a boat after the first hit. \n\nSome legal experts and Democrats say that action may have violated the laws governing the use of deadly military force.\n\nLawmakers are demanding to get unedited video from the strikes, but Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth told congressional leaders Tuesday he was still weighing whether to release it. Hegseth provided a classified briefing for congressional leaders alongside Secretary of State Marco Rubio and CIA Director John Ratcliffe. \n\nIt was not immediately clear Wednesday who owned the tanker or what national flag it was sailing under. The Coast Guard referred a request for comment to the White House.\n\nAssociated Press writer Regina Garcia Cano in Caracas, Venezuela, contributed to this report.","summary":"President Donald Trump says the United States has seized an oil tanker off the coast of Venezuela as tensions mount with the government of President Nicolás Maduro.","url":"https://www.military.com/daily-news/2025/12/10/trump-says-us-has-seized-oil-tanker-off-coast-of-venezuela.html","image":"https://images01.military.com/sites/default/files/styles/full/public/2025-12/ApNewsroom_Trump_01441.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-10 21:45:59","author":"Aamer Madhani And Konstantin Toropin","authors":["Aamer Madhani And Konstantin Toropin"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.043},{"id":386896810,"title":"Trump admin seizes oil tanker off Venezuela coast: Reports  - Trinidad Tribune – Latest Trinidad And Tobago","text":"The United States has seized an oil tanker off the coast of Venezuela, where President Donald Trump has been threatening military action for the last several months.\n\nThe news outlets Reuters and Bloomberg reported on Wednesday that the US Coast Guard had led an operation to commandeer the vessel, but details of its name and location remain uncertain.

Democratic donors reportedly paid upward of $2,500 for VIP tables at the fundraising luncheon, which took place in the Seattle Convention Center’s sixth-floor ballroom.\n\n“These folks better not ever mistake our kindness for our weakness because we are going to defend our neighbors,” Walz said of deportation officers arresting illegal Somali immigrants. “These guys bring out the worst in me.”\n\n“But the antidote to that is positive actions to improve lives that go against what they are trying to do,” Walz continued. “So instead of demonizing our Somali community, we’re going to do more to welcome more in.”\n\nWalz is under fire for allegedly failing to stop massive fraud schemes in his home state. Some state workers from Minnesota’s Department of Human Services have blamed Walz, saying he is “100% responsible” and accusing him of “systematically” silencing whistleblowers who warned of fraud occurring under his watch.\n\nAs authorities continue to try to recover the stolen taxpayer funds, dozens of alleged fraudsters, most of them from Minnesota’s Somali diaspora, are facing federal charges for their suspected involvement in the sprawling schemes that targeted state-administered assistance programs.\n\nAlthough the criminal proceedings have unfolded over the past few years, with some prosecutions securing convictions, the cases are receiving renewed attention in light of the political firestorm engulfing Walz’s administration.\n\nAttempts to recover the stolen assets, both domestically and abroad, have been hindered since some of the convicted co-conspirators laundered the money through Africa-based shell companies or used it to pay off personal expenses, such as credit card bills, and finance their “lavish lifestyles,” according to prosecutors.\n\nDuring the recovery process, officials discovered that a considerable portion of the stolen funds was used to purchase luxury vehicles, designer goods, and high-end homes. Evidence presented at trial included pictures showing large amounts of cash on hand, gold jewelry purchased in Dubai, and a brand-new Porsche seized from one defendant’s residence, along with financial records for a $1.1 million property that he bought to construct a custom-built lake house, the Minnesota Star Tribune reported.\n\nIn other instances, individuals allegedly had family members still living in the homes that they were accused of purchasing with their ill-got gains.\n\nMeanwhile, recently convicted fraudster Abdimajid Mohamed Nur, who was ordered on Nov. 24 to pay nearly $48 million in restitution, spent a bulk of his profits on jewelry and a honeymoon trip to the Maldives.\n\nThe Washington Examiner contacted Walz’s office for comment.","summary":"Gov.&#160;Tim Walz&#160;(D-MN) said this week that he would “welcome more” Somali immigrants into&#160;Minnesota, as federal investigators continue to uncover the extent of widespread welfare&#160;fraud&#160;believed to have originated primarily from the state’s Somali population.

Because that is the will of the Venezuelan people,” he added in a speech, to applause.\n\nHowever, Venezuela’s Vice-President Delcy Rodriguez ironically compared the proceedings to a “funeral”, given Machado’s absence.\n\n‘State terrorism’\n\nMachado in her speech also denounced kidnappings and torture under Maduro’s rule, calling them “crimes against humanity” and “state terrorism, deployed to bury the will of the people”.\n\nDespite her absence from the ceremony, Nobel officials said she was “safe” and would arrive in Oslo by tomorrow at the latest.\n\nVenezuela has warned Machado that she would be labelled a “fugitive” if she left the country, putting her at risk of arrest when attempting to re-enter.\n\nBut her daughter assured the audience that her mother would return. “She wants to live in a free Venezuela, and she will never give up on that purpose,” Ana Corina Sosa Machado said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMachado’s mother and three daughters, and some Latin American heads of state, including Argentine President Javier Milei, were at the prize-giving at Oslo’s City Hall.\n\nWhile organisers said Machado had previously indicated she would attend, doubts had already been raised when a traditional press conference with the award winner on Tuesday was first postponed and then cancelled.\n\nMachado has accused Maduro of stealing Venezuela’s July 2024 election which she was banned from. Her claim is backed by much of the international community.\n\nVenezuelan President Nicolas Maduro displays his ballot before voting during the presidential election in Caracas, 28 July, 2024.Alamy Stock Photo\n\nAlamy Stock Photo\n\nShe has been hailed for her efforts in favour of democracy, but also been criticised for aligning herself with US President Donald Trump, to whom she has dedicated her Nobel.\n\nThe Oslo ceremony coincides with a large US military build-up in the Caribbean in recent weeks and deadly strikes on what Washington says are drug smuggling boats.\n\nMaduro insists that the goal of the US operations – which Machado has said are justified – is to topple the government and seize Venezuela’s oil reserves.\n\nNot seen since January\n\nSince going into hiding, Machado’s only public appearance was on January 9, in Caracas where she protested against Maduro’s inauguration for his third term.\n\nThe opposition claimed its candidate, Edmundo Gonzalez Urrutia, won the election. He now lives in exile, and was also in Oslo on Wednesday.\n\nMultiple other Nobel Peace Prize winners have been unable to collect their prizes in person. Family members usually do so on their behalf, Nobel Institute director Kristian Berg Harpviken explained this week.\n\nDoubts had been raised about how Machado would return to Venezuela if she made the trip. Her refusal to leave the country has helped boost her political power there.\n\n“She risks being arrested if she returns even if the authorities have shown more restraint with her than with many others, because arresting her would have a very strong symbolic value,” said Benedicte Bull, a professor specialising in Latin America at the University of Oslo.\n\nOn the other hand, “she is the undisputed leader of the opposition, but if she were to stay away in exile for a long time, I think that would change and she would gradually lose political influence”, she added.\n\nThe Nobel laureates in medicine, physics, chemistry, literature and economics all received their prizes from Sweden’s King Carl XVI Gustaf at a separate ceremony in Stockholm on Wednesday before a lavish banquet.\n\nThe prize consists of a diploma, a gold medal and the sum of $1.2 million – which is shared when several laureates are honoured in the same category.\n\n- © AFP 2025 \n\nSend Tip or Correction\n\nEmbed this post\n\nTo embed this post, copy the code below on your site\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEmail “Maria Corina Machado to make Oslo appearance tomorrow after missing Nobel peace prize ceremony”.\n\nRecipient's Email\n\nFeedback on “Maria Corina Machado to make Oslo appearance tomorrow after missing Nobel peace prize ceremony”.\n\nYour Feedback\n\nYour Email (optional)\n\nReport a Comment\n\nPlease select the reason for reporting this comment.\n\nPlease give full details of the problem with the comment...\n\nmaria corina machado\nNicolas Maduro\nNobel Peace Prize\n\nNews in 60 seconds\n\nCommunity in grief\n‘We won’t be intimidated’: Edenderry turns out for vigil to mourn Mary and Tadgh\n\nEimer McAuley\n\nnew childcare plan\nIncreased income limits to reduce childcare bills for thousands of working families in 2026\n\nChristina Finn\n\n32 mins ago\n\nThe Morning Lead\nImmigration fell significantly last year but asylum applications reached a record high\n\nAndrew Walsh\n\n37 mins ago\n\nNicolas Maduro\nTrump says US has seized 'very large' tanker near Venezuela and that 'other things are happening'\n\nUkraine sends US updated plan to end war\n\nMan charged after arrest as part of cross-border investigation into violent right-wing extremism\n\nthe postmortem\nFF review to be published next week as reports swirl Gavin agreed to candidacy in early August\n\nLuas Green Line to remain out of service until after 'evening peak commuter period'\n\nGardaí release footage of fatal Edenderry arson that killed four-year-old boy and his great-aunt\n\nFactCheck: Does the US really buy 80% of its imported butter from Ireland?\n\nDavid MacRedmond\n\n'Profound breach of trust': Teachers' union slams Minister over Assessment of Need changes\n\nmore from us\n\nInvestigates\n\nMoney Diaries\n\nThe Journal TV\n\nJournal Media\n\nAdvertise With Us\n\nAbout FactCheck\n\nOur Network\n\nFactCheck Knowledge Bank\n\nTerms & Legal Notices\n\nTerms of Use\n\nCookies & Privacy\n\nAdvertising\n\nCompetition\n\nmore from us\n\nTV Listings\n\nGAA Fixtures\n\nThe Video Review\n\nJournal Media\n\nAdvertise With Us\n\nOur Network\n\nThe Journal\n\nFactCheck Knowledge Bank\n\nTerms & Legal Notices\n\nTerms of Use\n\nCookies & Privacy\n\nAdvertising\n\nCompetition\n\n© 2025 Journal Media Ltd\n\nTerms of Use\n\nCookies & Privacy\n\nAdvertising\n\nCompetition\n\nSwitch to Desktop\nSwitch to Mobile\n\nThe Journal supports the work of the Press Council of Ireland and the Office of the Press Ombudsman, and our staff operate within the Code of Practice.

But the bottom line is that GDP growth is 4% right now and accelerating into next year with all the capital spending we’re seeing, and there’s never really ever in my memory, going all the way back to World War II ... has there been growth that high without job creation.”\n\nThe Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey, published by the Labor Department Tuesday, found that the number of layoffs across the U.S. rose to 1.9 million ― the highest figure since January 2023 ― in October. Though the number of job openings rose slightly from 7.66 to 7.67 million, the report also found a significant drop in the number of people quitting their jobs, often cited as a barometer of confidence in the labor market. \n\nHassett — who in 2024 had assets worth at least $7.6 million, according to Bloomberg ― is widely reported to be Trump’s top pick for the next Federal Reserve chair.\n\nElsewhere in his chat with Ingraham, Hassett attempted to shift most of the blame for the current economic concerns to Democrats and especially former President Joe Biden. \n\n“The fact is that Joe Biden dug a big hole, and we’re filling the hole really fast,” he said. “So what’s going to happen is people are going to look in their wallets and they’re going to understand how good Trump has been for the economy, as they did in 2019 as well.” \n\nAs for headlines in the “liberal media” which indicate that voters have lost confidence in Trump’s handling of the economy, he noted, “That’s because of the Democrats’ shutdown.”","url":"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/trump-economic-adviser-job-losses-report_n_6938a3e2e4b0fb6244b0dcad?origin=home-latest-news-unit","image":"https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/6939c7d019000064067f3c9e.jpeg?cache=dg9UTu7IHp&ops=1778_1000","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-10 21:19:11","author":"Curtis M.

But he told supporters his country was “prepared to break the teeth of the North American empire if necessary.”\n\nHe said only the ruling party could “guarantee peace, stability, and the harmonious development of Venezuela, South America and the Caribbean”.\n\nThe US President has ordered a massive US military build-up in the region, including an aircraft carrier, other warships, fighter jets and tens of thousands of troops.\n\nThe US has also carried out a series of military strikes on boats it has alleged are carrying drugs in the Caribbean Sea and eastern Pacific.\n\nSince early September, more than 20 such strikes have taken place, killing more than 80 people.\n\nVenezuela has the world’s largest proven oil reserves and produces approximately one million barrels a day.

The U.S. has built up the largest military presence in the region in decades and launched a series of deadly strikes on alleged drug-smuggling boats in the Caribbean Sea and eastern Pacific Ocean. The campaign is facing growing scrutiny from Congress.\n\n“We’ve just seized a tanker on the coast of Venezuela, a large tanker, very large, largest one ever seized, actually,” Trump told reporters at the White House, later adding that “it was seized for a very good reason.”\n\nTrump did not offer additional details. When asked what would happen to the oil aboard the tanker, Trump said, “Well, we keep it, I guess.”\n\nThe seizure was led by the U.S. Coast Guard and supported by the Navy, according to a U.S. official who was not authorized to comment publicly and spoke on the condition of anonymity. The official added that it was conducted under U.S. law enforcement authority.\n\nStorming the oil tanker \n\nThe Coast Guard members were taken to the oil tanker by helicopter from the aircraft carrier USS Gerald R. Ford, the official said. The Ford is in the Caribbean Sea after arriving last month in a major show of force, joining a fleet of other warships.\n\nVideo posted to social media by Attorney General Pam Bondi shows people fast-roping from one of the helicopters involved in the operation as it hovers just feet from the deck.\n\nThe Coast Guard members can be seen later in the video moving throughout the superstructure of the ship with their weapons drawn.\n\nBondi wrote that “for multiple years, the oil tanker has been sanctioned by the United States due to its involvement in an illicit oil shipping network supporting foreign terrorist organizations.”\n\nHalf of ship’s oil is tied to Cuban importer\n\nThe U.S. official identified the seized tanker as the Skipper. \n\nThe ship departed Venezuela around Dec. 2 with about 2 million barrels of heavy crude, roughly half of it belonging to a Cuban state-run oil importer, according to documents from the state-owned company Petróleos de Venezuela S.A., commonly known as PDVSA, that were provided on the condition of anonymity because the person did not have permission to share them.\n\nThe Skipper was previously known as the M/T Adisa, according to ship tracking data. The Adisa was sanctioned by the U.S. in 2022 over accusations of belonging to a sophisticated network of shadow tankers that smuggled crude oil on behalf of Iran’s Revolutionary Guard and Lebanon’s Hezbollah militant group. \n\nThe network was reportedly run by a Switzerland-based Ukrainian oil trader, the U.S. Treasury Departmeny said at the time.\n\nHitting Venezuela’s sanctioned oil business\n\nVenezuela has the world’s largest proven oil reserves and produces about 1 million barrels a day. \n\nPDVSA is the backbone of the country’s economy. Its reliance on intermediaries increased in 2020, when the first Trump administration expanded its maximum-pressure campaign on Venezuela with sanctions that threaten to lock out of the U.S. economy any individual or company that does business with Maduro’s government. Longtime allies Russia and Iran, both also sanctioned, have helped Venezuela skirt restrictions. \n\nThe transactions usually involve a complex network of shadowy intermediaries. Many are shell companies, registered in jurisdictions known for secrecy. The buyers deploy so-called ghost tankers that hide their location and hand off their valuable cargoes in the middle of the ocean before they reach their final destination.\n\nMaduro did not address the seizure during a speech before a ruling-party organized demonstration in Caracas, Venezuela’s capital. But he told supporters that the country is “prepared to break the teeth of the North American empire if necessary.”\n\nMaduro, flanked by senior officials, said only the ruling party can “guarantee peace, stability, and the harmonious development of Venezuela, South America and the Caribbean.”\n\nMaduro has insisted the real purpose of the U.S. military operations is to force him from office.\n\nDemocrat says the move is about ‘regime change’\n\nSen. Chris Van Hollen, D-Md., a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said the U.S. seizing the oil tanker cast doubt on the administration’s stated reasons for the military buildup and boat strikes.\n\n“This shows that their whole cover story — that this is about interdicting drugs — is a big lie,” the senator said. “This is just one more piece of evidence that this is really about regime change — by force.”\n\nThe seizure comes a day after the U.S. military flew a pair of fighter jets over the Gulf of Venezuela in what appeared to be the closest that warplanes had come to the South American country’s airspace. Trump has said land attacks are coming soon but has not offered more details.\n\nThe Trump administration is facing increasing scrutiny from lawmakers over the boat strike campaign, which has killed at least 87 people in 22 known strikes since early September, including a follow-up strike that killed two survivors clinging to the wreckage of a boat after the first hit. \n\nSome legal experts and Democrats say that action may have violated the laws governing the use of deadly military force.\n\nLawmakers are demanding to get unedited video from the strikes, but Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth told congressional leaders at a classified briefing Tuesday that he was still weighing whether to release it.\n\nThe Coast Guard referred a request for comment about the tanker seizure to the White House.\n\nGoodman reported from Miami, and Garcia Cano from Caracas, Venezuela.

They're basically hinting that they'll do it,\" he said.\n\nHoekstra insists the Canada-U.S. relationship had turned the page on the notion of Trump making Canada the 51st state and that the two nations' leaders have \"moved beyond it.\"\n\n\"The president and the prime minister seem to have gone well beyond it,\" Hoekstra said. \"They're now joking about it.\"\n\nThe ambassador pointed to an October meeting in Egypt where Trump accidentally called Carney president, Carney said \"I'm glad you upgraded me to president,\" and Trump said, \"at least I didn't say governor.\"\n\nLater that month, Trump ended trade talks with Canada over the Ontario anti-tariff ad.\n\nA 'disturbing read for America's allies'\n\nStephanie Carvin, an associate professor of international relations at Carleton University, said just because the Trump administration has produced a national strategy doesn't mean it will \"survive contact with reality.\" But it makes for a \"disturbing read for America's allies, including Canada.\"\n\n\"What is concerning to me is that there's a number of other ways to achieve these objectives that may not even use the instruments of state,\" she said.\n\nCarvin said the administration could leverage parts of the Trump political coalition, such as big tech or the religious right, in an influence campaign \"not necessarily targeting political parties but potentially targeting political movements in Canada.\"\n\nShe pointed to the significant chunk of the donations to Freedom Convoy originating from south of the border, and that Donald Trump Jr. endorsed the movement that disrupted life in the nation's capital for weeks.","summary":"","url":"https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/hoekstra-us-meddling-9.7010577?cmp=rss","image":"https://i.cbc.ca/ais/ff9b804f-d5bf-490e-adc5-3dd16b6fdcea,1765393793918/full/max/0/default.jpg?im=Crop%2Crect%3D%280%2C260%2C5000%2C2812%29%3B","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-10 20:12:11","author":"Kyle Duggan","authors":["Kyle Duggan"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"ca","sentiment":0.053},{"id":386901160,"title":"The Epstein files can finally be fully opened. Now all eyes are on Trump","text":"It was the first test of the new law demanding the release of the Jeffrey Epstein files – and the result was a dramatic victory.\n\nThis week a US judge ruled that all material related to the sex-trafficking investigation of the late paedophile in 2019 should be released.\n\nTwo other judges have already ruled that documents related to Epstein’s “madam”, Ghislaine Maxwell, and the 2006 investigation into the financier, should also be released.\n\nIn all three cases, requests to make the files public were rejected, but after the passage of the Epstein Files Transparency Act, which was signed into law last month by Donald Trump, judges changed their minds.\n\nThe grand jury material will now be added to the extensive tranche of information and pages of documents to be released by the US Department of Justice (DOJ).\n\nIt’s a huge moment for Epstein survivors and the wider public who want to know the truth about the paedophile, who was found dead in his cell in 2019 while awaiting trial on sex trafficking charges. Officials found he had committed suicide.\n\nThe ruling on the files comes a week before the deadline for the Department of Justice to release all the material it has related to the Epstein case.\n\nBut the decisions by judges in three federal cases is significant because they will operate on their own timetable, not that of the DOJ.\n\nWhile Attorney General Pam Bondi has promised to abide by the Epstein Files Transparency Act, having judges run their own unsealing processes provides a vital backstop to ensure that everything gets out and that no one can be blamed for stalling the release of information. \n\nVictims who I have spoken to, however, have little faith that the US government will do the right thing. \n\nThey have more faith in the judiciary, and in particular Judge Richard Berman, who oversaw the Epstein case in 2019 and was the third judge of the three to rule for unsealing.\n\nHe is the same judge who held an extraordinary final hearing in the Epstein case after the financier’s death, where his victims were allowed to speak in court about the damage he had wrought on their lives.\n\nJudge Berman appears to understand the need to protect the victims’ privacy, something that has not been the case with the DOJ so far.\n\nIn a letter filed with him last month, Brad Edwards, who has represented 300 Epstein victims in 11 countries, said documents already released by Congress – yet another separate process for releasing files – had caused his clients “significant emotional distress”.\n\nVictims’ names had not been redacted, leading to some of them being stopped by reporters in the street, in one case when she was with her nine-year-old son.\n\nEdwards’ scorching letter described the DOJ’s unsealing process as the “illusion of full disclosure” and a “distraction” from the real work that needed to be done.\n\nAgainst that breakdown in trust, the fact federal judges are going to be overseeing their own process is reassuring\n\nHowever, if unsealing is done right it will take time and could be frustrating. Thousands of files have already been made public related to a defamation lawsuit filed against Maxwell by the late Virginia Giuffre, an Epstein victim.\n\nWhile the case was settled in 2017, media organisations fought for two years to unseal the case files and the first tranche landed in 2019, shortly after Epstein’s arrest.\n\nThey were a bombshell, and included a draft of Giuffre’s memoir, lengthy depositions and flight records that revealed just who Epstein was flying on his private plane, dubbed the “Lolita Express”.\n\nSubsequent releases took years to roll out because anyone who was named in the papers had a chance to object and be heard in court. The redaction process took up an enormous amount of the court’s time, something that will be likely to happen with the forthcoming files too.\n\nIf the DOJ does try to keep to the 30-day deadline for releasing its Epstein documents – a deadline which falls on 19 December – then it runs the risk of exposing his victims yet again.\n\nSo far it seems messy, and in a recent court filing, DOJ lawyers said they were still working on a master list of victims and still working on their redaction system.\n\nAs Edwards put it in his letter: “These women are not political pawns. They are mothers, wives and daughters. They are human beings who have the right to be treated with dignity and respect and to feel safe and protected by our country, which has failed them time and time again.”","url":"https://inews.co.uk/news/world/epstein-files-finally-fully-opened-now-eyes-trump-2-4100960","image":"https://inews.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/SEI_277334326_fc5eec.jpg?crop=0px%2C42px%2C1200px%2C678px&resize=1200%2C675","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-10 20:07:18","author":"Daniel Bates","authors":["Daniel Bates"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.441},{"id":386896222,"title":"US general highlights ‘close cooperation’ with Syria against ISIL threats  - St. Vincent Tribune – Daily St","text":"The head of the US military’s Middle East-based Central Command, Brad Cooper, has said that the United States is working with Syrian forces to carry out operations against ISIL (ISIS), highlighting the collaboration between Washington and Damascus.\n\nSpeaking virtually at a Middle East Institute event on Wednesday, Cooper said the US military is working to “foster cooperation” with Syrian authorities.\n\n“We have now had multiple instances of collaboration with the Syrian government to counter very specific ISIS threats,” Cooper said.\n\nThe US general’s comments came on the first anniversary of the start of the Syrian transition after the fall of the government of President Bashar al-Assad in a lightning offensive by opposition fighters.\n\nCooper’s statement emphasising security cooperation in Syria underscores the stunning transformation in Damascus, which had close ties to US rivals Russia and Iran for decades under al-Assad’s rule.\n\nThe US commander also said the US is helping efforts to integrate the Kurdish-dominated Syrian Democratic Forces with the Syrian government.\n\nBacked by the US, the SDF controls large parts of the country’s northeast, where it enjoys de facto self-rule.

Parents’ Rights in Education Maine, an anti-transgender activist group, highlighted the vote in a social media post Tuesday night, as did House Republican Leader Billy Bob Faulkingham, who represents those towns.\n\nTo date, six Maine school districts have adopted similar policies following an executive order signed by President Donald Trump in February that defined gender as one’s “biological sex” and threatened to revoke federal funding from schools allowing transgender students to play sports or use locker rooms in line with their gender identity.\n\nThose districts are being sued by Maine Human Rights Commission, which alleges the policies discriminate against transgender students and violate state law specifically protecting students’ right to participate in classes and extracurriculars “without discrimination because of sex, sexual orientation or gender identity.”\n\nThe lawsuit also claims the policies encourage harassment of “students participating in girls’ sports who do not appear to the adults to be biological females.” The lawsuit notes one email where a community member “expressed their desire that ‘someone make an example out of’ a ‘piece of s— tranny’ in the third grade.”\n\nThe others districts named in the suit are Maine School Administration District 70 in Hodgdon, MSAD 52 in Turner, the Baileyville School District and the Richmond School Department. \n\nIt remained unclear Wednesday whether those districts will revert their policies or stick to their guns and representatives from those communities did not respond to media inquiries.\n\nThe districts’ policies and the Trump administration’s executive orders hinge on an interpretation of Title IX that argues allowing transgender athletes to compete in girls sports is a form of discrimination because it deprives women and girls of fair athletic opportunities. Such an interpretation has yet to be tested in court.\n\nWhen the issue was raised by RSU 24’s school board at an October meeting, dozens of community members spoke at that meeting about how the potential policy change and vitriolic discussion around it had effected their students. The board ultimately adopted the policy in a contentious 5-4 vote.\n\nVotes in other districts were not as close, with the exception of Richmond, which adopted its policy in a narrow 3-2 vote in October.\n\nRSU 24 and several other districts had retained Portland-based law firm Drummond Woodsum, which has represented hundreds of Maine school districts for years. But after the firm advised the district to follow state law, district officials voted Tuesday to engage with two conservative firms, Steve Smith Trial Lawyers in Augusta and Kroger Gardis & Regas, LLP, based in Indiana.\n\nTransgender students’ participation in youth athletics has become a contentious topic across the country, but especially in Maine. Gov. Janet Mills clashed with Trump over the topic at the White House in February, telling the President she would “see you in court.” The Department of Justice shortly after announced a lawsuit against Maine over the state’s human rights law.\n\nConservatives in the state have been collecting signatures to put a referendum on the 2026 ballot that could bar transgender students from school sports and private spaces that align with their gender identities. The Maine Principals’ Association has previously said there are only two transgender students playing sports in Maine currently.","summary":"Regional School Unit 24's board voted Tuesday to double down on its policy restricting transgender students to the bathrooms and sports teams in line with their biological sex.","url":"https://www.centralmaine.com/2025/12/10/another-maine-school-district-affirms-trans-athlete-policy-in-wake-of-state-lawsuit/","image":"https://www.centralmaine.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/12/Transgender_Day_of_Remembrance_14353_db8c53.jpg?w=780","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-10 19:49:24","author":"Dylan Tusinski","authors":["Dylan Tusinski"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.039},{"id":386899742,"title":"Ontario Liberals push province to sell off stored U.S. booze for charity","text":"Ontario’s Liberals are pushing Doug Ford’s government to sell the province’s stockpile of U.S. booze that is sitting in storage.\n\nLiberal parliamentary Leader John Fraser says Ford should tell the Liquor Control Board of Ontario to sell the booze and donate the proceeds to charity.\n\nFord pulled American alcohol off LCBO shelves in March in response to U.S. President Donald Trump imposing tariffs on Canadian goods.\n\n“Why don’t we just sell it off and use those profits and give it to food banks on behalf of all Ontarians?” Fraser said Wednesday.\n\nThe province said about $80 million worth of American booze is in storage and about $2 million worth could expire in the next six months.\n\nThe province is not ruling out the idea.\n\n“U.S. alcohol will remain off shelves and is being held in storage until further notice,” said Emily Hogeveen, a spokeswoman for Finance Minister Peter Bethlenfalvy.\n\n“We are currently exploring options for the products.”\n\nMost other provinces have also banned the import and sale of American booze.

In August, Israeli authorities approved construction on a controversial settlement project in the territory that would effectively cut it in two.\n\nThe government of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has come under heavy criticism from Palestinians and rights groups for accelerating settlement expansion in the West Bank, which they say is aimed at preventing the establishment of a future Palestinian state there.\n\nIsrael captured the West Bank, East Jerusalem and Gaza — areas claimed by the Palestinians for a future state — in the 1967 war. It has settled more than 500,000 Jews in the West Bank, in addition to over 200,000 more in contested East Jerusalem.\n\nIsrael's government is dominated by far-right proponents of the settler movement, including Smotrich and cabinet minister Itamar Ben-Gvir, who oversees the country's police force.\n\nSettler expansion has been compounded by a surge of attacks against Palestinians in the West Bank in recent months.\n\nDuring October's olive harvest, settlers across the territory launched an average of eight attacks daily, according to the United Nations humanitarian office, the most since it began collecting data in 2006. The attacks continued in November, with the UN recording at least 136 more by Nov. 24.\n\nSettlers burned cars, desecrated mosques, ransacked industrial plants and destroyed cropland.

Also sought would be metadata from electronically submitted photos, as well as extensive information from the applicant’s family members, including their places of birth and their telephone numbers.\n\nThe application that people are now required to fill out to take part in ESTA asks for a more limited set of questions such as parents’ names and current email address.\n\nAsked at a White House event whether he was concerned the measure might affect tourism to the U.S., President Donald Trump said no.\n\n“We want safety, we want security, we want to make sure we’re not letting the wrong people come into our country,” Trump said. \n\nThe public has 60 days to comment on the proposed changes before they go into effect, the notice said.\n\nCBP stressed in a statement Wednesday that the rule hasn’t yet gone into effect and wasn’t finalized.\n\n“Nothing has changed on this front for those coming to the United States. This is not a final rule, it is simply the first step in starting a discussion to have new policy options to keep the American people safe,” the agency said in a statement. \n\n“The Department is constantly looking at how we vet those coming into the country, especially after the terrorist attack in Washington DC against our National Guard right before Thanksgiving,” the statement read.\n\nThe announcement did not say what the administration was looking for in the social media accounts or why it was asking for more information. \n\nBut the agency said it was complying with an executive order that Trump signed in January that called for more screening of people coming to the U.S. to prevent the entry of possible national security threats. \n\nTravelers from countries that are not part of the Visa Waiver Program system are already required to submit their social media information, a policy that dates back to the first Trump administration. The policy remained during Democratic President Joe Biden’s administration.\n\nBut citizens from visa waiver countries were not obligated to do so.\n\nSince January, the Trump administration has stepped up checks of immigrants and travelers, both those trying to enter the U.S. as well as those already in the country. Officials have tightened visa rules by requiring that applicants set all of their social media accounts to public so that they can be more easily scrutinized and checked for what authorities view as potential derogatory information. Refusing to set an account to public can be considered grounds for visa denial, according to guidelines provided by the State Department.\n\nU.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services now considers whether an applicant for benefits, such as a green card, “endorsed, promoted, supported, or otherwise espoused” anti-American, terrorist or antisemitic views.\n\nThe heightened interest in social media screening has drawn concern from immigration and free speech advocates about what the Trump administration is looking for and whether the measures target people critical of the administration in an infringement of free speech rights.\n\nRebecca Santana, The Associated Press","summary":"WASHINGTON (AP) — Foreigners who are allowed to come to the United States without a visa could soon be required to submit information about their social media, email accounts and extensive family history to the Department of Homeland Security before being approved for travel.

And in a set of quarterly economic projections, Fed officials signaled they expect to lower rates just once next year.\n\nWednesday’s cut reduced the rate by a quarter-point to about 3.6%, the lowest it has been in nearly three years. Lower rates from the Fed can bring down borrowing costs for mortgages, auto loans, and credit cards over time, though market forces can also affect those rates.\n\nThree Fed officials dissented from the move, the most dissents in six years and a sign of deep divisions on a committee that traditionally works by consensus. Two officials voted to keep the Fed’s rate unchanged, while Stephen Miran, whom Trump appointed in September, voted for a half point cut.\n\nDecember’s meeting could usher in a more contentious period for the Fed. Officials are split between those who support reducing rates to bolster hiring and those who’d prefer to keep rates unchanged because inflation remains above the central bank’s 2% target. Unless inflation shows clear signs of coming fully under control, or unemployment worsens, those divisions will likely remain.\n\nAnd Trump could name a new Fed chair as soon as later this month to replace Powell when his term ends in May. Trump’s new chair is likely to push for sharper rate cuts than many officials may support\n\nA stark sign of the Fed’s divisions was the wide range of cuts that the 19 members of the Fed’s rate-setting committee penciled in for 2026. Seven projected no cuts next year, while eight forecast that the central bank would implement two or more reductions. Four supported just one. Only 12 out of 19 members vote on rate decisions.\n\nAt a press conference following the announcement of the rate cut, Powell signaled that the Fed may hold off on cutting rates at least in January, and said Fed officials “will carefully evaluate the incoming data,” adding that the Fed is “well positioned to wait to see how the economy evolves.” He did, however, rule out an increase in rates.\n\n“What you see is some people feel we should stop here and we’re in the right place and should wait, and some people think we should cut more next year,” Powell said.\n\nThe Fed met against the backdrop of elevated inflation that has frustrated many Americans, with prices higher for groceries, rents, and utilities. Powell has previously acknowledged those frustrations and said they reflect the sharp overall price increases in the five years since COVID. Consumer prices have jumped 25% in that time.\n\nIn a delayed report last week, the government said the Fed’s preferred inflation gauge remained high in September, with both overall and core prices rising 2.8% from a year earlier. That is far below the spikes in inflation three years ago but still painful for many households after the big run-up since 2020.\n\nThe Fed typically keeps its key rate elevated to combat inflation, while it often reduces borrowing costs when unemployment worsens to spur more spending and hiring.\n\nAdding to the Fed’s challenges, job gains have slowed sharply this year and the unemployment rate has risen for three straight months to 4.4%. While that is still a low rate historically, it is the highest in four years. Layoffs are also muted, so far, as part of what many economists call a “low hire, low fire” job market.\n\nThe lack of economic data since the government shutdown ended Nov. 13 has contributed to the divisions at the Fed. But when Fed officials next meet in late January, they’ll have up to three months of backlogged reports to consider. If those figures show that the job market has worsened, the Fed could reduce rates again in January.\n\nBy contrast, if hiring has stabilized while inflation remains elevated, they may hold off on additional cuts for several months.\n\nThe Fed met against the backdrop of Trump’s move to name a new Fed chair to replace Powell in May.\n\nIn an interview with Politico published Tuesday, Trump said “yes” when asked if reducing rates “immediately” was a litmus test for a new Fed chair. Trump has hinted that he will likely pick Kevin Hassett, his top economic adviser.\n\nHassett has often called for lower borrowing costs, but this week has been more circumspect. In an interview Tuesday on CNBC, when asked how many more rate cuts he would support, Hassett did not give a specific answer and said, “What you need to do is watch the data.”","url":"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/federal-reserve-cuts-key-rate-but-signals-higher-bar-for-future-reductions_n_6939c56fe4b0e8b9c9f8478a?origin=home-whats-happening-unit","image":"https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/6939c646260000eaec836acb.jpeg?cache=sDFQ8BuP5d&ops=1778_1000","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-10 19:18:12","author":null,"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.022},{"id":386883572,"title":"Cambodia-Thailand border clashes send half a million into shelters","text":"BANGKOK - Deadly military clashes at the border between Thailand and Cambodia this week have driven half a million people to evacuate their homes in a sharp escalation of a long-running territorial dispute.The bitter conflict between the two nations -- stemming from a disputed colonial-era demarcation of their 800-kilometre (500-mile) frontier -- has drawn the attention of US President Donald Trump, who has repeatedly pledged to broker peace.Here's what we know about the conflict:How did the latest clashes start?The border row has dragged on for decades, but the most recent fighting between the two countries began with a brief skirmish on Sunday that left two Thai soldiers wounded.Both sides claimed the other initiated an attack, with Cambodia maintaining on Sunday and Monday that it had not retaliated.Fighting escalated on Monday when Thailand launched air strikes against Cambodian military targets, and Phnom Penh later said it retaliated that evening.At least 14 people, including Thai soldiers and Cambodian civilians, have been killed as of Wednesday, while more than 500,000 have fled border regions near where jets, tanks and drones were waging battle.When was the last round of fighting?In May, a flare-up between the two countries began with military clashes on the border that left one Cambodian soldier dead.The two sides then hit each other with retaliatory measures, with Thailand restricting border crossings and Cambodia halting certain imports.A diplomatic phone call between Cambodia's ex-leader and Thailand's then-prime minister was leaked in June and led to a political crisis in Thailand and a change in government.All-out armed conflict broke out for five days in July, with Cambodia firing rockets and artillery into Thailand, and Thai F-16s carrying out strikes on Cambodian military targets.\n\nDozens were killed and around 300,000 displaced before the two nations agreed to a ceasefire in late July.How did this year's ceasefire fall apart?The shaky truce held until November, when Thailand paused its implementation after Thai soldiers were wounded by landmines at the border that Bangkok said were freshly planted.Cambodia has repeatedly said mines that have wounded Thai troops were relics of decades-old conflicts.This week, the deadliest clashes since July broke out, expanding to five provinces of both countries.Cambodia pulled its team out of the 2025 Southeast Asian Games taking place in Thailand, citing safety concerns for its athletes.\n\nWhat is the state of diplomacy?The United States, China and Malaysia, as the chair of the regional bloc ASEAN, brokered the cessation of fighting in July.In October, US President Donald Trump backed a follow-on joint declaration, touting new trade deals with Thailand and Cambodia after they agreed to prolong their ceasefire.Both sides agreed under the pact to withdraw heavy weapons from border regions. Thailand also pledged to return 18 captured Cambodian troops who are still being held by Bangkok.But Thailand suspended the agreement the following month.The US president said he was planning to \"make a phone call\" on Wednesday about the renewed clashes.The conflict is one of several that Trump claims to have ended.China -- which maintains strong ties with both countries -- called this week for the neighbours to \"exercise restraint\".What is the history of the dispute?Thailand and Cambodia's border was largely drawn up during the French occupation of Indochina between 1863 and the mid-1950s.During World War II, Thailand, then called Siam, gained certain Cambodian territories but was forced to hand them back to French rule in 1946.The 1979 overthrow of Cambodia's communist Khmer Rouge blurred the boundaries further as its last members fled to the borderlands.Dozens of kilometres remain contested, and in 2008, military clashes erupted over a patch of land next to the 900-year-old, UNESCO world heritage site, Preah Vihear temple, located on the border.Sporadic violence from 2008 to 2011 led to the deaths of two dozen people and the displacement of tens of thousands.","url":"https://www.newvision.co.ug/category/world/cambodia-thailand-border-clashes-send-half-a-NV_224283","image":"https://newvision-media.s3.amazonaws.com/cms/ae065d6f-b4f3-4ae1-afa2-cf66c2870ac2.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-10 19:06:04","author":null,"language":"en","source_country":"ug","sentiment":-0.056},{"id":386897002,"title":"From violence to sexism, the manosphere is doing real-world harm","text":"There’s a lot of debate around the extent to which the manosphere is playing out in young people’s lives and relationships. \n\nSome suggest claims about its malevolence are misplaced. Others think just because something happens on the internet doesn’t mean it affects lives offline.\n\nBut this is in spite of a significant body of international evidence demonstrating otherwise. \n\nIn this post-digital world, there is little or no delineation between what’s viewed and experienced online and what’s lived in the “real world”. This means we have to consider the potential harms of the manosphere not as remote or abstract, but as very real, and not to be underestimated or dismissed. \n\nThe manosphere is a dark, but growing part of the internet that’s harming everyone who gets sucked into it. In this three-part series, Mapping the Manosphere, we’ve asked leading global experts how it works, what the dangers are and how this online phenomenon is playing out in real life.\n\nThe gendered content spiral\n\nBroadly, the manosphere is centred on anti-feminist, misogynistic and anti-gender equity ideas and beliefs. \n\nContent can initially appear harmless. It presents information and insights on health, fitness and financial and career success. \n\nBut these are generally founded on rigid gendered ideas, extreme and isolating pursuits of self-optimisation and unhealthy ideas about relationships with girls and women.\n\nNew research has identified a shift in the manosphere towards monetisation and entrepreneurialism, pseudoscientific wellness and alignment with extremist ideologies. \n\nUsers may encounter content documenting extensive morning routines, beginning at 4am. These videos can involve multiple wellness-related rituals, recommendations for preserving testosterone and diatribes on men’s “natural” roles as providers in families. \n\nThe manosphere-adjacent content generated by tradwives and stay-at-home girlfriends glamorises an aesthetic (and unrealistically curated) life. A woman performs a caring role in the home, eschewing feminist ideas and advocating for women’s return to the domestic sphere. It’s often connected to white supremacy and far-right conservatism. \n\nThere’s evidence boys can find manosphere content helpful and positive. Some seek validation and belonging in these spaces. This makes the need for them to engage with it critically even more prescient.\n\n Read more:\n Andrew Tate's extreme views about women are infiltrating Australian schools. We need a zero-tolerance response\n\nReal world harm\n\nResearch widely shows manosphere content causes harm both to the boys and men who consume it and to other people in their lives. \n\nViewing manosphere content is known to contribute to unhealthy body image. \n\nIt’s also correlated with beliefs about violence being permissable. Manosphere sentiments have been identified among men who use violence. \n\nOur own research into the influence of manosphere content on boys’ behaviour in schools has shown a shift in boys’ attitudes towards women and girls. Teachers report a discernible uptick in incidents of gendered violence in their schools. \n\nThere is also emerging concern that manosphere content is contributing to a growing ideological shift among young men and young women. Across multiple countries, young men are voting more conservatively than they used to.\n\nFurther, there is abundant evidence that misogyny – a central theme in manosphere content – is a predictor of all forms of violence. This includes gendered and extremist violence. \n\nThere are growing calls to place misogyny at the centre our efforts to counter and prevent extremist violence. This means acknowledging the role of the manosphere in the process of radicalisation. \n\nRacist and misogynistic attitudes have also been identified as an urgent concern for national security, given they are significant contributors to violent extremism. \n\nThe next frontiers\n\nAlongside the established evidence, we’re seeing signs of where manosphere beliefs might manifest next, if they’re not already.\n\nIn relationships and dating, advice circulating in manosphere spaces will continue to frame intimacy in transactional and manipulative terms. This will erode trust and mutual respect, while normalising male entitlement in relationships. \n\nOver time, such messages risk reshaping, or regressing, expectations around dating, partnership and consent.\n\nThe manosphere frames work and study as competitive arenas. Discourses around “high-value men” and “grindset” culture blame feminism or “soft” values for perceived failures or inefficiencies. \n\nThis narrative positions career success as a masculine duty while dismissing collaboration and diversity, with long-term consequences for equity in schools and workplaces.\n\nFinally, manosphere narratives of crisis and decline dovetail with populist politics. In the United States, aggrieved male voters have been central to Donald Trump’s rise, attracted to his performance of strongman masculinity. \n\nSimilar dynamics may surface elsewhere as leaders draw on themes of protection, grievance and a return to “traditional” order.\n\nWhere to from here?\n\nThe danger with manosphere content is that it exaggerates and exploits real (and perceived) problems, issues and grievances among boys and men. \n\nThis means it’s becoming increasingly confusing to distinguish what are legitimate and reasonable concerns among young men, what has been manufactured and how victimhood can be constructed by manosphere ideologies. \n\nExplicitly honing young people’s critical digital literacy is an approach committed to empowering young people to become more discerning: to question not only what they are viewing, but its ideologies, how it makes them feel, and how platforms are designed to provoke particular responses. \n\nThese skills promote the development of critical dispositions: essential lifelong skills that will help them to consume information in a more informed, less reactive way. Critical literacy in kids helps them to become adults who are informed and discerning, and therefore, empowered.","summary":"Normalising violence, worsening body image and sexist attitudes are among the manosphere beliefs that are bleeding into relationships and workplaces.","url":"https://theconversation.com/from-violence-to-sexism-the-manosphere-is-doing-real-world-harm-262205","image":"https://images.theconversation.com/files/706613/original/file-20251205-56-bzhtgb.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&rect=0%2C50%2C1600%2C800&q=45&auto=format&w=1356&h=668&fit=crop","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-10 19:05:31","author":"Monash University","authors":["Monash University"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"AU","sentiment":0.442}]}
