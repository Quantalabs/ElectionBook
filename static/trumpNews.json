The reference to an Iranian axis includes Hamas, a Palestinian Islamist faction against which Israel waged a two-year Gaza war now suspended in a ceasefire, as well as Lebanon's Hezbollah movement, Houthi rebels in Yemen and Shiite militias in Iraq.Trump on Friday said the first round of indirect talks with Iran were “very good,” and that there will be another meeting early next week.“Iran looks like it wants to make a deal very badly. We have to see what that deal is but I think Iran looks like they want to make a deal very badly, as they should,” Trump said.In June, Iran launched hundreds of ballistic missiles at Israel, which sees the long-range conventional salvos as a major threat capable of overwhelming its air defenses.With assistance from Hadriana Lowenkron.©2026 Bloomberg L.P.This article was generated from an automated news agency feed without modifications to text.","url":"https://www.livemint.com/politics/netanyahu-to-meet-trump-next-week-as-iran-talks-set-to-continue-11770489953404.html","image":"https://www.livemint.com/lm-img/img/2026/02/07/1600x900/logo/Politics_1545994646567_1770489958752.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-02-08 18:45:52","author":"List.metadata.agency","authors":["List.metadata.agency"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"in","sentiment":-0.27},{"id":400502392,"title":"Gisele Bundchen flashes wedding ring for first time after secretly marrying Joaquim Valente… amid ex Tom Brady's midlife crisis","text":"SHARE SELECTION\n\nUK Celebrity News\n\nSubscribe Now\n\nKim Kardashian\nVictoria Beckham\nHarry Styles\nAmanda Holden\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEpstein took 'very cute' young Romanian model to private dinner at Buckingham Palace for Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor\n\nDitch Starmer for a caretaker leader, Labour MPs say... as insiders claim PM's closest aide McSweeney is on brink of quitting\n\nExplore the Epstein Files at the touch of a button: Read all the most explosive allegations, emails and pictures in the Mail's interactive Deep Dive\n\nBritish mother breaks down in tears at her son's hospital bedside and begs for help to get him home after he was critically injured in Thailand motorcycle crash\n\nKeen fly fisher Charles enlists the telescopic sights on his security guards' rifles to help him locate salmon\n\nNight William and Charles tore down house of York - and Andrew's final humiliation: How he was ejected at midnight from his house, Fergie smuggled out and the new 'body blow' for Eugenie and Beatrice revealed\n\nFrom the Russians to the Americans, and from our own spies to the Civil Service, everyone knew the truth about Mandelson - everyone, that is, except Keir Starmer: DAN HODGES\n\nTALK OF THE TOWN: William and Kate slope off for a ski break in the French Alps\n\nJustin Trudeau's ex-wife opens up about lonely 'uncoupled' Valentine's Day as former Canadian PM moves on with Katy Perry\n\nBowel cancer is surging in young people in Britain - but not in other parts of Europe.

Email tips@dailymail.co.uk\nBy CHLOE LOUISE, SHOWBUSINESS REPORTER\n Published:01:52 GMT, 8 February 2026 |Updated:02:01 GMT, 8 February 2026 \n\nA finalist on The 1% Club lost out on an incredible £98,000 jackpot after a tricky picture question - but can you solve it?\nHosted by Lee Mack, the popular ITV game show challenges players' common sense and logic rather than their general knowledge.\nContestants who reach the end tackle the toughest question - which only 1% of the public is expected to get right - in a bid to win a life-changing sum.\nIn the latest episode, contestant Liz was the only person to qualify for the final round.\nBut when asked if she wanted to play for the jackpot or leave with £10,000, she turned to the audience for advice.\nLeaving showhost Lee in shock, he explained that 'it was the first time anyone had done that.'\n\nA finalist on The 1% Club lost out on an incredible £98,000 jackpot after a tricky picture question - but can you solve it?\n\nHosted by Lee Mack, the popular ITV game show challenges players' common sense and logic rather than their general knowledge\nHe then asked the audience by getting them to cheer if she should play and then clap if she shouldn't.\nShe decided to take home the £10,000 rather than play for the difficult question, as she explained that the night before, she had a dream she lost a lot of money.\nAs per game rules, Lee awarded her the £10,000 but presented her with the final question.\nLee asked: 'If you can roll six different numbers using one standard dice, how many different totals can you make by rolling three identical standard dice?'\nShe confessed that her answer would have been 180, but Lee revealed the answer was, in fact, 16.\nITV viewers flocked to X to share their reactions as they watched the show, as one person wrote: 'Well played, Liz. Respect for making the correct decision. #The1PercentClub.'\n'This woman who had that dream must be psychic #The1PercentClub.'; 'Omg Liz! Hope your dreams come true, well, the opposite of the actual end #The1PercentClub.''Her dream is coming true #The1PercentClub.'\nElsewhere, a previous episode's final picture question left fans baffled after the latest episode of the ITV quiz show - thanks to a very hidden detail.\n\nIn the latest episode, contestant Liz was the only person to qualify for the final round. But when asked if she wanted to play for the jackpot or leave with £10,000, she took the smaller offer\n\nAs per game rules, Lee awarded her the £10,000 but presented her with the final question\n\nShe confessed that her answer would have been 180, but Lee revealed the answer was, in fact, 16\nShow viewers were left confused in the comments as the TV show's social media account posted an image of the tricky conundrum over the weekend.\nThe question read: 'If you take away all the flags that have stars, circles, red crosses, black stripes, and the colour green, which one is left?'\nThese flags, labelled from A-I, were displayed as: A) Algeria, B) Trinidad and Tobago, C) United Kingdom, D) Scotland, E) Aland in Finland, F) Bangladesh, G) Japan, H) Senegal, and I) Tanzania.\n\n The 1% Club's picture question wipes out 17 players - but can YOU solve it within 30 seconds? \nWhile appearing straightforward, there's only one flag that fulfils the requirements, meaning fans who narrowed it down to two options already got the answer wrong.\nHowever, it didn't stop viewers from arguing that the ambiguous nature of the question's wording could mean multiple flags meet the criteria.\nViewers noted that the question asked for flags that don't feature 'stars, circles, red crosses, black stripes AND the colour green' - so using the word 'and' and not 'or' would mean that all the flags qualify, given none of them have all the listed features.\nReplying in the thread on X, formerly Twitter, one show fan penned: 'All of them because none of them have stars, circles, red crosses, black stripes and the colour green...'\nAnother chimed in: 'None of these flags has stars, circles, red crosses, black stripes, and the colour green. In fact, Scotland (D) doesn't have any of those!'\nThe 1% Club airs on ITV1 and is available to stream on ITVX.\nITVLee Mack\n\nShare or comment on this article: \nThe 1% Club player misses out on a whopping £98k jackpot after settling for £10k jackpot - but can YOU defy the odds and solve it?\n\nAdd comment\n\n Share what you think\n\nNo comments have so far been submitted.

Flanked by her siblings, Camron and Annie, Guthrie directly addressed the individuals believed to be holding their mother, who was reportedly abducted from her Tucson home one week ago. \"We received your message, and we understand,\" Guthrie said in the video. \"This is very valuable to us and we will pay,\" she added. Savannah Guthrie Makes Direct Appeal to Captors The video plea marks a shift in the family's strategy as the investigation enters its second week. Guthrie's statement appeared to be a response to a specific message received by the Tucson television station KOLD on Friday. While the FBI is currently reviewing the authenticity of that email, Guthrie used the public platform to signal the family's compliance with the captors' terms. Nancy Guthrie Investigation: Viral Drone Video Shows FBI Pulling Wired Device From Savannah Guthrie’s Mother’s Roof in Arizona; President Donald Trump Says ‘A Lot Has Taken Place’. We Beg You Now To Return Our Mother to Us, Says Savannah Guthrie View this post on Instagram A post shared by Savannah Guthrie (@savannahguthrie) \"We beg you now to return our mother to us so that we can celebrate with her. This is the only way that we can have peace,\" Guthrie stated, her voice steady but emotional. This follows a series of unverified ransom notes sent to various media outlets earlier in the week, some of which demanded millions of dollars in Bitcoin and established deadlines for payment. Evidence of Forced Removal Nancy Guthrie was last seen on the evening of January 31, when she was dropped off at her residence in the Catalina Foothills after a family dinner. Concerns escalated the following morning when she failed to appear at her local church. Pima County Sheriff Chris Nanos confirmed earlier this week that DNA tests on blood found on the front porch of the home matched Nancy Guthrie. Investigators also revealed that the home's doorbell camera was manually disconnected at approximately 1:47 AM on Sunday morning, and her pacemaker app was disconnected from her phone shortly thereafter at 2:28 AM. Critical Health Concerns of Nancy Guthrie The urgency of the situation is heightened by Nancy Guthrie's medical needs. Family members have stressed that she is a \"vulnerable adult\" with limited mobility who requires daily medication for a heart condition. \"If she is alive right now, her meds are vital,\" Sheriff Nanos warned in a press briefing. \"It has been more than a week, and the family tells us if she doesn't have those meds, it can become fatal,\" the Sheriff added.

FBI Involvement and Arrests The FBI has taken a lead role in the case, offering a USD 50,000 reward for information leading to Nancy’s recovery. While law enforcement has processed the home as a crime scene, they have not yet officially identified a suspect or person of interest. The investigation has been complicated by \"imposter\" activity; authorities recently arrested a 40-year-old man, Derrick Callella, for allegedly sending a fake ransom demand to the family in an attempt to profit from the crisis. The FBI continues to vet all incoming communications to distinguish between legitimate demands and hoaxes.","summary":"Recently, Savannah Guthrie issued a video plea agreeing to pay a ransom for her mother, Nancy Guthrie, who has been missing for one week.

But India offers no such confirmation","text":"India and the United States are embroiled in a nuanced standoff over Russian oil after Washington again suggested that New Delhi has agreed to stop buying Moscow’s crude. But officials in Delhi have not confirmed any such commitment.\nThe issue has surfaced amid a broader India-US interim trade agreement that cuts punitive tariffs and seeks to reset strained economic ties.\nUnder an executive order issued by US President Donald Trump that formed part of the tariff reduction announcement, the White House said India had “committed to stop directly or indirectly importing Russian Federation oil” and represented that it would “purchase United States energy products from the United States,” as well as expand defence cooperation over the next decade.\nBut in New Delhi on Saturday, Union commerce minister Piyush Goyal offered no clear confirmation that India will halt purchases of Russian oil. When asked whether the country will stop importing oil from Moscow as the US claimed, he said the Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) would speak to that question.\nTariffs, trade and terminology\nThe White House order eliminated a 25 percent punitive tariff that had been imposed on Indian goods because of oil purchases from Russia. The overall duty on Indian exports had reached as high as 50 percent when combined with a reciprocal tariff imposed earlier. Under the interim framework, the US will apply an 18 percent tariff on Indian products, with the possibility of reducing it further.\nThe executive order also states that Washington may reimpose the punitive tariff “if the (US) Secretary of Commerce finds that India has resumed directly or indirectly importing Russian Federation oil.” However, the joint statement on the trade deal itself does not explicitly mention Russia; it focuses instead on broader trade commitments, including India’s intention to buy more US energy products.\nIndia sides with energy security\nAt a press briefing earlier this week, the MEA stressed that ensuring the energy security of India’s 1.4 billion people is the government’s top priority. A spokesperson said New Delhi’s energy sourcing decisions are guided by “objective market conditions and evolving international dynamics,” and reiterated that diversification — not abrupt policy shifts — drives oil purchases.\nOpposition leaders, meanwhile, have been critical, arguing that the current framework is skewed in favour of the United States and that key details remain opaque.","url":"https://www.firstpost.com/india/us-claims-india-will-ditch-russian-oil-but-india-offers-no-such-confirmation-13977379.html","image":"https://images.firstpost.com/uploads/2026/02/The-battle-for-Kyiv-2026-02-08T071650.339-2026-02-f1ed601e450549f24048694e845d39b4-1200x675.jpg?im=FitAndFill=(1200,675)","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-02-08 01:48:28","author":null,"language":"en","source_country":"in","sentiment":-0.126},{"id":400501576,"title":"Japan&#039;s Takaichi aims for blizzard of votes in rare winter election","text":"TOKYO, Feb 8 (Reuters) - Japanese voters were casting ballots on Sunday in an election expected to hand Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi a resounding win, although record snowfall blanketing parts of the country could keep some voters at home. The conservative coalition of Takaichi, the nation's first female leader, is predicted to win around 300 of the 465 seats in the lower house of parliament, according to multiple opinion polls, a large gain from the 233 it is defending. If the coalition of Takaichi's Liberal Democratic Party with the Japan Innovation Party, known as Ishin, wins 310 seats, it would be able to override the upper chamber, where it does not have a majority. She has vowed to step down if the coalition loses its majority. TAKAICHI RIDES 'SANAKATSU' WAVE AMONG YOUNG VOTERS Takaichi, 64, who became prime minister in October after being selected LDP leader, sought a mandate from voters in a rare winter election as she rides a wave of popularity. With a straight-talking style and an image as a hard worker that have won her support, especially with younger voters, Takaichi has accelerated military spending to counter China and pushed for a sales-tax cut that has rattled financial markets. \"If Takaichi wins big, she will have more political room to follow through on key commitments, including on consumption-tax cuts,\" said Seiji Inada, managing director at FGS Global, a consultancy. \"Markets could react in the following days, and the yen could come under renewed pressure.\" She has promised to suspend the 8% sales tax on food for two years to help households cope with rising prices, partly driven by the yen's sharp fall. Takaichi has generated a social media-led wave, mostly among younger voters, of a Sanae-mania called \"sanakatsu\" for products she uses, such as her handbag and the pink pen she scribbles notes with in parliament. A recent opinion poll found voters under 30 favouring her by more than 90%. That young cohort, however, is less likely to vote than the older generations that have long been the bedrock of LDP support. On Thursday, Takaichi received the endorsement of U.S. President Donald Trump, a signal that may appeal to right-leaning voters but could also put off some moderates. WHITEOUT COULD BOOST ORGANISED VOTING BLOCS With up to 70 cm (28 inches) of snow forecast in northern and eastern regions on Sunday, some voters will have to battle blizzards to pass their verdict on her administration. It is only the third postwar election held in February, with elections typically called during milder months. Even the capital Tokyo was given a rare dusting of snow, causing some minor traffic disruptions. Nationwide, 37 train lines and 58 ferry routes were halted and 54 flights cancelled as of Sunday morning, according to the transport ministry. In Nagaoka in the rural northern prefecture of Niigata, where snow was piled more than 1 metre (3 feet) high along the roadsides on Saturday, campaigners urged people to vote early to avoid expected snow storms. \"It's bad enough here in the towns, but in the mountains there's twice as much snow. It's hard just to leave the house,\" said Takehiko Igarashi, a volunteer for the Japanese Communist Party, which he said was calling up supporters and offering to drive them to polling stations. Turnout in recent lower house elections has hovered around the mid-50% range. Any slump on Sunday could amplify the influence of organised voting blocs. One of those is Komeito, which last year quit its coalition with the LDP and has merged into a centrist group with the main opposition Constitutional Democratic Party of Japan. Komeito has close ties to the lay-Buddhist Soka Gakkai group, which claims at least 8 million members nationwide. Voters will pick lawmakers in 289 single-seat constituencies, with the rest decided by proportional-representation votes for parties. Polls close at 8 p.m. (1100 GMT), when broadcasters are expected to issue projections based on their exit polls.

Trump and Netanyahu last met in December. There was no immediate White House comment. The U.S. and the Islamic Republic of Iran held indirect talks on Friday in Oman that appeared to return to the starting point on how to approach discussions over Tehran’s nuclear program. Trump called the talks “very good” and said more were planned for early next week. Washington was represented by Middle East special envoy Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner, Trump’s son-in-law. Trump has repeatedly threatened to use force to compel Iran to reach a deal on its nuclear program after sending the aircraft carrier USS Abraham Lincoln and other warships to the region amid Tehran’s crackdown on nationwide protests that killed thousands. Gulf Arab nations fear an attack could spark a regional war, with memories fresh of the 12-day Israel-Iran war in June. For the first time in negotiations with Iran, the U.S. on Friday brought its top military commander in the Middle East to the table. U.S. Navy Adm. Brad Cooper, head of the military’s Central Command, then visited the USS Abraham Lincoln on Saturday with Witkoff and Kushner, the command said in a statement. Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi told journalists Friday that “nuclear talks and the resolution of the main issues must take place in a calm atmosphere, without tension and without threats.” He said that diplomats would return to their capitals, signaling that this round of negotiations was over. On Saturday, Araghchi told the Al Jazeera satellite news network that if the U.S. attacks Iran, his country doesn't have the ability to strike the U.S. “and therefore has to attack or retaliate against U.S. bases in the region.” He said there is “very, very deep distrust” after what happened during the previous talks, when the U.S. bombed Iranian nuclear sites during last year's Israel-Iran war. Tehran has maintained that these talks will be only on its nuclear program. However, Al Jazeera reported that diplomats from Egypt, Turkey and Qatar offered Iran a proposal in which Tehran would halt enrichment for three years, send its highly enriched uranium out of the country and pledge to “not initiate the use of ballistic missiles.” U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio said Wednesday that the talks needed to include all those issues. Israel, a close U.S. ally, believes Iran is pursuing a nuclear weapon and wants its program scrapped, though Iran has insisted that its atomic plans are for peaceful purposes. Israel also wants a halt to Iran's ballistic missile program and its support for militant groups in the region. Araghchi, speaking at a forum in Qatar on Saturday, accused Israel of destabilizing the region, saying that it “breaches sovereignties, it assassinates official dignitaries, it conducts terrorist operations, it expands its reach in multiple theaters.” He criticized Israel’s treatment of Palestinians and called for “comprehensive and targeted sanctions against Israel, including an immediate arms embargo.”","url":"https://www.deccanchronicle.com/world/netanyahu-to-meet-trump-as-us-iran-talks-resume-and-tensions-rise-1935770","image":"https://www.deccanchronicle.com/h-upload/2026/02/08/2007908-afp2025040739ff77uv1highresusisraelpoliticsdiplomacytrumpnetanyahu-e1744847322144-640x400.webp","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-02-08 01:36:34","author":null,"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"in","sentiment":-0.367},{"id":400502632,"title":"‘We will pay,’ Savannah Guthrie says in desperate video plea to potential kidnappers of her mother","text":"TUCSON, Ariz.

Diversifying our energy sourcing in keeping with objective market conditions and evolving international dynamics is at the core of our strategy to ensure this.

That young cohort, however, is less likely to vote than the older generations that have long been the bedrock of LDP support.\n\nOn Thursday, Takaichi received the endorsement of U.S. President Donald Trump, a signal that may appeal to right-leaning voters but could also put off some moderates.\n\nWHITEOUT COULD BOOST ORGANISED VOTING BLOCS\n\nWith up to 70 cm (28 inches) of snow forecast in northern and eastern regions on Sunday, some voters will have to battle blizzards to pass their verdict on her administration.

It's hard just to leave the house,\" said Takehiko Igarashi, a volunteer for the Japanese Communist Party, which he said was calling up supporters and offering to drive them to polling stations.\n\nTurnout in recent lower house elections has hovered around the mid-50% range.

That would be a significant jump from the razor-thin majority she now controls.\n\nIf the coalition snags 261 seats, dubbed an absolute stable majority, she can control parliamentary committees, easing the passage of legislation, including key budget proposals.\n\nA super-majority of 310 seats would allow her to override the upper house, where her coalition lacks a majority.\n\nIf the polls have it all wrong and she loses her lower house majority, Takaichi has said she will resign.\n\nFISCAL JEOPARDY\n\nTakaichi's election promise to help households cope with rising prices by suspending the 8% sales tax on food sparked a market selloff last month.\n\nInvestors baulked at the vagaries of how an economy with the heaviest debt burden in the developed world would pay for the estimated 5 trillion yen ($30 billion) hit to annual revenue.\n\nHer comments on how she will implement those plans will be pored over by those same investors that fled Japanese government bonds and sent the yen sinking into crisis mode.\n\nIf she sets off a market rout, Takaichi may not be able to count on the Bank of Japan's help to tame it, Reuters reported this week.\n\nSupport for Takaichi, 64, is strongest among younger voters, not the older generations that have long formed the LDP’s electoral backbone, polls show.\n\nHer modest background and nationalistic rhetoric have struck a chord with a disenchanted youth hopeful she can pull Japan out of a decades-long economic funk.\n\nA conservative who draws inspiration from Britain's Margaret Thatcher, Takaichi has harnessed the power of social media and become an unlikely fashion icon, with fans clamouring to buy the bag she carries and the pink pen she scribbles with.\n\nWhether younger Japanese bother going to polling stations on Sunday may determine the size of her expected win. In the October general election that preceded her rise to prime minister, just 36% of those aged 21 to 24 in the capital Tokyo voted, versus 71% of those aged 70 to 74.\n\nBEEF WITH BEIJING\n\nA resounding victory could hand Takaichi new clout in an escalating dispute with powerful neighbour China, current and former Japanese officials said, though Beijing has shown no signs of backing down.\n\nWeeks after taking office, Takaichi touched off the biggest dispute with China in over a decade by publicly outlining how Tokyo might respond to a Chinese attack on Taiwan.\n\nA strong mandate could also accelerate Takaichi's plans to bolster Japan's military, drawing more anger from Beijing, which has cast her endeavours as an attempt to revive Japan's militaristic past.\n\nFAR-RIGHT RISE\n\nFielding a record 190 candidates, the far-right Sanseito party could make gains, with polls suggesting it may win around 15 seats, up from just two.\n\nThat would build on last year’s upper house election, when the party broke through with fiery warnings about foreigners and attracted notable youth support.\n\nWhile Sanseito, which has sought ties with U.S. President Donald Trump's MAGA movement, will remain a small party, its emergence has helped shift the political discourse in Japan to the right, a trend seen in other advanced democracies.\n\nWEATHER WARNINGS\n\nAnother factor that could influence turnout is the weather in the first election since 1990 to be held in mid-winter.\n\nRecord snowfall has buried some parts of northern and western Japan and was even dusting the capital Tokyo on Sunday, causing minor traffic disruption. Some remote polling stations will close early so ballots can be transported to counting centres in time, public broadcaster NHK reported.\n\nTurnout in Japanese elections, which the LDP has dominated in the postwar era, is lower than in most other advanced democracies at around 55% in recent votes.

The AP said it contacted the FBI and the Pima County Sheriff’s Department for further details. A Tucson television station, KOLD, said it received an email linked to the case but did not disclose its contents. The FBI confirmed it was aware of a new message and was checking whether it was genuine.

Here are some key developments to watch: WINNING MARGIN Takaichi's Liberal Democratic Party and its coalition partner, the Japan Innovation Party, known as Ishin, could capture around 300 seats in the 465-seat lower house of parliament, polls last week showed. That would be a significant jump from the razor-thin majority she now controls. If the coalition snags 261 seats, dubbed an absolute stable majority, she can control parliamentary committees, easing the passage of legislation, including key budget proposals. A super-majority of 310 seats would allow her to override the upper house, where her coalition lacks a majority. If the polls have it all wrong and she loses her lower house majority, Takaichi has said she will resign. FISCAL JEOPARDY Takaichi's election promise to help households cope with rising prices by suspending the 8% sales tax on food sparked a market selloff last month. Investors baulked at the vagaries of how an economy with the heaviest debt burden in the developed world would pay for the estimated 5 trillion yen ($30 billion) hit to annual revenue. Her comments on how she will implement those plans will be pored over by those same investors that fled Japanese government bonds and sent the yen sinking into crisis mode. If she sets off a market rout, Takaichi may not be able to count on the Bank of Japan's help to tame it, Reuters reported this week. YOUTH VOTE Support for Takaichi, 64, is strongest among younger voters, not the older generations that have long formed the LDP's electoral backbone, polls show. Her modest background and nationalistic rhetoric have struck a chord with a disenchanted youth hopeful she can pull Japan out of a decades-long economic funk. A conservative who draws inspiration from Britain's Margaret Thatcher, Takaichi has harnessed the power of social media and become an unlikely fashion icon, with fans clamouring to buy the bag she carries and the pink pen she scribbles with. Whether younger Japanese bother going to polling stations on Sunday may determine the size of her expected win. In the October general election that preceded her rise to prime minister, just 36% of those aged 21 to 24 in the capital Tokyo voted, versus 71% of those aged 70 to 74. BEEF WITH BEIJING A resounding victory could hand Takaichi new clout in an escalating dispute with powerful neighbour China, current and former Japanese officials said, though Beijing has shown no signs of backing down. Weeks after taking office, Takaichi touched off the biggest dispute with China in over a decade by publicly outlining how Tokyo might respond to a Chinese attack on Taiwan. A strong mandate could also accelerate Takaichi's plans to bolster Japan's military, drawing more anger from Beijing, which has cast her endeavours as an attempt to revive Japan's militaristic past. FAR-RIGHT RISE Fielding a record 190 candidates, the far-right Sanseito party could make gains, with polls suggesting it may win around 15 seats, up from just two. That would build on last year's upper house election, when the party broke through with fiery warnings about foreigners and attracted notable youth support. While Sanseito, which has sought ties with U.S. President Donald Trump's MAGA movement, will remain a small party, its emergence has helped shift the political discourse in Japan to the right, a trend seen in other advanced democracies. WEATHER WARNINGS Another factor that could influence turnout is the weather in the first election since 1990 to be held in mid-winter. Record snowfall has buried some parts of northern and western Japan and was even dusting the capital Tokyo on Sunday, causing minor traffic disruption. Some remote polling stations will close early so ballots can be transported to counting centres in time, public broadcaster NHK reported. Turnout in Japanese elections, which the LDP has dominated in the postwar era, is lower than in most other advanced democracies at around 55% in recent votes.

However, the ruling party is also aiming for a result that could allow the LDP to secure a majority on its own.\nAlso Read | Gold Medalist Viral Video Scandal: Why Clicking This Zyan Cabrera Link Is Dangerous.\nIf the LDP wins at least 233 seats independently, it would mark a decisive victory for Takaichi, strengthening her authority and consolidating her power base in the Lower House. However, a failure by the LDP-JIP coalition to secure a combined majority could force Takaichi to step down as prime minister, potentially plunging Japan into another period of political instability, with four prime ministers in roughly three years, according to The Japan Times.\nPre-election media surveys indicated that the LDP was on track to secure a majority on its own, while the opposition Centrist Reform Alliance (CRA), a newly formed bloc of the Constitutional Democratic Party of Japan and Komeito, was expected to suffer significant losses.\nAlso Read | Donald Trump Aims To Hold First Meeting of His New 'Board of Peace' in Washington To Raise Money for Reconstruction of Gaza.\nPolls remained favourable to the LDP despite several controversies involving Takaichi, including remarks interpreted as endorsing a weaker yen, the party's unclear position on cutting the consumption tax on food, and unscripted comments related to the Japan-U.S. alliance, the report said.\nDuring the campaign, Takaichi pledged to increase government spending in key industries, revive Japan's global economic competitiveness and tighten immigration policies.\nFor the JIP, also known as Nippon Ishin no Kai, the election is seen as a test of its ability to expand beyond its traditional base in Osaka. The party has struggled to gain traction nationally in recent elections.\nUnlike the LDP's past arrangements with long-time coalition partner Komeito, the LDP and the JIP did not coordinate candidates in single-seat districts. In Osaka, the two parties are contesting all 19 single-member constituencies.\nThe JIP is also contending with simultaneous local races in Osaka, where Governor and party leader Hirofumi Yoshimura and Mayor Hideyuki Yokoyama are seeking voter support for a proposal to merge the city's wards into a metropolitan government. The initiative is central to the party's long-standing goal of making Osaka a backup capital for Japan, The Japan Times noted.\nOn the opposition side, the CRA fielded candidates in more than 200 single-seat districts but was projected to lose seats overall. The alliance has set its objective as becoming the largest force in the Lower House.\nThe CRA criticised Takaichi's decision to call a snap election with lawmakers only a third of the way through their four-year terms. It also cited recent market volatility as evidence of investor concerns over her fiscal policies, particularly proposals to cut the consumption tax on food, which unsettled bond markets.\nThe performance of smaller parties, including the Democratic Party for the People and Sanseito, is also being closely watched. Although there were rumours of potential cooperation with the ruling bloc, both parties mounted aggressive campaigns against Takaichi, the report said.\nThe campaign unfolded amid freezing temperatures and heavy snowfall in eastern and northern Japan, complicating outdoor campaigning. It marked the first time in 36 years that a Lower House election has been held during winter.\nA total of 465 seats, of which 289 are from single-seat districts and 176 through proportional representation, are being contested.

A top-secret complaint filed with the intelligence community's inspector general last May by an anonymous government official alleged that the U.S. spy chief's office sought to prevent the routine dissemination of certain classified intelligence for political reasons. Gabbard was appointed to her post by Republican President Donald Trump last year. A November letter from Andrew Bakaj, the whistleblower's lawyer, to Gabbard's office, which was also shared with the House of Representatives and Senate intelligence committees, alleged that Gabbard had hindered the dissemination of the May complaint to lawmakers by failing to provide necessary security guidance on how to handle it. Democrats such as Senator Mark Warner, the vice chair of the Senate Intelligence Committee, have said that Gabbard's agency, the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, was required under law to relay the May complaint to Congress within 21 days rather than waiting until February. In a social media post on Saturday, Gabbard accused Democrats of spreading a \"blatant lie.\" Successive inspectors general spanning the presidencies of Trump and his Democratic predecessor Joe Biden did not find the complaint to be credible, Gabbard wrote on X. The 21-day requirement \"only applies when a complaint is determined by the Inspector General to be both urgent AND apparently credible,\" Gabbard wrote. Reuters could not verify the contents of the original complaint. The Guardian newspaper and the New York Times have reported that it was related to the handling of an intelligence intercept related to someone close to Trump. Gabbard also wrote that she previously had not been informed by the inspector generals that the whistleblower had \"chosen to send the complaint to Congress, which would require me to issue security instructions.\" Gabbard wrote that once made aware of the need to provide security guidance to share the complaint with lawmakers on December 4, she took \"immediate action\" to do so.

Jones wrote in the 2-1 majority opinion that the government correctly interpreted the Immigration and Nationality Act by asserting that “unadmitted aliens apprehended anywhere in the United States are ineligible for release on bond, regardless of how long they have resided inside the United States.\"Under past administrations, most noncitizens with no criminal record who were arrested away from the border had an opportunity to request a bond hearing while their cases wound through immigration court. Historically, bond was often granted to those without criminal convictions who were not flight risks, and mandatory detention was limited to recent border crossers..preferred-source-banner{ margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom:10px;}\"That prior Administrations decided to use less than their full enforcement authority under\" the law “does not mean they lacked the authority to do more,” Jones wrote.The plaintiffs in the two separate cases filed last year against the Trump administration were both Mexican nationals who had both lived in the United States for over 10 years and weren't flight risks, their attorneys argued. Neither man had a criminal record, and both were jailed for months last year before a lower Texas court granted them bond in October.The Trump White House reversed that policy in favor of mandatory detention in July, reversing almost 30 years of precedent under both Democrat and Republican administrations.Friday's ruling also bucks a November district court decision in California, which granted detained immigrants with no criminal history the opportunity to request a bond hearing and had implications for noncitizens held in detention nationwide.Circuit Judge Dana M. Douglas wrote the lone dissent in Friday's decision.The elected congress members who passed the Immigration and Nationality Act “would be surprised to learn it had also required the detention without bond of two million people,” Douglas wrote, adding that many of the people detained are “the spouses, mothers, fathers, and grandparents of American citizens.”She went on to argue that the federal government was overriding the lawmaking process with DHS' new immigration detention policy that denies detained immigrants bond.“Because I would reject the government’s invitation to rubber stamp its proposed legislation by executive fiat, I dissent,” Douglas wrote.Douglas' opinion echoed widespread tensions between the Trump administration and federal judges around the country, who have increasingly accused the administration of flouting court orders.U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi celebrated the decision as “a significant blow against activist judges who have been undermining our efforts to make America safe again at every turn.\"“We will continue vindicating President Trump’s law and order agenda in courtrooms across the country,” Bondi wrote on the social media platform X.- EndsPublished By: Nitish SinghPublished On: Feb 8, 2026Tune InMust Watch","url":"https://www.indiatoday.in/world/story/president-trumps-administration-detaining-immigrants-without-bond-valid-appeals-court-rules-2864845-2026-02-08","image":"https://akm-img-a-in.tosshub.com/indiatoday/images/story/202602/the-seal-of-the-us-department-of-homeland-security-06101482-16x9.png?VersionId=30.rVQ6ryu1jtrGMQrN7aFp7kWE0k.dE?size=1280:720","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-02-08 01:23:21","author":"Associated Press","authors":["Associated Press"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"in","sentiment":-0.007},{"id":400498862,"title":"‘We will pay,’ Savannah Guthrie says in desperate video plea to potential kidnappers of her mother","text":"TUCSON, Ariz. — Savannah Guthrie told the potential kidnappers of her mother Nancy Guthrie on Saturday that the family is prepared to pay for her safe return, as the frantic search for the 84-year-old Arizona resident has entered a seventh day.\n\n“We received your message, and we understand.

It also agreed to grant access to distillers’ dried grains and red sorghum used in animal feed.\n\nAdditionally, the Modi government has committed to addressing longstanding non-tariff barriers that have constrained US farm exports. India will also cut or eliminate existing tariffs on a range of US industrial goods (organic and inorganic chemicals), medical devices (pacemakers, diagnostic machines, imaging apparatus & hearing aid systems), high-end cars and bikes, and electronic devices, among others. \n\nWashington, in turn, signalled concessions through expanded market access for certain Indian goods and a willingness to ease trade frictions, reflecting a reciprocal effort to advance a limited deal even as negotiations towards a broader agreement continue.\n\nAlmost half of India’s $87-billion exports to the US have been subjected to a 50 per cent tariff since August 7 last year after US President Donald Trump doubled the reciprocal tariffs to punish India for buying Russian oil. With an executive order on Saturday morning (IST), the US removed the 25 per cent penal tariff linked to Russian oil with immediate effect.\n\nAnother executive order is expected next week, bringing down the reciprocal tariff to 18 per cent, commerce and industry minister Piyush Goyal said.\n\nGoyal hailed the deal, which he claimed had opened up a $30-trillion market for Indian businesses. According to the minister, $44 billion worth of goods would have zero-duty access to the US. In contrast, around $26 billion worth of imports from the US are going to have greater market access to India, he added.\n\nHe defended the selective opening up of the economy, describing the measure as a “calibrated” one that took into account the interests of Indian MSMEs, farmers, consumers and industry.\n\n“We have not given any concession on wheat, rice, dairy, poultry, meat, maize, millet, sugar, soybean,” Goyal said.\n\nThe concession on apples, grown largely in Himachal Pradesh and Kashmir, will be quota-based and subject to a minimum import price of ₹100 per kg.\n\n“There is no competition between the US, which has a per capita income of $90,000, and India, with $3,000 per capita income. There are complementarities,” he added.\n\nYet the calibrated give-and-take risks stirring unease at home. Cheaper imports could compress margins for domestic oilseed processors and feed producers while exposing farmers to sharper price competition.\n\nThink tank Global Trade Research Initiative (GTRI) argued that most of the concessions had come from India.\n\n“India’s interim trade deal with the US offers some relief on tariffs, but a closer reading suggests an uneven exchange,” GTRI founder Ajay Srivastava said, adding the US had traded relief from its “unsustainable and illegal reciprocal tariffs” for “permanent market access gains” in India. He also argued that Indian farmers and industry would be hurt.\n\nThe joint statement skirted the Section 232 tariff imposed by the US on certain steel and aluminium products.\n\nWider commitments\n\nAccording to the joint statement, India intends to purchase $500 billion of US energy products, aircraft and aircraft parts, precious metals, technology products and coking coal over the next five years.\n\nBoth sides also agreed to strengthen their economic security alignment to enhance supply chain resilience and innovation through complementary actions to address non-market policies of third parties. Additionally, the US and India agreed to address discriminatory or burdensome practices and other barriers to digital trade.\n\nCommenting on the import commitments, which can potentially reverse the balance of trade in favour of the US, Goyal said it would be up to Indian industry, and not the government, to import.\n\nGulzar Didwania, partner, Deloitte India, said it would be “interesting” to see how India realised its intention of purchasing goods worth $500 billion over five years.\n\nThe GTRI’s Srivastava said the target appeared “unrealistic” as it would require more than doubling India’s $45-billion import from the US.\n\n“Taken together, the US has secured far-reaching commitments from India on agriculture, regulation, digital policy, security alignment, and large-scale purchasing — concessions that go well beyond trade,” Srivastava said.","url":"https://telegraphindia.com/business/modi-government-touts-give-take-tariff-deal-defends-opening-up-of-indias-economy-to-us-prnt/cid/2146332","image":"https://assets.telegraphindia.com/telegraph/2025/Jul/1753768320_india-us.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-02-08 01:20:55","author":"Sambit Saha","authors":["Sambit Saha"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"in","sentiment":-0.111},{"id":400501178,"title":"'We beg you': US journalist Savannah Guthrie agrees to pay ransom to mother’s kidnappers in new video","text":"NBC Today show co-anchor Savannah Guthrie has made a public, emotional appeal to the potential kidnappers of her elderly mother in a video. In the short clip, Guthrie appears alongside her siblings, asking for proof that their mother is alive. “We will pay,” Guthrie says, adding that the family is willing to do whatever it takes to ensure her safe return. The video, shared widely online, has intensified public attention around the case.\nGuthrie’s mother, Nancy Guthrie, 84, disappeared from her home in Tucson, Arizona, last month. Authorities say she was last seen on January 31, and her disappearance is being investigated as a suspected kidnapping. According to law enforcement, blood droplets later confirmed to be hers were found on the front porch of her home, while security cameras at the property had been disabled shortly before she vanished.\nThe family said they have received messages they believe may be linked to the abduction, though investigators have not publicly confirmed their authenticity.\nView this post on Instagram\nA post shared by Savannah Guthrie (@savannahguthrie)\nFederal and local agencies, including the FBI and the Pima County Sheriff’s Department, are jointly handling the investigation. Officials have released few details, citing the sensitivity of the case, but have encouraged anyone with credible information to come forward.\nThe case has drawn nationwide attention, in part because of Savannah Guthrie’s high profile as one of America’s best-known television journalists. But it has also sparked broader concern about the safety of elderly people living alone and the vulnerabilities they face.\nPresident Donald Trump has weighed in publicly, saying investigators have “strong clues and answers coming up soon,” though he did not elaborate on what those clues might be.\nFor now, the Guthrie family says its focus remains firmly on bringing Nancy home.","url":"https://www.firstpost.com/world/we-beg-you-now-to-return-our-mother-to-us-us-journalist-savannah-guthrie-issues-new-video-agreeing-to-pay-ransom-to-her-mothers-kidnappers-13977376.html","image":"https://images.firstpost.com/uploads/2026/02/The-battle-for-Kyiv-2026-02-05T113618.998-2026-02-00efaf8c8553a7df8f203142ac551426-1200x675.jpg?im=FitAndFill=(1200,675)","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-02-08 01:18:47","author":null,"language":"en","source_country":"in","sentiment":-0.073},{"id":400496424,"title":"‘Not the biggest fan’: American skier’s USA flag comment sparks Winter Olympics furore","text":"USA freestyle skier Hunter Hess caused a stir when he told reporters that wearing the American flag on his uniform does not mean he supports events “going on” in his home country.\n\n“It brings up mixed emotions to represent the US right now,” Hess said at a press conference before competition got underway in Italy.\n\n“It’s a little hard.

State media did not immediately specify a date or release agenda details.\n\nThe congress will likely continue for days as a highly choreographed display of Kim’s authoritarian leadership. In recent weeks, Kim has inspected weapons tests and toured military sites and economic projects as state media highlighted his purported achievements, crediting his “immortal leadership” with strengthening the country’s military capabilities and advancing national development.\n\nHis recent activities and comments suggest Kim will use the congress to double down on economic development through “self-sustenance” and mass mobilization while announcing plans to further expand the capabilities of his nuclear-armed military, including upgrading conventional weapons systems and integrating them with nuclear forces.\n\nKim also could highlight his increasingly assertive foreign policy based on closer ties with Moscow and Beijing while hardening an adversarial approach toward rival South Korea as he continues to embrace the idea of a “new Cold War,” experts say.\n\nKim’s willingness to resume diplomacy with the U.S. is unclear. Relations derailed in 2019 after his second summit with U.S. President Donald Trump due to disagreements over sanctions against his nuclear weapons program.\n\nKim has rejected Trump’s overtures for dialogue since the U.S. president began his second term in January 2025. Kim insists Washington abandon demands for the North to surrender its nuclear weapons as a precondition for future talks.\n\nEntering his 15th year in rule, Kim finds himself in a stronger position than when he opened the previous congress in 2021 during the shock of the COVID-19 pandemic. Navigating what was seen as his toughest stretch in a decade of power, Kim acknowledged his previous economic policies failed and issued a new five-year development plan through 2025.\n\nHe called for accelerated development of his nuclear arsenal and issued an extensive wish list of sophisticated assets including solid-fuel intercontinental ballistic missiles, multi-warhead systems, tactical nuclear weapons, spy satellites and nuclear-powered submarines.\n\nKim has exploited geopolitical turmoil to his advantage. He used Russia’s invasion of Ukraine as a window to accelerate weapons testing and align himself with Russian President Vladimir Putin, who has accepted thousands of North Korean troops and large quantities of military equipment for the war. \n\nKim also has pursued closer ties with China, traditionally the North’s primary ally and economic lifeline. He traveled to Beijing in September for a World War II event and the first summit with Chinese President Xi Jinping in six years.\n\nWhile Kim’s strict information blockade prevents precise assessments, South Korean analysts say the North’s economy appears to have improved over the past five years, possibly due to a gradual recovery in trade with China and an industrial boost from arms exports to Russia.","url":"https://apnews.com/article/north-korea-workers-party-congress-kim-nuclear-a411f6429dcbfc720257b5023f3b78d1","image":"https://dims.apnews.com/dims4/default/18cfc8b/2147483647/strip/false/crop/5000x3333+0+0/resize/980x653!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fassets.apnews.com%2F57%2F47%2F6b79af8aa18f5bb3c13b7b6d954d%2F7825a763a46a4fa4a38252d78c148d67","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-02-08 01:17:15","author":"Kim Tong-Hyung","authors":["Kim Tong-Hyung"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.13},{"id":400497990,"title":"“That’s my man”: J Balvin fuels Super Bowl buzz backing Bad Bunny while rumors swirl about his secret guest appearance","text":"The Bad Bunny Super Bowl halftime show has become one of the most debated entertainment decisions in recent NFL history, and it will finally unfold on Sunday in Santa Clara. The league’s choice to hand the Super Bowl LX stage to the Puerto Rican superstar has stirred excitement, anger, and political noise in equal measure, weeks before a single note is played.Bad Bunny, born Benito Antonio Martínez Ocasio, will perform as the Seattle Seahawks face the New England Patriots, carrying the weight of cultural expectation along with the spotlight. Much of the backlash centers on language and politics, but close friend and global hitmaker J Balvin believes the controversy misses the point of music itself.J Balvin fires back at critics questioning Bad Bunny’s all-Spanish Super Bowl showJ Balvin has been clear about why English-speaking audiences do not need translation to feel Bad Bunny’s performance. Speaking to TMZ, the Colombian singer framed the issue through his own experience as a young listener discovering hip-hop.“I learned and grew up listening to hip-hop,” Balvin said. “I didn’t know what they were saying. I would just vibe with it.”For Balvin, rhythm and emotion come before lyrics. “They just gotta jump on the flavor, that’s all they gotta do,” he added. “That’s followers.” His comments underline a broader idea the NFL appears to be embracing: the Super Bowl is no longer just an American event but a global one, shaped by sounds and cultures that travel beyond borders.The resistance, however, has been loud. President Donald Trump has been among the most vocal critics, while Hall of Fame running back Eric Dickerson questioned the NFL’s decision to look outside the local music scene. “Why can't we get somebody from right here, from home?” Dickerson asked. “I don't see why they chose that.” He also raised doubts about how a Spanish-language performance would land with a national audience.On being asked his favorite Bad Bunny song, Balvin said,\"“All of them!” he said. That’s my man.”Bad Bunny has not softened his stance amid the criticism. He recently renewed his condemnation of ICE during his Grammy speech, continuing a pattern of speaking openly about issues that matter to him. The pressure has been intense. Days before the show, he admitted the buildup has been exhausting. “Thinking about the Super Bowl at 4am, that's what I've been doing,” he said. “Last night I couldn't sleep, I was thinking about it.”Still, his focus remains on the moment itself. “I want to think it's 13 minutes of doing what I love,” Bad Bunny said. “I know I'm gonna have fun.”Get the latest ICC Men’s T20 World Cup 2026 updates, including the full schedule, teams, live scores, points table, and key series stats such as top run-scorers and wicket-takers.","url":"https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/thats-my-man-j-balvin-fuels-super-bowl-buzz-backing-bad-bunny-while-rumors-swirl-about-his-secret-guest-appearance/articleshow/128054599.cms","image":"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/resizemode-4,width-1280,height-720,msid-128054708/128054708.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-02-08 01:17:00","author":"Prantik Prabal Roy","authors":["Prantik Prabal Roy"],"language":"en","category":"entertainment","source_country":"in","sentiment":0.073},{"id":400502388,"title":"Timothée Chalamet fans left shocked after discovering who his uncle is... as 'nepo baby' dominates awards season","text":"SHARE SELECTION\n\nUK Celebrity News\n\nSubscribe Now\n\nKim Kardashian\nVictoria Beckham\nHarry Styles\nAmanda Holden\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEpstein took 'very cute' young Romanian model to private dinner at Buckingham Palace for Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor\n\nDitch Starmer for a caretaker leader, Labour MPs say... as insiders claim PM's closest aide McSweeney is on brink of quitting\n\nExplore the Epstein Files at the touch of a button: Read all the most explosive allegations, emails and pictures in the Mail's interactive Deep Dive\n\nBritish mother breaks down in tears at her son's hospital bedside and begs for help to get him home after he was critically injured in Thailand motorcycle crash\n\nKeen fly fisher Charles enlists the telescopic sights on his security guards' rifles to help him locate salmon\n\nNight William and Charles tore down house of York - and Andrew's final humiliation: How he was ejected at midnight from his house, Fergie smuggled out and the new 'body blow' for Eugenie and Beatrice revealed\n\nFrom the Russians to the Americans, and from our own spies to the Civil Service, everyone knew the truth about Mandelson - everyone, that is, except Keir Starmer: DAN HODGES\n\nTALK OF THE TOWN: William and Kate slope off for a ski break in the French Alps\n\nJustin Trudeau's ex-wife opens up about lonely 'uncoupled' Valentine's Day as former Canadian PM moves on with Katy Perry\n\nBowel cancer is surging in young people in Britain - but not in other parts of Europe.

I’m so happy. I’m so proud.'\n\nHer résumé is nothing short of remarkable. \nAs a child, she danced at Lincoln Center with the New York City Ballet, performed in multiple Broadway musicals, and now serves as an officer of the Actors’ Equity Association, representing over 50,000 stage actors. \nShe also votes for the Tony Awards and authored Cool Careers for People Who Love Movement.\nWith Marty Supreme sweeping the awards circuit and his family legacy now in full view, it seems Chalamet’s Hollywood roots run deeper than many fans realized - a true nepo baby story, but one backed by undeniable talent.\n\nShare or comment on this article: \nTimothée Chalamet fans left shocked after discovering who his uncle is... as 'nepo baby' dominates awards season\n\nAdd comment\n\nComments (233)\n\nComments are subject to our House rules and Terms\n\nLog in to comment\n\nWorst rated\n\nPPlutoFreeTVfan, NewYork, United States, 6 minutes ago\n\nAre you sure you want to delete this comment?\n\nHe’s a talented actor by his own standards.

More than 120 million Americans are expected to tune in for an annual pop culture nonpareil, which this year features two teams nobody expected to reach the NFL championship decider. The Seahawks, boasting the league's best defense, are the marginal favorites. But they come up against a Patriots team who know how to win. New England is seeking a record seventh Lombardi Trophy, and its first since the departure of Tom Brady, widely considered the NFL's greatest ever player. It is, according to bookmakers, the unlikeliest Super Bowl match-up of modern times. Both teams began the season with odds of 60-1 or worse to go all the way. Bad Bunny has pledged Puerto Rican culture will feature in his Super Bowl LX half-time performance, but further details are under wraps (768x511, AR: 1.50)Away from the sporting contest, all eyes will be on a historic half-time performance from Bad Bunny, the Grammy-winning Puerto Rican superstar. He is expected to deliver the first-ever Super Bowl set sung entirely in Spanish. One of the world's biggest artists, Bad Bunny has been a vocal critic of Donald Trump's immigration crackdown. Speculation is high that he could use the giant Super Bowl platform to double down. The US president has claimed the performance will \"sow hatred\" and is not attending this year's game. The Super Bowl kicks off at 3:30pm local time (2330 GMT) at the 75,000-capacity Levi's Stadium in Santa Clara, California. - 'Evil Empire' - Journeyman quarterback Sam Darnold passed through four NFL clubs before a superb debut year in Seattle (768x512, AR: 1.50)A franchise once so dominant they were dubbed the \"Evil Empire,\" New England have floundered since Brady left in 2020, but they have been reborn this season under coach of the year Mike Vrabel. Rising star quarterback Drake Maye led the resurgent Patriots to a league-best 17 wins, including playoffs. At 23 he would be the youngest starting quarterback to win football's biggest prize, and this week missed out on being named the season's Most Valuable Player by a single vote. Super Bowl LX takes place at the 75,000-capacity Levi's Stadium in Santa Clara, California (768x550, AR: 1.40)Maye is a prodigious ball-carrying runner who is also the league's best at throwing long-range passes. But the young phenom also gets sacked more than almost any other quarterback. And Maye comes up against a Seattle defense that loves to swarm the opposing signal-caller and has yielded the fewest points in the league. The Seahawks have just one Super Bowl in their trophy cabinet, and their most recent appearance came in a 2015 loss to Brady's Patriots. For Seattle to get revenge in Sunday's rematch, quarterback Sam Darnold must shed his long-standing reputation for wilting under pressure. Journeyman Darnold passed through four NFL clubs before emerging revitalized with a superb debut year in Seattle. \"He's a resilient dude and a competitor. A winner,\" Seattle head coach Mike Macdonald told AFP. The Seahawks also boast wide receiver Jaxon Smith-Njigba, who was named the season's top offensive player. - 'Huge party' - A win Sunday would be a historic seventh for the Patriots, who are currently tied with the Pittsburgh Steelers for the most Super Bowl titles with six. NFL security chiefs scotched media reports that US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officers would have a role at the Super Bowl in Santa Clara, California (768x512, AR: 1.50)Some 90,000 fans have flocked to the Bay Area, which is expected to receive a $500 million economic boost from the sports bonanza. The game is being played out against the backdrop of Trump's divisive and brutal immigration crackdown. Anger has soared over the killing of two US citizens by federal agents in Minneapolis last month. NFL security chiefs this week scotched media reports that US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officers would have a role at the game. But politics may not be entirely absent. Bad Bunny used the Grammys stage last weekend to condemn ICE. Details of his Super Bowl set are under wraps, though Bad Bunny has pledged to showcase Puerto Rican culture in \"a huge party.\" amz/bb","url":"https://today.rtl.lu/news/world/super-bowl-set-for-patriots-seahawks-showdown-as-politics-swirl-706077652","image":"https://static-prod.rtl.lu/dims4/default/0b8b5cc/2147483647/strip/false/crop/768x518+0+0/resize/768x518!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Frtl-luxembourg-new-production-web.s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fa4%2F22%2F186d7cee52422af53343dec42e6d%2F","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-02-08 01:16:24","author":null,"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"lu","sentiment":0.084},{"id":400500264,"title":"Japan holds rare winter elections, PM Sanae Takaichi expected to win: What we know so far","text":"Japan voted on Sunday in an election expected to hand Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi a resounding win. Voters will pick lawmakers in 289 single-seat constituencies, with the rest decided by proportional-representation votes for parties.Polls close at 8 PM (1100 GMT), when broadcasters are expected to issue projections based on their exit polls.Takaichi's fateThe conservative coalition of Takaichi, the nation's first woman leader, could win more than 300 of the 465 seats in the lower house of parliament, according to multiple opinion polls, Reuters reported.If the coalition of Takaichi's Liberal Democratic Party with the Japan Innovation Party, known as Ishin, wins 310 seats, it would be able to override the opposition-controlled upper chamber.Takaichi vowed to step down if the coalition loses its majority.Takaichi, 64, became prime minister in October after being selected LDP leader.'If Takaichi wins big...'Takaichi sought a mandate from voters in a rare winter election as she rides a wave of popularity.She has accelerated military spending to counter China, which she sparked a diplomatic row with, and pushed economic stimulus and tax cuts that have rattled financial markets.\"If Takaichi wins big, she will have more political room to follow through on key commitments, including on consumption tax\" cuts, Seiji Inada, managing director at FGS Global, a strategic advisory consultancy was quoted by Reuters as saying.\"Markets could react in the following days, and the yen could come under renewed pressure,\" Inada added.Takaichi also promised to suspend the 8 percent sales tax on food for two years to help households cope with rising prices, partly driven by the yen's sharp fall.Takaichi rides 'Sanakatsu' wave among young votersTakaichi has generated a social media-led wave, mostly among younger voters, of a Sanae-mania called \"sanakatsu\" for products she uses, such as her handbag and the pink pen she scribbles notes with in parliament.A recent opinion poll found voters under 30 favouring her by more than 90%. That young cohort, however, is less likely to vote than the older generations that have long been the bedrock of LDP support.On Thursday, Takaichi received the endorsement of US President Donald Trump, a signal that may appeal to right-leaning voters but could also put off some moderates.Snowfall and blizzardsWith up to 70 cm (28 inches) of snow forecast in northern and eastern regions on Sunday, some voters will have to battle blizzards to pass their verdict on her administration.It is only the third postwar election held in February, with elections typically called during milder months.In Nagaoka in the rural northern prefecture of Niigata, where snow was piled more than 1 metre (3 feet) high along the roadsides on Saturday, campaigners urged people to vote early to avoid expected snow storms.\"It's bad enough here in the towns, but in the mountains there's twice as much snow. It's hard just to leave the house,\" said Takehiko Igarashi, a volunteer for the Japanese Communist Party, which he said was calling up supporters and offering to drive them to polling stations.Turnout in recent lower house elections has hovered around the mid-50% range. Any slump on Sunday could amplify the influence of organised voting blocs.One of those is Komeito, which last year quit its coalition with the LDP and merged into a centrist group with the main opposition Constitutional Democratic Party of Japan.Komeito has close ties to the lay-Buddhist Soka Gakkai group, which claims at least 8 million members nationwide.","url":"https://www.livemint.com/news/world/japan-holds-rare-winter-elections-pm-sanae-takaichi-expected-to-win-what-we-know-so-far-11770513105693.html","image":"https://www.livemint.com/lm-img/img/2026/02/08/1600x900/logo/JAPAN-ELECTION--5_1770513219831_1770513238684.JPG","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-02-08 01:15:51","author":"Akriti Anand","authors":["Akriti Anand"],"language":"en","source_country":"in","sentiment":-0.179},{"id":400501678,"title":"Washington Post publisher Will Lewis says he’s stepping down, days after big layoffs at the paper","text":"By David Bauder | Associated Press\n\nWashington Post publisher Will Lewis said Saturday that he’s stepping down, ending a troubled tenure three days after the newspaper said that it was laying off one-third of its staff.\n\nLewis announced his departure in a two-paragraph email to the newspaper’s staff, saying that after two years of transformation, “now is the right time for me to step aside.” The Post’s chief financial officer, Jeff D’Onofrio, was appointed temporary publisher.\n\nNeither Lewis nor the newspaper’s billionaire owner Jeff Bezos participated in the meeting with staff members announcing the layoffs on Wednesday. While anticipated, the cutbacks were deeper than expected, resulting in the shutdown of the Post’s renowned sports section, the elimination of its photography staff and sharp reductions in personnel responsible for coverage of metropolitan Washington and overseas.\n\nThey came on top of widespread talent defections in recent years at the newspaper, which lost tens of thousands of subscribers following Bezos’ order late in the 2024 presidential campaign pulling back from a planned endorsement of Kamala Harris, and a subsequent reorienting of its opinion section in a more conservative direction.\n\nMartin Baron, the Post’s first editor under Bezos, condemned his former boss this week for attempting to curry favor with President Donald Trump and called what has happened at the newspaper “a case study in near-instant, self-inflicted brand destruction.”\n\nThe British-born Lewis was a former top executive at The Wall Street Journal before taking over at The Post in January 2024. His tenure has been rocky from the start, marked by layoffs and a failed reorganization plan that led to the departure of former top editor Sally Buzbee.\n\nHis initial choice to take over for Buzbee, Robert Winnett, withdrew from the job after ethical questions were raised about both he and Lewis’ actions while working in England. They including paying for information that produced major stories, actions that would be considered unethical in American journalism. The current executive editor, Matt Murray, took over shortly thereafter.\n\nLewis didn’t endear himself to Washington Post journalists with blunt talk about their work, at one point saying in a staff meeting that they needed to make changes because not enough people were reading their work.\n\nThis week’s layoffs have led to some calls for Bezos to either increase his investment in The Post or sell it to someone who will take a more active role. Lewis, in his note, praised Bezos: “The institution could not have had a better owner,” he said.\n\n“During my tenure, difficult decisions have been taken in order to ensure the sustainable future of The Post so it can for many years ahead publish high-quality nonpartisan news to millions of customer each day,” Lewis said.\n\nD’Onofrio, who joined the paper last June after serving as the financial chief for the digital ad management company Raptive, said in a note to staff that “we are ending a hard week of change with more change.\n\n“This is a challenging time across all media organizations, and The Post is unfortunately no exception,” he wrote. “I’ve had the privilege of helping chart the course of disrupters and cultural stalwarts alike. All faced economic headwinds in changing industry landscapes, and we rose to meet those moments. I have no doubt we will do just that, together.”\n\nDavid Bauder writes about the intersection of media and entertainment for the AP.

The roughly one-minute clip, which appeared on Trump's Truth Social account, focused mainly on long-standing claims of voter fraud in the 2020 election, particularly in Georgia. Near the end, however, a short segment showed former President Barack Obama and former first lady Michelle Obama depicted as apes in a jungle setting, with the song “The Lion Sleeps Tonight” playing in the background. The video was taken down Friday morning after drawing sharp criticism from across the political spectrum.,,Speaking to reporters aboard Air Force One on Friday as he traveled to Florida, Trump explained that he had only viewed the opening section of the clip before it went live. “I just looked at the first part, it was about voter fraud in some place, Georgia,” he said. “I didn’t see the whole thing.” He went on to say he passed the link along to staff members, adding, “I gave it to the people, generally they’d look at the whole thing but I guess somebody didn’t.”,No Apology, But Condemnation of the Offensive PartWhen directly asked if he condemned the racist imagery in the video, Trump replied, “Of course I do.” He pushed back against calls for an apology, insisting he had done nothing wrong. “No, I didn’t make a mistake,” he told the press gaggle.,The White House initially described the post as coming from an internet meme-style video, but later shifted to saying it was posted in error by a staff member. The rapid removal followed bipartisan backlash, including from some Republican senators who called the content unacceptable and urged Trump to disavow it fully.,A Pattern of ControversyThis incident fits into a longer history of Trump sharing or amplifying material that critics say targets Black Americans and others with derogatory imagery or language. The Obamas have faced personal attacks from Trump dating back to his first presidential campaign, including unfounded questions about citizenship.,The former first couple has not publicly commented on the latest video. Civil rights organizations and several lawmakers described the clip as dehumanizing and disgusting. ,Trump maintained that the core of the post was election-related content and that the objectionable ending was unintended and unseen by him at the time. For now, the White House appears to be moving past the controversy without a formal apology, while Trump has made clear he sees no need to retract or express regret beyond condemning the specific racist element.,Get Latest News Live on Times Now along with Breaking News and Top Headlines from US News and around the World.","summary":"President Trump acknowledged the offensive nature of a social media video he shared, which depicted the Obamas as apes, yet he refused to apologize for posting it.

We beg you now to return our mother to us so that we can celebrate with her,” she said in a video posted on social media, flanked by her siblings. “This is the only way we will have peace. This is very valuable to us, and we will pay.”\n\nMs. Guthrie was referencing a message that was sent to the Tucson-based television station KOLD on Friday (February 6, 2026) afternoon, according to Kevin Smith, a spokesperson for the FBI office in Phoenix.\n\nKOLD said it received an email related to the Guthrie case on social media that day but declined to share specific details about its contents as the FBI conducted its review.\n\nThe station was one of multiple press outlets that received alleged ransom letters during the week. At least one letter made monetary demands and established Thursday (February 5, 2026) evening and the following Monday evening as deadlines.\n\nIn a news conference Thursday (February 5, 2026), law enforcement officials declined to affirm that the letters were credible but said all tips were being investigated seriously. They also said one letter referenced Nancy Guthrie’s Apple watch and a specific feature of her property.\n\nThe video released Saturday (February 7, 2026) was the third this week that pleaded with potential kidnappers.\n\nInvestigators think Nancy Guthrie was taken against her will from her home just outside Tucson last weekend. DNA tests showed blood on Guthrie’s front porch was a match to her, Pima County Sheriff Chris Nanos has said. Authorities have not identified any suspects or ruled anyone out.\n\nThe sheriff said Friday (February 6, 2026) that he was frustrated that a camera at Nancy Guthrie’s home was not able to capture images of anyone the day she went missing.\n\nInvestigators have found that the home’s doorbell camera was disconnected early Sunday and that software data recorded movement at the home minutes later. But Nancy Guthrie did not have an active subscription, so none of the images were able to be recovered.\n\n“It is concerning, it’s actually almost disappointing, because you’ve got your hopes up,” Mr. Nanos told The Associated Press in an interview. “OK, they got an image. ‘Well, we do, but we don’t.’”\n\nPresident Donald Trump, speaking on Air Force One on Friday (February 6, 2026), said the investigation was going “very well.”\n\n“We have some clues that I think are very strong,” Mr. Trump said, while en route to his Florida estate. “We have some things that may be coming out reasonably soon.”\n\nThey were back in Nancy Guthrie’s neighborhood on Friday (February 6, 2026).\n\nThe sheriff’s department posted on social media to say access was restricted to the road in front of the home to give investigators space. Journalists staked out there were directed to move.\n\nThe Catalina Foothills Association, a neighborhood group, told residents in a letter that authorities were resuming searches in the area immediately.\n\n“I know we all stand together in our collective disbelief and sadness and greatly appreciate your willingness to speak with law enforcement, share camera images and allow searches of your properties,” the association president said in the letter.\n\nThe sheriff said Thursday (February 5, 2026) that investigators have not given up on trying to retrieve camera recordings.\n\n“I wish technology was as easy as we believe it is, that here’s a picture, here’s your bad guy. But it’s not,” Mr. Nanos told the AP. “There are pieces of information that come to us from these tech groups that say ‘this is what we have and we can’t get anymore.’”\n\nThe sheriff also said he had no new information about the note to the TV station or other purported ransom letters sent to some media outlets, saying the FBI is handling that side of the investigation.\n\nMeanwhile concern about Nancy Guthrie’s health condition has grown, because authorities say she needs vital daily medicine. She is said to have a pacemaker and have dealt with high blood pressure and heart issues, according to sheriff’s dispatcher audio on broadcastify.com.\n\n“Her conditions, I would imagine, are worsening day by day,” Mr. Nanos said. “She requires medication. And I have no way of knowing whether they’re getting that medication to her.” \n\nThe kidnapping has captured the attention of Americans, including Mr. Trump, who said he was directing federal authorities to help investigate.","url":"https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/savannah-guthrie-mother-nancy-kidnapping-case-february-8-2026/article70606417.ece","image":"https://th-i.thgim.com/public/incoming/3uagco/article70606418.ece/alternates/LANDSCAPE_1200/2026-02-08T005922Z_2080227991_RC2CHJA0ANZE_RTRMADP_3_USA-CRIME-GUTHRIE.JPG","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-02-08 01:12:42","author":null,"language":"en","source_country":"in","sentiment":-0.347},{"id":400502044,"title":"Tavleen Singh writes: Entitlement defeats valid opposition","text":"When you are the great-grandson of a prime minister, the grandson of a prime minister, the son of a prime minister and a de facto prime minister, it must be hard to accept being just Leader of the Opposition. And this after failing to get enough seats in two general elections to occupy this relatively humble post. So, I understand Rahul Gandhi’s loathing of the usurper who has deprived him of what he seems to have grown up believing was his inheritance. It does not help his case to sound sulky and petulant about this. Why does he not understand yet that when he insults Narendra Modi, he also insults the Prime Minister? What shocked me most of the many things that he said last week outside Parliament House was that the Prime Minister was ‘compromised’ and this is why he had been forced into the trade deal with the United States. This is not the sort of thing that can be said without proof. But Rahul Gandhi is so obsessed with damaging the Prime Minister personally that he reduces every political point he wants to make to a personal attack on Modi. He has also deluded himself into believing that the only reason that Modi remains popular is because of an ‘image’ created at the expense of many crore rupees. He ignores the reality that Modi has won two general elections with a full majority and a third one with a reduced majority. An India Today poll says that his popularity has increased since the last Lok Sabha election and that if an election were held today, he would win back a full majority. The heir to our most powerful political dynasty for his part has lost so many elections that it is hard to keep count. The Congress Party has never once done a real analysis of why it has been reduced to almost becoming a regional party, so its deluded prince continues to live in his delusions of ‘vote chori’ and Indian democracy having died. This could be the reason why whenever there is a session of Parliament, he and his gang of obedient MPs spend more time protesting in the gardens of Parliament House than inside the House. When asked about this, Rahul Gandhi always says that he is not allowed to speak inside the Lok Sabha so is forced to adopt street fighting tactics. Personally, I believe that this time it would have been wise for the Speaker to allow him to speak. Denying him permission has resulted in all of India discovering now what the former army chief has written in his book. In the few words that the Congress Party’s heir apparent managed to say in the Lok Sabha he made clear that his intention was to destroy the image of the Prime Minister. He wanted to prove that he was no nationalist and that he had failed to lead when leadership was most needed during the border clash with China in Ladakh. Good luck with that but what did this worthy exercise have to do with the President’s speech? This was the subject being discussed that day. Now some free advice for the Gandhi family. Please, please allow Parliament to function so that you can raise the issues you consider important inside the House instead of in its compound. Sonia Gandhi and her daughter raised the excellent issue of Delhi’s polluted air while chatting to television reporters last week but outside the House. Sonia said children were suffering and so were people like her who had asthma. Why did she not demand a debate on this subject in the Rajya Sabha that day? It was functioning well enough for the Prime Minister to give his response to the debate. He was not allowed to speak in the Lok Sabha because, as Priyanka explained, if the Leader of the Opposition is not allowed to speak, the prime minister would not be allowed to speak either. By the time the Gandhi family were done with their theatrics, there was no time left to discuss what seems to be a good trade deal with the United States. India stood its ground against the bullying strategy used by Donald Trump. Our Prime Minister deserves full credit for the dignified tactics he used to achieve what, in the circumstances, are some major concessions. But for a member of the Dynasty to admit this would amount to conceding that Narendra Modi has done a fairly good job and this is something they cannot do because their sense of entitlement prevents them. It also prevents them from seeing that one reason why Modi won the first time was because India wanted a real leader to take charge instead of an imperious royal family that had become drunk on its power and privileges. If Modi has remained prime minister for more than twelve years it is because ordinary Indians have seen their lives improve. The welfare schemes that he initiated have made it easier to live in rural India than it was before. Millions of Indians who lived in extreme poverty now live better and with a degree of hope that their lives will continue to get better. As someone who remembers well those decades of socialist feudalism when Rahul Gandhi’s family were prime ministers, believe me when I tell you that those were truly bleak times for most Indians.","url":"https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/tavleen-singh-writes-entitlement-defeats-valid-opposition-10519839/","image":"https://images.indianexpress.com/2026/02/rahul-gandhi-in-ls-ss-video-on-x-1_20260207181540.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-02-08 01:11:16","author":"Tavleen Singh","authors":["Tavleen Singh"],"language":"en","source_country":"in","sentiment":-0.336},{"id":400499088,"title":"Protest against ICE in McKinney draws residents across Collin County","text":"MCKINNEY — A crowd of dozens of people lined State Highway 380 Saturday afternoon to protest the Trump administration weeks after U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers killed two people in Minnesota. The protesters came from all over Collin County, a historically Republican stronghold, and waved American flags while they chanted slogans such as “Power to the people, no one is illegal” and “No Kings, No Crowns, No Thrones.” \n\nMany protesters said they were motivated to speak out following the deaths of Renee Good and Alex Pretti, two people killed in Minneapolis by ICE officers during an immigration crackdown in that city. \n\nThe Trump administration called Good a domestic terrorist who tried to run over an officer with her vehicle. State and local officials have rejected that characterization, The Associated Press reported.\n\nPresident Donald Trump had asked officials to prioritize deporting undocumented immigrants since he took office last January. More than 70,000 people are in ICE detention so far for fiscal year 2026, according to data released by ICE. \n\nIn McKinney, many protesters said they were independent voters or former Republicans who felt compelled to publicly show their opposition to Trump. \n\nMonica Martino, 76, who has organized 17 similar protests opposing Trump since April, said she found the tactics of ICE officers “unconscionable.” \n\n“Defending the laws of immigration does not mean mask-wearing, throwing tear gas and smoke bombs at anybody assembled, shooting people in cars,” Martino said, referring to Good’s Jan. 7 killing. \n\nMartino, who is a Plano resident and a political independent, said she has been consistently surprised by the number of people who attend the protests she organizes at the intersection of SH-380 and U.S. 75. \n\n“Collin County feels more purple than it ever has,” Martino said. \n\nJacob Kennedy, a 27-year-old software programmer from Allen, is among a core group of political independents that regularly attend protests in McKinney. On Saturday, he took turns holding up a volleyball net with the words “END ICE TERROR” attached to it in large, orange letters. Kennedy said he started attending protests when he heard about U.S. Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s opposition to vaccines last year \n\n“I don’t even like calling myself a Democrat, but I started becoming involved when I heard about our government being anti-science, shooting people in the street … and threatening to take our elections away,” Kennedy said. \n\nSuburban mother Lynley VanSingel came from Sachse to attend her third protest in McKinney. VanSingel, who identifies as an independent voter, held up a sign that read “Imagine hating immigrants more than pedophiles,” referencing Trump’s previous reluctance to release the Epstein files and what she sees as the administration’s focus on mass deportations as opposed to pursuing justice for victims of Epstein’s sex trafficking. \n\n“It’s very sad that we are putting the hate of immigrants who have done nothing but … make this world better for us, ahead of pedophiles, especially with this last release of the Epstein files,” Van Singel said. “They’re choosing to ignore and not take care of the victims.” \n\nAlena Cedeno, 19, said she attended the protest because she has seen a rise in hatred and racism towards immigrants like herself since Trump got elected. Cedeno, a Plano resident, who immigrated to the United States from Costa Rica when she was 4 years old, said she was troubled by ICE deporting people without due process. \n\n“People are … just doing very evil things towards immigrants,” Cedeno said. “I definitely think that these protests are bringing awareness … we’re really seeing how the country feels despite what our government is trying to tell us.”","url":"https://www.dallasnews.com/news/2026/02/07/mckinney-protest-against-ice-drew-dozens-of-residents-across-collin-county/","image":"https://dmn-dallas-news-prod.cdn.arcpublishing.com/resizer/v2/YSGLAGOKQBFIBONQTLF4CVCDRM.jpg?auth=52a11fe60d7a262fd4f209b263bcc3b517e7b7c9597a97000fcb8919f1eda9c7&quality=80&width=1200&height=630&focal=2566,1073","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-02-08 01:08:34","author":"Angela Mathew","authors":["Angela Mathew"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.472},{"id":400500576,"title":"ICE chief counsel in Minnesota retires amid growing number of immigration cases","text":"The top lawyer for Immigration and Customs Enforcement in Minnesota has left the agency, the same week an ICE attorney was removed after telling a district judge that “this job sucks” and that the Trump administration is “overwhelmed” with immigration cases. Chief Counsel Jim Stolley retired after 31 years of service, Department of Homeland Security spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin told CNN. McLaughlin said Stolley’s retirement was scheduled to occur but did not provide additional details. Stolley said in an automatic email response, “I have retired from public service,” and directed inquiries to the duty attorney. CNN also reached out to Stolley by phone but has not heard back. The New York Times was first to report on Stolley leaving his post. Minnesota courts have been inundated with immigration cases since the Trump administration began surging immigration enforcement to the state in December. Earlier this week, ICE attorney Julie Le, who was detailed to Minnesota to help handle the immigration operation, was removed from her post after telling a judge that the job “sucks” because of the crushing workload and the government’s apparent inability to comply with court orders. In an extraordinarily candid exchange with a federal judge on Tuesday, Le, who had been asked to explain why the administration was not promptly complying with a slew of court orders stemming from immigration cases she’s handling, admitted that the government did not have enough lawyers on the ground to keep up and that trying to get errors fixed is like “pulling teeth.” Le’s comments – before Stolley’s resignation – offered a candid look at the immigration operation in Minnesota, which the Trump administration announced Wednesday would be reduced, including a withdrawal of 700 federal law enforcement personnel from the state “effective immediately.” President Donald Trump similarly signaled less aggressive tactics in the immigration enforcement blitz, telling NBC News on the same day as the drawdown announcement, “Maybe we can use a little bit of a softer touch, but you still have to be tough.” Last month, two US citizens were shot by federal law enforcement agents in Minnesota, sparking extensive protests. The Trump administration’s crackdown in Minnesota has also faced pushback from state and local officials, who failed to convince a federal judge in Minneapolis to temporarily block the operation. CNN’s Devan Cole, Tierney Sneed, Hannah Rabinowitz and Hanna Park contributed to this report.","url":"https://edition.cnn.com/2026/02/07/politics/ice-top-lawyer-minnesota-jim-stolley-retires","image":"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/c-gettyimages-2254658683.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-02-08 01:08:26","author":"Aleena Fayaz,Kit Maher","authors":["Aleena Fayaz","Kit Maher"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.659},{"id":400496392,"title":"Japan Votes in Test for PM Takaichi as Snow Weighs on Turnout","text":"TOKYO: Japanese voters were casting ballots on Sunday in an election expected to hand Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi a resounding win, although record snowfall in parts of the country could keep many voters at home.The conservative coalition of Takaichi, the nation's first female leader, could win more than 300 of the 465 seats in the lower house of parliament, according to multiple opinion polls, a large gain from the 233 it is defending.If the coalition of Takaichi's Liberal Democratic Party with the Japan Innovation Party, known as Ishin, wins 310 seats, it would be able to override the opposition-controlled upper chamber.She has vowed to step down if the coalition loses its majority.TAKAICHI RIDES 'SANAKATSU' WAVE AMONG YOUNG VOTERSTakaichi, 64, who became prime minister in October after being selected LDP leader, sought a mandate from voters in a rare winter election as she rides a wave of popularity.With a straight-talking style and an image as a hard worker that have won her support, especially with younger voters, Takaichi has accelerated military spending to counter China, which she sparked a diplomatic row with, and pushed economic stimulus and tax cuts that have rattled financial markets.\"If Takaichi wins big, she will have more political room to follow through on key commitments, including on consumption tax\" cuts, said Seiji Inada, managing director at FGS Global, a strategic advisory consultancy. \"Markets could react in the following days, and the yen could come under renewed pressure.\"She has promised to suspend the 8% sales tax on food for two years to help households cope with rising prices, partly driven by the yen's sharp fall.Takaichi has generated a social media-led wave, mostly among younger voters, of a Sanae-mania called \"sanakatsu\" for products she uses, such as her handbag and the pink pen she scribbles notes with in parliament.A recent opinion poll found voters under 30 favouring her by more than 90%. That young cohort, however, is less likely to vote than the older generations that have long been the bedrock of LDP support.On Thursday, Takaichi received the endorsement of U.S. President Donald Trump, a signal that may appeal to right-leaning voters but could also put off some moderates.WHITEOUT COULD BOOST ORGANISED VOTING BLOCSWith up to 70 cm (28 inches) of snow forecast in northern and eastern regions on Sunday, some voters will have to battle blizzards to pass their verdict on her administration. It is only the third postwar election held in February, with elections typically called during milder months.In Nagaoka in the rural northern prefecture of Niigata, where snow was piled more than 1 metre (3 feet) high along the roadsides on Saturday, campaigners urged people to vote early to avoid expected snow storms.\"It's bad enough here in the towns, but in the mountains there's twice as much snow. It's hard just to leave the house,\" said Takehiko Igarashi, a volunteer for the Japanese Communist Party, which he said was calling up supporters and offering to drive them to polling stations.Turnout in recent lower house elections has hovered around the mid-50% range. Any slump on Sunday could amplify the influence of organised voting blocs.One of those is Komeito, which last year quit its coalition with the LDP and has merged into a centrist group with the main opposition Constitutional Democratic Party of Japan. Komeito has close ties to the lay-Buddhist Soka Gakkai group, which claims at least 8 million members nationwide.Voters will pick lawmakers in 289 single-seat constituencies, with the rest decided by proportional-representation votes for parties. Polls close at 8 p.m. (1100 GMT), when broadcasters are expected to issue projections based on their exit polls.","url":"https://www.deccanchronicle.com/world/asia/japan-votes-in-test-for-pm-takaichi-as-snow-weighs-on-turnout-1935768","image":"https://www.deccanchronicle.com/h-upload/2026/02/08/2007904-aa-6460397.webp","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-02-08 01:04:21","author":"Reuters","authors":["Reuters"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"in","sentiment":-0.09},{"id":400497338,"title":"Nexstar-Tegna $6.2 bn television deal wins Trump’s support despite conservative pushback","text":"APUS President Donald Trump \n\nPresident Donald Trump endorsed Nexstar Media Group's USD 6.2 billion purchase of broadcast rival Tegna on Saturday, an apparent reversal from earlier criticism of the deal.\"We need more competition against THE ENEMY, the Fake News National TV Networks,\" Trump wrote on social media. \"Letting Good Deals get done like Nexstar - Tegna will help knock out the Fake News because there will be more competition. ...

He said the talks would resume \"soon\".Trump on Friday called the talks \"very good\", and pledged another round of negotiations next week.Despite this, he signed an executive order effective from Saturday that called for the \"imposition of tariffs\" on countries still doing business with Iran.The United States also announced new sanctions against numerous shipping entities and vessels, aimed at curbing Iran's oil exports.More than a quarter of Iran's trade is with China, with $18 billion in imports and $14.5 billion in exports in 2024, according to World Trade Organization data.'Defence issue' Araghchi told Al Jazeera that nuclear enrichment was Iran's \"inalienable right and must continue\".\"We are ready to reach a reassuring agreement on enrichment,\" he said.\"The Iranian nuclear case will only be resolved through negotiations.\"He also said Iran's missile programme was \"never negotiable\" because it relates to a \"defence issue\".Washington has sought to address Iran's ballistic missile programme and its support for militant groups in the region -- issues which Israel has pushed to include in the talks, according to media reports.Tehran has repeatedly rejected expanding the scope of the negotiations beyond the nuclear issue.Netanyahu is set to meet Trump on Wednesday to discuss the Iran talks, the premier's office said in a statement Saturday.Netanyahu \"believes any negotiations must include limitations on ballistic missiles and a halting of the support for the Iranian axis\", it said, referring to Iran's allies in the region.On Saturday, Araghchi criticised what he labelled a \"doctrine of domination\" that allows Israel to expand its military arsenal while pressuring other states in the region to disarm.Friday's negotiations were the first since nuclear talks between Iran and the United States collapsed last year following Israel's unprecedented bombing campaign against Iran, which triggered a 12-day war.During the war US warplanes bombed Iranian nuclear sites.Araghchi told Al Jazeera that if attacked again, \"we will attack their bases in the region\", referring to the United States.Protests toll Friday's talks between the two arch enemies came amid a major US military buildup in the region in the wake of Iran's crackdown on protests that began in late December, driven by economic grievances.The authorities in Iran have acknowledged that 3,117 people were killed in the recent protests, publishing on Sunday a list of 2,986 names, most of whom they say were members of the security forces and innocent bystanders.International organisations have put the toll far higher.The US-based Human Rights Activists News Agency (HRANA), which has kept a running toll since the onset of the protests, says it has verified 6,961 deaths, mainly of protesters, and has another 11,630 cases under investigation.

Gavin Newsom and Los Angeles Democrats, Shangri-La hasn’t become synonymous with a place that connotes peace on earth. It stands for a hellish homeless housing nightmare, eye-popping alleged fraud, and the ease and scale with which alleged con-artists rip off taxpayers.\n\nIn October, federal agents arrested Cody Holmes, the 31-year-old former CFO of Shangri-La Industries, a downtown Los Angeles-based developer who was supposed to be providing housing for homeless people in Southern California. First Assistant U.S. Attorney Bill Essayli for the Central District of California, a Trump appointee, charged him with mail fraud.\n\nHolmes, who pleaded not guilty, is accused of embezzling more than $2 million in taxpayer funds slated for homeless housing construction to host extravagant parties; a $46,000-per-month Beverly Hills mansion; private jet travel; leases of exotic cars; high-end handbags totaling $128,000; a $35,000 diamond watch; and 20 VIP passes for the 2023 Coachella Music and Arts Festival.\n\nMeanwhile, Shangri-La Industries executives showered Newsom and Los Angeles County Democrats with political donations as they were applying for some $100 million in state contracts that the CFO later allegedly looted to fund his and his ex-girlfriend’s lavish lifestyle.\n\nEven after federal prosecutors exposed the massive fraud, Newsom and L.A. Democrats haven’t severed ties with the embattled developer and have kept political donations from the firm’s executives. Newsom has also allowed the construction firm to continue to tout his endorsement on its social media.\n\nPowerful Friends\n\nHolmes allegedly defrauded the California Department of Housing and Community Development by submitting fabricated bank accounts in its applications for state contracts to build homeless housing. Acting on behalf of Shangri-La, Holmes allegedly falsified $160 million in assets controlled by Shangri-La and its affiliates to demonstrate that the firm had liquid funds to contribute to the construction projects, according to court documents.\n\nAccording to the government, most of those funds never existed. The FBI traced only an estimated $24,000 that the developer had on hand at the time of the applications for Newsom’s signature Homekey contracts, a program launched amid the COVID pandemic lockdowns that converted empty motels into homeless housing. Holmes is accused of providing false bank statements for Shangri-La Industries to acquire the more than $100 million in state grant money for seven Homekey projects, according to an affidavit filed with the complaint and other court documents.\n\nFormer President Bill Clinton has been linked to Shangri-La Industries and served as a strategic adviser for the firm. (AP Photo/John Raoux)Shangri-La Industries has historic roots to billionaire Steve Bing and Bill Clinton, whom the Bing-led company paid more than $2.5 million to serve as a strategic adviser. Bing died by suicide in 2020, more than a decade after founding the investment, entertainment, and philanthropic empire.\n\nCalifornia housing authorities are also suing Shangri-La Industries for breaching contracts under Newsom’s signature Project Homekey homeless housing project in a likely futile attempt to recover the missing millions. Yet, no criminal action was taken against anyone involved until Essayli issued his indictment against Holmes last fall.\n\nShangri-La Industries CEO Andy Meyer, who also goes by Andy Abdul-Wahab, according to court documents, has blamed Holmes for the bank and mail fraud and filed a lawsuit against him. The suit accuses Holmes, his former intern, of embezzling company funds by moving the money to accounts and shell companies that he controlled while allegedly also transferring money to Madeline Witt, his then-girlfriend. Witt is named as a co-defendant in the suit.\n\nNewsom, L.A. Dems Mum on Returning Shangri-La Donations\n\nNewsom’s office did not respond to an inquiry into whether he planned to return any of the funds Shangri-La employees have donated to his campaigns over the last decade. A RealClearPolitics review of campaign donations found at least $18,000 from Abdul-Wahab to Newsom’s campaigns for governor and lieutenant governor.\n\nNewsom’s office also did not say whether he stands by a quote endorsing Shangri-La Industries and its partner, Step Up On Second Street, which Shangri-La has used on its now-defunct website under the heading, “What Our Customers Are Saying,” and on its active Instagram account.\n\n“In a matter of months, not years, Shangri-La and Step Up gave some of the most vulnerable Californians the dignity of a key, a lock, a door, a place to call home,” the Newsom quote states in reference to a homeless housing project in San Bernardino. California’s campaign finance database also shows a mysterious $30,000 donation from Shangrila Investment LLC in support of Newsom’s signature Proposition 1 homeless ballot initiative. The initiative, which barely passed with 50.2% of the vote in March 2024, approved a $6.4 billion bond for more state homelessness spending and attempts to address related mental health and addiction for the first time.\n\nIn the final days of the mail-in voting election, as the outcome hung in the balance, both sides, Newsom and those opposing the ballot measure, urged voters whose ballots may have been rejected to fix their signatures.\n\nYet, so far, Newsom’s “CARE court” project, attempting to address mental health and addiction, has reportedly fallen far short of expectations. Other controversial donations to the homeless ballot initiative include $100,000 from Edison International and affiliated entities, the parent company of SoCal Edison, whose equipment caused the Eaton fire that killed 19 people last year; and $250,000 from PG&E and affiliated entities, the Northern California utility that caused the 2018 Camp Fire, the deadliest fire in state history, responsible for 84 deaths.\n\nDownload The California Post App, follow us on social, and subscribe to our newsletters \n\nIt’s unclear whether this $30,000 donation from Shangrila Investment LLC is related to Shangri-La Industries or other affiliated entities that court documents connect to the embattled developer. Neither Newsom’s office nor Capitol Compliance, the D.C.-based entity that helps run Newsom’s ballot committee, returned repeated requests for comment.\n\nAsked if the donation made by Shangrila Investment LLC is affiliated with the Shangri-La developer at the heart of the fraud scandal, Holmes’ high-powered attorney Michael Freedman, who has represented Harvey Weinstein and Bill Cosby, replied only: “No comment.”\n\nState campaign-finance records show that Abdul-Wahab also showered donations on state and local officials, including $30,000 to the Los Angeles County Democratic Party in 2022, when the developer was trying to win the homeless contracts. The Los Angeles County Democratic Party did not respond to an inquiry about whether it planned to return the funds.\n\nOther donations from Meyer Abdul-Wahab went to former Assemblywoman Wendy Carillo, who represented Glendale and parts of East Los Angeles and is the first former illegal immigrant to be elected to the state Assembly. Additional donations went to Assemblywoman Cecilia Aguiar Curry, who represents a west Sacramento district that includes areas of parts of Napa and is serving as majority leader of the Assembly; Sen. Sabrina Cervantes of Riverside and parts of San Bernardino County; Assemblywoman Jacqui Irwin who represents the city of Thousand Oaks; Sen. John Laird of Santa Clara and Monterey; Assemblyman Alex Lee of Fremont, Milpitas and West San Jose; and Assemblywoman Buffy Wicks of the East Bay.\n\nIn December 2021, U.S. Rep. Robert Garcia, a Democrat and the former mayor of Long Beach, where Meyer Abdul-Wahab resides, returned two Shangri-La donations during Garcia’s run for lieutenant governor, according to Cal-Access, the state campaign donations database.\n\nLobbyists for Shangri-La Industries include Panorea Avdis, partner at Sacramento Advocates, a public affairs and lobbying firm, along with several other firm associates, according to a state lobbying database. Before becoming a lobbyist, Avdis was chief of staff to Lt. Gov. Eleni Kounalakis, and previously served a stint as a director of external affairs at California’s housing department during the administration of GOP Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger, as well as the state’s Business and Economic Development office under Democratic Gov. Jerry Brown. Sacramento Advocates did not return requests for comment about its relationship with Shangri-La Industries.\n\nAt least two of the Homekey motel conversion projects in Southern California have been renovated and are now fully occupied: a 98-unit former Good Nite Inn in Redlands (now called Step Up in Redlands) and a 76-unit former All-Star Lodge in San Bernardino (now Step Up in San Bernardino).\n\nShangri-La Stiffed Subcontractors\n\nSubcontractors and suppliers to the San Bernardino and Redlands projects filed $2 million in liens for unpaid work and materials, and at least some contractors say they have yet to be paid and are growing increasingly doubtful that they ever will be. Shangri-La Industries allegedly illegally obtained more than $50 million in new loans for several Homekey properties across the state without notifying the state housing department.\n\nAdolfo Gomringer Sr., who owns AG Flooring, told RCP that he has yet to receive $93,000 that Shangri-La owes him for metal framing, drywall, demolition, and flooring work his company performed for the San Bernardino motel conversion in 2023. Gomringer said he has written to Newsom, L.A. Mayor Karen Bass, and L.A. and San Bernardino County officials, asking for their help, but has not received a response.\n\n“Unfortunately, I didn’t hear back from anybody, so I just gave up hope,” Gomringer told RCP this week. “Honestly, it’s just shocking that there was nothing in place to protect us – the contractors actually doing the work on these jobs.”\n\nAccording to the FBI agent’s affidavit used in the criminal complaint against Holmes, the young CFO completely fabricated a Bank of America account statement showing $59 million that did not exist.\n\nRichard Staropoli investigated bank fraud cases for years as a Secret Service agent, then went on to serve as chief information officer and head of risk for the international hedge fund Fortress Investment Group. Staropoli told RCP that the California housing department should have performed basic due diligence practices to verify the bank accounts Shangri-La claimed to have, and the exact amounts in them.\n\n“Are you kidding me?” Staropoli said in reaction to the FBI’s investigative findings in the Holmes case. “Are you telling me that at this level of the amounts of money that’s involved here, nobody’s checking this? This just speaks to the incredibly poor practices of California’s housing authorities.”\n\nIn early January, Essayli warned that more arrests are coming after finding “massive” fraud in California’s homeless services.\n\nIn mid-January, police arrested Alexander Soofer, who allegedly used millions of taxpayer dollars slated to house and feed hundreds of homeless to purchase a $7 million mansion in Westwood, pay for private jet travel, lavish spending at luxury resorts across the United States and a vacation property in Greece, his children’s private school tuition, and a $125,000 Range Rover.\n\nSoofer is also accused of feeding 600 homeless people – which his organization, Abundant Blessings, housed – Ramen noodles, canned beans, and breakfast bars instead of the three healthy meals a day the contract required.\n\n“California is the poster child of rampant fraud, waste, and abuse of tax dollars,” Essayli said, referring to the more than $24 billion the state has spent on fraud without demonstrating any impact from the investment. \n\n“The state has facilitated the spending of billions of dollars to combat homelessness, with little to show for it and almost no oversight.”\n\n“Thankfully, the federal government has begun auditing California’s spending and today’s is just one example of how fraudsters have swindled millions of dollars from taxpayers,” he added. “This money should have gone to those in need, instead it lines the pockets of individuals subsidizing their lavish lifestyle.”\n\nIn a testy email exchange last week, Essayli labeled Newsom the “king of fraud” for failing to provide basic oversight measures to protect taxpayer funds and blasted him for claiming the homeless fraud isn’t his fault.\n\nNewsom’s press office, responding to a conservative influencer blasting the governor over homeless fraud after Essayli’s indictments against Soofer, denied any culpability.\n\n“TOTALLY FALSE to imply the Governor was responsible for this fraud! Fraud is unacceptable — and unlike Donald Trump, who pardons fraudsters, Newsom demands anyone who steals taxpayer dollars be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law.”\n\n“WRONG,” Essayli responded in an X post. “You and the California legislature facilitated this fraud by handing out billions in tax dollars to these nonprofits with zero vetting and zero state oversight.”\n\nBillionaire Bing’s Ties to Shangri-La Industries\n\nShangri-La Industries – the firm ensnared in the homeless fraud scandal – originally was created by billionaire entertainment mogul Steve Bing, a Democratic Party mega-donor, film and music producer, and the grandson of Manhattan real estate developer Leo Bing.\n\nAt 18, Bing inherited a $600 million fortune from his father, then dropped out of Stanford University in his junior year to move to Hollywood and produce and invest in movies. Along the way, he also fathered British actress and model Elizabeth Hurley’s son Damian in 2002.\n\nBing gave at least $50 million to candidates and California ballot measures over two decades, including Newsom, former Health and Human Services Secretary Xavier Becerra, who is running for governor, Sen. Alex Padilla, as well as Hillary Clinton, John Kerry, Al Gore, and Nancy Pelosi. He formed Shangri-La Entertainment, Shangri-La Music, and Shangri-La Construction, which later became Shangri-La Industries. \n\nBesides the $2.5 million Shangri-La Industries paid to Bill Clinton in 2009 and 2010, according to Forbes magazine, Bing also gave between $10 million and $25 million to the William J. Clinton Foundation in 2008.\n\nBing’s death is still shrouded in mystery. When the 55-year-old jumped to his death from the 27th floor of a luxury apartment building in Century City, he was nearly broke with only $300,000 in assets. Friends suggested he was depressed because of a lack of contact with people during the COVID lockdowns, but the true reason remains unknown.\n\nBing’s daughter, Kira Kerkorian, in a lawsuit filed against Abdul-Wahab, alleged that Bing sold Shangri-La Construction to him in 2017, but accused Abdul-Wahab of never paying the agreed-upon amount. The accusation raises questions about whether a dispute over the sales price contributed to Bing’s depleted funds, depression, and suicide. The lawsuit, however, was dismissed without prejudice, meaning that a judge terminated it, but Kira Kerkorian could decide to amend it and refile.\n\nSo far, Kerkorian hasn’t refiled. She was essentially disowned and disinherited by two fathers. Her mother, former tennis pro Lisa Bonder, was married to casino and media mogul Kirk Kerkorian, who was 48 years her senior, for only 28 days in 1999. When Bonder became pregnant, she insisted Kerkorian was the father and secured a $100,000-per- month child support agreement and established a $7 million trust for Kira.\n\nBut private detective Anthony Pellicano swiped a piece of dental floss used by Bing, a former boyfriend of Bonder, proving through DNA testing that Bing was Kira’s father. Kira was left with $8.5 million when Kerkorian died in 2015 at age 98.\n\nOne day after Bing died, Shangri-La Construction’s Instagram account eulogized Bing in a post titled, “With Heavy Hearts We Remember: Steve Bing.”\n\n“Endlessly generous and passionate about the people and causes he loved, he was truly a rolling stone — he belonged to nobody, but he gave a piece of himself to everyone and everything he crossed.” The post also promised that Shangri-La Industries would “never forget his passion for helping people,” and promised to “continue to advance this mission every day.”\n\nSusan Crabtree’s article first appeared on RealClearPolitics","summary":"For California Gov.

Ebhomien, an economist and financial expert, is a former Consultant to the United Nations Office on Project Services. In this interview with EJIKEME OMENAZU, a former World Bank/International Monetary Fund (IMF) expert speaks on the current state of the Nigerian economy, among other crucial national issues. Excerpt:\n\nHow do you see the current state of the economy? The Nigerian economy is currently facing severe challenges. There is the problem of higher exchange rate and high inflation. Also, there is also the challenge of insecurity that has affected every facet of the economy. The government should come up with appropriate mechanisms to address these problems. It is very unfortunate that many Nigerians are going through hardship and this has placed the economy in a precarious situation. Although the government is trying its best to fix the economy, it should go a step further to address these challenges and fix the economy. The reforms of President Tinubu, though very good, have caused hardship to the poor who find it difficult to afford three square meals a day. The government should try to provide some palliative measures such as cash transfers to the vulnerable and establish food banks in all local governments in the country. The government should live by example by ensuring sound fiscal discipline in all sectors of the economy. That is the way to go. President Bola Tinubu has continued his investment in tourism and foreign trips. Would you say the nation is gaining from these trips? Sincerely speaking, the president’s trips to other countries for investment are a good idea. But this should be translated into concrete actions. The government must try as much as possible to create the enabling environment for investors to invest their hard earned money. No investor will invest where there is a high level of banditry, high inflation and high interest rates. The government should set up a high level committee for an investment forum that will bring together foreign investors to rub minds with local investors at a time deemed necessary by the federal government. By doing so, the foreign investors will have the real opportunity to know what to expect from the Federal Government and the local investors. This interaction will help both parties to sign Memoranda of Understandings (MoUs). The International Monetary Fund (IMF) recently okayed Nigerian economic growth rate and the reforms of the President Bola Tinubu administration. How do you see the IMF/World Bank’s roles in Nigeria as many believe that these bodies do more harm than good to the country? The IMF has upgraded Nigeria’s growth forecast to 4.4% in 2026, citing improved macroeconomic conditions and reform momentum under President Bola Tinubu’s administration. The Fund attributes this growth to “macroeconomic stabilisation and continued reform efforts” across key economies. However, economists warn that Nigerians should be cautiously optimistic, as long standing economic issues like insecurity, high credit costs, and import duties remain significant barriers to realizing this growth. The IMF also notes that risks to the outlook are tilted to the downside, including escalating geopolitical tensions and high public debt. Tinubu’s policies, such as ending fuel subsidies and unifying the exchange rate, have been praised by the IMF for promoting macroeconomic stability. Yet, these reforms have also triggered a cost-of-living crisis, with inflation rates exceeding 23% in 2025. The government argues that these reforms are necessary for long-term economic stability, but critics argue that they have disproportionately affected average Nigerians. The IMF emphasizes the need for “rebuilding fiscal buffers” and pressing ahead with structural reforms without delay. The truth is that times are tough, and people need relief now. Short-term palliative measures could help ease the burden on struggling families. The government should make provisions for targeted subsidies, cash transfers, or establish food banks in all the local governments in the country. These measures, if carefully implemented, will certainly boost the people’s morale and build confidence in President Bola Ahmed Tinubu’s Administration What is your take on the U.S intervention in Insecurity in Nigeria? What do you see as the short and long run implications of this intervention? The US intervention on insecurity in Nigeria must be looked at from two extremes. At one extreme, one must commend US President, Donald Trump and his government for taking time to intervene in the Nigerian situation. But, the Federal Government must go a step further to put the Nigerian military architecture in such a way to ensure sole Nigerian insecurity problems on their own without relying external forces to meet these insecurity challenges. On the other extreme, the government should reach a serious agreement on the levels of engagements, discretion, plans and strategies to be adopted. All these must be stated in black and white. Sincerely, there should be a time frame for the US military involvement in the insecurity situation in Nigeria. My candid advice to the Federal Government and the Military authorities is to ensure that they procure modern and sophisticated, scientific weapons from the US and other countries that will help them meet the insecurity challenges. The Federal Government must also take a step further to engage our scientists and engineers to design and produce drones and other military weapons as being done in other civilised climes. The government should also provide the necessary funds or met these serious challenges. What is your view on President Bola Tinubu’s recent declaration that Nyesom Wike is the political leader of Rivers State, even as the former governor is not a member of his party, the APC? The declaration of Nyesom Wike as the political leader of Rivers State by President Bola Tinubu was a strategic political move geared towards 2027 general elections. You know, Wike is a political strategist that has grassroots support in Rivers State. He also has the structure required by a master strategist like Wike to win elections in Rivers State and other states. So, anybody that neglects Wike will be doing so at their own peril. President Tinubu as a master strategist of inestimable value has seen in Wike what he can to support his 2027 re-election. What the president is trying to do is to send a clear message that though Governor Fubara is the leader of APC in Rivers, he does not have much grassroots structure and support to win elections in Rivers State. In all honesty, Governor Fubara is not a master strategist. I am not trying to underrate him, but from what I have seen, Mr President must have seen that it will take a herculean effort for Fubara to sway elections for him in 2027 in Rivers. Even from the recent tour of Nyesom Wike of all local governments in Rivers State, you can see the massive support he has and the recent pronouncement made by Senator Magnus Abe that Chief Wike is the undisputable political leader in Rivers State. Looking at the role of Wike in the PDP crisis, it is clear that he is using a large chunk of the PDP supporters to beef up support for President Tinubu in 2027 elections, hence the PDP crisis may not come to an end so soon with its present parallel National Executive Council, Parallel National Working Committee (NWC) and Board of Trustees (BoT), one faction backed by Wike under the leadership of Senator Anyanwu as the National Secretary.\n\nWhat is your take on the New Tax Laws? \n\nThe rollout of Nigeria’s new tax laws has been a mixed bag. While the government had touted the reforms as ‘pro-people’ and aimed at simplifying taxation, critics argue that the implementation has been marred by controversy and confusion. Some of the teething issues include: Digital bottlenecks: Users reported slow response times on tax portals and difficulties with registration and data verification; Public confusion: Many small business owners and individuals remain unclear about new filing procedures and compliance timelines. There are also allegations of unauthorised changes: Opposition lawmakers claim that the gazetted laws contain insertions never approved by parliament, sparking concerns over constitutional breaches. Despite these challenges, the government has insisted on proceeding with the implementation, citing the need for tax reform to boost revenue and efficiency. The new laws aim to exempt 98% of Nigerian workers and 97% of small businesses from taxes or reduce their liabilities. For effective implementation of this new tax policy the government should adopt the following measures: The government needs to lead by example and prioritise transparency and accountability. Civic engagements are key to educating citizens and getting them on board with reform. Using professional advertising agencies can help simplify complex policies and reach a wider audience. Plus, they would know how to cut through the noise and get the message across effectively. Town hall meetings and community outreach programmes can provide a personal touch, allowing citizens to ask questions and get direct feedback. This can build trust and ensure everyone is on the same page. Social media can amplify the message and reach a broader audience, especially the youth. If properly harnessed, it can drive engagement and foster a sense of inclusivity.\n\n Would you say that with your party making inroads into the South East, President Bola Tinubu will have an easy win in the region come 2027 election?\n\nFrom all indications, President Tinubu and the APC are making serious inroads in the South East. With the recent defection of Governor Peter Mbah of Enugu State to the APC, it is glaring that APC come 2027 elections will garner significant victories in Ebonyi, Imo, Enugu and hopefully Anambra States. From what I can see, so far, it appears Governor Alex Otti of Abia may defect to APC, especially with the recent maneouvering that Governor Hope Uzodimma of Imo State at Abia State as well as the influence of Rt. Hon. Benjamin Kalu, the Deputy Speaker of the House of Representatives and Senator Orji Uzor Kalu, the Senator representing Abia North Senatorial zone. All these are political juggernauts who cannot be underestimated in the political equation of Abia State and South East. So, they can help to spring a surprise in favour of APC for Mr. President. We are keeping our fingers crossed to see what will transpire before the elections in 2027.\n\nHow do you see the need for Electoral Act amendment? \n\nI think there is a serious need for the amendment of the Electoral Act to meet the yearnings of Nigerians. There have been several complaints of irregularities in elections and of course, the malfunctioning of the BVAS and IREV Technologies as they concern election rigging. The amendment of the Electoral Act will go a long way in ensuring credibility of elections and boost people’s morale and confidence in elections. The agitation for the transmission of election results through BVAS or electronic transmission will go a long way in ensuring that election results are transmitted in an effective fashion.","summary":"2 Professor John Ebhomien is a chieftain of the All Progressives Congress (APC).

Email tips@dailymail.co.uk \nBy ALEX DOYLE - SENIOR SHOWBUSINESS REPORTER \n Published:00:35 GMT, 8 February 2026 |Updated:01:03 GMT, 8 February 2026 \n\nMargot Robbie has revealed her upcoming movie Wuthering Heights is far more raunchier than the book it's based off as she stares alongside Jacob Elordi.\nAustralian actor Margot, 35, shares the screen alongside fellow Aussie Jacob, 28, in the highly anticipated romantic film.\nIts director Emerald Fennell has taken the helm of a steamy adaptation of Emily Bronte's iconic novel, which is set for release on February 13.\nJacob stars as Heathcliff while Margot portrays Cathy in the flick, which is set on the Yorkshire moors.\nMargot has now revealed how she and her hunky co-star 'kiss a lot' on-screen in the adaption compared to the 1847 novel.\nSpeaking to The Sun, the Barbie actress admitted: 'They never really kissed in the book, but we kiss a lot. We kiss everywhere.\n\nMargot Robbie has revealed her upcoming movie Wuthering Heights is far more raunchier than the book it's based off as she stares alongside Jacob Elordi\n\nAustralian actor Margot, 35, shares the screen alongside fellow Aussie Jacob, 28, in the highly anticipated romantic film\n'And there's so many times where he just picks me up and puts me in a tree, or picks me up with one hand.\n'And I have to say, it is really nice, it makes you feel, 'Oh I'm light as a feather, I'm a tiny little thing'.' \nPrior to its release, Wuthering Heights has courted controversy due to the appearance of Cathy - who is a teenager in the book - and the fact that Heathcliff should be 'dark-skinned'. \nMeanwhile, asked if she prepares differently for romantic scenes, Margot told PEOPLE: 'No different to all the other scenes that we do. The movie kind of demands a lot of all of us.\n'My character essentially cries in every single scene, but no, it was a joy. I loved playing a character who kind of swings from one wild emotion to the other in an instant.'\nEarlier this week, Margot braved the black carpet for the film's premiere in a daring sheer Dilara Findikoglu gown with a Victorian-esque corset and green detailing made out of plaited hair and Archival Boucheron Brooches.\nThe actress shared that she was also wearing a replica of one of Charlotte Bronte's bracelets, which was thought to be made out of her sisters Emily and Anne's hair, and acted as the inspiration for the gown.\nAhead of its release, Margot and Jacob have displayed their sizzling chemistry in a string of red carpet appearances.\n\nMargot has now revealed how she and her hunky co-star 'kiss a lot' on-screen in the adaption compared to the 1847 novel by Emily Brontë \n\nDirector Emerald Fennell has taken the helm of a steamy adaptation of Emily Bronte's iconic novel, which is set for release on February 13\n\nJacob stars as Heathcliff while Margot portrays Cathy in the flick, which is set on the Yorkshire moors (pictured in London for its premiere on Thursday)\n\n Margot Robbie and Jacob's bizarre 'obsession' with each other as her husband 'cries for help' \nIn fact, it has led to some complaints from fans that the duo have taken inspiration from Sydney Sweeney's 'PR playbook,' after she put on a similarly cosy display with co-star Glen Powell in 2023 to promote their film Anyone But You.\nJacob himself recently raised eyebrows during a press interview when he declared the pair had a 'mutual obsession' while filming.\nSpeaking to Fandango, with Margot sitting nearby, he said he made sure he was never more than 10 metres away from the Barbie actress on set.\n'If you have the opportunity to share a film set with Margot Robbie, you're going to make sure you're within five to ten metres at all times,' he said.\n'Watching how she drinks tea, how she eats her food. When is it going to slip? And it never comes undone.'\nMargot RobbieJacob Elordi\n\nShare or comment on this article: \nMargot Robbie says Wuthering Heights adaptation is a LOT more raunchier than the book - revealing she and co-star Jacob Elordi 'kiss everywhere' in steamy movie\n\nAdd comment\n\nComments 10\n\n Share what you think\n\nWorst rated\n\nThe comments below have not been moderated.\n\nThe views expressed in the contents above are those of our users and do not necessarily reflect the views of MailOnline.\n\nAdd your comment\n\nEnter your comment\n\nBy posting your comment you agree to our house rules.\n\nSubmit Comment\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual.\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual\n\nWe will automatically post your comment and a link to the news story to your Facebook timeline at the same time it is posted on MailOnline.

It's up to him to fix it.","text":"Will Lewis&comma; the former CEO and publisher of the Washington Post&comma; had a terrible tenure at the paper. The two years he spent there&comma; which ended Saturday with a two-paragraph memo&comma; are chiefly notable for a series of cuts and layoffs&comma; culminating in a 30% bloodletting days ago.But let&apos;s be clear: This one is on Jeff Bezos.Most obviously&comma; that&apos;s because Bezos owns the Post&comma; and Bezos was the one who hired Lewis to run the business for him.Bezos was also the one signing off on Lewis&apos;s actions at the paper&comma; which mostly amounted to making the paper smaller while telling the staff that \"people are not reading your stuff.\"And slightly less obviously&comma; it was Bezos who dramatically worsened the Post&apos;s business outlook. He decided not to endorse a presidential candidate in 2024&comma; weeks before the election — a move that outraged many Post readers&comma; who saw the non-endorsement an attempt to cater to Donald Trump.That led to more than 250&comma;000 subscriber cancellations&comma; a huge problem for a paper whose circulation peaked at 3 million in 2021.The best case argument you could make for Lewis era at the Post&comma; if you are inclined&comma; would go something like this: Bezos&comma; who bought the Post in 2013 and then invested heavily in staff&comma; realized a few years ago that he now employed many more people than his business would support. So he brought Lewis in to do the grim work of shrinking the publication. Now that work is done&comma; so Lewis can do something else and Bezos can find someone to help the Post grow again.But the timing of Lewis&apos; departure — late afternoon on a Saturday&comma; following days of howling from Post employees and many others about Lewis and Bezos&apos; stewardship of the paper — suggests this was not a long-in-the-making move.And again&comma; whether Lewis jumped or was pushed doesn&apos;t matter in the end. The Washington Post is Jeff Bezos. He gets praise if things are going well — which&comma; for several years after his purchase&comma; seemed to be the case — and blame when it doesn&apos;t.Here I&apos;ll also point out that Bezos&comma; who has no problem being seen jet-setting around the world in a style befitting the world&apos;s fourth-richest man&comma; has been totally MIA during his paper&apos;s recent turmoil.On Saturday&comma; when the paper announced it had promoted Post CFO Jeff D&apos;Onofrio to acting publisher and CEO&comma; Bezos finally attached his name to a public statement&comma; promising that the new Post would thrive by giving readers things they wanted to read.\"The data tells us what is valuable and where to focus&comma;\" he said in a Post press release.That might qualify for an insight 30 years ago&comma; when newspapers were struggling to respond to the internet. Now that&apos;s table stakes&comma; and you would hope the guy who created Amazon has more up his sleeve.\"I have a bunch of ideas&comma;\" for the Post&comma; Bezos said in the fall of 2024. \"I&apos;m working on that right now.\"We&apos;re still waiting.","summary":"The world's fourth-richest man promised to save the Washington Post. Time for him to step up and do it.","url":"https://www.businessinsider.com/will-lewis-jeff-bezos-washington-post-blame-layoffs-endorsement-2026-2","image":"https://i.insider.com/6987dd41e1ba468a96aba2d4?width=1200&format=jpeg","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-02-08 01:02:00","author":"Peter Kafka","authors":["Peter Kafka"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.272},{"id":400496176,"title":"Jon Ossoff Tells Marjorie Taylor Greene ‘Welcome to the Resistance’","text":"Senator Jon Ossoff, a Georgia Democrat, at a recent rally hailed former Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene, a Georgia Republican, for her statements calling out MAGA voters and politicians, telling her: “Welcome to the resistance.“ Newsweek reached out to Greene's press team by email on Saturday afternoon for comment. Why It Matters Ossoff is the only Democratic senator up for reelection in 2026 from a state won by Donald Trump in the 2024 presidential election, making Georgia a top-tier battleground where Republicans hope to expand a narrow Senate majority. Once one of President Donald Trump’s closest allies, Greene’s departure from Congress earlier this year follows a public and bitter split with him over key issues like foreign policy. Her departure further narrowed an already thin majority for House Republicans. Then-Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene, a Georgia Republican, speaks during a hearing with the House Committee on Homeland Security in the Cannon House Office Building on December 11, 2025, in Washington, DC. (Photo by Anna Moneymaker/Getty Images) What To Know Ossoff launched his 2026 reelection effort while navigating a dual approach—criticizing Trump on some issues while emphasizing bipartisan work on Georgia priorities including agriculture and military installations. During his rally, which was posted to social media, Ossoff said of MAGA and Greene: “This is the most corrupt administration of all time and everybody knows it. Listen to what Marjorie Taylor Greene just said about MAGA last week. She said, 'I think people are realizing it was all a lie.' Welcome to the resistance.“ During an appearance last month on The Kim Iversen Show, the former congresswoman said about Trump's political movement, “I think people are realizing it was all a lie. It was a big lie for the people. What MAGA is really serving in this administration, who they’re serving, is their big donors.” She continued: “The big, big donors that donated all the money and continue to donate to the president’s PACs and donate to the 250th anniversary and are donating to the big ballroom,” later adding, “It’s the foreign countries. They are running the show here. It’s the major big corporations and what is best for the world. That’s really what MAGA is.“ Greene announced her departure from Congress in November 2025, finalizing her exit on January 5 of this year. In her statement about her decision, she discussed a number of grievances against the president and current Congressional leadership—particularly that Congress had been “sidelined“ during the first year of the new administration. Trump, meanwhile, welcomed her departure as “great news for the country.“ Battleground Georgia 2026 Speculation that Greene could run for Senate has figured into the political calculus around Ossoff’s reelection, with the Associated Press noting she is among possible Republican contenders after Georgia Governor Brian Kemp said he would not run. Kemp’s decision not to seek the seat removed a top-tier potential GOP challenger and left the Republican field unsettled, according to the AP. The AP also reported that Greene is among the Republicans discussed as possible candidates and that Ossoff has appeared to invite a challenge from the north Georgia lawmaker whose national profile is polarizing among swing voters. What People Are Saying Senator Jon Ossoff, a Georgia Democrat, on X: “Trump was supposed to fight for the working class. Instead, he's closing rural clinics and hospitals to cut taxes for George Soros and Elon Musk. This is a government of, by, and for the ultra-rich.“ Former Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene, a Georgia Republican, on X last month: “I objected on Jan 6, 2021 to Biden’s election and have consistently fought against election fraud. In September, I wrote a letter to the DOJ and FBI, urging for a formal investigation into Georgia’s 2020 election. I am glad to see they have finally acted in Fulton County.“ What Happens Next The GOP field remained fluid following Kemp’s decision, and Republicans were expected to test multiple lines of attack on issues ranging from immigration to transgender participation in sports as they seek to unseat Ossoff.

If prima facie jurisdiction exists, the institution proceeds even if the respondent says nothing,” Yan said.\nIt would therefore be possible for PPC to receive the award even if Panamanian authorities refuse to participate in the arbitration, she said.\nIn the Wednesday statement, PPC said the arbitration was based on the concession contract and legal framework that had been enshrined over nearly three decades as a “contract law”.\n“The Republic of Panama has breached the applicable contract and law,” the company said.\n“PPC seeks extensive damages based on an assessment of relevant financial data, subject to prompt resolution, and such other requests for relief as may prove necessary. PPC and its investors continue to permanently reserve all rights.”\nProfessor Shahla Ali, director of the University of Hong Kong’s arbitration and dispute resolution master’s programme, noted the success rate for commercial arbitration cases where investors brought claims against states was between 30 and 50 per cent.\nAli added that even if the arbitration proceeded in the absence of Panamanian authorities, the presiding institution would ensure that the non-participating party remained informed and provided multiple opportunities to participate.\nThe United States government has repeatedly vowed to “take back” control of the strategic waterway since Donald Trump returned to the presidency in January 2025.\nIn February last year, Panama withdrew from China’s Belt and Road Initiative.\nThe top Panamanian court’s ruling also follows an audit launched last month by the country’s comptroller general, who claimed that the concession generated US$3.78 billion for the operator between 1997 and 2023, while the country received only US$236 million.\nPPC rejected these findings, asserting that it had invested more than US$1.8 billion in infrastructure and complied with contractual obligations.","summary":"Hong Kong’s CK Hutchison could find it hard to secure compensation from Panamanian authorities over their decision to nullify its port operation, legal experts have said, noting that the arbitral tribunal it engaged lacks enforcement power and the issuance of damages may depend on the country’s own courts.\nThe conglomerate, led by Hong Kong tycoon Li Ka-shing’s family, said on Wednesday that its subsidiary, the Panama Ports Company (PPC), commenced arbitration against Panamanian authorities a...","url":"https://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/politics/article/3342710/ck-hutchison-set-hard-fight-secure-panama-port-deal-compensation-experts","image":"https://cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2026/02/06/4410ff5c-fd4c-48d1-865d-90a60b9a3941_a6d7232c.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-02-08 01:00:16","author":"Matthew Cheng","authors":["Matthew Cheng"],"language":"en","source_country":"cn","sentiment":-0.262}]}
