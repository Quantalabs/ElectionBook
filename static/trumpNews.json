Trump's comments marked a new low in relations between Bogota and Washington, which have frayed since Trump returned to office in January and since his administration launched a series of strikes on vessels allegedly transporting drugs in the Caribbean. The U.S. president said on social media that the United States would stop large-scale payments and subsidies to Colombia and Republican Senator Lindsey Graham, a close ally, said Trump will soon announce \"major tariffs\" on the country. Colombia currently pays 10% tariffs on most imports to the United States, the baseline level Trump has imposed on many countries. Hegseth wrote on X that the Pentagon had destroyed a vessel and killed three people on Friday \"in the USSOUTHCOM area of responsibility,\" which includes the Caribbean. He said the ship was affiliated with the leftist rebel group National Liberation Army and was involved in illicit narcotics smuggling, without offering evidence to back the claim.Live Events The Pentagon said it had nothing to add beyond Hegseth's initial post. COLOMBIA CONDEMNS TRUMP'S REMARKS \"President Gustavo Petro, of Colombia, is an illegal drug leader strongly encouraging the massive production of drugs, in big and small fields, all over Colombia,\" Trump wrote on Truth Social. \"The purpose of this drug production is the sale of massive amounts of product into the United States, causing death, destruction, and havoc,\" Trump wrote. Reuters could not immediately establish which payments Trump was referring to. Colombia was once among the largest recipients of U.S. aid in the Western Hemisphere, but the flow of money was suddenly curtailed this year by the shuttering of USAID, the U.S. government's humanitarian assistance arm. Colombia's Foreign Ministry condemned Trump's remarks as offensive and a direct threat to its sovereignty, and vowed to seek international support in defense of Petro and the country's autonomy. \"These accusations represent an extremely serious act and undermine the dignity of the president of Colombians,\" it said in a statement. The U.S. State Department referred questions to the White House, which did not immediately respond to a query. FRAUGHT RELATIONS Last month the United States revoked Petro's visa after he joined a pro-Palestinian demonstration in New York and urged U.S. soldiers to disobey Trump's orders. The U.S. administration's deadly strikes on boats in the Caribbean have also outraged Colombians. Many legal experts and human rights activists have condemned the extraordinary series of military actions, with Amnesty International describing it as murder on the high seas. Earlier this month, Petro said one of the strikes hit a Colombian vessel, an allegation the Trump administration denied. Petro condemned the most recent bombing, saying the boat belonged to a \"humble family\", not the National Liberation Army. He also hit back at Trump's remarks. \"Mr. Trump, Colombia has never been rude to the United States... but you are rude and ignorant to Colombia,\" Petro responded on X. \"Since I am not a businessman, I am even less a drug trafficker. There is no greed in my heart.\" Colombia is fighting its own longstanding drug problems. Last year, Petro pledged to tame coca-growing regions in the country with massive social and military intervention, but the strategy has brought little success. In September, Trump designated countries such as Afghanistan, Bolivia, Burma, Colombia and Venezuela among those the United States believes to have \"failed demonstrably\" in upholding counternarcotics agreements during the past year.

That hasn’t stopped Trump, a former New York real estate mogul, from threatening the $16 billion project.\n\n“I'm cutting the project,” Trump told FOX News. The full interview is set to air on FOX News Channel’s \"Sunday Morning Futures\" on Oct. 19.\n\n\"The project is going to be dead,\" he said. \"It is pretty much dead right now.\"\n\nTrump has made clear he wanted to send a message to Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-New York, who fought to get funds on Gateway. “Tell him it’s terminated,” the president said earlier this week.\n\nOn the Senate floor on Oct. 16, Schumer said the funding cut is \"petty revenge politics.\"\n\n\"Gateway is the most important infrastructure project in America, period,\" he said. \"It will keep our economy moving, our region connected, and tens of thousands of union workers on the job.\"\n\nThe project, set to build nine miles of new passenger rail track with a two-tube tunnel, is set to be completed by 2035. The old rail tunnel is expected to be fixed and back in service by 2038. The project has been billed as bringing tens of thousands of jobs, tens of billions of dollars in economic activity and increasing transit ridership with four tracks instead of the current two.\n\nStephen Sigmund, a spokesperson for the Gateway Development Commission, the public authority tasked with the project, declined to comment.\n\nThe White House, Office of Management and Budget and the Department of Transportation didn't immediately respond to email requests for comment.\n\nA central component of the largest regional economy\n\nEach day, hundreds of thousands of people ride Amtrak and New Jersey Transit trains crossing under the Hudson to and from Manhattan. The two existing century-old rail tunnels were damaged during Superstorm Sandy in 2012. If one track's tunnel were to fail, the nonprofit Regional Planning Association estimated it could cost $16 billion over four years, or about 33,000 jobs each year.\n\nAlthough Trump has campaigned on increased infrastructure spending − including specifically for mass transit in New York City − those promises have never been fulfilled. The self-described \"builder president\" tried to kill Gateway in his first term as well. The Trump administration in 2017 said the deal to fund the new tunnel between New York, New Jersey and the federal government was nonexistent, Crain's New York Business reported.\n\nWhile the project has faced threats to its funding for years, the Trump administration set its sights on the Hudson on the first day of the government shutdown.\n\nOn Oct. 1, the Transportation Department officials withheld grants to the Gateway project and the Second Avenue Subway construction, in Manhattan, citing New York City’s Disadvantaged Business Enterprise program, an equity initiative meant to expand participation in federally assisted contracts.\n\nIn an X post, Russ Vought, the director of the federal Office of Management and Budget, said the hold is meant to “ensure funding is not flowing based on unconstitutional DEI principles,\" referring to diversity, equity and inclusion.\n\nGrant disbursements for Gateway have been on hold since then, Sigmund said in an email. The commission is working with federal partners to comply with federal laws and regulations.\n\nMike Hellstrom, vice president and eastern regional manager of the Laborers’ International Union of North America, said the funding cut likely means delays for a multigenerational project, which means extra costs and potential job losses.\n\nThe project already has five active construction sites in New York, New Jersey and in the Hudson, he said. Shafts and portal entrances are being built ahead of boring machines expected to arrive around January.\n\n\"There's a lot on the line for us as working people,\" Hellstrom said. \"There's also a lot on the line for the rail riders.\"\n\nIn an Oct. 15 MSNBC interview, Gov. Kathy Hochul called Trump's threats on the new tunnel \"shortsighted.\"\n\n\"We need to replace them because if this system of transportation collapses, the Northeastern economy and the economy of the country collapses,\" she said.\n\nThe Metropolitan Transportation Authority, which is overseeing the Manhattan subway expansion, said funding for its tunnel-boring contract has already been approved.\n\nAcross the Hudson, the billion-dollar Gateway project has also become key in the closely watched New Jersey governor’s race between Democrat Mikie Sherrill and Republican Jack Ciattarelli.\n\n\"I’ll fight tooth and nail to get this funding back and complete this essential infrastructure project for our state, commuters, and economy,\" Sherrill, a current New Jersey Congress member, said in an X post.\n\nCiattarelli, a businessman and former state assembly member, has received Trump’s endorsement. But that didn’t stop him from vowing to fight for Gateway.\n\n\"New Jersey needs a Governor who has the standing to work with, and when necessary disagree with, the President and advocate for New Jersey’s fair share of federal tax dollars - including the Gateway Tunnel,\" he said in an X post.\n\nWith years fighting for the project, and political consensus now around it, Trump's actions wouldn't kill the project but would delay it, Alon Levy, a public transportation research scholar at New York University’s Marron Institute of Urban Management.\n\n\"Cancelation will not actually save money,\" Levy said.\n\n(This story was updated to add new information and to meet our standards.)\n\nEduardo Cuevas is based in New York City.

Dramatic developments that culminated in the US president’s visit to the Middle East and the ‘peace summit’ in Sharm el-Sheikh aroused hopes of an ‘era of peace.’ But that may be a distant possibility given the fragility of the ceasefire and the stumbling blocks facing the critical next phases of the peace process. \n\nThe peace declaration signed by Trump and leaders of Egypt, Qatar and Turkiye at Sharm el-Sheikh contains general principles. It states the commitment to implement the Trump peace agreement but without detailing or elaborating its various elements. The signing ceremony neither had a representative from Hamas nor Israel, the two parties to the ceasefire agreement. The ceasefire, in any case, marks the beginning of a process not its culmination. \n\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu proclaimed victory after Hamas released all the Israeli captives in exchange for Palestinian prisoners. But his commitment to honour the ceasefire and implement other steps of Trump’s 20-point plan, especially withdrawal from Gaza, is yet to be tested. His record is not encouraging. The last ceasefire in January was unilaterally ended by Israel after two months when it restarted its military onslaught. Tel Aviv also refused to negotiate further phases of what was earlier agreed. This time Hamas sought written guarantees that Israel would not resume fighting once hostages were released. But it was unable to secure this. Instead, it got verbal assurances from the Americans. It will need Trump’s sustained engagement and pressure on Netanyahu to keep the peace process on track. Trump has staked his prestige on the Gaza deal, casting it as a “historic dawn of a new Middle East”. But he is not known to involve himself in detail that the plan’s implementation will require in the weeks ahead. Trump’s attention span is famously short.\n\n With a fragile ceasefire in place, the path to peace in Gaza is strewn with formidable obstacles.\n\nThe next phase will involve intense negotiations to reach agreement on key aspects of the Trump plan, including demilitarisation of the territory, dismantling Hamas, pullout of Israeli forces from Gaza and deployment of a multinational stabilisation force. These are all vexing issues on which there is a yawning gap between the positions of Hamas and Israel. On Gaza’s post-conflict governance, convergence has yet to be evolved between the Palestinians/ Arab governments and Washington. The US has baulked at addressing the all-important issue of Palestinian statehood, for which Muslim countries want some assurance beyond the vague reference in Trump’s plan to “a pathway” to statehood.\n\nHamas is expected to disarm under the plan but has given no unequivocal assurance to give up arms as there is no commitment from Israel to withdraw from Gaza. Hamas leaders have indicated that without a comprehensive Israeli withdrawal from the territory they will not lay down their arms. A senior Hamas leader, Mousa Abu Marzouk, has said his organisation would only hand over weapons “if the occupation ends and Palestinians can govern themselves”. Others have said they want an iron-clad assurance about the establishment of a Palestinian state. \n\nTrump’s 20-point plan does not address how to sequence Gaza’s demilitarisation with an Israeli pullout. It does not specify a timetable to achieve these two evidently linked goals. This will have to be negotiated which will not be easy, especially as Netanyahu has not committed to a full withdrawal from Gaza. With Israeli officials already claiming Hamas is tightening control over areas that their forces initially vacated, Netanyahu can indefinitely delay the drawdown. Tel Aviv can even derail the process, citing lack of movement on disbanding Hamas. \n\nThere are also many unanswered questions about the ‘temporary stabilisation force’ envisioned for Gaza to secure the Strip. The US has already sent 200 troops to Israel to be deployed as part of the so-called civil-military coordination centre to help the stabilisation force monitor the ceasefire and oversee the peace. The terms and rules of engagement of the international stabilisation force (ISF) are purposely absent in the plan and will need to be thrashed out. Negotiations are said to be underway on this.\n\nWill this force have a UN mandate authorised by a Security Council resolution? Several Arab states have shown preference for that. Western members of the P5 are said to be working on a resolution to establish a stabilisation force but not one that operates under the UN flag. Any expectation for its role to involve counter-insurgency or disarm Hamas would be hard for potential troop-contributing countries to accept. No Muslim/ Arab state would want to be seen as acting against Palestinians on Israel’s behalf or protecting Israel. ISF’s size, composition, who will lead it, precise role and how long it is deployed all have to be figured out in negotiations. \n\nIts deployment has to be closely synchronised with the post-conflict governing arrangement in Gaza. Under the plan, a ‘Board of Peace’ headed by Trump is to supervise the temporary transitional governance by a committee of Palestinian technocrats and international experts who are to be responsible for day-to-day affairs. Again, who will constitute this committee and how legitimate will it be, are questions that still have to be grappled with. This international trusteeship arrangement, until a reformed Palestinian Authority takes over, will basically mean Gaza is run by outsiders for an unspecified period in a colonial-style enterprise. How viable this will be — and acceptable to the Palestinians — is an open question. Authority after all depends on legitimacy. \n\nThe challenges ahead are daunting. There are already signs of brewing trouble that can unravel the peace plan. Israel has continued to shell Gaza and kill Palestinians during the tenuous ceasefire and delayed full access for humanitarian aid. Hamas has handed over a list of Israeli violations to mediators. Israel has threatened to resume fighting if Hamas doesn’t comply with the deal. Echoing Israel’s threat, Trump has said he would allow Israel to restart military action if the organisation does not lay down its arms. All this suggests that the path to what Trump envisions as a “new dawn” in the Middle East remains a long and uncertain one. \n\nThe writer is a former ambassador to the US, UK and UN.\n\nPublished in Dawn, October 20th, 2025","summary":"HECTIC diplomacy and decisive intervention by President Donald Trump produced a ceasefire in Gaza after two years of a brutal Israeli military offensive that left over 67,000 Palestinians dead, a humanitarian catastrophe and total devastation.

He was seen golfing at his Trump International Golf Club on Saturday and Sunday, according to a White House pool reports.\n\nThe discovery of the tree stand comes a month after Ryan Routh was convicted in Fort Pierce, Florida, of attempting to assassinate Trump last September while the then-presidential candidate was golfing at his club in unincorporated West Palm Beach, just miles from the airport.\n\nThat incident followed another assassination attempt in July 2024, when a gunman opened fire during a campaign rally in Butler, Pennsylvania. Trump was grazed in the right ear, one supporter was killed, and two others were injured before Secret Service snipers fatally shot the 20-year-old assailant, Thomas Crooks.\n\nTrump returned to the White House Sunday evening.","summary":"Secret Service discovered suspicious tree stand before Trump’s arrival in Florida for the weekend","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/secret-service-tree-stand-trump-air-force-one-b2848206.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/10/19/23/01/trump-hunting-stand-air-force-one.png?crop=1200,800,x0,y50&trim=49,0,50,0&width=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/aJzxj7iC-OhrQWqOm.mp4","publish_date":"2025-10-20 00:00:07","author":"Andrea Cavallier","authors":["Andrea Cavallier"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.313},{"id":370759384,"title":"Trump is forced to board Air Force One via small stairs due 'increased security measures' after suspicious structure was discovered near airport","text":"President Donald Trump was forced to board Air Force One on Sunday via the small stairs due to heightened security measures after a suspicious hunting stand was discovered nearby.\n\nTrump left Palm Beach International Airport on Sunday to return to Washington D.C., after the suspicious structure was discovered on Friday.\n\nA White House official said the discovery led to the implementation of heightened security measures on Sunday as Trump returned to the airport. \n\nFBI Director Kash Patel said the 'elevated hunting stand' was 'within sight line of the Air Force One landing zone.\n\n'The FBI has since taken the investigatory lead, flying in resources to collect all evidence from the scene, and deploying our cell phone analytics capabilities.'\n\nThe stand has not been tied to any individual.\n\nIt was found perched in a tree near where Trump usually exits the presidential jet.

Email lettice.bromovsky@dailymail.co.uk \nBy LETTICE BROMOVSKY, NEWS REPORTER \n Published:00:54 BST, 20 October 2025 |Updated:00:54 BST, 20 October 2025 \n\nThe family of a Ukrainian teenager killed in an attack at a Dublin refugee centre have paid tribute to the 'kind, intelligent and well mannered' person he was. \nVadym Davydenko, 17, died last week following what authorities described as a 'serious incident' at a Tusla-run emergency accommodation facility in Grattan Wood, Donaghmede.\nTwo others - a teenage boy and a woman - were also taken to hospital with non-life-threatening injuries. \nPolice have confirmed that a teenager has been arrested on suspicion of murder.\nIn emotional posts shared on social media, Vadym's relatives said he had only recently finished school and moved to Ireland to start a new life.\n'He was just 17, he had just graduated from school and left to search for a better life in Ireland,' his cousin wrote.\n'He was kind, very intelligent and mannered, very fair. On November 1, he was supposed to celebrate his coming of age, but instead of greetings, parents are heartbroken, they do not know how to pick up and bury their child's body now.'\nEmergency services were called to the Tusla facility shortly after 11am, where they found several young people in distress. \nGardaí confirmed that one teenage male - understood to be of Somali origin - was arrested after receiving medical treatment. Officers have said they are not seeking anyone else in connection with the case.\n\nVadym Davydenko, 17, died last week following what authorities described as a 'serious incident' at a Tusla-run emergency accommodation facility in Grattan Wood, Donaghmede\nThe accommodation is part of Tusla's special emergency arrangements programme, which houses unaccompanied minors seeking asylum in Ireland. Vadym had only been in the country four days before the fatal incident occurred.\nA source told the Irish Daily Mail: 'It will be a number of days before investigating Gardaí can talk to the suspect to try and piece together why this happened because he's going to be under medical supervision for a while. He can't be questioned in that state.'\nA female staff member who reportedly tried to intervene in the attack was also hospitalised with defensive wounds.\nAt a memorial service held by Dublin's Ukrainian Orthodox community on Friday, mourners gathered to remember Vadym's short life.\nUkrainian priest Serhii Danilov said: 'It is very tragic, he tried to find a safe place and here he found his death.'\nParishioner Varvara Fadieieva added: 'We hope that we can ask God to give some comfort also to his family because I believe it's so hard for them and of course it's very painful to see such a young man die like that.'\nMichael Baskin, head of the Ukraine Crisis Centre in Ireland, told attendees: 'He came to Ireland for safety and for peace. He wasn't here on holidays, despite what some people might think.'\nA spokesperson for the Ukrainian Embassy in Dublin confirmed that Vadym's body will be repatriated to Ukraine once investigations conclude.\n'We express our deepest condolences to Vadym's family and loved ones during this time of profound grief,' the spokesperson said.\n'The embassy is in close contact with An Garda Síochána, who are currently investigating the circumstances of the incident. We are providing consular assistance to the family and are making the necessary arrangements for the repatriation of Vadym's body to Ukraine.'\nA local Facebook fundraiser has already raised more than €1,300 towards the estimated €8,000 cost of bringing Vadym home.\nFollowing the tragedy, calls are growing for an independent inquiry into how a fatal attack could happen inside a Tusla-run children's facility.\nTanya Ward, chief executive of the Children's Rights Alliance, said: 'This is really devastating and distressing news. At the heart of this is a 17-year-old boy who was in Ireland on his own. \n\nIn emotional posts shared on social media, Vadym's relatives said he had only recently finished school and moved to Ireland to start a new life\n'It is vitally important that the next step is an independent review by the National Review Panel to establish the circumstances of the death and whether there was any possibility to prevent it from happening.'\nDonaghmede councillor Micheál MacDonncha, of Sinn Féin, said Tusla must urgently investigate the circumstances.\n'It's essential Tusla enquire how this happened and if the place was resourced adequately,' he said. \n'It raises concerns that a private company was involved in the running of this centre. Regardless of the status of those living there in terms of nationality, what's more important is that they were juveniles.'\nTusla later confirmed that the Donaghmede unit was 'staffed on a 24-hour basis' to provide care for four unaccompanied minors. The other residents have since been moved to alternative accommodation.\nA source close to Vadym told reporters that he was 'quite into sport' and had been studying IT. \nHe had dreams of working in cybersecurity and one day using his skills to help defend Ukraine 'on the frontlines in a cyberdivision.'\nHe also had a girlfriend back home who is said to be 'devastated' by his death.\n\nShare or comment on this article: \nUkrainian teenager, 17, who was stabbed to death 'by a Somalian migrant' in Ireland 'had fled his war-torn country for a better life'\n\nAdd comment\n\n Share what you think\n\nNo comments have so far been submitted.

'The Sharks organization sincerely apologizes for this oversight, and we are actively working to determine the origin of the message.'\n\nThe fan message was posted on 'Los Tiburones Night,' which is the team's ninth annual celebration of Hispanic heritage.\n\n One diehard Sharks fan said she and her friends were 'appalled' by the display.\n\n'They're my favorite team — I even have tattoos — but this was something that should've been caught,' Jessica Clark told CNN.\n\nIt also came amid growing tensions between ICE agents and Californians, who protested the agency and President Donald Trump's immigration crackdowns across the state during Saturday's 'No Kings' demonstrations.\n\nMore than 170 US citizens have been held by ICE agents, according to a recent report by ProPublica.\n\nGeorge Retes, an American combat veteran working security on a legal marijuana farm in California, said he was held for three days by ICE officials, whom he claims knew he was a citizen.\n\n'They didn't care,' Retes told ProPublica.\n\nThe Department of Homeland Security has since claimed Retest was arrested because he was 'violent' and 'refused to comply with law enforcement.'\n\nSan Jose has been the sight of several ICE operations in 2025.\n\nEarlier this month, the San Jose City Council approved a plan for ICE to operate within its limits provided agents remove their masks and identify themselves.\n\n'San Jose has a responsibility to lead on this issue,' District 5 Councilmember Peter Ortiz said at the time, as quoted by NBC's Bay Area affiliate. 'Our residents, regardless of their background, status or neighborhood, deserve to know that those who enforce the laws are held to the highest standard of transparency and accountability.'\n\nAround 41 percent of San Jose residents are foreign born, according to District 8 Councilmember Domingo Candelas.\n\n'If you have your papers, your legal ability to be here, but you speak with an accent, you may be targeted,' Candelas said at a city council meeting earlier in the month. 'And so that's what I walk in fear of when my parents leave the house.'\n\nA recent Pew Research Center poll found 72 percent of Republicans had a favorable view of ICE, while 13 percent Democrats approved of the agency tasked with Trump's immigration crackdown.","summary":"The NHL's San Jose Sharks have issued an apology to fans after a message appearing to support ICE flashed on the scoreboard during Hispanic heritage night on Saturday.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/nhl/article-15207263/San-Jose-Sharks-issue-apology-ICE-Hispanic-Heritage.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/10/20/00/103125775-0-image-m-24_1760916450424.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-10-19 23:27:46","author":"Alex Raskin,Editor","authors":["Alex Raskin","Editor"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.267},{"id":370759600,"title":"David Beckham downs shots and pokes fun wife Victoria's lack of cooking skills as he single-handedly prepares the family's Sunday lunch - after daughter Harper joked Posh could 'burn water'","text":"Home and Garden\n\nKim Kardashian\n\nVictoria Beckham\n\nHarry Styles\n\nAmanda Holden\n\nPrivacy Policy\n\nMonday, Oct 20th 2025\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPolice must launch criminal probe into Prince Andrew's 'dirt digging' bid on Virginia Giuffre, ex-head of Royal Protection demands: Disgraced ex-Duke 'must be quizzed under caution over serious matter'\n\nDonald Trump urged Zelensky to accept Putin's terms to end their war or risk 'destroying' Ukraine in 'shouting match' White House meeting\n\nMale migrant who posed as a female nurse and worked in A&E department for months avoids jail\n\nI'm single, child-free and happy at the age of 49... and it makes men furious!

Gavin Newsom criticizing the Trump administration for holding the display, and Newsom drawing criticism himself for the freeway closure.\n\n“This was an unusual and concerning situation,” CHP Border Division Chief Tony Coronado said Sunday. “It is highly uncommon for any live-fire or explosive training activity to occur over an active freeway. As a Marine myself, I have tremendous respect for our military partners, but my foremost responsibility is ensuring the safety of the people of California and the officers who protect them.”\n\nNo injuries were reported.\n\nCHP personnel immediately notified the Marine Corps at the scene, who then canceled firing additional live ordnance over the freeway, and the area was swept for further evaluation, the CHP said. The agency has filed an internal report on the incident, with a recommendation to conduct an additional after-action review into the planning, communication and coordination between federal, state, and local government around Saturday’s event, “to strengthen protocols for future demonstrations and training events near public roadways.”\n\nA spokeswoman for the First Marine Expeditionary Force at Camp Pendleton told the New York Times the Corps was aware of the report of a possible airborne detonation, and an investigation was underway.\n\nVance attended Saturday’s demonstration, along with Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth and other top military officials. Vance and his family departed Marine Corps Air Station Miramar on Sunday morning for the five-hour flight back to Washington D.C. He made no public remarks before departing.\n\nSaturday’s celebration was dubbed “From Sea to Shore: A Review of Amphibious Strength,” and honored both the 250th birthday of the Marines and the U.S. Navy. The Navy turned 250 on Monday, and the Marines will do the same on Nov. 10.\n\n“God bless you Marines, God bless you Camp Pendleton. It is so much fun and such an honor to be out here and to celebrate 250 years of the United States Marines,” Vance said during the ceremony. “I bring greetings today from our commander in chief, Donald J. Trump and he wanted me tell each and every single one of you that he’s proud of you, that he loves you and despite the Schumer shutdown, he’s going to do everything he can to make sure you get paid exactly as you deserve.\n\n“For two-and-a-half centuries now, this beloved corps has served as our nation’s sharp edge. Always forward deployed, always ready, and always faithful.”\n\nWith live ammunition set to be fired over the freeway, state officials originally announced that they would close Interstate 5 for safety reasons from 11 a.m. to 3 p.m. Saturday from Harbor Drive to Basilone Road. Traffic immediately backed up after the closure as motorists lost the main thoroughfare connecting south Orange County to San Diego County, and Caltrans later opened the freeway in the early afternoon, but with traffic breaks.\n\nNewsom, a frequent critic of President Donald Trump and a possible presidential candidate in 2028, criticized the planned display earlier Saturday.\n\n“The president is putting his ego over responsibility with this disregard for public safety. Firing live rounds over a busy highway isn’t just wrong — it’s dangerous,” Newsom said. “Using our military to intimidate people you disagree with isn’t strength — it’s reckless, it’s disrespectful and it’s beneath the office he holds. Law and order? This is chaos and confusion.”\n\nBut some Republicans blamed Newsom for the freeway closure, calling it an over-reaction.\n\n“The Marines at Camp Pendleton have been firing live rounds and training beneath I-5 for over 50 years — without closing the freeway. There is zero reason for this sudden shutdown,” San Diego County Supervisor Jim Desmond posted on X. “This isn’t just an inconvenience — it’s going to cause medical emergencies to be delayed, workers to miss shifts and families to have their plans and events ruined.\n\n“It sure looks like Gavin Newsom is trying to use the U.S. Marine Corps’ 250th anniversary to create chaos and score political points. If that’s the case, it’s a petty stunt that will only hurt Southern California drivers and families,” he added.\n\nDesmond also said the shutdown “shows exactly what’s wrong with politics. No accountability, no planning — just finger pointing.”\n\nRep. Darrell Issa, R-Bonsall, also blasted Newsom on Saturday.\n\n“Gavin Newsom – who never served a day in the military – is overruling the best-trained and most experienced leaders of our Marine Corps and shutting down the main interstate highway in the San Diego region for no other reason that a spiteful publicity stunt,” Issa said.\n\n“It’s a disgusting abuse of power. But not at all surprising.”\n\nNewsom fired back Sunday after the ordnance mishap was reported.\n\n“We love our Marines and owe a debt of gratitude to Camp Pendleton, but next time, the Vice President and the White House shouldn’t be so reckless with people’s lives for their vanity projects,” he posted on X.","summary":"No injuries were reported.","url":"https://www.ocregister.com/2025/10/19/ordnance-fired-over-5-freeway-at-camp-pendleton-prematurely-detonates-striking-chp-vehicle/","image":"https://www.ocregister.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/OCR-Z-ORDNANC-1020-16x9-1-1.jpg?w=1600&resize=1600,900","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-10-19 23:24:27","author":"City News Service","authors":["City News Service"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.355},{"id":370754958,"title":"Palestinian President Renews Call for Commitment to Ceasefire, Withdrawal of Occupation Forces","text":"Ramallah, October 19 (QNA) - Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas renewed his call for commitment to the first phase of US President Donald Trump's plan, which includes consolidating the ceasefire in Gaza, allowing aid to enter, withdrawing occupation forces, and embarking on reconstruction.\n\nDuring his meeting today with UN Under-Secretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs and Emergency Relief Coordinator Tom Fletcher, the Palestinian President affirmed the readiness of the State of Palestine's institutions to assume their full responsibilities in the Gaza Strip and to connect with the West Bank through Palestinian laws, institutions, and personnel, with Arab and international support.\n\nHe also affirmed Palestine's readiness to work with the US President and all mediators and partners to complete the next phase, leading to lasting peace in accordance with international peace resolutions.\n\nThe Palestinian President stressed the importance of the role played by United Nations organizations, noting the importance of the role of the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA) during this critical period.\n\nThis role is indispensable in providing humanitarian aid and restoring the educational process, in addition to all the services it provides to Palestinian refugees in the Gaza Strip and the West Bank, including East Jerusalem, and to all host countries.

'We see it all the time - he will not want to leave.\n\n'He set it up with, I guess he's the Goebbels of the cabinet, Stephen Miller. He's a Nazi... He is and he's Jewish and he should be ashamed of himself.'\n\nGoebbels was one of Hitler's closest allies and a radical antisemite who pushed for harsher treatment of Jewish people. After Hitler committed suicide, Goebbels served one day as Chancellor of Germany before poisoning his six children and committing suicide to avoid legal retribution for his crimes. \n\nMiller has led the Trump administration's crackdown on illegal immigration and serves as the president's deputy chief of staff.\n\n'It's all nonsense. We know it's all racist. I mean, that's what he appeals to, that's what Trump is,' De Niro said. 'What you see is what you get. It's not going to change.' \n\nHe's also been a strong advocate for expanding travel bans and raising the vetting standards for who can enter the US, often targeting Muslim-majority countries. \n\nMiller and his wife Katie, a former Republican communications official and DOGE staffer, have condemned the left for villainizing them to the point that they've felt unsafe in their own home.\n\nOn at least two occasions this year activists have written chalk messages of protest in front of his Arlington, Virginia home and in a nearby park.\n\nMessages included phrases like 'Stephen Miller is destroying democracy,' 'stop the kidnapping,' 'no white nationalism,' 'we [love] immigrants,' and 'trans rights are human rights.'\n\nA few days after Charlie Kirk was assassinated in Utah, chalk messages began appearing, prompting Katie to share a defiant message on social media.\n\n'To the 'Tolerant Left' who spent their day trying to intimidate us in the house where we have three young children: We will not back down. We will not cower in fear. We will double down. Always, For Charlie,' she posted on X in mid-September, alongside the post was a video showing several of the messages being washed away with a garden hose.\n\nIn the wake of the threats, the couple have now listed their home for sale and have reportedly already moved out. \n\nDe Niro's comments come on the back of nationwide 'No Kings' protests railing against the administration.\n\nPeople carrying signs with slogans such as 'Nothing is more patriotic than protesting' or 'Resist Fascism' packed into New York City's Times Square and rallied by the thousands in parks in Boston, Atlanta and Chicago. \n\nDemonstrators marched through Washington and downtown Los Angeles and picketed outside capitols in several Republican-led states, a courthouse in Billings, Montana, and at hundreds of smaller public spaces.\n\nTrump's Republican Party disparaged the demonstrations as 'Hate America' rallies, but in many places the events looked more like a street party. \n\nThere were marching bands, huge banners with the U.S. Constitution's 'We The People' preamble that people could sign, and demonstrators wearing inflatable costumes, particularly frogs, which have emerged as a sign of resistance in Portland, Oregon.\n\nIt was the third mass mobilization since Trump's return to the White House and came against the backdrop of a government shutdown that not only has closed federal programs and services but is testing the core balance of power, as an aggressive executive confronts Congress and the courts in ways that protest organizers warn are a slide toward authoritarianism.\n\nTrump, meanwhile, was spending the weekend at his Mar-a-Lago home in Florida.\n\n'They say they're referring to me as a king. I'm not a king,' the president said in a Fox News interview.\n\nA Trump campaign social media account mocked the protests by posting a computer-generated video of the president clothed like a monarch, wearing a crown and waving from a balcony.","summary":"The liberal Oscar winner, 82, Stephen Miller to Adolf Hitler's chief propagandist Joseph Goebbels on MSNBC's The Weekend on Sunday.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-15206913/robert-niro-stephen-miller-trump-nazi-goebbels.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/10/19/23/103124353-0-image-m-19_1760912700036.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-10-19 23:11:48","author":"Brittany Chain,Editor","authors":["Brittany Chain","Editor"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.003},{"id":370756768,"title":"Trump urged Zelenskyy to make concessions to Russia in tense meeting","text":"Washington - U.S. President Donald Trump pushed Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy to give up swaths of territory to Russia during a tense meeting on Friday that left the Ukrainian delegation disappointed, according to two people briefed on the discussion.Trump also declined to provide Tomahawk missiles for Ukraine's use, and mused about giving security guarantees to both Kyiv and Moscow, comments that the Ukrainian delegation found confusing, added the two sources, who requested anonymity to discuss a private conversation.After his meeting with Zelenskyy, Trump publicly called for a ceasefire on the current front lines, a position that the Ukrainian president then embraced in comments to reporters.

After the presidential pardon and clemency were handed down to some Nigerians and a few foreigners, intense controversy had erupted. Indeed, some commentators and analysts have been so vocal against the clemency, particularly as it relates to drug trafficking and capital offence convicts. Following the consultation with the Council of State on Thursday, October 11, President Bola Tinubu granted some reprieve to 175 persons. The reprieve was based on the recommendations of the Presidential Committee on the Prerogative of Mercy, headed by the Attorney-General and Minister of Justice, Prince Lateef Fagbemi. Pardoned posthumously by President Tinubu were foremost nationalist Sir Herbert Macaulay; poet and soldier Major-General Mamman Vatsa; the writer and environmentalist, Ken Saro-Wiwa and his eight fellow Ogoni activists, as well as the four Ogoni leaders considered his antagonists. Also pardoned were some jailed illegal miners, public officials found guilty of corruption, remorseful drug offenders and capital offence convicts, including Maryam Sanda, who is on death row for killing her husband in 2017 in a matrimonial row. The last two categories are the most controversial. I will dwell on them shortly.\n\nThe list of beneficiaries of the presidential reprieve is long and comprehensive. The committee went as far back as what transpired during the pre-independence era. For instance, the pardon granted to Macaulay corrected the historic injustice done to him by the British Colonialists. The case of the Ogoni 4 and Ogoni 9 killings that occurred in November 1995 during the military dictatorship of late General Sani Abacha was to engender complete reconciliation in Ogoniland. This presidential gesture has been widely applauded in Ogoniland and the entire South-South geopolitical zone. Presidential Spokesman Bayo Onanuga had explained in the statement announcing the pardon that President Tinubu granted the clemency because most of the convicts had shown sufficient remorse and good conduct. Others were due to old age, acute medical conditions, acquisition of new vocational skills or enrolment in the National Open University.\n\nIt must be pointed out that the presidency fully disclosed the pardon as a matter of full disclosure and transparency. Some other governments will typically mask the complete list, knowing it would generate controversy. This open gesture signifies that the Tinubu government has nothing to hide. Contrary to the erroneous suggestions by some people, there was no ulterior or political motive to the pardon. However, whether in Nigeria or other jurisdictions where presidents have the power to exercise the prerogative of mercy, the exercise is always controversial. A similar storm was ignited during the Second Republic when President Shehu Shagari pardoned former warlord Chukwuemeka Odumegwu-Ojukwu for his role in the country’s 30-month civil war. Public outrage also greeted the full and unconditional pardon granted in 2013 by former President Goodluck Jonathan to his former boss and ally, the late Bayelsa governor Diepreye Alamieyesiegha, who was convicted of stealing millions of dollars.\n\nThe presidential pardon and the response it usually elicits are no different internationally, particularly in the United States. President Bill Clinton reportedly signed 140 pardons on January 20, 2001, his last day in office. This included one for his younger half-brother, Roger Clinton, who was convicted in 1985 for cocaine possession and drug trafficking. According to Newsweek, such was Roger Clinton’s notoriety that the US Secret Service codenamed him “Headache” because of the constant trouble he gave President Clinton in office. Former US President Biden pardoned his son, Hunter Biden, after he had publicly pledged not to do so. Hunter Biden was convicted between January 1, 2014, and December 1, 2024, of offences, including gun running. President Biden also reportedly pardoned his other relatives who were convicted of sundry offences. In his first term, President Donald Trump, in December 2020, pardoned Charles Kushner, the father of Jared Kushner, who is married to his daughter, Ivanka Trump. Jared Kushner was convicted of illegal campaign funding, tax evasion and witness tampering. All the pardons were intensely controversial.\n\nBack home, the present clemency for some drug offenders, along with that of Maryam Sanda, has emerged as the most contentious. For instance, in his seeming desperation to nail the government over Maryam Sanda’s pardon, last Tuesday, October 14, a columnist in Leadership newspaper, Abdulrauf Aliyu, went overboard in an article centred on Sanda’s pardon. It was titled “The Theatre of Presidential Pardon.” The columnist lied that the pardon was granted to Sanda before the final determination of the case, claiming that the case was still pending before the Supreme Court. He proceeded on that wrong premise and argued that the government tempered the law for mercy. Nothing can be further from the truth! This is a rather sad commentary for a columnist who should know better. The Supreme Court has since affirmed the judgment of the Appeal Court confirming Sanda’s conviction. Sanda’s pardon is well-intentioned. Apart from the reports that Sanda had shown remorse in prison, it has also emerged that her father-in-law, Alhaji Ahmed Bello Isa, the father of the late Bilyaminu Bello, sought clemency for her. Alhaji Isa has disclosed that he personally appealed to both Presidents Muhammadu Buhari and Tinubu to grant her pardon so she can take care of the two children left behind by his son. He said the continued stay of her daughter-in-law or indeed her death would not bring back Bilyaminu.\n\nAlso, the convicted drug offenders have spent time in jail. Some of them have even enrolled in the Open University or learned a new trade. It would be unfair to argue that former drug trafficking offenders who have shown remorse and turned a new leaf do not deserve mercy or forgiveness. Clemency for them, in my view, does not mean the war against drug trafficking has been compromised. The law remains that anyone indulging in illicit drugs will have a date with the law. The National Drug Law Enforcement Agency (NDLEA) under General Buba Marwa (rtd) is doing a yeoman’s job trying to ensure drug traffickers are brought to book and the country is free of hard drugs and their menace. Instructively, the AGF and Minister of Justice, Prince Lateef Fagbemi, whose committee recommended the pardon, has affirmed that the list is still subject to review. \n\nNone of the pardoned inmates has been released. He said the process is undergoing the final administrative review to satisfy the required legal and procedural standards before the release instruments are signed and issued. The list of those pardoned has to be gazetted by the government. Until that is done, there is still ample room for review. President Tinubu will not be averse to any required review\n\nThe President was moved by compassion and his legendary kind-heartedness in approving the pardon. There is no evidence that he has an offspring, blood relation, or known associate on the pardon or clemency list. The opposition politicians, who have also been very strident in criticising President Tinubu over the pardon, will continue to do so even when confronted with the fundamental justification for the action.

CNN host over idea Trump gave him 'favorable treatment'","text":"Newly freed ex-congressman George Santos didn't take kindly Sunday to a CNN question about President Donald Trump's \"favorable\" commutation of him, saying there would always be \"pearl-clutching\" critics and attacking President Joe Biden's blanket pardon of his family members before leaving office. In announcing he had commuted Santos' sentence, Trump pointed to Santos' willingness to \"ALWAYS VOTE REPUBLICAN\" while calling him \"somewhat of a rogue,\" leading critics to say Trump was engaging in blatant partisan favoritism. \"There are a lot of people who are really unhappy about your commutation because they see it as President Trump giving favorable treatment to you because you’re a loyal ally of his,\" CNN's Dana Bash told Santos on \"State of the Union.\" \"You know what?\" Santos replied. \"I say this, and I hate that we have to go down this road. And then there’s a lot of people who were upset with President Biden who pardoned his entire family before he left office in an unprecedented move. So pardon me if I’m not paying too much attention to the pearl-clutching of the outrage of my critics and of the people, predominantly on the left, who are going to go out there and try to make a big deal out of something like this.\" GEORGE SANTOS VOWS NOT TO ‘DISAPPOINT’ TRUMP AFTER SURPRISE RELEASE, SAYS HE FOUND GOD IN PRISON Santos noted Biden pardoned his embattled son Hunter Biden after previously promising he wouldn't. \"I didn't see outrage,\" Santos said, before Bash quickly cut in, noting there was sharp criticism of the former president for breaking his pledge. \"There was some outrage because there was a lot of people literally licking their wounds, because they had said, ‘you see, he’s magnanimous, and he’s not going to do it. He’s all about the right thing.’ So he lied,\" Santos said. \"So I’m not going to debate this… Look, there’s always going to be critics. People are going to like me. People are going to hate me. It doesn’t matter whoever gets clemency in the future, or whoever that person might be. I’m pretty confident if President Trump had pardoned Jesus Christ off the cross, he would have had critics. So that’s just the reality of our country.\" GEORGE SANTOS EXPRESSES GRATITUDE TO TRUMP FOLLOWING COMMUTATION OF HIS 7-YEAR PRISON SENTENCE Bash seemed amused at Santos invoking Jesus in his comparison before moving on. Santos thanked Trump and also mentioned his own Christian faith in a lengthy social media post after his commutation was announced. The disgraced former New York lawmaker had begun earlier this year to serve a seven-year prison sentence after pleading guilty to aggravated identity theft and wire fraud. He also previously admitted to embellishing or outright fabricating large parts of his resumé and life story.

Everyone I saw 100% loves our country. And as is our country’s custom, if you don’t agree with what your government is doing, then you peacefully protest, and that’s how it should be. We are the democracy, we the people.”\n\nKerr had sarcastically remarked that he must “hate America” when revealing his plans following Friday’s preseason finale, mocking a talking point made by current Speaker of the House Mike Johnson, who called the events “I hate America” rallies. \n\nIt is not the first time this year that Kerr has expressed his disagreement with Trump and his administration. \n\nBack in April after defeating the Grizzlies in the play-in tournament, Kerr wore a Harvard shirt to the postgame podium, showing support to a university that was under fire by the administration. \n\nSix months later, Kerr described his actions at the Embarcadero Square in downtown San Francisco as patriotic. \n\n“I think its been proven that, you know, there’s a lot of sway out there right now, whether its from the media or political pressure,” Kerr said. “We have to be the ones who can push things forward. And the way to do that is to peacefully protest, make your voice heard. That’s what I saw yesterday. It was a beautiful day.” \n\nKuminga, Butler update\n\nJonathan Kuminga and Jimmy Butler both scrimmaged Sunday morning, and are on pace to play against the Lakers in the team’s regular season opener in Los Angeles on Tuesday. \n\n“They both looked good,” Trayce Jackson-Davis said. “JK played really, really well. He was defending, getting to the rim, made nice pullup jumpers and stuff of that nature. The aggressiveness was there.”\n\nThey both missed the finale with ankle injuries, and Butler did not play in the final three preseason games due to a combination of injuries and an excused personal reason. \n\nStarting lineup is in flux\n\nKerr kept things close to the vest when describing the starting lineup. Moses Moody did not practice and will not play against the Lakers. Steph Curry, Green and Butler (if healthy) are all presumed starters. \n\nPodziemski will likely start at shooting guard, but the fifth starter is still up in the air. Kuminga is a candidate, should Kerr opt to play Green at center. Kerr reiterated the team’s desire to keep Al Horford’s minutes to around 20, which is the reason he is not a lock to start. \n\n“If you start a guy who is playing 20 minutes, its hard to space out the minutes over 48, and he ends up sitting for a long time,” Kerr said.","summary":"Steve Kerr was one of thousands in the Bay Area who participated in Saturday’s ‘No Kings’ protest","url":"https://www.mercurynews.com/2025/10/19/no-kings-protest-steve-kerr-warriors-donald-trump-san-francisco/","image":"https://www.mercurynews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/BNG-L-WARRIORS-1001-3.jpg?w=1600&resize=1600,900","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-10-19 22:50:44","author":"Joseph Dycus","authors":["Joseph Dycus"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.077},{"id":370752470,"title":"‘No Kings’ Protester Reportedly Says He’d Kill White House Deputy Chief Of Staff Stephen Miller","text":"A protester at Saturday’s “No Kings” rally in Seattle was recorded telling a reporter he apparently wanted to kill White House Deputy Chief of Staff Stephen Miller.\n\nDozens of protests against President Donald Trump and his administration’s policies took place Oct. 18 nationwide. Journalist Brandi Kruse posted the video of the protester being interviewed while holding a sign which read, “Would You Like To Kill Nazis [With] Me?” (RELATED: Rachel Maddow Calls Anti-ICE Rioters Peaceful Despite Videos Showing Clashes With Law Enforcement)\n\n“Who are you gonna kill?” Kruse asked in the video. “Nazis,” the man responded.\n\n“Who do you define as a Nazi?” the reporter followed up, to which the man asked, “What do you mean?”\n\nDuring multiple campaigns, including the 2024 presidential election and the 2022 midterm elections, numerous Democrats sought to cast President Donald Trump and other Republicans as fascists or threats to democracy.\n\n“In this context, who is a Nazi?” Kruse asked. “Stephen Miller is a Nazi,” the protestor responded.\n\n“You’re going to kill Stephen Miller,” the reporter repeated, apparently stunned, before the protester replied, “If I had the chance, yeah, I would.”\n\nKruse later reported the FBI was investigating the man’s threats. Kruse also posted a video showing another protester who said killing Miller would be “justifiable.”\n\nMiller and his family were forced to move from their home in Arlington, Virginia after a being targets of a harassment campaign. The intense effort included written messages like, “Stephen Miller is destroying democracy,” “No white nationalism,” and “Trans rights are human rights” on public sidewalks near his residence, along with posting flyers that reportedly listed his home address.\n\nAnother “No Kings” protester said that for her birthday, she wanted to wake up the next morning to read Trump’s obituary, according to a video posted Saturday by The Maine Wire.\n\n“You’re wishing that President Trump is dead?” the reporter asked her in the video. The protestor replied, “Yes. Absolutely.” (RELATED: ‘That’s Assassination Prep Language!’: Journalist Shuts Down Dem Rep On CNN Over Rhetoric)\n\nAt separate “No Kings” event in Chicago, a man reportedly urged attendees to shoot U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents.\n\n“You gotta grab a gun, we gotta turn around the guns on this fascist system. These ICE agents gotta get shot and wiped out,” the man, who stood in front of a banner for the Progressive Labor Party, apparently said. “The same machinery that’s on full display right there has to get wiped out.”\n\nAnother “No Kings” protester in Chicago seemingly made a “neck shot” gesture at counter-protesters who unveiled a flag honoring Turning Point USA founder Charlie Kirk, according to a video originally posted to Instagram before it was reposted on X by reporter Colin Rugg. Kirk was assassinated Sept. 10 whie debating college students at Utah Valley University.\n\nICE facilities in Chicago and Portland, Oregon have recently become the scene of multiple riots as opposition to the agency’s operations targeting illegal immigrants intensified. Some of the rioters in Chicago called for ICE agents to be arrested or shot in, according to a video posted online during one of the riots.\n\n HIGHLIGHT VIDEO: ‘No Kings’ protests today in the Washington, D.C. area. 👇 pic.twitter.com/qRaamxjT47 — Daily Caller (@DailyCaller) October 18, 2025 \n\nTwo people were killed during a Sept. 24 shooting at the ICE office in Dallas, including the gunman taking his own life. There were two previous incidents where shots were fired at ICE or Border Patrol facilities in Texas since July 4, 2025.

I was angry and sad. I was enraged and heartbroken that this man had given more than 50 years of his life to serving the American people, and in the end he’d been treated poorly by members of his own party. It was horrible,” Jean-Pierre wrote.\n\nIn her new book, “Independent,” Jean-Pierre revealed that she never thought Biden would drop out. Jean-Pierre repeatedly touted Biden’s physical and mental viability over the years from her position behind the podium, but his cognitive decline wound up dearly costing his party.\n\nNevertheless, Jean-Pierre thought Biden had been betrayed.\n\n“The Democratic Party had defined my life, my career,” Jean-Pierre wrote. “Everything I’d done to make people’s lives better had been connected to it. The party was the vehicle that allowed me not just to have a front seat to history, working first on [Barack] Obama’s presidential campaign then in his administration, but also to make some history of my own as the first Black woman and openly queer person to ever be a White House press secretary. Never had I considered leaving the party until now.”\n\nThe former press secretary also wrote about how she planned to make her first appearance after Biden’s announcement on “The View,” the liberal ABC talk show.\n\n“Now the cloud of unease hovering over me solidified into an idea about how I could possibly do something different. How I could channel my disappointment into some kind of concrete action that would allow me to fight for what I believed in without giving blind loyalty to a party I felt no longer deserved it,” she continued.\n\nPierre wrote, “‘You know what? I’m going to become an independent. I don’t think I can stomach being in the Democratic Party anymore.'”\n\nJean-Pierre accused Democrats of unleashing a “firing squad” on the former president, who was forced off the presidential ticket last July after weeks of pressure from his party following his dismal debate against Republican Donald Trump.\n\nJean-Pierre revealed that she was leaving the Democratic Party in June while announcing her book. Before her high-profile White House role, she worked on multiple Democratic presidential campaigns and was an MSNBC political analyst.","summary":"Jean-Pierre never thought Biden was going to exit the race.","url":"https://nypost.com/2025/10/19/media/karine-jean-pierre-writes-she-couldnt-be-a-democrat-anymore-after-partys-horrible-treatment-of-biden/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/10/white-house-press-secretary-karine-113827972.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/ucdHIOpH-RyIcpnTz.mp4","publish_date":"2025-10-19 22:43:16","author":"Fox News","authors":["Fox News"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.54},{"id":370756752,"title":"Zelensky declares readiness for talks based on current front line","text":"NEW YORK, October 20. /TASS/.

A 17-mile stretch of the 5 Freeway was temporarily closed on Saturday due to a live-ammunition demonstration at Camp Pendleton, held in celebration of the U.S. Marine Corps’ 250th anniversary. (Photo by Apu Gomes/Getty Images)\n\nWhy It Matters\n\nNewsom had warned the administration against staging the display, which occurred at Camp Pendleton in San Diego on Saturday during a celebration for the 250th anniversary of the Marine Corps, writing in a message on X posted Saturday that the display could prove “dangerous.” \n\n“This is a profoundly absurd show of force that could put Californians directly in harm’s way,” Newsom wrote in a post on X Saturday. “Flying live rounds over a busy highway without coordination between state, federal, and local partners isn’t just wrong—it’s dangerous.”\n\nOfficials shut down the I-5 freeway, which carries 80,000 travelers and $94 million in freight daily between San Diego and Orange counties, and canceled afternoon rail service for the line running parallel to the interstate. \n\nThe Marine Corps said it had not requested any closure but appreciated as they conducted “realistic training during today’s historic Amphibious Capabilities Demonstration, showcasing the strength and unity of the Navy-Marine Corps team and ensuring we remain ready to defend the Homeland and our Nation’s interests abroad.”\n\nThe event coincided with the “No Kings” protests that occurred on Saturday in opposition to President Donald Trump’s administration and has renewed debate over the role and visibility of military displays in civilian areas.\n\nWhat To Know\n\nThe 155-milimeter shell fired during the live-fire demonstration prematurely detonated over the freeway, dropping fragments on a CHP vehicle and motorcycle that were part of vice president’s protective detail, according to a patrol report. CHP had elected to stop traffic during the exercise. \n\n“We love our Marines and owe a debt of gratitude to Camp Pendleton, but next time, the Vice President and the White House shouldn’t be so reckless with people’s lives for their vanity projects,” Newsom wrote in a message posted to X on Sunday after the CHP report on the incident was released. \n\nNo injuries were reported, and California Highway Patrol (CHP) personnel notified the Marine Corps at the scene of what happened. The Marines then cancelled firing additional live ordinance over the freeway while the area was searched for further potential damage. \n\nCHP Border Division Chief Tony Coronado called the incident “unusual and concerning” in a statement provided to the press. \n\nThe demonstration featured live artillery fire from M777 Howitzers, amphibious vehicle maneuvers, and simulated explosives at Red Beach within Camp Pendleton.\n\nWhat People Are Saying\n\nCHP Border Division Chief Tony Coronado in a statement to the press: “It is highly uncommon for any live-fire or explosive training activity to occur over an active freeway. As a Marine myself, I have tremendous respect for our military partners, but my foremost responsibility is ensuring the safety of the people of California and the officers who protect them.”\n\nWilliam Martin, spokesperson for Vice President JD Vance, told the New York Times on Saturday: “If Gavin Newsom wants to oppose the training exercises that ensure our Armed Forces are the deadliest and most lethal fighting force in the world, then he can go right ahead.”\n\nMatt Rocco, California Department of Transportation spokesperson, said Saturday, per the Associated Press: “This is all because of the White House-directed military event, that for the safety of the public, we need to shut down the freeway since they’re sending live ordinances over the freeway.”\n\nWhat Happens Next\n\nCHP will conduct an after-action review into the planning, communication and coordination between federal, state, and local government around Saturday’s event to strengthen protocols for future events near public roadways, according to a statement from authorities. \n\nUpdate 10/19/25, 7:04 p.m. ET: This article has been updated with additional information, context, and comment. \n\nCorrection 10/19/25 7:04 p.m. ET: This article initially reported the incident as having happened Sunday, but has been corrected to note the incident occurred on Saturday, October 18.","summary":"California Governor Gavin Newsom had warned against the live fire demonstration, which would shoot artillery over a freeway.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/newsom-reacts-shell-detonation-military-exercise-vance-visit-10903422","image":"https://assets.newsweek.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/GettyImages-2241546385.jpg?w=1600&h=900&q=88","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-10-19 22:35:46","author":"Peter Aitken","authors":["Peter Aitken"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.201},{"id":370755012,"title":"George Santos describes 'rotting facilities,' vows prison reform","text":"Oct. 19 (UPI) -- Former Rep.

Now experts think they know why","text":"Robert F Kennedy Jr has issued a dire warning about the state of the nation's fertility.\n\nIn the Oval Office on Thursday, the Health and Human Services Secretary said: 'Today, the average teenager in this country has 50 percent of the sperm count, 50 percent of the testosterone as a 65-year-old man.'\n\nThe 71-year-old continued: 'Our girls are hitting puberty six years earlier, and that's bad, but also our parents aren't having children.'\n\nNow, the Daily Mail has spoken to three experts who say Kennedy is bringing important attention to an issue they have been worried about for decades.\n\nHowever, they added it did not appear his claims were completely true, and they were unaware of any data showing teenagers had testosterone levels half as high as 65-year-old men.\n\nIt wasn't clear if the secretary was comparing sperm counts in today's teens and seniors or sperm counts when today's seniors were teens several decades ago.\n\nBut the experts warned studies do suggest sperm counts appear to be trending downward across the generations, which may be driven by higher obesity rates and sedentary lifestyles, as well as exposure to environmental pollutants like plastics.\n\nOn girls entering puberty earlier, they also said that while they were not aware of evidence that showed it was happening six years earlier, studies do show that the age for a first period is also trending to earlier in life.\n\nDr Stephen Lazarou, a reproductive endocrinologist at Boston IVF, told the Daily Mail: 'I think there is a general sense that testosterone levels may, indeed, be declining across the [male] generations.\n\n'There is some evidence, or some speculation, that there may be contributing environmental or lifestyle factors, and we believe that that might be secondary to more sedentary lifestyles or increasing obesity rates.'\n\nDr David Shusterman, a urologist who runs a men's fertility clinic in New York City, added: 'I have seen that testosterone levels are on the decline in my clinic, especially even for younger men, and that may be what Kennedy is trying to draw attention to.\n\n'In some cases, these men appear otherwise normal, you know, they are not overweight or have other factors that would put them at higher risk.'\n\nRFK Jr made the comments at a press conference hosted by President Donald Trump Thursday but had also made the same claims in April, telling Fox News that a teenager today has less testosterone than a 68-year-old man and a sperm count that is 'down 50 percent.'\n\nA spokesperson for the Department of Health and Human Services said: 'Secretary Kennedy is sounding the alarm on a public health issue others are too timid, or too politically cautious, to confront.\n\n'A growing body of peer-reviewed research shows significant declines in sperm counts over the past decades, and pretending this isn't a serious trend is irresponsible.'\n\nThey pointed to two studies from 2017 and 2022, which both warned that sperm counts had dipped 52 percent among men from 1973 to 2011. \n\nTestosterone is the male sex hormone and is behind secondary male characteristics such as a deeper voice and facial hair.\n\nIt peaks in men in the early 20s before gradually declining by about one to two percent per year, which researchers say is a natural part of aging.\n\nIt is also linked to sperm counts, with normal levels signaling for sperm production while lower levels can lead the body to produce less sperm.\n\nHigh testosterone levels, as a result of supplements or testosterone injections, can also slash sperm counts, however, by interfering with the other hormonal signals needed for sperm production.\n\nIn a 2017 study published in the journal Human Reproduction Update, and indicated by HHS, scientists surveyed sperm counts from 185 studies involving nearly 43,000 men conducted between 1973 and 2011.\n\nThey found that sperm counts had declined 52 percent over this period in North America, Europe, Australia and New Zealand.\n\nIn 2022, the same researcher, environmental medicine expert Dr Shanna Swan at Mount Sinai in New York, published a second follow-up analysis, also cited by HHS, with Dr Swan telling The Guardian her work suggested that the median sperm count could reach zero by 2045.\n\nSome experts have raised concerns over the paper, saying it compared semen samples where different methods were used to count sperm, which may make the results unreliable.\n\nBut another paper from January 2025 similarly found that, after surveying samples from 11,700 men from between 1970 and 2018, there had been a 'modest decline' in sperm counts, although researchers added it would not affect fertility.\n\nMany experts have been raising the alarm over declining fertility in men for decades, with the cause being unclear, although it has previously been linked to environmental toxins affecting the testicles, as well as poor diets and exercise.\n\nExperts say a healthy man has a testosterone level between 300 and 1,000 nanograms per deciliter (ng/dL), with a man with levels below this considered to have low testosterone.\n\nIt is not clear how many men have low testosterone, although symptoms of the condition include erectile dysfunction, loss of muscle mass, increased body fat and mood changes such as irritability or depression.\n\nStudies have also found evidence that young girls are now starting puberty earlier than ever before, but not the six years earlier that RFK Jr claims. \n\nOne paper published in JAMA in May last year found that while women born between 1950 and 1969 started their periods at 12.5 years old on average, for those born between 2000 and 2005, the average age was 11.9 years old.\n\nThe researchers also found that the proportion of girls starting their puberty before the age of 11 had risen from 8.6 to 15.5 percent. \n\nAnd while the proportion starting their periods before the age of nine was still small, it had more than doubled during the same time frame from 0.6 to 1.4 percent.\n\nResearchers have said childhood obesity could be behind the shift, as well as diet, psychological stress and environmental factors such as toxins that disrupt hormones.\n\nBut it has alarmed officials, who say the change could be behind a higher risk of heart disease, cancer, miscarriages and even premature death.\n\nNot all the experts agreed with RFK Jr, however, with Dr Jeff Singer, a senior fellow at the Cato Institute in the Department of Health Policy Studies, telling this website: 'What I CAN say is that Secretary Kennedy has taken a couple of real studies and turned them into a sensational sound bite.\n\n'There's some evidence of modest downward trends across generations, likely tied to lifestyle and health factors, but nothing close to Kennedy's doomsday framing.\n\n'His claim badly distorts the data, confusing normal aging with supposed generational collapse.","summary":"A dire warning about the state of the nation's fertility was issued last

The United States is the new angle to this but China was always there. In an exclusive conversation with Times Now Group Editor-in-Chief Navika Kumar, Dr Jai Madaan said, \"India–Pakistan is not a relationship, it's just a situationship. The US is a new angle in this situationship, although China has been part of the scene earlier as well.\" When asked how India–Pakistan relations will evolve over the next year, Dr Jai Madaan said, \"In 2024, during a podcast, I predicted that there will be a war, and when Operation Sindoor happened, that was the beginning — not the end — of it. So, with Pakistan, we don’t have a relationship, it’s a situationship, and we have to pass through it. The US is now a new angle, but China was always there.\" India Will Be More Aggressive, Predicts Dr Jai Madaan Continuing further, the astrologer said that in the last 10 years, the Moon was active before September, so we remained very vocal about ourselves. \"We presented our country on a spiritual base — like a growing economy — and there has been a lot of movement. But now, as we are entering the Mangal planet (Mars), we will see an aggressive India rather than a defensive one, because Mars means Commander-in-Chief. So we will be up there, and all these things going on right now are the groundwork for it.\" We May See Some Tough Situations From November, Says Dr Jai Madaan Elaborating further, Dr Jai Madaan said that from November, we may see some heated situations. \"There will be some infiltrations. Pakistan will never do something like dropping a bomb, but they may incite terror and after that, we will have to respond to terrorism.\" Adding more to her comments, the astrologer said, \"On the other side, we will be in a fix to handle some calamities related to water, some internal situations like elections, some tough global scenarios and we will also see some movement from the South, especially from Karnataka and Kerala. All this will take place before March 2026.\" On the stock market, she said it will remain fine till November, but then there will be some correction which means some may lose. America Will Face Recession, Predicts Astrologer Dr Jai Madaan In another prediction, Astrologer Dr Jai Madaan said that the United States will face a recession under the Trump administration though his personal wealth will grow. Making the remark, she said, \"For Donald Trump, the nation comes second. America will face a recession under the Trump administration. His personal wealth will grow, not the country’s.\" On Donald Trump's tariff tactics, the Astrologer said that the impact of US tariffs will continue until March 2026.

It handles gas condensate from Kazakhstan’s Karachaganak field, alongside Orenburg's own oil and gas fields.According to regional Gov. Yevgeny Solntsev, the drone strikes set fire to a workshop at the plant and damaged part of it. The Kazakh Energy Ministry on Sunday said, citing a notification from Gazprom, that the plant was temporarily unable to process gas originating in Kazakhstan, “due to an emergency situation following a drone attack.”Ukraine's General Staff said in a statement Sunday that a “large-scale fire” erupted at the Orenburg plant, and that one of its gas processing and purification units was damaged.Kyiv has ramped up attacks in recent months on Russian energy facilities it says both fund and directly fuel Moscow’s war effort.Trump appeared to edge back in the direction of pressing Ukraine to give up on retaking land it has lost to Russia, in exchange for an end to Moscow’s aggression.Asked in a Fox News interview conducted Thursday whether Russian President Vladimir Putin would be open to ending the war “without taking significant property from Ukraine,” Trump responded: “Well, he’s going to take something.”“They fought and he has a lot of property. He’s won certain property,” Trump said. “We’re the only nation that goes in, wins a war and then leaves.”The interview was aired on Sunday on Fox News’ “Sunday Morning Futures,” but was conducted before Trump spoke to Putin and Zelenskyy last week.The comments amounted to another shift in position on the war by the U.S. leader. In recent weeks, Trump had shown growing impatience with Putin and expressed greater openness to helping Ukraine win the war.In Thursday’s interview, he was noncommittal about sending Tomahawk missiles requested by Ukraine, saying “I’m looking at it” but expressing concern about depleting U.S. weapons stocks.“We need them for ourselves too,” Trump said. “We can’t give all our weapons to Ukraine. We just can’t do that.”Contrary to Kyiv’s hopes, Trump did not commit to providing it with Tomahawks following their meeting at the White House on Friday. The missiles would be the longest-range weapons in Ukraine’s arsenal and would allow it to strike targets deep inside Russia, including Moscow, with precision.Deliveries of Tomahawks could provide leverage to help push the Kremlin into negotiations, analysts say, after Trump expressed frustration over Putin’s refusal to budge on key aspects of a possible peace deal.Meanwhile, Ukrainian prosecutors claim that Moscow is modifying its deadly aerial-guided bombs to strike civilians deeper in Ukraine. Local authorities in Kharkiv said Russia struck a residential neighborhood using a new rocket-powered aerial bomb for the first time.Kharkiv’s regional prosecutor’s office said in a statement that Russia used the weapon called the UMPB-5R, which can travel up to 130 kilometers (80 miles), in an attack on the city of Lozava on Saturday afternoon. The city lies 150 kilometers (93 miles) south of Kharkiv, a considerable distance for the weapon to fly.Russia continued to strike other parts of Ukraine closer to the front line. In the Dnipropetrovsk region, at least 11 people were injured after Russian drones hit the Shakhtarske area. At least 14 five-story buildings and a store were damaged, said acting regional Gov. Vladyslav Haivanenko.A Russian strike also hit a coal mine in the Dnipropetrovk region. Some 192 miners were brought to the surface without injury, the company that operates the mine said.Ukraine's General Staff also claimed a separate drone strike hit Russia's Novokuibyshevsk oil refinery, in the Samara region near Orenburg, sparking a blaze and damaging its main refining units.The Novokuibyshevsk facility, operated by Russian gas major Rosneft, has an annual capacity of 4.9 million tons, and turns out over 20 kinds of oil-based products. Russian authorities did not immediately acknowledge the Ukrainian claim or discuss any damage.Russia’s Defense Ministry said in a statement early Sunday that its air defense forces had shot down 45 Ukrainian drones during the night, including 12 over the Samara region, one over the Orenburg region and 11 over the Saratov region neighboring Samara.In turn, Ukraine's air force reported Sunday that Russia during the night launched 62 drones into Ukrainian territory. It said 40 of these were shot down, or veered off course due to electronic jamming.","summary":"Ukrainian drones strike a major Russian gas plant, igniting fire and suspending gas intake from Kazakhstan, as Trump suggests Kyiv may have to trade land for peace in the ongoing conflict.","url":"https://www.republicworld.com/world-news/ukrainian-drones-strike-russian-gas-plant-as-trump-suggests-land-for-peace-deal","image":"https://img.republicworld.com/all_images/ukrainian-drones-strike-one-of-russia-s-top-oil-refineries-sparking-massive-fire-1757853475082-16_9.webp","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-10-19 22:13:12","author":"Associated Press Television News","authors":["Associated Press Television News"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"in","sentiment":-0.239},{"id":370761928,"title":"Looking for a way forward, Democrats zero in on affordability","text":"Democratic candidates Zohran Mamdani of New York City and Mikie Sherrill of New Jersey are separated by a river, but the gulf between them would appear to be larger than that. Mamdani, favored to become New York’s mayor, is a self-described democratic socialist. Sherrill, who aspires to be her state’s next governor, is a former Navy helicopter pilot and centrist trying to woo moderates back to her party.\n\nSherrill, along with another centrist candidate, Abigail Spanberger, who is running for Virginia governor, are pitching themselves as the Democrats’ best hope in the November elections for flipping the page after President Donald Trump’s victory. While they are advocating pragmatism and consensus-driven solutions, Mamdani is pushing for a set of left-wing policies that would take the party in a new direction. Despite their differences, all three have zeroed in on what Democrats hope will be a winning strategy that carries over to the 2026 midterm elections: the high cost of living for everyday Americans. Each campaign is channeling the same voter frustration – that everything from energy to healthcare to groceries feels increasingly unaffordable.\n\n“That is the pain point right now with voters,” said Mark Riddle, president of Future Majority, a Democratic firm that conducts voter research. “And they’re blaming Trump.”\n\nDemocrats seek to use Trump’s economy against him\n\nSince Democrats lost both the White House and Congress last year, the party has been searching for a policy framework and fresh voices. Success in the key Nov. 4 mayoral and gubernatorial elections could help translate into victories next year, when control of both chambers of Congress will be up for grabs, strategists say.\n\nOne reason Trump won last year was that same economic anxiety. But Democrats argue that Trump slapping high tariffs on imports and his “Big Beautiful” tax bill have only made things worse.\n\nWhile inflation overall has cooled during Trump’s presidency, staples such as food, housing and power remain significantly more expensive than just a few years ago. Grocery prices are up 2.7% over a year ago, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, while home electricity costs have jumped 6.2% and home gas prices have shot up 13.8% over a year ago.\n\nAfter record-breaking price increases in 2021 and 2022, home values have continued to rise, though at a slower pace — now closer to 3% annually. But rent and shelter costs, which factor heavily into the Consumer Price Index, haven’t meaningfully cooled. The cost of medical services excluding prescription drugs has increased 4.2% in the last year.\n\nAbout half of Americans polled in a June Reuters/Ipsos poll said they were “very concerned” about the cost of living. The issue is something of a thorn in Trump’s side: In another Reuters/Ipsos poll conducted this month, just 27% of respondents said they approved of his performance on the cost of living. Meanwhile, the price of imported goods has shot up 4% during Trump’s time in office, with the cost of domestic goods increasing 2%, according to a Reuters’ analysis this month. But while polls show voters are increasingly unhappy with Trump’s handling of the economy, they continue to trust Republicans more than Democrats to fix it. A Reuters/Ipsos poll in September found Americans were more likely to trust the Republican Party over the Democratic Party (34% to 24%) on managing economic policy.\n\nTrump has repeatedly boasted about his economic record, arguing he’s lowered prices and inflation and that his tariffs regime is a success.\n\n“We’ve had the best economy we’ve ever had,” he said at a Cabinet meeting this month.\n\nSearching for a way forward\n\nThe Democratic Party has spent much of 2025 trying to figure out what went wrong last year. Tim Walz, Kamala Harris’ vice-presidential nominee, has toured states speaking to party officials about his ticket’s failure to reassure voters about their everyday concerns.\n\nMamdani, Sherrill and Spanberger, the three most high-profile candidates running this year, have responded by promoting affordability as a central campaign theme.\n\nSpanberger’s “Affordable Virginia” plan focuses on lowering healthcare, housing, and energy costs. Part of the plan would seek to force tech data centers to pay “their fair share” of electricity costs. A former CIA officer, she has also emphasized how federal job cuts and the U.S. government shutdown is damaging her state, which is reliant on federal jobs.\n\nSherrill’s “Affordability Agenda” targets similar cost-of-living concerns. She has pledged to declare a statewide energy emergency and freeze rates.\n\n“Housing, healthcare, and utility costs — I’ll tackle them immediately,” Sherrill said during a debate with Republican opponent Jack Ciattarelli this month.\n\nCiattarelli is also promoting his “affordability agenda” – one that cuts taxes and regulations and argues that Sherrill’s plans are anti-growth.\n\nRecent polls show that Sherrill’s lead over Ciattarelli is hovering around 6 percentage points. Spanberger’s lead over her opponent, Lieutenant Governor Winsome Earle-Sears, has fluctuated between 3 and 10 points, depending on the poll.\n\nMamdani’s agenda includes a rent freeze, free bus service, universal childcare, and city-run grocery stores. He has drawn fire from Republicans, who cast him as a radical, and from some Democrats, including his rival for mayor, Andrew Cuomo, who argues that Mamdani’s policies are unworkable and would lead to large tax increases.\n\nA Quinnipiac University poll released last week showed Mamdani with a 13-point lead over Cuomo.\n\nRebecca Katz, a New York Democratic operative whose firm, Fight, has produced ads on behalf of Mamdani’s campaign, warned that Democrats would be imprudent to dismiss his success.\n\n“If and when he wins in November, Democrats shouldn’t write him off,” Katz said. “They should look at why his message resonated.”","summary":"Democratic candidates Zohran Mamdani of New York City and Mikie Sherrill of New Jersey are separated by a river, but the gulf between them would appear to be larger than that.

The president also accused Petro of being “an illegal drug leader” and encouraging ELN and its activities.\n\n“President Gustavo Petro, of Colombia, is an illegal drug leader strongly encouraging the massive production of drugs, in big and small fields, all over Colombia,” Trump wrote. “It has become the biggest business in Colombia, by far, and Petro does nothing to stop it, despite large scale payments and subsidies from the USA that are nothing more than a long term rip off of America.” \n\nColombian President Gustavo Petro speaks during the General Debate of the United Nations General Assembly at the UN headquarters in New York City on September 23.

So says Tom Booijink, a senior dairy specialist on Europe and Africa for RaboResearch.\n\nHe told Farmers Weekly the European Union is imposing restrictions to control the release of nitrates and ammonia, and in addition the average age of farmers is rising and there is pressure on land prices from urban encroachment.\n\nThe decline is expected to occur in the key dairy areas of the Netherlands, Ireland and Denmark.\n\nBooijink said reduced milk volumes will mean European dairy exports will also decline, according to some estimates by 40-50%, though European demand is expected to stay relatively static.\n\nThat could create export opportunities for NZ.\n\n“I don’t think NZ exporting to Europe is an opportunity, but there will be gaps in exports from the European Union.” \n\nEU regulations include limits on how much manure can be applied to land to control nitrates entering the waterways.\n\nThis requires dairy farmers to pay contractors to remove the balance of the barn waste produced, which can cost a Dutch farmer €2c/litre milk.\n\nLast year’s milk price averaged €50c/litre.\n\nThe volume of manure required to be removed will increase next year as the cap on what can be applied to land declines from 55m cubic metres/hectare to 38m cu/ha.\n\nManaging nitrates is also an issue for pig and poultry farmers and Booijink said the EU has a system for buying out farmers struggling to meet these limits.\n\nDemand for cheese in Europe is high and growing as it is for whey protein and butter.

She is also a prominent advocate for gender equality, and the only Chinese representative in the core working group of the UN Women Leaders Network. In this interview, she discusses how Chinese innovation differs from Western innovation, where the US-China rivalry is headed and the critical role of women’s voices in policymaking.\nThis interview first appeared in SCMP Plus. For other interviews in the Open Questions series, click here.\nIn recent months, much of the discourse around China’s economy has centred on its external challenges, particularly on how US tariffs might impact Chinese exports. Is the rise in global trade protectionism a significant cause for concern, or is this an overemphasised aspect of China’s economic reality?\nTo start, it’s important to first note that the current US-China rivalry extends beyond trade and has expanded into areas such as technology, ideologies and global collaboration. If this unhealthy competition continues, it will hurt not only both countries but also the world.\nThat said, in terms of trade and economics, the concern has been exaggerated. At the peak of exports’ importance to the Chinese economy, they comprised around 36 per cent of China’s GDP. Today, they make up only about half of that, after accounting for roughly 19 per cent of China’s GDP last year. And within that 19 per cent, exports to the US made up only 14.7 per cent of the total, behind the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (Asean) and the European Union.\nIf you do the maths, that means exports to the US made up around 2.8 per cent of China’s GDP. So, even if the tariff war were to wipe out the entire US export market, it would only impact about 2 to 3 per cent of China’s economy.\nChina’s largest export destination is now Asean. Even though part of the exports to Asean might eventually go to the US – let’s say, hypothetically, half of the 16 per cent that goes to Asean – it would still represent only a small proportion of China’s GDP.\nObviously, there are broader and longer-term elements to consider regarding tariff wars. For instance, unemployment will hurt private consumption and social stability; uncertainties will cloud business sentiment and investment strategies; and supply chains will need to adjust to accommodate the shifting demand.\nBut we have seen exporters adapt resiliently and creatively – via different routes, to new markets, and with different products or even packaging. And exports have generally held steady this year.\nMore importantly, there are fast-emerging export destinations beyond the US. China’s exports to Brazil, for instance, grew by 23.3 per cent last year, and exports to Africa for the first eight months this year, by 25.9 per cent. The export portfolio of China has shifted significantly over the years.\nSo, while many people still tend to think China relies heavily on exports – especially to the US – exports are no longer as central to China’s economy as before, and the US’ importance has waned proportionally. The Chinese domestic economy now matters far more to China than exports do.\nI want to argue against the concept of raising private consumption to grow an economy. It should really be the other way around\n\nDomestically, China is pinning hopes on private consumption being a key economic growth driver, with the government rolling out a series of initiatives to boost spending. How effective has this been?\nNot very, and I think focusing on private consumption for the sake of consumption itself is the wrong strategy. Yes, private consumption is now a major engine for China’s economy, but understanding why it hasn’t been growing as fast as expected in recent years is crucial. I’d say there are three reasons.\nThe first one is income. People were used to disposable income growing by double digits, or at least above 8 per cent, for two decades – until Covid hit. Nowadays, the growth is no longer as much as before.\nThe second reason is unemployment, which is quite a worry and concern for China at the moment. The government even stopped publishing the unemployment rate for young adults in 2023 [for five months while recalculating the figure to exclude students]. The official number was above 20 per cent then, but some labour economists said the actual number may have been much higher.\nThe third reason is the wealth effect. More than 90 per cent of Chinese households own homes, and more than 20 per cent of Chinese households own multiple homes.\nPreviously, when the property market was growing well, even if you weren’t working, you were becoming wealthier every day just by owning a house. Now, with property prices down, many lack that sense of wealth and security to spend.\nFor consumers, if their income is not growing as fast, if they have a much higher chance of becoming unemployed, and if their wealth is shrinking, why would they have the confidence to spend? Lots of policy suggestions involve giving people subsidies to encourage them to spend, but if the fundamentals aren’t there, then direct stimulus and subsidies would only be scratching the surface.\nAnd on a deeper level, I want to argue against the concept of raising private consumption to grow an economy. It should really be the other way around, that people will spend more if a country and its people are richer. Here’s an easy way to think about this: no household can become richer by spending more. When a family makes more money, then it will spend more – not the other way around. Higher private consumption as a proportion of GDP is the result – not the cause – of a country’s growth.\nIf we look at World Bank data from 2023, countries such as Somalia and Haiti have the highest ratio of household consumption as a percentage of GDP, above 100 per cent, while developed countries such as Ireland and Singapore have some of the lowest ratios of private consumption to GDP. Thus, spending more to grow a country is not a universal formula for success. We shouldn’t spend for the sake of spending; rather, when a country grows richer, its people can afford to spend more.\nIf we place excessive emphasis on mistakes, then the safest thing is to not do anything, and thus, it’s guaranteed that no mistakes will be made\n\nSo, what do you see as the most significant and promising bright spot in China’s economy?\nThere are four elements in a classic macroeconomic model of growth: land, capital, people and technology. The technology factor is the exponential element – and China’s tech sector and innovation can give us a lot of hope. Behind this are the very hardworking and resilient Chinese people. And the labour productivity in certain private sectors is particularly impressive.\nIn a way, I think of China’s innovation as if the country is an enormous venture capital field. For instance, Silicon Valley is characterised by failing fast and pivoting fast. There’s a lot of competition, there’s a lot of money supporting that, and entrepreneurs are very much encouraged to try. If it’s right, brilliant – they make it. If it’s wrong, they fail, but then they pivot very quickly, and they move on to something new and hopefully right the next time.\nChina, in a sense, operates similarly. It has so many hardworking and innovative people, and they’re trying all these new things. But the problem now is that the prevailing mentality is focused on avoiding mistakes rather than celebrating successes.\nObviously, we need to prevent and punish careless and irresponsible mistakes. But a balance is needed – if we place excessive emphasis on mistakes, then the safest thing is to not do anything, and thus, it’s guaranteed that no mistakes will be made.\nThe current macro and policy environment is not yet friendly enough for entrepreneurs in China. They still have many concerns, with many uncertainties, and they don’t feel fully empowered. I would really hope to see the macro policy environment shift more towards celebrating successes – that it’s OK to fail, as long as you have good intentions and keep trying to succeed – rather than stressing the avoidance of mistakes.\nSome critics argue that Chinese innovation mainly re-engineers existing global technologies rather than achieving foundational breakthroughs. Does China truly innovate? How would you characterise China’s innovation style?\nChinese innovation differs markedly from Western innovation, but that doesn’t mean China isn’t innovative. In fact, China is very innovative.\nThe Western notion of innovation – as outlined in Peter Thiel’s book, Zero to One – is about breakthroughs and creating something brand new. Chinese innovation takes a different approach. Let’s consider the comparison of “zero” to “one”, and I’ll outline four types of Chinese innovation.\nFirst, China often takes a “one” and turns it into “1.1”, but on a massive scale. China has a population of more than 1.4 billion and can sell to the rest of the world, which has a population of more than 8 billion – this is a large market. So, if China achieves “1.1”, it can potentially scale that to “8.8 billion”.\nA prime example is Ant Group. It originated from the 2004 launch of Alipay, six years after PayPal. But then it began adding its own characteristics, services and products, and then scale – the idea being, as the name “Ant” suggests, that it’s small but abundant. [Ant is an affiliate of Alibaba Group Holding, owner of the Post.]\nAlipay was integrated into Ant Group, which was founded in October 2014. Within just six years, the company’s estimated market cap when it was initially going for IPO in 2020 was US$310 billion, which was huge for a relatively young company. It began not with a new concept, but by adding its own innovative characteristics and applying them to the mass market. It wasn’t “zero” to “one”, but it was “one” to “1.1”, then to over a billion, and that’s also innovation.\nThe second type of innovation involves taking an existing “one” and making it in a different and possibly better way. A good example is DeepSeek. It was founded only two years ago, but in January, everyone was talking about it – it swept the world away. Basically, it uses a very different computational method than ChatGPT. It’s more efficient and it does it cheaper. So, yes, OpenAI started ChatGPT – amazingly significant – but DeepSeek does the “one” differently, and possibly better.\nThe third type of innovation is taking different “ones” and combining them into a “10”. A good example would be WeChat. In the beginning, WeChat’s parent company, Tencent, started with QQ, and QQ was learning from ICQ. And then, over the years, while Silicon Valley produced products such as Facebook, WhatsApp and Instagram, WeChat became a combination of all of them, and you can even do online shopping like on Amazon, and hire taxis like on Uber.\nIt almost serves as a Windows system – a platform for everything. Many people don’t even use Baidu to search for things any more; they will just use WeChat, because it’s now this information universe. You go there, and you can get everything done. This is a third form of Chinese innovation, starting with different “ones” and merging them into a “10”.\nThe fourth type of innovation focuses intensely on “0.1” within a “one”, making that element the best in its class and applying it across sectors. An example would be CATL, which doesn’t make entire electric cars, but specialises solely on the “0.1” – the batteries. It’s the largest firm in the industry and powers everything. It already supplies batteries for a third of the electric vehicles around the world, with Tesla also being an important client. Last year, CATL successfully tested a flight for an electric plane, and has even launched electric cruise ships.\nNow, CATL’s ambition is not just to work on batteries – their ambition is to electrify whatever can be electrified. They just focus on the “0.1”, but they do it so well that they empower all the “ones” in different sectors. This is absolutely also innovation, which is why I say China just innovates differently.\nThe two [US] political parties can’t agree on anything, but the containment of China is one thing they can agree on\n\nThe first administration of US President Donald Trump tried to curb China’s tech advancements, but some say it accelerated China’s self-reliance instead. As we navigate a second Trump term, what new dynamics do you foresee?\nI wouldn’t say it accelerated self-reliance. Rather, it forced China to pivot. For instance, China is denied access to the most premium chips, but China can use chips that are good enough and focus on their applications and business.\nAnd China can pivot to other markets. Like I said earlier when we were talking about trade, it’s not just the US and European markets any more. We’re now in a very different phase of globalisation. Traditionally, we think about trade as China selling to the US and Europe – these were the big markets. But nowadays, the Global South is the emerging market.\nAnd entrepreneurs always find a way. Chinese manufacturers are innovating to sell better and cheaper products, and to more people and different countries. At the core of economics, it’s all about incentives. Money motivates, and people will find a way.\nThis time, though, President Trump has accumulated more power. At the moment, it’s mostly related to trade and economics, but I am concerned that it will escalate to other areas as well, such as security and finance realms. And it’s important to note that it’s not just about China itself; we also have to look at American domestic politics.\nPolitically, it’s a more divided country at the moment. And I joke – but I mean it – that with all the political, economic and social divisions in the US right now, the only thing that unites the US is China. The two political parties can’t agree on anything, but the containment of China is one thing they can agree on. So, I am worried that there will be more attacks on China, and they won’t just be trade and technology related.\nYou’ve previously alluded to the Thucydides Trap in the context of US-China relations. Is conflict inevitable, and what can the US, China and the international community do to avert such an outcome?\nProfessor Graham Allison’s Thucydides Trap theory provides a very insightful, alarming and powerful historical reference point for US-China dynamics. Out of 16 past cases when there was one existing dominant power and one emerging power, 12 resulted in war. So, it’s telling us that there is a very high likelihood of conflict, and we need to be alarmed, but at the same time, war is not inevitable.\nFor instance, it’s very important to note that when Sparta and Athens went to war, neither of the kings actually wanted to go to war. It was really the very hawkish people on both sides who made it impossible for the kings not to go to war. In a way, the kings had to give in to public sentiment.\nOn this, ironically, China can have better cards to play. Relatively speaking, China can more effectively manage and steer public opinion. This offers some hope – that what makes the US and China different from the Thucydides Trap is that China’s side could avoid being hijacked by irrational public sentiment.\nThe Thucydides Trap is an important theory and stark warning, but psychology suggests that what we focus on can actually lead to what we get. So, while it’s important we are fully alert to the risks of war and do everything we can to prevent it, overemphasising risks, on the other hand, could lead us to act in ways that increase the possibility of war, as both sides start to act more defensively and inward-looking rather than exploring more possibilities of collaboration and joint interests. I don’t know which of the two is better, but averting conflict will require very self-disciplined and wise world leaders to collectively make the right, informed choices.\nAnd this is not just about the US and China. In physics, the most stable shape is a triangle, but we currently lack a third pillar that can stabilise the two countries. Before, I had hoped Europe could play that role, given its economic power and global influence, but European nations are also stuck at many fronts and they can’t, unfortunately, reach an agreement among themselves on many key issues. So, I’ve shifted my hopes to the emerging markets. Instead of being stuck between the geopolitical rivalries of the US and China and forced to choose a side, perhaps those nations could come together and broker a path forward by pressuring the two superpowers to work together.\nCuriosity and personal experience are our best tools to bridge perception gaps … come to China and see first-hand\n\nYour insights today reveal a more nuanced reality of China than is often portrayed in mainstream media. How can we correct this perception gap?\nIt will take quite some time to fix this, as the lenses are different, misperceptions are too prevalent, and many have moved beyond facts and rational discussions to emotions.\nA lot of it is about trust building – otherwise, the two sides will only push each other away. Whether through bridges of businesses or cultural exchanges, one of the most effective ways to build understanding is for outsiders to visit China.\nEven if you don’t like China at the moment, it’s worth recognising that China is important enough for you to get out of your comfort zone and see for yourself. Curiosity and personal experience are our best tools to bridge perception gaps. So, I’d say come to China and see first-hand – it’s very different.\nAs a woman who has navigated leadership roles in the workplace and now runs your own advisory, what are the most significant barriers limiting the career advancement of women?\nThere are two types of barriers: those that we can work on ourselves and those that are rooted in systemic gender inequality.\nFor example, globally and including in China, there’s about a 25 per cent gender income gap. Traditional wisdom says that women don’t negotiate for salaries enough. For instance, a survey in Linda Babcock’s book, Women Don’t Ask, found that men negotiate their salaries eight times more often than women, on average. This is something that, as women, we ourselves can do better, because traditionally we have been brought up to be more amicable, accepting and kind, as opposed to being assertive and firm in asking for what we want.\nBut a study from UC Berkeley two years ago found that women graduates from a top MBA programme were actually negotiating more often than their male counterparts – yet were rejected more frequently. This highlights the systemic barriers: even when we adopt behaviours traditionally seen as successful, we might still be met with resistance.\nAnother critical barrier is the disproportionate burden of domestic work and childcare. In China, while women are now pursuing higher education in greater numbers than men and maintain a relatively high participation in the labour force, women still do 2.6 times more housework and childcare after marriage. This imbalance will have to be changed for women to be able to contribute more to economic growth and social development.\nBut despite the barriers, I think we’re already making big advancements overall. I believe that the rise of female power – and the rise of China – are the two key defining themes of this century.\nWe must ensure our voices are heard – not just for ourselves, but for the nations’ economic growth and social progress\n\nWhat unique opportunities do you see for women today?\nWomen view the world, and change the world, differently.\nOur lenses are different and can be the key ones. Take the field of economics as an example – in the Chinese version of Paul Samuelson’s classic textbook, Economics, only less than half a page, out of 1,187, was dedicated to discussing women’s issues. But female economists look at economics differently.\nFor example, in 2022, a group of Chinese male economists argued in a report that the reason Chinese people were no longer having as many babies was that it was too expensive. They calculated the direct costs of raising a child in China, from birth to 18 years old – including milk powder, housing and education – to be around US$66,000.\nI have complex emotions for this study. On one hand, it’s an important study, and I much appreciate their work in calculating this and the attention it drew from government and society and the widespread debate it sparked. But on the other hand, it was a classic example of how male economists view the world differently – they looked only at the direct out of pocket costs.\nThis approach overlooks a critical concept in economics: opportunity cost. Leading international economic studies show that, on average, a woman sacrifices about 20 per cent of her lifetime income to have a child. This is known as the parenthood penalty, also referred to as the motherhood penalty, since it disproportionately affects mothers.\nSo, I worked with professors Zhao Yaohui and Zhang Xiaobo from Peking University to examine this issue in China. We estimated that the motherhood penalty alone costs US$78,000 – more than all the direct costs of raising a child combined.\nFertility policies need to be focused in the right direction. If they consider only the direct costs studied by male economists, rather than the more important indirect costs, i.e. the motherhood penalty, then the policy direction would be wrong, resources misallocated and results not effective.\nThat’s why it is important to have more women, whether as government officials, economists or business managers, at the table. We must ensure our voices are heard – not just for ourselves, but for the nations’ economic growth and social progress.\nChina’s famous saying, that women hold up half the sky, captures this well. Ultimately, we’re all carrying the torch from previous generations on to the next. While there are times we take two steps forward and one step back, I’m convinced that – especially given rising education levels and economic opportunities – we will find our way.","summary":"Liu Qian is the founder of Wusawa Advisory and formerly the managing director of The Economist Group in Greater China.

Hegseth is enforcing a new policy requiring journalists to agree to specific conditions in order to be granted access. Many news organizations are pushing back against the policy, with dozens of reporters turning in their press badges last week rather than comply. Johnson pushed back and said, \"Fear is not part of the Secretary of War’s make-up, OK?\" JOHNSON TURNS UP SHUTDOWN PRESSURE ON DEMOCRATS AS GOP UNEASE GROWS Karl argued that Hegseth has only had two press briefings since leading the Pentagon. \"And they’ve basically forced the Pentagon press out of the building unless they would agree to sign a pledge that would make it impossible to be independent journalists,\" Karl said. Johnson said Hegseth's public appearances and speeches showed his transparency. \"I can’t remember, and I don’t think you can either, a secretary of defense who has been so transparent, out in the open, talking about priorities, principles and things,\" Johnson said. MIKE JOHNSON FIRES BACK AT HAKEEM JEFFRIES' 'DESPERATE' CALL FOR TELEVISED SHUTDOWN DEBATE Karl also pressed Johnson on his rhetoric about the nationwide \"No Kings\" protests being rallies about hating America. \"Just on this notion that these are 'hate America' rallies — and you not only talked about anarchists, antifa advocates, pro-Hamas wing — you said this is the modern Democratic Party,\" Karl said. \"But I remember not that long ago what you said after the murder of Charlie Kirk when you said that we should view fellow Americans, not as our enemies, but as our fellow countrymen.\" Johnson also pushed back when Karl said some of the language reminded him of Hillary Clinton's infamous \"deplorables\" remarks about supporters of President Donald Trump. But he said he was trying to warn Americans about the modern Democratic Party. \"Look at what's happening in New York,\" Johnson said, referring to the rise of Zohran Mamdani. \"They're about to elect an open socialist Marxist as the mayor of America's largest city.\" Karl and Johnson also went back and forth over the shutdown, as Karl demanded to know why the House was not in session. \"The House did its job, exactly a month ago today on September 19. We passed the clean resolution,\" he said. \"The Democrats have voted 11 times, except for three Democrats in the Senate, they voted 11 times to shut down the government and cease and halt those programs,\" Johnson said.
