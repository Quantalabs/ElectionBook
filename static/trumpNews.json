Then the phone, the iPad, and my cellphone just went nuts.'\n\nHe gave away further details about his brother's life, telling ABC7 that the new pope is a fan of the Chicago White Sox and not their rival Chicago Cubs, despite their mother being a lifelong Cubs fan.\n\nHe and his two brothers all knew 'what we wanted to do very early in life,' saying the man he once called 'Rob' wanted to be a priest 'from the time he could walk.' \n\n'A neighbor once said he was going to be pope someday. How's that for a prognostication?'\n\nPrevost, 69, was born in Chicago, Illinois and began studying to become a priest with the Catholic Church at the age of 18, before going on to graduate from Villanova University in Pennsylvania with a degree in mathematics four years later. \n\nHe spent much of his early life in South America and also holds Peruvian citizenship, and was said to have been seen as the 'least American of the Americans' who were in the running at the Conclave. \n\nA popular figure in the church who served as the head of Pope Francis' vetting process for new bishop nominations, he has been notably quiet about his views on topics such as women in the clergy and same sex unions. \n\nHe waded into gender ideology while serving as a bishop in Chiclayo, Peru in 2012, saying that 'the promotion of gender ideology is confusing, because it seeks to create genders that don't exist.' \n\nFollowing his graduation in Pennsylvania, Prevost first went to Peru in 1985 as a missionary before being named the Roman Catholic Diocese for the Chulucanas region that same year. \n\nPrevost - also known as Father Bob - returned to work as a pastor in Chicago in 1987 for one year before becoming the head of the Augustinian seminary in Trujillo, Peru - a role he kept for a decade. \n\nIn 1998, he was elected as the head of the Augustinian Province of Chicago, making him one of the leading religious figures in the United States. \n\nThe man he succeeded to lead the Vatican, Pope Francis, brought Prevost to Italy in 2023 and handed him a prominent post heading into the Conclave, a process where cardinals vote in secret to elect the new Pope that was watched in anticipation by millions. \n\nAlthough he makes history as the first American pope, the Chicago-born religious leader has not been shy about his disapproval of President Donald Trump in the past. \n\nHe has taken so social media a number of times to criticize the Trump administration's moves on immigration repeatedly and expressed support for progressive causes. \n\n'Do you not see the suffering? Is your conscience not disturbed? How can you stay quiet?' he said in one tweet. \n\nThe new Pope also shared several articles that address JD Vance's stance on immigration. One of them is titled: 'JD Vance is wrong: Jesus doesn't ask us to rank our love for others.' \n\nDespite holding a prominent post at the Vatican, Prevost was not among the bookies' favorites heading into the Conclave. \n\nThis was primarily because he is an American, with no US citizen ever holding the position of Pope before in history. \n\nPrevost is also a Peruvian citizen, and he lived in the South American country for many years as a missionary and then archbishop. \n\nWhile working under Francis, he presided over one of the most revolutionary reforms Francis made, when he added three women to the voting bloc that decides which bishop nominations to forward to the Pope. \n\nIn early 2025, Francis again showed his esteem by appointing Prevost to the most senior rank of cardinals, suggesting he would at least be Francis’ choice in any future conclave. \n\nThe Rev. Fidel Purisaca Vigil, the communications director for Prevost’s old diocese in Chiclayo where he previously served, remembered Prevost as a warm and kind man who ate breakfast with his staff each day. \n\n'No matter how many problems he has, he maintains good humor and joy,' he told the Associated Press. \n\nJames Martin, a Jesuit priest who is also the editor-at-large of America Magazine, said on X after Prevost was announced as the new pope that he had similarly happy memories of the clergyman. \n\n'I know Pope Leo XIV to be a kind, open, humble, modest, decisive, hard-working, straightforward, trustworthy, and down-to-earth man. A brilliant choice. May God bless him,' he said in a post. \n\nPrevost enters the papacy not without some scandal in his past, and some have already pointed to an incident over two decades ago when he became embroiled in the Catholic Church's child abuse controversy. \n\nIn 2000, he came under scrutiny for allowing Father James Ray, an Augustinian priest who had been suspended from the ministry nine years before due to allegations of sexual abuse of minors, to reside at his St John Stone Friary in Chicago. \n\nHe would go on to take a public stance against the way that the Catholic Church handled the pedophilia scandal, telling La Republica in 2019 that it must move away from its culture of cover-ups. \n\n'We reject the cover-up and secrecy, that does a lot of damage, because we have to help the people who have suffered from the bad act,' he said. \n\nHe urged victims to come forward, adding: 'Many times it was shut up and don't talk, you can't ask for that. \n\n'On behalf of the Church we want to tell people that if there was any offense, if they suffered or are victims of the bad actions of a priest to come and denounce it, to act for the good of the Church, of the person and the community.","summary":"The newly-elected Pope Leo XIV's brother admitted to a piece of advice he offered before the conclave that could have changed history.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-14694095/pope-leo-xiv-brother-advice-pontiff-moments-conclave.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/05/09/01/98201537-0-image-a-5_1746750404242.jpg","video":"https://videos.dailymail.co.uk/video/mol/2025/05/08/3194836172315576055/1024x576_MP4_3194836172315576055.mp4","publish_date":"2025-05-09 01:19:09","author":"Editor,Stephen M.

Zelenskyy said after the call on Thursday that he told Trump that Ukraine was ready for talks on the war with Russia “in any format” but first “Russia must show that it is serious about ending the war, starting with a full and unconditional ceasefire”.\n\nThe call between Donald Trump and Volodymyr Zelenskyy on Thursday went “very well”, said a senior Ukrainian official. The conversation lasted about 20 minutes and focused on diplomacy and the genuine ceasefire that the US and Ukraine are trying to establish, while the presidents also discussed the Ukraine-US minerals deal, ratified on Thursday by the Ukrainian parliament.\n\nUkraine has accused Russia of violating Vladimir Putin’s self-declared ceasefire 734 times within its first 12 hours. Kyiv’s foreign minister, Andrii Sybiha, called it a “farce”. The Russian president’s unagreed ceasefire aims to protect parades and other proceedings on Russia’s biggest secular holiday, the 80th anniversary of victory over Germany in the second world war.\n\nIn its opening hours, Russian bombs struck north-east Ukraine, killing at least one civilian, said Ukrainian officials who added that artillery assaults took place across the 1,000km (620 mile) frontline, although with less intensity than in the previous 24 hours. Russia carried out 63 assaults along the frontline. Attacks took place near Chasiv Yar in the Donetsk region. Large-scale missile and drone attacks abated for a short time, the Ukrainian air force said. But Russian forces fired a missile in central Ukraine’s Poltava region, a top regional official said, damaging roofs of houses when air defences brought it down.\n\nThe Russian defence Ministry accused Ukrainian forces of attacking its positions and said Russian forces would continue to “mirror” Ukraine’s actions during the Kremlin’s ceasefire. The Russian regions of Belgorod, Lipetsk, Orenburg, Ryazan and Tambov issued drone alerts, but there were no reports of any drones being shot down or intercepted. Russia’s civil aviation authority Rosaviatsia briefly imposed restrictions on flights to and from the airport in Nizhny Novgorod.\n\nReuters journalists with a Ukrainian drone unit near the front in eastern Ukraine said a Russian infantry raiding party tried to advance on Thursday, but was stopped by drones. “The infantry are still coming,” said one of the soldiers in the unit, a 33-year-old who identified himself by his callsign Mikha. A second person who identified himself as Nazar said in the six hours since the Russian ceasefire started there had been three strikes on his section of the front: “The facts speak for themselves.”\n\nGermany said Trump voiced support for European efforts to end the Ukraine war in a first phone call with the new German chancellor, Friedrich Merz. A German statement said: “Trump said he would strongly support Germany’s efforts, together with France, Great Britain, Poland and other European partners, to achieve lasting peace.” Merz assured Zelenskyy of his support and remained open to arming Ukraine with Germany’s Taurus cruise missiles, which the previous chancellor, Olaf Scholz, refused to do.\n\nBritain has announced further sanctions targeting Russia’s shadow fleet of oil tankers. Keir Starmer, the prime minister, said his government was sanctioning up to 100 tankers responsible for carrying more than $24bn worth of cargo since the start of 2024. The UK also said the ships are damaging critical subsea cables in Europe.\n\nStarmer is due to attend a meeting of the Joint Expeditionary Force (JEF) in Oslo on Friday where Ukraine and Arctic security are on the agenda. The British-led military alliance is expected to announce further support for Ukraine’s armed forces including intensive training exercises and efforts to counter disinformation. The JEF consists of Denmark, Estonia, Finland, Iceland, Latvia, Lithuania, Norway, the Netherlands, and Sweden, as well as the UK.","summary":"Ukrainians record 734 attacks despite Putin’s claim of three-day halt to fighting; Britain further targets Russian oil ‘shadow fleet’.

The highest current income tax rate of 37 percent applies to those who make more than $626,350 per year and married couples who make more than a combined $751,600 per year.If implemented, Trump's plan would roll back one of the tax cuts that took effect as a result of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.Trump instructed Johnson to include the tax hike in the \"big, beautiful bill\" during a phone call on Wednesday, the Times reported. The president's move comes weeks after he publicly spoke out against raising taxes on millionaires.\"I think it would be very disruptive because a lot of the millionaires would leave the country,\" he told reporters in the Oval Office last month. \"In the old days, they left states, they'd go from one state to the other. Now with transportation so quick and so easy, they leave countries.\"What People Are SayingPodcast host and former White House chief strategist Steve Bannon recently posted on social media site Gettr: \"Big story in WaPo that talks about how the great Russ Vought, Scott Bessent, and others including JD Vance are not just open to working on the ability to have an increase in taxes for, if not the upper bracket, then those making a million or more at 40%.Bannon added: \"Something we've advocated strongly and worked for many years here because it is the right thing to do. The working class and middle class need additional tax relief, and this is the way to get it.\"Johnson previously weighed in on raising taxes on millionaires, telling Fox News last month: \"I'm not a big fan of doing that. We're the Republican Party, and we're for tax reduction for everyone—that's a general principle that we always try to abide by. There's lots of discussion, lots of ideas on the Hill. People have different thoughts and theories on how we can solve this perfect equation to get all of this done. But I wouldn't put any money on any of that yet.\"GOP Senator Josh Hawley of Missouri said he wasn't opposed to hiking taxes on the wealthiest but told the Post that Republicans wouldn't back the plan: \"Zero, probably,\" he said when asked how many would support it. \"Maybe one or two.\"This story is developing and will be updated as more information becomes available.","summary":"Trump's reported demand could upend tenuous negotiations around the \"big, beautiful bill\" he wants House Republicans to pass.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/trump-tax-hike-wealthy-americans-reports-2069966","image":"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2641438/trump-mike-johnson.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-05-09 00:58:00","author":"Sonam Sheth","authors":["Sonam Sheth"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.132},{"id":319350268,"title":"Skip Bayless taints Gregg Popovich's legacy while likening his traits to 'Donald Trump","text":"Skip Bayless called Gregg Popovich a \"bully\" and likened a trait of the former San Antonio Spurs coach to U.S. President Donald Trump.Bayless delivered a lengthy rant on Thursday's \"Skip Bayless Show.\" He started by saying Popovich is a \"product\" of the legendary trio of Tim Duncan, Manu Ginobili and Tony Parker.

AliKhan regarding the Trump administration’s attempt to weaken Susman Godfrey LLP, the newly appointed deputy associate attorney general was momentarily left without words.\n\nAnd it happened twice.\n\nLove true crime? Sign up for our newsletter, The Law&Crime Docket, to get the latest real-life crime stories delivered right to your inbox.\n\nAs the court unraveled several issues in President Donald Trump‘s April 9 executive order, key sticking points during the hearing concerned an allegation that the Los Angeles-based law firm “engages in unlawful discrimination, including discrimination on the basis of race.”\n\nDuring his time at the dais, Susman Godfrey’s lead attorney, Donald Verrilli, said the president’s findings were “completely baseless.”\n\nThe Joe Biden-appointed judge, for her part, repeatedly tried to ferret out what, exactly, the government had based the discrimination allegation on.\n\nAnd there, Lawson was admittedly lacking.\n\n“I don’t have the hard data on hiring,” the DOJ lawyer said at one point.\n\nInstead, Lawson tried to defend Trump’s order by suggesting the court shift to a more nebulous but more holistic inquiry into “the quantum of proof that must exist” for the executive to determine a potential policy. To that end, Lawson argued, the answer is: “it’s low.”\n\nIn other words, the government lawyer was trying to move the debate away from specifics and into a framework where the court would be amenable to giving the president broad discretion — even, and perhaps especially, if the specifics are difficult to come by. Lawson suggested the court could sign off on a policy where the president acts based on his subjective understanding of the law firm’s commitments to diversity.\n\n“There has to be some level of discretion afforded to the executive,” he said.\n\nBut the judge was not having it.\n\n“I don’t know how, if you’re relying on a legally erroneous statement, you’re allowed to exercise that discretion,” AliKhan replied.\n\nThe sole statement in Trump’s order supporting the allegation is: “For example, Susman administers a program where it offers financial awards and employment opportunities only to ‘students of color.””\n\nThat line, it turns out, is a reference to the Susman Godfrey Prize, which the law firm describes as “[a]n honor awarded annually to up to 20 students of color who are finishing their first or second year at an eligible law school” and “part of the firm’s ongoing commitment to celebrate and promote diversity among civil trial lawyers.”\n\nThe government lawyer was pressed to concede that the prize is not unlawful discrimination in employment under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act, despite previous language in court filings highlighting the prize and suggesting it is unlawfully discriminatory.\n\n“It doesn’t seem like anything you have alleged in section one constitutes unlawful racial discrimination,” AliKhan said.\n\nThe judge noted that the language regarding the prize is the only example of racial discrimination that Trump’s order contains — and that the line comes immediately after the allegation.\n\n“I just don’t know how you square the circle,” AliKhan said.\n\nWhile Lawson tried to move on to a different-but-related argument, the judge pushed him to account for the line about the prize.\n\n“So, the only example in the executive order that has to do with racial discrimination isn’t actually an example?” the judge asked, waiting a beat before demanding an answer: “Yes or no?”\n\nA long silence followed.\n\n“Yes or no, sir,” the judge pressed.\n\nMore silence.\n\nWhile the government lawyer did not have an answer, he finally spoke up to say as much.\n\n“I would like to think about that, your honor,” Lawson said.\n\nAliKhan replied: “I would like an answer before you leave my courtroom.”\n\nThe DOJ attorney then returned to the prize, initially noncommittal on whether knock-on effects of the prize might implicate Title VII but eventually conceding the point after some back-and-forth.\n\n“So it seems like the quantum of proof is nonexistent,” the judge said, turning the attorney’s own verbiage back on him.\n\nIn the end, Lawson agreed there was no support for the racial discrimination claim in Trump’s order. Still, he insisted that some discretion should be given to the executive by the courts.\n\n“I understand that, I just don’t understand why I’m supposed to defer to something I can’t read,” AliKhan said. “The president wrote these words and they were probably the best words.”\n\nAnother major source of conflict came with the government’s other justification for the claim that the law firm illegally discriminates.\n\nThe DOJ lawyer, moving away from the text of Trump’s order, said the real issue here is Susman Godfrey’s commitment to “racial balancing.” He then cited a portion of the law firm’s website about opportunities for “underrepresented” communities. Such language, Lawson said, assumes an “adequate representation” based on race or ethnicity and is “quite suspect” in light of the landmark U.S. Supreme Court ruling barring race-based affirmative action in college admissions.\n\nHere, however, the judge was audibly aggrieved.\n\nAliKhan launched into a lengthy series of questions and hypotheticals about women in law. The judge noted that women are the majority of law school graduates in the country but only make up a substantial minority of partners at law firms.\n\nPointedly, she asked whether language about this state of affairs, where women are statistically underrepresented, would also run afoul of the Trump administration. The government lawyer said statements alone would not be a problem.\n\n“The concern would be true hiring,” Lawson said. “Actual hiring decisions based on hiring to hit a representative, however determined, number.”\n\nAs the discussion continued for several more minutes, the tenor and number of questions from the judge on the issue of representation suggested she viewed the government’s position unfavorably.\n\nOn rebuttal, Susman Godfrey’s attorney sought to ridicule the Trump administration’s admitted evidence as “a website statement that uses the word ‘underrepresented’ and a pledge to gender parity — that’s it.”\n\nThen, Verrilli took a turn at rephrasing Lawson’s verbiage.\n\n“The government may have some discretion in terms of contracting, but they don’t have discretion to violate the Constitution,” he said.\n\nAliKhan ended the hearing by promising she would rule on both the parties’ motions for summary judgment and the plaintiff’s request for a preliminary injunction as soon as she could.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nPresident Donald Trump speaks with reporters in the Oval Office at the&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Judge Stuns DOJ Lawyer into Silence During Court Hearing first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/crime/judge-stuns-doj-lawyer-into-silence-during-court-hearing/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Judge-ridicules-DOJ-argument-about-using-Wayback-Machine.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-05-09 00:53:35","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.528},{"id":319349400,"title":"Trump says he is naming Fox News host and former judge Jeanine Pirro as top federal prosecutor in DC","text":"President Donald Trump said Thursday that he is naming Fox News host Jeanine Pirro, a former county prosecutor and elected judge, to be the top federal prosecutor for the nation’s capital after abandoning his first pick for the job.\n\nPirro, who joined Fox News in 2006, cohosts the network’s show “The Five” on weekday evenings. She was elected as a judge in New York’s Westchester County Court in 1990 before serving three terms as the county’s elected district attorney.\n\nTrump tapped Pirro to at least temporarily lead the nation’s largest U.S. Attorney’s office after pulling his nomination of conservative activist Ed Martin Jr. for the position earlier Thursday. In a post on Truth Social, Trump said he was naming Pirro as the interim U.S. attorney in Washington, D.C., but didn't indicate whether he would nominate her for the Senate-confirmed position on a more permanent basis.\n\n\"Jeanine is incredibly well qualified for this position, and is considered one of the Top District Attorneys in the History of the State of New York. She is in a class by herself,\" Trump wrote.\n\nTrump withdrew Martin from consideration after a key Republican senator said he could not support Martin for the job due to his defense of rioters who stormed the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021. \n\n“He’s a terrific person, and he wasn’t getting the support from people that I thought,” Trump told reporters in the Oval Office on Thursday. He later added, “But we have somebody else that will be great.”\n\nMartin's leading role in Trump's “Stop the Steal” movement was demoralizing for subordinates who spent four years prosecuting over 1,500 riot defendants only to see the president pardon them en masse. Pirro has her own connection to the baseless conspiracy theories of election fraud.\n\nIn 2021, voting technology company Smartmatic USA sued Fox News, Pirro and others for spreading false claims that the company helped “steal” the 2020 presidential election from Trump. The company’s libel suit, filed in a New York state court, sought $2.7 billion from the defendants.\n\nPirro is the latest in a string of Trump appointments coming from Fox News — a list that includes Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, who co-hosted “Fox & Friends Weekend.”\n\n“Jeanine Pirro has been a wonderful addition to The Five over the last three years and a longtime beloved host across Fox News Media who contributed greatly to our success throughout her 14-year tenure. We wish her all the best in her new role in Washington,\" a Fox News Media spokesperson said in a statement.\n\nMartin has served as acting U.S. Attorney for the District of Columbia since Trump’s first week in office. But his hopes of keeping the job faded amid questions about his qualifications and background. Martin had never served as a prosecutor or tried a case before taking office in January.\n\nMartin has stirred up a chorus of critics during his brief but tumultuous tenure in office. He fired and demoted subordinates who worked on politically sensitive cases. He posted on social media about potential targets of investigations. And he forced the chief of the office’s criminal division to resign after directing her to scrutinize the awarding of a government contract during Democratic President Joe Biden’s administration.\n\nMartin’s temporary appointment is due to expire May 20.\n\nPirro, a 1975 graduate of Albany Law School, has significantly more courtroom experience than Martin. She led one of the nation’s first domestic violence units in a prosecutor’s office.\n\nAfter her elected terms as a judge and district attorney, Pirro briefly campaigned in 2005 as a Republican to unseat then-Democratic Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton before announcing that she would would run for New York attorney general instead. She lost that race to Andrew Cuomo, son of former New York Gov. Mario Cuomo.\n\nPirro became an ubiquitous television pundit during O.J. Simpson’s murder trial, often appearing on CNN’s “Larry King Live.” During her time on Fox News, she has frequently interviewed Trump.\n\nIn the final minutes of his first term as president, Trump issued a pardon to Pirro’s ex-husband, Albert Pirro, who was convicted in 2000 on conspiracy and tax evasion charges.\n\n© Copyright 2025 The Associated Press.

Put aside that, as of yet, it is far from clear that any judicial orders have been violated. Even under the worst assumptions, what Trump is doing to the independence of the federal courts is far less serious than what the Biden-Harris Administration tried to do to the independence of the federal courts.\n\nOn April 9, 2021, President Biden created a \"Commission\" to examine \"reforming\" the \"membership\" of the U.S. Supreme Court. This action alone is a more serious threat to judicial independence and to the rule of law than are any of the actions with respect to the courts taken so far by President Trump. Imagine how the Democrats would react if President Trump were faced with a liberal Supreme Court majority and therefore created a Commission to examine \"reforming\" the \"membership\" of the Supreme Court. Democrats would say fascism was around the corner.\n\nAmong the ideas the Biden Commission seriously considered were imposing 18-year term limits on Supreme Court justices by passing a statute. This is an idea which I once favored for policy reasons, but which I concluded decades ago in a law review article could only be done by a constitutional amendment. I have subsequently concluded that 18-year term limits for Supreme Court justices are also a bad idea, as a matter of policy, because every two-term president would get four Supreme Court appointments, which is almost always enough power to change the jurisprudential balance on the Supreme Court.\n\nNonetheless, after Joe Biden withdrew his presidential candidacy last summer because of his dismal performance in a nationally televised debate, he gave a speech in Texas endorsing a statute term limiting the Supreme Court justices (a proposal that was understood as calling for legislation, not a constitutional amendment, in part because in the same speech Biden called for a constitutional amendment to overturn the Supreme Court's presidential immunity decision in Trump v. United States (2024) while not calling for a constitutional amendment to change the membership of the Supreme Court). Senator Sheldon Whitehouse's bill to do this provided for eliminating the Senate filibuster as to his 18 year Supreme Court term limits bill. Vice President Kamala Harris, who became the Democratic Party's nominee for president, immediately endorsed Joe Biden's plan for statutory court packing via term limits. As Senator Whitehouse's bill makes clear, the plan was to eliminate the Senate filibuster and ram the term limits, i.e., court packing, through both Houses of a narrowly divided Congress despite the absence of any popular mandate to make such a sweeping change, which would have trashed the rule of law and demolished the independence of our life tenured judiciary.\n\nThe size of the Supreme Court has been fixed at nine justices since 1869, 156 years of our 236-year history as a constitutional republic. An exhaustive survey by University of Wisconsin law professor Joshua Braver conclusively demonstrates that there is quite simply no tradition of Supreme Court packing or radical membership changes in American constitutional history. President Biden's actions and speeches after he withdrew from the presidential race, which were endorsed by Kamala Harris, were a flagrant attack on the independence of the U.S. Supreme Court and on the rule of law itself. They were un-American and smacked of the behavior that goes on in banana republics like Argentina, which are devoid of the rule of law.\n\nUnder Biden's proposal in July 2024, a new seat on the Supreme Court would be created by statute, and not by a constitutional amendment, for every Supreme Court justice who has served for 18 years or longer at the beginning of a President's first and third year in office. Once a justice was confirmed to that new seat, any justice who had served for 18 years or longer would be barred under Sen. Whitehouse's bill from hearing any case in the appellate jurisdiction of the Supreme Court. Such justices would be unconstitutionally confined to hearing cases only in the original jurisdiction of the Supreme Court or cases in the inferior federal courts, unless they resigned.\n\nThe Court would be \"packed\" because the number of justices would increase beyond the nine who have served since 1869, and justices who have served as \"Judges of the supreme Court\" would be disqualified from hearing cases in the Supreme Court's appellate jurisdiction. Had Kamala Harris won in November 2024, and had a 50 to 50 Democratic Senate with a Democratic House of Representatives been elected, as could easily have happened, Justice Clarence Thomas and Chief Justice John Roberts would have been forced out of office in the first and third year of Kamala Harris's presidential term.\n\nApart from the unwisdom and un-Americanism of partisan court-packing, the plan is unconstitutional. Congress's supposed power to term limit or pack the Supreme Court comes from a clause in the Constitution which empowers Congress \"To make all Laws which shall be necessary and proper for carrying into execution the judicial Power of the United States.\" This clause allows Congress to pass the rules of federal procedure. It allows Congress to create new judgeships and to regulate federal court jurisdiction to some degree, just as it allows Congress to create executive offices and cabinet departments and agencies.\n\nBut those laws creating judges must be \"necessary and proper for carrying into Execution\" the judicial power, not \"for undermining the judicial power.\" There are sometimes good grounds for creating new federal judgeships as the caseload of the existing judges gets out of hand, but it is not possible to say with a straight face that the Supreme Court is straining under its caseload, which is roughly a third of where it stood four decades ago. Nor can anyone say with a straight face that Clarence Thomas and John Roberts are suffering from the effects of old age that plague former President Joe Biden.\n\nThe Necessary and Proper Clause does not allow Congress and the President to destroy the third co-equal branch of our federal government or to create two Supreme Courts when the Constitution says that there shall be only one. Court packing by statutory term limits is unconstitutional, and if such a bill is ever enacted into law, it will be the duty of the Supreme Court to hold it unconstitutional.\n\nThis was a very serious threat to judicial independence and the rule of law. Certainly, nothing President Trump has done so far comes even close.\n\nStatutorily imposed term limits, for their part, would have applied to \"Judges of the supreme Court\" whose offices are critically created by the Constitution itself, and not by federal statutes. Article II, Section 2 of the Constitution specifically says that: \"[The President] shall nominate, and by and with the advice and consent of the Senate, shall appoint … Judges of the Supreme Court ……\" \"Shall\" means \"must,\" and so the Constitution itself creates the offices of \"Judges of the supreme Court,\" and it orders the President to fill those offices. Moreover, Article III of the Constitution specifically adds that \"The Judges, both of the supreme and inferior Courts, shall hold their offices during good Behavior.\"\n\nCongress can term limit the time during which Supreme Court justices serve as inferior court judges, when they sit by designation on the inferior federal courts, because it was Congress, not the Constitution, which gave Supreme Court justices this dual office. Hence, it was constitutional for Congress to eliminate circuit-riding by Supreme Court justices. But Congress cannot legislate as to the office of \"Judge of the supreme Court,\" which the Constitution both creates and grants life tenure to.\n\nLikewise, Congress cannot prevent \"Judges of the supreme Court\" from hearing cases on the Supreme Court's appellate docket because Article III of the Constitution provides that \"The judicial Power of the United States, shall be vested in one supreme Court\" and that that power \"shall extend to all Cases, in Law and Equity, arising under this Constitution, the Laws of the United States, and Treaties made, or which shall be made, under their Authority\" as well as to eight other categories of Cases or Controversies.\n\nCongress's only power to regulate the appellate jurisdiction of the Supreme Court is to make good housekeeping rules for how the Supreme Court exercises its appellate jurisdiction. Congress may not create two Supreme Courts: one of which hears critically important appellate jurisdiction cases and the other of which hears only trivial original jurisdiction cases. The opening words of Article III could not be clearer in saying that Congress may create \"one\" and only \"one\" Supreme Court.\n\nSo, this was the first and most flagrant Biden Administration violation of the rule of law and attack on judicial independence.\n\nThen there was the extortionate threat that the Biden-Harris Administration made in Murthy v. Missouri (2024) to Facebook, Meta, and YouTube that the Administration would bring an antitrust lawsuit against these companies to break them up unless they censored free speech, including truthful information, related to Covid-19, election integrity, and other topics, under the guise of combating misinformation. Justice Alito's dissent describes in chilling detail this threat to free speech and the First Amendment. The only reason the Supreme Court did not reach the merits was an absence of standing to sue. When it comes to extortion to shut down freedom of speech, the Biden-Harris Administration wrote the playbook.\n\nAnother Biden Administration attack on the rule of law occurred in 2021, when the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) issued a nationwide moratorium on the eviction by landlords of tenants, allegedly to stop the spread of Covid-19. This was as consequential and uncompensated taking of the private property of landlords as that which occurred in the 1952 Steel Seizure Case. In Alabama Ass'n of Realtors v. Department of Health and Human Services (2021), the Supreme Court held that this was an executive branch abuse of power, because it exceeded any statutory power the executive branch had.\n\nThen, on November 5, 2021, OSHA, spurred on once again by President Biden, announced that his administration would be promulgating a vaccination or test mandate for all private companies with 100 or more employees. This order came at a time when many Americans, especially conservatives, were afraid to be vaccinated. A vaccination mandate is a violation of the right to bodily integrity that can only be justified when there are years of proof that the vaccine works and is safe to take. In National Federation of Independent Business v. Department of Labor, OSHA (2022), the Supreme Court ruled, under the Court's Major Questions Doctrine, that OSHA had exceeded its statutory authority in issuing this sweeping, totalitarian mandate on all American workplaces.\n\nDemocrats now complain that President Trump is playing fast and loose with statutory text. They may be right on occasion, as with using IEEPA to raise and lower tariff rates (as I have repeatedly argued), but where were these Democrats a few years ago?\n\nThen, yet again in 2021, the Biden Administration tried to use an obscure portion of the Clean Air Act to get the Environmental Protection Agency to promulgate climate change regulations that would have cost trillions of dollars to comply with. This would have bankrupted the country and greatly depressed economic growth. In West Virginia v. EPA (2022), the Supreme Court struck down these rules as being unauthorized by statute, and as raising a Major Question that must be dealt with by Congress.\n\nAnd in Biden v. Nebraska (2023), the Biden Administration tried to forgive billions of dollars in student loan debt to help itself politically with younger voters even though Biden must have known that he had no statutory authority to do this. The Administration woefully exceeded its statutory authority to forgive such debt, and the Supreme Court struck down the debt forgiveness plan, again under the Major Questions Doctrine. (The Court correctly recognized that the statutory authority was limited to narrow waivers and modifications in the event of \"national emergenc[ies],\" such as the 9/11 attack that prompted the enactment of the law.)\n\nAnd finally, on his last full day in office in 2025, President Biden preposterously declared that the Equal Rights Amendment had been validly ratified and was now the 28th Amendment to the Constitution. This attempt to alter the 236 year-old rule of recognition for Article V changes to the Constitution is a form of \"constitutional vandalism,\" and is contrary to precedents such as Dillon v. Gloss (1921) and Illinois v. Ferriero (D.C. Cir. 2023).\n\nThis analysis does not even include President Biden's, and the Democratic Party's, four prosecutions of former President Donald Trump on flimsy charges, plus New York State's outrageous $450 million civil suit against President Trump. Until the Biden Administration, no President had ever prosecuted his predecessor in office for anything. Joe Biden tore up that rule and threw the whole weight of the Department of Justice and the FBI against President Trump who he was running against in the 2024 presidential election. The States of New York and Georgia piled on. As former Judge, and now Stanford law professor, Michael McConnell wrote in the Wall Street Journal, the New York State criminal case, in particular, was a sham and a travesty of justice.\n\nThe only charge brought against President Trump that was even plausible was mishandling of classified documents, but former Secretary of State Hilary Clinton had had a private email server that was unsecured at her private home and that could have been easily hacked by the Russians that had classified documents on it. Since Clinton was not prosecuted for this gross breach of mishandling classified information, then-former President Trump should not have been prosecuted for misuse of classified information either. To make matters worse, Attorney General Merrick Garland even appointed an unconstitutional Special Prosecutor to go after Trump, as Judge Aileen Cannon of the District Court for the Southern District of Florida correctly held in the summer of 2024.\n\nNo President has posed a bigger threat to judicial independence, to the freedom of speech, to liberty (by woefully misreading federal statutes), or to constitutional norms (like not prosecuting your predecessor in office) than President Biden did. I have spoken out against what I see as the improper actions of the Trump Administration, such as its treatment of Columbia University, its attempt to rescind birthright citizenship, and its exceeding its statutory authority as to tariffs; but I think the Biden Administration's record on following the rule of law and respecting judicial independence is dreadful. To those who fear that the United States is becoming an authoritarian state, thank God that the Biden-Harris Administration is no longer in office.\n\nThat being said, I very strongly disapprove of the Trump Administration's behavior toward law firms, its threats to revoke Harvard's tax-exempt status, and its attempts to coerce university speech and mandate curricula. I expect to discuss those lengthy subjects in a later post.","summary":"Democrats tried to alter unconstitutionally the membership of the Supreme Court; they extorted Facebook into censoring free speech; they issued presidential executive orders unsupported by statute; and they pushed unprecedented prosecutions of Biden's predecessor in office, and his 2024 opponent, in the presidential race.","url":"https://reason.com/volokh/2025/05/08/president-bidens-and-the-democrats-assault-on-the-supreme-court-and-the-rule-of-law/","image":"https://d2eehagpk5cl65.cloudfront.net/img/q60/uploads/2021/11/the-volokh-conspiracy.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-05-09 00:38:31","author":"Jack Nicastro,Steven Calabresi","authors":["Jack Nicastro","Steven Calabresi"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.365},{"id":319350558,"title":"AS, UK capai perjanjian perdagangan 'bersejarah' - Trump","text":"WASHINGTON: Presiden Amerika Syarikat (AS), Donald Trump, semalam mengumumkan AS dan United Kingdom (UK) berjaya mencapai perjanjian perdagangan yang disifatkannya sebagai 'bersejarah'.\n\n\"Pagi ini (semalam), saya sangat teruja untuk mengumumkan kami telah mencapai perjanjian perdagangan yang penting dengan UK,\" kata Trump di Rumah Putih.\n\nBeliau berkata, ia adalah yang pertama dalam siri perjanjian perdagangan dirundingkan pentadbirannya sejak empat minggu lalu.\n\n\"Dengan perjanjian ini, UK bersama AS mengesahkan prinsip timbal balik dan keadilan adalah teras penting dalam perdagangan antarabangsa,\" katanya.\n\nTrump memaklumkan bahawa UK akan mengurangkan pelbagai halangan bukan tarif yang sebelum ini dianggap mendiskriminasi produk AS.\n\nSementara itu Perdana Menteri UK, Keir Starmer yang menyertai secara maya, menyifatkan perjanjian berkenaan sebagai 'hari sangat hebat dan bersejarah.'\n\n\"Saya rasa ini adalah satu penghormatan terhadap sejarah kerjasama erat antara negara kita... perjanjian yang sangat penting.\n\n\"Ini akan meningkatkan perdagangan dua hala, bukan saja melindungi pekerjaan tetapi turut mencipta peluang kerja dan membuka akses pasaran,\" katanya.\n\nAnadolu juga melaporkan Trump mengesahkan keluli adalah 'faktor besar' dalam perjanjian itu, yang menurutnya akan mengukuhkan ekonomi kedua-dua negara.\n\nBeliau turut mendedahkan bahawa bahan kimia dan jentera keluaran AS telah dimasukkan ke dalam perjanjian itu.\n\nWalaupun beberapa butiran teknikal akhir masih dalam rundingan, Trump berkata, perjanjian asas telah dimuktamadkan.\n\n\"Perjanjian ini adalah satu kesepakatan yang konklusif,\" katanya.\n\nBeliau menggambarkan perjanjian itu sebagai lebih daripada sekadar pakatan perdagangan, dengan menyatakan ia akan membawa UK ke dalam 'penjajaran keselamatan ekonomi bersama AS' yang disifatkannya sebagai 'jaminan keselamatan ekonomi yang besar.'\n\nKetika ini, kebanyakan barangan UK yang diimport AS dikenakan tarif sekitar 10 peratus, manakala kadar lebih tinggi dikenakan ke atas kereta, keluli dan aluminium.\n\nUK pula turut mengenakan tarif ke atas pelbagai produk AS serta melaksanakan cukai perkhidmatan digital yang telah lama menjadi isu kepada syarikat teknologi Amerika.\n\nPerjanjian baharu itu dijangka merangkumi pengurangan tarif secara timbal balik, khususnya dalam sektor automobil, dan berpotensi mengurangkan ketegangan berhubung cukai digital UK terhadap syarikat teknologi AS.","summary":"WASHINGTON: Presiden Amerika Syarikat (AS), Donald Trump, semalam mengumumkan AS dan United Kingdom (UK) berjaya mencapai perjanjian perdagangan yang disifatkannya sebagai ‘bersejarah’.","url":"https://www.bharian.com.my/dunia/amerika/2025/05/1393882/uk-capai-perjanjian-perdagangan-bersejarah-trump","image":"https://assets.bharian.com.my/images/articles/BH9SEJARANG-O_BHfield_image_listing_featured.var_1746750891.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-05-09 00:34:57","author":"BERNAMA-ANADOLU","authors":["BERNAMA-ANADOLU"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"my","sentiment":-0.119},{"id":319350546,"title":"World News | US VP Vance Congratulates Leo XIV on Election Win","text":"Washington DC [US], May 9 (ANI): US Vice President JD Vance on Friday extended his greetings to Leo XIV, the first American Pope, on his election.\nVance expressed his hope that millions of American Catholics and other Christians will pray for his successful work leading the Church.\nAlso Read | LOI Issued to Elon Musk Firm: The Path Forward for Starlink.\nIn a post on X, he said, \"Congratulations to Leo XIV, the first American Pope, on his election!

Now President Donald Trump’s barrage of tariffs on US trading partners threaten to hit hard. In the last of a three-part series, the Post finds out what the company, a leader in aluminium curtain walls for building exteriors, is considering as it navigates the new disarray in world trade. Read part one here and two here.\nHong Kong entrepreneur Danny Lau Tat-pong has sometimes wondered if his family-owned business missed out on expanding beyond mainland China.\nKam Pin Industrial stood still while other manufacturers in the city moved some operations overseas more than a decade ago, sniffing trouble from growing US-China trade tensions and Beijing’s sweeping industrial upgrade.\nRelying solely on its production base in Dongguan, in neighbouring Guangdong province, the company thrived, gaining an international reputation for its top-quality aluminium curtain walls.\nThe lightweight material was much in demand as cladding for buildings, from airport terminals to skyscrapers, because it was robust and allowed for versatile designs.\nKam Pin’s innovations with colours and the materials used as coatings multiplied the uses, attracting customers from many countries, including the United States and Japan.\nIn Hong Kong, its products feature prominently on the Palace Museum in the West Kowloon Cultural District, the purple facade of the 11 Skies shopping complex at Hong Kong International Airport, and the distinctive silver exterior of the West Kowloon high-speed rail terminus.\n\nIn 2019, Lau, the managing director, came close to opening a plant in Thailand. Red tape delayed the project, then Covid-19 struck the following year and things changed.\nThe pandemic years made working from home a new normal, weakening demand for new commercial buildings in the US, a core market.\nAlthough business was hit, Lau was grateful he did not proceed with the Thai expansion.\n“I thought we’d missed the boat, but it turned out to be a blessing in disguise,” he said.\nThat was before February this year, when he faced an unprecedented set of fresh challenges as President Donald Trump unleashed a series of tariff announcements targeting US trading partners and hitting China hardest.\nTrump’s multiple announcements, including putting some tariffs on hold while negotiating with individual countries, are aimed at reducing the US trade deficit, putting America’s interests first and addressing what he perceives as practices unfair to America.\nOn February 10, Trump cited national security to justify a 25 per cent tariff on all imported steel and aluminium. Then, on April 5, he slapped a 10 per cent baseline tariff on goods from all US trading partners.\nTaking into account levies already in place – including some imposed during Trump’s first term – it added up to 75.7 per cent in tariffs for Kam Pin’s US-bound products, Lau said.\nThat included two rounds of 10 per cent tariffs imposed on Chinese goods in February.\nLau said his company’s products were still competitive for US customers, but profit margins had shrunk.\nDespite the levies, a regular customer in the US placed a HK$2 million (US$257,792) order recently.\n“This is a small job, because no overseas manufacturers dare to take this order, and my quotation was only 35 per cent of those by US manufacturers,” he said.\nLau said Kam Pin would have “a good year” if it garnered about US$5 million in orders from the US over the second half of 2025, but it had reached only a tenth of that target so far.\n“We are worried about next year’s orders,” he said.\n\n‘Pay more, or buy from elsewhere’\nAccording to the Boston Consulting Group, the February 10 tariffs would affect a wider range of aluminium products entering the US, more than doubling the total to 5.3 million tonnes.\nIt estimated that US$132 billion worth of derivative products such as baseball bats and aircraft and kitchen appliance parts would be hit, in addition to automotive and mechanical machinery and construction materials.\n“The main options [for US importers] are to source domestically or pay more for imported materials. Shifting sourcing locations is less useful if everyone faces the same tariffs,” said Iacob Koch-Weser, a Boston Consulting associate director specialising in trade and investment.\nAccording to an S&P Global report, China is not among the biggest aluminium exporters to the US. But the tariffs it faced would affect exports of aluminium wares.\nChina exported 527,250 tonnes of aluminium wares to the US last year, or 16.3 per cent of its total aluminium wares exports, it said, citing official data.\nAustralia was a major exporter of aluminium, while Japan, South Korea and Vietnam were key steel exporters to the US, the report added.\nHelen Chin Wai-man, head of research of the HKUST Li & Fung Supply Chain Institute, said there were various ways for Hong Kong or mainland companies to deal with the tariffs.\nSome exporters could split the bills for US importers into different forms of payments such as commissions, service fees or consulting fees, shrinking the amount charged for goods and subject to the tariffs, she said.\nThey could also switch shipments of finished goods, sending exports to the US from factories in countries that attract lower tariffs.\nSo a company with a factory in Vietnam selling to European markets and a factory in China exporting to the US, could swap to send their Vietnamese-made products to America.\nAnother practical approach would be to ship products from China to Canada or Mexico before exporting them to the US, she said.\n\nAlthough the Trump administration was looking at plugging the loophole of diverted goods, Chin said: “There are quite a few ways some companies use to get around the situation, but over a longer term, China’s supply chain will gradually move further into where these factories are.”\nEddie Lam Kin-wing, former president of Hong Kong Construction Association, said the business chamber encouraged developers and contractors to use more made-in-China building materials.\n“This is a win-win situation because mainland materials are generally lower in price,” he said. Some mainland companies could also expand to overseas markets through Hong Kong.\nHe said the Hong Kong government’s decision to raise spending on public works would also help the construction sector and materials suppliers.\nFinancial Secretary Paul Chan Mo-po announced in February that the average annual expenditure on public works would be raised from HK$90 billion in 2024 to HK$120 billion in each of the next five years.\nUS market ‘too big to lose’\nThe US tariffs have brought new uncertainty for Kam Pin, which was founded in Hong Kong by Lau’s parents in 1960 and which he now runs with his son.\nHe set up its Dongguan factory in 1989, encouraged by a business acquaintance who opened a mainland factory earlier.\nLau said it was fortunate that the group came up with a product 12 years ago, to add wood or rock patterns as the coating on its aluminium curtain walls, creating a wooden or rocky effect on the surface.\nThe company invented its own technology for that innovation, which became its lifeline.\nAt HK$1,000 per square metre, the patterned product was double the price of plain curtain walls and earned a higher margin of profit.\nLau recalled that even after Trump’s 2018 round of tariffs, Kam Pin’s prices were a least half that of similar products made in the US.\n“Now, with the additional tariffs, products from South Korea are getting more competitive,” he said.\nToday the company’s current sales are split equally between the US, mainland China and Hong Kong, and Lau said the American market was too unique and too big to lose.\n\n“US importers are into quality and willing to pay for higher-end or higher quality products even though there are cheaper options from South Korea, Thailand and even our mainland rivals,” he said.\nTo hold on to its US business, Lau said, the company would have to revisit the idea of setting up a plant outside the mainland, although no decision would be made until the dust had settled on the tariff situation.\nHe visited Vietnam, Taiwan and Thailand before deciding in 2019 to set up a factory in an industrial estate near Pattaya, Thailand.\n“I was waiting for the Thai government to issue a board of investment document, a prerequisite for investment incentives, when Covid-19 broke out and in the end, the plan did not materialise,” he said.\nIn 2022, he was told that the document was ready, but by then, the company did not have sufficient orders to justify opening another factory.\nTo continue exporting to the US despite Trump’s tariff chaos, Lau said he was going back to that old plan of expanding his company’s operations beyond the mainland.\nMalaysia was a possibility, with lower exposure to the US tariffs, but he said he would not rush a decision.\nHong Kong business chambers are organising a trade delegation next month to Malaysia to check out trade opportunities.\nLau said Kam Pin would explore Canada, the Arab states of the Persian Gulf and the Asean countries in Southeast Asia to open up new markets.\n“We spent a few years breaking into the US market, which was very difficult in the early stage. So I guess it will take some time to break new ground in these countries,” he said.\nMeanwhile, the company would focus harder on product development.\n“Every month, I sit down with my team and push each person to come up with innovative ideas,” he said. “Now this process is even more critical to our future.”\nFor now, though, the future was still too hazy.\n“I am 72,” he said. “If not the pandemic, the tariffs and the company’s situation, I would have retired a long time ago.”","summary":"With tariffs likely to hurt its business, Kam Pin Industrial is finally reconsidering opening a factory overseas.","url":"https://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/hong-kong-economy/article/3309623/hong-kong-aluminium-firm-fights-us-clients-avoid-being-crushed-trade-war","image":"https://cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2025/05/08/26c22231-db65-41b2-a191-fe0dc73242b7_a4a74323.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-05-09 00:30:08","author":"Denise Tsang","authors":["Denise Tsang"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"cn","sentiment":0.072},{"id":319351334,"title":"Fox Host Reveals Judge Jeanine Pirro’s Exit in Live TV Farewell","text":"Fox News host Bret Baier informed viewers Thursday evening that Donald Trump had named Jeanine Pirro the interim U.S. attorney for Washington, D.C. \n\nOn Special Report, Baier said that Pirro had left Fox to take on the role. \n\n“President Trump announced that on Truth Social minutes ago,” he said, before summarizing Pirro’s legal background. \n\n“Pirro was assistant district attorney for Westchester County in New York and went on to serve as county judge and district attorney, where she was the first woman ever to be elected to those positions,” he said. \n\nBaier added, “We obviously wish her well.”\n\nPirro’s final time co-hosting The Five was on Wednesday.\n\nA fervent pro-Trump voice on the right-wing network, Pirro’s commentary got her labeled a promoter of false 2020 election claims by voting machine company Dominion.\n\nFox News ultimately settled with Dominion for $787.5 million.\n\nIn early 2022, after Fox executives had ended Pirro’s weekend show, she was moved to The Five.

Habemus Papam! Overnight, the Catholic Church has made a decision that is at once historic (first American Pope) and high risk (creating from scratch an American leader who will be more famous than Donald Trump).\n\nFor the 133 cardinals, it's time to go home.\n\nBut in Australia, the conclaves continue. Not just for the Liberal Party, but among the National Party and the Greens too. Never before have these three political groupings suffered — simultaneously, and as a result of the same electoral event — such an extinction event of leadership.\n\nAnd while the Labor Party's headline news from Saturday was triumph — So many seats! So many smiling women! — the truth is that the influx of new talent has challenged the existing pecking order so sorely that the crepuscular conclave of the NSW and Victorian Right factions are delivering scenes of backroom carnage that would make even a Borgia Pope blanch.\n\nThese negotiations do not involve the wearing of robes and zuchetti, and they do not take place under Michelangelo's The Creation of Adam.\n\nBut they are secretive, they are brutal, and, yes, a lot of the time, they involve groups of men trying to wrap their heads around why they are not more popular with women.\n\nMeanwhile in Australia \n\nTo the Liberal Party first, where the organisational trauma inflicted on Saturday night is so new, and so deep, that early attempts at number-counting defaulted to include MPs who — like inexplicably itchy phantom limbs — were simply no longer there.\n\nAn outfit habitually dependent on the healthy rivalry between conservatives and moderates floundered in a brand new hellscape in which neither grouping has a surviving leader. Angus Taylor is the leader of the conservatives now, we assume. He has yet to be sighted since election night, granted. But it is the hope of the tribe that he turns out to be more John Howard than Howard Hughes, moving forward.\n\nSussan Ley — is she a moderate? She is now! The previous moderate leaders were — more or less — Victorian Senator Jane Hume, with a side helping of David Coleman, who was shadow foreign minister for the election period, after former moderate leader Simon Birmingham retired. (Ley wanted that job, by the way, and as deputy leader she was nominally entitled to demand it, but these Liberal Party rules do sometimes have a way of evolving a lady-shaped carve-out when push comes to shove. Bookmark this thought.)\n\nColeman has been popped on light duties, okay no duties, by his electorate of Banks, now the property of Labor's surprised but beaming Zhi Soon. And Senator Hume seems to be in some kind of purgatory, and in any event is in the wrong chamber for party leadership.\n\nTimes are tough. You know they're tough, because the Liberal Party is seriously considering electing a female leader.\n\nIt's all moving pretty fast, in a conclave that is happening where we can't see it, but from which periodically puffs of smoke burst forth, like the truly extraordinary news yesterday that Senator Jacinta Nampijinpa Price has defected from the Nationals party room to join the Liberals.\n\nThis sounds, to the untrained ear, like a minor thing. Aren't they all part of the Coalition? Isn't she just moving to a different seat in the same room?\n\nActually it's utterly explosive, because the Nationals have already lost deputy leader Perin Davey in a slight Senate vote misadventure on Saturday. To lose another Nat from the Senate takes them from six senators to four. This has serious consequences for party resourcing. And for the Liberal Party, the addition of Senator Price to the already-fraught leadership skirmish is like the addition of a scorpion to a jar full of confused baby mice.\n\nLey — who this morning declared that her leadership would enhance the party's appeal to women — is now not the only woman in the mix, and there is talk that she could team up with Taylor as a leadership duo.\n\nIs it ironic that in order to find a woman when they finally decide they need more, the Liberal party had to shoplift one for their Coalition partner? Yes, it is. But these are unusual times.\n\nThe sky is thick with portent. It couldn't be more different from last time, when the Liberal ranks — thinned methodically by voters who didn't love Scott Morrison — found themselves nevertheless obliged by the merciless laws of mathematics to elect as their leader someone who was a slightly newer and slightly more banana-scented model of the same guy.\n\nThe electorate has come back for a second go at explaining the 2022 concept, and this time the Liberal conclave's waters are turbid and ill-disciplined. People are ditching on each other and circulating files of past blunders. Women are involved. I remind you: WOMEN ARE INVOLVED. Anything could happen. They are expected to convene in Canberra next week.\n\nThe Labor conclave\n\nAcross this vast and unprepared continent, other conclaves smoulder unseen.\n\nThe Greens — having conceded yesterday that the Melbourne seat of leader Adam Bandt is gone — now move into their famously opaque leadership process. It's too soon to assess how this will go. And realistically, we won't know until it happens. The Greens are the most leak-proof party operation in Australia, probably more so than the real conclave. But the acting Greens leader, Tasmanian Senator Nick McKim, this morning ruled himself out of contention, so the field is probably Queensland's Larissa Waters, South Australia's Sarah Hanson Young, and NSW's Mehreen Faruqi.\n\nBut the strangest conclave — and the blokiest (in domestic terms I mean, line honours and a tip of the zucchetto always of course going to the Vatican) — belongs, surprisingly, to the Australian Labor Party.\n\nYes, this is the party that just won a historic victory and increased its parliamentary ranks after one term of government, in a way that actually never happens.\n\nYes, this is the party that has achieved gender parity 30 years after making some very hard decisions about quotas at the urging of some extremely firm-willed women including a young Penny Wong.\n\nAnd yes, this is the party that — having experienced uncomfortable chafing from its tight margin of victory in 2022 (77 seats, in a House that requires a majority of 76) — now finds itself in the elasticated pants zone of a 90-plus seat count.\n\nTen years ago, the ginger group of Labor MPs who plotted to get rid of Julia Gillard and reinstall Kevin Rudd — most active among which was the former NSW Right MP Joel Fitzgibbon — used to call themselves The Cardinals.\n\nAnd — wow. The Right faction has really donned the robes again this week.\n\nThe new influx of talent is playing merry hell with the existing power structures, delicately titrated over generations by the watchful factions. The NSW Right — which has long observed an orderly queue for leadership rendered no less matronly by the fact that it is all-male — has been struck amidships by the unexpected success of the Victorian Right, and the Left. Numerically, it is obliged to surrender a cardinal from its cabinet ranks, thanks to the iron laws of factional arithmetic, which determine the membership of the cabinet, if not the specific job allocation, which is the pleasure of the prime minister.\n\nThe NSW Right — whose western Sydney heavyweights include Tony Burke, Chris Bowen, Jason Clare, Michelle Rowland and Ed Husic — does not want to surrender a cardinal.\n\nIn a party swamped by exultant new female MPs, the power struggle now rages among men of the Right. The Victorian Right appears to have sacrificed Attorney-General Mark Dreyfus, without his consent, to make way for newcomer Sam Rae, who just won the seat of Hawke. The NSW Right has countered, it seems, by offering the scalp of Minister for Science Ed Husic. Again.\n\nWhat is fascinating about these conclaves — and do not underestimate the ugliness of these tussles, as disagreements between believers are always the most horrible of all — is the extent to which they miss the point.\n\nThe biggest headline story from election night was the massive swing towards Labor, and Anthony Albanese's dominance of the House of Representatives, which is the chamber of government.\n\nBut the much more powerful, and much less evident under-story is the evolving realisation about where the real power is after July 1 this year.\n\nA sobering reality for Greens, Coalition\n\nThe Labor Party, after that date, will have more seats in the Senate than the Coalition. This is unprecedented in this century. \n\nAnd despite the humiliations of the Greens in the Lower House, including the loss of the Greens leader, the Greens will hold the balance of power in the new Senate. In order to get legislation passed through the Senate, the Government will have to persuade either the Greens or the opposition. This is a sobering reality both for the Greens and for the Coalition, in different ways.\n\nIt will be true no matter how the residual Senate races pan out, including the transfixing arm-wrestle between Jacqui Lambie and Lee Hanson (daughter of Pauline) in Tasmania.\n\nThis is the story of real power, and where it lands.\n\nForget all the pre-election talk of deals and minority government, which Anthony Albanese — the grizzled managerial veteran of Julia Gillard's minority term — effectively downplayed during the campaign.\n\nForget the Teals.\n\nForget all the Labor blokes jockeying for front-bench spots on the House of Representatives' green leather. These are struggles around personal ego and legacy. How do we know this? Here's a clue: Andrew Charlton, who just held on to the marginal seat of Parramatta and is among the most clearly gifted people of the NSW Right — isn't anywhere near the head of the Cabinet queue, and it's not because he's a man. It's because he's in a queue, and the queue is full of dudes.\n\nForget, even — honestly, you can afford to, because they are going to be a hot mess for quite some time — who becomes Liberal leader. Whoever it is will almost certainly be a placeholder.\n\nBecause the real power, after July 1, is in the Senate. The real deals on what gets through and what doesn't are going to be struck on red carpet, not green.\n\nWho's in charge in the Senate?\n\nLet's check, because hardly anyone ever mentions it, but it's about to be screamingly important.\n\nAt present, the government's leader is Penny Wong, who manages Senate business with the assistance of Albanese's implicitly-trusted Finance Minister Katy Gallagher. The Coalition's Senate leader is Michaelia Cash, flanked by South Australian Liberal Anne Ruston. Who knows who the Greens' new leader will be? But if (as is possible) the job goes to either the Senate leader Larissa Waters or deputy leader Mehreen Faruqi or long-serving South Australian senator Sarah Hanson Young, who manages the party's Senate business, the quiet pattern is confirmed. The current theatrics feel blokey, but the future is female.\n\nDon't tell the cardinals.","summary":"Far from Rome, the sky is thick with portent as Australia's political parties decide who has power in the current parliament. ","url":"https://www.abc.net.au/news/2025-05-09/conclave-australian-politics-liberals-greens-labor-party/105267614","image":"https://live-production.wcms.abc-cdn.net.au/37dc643f5d907b2f81cefec013911170?impolicy=wcms_crop_resize&cropH=2813&cropW=5000&xPos=0&yPos=0&width=862&height=485","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-05-09 00:19:54","author":"Annabel Crabb","authors":["Annabel Crabb"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"AU","sentiment":0.063},{"id":319350988,"title":"‘Leone!’ Vatican crowds hail Leo XIV as new pope of the Catholic Church","text":"Vatican City – It felt like the square could talk in one voice: “Leone! Leone! Leone!”\n\nThousands of people in St Peter’s Square chanted in chorus the name adopted by Robert Prevost as he ascended to the papacy on Thursday: Leo XIV.\n\nJust an hour and a half earlier, white smoke had billowed from the chimney of the Sistine Chapel, announcing that a conclave of cardinals had elected a new leader for the world’s 1.4 billion Catholics.\n\nNow, it was time to meet Pope Leo himself. A solemn silence fell across the square. The faithful waited to hear the pope’s first message, which would set the tone for his papacy.\n\n“Peace be upon you,” said Leo XIV, appearing on the central balcony of St Peter’s Basilica.\n\nHe proceeded to repeat a blessing uttered by his late predecessor, Pope Francis, just weeks earlier: “God loves us, God loves everyone, and evil will not prevail. We are in the hands of God.”\n\nIt was a closely watched moment, with red-hatted cardinals poking out of nearby windows to catch their first glimpse at the newly minted pontiff.\n\nPope Leo XIV was elected on the second day of the conclave, and his opening remarks as leader signalled continuity with Francis, who died on April 21 at age 88. But experts say he is likely to strike a middle path, between furthering Francis’s inclusive agenda and embracing Vatican tradition.\n\n“Peace” was one of the most used words in his brief speech — a choice meant to echo the words that Jesus pronounced after Easter, as Vatican spokesperson Matteo Bruni explained during a news briefing.\n\nLeo XIV called on Catholics to seek “a disarmed peace and a disarming peace” through “dialogue” and “building bridges”, in a brief speech heavy with themes of unity.\n\n“Bravo! That is what we need!” one audience member in the square shouted as the new pope spoke.\n\nAnother, 29-year-old Kasper Mihalak from Denmark, was squeezed in the middle of the crowd hoping to catch a glimpse of the first North American pope.\n\n“I am really excited. Cardinal Prevost, now Leo XIV — it’s gonna be amazing! He said a lot about peace during his speech. I think the world now really needs it,” Mihalak said.\n\nRosaria Venuto could hardly hold back her tears. Early in the morning, she picked up her two children and drove four hours from Ascoli Satriano, a small town in the southern Italian province of Apulia, to be in St Peter’s Square.\n\n“I am deeply moved to have the chance to be here and live through this joy and be a small part of this historical event,” she said.\n\nHis own man\n\nBorn in Chicago, a midwestern city in the United States, Leo XIV spent more than two decades in Peru, where he acquired dual citizenship.\n\nThere, he worked in some of Peru’s poorest areas, and he eventually became the bishop of Chiclayo, in the country’s agricultural north. Then, in 2023, Pope Francis appointed him to lead a powerful office that manages bishops across the world.\n\nPhil Pullella, a Vatican expert who has covered the papacy for more than four decades, said that background offers a degree of continuity with Francis, who hailed from Argentina and advocated against poverty.\n\n“He knows about poverty in Latin America,” Pullella said of Leo XIV. “So, he’s not the same thing as if they had elected some cardinal of New York, for example.”\n\nThat continuity was likely appreciated by conservative camps at the Vatican, as well as liberal-leaning ones, Pullella added.\n\n“He comes from the wealthy world, but he witnessed firsthand the problems of the Global South in a poor country,” he said.\n\nStill, Pullella noted that the way Leo XIV dressed showed that “he is going to be his own man”.\n\nInstead of the simple white cassock that Pope Francis wore in 2013 when he was elected, Leo XIII added a traditional red cape over his vest, symbolising the spiritual and temporal powers of his office.\n\n“In a sense, he is going back a little bit to that kind of tradition,” Pullella said. “He would not have been elected had he not had the votes of the conservative bloc.”\n\nA unifying figure\n\nLeo XIV’s election came as a surprise to many. Many observers were betting on a new pope by nightfall, but few expected only three rounds of voting.\n\nThe crowd was stunned when white smoke started to pour out of the tiny chimney by early evening, at around 6:09pm local time (16:00 GMT).\n\nThat was the signal that — of the 133 cardinals under the age of 80 who were eligible to vote — a candidate had received the two-thirds majority needed to become pope.\n\nThis year’s conclave had the distinction of being the most international in the Vatican’s history: The participating cardinals hailed from more than 70 countries, representing divergent views for the Catholic Church’s future.\n\nThe diversity was part of the legacy of Pope Francis, who appointed cardinals from underrepresented countries like Laos and Haiti to broaden the church’s global appeal.\n\nFrancis spent 12 years as head of the Catholic Church, shaking up the establishment by adopting a distinct style and tone, focused on austerity and advocacy for marginalised populations.\n\nThe late pope’s efforts caused excitement among reformers but also dismay among conservatives, who accused him of diluting the Church’s teachings. Experts say that led to a deep polarisation within the church, with some members criticising Francis for decentralising the church’s authority.\n\nThose experts point out that Leo XIV’s experience in the Roman Curia — the church’s government — was likely a selling point among conservative conclave voters looking for stability in the years ahead.\n\nWhat’s in a name?\n\nWhile Pope Leo XIV’s first moves are yet to be revealed, his choice of name is noteworthy.\n\nBruni, the Vatican spokesperson, noted that “Leo” is a direct reference to Pope Leo XIII, who adopted a new social doctrine in the late 19th century.\n\nIn 1891, Pope Leo XIII wrote an encyclical — or papal letter — known as the Rerum Novarum. It called on Catholics to address the “wretchedness” facing the working class, amid the upheavals of industrialisation and political changes like the unification of Italy.\n\nThat encyclical marked a radical new approach to workers, and it triggered the creation of Catholic newspapers, social cooperatives and banks — a social movement that is still alive today.\n\nBruni said the current Pope Leo hoped to draw a parallel to that time, with its technological revolutions.\n\n“It is not a casual reference to the men and women of their work at a time of artificial intelligence,” Bruni explained.\n\nRobert Orsi, a professor of religious studies at Northwestern University, said the name choice could also signify other historical parallels.\n\nLeo XIII “strongly put down a movement called Americanism,” said Orsi.\n\n“This movement was a kind of nationalist impulse within Catholicism, with national churches claiming to have their own identities, their own particular ways of doing things,” he explained. “And I think by choosing the name Leo XIV, this pope was, without a doubt, signalling a return to a global Catholicism.”\n\nPullella also believes it is noteworthy that, while Leo XIV mentioned his parishioners in Peru, he avoided highlighting his ties with the US.\n\n“I think it’s very significant that he did not give a shout-out to the United States. He didn’t say, ‘I’m from America.’ He didn’t speak in English,” Pullella said.\n\nThat sent a message that “basically he’s not owned by the United States”, Pullella added. Leo XIV has previously been critical of the administration of US President Donald Trump over issues like nationalism and migration, just as the late Pope Francis was.\n\nStill, Orsi predicted the Vatican under the new Pope Leo would be “subtle and wise” in how he deals with Trump in the years to come.","summary":"Experts say Pope Leo is likely to carry forward the legacy of his predecessor Francis, while forging his own path.","url":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/5/9/leone-vatican-crowds-hail-leo-xiv-as-new-pope-of-the-catholic-church?traffic_source=rss","image":"https://www.aljazeera.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/AP25128716635839-1746744592.jpg?resize=1920%2C1440","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-05-09 00:14:46","author":"Apps Support,Virginia Pietromarchi","authors":["Apps Support","Virginia Pietromarchi"],"language":"en","source_country":"QA","sentiment":0.096},{"id":319350528,"title":"World News | Trump Announces Trade Deal with United Kingdom","text":"Washington DC [US], May 9 (ANI): US President Donald Trump on Thursday secured trade deal with UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer.\nTrump made the announcement from the Oval Office today during a televised phone call with Starmer.\nAlso Read | LOI Issued to Elon Musk Firm: The Path Forward for Starlink.\nThe trade agreement with the United Kingdom is US's first since President Donald Trump imposed sweeping tariffs on the country's trading partners.\n\"The agreement with the United Kingdom is a full and comprehensive one that will cement the relationship between the United States and the United Kingdom for many years to come,\" Trump said in a Truth Social post.

They've agreed to open their markets, and that will add USD 5 billion of opportunity to American exporters,\" he said.\nUK will still be under the 10 per cent baseline tariff that Trump has applied to dozens of countries. However, tariffs on vehicles will fall from 25 per cent to 10 per cent to match that baseline.\nStarmer took to X to post, \"Today I've secured a deal with the US that boosts British businesses and saves thousands of British jobs. I promised to protect British car makers and save our steel. This deal delivers on that promise. And British workers, families, and firms will feel the benefit.\"\nLater he also posted on X, \"Last month, I promised workers at Jaguar Land Rover that I would protect their jobs. I kept that promise.\"\nAs per a report in the CNN, Britain will also be able to send 100,000 cars into the United States at a 10 oer cent tariff rate, reduced from the 25 per cent autos tariffs Trump imposed on foreign cars, Lutnick announced. The UK will also join the US in imposing 25 per cent tariffs on foreign steel and aluminum, creating a joint tariff agreement that will create a free trade zone for those metals between the two countries. Pharmaceuticals will also be exempt from tariffs between the two countries.\nTrump's \"reciprocal\" tariffs that went into effect April 7 and were paused for 90 days on April 9 affect dozens of countries. A hundred or so more are subject to the 10 per cent universal tariff, CNN reported.\nMeanwhile, the US President also indicated that he could be open to lowering tariffs on China and on trade with the European Union he said, \"we intend to make a deal with Europe.\" Further Trump said that he plans to announce a replacement for Ed Martin, a loyalist whom he had nominated as the US attorney for Washington, DC.

He has two brothers, Louis Martin and John Joseph.\nHe spent his childhood and adolescence with his family and studied first at the Minor Seminary of the Augustinian Fathers and then at Villanova University in Pennsylvania, where in 1977 he earned a Degree in Mathematics and also studied Philosophy. On September 1 of the same year, he entered the novitiate of the Order of Saint Augustine (O.S.A.) in Saint Louis, in the Province of Our Lady of Good Counsel of Chicago, and made his first profession on September 2, 1978. On August 29, 1981, he took his solemn vows.\nHe received his theological education at the Catholic Theological Union in Chicago. At the age of 27, he was sent by his superiors to Rome to study Canon Law at the Pontifical University of Saint Thomas Aquinas (Angelicum). In Rome, he was ordained a priest on June 19, 1982, at the Augustinian College of Saint Monica by Monsignor Jean Jadot, then Pro-President of the Pontifical Council for Non-Christians, now the Dicastery for Interreligious Dialogue.\nPrevost obtained his licentiate in 1984; and the following year, while preparing his doctoral thesis, was sent to the Augustinian mission in Chulucanas, Piura, Peru (1985-1986). In 1987, he defended his doctoral thesis on \"The Role of the Local Prior in the Order of Saint Augustine\" and was appointed vocation director and missions director of the Augustinian Province of \"Mother of Good Counsel\" in Olympia Fields, Illinois (US).

Meet Leo XIV, the first American pope\n\nCardinal Robert Prevost elected first American-born pope, takes name Pope Leo XIV\n\nFirst American pope is from Chicago, and everybody has jokes about it: ‘All communion wafers will be deep-dish’\n\nHere’s why American-born Cardinal Robert Prevost might have selected Pope Leo XIV as his papal name\n\nPope Leo XIV, the former Cardinal Robert Francis Prevost, was born in Chicago in 1955 and has lived in the city for most of the American portion of his life, with the exception of earning his college degree in math from Villanova.\n\nHe’s the first Augustinian friar to be elected pontiff, a major feather in the cap of the distinguished order that runs Villanova. \n\nHe served two terms as the Prior General, the head of the Augustinians.\n\nHe’s not a provincial Midwesterner. \n\nOne Italian newspaper described him as “the least American of the Americans.”\n\nFluent in Spanish and Italian, he introduced himself in both languages in his first appearance as pope without speaking a word of English.\n\nHe spent almost quarter-century in Peru, first as a missionary and then as a bishop, earning popularity with the Latin American clergy and surviving years of conflict in a country often torn between right-wing authoritarians and Communist guerillas.\n\nHe also spent more than a decade in Rome, where he earned a doctorate in canon law, ran the Augustinian order from an office near St. Peter’s, and has recently served as a key aide to Pope Francis, helping him vet candidates to be bishops.\n\nUnlike Pope Francis, he does not come to Rome as an outsider.\n\nHis choice of Leo as his papal name may be a signal. \n\nPope Leo XIII, who held the papacy from 1878 to 1903, is known for his promotion of Catholic social teachings and advocacy for the rights of workers.\n\nSome critics of electing an American pope argued that it was perilous to choose a citizen of the world’s greatest superpower to also head the church. \n\nThat’s a modern view: the Vatican is in Rome precisely because it was the seat of the world’s greatest empire.\n\nThere’s little risk that an American pope today would become a captive of kings or emperors as happened during medieval times. \n\nNobody expects him to be a pawn of Trump.\n\nHis greater challenge as a diplomat will be standing up to Xi Jinping, who claims the authority to appoint the church’s bishops in China.\n\nUnlike Pope Francis, who often had to clarify or walk back statements he made off the cuff to reporters, the new pope has not traditionally been voluble or freewheeling on the issues of the day, which may have helped him climb the ladder of the church hierarchy.\n\nProgressives hoping for radical changes on moral issues may be disappointed, as they were often disappointed in Pope Francis in spite of his progressive leanings. \n\nAs Bishop and Cardinal Prevost, the new pope sounded traditional notes on the sanctity of the life of the unborn and the perversity of progressive gender ideology.\n\nBut he is seen as sympathetic to the confused efforts by Pope Francis to find ways to allow priests to bless gay couples — an endeavor that divided churches along regional lines and has been characterized by waffling and double-talk from the Vatican.\n\nPope Leo XIV seems to be a humble man. It takes a certain amount of ego to run a big organization and compel it to take your orders.\n\nYet, we hope and expect that popes show the humility to listen to the Holy Spirit and carry forward the teachings of the ages even in times when they are out of fashion.\n\nDan McLaughlin is a senior writer at National Review.","summary":"For the first time, we have an American pope.","url":"https://nypost.com/2025/05/08/opinion/china-finances-and-a-culture-clash-challenges-facing-pope-leo-xiv/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/05/NEWPOP1.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-05-09 00:08:07","author":"Dan McLaughlin","authors":["Dan McLaughlin"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.149},{"id":319349592,"title":"Did newly elected Pope criticise Trump administration?

Robert Prevost greeting Pope John Paul II shortly after.\n\nThe multi-talented Catholic Church head can speak English, Spanish, Italian, French and Portuguese – and can even read Latin and German.\n\nAfter being ordained a priest, he joined a mission in Peru in 1985 where he spent many years heading up a seminary.\n\nHe returned to the US in 1999, but before that had returned regularly to serve as a pastor and a prior in his home city.\n\nAlthough originally American, the new pope also holds Peruvian citizenship and is highly regarded in Peru for his dedicated work with marginalized groups.\n\nPrevost spent 10 years as a local parish pastor and as a teacher at a seminary in Trujillo in northwestern Peru.\n\nDuring his momentous first speech, Leo spoke fondly of his predecessor Francis.\n\n He said: “We still hear in our ears the weak but always courageous voice of Pope Francis who blessed us.”\n\nPope Francis made Prevost the Bishop of Chiclayo in Peru one year after he became Pope.\n\nPrevost was known for his high-profile role as prefect of the Dicastery for Bishops in Latin America – tasked with selecting and supervising bishops.\n\nHe was made archbishop in 2023 and within a few months he was promoted to the cardinal by Francis.\n\nThe horseriding Pope is seen as more traditional than Francis – but not the conservative hardliner some in the church were hoping for after his predecessor’s efforts to make the faith more progressive.\n\nThe new pontiff urged people to “build bridges through dialogue, through encounter, to come together as one people, always in peace”.\n\nHe also spoke in Spanish, saying to his South American friends: “I would particularly like to say hello to my compatriots from Peru.\n\n“It was a great pleasure for me to work in Peru.”\n\nUS President Trump was quick to congratulate the Pope Leo XIV and said it’s “a great honour” for the US.\n\nSir Keir Starmer branded the election of the first American Pope as a “momentous moment” and said that he looks “forward to meeting the Holy Father and continuing to work closely with the Catholic Church”.\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy congratulated the new Pope.\n\nHe said: “Ukraine deeply values the Holy See’s consistent position in upholding international law, condemning the Russian Federation’s military aggression against Ukraine, and protecting the rights of innocent civilians.\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin said he hoped the American pontiff would engage in “constructive dialogue” with the Kremlin.\n\nThe new Pope, who is active on social media, has repeatedly voiced his concerns over Donald Trump‘s immigration policies and shared his progressive views.\n\nBoth Leo and Francis were said to be close and Prevost was considered by Vatican insiders to be a potential kingmaker for the current election.\n\nBut few considered the new Leo XIV the likely winner of the secret vote.\n\nThe last pope to take the name Leo was Leo XIII, an Italian who led the church from 1878 to 1903.\n\nWhite smoke erupted from the Vatican at around 5pm on May 8 as a signal that the new pontiff had been chosen.\n\nThe Pope greeted the world for the first time on the balcony in the iconic St Peter’s Basilica overlooking St Peter’s Square.\n\nThe newly elected pontiff appeared in papal robes – complete with a white silk sash and skullcap and red leather shoes.\n\nThe announcement of the new pope was made after clouds of white smoke or fumata bianca emerged from the chimney of the Sistine Chapel as a bell rang.\n\nCrowds of faithful Catholics erupted with joy and were seen cheering in the iconic St. Peter’s Square.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nFrom a promising math prodigy in America to a daring missionary

And he should know. He's a designer for Zara who helps create the clothes for a brand that's one of the most successful stories in High Street fashion.\n\nZara is owned by Inditex, the world's biggest fashion retailer, which runs a string of store chains including Massimo Dutti and Pull & Bear.\n\nIt relies on 1,800 suppliers across the world, but nearly all the clothes are brought to Spain where the company is based, to be despatched to stores in 97 countries.\n\nZara doesn't advertise and rarely gives interviews. But as it marks 50 years since the opening of its first store, I've come to its vast campus in Galicia to meet the boss and workers for a rare glimpse into how the secretive brand operates.\n\nIt's a time when the company finds itself having to navigate fast-changing markets, with growing competition from ultra-cheap online players Shein and Temu, who ship their goods direct from China, as well as uncertainty surrounding US tariffs.\n\nBut Oscar Garcia Maceiras, Inditex's CEO, says US President Donald Trump's tariffs won't disrupt its supply chains or change Zara's plans to expand further in the US, now its second biggest market.\n\n\"Bear in mind that for us, diversification is key. We are producing in almost 50 different markets with non-exclusive suppliers so we are more than used to adapt ourselves to change,\" he tells me.","url":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c62j2dxe9zyo","image":"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/6b1f/live/916050c0-2c11-11f0-8f57-b7237f6a66e6.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-05-09 00:04:15","author":"Emma Simpson","authors":["Emma Simpson"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":0.779},{"id":319342562,"title":"BBC News weekly quiz: Which star showed off her baby bump at the Met Gala?","text":"Weekly quiz: Which star showed off her baby bump at the Met Gala?\n\nThis week saw Roman Catholic cardinals meet to choose the next pope, people across Europe mark the 80th anniversary of the end of World War Two, and Donald Trump declare war on foreign films.\n\nBut how much attention did you pay to what else has been going on in the world over the past seven days?\n\nQuiz compiled by Ben Fell.\n\nFancy testing your memory?

Discovery is reportedly mulling a separation of its linear networks from its studio and streaming assets – a move that could see CNN spearhead a new, cable-centering company.\n\nThe talks, first reported by CNBC, come after a dip in share price from the conglomerate and a quarterly review that fell short of estimates.\n\nReleased Wednesday, the report showed revenue down 1 percent from the same span last year and net income down 62 percent\n\nThat’s causing a stir from investors, CNBC’s David Faber said – months after WBD CEO David Zaslav reportedly dismissed the move as a bad idea.\n\nIt also comes months after NBC parent Comcast announced it would spin off most of its cable networks into a separate company, after years of hindrance on its share price.\n\nIf WBD follows suit, properties like CNN, TNT, and TBS will no longer fall under its jurisdiction.\n\nThe new, yet-to-be announced firm would also being ripe for acquisition.\n\nAn official announcement may come in coming days, said Squawk Box’s David Faber.\n\nAlexander Sherman, CNBC’s media reporter, added how WBD has already retained bankers to work out options that include a potential separation of the company’s legacy assets from the its streaming and studio entities, such as Max.\n\n‘What Warner Brothers is moving towards, though, is a split, and it’s become relatively clear to me from the many conversations that I’ve had that we could get some sort of an announcement in the not too distant future,’ Faber added on the air Thursday.\n\nSherman added how legacy media firms like Paramount Global and Comcast have wanted to change their asset mix for months, hence the former’s effort to merge with Skydance.\n\nComcast’s SpinCo spinoff serves as further proof, he said – before honing in on how Zaslav for months has been particularly adamant about the need for less regulations on mergers and acquisitions.\n\n‘We just need an opportunity for deregulation, so companies can consolidate and do what we need to be even better,’ Zaslav told reporters at Allen & Co.’s annual Sun Valley conference last year.\n\nHe complained that the previous administration had stymied any chance of such deals, and pined for a more laissez-faire president.\n\nDays later, The Financial Times reported WBD brass had drafted ‘a dramatic plan’ to split its digital streaming and studio ventures from its legacy media networks.\n\nZaslav dismissed the FT report as false. Four months later, Donald Trump won the US election.\n\nWithin days, Puck reported CNN was planning a series of sweeping lay-offs – a forecast that came to fruition after Trump was sworn in.\n\nThree days later, 200 staffers at CNN’s struggling TV division were provided pink slips. \n\nThe firings were billed as just one stage of CNN CEO Mark Thompson’s long-in-the works restructuring plan for the WBD asset, which seeks to put emphasis on CNN’s digital imprint rather than the cable news channel.\n\nIn a statement issued that morning, Thompson warned that future is still unclear.\n\nHe also emphasized the fact that CNN is set to soon roll out a streaming service – one he said will feature its most well-known stars.\n\nSince he was named CEO in 2023, CNN’s ratings have dropped more than 20 percent – now behind even MSNBC. \n\nThe network, for years, was the top dog in terms of cable news – a distinction now held by Fox.\n\n Thompson honed in on this past pedigree when speaking about the layoffs with the New York Times, which he helmed for eight years.\n\n‘In the end, this is about CNN being – as it has been in its history – an indispensable way in which many, many millions of people get their news,’ he said, billing CNN’s secretive streaming service as a potential replacement to TV. \n\n‘This is a moment where the digital story feels like an existential question,’ he continued. ‘If we do not follow the audiences to the new platforms with real conviction and scale, our future prospects will not be good.’ \n\nThompson further warned staffers in the industry that the future of the network is digital – and that linear is clearly on the decline. \n\nThe British media exec also advertised another digital venture set to come out of CNN’s camp later this year – a subscription product surrounding ‘lifestyle’ content.\n\nA split, meanwhile, paves the way for a merger between two of the biggest media companies in the world – WBD and Comcast.\n\nSuch a maneuver could create a de facto sports channel empire – one that would include TNT, the Golf Channel, and USA Network, as well as a range of sports rights that includes the MLB and NHL postseasons and the English Premier League.\n\nThe split, still reportedly being considered, has yet to be solidified.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nWarner Bros.

She was elected as a judge in New York’s Westchester County Court in 1990 before serving three terms as the county’s elected district attorney.\n\nTrump tapped Pirro to at least temporarily lead the nation’s largest U.S. Attorney’s office after pulling his nomination of conservative activist Ed Martin Jr. for the position earlier Thursday. In a post on Truth Social, Trump said he was naming Pirro as the interim U.S. attorney in Washington, D.C., but didn't indicate whether he would nominate her for the Senate-confirmed position on a more permanent basis.\n\n\"Jeanine is incredibly well qualified for this position, and is considered one of the Top District Attorneys in the History of the State of New York. She is in a class by herself,\" Trump wrote.\n\nTrump withdrew Martin from consideration after a key Republican senator said he could not support Martin for the job due to his defense of rioters who stormed the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021.\n\n“He’s a terrific person, and he wasn’t getting the support from people that I thought,” Trump told reporters in the Oval Office on Thursday. He later added, “But we have somebody else that will be great.”\n\nMartin's leading role in Trump's “Stop the Steal” movement was demoralizing for subordinates who spent four years prosecuting over 1,500 riot defendants only to see the president pardon them en masse. Pirro has her own connection to the baseless conspiracy theories of election fraud.\n\nIn 2021, voting technology company Smartmatic USA sued Fox News, Pirro and others for spreading false claims that the company helped “steal” the 2020 presidential election from Trump. The company’s libel suit, filed in a New York state court, sought $2.7 billion from the defendants.\n\nPirro is the latest in a string of Trump appointments coming from Fox News — a list that includes Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, who co-hosted “Fox & Friends Weekend.”\n\n“Jeanine Pirro has been a wonderful addition to The Five over the last three years and a longtime beloved host across Fox News Media who contributed greatly to our success throughout her 14-year tenure. We wish her all the best in her new role in Washington,\" a Fox News Media spokesperson said in a statement.\n\nMartin has served as acting U.S. Attorney for the District of Columbia since Trump’s first week in office. But his hopes of keeping the job faded amid questions about his qualifications and background. Martin had never served as a prosecutor or tried a case before taking office in January.\n\nMartin has stirred up a chorus of critics during his brief but tumultuous tenure in office. He fired and demoted subordinates who worked on politically sensitive cases. He posted on social media about potential targets of investigations. And he forced the chief of the office’s criminal division to resign after directing her to scrutinize the awarding of a government contract during Democratic President Joe Biden’s administration.\n\nMartin’s temporary appointment is due to expire May 20.\n\nPirro, a 1975 graduate of Albany Law School, has significantly more courtroom experience than Martin. She led one of the nation’s first domestic violence units in a prosecutor’s office.\n\nAfter her elected terms as a judge and district attorney, Pirro briefly campaigned in 2005 as a Republican to unseat then-Democratic Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton before announcing that she would would run for New York attorney general instead. She lost that race to Andrew Cuomo, son of former New York Gov. Mario Cuomo.\n\nPirro became an ubiquitous television pundit during O.J. Simpson’s murder trial, often appearing on CNN’s “Larry King Live.” During her time on Fox News, she has frequently interviewed Trump.\n\nIn the final minutes of his first term as president, Trump issued a pardon to Pirro’s ex-husband, Albert Pirro, who was convicted in 2000 on conspiracy and tax evasion charges.","summary":"President Donald Trump said Thursday that he is naming Fox News host Jeanine Pirro, a former county prosecutor and elected judge, to be the top federal prosecutor for the nation's capital after abandoning his first pick for the job.

Robert Prevost greeting Pope John Paul II shortly after.\n\nThe multi-talented Catholic Church head can speak English, Spanish, Italian, French and Portuguese - and can even read Latin and German.\n\nAfter being ordained a priest, he joined a mission in Peru in 1985 where he spent many years heading up a seminary.\n\nHe returned to the US in 1999, but before that had returned regularly to serve as a pastor and a prior in his home city.\n\nDespite being an American the new pontiff holds Peruvian nationality, and is a beloved figure in the country due to his work with marginalised communities.\n\nPrevost spent 10 years as a local parish pastor and as a teacher at a seminary in Trujillo in northwestern Peru.\n\nDuring his momentous first speech, Leo spoke fondly of his predecessor Francis.\n\n He said: \"We still hear in our ears the weak but always courageous voice of Pope Francis who blessed us.\"\n\nPope Francis made Prevost the Bishop of Chiclayo in Peru one year after he became Pope.\n\nPrevost was known for his high-profile role as prefect of the Dicastery for Bishops in Latin America - tasked with selecting and supervising bishops.\n\nHe was made archbishop in 2023 and within a few months he was promoted to the cardinal by Francis.\n\nThe horseriding Pope is seen as more traditional than Francis - but not the conservative hardliner some in the church were hoping for after his predecessor's efforts to make the faith more progressive.\n\nThe new pontiff urged people to \"build bridges through dialogue, through encounter, to come together as one people, always in peace\".\n\nHe also spoke in Spanish, saying to his South American friends: \"I would particularly like to say hello to my compatriots from Peru.\n\n\"It was a great pleasure for me to work in Peru.\"\n\nUS President Trump was quick to congratulate the Pope Leo XIV and said it's \"a great honour\" for the US.\n\nSir Keir Starmer branded the election of the first American Pope as a “momentous moment” and said that he looks “forward to meeting the Holy Father and continuing to work closely with the Catholic Church”.\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy congratulated the new Pope.\n\nHe said: \"Ukraine deeply values the Holy See’s consistent position in upholding international law, condemning the Russian Federation’s military aggression against Ukraine, and protecting the rights of innocent civilians.\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin said he hoped the American pontiff would engage in \"constructive dialogue\" with the Kremlin.\n\nThe new Pope, who is active on social media, has repeatedly voiced his concerns over Donald Trump's immigration policies and shared his progressive views.\n\nBoth Leo and Francis were said to be close and Prevost was considered by Vatican insiders to be a potential kingmaker for the current election.\n\nBut few considered the new Leo XIV the likely winner of the secret vote.\n\nThe last pope to take the name Leo was Leo XIII, an Italian who led the church from 1878 to 1903.\n\nWhite smoke erupted from the Vatican at around 5pm on May 8 as a signal that the new pontiff had been chosen.\n\nThe Pope greeted the world for the first time on the balcony in the iconic St Peter's Basilica overlooking St Peter's Square.\n\nThe newly elected pontiff appeared in papal robes - complete with a white silk sash and skullcap and red leather shoes.\n\nThe announcement of the new pope was made after clouds of white smoke or fumata bianca emerged from the chimney of the Sistine Chapel as a bell rang.\n\nCrowds of faithful Catholics erupted with joy and were seen cheering in the iconic St. Peter's Square.","summary":"","url":"https://www.thesun.ie/news/15178742/horseriding-maths-whizz-chicago-robert-prevost/","image":"https://www.thesun.ie/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/05/2025-vatican-city-vatican-white-993122267_910ac8.jpg?strip=all&quality=100&w=1920&h=1080&crop=1","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-05-09 00:01:59","author":"Harvey Geh","authors":["Harvey Geh"],"language":"en","source_country":"ie","sentiment":0.146},{"id":319342106,"title":"Trump nominates Daniel Rosen as next U.S. Attorney for Minnesota","text":"President Donald Trump has nominated Minneapolis commercial litigator Daniel Rosen to be the next U.S. Attorney for Minnesota.\n\nEarlier this year, Rosen, of Rosen LLC, was one of three candidates recommended for the position by Minnesota’s Republican congressional delegation to replace Andrew Luger, who stepped down as the state’s top federal prosecutor before Trump’s inauguration.\n\nThe nomination was referred Tuesday to the U.S. Senate’s Committee on the Judiciary, which will review Rosen’s qualifications before it goes to the full senate for a vote.\n\nThe congressional delegation — Reps. Tom Emmer, Brad Finstad, Michelle Fischbach and Pete Stauber — issued a statement Wednesday calling Rosen “one of the sharpest legal minds in the entire country.”\n\n“With over three decades of experience as an attorney and a proven commitment to public safety, Dan will uphold the rule of law and keep criminals off our streets,” the statement says. “As fraud and crime run rampant under Governor Walz’s watch, we urge our colleagues in the Senate to act quickly to confirm Dan’s nomination.”\n\nThe delegation’s other nominees sent to Trump on Jan. 27 were Erica MacDonald, who he appointed as Minnesota’s U.S. Attorney during his first term as president, and Ronald Schutz, who has held senior leadership roles at Robins Kaplan LLC in Minneapolis for nearly three decades.\n\nRosen is a U.S. Navy veteran and University of Minnesota Law School graduate who has over 30 years of practice focusing on commercial litigation in federal and state courts, according to the delegation’s letter to Trump.\n\n“He has used his expertise to advocate for community and charitable issues, especially matters of particular interest to the American Jewish community,” the letter continues.\n\nRosen previously served as a partner of the Parker Rosen firm and was partner-in-charge when Miami-based law firm Kluger Kaplan opened a satellite office in Minneapolis in 2017.\n\nIf confirmed, Rosen will oversee a U.S. attorney’s office with about 140 staffers, including more than 70 attorneys. The office is headquartered at the federal courthouse in Minneapolis, and a branch office is maintained in St. Paul.\n\nUnder Luger’s leadership, the attorney’s office prioritized the prosecution of crimes related to gun and gang violence while also tackling the $250 million Feeding Our Future fraud scheme.\n\nLisa Kirkpatrick is the acting U.S. attorney.","summary":"The nomination was referred Tuesday to the Senate’s Committee on the Judiciary. ","url":"https://www.twincities.com/2025/05/08/trump-nominates-daniel-rosen-us-attorney-minnesota/","image":"https://www.twincities.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/STP-L-FEEDING-0225-Courthouse.jpg?w=1024&h=577","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-05-08 23:59:27","author":"Nick Ferraro","authors":["Nick Ferraro"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.498},{"id":319345810,"title":"Karoline Leavitt's VERY MAGA office décor... and how she 'balances' being a mom in the White House","text":"A revealing photo gave a glimpse into Karoline Leavitt's White House office and showed how the press secretary balances the demands of both her job and motherhood. \n\nDonald Trump's aide Margo Martin captured Leavitt's literal balancing act in her office on Thursday and shared it on X. \n\n'Walked in to @PressSec typing with one hand, and feeding her son with the other. Super Mom!' Martin said.\n\nThe press secretary, 27, wore a pink dress as she worked from her desk and fed her nine-month-old son Niko a bottle.\n\nNiko's pacifier and toy were placed on the desk among Leavitt's neatly organized papers.\n\nThe working mom appeared to be drinking an iced green beverage from Tatte, likely a matcha of sorts. A sparkling matcha lemonade from Tatte costs $5.50, while an iced matcha latte costs $4.50 for a 12oz or $5.00 for a 16oz.\n\nLeavitt had several photos throughout her office, including a cutout of her in a black dress posing with Trump in a blue suit and red tie from the campaign trail placed on the heater. \n\nLeavitt posted the same photo to Instagram on January 1, 2024, with the caption, '2024. LETS GO! us.'\n\nOn her corkboard, Leavitt pinned two pictures of her son: one of her holding the infant up on the beach and another of the baby sitting on a plane seat with a pillow bearing the presidential seal. \n\nShe also has a signed group photograph of seventh-grade students from the George Walton Academy. \n\nMiddle schoolers from the Georgia private school - where tuition costs $16,065 a year - visited Washington, DC, in March. \n\nDuring their field trip, the group visited the White House, where they met Leavitt and posed for the photo. \n\nAdditionally, she has a meme of a man in a white shirt with his hand up to a brain saying, 'No thanks. I won't be needing that. I believe everything the legacy media shows.' \n\nOn Monday, Leavitt shared a rare glimpse into her family life with a series of sweet snaps from a weekend trip to Palm Beach, Florida, with husband Nicholas Riccio, 59, and their young son.\n\nThe family spent the weekend at Trump's Mar-A-Lago, and Leavitt captured adorable photos of the occasion.\n\nOne picture showed the political aide smiling on a green couch while she held her young son, who was dressed in a cute checkered onesie, on her lap.\n\nIn the second snap, Riccio - who is 32 years Leavitt's senior - also stepped into the frame as the trio posed in front of a pool at sunset.\n\nLeavitt captured another heartwarming photo of her spouse dressed more informally while cradling Niko and kissing his cheek.\n\nAnd the final picture in her adorable carousel simply alluded to the family relaxing on sun loungers while draped under towels.\n\nThe mom-of-one captioned the post: 'Weekends in Palm Beach.","summary":"A revealing photo gave a glimpse into Karoline Leavitt's 'balancing act' in her White House office.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-14693569/karoline-leavitt-maga-office-balances-motherhood-white-house.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/05/08/23/98197075-0-image-m-17_1746743227384.jpg","video":"https://videos.dailymail.co.uk/video/mol/2025/05/02/2509883872343536540/1024x576_MP4_2509883872343536540.mp4","publish_date":"2025-05-08 23:58:46","author":"Editor,Rachel Bowman","authors":["Editor","Rachel Bowman"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":0.427},{"id":319343844,"title":"Wynne Evans sparks backlash after being announced as the performer for children's charity fundraiser - despite being embroiled in Strictly sex slur scandal","text":"Black Friday\n\nKim Kardashian\n\nVictoria Beckham\n\nHarry Styles\n\nAmanda Holden\n\nBritain's Got Talent\n\nPrivacy Policy\n\nFriday, May 9th 2025\n\n5-Day Forecast\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTrump hails Brexit for making UK trade deal possible: Inside astonishing day that saw President blindside Starmer during Arsenal match and resulted in Tories deriding 'Diet Coke' agreement\n\nMeet Pope Leo XIV: The tennis-playing cardinal who fired volleys at Donald Trump on social media\n\nPope Leo XIV 'looked the other way' when confronted with child sex abuse allegations against priest in his Chicago church\n\nMy 'perfect' husband swept me off my feet.

Email tips@dailymail.com\nBy DOLLY BUSBY SHOWBUSINESS REPORTER \n Published:00:48 BST, 9 May 2025 |Updated:00:58 BST, 9 May 2025 \n\nAmbassadors of a children's charity in Wales have been left 'horrified' after disgraced opera singer Wynne Evans was announced as the 'surprise' act for their fundraising lunch.\nA post on the Women in Wales Facebook page on Wednesday announced the 53-year-old, made famous by the Go Compare adverts, would perform at the event today.\nIn January, The Mail on Sunday caught on video the BBC Radio Wales host making a vile sexual slur to his female co-star Janette Manrara on the Strictly Come Dancing live tour.\nHe was subsequently dropped from the tour and the BBC has launched a wide-ranging investigation which goes beyond the Strictly live incident.\nThe Women in Wales Facebook post read: 'Wynne will be filling the room with his breathtaking vocals, an unforgettable performance for you all this Friday.'\nThe announcement was followed by a post from Mr Evans, who gleefully wrote on his own social media page: 'Thank you to all the organisations, promoters, charities and people who have stuck by me and not believed the lies.\n\nAmbassadors of a children's charity in Wales have been left 'horrified' after disgraced opera singer Wynne Evans was announced as the 'surprise' act for their fundraising lunch\n'Let's all move forward together and find a way and a platform to make people smile by lunchtime once again.'\nBut when supporters of the charity – which raises money to support children's charities and projects in Wales – were approached by the Mail they admitted no prior knowledge of his performance and distanced themselves from the event.\nOne woman involved in the charity, who chose to remain anonymous, said: 'I had no idea and I am absolutely horrified and outraged Wynne Evans is performing. \n'It flies in the face of everything we have been campaigning tirelessly for and puts our hard work back. This is unacceptable. I want nothing to do with it.'\nAnother added: 'We are a women's charity, and I am so upset we would be associated with him.'\nMr Evans was previously condemned by Women's Aid after he and his Strictly partner Katya Jones dismissed a 'grope' incident as an unexplained 'in-joke'.\nWomen's Aid slammed the pair's response, saying that 'inappropriate behaviour towards women is no laughing matter'.\nThe singer's girlfriend, Liz Brookes, 50, is the events manager for Women in Wales and is said to be 'completely supporting' him. They have been in a relationship for a year and she stood by him throughout his tumultuous time on Strictly.\n\nIn January, The Mail on Sunday caught on video the BBC Radio Wales host making a vile sexual slur to his female co-star Janette Manrara on the Strictly Come Dancing live tour\nThey met at an event after his 16-year marriage ended, and Ms Brookes helped turn his life around by encouraging an interest in fitness and helping him get in better shape for Strictly.\nWomen in Wales is a children's charity run by women, founded 31 years ago by Princess Anne's lady-in-waiting Dame Shân Legge-Bourke. Last night, sources close to Dame Shân said the 81-year-old was not involved in the organisation of the luncheon and had never been due to attend.\nMr Evans has been contacted for comment. A source previously told The Sun he had been 'wronged' and his legal team were assembling a 30-page dossier to help his case.\nWynne EvansStrictly Come DancingBBC\n\nShare or comment on this article: \nWynne Evans sparks backlash after being announced as the performer for children's charity fundraiser - despite being embroiled in Strictly sex slur scandal\n\nAdd comment\n\n Share what you think\n\nNo comments have so far been submitted.

from Haiti, Cuba, Nicaragua and Venezuela.\n\nThe Biden administration granted temporary protected status for 532,000 people from those nations, which gives them the ability to work and live in the United States while they have protected status, NBC News reported.\n\nHomeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem wants to end their temporary protected status, which lasts for up to two years, but a lower court ruling blocked that effort.\n\nU.S. District of Massachusetts Judge Indira Talwani ruled the Trump administration can't arbitrarily remove the protected status and instead must address each individual's respective case before ending TPS and undertaking deportations.\n\nSolicitor General John Sauer said Talwani \"nullified one of the administration's most consequential immigration policy decisions\" and wants the Supreme Court to resolve the matter.\n\nThe Supreme Court has already received eight emergency requests filed by the Trump administration through March 28.\n\nMany more cases are headed to the Supreme Court, which could swamp it with legal filings.\n\nFederal district court judges have blocked Trump administration policies at least 17 times during President Donald Trump's first 100 days in office.\n\nMany of those rulings have been overturned by appellate and Supreme Court rulings, but some also have been upheld.\n\nShortly after being sworn in as president on Jan. 20, Trump signed several executive orders, including ending TPS status for many.\n\nPresident Joe Biden, days before leaving office, extended TPS protections for many people from Venezuela, Haiti, Venezuela, and other nations.\n\nTrump ordered an end to their TPS status to undertake mass deportations of those who do not self-deport.","summary":"The Trump administration on

Baraka, who is among six Democrats running in the June 10 primary for governor.\n\nThe mayor appeared at the gate of the facility on Tuesday and Wednesday. Civilian security guards had been stationed at the gate on Tuesday, but on Wednesday, Baraka was met by half a dozen armed ICE officers dressed in combat fatigues.\n\nThe scene remained peaceful and cooperative, but Baraka said the officers’ presence was a show of federal might meant to intimidate city inspectors.\n\nMcLaughlin said assaults on ICE officers were up by more than 400% since this time last year, and that “we will not tolerate any activity that compromises the safety of our officers and employees.”\n\n“The Mayor has been informed that he is more than welcome to enter the facility, as long as he follows security protocols like everyone else,” McLaughlin added. “He keeps refusing to do so, presumably in an effort to stage press opportunities to help him in his bid for governor.”\n\nMcLaughlin did not specify what protocols she was referring to or explain how the mayor’s appearances this week at the facility, Delaney Hall, posed a danger.\n\nBaraka responded to McLaughlin’s criticism in a statement Thursday night, insisting that his appearance never put the ICE officers or anyone else in danger.\n\nBaraka said that accusing him of political grandstanding ignored his history as a peace activist and community organizer, “who goes out into the streets to engage with parties in conflict and to correct misperceptions and disagreements that threaten the peace in Newark.” \n\n“I assume ‘Sanctuary Mayor’ is intended as an insult,” Baraka stated. “But the City of Newark is a city of immigrants, a port city practically in the shadow of the Statue of Liberty, and a multicultural community proud of its diversity and spirit of generosity, tolerance and welcome. As mayor, it is my honor to preserve and uphold that standard.”\n\nMcLaughlin’s remarks were in response to a request for comment from NJAM on Wednesday, when Baraka and other city officials went to the detention facility, known as Delaney Hall, to serve summonses on its private owner-operator, the GEO Group of Boca Ratón, Florida.\n\nThe summonses assert that GEO has refused to grant fire and code officials access to Delaney Hall and has placed a padlock on the gate, violating state law.\n\nCity officials had tried to serve the summonses on the GEO Group on Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday, when a company representative refused to accept them each time, forcing city officials to leave them on the gate, a retractable chain link fence topped with razor wire.\n\nBaraka was at the gate on Tuesday and Wednesday seeking access to the facility, but was also turned away.\n\nThe GEO Group’s unarmed civilian security guards were joined at the gate by the armed ICE officers on Wednesday and Thursday.\n\nImmigrant rights groups have staged daily protests outside the facility.\n\nIn a lawsuit against the GEO Group, the city has asserted that the company must obtain a new certificate of occupancy, or CO, for Delaney Hall’s reopening as an immigrant detention center.\n\nThe GEO Group has insisted that a CO previously issued by the city remains valid, an assertion backed by McLaughlin on Thursday, when she also dismissed the city’s arguments that the contractor had endangered Delaney Hall workers and detainees.\n\n“We have valid permits,” McLaughlin stated. “And there are no safety issues.”\n\nIn its lawsuit against the GEO Group, which does not name ICE as a defendant, the city is asking a judge to order the company to comply with its demands. Lawyers for the parties held a telephone status conference Wednesday afternoon with U.S. Magistrate Judge Leda D. Wettre in Newark, who did not issue an order, said Newark Corporation Counsel Kenyatta Stewart, the city’s top lawyer.\n\nOpposition to Delaney Hall’s reopening as a detention center began mounting in April 2024 among immigrant rights groups and elected officials, notably U.S. Sen. Cory Booker, a former Newark mayor.\n\nIt was just after ICE announced, under then-President Joe Biden, that it was negotiating with the GEO Group for a deal to house undocumented immigrants awaiting deportation hearings and possible flights out of the country.\n\nNewark Liberty International Airport is less than two miles south of Delaney Hall. The only other immigrant detention center in New Jersey is less than a mile from the airport in Elizabeth.\n\nOpposition to Delaney Hall’s reopening intensified in February when ICE and the GEO Group announced they had reached a deal for the company to operate the facility under a 15-year contract worth $1 billion to the GEO Group.\n\nThough negotiations began under the Biden Administration, ICE noted that Delaney Hall would be the first new immigrant detention center to open under President Donald Trump following his January swearing-in.\n\nICE and GEO never announced an opening date. But on Monday, Baraka called a press conference to say city officials had learned from the husband of a detainee that Delaney Hall had begun holding her and others there last week.\n\nICE then acknowledged that the facility began holding detainees on May 1.\n\nNobody knows Jersey better than N.J.com.

Other service members will be given 30 days to self-identify.\n\n On Tuesday, the Supreme Court allowed President Donald Trump‘s administration to start enforcing a ban on transgender people serving in the U.S. military that had been previously been blocked by lower courts. \n\n “After a SCOTUS victory for @POTUS , TRANS is out at the DOD,” wrote Hegseth in an X post on Thursday, alongside a video of him vowing to “relentlessly pursue the President’s agenda.” Reading from the memo, Hegseth said: “In accordance with policy now reinstated, Service members who have a current diagnosis or history of, or exhibit symptoms consistent with, gender dysphoria may elect to separate voluntarily.” The Fox host then turned back to the camera, echoing his early statement: “This is what the American people voted for and we’re going to continue to relentlessly pursue it.”\n\n According to The Associated Press, department officials have said medical records will indicate which service members have been diagnosed with “gender dysphoria, who show symptoms or are being treated.”\n\n Following the Court’s ruling, Emily Shilling, a Navy commander, who had sued to block the ban along with other transgender service members, told NBC News: “Transgender service members have served this nation with courage, skill, and selflessness for years.”\n\n “I know this decision will cause fear and doubt in the ranks. To those feeling shaken, I say this: stand tall,” Shilling continued. “You are not alone. You are part of a community that will fight for you, stand beside you, and never stop pushing forward.”","summary":"Earlier this week, the Supreme Court allowed President Trump's administration to start enforcing a ban on transgender service members","url":"https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-news/us-military-start-removing-transgender-troops-1235335000/","image":"https://www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/us-military-transgender-troops-ban.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-05-08 23:52:06","author":"Charisma Madarang","authors":["Charisma Madarang"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.225},{"id":319345094,"title":"ESPN panelist says 'trans kids deserve to play sports' in final appearance before show's cancellation","text":"\"Around the Horn\" leaves the airwaves later this month, which means some of the show's panelists are making their final appearances in the coming weeks.

The winner of the episode typically delivers a short monologue, and Fagan said \"being on this show has been a privilege and a platform.\" With Thursday marking her final episode, she used that platform to make a plea for transgender athletes. \"I know it's my last time on it, and I want to say something worthy of that platform, and that's trans kids deserve to play sports,\" she said. \"Think about what you remember from your time playing sports. Ninety-nine percent of it is finding that jersey for the first time, your favorite number, community, joy, those high-fives. \"It's that moment when you have a great play with a teammate. It's the feeling of belonging. And it does not know gender. Trans kids deserve the same as everyone else does. \"Sports is joy. Sports is humanity. And the more people who have that, the better.\" CHET LEMON, WORLD SERIES CHAMPION WITH TIGERS, DIES AT 70 There is no law or order that bans transgender children from participating in sports. President Donald Trump signed an executive order in February that prohibits biological males identifying as girls or women from competing against biological females. ESPN announced the show's cancellation in March, and shortly after, former panelist Jay Mariotti, who was a regular on the show until a domestic violence arrest in 2010, said in an interview the show is being canceled because it went \"woke.\" \"I think what John Skipper wanted from some of the shows was he started to install people on the shows who became anti-Trump,\" Mariotti told Front Office Sports. In a recent post on his own Substack, \"Around the Horn ended a long time ago ¸— when I left the show,\" Mariotti reiterated that some of the panelists went \"woke\" while others were \"on dope.\" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP There are now just 11 episodes left of the show, which is over 20 years old.

Email tips@dailymail.com \nBy CHARLOTTE DEAN FOR MAILONLINE \n Published:00:37 BST, 9 May 2025 |Updated:00:50 BST, 9 May 2025 \n\nThe last photograph of the Beckham family with their eldest son Brooklyn and his wife Nicola Peltz before their feud kicked off shows them smiling at Christmas time.\nThe picture of familial bliss shows Victoria and David and their four children with Nicola gathered in front of a Christmas tree, posted on Boxing Day last year.\nThe image is a far cry from the tense relations between the Beckhams and their son and his wife, following reports that things are 'beyond repair'.\nJust five months after Victoria wrote 'being together makes me so happy', Brooklyn and Nicola failed to show up to any of David's 50th birthday celebrations.Things came to a head when Brooklyn and Nicola didn't attend, with The Mail revealing that a rift with Nicola is at the centre of the breakdown in relations.\nThe image showed Cruz, 20, Romeo, 22, Brooklyn, 26, Harper, 13, David, Victoria and Nicola, 29, all gathered together in a picture perfect moment.\nThe caption, read: 'Being together for the holidays makes me so happy xxxx I love you all so much @davidbeckham @brooklynpeltzbeckham @romeobeckham @cruzbeckham @nicolaannepeltzbeckham #harperseven x.'\n\nThe last photograph of the Beckham family with their eldest son Brooklyn and his wife Nicola Peltz before their feud kicked off shows them smiling at Christmas time \n\nA couple of months before, they were all together again at the Los Angeles launch of Brooklyn's hot sauce brand Cloud 23\nProving that they were on good terms at the time, Nicola replied to her mother-in-law: 'I love you all so much!'\nA couple of months before, they were all together again at the Los Angeles launch of Brooklyn's hot sauce brand Cloud 23.\nThe family put their full support behind Brooklyn as he released his latest venture as they all travelled across the pond to attend the event.\nThe same month they gathered again in London for a separate launch of the £15 sauce at a London Wholefoods store.\nIn September, they all gathered in Paris to support her at fashion week as she presented her SS25 collection.\nAmid claims of the family feud, David and Victoria are said to be 'deeply sad' about the rift, while reports the pair were unwelcoming towards Nicola have been shut down by sources close to the couple. \nFriends of the Beckhams told The Mirror the couple backed Nicola 'at every opportunity' and that there was 'no anger but just a deep sense of sorrow about how things have turned out.'\nThe source added: 'They have gone above and beyond to help Nicola with her endeavours.' \n\nThe family put their full support behind Brooklyn as he released his latest venture as they all travelled across the pond to attend the event\n\nIn September, they all gathered in Paris to support her at fashion week as she presented her SS25 collection\nNoting that the family attended the premiere of Nicola’s film Lola in Los Angeles last year, they went on: 'Victoria was even on crutches after injuring her foot but wouldn’t miss it for the world as she knew how important it was for Nicola, and her son.'\nRumours of the family rift began to ramp up around the time of David's birthday last week, which culminated with a massive party held at London's esteemed Michelin-star restaurant Core on Saturday night.\nThe bash was attended by A-list stars including Tom Cruise while David and Victoria's children Romeo, 22, Cruz, 20, and Harper, 13, all attended, though Brooklyn was notably absent.\nIt was claimed Brooklyn and Nicola pulled out of attending the Met Gala with the intention of attending David's birthday party, but were no shows at both events.\nBrooklyn was reportedly planning to attend David's party, but felt too uncomfortable to come after he felt Nicola was being blamed for the rift with his family.\nClaims that Brooklyn and Nicola were rebuffed when they asked David and Victoria to celebrate David's birthday privately were also said to be untrue.\nSources close to Nicola told TMZ they wanted 'to get together privately' to avoid Romeo's girlfriend Kim Turnbull as the couple are said to 'have a problem' with her.\nBrooklyn also missed out on David's early celebrations in Miami last month as well as parties in the Cotswolds, France and London this week.\n\nRumours of the family rift began to ramp up around the time of David's birthday last week, which culminated with a massive party held at London's esteemed Michelin-star restaurant Core on Saturday night \n\nThe bash was attended by A-list stars including Tom Cruise while David and Victoria's children Romeo, 22, Cruz, 20, and Harper, 13, all attended, though Brooklyn was notably absent \nFollowing the birthday party snub, it was revealed Brooklyn also declined an invitation by his father to join him and his brothers on a 'boys' fishing trip to celebrate his 50th.\nThe Mail revealed David invited Brooklyn on a short break six months ago when he began planning, yet his son failed to go despite arriving in the UK the day he went with Romeo and Cruz.\nSources have suggested that Brooklyn's decision was influenced by his American actress wife Nicola.\n'Brooklyn was asked to join them ages ago,' one claimed. 'Then he came to London in time but he didn't go. Once again David made the best of things and had a great time with Cruz and Romeo.'\nDavid still offered an olive branch to his son as he shared snaps from the trip, as he captioned one of his posts: 'You were missed @brooklynbeckham.'\nThe Mail revealed Romeo's girlfriend Kim Turnbull is being made the 'scapegoat' in the feud between Brooklyn and David.\nKim and Brooklyn were undeniably close for a brief period – as photographs of them together in 2016 show - but suggestions that they were ever an item are wide of the mark, according to well-informed sources who spoke to The Mail.\nIn fact, younger brother Cruz personally shut down the gossip recently when he responded to an Instagram post showing a picture of Romeo and Kim together.\n\nBrooklyn and his wife Nicola were no-shows at any of David's birthday events last week despite allegedly pulling out of the Met Gala to attend (pictured at the gala in 2022)\nIn a now-deleted message, one user commented: 'It's appropriate to date your brother's ex too? Cool.'\nCruz replied: 'Brooklyn and Kim never dated.'\nOne friend told the Mail's Katie Hind at the weekend: 'This is nothing to do with Kim and is all about Nicola.\n\n Victoria Beckham gives a behind the scenes glimpse of David's 50th birthday that son Brooklyn didn't show up for amid family 'feud' \n'All David and Victoria want is their son back – and they will be there to welcome him any time.'\nFamily friends claim Brooklyn's wife has a pattern of 'starting an argument' before family events and then preventing her husband from attending.\nSome believe that friends of Nicola have been behind the briefings about Kim being the cause of Brooklyn's rift with his family, some of which went so far to claim that he had told them he refused to come to any event at which Kim was present.\nA source close to the family told MailOnline: 'Brooklyn was close to Kim because she was dating Rocco and they all hung out in a tightknit friendship group. But that was years ago. Brooklyn and Kim were close, but there was never any romance.\n'It seems Nicola doesn't like Brooklyn spending any time with the Beckhams full stop and is using his previous closeness to Kim and her getting in with the family as a reason to not be around them. \n'She denies it, but Nicola has been controlling him since the wedding. The family - including the brothers - have had enough of it.\n'This is the narrative that's been put out to other news outlets, that Romeo is dating his brother's ex-girlfriend - and that's really weird, so that's why they wouldn't want to be around the family when she is there.\n'But none of this is true. And it's really upset Romeo and his parents because Kim is seemingly being used by Nicola as a reason to start the rift. Romeo is furious at the suggestion that he would bring an ex-girlfriend of Brooklyn into the family when there never was any romance.'\n\nShare or comment on this article: \nThe final smiling family portrait before the Beckhams were torn apart - and what Nicola Peltz said about her mother-in-law Victoria\n\nAdd comment\n\nComments 10\n\n Share what you think\n\nWorst rated\n\nThe comments below have not been moderated.\n\nThe views expressed in the contents above are those of our users and do not necessarily reflect the views of MailOnline.\n\nAdd your comment\n\nEnter your comment\n\nBy posting your comment you agree to our house rules.\n\nSubmit Comment\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual.\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual\n\nWe will automatically post your comment and a link to the news story to your Facebook timeline at the same time it is posted on MailOnline.

(Photo illustration by Chesnot/Getty Images)\nGetty Images\n\nBitcoin prices rose sharply today, climbing above the crucial $100,000 level and reaching their highest since January after CryptoQuant’s Bitcoin: Bull Score Index showed a bullish reading of 80.\n\nSince the aforementioned index attained this figure not only today, but also on May 1, 2, 3, and 7, it has repeatedly tied for its loftiest value since January 30, additional CryptoQuant data reveals.\n\nThis coincided with the digital currency rising from roughly $95,000 on May 1 to more than $104,000 today, according to Coinbase figures from TradingView.\n\nJulio Moreno, head of research for CryptoQuant, shed some light on what this reading means, specifying via Telegram chat that “The index measures demand, valuation and liquidity conditions for Bitcoin. As long as the index is at 60 or above it signals bullish sentiment and supports higher prices.”\n\nHe noted that the Bitcoin: Bull Score Index sank to as little as 10 in early April, which means that the measure increased 700% in roughly the space of a month.\n\nJoe DiPasquale, CEO of cryptocurrency hedge fund manager BitBull Capital, also weighed in how the mindset of investors has strengthened lately.\n\nMORE FOR YOU\n\nPope Betting Odds: Parolin Surges As White Smoke Signals Conclave Ends (Updated)\n\nFirst American Pope Named: Trump, Vance Congratulate Robert Francis Prevost On Election As Pope Leo XIV (Live Updates)\n\nApple About To Make Unexpected Free Offer To All iPhone 13 Users\n\n“There’s little doubt that sentiment around bitcoin has improved markedly in recent weeks. CryptoQuant’s Bull Score Index hitting 80 — the highest since January — reinforces what we’re seeing on-chain and across trading desks: renewed conviction.”\n\nTariff Talks\n\nBitcoin prices rallied today after President Donald Trump announced that he and U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer had managed to work out a trade deal that both heads of state described as advantageous for their countries.\n\n“The deal includes billions of dollars of increased market access for American exports, especially in agriculture, dramatically increasing access for American beef, ethanol, and virtually all of the products produced by our great farmers,\" said Trump, according to a White House statement.\n\n“This is going to boost trade between and across our countries. It’s going to not only protect jobs, but create jobs, opening market access,” Starmer added.\n\nThe U.S. will continue to impose a 10% baseline tariff, the statement revealed, but the nation has agreed to change up its treatment of automobiles imported from the U.K.\n\n“Under the deal, the first 100,000 vehicles imported into the U.S. by UK car manufacturers each year are subject to the reciprocal rate of 10% and any additional vehicles each year are subject to 25% rates,” the announcement specified.\n\nMultiple Bullish Factors\n\nWhile announcing this deal, Trump expressed optimism that the 145% tariff that the U.S. has imposed on Chinese imports would soon come down, according to Reuters.\n\nSeveral analysts cited these development as contributing to bitcoin’s latest price gains, but emphasized that other causes helped drive the digital currency higher.\n\nWhen asked what fueled bitcoin’s latest gains, Tim Enneking, managing partner of Psalion, stated via email that “I think the proximate cause was clearly the US-UK announcement of a trade agreement this morning – which was teased beginning yesterday (many details of which, however, remain to be finalized).”\n\n“However, that was far from the entire reason and really wouldn’t be sufficient to explain the rather large BTC (and ETH) move of the past couple of days,” he added.\n\n“Mid-level talks between the US and China, which were announced yesterday, kicked things off. But, perhaps more important than either, BTC has been like an ever-tighter coiling spring since it bounced off of $74.5k in early April,” said Enneking, focusing on the strong, upward trend the digital asset has been experiencing lately.\n\nDiPasquale also claimed that myriad developments placed upward pressure on bitcoin prices, indicating via email that “Bitcoin’s surge above $100,000 appears to be driven by a convergence of macro tailwinds and narrative momentum.”\n\n“The announcement of a new U.S.-U.K. trade deal under Trump likely contributed to broader optimism in risk assets, reinforcing the idea that a more favorable geopolitical and regulatory environment could benefit digital assets. However, bitcoin’s move is also powered by deeper structural factors — from ongoing institutional accumulation to the scarcity effect post-halving,” he stated.\n\nMajor Investors ‘Never Lost The Faith’\n\nEnneking spoke to the optimism of major players, emphasizing that they never lost confidence that bitcoin would recover after falling below $75,000 last month.\n\n“Whales never lost the faith that BTC was going up from there to set a new ATH and not down as they steadily accumulated,” he stated.\n\n“That institutional confidence has now been justified, triggered and supported by today’s tradfi macro events,” Enneking added.\n\nFollow me on Twitter or LinkedIn.\nEditorial StandardsForbes Accolades","summary":"Bitcoin prices climbed above the crucial $100,000 level and reached a three-month high after a CryptoQuant sentiment index showed a highly bullish reading.","url":"https://www.forbes.com/sites/digital-assets/2025/05/08/bitcoin-rallies-past-100000-after-highly-bullish-sentiment-reading/","image":"https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/66206a94f5f4c0c35485b915/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-05-08 23:45:39","author":"Charles Lloyd Bovaird II,Senior Contributor","authors":["Charles Lloyd Bovaird II","Senior Contributor"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.03},{"id":319340728,"title":"NFL fan behind $100m Shedeur Sanders lawsuit reveals the shocking conspiracy he wants to uncover","text":"EXCLUSIVENFL fan behind $100m Shedeur Sanders lawsuit reveals the shocking conspiracy he wants to uncover\n\nREAD MORE: Jalen Hurts branded 'anti-American' for attending the Met Gala \n\nBy ALEX RASKIN\n\nPublished: 00:18 BST, 9 May 2025 | Updated: 00:42 BST, 9 May 2025\n\nThe 55-year-old Georgia man suing the NFL over Shedeur Sanders' draft-day tumble not only wants $100 million in damages, but a discovery process that proves an illegal conspiracy against the former Colorado quarterback and current Cleveland Browns rookie.\n\n'That is the function of the lawsuit,' the man identified in the filing as John Doe told DailyMail.com in an exclusive interview on Thursday. 'We should get access to all the teams that he's talked to, every team that he's interviewed [with] so we can dispel the notions that he tanked his interviews and things of that nature.\n\n'We should be able to get all the scouts that visited Colorado and their notes to prove that he had a high draft grade. And then we will have to prove… how did he go from one draft grade to being taken off the board?'\n\nSanders' stunning downfall at last month's draft has largely been blamed on a supposed attitude problem he displayed during meetings with league teams. His supporters, including President Donald Trump, argued the decorated passer should have been drafted earlier, while detractors think Sanders lacks the talent to overcome his perceived personality issues.\n\nFormer NFL MVP Boomer Esiason has since claimed on his morning radio show that Sanders slipped from a projected first-round pick to No. 144 because teams didn't want an 'entitled person.' Other league insiders reported Sanders intentionally botched interviews with certain teams he didn't want to play with.\n\nBut claims that Sanders 'was too cocky' in pre-draft meetings didn't just hurt the quarterback, costing him roughly $40 million over the life of his first NFL contract. Doe, too, was impacted, as he explained to Daily Mail.\n\nShedeur Sanders was all smiles as he walked into the Browns' rookie mini-camp on Thursday\n\nShedeur Sanders reportedly fell in the draft due to concerns about his professionalism \n\n'Just mounting frustration from the anxiety that I experienced, some of the trauma, the disappointment and frustration that I was feeling when I'd seen that Shedeur didn't get drafted at his projected draft spot,' Doe told Daily Mail.\n\n'Just to realize that a person was feeling that vulnerable and he couldn't fight back and then I was just frustrated to the point where I'm like: ''Well if he's not allowed to fight back, I guess I'll go ahead and file my lawsuit against them because of the trauma that it caused me.'''\n\nAs for the $100 million in damages he's requesting, Doe knows what everyone is thinking.\n\n'I mean, a lot of people look at it as frivolous because they don't understand the cause of action,' he said.\n\nThose causes include the alleged violations of the Sherman Antitrust and Civil Rights acts, as well as intentional infliction of emotional distress. And those requested damages also include the estimated millions Shedeur lost when he fell from the first round, where players sign for anywhere between $14.6 and $48.7 million, to the fifth.\n\nAs the 144th pick, Sanders will earn $4.6 million over four NFL seasons, according to the rookie salary scale.\n\n'Those combined elements will equal up to 100 million,' said Doe, who is representing himself in the lawsuit.\n\nA screen shows Colorado quarterback Shedeur Sanders' name after being selected by the Browns with the 144th overall pick during the fifth round of the 2025 NFL Draft on April 26\n\nFormer NFL MVP Boomer Esiason said Sanders almost went undrafted over his attitude \n\nDoe has no legal experience and was only involved in one unrelated lawsuit in his entire life. He filed this complaint anonymously because, as a small business owner, he's aware that negative publicity could affect his bottom line.\n\n'I knew the impact of this type of lawsuit and what it would have and I just didn't want the commotion associated with it,' he said.\n\nDoe's connection to Sanders is probably obvious to anyone familiar with his Hall-of-Fame father Deion. A Georgia native, Doe was an undeniable fan of the two-sport star playing for the NFL's Atlanta Falcons and Major League Baseball's Atlanta Braves.\n\n'Everybody in my generation was [a fan of Deion's],' Doe said. 'We all had his shoes and were trying to mimic him.'\n\nSo when the elder Sanders began coaching his sons Shedeur and Shilo at Jackson State and then Colorado, Doe couldn't help but follow.\n\n'I even attended their first game against TCU,' Doe said of Colorado's 2023 season opener. 'Pretty much watched every game, so became pretty attached to them.'\n\nThat's why, he told Daily Mail, Doe wants to see Shedeur's reputation repaired. As the Sanders fan is quick to point out, Shedeur was never 'arrested, never charged with any crime.'\n\nAnd while he hesitates to accuse anyone of racism, Doe believes prejudice may have been a factor.\n\n'Everything is not related to racism,' said Doe, who is African American. 'When you lived the black experience, you know what a dog whistle is.'\n\nThose alleged dog whistles include media claims that NFL insiders wanted to teach Sanders a lesson.\n\n'I'm like: who gives you that power?' Doe asked. 'That's not what we're here for you. You're running a professional sports organization and for you to teach someone a lesson that hasn't did anything wrong, I mean to me, you can't avoid that.'\n\nAnd that's why teams owe him a retraction of the 'slanderous statements' and an apology for the 'harm caused to his reputation,' according to his filing in Atlanta federal court.\n\nHead coach Deion Sanders of the Colorado Buffaloes talks with Shedeur Sanders #2 prior to a game against the UCF Knights at FBC Mortgage Stadium\n\nDoe isn't overly confident about his chances at proving any conspiracy, racist or otherwise. He hopes to use the legal theory of disparate impact, asserting that hiring practices can be deemed illegal if they disproportionately harm protected groups, but that's not guaranteed to work.\n\nAs for reaction to his lawsuit, Doe said the folks around Atlanta he's spoken with are split.\n\n'I think it's 50-50,' he said. 'You know you got some people that don't really care. I mean some people feel that he should be taught a lesson. Some people feel that he is smug. Some people feel that he needed to be brought down some. I'm not disparaging those feelings, but no one should be punishing [Shedeur] for not doing everything right.'\n\nAnd while $100 million in damages might be wishful thinking, Doe insists the foundation of his lawsuit is a pursuit of facts.\n\n'I'm hopeful we can get to the discovery phase and find out the truth,' he said.\n\nAn NFL spokesman has not responded to Daily Mail's request for comment. \n\nColoradoGeorgia\n\nShare or comment on this article:\nNFL fan behind $100m Shedeur Sanders lawsuit reveals the shocking conspiracy he wants to uncover\n\nAdd comment","summary":"The 55-year-old Georgia man suing the NFL over Shedeur Sanders' draft-day tumble not only wants $100 million in damages, but the truth behind the news stories that played a roll in the QB's fall.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/nfl/article-14693107/NFL-fan-100m-Shedeur-Sanders-lawsuit-reveals-shocking-conspiracy.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/05/08/19/98189877-0-A_screen_shows_Colorado_quarterback_Shedeur_Sanders_name_after_b-a-41_1746729372856.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-05-08 23:42:26","author":"Alex Raskin,Editor","authors":["Alex Raskin","Editor"],"language":"en","source_country":"jp","sentiment":-0.496},{"id":319342504,"title":"80 years on, France’s last WWII veterans warn peace must be defended","text":"France commemorated the 80th anniversary of the end of the Second World War on Thursday. French President Emmanuel Macron led the national remembrance in the capital, Paris, laying a wreath in front of a crowd at the statue of General Charles de Gaulle, who led the French Resistance against Nazi Germany.But as France remembered the millions who fought and died in the war, it also faced a sobering reality: few remain who have witnessed its horrors first-hand. “Unfortunately, I'm finding that there are fewer and fewer of us,” said 89-year-old Marcjanna Marcinkowski, who was just nine when Paris was liberated from Nazi occupation in 1944. “That’s a real concern, because finding myself alone is something that troubles me a lot,\" she added. Marcinkowski fears the lessons of the war risk being lost in today’s younger generations.“I feel like these lessons are already forgotten. In schools, we've completely stopped talking about World War II and the first World War\", she told Euronews. But as Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine rages on at Europe’s doorstep, the few remaining veterans feel that history is on the brink of repeating itself.“I'm very committed to peace. We must do everything we can to prevent people from killing each other,” said Jean Yaghlekdjian, a 101-year-old World War II veteran. “I'm very attached to this message because I've seen too many people (die) in the most atrocious ways. I’ll fight for peace with all my might,\" he told Euronews. Marcjanna Marcinkowski didn't mince her words: \"I'm very worried about what's going to happen now with this nutty Vladimir Putin and that complete jerk, Donald Trump,\" she said. In his speech, Macron echoed a similar sentiment, warning against complacency in the face of today’s tensions.“We will never be done fighting for victory and defending peace,” said the French President. “We will never be done asserting our country’s place, defending our independence and our freedom. So yes, there will always be France. And with it, Europe, our Europe, and our peace.\"","summary":"The commemoration saw a parade of veterans' associations, and music performed by military bands from France, Germany, Canada, Cameroon, the US and UK.","url":"https://www.euronews.com/my-europe/2025/05/09/80-years-on-frances-last-wwii-veterans-warn-peace-must-be-defended","image":"https://static.euronews.com/articles/stories/09/27/32/94/1440x810_cmsv2_7293a061-108b-5967-b21c-704445050f8a-9273294.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-05-08 23:40:52","author":"Sophia Khatsenkova","authors":["Sophia Khatsenkova"],"language":"en","source_country":"fr","sentiment":-0.135},{"id":319348662,"title":"A Day in the Live-Streamed Life of Donald Trump","text":"In Trump’s case, his second term has demonstrated another thesis—that the President of the United States can spend so much of his day on camera that it is as if he were live-streaming his tenure and not merely obsessively watching it play out on TV. Hardly a day goes by when Trump does not summon the White House press pool—now handpicked by his staff rather than independently chosen by the media itself, as it was for more than a century—for an announcement, a visit with a foreign dignitary, or merely to get a few things off his chest. Sometimes, this happens multiple times in a single day. These Oval Office rambles have largely replaced the more formal press conferences in the East Room which he held during his previous term. And with no more elections to run, Trump has mostly eschewed the big rallies that were the hallmark of his campaigns, preferring to spend time at the White House or at his own private clubs in Florida and New Jersey; one analysis found that, on forty of his first hundred days—and twelve out of fourteen weekends—he spent time at his personal properties.\nWhen he is in the White House, the trademark image of his second term has become Trump at the Resolute desk, with a rotating cast of admiring Cabinet members and other characters behind him, while he talks and talks and talks to the cameras and jostling questioners arrayed in front of him. Trump has not yet reached full dictator mode with these appearances; the late Venezuelan strongman Hugo Chávez used to have a weekly show, “Aló Presidente,” that lasted from 11 A.M. each Sunday until whenever Chávez shut up, which was often four to eight hours later. But, increasingly, they are the signature of Trump’s Presidency.\nOn Thursday, the press pool was summoned at 10:48 A.M. for what Trump had billed as a “very big and exciting” announcement of a new trade deal between the U.S. and the U.K. Reporters arrived to find the President already on speakerphone with the British Prime Minister, Keir Starmer. The deal, it turned out, was somewhat less than advertised—an agreement in principle, after years of talks, and with many details to be finalized. Trump is nowhere near meeting the goal of “ninety deals in ninety days” that his trade adviser promised, after the President’s threat of “reciprocal” tariffs in his April 2nd “Liberation Day” speech shocked the world economy. Still, it was something, and Trump, with all the zeal of a used-car salesman, plumped for the agreement, though he admitted it wasn’t quite done yet. “In the coming weeks, we’ll have it all very conclusive,” he vowed. His Commerce Secretary, Howard Lutnick, praised the boss as “the Closer.” “He gets deals done that we could never get done,” Lutnick said.\nAs Lutnick said this, I thought of Trump holding forth in the Oval Office just two days earlier, during a visit with the new Canadian Prime Minister, Mark Carney, who was elected largely on the basis of his promise to push back against Trump’s threatened trade war. With Carney at his side, Trump had called the trade agreement that he signed with Canada and Mexico during his first term merely a “transitional deal,” billing it as a convenient way to get rid of NAFTA, “the worst trade deal in the history of our country, probably in the history of the world.” Transitional? Back in 2020, when Trump signed the pact, he proclaimed it “the largest, most significant, modern, and balanced trade agreement in history.” Poor Keir Starmer. There are many words that come from Trump’s mouth, and few that he will not renounce when they are no longer convenient.\nAs for words on Thursday, there were a lot of them, many having little to do with Great Britain or global trade. In the course of his on-air comments, Trump talked about knowing the late Sean Connery. (That was sort of Britain-related.) He explained that he invests in golf courses only “if they’re on the ocean.” He complained, once again, about the chairman of the Federal Reserve, Jerome Powell, refusing to lower interest rates, even after Trump very nicely said he was not planning to follow through on his many threats to fire him. “He doesn’t want to do it—probably he’s not in love with me,” Trump posited. Later, and, as far as I could tell, apropos of nothing, he mocked the Senate Democratic leader, Chuck Schumer, saying that Schumer, who is Jewish, is so sympathetic toward Palestinians that he is officially becoming one; maybe, Trump said as someone—I wasn’t quite sure who—laughed raucously, there would be some sort of “ceremony” to welcome him.\nAsked about a disastrous breakdown in the air-traffic-control system at Newark Airport, Trump complained about Pete Buttigieg, the Biden Administration’s Secretary of Transportation, and explained that he would soon be buying a “brand new,” “state of the art,” and “incredible” system to replace the old one. He added that he had personally given his Transportation Secretary, Sean Duffy, a crash course in how to negotiate a good deal. “I’ve given him a ten-minute lesson in buying,” Trump said, “and he’s become really good.”\nNearly an hour into his talking, Trump dropped an unexpected bit of news—that he would drop the nomination of his controversial choice to be U.S. Attorney for the District of Columbia, Ed Martin, after a key Republican on the Judiciary Committee had said that he wouldn’t go along with the choice of Martin, who helped organize the Stop the Steal movement and embraced conspiracy theories about what happened on January 6th. Trump suggested that there just weren’t enough hours for him to defend Martin amid all the other important things he’s doing. “I’m only one person,” he said. “I can only lift that little phone so many times in a day.” At first, it wasn’t entirely clear that he was actually dumping Martin, but then he shook his head and indicated there was no other choice. “That’s the way it works sometimes,” he said.\nBy the time Trump stopped talking, at 11:53 A.M. on Thursday, it had been an hour and five minutes since the press pool had been summoned. But Trump, it turned out, was hardly done. At 12:13 P.M., the pool was called into the East Room, where Trump began another televised event, a rare joint appearance with First Lady Melania Trump, at which he bragged about “tremendous things happening on trade, the likes of which we’ve never seen before,” and, on the eve of Mother’s Day, made some eyebrow-raising observations about his own mother, who was “such an angel” but also “could be very tough,” he said, adding, “she had her tough moments, some difficult moments she had.”\nEven that awkward commentary, however, was not enough to get Trump to stop for the day. After a private meeting with the golfer Tiger Woods, who is now dating his son Don, Jr.,’s ex-wife, he unexpectedly came out on the patio next to the entrance of the West Wing to talk to reporters again. The big story, it turned out, was not his deal with Great Britain but the selection of a new Pope, the Chicago-born cardinal Robert Francis Prevost, who will now be known as Leo XIV. Trump wanted a piece of the news cycle. “To have the Pope from the United States of America,” he said, “that’s a great honor.”\nAnd so a day in the live-streamed life of Donald Trump ended as it began, with confirmation of a lesson learned many times over these past long few years: there is nothing at all for which he cannot claim credit. ♦","summary":"America’s TV-obsessed President has made his rambling Oval Office press gaggles the signature of his second term—chaotic, self-aggrandizing, random, and frequently nasty.","url":"https://www.newyorker.com/news/letter-from-trumps-washington/a-day-in-the-live-streamed-life-of-donald-trump","image":"https://media.newyorker.com/photos/681cfbc144cb7a7637b9259a/16:9/w_2560,h_1440,c_limit/Glasser-250508.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-05-08 23:36:02","author":"Susan B.

She is in a class by herself,” Trump wrote.\n\nThe president had in January appointed Martin as interim US attorney in Washington DC, an office that oversees both felony prosecutions in the capital city as well as many national security cases.\n\nMartin had quickly made clear he intended to use the role to defend Trump, writing on social media that the office would act as “President Trumps’ [sic] lawyers” and saying he would not hire graduates of schools that practiced the diversity policies the president has vilified.\n\nInterim US attorneys must leave the role after 120 days unless they are confirmed by the Senate. Earlier this week, Thom Tillis, a North Carolina Republican who serves on the chamber’s judiciary committee, said he would not advance Martin’s nomination, denying the GOP the votes needed to get his nomination through the committee.\n\nSpeaking at the White House on Thursday, Trump called Martin “a terrific person” but said “he wasn’t getting the support from people that I thought”.\n\nHe added: “He wasn’t rejected, but we felt it would be very, it would be hard. And we have somebody else that we’ll be announcing over the next two days who’s going to be great.”\n\nTillis, who will be a prime target of Democrats in next year’s midterm elections, cited Martin’s support for Trump’s pardon of January 6 insurrectionists on his first day in office.\n\n“I have no tolerance for anybody who entered the building on January the sixth, and that’s probably where most of the friction was,” Tillis told reporters at the Capitol.\n\n“If Mr Martin were being put forth as a US attorney for any district except the district where January 6 happened, the protest happened, I’d probably support him, but not in this district.”\n\nThe top judiciary committee Democrat, Dick Durbin, welcomed Martin’s withdrawal.\n\n“Mr Martin’s record made it clear that he does not have the temperament or judgment to be entrusted with the power and responsibility of being US attorney for the District of Columbia. I’m relieved to see that his nomination will be withdrawn by the White House,” Durbin said in a statement.\n\nEarlier this month, National Public Radio reported on ties between Martin and Timothy Hale-Cusanelli, a January 6 rioter whom federal prosecutors called a “Nazi sympathizer”. Martin had told the Senate “I am not close with him”, despite appearing with Hale-Cusanelli at events and praising him.\n\nMartin is known for being active on X and, shortly after Trump announced the withdrawal of his nomination, posted what appears to be a doctored photo of himself dressed as the pope.\n\nPirro is the latest in a string of Trump appointments to come from Fox News, a list that includes the defense secretary Pete Hegseth, who co-hosted Fox & Friends Weekend.\n\nA 1975 graduate of Albany Law School, Pirro has significantly more courtroom experience than Martin. She led one of the nation’s first domestic violence units in a prosecutor’s office.\n\nShe became a ubiquitous television pundit during OJ Simpson’s murder trial, often appearing on CNN’s Larry King Live. During her time on Fox News, she frequently interviewed Trump.\n\nPirro was also named in a lawsuit brought in 2021 by the voting technology company Smartmatic USA, who sued Fox News, Pirro and others for spreading false claims that the company had helped “steal” the 2020 presidential election from Trump. The company’s libel suit, filed in a New York state court, sought $2.7bn from the defendants.\n\nIn the final minutes of his first term as president, Trump issued a pardon to Pirro’s ex-husband, Albert Pirro, who was convicted in 2000 on conspiracy and tax evasion charges.\n\nThe Associated Press contributed reporting\n\nThis story was amended on 8 May 2025 to correct that Ed Martin was appointed in January, not February.","url":"https://uk.news.yahoo.com/trump-withdraws-embattled-candidate-top-175616583.html","image":"https://media.zenfs.com/en/theguardian_763/4a814005384e2e12cb32ff7823faf676","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-05-08 23:35:18","author":"Chris Stein In Washington And Agencies","authors":["Chris Stein In Washington And Agencies"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.406},{"id":319340246,"title":"Jobs ‘days’ away from being lost without US deal, suggests Reynolds","text":"People were perhaps “days” away from losing their jobs without the new trade deal between the US and the UK, the Trade Secretary has indicated.\n\nJonathan Reynolds told the BBC’s Newsnight programme that “we were at risk of thousands of people losing their jobs” without an agreement.\n\nSir Keir Starmer had earlier hailed the “historic” accord. As part of the agreement, US import taxes which had threatened to cripple British high-end carmakers were cut from 27.5% to 10%, while the 25% tariff on steel has also been removed entirely.\n\nThe blanket 10% tariff imposed on imports by US President Donald Trump as part of his sweeping “liberation day” announcement remains in place, but talks are ongoing in a UK effort to ease it.\n\nMr Reynolds told the BBC that without the “historic breakthrough, we were at risk of thousands of people losing their jobs”.\n\nAsked how quickly that might have happened, he said “we were very, very close”, and pushed further on whether that meant days or weeks, he replied: “Days.”\n\n“This was very, very serious, it means people would have lost their jobs without this breakthrough and it would have been a real economic hit to the UK,” Mr Reynolds later added.\n\nHe had earlier said the US was an important market to firms such as Jaguar Land Rover (JLR), Aston Martin and Bentley and that a 25% tariff was a “very difficult business proposition” in a competitive industry.\n\nThe general terms for the agreement were published late on Thursday, and stated that the UK and the US are “beginning negotiations” to “develop and formalise the proposals” that have been made.\n\nIt also suggested that that either country could “terminate” the “arrangement” in the future with written notice, and it could be further altered in the future at the request of either side.\n\n“On request of either country, the United Kingdom and the United States will consult with a view to considering any changes that may need to be made to this arrangement to ensure that it remains mutually beneficial,” the general terms for the deal say.\n\nSir Keir and Mr Trump confirmed the deal in a conversation that was broadcast live on both sides of the Atlantic on Thursday afternoon.\n\nThe Prime Minister took the call at a JLR plant in the West Midlands, and said it was “important” for him to go back to the factory that he visited in the days after the tariffs were first announced.\n\nThe timing of the announcement came as a surprise, coinciding with VE Day where the Prime Minister was heavily involved in events to mark the 80th anniversary of the end of the Second World War in Europe.\n\nThe Liberal Democrats have been pushing the Government to offer MPs a vote on the deal, but a Treasury minister appeared to suggest on Thursday evening that would not happen.\n\nAsked on the BBC’s Question Time programme whether there would be a vote, Exchequer Secretary to the Treasury James Murray said “it’s my understanding it won’t but I’m not chief whip”.\n\nThe deal is the first the US has announced since Mr Trump’s tariff regime was introduced last month, and speaking to the Prime Minister from the White House, the US president said the agreement was a “great deal for both countries”.\n\nPrevious speculation had suggested the UK would revise the digital services tax as part of a deal, with the levy mainly applying to US tech companies.\n\nBut Number 10 said on Thursday the tax would remain unchanged, with the two countries agreeing to work on a separate digital trade deal that would reduce paperwork for British firms exporting to the US.\n\nThe deal also does not include any concessions on the Online Safety Act or the NHS, the Business Secretary said.\n\nAsked whether that could be ruled out for the future, Mr Reynolds said: “Isn’t this unfortunately how we do things in the UK?\n\n“We’ve got the best result of any other country in the world, we’re immediately speculating that somehow it’s going to be worse in the future.\n\n“We said very clearly the safety of children in the UK is never something we would negotiate with.”\n\nHe added: “We’ve got to stop being so insular in the UK and understand there will be asks from other countries, but we can refuse those and we can negotiate and we can get what we need in the UK to pursue our own interests.”\n\nThe agreement comes after weeks of speculation about what shape a deal could take.\n\nPrevious governments have attempted to secure a free trade agreement with the US, but with no success, however the impact of Mr Trump’s tariffs made it a high priority for Sir Keir.\n\nChancellor Rachel Reeves said she was “proud” of the Prime Minister’s role in getting the agreement over the line.\n\nShe wrote in The Times: “There are those who would have advocated we take a different approach. That we cave into the performative politics, which would have made for a good soundbite, but would have harmed our economy, threatened business, and put working people out of work.”\n\nOther measures in the deal include a provision that beef exports will be allowed both ways, with officials insisting there will be no weakening of food standards for meat sent to Britain.\n\nMr Trump posted on Truth Social on Thursday evening to say that the deal is “GREAT for our FARMERS and RANCHERS”.\n\nThe UK will also have “preferential treatment whatever happens in the future” when it comes to pharmaceuticals, as Mr Trump considers import taxes on drugs and medicines.\n\nConservative leader Kemi Badenoch said the UK had been “shafted” by the agreement, and one of her MPs suggested Mr Trump looks to “extort” from people.\n\nGraham Stuart told Question Time he does not think it is a “great deal”.\n\nHe said: “The truth is that’s what he does, that he seeks to shaft people. That’s his business career, isn’t it?”\n\n“It’s what he’s done, Donald Trump,” Mr Stuart added.\n\n“He seeks to extort from people, and that’s what he’s done.
