United travelled to New Jersey from Chicago to take on the Hammers at the same venue where Chelsea hoisted the Club World Cup alongside Donald Trump not two weeks ago. And it was their captain they relied upon once again with Bruno Fernandes scoring both. The first came from the spot after a messy Alphonse Areola catch led to Ayden Heaven being fouled. The second came just after the interval after another mistake from the Hammers keeper. Kobbie Mainoo capitalized to tee up Fernandes who produced a sublime finish. Jarrod Bowed grabbed one back on the hour mark and had another late chance stopped by Altay Bayinder as United grabbed a rare but much-needed win. The starting XI: Altay Bayindir, Leny Yoro, Matthijs de Ligt, Ayden Heaven, Amad, Kobbie Mainoo, Manuel Ugarte, Patrick Dorgu, Bruno Fernandes, Matheus Cunha, Rasmus Hojlund. And it stayed that way until the 65th minute. The fact this team lasted more than an hour shows you where Amorim's head is with his preferred players. Add to the context Bryan Mbeumo wasn't quite ready, Noussair Mazraoui was carrying a knock, and Joshua Zirkzee wasn't in the squad, it's clear the United boss is using pre-season to get his strongest side playing their strongest football as soon as possible. It's a luxury he didn't get last year. United looked sharp, carried a zip and an energy to their play that hasn't been seen for some time. Most pleasing for Amorim will no doubt be the positivity. There's a long way to go but the pressing was also improved. The defence helped the midfield and the midfield helped the attack. A marked improvement. The need for additions is still obvious but perhaps fans may get to see a little more of what Amorim wants to do. Depending on where Amorim sees Mazraoui and Shaw, United's back three of Yoro, De Ligt, and Heaven, is about as strong as it comes. It may well be the back three that starts against Arsenal in three weeks' time. De Ligt played in the anchor role at the back, mopping up scraggly chances and loose balls. And beside the Dutchman he had Yoro on the right and Heaven on the left. While not perfect, the performance of the three was solid. If a little untidy at times, it did its job in the main. The worry for Amorim should be that this was against a pretty lifeless West Ham attack. The prospect of those three facing against Viktor Gyokeres, Bukayo Saka and Gabriel Martinelli will come as a lilttle unnerving. While still raw the talent in Yoro is clear. He needs more time. Heaven is even younger and Bowen's goal is a prime example that he has much to learn in anticipation and shutting down attackers. Does the back three have potential? Yes. Is it a top four defence? No. Far from it. It's worth remembering that Hojlund is only 22 years of age. And despite his form last season there's never a United side that should have relied upon him as their out-and-out goalscorer. That notwithstanding, it was him or Joshua Zirkzee. Zirkzee is not a striker, he's a false nine or a 10 who, at times, had United fans licking their lips with his quick feet and link-up play. So that leaves Hojlund. After a mere three minutes he showed his three best attributes - speed, strength and mentality. After Cunha won the ball on the edge of the box, Hojlund found himself on the break one v one with West Ham defender Max Kilman. Hojlund outmuscled him, sprinted past him and found himself with an opportunity on goal. That's where his weakest attribute came in - finishing. The shot was fierce and smashed off the left upright. It was a good chance he carved out for himself but he couldn't apply the finishing touch. Only moments later he found himself with the ball at his feet in the penalty area. The result was a ballooned shot over the bar. It's always a snatched shot or a power strike rather than a caressed finish for Hojlund. There's no doubting his attitude to chase every ball down but that's not enough. At times last season the Dane was left frustrated by Alejandro Garnacho's selfishness. But with Bryan Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha he can expect a lot more service this time around. However, Amorim will need decide quick if the goals come from his two new signings via Zirkzee or from a hit or miss Hojlund. Amorim has never quite figured out where he wants to play Fernandes. In part, that's due to him being so good the United boss probably wishes he could play him in five positions. But Amorim did make a mistake in the Europa League final dropping Fernandes deep. Manuel Ugarte and Casemiro had established a semi-solid partnership through the previous European games. The captain replacing Ugarte left not only a hole in attack but created an inability to stop Spurs running through the midfield. Casemiro's age and Ugarte's legs have left a lot to be desired and it is why United are crying out for a defensive midfielder. It is therefore interesting that Fernandes started in one of the No. 10 positions against West Ham. He was instrumental in several transitions of attack, linking up with Cunha a little better than he did with Hojlund. His cross ultimately led to Alphonse Areola's blunder which the penalty came from and it was of course he who slotted neatly from the penalty spot. Like usual, he had no problem bossing his teammates about but it felt a little more commanding coming from an attacking position. And because he was further forward he was also in a position to delicately curl one past Areola for United's second. And because Fernandes was further forward it meant Kobbie Mainoo partnered Ugarte in midfield. While at times the common vulnerability of teams running through their pair did show, like when Tomas Soucek had too much room to slot in Bowen, there was plenty of promise. Prior to kick-off Amorim declared that he has \"Big plans\" for Mainoo while lauding his talent. And it was on this very pitch two years ago that Mainoo's performance against Arsenal in pre-season caught the eye. It's fitting that he once again purred on the ball. His silky footwork and confidence on the ball drew \"Oohs\" and \"Aahs\" from the crowd. But perhaps what Amorim will be most pleased with was his doggedness to win the ball. Mainoo raced onto Areola's poor goalkick to intercept the ball in the second half. He quickly fed it to Fernandes who produced a sumptuous finish. His partner, Ugarte, flattered to deceive last season but did show a side to his play not many have seen. The Uruguayan quickly won the ball back after Mainoo ran into a Claret wall. He proceeded to nutmeg one player before feeding through Amad who neatly slotted away his chance. Unfortunately for the pair it was offside. It's not rock solid, as Bowen's goal showed, but it was better than last season.","summary":"Manchester United kicked off their preseason adventure in the United States with a win over West Ham to give Ruben Amorim some signs of encouragement ahead of the season","url":"https://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/news/man-utd-finally-give-ruben-35625002","image":"https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/article35625122.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200b/0_GettyImages-2227167475.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-07-27 00:58:27","author":"Thomas Bristow","authors":["Thomas Bristow"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":0.057},{"id":345574152,"title":"Trump posts meme of himself and JD Vance chasing Obama in OJ’s white Bronco","text":"Donald Trump’s latest meme post sees him and JD Vance chasing former president Barack Obama, who is driving a white Ford Bronco, down a Los Angeles freeway in police cars.\n\nThe image is a recreation of a famous shot of OJ Simpson’s evasion of police in 1994.

She held a cardboard sign that said \"We don't negotiate with fascists.\" She said \"so many people here loathe him. We're not divided. We're not divided by religion, or race or political allegiance, we're just here together because we hate him.\"Other demonstrators held signs of pictures with Mr. Trump and Jeffrey Epstein as the fervor over files in the case has increasingly frustrated the president.In the view of Mark Gorman, 63, of Edinburgh, \"the vast majority of Scots have this sort of feeling about Trump that, even though he has Scottish roots, he's a disgrace.\" Gorman, who works in advertising, said he came out \"because I have deep disdain for Donald Trump and everything that he stands for.\"Saturday's protests were not nearly as large as the throngs that demonstrated across Scotland when Mr. Trump played at Turnberry during his first term in 2018.But, as bagpipes played, people chanted \"Trump Out!\" and raised dozens of homemade signs that said things like \"No red carpet for dictators,\" \"We don't want you here\" and \"Stop Trump. Migrants welcome.\"One dog had a sign that said \"No treats for tyrants.\"Some on the far right took to social media to call for gatherings supporting Mr. Trump in places such as Glasgow.Mr. Trump also plans to talk trade with Starmer and Ursula von der Leyen, the European Commission president. But golf is a major focus.The family will also visit another Trump course near Aberdeen in northeastern Scotland, before returning to Washington on Tuesday. The Trumps will cut the ribbon and play a new, second course in that area, which officially opens to the public next month.Scottish First Minister John Swinney, who is also set to meet with Mr. Trump during the visit, announced that public money will go to staging the 2025 Nexo Championship, previously known previously as the Scottish Championship, at Mr. Trump's first course near Aberdeen next month.\"The Scottish Government recognizes the importance and benefits of golf and golf events, including boosting tourism and our economy,\" Swinney said.At a protest Saturday in Aberdeen, Scottish Parliament member Maggie Chapman told the crowd of hundreds: \"We stand in solidarity, not only against Trump but against everything he and his politics stand for.\"The president has long lobbied for Turnberry to host the British Open, which it has not done since he took over ownership.In a social media post Saturday, Mr. Trump quoted the retired golfer Gary Player as saying Turnberry was among the \"Top Five Greatest Golf Courses\" he had played in as a professional. The president, in the post, misspelled the city where his golf course is located.","summary":"Hundreds of demonstrators gathered on the cobblestone and tree-lined street in front of the U.S. Consulate in Edinburgh, Scotland's capital.","url":"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-plays-golf-scotland-nationwide-protests/","image":"https://assets3.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2025/07/27/569264d5-08eb-4e1f-b9a3-f2853cb86de3/thumbnail/1200x630/62c309c081537266f387b5ccea1bdd6c/ap25207339459665.jpg","video":"https://prod.vodvideo.cbsnews.com/cbsnews/vr/hls/3929630_hls/master.m3u8","publish_date":"2025-07-27 00:10:44","author":null},{"id":345575450,"title":"Albanese says Israel 'quite clearly' breaching international law","text":"Anthony Albanese says Israel is \"quite clearly\" breaching international law by withholding aid from civilians in Gaza, but that the government will not recognise a Palestinian state \"imminently\". \n\nThe prime minister told the ABC's Insiders images of suffering in Gaza were \"completely indefensible\".\n\n\"We have rules of engagement and they are there for a reason.

More during the inaugural parade inside Capital One Arena, in Washington, DC, on January 20, 2025. (Photo by Jim WATSON / AFP) (Photo by JIM WATSON/AFP via Getty Images)\nAFP via Getty Images\n\nOn July 23, the International Court of Justice released its Advisory Opinion relating to the Obligations of States in respect of Climate Change. The Court found that developed countries, like the United States, must take action to reduce GHG emissions to meet the goals of the Paris Agreement. Those countries could also be required to pay reparations to developing countries that are “adversely impacted” by the effects of climate change. The opinion, while non-binding, gives teeth to the Paris Agreement and reinforces many concerns expressed by President Trump.\n\nThe Paris Agreement is an international treaty adopted in 2015 to address the impacts of climate change. The agreement sets a goal of reaching net-zero GHG emissions by 2050. To reach that goal, a series of policies were adopted to address how governments and businesses reduce and report GHG emissions. It also focused on funding of both climate change initiatives and the economic impacts of climate change.\n\nIn 2019, President Trump withdrew the U.S. from the treaty, only for President Joe Biden to rejoin in 2021. On January 20, 2025, Trump signed an executive order to withdraw the U.S. from the agreement for a second time.\n\nThe justifications can be found in a June 2017 statement by Trump.\n\n“There are serious legal and constitutional issues as well. Foreign leaders in Europe, Asia, and across the world should not have more to say with respect to the U.S. economy than our own citizens and their elected representatives. Thus, our withdrawal from the agreement represents a reassertion of America’s sovereignty…\n\nMORE FOR YOU\n\n“The risks grow as historically these agreements only tend to become more and more ambitious over time. In other words, the Paris framework is a starting point — as bad as it is — not an end point. And exiting the agreement protects the United States from future intrusions on the United States’ sovereignty and massive future legal liability. Believe me, we have massive legal liability if we stay in.”\n\nThat legal liability has become a reality.\n\nIn March 2023, at the request of Vanuatu, the UN General Assembly asked the ICJ to issue an advisory opinion on the legal obligations of countries in preventing climate change. The opinion gives an indicator of how the Court may interpret future climate related litigation and guide future legislative development. Following two years of proceedings, including both written and oral statements, the Court issued its opinion, and a shorter summary of the opinion, on July 23.\n\nThe opinion started with the obligations in the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, the Kyoto Protocol, and the Paris Agreement. During the proceedings, a divide was formed between large, developed countries and developing countries.\n\nOne particular legal debate related to the obligations states have under the Paris Agreement. Article 4, paragraph 2 of the Agreement requires countries to “prepare, communicate and maintain successive nationally determined contributions that it intends to achieve. Parties shall pursue domestic mitigation measures, with the aim of achieving the objectives of such contributions.”\n\nThese NDCs outline actions taken by the the countries to reduce GHG emission. Throughout the Court’s proceedings, this process was been referred to as procedural, meaning that countries are only required to go through the process of creating the report. Notably, this argument was made by attorneys representing the Biden Administration.\n\nThe debate arises over whether there is a substantive, or actual action, required to enact the goals of the NDC. A substantive requirement creates a legal liability to act and could lead to legal consequences for failure to act.\n\nTo justify the substantive argument, advocates point to Article 4, paragraph 3 that states successive NDCs “will represent a progression beyond the Party’s then current nationally determined contribution and reflect its highest possible ambition, reflecting its common but differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities, in the light of different national circumstances.”\n\nDeveloping countries also argued that the goal of net zero GHG emissions by 2050, and the goal to limit global warming to 1.5 C are aspirational and not legally binding. However, the Court disagreed.\n\nThe Court determined that NDCs, steps to reduce GHG emissions, and the 1.5 C target are not aspirational, rather countries have a legal obligation to meet those goals. Further, the Court said failure to act could bring legal liability.\n\nAccording to the Court, if developed countries fail to take action to mitigate the impacts of climate change, developing states that are “adversely impacted” by climate change can take legal action. If successful, high GHG emitting countries will have a “duty to make reparation.” Reparation can come in the form of restitution, like “reconstructing damaged or destroyed infrastructure, and restoring ecosystems and biodiversity\", or compensation.\n\nWhile the ICJ’s Advisory Opinion relating to the Obligations of States in respect of Climate Change was non-binding, it will be used as a strong legal argument in future cases. Expect a wave of litigation relating to climate change. It will not take long for developing countries to file complaints before the ICJ seeking damages from the United States, China, Australia, and the European Union. Activists will also use the opinion in national courts to challenge both the actions of governments and of companies.\n\nEditorial StandardsReprints & Permissions","summary":"The ICJ issued an opinion on climate change that stated the obligations of the Paris Agreement come with legal liability.

The findings reflect a party increasingly seen as out of step with voters, with Republicans now preferred on nearly every major issue.\n\nThe poll indicates that voters trust Republicans over Democrats to handle nearly every key issue, including inflation, tariffs, foreign policy, and most significantly immigration, where Republicans hold a staggering 24-point advantage.\n\nEven among voters who disapprove of Trump’s approach to certain policies, the GOP is still favored to lead. For example, voters disapprove of Trump’s handling of inflation by 11 points, yet trust Republicans over Democrats on inflation by 10. The pattern repeats across multiple issues, with voters essentially signaling: We may not love Trump, but we trust his party to govern.\n\n“The Democrat brand is so bad that they don’t have the credibility to be a critic of Trump or the Republican Party,” said Democrat pollster John Anzalone, who co-conducted the survey. “Until they reconnect with real voters and working people on who they’re for and what their economic message is, they’re going to have problems.”\n\nThe problems appear to be compounding. The Democrat Party’s grip on voter identity is slipping. While Democrats once enjoyed a six-point registration edge in 2017, Republicans now lead by one point. This marks a rare and significant realignment in the electorate. Republicans built their first durable lead in party identification last year and have maintained that lead today, the Journal poll found.\n\nDemocrats still hope to replicate the backlash energy that gave them control of the House in 2018. They are planning town-hall meetings across the country, including in Republican-held districts, to make the case against Trump’s agenda. Meanwhile, the Republican National Committee ended the first half of 2025 with more than $80 million on hand, compared with $15 million held by the Democrats’ national campaign arm.\n\nThe only issues where voters preferred congressional Democrats over Republicans were healthcare and vaccine policy. On all other issues tested in the Journal poll, voters expressed more confidence in Republicans.\n\nAs OpenAI CEO Sam Altman recently noted in a viral X post, the modern Democrat Party has “lost the plot,” turning away from capitalism, innovation, and the engines of American progress. “I care much more about being American than any political party,” Altman wrote, expressing dismay at what he sees as the party’s growing hostility toward growth and individual achievement.\n\nSeparately, prominent Democrats like Barack Obama and Beto O’Rourke have urged their party to toughen up. Obama mocked what he called the “fetal position” mentality, while O’Rourke warned that “Democrats in the past too often have been more concerned with being right than being in power.” “We have to be absolutely ruthless about getting back in power,” O’Rourke added. Despite repeated post-election strategy sessions, Democrats continue to lose ground with Hispanic men and working-class voters, according to recent polling from the Hill.","summary":"​​The Democrat Party’s image has fallen to its lowest level since 1990, according to a new Wall Street Journal poll, as voters favor Republicans on nearly all major issues,even while expressing disapproval of Donald Trump’s approach to key policies such as inflation, tariffs, and foreign policy.\n\n\nThe post Poll: Democrat Favorability Hits 35-Year Low as GOP Gains Trust on Key Issues appeared first on Breitbart.","url":"https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2025/07/26/poll-democrat-favorability-hits-35-year-low-as-gop-gains-trust-on-key-issues/","image":"https://media.breitbart.com/media/2025/07/Democrat-640x335.jpeg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-07-26 23:44:04","author":"Jasmyn Jordan","authors":["Jasmyn Jordan"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.334},{"id":345570898,"title":"Kiev’s abandonment of territorial claims to lead to success in talks — expert","text":"MOSCOW, July 27. /TASS/.

Email tips@dailymail.com \nBy RUTH FRANCIS FOR MAILONLINE \n Published:22:51 BST, 26 July 2025 |Updated:00:29 BST, 27 July 2025 \n\nGail Porter has opened up about her incredible transformation after years of heartbreak, homelessness, and health struggles, saying she's finally '100% happy.'\nThe TV star, 54, lost her home, career, and confidence after a long battle with mental health issues, alopecia, and bankruptcy. \nNow, she says she's found peace – and even fallen in love again.\nThe former Big Breakfast host became a household name in the 90s, but by 2011, her life had spiralled out of control. \nGail, then 40, was sectioned under the Mental Health Act and placed in a psychiatric unit, where she shared a ward with violent patients and others in extreme distress.\nTalking to The Mirror, she recalled: 'It was terrifying. I was drugged up to my eyeballs, sharing a ward with men convinced they were Jesus, and violent patients. It felt like One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest.' \n\nThe TV star, 54, lost her home, career, and confidence after a long battle with mental health issues, alopecia, and bankruptcy\nJust three years later, she was sleeping rough on a bench in Hampstead Heath after sofa-surfing failed to offer stability. \nDespite applying for work in charity shops and libraries, she was repeatedly turned away and admitted: 'I just wanted someone to give me a chance'.\nAt her lowest point, concerned loved ones contacted police, who took her to hospital for help. It marked the beginning of a slow but determined journey back from the brink.\nHer fall from fame had begun in 2005 when she lost her hair due to alopecia. She famously refused to wear wigs, saying she wanted to stay authentic – but job offers dried up, and she found herself invited to unpaid appearances purely to talk about her condition.\nGail also battled anorexia and depression, and eventually filed for bankruptcy in 2017. \nShe said: 'I lost everything - my house, my career, my confidence.'\nSince then, she's rebuilt her life with the help of charity work, exercise, and a renewed sense of purpose. \nShe even picked up a BAFTA for her 2020 documentary Being Gail Porter.\n\nThe former Big Breakfast host became a household name in the 90s, but by 2011, her life had spiralled out of control\n\nGail, then 40, was sectioned under the Mental Health Act and placed in a psychiatric unit, where she shared a ward with violent patients and others in extreme distress (pictured in 2005)\n\nHer fall from fame had begun in 2005 when she lost her hair due to alopecia and she famously refused to wear wigs, saying she wanted to stay authentic (pictured in July 2025)\n\nSince then, she's rebuilt her life with the help of charity work, exercise, and a renewed sense of purpose and after nearly 20 years without one, has 'fallen in love' with a wig she helped create\n\n Gail Porter and Muse front man Matt Bellamy attend Primrose Hill dog show in north London \nThese days, she's focused on supporting others through organisations like the Samaritans and Prince William's Homewards campaign, which aims to tackle homelessness across the UK.\nWhile she’s ruled out romance in the traditional sense, saying that she 'doesn't date', 'can’t be bothered' and 'was married once which was enough', Gail has found a new kind of love in an unexpected place: a wig. \nAfter nearly 20 years without one, she worked with Amber Jean Rowan's ethical wig company to create 'The Gail' – a custom piece that resembles her original hair which she has 'fallen in love with'. \nShe insisted: 'It’s not about covering anything up - it’s self‑expression. I now have the freedom to change my look whenever I fancy. I have the best of both worlds.'\n\nShe insisted that it wasn't about covering up, but more about sel-expression and now she has the best of both worlds \n\nSingleton Gail says that she 'doesn't date' and 'can’t be bothered' (pictured with ex husband Toploader's Dan Hipgrave who she shares a daughter, Honey, 22 with)\n\nBefore that she dated the late Keith Flint from dance band Prodigy \nGail, who is single and doesn't use dating apps, said she's happy spending time with friends, her cat, and her daughter Honey, now 22. \nAnd after years of turmoil, she says the future finally feels hopeful.\n'I've been at rock bottom – from sleeping on a bench to standing on a cruise stage,' she added. 'It's proof we get through.'\nGail PorterPrince William\n\nShare or comment on this article: \nGail Porter reveals how she rebuilt her life after losing 'everything' - and says she is 'finally happy and in love'\n\nAdd comment\n\nComments 14\n\n Share what you think\n\nWorst rated\n\nThe comments below have not been moderated.\n\nThe views expressed in the contents above are those of our users and do not necessarily reflect the views of MailOnline.\n\nAdd your comment\n\nEnter your comment\n\nBy posting your comment you agree to our house rules.\n\nSubmit Comment\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual.\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual\n\nWe will automatically post your comment and a link to the news story to your Facebook timeline at the same time it is posted on MailOnline.

Email tips@dailymail.com \nBy NIOMI HARRIS FOR MAILONLINE \n Published:00:18 BST, 27 July 2025 |Updated:00:23 BST, 27 July 2025 \n\nGregg Wallace has insisted that he done with TV and the BBC before making a sensational claim that HE was 'groped' during his time on MasterChef as he speaks out following his sacking from the show.\nThe TV personality, 60, was recently dismissed from the BBC show after more than 40 complaints against him were upheld following a BBC investigation. \nAnd in a new interview, Gregg has told how he himself faced sexual harassment from a host of women 'on a regular basis' as he hit out at the broadcaster over their 'complaints procedure'.\nSpeaking to The Sun, Gregg said: 'The whole complaints procedure needs to be readdressed - there are huge problems with it as things stand. Being on MasterChef was brilliant but I had so many bad experiences on that show too.\n'Had I wanted to raise any complaints, I’d have had the decency to speak to that person directly. Privately, not publicly. My God, can you imagine the complaints I could have made? Have you got any idea of the sexual references made to me on a daily basis?\n'How many times I’ve been touched by women wanting a selfie? How many times I’ve been groped? How many times suggestive comments have been made to me? How many female contestants have said inappropriate things on MasterChef?'\n\nGregg Wallace has insisted that he done with TV and the BBC before making a sensational claim that HE was 'groped' during his time on MasterChef as he speaks out following his sacking from the show\n\nThe TV personality, 60, was recently dismissed from the BBC show after more than 40 complaints against him were upheld following a BBC investigation [pictured with ex co-host Joh Torode]\nGregg added that the thought of complaining wouldn't even 'cross my mind', noting that he wasn't suggesting that groping was 'right', but it was 'happening to me on a regular basis.'\nThe disgraced TV star went on to that he was often 'shouted at and bullied', claiming contestants had a perceived notion that presenters were 'god-like' and adding that he doesn't wish for anyone to be 'dragged through' what he has. \nMailOnline have contacted BBC representatives for comment. \nMeanwhile, Gregg, who has been reported to have been banned from working at the BBC, told how he washed his hands of both the TV industry and the BBC having been 'hurt' by recent events.\nHe noted he didn't want 'anything to do with' telly or the broadcaster, before acknowledging that his TV career is now over. \nWhen asked if he will watch the upcoming series of MasterChef, he replied with a defiant 'No, no, no, no', stating that he's 'pleased' for the contestants on the show as it was never really about former co-star John Torode and himself.\nHe added that he 'didn't care' who hosted the show next, insisting that MasterChef would be 'absolutely fine' without himself and John at the helm. \nAustralian-born chef John, 59, recently lost his job on the BBC show after two decades over allegations that he used the N-word, which he claims to have 'absolutely no recollection' of.\n\nIn a new interview, Gregg has told how he himself faced sexual harassment from a host of women 'on a regular basis' as he hit out at the broadcaster over their 'complaints procedure'\n\n'Had I wanted to raise any complaints, I’d have had the decency to speak to that person directly. Privately, not publicly. My God, can you imagine the complaints I could have made? Have you got any idea of the sexual references made to me on a daily basis?'\n\n'How many times I’ve been touched by women wanting a selfie? How many times I’ve been groped? How many times suggestive comments have been made to me?'\n\n Gregg Wallace says 'I am not a flasher' and says he is horrified to be compared to Jimmy Savile \nGregg's comments come after it was revealed that the BBC would air its amateur 2025 series of MasterChef. \nIn the nine months since the hit BBC programme finished filming last Autumn there have been questions over whether it would ever be broadcast following allegations of inappropriate behaviour against presenters Wallace and Torode.\nNow the corporation has revealed that the amateur series of MasterChef filmed last year, before allegations against Gregg and John were upheld, will be broadcast on BBC One and BBC iPlayer from August 6. \nThe MailOnline understand that the BBC have told the MasterChef production company Banijay that the show should reduce Gregg and John's screen time to a minimum in light of the report's findings. \nA source said: 'The BBC have made it clear that it should limit the amount of airtime the presenters have in the editing of the new series, with a bigger focus on the contestants who are at the heart of the competition.' \n'Neither Gregg nor John will appear in BBC iPlayer thumbnails and they will not be doing any promotional activity around the latest series.'\n'All of the brilliant new contestants were consulted on whether the series should be broadcast, and no one objected.' \n'Everyone involved is very keen to promote the hard work of the contestants and that will be our priority.' \n\nMeanwhile, Gregg, who has been reported to have been banned from working at the BBC, told how he washed his hands of both the TV industry and the BBC having been 'hurt' by recent events\n\nGregg (right) stepped down from the hit BBC cooking show after complaints were made about his behaviour. His co-host John (left) was also the subject of an allegation about using racist language and was also sacked from the show \n\n 'I'm not a groper!': Gregg Wallace claims he is 'sorry' to the 41 people he hurt following BBC axing \nThe BBC said it had taken the decision to broadcast the unaired series 'after careful consideration and consultation with the contestants'.\nIn a statement, the corporation said: 'MasterChef is an amazing competition which is life-changing for the amateur chefs taking part. The focus of it has always been their skill and their journey.'\nThe BBC also said it had not yet taken a decision on the completed celebrity series and Christmas special, filmed with Torode and food critic Grace Dent.\nIn its statement, the BBC said: 'This has not been an easy decision in the circumstances and we appreciate not everyone will agree with it.\n'In showing the series, which was filmed last year, it in no way diminishes our view of the seriousness of the upheld findings against both presenters. We have been very clear on the standards of behaviour that we expect of those who work at the BBC or on shows made for the BBC.\n'However, we believe that broadcasting this series is the right thing to do for these cooks who have given so much to the process. We want them to be properly recognised and give the audience the choice to watch the series.'\nThe BBC concluded its statement by describing MasterChef as 'a brilliant, much-loved programme which is bigger than any one individual'.\n'There are many talented, dedicated and hard-working people who make the show what it is. It will continue to flourish on the BBC and we look forward to it returning stronger than ever in the future.'\n\nThe corporation has revealed that the amateur series of MasterChef filmed last year, before allegations against Gregg and John were upheld, will be broadcast on BBC One and BBC iPlayer from August 6\n\nThe MailOnline understand that the BBC have told the MasterChef production company Banijay that the show should reduce Gregg and John's screen time to a minimum in light of the report's findings\n\nThe BBC said it had taken the decision to broadcast the unaired series 'after careful consideration and consultation with the contestants'\nBut some people are not happy with the decision, including former workers on the show. \nWhile former contestants on the show previously said that being on MasterChef can be 'life-changing' for them.\nSome of the women who came forward with claims against Gregg have said they didn't think it should be shown.\nOne former MasterChef worker told BBC News it would show 'a real lack of respect' to people like her if the series was aired, while another warned it would 'make a mockery' of the people who have spoken out.\nGregg Wallace\n\nShare or comment on this article: \nGregg Wallace insists he is done with TV and the BBC and claims HE was 'groped' while working on MasterChef\n\nAdd comment\n\nComments 10\n\n Share what you think\n\nWorst rated\n\nThe comments below have not been moderated.\n\nThe views expressed in the contents above are those of our users and do not necessarily reflect the views of MailOnline.\n\nAdd your comment\n\nEnter your comment\n\nBy posting your comment you agree to our house rules.\n\nSubmit Comment\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual.\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual\n\nWe will automatically post your comment and a link to the news story to your Facebook timeline at the same time it is posted on MailOnline.

Ms DeGeneres said last week that Trump's victory influenced her move to the UK.\n'We got here the day before the election and woke up to lots of texts from our friends with crying emojis and I was like, 'He got in',' she said. 'And we're like, 'We're staying here then'.'\nLast week it was revealed she is selling one of her two Cotswolds properties for a cool £22.5million – £7.5million more than she paid for it.

Violet wrote in her defence. \nSo is the customer always right? \n\nShe was once branded Lady Violet 'no' Manners after neighbours complained about her wild parties\n\nMeg makes up\nDoes Meg Mathews fear what's about to be revealed in a forthcoming memoir by PR supremo Fran Cutler? \nI only ask because Meg, the former wife of Noel Gallagher, has called a truce with Fran, who was the heart of the Primrose Hill Set in the 1990s along with Kate Moss, Jude Law and Sadie Frost.\nFran and supermodel Kate fell out, and Meg seemingly sided with Kate. Now Meg has shared a photo with Fran with the message: 'Time truly is a healer, bringing us together to cherish moments past and present.'\n\nMeg has shared a photo with Fran with the message: 'Time truly is a healer, bringing us together to cherish moments past and present'\n\nStone Roses bassist Gary 'Mani' Mounfield took matters into his own hands when his sons received a slew of nasty comments after being photographed backstage with Noel and Liam Gallagher on the Oasis tour. \n'My rich daddy got me tickets to a band I've never heard of,' one online troll said. \nIt prompted Mani to set the record straight, replying: 'Noel and Liam know my two boys very well...

And believe me, the best is yet to come. You ain’t seen nothing yet.”\n\nWhile the centenarian spent his birthday brunch mambo dancing with his 97-year-old sweetheart, Jeanne, and being serenaded by his a cappella-singing granddaughter, he is already looking ahead to how he’ll make the most of his milestone year.\n\nSome of those bucket list items include a 10-day transatlantic trip, where the “ballet buff” plans to take in the opera in Milan, catch a ballet in Paris, and head to the United Kingdom to hear the London Philharmonic.\n\nThe lively senior then intends to mark his 103rd birthday with a bar mitzvah ceremony at the Pentagon in Washington, DC, next summer – a major achievement he was denied as a child.\n\n“My mother is from Poland and my father is from Russia,” he said.\n\n“My mother was religious. My father was anti-religion, and they had two sons and they agreed that my older brother would be bar mitzvahed and then I would not, [to] pacify my father.”\n\nNext year’s momentous occasion took shape after Terens was speaking on a panel with CNN’s Wolf Blitzer and a Pentagon rabbi overheard him mention his lifelong wish to have a bar mitzvah.\n\n“That is definitely on my bucket list and that is truly going to happen,” he joyfully said, noting that 80 of his closest friends and family members have already been added to the guest list.\n\n“It will be a sensational event. My entire family will be there along with friends. They’ll all come. No one will miss that event.”\n\nTerens enlisted in 1942 and was sent to Great Britain the following year, serving as a radio repair technician for a four-pilot P-47 Thunderbolt fighter squadron. All his original pilots died in the war. \n\nOn D-Day — where more than 150,000 Allied troops invaded five Nazi Germany-occluded beaches in Normandy on June 6, 1944 — he aided in repairing planes coming back from France, with half his company’s pilots perishing that day. \n\nHe has since returned to the fateful spot several times, including in 2024 when he was honored by the French for his service, to mark pivotal anniversaries and to wed his new love. \n\n“It’s very emotional every time I go,” said Terens, who plans to return for the 82nd anniversary.\n\n“I have friends there that I long to see and that gives me a great deal of pleasure. But going with the veterans is very, very special. I’ve had some very memorable moments in Normandy.”\n\nTerens, who has met five US presidents, including George Bush Sr., Bill Clinton, Barack Obama, Joe Biden and Donald Trump, said the secret to his longevity and drive is simple: minimize stress. \n\nBut reflecting on his long life, the Lake Worth resident considers himself the luckiest man alive. \n\n“I think I’m the richest guy in the world and I don’t have any money in the bank,” Terens boasted.\n\n“I wouldn’t trade my life with anyone in the world no matter who it was. I am happy just who I am and with what I have. I think I have more than anyone else in the world. I am the luckiest guy that God ever created. When I say the best is yet to come, I don’t know what it is but it’s there. I promise you.”","summary":"\"I am the luckiest guy that God ever created.

Commission president","text":"Donald Trump will meet the president of the European Commission as work gets under way on a five-day visit to Scotland.\n\nThe US President flew into the country on Friday night and was then seen playing golf at his Trump Turnberry resort the following day.\n\nHowever, on Sunday he will meet European Commission Ursula von der Leyen for talks on the trading relationship between Europe and the US.\n\nThe talks come ahead of discussions with Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer on Monday, which are also expected to focus on the issue of trade.\n\nThe UK and the US struck a trade deal recently, with discussions between the two men expected to focus on this – with reports suggesting Sir Keir will be looking for the US to cut the tariffs for British steel.\n\nThe start of discussions show the US President getting down to business on what is a private, five-day visit to Scotland.\n\nOn Saturday he was spotted playing a round at the famous Turnberry course, which he purchased back in 2014.\n\nA massive security operation was in place as the President played golf on the course.\n\nHe drove his own golf buggy, but a heavy security presence saw Mr Trump flanked by a fleet of similar vehicles.\n\nEven before he took to the course, police officers and military personnel could be seen searching the area around the Trump Turnberry resort – which has had a metal fence erected around it as part of heightened security measures.\n\nNo protesters were seen while he was golfing on Saturday – but hundreds of people gathered in both Edinburgh and Aberdeen for demonstrations against his visit organised by the Stop Trump Coalition.\n\nAfter spending some time at his South Ayrshire resort, the President will head to Aberdeenshire, where he is expected to open a second course at his Trump International golf resort in Balmedie.\n\nDuring his time in the north-east, Mr Trump is also due to meet Scottish First Minister John Swinney.\n\nSpeaking ahead of the talks, Mr Swinney said it was his responsibility to “raise global and humanitarian issues of significant importance, including the unimaginable suffering we are witnessing in Gaza” with the President.\n\nSaying he wanted to “ensure Scotland’s voice is heard at the highest levels of government across the world” Mr Swinney added: “That is exactly what I will do when I meet with President Trump during his time in Scotland.”","summary":"The US President is meeting a number of political leaders during a private visit to Scotland – but on Saturday was seen

stalled negotiations","text":"Sir Keir Starmer is expected to press Donald Trump on the revival of ceasefire talks between Israel and Hamas as the UK prepares to join efforts to airdrop aid into Gaza.\n\nThe Prime Minister will travel to meet the US president during his visit to Scotland amid mounting global anger over the humanitarian conditions in the war-torn enclave.\n\nCeasefire talks ground to a standstill this week after America and Israel withdrew negotiating teams from Qatar, with Washington’s special envoy Steve Witkoff accusing Hamas of a “lack of desire to reach” an agreement.\n\nThe deal under discussion was expected to include a 60-day ceasefire, and aid supplies would be ramped up as conditions for a lasting truce were brokered.\n\nSir Keir will raise the Trump administration’s work with partners in Qatar and Egypt during his talks with Mr Trump and seek to discuss what more can be done to urgently bring about a ceasefire, it is understood.\n\nThey will also discuss the recently agreed US-UK trade deal and the war in Ukraine.\n\nBritain is working with Jordan on plans to airdrop aid into Gaza and evacuate children needing medical assistance amid international concern about suffering in the Palestinian territory.\n\nHowever, the head of the UN’s Palestinian refugee agency has warned that such efforts are “a distraction” that will fail to properly address deepening starvation in the strip, and could in some cases harm civilians.\n\nLater on Saturday, Israel said it would establish humanitarian corridors to enable UN convoys to transport aid into Gaza, as well as airdrops.\n\nIn a statement, the country’s military said it would allow “safe movement of deliveries of food and medicine” but that the military “emphasises that combat operations have not ceased”.\n\nThe Israel Defence Forces (IDF) also said that there was “no starvation” in Gaza, despite increasing accounts of malnutrition and starvation-related deaths.\n\nThe Prime Minister confirmed that Britain will be “taking forward” plans to airdrop aid into the territory with partners such as Jordan as he held crisis talks with his French and German counterparts on Saturday morning.\n\nIn a readout of the call, Number 10 said the leaders had agreed “it would be vital to ensure robust plans are in place to turn an urgently-needed ceasefire into

Angela speaks for Labour MPs and members on this.'\n\nThe claims come amid a mounting humanitarian disaster in Gaza, with UN agencies warning of the territory running out of specialised food to save severely malnourished children.\n\nBut yesterday, the Prime Minister made clear he was sticking to his policy of insisting that recognising Palestine statehood must come as part of a wider 'pathway to peace' in the region.\n\nIn a social media post after speaking to French president Emmanuel Macron and German chancellor Friedrich Merz, Sir Keir turned his attention to getting food aid into Gaza.\n\nThe Prime Minister said: 'Israel must allow aid in over land to end the starvation unfolding in Gaza. The situation is desperate.'\n\nLast night, Israeli ambassador to the UK Tzipi Hotovely told the Telegraph that recognising a Palestinian state would 'reward' the terrorists behind the October 7 atrocities.\n\nThe statehood row erupted on the eve of Donald Trump's four-day visit to the UK – sparking concern that it could overshadow discussions tomorrow between him and Sir Keir over a trade deal.\n\nMr Trump, who arrived in Scotland on Friday, has made clear his disapproval of Mr Macron's declaration on X last week that France will recognise Palestinian statehood in September, telling reporters at the White House: 'What [Mr Macron] says doesn't matter. He's a very good guy. I like him, but that statement doesn't carry weight.'\n\nThe row in the UK escalated yesterday amid reports that Ms Rayner was '100 per cent' behind other Cabinet ministers who wanted Sir Keir to follow the French president's lead. \n\nHer intervention came hot on the heels of the revelation that more than 130 Labour MPs – almost a third of the parliamentary party – wanted 'immediate recognition'.\n\nLast night, one Labour MP said the combination of Ms Rayner's intervention and the views of so many of his MPs would force Sir Keir's hand.\n\nBut he added that her move regarding Gaza is only the latest sign of how powerful the Deputy PM is becoming.\n\nHe said: 'Her importance in keeping Starmer's Government going is only matched by her clear ambitions to replace him.\n\n'Everybody knows what Angie is doing. She is sending a clear message that she is ready when the time comes.'\n\nLast week, the Deputy PM presented the findings of a year-long study commissioned in the wake of riots after the Southport stabbings last year, warning of the risks illegal immigration now poses to social cohesion in Britain's poorest communities.\n\nShe warned follow Cabinet ministers to 'acknowledge the real concerns people have' about immigration and economic insecurity. \n\nMs Rayner also won favour with many Labour backbenchers earlier this year when it emerged she had suggested raising taxes by up to £4 billion a year ahead of Chancellor Rachel Reeves's Spring Statement in March.\n\nHowever, allies of the Deputy PM pointed to her insistence two months ago that she had no desire to replace Sir Keir.\n\n'I do not want to run for leader of the Labour Party. I rule it out,' she told Laura Kuenssberg in May.","summary":"Sir Keir Starmer will be forced to bow to pressure from 'the real Prime Minister' Angela Rayner and agree to recognise Palestinian statehood within weeks, Labour MPs claimed last night.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-14943693/Starmer-U-turn-Angela-Rayner-recognition-Palestinian-state.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/07/26/23/100662613-0-image-m-47_1753570106112.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-07-26 22:50:34","author":"Brendan Carlin,Editor","authors":["Brendan Carlin","Editor"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.212},{"id":345560546,"title":"US podcaster takes on Trump’s daughter","text":"Stellar: Your new book We Can Do Hard Things was created with the backdrop of a very difficult time for yourself, your wife Abby Wambach and your sister Amanda Doyle, who co-wrote this book and host the popular podcast of the same name with you. You were dealing with an anorexia diagnosis. Abby had lost her beloved brother. Amanda had a breast cancer diagnosis. What was navigating that time like for you? \n\nGlennon Doyle: My sister and my wife are my people. Maybe because I depend on the two of them [so much], I don’t actually have many friends in a wider circle. I’m used to one of them being steady.\n\nWhen I got my new anorexia diagnosis – I’ve been dealing with eating disorders since I was 10 – I felt humiliated. Embarrassed.\n\nI couldn’t believe I’m still dealing with this. I felt like everyone in my life was gonna be like, get over it. But it felt like I was drowning and I looked over at the shore and both the lifeguards were passed out.\n\nMy lifeguards were also having their own moment. \n\nGlennon Doyle (continued): It feels like a very bad design of life that when trauma comes, that’s the time that we can’t remember anything we know. That’s the time we can’t call up all the wisdom we’ve learnt about how to make it through. That sucks. Trauma causes this little mini dissociation. \n\nUnfortunately Abby felt the same way and so did Amanda. So we were just kind of staring at each other blinking. And this cool thing happened.\n\nI started writing down little sentences or quotes or paragraphs that we had said to each other on the podcast and sending them to my sister to help her through the cancer thing. \n\nListen to the full interview with Glennon Doyle on Something To Talk About below: \n\nThen she started writing down things about grief for Abby. And we had this little file going around. And Abby started writing things down for me about bodies. We kept this file that we were just using as an anchor outside of ourselves, which is funny because I’ve spent my entire life telling people that they have all the answers inside of them. I’m no longer positive that’s true. \n\nThree months later, my friend was going through this horrible break-up and I sent her the file we had about grief. And she wrote back and said, “Glennon, can you make me this for all the categories of life? This is what I need.” And\n\nI thought, yeah. I actually can do that. And that’s how it started. That’s how the book was born. \n\nStellar: The book is an exploration of 20 questions that we all wrestle with throughout our lives, and features conversations you’ve had with 118 “of the world’s most brilliant wayfinders”. How did you pull that off? \n\nGlennon Doyle: Some of the passages are from texts between friends, but most of them are from conversations that we had on our podcast. Over time the conversations we had on that podcast really rewired our minds and hearts and the way we saw the world. As we pored through those conversations, we realised people are really talking about the same 20 questions over and over again from their particular slice of life. \n\nSo all I had to do was to wrangle all these people and say “How about this incredible, brilliant thing that you said be put in print?” And most of them were like, “Great. I sound very smart in that.” The people in this book are some of the most open-minded, justice-minded, love-minded and community-minded people on earth. \n\nWe’ve got a lot going on in this country [the US] right now. It really feels like the whole idea of self-help and individual optimisation has failed us. \n\nAnd so what I’m very proud of is that this book is about collective wisdom. It’s about: we can’t figure this out by ourselves, we have to look at the world from as many different perspectives as there are people. And I just think that’s why it’s resonating so much here. It’s about the collective. \n\nStellar: You’re often referred to as a self-help guru. Would you agree with that assessment?\n\nGlennon Doyle: Don’t get me started on the self-help. I have so many male counterparts who write about the same things that I write about, who write about power and power dynamics and life and relationships even, and politics and community. Do you think that any of them are ever labelled “self-help”? \n\nMy books will be in the self-help aisle. My counterparts, men, will be in leadership. \n\nDo you ever hear a man’s work described as self-help?\n\nNo, no, no. Because men, they’re good to go. They just need some leadership skills. Women are just a mess, and they just need help with their little selves. \n\nThat distinction is in every area, right? That’s the literary version, but even, [with] our bodies, men are taught to bulk up [and get] bigger, bigger, bigger and women are taught to get smaller. Money. Men are taught to invest. Women are taught to save. Every single category is about men. Just get bigger, get bolder, go for it. And women … Self-help. You’re not even ready to leave the room. Just get smaller and smaller and fix yourself before you can even approach the world. \n\nSo yes, I have many issues with the self-help title and I think it has a lot to do with gender. \n\nThe whole navel-gazing thing is so interesting. Like, God forbid a man do a little bit\n\nof self-reflection. I would like some men to look harder at their navels. Honestly, I think that would do us all a little bit of good.\n\nStellar: In your home country of the United States, does it feel like a time when people are searching for answers and feeling more isolated than ever?\n\nGlennon Doyle: It’s a nightmare here. It’s awful. We’re seeing our neighbours be rounded up in front of us. I see\n\nit with my own eyes all the time. I was just in children’s immigration court watching two-year-olds represent themselves, separated from their families. \n\nMy family and every LGBTQ family I know is terrified. Parents with trans kids are leaving if they can. It’s a really scary time here. \n\nWith this book, we did a tour. I didn’t want to do that. That’s so much “leaving of my house”. Not just answering my door, but standing on the actual stages. The incredible thing was, I think we have this feeling in the States right now, a lot of media is being suppressed and so it can feel like you’re the only one who cares or the only one who’s afraid or angry or wishes for something better. And this tour was so important to me because it was auditoriums and theatres full of people who were so hopeful and so angry and so united and so beautiful. \n\nThey say hopelessness is just the feeling that nobody else cares, that you’re alone. And so that tour that we did with the We Can Do Hard Things book, I think reinvigorated a lot of us and just reminded us there are still a lot of people here who care, and who will not stand for what’s going down right now here. \n\nListen to the full interview with Glennon Doyle on Something To Talk About below: \n\nStellar: You have used your platform to advocate for many causes, including speaking out against the Trump administration, particularly during the election campaign in 2024. Recently Donald Trump’s daughter Ivanka posted on Instagram a picture of herself holding your memoir Untamed. How did that moment sit with you? \n\nGlennon Doyle: You’re the first person to ask me about that. My team sent it to me. I was stunned. I just didn’t process it completely. \n\nI can tell you honestly that my best guess is she didn’t read it all the way through.\n\nThere’s an entire essay about her dad in it that is about how unbelievable it is that this man is being seen as a leader of what is supposed to be Christian nationalism. \n\nSo I think she probably didn’t get all the way through. But all I can say is, I hope that she does read it. I hope she reads it really, really carefully.

Our teams have been here in Washington, discussing, having virtual meetings, and a committee has been tasked by the prime minister to fine-tune now,” Dar said in a discussion at the Atlantic Council think tank in Washington.\n\n“It’s not going to be months, not even weeks, I would say (just) days,” he said.\n\nThe deputy prime minister shared these views after a productive bilateral meeting with US Secretary of State Marco Rubio earlier in the day; however, the US officials did not offer any timeframe regarding the much-needed trade deal.\n\n“Ties between Pakistan and the US are getting better, and both sides have agreed to work on building a strong, long-term partnership,” he told the audience.\n\nDar noted that his discussion with Rubio covered a broad range of issues, with both sides expressing willingness to bolster cooperation in trade, investment, technology, artificial intelligence (AI), and counter-terrorism.\n\n“We also discussed regional and global matters.”\n\nDar thanked the President Donald Trump-led US administration for playing a helpful role in easing tensions between Pakistan and India.\n\nHe reaffirmed Pakistan’s commitment to close cooperation on global forums, including the UN Security Council, and stressed the need for dialogue in the Iran-Israel conflict.\n\nSpeaking on economic relations with Washington, the deputy prime minister said, “Pakistan wants trade, not aid.”\n\n“Pakistan is planning to give greater access to American products in its markets and welcomes US investors in the mining sector.”\n\nTalking about Pakistan-India tensions, Dar said the two countries need to stop pointing fingers and start building trust if they want to move forward.\n\nOn the topic of terrorism, he said, “Pakistan is already taking action and doesn’t need to be told what to do.”\n\n“India hasn’t given any proof that Pakistan was involved in the Pahalgam attack, Dar said, adding, “India often uses terrorism to shift focus and avoid the real issue, the Kashmir dispute, which remains the main bone of contention between the two neighbours.”\n\nHe told the audience that India has tried several times to change the demographics of the region during its more than 70 years of illegal occupation.\n\nDar also recalled the events leading up to the ceasefire in May, stating that Pakistan ended its military operation in defence of its sovereignty.\n\nHe said Rubio had asked if Pakistan was ready for a ceasefire, to which he replied, “We weren’t ready to start a war in the first place.”\n\nDar said the US had promised to help set up talks between Pakistan and India at a neutral location.\n\n“Pakistan is ready to talk about everything, from Kashmir to terrorism, but made it clear that the talks have to be two-sided.\n\n“Pakistan can’t sit down alone and expect results,” the deputy PM said during his talk at the think tank.\n\n“Pakistan wants no conflict with its neighbours,” he said. “We seek lasting peace in South Asia, built on trade and partnerships, not hostility.”\n\nWhen asked about the US naming The Resistance Front (TRF) a terrorist group, Dar said Pakistan had no issue with the move, but he strongly disagreed with linking TRF to Lashkar-e-Taiba.\n\nHe said that the group was broken up years ago, its members were arrested and jailed, and “TRF has nothing to do with it.”\n\nThe deputy prime minister said the US needs to move away from transactional ties and work towards a more strategic and stable relationship with Pakistan.\n\nHe made it clear that Pakistan’s defence deals with China would not affect its relations with the US, as such decisions depend on which country offers the better deal.\n\nDar also faced questions about Pakistan’s internal political situation.\n\nHe said former PTI chairman Imran Khan used to meet him regularly and that he personally donated to Khan’s hospital.\n\nHe blamed Khan’s 2014 sit-in for halting economic progress and said he had tried to broker a “domestic ceasefire” at the time.\n\nDar criticised Khan for taking up arms against the state on May 9 and said such acts must be dealt with under the law, regardless of one’s popularity.\n\n“No one has the right to attack military installations,” he said. “That’s not politics – that’s treason.”\n\nCommenting on the US imprisonment of Dr Aafia Siddiqui, Dar said he had no objection to it if done under the law, but pointed out that attacking national installations in Pakistan was also an act of treason – a reference to PTI’s alleged violent politics.\n\nTalking about terrorism and extremism, Dar praised former prime minister Nawaz Sharif for taking tough steps against militancy. He criticised the PTI government for undoing that progress.\n\nThe deputy PM said they -Imran Khan-led regime – released over 100 militants, opened the borders, and let 30,000 to 40,000 Taliban fighters come back and regroup inside Pakistan.\n\n“That one cup of tea brought armed rebellion back to life in Pakistan,” he said, in a sharp rebuke of the previous government’s policies.","summary":"Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar said on Friday he was hopeful that a trade deal between Pakistan and the United States could be struck in a matter of days, not weeks. &#8220;I think we are very close to finalizing a deal with the US.

Several held signs invoking the current controversy circling around Mr Trump: his administration’s handling of the Epstein files, the records that pertain to sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.\n\nMel Young, 58, of Alloa, held a sign that said “Release The Epstein Files.” She said her opposition to Mr Trump is far more wide-ranging than concerns about the president’s association with Epstein, but, she argued, it was the latest example of outrageous behaviour.\n\n“I’m just so horrified by the normalisation of cruelty, corruption and mass disinformation,” she said. “This is just one tiny plot of the whole thing.”\n\nSpeaking to reporters Friday, Mr Trump denied reports that he had been briefed that his name was contained within the Epstein files.\n\n“I’m focused on making deals,” he said. “I’m not focused on conspiracy theories.”\n\nMr Trump planned to meet Sunday with Ursula von der Leyen, president of the European Commission, to discuss trade.\n\nThis article originally appeared in The New York Times.\n\n© 2025 The New York Times Company","summary":"THE NEW YORK TIMES: While Donald Trump enjoyed golf at his Turnberry course in Scotland, hundreds of people protest, condemning his immigration policies, Gaza war stance, and Jeffrey Epstein controversy.","url":"https://thewest.com.au/news/world/us-president-trump-faces-hundreds-of-protesters-while-golfing-at-turnberry-scotland-amid-policy-backlash-c-19487005","image":"https://images.thewest.com.au/publication/C-19487005/79947337ff4bdfb630ca3ad47153e17fe88def00-16x9-x0y37w800h450.jpg?imwidth=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-07-26 22:41:32","author":"Luke Broadwater,Luke Broadwatert","authors":["Luke Broadwater","Luke Broadwatert"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"au","sentiment":0.235},{"id":345568042,"title":"London Trans Pride sees ‘record-breaking turnout of 100,000 people’","text":"The London Trans Pride has seen a record-breaking turnout of about 100,000 people, making it “the largest Trans Pride event in history”, organisers have said.\n\nThe march began at 1pm on Saturday near BBC Broadcasting House at Langham Place and reached Parliament Square Gardens later in the afternoon.\n\nSpeeches were delivered by people including Heartstopper actress Yasmin Finney, and trans rights campaigner Caroline Litman, whose transgender daughter Alice took her own life in 2022 after waiting almost three years for gender-affirming healthcare.\n\nAbout 40,000 more people joined London Trans Pride compared with last year, when the event recorded a turnout of about 60,000 people.\n\nOrganisers and participants said this year’s Trans Pride event, the sixth in a row, was of particular importance in the wake of the Supreme Court ruling in April, when judges said the words “woman” and “sex” in the Equality Act 2010 refer to a biological woman and biological sex.\n\nBobby Harding, fundraising lead for London Trans+ Pride, said they were delighted at the large number of people, adding: “It’s so clear how much it’s needed and how much it’s wanted.\n\n“It’s a total honour to be part of history like this, because this is now the largest Trans Pride event in history, in the world.\n\n“We are more determined than ever to show up and let people know that we deserve a place on this earth, and we are entitled to dignity and privacy, as is our human right.”\n\nHarding expressed concern at the consequences of the Supreme Court ruling on trans people, saying the community was increasingly worried about being subjected to violence and discrimination in public spaces.\n\n“People have got a lot of confidence, especially from the ruling, that they think that they have the right to tell someone what toilet they can and can’t use, and what spaces they can and can’t be in,” Harding said.\n\n“It’s really dangerous.\n\n“Because it’s like, if the police want to do it, then we can fight that.\n\n“But the danger is that citizens, individuals, are taking it upon themselves to act out the law which, in any scenario, is wrong.

The war started in October 2023 with a deadly attack by Hamas on Israel.\n\n“The past two years have been extremely difficult for American Muslims,” said Edward Ahmed Mitchell, national deputy director of the Council on American-Islamic Relations, a Muslim civil rights and advocacy organization.\n\nA constant stream of images showing the death, destruction and ongoing starvation in Gaza has taken a toll, said Mitchell, as has a rise in anti-Muslim and anti-Palestinian bigotry in the US\n\nHe pointed to one of the most egregious examples of that bigotry: After the war started, an Illinois man killed a 6-year-old Palestinian American Muslim boy and wounded his mother in a hate-crime attack.\n\nThe recent vandalism reports have left some worried and frustrated – but not entirely surprised.\n\n“Since October 2023, we´ve definitely seen rise in Islamophobia,” said Rawand Abdelghani, who is on the board of directors of Nueces Mosque, one of the affected mosques in Austin, Texas. “Anti-Palestinian, anti-immigrant, all of that rhetoric that´s being said … it has contributed to things like this happening.”\n\nNueces security footage showed someone, their face partially covered, spray-painting what appears to be Star of David symbols at the property. CAIR Austin said similar incidents were reported at two other Austin mosques.\n\nThey all seemingly happened on the same night in May, in what the group described as part of “a disturbing pattern of hate-motivated incidents.” It called for increased security patrols and protective measures.\n\nShaimaa Zayan, CAIR Austin operations manager, called them an intimidation attempt.\n\nLess than two weeks earlier, someone had spray-painted graffiti at the Islamic Center of Southern California, including the Star of David on an outer wall there, center spokesperson Omar Ricci said.\n\n“In light of what´s going on within Palestine and the genocide in Gaza, it felt like an attack,” said Ricci, who´s also a reserve Los Angeles Police Department officer.\n\nSome specifics remained unresolved. The LAPD said it opened a vandalism/hate crime investigation and added extra patrols, but added it has neither a suspect nor a motive and noted that nonreligious spaces were also targeted.\n\nThe Austin Police Department did not respond to Associated Press inquiries.\n\nNueces had already increased its security camera use following three incidents last year, including someone throwing rocks at the mosque, Abdelghani said. After the May vandalism, it also added overnight security, she added.\n\nNueces serves many university students and is considered a “home away from home,” Abdelghani said. It´s where they learn about their faith, meet other Muslims and find refuge, including during tense times, like when some students got arrested amid campus protests last year, she added.\n\nCAIR says that in 2024, its offices nationwide received 8,658 complaints, the highest number it has recorded since its first civil rights report in 1996. It listed employment discrimination as the most common in 2024.\n\nThe group says last year, US Muslims, along with others of different backgrounds, “were targeted due to their anti-genocide … viewpoints.” Referencing former President Joe Biden, the CAIR report said that for “the second year in a row, the Biden-backed Gaza genocide drove a wave of Islamophobia in the United States.”\n\nIsrael has strongly rejected allegations it´s committing genocide in Gaza, where its war with Hamas has killed more than 59,000 Palestinians, according to Gaza health officials. The initial Hamas-led attack on Oct. 7, 2023, killed some 1,200 people, while about 250 were abducted.\n\nThe war has fueled tensions in myriad US settings. After it started, Muslim and Jewish civil rights groups reported a surge of harassment, bias and physical assaults reports against their community members. Pew Research Center in February 2024 found that 70% of US Muslims and nearly 90% of US Jews surveyed say they felt an increase in discrimination against their respective communities since the war began.\n\nMore recently, leaders of US Jewish institutions have called for more help with security after a firebomb attack in Colorado on demonstrators showing support for Israeli hostages in Gaza that left one person killed and others injured, as well as a fatal shooting of two Israeli Embassy staffers outside a Jewish museum in Washington, D.C.\n\nPolitically, the conflict loomed over last year´s presidential election, leaving many pro-Palestinian US voters feeling ignored by their own government´s support for Israel. It has roiled campuses and sparked debates over free speech and where political rhetoric crosses into harassment and discrimination.\n\nThere’ve been bitter disagreements, including among some Jewish Americans, about exactly what the definition of antisemitism should cover, and whether certain criticism of Israeli policies and Zionism should be included. That debate further intensified as President Donald Trump´s administration sought to deport some foreign-born pro-Palestinian campus activists.\n\nThe Islamic Center of Southern California has been targeted before, including vandalism in 2023 and separate threats that authorities said in 2016 were made by a man who was found with multiple weapons in his home.\n\nIncidents like the latest one cause concern, Ricci said.\n\n“People see that it´s not going to take very much to spark something in the city,” he said. “There´s a lot of emotion. There´s a lot of passion” on both the pro-Palestinian and pro-Israeli sides.\n\nSalam Al-Marayati, president of the Muslim Public Affairs Council, said “if people think they can get away with graffiti, then the next step is to firebomb a mosque or even go attack worshippers.”\n\nAl-Marayati and others praised how many have shown support for the affected Muslim communities.\n\n“The best preparation is what we did in Los Angeles and that´s to stand shoulder-to-shoulder with our allies and be there for one another,” he said.\n\nIn Texas, a gathering at Nueces brought together neighbors and others, including Christians and Jews, to paint over the vandalism, clean up the property and garden, Zayan said.\n\n“It was beautiful,” she said.\n\n“It´s really important to open your doors and open your heart and invite people and to rebuild this trust and connection,” she said. “For non-Muslims, it was a great opportunity for them to show their love and support. They really wanted to do something.”","summary":"After a spate of vandalism reports involving graffiti at a few mosques in Texas and California, Muslim leaders there have stepped up existing efforts to keep their sacred spaces and community members safe.

We are not allowed to charge more or less.’\n\nHe added: ‘I’ve done a lot these high society weddings, it’s nothing new to me.’\n\nMeanwhile bewildered tourists were today seen wandering into the church yard, renowned as one of the most beautiful in the country.\n\nOutside the church, thousands of red roses were placed into 5ft-tall balls dotted around the yard.\n\nSt Michael’s is one of the most beautiful venues in the Cotswolds and was the choice when film director Sam Mendes and classical musician Alison Balsom had their 2017 ceremony there. \n\nEve, who once was named by society bible Tatler as one of its ‘new generation of It Girls’, and sportsman Harry got engaged last September and began dating in 2022, making their debut just a year ago at the Paris Olympic Games. \n\nOn Thursday, the couple – joined by their groomsmen and bridesmaids – completed a final dress rehearsal at the church for a 90-minute run through. \n\nParents of the bride and groom – Eve’s mother Laurene and Harry’s parents Peter and Tara – arrived in the picturesque village of Great Tew by private limousine.\n\nThe glamorous bridesmaids and the groomsmen, meanwhile, were bussed to the event in private hire coaches.\n\nUpon their arrival, the party were shielded from prying eyes as they entered the church grounds surrounded by orange umbrellas hoisted by private security guards.\n\nThe wedding party is due to take place at the stunning Estelle Manor country hotel set at Eynsham Hall this evening, where rooms start at £795.\n\nThe Manor is renowned internationally as venue for huge weddings as its copious grounds can accommodated hundreds of guests – while some guests are believed to be staying at the and the celebrity-famous Soho Farmhouse nearby.\n\nSoho Farmhouse is a glamorous private members club is beloved by A-list celebrities – even hosting Meghan Markle’s hen do in 2018 – as the place to go for private events for the social elite, all with the background of Britain’s finest countryside. \n\nAnd on the guestlist are a mixture of British sports stars, American politicians and even a sprinkling of royalty. \n\nFormer US Vice President Kamala Harris was pictured at a pre-wedding evening in The Bull pub in Charlbury, which also reportedly included Bruce Springsteen’s equestrian daughter, Jessica. \n\nBlacked-out SUVs and men in black suits identifying themselves as US secret services swarmed the country pub as it held the event.\n\nEve’s mother Laurene, left a widow following Jobs’ passing in 2011 aged 56 from pancreatic cancer, is said to have gone ‘all out’ for the wedding with help from renowned society events planner Stanlee Gatti.\n\nA-list parties flew to Oxford airport on their private jets, where they were met by helicopters to transport them to the venue.\n\nMaking the VIP guestlist are Kamala’s daughter Phoebe and Bill Gates’s daughter Jennifer, according to The Sun newspaper.\n\nKamala’s attendance is thanks to her long-time friendship with Eve’s mother.\n\nLaurene and Kamala have been friends for over 20 years, with the billionaire philanthropist backing Kamala’s run for US presidency last year, which she eventually lost to President Donald Trump. \n\nAnd it’s not just Kamala set to make an impression from the politics scene in the US – as a source told the paper that ‘a lot of important American political figures’ will be present. \n\nBelieved to have joined them are celebs including Arctic Monkeys star Matt Helders, Apple designer Jony Ive, Sofia Abramovich, daughter of ex-Chelsea owner Roman and Bill Gates’ daughter Jennifer. \n\nSources close to the family previously said invites have gone out to figures from fashion, sport, and business, with Princess Beatrice and her husband Edo among the confirmed guests. \n\n Brooklyn Peltz-Beckham and his wife Nicola Peltz, 30, are understood to have attended the wedding, just a stones throw away from the Beckham family home in the Cotswolds.\n\nNicola and Brooklyn, who is estranged from his former footballer father David, fashion designer mother Victoria and from brothers Romeo and Cruz, is said by guests to be staying at Soho Farmhouse which neighbours the Beckham’s estate.\n\nIt’s not known how the Peltz-Beckhams know that happy couple, and a spokesman for Brooklyn did not respond to requests for comment yesterday.\n\nKourtney Kardashian is also believed to have jetted in for after sharing a number of idyllic snap from the Cotswolds on Instagram ahead of the wedding.\n\nEve, a model and show jumper in her own right, has two older siblings and one half-sibling.

However it’s currently not known if her half sibling Lisa Brennan-Jobs, 47, will attend.\n\nAside from her siblings, Eve has a plethora of high-profile friends descended from other tech billionaires, who will likely see her walk down the aisle.\n\nShe is also friends with Lilli Hymowitz, daughter of billionaire Gregg Hymowitz, the CEO and founder of investment firm EnTrust Global.\n\nIn 2023, Eve was spotted mingling amongst high society’s wealthiest members at a gala in New York City, including Rupert Murdoch’s ex-wife Wendi Deng, who she struck a pose with for photos, and Lili Buffett, the granddaughter of billionaire investor and philanthropist Warren Buffet.\n\nOn top of Eve’s impressive connections, Harry has his own entourage.\n\nHis father is Peter Charles, whose team won Britain’s first team jumping gold medal for 60 years at the 2012 London Summer Olympics.\n\nWhile his Olympic teammates Scott Brash and Ben Maher would have been expected to make the guestlist, having claimed victory in team jumping together at the Paris Olympics. \n\nHarry has represented Great Britain internationally and is currently one of the sport’s top-ranked athletes.\n\nThe couple share a passion for horses and are frequently seen supporting each other at events.\n\nEve, a self-described ‘horse girl’, started riding when she was just six years old and had made some considerable achievements, including winning a bronze medal in the team event at the 2019 Pan American Games in Lima, Peru.\n\nShe was front and centre to watch Harry win his gold medal last year and shared a loving post on Instagram with the caption: ‘TEAM GOLD!!!!!! Beyond proud of you my love!!!!’ \n\nEve made her modelling debut in a 2020 holiday campaign for makeup brand Glossier alongside Sydney Sweeney and Naomi Smalls. Eve is signed to DNA Model Management, who also represents Kaia Gerber and Emily Ratajkowski. \n\nAs the youngest daughter of late billionaire Apple mogul Steve Jobs, most would assume that Eve must’ve grown up without a want or need in the world. \n\nSteve Jobs died in 2011 from pancreatic cancer, and according to his official biographer, Walter Isaacson, Jobs didn’t doubt that it would be his youngest daughter who would run Apple in the future.\n\nIn his biography about Steve, writer Walter Isaacson described the youngest Jobs as a ‘strong-willed, funny firecracker.’\n\nHe said that as a child, Eve would often call up her father’s assistant and make her clear out his calendar so that they could spend one-on-one father-daughter time together.\n\nThe family grew up in a ‘low-key Tudor-style house on a prosperous street’ in Palo Alto, California, according to U2 front man Bono.\n\nIt’s been said that the billionaire Apple founder did his best to give his children a normal upbringing, despite his immense wealth.\n\nThe outlet reported that he had ‘no live-in help, no security guards, no drivers.’\n\nHe also once revealed that he limited his kids’ technology use – even though he created one of the most successful tech companies on the planet. \n\nSteve passed away from pancreatic cancer in 2011, when Eve was 12, and was worth an estimated $10.5 billion at the time of his death.\n\nBut Eve and her siblings won’t get any of his money, as he left his immense wealth to wife Laurene who revealed in 2020 that she has no plans to give any of it to their kids.\n\nShe told the New York Times that her husband made it clear before his death that he didn’t want to pass his earnings down to their kids because he wanted them to work for their own money.\n\n‘I inherited my wealth from my husband, who didn’t care about the accumulation of wealth,’ she said.\n\n‘I’m not interested in legacy wealth building, and my children know that… Steve wasn’t interested in that. If I live long enough, it ends with me.’\n\nWhile both Reed and Erin lead relatively private lives out of the spotlight, Eve has opted for the opposite, launching a major modeling career.\n\nLike both of her parents, she graduated from Stanford University in 2021, where she majored in science, technology, and society.\n\nShe then made her runway debut at Paris Fashion Week while walking in the Coperni show that September. \n\nEve has since posed for a slew of big brands and magazines like Glossier, Louis Vuitton, Vogue, and Vanity Fair. \n\nBesides her modeling career, Eve is also an experienced equestrian and was named Show Jumping Hall of Fame ‘Rider of the Month’ in March 2017.\n\nShe has competed in show jumping competitions all around the globe, including events in the Hamptons, Lexington, Kentucky, Canada, and the United Kingdom, and was ranked as the fifth best rider under 25 in the world by Horse Sports in 2019.\n\nPrior to her relationship with Harry, Eve was linked to Mexican show jumper and University of Miami business student Eugenio Garza Pérez, according to the Latin Times.\n\nThere were also rumors that she dated singer Harry Hudson, Chainsmokers member Drew Taggart, and Outer Banks star Chase Stokes.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nApple heiress Eve Jobs has exchanged vows with Team GB showjumper Harry&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Apple Heiress Eve Jobs Marries Team GB Olympian in Charming Cotswolds Ceremony first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/news/apple-heiress-eve-jobs-marries-team-gb-olympian-in-charming-cotswolds-ceremony/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Apple-heiress-Eve-Jobs-weds-Team-GB-Olympic-star-in.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-07-26 22:32:14","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.192},{"id":345558812,"title":"Jordan's King, US President Hold Phone Call on Regional Developments in Gaza and Syria","text":"Amman, July 26 (QNA) - King Abdullah II of Jordan spoke on the phone Saturday with US President Donald Trump and discussed the overall situation in the region, particularly the developments in Gaza and Syria.\n\nKing Abdullah reaffirmed, during the call, the importance of stepping up efforts to halt the war on Gaza and ensure the flow of aid to all regions across the Strip, culminating in the alleviation of the perilous and tragic situation.\n\nJordan will diligently work side by side with the United States and the active nations to achieve peace that ensures the security and stability of the entire region, King Abdullah pointed out.\n\nHe noted the close coordination between Jordan and the United States in de-escalating tensions in Syria and underlined the importance of maintaining its stability and territorial integrity.

Cambodia's Defense Ministry on Saturday, however, condemned what it called an \"unprovoked and premeditated act of aggression\" after five heavy artillery shells were fired into a Cambodian province.

'Particularly early in her public life, people said she could just be really different when the cameras were off.'\n\nGwyneth Paltrow allegedly has a sign over her parking spot at Goop headquarters that reads: 'Reserved for G-Spot,' her biographer claims; pictured in April\nSince its launch in 2008, Goop has become known for advice ranging from the idiosyncratic to the bizarre, exhorting women to steam clean their vaginas and theorizing about a 'Link Between Underwire Bras And Breast Cancer.'\nHowever the brand has been constantly expanding ever since, and five years ago it even sprouted its own Netflix series The Goop Lab.\n\nEXCLUSIVE Gwyneth Paltrow's smutty favorite sex position and Jennifer Lopez's X-rated confessions aren't empowering. They're grotesque: MAUREEN CALLAHAN \nGwyneth hit headlines around the world at the dawn of 2020 for releasing a $75 candle on Goop called This Smells Like My Vagina.\nThe product, which rapidly sold out, was marketed as smelling of 'geranium, citrusy bergamot, and cedar absolutes juxtaposed with Damask rose and ambrette seed.'\nHer vagina candle was such a runaway success that Gwyneth followed it up with another $75 candle, this one supposedly with the aroma of her orgasm.\nGoop lists 'tart grapefruit, neroli, and ripe cassis berries blended with gunpowder tea and Turkish rose absolute' as the components of the scent.\nTo mark the 49th anniversary of Roe v. Wade in January 2022, Gwyneth released yet another Goop candle called Hands Off My Vagina.\nThe limited edition candle cost $75, with $25 of each sale going to the Reproductive Freedom Project of the ACLU Foundation, according to Goop.\n\nIn an interview promoting the project, biographer Amy Odell has observed that Gwyneth is 'someone who has monetized her sexuality and her sex life'\n\nAmy Odell, who previously wrote a book about the life of Anna Wintour , is the author of the hotly anticipated new volume Gwyneth: The Biography\nMonths later, the Supreme Court handed the authority to set abortion law back to the states by overturning Roe v.

The new order that was signed on Thursday completely bans the pay-for-play concept in college athletics, where the NIL collectives and boosters were misusing their authority by funneling money to build rosters and aid high school recruiting.No more extra funds can be pumped into a program unless the players directly get involved in endorsements and third-party deals. Speaking about the recent changes, Saban mentioned the concept of an NIL Go clearinghouse, an attribute introduced in the House vs. NCAA settlement.This clearinghouse will work as a watchdog or a regulatory authority to validate the NIL contracts signed by the players. Any third-party deal that exceeds a $600 limit needs to be authenticated by NIL Go, which is subject to being accepted or rejected after certain background verifications.“I think the clearinghouse is there to authenticate name, image and likeness,\" Saban said to Fox News [Timestamp - 1:40]. \"In other words, is your marketing value relative to what you're getting paid to do a marketing opportunity?“That's where, when you cross that line, that's where it becomes pay-for-play. So you have collectives that raise money that pay players, and they really don't do a relative marketing job to earn that money. And that's where, you know, this whole thing has kind of gotten sideways. \"And I think this whole clearinghouse is there to, you know, sort of protect the collective affecting competitive balance in college sports.\"How NIL executive order could affect other sportsIn college athletics throughout the country, only football and basketball are known for generating a major chunk of total revenue for a school. With football taking a share of over 75%, all other sports fall under the shelter of the remaining 25%. With a sudden hard stop on pay-for-play and NIL booster money, the cash flow is expected to take a massive hit.Nick Saban reacted to this scenario, saying that college athletics was never meant to be a business. Such rules are introduced in order to maintain the sanctity of college athletics. There is only a limit to how many non-revenue-generating sports can be accommodated in a school. Hence, the universities need to play it smart.Saban hopes there will be more such legislation coming in to eradicate disparity in men's and women's sports while also helping other sports find ways to generate more money.","summary":"On Friday, legendary coach Nick Saban explained US President Donald Trump's executive NIL order to stop bidding wars.","url":"https://www.sportskeeda.com/college-football/news-the-clearinghouse-authenticate-nil-nick-saban-breaks-concept-nil-go-trump-s-new-executive-order-gets-enforced","image":"https://staticg.sportskeeda.com/editor/2025/07/26645076-1753555319.jpeg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-07-26 22:12:36","author":"Deepesh Nair","authors":["Deepesh Nair"],"language":"en","source_country":"in","sentiment":-0.121},{"id":345554452,"title":"Joy Taylor drops 4-word message while visiting nephew Mason Taylor at Jets training camp","text":"Joy Taylor, the former co-host of Speak with Keyshawn Johnson and Paul Pierce, shared a special moment on Saturday.

Isaiah Martin, running for Houston’s 18th Congressional District, defied repeated warnings to stop speaking after testimony accusing Republicans of rigging the redistricting process to appease President Donald Trump. Footage from the hearing shows Martin collapsing as he was pulled from the room by authorities. \"History will NOT remember you for what you have DONE! It is a shame!\" he yelled, prompting audible gasps from the crowd. He was charged with resisting arrest, criminal trespass and disrupting a public meeting. RED STATE MAP BATTLE HEATS UP AS TRUMP PUSHES TEXAS PLAN TO RESHAPE CONGRESSIONAL DISTRICTS Martin was released from the Travis County Jail Friday, and all charges were dropped. He later posted a video on X thanking supporters and pledging to continue speaking out. Martin began his testimony Thursday by challenging the legitimacy of the hearing. \"It just seems as if many are just sitting here going with their motions, and it makes sense because the game is rigged,\" he said. He then accused Texas Republicans of gerrymandering at Trump’s request. \"You gotta get Trump’s endorsement. That’s the name of the game to be a Republican nowadays,\" Martin said. \"Trump told every single one of you that he needs five seats. ... But the real conversation we should be having ... is that there will be a retaliation for that.\" Martin cited blue states he claimed are redrawing maps in response. \"Gov. Kathy Hochul said that she will be gerrymanding Republicans out,\" he said. \"The same thing is gonna happen in New Jersey.\" Martin also attacked Texas’ leadership over economic issues. \"We live in a state that is unaffordable ... property taxes going up ... despite the fact that you Republicans have been in office for nearly 30 straight years,\" he said. BETO O'ROURKE CALLS FOR DEMOCRATS TO BE 'RUTHLESS' IN PURSUIT OF POWER, BACKS NEWSOM'S GERRYMANDERING PROPOSAL Criticizing the timing of the redistricting process, he added, \"After one of the worst mass casualty events in our state’s history, you choose to go and gerrymander people out of their seats.\" Rep. Cody Vasut, the House Redistricting Committee chair, attempted to regain order, but Martin refused to yield. \"No, I’m not going to finish. Because I’m ... I’m NOT finished!\" Martin then turned his ire toward Trump. \"You can thank your failed, senile, dilapidated, Epstein-partying with president for all of the work that we’re about to do to every single one of you,\" he said. \"You did this, you caused this and this is the result of you and your work.\" Vasut instructed state House sergeants to remove Martin. As Martin was dragged from the room, audience members shouted, \"Get off of him!\" Martin continued shouting, \"America will rise up against you!\" The committee resumed without commenting on the disruption.

While mortgage real estate investment trust (mREIT) AGNC Investment (AGNC 0.94%) was able to navigate the market, the environment weighed on its results.\n\nWith the stock yielding more than 15%, let's see if better days could be ahead and whether the stock can maintain its dividend.\n\nRates remain in focus\n\nAGNC is an mREIT that primarily holds a portfolio of MBSes that are backed by government-sponsored agencies, such as Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. MBSes are residential mortgages that are bundled into bond-like securities, and since they are backed by government-sponsored agencies, they are generally regarded as being largely free from the risk of default.\n\nHowever, like other bonds, interest rates have an effect on MBS values, and their yields trade at a spread to U.S. Treasury yields, which are considered the ultimate safe haven. A few years ago, mREITs came under significant pressure due to the Fed raising rates and MBS spreads widening, as the Fed let MBSes that it had acquired as part of earlier quantitative easing roll off its balance sheet. This also led to the highly publicized blowup of Silicon Valley Bank, which was heavily invested in MBSes at the time. Since then, with regulatory tightening, banks have shied away from owning longer-duration assets like MBSes.\n\nOn its Q2 call, AGNC said that despite the Federal Reserve and Treasury Department indicating that beneficial regulatory reforms were coming, banks remained largely on the sidelines. It also noted that foreign investor demand appeared subdued due to a weak U.S. dollar and geopolitical risk. However, it noted that MBS spreads have tightened since quarter-end and that it expects banks and foreign investor demand to grow in the future. This dynamic could help the current wide MBS spread to narrow. \n\nImportantly, AGNC said comments from President Trump and Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent should help ease any investor concerns about the future of Fannie and Freddie and their role in the mortgage markets. Trump said that while he wants to take the GSEs (Fannie and Freddie) public, he will do so with the U.S. government keeping its implicit guarantee. In addition, Treasury Secretary Bessent said one requirement of privatization would be for MBS spreads to remain the same, and ideally, he wants them tightened. That should help take a major potential risk off the table for AGNC and other mREITs. \n\nOne of the most important metrics for mREITs is their tangible book value (TBV), which is essentially the value of their portfolio. The market turmoil caused AGNC's TBV to fall 5%, or $0.44 per share, to $7.81 at the end of Q2, down from $8.25 per share at the end of Q1. It said it has risen 1% for July after deducting its dividend. \n\nLooking at other important metrics in the quarter, AGNC's average net interest spread was 2.01%, compared to 2.69% a year ago and 2.12% in the first quarter. The narrower spread stems from the lessening benefits of its hedges and higher hedge costs.\n\nOverall, AGNC generated $0.38 per share in net spread and income from dollar rolls (a hedging strategy equivalent to short-selling but specifically employed in MBS markets to avoid losses when MBS values decline), which it uses to pay out its dividend. It generated a negative 1% economic return on its tangible common equity, with its TBV falling $0.44 per share while it paid out $0.36 per share in dividends during the quarter.\n\nAGNC ended the quarter with higher debt, with 7.6 times tangible net book value \"at risk\" leverage (debt + net receivables or payables for unsettled investment securities outstanding/shareholder equity excluding goodwill). That compares to 7.5 at the end of the first quarter and 7.4 a year ago.\n\nThe company said it was in a position to deploy capital at a measured pace, but that it has room to increase leverage slightly. During the quarter, it raised $800 million in equity through its ATM (at-the-market) program at a significant premium to its TBV. It had invested less than half the proceeds at quarter-end and will continue to put the money to work. While equity raises are dilutive for companies, when mortgage REITs raise equity above TBV, it actually increases the TBV, so it is a positive. \n\nIs AGNC stock a buy?\n\nAGNC is still generating enough income to cover its large dividend, and it expects its net spread and dollar roll income to stay in the mid- to high-$0.30 to the low- to mid-$0.40 range, which should help support it. However, for the stock to really work, it needs to see its TBV rally. The Fed seems reluctant to lower interest rates at the moment, although the biggest TBV catalyst for the mREIT would be tighter MBS spreads. \n\nWide spreads can be beneficial to AGNC when it's putting money to work and investing in MBSes, as it can get higher returns. However, it needs the spreads to eventually narrow for the stock to benefit. AGNC said that a high percentage of its mortgage-backed securities is in specified pools with favorable prepayment attributes, so it is not likely to see a lot of refinancing with lower rates. As such, lower rates and spreads would be a big benefit for the stock.\n\nWith MBS spreads near historical highs, I think risk-tolerant, income-oriented investors can buy the stock at current levels, as I think further TBV downside appears limited. However, the current stock price does appear to somewhat reflect this.","url":"https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/07/26/agnc-investment-tough-environment-continues-but-ar/","image":"https://g.foolcdn.com/image/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fg.foolcdn.com%2Feditorial%2Fimages%2F826309%2Fgettyimages-1324119709.jpg&amp;op=resize&amp;w=1200&amp;h=630","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-07-26

Ukraine","text":"Civilian deaths mounted as Russia continued to press its offensive in eastern Ukraine, claiming to have captured two more villages, as Ukrainian leader Volodymyr Zelenskyy vowed to retaliate with further attacks inside Russia.\n\nUkraine did not immediately comment directly on claims by the Russian Defense Ministry that its forces had on July 26 captured Zeleniy Hai in the Donetsk region and the village of Malyivka in the Dnipropetrovsk region.\n\nZelenskyy did acknowledge heavy fighting along the frontlines in Ukraine's eastern regions, but he also spoke of “successful actions by our units” in the embattled Sumy region and said his forces were “eliminating the occupiers in the border areas.”\n\nDetails could not immediately be verfified.\n\nZelenskyy also said the focal point of Russian assaults remained near the important logistics hub of Pokrovsk, a city with a prewar population of more than 60,000 but which now is mostly in ruins from Russian air strikes.\n\nIn his nightly video address, Zelenskyy said Ukrainian military commander Oleksandr Syrskiy identified Pokrovsk as an area requiring \"special attention\" amid constant Russian attacks.\n\nMilitary spokesman Viktor Trehubov told Ukrainian TV that Russian forces were attacking Pokrovsk in \"a small torrent...that simply does not stop\"\n\nThe violence comes three days after Ukrainian and Russian officials held a third direct meeting in Istanbul amid efforts to end the conflict, which ignited into a full-blown war following Russia's invasion of February 2022.\n\nThose talks made progress on further swaps of prisoners and the remains of fallen soldiers, but no breakthroughs were apparent on efforts to reach a cease-fire.\n\nUS President Donald Trump, showing frustration at Russian leader Vladimir Putin's refusal to agree to a cease-fire, in mid-July threatened to impose new sanctions on Moscow if it doesn’t reach a deal with Kyiv by early September.\n\nZelenskyy said Russia's latest attacks were a \"response\" to Kyiv's proposal of an immediate cease-fire during the peace talks.\n\nZelenskyy vowed to retaliate with further attacks on military sites inside Russia after civilian deaths mounted on July 26 in multiple Ukrainian regions under the fire of Russian artillery and drone strikes.\n\n“Today, unfortunately, there were numerous Russian strikes on our cities and our communities: Sumy – including Ukrainian energy infrastructure, as well as Dnipro, Kharkiv, Kherson region, and Donetsk region,” Zelenskyy said in his July 26 video address.\n\n\"Such strikes certainly cannot be left without response, and Ukrainian long-range drones ensure one,\" he posted separately on X.\n\n\"Russian military enterprises, Russian logistics, and Russian airfields must see that Russia's own war is now hitting them back with real consequences,” Zelenskyy posted.\n\nAleksandr Khinshtein, governor of Russia's Kursk region, on July 26 claimed that a Ukranian drone had killed one person in the village of Obesta, about 5 kilometers from the border.\n\nZelenskyy also said he instructed officials to be more active in attracting external funding for drones.\n\n\"I also instructed government officials and the defense minister to more actively review all our agreements we have with our partners -- the ones we must implement fully, but which, unfortunately, are currently still only partially being carried out,\" he added without being specific.\n\nZelenskyy has announced that his country had secured funding for three US-made Patriot missile defense systems and is negotiating for seven more of the air-defense systems, part of a new agreement that enables European allies to buy US weaponry for Kyiv.\n\nCivilian Casualties Mount\n\nFollowing Russia’s large-scale overnight attacks on Ukraine's Dnipropetrovsk and Kharkiv regions -- which left multiple people dead and injured -- the head of the regional military administration, Serhiy Lysak, said the Russian military attacked the Nikopol and Synelnykove districts of the Dnipropetrovsk region.\n\nLysak said a 66-year-old man died in the Nikopol region, while three people were injured in the Synelnykove district.\n\nSerhij Gorbunov, military administrator of the strategic frontline city of Kostyantynivka, wrote on social media that a civilian was killed as the result of a drone attack and urged residents to evacuate away from oncoming Russian forces.\n\n“We urge all residents to take care of themselves and their loved ones! Do not ignore the threat — evacuate to safer regions in a timely manner,” he wrote.\n\nKharkiv Mayor Ihor Terekhov said five people -- including three emergency workers -- were injured while responding to an earlier strike. Sumy military Governor Oleh Hryhorov said three people were hurt in air attacks in the northeast Ukrainian region.\n\nRussia denies targeting civilian areas despite widespread evidence of such attacks.\n\nWith reporting by Reuters and dpa","summary":"Civilian deaths mounted as Russia continued to press its offensive in eastern Ukraine, claiming to have captured two more villages, as Ukrainian leader Volodymyr Zelenskyy vowed to retaliate with further attacks inside Russia.","url":"https://www.rferl.org/a/russia-ukraine-donetsk-dnipropetrovsk-zelenskyy-putin-trump/33484663.html","image":"https://gdb.rferl.org/bd165ac2-97d8-41fa-8bd1-7ff3d1386d70_cx0_cy6_cw0_w1080_h608.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-07-26 22:04:46","author":"Rfe/rl","authors":["Rfe/rl"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"iq","sentiment":-0.449},{"id":345557864,"title":"Copper under pressure as demand falters ahead of crucial week","text":"LONDON: Copper prices fell on Friday as physical buyers paused ahead of a week that could prove pivotal if it brings more clarity about the US copper import tariff and the US trade agreements with other countries. \n\nThree-month copper on the London Metal Exchange fell 0.4% to $9,839 a ton in official open-outcry trading.

You got to get your act together… you got to stop this horrible invasion that’s happening to Europe.’\n\nHe also made a tremendous claim that ‘last month we had nobody entering our country. Nobody. Shut it down’.\n\nWe will wait for the research before accepting that assertion. But there is no doubt that Mr Trump has, by decisive action, significantly reduced illegal arrivals in the United States.\n\nNo doubt it helps to have weak, compliant neighbours. And this policy has followed more than 30 years during which America has been transformed by colossal mass migration, legal and illegal.\n\nBut the President is right that Europe cannot indefinitely sustain migration at current levels. And that warning, of course, includes this country.\n\nWhatever will he say about this when he meets his friend Sir Keir Starmer tomorrow in Scotland? The two men have an unlikely but undoubted rapport. But how will it survive if their conversation turns to the subject of migration?\n\nThe Mail on Sunday reports today the latest plans of Home Secretary Yvette Cooper to find some way of restricting the cross-Channel boat traffic on the justified basis that these vessels are profoundly unsafe, especially for women and children. This is plainly well-intentioned but it is hard to see it as a game-changer.\n\nThose who pay small fortunes to board these boats are frighteningly ready to take grave risks.\n\nMeanwhile, the Prime Minister has inflicted a very serious wound on himself by his absurd claim – which will haunt him for years to come – that ‘there is lots of housing and many local authorities that can be used, and we’re identifying where it can be used’, to accommodate both rising numbers of homeless people and migrants.\n\nHis statement is disastrously wrong and out of kilter with years of official claims that we must build new housing in great numbers at all costs.\n\nIt casts doubt on his awareness of the problems before him and on his knowledge of the true state of the country.\n\nHe really said this, unlike France’s Queen Marie Antoinette who never actually said ‘let them eat cake’ about starving peasants unable to afford bread.\n\nEven some on the Left are beginning to see that the social pressures created by the housing of migrants in hotels in towns across the country are dangerous. They simply cannot dismiss objections as bigotry.\n\nAnd while nasty troublemakers will no doubt do all they can to exploit these events, many of the protesters in such places as Epping are non-violent, respectable, open-minded people who have simply had enough of being treated as if they did not exist and their concerns don’t matter.\n\nIt is people very much like them, in the USA, who have upended politics in that country. They have cast aside old parties and played-out politicians who ignored them for too long. All the established British parties and their leaders should take note, and do so soon.","summary":"MAIL ON SUNDAY COMMENT: Acting as if he was President of the world, Donald Trump marked his latest arrival in Britain by delivering a lecture to Europe on immigration.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-14943479/mail-sunday-comment-trump-migration.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/07/26/18/100660271-0-image-m-22_1753551293625.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-07-26 22:00:49","author":"Editor,Mail","authors":["Editor","Mail"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.177},{"id":345553060,"title":"USDA to Relocate Thousands of Employees, Consolidate Agency Functions","text":"THE CENTER SQUARE—In the coming months, the U.S. Department of Agriculture will relocate more than half of its Washington D.C.-based employees to five different regional hubs across the country.\n\nThe move is part of USDA’s larger plan “to achieve improved effectiveness and accountability, enhanced services, reduced bureaucracy and cost savings for the American people,” according to the announcement memo.\n\nApproximately 4,600 USDA employees currently reside in D.C., a growth of 8% over the past four years. With a nearly 15% salary increase during that time as well, the Donald Trump administration says the USDA Department Reorganization plan will ensure that the agency can afford its workforce.\n\nUSDA Secretary Brooke Rollins estimates that roughly 2,000 employees will be left in D.C. after the relocations are complete. The other 2,600 will disperse to one of USDA’s five regional hub locations, located in Raleigh, North Carolina; Kansas City, Missouri; Indianapolis, Indiana; Fort Collins, Colorado; and Salt Lake City, Utah.\n\nThe agency also will end some leases and vacate some buildings in the D.C. area, as well as reduce regional office management layers. Core administrative support locations in Albuquerque, New Mexico and Minneapolis, Minnesota will remain operational.\n\nAdditionally, management of civil rights functions, legislative affairs, Freedom of Information Act responses, human resources, and leases will each be consolidated under different offices.\n\nRollins said the reorganization will bring the USDA “closer to the people it serves.” She intends to ensure that the transition works “as smooth and as minimally disruptive as possible” for affected USDA staff and their families. \n\n“We will carry out this reorganization through a transparent, common-sense process that preserves USDA’s critical health and safety services that the American public relies on,” Rollins said. “We are embarking on a new chapter that will improve our service to the great patriotic farmers, ranchers, and producers that we are mandated to support.”\n\nWhile most Republicans view the move as a fiscally responsible way to efficiently manage resources, Democrats have blasted it as reckless.\n\n“The planned reorganization announced by the Agriculture Secretary without notice or input from Congress or key stakeholders and constituencies demonstrates that this administration … is willfully risking the effectiveness of the agencies and programs that support America’s family farmers,” House Agriculture Committee Ranking Member Angie Craig, D-Minn., said.\n\nSince the second Trump administration took office, 15,364 USDA employees have voluntarily chosen deferred resignation. In 2024, the agency’s workforce numbered nearly 100,000 individuals.\n\nOriginally published by The Center Square.","summary":"THE CENTER SQUARE—In the coming months, the U.S. Department of Agriculture will relocate more than half of its Washington D.C.-based employees to five different regional...

In contrast, Republicans are now trusted more on key issues like the economy, immigration and crime.The poll, which surveyed 1,500 registered voters between July 16-20, found Republicans have taken the lead on eight of 10 issues tested. Despite President Donald Trump's continued unpopularity in the polls, the GOP leads in overall party identification. The Journal's poll has a margin of error of plus or minus 2.5 percentage points.Why It MattersIn last year's presidential election, Trump beat then-Vice President Kamala Harris, the Democratic presidential nominee, by 2 points in the popular vote, 50 to 48 percent. Trump also won the electoral vote, which decides the winner, 312-226.The Democratic Party faced a string of defeats in the 2024 election cycle when it came to the U.S. House and Senate, with the party's struggles for a clear message and effective leadership intensifying as the 2026 midterm elections approach.The new poll signals a significant warning for Democrats. Although Trump remains a polarizing figure, the data suggests that voters are increasingly viewing the party as ineffective on core issues like inflation, border security, and crime.What To KnowAccording to the Journal's poll, Democrats now face a net favorability of -30 points, with only one-third of voters expressing any positive sentiment toward the party. This marks the worst performance for Democrats in the newspaper's polling history to date.While Trump's handling of inflation and tariffs drew significant disapproval—11 and 17 points respectively—voters still trust Republicans more than Democrats to manage those issues in Congress. The GOP holds a 10-point advantage on inflation and a 7-point edge on tariffs.The only policy areas where Democrats outperform Republicans in the poll are health care and vaccine policy, suggesting the party retains some credibility on public health issues.The president's net unfavorability stands at -7 points, with the GOP slightly worse at -11. However, Trump's favorability has remained relatively steady through the first six months of his second term, even as other polls show sharper declines.Despite the negative sentiment, 46 percent of voters say they would back a Democrat for Congress if an election were held today, compared to 43 percent who would support a Republican. That margin is narrower than the 8-point advantage Democrats had at the same point in Trump's first term in 2017.What People Are SayingBill McInturff, a Republican pollster not connected to the Journal's survey, said: \"We were already watching the tide moving out for the Republican Party by this point in 2017, and that's not where we are today. And that's worth jumping up and down and trying to explain: how much more competitive Trump and the Republicans are today than in 2017.\"John Anzalone, a Democratic pollster who worked on the Journal survey, said: \"The Democratic brand is so bad that they don't have the credibility to be a critic of Trump or the Republican Party. Until they reconnect with real voters and working people on who they're for and what their economic message is, they're going to have problems.\"What Happens Next?Democrats face mounting pressure to redefine their economic message and rebuild trust with working-class voters. Meanwhile, Republicans are likely to double down on their perceived strengths in fiscal and foreign policy ahead of next year's midterms.","summary":"The only policy areas where Democrats outperform Republicans in the new poll from the Wall Street Journal are health care and vaccine policy.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/democratic-party-approval-rating-hits-30-year-low-wsj-poll-2104572","image":"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2690902/chuck-schumer.jpg?w=1600&h=900&q=88&f=5c33b35b0790e7ee1ff3997195e2def6","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-07-26 21:53:08","author":"Amanda Castro","authors":["Amanda Castro"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.161}]}
