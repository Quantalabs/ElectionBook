The actress has been left 'fearing' for her career, and appears to be lying low with her popstar bestie at her $17m home in Rhode Island Exclusive DailyMail.com pictures show Lively with her arms around husband Ryan, who donned a cap and a backpack The blonde was seen frowning into the sunshine, dressed in floral shorts and a coral bikini top, with her long tresses up in a bun Blake, for her part, has been slammed for using her alcohol brand to promote the film , which focuses heavily on domestic abuse Cooper cut a relaxed figure in a black t-shirt and shorts as he headed down to Swift’s pool with the kids, rubbing shoulders with Patrick Mahomes, his wife Brittany. The youngsters giggled and laughed as they jumped into the pool – hidden from public view – as their famous parents dipped in an out of the house while soaking up the sunshine. Blake, for her part, has been slammed for using her alcohol brand to promote the film , which focuses heavily on domestic abuse, and for the way she appeared to make light of serious questions about the themes during interviews. Blake was furiously slammed online last week after a reporter asked her if people who related to what her character went through could talk to her about it if they saw her in person - and she replied with a sarcastic quip. 'If someone understands the themes of this movie and comes across you in public and they want to really talk to you, what's the best way for them to be able to talk to you about this? How would you recommend they go about it?' asked the interviewer. She sarcastically responded: 'Ask for my address or my phone number.' 'Or I could just share my location with you and then we could...,' she trailed off before laughing. The star was also blasted online after she hosted an interview with her It Ends With Us costars Jenny Slate and Isabela Ferrer, as well as author Colleen, and failed to discuss the topic. The four women giggled together as they chatted about everything from their dream jobs to their zodiac signs, but there was no mention of domestic violence during their talk. Social media users were quick to criticize them - particularly Blake, who hosted the interview - for partaking in the lighthearted questionnaire given the serious nature of the film. Several hours later, Blake took to Instagram to share information about domestic violence, as well as some resources for her followers. Amid the controversy, a journalist resurfaced an 'uncomfortable' interview that she had with Blake in 2016, which further increased the fury.

After the moment went viral, Kjersti, 51, told DailyMail.com exclusively that Blake's response was especially hurtful because she cannot conceive. Taylor was seen back in the US for the first time since finishing the European leg of her Era’s Tour, spending some quality time with her Kasnas City Chief’s beau before the NFL season started up again. The power couple have reunited for an end-of-summer getaway - this time seen today on the balcony of the singer's epic Rhode Island mansion. The $17million vacation home achieved celebrity status after it became the site of Taylor's legendary star-studded Independence Day parties. The pop superstar, however, was forced to skip the festivities this year thanks to her 51-date tour across Europe which wrapped up on Tuesday. But Taylor has returned to her iconic holiday house for the first time this summer - now with her beau in tow. And it looks like their friends and family - including Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes - joined them. Blake has also been bashed for repeatedly referring to transgender people as 'trannies' in old interviews Travis Kelce (R) and Taylor Swift (C) sit with Patrick Mahomes on the mansion's balcony The loved-up couple were seen chatting to Sterling - Patrick and Brittany's three-year-old daughter Travis' brother and sister-in-law were also in attendance. Pictured is Kylie and her daughter Swift and Kelce - pictured in March - are reunited during her tour hiatus at her famous Rhode Island mansion Locals and fans were quick to realize the pop sensation had returned after dozens of armed guards were spotted along the perimeter of the property. Taylor's security shooed fans dying for a glimpse of The Eras Tour star away, but not before they snapped a selfie on her driveway. One group even went up to the guards offering them $50 to catch a glimpse of the star and her beau. Taylor and Travis were accompanied by Patrick Mahomes and his wife Brittany, enjoying the sunshine ahead of the season - with the quarterback and tight end enduring a difficult pre-season with three straight losses. Kylie and Jason joined the all-star Chiefs line up with their children, as the latter continues to enjoy his first offseason after retirement, and ahead of his new TV role with Amazon Prime, starting next month. In 2012, Blake and Ryan Reynolds became spouses in such secrecy that their marriage stunned Hollywood Blake was previously slammed for the way she answered an interview question about domestic violence, which is heavily covered in the film Lively appeared to acknowledge the criticism Tuesday by publishing a statement to her Instagram Story along with a violence against women PSA The star, seen here appears as Lily Bloom in It Ends With Us follows Lily Bloom as she finds herself in an abusive relationship with neurosurgeon Ryle Kincaid, Justin Baldoni The presence of Brittany comes at a potentially-difficult time, just hours after she liked a Donald Trump post on social media, sparking huge backlash. While Taylor has not publicly backed either Kamala Harris or Trump ahead of November's election, she previously endorsed President Joe Biden in 2020. Fans had speculated over whether Brittany's apparent Trump endorsement might cause a rift in their friendship, but her attendance at the Rhode Island festivities appears to signal that won't be the case. Taylor seems to be letting her hair down after missing out on her annual July 4 bash because she was on tour, with sold-out dates across Europe. The lovebirds, who began dating just about a year ago, have spent much of their time jetting off to see one another amid their busy schedules since the start of their romance. The $17million vacation home achieved celebrity status after it became the site of Taylor's legendary star-studded Independence Day parties Their turn next? Patrick, Taylor and Travis crowd around Sterling on the Rhode Island balcony The trio laughed as they chatted away during their vacation ahead of the new NFL season Mahomes could later be seen holding son Bronze, one, as he checked his phone The Chiefs quarterback and wife Brittany welcomed their son back in November 2022 They have previously shacked up at each other's various pads across the country, but it is believed to be Travis's first time at his girlfriend's Watch Hill manse. As reported by DailyMail.com at the time, they spent a week together during the pop icon's last tour hiatus which coincided with the NFL off-season in March. The two enjoyed quality time together at her home base in Beverly Hills after a whirlwind few months of jet-setting and international rendezvous as a long distance couple. Swift was reported to have purchased the Colonial-style mansion, also known as High Watch, with cash back in 2013. Sitting on five acres with 11,000 square feet, eight bedrooms, 10 bathrooms, and its own private beach, the sprawling residence is the most expensive home in the state. With an expansive backyard and massive swimming pool overlooking the ocean, the pad makes for the perfect summer home. And Kelce wouldn't be the first boyfriend to visit the iconic residence. The Reputation hitmaker has been snapped over the years at the home canoodling with her former flames such as exes Calvin Harris and Tom Hiddleston. The couple are seen here seconds before sharing a kiss seemingly after Reynolds arrived at the property The Gossip Girl and her husband shared a smooch while enjoying. aSummer getaway at Swift's beach house It Ends With Us hit theatres last Friday — competing with Lively's husband Ryan Reynolds' superhero flick Deadpool & Wolverine at the box office Sitting on five acres with 11,000 square feet, eight bedrooms, 10 bathrooms and its own private beach, the sprawling residence is the most expensive home in the state The Reputation hitmaker has previously been snapped at the home over the years canoodling with her former flames such as ex Calvin Harris (pictured in 2015) In 2016, She was seen getting cozy with then-boyfriend Tom Hiddleston in a cute couples photo with best friend Blake Lively and husband Ryan Reynolds In a follow-up post on her Instagram Story, Lively shared statistics relating to domestic violence in the United States and provided fans with a link to the National Domestic Violence Hotline And now the it-couple are likely eager to soak up the last few weeks of summer together at the mansion before the NFL tight end heads back to Kansas City for the start of the season next month. Sources tell DailyMail.com Swift landed back in the US on Wednesday, while Kelce, who has been playing in pre-season games, arrived in Rhode Island on Friday. Kelce had been seen being every inch the supportive boyfriend throughout his girlfriend's European tour earlier this summer, making appearances in Dublin, Paris, London, and Amsterdam. He attended his last concert in Gelsenkirchen, Germany where he was seen hugging the popstar at the end of her set in July before reporting to Chiefs training camp in Kansas City. He later kicked off the NFL pre-season on August 8, with the team playing the Chicago Bears on Thursday. He is set to return to the field on September 5 for the first official game of the NFL season. Rumors of tensions brewing between Justin Baldoni - who on top of starring in it also directed and served as one of the producers for the film - and Lively have been swirling for weeks A source told DailyMail.com recently that Blake and Justin allegedly clashed over his 'dismissive' attitude to her 'input' while they were filming scenes that involved abuse The NFL player became a regular fixture at his girlfriend's European concerts over the summer, and was seen hugging the pop star at the end of her show in Germany in July - his last before reporting back to training camp in Kansas City Kelce had continued his tour of Europe by flying to Amsterdam to watch Taylor Swift Travis Kelce stunned the crowd at Wembley by appearing on stage with girlfriend Taylor Swift in June Taylor, meanwhile, will enjoy a nice two-month break before embarking on the last leg of her Eras Tour in Miami in mid-October. And it is likely she will return the favor and support her man at his games during her hiatus. While he may have been busy training for another exciting run on the field, he still has time for romantic gestures. Earlier this week the football star was reported to have splashed out over $30,000 on flowers for Taylor to congratulate her on the end of the European leg of her Eras Tour. According to The Sun, Kelce ordered a huge 51 boxes of red roses that greeted his girlfriend when she returned to the US. He later kicked off the NFL pre-season on August 8, with the team playing the Chicago Bears on Thursday It is likely Taylor will return the favor and support her man at his games during her tour hiatus from now to October The singer returned to London's Wembley Stadium for five performances of her smash-hit tour following the cancellation of shows in Vienna, when a planned terrorist attack was foiled by authorities. Swift now has no shows on her schedule until the Eras Tour, which has surpassed $1billion in revenue, returns to the United States in October and ends in Canada in December. A report emerged last week that said Kelce and Swift have found ways to 'prioritize' each other despite their hectic schedules and being in different countries for a lot of their relationship. 'Taylor and Travis always prioritize each other even when they are physically apart. They are still in constant communication texting and FaceTiming each other,' per ET. Swift and Kelce are 'very affectionate with each other even when they're apart,' added ET, with the Chief showing his affection for the 'Anti-Hero' singer through lavish gifts.

The actress has been left ‘fearing’ for her career, and appears to be lying low with her popstar bestie at her $17m home in Rhode Island, with a host of other Hollywood pals. Images obtained by DailyMail.com show Lively with her arms around husband Ryan, who donned a cap and a backpack, seemingly welcoming the Deadpool actor to the bash. The blonde was seen frowning into the sunshine, dressed in floral shorts and a coral bikini top, with her long tresses up in a bun – looking relieved at the arrival of her husband. Blake isn’t the only member of Taylor’s Girl Squad in attendance, with sources telling DailyMail.com that Gigi Hadid also celebrated the stars Era’s Tour success, with her beau Bradley Cooper and his daughter. Cooper cut a relaxed figure in a black t-shirt and shorts as he headed down to Swift’s pool with the kids, rubbing shoulders with Patrick Mahomes, his wife Brittany. The youngsters giggled and laughed as they jumped into the pool – hidden from public view – as their famous parents dipped in an out of the house while soaking up the sunshine. Blake, for her part, has been slammed for using her alcohol brand to promote the film , which focuses heavily on domestic abuse, and for the way she appeared to make light of serious questions about the themes during interviews. Blake was furiously slammed online last week after a reporter asked her if people who related to what her character went through could talk to her about it if they saw her in person – and she replied with a sarcastic quip. ‘If someone understands the themes of this movie and comes across you in public and they want to really talk to you, what’s the best way for them to be able to talk to you about this? How would you recommend they go about it?’ asked the interviewer. She sarcastically responded: ‘Ask for my address or my phone number.’ ‘Or I could just share my location with you and then we could…,’ she trailed off before laughing. The star was also blasted online after she hosted an interview with her It Ends With Us costars Jenny Slate and Isabela Ferrer, as well as author Colleen, and failed to discuss the topic. The four women giggled together as they chatted about everything from their dream jobs to their zodiac signs, but there was no mention of domestic violence during their talk. Social media users were quick to criticize them – particularly Blake, who hosted the interview – for partaking in the lighthearted questionnaire given the serious nature of the film. Several hours later, Blake took to Instagram to share information about domestic violence, as well as some resources for her followers. Amid the controversy, a journalist resurfaced an ‘uncomfortable’ interview that she had with Blake in 2016, which further increased the fury. During the sit-down, the actress made a snarky comment about Norwegian reporter Kjersti Flaa’s ‘bump’ after she had congratulated a then-pregnant Blake on her impending arrival – but the journalist was not pregnant. After the moment went viral, Kjersti, 51, told DailyMail.com exclusively that Blake’s response was especially hurtful because she cannot conceive. Taylor was seen back in the US for the first time since finishing the European leg of her Era’s Tour, spending some quality time with her Kasnas City Chief’s beau before the NFL season started up again. The power couple have reunited for an end-of-summer getaway – this time seen today on the balcony of the singer’s epic Rhode Island mansion. The $17million vacation home achieved celebrity status after it became the site of Taylor’s legendary star-studded Independence Day parties. The pop superstar, however, was forced to skip the festivities this year thanks to her 51-date tour across Europe which wrapped up on Tuesday. But Taylor has returned to her iconic holiday house for the first time this summer – now with her beau in tow. And it looks like their friends and family – including Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes – joined them. Locals and fans were quick to realize the pop sensation had returned after dozens of armed guards were spotted along the perimeter of the property. Taylor’s security shooed fans dying for a glimpse of The Eras Tour star away, but not before they snapped a selfie on her driveway. One group even went up to the guards offering them $50 to catch a glimpse of the star and her beau. Taylor and Travis were accompanied by Patrick Mahomes and his wife Brittany, enjoying the sunshine ahead of the season – with the quarterback and tight end enduring a difficult pre-season with three straight losses. Kylie and Jason joined the all-star Chiefs line up with their children, as the latter continues to enjoy his first offseason after retirement, and ahead of his new TV role with Amazon Prime, starting next month. The presence of Brittany comes at a potentially-difficult time, just hours after she liked a Donald Trump post on social media, sparking huge backlash. While Taylor has not publicly backed either Kamala Harris or Trump ahead of November’s election, she previously endorsed President Joe Biden in 2020. Fans had speculated over whether Brittany’s apparent Trump endorsement might cause a rift in their friendship, but her attendance at the Rhode Island festivities appears to signal that won’t be the case. Taylor seems to be letting her hair down after missing out on her annual July 4 bash because she was on tour, with sold-out dates across Europe. The lovebirds, who began dating just about a year ago, have spent much of their time jetting off to see one another amid their busy schedules since the start of their romance. They have previously shacked up at each other’s various pads across the country, but it is believed to be Travis’s first time at his girlfriend’s Watch Hill manse. As reported by DailyMail.com at the time, they spent a week together during the pop icon’s last tour hiatus which coincided with the NFL off-season in March. The two enjoyed quality time together at her home base in Beverly Hills after a whirlwind few months of jet-setting and international rendezvous as a long distance couple. Swift was reported to have purchased the Colonial-style mansion, also known as High Watch, with cash back in 2013. Sitting on five acres with 11,000 square feet, eight bedrooms, 10 bathrooms, and its own private beach, the sprawling residence is the most expensive home in the state. With an expansive backyard and massive swimming pool overlooking the ocean, the pad makes for the perfect summer home. And Kelce wouldn’t be the first boyfriend to visit the iconic residence. The Reputation hitmaker has been snapped over the years at the home canoodling with her former flames such as exes Calvin Harris and Tom Hiddleston. And now the it-couple are likely eager to soak up the last few weeks of summer together at the mansion before the NFL tight end heads back to Kansas City for the start of the season next month. Sources tell DailyMail.com Swift landed back in the US on Wednesday, while Kelce, who has been playing in pre-season games, arrived in Rhode Island on Friday. Kelce had been seen being every inch the supportive boyfriend throughout his girlfriend’s European tour earlier this summer, making appearances in Dublin, Paris, London, and Amsterdam. He attended his last concert in Gelsenkirchen, Germany where he was seen hugging the popstar at the end of her set in July before reporting to Chiefs training camp in Kansas City. He later kicked off the NFL pre-season on August 8, with the team playing the Chicago Bears on Thursday. He is set to return to the field on September 5 for the first official game of the NFL season. Taylor, meanwhile, will enjoy a nice two-month break before embarking on the last leg of her Eras Tour in Miami in mid-October. And it is likely she will return the favor and support her man at his games during her hiatus. While he may have been busy training for another exciting run on the field, he still has time for romantic gestures. Earlier this week the football star was reported to have splashed out over $30,000 on flowers for Taylor to congratulate her on the end of the European leg of her Eras Tour. According to The Sun, Kelce ordered a huge 51 boxes of red roses that greeted his girlfriend when she returned to the US. The singer returned to London’s Wembley Stadium for five performances of her smash-hit tour following the cancellation of shows in Vienna, when a planned terrorist attack was foiled by authorities. Swift now has no shows on her schedule until the Eras Tour, which has surpassed $1billion in revenue, returns to the United States in October and ends in Canada in December. A report emerged last week that said Kelce and Swift have found ways to ‘prioritize’ each other despite their hectic schedules and being in different countries for a lot of their relationship. ‘Taylor and Travis always prioritize each other even when they are physically apart. They are still in constant communication texting and FaceTiming each other,’ per ET. Swift and Kelce are ‘very affectionate with each other even when they’re apart,’ added ET, with the Chief showing his affection for the ‘Anti-Hero’ singer through lavish gifts.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nBlake Lively broke cover for the first time amid the ongoing It&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Blake Lively seen in public for the first time after It Ends with Us controversy, holding onto husband Ryan Reynolds at Taylor Swift&#8217;s star-studded home first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/news/blake-lively-seen-in-public-for-the-first-time-after-it-ends-with-us-controversy-holding-onto-husband-ryan-reynolds-at-taylor-swifts-star-studded-home/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/1724545146_rewrite-this-title-Blake-Lively-breaks-cover-for-the-first.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-08-25 00:22:08","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.255},{"id":254856766,"title":"Trump Struggles To Keep Media Spotlight In Battle With Kamala Harris","text":"Donald Trump, touting plans on taxes and health, tried on Friday to turn the page on a week in which he was overshadowed by Kamala Harris and struggled to focus on policy issues instead of personal attacks on his opponent in the US presidential race. From a lectern at a Mexican restaurant in Las Vegas, the Republican candidate spoke about his plan to eliminate taxes on tips to waiters and other service employees. He discussed his campaign's efforts to court Hispanic voters in Nevada, a battleground state that could help determine the Nov. 5 election, and nationwide. The tax proposal, a pillar of Trump's economic agenda, is the kind of issue his advisers have been pressing him to focus on, rather than his frequent personal attacks against Vice President Kamala Harris' looks, Black and Indian heritage and intelligence, warning they could turn off the moderate voters he needs to win. At an event in Arizona later, the former president repeated his tax pledge, while promising to set up a commission to investigate presidential assassination attempts. He also said he would install a panel to investigate \"an increase in chronic health problems and childhood diseases.\" Both proposals are apparent concessions to independent presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who endorsed Trump at the event after dropping out of the race. Trump's comments come one day after Kamala Harris accepted the Democratic Party's presidential nomination with a muscular speech that laid down broad foreign policy principles and sharp contrasts with Trump with 11 weeks left until Election Day. Trump sought to counter-program the four-day convention with events of his own around the country, hoping to steal some media attention from Kamala Harris. However, his speeches on foreign policy, the economy and crime did little to dislodge the spotlight from Kamala Harris and received little attention - a stunning turnabout for a politician used to dominating headlines. The Republican and his aides hope Thursday's boisterous convention finale marks the end of the honeymoon period for Kamala Harris, who emerged as the Democratic candidate little more than a month ago, after President Joe Biden exited the race and endorsed her. During Kamala Harris' acceptance speech in Chicago, Trump attacked her with dozens of posts on his Truth Social platform, calling her a liar, a Marxist and \"Comrade Kamala Harris.\" One post simply asked: \"IS SHE TALKING ABOUT ME?\" William Rosenberg, a political science professor at Drexel University, said Trump's personal attacks on Kamala Harris underscored his frustration with having to face a biracial woman, a task complicated by his history of making racist remarks. \"His anger and his words speak volumes,\" Rosenberg said. \"He's navigating a path which is full of problems for him.\" Kamala Harris has surged in the polls since entering the race, with polling aggregator website FiveThirtyEight putting her ahead of Trump in six of seven battleground states. She is also outraising her Republican counterpart. Her campaign told the Federal Election Commission this week that it raised $204 million last month, compared to $48 million reported to the body by Trump's main fundraising group. One question still to be answered is whether Kamala Harris will also outpace Trump on the trail in the coming weeks. Biden, 81, made relatively few campaign stops, easing pressure on Trump to travel more around the country. That may now change with Harris, 59. Trump, 78, will travel to Detroit on Monday to address a conference of the National Guard Association of the United States and is scheduled to give a speech at a conservative women's group's annual summit in Washington on Friday. Campaign spokesperson Karoline Leavitt said Trump would hold at least one additional campaign stop between those two events, without providing details. The Kamala Harris campaign has not yet released details of her movements for next week. Leavitt blamed the media for focusing their stories on Trump's personal attacks, which she said made up a fraction of his otherwise policy-heavy rallies and speeches. At a speech event on Wednesday in Asheboro, North Carolina, billed as one on national security, Trump said he had rejected the recommendations of his advisers to focus on policy, and he insulted Kamala Harris and other Democrats in personal terms. He again recounted those conversations with advisers at the rally in Arizona on Friday. \"My geniuses, they get paid a fortune - actually not that much - but I call up my people, I say, 'They're knocking the hell out of me, and you say I shouldn't get personal. I have to get personal, don't I?'\" Trump said to applause. An outside adviser to Trump told Reuters on condition of anonymity that several advisers had told the former president that a continued focus on insults rather than policy could doom his chances in November. Republican strategist Doug Heye said Trump could still win the race, which he predicted would be close, but to do that he should focus on inflation, illegal immigration and other issues that polling show many voters give him higher marks on.

He cohosted the film’s premiere in Miami, Florida, on Tuesday night. City of Dreams, which shares producers with the 2023 film Sound of Freedom, follows the story of a migrant boy named Jesús, who dreams of becoming a soccer star and is trafficked into the United States only to be thrust into a world of underground child slavery. But Jesús fights back against his captors in the film, which is inspired by true events and has drawn praise from Hollywood legends like Martin Sheen and Sylvester Stallone. – News caught up with Ramaswamy Thursday afternoon at the Trump International Hotel and Tower in Chicago for an exclusive on-camera interview about the Roadside Attractions film, as well as the Democratic National Convention. “We’re having this conversation right now as the inspector general report for the Department of Homeland Security reveals that there are now hundreds of thousands more — 320,000 more children than were previously thought to be the number who they have completely lost track of in our country,” Ramaswamy told – News. “We’re taught to believe that slavery ended in the United States in the 1860s. Not quite, actually,” he continued. “It exists today, but in a new dark form of this child slavery and child trafficking that’s a direct consequence of our failed border policies.” Ramaswamy was a staunch advocate for border reforms and security throughout his bid for the Republican presidential nomination in 2023 and into January 2024. He emphasized to – News that Americans cannot be reached solely through politics on this issue. “So one of the reasons I became involved in this film is, A: It’s just a good movie. I think the reality is people say they want to be educated, and people do want to be educated, but you’ve got to be entertaining about it as well, in a heartfelt way that reaches people, not just in their brain, but in their gut and in their heart,” he emphasized. “And so that’s what this movie does.” Tuesday’s debut in Miami was co-hosted by Ramaswamy and author and self-help guru Tony Robbins, who is also an executive producer of the film, which transcends political lines. Over 12 MILLION children are trapped in modern slavery today. @cityofdreamsmov is more than just a film—it’s a call to action.Inspired by true events, this powerful story follows Jesús, a young boy with dreams of becoming a soccer star, whose life is shattered when he’s… pic.twitter.com/l2NhjjA8uG— Tony Robbins (@TonyRobbins) August 23, 2024 “I was glad to be, proud to be an executive producer of it at the first-ever premiere in Miami, and the beautiful thing about it is it wasn’t a political event, actually,” he detailed. “Tony Robbins, another executive producer, I was sitting next to him watching the movie, and you know, both of us might be reluctant to admit it, but we were in tears by the end of it. And speaking, just as a parent of two sons, to watch what this young man went through and to know that there are hundreds of thousands more like him, not halfway around the world in some other hemisphere, but right here in the United States of America, is something that opened my eyes. And I hope it opens other people’s eyes too, Republican and Democrat alike.” “Half the people in that room, at least half the people in that room, were Democrats,” Ramaswamy continued. “But the fact that we were able to have a conversation, even after that movie, about how this is wrong, regardless of what side of the political aisle you are, is something that I hope unites us. The reality is, today, you have two sets of policies to choose from, and I’m on the side I am because I believe Donald Trump’s going to be the guy who actually seals the border and ends this crisis. But it’s also important for Americans to be able to learn about it outside of the realm of politics as well, so that’s why I was proud to play a small role in bringing this to, hopefully, the American public.” The film debuts on August 30, and the timing of its Labor Day weekend release is purposeful, Ramaswamy highlighted. – News founder Andrew – famously said that “politics is downstream from culture.” When asked how important it is to build infrastructures outside of traditional Hollywood to highlight stories like these, Ramaswamy said it is “vital to the future of the country.” “The first and most important problem is we’ve got to fix the federal government and then fix governments across the board to set the right policies. But if we’re going to regain our country and our culture, I think Andrew – had it right. It’s going to have to come through reforms of the media, reforms of popular culture,” the 39-year-old, who was the youngest ever GOP presidential candidate, emphasized. “I recently became the second largest shareholder of a media company out there and pushing for not conservative change, but change of a kind that I think adds diversity of thought to an economy,” he added, referring to Buzzfeed. “I think it’s going to require change through capitalism as well. I was a co-founder of Strive, which is a competitor to Blackrock, State Street, and Vanguard in the marketplace for capital. It’s part of why I became executive producer of this film, City of Dreams, that’s outside of the realm of politics but educates people about one of the greatest travesties in modern America.” “So, do we need to fix our institutions through government? Yes, we do, but do we also need to fight the battle through the economy and through our culture, not just to push for conservative goals but for a pro-American vision? Yes, I think we do,” Ramaswamy continued. “I think, in some ways, that’s where we see the biggest deficit. So, since I’ve left the presidential campaign, I’ve looked at wearing a lot of those hats as well. It’s been fun, but it’s also, I think, productive because we need people who are driven and have the talents and the resources to make a difference outside of politics, to continue doing that, and that’s part of why I’ve been involved in some of the projects I’ve been, you know, spawning in the last year.”","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nCHICAGO, ILLINOIS–Vivek Ramaswamy, a 2024 Republican presidential candidate and executive producer of&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Vivek Ramaswamy Shares Reasons for Joining &#8216;City of Dreams&#8217; Movie about Child Labor in an Exclusive Interview. first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/news/vivek-ramaswamy-shares-reasons-for-joining-city-of-dreams-movie-about-child-labor-in-an-exclusive-interview/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/ic_launcher.png","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-08-24 23:55:20","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.382},{"id":254855926,"title":"Blake Lively emerges publicly for the first time following drama surrounding “It Ends with Us”, seen with husband Ryan Reynolds at Taylor Swift’s star-studded residence","text":"Blake Lively broke cover for the first time amid the ongoing It Ends With Us drama and looked stressed as she hugged and kissed her husband Ryan Reynolds during an A-List pool party at Taylor Swift’s lavish mansion, DailyMail.com can reveal. The actress has been left ‘fearing’ for her career, and appears to be lying low with her popstar bestie at her $17m home in Rhode Island, with a host of other Hollywood pals. Exclusive DailyMail.com pictures show Lively with her arms around husband Ryan, who donned a cap and a backpack, seemingly welcoming the Deadpool actor to the bash. The blonde was seen frowning into the sunshine, dressed in floral shorts and a coral bikini top, with her long tresses up in a bun – looking relieved at the arrival of her husband. Blake isn’t the only member of Taylor’s Girl Squad in attendance, with sources telling DailyMail.com that Gigi Hadid also celebrated the stars Era’s Tour success, with her beau Bradley Cooper and his daughter. Cooper cut a relaxed figure in a black t-shirt and shorts as he headed down to Swift’s pool with the kids, rubbing shoulders with Patrick Mahomes, his wife Brittany. The youngsters giggled and laughed as they jumped into the pool – hidden from public view – as their famous parents dipped in an out of the house while soaking up the sunshine. Blake, for her part, has been slammed for using her alcohol brand to promote the film , which focuses heavily on domestic abuse, and for the way she appeared to make light of serious questions about the themes during interviews. Blake was furiously slammed online last week after a reporter asked her if people who related to what her character went through could talk to her about it if they saw her in person – and she replied with a sarcastic quip. ‘If someone understands the themes of this movie and comes across you in public and they want to really talk to you, what’s the best way for them to be able to talk to you about this? How would you recommend they go about it?’ asked the interviewer. She sarcastically responded: ‘Ask for my address or my phone number.’ ‘Or I could just share my location with you and then we could…,’ she trailed off before laughing. The star was also blasted online after she hosted an interview with her It Ends With Us costars Jenny Slate and Isabela Ferrer, as well as author Colleen, and failed to discuss the topic. The four women giggled together as they chatted about everything from their dream jobs to their zodiac signs, but there was no mention of domestic violence during their talk. Social media users were quick to criticize them – particularly Blake, who hosted the interview – for partaking in the lighthearted questionnaire given the serious nature of the film. Several hours later, Blake took to Instagram to share information about domestic violence, as well as some resources for her followers. Amid the controversy, a journalist resurfaced an ‘uncomfortable’ interview that she had with Blake in 2016, which further increased the fury. During the sit-down, the actress made a snarky comment about Norwegian reporter Kjersti Flaa’s ‘bump’ after she had congratulated a then-pregnant Blake on her impending arrival – but the journalist was not pregnant. After the moment went viral, Kjersti, 51, told DailyMail.com exclusively that Blake’s response was especially hurtful because she cannot conceive. Taylor was seen back in the US for the first time since finishing the European leg of her Era’s Tour, spending some quality time with her Kasnas City Chief’s beau before the NFL season started up again. The power couple have reunited for an end-of-summer getaway – this time seen today on the balcony of the singer’s epic Rhode Island mansion. The $17million vacation home achieved celebrity status after it became the site of Taylor’s legendary star-studded Independence Day parties. The pop superstar, however, was forced to skip the festivities this year thanks to her 51-date tour across Europe which wrapped up on Tuesday. But Taylor has returned to her iconic holiday house for the first time this summer – now with her beau in tow. And it looks like their friends and family – including Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes – joined them. Locals and fans were quick to realize the pop sensation had returned after dozens of armed guards were spotted along the perimeter of the property. Taylor’s security shooed fans dying for a glimpse of The Eras Tour star away, but not before they snapped a selfie on her driveway. One group even went up to the guards offering them $50 to catch a glimpse of the star and her beau. Taylor and Travis were accompanied by Patrick Mahomes and his wife Brittany, enjoying the sunshine ahead of the season – with the quarterback and tight end enduring a difficult pre-season with three straight losses. Kylie and Jason joined the all-star Chiefs line up with their children, as the latter continues to enjoy his first offseason after retirement, and ahead of his new TV role with Amazon Prime, starting next month. The presence of Brittany comes at a potentially-difficult time, just hours after she liked a Donald Trump post on social media, sparking huge backlash. While Taylor has not publicly backed either Kamala Harris or Trump ahead of November’s election, she previously endorsed President Joe Biden in 2020. Fans had speculated over whether Brittany’s apparent Trump endorsement might cause a rift in their friendship, but her attendance at the Rhode Island festivities appears to signal that won’t be the case. Taylor seems to be letting her hair down after missing out on her annual July 4 bash because she was on tour, with sold-out dates across Europe. The lovebirds, who began dating just about a year ago, have spent much of their time jetting off to see one another amid their busy schedules since the start of their romance. They have previously shacked up at each other’s various pads across the country, but it is believed to be Travis’s first time at his girlfriend’s Watch Hill manse. As reported by DailyMail.com at the time, they spent a week together during the pop icon’s last tour hiatus which coincided with the NFL off-season in March. The two enjoyed quality time together at her home base in Beverly Hills after a whirlwind few months of jet-setting and international rendezvous as a long distance couple. Swift was reported to have purchased the Colonial-style mansion, also known as High Watch, with cash back in 2013. Sitting on five acres with 11,000 square feet, eight bedrooms, 10 bathrooms, and its own private beach, the sprawling residence is the most expensive home in the state. With an expansive backyard and massive swimming pool overlooking the ocean, the pad makes for the perfect summer home. And Kelce wouldn’t be the first boyfriend to visit the iconic residence. The Reputation hitmaker has been snapped over the years at the home canoodling with her former flames such as exes Calvin Harris and Tom Hiddleston. And now the it-couple are likely eager to soak up the last few weeks of summer together at the mansion before the NFL tight end heads back to Kansas City for the start of the season next month. Sources tell DailyMail.com Swift landed back in the US on Wednesday, while Kelce, who has been playing in pre-season games, arrived in Rhode Island on Friday. Kelce had been seen being every inch the supportive boyfriend throughout his girlfriend’s European tour earlier this summer, making appearances in Dublin, Paris, London, and Amsterdam. He attended his last concert in Gelsenkirchen, Germany where he was seen hugging the popstar at the end of her set in July before reporting to Chiefs training camp in Kansas City. He later kicked off the NFL pre-season on August 8, with the team playing the Chicago Bears on Thursday. He is set to return to the field on September 5 for the first official game of the NFL season. Taylor, meanwhile, will enjoy a nice two-month break before embarking on the last leg of her Eras Tour in Miami in mid-October. And it is likely she will return the favor and support her man at his games during her hiatus. While he may have been busy training for another exciting run on the field, he still has time for romantic gestures. Earlier this week the football star was reported to have splashed out over $30,000 on flowers for Taylor to congratulate her on the end of the European leg of her Eras Tour. According to The Sun, Kelce ordered a huge 51 boxes of red roses that greeted his girlfriend when she returned to the US. The singer returned to London’s Wembley Stadium for five performances of her smash-hit tour following the cancellation of shows in Vienna, when a planned terrorist attack was foiled by authorities. Swift now has no shows on her schedule until the Eras Tour, which has surpassed $1billion in revenue, returns to the United States in October and ends in Canada in December. A report emerged last week that said Kelce and Swift have found ways to ‘prioritize’ each other despite their hectic schedules and being in different countries for a lot of their relationship. ‘Taylor and Travis always prioritize each other even when they are physically apart. They are still in constant communication texting and FaceTiming each other,’ per ET. Swift and Kelce are ‘very affectionate with each other even when they’re apart,’ added ET, with the Chief showing his affection for the ‘Anti-Hero’ singer through lavish gifts.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nBlake Lively broke cover for the first time amid the ongoing It&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Blake Lively emerges publicly for the first time following drama surrounding &#8220;It Ends with Us&#8221;, seen with husband Ryan Reynolds at Taylor Swift&#8217;s star-studded residence first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/news/us/blake-lively-emerges-publicly-for-the-first-time-following-drama-surrounding-it-ends-with-us-seen-with-husband-ryan-reynolds-at-taylor-swifts-star-studded-residence/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/rewrite-this-title-Blake-Lively-breaks-cover-for-the-first.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-08-24 23:48:13","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.251},{"id":254856632,"title":"Martine McCutcheon admits anxiety made her a 'recluse' as she candidly discusses her struggles amid split from husband Jack McManus","text":"Home News Royals U.S. Sport TV Showbiz Femail Health Science Money Travel Podcasts Shopping Best Buys Discounts My Profile Logout Login Headlines Showbiz Kim Kardashian Victoria Beckham Harry Styles Amanda Holden Britain's Got Talent My Profile Logout Login Privacy Policy Feedback Sunday, Aug 25th 2024 1AM 20°C 4AM 17°C 5-Day Forecast Advertisement Kirstie Allsopp's fury as she is referred to social services and contacted by a social worker after allowing her 15-year-old son to go on an interrailing trip with friend 'I am the one you are looking for': Syrian suspect, 26, hands himself in to German police after 'hiding in a backyard' since terror attack which saw three killed - after earlier raid on refugee shelter saw different man detained Ageing sex bombs at war!

This week, the actress, 48, revealed that Jack, 40, had left her after 18 years together - days after she wrote a heartfelt birthday tribute for him. She has now recalled feeling as if she was 'losing her mind' as she was overcome by 'huge fear' while dealing with perimenopause symptoms. Speaking in an interview with BBC Radio 4's Woman’s Hour, Martine revealed: I didn’t want to answer my phone. I didn’t want to answer the front door, go outside and I would panic out of nowhere and have to pull over when I was driving because I felt this huge fear and couldn’t breathe. 'I genuinely felt I was losing my mind. I didn’t know if I really was or if it was something that was perimenopausal.' Martine McCutcheon has admitted anxiety made her a 'recluse' as she candidly discussed her struggles after her split from husband Jack McManus This week, the actress, 48, revealed that Jack, 40, had left her after 18 years together - days after she wrote a heartfelt birthday tribute for him. She added: 'It would just come on out of nowhere and when I spoke to my specialist about it she said, \"You know this is sadly the case for many women\".' Martine is now on holiday in Marbella with the couple's son Rafferty, 9, while her ex is staying in their £1.5million house in Surrey. On Friday, Martine appeared to make a cryptic dig at Jack when she reposted a video from author Alex Elle. In the video, Alex says: 'The older I get, the less time I have for people who are unsure about me. 'I need people in my life who are certain. People who want to be there. People who make space for me.' Sharing the video to her Story, Martine wrote: 'I love this lady. @alex_elle soothing, gentle, voice, softly reminding us of our own strength, value, love and true worth.' Announcing their split, she wrote in a statement: 'After much thought and consideration, Jack has decided it's best for us to separate after 18 years together and I accept his decision.' 'We are both so very blessed and grateful for our beautiful, 9 year old son Rafferty, who's happiness and welfare, has always been, and will continue to be, our number 1 priority.'

'Whilst this decision has evolved over a period of time, we are still finding our new way forward as a family and kindly ask for some privacy at this time... Especially for our little boy. 'Our love for Rafferty, is something that will never, waver, or change and we obviously want to protect him and help him feel as safe and secure as possible. 'Many thanks in advance for your respect and support, at this difficult time...And I continue to send Jack, all the love, luck and happiness for the next chapter of his. 'Rafferty and I (as always,) are rooting for you! 'Thank you all, for the love and support, now and always...Martine.xx.'

And, once again, shareholders got an unsatisfactory explanation. Add in the major selling risk 4-weeks ahead, and it’s time to sell. The latest costly mistake From Friday's (August 23) SEC Form 8-K filing: \"Effective August 22, 2024, the Board and the audit committee of Trump Media & Technology Group Corp. (the \"Company” or \"TMTG”) authorized a share repurchase of an aggregate of 128,138 shares of the Company’s common stock from certain executive employees at a prevailing market price of $22.70 per share. As consideration for the repurchase, the Company will remit $2,908,708, plus applicable penalties and interest, to the U.S. Internal Revenue Service and certain state taxing authorities in connection with the March 7, 2024, issuance of the TMTG Executive Promissory Notes.\" Okay, let's identify the blanks and, where possible, determine what happened... What is the large $2.9 million IRS payment for? Taxes? A fine? And how much do those undisclosed \"applicable penalties and interest\" add to the bill? Penalties can be large, so shareholders should know. What lead to the IRS payment? \"In connection with the March 7, 2024, issuance of the TMTG Executive Promissory Notes\" is an incomplete reason. What went wrong? What we know is that Donald Trump wanted to reward the executives with promissory notes, not cash, that would convert to shares when the merger completed. That happened. Who recommended to the Board and audit committee that they authorize a share repurchase? And why did shares have to be repurchased? Why were \"certain executive employees\" singled out? Share repurchases are normally done in the open market to get the lowest price. All the executives’ shares are subject to the lock-up period that ends in September, so how were their shares made salable now? The table below lists the five executives, and the Trump Media repurchases. Note that 18.6% of their total holdings as a group were repurchased. Also note that CEO Devin Nunes and General Counsel Glabe Scott had larger proportions of their shares repurchased with no explanation - punishment? Trump Media executive repurchases John Tobey The Company's $2.9 million payment to the IRS is the identical value of the shares repurchased at $22.70. So, the company paid $2.9M to the IRS and $2.9M to the selling executives? Probably not. There is a confused phrase, \"as consideration for the repurchase.\" Does that mean the board and audit committee (and likely controlling shareholder Donald Trump) decided the executives should transfer their repurchase proceeds back to Trump Media to cover the IRS payment? Read More: Trump Media Stock (DJT) - Significant Risks Are At Hand All of the questions should be answered so shareholders (owners) understand what is happening with their investment. Then, there are the lawsuits... Within this SEC filing is a list of lawsuit updates. It is important to remember that most of the Trump Media lawsuits are against the originators of the Trump Media idea, the originators of the Digital World Acquisition SPAC that merged into Trump Media, the financial supporter of Digital World, and the key service provider. In other words, Trump Media now has disagreements with the people and organizations that helped provide Trump Media with critical cash and the way to become a public company. And these shareholders are part of the large locked-up group. And that brings up the key reason for selling now The four-week countdown has begun to the huge unlocking of DJT shares. While Donald Trump owns many of those currently locked-up shares, a significant portion of the rest is held by parties that did not choose to invest in Trump Media. There are lenders whose repayments were shares, service providers paid in shares, and others who acquired free or low-cost Digital World shares. And some shareholders are parties to the lawsuits. Therefore, there is a high probability that many locked-up shareholders are looking forward to finally cashing out, especially with the stock's poor performance. And that reality means shareholders who can sell now should consider it. They have a unique advantage that will disappear overnight in four weeks. The daily countdown John Tobey But won't selling harm Donald Trump? No. He has taken care of himself. Also, any price drop caused by shareholder selling now will likely be small compared to what happens in four weeks. In fact, the combination of the poor 2nd quarter earnings report and the approaching unlocking will keep most potential investors on the sidelines. That means for the next four weeks, expect price volatility to be high as day traders attempt to outsmart one another. Consider this strategy... Sell now to create a cash reserve. Then, watch what happens when the millions of DJT shares become salable. Whether the selling effect is minor, sizable, or major, the price likely will decline. If it reaches $17.50 (January's starting level), there could be additional selling because all the pre-merger and post-merger excitement and expectations will wash out. And that is not all that is going to happen. Two major events could affect the stock: First, the November 5 presidential election. Will Trump win or lose? Second, in mid-November the 3rd quarter Trump Media earnings report will be released. Will it show a positive turnabout, or will it confirm another big loss and negative growth? At that point, you can decide whether you want to get back in. As to Trump, he will be doing what benefits him (and that could be selling his unlocked shares to raise money for some new venture). DJT year-to-date, daily closes through Aug. 23, with three major items ahead John Tobey (StockCharts.com) The bottom line - Successful investing comes from timely actions Waiting for the dust to settle or the price to rebound is a common cause of investment losses. Better to act when the time is right. And remember - when you hold cash, you can relax and choose when to jump back in - or not.","summary":"Trump Media stumbled again","url":"https://www.forbes.com/sites/johntobey/2024/08/24/trump-media-stock-djtits-time-to-sell/","image":"https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/66ca5b53bf5ad5ffe81d2c6f/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-08-24 23:39:26","author":"Contributor,John S.

On Saturday, Aug. 24, a spokesperson for the 83-year-old former director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases told The Washington Post that he was hospitalized but is now recovering at home. “A full recovery is expected,” the spokesperson said in a statement. The Post reported that an insider close to Fauci said that he is unsure of how he contracted the virus and that he was hospitalized for six days. Dr. Jonathan LaPook, CBS News’ chief medical correspondent, posted on X that he had spoken with Fauci, who told him he was hospitalized about 10 days ago and he had developed \"fever, chills and severe fatigue.\" \"Evaluation revealed that he had been infected with the West Nile virus, likely from a mosquito bite that he got in his backyard,” LaPook wrote. “He left the hospital three days ago and is recovering at home.” LaPook also said, “The prognosis is for a full recovery.\" West Nile virus is often spread through the bite of an infected mosquito (or sometimes birds), according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). It can be found in the U.S. as well as in other parts of the world. Symptoms of the virus can include developing a fever, headache, body aches, vomiting, diarrhea or rashes. Although there is no vaccine for West Nile virus, the CDC says that people can avoid contracting the disease by using bug spray, wearing long sleeves or pants if they know they'll be around mosquitos and taking steps to prevent mosquitos from getting indoors. Fauci served in the NIH for more than four decades, advising to help create public policy to deal with HIV/AIDS, SARS, MERS, avian influenza, swine flu, Zika and Ebola. Throughout his career, he was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the National Medal of Science, the Mary Woodard Lasker Award for Public Service and 62 honorary doctoral degrees. He gained notoriety in 2020 for his work advising the public and then-president Donald Trump during the COVID-19 pandemic. He retired in 2023, and PEOPLE reported that he now serves as a Distinguished University Professor at Georgetown University with a joint appointment in the School of Medicine and the McCourt School of Public Policy. Speaking with PEOPLE in July about his new memoir, On Call: A Doctor's Journey in Public Service, he opened up about what he learned over his decades-long career, as well as the American public's changing attitudes about science and public health. “I'm not naive,” he told PEOPLE at the time. “I'm aware of the destructive nature of the anti-science attitude that has been accelerating in society over the past several years.” He added that the problem “didn’t start with the Trump administration,” even if it was “given a big jumpstart with the Trump administration.” Never miss a story — sign up for PEOPLE's free daily newsletter to stay up-to-date on the best of what PEOPLE has to offer​​, from celebrity news to compelling human interest stories. “I still feel as somewhat of a cautious optimist that there are the better angels in everybody that will come out,” he explained. “And if people start to really realize that we're much more the same than we are different, we will get away from … that vitriol and that hatred because that's untenable,” Fauci added. “And even if you are on that camp of being vitriolic, deep down, you gotta realize that that's not a solution.

(AP) — The race among Republicans for Michigan’s state Supreme Court, already shaken up by attorney Matthew DePerno ‘s decision to drop out, got a further jolt during Saturday’s nominating convention when the former party chairperson was escorted out of the arena. Kristina Karamo, who was ousted as chairperson in January after less than a year, was told she was not a delegate and two police officers led her out, the Detroit News reported. DePerno said in a Friday night statement that his decision was based on how he could best help former President Donald Trump win Michigan and reclaim the White House. It came just hours before both Republicans and Democrats gathered to choose nominees for two available seats on the court with majority control at stake. DePerno, who rose to prominence repeating false claims about the 2020 election and faces felony charges of trying to illegally access and tamper with voting machines, said he talked to Trump this week and decided he could do more to help Trump win by bolstering the state’s absentee and early voting programs. “This is about which candidates give Republicans the strongest chance of carrying Michigan for President Trump,” DePerno said in a statement. “This is also about who can best work outside the ticket to get our candidates elected. I can use my knowledge about how elections work to get Republicans elected.” DePerno has denied wrongdoing in the voting machine tampering case and calls his prosecution politically motivated. Karamo told reporters she had come to gather votes for Detroit attorney Alexandria Taylor — and Taylor said she had given tickets to Karamo. Tyson Shepard, the party’s executive director, said Karamo had been offered a guest credential, but when she refused it, she rejected a request to leave, and police were called. The party ejected Karamo after months of bickering over finances and strategy. A judge ruled in February that she had been removed properly and recognized former congressman Pete Hoekstra as the legitimate chairperson. Supreme Court races in Michigan are officially nonpartisan — meaning candidates appear without a party label on the ballot — but the nominees are chosen by party convention. Democratic-backed justices currently hold a 4-3 majority. Republican victories in both races would flip control of the court. Two Democratic wins would yield a 5-2 supermajority. Republicans have framed the races as a fight to stop government overreach, while Democrats say it’s a battle to preserve reproductive rights. Michiganders enshrined the right to abortion in the state constitution in 2022. Republican delegates gathered in Flint now have a choice between Taylor and Circuit Court Judge Patrick O’Grady for the seat currently held by Justice Kyra Harris Bolden. At the Democratic convention in Lansing, delegates are expected to nominate Bolden, who faces no party challengers and was appointed by Democratic Gov. Gretchen Whitmer after another justice stepped down in 2022. Bolden is the first Black woman appointed to the state’s highest court and would be the first elected if she prevails in November. The other seat up for grabs is currently occupied by Republican-backed conservative Justice David Viviano, who announced in March that he would not seek reelection. The conventions kick off what will almost certainly be competitive and expensive general election races. The candidates seeking Democratic backing have raised far more money than their counterparts on the other side, according to campaign finance reports.","summary":"The race among Republicans for Michigan's state Supreme Court, already shaken up by attorney Matthew DePerno 's decision to drop out, got a further jolt during Saturday's nominating convention when the former party chairperson was escorted out of the arena.","url":"https://www.mercurynews.com/2024/08/24/2020-election-denier-drops-michigan-high-court-bid-as-nominating-conventions-meet/","image":"https://www.mercurynews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/AP24228603558462.jpg?w=1024","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-08-24 23:06:32","author":"The Associated Press","authors":["The Associated Press"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.401},{"id":254854402,"title":"Is RFK Jr.’s departure advantageous for Trump?

JD Vance, former President Donald Trump’s running mate, on Saturday said Trump would veto a federal abortion ban if a bill were to be passed by Congress. Asked on NBC News’ “Meet the Press” about GOP lawmakers like South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham who would want to see Trump advocate for and pass an abortion ban, Vance told moderator Kristen Welker that Trump has “explicitly” said he would veto a ban. “I mean, if you’re not supporting it, as the president of the United States, you fundamentally have to veto it,” Vance argued. The latest position from the Trump campaign comes as the former president has changed his position on abortion policy over the years. In April, Trump was asked on a tarmac in Atlanta about whether he would sign a national abortion ban if it passed through Congress and he simply answered “no.” But the former president didn’t clarify at the time what he considered a “ban.” In 2018, when he was president, Trump called on the Senate to pass a 20-week limit on abortions that had already passed the House. Last year, he celebrated the Supreme Court’s decision to overturn Roe v. Wade and eliminate the constitutional right to abortion. “After 50 years of failure, with nobody coming even close, I was able to kill Roe v.

As of Friday, it is down to $22.81. Last quarter, TMTG reported over $16 million in losses and less than a million dollars in revenue.Meanwhile, TMTG said in a report to the United States Securities Exchange Commission (SEC) that the company's \"success depends in part on the popularity of our brand and the reputation and popularity of President Donald J. Trump. The value of TMTG's brand may diminish if the popularity of President Donald J. Trump were to suffer,\" adding that \"TMTG's business plan relies on President Donald J. Trump bringing his former social media followers to TMTG's platform.\"O'Brien told Witt that Trump's stake in TMTG makes up \"probably about half of his net worth now—at least, I would think,\" adding that his stake is worth around $2.7 billion.\"We're in the very unusual position of having a publicly traded stock that is actually a barometer for Trump's political fortunes because Truth Social's business model is nothing more than the cult of Donald Trump's personality and social media presence,\" O'Brien said.Steven Cheung, Trump's communications director, told Newsweek via email on Saturday evening: \"President Trump has been massively successful throughout his career— starting businesses, building iconic buildings, creating one of the biggest television shows in history, and then becoming President of the United States. He will return to the White House once again.\"Newsweek reached out to TMTG and O'Brien's agents via email for comment on Saturday evening.The biographer explained how recent political events contributed to the successes and failures of Trump's media company.He said that TMTG's stock \"jumped\" in the first few days after Trump was shot in the right ear at a rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, on July 13 in what the FBI is investigating as an assassination attempt.Along with President Joe Biden's weak showing at a debate with Trump in late June, the former president \"had so much momentum at that point in time and he came to the Republican [National] Convention with that kind of momentum,\" O'Brien said.He added: \"Since the Republican convention, all of the momentum has gone to the Democrats...and you've seen Truth Social's stock start to weaken again.\"On July 21, Biden exited the presidential race and endorsed Vice President Kamala Harris who later became the Democratic presidential nominee. Harris has hit the ground running, raising about $500 million since joining the race at the top of the ticket, according to Reuters' sources.Her campaign has also amassed 4.7 million followers on TikTok and 1.3 million followers on X, formerly Twitter. Meanwhile, Trump joined X again earlier this month where he has 89.8 million followers. He only has 7.6 million followers on Truth Social.Witt asked O'Brien what would happen to the value of TMTG if Trump loses the upcoming election and if he wins it.O'Brien told Witt that if Trump loses the election the value of his media company \"becomes negligible. I can't say necessarily that it goes to zero, but it declines even more dramatically from where it is right now.\"He added that if Trump wins the election, the value of his company will go back up.When asked if Trump \"weakened the financial upside of Truth Social\" when he joined X again, O'Brien said, \"Of course, he did,\" however, he said Trump \"realized that he couldn't have reached the political audience he wants to reach.\"","summary":"Trump's former biographer, Tim O'Brien, said on Saturday that the value of Trump's media company \"becomes negligible\" if he loses in November.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/donald-trump-biographer-tim-obrien-net-worth-election-loss-1944002","image":"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2457492/donald-trump.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-08-24 22:33:10","author":"Rachel Dobkin","authors":["Rachel Dobkin"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.104},{"id":254854390,"title":"JD Vance says Trump would veto a national abortion ban","text":"Ohio Sen. JD Vance, former President Donald Trump’s running mate, on Saturday said Trump would veto a federal abortion ban if a bill were to be passed by Congress. Asked on NBC News’ “Meet the Press” about GOP lawmakers like South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham who would want to see Trump advocate for and pass an abortion ban, Vance told moderator Kristen Welker that Trump has “explicitly” said he would veto a ban. “I mean, if you’re not supporting it, as the president of the United States, you fundamentally have to veto it,” Vance argued. The latest position from the Trump campaign comes as the former president has changed his position on abortion policy over the years. In April, Trump was asked on a tarmac in Atlanta about whether he would sign a national abortion ban if it passed through Congress and he simply answered “no.” But the former president didn’t clarify at the time what he considered a “ban.” In 2018, when he was president, Trump called on the Senate to pass a 20-week limit on abortions that had already passed the House. Last year, he celebrated the Supreme Court’s decision to overturn Roe v. Wade and eliminate the constitutional right to abortion. “After 50 years of failure, with nobody coming even close, I was able to kill Roe v. Wade, much to the ‘shock’ of everyone,” Trump said in a May 2023 social media post.

But those radios were never picked up. The next day, three minutes before shots were fired toward Trump, local police radioed that a man was on a nearby roof. That warning never made it to the Secret Service, whose snipers didn’t know the would-be assassin was on the roof until shots rang out. In the 15 seconds it took for snipers to lock onto and kill the shooter, he was able to fire off eight shots. Standing over the gunman’s dead body minutes later, a local police officer who responded to the initial warning expressed frustration that his own radio calls about a man on the roof seemed to go unheeded by the other officers. “That’s what I was f**king calling out bro, f**king ‘On top of the roof,’” the officer said, according to body camera footage. “We’re not – we on the same frequency?” More than a month after the near assassination, new details continue to emerge about the failures of that day. Congressional inquiries, local and federal law enforcement, and other sources who spoke with CNN reveal stunning gaps in communication, highlighting how crucial information was lost in a confusing thicket of police radio chatter, text messages, state trooper middlemen and command posts tasked with communicating with federal agents on the ground. Details about the forgotten radios were included in a recent report from Rep. Clay Higgins, a Louisiana Republican member of the congressional task force investigating the events of that day. Higgins claims that a county emergency services commander had “personally reminded” Secret Service counter-sniper teams to pick up their assigned radios at a command post located at the Butler County Fairgrounds. “It didn’t happen,” according to Higgins’ report. That detail was confirmed to CNN by Butler County District Attorney Richard Goldinger. “I can confirm that the Butler County ESU team made radios available to the Secret Service and that they were not utilized by the Secret Service,” Goldinger said in a statement. While it’s unclear if Secret Service would have gotten the warning about a man on the roof had they picked up the radios, Goldinger said, “It is safe to assume that if a holder of an ESU radio was paying attention, they would have received the call.” The Secret Service said in a statement that the agency will examine Higgins’ report and “is committed to investigating the decisions and actions of personnel related to the event in Butler, Pennsylvania” and will hold “our personnel accountable to the highest professional standards.” Higgins and other members of the congressional task force are set to visit Butler on Monday, meeting with local officials and tour the rally site in their first major investigative step since their inception. All eyes on Secret Service The morning after the shooting that pierced Trump’s ear and left one rallygoer dead, local law enforcement and federal officials met together to go over the day’s events, a source with knowledge of the meeting told CNN. Shortly after the meeting started, officials started to realize the severe communication failures that day, as several groups had different time stamps for when the gunman was first identified as a threat. “They didn’t have a whole lot of information other than, ‘Hey, this is what we did, and this is when we did it,’” the source said of the morning-after debrief, noting that the disjointed timelines made clear that each law enforcement agency tasked with protecting the former president that day was largely operating independently of one another, rather than as a cohesive team. As the timeline of the day’s events has come into focus, the Secret Service has borne the brunt of the blame for the lack of coordination and a clear, unencumbered communication structure. “This was a Secret Service failure,” acting Secret Service Director Ronald Rowe told reporters during a news conference earlier this month – a clear shift in tone from when the agency previously pointed blame on locals for their failure to keep eyes on would-be Trump assassin Thomas Crooks that day. “That roof should have been covered.” According to multiple current and former law enforcement officials interviewed by CNN, the Secret Service hasn’t adopted existing tools, including a nationwide broadband network developed after the 9/11 terrorist attacks, designed to increase communication between law enforcement and first responders. Instead, the Secret Service relies on a fragmented system. Rather than talking directly with individual state and local officers on the ground, the agency routes those dispatches through intermediaries and command posts. Without better communication systems, the agency is at times forced to rely on spotty cellular service, as it did on July 13 in the rural Butler fairgrounds of western Pennsylvania. Limited bandwidth that day was crowded out by the thousands of rally goers using their phones. As a result, counter-snipers had difficulty texting pictures of the gunman when he was identified as suspicious. The lack of cell coverage also limited the Secret Service’s ability to deploy a counter-drone system that could have detected Crooks’ own drone, which he flew over the area hours before Trump took the stage. When the president travels, the Secret Service leans on several others in the federal government, such as the White House Communications Agency and the Department of Defense, to bolster cell coverage and provide bulletproof glass and other infrastructure needed to protect the highest position in government. These security measures were not extended to presidential candidates. Since the shooting, the Secret Service has added its own mobile communications apparatus to create a private cellular network for Trump’s detail, both at his campaign events and to his motorcade, a federal source familiar with the planning told CNN. The agency also is surrounding Trump with ballistic glass at outdoor rallies and has increased the number of agents on his detail. But the issue of how to directly communicate with local law enforcement remains unresolved. “Local officials were penned in by a cumbersome hierarchical system of reporting that stymied the flow of urgent information from one unit to the next,” Sen. Chuck Grassley of Iowa told CNN in a statement. The powerful Republican has spearheaded his own probe into the assassination attempt. “There was no unified radio channel for all law enforcement on the premises to communicate in the event of an emergency — instead, units connected over various radio channels, group chats and even emails,” Grassley said. “Officers relied heavily on spotty cell service to get their messages through, and were often unsure if the right law enforcement entity received them.” The solution, people familiar with the Secret Service communication infrastructure have told CNN, is not as easy as plugging local law enforcement into the agency’s communication platforms, which are encrypted, connected to the US military and heavily protected by the NSA. “It’s not as simple as people are putting it out to be,” Jonathan Wackrow, a CNN law enforcement analyst and former Secret Service agent, told CNN. The agency, Wackrow said, needs to invest in training agents to better engage with local law enforcement and communicate to each person on the ground what their exact role is and how to communicate with the agency. The source familiar with security planning among agencies and local law enforcement who told CNN about the day-after briefing said the issue is exacerbated by historical mistrust between federal and local officials. “It’s always hard because agencies are so proprietary, it’s the same thing – back to 9/11, same thing – it’s hard to get people out of their own little world and agree to share information,” the source told CNN. “And then there’s always concern about leaks, or somebody leaking information and who has access to it. How’s it controlled?” In a statement to CNN, the Secret Service noted that the task of creating a platform for agents and officers to quickly communicate is “a complicated undertaking, and it will take a whole of government approach to fix this technical issue, which will require both time and resource investments.” The agency has established a task force inside of the Department of Homeland Security to find potential solutions to the communication hurdles. Bygone training exercises There also appear to have been processes that could have been put in place years earlier that sources tell CNN could have helped that day. A recent drop-off in training exercises between local and federal law enforcement agencies on how to handle large events may have contributed to communication breakdowns that day. Those table-top exercises, which focus heavily on making sure law enforcement partners are using the proper channels of communication, have been significantly reduced since the Covid-19 pandemic. Another key issue, the source familiar with interagency security planning says, is that communication between the parties is a manual process and, in the past, there have been issues as simple as local law enforcement officers not being able to communicate with the agency because people were on the wrong radio channel. The problem of having two command posts, where information would travel from local officers in one command post to agents in another, was also instrumental in the communication breakdown that day. “What I continually see happen again and again is someone will say they’ve assigned a liaison, which oftentimes turn into a single point of failure,” the person told CNN. On July 13, two command posts were established, one controlled by local law enforcement and the other by the Secret Service, according to multiple people familiar with the security setup that day. The agency’s command post had a representative from the State Police who acted as the bridge between local officers and the Secret Service, according to congressional testimony. In the wake of the shooting, acting Director Rowe has ordered every field office in the Secret Service to either create a single centralized command post for each event or have a representative present at the local command post to streamline communication, a federal law enforcement source familiar with the decision told CNN. The congressional task force has pledged to investigate the communication breakdown that day, making clear the Secret Service and local law enforcement will face additional questions as their probe intensifies in the lead-up to the 2024 election this November.

In a recent podcast episode, Cohen offered some pointed advice to Kamala Harris, the newly named Democratic presidential nominee, ahead of her upcoming debate with Trump. His suggestion? Harris should ask Trump a question that could leave him fumbling for an answer. He said, \"We're stupid, our economy is in the toilet, there's crime, everyone's a rapist, drug addict, murderer. I would say, if I was Kamala Harris—hopefully during the debate—maybe you could tell me, since America is so bad, in your opinion, I mean every time this idiot opens his mouth, he's s***-talking the United States of America...so I would just like to ask you, Donald, what country would you like to go live in that you think is better than the United States of America?\" As per Newsweek, Cohen’s suggestion is a strategic one. It highlights a contradiction in Trump’s messaging: he claims to love America, yet often speaks about the country as if it’s beyond saving. Cohen exclaimed, \"It's a great question to ask him because there's no answer that he could give that would be acceptable…We're [the country is] surging in everything that we're doing, what's better?\" As per The Hill, Cohen, who was at the Democratic National Convention in support of Harris, also took a moment to reflect on how Republicans, including Trump, might react to the presence of anti-Trump Republicans at the event. Cohen brushed off the concerns and said, “I don’t really care what he’s thinking. This isn’t about him…It’s not my first Democratic convention that I have ever been at. This is a massive mistake that is regularly made by people,” he said. “I have been a Democrat virtually my entire life.” Cohen’s transformation from Trump’s personal attorney to one of his fiercest critics is emblematic of a broader shift among some former allies who have become disillusioned with Trumpism. Cohen asserted, “I don’t care about his feelings. What I care about is seeing a big, gigantic blue wave come November and not just for Kamala Harris and Tim Walz but the entire down ballot…Trumpism is fascism, and we must eradicate it from our body politic, otherwise, we’re going to lose our Democratic Republic. We’re not going back to Trump-era politics.” Cohen further continued, “2016 through 2020 was a very tumultuous, chaotic time in America’s history. The question is, do we want to go back there? Of course, people start chanting when Kamala is talking, we’re not going back. Why would you want to live in chaos? Why do you want to live with the tumult that this man brings? I know the man and I’m telling you, if he, God forbid a million times, wins the election right now in 2024, there will never be another election ever again.\"","summary":"Cohen said, “It’s not my first Democratic convention that I have ever been at.

Known for his taciturn persona, when news of his passing in 1933 became public, wisecracking writer Dorothy Parker quipped: “how can they tell?” Coolidge’s nickname was Silent Cal. Now, we’ve got Silent Kam – as in Kamala Harris – who’s banking that her strategy of soundlessness will carry her all the way to the White House. “Silence is golden” goes the ancient proverb; in Kamala’s case, it may also win her the presidency. After a successful debut on the national stage during Brett Kavanaugh’s Supreme Court Senate Judiciary Hearings in 2018, it looked like Kamala was poised to become the next Democratic darling: a woman with both an African-American and Indian-American background, a U.S. Senator, and a prosecutor, to boot. But it was not to be: in her 2020 presidential bid, she didn’t even make it to 2020. It was a colossal failure and Kamala dropped out before the Iowa Caucus. Even though Joe Biden picked her as his running mate and she became the first female VP, the administration’s been hiding her for the most part ever since. That seems to be working rather well, as she’s become the Democratic presidential nominee by coronation. Personally, I received exactly as many delegates to the Democratic Convention during the primaries as she did: zero. Ever since the Democrat Syndicate pulled out the rug from Biden, forcing him into retirement for his own good – the way some mob bosses are strongarmed when they’ve fallen out of favor with the other families – Silent Kam’s enjoyed a honeymoon, whereby she sees her poll numbers soar even as she says and does next to nothing. She doesn’t have to. She’ll get a free ride, the way Thomas Jefferson did when the Louisiana Purchase practically fell into his lap, or Bill Clinton did when his presidency coincided with the advent of the Internet, resulting in a juggernaut economy. After all, we all know how the vast majority of Americans didn’t want to see a Biden-Trump rematch, and now they won’t have to. Kamala’s advantage is that unlike Donald Trump, she is, by default, not one of the two names comprising that rematch. She’s a sight for sore eyes to those for whom presidential elections are amusing parlor games, with no consequences expected based on candidates’ platforms. She’s a woman, she’s young(ish), and she’s black: “woo-hoo, you go, girl!” As for Trump, he hasn’t done much as yet to slow Kamala’s momentum. He’s gone back to namecalling and picking pointless fights with Republican governors in crucial swing states. It’s as if he doesn’t realize it’s his election to lose: immigration is the top issue on voters’ minds, and the Harris campaign has the audacity to portray her as the one who’s tough on the border. Americans also care about rampant crime, wokeness run amok, and the longterm effects of runaway inflation. However, unlike a master campaigner like Ronald Reagan, who also ran against inflation the last time it was significant, in 1980, Trump’s not done a good enough job of explaining to the American people that now-falling inflation doesn’t mean grocery and gas prices will go down, it just means when they go even higher, they’ll rise at a slower rate. It’s like credit cards: if a cardholder runs up a $50,000 tab and then cuts spending in half, that means the debt will rise slower than before, but it’s not going to get smaller. Trump also needs to explain why things got as bad as they did under Biden, why Harris would only make them worse, and what Trump would do, specifically, to make them better. Otherwise, Trump’s not going to attract any new voters, and that’s a problem. When Biden was Trump’s opponent, it didn’t matter; Trump was likely going to win by attrition because many Democrats, independents, and apolitical Americans were going to stay home. But now, they’re turning out for Kamala, which is why she closed the gap and jumped ahead. Debates are back in style again, after that last one back in June. Trump needs to score big against Kamala on September 10. As the Wall Street Journal’s Daniel Henninger wisely recommends, Trump should stop the rallies filled with his own sycophants – which are breeding grounds for him going dangerously off script, to the mainstream media’s delight, as they’ll play the clips over and over again – and instead hold town hall meetings with undecided voters in swing states. If Trump really wants this thing – and I’m not unequivocally convinced he does – then he’s got to go out and work for it, harder than he’s been. Speaking of the mainstream media, where have all the responsible journalists gone? Is there one reporter out there – other than those in Trump’s camp – who has the intestinal fortitude to demand that Silent Kam holds a press conference and starts appearing on the Sunday morning shows? Even if she does, would the hosts of Meet the Press, Face the Nation, and This Week challenge her with tough questions, or will they ask her to, say, name a song that inspired her? As for those undecided voters, they don’t need any skills to do their ‘job’ or voting. Pilots need to know how to fly airplanes. Surgeons to perform operations. Mechanics to fix cars. Not voters, though. They just have to be U.S. citizens (well, theoretically anyway), 18 or older, and not in prison. And they can have fun walking to their favorite neighborhood dropbox weeks before the election to plop in their ballot: for Silent Kam, simply because she’s not Trump.","summary":"Exactly 100 years ago, the incumbent president was Calvin Coolidge.

The Republican candidate told Daily Mail on Wednesday, August 21, 2024, that he's refused to get intelligence briefings he's entitled to as the Republican party's nominee so he couldn't be accused of leaking classified information like he's been before. He told the correspondent, \"I don't want them, because, number one, I know what's happening. It's very easy to see what's happening,\" as he alleged a trap laid out for him before attacking rivals POTUS Joe Biden and his newly installed election opponent Vice President Kamala Harris. \"We have an incompetent leader, and we have two incompetent leaders. The 78-year-old is noticeably playing safe amid the tight race with his Democratic rival. Although as a presidential nominee, he's entitled to be briefed by the United States spy agencies to prepare him for the role as commander-in-chief, Trump however denied accepting any sensitive information. His decision could be a lesson he learned after the FBI recovered classified documents from his Palm Beach property Mar-a-Lago. Trump further called Harris a Marxist, \"We have a Marxist that's going to try and be president, and this country is not ready for a Marxist or a communist president, and that's what she is.

So the only way to solve that problem is not to take it I don't want it understood. I'll have plenty of them when I get in.\" Historically, former presidents are also briefed by the US Intelligence as a courtesy to keep them updated in case their advice is needed. But back in 2021, Biden prohibited his predecessor Trump from receiving the country's sensitive information citing his \"erratic behavior.\" The now-81-year-old told CBS News' Norah O'Donnell, \"I just think that there is no need for him to have the intelligence briefings. What value is giving him an intelligence briefing? What impact does he have at all, other than the fact he might slip and say something?\" This decision marks the first time any former president has been barred from the briefings ever since President Harry Truman introduced them in the early 1950s. They are designed for a smoother transition of power conducted by the Office of the Director of National Intelligence. Currently, ex-presidents Jimmy Carter, Bill Clinton, George W. Bush, and Barack Obama are briefed on a regular basis. Aside from Biden, other White House officials had trust issues regarding Trump's ability to retain secret information. For instance, the chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, Representative Adam B. Schiff, echoed, \"[A] number of intelligence partners around the world started withholding information from us because they didn't trust the president would safeguard that information. And that makes us less safe,\" per The New York Times.","summary":"Currently, ex-presidents Jimmy Carter, Bill Clinton, George W.

(Photo by Alain JOCARD / AFP) (Photo by ALAIN JOCARD/AFP via Getty Images) AFP via Getty Images Key Facts X is planning to use the anticipated impact of employees as a basis for what stock options will be awarded to them, according to an email sent to employees and viewed by The Verge, meaning staff members will need to write the one-page report about their contributions so they can receive stock. The requirement comes amid a delayed promotions process at X, The Verge reported, noting Musk has previously told employees that stock could be cashed out regularly—just as employees can at his astronautics company SpaceX. Shortly after his $44 billion acquisition of Twitter, Musk said in an email to employees the company would be transitioning to an “extremely hardcore” operation, one requiring staffers to work “long hours at high intensity,” according to The Washington Post, which noted the email asked employees to sign a pledge or leave the company with three months severance pay. Musk was also a large proponent of returning to in-office work during the second year of the COVID-19 pandemic, demanding Tesla and SpaceX employees to “spend a minimum of 40 hours in the office per week” or be terminated, The New York Times reported. Tesla began closely watching employee attendance in 2022, with managers sending Musk weekly reports on absences, NBC News reported, adding remote Tesla workers who could not relocate to be in the office full-time had about three months to make the move or leave the electric automaker. Musk clamped down on remote work at X shortly after becoming the platform’s owner, requiring managers to meet in-person with employees at least once a month and threatening higher-ups with termination if they allowed an employee who was not “exceptional” to work remotely, according to NBC News. X did not immediately respond to Forbes’ request for comment.

Tangent Tesla employees worked long hours for the company during its early days, resulting in staffers sleeping on floors after working shifts up to 12 hours long, The Verge reported, noting Tesla’s Fremont, California, plant had three times as many safety violations as 10 other U.S. car plants combined. Musk’s Company’s Recent Heavy Turnover Musk is also not afraid of cutting down on employees and being frank about layoffs. The billionaire told the BBC he laid off more than 6,000 people at X (about 80% of the company’s staff) within his first few months as the company’s chief, noting the process can sometimes be “painful.” Musk also laid off hundreds of Tesla employees earlier this year impacting more than 10% of the electric vehicle maker’s global workforce. The company later sought to hire 800 employees for service and artificial intelligence roles, Fortune reported. Musk’s Contentious Relationship With Labor Unions Musk has been accused of threatening workers who try to unionize—just this month, actually, after a conversation with former President Donald Trump that prompted the United Auto Workers to file federal labor charges against Musk and Trump. The former president talked about striking workers at a company he refused to name, saying, “they go on strike and you say, ‘that’s OK, you’re all gone. You’re all gone. So, every one of you is gone.’” The United Auto Workers, which represents more than 391,000 workers at automakers like Ford, General Motors and Stellantis, argued Musk and Trump “advocated for the illegal firing of striking workers,” and claimed Musk “adopted” the stance. (Musk’s Tesla is the only major U.S. automaker whose workers are not represented by a union.) In 2018, Musk asked in a tweet why Tesla workers would pay union dues and “give up stock options for nothing?” The National Labor Relations Board later condemned the post, saying it was threatening to Tesla labor organizers. Key Background The high expectations and strict policies at Musk’s companies are likely partially derived from the billionaire’s own work ethic. Musk made headlines in 2018 when he revealed he slept on couches and under his desk during production of the Tesla Model 3, telling CBS he did not have time to go home and shower. That level of commitment has seeped into his expectations of employees, as the billionaire told investors during an earnings call early this year that Tesla workers may need to sleep on the production line as the company pushed to build a new, affordable line of electric vehicles, according to Business Insider.

Don’t bet on it","text":"In a close election campaign with both sides looking for an edge, the party with more people watching their midsummer convention would seem to have an important sign of success. Yet historically speaking, that measurement means next to nothing. Eight times over the past 16 presidential election cycles dating back to 1960, the party with the most popular convention among television viewers won in November. Eight times they lost. The Democrats will see what a summer advantage means this November. Vice President Kamala Harris’ party averaged 22 million viewers for its convention this week, compared to the Republican average of 19.1 million in July, the Nielsen company said on Friday. “It’s one of those interesting things about covering politics is that you see these indicators about what really matters, and a lot of times it doesn’t,” said veteran journalist Jeff Greenfield, who covered the Democrats this week for Politico. Popularity contests in TV ratings don’t necessarily translate This week’s numbers mean the Democrats have been more popular with viewers in 13 of the past 17 presidential election year summers, Nielsen said. Although Democrats have won eight of the first 16 elections, their candidate recorded the most votes in 10 of them. The last time a party lost despite having a more popular convention was in 2016, although it was close: Democrat Hillary Clinton’s nominating session beat Donald Trump by less than a million viewers per average, Nielsen said. For all of his vaunted popularity as a television attraction, Trump fell short in the convention ratings three straight times. A convention’s last night, with the nominee’s acceptance speech, generally gets the most viewers. Trump reached 25.4 million people with his July speech, less than a week after an assassination attempt, and the average would have undoubtedly been higher if his 92-minute address hadn’t stretched past midnight on the East Coast. Harris’ shorter speech reached 26.2 million. Despite Barack Obama’s historic election as the nation’s first Black president in 2008, Republican John McCain’s convention actually had more than 4 million viewers each night on average. People probably are watching their own party’s convention For four straight cycles, between 1976 through 1988, the party with the most-watched convention lost the election. That included the two lopsided victories by Republican Ronald Reagan — although a nomination fight between Jimmy Carter and Ted Kennedy in 1980 and the selection of Geraldine Ferraro in 1984 as the first woman on a national ticket probably boosted the Democrats’ convention audience in those years. Typically, people are more likely to watch their own party’s convention, Greenfield said. That’s reflected in the ratings this year: Fox News Channel, which appeals to Republicans, had by far more viewers than any other network for the GOP convention, while left-leaning MSNBC has dominated this past week. It will also be interesting to see if star power — or potential star power — boosted Harris. Rumors of a surprise Beyoncé or Taylor Swift appearance, ultimately unfounded, hung over the Democratic session. Both conventions are highly produced television events as much as they are political meetings, and Greenfield said it was clear the Democrats had the upper hand. “I think if you were going strictly on entertainment value,” he said, “Oprah Winfrey and Stevie Wonder trump Kid Rock and Hulk Hogan.”","summary":"In a close election campaign with both sides looking for an edge, the party with more people watching their midsummer convention would seem to have an important sign of success.

The Grim Reality of Harris-Walz in Office’, TNH August 17, 2024, Constantinos E. Scaros futilely and unconvincingly argues: “Are you going to let your hatred of Mr. X deter you from doing the logical thing and supporting his taking over the ship’s wheel? Are you really going to let some amateur steer the ship instead, putting all your lives at risk, just to keep Mr. X from basking in the spotlight and getting the credit?” “Donald Trump is Mr. X, and the amateur in question is Kamala Harris.” In the outset, we must expose the fallacy here: if that’s the argument, then Trump, with no political experience whatsoever (not even as a local councilperson), was unqualified and too risky to have been voted president in the first instance, according to Dr. Scaros’ exemplum. Kamala Harris, a former prosecutor and District Attorney, was a U.S. Senator, who served on prestigious committees, and is the Vice President, being the most active President of the Senate in tie-breaking votes. She is well qualified and experienced – no amateur to the contraire. Without an appealing or persuasive Trump record upon which to braggingly argue, Dr. Scaros deflects and engages in partisan wishful (and fear-mongering) speculation (a la Trump) with a “[s]ampling of what a Harris-Walz administration will look like:” on borders, crime, wokeness, foreign policy, and the economy. That’s no reality. Let’s look at reality: the facts, irrespective of political opinion or ideology. Trump talks a good game but didn’t do a good job as president. Here are a few representative substandard facts of the Trump presidency, from FactCheck.org, a nonpartisan, nonprofit, consumer advocate organization: The economy lost 2.7 million jobs. The unemployment rate increased by 1.7 percentage points to 6.4%. The international trade deficit Trump promised to reduce went up. The U.S. trade deficit in goods and services in 2020 was the highest since 2008 and increased 36.3% from 2016. The number of people lacking health insurance rose by 3 million. The federal debt held by the public went up, from $14.4 trillion to $21.6 trillion. Illegal immigration increased. Handgun production rose 12.5% last year compared with 2016, setting a new record. The murder rate rose to the highest level since 1997. Dr. Scaros may be unperturbed by the unglamorous Trump record and Trumpers may suffer from opacity of mental clarity in reality reasoning, but, as the late Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan indelibly said: “You are entitled to your opinion. But you are not entitled to your own facts.” It’s a flawed premise from which to argue that having been president in and of itself makes Trump soundly experienced, knowledgeable, and of good judgment. Here, it reassures the same old thing – or even worse, as a vengeful and egocentric Trump will wreak havoc upon our democratic institutions and retaliate against his political nemeses. Trump steered the national welfare down inimical avenues and shipwrecked our nation on January 6th. Trump, erratic and impulsive, was an oblivious and unschooled president on the intricacies and ramifications of policy and prudent decision-making. But he did spend a lot of time playing golf (and he cheats at that too). Now, let’s look at Trump’s ranting and acerbic promises. Trump hoodwinked his voters; he broke most of his promises. Trump in 2016 made a couple of hundred campaign promises, and in his announcement speech for his 2024 presidential bid Trump (a convicted felon with a multitude of state and federal indictments pending) made at least 20 false and misleading claims, according to CNN. The overwhelming majority of Trump’s promises were broken, and a second term will not fare better. If one fails to heed its lessons, history tends to repeat itself. The broken promises range from the Mexican-U.S. wall to COVID vaccines, to the debt, to the trade deficit, to GDP growth, to manufacturing, to jobs, to medical pre-existing conditions, to coal fuel and mining, to guns, to draining the swamp, to lobbying, etc. There are sufficient and varied reliable sources (from liberal to conservative) one may reference for specific meritless claims or promises made and broken by Trump. A narrative top 40 list of broken Trump promises is presented by the renowned Robert Reich, a distinguished university professor, author, former member of the President’s National Economic Council and U.S. Labor Secretary, in ‘The American Prospect’ in 2020. Funnily, Trump criticized President Obama for flying to Hawaii to play golf, when Trump broke the record for golf visits during his presidency. This hypocrisy is also comically cynical because Trump promised that he would not have time to play golf if elected president. A stupefying broken promise, that’s forgotten from many accounts, is that Trump promised to self-fund his campaign. Not only did the exaggerated billionaire take so much of other people’s money but he also duped folks to pay for his super-expensive teams of lawyers. Trump does not put his money where his mouth is. Trump breached his covenants (Trump proclaimed a Contract with the American Voter) with the American people who voted for him and Trump failed to deliver especially when graded against his (inchoate) solutions and (appeasing) promises. Instead, his vitriolic politics have been roiling the nation. The plea to fellow Americans is let us heed what independent (and real billionaire) Michael Bloomberg said in his memorable 2016 DNC convention speech that’s so apt in 2024: “let’s elect a sane, competent person.” The risk is if Mr. X should win.

Kennedy, Jr., the eldest son of Robert F. Kennedy, Sr. and the best-known surviving scion of the Kennedy family dynasty, took the stage to endorse Donald Trump for president of the United States. It was an iconic and consequential moment: A member of the Kennedy family, royalty in Democratic politics for generations, turning his back on the party of his family's legacy to endorse a Republican candidate. In so doing, Kennedy did something extraordinary; he stood on principle over politics and embraced actual democracy instead of the rigged candidate system created by the Democratic National Committee. ROBERT F. KENNEDY JR. TO APPEAR ON ‘FOX NEWS SUNDAY’ IN FIRST EXCLUSIVE INTERVIEW SINCE ENDORSING TRUMP In the space of a few sentences, Kennedy erased four days of speeches at the DNC. His clarion call for truth, accountability and the democratic system, has reverberated loudly for many middle of the road voters, people who feel alienated by the politics of both left and right, folks who no longer believe that people in positions of power care about their concerns at all. Having initially sought the nomination of the Democratic Party, Kennedy was blocked at every turn by President Joe Biden's supporters in the DNC. They wouldn't allow debates, wouldn't allow a full contest for the party's nomination. Even though Biden was mentally and physically a shell of the man he'd once been, the DNC protected Biden, arguing anyone sharing videos of his clear mental and physical deterioration was participating in \"cheap fakes.\" So too did their allies in the left-wing media. Remember, it was only 60 days ago that CNN, MSNBC, the New York Times, the Washington Post, and other left-wing media allies attacked anyone who dared to suggest Biden was anything other than sharp as a tack behind closed doors. Kennedy lambasted this in his address Friday afternoon endorsing Trump for president, and articulating the primary challenge of our times quite clearly. \"When a U.S. president colludes with, or outright coerces, media companies to censor political speech, it's an attack on our most sacred right of free expression,\" he said. \"And that's the very right upon which all of our constitutional rights rest.\" Democrats have become so corrupt that even a Kennedy can't support them any longer. RFK Jr. asserted that in the 16 months of his campaign, ABC, NBC, CBS, MSNBC, and CNN combined gave him only two live interviews. \"The mainstream media was once the guardian of the First Amendment and democrat principles, but has since joined the systemic attack on democracy,\" he said. To bring this point into clear focus, after ignoring him for 16 months, as soon as he endorsed Trump, CNN had a member of the Kennedy family on last night in primetime to attack RFK Jr. The network that wouldn't carry Kennedy himself or any of his arguments was happy to offer live primetime guest spots to members of his family who would trash him. All of this led to what I believe will be seen as an important legacy of the 2024 campaign. Democrats have become so corrupt that even a Kennedy can't support them any longer. Kennedy's embrace of Trump, which he compared to Abraham Lincoln's team of rivals in his address, represents yet another incredible twist in an election season that has so far been propelled by the unexpected. Less than two months ago, on June 27, Trump took the stage to debate Biden in Atlanta. I know it feels like two years since then, but consider what has happened since that night. Trump knocked out Biden, ending his political career. It was the first true knockout we've ever seen in the history of American presidential debates. It took several weeks -- including Trump becoming the first president to be shot by a would-be assassin since Ronald Reagan in 1981 -- for Biden to realize he couldn't get back up off the electoral canvas, but on July 21 -- three weeks and three days after the debate -- the Biden campaign finally waved the towel in the corner of the ring. Biden was done. He withdrew from the race and has barely been seen since. Next up, Kamala Harris. Yes, the same Kamala Harris who Democrats spent months arguing should be dropped from the political ticket because she was the least popular vice president in the history of modern American politics. Hell, Dick Cheney shot someone in the face while he was vice president(!), and was still more popular than Harris. In one fell swoop, without receiving a single vote for president, Democrats canceled the expressed will of 14 million primary voters and elevated Harris to the nomination. Amazingly, Harris, who has never received a single vote for president, is the nominee. Yes, the same Harris who dropped out of the 2020 presidential race before a single vote had been cast. The same Harris who most with functional brains realize would have never been the Democrat nominee if Biden had done what he should have done and announced he wasn't running in the late spring of 2023. That would have allowed an actual Democratic primary but, alas, we've all come to realize Democrats don't want elections, they want selections. Hillary Clinton in 2016, Biden in 2020, now Harris in 2024. They're all the product of the people running the DNC, the hand-selected nominees of the party, will of the voters be damned. The party that claims Trump is a threat to democracy has now, incredibly, charged Trump with felonies in three different states and Washington, D.C., seeking jail time in each case, removed the president who received the Democrat nomination for president and replaced him with a nominee who received not a single vote for that nomination, fought every third party challenger, including Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., the green party, Cornel West, and the libertarian party, who has sought ballot access in the 2024 election, and dutifully hidden Harris from all media, refusing all interview requests and all press conference availabilities. This is not the democratic process. This is not how candidates should be chosen. Kennedy realized all of this. It's why he couldn't stand silently by and allow himself to be a spoiler in this race. It's why he felt compelled to speak out, stand on principle, and endorse the only presidential candidate who actually won a primary, to support the only presidential candidate who supports free speech and believes in sharing his vision for the world. CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION Ultimately, even if it required him to turn his back on the party that made his family a mythological heir to Camelot, Kennedy had only one choice. The result -- Trump and Kennedy are now a team. Thanks to the bevy of interviews, press conferences, and public events both men have had, we know exactly where Donald Trump and Robert F. Kennedy stand on all the issues. But we still don't have a single policy page on Harris' website. Her team has spent more time telling us what she doesn't believe than what she does.

The Harris plan released earlier this month aims to boost the inventory of affordable housing by encouraging more construction, while also offering $25,000 in down payment assistance for first-time buyers. Parrott, who is the co-owner of housing advisory firm Parrott Ryan Advisors and a former White House economic advisor, and Zandi pointed to the expansion of a tax break for developers known as the Low-Income Housing Tax Credit, which would increase affordable rental supply. To add more affordable homes for purchase, the Harris plan would also allow builders to get a tax break on profits on homes that are built and sold to first-time buyers. Yet another part of the plan would create a new tax credit for renovating homes that couldn’t be sold for a price high enough to recoup repair costs. That would bring into the market additional supply that would otherwise sit unused. To overcome infrastructure shortfalls and any local political resistance, the Harris plan would provide more money for states and communities. “Each of these moves would be meaningful on its own, but together they would amount to the most aggressive supply-side push since the national investment in housing that followed World War II,” Parrott and Zandi wrote. That’s when the federal government provided assistance to veterans via the G.I. Bill, which included, among other things, favorable terms for buying a home. That spurred more demand and construction. Harris housing plan cost To be sure, the plan comes with a big price tag: $125 billion. It would have to be paid for with tax revenue or offset with spending cuts elsewhere, they noted. Otherwise, it would add to the federal budget deficit and help lift mortgage rates, making homes less affordable. But the upfront costs of boosting supply are far outweighed by the long-term costs of allowing the housing crisis to worsen, they warned. “Our lack of affordable housing will continue to depress savings, opportunity and growth in ways that will do long-term harm to the nation’s economy,” Parrott and Zandi said. “A thoughtful effort to address the problem now will ultimately lead to more growth and less cost.” Trump housing plan For his part, Donald Trump told Bloomberg that he would lower housing costs by easing environmental and permitting rules. But he also has suggested at campaign events that he would limit low-income housing developments in suburbs. The Republican Party’s 2024 platform blames high housing costs on illegal immigrants and vows to deport them, which some housing experts have said would reduce the availability of construction workers and add to costs. The platform also promises a mix of demand- and supply-side measures. “To help new home buyers, Republicans will reduce mortgage rates by slashing Inflation, open limited portions of Federal Lands to allow for new home construction, promote homeownership through Tax Incentives and support for first-time buyers, and cut unnecessary Regulations that raise housing costs,” it says.","summary":"\"Our lack of affordable housing will continue to depress savings, opportunity and growth in ways that will do long-term harm to the nation’s economy.\"","url":"https://fortune.com/2024/08/24/kamala-harris-housing-plan-affordable-construction-postwar-supply-boom-donald-trump/","image":"https://fortune.com/img-assets/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/GettyImages-2167179802-e1724529499345.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-08-24 21:18:08","author":"Jason Ma","authors":["Jason Ma"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.016},{"id":254851264,"title":"Sir Keir Starmer’s top aides love-bombed Kamala Harris’s team this week","text":"SEVERAL of Sir Starmer’s closest aides have been love bombing Kamala Harris’ team this week.

Brittany, who has been married to Chiefs star Patrick Mahomes since 2022, sparked a liberal meltdown Friday when she liked a Donald Trump post on social media. The pregnant mother-of-two hit back at her critics in a fiery response but many social media users feared what the controversy could mean for her fledgling friendship with Taylor. The popstar, who formed a close bond with Brittany at boyfriend Travis Kelce’s Chiefs games over the course of the last NFL season, has publicly expressed disdain for Trump and voted for his ex-rival Joe Biden in the past. Fans questioned whether the political controversy could be enough to bring their newfound friendship crashing down on the eve of the new NFL season. However, it appears their friendship is strong enough to withstand Brittany’s newfound reputation as the Mahomeses joined the Anti-Hero hitmaker and Kelce in Rhode Island. With her European tour behind her and NFL season approaching, Taylor and Travis are making the most of their downtime with a much-needed romantic reunion – but only for a ‘fortnight’ – DailyMail.com can reveal. The power couple have reunited for an end-of-summer getaway – this time seen today on the balcony of the singer’s epic Rhode Island mansion. The $17million vacation home achieved celebrity status after it became the site of Taylor’s legendary star-studded Independence Day parties. Taylor has returned to her iconic holiday house for the first time this summer – now with her beau in tow. And it looks like their friends and family – including Patrick – joined them. Patrick and Brittany soaked up the sunshine ahead of the season – with the quarterback and tight end enduring a difficult pre-season with three straight losses. Taylor and Travis were captured crowding around the Mahomeses’ youngest, Bronze, as his Super Bowl-winning dad cradled him on the balcony of the luxury holiday home. Travis’s brother Jason and sister-in-law Kylie joined the all-star Chiefs line up with their children, as the latter continues to enjoy his first offseason after retirement, and ahead of his new TV role with Amazon Prime, starting next month. Although Brittany wasn’t snapped alongside her husband and her friends, it is expected that she would have also joined in the party. Eagle-eyed Instagram users caught the soon-to-be mother of three liking a Trump post mapping out 16 of his policies to his 26.3million followers; ranging from topics on immigration to the economy. The like generated plenty of outrage amongst liberals on social media, and Brittany appeared to hit out at her critics in a fiery response. ‘I mean honestly, to be a hater as an adult you have to have some deep rooted issues you refuse to heal from childhood,’ she wrote Friday night. ‘There’s no reason your brain is fully developed and you hate to see others doing well,’ she added. After Brittany’s like was unearthed, it stoked rumors that Swift – a known liberal who publicly accused Trump of ‘stoking white supremacy’ in 2020 – would ditch her fellow Chiefs WAG. One wrote on X: ‘Well it looks like Brittany can forget posting up with Taylor Swift in the skyboxes from now on. Could seriously strain their tik tok relationship’. Another posted: ‘This season is gonna be awkward in the stadium suites with Brittany and Taylor Swift.’ While one quipped: ‘Brittany Mahomes….Taylor Swift is never ever getting back together with you.’ However, it appears Brittany won’t be facing any bad Karma for her social media activity from her famous pal with the songstress seemingly able to shake it off. Brittany isn’t the only high-profile NFL-affiliated personality to potentially endorse Trump, as the former President was spotted with two players on the Raiders on Friday. Former NFL running back Herschel Walker, best remembered for his playing days on the Dallas Cowboys in the mid-to-late 1980’s, is also a Trump fan. Walker served as a co-chair on the President’s Council on Sports, Fitness and Nutrition under the Trump administration. Bengals quarterback Joe Burrow and 49ers defensive end Nick Bosa were blasted in March for hanging out with Trump at UFC 299, as well. Brittany, who’s come under fire among the NFL fandom community in the past for being outspoken, was praised for her like on Trump’s post by the former President’s supporters on X. She was also bashed by Democrat-leaning balloters, however.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nAny speculation of bad blood between Taylor Swift and her gameday bestie&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Taylor Swift and Brittany Mahomes reunite in Rhode Island, dispelling concerns of a conflict following a controversial post about Donald Trump. first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/news/us/taylor-swift-and-brittany-mahomes-reunite-in-rhode-island-dispelling-concerns-of-a-conflict-following-a-controversial-post-about-donald-trump/","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2024/08/24/20/88895811-0-Travis_Kelce_R_and_Taylor_Swift_C_sit_with_Patrick_Mahomes_on_th-a-1_1724529500037.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-08-24 21:07:03","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.586},{"id":254851142,"title":"Brittany Mahomes hits back at haters amid uproar over liking Trump’s Instagram","text":"Brittany Mahomes is clapping back at her haters after she received backlash for liking one of former president Donald Trump’s posts on Instagram. On August 13, the 78-year-old, who was charged and convicted on 34 counts of falsification of business records in the first degree, took to his social media page to promote his campaign as the Republican candidate in the 2024 presidential election. Trump shared an overview of his “GOP Platform,” engaging his supporters and one celebrity. Brittany, wife of the Kansas City Chiefs quarterback, Patrick Mahomes, was one of Trump’s viewers who liked the Instagram post. Eagle-eyed netizens saw the 28-year-old mother’s Instagram handle pop up next to the number of people who favorited the post. The famed Chiefs WAG was immediately called out by a slew of internet users, some criticizing her for seemingly supporting Trump’s 13-point proposal. Outraged women questioned her motives, while others admitted they weren’t surprised she was rallying for the Trump campaign. A few thought her actions could negatively impact her friendship with Taylor Swift, the Grammy-winning artist who has publicly condemned Trump. “Well it looks like Brittany can forget posting up with Taylor Swift in the skyboxes from now on. Could seriously strain their tik tok relationship,” one X, formerly known as Twitter, user wrote. A second agreed: “Brittany Mahomes....Taylor Swift is never ever getting back together with you.” Amid the blunt backlash, Brittany issued a statement, slamming all the adults who had it in their hearts to send hate. “I mean honestly, to be a hater as an adult you have to have some deep-rooted issues you refuse to heal from childhood,” she wrote on her Instagram story on August 23. “There’s no reason your brain is fully developed and you hate to see others doing well.” This isn’t the first time Brittany has been the target of online criticism. The former soccer player has been accused of photoshopping her appearance in photos. Her May 10 photo dump on Instagram was met with several crude comments. “Photoshopped to Hell and back, lol,” one harsh viewer wrote. A second added: “Photoshopped to DEATH.” What’s more, when Brittany announced her Sports Illustrated Swimsuit debut in February 2024, her followers took the opportunity to write unfiltered comments about the magazine’s decision to use her as a model. However, with all the hate, Brittany’s supporters have continuously expressed their loyalty, appreciation, and awe of her by defending her against the backlash. On her May 14 sneak peek Sports Illustrated Swimsuit shoot post on Instagram, one kind-hearted woman said: “When you can be a working mom, wife and still look this amazing. “And it’s not even all about how amazing you look but how your confidence really show in these pics which is inspiring. To feel beautiful in our own skin. Confidence is a beautiful thing. Keep slaying Britt,” she added.","summary":"‘I mean honestly, to be a hater as an adult you have to have some deep-rooted issues,’ Brittany writes","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/brittany-mahomes-trump-instagram-haters-b2601418.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2024/07/12/19/newFile-1.jpg?width=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-08-24 21:04:50","author":"Kaleigh Werner","authors":["Kaleigh Werner"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":0.212},{"id":254850990,"title":"Donald Trump Accused of New Federal Crime as He Cozies Up to RFK Jr.","text":"Former President Donald Trump has been accused of a new federal crime by social media users who claim that he promised former independent presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. a position in his administration if he's reelected for his endorsement.On Friday, Kennedy Jr. dropped out of the race and endorsed Trump, the GOP presidential nominee. Later that night, he joined Trump at a campaign rally in Glendale, Arizona.During his speech, Kennedy Jr. mentioned the issues that he and Trump agree on such as \"having safe food and ending the chronic disease epidemic,\" ending the Russia-Ukraine war, free speech and rebuilding the middle class.Before Kennedy Jr. dropped out of the race, there were reports that he met with Trump and attempted to meet with Vice President Kamala Harris, now the Democratic presidential nominee, about his political future.The Washington Post reported in July that Kennedy Jr. spoke with Trump about endorsing the former president and taking a job his administration if he wins in November, according to people familiar with the matter. Kennedy Jr.'s campaign confirmed that he met with Trump \"to discuss national unity\" but didn't go into the specifics of the meeting.Meanwhile, Kennedy Jr.'s campaign officials told the Post in an August 14 report that he sought a meeting with Harris the week before to discuss a possible role in her administration if he supported her. The report said that the vice president did not show any interest in meeting with Kennedy Jr., according to people familiar with the matter.When he announced that he would drop out and endorse Trump, Kennedy Jr. said that the former president had \"asked to enlist me in his administration,\" but did not specify what role he may be given.On Tuesday, Trump told CNN that he \"probably would\" consider appointing Kennedy Jr. to a role in his administration if he wins the presidential race later this year.Trump has not been charged with any new crimes and neither he nor Kennedy Jr. has admitted to this alleged quid pro quo exchange. Newsweek reached out to Trump's campaign and Kennedy Jr.'s former campaign via email for comment on Saturday afternoon.Some people on X, formerly Twitter, accused Trump of illegally offering Kennedy Jr. a job in his administration for the former independent candidates' support.\"Oh, by the way, it is a FEDERAL CRIME to promise a post in an administration in exchange for a candidate endorsement. So of course convicted felon Donald Trump got RFK Jr. to endorse him.

We have a very different [U.S. Supreme] Court now than we had when marriage equality became the law of the land in 2015. We've lost three judges who ruled in the majority on that case.

The riot erupted following claims from Trump that the election had been stolen from him via widespread voter fraud. Despite there being no evidence to back up his claims, Trump's allies have continued to spread the same claims.\"I think it is probably his number one strategy...I think that what we saw in 2020, it is going to pale in comparison to what we are likely going to see in 2024 and, again, it is not my job to decide winners or losers. It is my job to defend the will of the people, whatever that might be. But I can tell you this: if the will of the people here in Michigan is that they support Kamala Harris as our next president of the United States, it is going to be tough,\" Nessel said.She added: \"I don't think anybody should underestimate how hard we are going to have to fight to defend people's votes against an effort by the Trump campaign to subvert democracy here in Michigan and likely in states all across the nation.\"Nessel announced felony charges against 16 Republicans \"for their role in the alleged false electors scheme\" in July 2023, accusing them of submitting false certificates that portrayed them as legitimate electors in the 2020 election, which saw Biden winning the state by more than 154,000 votes. Nessel has said all 16 people would face eight criminal charges, including forgery, conspiracy to commit election law forgery, and uttering and publishing. The top charges carry a maximum penalty of 14 years in prison.More than a year later, the case still continues as preliminary examinations concluded earlier this month for six of the individuals charged with examinations for six others charged in the case that concluded in April.According to the Detroit Free Press, after all preliminary exams are completed, district Judge Kristen Simmons is expected to rule on whether there is sufficient evidence to send 12 of the people charged to a jury trial.

Haley, who ran against Trump for the Republican presidential nomination, told reporters in the capital, Taipei, that supporting U.S. allies, including Ukraine and Israel, is vital. She underscored the importance of Taiwan, which Beijing claims as its territory, to be brought under control by force if necessary. “I don’t think the isolationist approach is healthy. I think America can never sit in a bubble and think that we won’t be affected,” she said. While the U.S. doesn’t formally recognize Taiwan, it is the island’s strongest backer and main arms provider. However, Trump’s attempt to reclaim the presidency has fueled worries. He said Taiwan should pay for U.S. protection in an interview with Bloomberg Businessweek published in July and dodged answering the question of whether he would defend the island against a possible Chinese military action. When Haley shuttered her own bid for the Republican nomination, she did not immediately endorse Trump, having accused him of causing chaos and disregarding the importance of U.S. alliances abroad. But in May she said she would be voting for him, while making it clear that she felt her former boss had work to do to win over voters who supported her. On Saturday, she spoke in Trump's favor. She said that having previously served with Trump's administration, “we did show American strength in the world,\" pointing to their pushback against China and their sanctioning of Russia and North Korea, among other efforts. “I think that all of that strength that we showed is the reason that we didn’t see any wars, we didn’t see any invasions, we didn’t see any harm that happened during that time. I think Donald Trump would bring that back,” she said. Trump has claimed that if elected, he would end the conflict in Ukraine before Inauguration Day in January. But Russia’s United Nations ambassador said he can’t. Trump’s public comments have varied between criticizing U.S. backing for Ukraine’s defense and supporting it, while his running mate, Sen. JD Vance, has been a leader of Republican efforts to block what have been billions in U.S. military and financial assistance to Ukraine since Russia invaded in 2022. Concerns among Ukraine and its supporters that the country could lose vital U.S. support have increased as Trump’s campaign surged. Haley criticized Trump's rival, U.S. Vice President Kamala Harris, saying she would “do exactly” what President Joe Biden had done. She said Harris was part of his administration when the Taliban took over Afghanistan in 2021, when Russia invaded Ukraine in 2022 and when the Hamas-Israel war broke out last year. “She was in the situation room right next to Joe Biden. She was there making the exact same decisions. Those decisions have made the world less safe,” she said. Haley added that while the Republicans and Democrats may not currently concur on much, they agree on “the threats of China,” adding that Taiwan is now looking “to make sure that if China starts a fight with them, that they are prepared to make sure that they can fight back.” She said her party should stand with the country's allies and make sure that U.S. shows strength around the world. She also said any authoritarian regime and “communists” harming or hurting other free countries should be a personal matter to the U.S. “We don’t want to see communist China win. We don’t want to see Russia win. We don’t want to see Iran or North Korea win,” she said. Haley met Taiwanese President Lai Ching-te during this week's trip. She called for more international backing for the self-ruled island, a coordinated pushback against China’s claims over it, and for Taiwan to become a full member of the United Nations. Taiwan's Defense Ministry said Saturday that 38 warplanes and 12 vessels from China were detected around the island during a 24-hour period from Friday morning. Thirty-two of the planes crossed the middle of the line of the Taiwan Strait, an unofficial boundary that’s considered a buffer between the island and mainland. © Copyright 2024 The Associated Press.

The song was originally released by the US rock band – made up of Dave Grohl, Nate Mendel, Chris Shiflett and Pat Smear, Rami Jaffee, and Josh Freese – in 1997 and has become the latest tune to land Trump in hot water. It was played at an Arizona rally on Friday to introduce wildcard Robert F. Kennedy Jr. onto stage after he suspended his independent candidacy and endorsed Donald Trump as the Republican nominee and hopeful to win the US election. When asked on social media if the band had given permission for its use, the account decisively replied: ‘No’. A statement later issued to PA confirmed: ‘Foo Fighters were not asked permission, and if they were they would not have granted it.’ Representatives for the band later followed up with Billboard to add that ‘appropriate actions are being taken’ and that any royalties received as a result of this usage will be donated to the Harris/Walz campaign.

The nephew of the US’s 35th president, John F Kennedy, said he has been a Democrat since birth but has accused the party of ‘abandoning democracy’ and embarking on unjust ‘legal warfare’ against him and Trump. This is far from the first time the Republican presidential hopeful has faced issues for unauthorised music use. In the past few weeks alone, it has been reported that Beyonce threatened the Trump campaign with a cease-and-desist letter after her song Freedom was used in a 13-second social media video. The Foo Fighters are one of many artists to have complained about Trump’s song usage (Picture: Getty) The clip, uploaded by Trump spokesperson Steven Cheung, showed the Republican nominee deplaning in Michigan overlayed by the singer’s Lemonade hit and has since been deleted.

Sullivan will travel to Beijing from August 27 to 29 in the first visit by a US national security adviser to China since 2016, although other senior officials including Secretary of State Antony Blinken have visited over the past two years. The visit comes months ahead of US elections in November. The Democratic presidential nominee, Vice President Kamala Harris, would be expected, if she wins, to continue Biden’s approach of seeking dialogue with China while also maintaining pressure. Her Republican rival Donald Trump has vowed, at least rhetorically, to take a harder line, with some of his aides seeing a far-reaching global showdown with China. A senior US official told reporters that the Biden administration’s engagement with China did not indicate any softening of approach and that it continued to believe that “this is an intensely competitive relationship.” “We are committed to making the investments, strengthening our alliances, and taking the common steps on tech and national security that we need to take,” the official said, referring to sweeping restrictions on US technology transfers to China imposed under Biden. “We are committed to managing this competition responsibly, however, and preventing it from veering into conflict,” she added, speaking on customary condition of anonymity. A key area of friction has been Taiwan, the self-ruling democracy which Beijing considers its territory and has not ruled out “reuniting” through force. China has kept up its saber-rattling since the inauguration this year of President Lai Ching-te, whose party emphasises Taiwan’s separate identity. “We’re going to raise concern about the PRC’s increased military, diplomatic and economic pressure in Taiwan,” the administration official said, referring to the People’s Republic of China. “These activities are destabilising, risk escalation, and we’re going to continue to urge Beijing to engage in meaningful dialogue with Taipei,” she said. The official said Sullivan would also discuss the South China Sea, where tension has been rising between China and US ally the Philippines. Key role The official did not indicate that the United States expected breakthroughs on the trip, in which Sullivan will meet with China’s foreign policy supremo Wang Yi. The official said Sullivan will reiterate US concerns about China’s support for Russia in its major expansion of its defense industry since the Ukraine invasion. Beijing counters that, unlike the United States, it does not directly give weapons to either side. China has historically been eager to work with US national security advisers, seeing them as decision-makers close to the president who can negotiate away from the media spotlight that comes with the secretary of state or top leadership. The modern US-China relationship was launched when Henry Kissinger, then national security adviser to Richard Nixon, secretly visited Beijing in 1971 to lay the groundwork for normalisation of relations with the communist state. Sullivan and Wang have met four times over the last year and a half — once in Washington and the other times in Vienna, Malta and Bangkok — as well as alongside Biden and President Xi Jinping at their November summit in California. The meetings between Wang and Sullivan were sometimes announced only after they were finished and the two had spent long hours together behind closed doors. Sullivan will also speak to Wang about North Korea and the Middle East. China has criticised US support for Israel, and the United States has sought to call Beijing’s bluff by urging it to use its relations to rein in Iran.","summary":" \n\n\nWASHINGTON — Jake Sullivan, President Joe Biden’s national security adviser, will visit China next week in a new bid to manage tensions months before US elections, the White House said on Friday.\n\n\nSullivan will travel to Beijing from August 27 to 29 in the first visit by a US national security adviser to China since 2016, although other senior officials including Secretary of State Antony Blinken have visited over the past two years.\n\n\nThe visit comes months ahead of US elections in November.

Famous for his sharp wit and biting political humor, Meyers decided to pull back the curtain on some of the rejected material from his writing team– and let’s just say it was downright filthy. On a recent episode, Meyers revealed, “I’m going to read some real jokes, really submitted by my writers. Some are dumb, some are offensive, some are just insane. Most importantly, my writers don’t know we’re doing this, and because they don’t watch the show, they’ll never know.” As per HuffPost, Vance wasn’t the only politician to find themselves in Meyer’s comedic crosshairs that night. Meyers also shared a rejected joke about former President Bill Clinton, whose 78th birthday was a while ago. He said, “According to a new analysis, the Republican policy blueprint Project 2025 would cause a surge in emissions like JD Vance when he sees a couch. That joke doesn’t work because it’s not true…Today was former President Bill Clinton’s 78th birthday, so now it’s some candles’ turn to get blown.” Meyers has a history of poking fun at Vance, especially following the senator’s surprising alliance with Donald Trump. Meyers quipped, “Damn! If he can say all that and still get picked for vice president, I figure I got a chance for secretary of state at least…I’m in the mix….Look at this guy. He looks like the politician in a sci-fi movie who’s secretly working with the aliens…He looks like a Funko Pop! Doll of himself. He looks like Teen Wolf graduated and came back to coach the team,” as reported by The Independent. Once a staunch critic of Trump, Vance has done a political 180, becoming one of the former president’s most vocal supporters. Vance once said, “I go back and forth between thinking Trump might be a cynical a**hole like [Richard] Nixon who wouldn’t be that bad (and might even prove useful) or that he might be America’s Hitler.” Moreover, he also claimed back then, “I’m a ‘Never Trump’ guy. I never liked him. As somebody who doesn’t like Trump, myself, I sort of — I understand where Trump’s voters come from,” Vance later said. “But I also don’t like Trump himself, and that made me realize that maybe I’m not quite part of either world totally.” However, he later apologized and said, “ Yeah, well, I think the simple answer is you’ve gotta respect the American people enough to just level with them. Look, I was wrong about Donald Trump. I didn’t think he was gonna be a good president, Bret. He was a great president. And it’s one of the reasons why I’m working so hard to make sure he gets a second term. I think you should – when you’re wrong about something – you should change your mind and be honest with people about that fact.”","summary":"Meyers said, “Damn!

At a rally in Alaska, Trump claimed that Musk had falsely denied voting for a Republican candidate, saying, \"You know, he said the other day, 'Oh, I've never voted for a Republican.'

The “Cruel Summer” singer and her NFL boyfriend were pictured on the balcony of her $17 million Rhode Island beach house on Saturday. In photos obtained by the Daily Mail, Swift and the Kansas City Chiefs tight end, both 34, can be seen having fun with friends and family, including quarterback Patrick Mahomes and his son, Bronze. Kelce’s sister-in-law, Kylie Kelce, and niece were also spotted on the mansion’s balcony. Travis’ brother, Jason Kelce, and Patrick’s wife, Brittany Mahomes, were also present, according to the Daily Mail. Though, they were not seen in photos. With Swift recently wrapping the European leg of her Eras Tour and Travis’ NFL season quickly approaching, the couple appears to be taking advantage of the brief time off they have together. “He has a long weekend break. [The Chiefs] were off yesterday, today and tomorrow, but he won’t be staying long. [He and Patrick] to be back tomorrow night for a Monday morning meeting with the team,” a source close to the NFL told Page Six exclusively. Brittany’s presence comes at an interesting time — just hours before these photos surfaced, she faced backlash for “liking” a post of Donald Trump’s on Instagram. Swift, of course, has not yet publicly backed either Kamala Harris or Trump ahead of November’s election, but she previously endorsed President Joe Biden in 2020. Following Brittany’s “like,” fans of the singer started speculating that the incident might cause some tension in their friendship. However, her attendance at Swift’s Rhode Island mansion seems to suggest that won’t be the case. This fun-filled get together comes a little over one year after Swift and Travis started dating. The last time they were seen together was in Germany, following her Eras Tour show on July 18. He wrapped his arm around her waist as they exited a venue together. Since then, they’ve been pretty busy. She was performing across Europe and he was training with the Chiefs. She’s now off until early October, while the Chiefs’ opening game against the Baltimore Ravens will take place on Sept. 5.","summary":"Swift and the Kansas City Chiefs tight end were spotted having fun with friends and family, including Patrick and Brittany Mahomes.","url":"https://pagesix.com/2024/08/24/celebrity-news/taylor-swift-and-travis-kelce-pictured-at-her-17m-rhode-island-mansion/","image":"https://pagesix.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/08/88250952.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-08-24 20:34:09","author":"Chris Rogers,Eileen Reslen","authors":["Chris Rogers","Eileen Reslen"],"language":"en","catgory":"entertainment","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.141},{"id":254851404,"title":"Trump’s Biggest Critic, Niece Mary Has an Empowering Message for Kamala Harris Post DNC Speech","text":"Mary Trump, the outspoken rival of her uncle- presidential candidate Donald Trump, was present at the four-day Democratic National Convention in Chicago, Illinois. She also posted a brief social media message endorsing Vice President Kamala Harris' acceptance speech. She penned on X, \"We are witnessing history tonight. #DNC2024.\" In another X post, she demonstrated her unwavering support for Harris by remarking, \"Kamala has been part of the best administration of my lifetime. Now let’s nominate her for President of the United States of America.\" A third tweet characterized the opening night of the convention as 'incredible'. She shared a picture of the United Centre and captioned the same, \"We're not going back!\" alluding to Donald's first and so far only term as POTUS. In another statement she made on Tuesday, she gushed, \"I have never been more proud to be a Democrat than this week.\" In the lead-up to the debate in early September, Mary has also offered Harris some advice, including the suggestion that she draw on her experience as a prosecutor. As reported by USA Today, she opined, \"Honestly, my advice to her would be to keep doing what you're doing. I think the setup of the prosecutor versus the criminal is right in her wheelhouse, but she has also proven not to be afraid to mock Donald because he deserves our mockery. I like the fact that she refers to him as Donald because he doesn't deserve anybody's respect at this point, and she will not let him get away with lying repeatedly.\" Additionally, she also argued that Harris should focus on discrediting the president's lies rather than outlining her policies. \"I think she [Harris] needs to understand that she is going to have to do the job of fact-checking in real time and should focus more on uncovering Donald Trump's nonsense by refuting his lies and underscoring just how dangerous his vision for America is, and not worry so much about outlining the Democratic party's policy positions. It will be the first time a lot of the American people actually see what a petty, small, insecure, and weak man Donald Trump really is.\" Much to Mary's delight, Harris in her DNC speech did precisely that— cautioned that the former president's docile demeanor concealed a grave danger to the American people. As reported by Deadline, she stated, \"Just imagine Donald Trump with no guardrails. In many ways, Donald Trump is an unserious man, but the consequences of putting Donald Trump back in the White House are extremely serious.\" Not to be outdone, Donald too took to Truth Social to respond with several posts. He mocked Harris' speech and shared it on his platform, \"Too many 'Thank yous', too rapidly said, what’s going on with her?\" In yet another post he stated, \"A lot of talk about childhood, we’ve got to get to the Border, Inflation, and Crime!\" The former president contacted conservative news outlets Fox News and Newsmax to share his thoughts shortly after Harris finished speaking. He stated, \"I personally thought it was a terrible speech. It was very nonspecific. It was also very short. She just wanted to get off the stage, because her ideas are bad.\"","summary":"In the lead-up to the debate in September, Mary also offered Harris advice that she draw on her experience as a prosecutor.","url":"https://www.inquisitr.com/trumps-biggest-critic-niece-mary-has-an-empowering-message-for-kamala-harris-post-dnc-speech","image":"https://dab57h0r8ahff.cloudfront.net/712338/uploads/eafeade0-6211-11ef-b3c1-276cd424e4dc_1200_630.jpeg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-08-24 20:30:21","author":"INQUISITR,Priyanka Pandey","authors":["INQUISITR","Priyanka Pandey"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.064},{"id":254852488,"title":"Szijjarto: Hungary must be ready for serious attacks against sovereign foreign policy","text":"Protecting Hungary’s sovereignty is not a “question of political ideology”, but a “matter of life and death”, Szijjarto said. He said Hungary’s insistence on protecting its sovereignty had become the “antithesis of the liberal mainstream” and pointed to the range of means the liberal mainstream had adopted to squeeze out any other way of thinking, including political, legal and economic tools, and most recently “physical destruction” as in the case of the assassination attempts against Slovak Prime Minister Robert Fico and the candidate for president of the United States Donald Trump. Szijjarto said Hungary had been able to keep its foreign policy focused on serving the interests of the Hungarian nation in recent years, while preventing the validation of external interests in Hungary, but he warned that the country needed to be ready for attacks on its political, physical, energy and economic security in the coming years. He pointed to the international media and financing for NGOs, as well as procedures launched by Brussels and, most recently, an attack on new rules concerning Hungary’s National Card scheme providing residency for non-EU nationals. He noted that just 7,000 Russian nationals were residing in Hungary, while 20 times that number were in the Baltic states and the total for the whole EU stood over 1 million. He said the recently established Patriots for Europe group in the European Parliament could act as a “line of defence” for Hungary’s political security. In spite of the West’s pressure on Hungary to deliver weapons to Ukraine and train troops, the country has become the “last obstacle for wartime psychosis”, he said, adding that Hungary’s pro-peace stand would come under “extraordinary pressure” in September and October. Szijjarto called out other countries’ “hypocrisy” for finding ways to buy Russian energy on the sly, while treating energy policy as a matter of ideology rather than physical reality. He said the European Commission’s rejection of Hungary and Slovakia’s request to take action against Ukraine for halting transit deliveries of Russian crude from Lukoil was “proof” that Brussels had instructed Ukraine’s government to take the step in the first place. He said a long-term solution that would ensure the continued deliveries of the Russian crude in the long term was “very close”. Addressing the EU’s reaction to the destruction of the Nord Stream pipeline, Szijjarto said that, if a state had been involved, it should be treated as “state-sponsored terrorism” and was deserving of a “proportionate response”. Touching on economic security, he said Hungary was “open and honest” about what other countries tried to “do in secret”, adding that attempts to isolate the economies of the West from those of the East were a “total failure”. He urged Hungary’s “Polish brothers” to lay off the criticism when the country’s oil company was still buying Russian crude, via circuitous routes, lifting bilateral trade between the two countries to 6 billion euros last year.","summary":"You must be logged into the site to view this content.","url":"https://www.budapesttimes.hu/hungary/szijjarto-hungary-must-be-ready-for-serious-attacks-against-sovereign-foreign-policy/","image":"https://www.budapesttimes.hu/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/szijjarto_nato_02_fb.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-08-24 20:28:07","author":"Attila Leitner","authors":["Attila Leitner"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"hu","sentiment":0.003},{"id":254849460,"title":"Rep.

As someone who spent nearly two decades in the New Jersey state legislature as a Democrat before moving to the United States Congress, I have had a front-row seat to the drastic changes within the party over the years. When I first entered politics, the Democratic Party was dedicated to standing up for the working class. We were focused on fairness and supporting those who needed it most. Regardless of differences between the political parties, we all still believed that the Democratic Party leadership loved America and saw it as the best nation on the face of the earth. This is no longer true. Over the years, the party has veered off its original course. Instead of championing the needs of everyday Americans, it now seems to be driven more by corporate interests and big donors. The policies coming out of the party often favor the wealthy, leaving hardworking average Americans behind. As elected representatives of the people of America, it is our privilege and our duty to serve in their interests. The Democratic Party has failed to do this time and time again. Today, their policies favor big corporations at the expense of American workers and small businesses. Trade deals and economic policies that once aimed to support local businesses now often prioritize the interests of multinational companies. They choose to rely on foreign entities for energy rather than bring energy dependence back home to America, putting jobs and our national energy security at risk. CONGRESSMAN WHO LEFT DEMOCRATS BLISTERS BIDEN ADMIN AS ‘WORST IN AMERICAN HISTORY’ Internationally, the Democratic Party's lack of decisive leadership has weakened our global standing, emboldened adversaries, and neglected crucial allies. Domestically, the Biden-Harris administration has led to unprecedented economic strain since they took office, with inflation up almost 21% and Americans spending $13,000 more annually on basics. Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s move to denounce the Democratic Party and endorse Donald Trump should serve as a wake-up call to their leadership that there is a need for substantial change. As a legacy Democrat, RFK’s choice to prioritize the country over party loyalty shows just how far the party has drifted from its core values. His stance reflects the growing sentiment among Americans that the Democratic Party no longer aligns with the nation’s needs. CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION I saw a similar sentiment when I ran against Ted Kennedy’s daughter-in-law, Amy Kennedy, in 2020. Despite having her family’s substantial backing and resources, she couldn’t overcome the growing frustration among voters. People in South Jersey were fed up with the direction the Democratic Party had taken. They were looking for a change, a departure from the status quo that the party had come to represent. Americans across the nation are tired of the new burdens they bear under this administration. Look at our nation’s current state: rising illegal border crossings that have led to tragic loss of innocent life, and an economy struggling under the weight of rampant inflation. The Democratic Party’s responses to these critical issues have been underwhelming at best. Vice President Kamala Harris’s recent speech at the Democratic National Convention, filled with lofty promises and goals, rings hollow when weighed against nearly four years of inaction and failure to address pressing concerns.

She said, “Trust Donald Trump and JD Vance to look out for your family? Shoot, I wouldn’t trust them to move my couch.” As Warren took the stage, the energy in the United Arena was electric. The crowd’s applause was deafening, with Warren taking a moment to soak in the overwhelming support. Dressed in her signature blue, the senator was visibly pleased as she mouthed ‘thank you’ to the cheering crowd. She remarked, “You know what I love best about Kamala Harris? Kamala Harris can’t be bought— and she can’t be bossed around. You know what else I love about Kamala? She gets it. We need to make life more affordable for working people,” as reported by the Daily Mail.

Donald Trump, the felon, has no plans to lower costs for families. He doesn’t know how, and basically, he doesn’t really care. When did he ever fill up a gas tank or worry about a grocery bill? The only bills he worries about are from his criminal defense lawyers.” Warren was not the only one to roast Trump at the DNC convention. President Joe Biden didn’t mince words either when he stressed, “Yet, I believe then and I believe now, that progress was and is possible. Justice is achievable, and our best days are not behind us. They are before us…With a grateful heart, I stand before you now on this August night to report that democracy has prevailed. Democracy has delivered, and now democracy must be preserved. I hope you know how grateful I am to all of you. Giving my word as a Biden, I can honestly say I’m more optimistic about the future than I was when I was elected as a 29-year-old United States senator.” He further added, “Violent crime has dropped to the lowest level of more than 50 years, and crime will keep coming down when we put a prosecutor in the Oval Office instead of a convicted felon.

But it also featured one unusual standout element for such a massive blue celebration: Republicans. Between remarks from the most beloved and powerful Democrats in the country over four days was a parade of current and former Republicans all speaking in support of Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris. ‘If you vote for Kamala Harris in 2024, you’re not a Democrat, you’re a patriot,’ declared former Republican Georgia Lt. Governor Geoff Duncan taking the stage at the DNC to wild cheering. Former national security official in the Trump White House Olivia Troye said in her remarks ‘you’re aren’t voting for a Democrat, you’re voting for democracy.’ Former GOP Congressman Adam Kinzinger declared Democrats ‘love this country just as much as we do’ as the crowd chanted ‘USA!’ And former top Melania Trump aide and White House press secretary Stephanie Grisham claimed Trump calls his supporters ‘basement dwellers’ behind closed doors. Republican strategist Kevin Madden said the speakers themselves won’t have a major impact because few voters know who they are, but he believes ‘they are an avatar for a lot of Republicans who describe themselves as “conscientious objectors” to Trump’s vision of their party.’ ‘There are enough of them in battleground states to make a difference,’ Madden said. The Harris campaign has been making a concerted effort to engage Republican and Independent voters ready to reject the former Republican president and have recruited Republicans to help. It was on full display at the United Center in Chicago and a stark contrast from the Republican National Convention a month earlier where no Democrats took the stage in Milwaukee. After her speech, Grisham said she was terrified to make an appearance at the DNC but that everyone was welcoming. She said even if it only changes the minds of just a few Republicans and Independents, her appearance would have been worth it. ‘The winning strategy for Kamala Harris is to reanimate and remobilize the anti-Trump coalition that defeated Donald Trump in 2020 and in that coalition on the margins are the center right swing voters who have historically identified as Republicans,’ said John Conway from Republicans Voters against Trump. He argued the inclusion gave others ‘permission’ to vote blue. Conway’s group has been conducting focus groups and outreach to such voters and noted the convention did not just include ‘elite’ Republicans but everyday GOP voters. Throughout the four day event were a series of videos featuring former Trump voters playing on big screen as millions of Americans tuned in to the convention from home. Former Trump voter Kyle Sweetser, a Republican from Alabama, also walked on stage and shared that he was voting for a Democrat for the first time in his life in front of thousands of Democrats. ‘I feel more at home here than in today’s Republican party,’ said John Giles, GOP Mayor of Mesa, Arizona, who also spoke at a recent Harris rally in his battleground state. Giles invoked late Republican Senator and GOP presidential nominee John McCain during his speech when he declared ‘Country First.’ The push to flip Republicans started while Biden was still running for reelection. The Biden-Harris campaign jumped on welcoming dejected Nikki Haley primary voters into the fold as Trump attacked her candidacy earlier this year. Haley has since announced she would vote for Trump but that has not stopped Democrats from seeking support from her voters. In June, the campaign announced the addition of a full-time National Republican Engagement Director dedicated to furthering outreach to Independents and moderate Republicans. Virginian Austin Weatherford was the former chief of staff for Kinzinger with 25 years of GOP political experience. He said the convention programming was just a latest effort to ‘reach out to anti-Trump Republicans,’ and they will continue to remind Republican and Independent voters ‘Donald Trump doesn’t represent their values.’ The campaign has also been regularly in touch with GOP leaders and organizations that want to combat Trump’s vision for the country, according to a campaign official and will continue to work behind the scenes to help secure support. It has spent more than seven figures on ads targeting swing voters and earlier this month launched Republicans for Harris, a grassroots program to conduct outreach efforts to millions of GOP voters. Critics have questioned whether convention organizers should have given so much time to Republicans during the event. Some of the speakers acknowledged they were still Republicans and didn’t agree with Harris on policy. Questions have also been raised over whether the GOP voters who split for Biden in 2020 would also vote for the vice president, a black woman who ran to the left of Biden in the 2020 primary and Republicans have attacked as more liberal. But Conway’s research has found those Republican voters who broke for Biden in 2020 had more concerns about the president than the vice president heading into November. ‘It was clear that Joe Biden was facing issues from these voters, but those were Joe Biden specific problems,’ he said. Conway said they really ‘saw the bottom drop out’ after the president’s disastrous June debate, but with Harris at the top of the ticket, they’ve seen a ‘sharp rebound’ with Harris at the top of the ticket including among 2016 Trump, 2020 Biden voters.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nThe Democratic National Convention had the usual political fanfare from prominent Democrats&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Can Democrats successfully persuade anti-Trump Republicans to support Kamala Harris? first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/news/us/can-democrats-successfully-persuade-anti-trump-republicans-to-support-kamala-harris/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/rewrite-this-title-Democrats-are-desperately-trying-to-flip-Republican.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-08-24 20:04:51","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.184},{"id":254848864,"title":"Liberal media outlets melt down over RFK Jr. endorsing Trump: ‘Betrays the Kennedy legacy’","text":"Multiple mainstream media outlets launched an assault on Independent presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. after he announced the suspension of his campaign and his endorsement of former President Trump. Outlets like CNN sounded the alarm that Kennedy’s flip to Trump will significantly help the former president’s re-election campaign, while others like the Washington Post and Politico published entire pieces simply belittling the candidate. \"By endorsing Trump, RFK Jr. betrays the Kennedy legacy,\" blasted the headline to Washington Post associate editor and columnist Karen Tumulty's opinion piece. ROBERT F. KENNEDY JR. LAMBASTS ‘DNC-ALIGNED MAINSTREAM MEDIA,’ ACCUSES THEM OF ENGINEERING HARRIS' RISE Kennedy announced his decision at a press conference in Phoenix on Friday, telling reporters, \"I've made the heart-wrenching decision to suspend my campaign and to support President Trump. This decision is agonizing for me because of the difficulties it causes me, and my children and my friends.\" The candidate accused the Democratic Party of waging \"continual legal warfare against both President Trump and myself,\" and running \"a sham\" Democratic primary election that he said prevented him from having a fair shot at the White House. He also called out the media, saying its \"censorship\" of his campaign contributed to the evaporation of his path to the White House. The Post’s Tumulty punished Kennedy with a searing column about how he has betrayed his family’s legacy throughout his life and has stayed true to form with this decision. \"His bizarre campaign for president this year — with its revelations that he had a dead worm in his brain and once left the carcass of a bear cub in Central Park — was an embarrassment. But his announcement on Friday that he would ‘throw my support’ to Donald Trump in battleground states represents a betrayal of a higher order.\" She continued, writing, \"Yet in casting his lot with a former president who preaches intolerance and division, he has cast aside the principles for which generations of Kennedys have stood.\" BIDEN TAKES ROLE AS BYSTANDER ON BORDER AND CAMPUS PROTESTS, SURRENDERS THE BULLY PULPIT The Post columnist Alexandra Petri mocked Kennedy with a satirical column written from the perspective of the parasite that the candidate said a doctor told he had living in his head at one point. She wrote on Friday, \"I say now what I have said this whole campaign: I am a parasite and I do not have the country’s best interests at heart. So it is clear to me now that I have no choice but to drop out of the race and support Donald Trump.\" Politico couldn’t resist the abject mockery, publishing a listicle of the \"7 weirdest moments from RFK Jr.’s long-shot campaign\" that same day. Among them, Politico listed his story about the brain parasite as one weird moment, the X post he wrote in July where he said he said he wasn’t sure \"what is a conspiracy theory and what isn't\" regarding 9/11, and the time he produced a debate between him and President and Biden and Trump that involved him pausing the televised CNN presidential debate in June to give his answers. Cable TV pundits ripped Kennedy as well, though they also pointed out that his endorsement of Trump will hurt the Democratic Party in November. Appearing on his old network, former MSNBC host Mehdi Hasan told network host Ari Melber, \"I didn't think that he was a big threat to Trump. He was a threat to Democrats because he was pulling voters away from Trump because he’s an anti-vaxxer loon, and a lot of the Trump people who thought Trump was not loony enough on vaxes was heading toward RFK Jr.\" CLICK HERE FOR MORE COVERAGE OF MEDIA AND CULTURE \"So actually, whether we like it or not, it is a good thing for Donald Trump that he pulled out and endorsed Trump because Trump gets to have some of those far-right nutty voters come home to him,\" Hasan said, before adding another dig. \"It is ironic to see RFK junior, the independent third-party candidate who’s running against the establishment. who called Trump the worst president of his lifetime, called him sociopathic,now saying, ‘Oh yeah, I’m gonna back this guy for a second term.’\" During that same segment, Melber dinged Kennedy as an \"unserious guy.\" CNN host Erin Burnett’s response to Kennedy’s Trump endorsement didn’t revel in mockery of the independent candidate, but provided a stark warning to the Democratic Party that the endorsement will lower its chances at winning the White House in November. \"The latest swing state polls show Kennedy with five or six percent of the vote,\" Burnett told CNN viewers on Friday evening, adding, \"And so, when you think about it overall, and they say 'Well, that's not a big deal.' Actually, if that is the case in swing states, it is huge. It is everything. It is more than the margin between Harris and Trump in some of those same states.\" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Fox News Digital’s Joseph Wulfsohn contributed to this report.","summary":"Multiple media outlets published pieces and segments trashing Robert F.

You heard it all the time: “Nothing is really working.” And it was sadly true. The same nurses we applauded during Covid despaired at their pay and working conditions. Junior doctors were dreaming of emigrating to Australia. Train strikes lasted for years. Disgruntled public sector workers were everywhere. This was like the Winter of Discontent in Narnia. It felt like the strikes would never end. And we simply could not continue on with walkouts paralysing our nation. But is Labour making the chaos even worse? Even as they were snatching the winter fuel allowance away from ten million pensioners, Labour was still chucking inflation- busting pay deals at train drivers and junior doctors. The argument is that it saves money in the long run because strikes damage the economy. And if giving a UK-trained junior doctor a better wage stops him or her from relocating their made-in-Britain skills to Canada or Australia, then that is true. But there has to be goodwill in return. There has to be a promise that the industrial action is over. Yet how did Aslef’s militant leadership thank Labour for their more than 14 per cent pay offer? By immediately calling for more strikes. “Extremely disappointed,” Keir Starmer’s spokesperson sighed. Not good enough. Starmer should be boiling with rage. His robust response to the far-right riots made him look reassuringly strong. Now he is being humiliated by greedy unions and looks pitifully, pathetically weak. Because walkouts work. Bullying pays. And we all have to tighten our belts, apart from the hatchet-faced union hardmen. Not all strikes are the same. Polls reveal that there is far more public sympathy for nurses than train drivers, and more support for junior doctors than civil servants. But Aslef clearly doesn’t give a toss about the travelling public. And their lavish pay settlement only encourages more public sector unions to lick their lips as they negotiate their ransom demands with Soft Touch Starmer and his team. The aspiration now is of “wage restoration”, making up wages lost to global calamities such as the financial crisis of 2008, Covid and the war in Ukraine. Hardcore comrades As if the public sector unions truly believe they — quite literally — do not live in the same world as the rest of us. And far from seeking to end industrial action, Labour is, unbelievably, going to make it far easier to go on strike. The Trade Union Act of 2016 mandates that 50 per cent of a trade union’s membership must vote for strike action before a walkout, and 40 per cent of “important public services” such as the NHS. This is not anti-union legislation. It is pro-democracy. But in their overhaul of trade union laws, this Labour Government has pledged to repeal the act this autumn, making it far easier for a few hardcore comrades to command “Everybody out!”, as if The Carpenters are still top of the pops. For all the Union Jacks he poses with, is Keir Starmer really a patriotic, pro-business, moderate Prime Minister for all the British people? Not while he bends the knee to the TUC. With inflation-busting pay rises and the repeal of strike legislation, this is a new golden age for the trade unions in the UK. And bugger the rest of us. Who pays? You will. So don’t be self-employed in Labour’s Britain. Don’t be a pensioner. Don’t own your own home. Don’t dream of leaving your children anything. Don’t drive a white van. Don’t run a small business. Don’t run a big business. Don’t employ anyone — you will only regret it. And most of all, do not expect the trains to run on time. Hard to take a smoothie as best Bond HALLE BERRY says Pierce Brosnan “restored my faith in men” when they filmed Die Another Day together in 2002. “He will always be my Bond, always,” she says. That’s lovely. But it was smooth, sensitive, nice Pierce Brosnan that fatally destroyed my faith in 007. No big-screen James Bond was ever so far away from the hardnut hero in Ian Fleming’s books. Apart from Roger Moore, of course. Blake a win with us THE two big hit films of the summer are Alien: Romulus, the latest instalment in the ooh-my-chest-feels-a-bit-funny sci-fi franchise, and It Ends With Us, a romantic drama about domestic abuse starring Blake Lively, based on Colleen Hoover’s bestseller. Both Alien: Romulus and It Ends With Us have earned more than £100million at the global box office. That makes the level of abuse directed at Blake even more remarkable. She stands accused of trivialising the subject matter of It Ends With Us by using interviews to promote her commercial interests, rather than open up the debate about domestic abuse. The film has a glossy, surface sheen. But for all the lingering kisses in beautiful apartments and melting looks in romantic restaurants, It Ends With Us is ultimately about violence against women. Colleen Hoover reportedly based her book on her own parents’ abusive relationship. But Lively is an entrepreneur as well as an actress. At a post-premiere party in New York, her alcohol brands, Betty Booze and Betty Buzz, were served – including a cocktail called Ryle You Wait, named after her character’s abuser. Self-promotion A bit like naming a cocktail after Osama bin Laden. And during an interview on Extra TV in the US, she digressed to plug her haircare range Blake Brown – “iconic hair, every day”. Some see this self-promotion on the back of a film about domestic abuse as wildly inappropriate. So it is worth stating: Blake Lively is really good in It Ends With Us. At the end of the film, the speech she makes to her violent husband when she has their new-born baby daughter in her arms is incredibly moving. It did not make me feel like buying any of Blake’s hair products. But I was glad we gave the aliens a miss. Queen tamed Trump A NEW book about Queen Elizabeth II claims she found President Donald Trump “very rude”. Really? Her Majesty always looked quite cheerful in Trump’s company to me. By the time the Queen first met Trump in 2018, she had encountered many of history’s hard men, dictators, and despots, including Syria’s Bashar al-Assad, Zimbabwe’s Robert Mugabe and Putin. They always looked on their best behaviour in the presence of the most famous woman in the world. And the Queen never looked intimidated. Trump vehemently denies the Queen disliked him. “Totally false”, he thunders. “I heard I was her favourite President. She was a fantastic woman.” I believe him. The Queen met more tyrants than anyone in history. She always looked gloriously at ease. I reckon she could handle Trump’s table manners. ALAIN DELON, the French sex god who has died at 88, has been denied his last wish to be buried with his beloved dog Loubo, a ten-year-old Belgian malinois. Any dog lover can understand Alain’s torment at knowing he would not be around to care for his Loubo. The problem is that Loubo is still very much alive. Nobody would put down a healthy French sex god. So why should anyone put down a healthy dog? NOW Jermaine Jenas is out of the running to succeed Gary Lineker as Match Of The Day host, the bookies have selected new favourites. The predictable names appear – Gaby Logan and Micah Richards (both 7/1) plus Alex Scott (8/1). I nominate Martin Keown for the job. Keown already works as a pundit. There is no ex-footballer anywhere near as articulate, intelligent and eloquent. Whatever you think of Lineker’s politics or his crisps, he has been a brilliant front man for Match Of The Day. Keown would be just as good. The former Arsenal hardman was even born in the same week England won the World Cup in July 1966. That has to be an omen.","summary":"","url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/30063309/keir-starmer-riot-act-greedy-strikers/","image":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/britains-prime-minister-keir-starmer-925583940.jpg?strip=all&quality=100&w=1920&h=1080&crop=1","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-08-24 20:00:00","author":"Adam Sonin,Tony Parsons","authors":["Adam Sonin","Tony Parsons"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.29},{"id":254849122,"title":"First 'Genocide Joe', now 'Killer Kamala': The Democrats mulling their next move after a convention that left them furious","text":"While America's Democratic diehards enjoyed pep talks and pop music at their party-vibes convention this week, a smaller panel event on the sidelines was striking a very different tone. The first speaker, Hala Hijazi, was in tears before she'd even finished introducing herself to the room. \"I'm here because I've had over 100 of my family killed in Gaza,\" Hijazi said. \"Just two last week.\" For years, Hijazi's served the Democratic Party and its causes in San Francisco: fundraising, doorknocking for candidates, and serving on the board of a group that trains Democratic women to run for office. But for all her public service, she said, she felt she'd let her family in Gaza down. \"I feel guilty because for 25 years I've been living my American dream while they've been under occupation, struggling and dying,\" she said. \"I'm a fraud for not speaking up for them for the past 25 years. But that has changed.\" Hijazi is part of a growing Democratic movement pressuring the party, from within, to rein in military support for Israel. But it's up against some powerful forces that want to maintain the status quo. \"Dark money\" is a big one, Jewish ex-congressman Andy Levin told the panel event. Pro-Israel lobby group AIPAC spent millions to help another Democrat unseat Levin in 2022, after he spoke out on Palestinian rights. It recently did the same thing to two other outspoken Democrats in Congress. (AIPAC says the success of the candidates it backs shows it is \"good politics and good policy to stand with the Jewish state\".) But Levin is optimistic about the party's new presidential candidate. He points to her impassioned calls for a ceasefire back in March, and her meeting with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in Washington last month. \"She refused to go to his absurd speech to a joint session of Congress,\" Levin said. \"Then when she met with him, she did speak some truth to power to him. I don't think that's that easy.\" Hijazi has hope too. As a longtime Democratic organiser in Harris's home state of California, she's known the vice-president for more than 25 years. \"She's trying,\" Hijazi told the panel. \"We have to hold her accountable too, but we also have to give her a chance.\" First 'Genocide Joe', now 'Killer Kamala' As the panel was taking place in a packed conference room, pro-Palestinian protesters were gathering in a park closer to the convention arena. \"Genocide Joe\" has long been a popular chant at these protests. This time, the catchcry was \"Killer Kamala\". The US gives Israel several billions of dollars' worth of military support each year, and President Joe Biden ticked off on a $US14.1 billion boost in April. Protesters who spoke to the ABC had little faith in Harris adopting any different stance to Biden. \"Her political career, if you trace it, she has received heavy backing from many of the same Zionist donors who are backing Joe Biden,\" said Nima Homami, who'd travelled from Ohio for the protest. \"I don't know, honestly, if the Democrats will ever listen. It feels like there's just too much money involved.\" But inside the Democratic Party tent, the lobbying efforts persist. Most of the delegates attending the convention on behalf of their state parties were there to support Harris. But about 30 were there to represent Democrats who voted \"uncommitted\" when asked to choose the party's presidential candidate in primary elections this year. \"We saw 101,000 'uncommitted' voters in Michigan,\" said Jonathan Simonds, an uncommitted delegate from Hawaii. \"We saw almost 800,000 uncommitted voters across the country in the primary, and those are Democrats. \"I think that some of them will vote for Harris either way, and wanted to make a statement. \"But I think that there's a certain proportion of those voters who will maybe not vote for Trump, but won't feel inspired enough to go to the polls for Harris.\" The phone call that angered uncommitted delegates The Uncommitted National Movement's main demand is for an arms embargo, and they point to a series of polls showing declining support among Democrats for American military aid to Israel. In a YouGov/Economist poll this month, 49 per cent of likely Harris voters were in favour of America reducing military aid to Israel, compared to 29 per cent who wanted it maintained, and 9 per cent who favoured an increase. The movement also requested a speaking spot at the convention for a Palestinian American. They provided the DNC with a shortlist of elected Democrats to choose from. \"The DNC kept telling us that they would get back to us, and they were working on it, and to be patient,\" Asma Mohammed, an uncommitted delegate from Minnesota, told the ABC. \"And finally, [Wednesday] at 8pm they told us the answer was no.\" Some uncommitted delegates responded by staging a 24-hour sit-in next to the convention arena, sleeping on the concrete outside the stadium. One of the speakers on the shortlist was Georgia state Democrat Ruwa Romman, who prepared a speech about her family's Palestinian roots and their recent pain, but did not directly criticise the Biden administration. \"Let's commit to each other, to electing Vice-President Harris and defeating Donald Trump, who uses my identity as a Palestinian as a slur,\" she said in the speech, which she delivered at a press conference outside the stadium instead. A 'boneheaded mistake' When Harris campaign spokesman Michael Tyler was asked why the movement's request for a speaker was rejected, he did not directly answer. But he said: \"We're proud and glad they're here. We've worked to engage them throughout the convention. We're proud of the fact that we held panel conversations with members.\" James Zogby, the founder of the Arab America Institute and a former member of the Democratic National Committee's executive, said the decision \"was an unforced error, it was stupid, and it will cost support\". \"The idea of not having a Palestinian speaker was the most boneheaded mistake I've seen in politics in a long time,\" said Zogby, a longtime supporter of Palestinian rights. \"There are many votes that they may lose because they didn't have one.\" But Harris faces the reverse pressure from inside the party, too. Some Democrats want to see more support for Israel from the party's leadership. \"They've handled it OK – not as strong as I would like,\" said Richard Levik, a volunteer at the convention who also attended a small pro-Israel rally outside. \"If [the October 7 attack] happened to us, we'd be doing more than what Israel has done. And we support them in fighting a war that Hamas started.\" Last month, Netanyahu told Congress that more American weapons could help end the war. \"Give us the tools faster, and we’ll finish the job faster,\" he said. The Israel-Gaza war is not a top priority issue for most American voters, polls have consistently shown. But experts say it could prove critical in Michigan, partly because of its large Arab American and Muslim population. And that state could in turn prove critical to the election result. \"The major element of a rapprochement between Harris-Walz and the Arab Americans in Michigan would be, at a minimum, to have a ceasefire,\" said Michael Traugott, a political scientist at the University of Michigan. \"That would probably affect two or three or four percentage points of the vote in Michigan, but that could make a difference in the actual outcome.\" What's next for the uncommitted? On the final night of the convention, the uncommitted delegates ended their sit-in and walked into the arena, with their arms locked, in time to hear Harris's speech. They did not expect to hear support for an arms embargo. But some in the movement were hoping, as a minimum, Harris would use her convention speech to commit to following American and international law regarding weapons provisions. Her remarks fell short of what they'd hoped for. \"I will always stand up for Israel's right to defend itself, and I will always ensure Israel has the ability to defend itself, because the people of Israel must never again face the horror that a terrorist organisation called Hamas caused on October 7,\" she said. As some shouts of \"free Palestine\" were heard in the crowd, Harris went on to describe the scale of suffering in Gaza as \"devastating\" and \"heartbreaking\". \"President Biden and I are working to end this war such that Israel is secure, the hostages are released, the suffering in Gaza ends and the Palestinian people can realise their right to dignity, security, freedom and self-determination.\" The uncommitted movement is now demanding Harris meet with their leaders, and impacted Palestinian families, by September 15. They have not spelled out what they will do if she refuses. \"We're not going anywhere,\" said uncommitted delegate Jeremiah Ellison, who serves on the Minneapolis City Council. \"We're not going to accept rejection. We're long-time party activists. We're long-time community organisers. We know how to mobilise.\" — with Phoebe Hosier in Washington DC","summary":"While America's Democratic diehards enjoyed pep talks and pop music at their party-vibes convention this week, a smaller panel event on the sidelines was striking a very different tone. ","url":"https://www.abc.net.au/news/2024-08-25/democratic-convention-uncommitted-movement-kamala-harris/104267026","image":"https://live-production.wcms.abc-cdn.net.au/64f3453efb435cc985e659142bbe52ad?impolicy=wcms_crop_resize&cropH=2384&cropW=4238&xPos=1&yPos=0&width=862&height=485","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-08-24 19:59:57","author":"Brad Ryan,Phoebe Hosier","authors":["Brad Ryan","Phoebe Hosier"],"language":"en","source_country":"AU","sentiment":-0.044},{"id":254848474,"title":"Brittany Mahomes blasts haters with ‘deep-rooted issues’ after backlash for ‘liking’ Donald Trump post: ‘You refuse to heal’","text":"Brittany Mahomes is standing up for herself after haters came after her for allegedly “liking” an Aug. 13 Instagram post from former President Donald Trump. “I mean honestly … To be a hater as an adult, you have to have some deep rooted issues you refuse to heal from childhood,” she wrote on her Instagram Story. “There’s no reason your brain is fully developed and you hate to see others doing well.” Mahomes, 28, did not specifically express what her clapback was about but Page Six can confirm her “like” no longer shows on Trump’s post, which details his plan to “make America great again.” The influx of internet hate also came after it was reported that her husband, Patrick Mahomes, pledged a $5 million donation for the South End Zone and Dustin R. Womble Football Center project at his alma mater, Texas Tech University. The former soccer player did not immediately respond to Page Six’s request for comment. Trolls ripped into Brittany on X and Instagram when they noticed her supporting the twice-impeached ex-president, with many calling her “disgusting.” “I don’t get how people with kids would still vote for a known child rapist/felon. Guess people like Brittany Mahomes prefer the tax breaks over child safety,” slammed another. In 2023, Trump, 78, was found liable for sexually abusing Writer E. Jean Carroll, but the New York City jury cleared his name of rape. However, he has been accused of rape or sexual assault by more than a dozen women over the last several decades. “whats absolutely so diabolically evil about the brittany mahomes situation is that she didnt even just like a post of trump shaking hands with someone she liked his manifesto of all the terrible things hes gunna enact if he wins AND she doubled down,” another X user wrote. A third added, “Brittany Mahomes is a Trump supporter and a trash human being ?.” Meanwhile, fans of Taylor Swift — who has publicly opposed Trump in the past — theorized that their friendship would end over Brittany’s public support of the 2024 presidential candidate. Swift, 34, and Brittany quickly became friends last fall after the singer and Travis Kelce started dating. Kelce and Patrick are best friends and teammates. Multiple trolls said they were not surprised that Brittany and Patrick would be Trump supporters. However, the NFL star, 28, declined to comment on the upcoming election in an interview published by Time in April. “I don’t want to pressure anyone to vote for a certain president,” he said. “I want people to use their voice, whoever they believe in. I want them to do the research.” Neither Brittany nor Patrick were following the Republican presidential nominee as of Saturday afternoon.","summary":"\"There's no reason your brain is fully developed and you hate to see others doing well,\" the former soccer player clapped back.","url":"https://pagesix.com/2024/08/24/celebrity-news/brittany-mahomes-blasts-haters-after-backlash-for-liking-donald-trump-post/","image":"https://pagesix.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/08/88247484.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/OEggcMFW-guILbWnz.mp4","publish_date":"2024-08-24 19:51:59","author":"Sara Whitman","authors":["Sara Whitman"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.138},{"id":254848302,"title":"Kamala Harris Sees Polling Boost During DNC","text":"Vice President Kamala Harris has extended her lead over former President Donald Trump among registered voters, according to new polling data released during the Democratic National Convention (DNC).The Angus Reid Institute, a non-profit research organization, conducted a survey on August 19 to August 23 as the Democratic Party formally nominated Harris as its presidential candidate.The national poll reveals a growing generational and demographic divide in voter preferences. Harris holds a substantial lead among 18- to 34-year-olds, with 59 percent favoring Harris compared to 30 percent for Trump. This advantage is even more pronounced among Black voters, where Harris leads 67 percent to 16 percent, and Hispanic voters, where she maintains a 57 percent to 33 percent edge.However, Trump continues to perform well with older and white voters. The former president is the preferred choice for 49 percent of voters over 54, compared to 40 percent for Harris. Among white voters, Trump leads 51 percent to 39 percent.The Harris campaign's effective use of social media has contributed to what analysts describe as an \"extended honeymoon period\" for the candidate. Memes and viral content have helped generate enthusiasm, particularly among younger voters. Yet this strategy also presents a challenge: translating online engagement into actual votes in November.Newsweek contacted the Harris and Trump campaign via email on Saturday afternoon for comment.While youth voter turnout reached a record high in 2020, it still only surpassed 50 percent, significantly lower than the participation rates of older age groups.The Angus Reid survey also highlights potential hurdles facing Harris as she seeks to become the first woman elected to the presidency. A striking 74 percent of respondents believe it is more difficult for a woman to be elected to high political office, despite 59 percent saying there is \"no difference\" between genders in competently performing the job once in office.The poll also delved into voters' emotional responses to the candidates. Notably, 71 percent of Harris supporters say her potential victory makes them \"hopeful,\" while 63 percent of Trump supporters express the same sentiment about a possible second term for the former president.However, the prospect of the opposing candidate winning elicits worry and fear from both camps, with Trump supporters expressing slightly higher levels of concern (57 percent worry, 38 percent fear) compared to Harris backers (47 percent worry, 45 precent fear).When asked to describe the candidates, voters most frequently characterized Harris as \"dishonest\" (36 percent), \"strong\" (36 precent), \"corrupt\" (32 percent), \"inspiring\" (31 percent), and \"strategic\" (29 percent). Trump, on the other hand, was primarily described as \"arrogant\" (62 percent), a \"bully\" (48 percent), \"corrupt\" (45 percent), \"dishonest\" (45 precent), and \"strong\" (38 percent).The Angus Reid survey identified the cost of living as the top issue facing the United States, with 58 percent of voters citing it as their primary concern. This was followed by the economy more broadly (28 percent), border security (27 percent), healthcare (25 percent) and reproductive rights (23 precent).A newly released national poll from Fairleigh Dickinson University (FDU) and Braun Research finds Harris leading Trump by a 7-point margin. The poll of 801 registered voters conducted between August 17 and 20 shows 50 percent of voters support Harris while 43 percent support Trump. The poll has a margin of error of plus or minus 3.5 percentage points.Broken down by party, 95 percent of surveyed Democrats, 38 percent of independents, and 2 percent of Republicans back Harris. A third of independents, 33 percent, back Trump, while 95 percent of Republicans and 3 percent of Democrats support him.Contrary to the FDU poll's findings, a Rasmussen Reports poll released Thursday found Trump leading Harris by 3 percentage points, 49 to 46 percent. The survey of 1,893 likely voters was conducted on August 15 and between August 18 and 21. It has a margin of error of plus or minus 3 percentage points.Most national aggregate polls place Harris at the top of the race, with RealClearPolitics showing Harris up by 1.5 percentage points, 48.4 percent to Trump's 46.9 percent, and The New York Times aggregate showing Harris with a 2-percentage point lead, 49 to 47 percent. Other aggregates show larger margins, such as FiveThirtyEight, which finds Harris up by 3.6 percentage points, 47.2 to 43.6 percent. Nate Silver's Silver Bulletin also shows Harris leading, putting her at 48 percent and Trump at 43.7 percent.The race has been further complicated by the recent withdrawal of independent candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who had been drawing about 5 percent in national polls. Kennedy officially dropped out on Friday and endorsed Trump.As the campaign enters its post-convention phase, both candidates face significant challenges. For Harris, the task will be to maintain her momentum and translate her current polling advantage into Electoral College votes. Trump, meanwhile, must work to broaden his appeal beyond his base and address the concerns of swing voters who may be wary of a second Trump term.With just over two months until Election Day, the race remains highly competitive as the campaigns continue to narrow their focuses on the crucial swing states.While Harris appears to have received a convention bounce, the true test will come in the weeks ahead as voters begin to engage more deeply with the candidates and their policies. As always in American presidential politics, it's likely to be a hard-fought contest right up until November.","summary":"Harris extends lead over Trump in new polls during DNC, revealing generational and demographic divides as the election nears.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/kamala-harris-polling-boost-dnc-donald-trump-1943966","image":"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2457453/kamala-harris.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-08-24 19:51:04","author":"Adeola Adeosun","authors":["Adeola Adeosun"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.305},{"id":254849294,"title":"Michigan GOP convention devolves into chaos after former chairwoman is forced to leave","text":"Former Chairwoman Kristina Karamo, who the party ousted earlier this year, was escorted out by Flint police after wearing an all access credential that she wasn’t entitled to, according to a Michigan GOP source. She was asked to wear a guest or campaign staff credential, but she allegedly refused and was asked to leave because she wasn’t allowed on the delegate floor. “Pete Hoekstra wants me thrown out of the convention; I’m here supporting a candidate,” Karamo told reporters as she was being escorted out. “I did not cause any disruption. I didn’t scream or yell. I didn’t do anything wrong. All I did was walk in and support the candidate.” “This is why the Michigan Republican Party — look at the convention, people yelling, booing, why? ‘Cause of the corruption in the party,” she continued. Onlookers thanked her as she walked out the door. Also during the video, a voice is heard saying, “That credential is our property. We’re gonna want that back before she leaves the property.” In the video, she’s seen wearing the all-access credential. Karamo’s removal from the convention appears to be the climax of intraparty drama in which the party’s state committee underwent a seemingly dubious process to remove her. Less than half of the state committee’s roughly 100 members took part in the Jan. 6 vote, and those in attendance changed the party’s bylaws to shift the voting threshold to oust a party chair from 75% to 60%. Those in attendance reportedly voted 40-5 in favor of removing her, and Karamo was outraged, saying she remained the party’s chairwoman. She held a meeting with committee members on Jan. 13. who reportedly voted in favor of her 59-1. A court settled the matter in February, ruling Karamo isn’t the party chairwoman, affirming that former Michigan Rep. Pete Hoekstra would take the mantle. Former President Donald Trump endorsed Hoekstra as the Michigan GOP leader. But at Saturday’s convention, where the party is expected to nominate its candidate for Senate, former Rep. Mike Rogers, among others being nominated for statewide office, Hoekstra received a chilly reception. The crowd relentlessly booed him before and after Karamo was removed. Hoekstra’s reception by the Michigan GOP crowd could illustrate continued support for Karamo within the party. While she was being removed, several onlookers yelled at police to refrain from touching her. According to Bridge Michigan, another guest was removed by police and arrested for allegedly being belligerent and refusing to leave. The Detroit News reported the guest had shouted that Hoekstra was a “fake chair.” “Due to the disruptive actions of a handful of participants, law enforcement have decided to increase their presence to ensure a safe and smooth convention,” Tyson Shepard, the Michigan GOP’s executive director, told the outlet. Karamo came to prominence in 2020 as a poll watcher who denied that year’s election results and allegedly witnessed irregularities in vote counting. She later ran for Michigan secretary of state in 2022 but lost. She challenged the results of that election as well before she was elected to lead the state Republican Party in Feb. 2023. The state party was motivated to remove her as chairwoman because of fundraising woes within the organization that caused it to sink at least half a million into debt by Oct. 2023. She was removed in January. Karamo was ultimately removed from the convention premises at the Dort Financial Center in Flint, according to reporting from the scene. The convention’s proceedings were delayed before delegates proceeded with voting.","summary":"Michigan&#8217;s state GOP convention didn&#8217;t go on without a hitch.
