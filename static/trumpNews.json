According to information on the website of the Federal Bureau of Prisons, Rana is “Not in BOP Custody” as of April 8, 2025.

An official at the agency told PTI Wednesday that Rana is not in the custody of the Bureau of Prisons (BOP). “If an individual is listed as \"Released\" or \"Not in BOP Custody\" and no facility location is indicated, the inmate is no longer in BOP custody, however, the inmate may still be in the custody of some other correctional/criminal justice system/law enforcement entity, or on parole or supervised release,” the official said.

The “inmate locator” information on the website lists the register number for Rana as “22829-424”, his age, race and sex. Rana, 64, is a Pakistan-born Canadian national and close associate of one of the main conspirators of the 2008 Mumbai terror attacks David Coleman Headley alias Daood Gilani, a Pakistani American citizen. According to government sources on early Wednesday, Rana is expected to be extradited to India “shortly”. A multi-agency team from India has gone to the US and all paperwork and legalities are being completed with the US authorities. Sources had said “very high possibility\" that Rana “could be extradited shortly”. The hugely significant development comes just days after Rana's last-resort attempt to evade extradition to India failed after the US Supreme Court justices denied his application, moving him closer to being handed over to Indian authorities to face justice in the dastardly attacks. Rana was lodged in the Metropolitan Detention Centre in Los Angeles and had submitted an ‘Emergency Application For Stay Pending Litigation of Petition For Writ of Habeas Corpus' on February 27, 2025 with Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States and Circuit Justice for the Ninth Circuit Elena Kagan. Kagan had denied the application earlier last month. Rana had then renewed his ‘Emergency Application for Stay Pending Litigation of Petition for Writ of Habeas Corpus previously addressed to Justice Kagan', and requested that the renewed application be directed to US Chief Justice John Roberts. An order on the Supreme Court website had noted that Rana's renewed application has been “distributed for Conference” on April 4 and the “application” has been “referred to the Court”. A notice on the Supreme Court website Monday said that his application is \"denied\" by the court. In his emergency application, Rana had sought a “stay of his extradition and surrender to India pending litigation (including exhaustion of all appeals) on the merits of his February 13, 2025 petition for a writ of habeas corpus “asserting, inter alia, that his extradition to India violates United States law… implementing the terms of the United Nations Convention Against Torture, because there are substantial grounds for believing that, if extradited to India, petitioner will be in danger of being subjected to torture”. “The likelihood of torture in this case is even higher though as petitioner faces acute risk as a Muslim of Pakistani origin charged in the Mumbai attacks,” the application said. The application also said that his “severe medical conditions” render extradition to Indian detention facilities a “de facto\" death sentence in this case. It cited medical records from July 2024 that confirm Rana has multiple “acute and life-threatening diagnoses”, including multiple documented heart attacks, Parkinson's disease with cognitive decline, a mass suggestive of bladder cancer, stage 3 chronic kidney disease, and a history of chronic asthma, and multiple COVID-19 infections. “Accordingly, petitioner certainly has raised a credible, if not compelling, factual case that there are indeed substantial grounds for believing he would be in danger of torture if surrendered to Indian authorities. \"Further, because of his Muslim religion, his Pakistani origin, his status as a former member of the Pakistani Army, the relation of the putative charges to the 2008 Mumbai attacks, and his chronic health conditions he is even more likely to be tortured than otherwise would be the case, and that torture is very likely to kill him in short order.” The US Supreme Court denied Rana's petition for writ of certiorari relating to his original habeas petition on January 21, 2025. The application notes that on that same day, newly-confirmed Secretary of State Marco Rubio had met with External Affairs Minister Dr S Jaishankar. When Prime Minister Narendra Modi arrived in Washington on February 12 to meet with US President Donald Trump, Rana's counsel received a letter from the Department of State, stating that “on February 11, 2025, the Secretary of State decided to authorize” Rana's \"surrender to India,” pursuant to the “Extradition Treaty between the United States and India”. Rana's Counsel requested from the State Department the complete administrative record on which Secretary Rubio based his decision to authorise Rana's surrender to India. The Counsel also requested immediate information of any commitment the United States has obtained from India with respect to Rana's treatment. “The government declined to provide any information in response to these requests,” the application said. It added that given Rana's underlying health conditions and the State Department's own findings regarding treatment of prisoners, it is very likely that he will not survive long enough to be tried in India. During a joint press conference with Prime Minister Modi in the White House in February, President Trump had announced that his administration has approved the extradition of \"very evil\" Tahawwur Rana, wanted by Indian law enforcement agencies for his role in the 26/11 Mumbai terror attacks, \"to face justice in India”. The India-US joint statement issued during the Prime Minister's visit to US notes that Modi and Trump reaffirmed that the global scourge of terrorism must be fought and terrorist safe havens eliminated from every corner of the world. “Recognising a shared desire to bring to justice those who would harm our citizens, the US announced that the extradition to India of Tahawwur Rana has been approved. The leaders further called on Pakistan to expeditiously bring to justice the perpetrators of the 26/11 Mumbai, and Pathankot attacks and ensure that its territory is not used to carry out cross-border terrorist attacks. \"The leaders also pledged to work together to prevent proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and their delivery systems and to deny access to such weapons by terrorists and non-state actors,” the joint statement said. On November 26, 2008, a group of 10 Pakistani terrorists went on a rampage, carrying out a coordinated attack on a railway station, two luxury hotels and a Jewish centre, after they sneaked into India's financial capital using the sea route in the Arabian Sea. As many as 166 people were killed in the nearly 60-hour assault that sent shockwaves across the country and even brought India and Pakistan to the brink of war.

The top stories and themes. The stock markets hold out once again as tariff wars kick in.Oil prices are now around $60 a barrel. What's next? The Reserve Bank of India's governor is grilled on the rupee even as the Chinese yuan continues to slide.And fear of owning US tragedies is gripping global bond traders. And the Reserve Bank of India lowers growth forecasts for the year to 6.5% from 6.7%. The Markets Fight BackThe Reserve Bank of India cut the repo rate by 25 basis points from 6.25% to 6%. Now, that did not do much to the markets today, though possibly prevented a deeper fall, given that a full-blown trade war is now kicked off between the United States and China, with the US imposing a 104% tariff on Chinese goods into the US and China imposing a 84% tariff on US goods into China. The US has also imposed a 26% tariff on India, lest we forget. And there is hope that the Indian government's outreach without any retaliation, as is the case now, will lead to some compromise or in Trump's words, a deal.Back to the rate cut. The markets had mostly priced in that rate cut as one of the many macro factors that are acting as positive counterweights to the negative news from around the world. On Wednesday, the indices closed lower, with the Sensex falling 379 points to close at 73,847, while the NSE Nifty 50 was down 136 points to close at 22,399.In the broader market, the BSE mid-cap and small-cap indices also fell about 0.7 and about 1% each. Meanwhile, stocks with high profitability and earnings visibility will offer growth opportunities and investors should focus on earnings and not Trump tariffs, HSBC Global Research said in a note quoted by the Economic Times. The brokerage firm has picked five stocks, TVS Motors, Reliance Industries, Sriram Finance, ICICI Bank, Adani Ports, and Special Economic Zone, based on structural merits, arguing for them to do the trick.If you want to know more about Sriram Finance and their strategy, you can look up the Core Report Weekend Edition and our conversation with the firm's managing director. The Nifty has fallen over 3% since US President Donald Trump assumed office on January 20. This year, HSBC sees limited impact of trade tensions on growth of Indian companies as low foreign holdings reduce the risk of further outflows and it also believes the macro risks have declined.It is, however, highlighting concerns over high earnings expectations. Indian stocks are on pace to outperform regional peers by the most since 2009 thanks to the limited impact of the tariff trade war. The MSCI India Index is set to beat the MSCI's broader Asia-Pacific gauge by more than 6 percentage points this week, according to Bloomberg on Wednesday, adding that while tariff-induced sell-off in global markets has hit Indian stocks, local equities have shown more resilience than their peers, in part due to the country's relatively low exposure to the US economy.Bloomberg also quoted Nomura Holdings saying that India is the least exposed to the US tariff shock and could benefit from the ongoing global supply chain shifts. India's reciprocal tariff rate is lower than some of its competitors and the country is a strategic ally to the US, they added, which may lure short-term trade diversions. Now, let's look at IndiGo and more of it because we did speak about it yesterday as well.Now, IndiGo is India's largest airline and also ranks in the world's top 10. On Wednesday, it crossed US-based Delta in terms of market capitalization to become the world's most valuable airline, according to Bloomberg data quoted by Business Standard. Its stock price touched a peak of $5,262 and market capitalization of about $23.2 billion, little ahead of Delta's market capitalization of $23.1 billion.

Here’s why the pause ... More isn’t the pivot many hoped for.\n\nMarkets rallied. Wall Street cheered. But if you’re standing in the grocery aisle wondering whether prices are about to drop—the short answer is no.\n\nToday, President Donald Trump announced a 90-day pause on new tariffs for most countries—but at the same time, he raised tariffs on Chinese imports from 104% to 125%. The stock market surged in response: the S&P 500 climbed 7%, the Nasdaq jumped over 9%, and the Dow gained more than 2,600 points. Investors may have welcomed the pause as a cooling-off signal, but economists are still cautious.\n\nFrom a food perspective, this doesn’t resolve much. The pause is temporary, and tariffs on Chinese goods—which include categories that affect the food supply—are still high. Whether this 90-day delay leads to anything that's more permanent remains to be seen. But for now, the pressure on ingredients, pricing, and supply chains isn’t going anywhere.\n\nAccording to a Reuters report, major retailers like Walmart and Target are already in tense negotiations with suppliers over proposed price increases as brands work to absorb higher costs tied to tariffs. That kind of uncertainty keeps prices sticky, even when policy temporarily loosens its grip.\n\nFor shoppers, this isn’t relief—it’s a stall. And when it comes to essentials like garlic, apple juice, or cooking oils, even temporary uncertainty can keep prices higher than they need to be.\n\nEarlier this year, more than 1,000 product categories were flagged as vulnerable to tariff-related price increases—including a wide range of everyday grocery staples. Think: garlic, apple juice concentrate (used in everything from juice blends to snacks), frozen seafood like shrimp and tilapia, spices, vinegar-based sauces like soy sauce, and processed vegetable oils. These are ingredients that show up quietly but consistently in a lot of what we eat. And because China supplies a significant share of these imports, there’s not much wiggle room when it comes to sourcing alternatives quickly.\n\nFor shoppers, this means any impact on food prices is likely to be delayed, uneven, and conditional. A few categories might stabilize—especially pantry staples like dried garlic or apple juice concentrate—but only if retailers pass along savings (and that’s a big if). Much depends on whether the pause leads to something more lasting or if tariffs snap back into place at the end of the window. There’s also the question of global response: will China hold steady or counter?\n\nMORE FOR YOU\n\nHuge Changes To Student Loan Repayment Plans Are Coming, And Borrowers Could Pay A Steep Price\n\nGoogle Confirms Gmail Update Choice—3 Billion Users Must Now Decide\n\nTrump Approval Rating Tracker: Two Post-Tariff Surveys Show Decline\n\nFinancial analysts, including those at Raymond James, are already urging caution. The market might be reacting to the pause, but that doesn’t guarantee trade restrictions are going away. And it certainly doesn’t mean we’re done feeling the effects.\n\nWhat Foods Could Still Be at Risk?\n\nFrom garlic to frozen shrimp, these pantry staples are still vulnerable if tariffs return—and ... More they’re already baked into today’s prices.\n\nEven with the temporary pause, many items in our shopping carts are still vulnerable if tariffs return—or if trade tensions escalate. Here’s’ what might still be impacted:\n\nFrozen seafood – including shrimp, tilapia, and mollusks\n\nApple juice concentrate – heavily reliant on Chinese imports\n\nDried garlic – a staple in both home kitchens and food manufacturing\n\nVegetable oils – especially non-soybean varieties used in processed foods\n\nVinegar and sauces – including soy sauce and flavoring bases\n\nDehydrated vegetables and mushrooms – often used in soups and seasoning blends\n\nSnack foods and flavorings – low-profile but high-frequency items in packaged goods\n\nHoney and powdered dairy products – smaller-volume imports, but still tariff-sensitive\n\nEven price changes in any category can add up—especially when passed down through areas that shoppers might not expect: what we eat at a restaurant, brands who use these ingredients, and even the cost of processed staples.\n\nWhy This Matters\n\nTariffs don’t just move markets. They move meals, shift recipes, and reshape how we feed ... More ourselves—quietly, and often without choice.\n\nTariffs aren’t just a policy headline—they shape what ends up on our plates. When imported ingredients become more expensive, it ripples through the food system: into manufacturing, into restaurant pricing, and into the quiet choices people make at the grocery store. And while the headlines are focused on market wins, many consumers are still feelingthe squeeze.\n\nA March poll from the University of Illinois found that a majority of Americans are worried about tariffs pushing grocery prices even higher. Concern is especially high among Democrats and Independents, and those who are most worried about tariffs are also more likely to expect inflation to worsen in the coming months.\n\nAnd now, a HarrisX poll that came out on the same day shows Americans are split: some see the pause as a welcome move, and others view it as too little, too late. What do most agree on? Prices are still too high, and few expect that to change overnight.\n\nPausing tariffs might give markets a jolt, but it doesn’t change the fact that food inflation is personal. People notice when the same bag of groceries costs $20 more than it used to. Until there's a longer-term plan—or a full rollback—this is less about economic recovery and more about political timing. Food, as always, tells the fuller story.\n\nFollow me on Twitter or LinkedIn.

The order also includes a call to halt attempts to collect carbon penalties or carbon taxes.\n\nOregon’s signature Climate Protection Program, which the state restored last November after a legal challenge, would be the most likely target. The program requires ever-increasing reductions in greenhouse gas emissions from the state’s natural gas utilities, suppliers of gasoline, diesel, kerosene and propane and large industrial plants. \n\nOther programs the federal government may challenge include Oregon’s 100% clean energy law, which requires investor-owned utilities in the state to transition to all clean electricity by 2040; the coal-to-clean law that phases out coal from the state’s electricity supply by 2030; and the Clean Fuels Program to reduce the carbon intensity of transportation fuels. \n\nAlso at risk could be energy efficiency programs, solar incentives and electric car and truck rebates. \n\nAt the local level, the Trump administration could target Portland’s effort to phase out petroleum diesel, Multnomah County’s climate lawsuit that seeks to recover costs of responding to the heat dome and other extreme weather from fossil fuel companies, the county’s and city’s clean energy, electrification and energy efficiency requirements, Ashland’s pollution fee on new natural gas hookups, among others. \n\nThe order also mentions existing climate Superfund laws in New York and Vermont that seek to recoup payments for climate change-related damages from large polluters based on their greenhouse gas emissions. Oregon legislators are working to pass a similar law.\n\nOregon environmental groups called Trump’s order blatantly unconstitutional and said states have the right to pursue clean electricity sources like wind and solar projects, create green jobs and help local residents become better prepared for extreme weather events. \n\n“This executive order is yet another clear attempt by President Trump at the behest of the fossil fuel industry to override and silence the will of the people. If allowed to stand, it would mean not just higher bills and local job loss but also more pollution for our families and destructive wildfires across Oregon and the rest of the country,” said Meredith Connolly, director of policy and strategy at Climate Solutions, a Northwest-based nonprofit focused on clean energy. \n\nConnolly urged Gov. Tina Kotek, Attorney General Dan Rayfield and the state Legislature to stand firm in protecting state and local climate laws. \n\nKotek said she would do just that. \n\n“Combating climate change requires collaboration and long-term work – not deregulating polluters. The science is clear. Climate change is real and our state programs are critical to protecting our environment for generations to come.

But hours later, Macron took to social media platform X to share key takeaways from their \"long exchange.\"“I first reiterated the importance that France attaches to the democratic and European destiny of Serbia,” Macron posted. He expressed confidence in Serbia’s ability to “return to the path of dialogue,” and called on the future government to pursue “the expected reforms” and build on the country's recent economic progress.The visit comes amid massive anti-government protests in Serbia. Demonstrators have accused Vučić’s government of corruption and violence. Meanwhile, a group of around 100 Serbian students is currently cycling to the European Parliament in Strasbourg, expected to arrive next week, to alert the EU authorities of the situation in their country. Many Serbian students feel they haven’t received enough support from the European Union, despite garnering huge support at home.The protests were triggered by the deaths of 16 people in a deadly train station canopy collapse in November.The incident was blamed on rampant corruption, and it has served to focus wider discontent with Vučić's populist rule in Serbia.Big economic interests for FranceDespite the political turbulence, France has big economic interests in Serbia. Last summer, Belgrade purchased 12 French Rafale fighter jets for the modest sum of €3 billion.Vučić confirmed to reporters on Wednesday that Serbia will pay its second instalment of more than €400 million on Thursday. Macron’s statement on social media also confirmed France's participation in the 2027 Expo in Belgrade - a clear show of support for Vučić. France is also involved in broader infrastructure and energy projects in Serbia. The French company Vinci operates Belgrade’s airport, and Michelin manufactures tyres in the country. There’s also talk of France helping Serbia build nuclear power plants. Another key issue that was on the table on Wednesday is Donald Trump's tariffs.Serbia has been hit the hardest in the region with 34% tariffs — higher than the 20% imposed on the EU — creating pressure on French stakeholders. Regional stability on the tableMacron stated that the two leaders discussed Bosnia and Herzegovina, stressing France’s “unwavering support for the unity of this country” and condemning any action that would threaten its constitutional order. Tensions there have soared following last month’s conviction of Bosnian Serb leader Milorad Dodik, a close political ally of Vučić. Dodik was sentenced to one year in prison and banned from holding public office for six years by the State Court for refusing to accept the decisions of the international High Representative overseeing the peace agreement in this divided Balkan country.The French leader also reiterated France’s commitment to the normalisation of relations between Serbia and Kosovo — calling it “an essential condition” for both countries’ EU aspirations.Belgrade doesn’t recognise the sovereignty of Pristina, which declared independence in 2008. Numerous Brussels-led attempts at appeasement and dialogue have failed in recent years.","summary":"Aleksandar Vučić's visit comes amid unprecedented nationwide protests against his government.","url":"https://www.euronews.com/my-europe/2025/04/10/under-fire-at-home-serbian-president-vucic-gets-quiet-but-strategic-support-from-france","image":"https://static.euronews.com/articles/stories/09/18/52/14/1440x810_cmsv2_f52dbfc9-bac0-5e5c-884a-720d0a5dfc21-9185214.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-10 00:42:01","author":"Sophia Khatsenkova","authors":["Sophia Khatsenkova"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"fr","sentiment":0.02},{"id":309516246,"title":"Stock Market Today: Will Indian Stock Market Take a Break On Occasion Of Mahavir Jaynti??","text":"The Indian stock market remains shut on Thursday, April 10, 2025, in observance of Mahavir Jayanti.

China’s imposition of an 84 per cent barrier against American exports to the People’s Republic signals the outbreak of a truly explosive trade war.\n\nThe world’s open system of commerce, pieced together over the course of the last century, has been ripped to pieces by an American President obsessed with the preposterous idea that his rampaging measures will make America great again. The consequences for international trade, financial stability and the global economy could be disastrous.\n\nWhile the EU has left the door open to negotiations, these tit-for-tat measures offer a sharp reminder of the 1930s, when the Herbert Hoover-era Smoot-Hawley tariff sparked an all-out trade war and was among the key factors behind the Great Depression.\n\nThere was a chink of light last night when Trump posted on X that he was allowing a 90-day pause on his destructive tariff blitz for all nations – with the exception of America’s greatest trading partner and his most powerful economic and strategic foe, China.\n\nThe White House has gambled that by going big and imposing tariffs of 125 per cent on some Chinese goods, it could force supreme leader Xi Jinping to the negotiating table.\n\nIt is true that Britain and some Asian nations, including Japan, South Korea and Vietnam, have already commenced, or are seeking, urgent economic talks with the White House. The People’s Republic, however, has slammed the door shut on any immediate prospect of compromise.\n\nBeijing recognises that America, its corporations, farmers and citizens, have more to lose from a prolonged trade dispute than China, where the population is used to hardship.\n\nAmericans, in contrast, are hooked on the ever-rising living standards and will be appalled at the prospect of higher inflation – perhaps paying double for consumer electronics – and soaring interest rates.\n\nTrump believes that by hitting the road hard in his first months in office, he can upend decades of globalisation at a stroke. But as the world learned in the course of the Covid pandemic, ‘just-in-time’ supply chains are fragile and easily destroyed.\n\nBringing manufacturing back to America’s Rust Belt will take decades, if it is possible at all. And a truly ‘autarkic’ approach – which would mean using only the resources and labour available inside the borders of the United States – is a hopeless exercise, whatever nostalgic appeal it might hold for some.\n\nAny realistic understanding must acknowledge that the current US-China trading relationship is deep, vast and fiendishly hard to unravel.\n\nIn 2024, the US imported $440billion (£344billion) of goods from China. Some $145billion went in the opposite direction, leading to America’s $294billion trade deficit in goods. That is far smaller, by the way, than the $1trillion shortfall that Trump regularly cites in his speeches.\n\nOne surprising aspect of US-China commerce is the nature of the trade. Developing economies usually sell raw materials to the more sophisticated Western nations. Yet it is China which today buys unsophisticated agricultural produce such as soybeans and oil seed from the US, while America purchases advanced technology from China, including mobile phones and equipment for Tesla electric vehicles.\n\nThis odd relationship is among the reasons that the shares in Apple and Tesla – two of the ‘Magnificent Seven’ US tech companies – have fallen so heavily in the current shake-out.\n\nAnd there is another fear now cascading through financial markets – that Beijing has decided to turn up the heat on Wall Street.\n\nYears of super-sized trade surpluses mean that China has accumulated trillions of dollars of reserves held in the form of US bonds known as ‘Treasuries’.\n\nBy selling down these holdings it can contribute to mayhem on Wall Street as the glut of bonds available on the market would send yields – interest rate returns – on issues of new bonds soaring as the US government attempts to attract buyers.\n\nThat would weaken the dollar on foreign exchange markets and undermine its role as the world’s reserve currency.\n\nIf this is how it does indeed play out, not only would Donald Trump have ignited an unwinnable beggar-thy-neighbour trade war, he would have unleashed a financial crisis which could destroy prosperity and savings well beyond the US.\n\nHopefully, more sensible Trump aides – such as billionaire Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent – can restore common sense to proceedings before a war of the worlds erupts.\n\nTo date, the chaos unleashed by the White House has provoked fear – hence the stock market plunges – and a great deal of harsh rhetoric.\n\nBut the threat that the US-China relationship could descend into military hostilities is all too real.\n\nSuch a prospect has been raised by Harvard thinker Graham Allison, who postulated that when an emerging power challenges a ruling power, it almost always ends in war.\n\nIt is worth recalling that the 1812 war between Britain and America – when British forces set fire to the White House – had its origins in a trade dispute.\n\nThe economic conflagration engendered by Trump’s pernicious policies might yet spread further – to still more dangerous territory.","summary":"Strategic analysts have long forecast that the competition for supremacy between the world's economic superpowers, the United States and China , would end in

There are still people buried under the rubble,\" he said.First responders and neighbours worked to break through the concrete floor of an entire storey that collapsed in the strike and trapped residents, AFP footage showed.Taking turns swinging a sledgehammer through the thick, hard surface, they eventually broke a hole through which the bodies of children were extracted and taken away wrapped in dusty blankets.- 'Move towards recognition' -When asked by AFP about the strike, the Israeli military said it \"struck a senior Hamas terrorist who was responsible for planning and executing terrorist attacks\" from the area. It did not give the target's name.Hamas condemned the strike as one of the \"most heinous acts of genocide.\"Israel resumed intense strikes on the Gaza Strip on March 18, ending a two-month ceasefire with Hamas. Efforts to restore the truce have so far failed.The health ministry in the Hamas-run territory said on Wednesday that at least 1,482 Palestinians have been killed in the renewed Israeli operations, taking the overall death toll since the start of the war to 50,846.Hamas's October 2023 attack that triggered the war resulted in the deaths of 1,218 people on the Israeli side, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally based on Israeli official figures.The strike came as CIA chief John Ratcliffe visited Jerusalem on Wednesday, days before the US holds nuclear talks with Iran and amid continued attempts to revive a ceasefire in Gaza.Meanwhile, Macron said France could recognise a Palestinian state as early as June.\"We must move towards recognition, and we will do so in the coming months,\" Macron told France 5 television.\"I believe that at some point it will be right and because I also want to participate in a collective dynamic, which must also allow all those who defend Palestine to recognise Israel in turn, which many of them do not do,\" he added.Palestinian minister of state for foreign affairs Varsen Aghabekian Shahin told AFP that France's recognition of Palestinian statehood \"would be a step in the right direction in line with safeguarding the rights of the Palestinian people and the two state solution\".(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)","summary":"Israel said Wednesday its troops were seizing \"large areas\" in Gaza and making the Palestinian territory \"smaller and more isolated\", as an air strike on a residential block killed at least 23 people.","url":"https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/israel-hamas-war-israel-says-seizing-large-areas-of-gaza-as-strike-kills-23-8128987","image":"https://c.ndtvimg.com/2025-04/13qa8hcs_gaza_625x300_10_April_25.jpeg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-10 00:32:26","author":"Agence France-Presse","authors":["Agence France-Presse"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"in","sentiment":-0.414},{"id":309518622,"title":"Israel kuasai kawasan luas di Gaza, serangan udara ragut 23 nyawa","text":"GAZA CITY: Israel memaklumkan tenteranya kini menguasai kawasan yang luas di Gaza serta menjadikan wilayah Palestin itu semakin kecil dan terasing.\n\nKenyataan Menteri Pertahanan Israel, Israel Katz itu dibuat ketika ketenteraan negara itu meneruskan serangan baharu ke atas wilayah yang sudah musnah akibat perang, sekali gus menyebabkan ratusan ribu penduduk kehilangan tempat tinggal.\n\nSerangan udara yang dilancarkan ke atas sebuah blok kediaman meragut sekurang-kurangnya 23 nyawa.\n\nDalam masa sama, sekatan bantuan memburukkan lagi ancaman kebuluran terhadap 2.4 juta penduduk Gaza.\n\nSementara itu, Presiden Perancis, Emmanuel Macron berkata, Perancis merancang untuk mengiktiraf negara Palestin dalam beberapa bulan akan datang. \n\nKeadaan itu disifatkan sebagai satu langkah berisiko mencetuskan ketegangan dengan Israel yang bertegas bahawa sebarang pengiktirafan oleh negara luar adalah terlalu awal.\n\nKatz dalam lawatannya ke Koridor Morag yang baru diumumkan, antara bandar Rafah dan Khan Yunis, berkata kawasan besar kini dirampas dan ditambah kepada zon keselamatan Israel, menyebabkan Gaza menjadi lebih kecil dan lebih terasing.\n\nBeliau menegaskan bahawa Israel akan terus meningkatkan tekanan terhadap Gaza sehingga semua tebusan dibebaskan dan Hamas ditewaskan.\n\nKatz turut menyatakan bahawa Israel menyokong rancangan untuk 'penghijrahan secara sukarela'... selaras dengan visi Presiden Amerika Syarikat (AS), yang mana sedang diusaha untuk dilaksanakan. \n\nPresiden AS, Donald Trump, sebelum ini mencadangkan rancangan untuk membangunkan Gaza menjadi 'Riviera Timur Tengah' dengan memindahkan penduduknya ke tempat lain.\n\nSementara itu, agensi pertahanan awam Gaza memaklumkan bahawa satu serangan udara Israel ke atas sebuah bangunan kediaman di Bandar Gaza mengorbankan sekurang-kurangnya 23 orang, majoritinya wanita dan kanak-kanak.\n\nTentera Israel berkata ia menyasarkan seorang pejuang kanan Hamas.\n\nSerangan itu berlaku di kejiranan Shujaiya, menurut jurucakap agensi terbabit, Mahmud Bassal kepada AFP.\n\n\"Masih terdapat mangsa yang terperangkap di bawah runtuhan,\" katanya.\n\nPenduduk Shujaiya, Ayub Salim, 26, berkata kepada AFP bahawa kawasan itu diserang dengan peluru berpandu dan merupakan kawasan padat dengan khemah, orang yang dipindahkan serta rumah kediaman.\n\n\"Debu dan kemusnahan menyelubungi seluruh kawasan, kami tidak nampak apa-apa, hanya terdengar jeritan dan panik dari orang ramai,\" katanya.

The vote was 219-213, with just one Republican, Rep. Mike Turner of Ohio, joining all Democrats in opposing it. The bill now heads to the Senate, where it would almost certainly be blocked by a Democratic filibuster if brought to the floor. Trump and many of his allies on the far right had been pushing House Republicans to take a more extreme step and attempt to impeach judges that stood in his way. The \"No Rogue Rulings Act,\" authored by Rep. Darrell Issa, R-Calif., doesn’t go that far, but it allows House Republicans to voice their support for Trump on the issue while avoiding politically perilous impeachment votes that would be all but doomed to fail. In a brief interview, Issa argued that both parties would benefit from the legislation. He said during President Joe Biden's administration, Democrats howled when conservative judges issued nationwide injunctions against his executive actions. \"This is a growing problem that has vexed both Republican and Democrat presidents,\" Issa, a senior member of the Judiciary Committee and the former chairman of the Oversight Committee, told NBC News before the vote. Biden, \"to the very end, was trying to get this process of activist judges exceeding their jurisdiction rolled back.\" This bill, Issa said, \"limits judges to the original intent, which will allow them to make decisions but only as to the plaintiffs.\" The House vote comes as Trump and his allies have grown frustrated with lower-court judges issuing injunctions blocking the president’s actions on deportations of undocumented immigrants, sweeping cuts and mass firings at federal agencies, ending birthright citizenship, and other matters. Much of Republicans' criticism has centered on U.S. District Judge James Boasberg, who halted Trump's use of the Alien Enemies Act to deport Venezuelan migrants alleged to be Tren de Aragua gang members. After that decision, Rep. Brandon Gill, R-Texas, a Trump ally, introduced a resolution to impeach Boasberg, who is based in Washington, D.C. Other judges who have ruled against Trump also have faced impeachment threats, including U.S. District Judges Paul A. Engelmayer and John Bates. But GOP leaders have acknowledged such impeachment resolutions wouldn't have enough support to pass out of the House, where Republicans hold a narrow 220-213 majority. On top of that, 67 votes would be needed for a conviction in the Senate, where Republicans have a 53-47 majority. In some high-profile cases, the conservative-leaning Supreme Court has been ruling in Trump’s favor. On Monday, the high court tosses out Boasberg’s decision blocking the removal of the alleged gang members to El Salvador. A day later, the Supreme Court halted a ruling by U.S. District Judge William Alsup of California requiring some federal agencies to reinstate roughly 16,000 workers the Trump administration had tried to fire. Rep. Jamie Raskin of Maryland, the top Democrat on the Judiciary Committee, said his party in the past has tried to block \"judicial forum shopping,\" where plaintiffs try to pick a court where they have a higher chance of winning. \"But a nationwide injunction is a necessary part of the judicial tool kit,\" said Raskin, a former constitutional law professor. \"Why should every person affected [by an issue] have to go to court? Why should millions of people have to create their own case?\" \"Why should Brown vs. Board of Education have applied to just Linda Brown as opposed to everybody affected?\" he added.","summary":"House Republicans passed a bill aiming to curb district court judges' ability to issue nationwide injunctions, which have stymied Trump's agenda.","url":"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/house-votes-rein-federal-judges-trumps-attacks-courts-rcna200396","image":"https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-1500w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-04/250409-Darrell-Issa-se-939a-6f5367.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-10 00:31:22","author":"Scott Wong","authors":["Scott Wong"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"na","sentiment":-0.24},{"id":309519640,"title":"Art Of The Deal?

We wrote it up from our hearts, right? It was written from the heart, and I think it was well written too.\"What emerged was a lengthy post on his Truth Social network at 1:18 pm local time (1718 GMT) saying that Trump had \"authorized a 90 day PAUSE\" in tariffs, except on China, which he punished with even higher levies of 125 percent.Trump's administration insisted it was all part of a grand strategy that had brought 75 countries to the negotiating table in his quest to reduce America's trade deficit.\"Many of you in the media clearly missed the art of the deal,\" Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters afterward.Lutnick posted that he and Bessent \"sat with the President while he wrote one of the most extraordinary Truth posts of his Presidency.\"The White House posted a picture of Trump at the Resolute Desk in the Oval Office, flanked by Lutnick and Bessent, with his mobile phone in front of him.It also posted one of Trump's own posts from 2014, reading: \"Deals are my art form. Other people paint beautifully or write poetry. I like making deals, preferably big deals.\"As markets made a turbocharged rebound, Trump hosted a group of racing drivers with their brightly-colored cars at the White House.Trump said the markets had become \"a little bit yippy, a little bit afraid -- unlike these champions,\" as he pointed to the drivers.\"Liberation Week\" turned out to be a frantic one in which the White House struggled to get its message straight about whether or not it was prepared to negotiate.Trump spent the weekend in Florida playing golf, but appeared touchy as he flew back to Washington, saying that \"sometimes you have to take medicine to fix something\" in reference to the tariffs.Lutnick, who has become one of Trump's top cheerleaders, repeatedly said there would be no negotiations, as did trade advisor Peter Navarro.But then Bessent was rolled out on Monday to deliver a softer message that, indeed, negotiations might be possible.What followed was the remarkable spectacle of Trump's tariff-skeptical aide Elon Musk publicly branding Navarro \"dumber than a sack of bricks.\"But by Wednesday evening it was over -- for 90 days at least -- and the White House was keen to turn attention towards the stock markets, where the Nasdaq had its biggest single day leap since 2001, while the Dow Jones had its best day since 2020 and the S&P 500 its best since 2008.Trump, who spent most of the week bashing allies and adversaries alike, struck a magnanimous tone about his announcement. \"It was written as something that I think was very positive for the world and for us,\" he said.","summary":"It ended not with a bang, but with US President Donald Trump and two top aides writing a social media post.","url":"https://www.ibtimes.com/art-deal-how-trump-backed-down-tariffs-3769489","image":"https://d.ibtimes.com/en/full/4592818/us-president-donald-trump-abruptly-backed-down-his-global-trade-war-90-day-tariff-pause-most.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-10 00:30:11","author":"Danny Kemp","authors":["Danny Kemp"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.063},{"id":309519776,"title":"‘West Wing’ star Bradley Whitford rages against old boss Jeff Bezos, tells him to ‘f–king speak up’ against Trump","text":"“The Handmaid’s Tale” star Bradley Whitford told his former boss Jeff Bezos to “f—— speak up” against President Donald Trump in a fiery interview on Tuesday.\n\nThe actor took aim at his current and former bosses for not taking a direct stand against Trump, telling Variety that entertainment industry executives were “staying silent while their daughters’ rights are being torn away.”\n\n“You know, misogyny is at the reptilian brainstem of these right-wing Christian white nationalists.

Its best-known and most intricate part was the Berlin Wall.\nIn 1989, the Iron Curtain came down altogether, as all Eastern European countries shed communism, the Soviet Union collapsed, and the Cold War ended. The military installations, watchtowers and barbed wire that used to secure this extremely sensitive spot back then were quickly removed after the Velvet Revolution in Czechoslovakia that ended communist rule.\nThe gate is made of white stone and its pillars are peppered with artificial bullet holes of border guards; however, the iron bars are broken as a symbol of the final victory of freedom.\nEarlier, President Murmu held a meeting with her Slovakian counterpart, Peter Pellegrini, in Bratislava.

tariffs targeting key US trading partners, President Donald Trump sent the world economy into a tailspin Wednesday before backing down hours later -- with a 90-day reprieve for all but China.Here is a rundown of what tariffs Trump has implemented in his second presidency, as a trade fight between Washington and Beijing again heats up.- China focus -China faces the harshest of Trump's tariffs, with a staggering rate of 125 percent.While Trump's earlier actions brought this year's new US tariffs on Chinese goods to 104 percent Wednesday, he said the same day that he would raise the level further.The figure included a 20-percent levy over China's alleged role in the fentanyl supply chain, a 34-percent tariff over trade practices Washington deemed unfair and a 50-percent duty after Beijing unveiled retaliation plans.(function(v,d,o,ai){ai=d.createElement(\"script\");ai.defer=true;ai.async=true;ai.src=v.location.protocol+o;d.head.appendChild(ai);})(window, document, \"//a.vdo.ai/core/v-ndtv/vdo.ai.js\");Beijing, in turn, has matched the last of Trump's actions with an 84-percent tariff on US goods due to take effect Thursday.Trump's fresh tariffs on Chinese imports stack atop existing ones from previous administrations.- Global tariffs -While Trump reserved his heaviest blow for rival China, other US allies and partners have not entirely been spared.On April 5, US trading partners were slapped with a 10-percent \"baseline\" tariff, which remains in effect for economies including the European Union, Japan and Vietnam.There are notable exceptions to this duty.The United States' immediate neighbors Canada and Mexico, which were earlier targeted over illegal immigration and fentanyl, are not affected by the 10-percent global tariff.Also off the hook from these are copper, pharmaceuticals, semiconductors and lumber -- although these are sectors that Trump is mulling levies on.Gold and silver, as well as energy commodities, are also excluded.- Autos, metals -There are some sectors that Trump has quickly hit with tariffs.In March, he imposed a 25-percent levy on steel and aluminum imports.And early this month, a 25-percent tariff on imported autos took effect, with the rate to eventually affect vehicle parts as well.But autos imported under the US-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) can qualify for a lower rate, while compliant auto parts are also tariff-free until a process is set up to target non-US content.- Canada, Mexico -Canadian and Mexican imports were initially hard hit by 25-percent US tariffs -- with Canadian energy products facing a lower rate.Trump targeted both neighbors saying they did not do enough on illegal immigration and the flow of illicit drugs across borders.But he eventually announced exemptions for goods entering his country under the USMCA, covering large swathes of products, while potash used as fertilizer got a lower rate as well.- Retaliation -Besides incoming 84-percent tariffs on US goods, Beijing also earlier retaliated by targeting American agricultural products like poultry, wheat and cotton.Canada has countered Trump's initial duties and metals tariffs with its own levies on some Can$60 billion in US goods, including steel and computers.Meanwhile on Wednesday, the EU adopted its first measures hitting back at the Trump administration, targeting over 20 billion euros ($21.9 billion) of American goods like soybeans, motorcycles and beauty products.The duties will start to be collected mid-April, and came in pushback against Trump's metals tariffs.- Other threats -Trump has opened the door for 25-percent tariffs on goods from countries importing Venezuelan oil, a measure that could hit China and India.He has also threatened similar \"secondary tariffs\" involving Russian oil.He previously raised the possibility of tariffs on sectors like pharmaceuticals and semiconductors too, and has ordered investigations into copper and lumber imports.Washington also has an ongoing investigation into China's practices in the maritime and shipbuilding sector, which could bring about new punitive action.(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff

House vote on Trump tax agenda after GOP rebellion threatened defeat","text":"Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., is delaying a key vote on legislation aimed at advancing President Donald Trump's agenda in the face of a likely rebellion on Wednesday evening. It comes as fiscal hawks in the lower chamber have raised alarms at the Senate's version of the plan, which guarantees far fewer spending cuts than the House's initial offering. Johnson told reporters he would aim to hold the vote Thursday, the last scheduled day in session for House lawmakers before a two-week recess. He added, however, that lawmakers could be kept in session next week if needed to pass the legislation. \"I don't think we'll have a vote on this tonight, but probably in the morning,\" the speaker said. \"We want everybody to have a high degree of comfort about what is happening here, and we have a small subset of members who weren't totally satisfied with the product as it stands. So we're going to we're going to talk about maybe going to conference with the Senate or add an amendment, but we're going to make that decision.\" HOUSE FREEDOM CAUCUS CHAIR URGES JOHNSON TO CHANGE COURSE ON SENATE VERSION OF TRUMP BUDGET BILL He also said there were multiple ways the House could move forward and Republicans would look at each one. Johnson said, \"Everything is moving along just fine. We have a little bit of room here to work, and we're going to use that.\" The House floor was paralyzed for over an hour during an earlier unrelated vote as Johnson met with Republican holdouts behind closed doors. Two sources in the room said the holdouts did not speak with Trump, though it's not clear if he called people individually. Outside that room, in the cavernous House chamber, lawmakers began filtering out or impatiently pacing as time went by with little information. Democrats, meanwhile, began calling for Republican leaders to close the lingering vote. Tensions were high for those GOP lawmakers who remained on the House floor, Fox News Digital was told – and much of that frustration is aimed at Johnson. \"I think he's quickly losing faith from the rest of us. I mean, he kept the entire conference out on the floor for 80 minutes while you play grab-a-- with these people,\" one House Republican fumed. \"And all day it was like, ‘Oh, we’re going to get this done.'\" That House Republican said, \"All the chatter we were hearing was [holdouts were] down to single digits. But 17, 20 people were in that room. So clearly there was a much bigger problem than they were letting on all day.\" The gap between the House and Senate versions is significant; the House version that passed in late February calls for at least $1.5 trillion in spending cuts, while the Senate's plan mandates at least $4 billion. Some conservatives are also wary of congressional leaders looking to use the current policy baseline to factor the total amount of dollars the bill will add to the federal deficit. The current policy baseline allows lawmakers to essentially zero out the cost of extending Trump's 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) because they are already in effect. \"We've got to have something more substantive out of the Senate. If you were going to sell your house, and I offered you a third of the price, you would laugh,\" Rep. Andy Ogles, R-Tenn., one of the earliest holdouts, told reporters on Wednesday. MEET THE TRUMP-PICKED LAWMAKERS GIVING SPEAKER JOHNSON A FULL HOUSE GOP CONFERENCE Trump has directed Republicans to work on \"one big, beautiful bill\" to advance his agenda on border security, defense, energy and taxes. Such a measure is largely only possible via the budget reconciliation process. Traditionally used when one party controls all three branches of government, reconciliation lowers the Senate's threshold for passage of certain fiscal measures from 60 votes to 51. As a result, it has been used to pass broad policy changes in one or two massive pieces of legislation. The first step traditionally involves both chambers of Congress passing an identical \"framework\" with instructions for relevant committees to hash out policy priorities in line with the spending levels in the initial legislation. The House passed its own version of the reconciliation framework earlier this year, while the Senate passed an amended version last week. House GOP leaders now believe that voting on the Senate's plan will allow Republicans to enter the next step of crafting policy. \"Why does President Trump call it one big, beautiful bill? Because it does a lot of critically important things, all in one bill, that help get this country back on a strong footing. And what else it does is it produces incredibly needed savings,\" House Majority Leader Steve Scalise, R-La., said during debate on the bill. The legislation as laid out would add more money for border security, including Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), as well as some new funding for defense. Republicans are also looking to repeal significant portions of former President Joe Biden's green energy policies, and institute new Trump policies like eliminating taxes on tipped and overtime wages. But House conservatives had demanded added assurances from the Senate to show they are serious about cutting spending.

Donald Trump is just so unpredictable that these things are par for the course.”\n\nThat level of significant uncertainty from the world’s largest economy is sparking chaos across the globe, including in Australia.\n\nIt makes forecasting the RBA’s next move on interest rates a little challenging.\n\nOver the past week, as share markets melted down on the back of Mr Trump’s declaration of a trade war, there were calls here for the RBA board to call an emergency meeting and slash the cash rate.\n\n“I think everyone went into hyper drive a little,” Dr Oliver said. “That was probably a bit far.\n\n“This development pulls back a little bit on those expectations, but I think we’re still going to get at least 25 basis points in May, and there’s maybe a 50 per cent chance we’ll get 50 basis points.\n\n“Obviously, a lot depends on what happens between now and then.”\n\nData from comparison service Canstar shows a standard rate cut next month would slash $76 per month off the repayments on a $500,000 mortgage.\n\nIf it was super-sized, that figure would leap to $151 per month, providing some good breathing room for stretched household budgets.\n\nWhat’s firming is the high likelihood of more rate cuts throughout the year than otherwise would’ve been the case, he said.\n\n“We had expectations for two cuts, but we’ll probably end up with four.”\n\nFears of an imminent collapse in the global economy have certainly eased with the 90-day pause, John Hawkins, a senior lecturer at the University of Canberra’s School of Politics, Economics and Society, said.\n\n“But even with the pause, China’s tariff rate is up to 125 per cent, so there’s still a war between the world’s two largest economies,” Dr Hawkins said.\n\n“And China is out largest export market, so that’s disturbing for us. Plus, we don’t get a reprieve – we’re still on 10 per cent anyway.”\n\nAfter its last meeting, the RBA board released a statement that contained the word “uncertain” five times, he pointed out.\n\n“I’m not sure how many more times it’ll be said in the next statement.\n\n“For now, it’s the US and China relationship that’s suffering, rather than the US and everywhere. Maybe that means the 50 basis point cut is less likely and we see 25 basis points being more likely, with another 25 at the meeting after.”\n\nThe March quarter CPI data, which will be released on April 30, will be crucial in shaping the board’s decision-making.\n\n“I would expect it’ll show the underlying rate of inflation getting under three per cent and the headline rate in the low two per cent range,” Dr Hawkins said. \n\n“I think that’ll give the bank enough confidence to feel we don’t need a tight monetary policy, so a modest easing would be reasonable.”\n\nIn the meantime, he said “significant damage” had been inflicted on global economies, and even though Mr Trump has blinked, what happens next is anyone’s guess.\n\n“It seems to be a function of how obsequious leaders are in paying tributes to the president and what they can offer,” he said.\n\n“I feel sorry for any business leader trying to make decisions about where to invest, where to locate production facilities and so on, when the situation can change – and does change – day to day like this. In some cases within a day. \n\n“I suspect a lot of people will just decide to sit on their hands and see what happens. A lot of people are likely hoping things settle down into some sort of pattern so they can make decisions. \n\n“It’s bad for global economic activity.”\n\nDr Oliver agreed that a new era of uncertainty and instability seems to be “par for the course”.\n\n“Just yesterday, he was talking about more tariffs on pharmaceuticals, semiconductors, cooper and so on. It’s too early to say it’s over.”\n\nHe noted that today’s development shows Mr Trump has likely “hit a pain threshold” with US shares down 20 per cent.\n\n“The big positive is that he’s blinked. That suggests he’s getting nervous,” Mr Oliver said.\n\nBut the deteriorating relationship with China will further damage the global economy and Australia is “heavily exposed” to those consequences.\n\nThe RBA board next meets on March 4. The official cash rate current sits at 4.1 per cent.","summary":"Yesterday, economists were tipping a super-sized rate cut when the RBA meets in a few weeks, but a lot can change in 24 hours – thanks to Donald Trump.","url":"https://www.news.com.au/finance/economy/interest-rates/donald-trumps-economic-chaos-hits-outlook-for-australias-interest-rates/news-story/89cbaf27aaaf6a585a9870ca2b19ba1c?from=rss-basic","image":"https://content.api.news/v3/images/bin/b87f0f1cce976cdc8d6100fbca67f75f","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-10 00:14:53","author":"Shannon Molloy","authors":["Shannon Molloy"],"language":"en","source_country":"au","sentiment":-0.387},{"id":309519854,"title":"What is the Mar-a-Lago Accord and could it explain Trump's tariff chaos?","text":"Donald Trump's so-called \"Liberation Day\" tariffs have caused chaos, up-ending stock markets and sending world leaders scrambling.\n\nAccording to the Trump administration, more than 70 countries are lining up to try and negotiate their way out of the new levies of up to 49 per cent — which have mostly now been \"paused\".\n\n\"These countries are calling us up, kissing my ass,\" the US president told a Republican event this week in Washington.\n\nMany have pre-emptively offered to cut their tariffs on US imports and start buying more American exports.\n\nBut Mr Trump and his advisers may have a much bigger prize in mind.\n\nSome believe the tariffs are just the first step in a grand strategy to reshape global trade, boost US manufacturing, reduce the US budget deficit and make America's allies pay for the US security umbrella.\n\nIt's being called the Mar-a-Lago Accord.\n\nIt's never been confirmed by the Trump administration and is widely regarded by economists as a terrible idea that won't work.\n\nBut that doesn't necessarily mean that Mr Trump isn't going to try and make it happen.\n\nWhat is the Mar-a-Lago Accord?\n\nThe details are complicated and involve a lot of finance theory.\n\nPut simply, the plan is essentially to get other key economies to agree to pump up their own currencies and help devalue the US dollar.\n\nThis would hopefully achieve the US administration's stated goals of making goods produced in America more competitive and boost its manufacturing industry.\n\nHowever, it would also make participants' exports less competitive.\n\nThe accord was outlined among a range of options in an essay last year by economist Stephen Miran, who has since been appointed chairperson of the US Council of Economic Advisers.\n\nIn the paper, Mr Miran argues the \"overvaluation\" of the US dollar is the reason for America's large trade deficit.\n\n\"Such overvaluation makes US exports less competitive, US imports cheaper, and handicaps American manufacturing,\" Mr Miran wrote.\n\nThe Mar-A-Lago Accord references Mr Trump's Florida resort Mar-a-Lago and the Plaza Accord of 1985 in which America's allies Germany, Japan, the UK and France agreed at New York's Plaza Hotel to jointly devalue the US dollar to boost America's industrial performance.\n\nMr Miran wrote that important economies such as China's and those in Europe would be less willing now to join a new accord, but tariffs could be a useful \"stick\".\n\n\"President Trump views tariffs as generating negotiating leverage for making deals,\" Mr Miran wrote.\n\nHe wrote that a currency accord with major economies could involve partner countries selling US dollar assets and swapping short-term US treasuries for century bonds.\n\nUS treasuries, or treasury bonds, pay interest over their term while century bonds don't and are only returned with an increased value once they mature after 50 or 100 years.\n\nThis could help finance the staggering costs of America's world-spanning military, he said.\n\nMr Miran said that under a currency accord plan, both tariffs and the threat of the US withdrawing security guarantees from countries involved in the deal would be used to ensure compliance with it.\n\nHe suggested that US security, trade and finance are joined, and that there was interest in getting countries to pay for America's security guarantees.\n\nMr Miran has described his paper as a \"menu\" of options, and said he wasn't advocating any particular option.\n\nWhen asked by Bloomberg last month if some kind of currency accord was in the works, Mr Miran said Mr Trump was \"very clear that he wants to start with tariffs\".\n\n\"We are starting with tariffs,\" he said.\n\n\"Could a [currency pact] be something that is entertained down the road? Sure it could. But right now the president is focused on tariffs.\"\n\n'A new economic golden age'\n\nComments from Mr Trump's team seem to hint it has something big planned.\n\nSecretary of the Treasury Scott Bessent said during a Senate Finance Committee hearing in January that Mr Trump has a \"generational opportunity to unleash a new economic golden age that will create more jobs, wealth and prosperity for all Americans\".\n\nPeter Navarro, Mr Trump's senior counsellor for trade and manufacturing, has made it clear that other countries offering to lower their tariffs will not be enough.\n\n\"They're coming now and saying we want to talk, we'll lower our tariffs to zero if you lower your tariffs,\" he told Fox News this week. \"That's not the problem. Vietnam is a great example.\"\n\n\"They sell us $15 for every one we sell them. Zero tariffs would get us no reduction in the $123 billion deficit we have.\"\n\nDespite this, not everyone is convinced there's a strategy in the works.\n\nDavid Henig, from the European Centre of International Political Economy, told the ABC there were a lot of people pushing their ideas for how the world economic system could change.\n\n\"None of them obviously to me have captured the attention of President Trump,\" Mr Henig said.\n\nMr Henig said while it wasn't impossible, it was hard to see the tariffs now \"as a first step in some bigger strategy\" toward a complex currency accord.\n\n\"I think you would need some nifty footwork of the likes we haven't really seen from this administration … to get to a point where countries want to do deals with you like the really sophisticated Plaza Accord.\"\n\nWhy wouldn't the Mar-a-Lago Accord work?\n\nIn an opinion piece for the Lowy Interpreter, former chief economist at the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade Jenny Gordon wrote that the ideas outlined by Mr Miran were unlikely to deliver the reduced deficits and bring back the good jobs that were the primary motivation.\n\nDr Gordon said the logic was flawed for a number of reasons including that:\n\nThe US would need to borrow money to reinvest in its manufacturing sector, which would increase the value of the US dollar — the opposite of what the accord aims to do;Changing consumer patterns, technology and aging populations had done as much, if not more than global trade, to drive well-paying jobs out of America's industrial heartland; andThe plan would see countries move away from the US dollar as the reserve currency, and Mr Trump has said he doesn't want that.\n\nShe concluded that countries were not likely to want to sign up to any deal because of Mr Trump's conduct.\n\n\"Trump's treatment of allies will hardly provide reassurance that complying with such an accord will buy stability. Even if quite a few countries do comply, it will not solve the US deficit problem,\" she said.\n\nLord Daniel Hannan, president of the Initiative for Free Trade and a member of the UK House of Lords, told the ABC Mr Trump's policy was \"the most damaging policy and utterly needless\".\n\n\"It's completely self-inflicted,\" Lord Hannan said.\n\n\"If you did think that manufacturing deficits were a problem this is not how you would go about fixing it.\n\n\"It's not possible to simultaneously to tackle the deficit problem and to keep a devalued US dollar as the world's currency.\"\n\nHe said countries around the world wouldn't agree to things that weren't in their economic interest because the US wanted them to.\n\nIn his essay, Mr Miran said that the US needed to offer incentives for trading partners to come on board with the currency accord.\n\nSo far, Mr Trump has used tariffs only as a bargaining tool to reduce import levies on US goods abroad and raise revenue at home.\n\nJapan first to negotiate US tariffs\n\nAmong the first countries Mr Trump's team has agreed to meet with is Japan.\n\nThe United States is Japan's biggest export destination, with roughly 28 per cent of the total comprised of automobile shipments.\n\nMr Trump's decision to slap a 25 per cent levy on auto imports, and a reciprocal 24 per cent tariff on other Japanese goods is expected to deal a huge blow to Japan's economy.\n\nSome analysts predict the higher duties could knock up to 0.8 percentage points off economic growth.\n\nJapan also depends on the US military for protection.\n\nUnusually, US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent is leading the negotiating team, posting on X that the US would \"work to enact the President's vision for a new Golden Age of Global Trade\".\n\nTrade talks are usually led by the US trade representative.\n\nJapan's former top currency diplomat, Naoyuki Shinohara, told Reuters any US attempt to secure a coordinated depreciation of the US dollar through a 1985 Plaza Accord-type deal likely wouldn't work, because it would require the consent of China and Europe.\n\nMr Shinohara said unlike the Plaza Accord, when the United States worked only with close allies, Washington would need to engage more countries — including the China and European Union — to weaken the dollar effectively in a globalised market.\n\n\"Currency intervention, even if coordinated among nations, has become less effective because markets have become so big,\" he said.\n\nHe added that Mr Trump's decision to impose levies on China and Europe would make it extremely difficult to gain their consent.\n\nBoth have responded with tariffs of their own, with the US and China involved in an escalating tit-for-tat battle.\n\n\"In times like now, you need China to be in the loop, as well as European nations. That would be quite hard under the current circumstances,\" Mr Shinohara told Reuters in an interview.","summary":"As countries and markets grapple with the ongoing fallout from his tariff policy, some are wondering if Donald Trump has a bigger plan to overhaul global trade and reset America's industrial economy.","url":"https://www.abc.net.au/news/2025-04-10/what-is-the-mar-a-lago-accord-donald-trump-tariff-policy/105153862","image":"https://live-production.wcms.abc-cdn.net.au/51672b3ca533c1e70fdee0b43df53c73?impolicy=wcms_crop_resize&cropH=2809&cropW=4994&xPos=0&yPos=0&width=862&height=485","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-10 00:12:03","author":"Patrick Martin,Will Jackson","authors":["Patrick Martin","Will Jackson"],"language":"en","source_country":"AU","sentiment":-0.172},{"id":309520532,"title":"Trump tariff backdown boosts ASX, jumping up on the open","text":"The Australian sharemarket has burst out of the gates on Thursday, as US President Donald Trump pauses the bulk of his sweeping tariffs.\n\nThe ASX 200 jumped 5.8 per cent to 7,809 points in the first 15 minutes of trading on Thursday.\n\nThe futures markets had predicted it would rise 6 per cent during the day for the biggest daily gain since March 2020.

We’ll continue to argue the case.\n\n“The changes that have occurred from day-to-day, what they emphasise is the need for a considered, calibrated, clear position when negotiating over these international issues, including with the Trump Administration.\n\n“That is why you have to be an adult. You do not dial it up to 11 at every opportunity, which is Peter Dutton’s plan is on everything.”\n\nAsked how he had strengthened ties with China since the tariff announcement, Mr Albanese said “China is by a long distance our major trading partner”.\n\nMr Albanese was in Cairns on Thursday and was asked about North Queensland ties with China.\n\n“I think there is a lot of opportunity to grow tourism, in particular, from the Chinese market,” he said.\n\nThe National Australia Bank forecasts the Reserve Bank will slash the cash rate by 50 basis points next month, with 25 point cuts in July, August, November and February.\n\n“Headwinds from the global environment have intensified, but error bounds around our forecast are large given uncertainty remains exceptionally elevated,” NAB chief economist Sally Auld said in a note.","summary":"US President Donald Trump’s wild backdown on tariffs has lifted Wall Street and sent the Australian sharemarket shooting up.","url":"https://thewest.com.au/business/trump-tariff-backdown-boosts-asx-jumping-up-on-the-open-c-18324201","image":"https://images.thewest.com.au/publication/C-18324201/292679c5dc07b20b2bff24b6b3f09d3022abf293-16x9-x0y192w2048h1152.jpg?imwidth=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-10 00:11:37","author":"Blair Jackson","authors":["Blair Jackson"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"au","sentiment":-0.278},{"id":309514982,"title":"Trump pauses most tariffs but singles out China for a rate of 125 percent","text":"US President Donald Trump has increased China’s reciprocal tariff rate to 125 percent, up from the already staggering 104 percent that came into force yesterday, multiple media outlets report.

They operate military facilities and ground stations that extend their reach into space. They exploit natural resources and land to fuel China’s global military ambitions. China’s factory fishing fleets are stealing food from our nations and from our people.”\n\nHe added that war with China is “not inevitable,” and the U.S. does not seek war in any form. \n\n“Together, we must prevent war by robustly and vigorously deterring China’s threats in this hemisphere.” \n\nTo strengthen military ties with Panama and reassert influence over the canal, the U.S. will deploy the USNS Comfort, a Navy hospital ship, to the region.\n\nHegseth vowed Tuesday that the U.S. will “take back” the Panama Canal from Chinese influence, pointing to port operations controlled by Hong Kong-based CK Hutchison.\n\nThe secretary later said Wednesday that he and Panamanian officials would be signing an agreement that U.S. warships would travel “first and free” through the Panama Canal. \n\nLast month the conglomerate agreed to a $19 billion deal to sell a group of 43 ports, including two in Panama, to U.S.-based BlackRock, \n\nTrump hailed the agreement, seen as a solution to his complaints that the canal was owned by China, but now that deal may fall apart. \n\nChina has criticized the deal, opening up antitrust probes, and a Panamanian official has accused CK Hutchison of failing to properly renew its contract in 2021 and owing the country $300 million.\n\nAfter meeting with Mulino, Hegseth said Tuesday the U.S. will not allow China to threaten the canal’s operation. \n\n“To this end, the United States and Panama have done more in recent weeks to strengthen our defense and security cooperation than we have in decades,” he said.\n\nHegseth alluded to the ports owned by CK Hutchison. \n\n“China-based companies continue to control critical infrastructure in the canal area,” he said. \n\n“That gives China the potential to conduct surveillance activities across Panama. This makes Panama and the United States less secure, less prosperous and less sovereign. And as President Donald Trump has pointed out, that situation is not acceptable.”\n\nThe Chinese embassy in Panama hit back: “The U.S. has carried out a sensationalistic campaign about the ‘theoretical Chinese threat’ in an attempt to sabotage Chinese-Panamanian cooperation, which is all just rooted in the United States’ own geopolitical interests.”\n\nThe war of words in Panama comes as China and the U.S. are now locked in a trade war, where Trump slapped Chinese goods with a total 104% tariff. \n\nChina retaliated with 84% tariffs on U.S. goods.","summary":"Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth announced Wednesday that U.S. and Panama officials would sign a \"framework\" agreement allowing U.S. warships to travel \"first and free\" through the Panama Canal.","url":"https://nypost.com/2025/04/09/us-news/hegseth-says-panama-agreed-to-allow-us-warships-to-travel-first-and-free-through-canal/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/04/102217033.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-10 00:08:27","author":"Fox News","authors":["Fox News"],"language":"en","source_country":"zm","sentiment":-0.146},{"id":309516464,"title":"Trump orders probes of two former officials who defied him","text":"President Donald Trump directed federal agencies Wednesday to revoke the security clearances and review the activities of two high-level former government officials who questioned his election fraud claims and his conduct in his first term.

The memo relating to Krebs described him as a \"significant bad-faith actor who weaponized and abused his Government authority.\" The other memo said Taylor \"stoked dissension by manufacturing sensationalist reports on the existence of a supposed 'resistance' within the Federal Government.\" Krebs declined to comment. Taylor said on X that he wasn't surprised by Trump's actions. “I said this would happen,” Taylor wrote. “Dissent isn’t unlawful. It certainly isn’t treasonous. America is headed down a dark path.” He added: “Never has a man so inelegantly proved another man’s point.” Taylor wrote an anonymous op-ed while he was working at the Department of Homeland Security in which he said many senior administration officials were trying to limit Trump’s impulses and frustrate his agenda. In his memoir, Taylor describes having heard about Trump’s interest in “tapping” White House aides’ phones in a bid to stanch media leaks. Krebs was the first director of the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, which during the Trump administration began offering cybersecurity and physical security help to state and local election officials. Trump fired Krebs in a tweet in November 2020 over the agency’s Rumor Control website, which corrected falsehoods about election integrity, many of which Trump and his allies promoted. Krebs was among the most vocal government officials debunking baseless claims about election manipulation, particularly addressing a conspiracy theory centered on Dominion Voting Systems machines that Trump's lawyers have pushed. As a prominent critic of Trump’s false claims that the election 2020 was stolen, Krebs has been a consistent target for Trump.","summary":"President Trump directed federal agencies to revoke the security clearances and review the activities of Christopher Krebs and Miles Taylor.","url":"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/national-security/trump-orders-probes-two-former-officials-defied-rcna200523","image":"https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-1500w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2023-05/230531-Christopher-Krebs-mjf-1024-27e3cc.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-10 00:08:07","author":"David Rohde,Kevin Collier,Tom Winter","authors":["David Rohde","Kevin Collier","Tom Winter"],"language":"en","source_country":"na","sentiment":-0.212},{"id":309519770,"title":"Transgender fencer at center of controversy after female opponent refused to compete no longer on women’s team","text":"A transgender fencer, who competed in a USA Fencing-sponsored tournament and was at the center of controversy after an opponent protested against the organization’s gender-participation policies, is no longer on the Wagner College women’s fencing team.\n\nWagner College confirmed to Fox News Digital that Redmond Sullivan was off the team more than a week following the controversy at the Cherry Blossom Open in Maryland.\n\nSullivan is shown to have competed for the Wagner women’s team in the foil competition in several meets during the first half of the 2024-25 season.

The No Rogue Rulings Act, led by Rep. Darrell Issa, R-Calif., passed the House and limits district courts' power to issue U.S.-wide injunctions, instead forcing them to focus their scope on the parties directly affected in most cases. All but one Republican lawmaker voted for the bill, which passed 219 to 213. No Democrats voted in favor. The Trump administration has faced more than 15 nationwide injunctions since the Republican commander-in-chief took office, targeting a wide range of President Donald Trump's policies, from birthright citizenship reform to anti-diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) efforts. Issa himself was confident the bill would pass, telling Fox News Digital on Tuesday morning, \"We've got the votes.\" SENATE GOP PUSHES TRUMP BUDGET FRAMEWORK THROUGH AFTER MARATHON VOTE SERIES He was less certain of the bill getting Democratic support, though he noted former Biden administration solicitor general Elizabeth Prelogar made her own complaints about district judges' powers during the previous White House term. \"We're hoping some people look at it on its merits rather than its politics,\" Issa said. Rep. Derek Schmidt, R-Kan., who has an amendment on the bill aimed at limiting plaintiffs' ability to \"judge shop\" cases to favorable districts, told Fox News Digital before the vote, \"A lot of things get called commonsense around here, but this one genuinely is.\" \"The basic policy of trying to rein in the overuse of nationwide injunctions was supported by Democrats before. It's supported by Republicans now, and I'm hoping [this vote will] be supported by both,\" he said. Rep. Lance Gooden, R-Texas, who, like Schmidt and Issa, is a House Judiciary Committee member, told Fox News Digital after the bill's passage, \"Many Democrat-appointed lower court judges have conducted themselves like activist liberal lawyers in robes while attempting to stop President Trump's nationwide reforms. The No Rogue Rulings Act limits this unchecked power.\" Another GOP lawmaker, Rep. Randy Feenstra, R-Iowa, told Fox News Digital, \"More than 77 million Americans voted for [Trump's] pro-American policies and want to see them implemented quickly. There is no reason that activist judges whose authority does not extend nationally should be allowed to completely stop [his] agenda.\" Republicans' unity on the issue comes despite some early divisions over how to hit back at what they have called \"rogue\" and \"activist\" judges.

Sarah Wynn-Williams, who detailed her experience at Meta in the scathing memoir \"Careless People,\" testified before the Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on Crime and Counterterrorism that she witnessed Zuckerberg and other executives \"repeatedly undermine US national security and betray American values,\" the New York Post reported. Wynn-Williams served as the director of Global Public Policy at Facebook, now Meta, for nearly seven years starting in 2011. She said company executives \"did these things in secret to win favor with Beijing and build an $18 billion dollar business in China.\" Meta allegedly helped China develop advanced artificial intelligence to help outcompete American companies, she said.

CHINA&apos;S CENTRAL BANK CALLS ON STATE BANKS TO REDUCE US DOLLAR PURCHASES Among her allegations, Wynn-Williams said Meta&apos;s AI model \"has contributed significantly to Chinese advances in AI technologies like DeepSeek.\" In addition, Wynn-Williams also said Meta deleted the Facebook account of a prominent Chinese dissident living in the U.S., amid pressure from Beijing. The account belonged to billionaire Guo Wengui. Meta said it was removed because it violated Facebook&apos;s rules by sharing sensitive information about other people. \"The greatest trick Mark Zuckerberg ever pulled was wrapping the American flag around himself and calling himself a patriot and saying he didn’t offer services in China while he spent the last decade building an $18 billion business there,\" Wynn-Williams said. Her statement argues that \"Meta started briefing the Chinese Communist Party as early as 2015\" and those \"briefings focused on critical emerging technologies, including artificial intelligence.\" \"And he continues to wrap the flag around himself as we move into the next era of artificial intelligence.\" In addition to allegedly trying to cozy up with China, Zuckerberg and other tech executives have tried improve their relationship with President Donald Trump, following his election victory last November. \"This is a man who wears many different costumes,\" Wynn-Williams said of Zuckerberg during her testimony. \"When I was there, he wanted the president of China to name his first child, he was learning Mandarin, he was censoring to his heart&apos;s content.\" She added that Zuckerberg is now focused on accumulating important contacts. \"We don&apos;t know what the next costume is gonna be, but it will be something different,\" she said. \"It&apos;s whatever gets him closest to power.\" GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE Wednesday&apos;s hearing came days before Meta is slated to go on trial for alleged antitrust violations.","summary":"A whistleblower on Wednesday told a Senate committee that Meta repeatedly undermine U.S. national security in an effort to win favor with China.","url":"https://www.foxbusiness.com/politics/whistleblower-tells-senate-committee-meta-undermined-us-national-security-cozy-up-china","image":"https://static.foxbusiness.com/foxbusiness.com/content/uploads/2025/04/sarah-wynn-williams.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-10 00:01:34","author":"Louis Casiano","authors":["Louis Casiano"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.192},{"id":309520644,"title":"Trump admin pulls funding from Maine for allowing men identifying as women to be jailed with females","text":"U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi announced Wednesday that the Trump administration had pulled all nonessential funding from Maine’s Department of Corrections after allowing a 6-foot-1, 245-pound man who identifies as a woman to be housed in prison for women. Bondi spoke to \"Fox and Friends\" host Lawrence Jones about several topics, including President Donald Trump’s authority to determine where federal funding is delivered. \"We can determine where that money goes — all federal money,\" Bondi said before directing the discussion to Maine. \"What's happening there is they're not abiding by what President Trump said. They're allowing men [in] women's sports. \"And in the case right now, what we did last night, some breaking news — we pulled all nonessential funding from the Department of Corrections in Maine because they were allowing a man in a woman's prison, a giant 6-foot-1, 245-pound guy who committed a double murder with a knife, stabbed his parents to death and the family dog, and, he identified as a woman,\" she continued. \"So, they were letting him be housed in a female prison?

Balcer was convicted in 2018 of stabbing both of his parents to death along with the family dog, and sentenced to 40 years in prison for the crime that Balcer blamed on struggles with gender identity. Maine’s prison policy allows inmates to be housed based on their gender identity if they have been diagnosed with gender dysphoria, and officials believe it is in the inmate’s best interest to be classified by the gender they identify with. Balcer was originally listed as male in Department of Corrections documents after the conviction, but state records were updated to list him as a female inmate. IF I WERE A TRANS KID TODAY: HERE'S WHAT POTENTIALLY SAVED MY LIFE Along with allowing a transfer inmate to be held in a prison for women, Maine has refused to comply with Trump's February executive order to ban trans athletes from girls' and women's sports, prompting immense federal pressure. Trump initially vowed to cut federal funding to the state if it refused to comply with the order during a Feb. 20 speech. On Tuesday, 14 state lawmakers in Maine penned a letter to the White House condemning Gov. Janet Mills for her continued support of trans inclusion in girls’ sports. The senators claim that Maine's current policies that enable trans inclusion violate the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA), as well as Title IX. \"Dear Mr. President, As you know, the working people of Maine agree with your commonsense approach to protect women’s sports and spaces. We applaud your administration’s efforts to bring Maine into compliance with not only the protections for women and girls guaranteed under the nation’s landmark Title IX of the Educational Amendments of 1972, but what has also been identified as violations of the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act of 1974,\" the letter read.

The most affected American people are those who can least afford a more expensive alternative because many of these Chinese goods are small daily necessities.\nUS trade data reveals a startling reality: about 85 per cent of the pens and pencils in the United States are made in China. In 2022 alone, Americans bought US$430 million worth of pens from Chinese suppliers. Even leading brands such as Bic and Paper Mate rely on Chinese components.\nThe mountains of paperwork unleashed by the president’s wild economic gamble will become much more expensive after this week, and there is no real alternative in sight. China claims 80 per cent of the global market share of stationery.\nIt is not just the writing instruments. When Trump’s deeply religious faithful go to church to pray for a trade war victory, the Bibles in their hands are most likely to have been printed… again in China!\nAmity Printing Company in Nanjing, China is the world’s largest Bible producer. Since 1987, it has printed over 200 million copies of “the good book”, all for export. About half of these are estimated to be sold to the American market. According to US International Trade Commission data, atheist China accounts for 70 to 80 per cent of America’s religious book imports.\nDespite years of diversification efforts, one-third of the garlic cloves Americans consume, half of the cheap furniture in their homes, and nearly 80 per cent of their Christmas toys are still made in China. Even the wooden frames holding up Trump’s august image decorating every government office are probably Chinese, as China supplies 70 per cent of photo frames in the US.\n\nThe list can go on and on. The fact is that China’s dominance in these easily overlooked, small, but essential daily items is built on economies of scale and production efficiency that American factories – or those of any other country – struggle to match.\nTrump’s tariffs were designed to revive American manufacturing and reduce dependence on China. But in many areas, domestic manufacturers are simply non-existent. It will take years for them to set up production, rebuild the supply and distribution networks, and match China’s scale and effectiveness.\nNo matter how many more times Trump signs off on a new round of duties on Chinese goods, the first result will be pricier pens and paper.\nUS Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent tried to shrug off the carnage in the financial markets after the tariffs announcement by implying that most affected people were wealthy, and that American workers – the president’s key supporters – would only benefit.\n“The top 10 per cent of Americans own 88 per cent of equities, the next 40 per cent own 12 per cent. The bottom 50 per cent have debts. They rent their homes. They have auto loans,” he said in an interview with Tucker Carlson.\nThe reality is that while some rich folks may indeed have been burned in the recent market bloodbaths, most of them will survive and might even be able to recoup their losses later. The tariffs, particularly on China and other Asian countries, are going to affect the 50 per cent of American “have-nots” the most.\nThis is because China’s dominance is particularly pronounced in small but indispensable daily necessities. The “have-yachts” could source their luxury products elsewhere, but the “have-nots” often have no choice but to suck up the tariff costs.\nThere’s poetic justice in the fact that the tools Trump used to wage his trade war – pens, podiums, and promotional materials – were probably made by the very economy he sought to undermine. It’s a reminder that in a globalised world, economic isolationism is easier said than done.\nTariffs may sound tough on paper, but in practice, they often amount to a tax on ordinary Americans. Until the US can either rebuild its manufacturing base or convince consumers to pay premium prices for domestically made staples, China’s grip on everyday goods will remain unshaken, no matter how many tariffs are signed into law.","summary":"Tariffs will end up hitting the US ‘have-nots’ hardest while failing to dethrone China as top producer of everyday goods.","url":"https://www.scmp.com/news/china/diplomacy/article/3305890/why-chinas-grip-american-life-will-stay-unshaken-trump-tariffs-or-not","image":"https://cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2025/04/09/34bcf6b3-b43c-4bd8-af7a-dd1c33af62a1_6c91dd91.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-10 00:00:36","author":"Chow Chung-yan","authors":["Chow Chung-yan"],"language":"en","source_country":"cn","sentiment":-0.126},{"id":309513110,"title":"‘Economically Indefensible’: Trump’s Bad Tariff Math Was Too Stupid To Implement","text":"Donald Trump blinked, and his massive new trade war has been drastically scaled back. Or, maybe not? Perhaps he’s just tweaking the details during a partial 90-day pause, and he preps other, different and more magnificent tariffs. Regardless, the president of the United States will continue to hold the American economy — not to mention the global economy — captive for the foreseeable future, with recurring and very loud threats to execute the hostage.\n\n But for this one fleeting moment, per Trump’s announcement Wednesday afternoon, he’s smashing the “PAUSE” button on his tariff warfare, imposing “substantially lowered” (though still substantial) tariffs of 10 percent for most nations, while escalating an all-out trade war on China. This latest gyration comes less than a week after Trump triumphantly posted a video online that said he was “purposely crashing the stock market,” as a favor to his fellow Americans. His sudden change of approach comes just one week after he publicly launched his tariff blitz, with numbers, math, and tactics that made absolutely no sense to pretty much anyone who looked at it.\n\n For now, it seems as if the president’s economy-nuking bad math was somehow too stupid to implement, even for this uniquely depraved administration.\n\n “I can breathe now… But everything could change tomorrow,” one big Trump and GOP donor says, days after telling Rolling Stone: “I don’t know if I would be this worried about what will happen to the economy if Bernie fucking Sanders were president. That’s how bad this is.” \n\n In fact, mere hours before the president cried “PAUSE,” an array of Trump advisers and close associates were watching through splayed fingers, unsure if catastrophe and collapse were waiting around the next news cycle. \n\n “I am cautiously optimistic about the future. But I’m scared to death right now,” Art Laffer, a well-known Reaganite economist who remains an informal adviser to Trump, said in a phone interview Wednesday morning. “I am a wuss. I really don’t like taking things to the brink,” he said, explaining that Trump was “doing something I never would do, because I’m a chicken, and he’s not. It frightens me, but can I say he’s wrong? I don’t know.”\n\n One reason that conservative bigwigs were so freaked out by Trump’s economic warfare was the bonkers math that took the country to this brink.\n\n The administration’s baffling tariff formula, which was used to determine each nation’s tariff rate and launch Trump’s ill-fated trade war, is still shrouded in surreal mystery. Because nobody, apparently, in Trump’s administration wants to claim credit for devising a formula derided as world-historically nonsensical, even by some of the president’s most ardent supporters.\n\n “I don’t know who came up with that formula — but it doesn’t surprise me that nobody is taking credit for it, if only because it is an economically indefensible formula on the merits,” Stephen Moore, a conservative economics author and Project 2025 contributor who has advised Trump for years, said on Tuesday. “But the president wants a level playing field, so right now he’s waiting for other nations’ leaders to come to him and make the best deal. I’m not a big tariff guy, I think we should be focusing on the Trump tax cuts; but if he can negotiate lower tariffs around the world with this trade war, then that would ultimately be a win.”\n\n Within hours of Trump’s initiation of the trade war last Wednesday, a game of hot-potato erupted within his administration over which senior official was most responsible for the mysterious math. According to White House officials and other Republican sources familiar with the matter, many advisers and aides were left in the dark about who was the principal author of the formula. There was lots of finger-pointing — including at top Trump trade adviser and uber-loyalist Peter Navarro — but fewer concrete answers for public consumption.\n\n “Don’t ask me… Not my department,” a senior White House official said last week, adding that the formula “may not have been the best version.” In the days since, some of Trump’s most prominent economic counselors have publicly performed their own rendition of “don’t ask me,” with Treasury secretary Scott Bessent saying, “I wasn’t involved in the calculations of the numbers,” and Council of Economic Advisers chair Stephen Miran claiming that “the president chose to go with a formula… suggested by someone else in the administration.”\n\n Even during last week’s Rose Garden ceremony where Trump unveiled his plan for sky-high import taxes, broken down by both country and penguin-inhabited sub-Antarctic territory, economists began puzzling over how these tariff rates — as high as 50 percent on tiny, impoverished Lesotho — had been calculated.\n\n According to Trump, these new tariffs were meant to be “reciprocal,” striking back against taxes and unfair trade barriers allegedly already imposed by America’s trading partners. Yet the big new numbers didn’t correspond to any actual tariffs already on the books. So where had the figures come from? \n\n Academics and economics writers, doing back-of-the-envelope calculations, quickly reverse engineered a formula that seemed to crack the code. It was a blunt equation, starting with the trade deficit for each nation and dividing that by the value of that country’s imports of U.S. goods. James Surowiecki, best known for his longtime finance column in the New Yorker, posted this math on X, calling the Trump formula “extraordinary nonsense.”\n\n Au contraire, the White House responded, insisting its calculations were far more complicated. It revealed a formula that had not one, not two, but three Greek letters — in addition to a subscript i for some reason. (The i was a placeholder for the name of the country and not involved in the math.)\n\n This surface-level complexity notwithstanding, the administration’s supposed formula was actually as simple it had seemed to critics. The numerator is exports minus imports — in other words the trade deficit. And while two fancy variables got added to the denominator, the figures the White House plugged in for ε and φ — 4 and ¼ respectively — reduced to 1, and therefore didn’t impact the calculation. Meaning that the bottom half of the equation, indeed, represented a country’s imports of U.S. goods. \n\n The White House approach appeared to seasoned economists like someone added a dollop of grad-school gloss atop some middle-school math, rather than a sophisticated new method to counter international trade imbalance. “It’s definitely the former,” Stan Veuger, a senior fellow at the conservative American Enterprise Institute, tells Rolling Stone. He points to the improbability that the two variables would neatly cancel each other out. “There’s an infinite number of values that the products could take on — and they happen to land on 1?! I mean, come on.”\n\n Given the enormous consequences of the new tariff policy, economists nonetheless interrogated the logic of the variables the White House claimed to use. And here, the academics assert, there was a huge error that led the White House to set tariff rates four times higher than they should be. \n\n In the Trumpy formula, φ supposedly represents how much prices are likely to rise for each dollar tariffs go up. The White House calculates this as a quarter. But the economists whose work is cited by the White House in justifying its math, insist that the real value is nearly one dollar (meaning the resulting tariffs should be about “four times smaller”).\n\n Veuger, the AEI economist, published an analysis arguing that the White House should correct this mistake, and slash its proposed tariff rates. Doing so would lead to a still-high maximum rate of 13.4 percent on countries like Lesotho, while lowering most nations to the minimum tariff set by administration, 10 percent. “They need to use the right numbers,” Veuger says. “The 0.25 in particular, they claim they took it from [an academic] paper, and the number in that paper is just completely different.”\n\n The White House pushed back on AEI Monday, insisting it didn’t need to adjust shit, because the other variable, ε, is itself extremely variable. This figure supposedly represents “the elasticity of imports with respect to import prices” — a measure of how demand is likely to be impacted by rising prices. A White House official told Axios that the figure the White House chose, 4, was “conservative” and could just as easily have been 2, which would have created tariffs “twice as big” as those imposed by Trump.\n\n Veuger found this reaction “quite defensive” and further evidence that Trump’s market-crashing trade offensive was based on economic hokum. “They’re saying that, for the foundation under our trade policy, we’re plugging in numbers that could easily be double! Or half! That’s not a compelling defense of their approach,” he says.\n\n The economist emphasizes that AEI doesn’t take an institutional stance on matters like trade policy. But he shares that “the broad sentiment among my colleagues” has been that the Trump tariff proposal was “not impressive in terms of process — and that the policy itself is just extremely bad.”","summary":"For now, at least…","url":"https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-features/trump-tariff-math-stupid-1235314290/","image":"https://www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/trump-tariff-credit.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-10 00:00:00","author":"Asawin Suebsaeng,Tim Dickinson","authors":["Asawin Suebsaeng","Tim Dickinson"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.259},{"id":309520106,"title":"World News | Trump Targets Anonymous' Author, Former Top Cybersecurity Official in Escalation of Retribution","text":"Washington, Apr 10 (AP) US President Donald Trump intensified his efforts to punish his critics on Wednesday by signing a pair of memoranda directing the Justice Department to investigate two officials from his first administration and stripping them of any security clearances they may have. Trump's targeting of Miles Taylor, a former Department of Homeland Security official in Trump's first term, and Chris Krebs, a former top cybersecurity official, came as the president has sought to use the powers of the presidency to retaliate against his adversaries, including law firms.

Trump also on Wednesday retaliated against another law firm, Susman Godfrey, as he seeks to punish firms that have links to prosecutors who have investigated him or employed attorneys he sees as opponents. Although Trump has ordered security clearances to be stripped from a number of his opponents, including former President Joe Biden and former Vice President Kamala Harris, the president's order Wednesday directing the Justice Department to broadly investigate the actions of Taylor and Krebs marks an escalation of Trump's campaign of retribution since he returned to power.

Taylor, who left the Trump administration in 2019, was later revealed to be the author of an anonymous New York Times op-ed in 2018 that was sharply critical of Trump. The person writing the essay described themselves as part of a secret “resistance” to counter Trump's “misguided impulses,” and its publication touched off a leak investigation in Trump's first White House. Taylor later published a book under the pen name “Anonymous” and publicly revealed his identity days before the 2020 election. Trump said Wednesday that Taylor was “like a traitor” and that his writings about “confidential” meetings were “like spying.” “I think he's guilty of treason,\" he said. Taylor responded by saying Trump had proved his point. “Dissent isn't unlawful. It certainly isn't treasonous. America is headed down a dark path,\" he wrote on X. Trump named Krebs the director of the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency but became angered with him after he declared the 2020 election that Trump lost to be secure and the ballot counts to be accurate. Krebs did not respond to a message seeking comment Wednesday. Trump has falsely claimed he was cheated out of reelection in 2020 by widespread fraud, despite a mountain of evidence to the contrary. Recounts, reviews and audits in the battleground states where he disputed his loss all affirmed Biden's victory. Judges, including some he appointed, rejected dozens of his legal challenges. Susman Godfrey, the firm Trump targeted in an order Wednesday, represented Dominion Voting Systems in a lawsuit that accused Fox News of falsely claiming that the voting company had rigged the 2020 presidential election. Fox News ultimately agreed to pay nearly $800 million to avert a trial. The order bars the firm from using government resources or buildings, according to White House staff secretary Will Scharf. Trump has issued a series of orders meant to punish firms, including by ordering the suspension of lawyers' security clearances and revoking federal contracts. He's succeeded in extracting concessions from some who have settled, but others have challenged the orders in court.

The 70-year-old woman from Winfield has been jailed on $250,000 bond since her arrest over the weekend, with her next court appearance set for next Tuesday. The Associated Press is not identifying her in an effort not to identity her child. Also Read | Tariff War: Donald Trump Pauses Tariffs on Most Nations for 90 Days, Raises Taxes on Chinese Imports to 125%. No attorney is listed for the woman in online court records. The 1,500-person town Winfield is about 45 miles (72.42 km) northwest of downtown St Louis. Lincoln County prosecutor Mike Wood said Wednesday that the woman had been a foster or adoptive parent to around 200 children over a span of well over a decade. His office wrote in seeking a cash-only bond that authorities had received information that some of those children suffered physical and emotional abuse similar to the teen at the centre of the case. Also Read | Trump's Tariff War: Piyush Goyal Asks Exporters Not To Panic; 'India Working Out Right Mix of Trade Agreement With US'. That girl told authorities she was beaten with wooden trim, shoes and a paddle, a detective with the Lincoln County Sheriff's Office wrote in the probable cause statement. The girl said she tried to tell people what was happening but that no one believed her. In February, a deputy who was working as a school resource officer in Missouri was contacted about the girl missing classes, the probable cause statement said. While investigating, the deputy was told of a rumour that the girl was traded for an exotic animal to someone in Texas. The deputy asked authorities in Texas to check on the girl. Child welfare officials in Texas took her into protective custody, and Wood said she is doing well in a group home there. Wood said the suspect and the woman whom the girl was staying with in Texas knew each other because both own exotic animals. He said two witnesses came forward and said they were asked to take the girl to Texas and return with a monkey. He said investigators are trying to firm up if that was just a joke or if it was actually a trade. “There's some smoke there,” Wood said. “We just got to find out if there's fire, and it'll take us some time. But there's at least two witnesses who are coming forward saying that that was the case. As crazy as it sounds, we've had a few human trafficking cases in the past, so we're treating it seriously.” According to the probable cause statement, the girl said the woman she was staying with in Texas worked out of town and left her for days at a time to take care of exotic animals. The girl said she wasn't subjected to forced labour or sexual abuse. The woman told a detective she was friends with the girl's adoptive mother and took her in to give the pair a break from each other. The girl stayed there for over a month, Wood said. When authorities interviewed the woman, she said she no longer wanted the girl there, but the girl's mother wouldn't make arrangements to bring her home, the probable cause statement said. Charging documents describe the girl's living conditions there as unsanitary and said she was inadequately supervised. The prosecutor's office said in a Facebook post that more charges were expected. Wood said in an interview that his office has learned that there were around 250 calls to a child abuse hotline about the adoptive mother's home over the course of about 15 years. Yet Wood said there were no criminal reports about the home. He also noted that the girl stayed in the home, even after the Missouri Department of Social Services Children's Division received a tip in November that she was being abused. “On its face, it just seems like there was a systemic failure somewhere, and we're looking into it to see if that is the case, how it can be addressed, and to the extent that there's any criminal behaviour associated with it, we will look into that as well,” Wood said. Baylee Watts, a spokesperson for the Missouri Department of Social Services, provided no information about the case, writing in an email that “information related to specific child abuse and neglect investigations is closed and confidential under Missouri law, except under very limited circumstances.” Her email ended by urging people to call the agency's hotline.

Speaker Mike Johnson almost dared the Republican hardliners to defy Trump and risk upending what the president calls the “big, beautiful bill\", which is central to his agenda of tax cuts, mass deportations and a smaller federal government. The GOP speaker cannot afford many defections from his slim majority, when faced with unified Democratic opposition. Also Read | Tariff War: Donald Trump Pauses Tariffs on Most Nations for 90 Days, Raises Taxes on Chinese Imports to 125%. “Stop grandstanding!” Trump had admonished Republicans during a black-tie fundraising dinner at the National Building Museum Tuesday night. Trump told them, “Close your eyes and get there.\" Also Read | Trump's Tariff War: Piyush Goyal Asks Exporters Not To Panic; 'India Working Out Right Mix of Trade Agreement With US'. But by Wednesday afternoon, the conservative Republicans stood firmly against the plan, throwing the schedule in flux. Several of them met privately with Senate GOP leaders to insist on deeper cuts. Johnson later pulled a group of Republicans into a private meeting room off the House chamber. “The intention is to have the vote by this evening, and we'll see when that time is,” Johnson told reporters at the Capitol. “Very positive, productive discussions. Everybody is moving forward.\" Pushing the budget framework forward would be a milestone for Johnson, who had set a deadline of the congressional spring break recess Thursday for advancing the resolution. But a failed vote, particularly as the economy is convulsing over Trump's trade wars, would prove a major setback for the embattled speaker and the Republican agenda in Washington. It's coming as Trump's tariff onslaught has left lawmakers on edge. Hours before the House was ready to vote, Trump paused much of his ambitious tariffs scheme, giving financial markets a bounce after days of turmoil and warnings of a US recession. “We are at a critical inflection point, with a generational opportunity,” said Rep Jodey Arrington, the chair of the House Budget Committee, at a rules meeting ahead of voting. But House GOP conservatives, including several of those who met personally with Trump at the White House this week, remain concerned that the Senate GOP's blueprint, approved last weekend, does not slash spending to the level they believe is necessary to help prevent soaring deficits. “The Math Does Not Add Up,” Rep Chip Roy posted on social media. He said he would not support it. In an unusual move, Rep Andy Harris, the chair of the ultraconservative Freedom Caucus, and others walked across the Capitol to met with Senate Majority Leader John Thune and other Senate GOP leaders. Sen John Barrasso, the GOP whip, exited a short time later calling it a very positive meeting. \"The House and the Senate Republicans are all on the same page, and we're all committed to serious and significant savings for the American taxpayers,” Barrasso said. Wednesday's vote would be another step in a weeks, if not months, long process. The House and Senate must resolve their differences with more votes ahead on the final product later this spring or summer. Democrats, in the minority, do not have enough votes to stop the package, but have warned against it. Pennsylvania Rep Brendan Boyle, the ranking Democrat on the budget committee, said whether the House or Senate version, the proposed GOP budget cuts would deeply harm Medicaid, the health care programme used by tens of millions of Americans. “This will have a devastating impact on my district, my state — and all 435 congressional districts throughout our land,” Boyle said. House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries of New York said the Republicans' budget plan is reckless and callous as it proposes slashing budgets to give tax breaks to the wealthy. “We're here to make it clear,” Jeffries said. “Hands off everyday Americans struggling to make ends meet.” The budget framework starts the process of the Republican effort to preserve the tax breaks approved in 2017, during Trump's first term, while potentially adding the new ones he promised on the campaign trail. That includes no taxes on tipped wages, Social Security income and others, ballooning the price tag to some $7 trillion over the decade. The package also allows for budget increases with some $175 billion to pay for Trump's mass deportation operation and as much for the Defence Department to bolster military spending. It all would be partly paid for with steep cuts to domestic programmes, including health care, as part of the $2 trillion in reductions outlined in the House GOP version of the package, though several GOP senators have signaled they are not willing to go that far. To clip costs, the Senate is using an unusual accounting method that does not count the costs of preserving the 2017 tax cuts, some $4.5 trillion, as new spending, another factor that is enraging the House conservatives. Two Republican senators voted against their package during an overnight weekend session — Maine Sen Susan Collins objected to steep cuts to Medicaid in the House's framework, while Kentucky Sen Rand Paul argued the whole package relied on “fishy” math that would add to the debt. The package would also boost the nation's debt limit to allow more borrowing to pay the bills. Trump had wanted lawmakers to take the politically difficult issue off the table. With debt now at $36 trillion, the Treasury Department has said it will run out of funds by August. But the House and Senate need to resolve their differences on the debt limit, as well. The House GOP raises the debt limit by $4 trillion, but the Senate GOP boosted it to $5 trillion so the Congress would not have to revisit the issue again until after the fall 2026 midterm election. With Trump's trade wars hovering over the debate, House Republicans tucked a provision into a procedural vote that would prevent House action – as the Senate has taken – to disapprove of Trump's tariffs.

The S&P 500 surged 5.6%, while the Nasdaq has jumped over 8%. Trump’s Truth Social statement suggests he has backed down on tariffs on most countries for 90 days, applying instead a 10% tariff.\n\nHowever, Trump’s pause does not apply to China, which has announced new tariffs of 84% on imports of all US goods, up from the 34% previously announced, hours after US tariffs on Chinese products went up to a staggering 104%. China’s retaliation sent stock markets falling further with major indices down in the UK, Germany, France and Spain.\n\nChina’s 84% tariffs on US imports will come into effect at 12.01pm on Thursday, according to Chinese state news agency, Xinhua.\n\nThe two countries have traded tit-for-tat tariff hikes repeatedly over the past week. “I want to emphasize that there is no winner in a trade war, and that China does not want a trade war. But the Chinese government will by no means sit by when the legitimate rights and interests of its people are being hurt and deprived,” an official of China’s ministry of commerce said in a statement on Wednesday.\n\nAddressing reporters at the White House on Wednesday, treasury secretary Scott Bessent said the latest changes in Donald Trump’s tariffs policy was Trump’s “strategy all along.” He said: “This was his strategy all along, and that you might even say that he goaded China into a bad position, they responded.”\n\nThe WTO chief said the US-China tariff war could reduce trade in goods between the two economic giants by 80%, pulling down the rest of the world economy. Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala said that the US-China tariff war could reduce trade in goods between the two countries by 80%.\n\nThe EU announced 25% tariffs on a range of US imports in a first round of countermeasures. The 27-member bloc has agreed to impose retaliatory tariffs on €21bn (£18bn) of US goods, targeting farm produce and products from Republican states. All member states voted for the retaliation, with the exception of Hungary.\n\nTrump’s 90-day pause on tariffs may not exempt the 25% tariff on cars, Ireland’s deputy prime minister has revealed, after a face-to-face meeting with US commerce secretary Howard Lutnick. Simon Harris, the first EU politician to meet anyone in Trump’s administration since the tariffs were announced last Wednesday, said he spoke to the European trade minister Maroš Šefčovič immediately after his bilateral meeting in Washington today.\n\nTrump has in particular targeted the pharmaceutical industry, saying: “We’re going to put tariffs on the pharmaceutical companies, and they’re going to all want to come back.” It’s an idea he has raised before.\n\nUS markets recovered later on Wednesday after Bessent indicated America was open to trade agreements with allies and a subsequent group deal with China. In his first comments since China’s 84% tariff announcement, Trump urged Americans to “be cool”. The US president bragged about countries “kissing my ass” to negotiate tariffs during a Tuesday-night dinner.","summary":"China’s 84% retaliatory tariffs on US goods, announced on Wednesday, are due to come into effect on Thursday\n\nRead the latest full report\n\nHello, and thanks for following our live coverage of what has been a tumultuous week on global markets, triggered by US President Trump’s shock tariff policy.\n\nThe upheaval erased trillions of dollars from stock markets and led to an unsettling surge in US government bond yields that appeared to catch the president’s attention.\n\nGlobal markets surged after Trump announced his 90-day tariff pause.

Oracle has been in talks with the White House to oversee American users’ data and keep it separate from Beijing, according to Politico, while Microsoft has been named by Trump as a company interested in TikTok. Amazon recently made an offer letter to White House officials including Vice President JD Vance, The New York Times reported.\n\nKey Background\n\nTrump first announced a sweeping round of tariffs against some 180 countries last week, sending markets reeling for several days before he followed up with a pause on the tariffs for countries willing to negotiate new trade deals with the U.S. While the tariffs have sent stocks into a volatile frenzy and stoked fears of a recession, the impact of the levies has seemingly reached TikTok negotiations. The law forcing TikTok’s ban or sale was signed by former President Joe Biden after bipartisan national security concerns were raised over the app. The app briefly went dark in the U.S. in January before Trump took office and signed an extension on the law against it, keeping it operational in the U.S. until April. Vance said ahead of the deadline “there will almost certainly be a high-level agreement” that stopped TikTok from being banned. The Trump administration sought to secure a TikTok deal with China by last Friday’s deadline before it announced another extension for the platform’s potential sale or ban, giving the White House more time to sort out a deal for the platform until June. The dealmaking process was progressing when ByteDance told the White House that the Chinese government bailed from the deal after Trump announced tariffs against Beijing, according to multiple outlets. By Sunday, Trump told reporters a deal was close to being made, “and then China changed the deal because of tariffs.”\n\nFurther Reading\n\nTikTok Ban: Trump Extending Deadline By 75 Days (Forbes)\n\nBattle For TikTok: Amazon, AppLovin Join Oracle And These Others Vying To Buy It (Forbes)\n\nFollow me on Twitter or LinkedIn.

But Mr Trump stepped up his trade war with Beijing, saying tariffs on Chinese goods would soar to 125 per cent after China responded with its own retaliatory tariffs.\n\nCritics said last night that Mr Trump 'blinked first' just 24 hours after the White House said he had 'a spine of steel that he will not break'.\n\nHe acknowledged that market turmoil had played a part in his decision to back down, telling reporters: 'People were getting a little bit yippy, a little bit out of line.'\n\nHe insisted all countries, including China, would eventually agree 'fair' trade deals and put the US on a 'transition to greatness', but warned: 'Nothing's over yet.'\n\nIn the US, the Dow Jones index leapt by 6 per cent within minutes.\n\nThe climbdown came after bond-market investors began an unprecedented sell-off of US government debt, driving up borrowing rates for the Trump administration.\n\nBritain was also hit by the fallout, with the UK Government's borrowing costs hitting their highest since 1998, raising the prospect of more tax rises and spending cuts.\n\nAfter claiming that world leaders were 'calling me up, kissing my ass...', Mr Trump later urged American voters to 'be cool', saying: 'Everything is going to work out well.'\n\nBut four hours later he ordered the tariff pause and sent US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent to defend it at a White House press conference.\n\nMr Bessent claimed Mr Trump only ever intended to use the threat of tariffs against the rest of the world to generate 'maximum negotiating leverage'. But he said China had revealed itself as the 'bad actor' in global trade by retaliating.\n\nPress secretary Karoline Leavitt also made out that the past week of turmoil, which wiped trillions of dollars off the markets, was part of the plan, telling reporters: 'Many of you in the media clearly missed the art of the deal. You clearly failed to see what President Trump is doing here.'\n\nLast night, Mr Trump said there was 'a lot of winning out there', 'we're having a good day in the stock market' and the US was 'stronger than it's ever been'. He added: 'We had to take the medicine... to go through the operation.'\n\nHis tariffs briefly came into full effect yesterday, exactly one week after his 'Liberation Day' announcement stunned global markets. China was hit with an additional 50 per cent levy after retaliating, taking the total US tariff on Chinese goods to 104 per cent.\n\nChina, which has vowed to 'fight to the end', responded with an extra 50 per cent levy on US imports, taking its own total tariff rate to 84 per cent. Beijing described Mr Trump's approach as 'a mistake on top of a mistake'.\n\nHedge fund billionaire Bill Ackman, who first floated the idea of a 90-day pause, warned publicly yesterday that the US economy would be punished if the President failed to intervene, adding: 'Our stock market is down. Bond yields are up and the dollar is declining. These are not the markers of successful policy.'\n\nThe policy switch still leaves the world's two biggest economies locked in a deepening trade war. \n\nMr Trump said he was raising tariffs on Chinese goods to 125 per cent immediately thanks to Beijing's 'lack of respect'. \n\nMr Bessent said Beijing's policy of 'escalating' the trade dispute would backfire. 'They sell us almost five times as much as we sell them so I think it's an own goal by China,' he said.\n\nHe said talks would begin with more than 75 countries that want better trade terms.\n\nMr Trump's decision means heavier 'reciprocal' tariffs will be temporarily cut to 10 per cent. This will benefit the EU, which faced a 20 per cent rate, as well as countries such as India (26 per cent) and Vietnam (46 per cent).\n\nIt will make no difference to the UK, which was already on the 10 per cent baseline.\n\nHigher 25 per cent tariffs also remain in place on cars and on steel and aluminium.\n\nFormer Cabinet minister Kit Malthouse said any imposition of tariffs on pharmaceuticals would backfire on the US. \n\nThe chairman of the all-party group on life sciences added: 'As a life sciences superpower, the UK is able to offer Americans hope in the fight against awful ailments. Why on earth would you tax these scientific miracles at your own border?'\n\nDowning Street said: 'A trade war is in nobody's interests.

Contributing editor Zoë Bernard also touched on how she believes Musk's previous liberal views may be what drives him away from Trump.\n\nAfter Trump announced his tariffs hike, including a baseline of 10 percent for imported goods from all countries, as well as “individualized” tariffs as high as 50% on a series of specific countries and regions, Musk saw his net worth cut down by $30.9billion.\n\n “It’s only a matter of time before the bromance between Trump and Elon goes south, and it does seem like there are some cracks showing in his relationship with the Trump administration as recently as the last few days,\" Jones said on the podcast.Bernard added: “It’s hard for me to imagine that any of these billionaires that supported Trump are happy right now. Elon Musk included, but I think I don’t know what he will do politically, given that he’s put all of his chips in the Trump corner at this point. So, I mean, he can’t go back to the liberal side.”\n\nBefore landing in Trump's corner and becoming part of the MAGA crowd, Musk was more liberal, with a shift happening around 2020, when entrepreneurs in California were “knocking up against more and more regulation,” according to Bernard. \n\nShe said: “I think it was a convergence of, you know, hating the media and seeing institutions like the media as this arm of liberalism and the Democratic Party, and then also bumping up against these regulations that made it increasingly difficult for him to innovate with Tesla.”After California health officials temporarily shut down Tesla factories, the billionaire fumed and made an appearance on Joe Rogan's podcast, where he rambled about “anti-globalization and anti-globalists.\" \n\n“Those are all very (right-wing) terms now, and I feel like that interview was a seed,” Howorth suggested. However, Musk appeared to be pushed ever closer to Trump in 2021, when then-president Joe Biden snubbed Tesla from electric vehicle summit.\n\nCalderon claimed the 53-year-old “thought Tesla should be there and apparently they were not.”While Musk is now seemingly an extension of Trump that may not remain the case, as aside the tariff increase, the 78-year-old put restrictions on the businessman during a meeting, hinted at his exit from the Department of Government Efficiency, and is already sick of him according to a body language expert.\n\nMusk's own brother Kimbal even called out Trump and his tariffs, calling them a \"permanent tax on the American consumer.\"\n\nAs for Musk, it is believed his legacy has now taken a dark turn amid his love for Trump.Howorth explained: “It’s actually kind of sad, because his legacy could have been that of a climate change evangelist who made a beautiful, efficient, and relatively affordable vehicle and helped astronauts explore space and expanded medical understanding of the brain. \n\n\"And now he’s gonna go down as a chainsawing maniac.”\n\nMusk's fanbase also seems to be slowly turning on him, after he called Trump's top advisor Peter Navarro a \"moron\" after the 75-year-old labeled Tesla a \"car assembler\" and not a “car manufacturer.\"","summary":"Elon Musk and Donald Trump's friendship may not last much longer as there appears to be cracks showing according to critics.","url":"https://radaronline.com/p/elon-musk-donald-trump-friendship-over-cracks-billionaire-legacy-downfall/","image":"https://media.radaronline.com/brand-img/PctHg935M/0x0/trump-musk-1744234303376.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-09 23:45:00","author":"Bryan Brunati","authors":["Bryan Brunati"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.21},{"id":309516272,"title":"Poilievre Pledges Tougher Penalties for Repeat Serious Offenders, Carney Says He’ll Make Canada an ‘Energy Superpower’","text":"Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre vowed to pass legislation to crack down on repeat offenders while Liberal Leader Mark Carney promised to make Canada an energy superpower, as the electoral campaign hit day 18.\n\nDuring an April 9 stop in Sault Ste. Marie, Ont., Poilievre said a Conservative government would enact a “three-strikes-and-you’re-out” law that would prevent individuals convicted of three serious offences from getting bail, probation, parole, or house arrest.\n\nHe would also ensure three-time serious offenders get a minimum jail sentence of 10 years and up to a life sentence.\n\n“Once-safe streets have become scenes of chaos and disorder,” he said. “For too many Canadians, the threat of crime is now an everyday fact of life. It wasn’t like this before.”\n\nRe-offending criminals would be designated as dangerous offenders and only released after serving a lengthy sentence and exemplary behaviour, clean drug tests, and demonstrating an interest in improving themselves by learning a trade or upgrading their education.\n\nPoilievre attributed the increase to Bills C-5 and C-75, introduced by the Liberal government. Bill C-5 removed mandatory minimum sentences for offences like robbery and extortion with a firearm and was presented as an “anti-racism” measure to reduce the proportion of indigenous and black people in prison.\n\nBill C-75 instructs judges to consider releasing accused as quickly as possible and under the least onerous conditions. It also has a component saying individuals “overrepresented in the criminal justice system” should receive particular attention.\n\nPoilievre said new legislation will be compliant with the charter and that released criminals are threatening the charter rights of other Canadians.\n\nLiberal Leader Mark Carney, campaigning in Calgary on April 9, commented on Poilievre’s plan, saying he does not like the “baseball rule of three strikes and you’re out for a period of time.”\n\nHe said Canada has been relying too much on the United States, and with President Donald Trump now “rupturing the global economy,” Canada must now “realize its full potential.”\n\nThe Liberal leader said his plan to boost Canada’s conventional and clean energy sector involves using Canadian energy to displace imported energy, diversify trade, and increase competitiveness.\n\n“To build the strongest economy in the G7, we need to develop both clean energy and the lowest carbon conventional energy,” he said.\n\nHe would increase the clean energy supply chain through critical mineral exploration and extraction and speed up the approval of clean energy projects that are of national interest.\n\nThe Liberals said they will develop energy projects while reducing emissions as part of climate change policies.\n\n“We will work with the oil and gas sector to reduce their emissions in a cost effective and efficient manner; we cannot lose sight of our obligation to address climate change while ensuring the long-term competitiveness of Canada’s energy sector,” the party said in a news release.\n\nCarney was asked by reporters whether he would commit to build new oil and gas pipelines. He said he reached agreement with Alberta Premier Danielle Smith and the other premiers during his first week as prime minister to “build energy corridors that run to the national interest, to fast track those, to make that tangible.”\n\nPoilievre has questioned Carney’s willingness to build oil and gas infrastructure given his advocacy for net-zero policies and for not wanting to repeal Bill C-69, the 2019 law requiring impact assessments for resource or infrastructure projects. Poilievre calls it the “no new pipelines act.”\n\n“We‘ll repeal the Liberal ’no new development laws’ to unleash the strength of our economy and stand up to the Americans from a position of might,” Poilievre said on April 9.","summary":"Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre vowed to pass legislation to crack down on repeat offenders while Liberal Leader Mark Carney promised to make Canada an energy superpower, as the electoral campaign hit day 18.
