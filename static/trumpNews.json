The legislation now moves to President Donald Trump, who has said he will sign it “immediately.”The broad spending bill funds 11 of the 12 annual appropriations bills through September 30, ensuring most federal agencies continue operating for the full fiscal year.The only exception is the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), which is funded on a temporary basis through February 13 to allow further negotiations on immigration enforcement policies.Temporary DHS funding to allow negotiationThe DHS funding provision was separated from the larger package amid intense debate over immigration enforcement reforms. House lawmakers agreed to a two-week extension for DHS funding, setting up a frantic 10-day window for Congress to negotiate a broader agreement on DHS and immigration policy before the new February 13 deadline.The limited extension reflects a compromise reached after Democrats refused to support full-year DHS funding without changes to policies governing Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and Customs and Border Protection (CBP), particularly following widespread criticism of federal immigration enforcement after two US citizens were fatally shot by federal agents in Minneapolis.","url":"https://www.livemint.com/news/us-news/us-house-votes-217-214-to-end-brief-government-shutdown-clears-bill-for-trump-to-sign-dhs-funding-talks-continue-11770146162506.html","image":"https://www.livemint.com/lm-img/img/2026/02/03/1600x900/logo/HOUSE-LAWMAKERS-TAKE-UP-SPENDING-PACKAGE-PASSED_1770146749807_1770146749937.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-02-04 19:26:49","author":"Ravi Hari","authors":["Ravi Hari"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"in","sentiment":-0.185},{"id":399057778,"title":"US says its jet shot down Iranian drone near aircraft carrier USS Abraham Lincoln in Arabian sea","text":"A US stealth warplane shot down an Iranian drone that \"aggressively\" approached an American aircraft carrier as it sailed in the Arabian Sea on Tuesday, a US military spokesman said.The incident occurred with the carrier about 500 miles (800 kilometers) from Iran's coast, and came on the same day that American forces responded to Iranian boats that threatened to board a US-flagged tanker in the Strait of Hormuz.\"An F-35C fighter jet from Abraham Lincoln shot down the Iranian drone in self-defense and to protect the aircraft carrier and personnel on board,\" US Central Command spokesman Captain Tim Hawkins said in a statement.The shootdown took place after the Shahed-139 drone \"continued to fly toward the ship despite de-escalatory measures taken by US forces,\" Hawkins said.He also confirmed a separate incident that occurred later Tuesday in which two Iranian boats and a drone approached the US-flagged ship M/V Stena Imperative \"at high speeds and threatened to board and seize the tanker.\"An American destroyer -- the USS McFaul -- responded with support from the US Air Force and escorted the tanker, which is now \"proceeding safely,\" Hawkins added.US President Donald Trump has threatened military action against Iran and sent a flotilla of warships to the Middle East following anti-government protests in Iran that were met with a deadly crackdown last month.Trump has said he is hopeful Washington will \"work something out\" with Tehran, but also warned that \"bad things would happen\" if a deal was not reached, while Iran insists it wants diplomacy while promising a decisive response to any aggression.","url":"https://www.livemint.com/news/us-news/us-says-its-jet-shot-down-iranian-drone-near-aircraft-carrier-uss-abraham-lincoln-in-arabian-sea-11770143300671.html","image":"https://www.livemint.com/lm-img/img/2026/02/03/1600x900/logo/US-IRAN-PROTEST-POLITICS-DEFENCE-1_1770143634778_1770143645468.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-02-04 18:37:45","author":"Livemint","authors":["Livemint"],"language":"en","source_country":"in","sentiment":-0.396},{"id":399057784,"title":"Disney taps parks head Josh DAmaro as CEO to lead post-Iger era","text":"D'Amaro's division generated $10 billion in operating profit last fiscal year*CEO contender Walden named content chief and president*Competition is deepening as Netflix and Paramount eye Warner Bros assets*D'Amaro's unfamiliarity with Hollywood could be a challenge - analysts(Adds comment from former Disney CEO Michael Eisner in paragraphs 26-27)By Aditya SoniFeb 3 (Reuters) - Walt Disney on Tuesday named theme parks head Josh D'Amaro as CEO, ending years of succession uncertainty and placing a longtime insider at the helm as artificial intelligence and a wave of consolidation upend the media industry.D'Amaro, 54, will take the reins from Bob Iger, 74, at the company's annual investor meeting on March 18. Iger, credited with shaping the modern Disney through deals for Pixar, Marvel and 21st Century Fox, will stay on as a senior adviser and board member until his retirement from the company on December 31.Disney also named entertainment co-chief Dana Walden, a creative executive in the mold of Iger with a string of commercial and critical hits and strong talent ties, as chief content officer and president.Walden was among the internal candidates for the CEO role along with entertainment co-chief Alan Bergman and ESPN head Jimmy Pitaro.Succession has long been the storied entertainment giant's weakness - it delayed Iger's retirement several times and brought him back in 2022 to replace his handpicked successor, Bob Chapek, after the pandemic hobbled its business. To avoid another misstep, Disney in 2024 named Morgan Stanley veteran James Gorman as its chairman to oversee the CEO search. Gorman, who led a smooth transition at the Wall Street bank, joined after the House of Mouse extended Iger's tenure for a fifth time through 2026. The search committee evaluated 100 external candidates in addition to internal contenders.Gorman said the committee considered the candidates' vision for the company, their understanding of the Disney brand, their creative chops, and their embrace of technological innovation - particularly artificial intelligence.\"There's so much that he's done creatively, and storytelling, and such a deep understanding of the brand and where the industry is going,\" said Gorman. \"I thought it was a fabulous choice.\"With D'Amaro, Disney is turning to a nearly three-decade company veteran who runs its biggest profit engine - the experiences unit that includes theme parks and cruises and whose sales have grown every year after the pandemic receded in 2021.Last fiscal year, the division turned a record operating profit of nearly $10 billion, making up nearly 60% of the company's earnings.Disney shares were down 0.7% on Tuesday.D'Amaro is leading the company's push into the Middle East with a theme park in the United Arab Emirates' capital, Abu Dhabi, that would mark its first major new park in nearly a decade.CHALLENGES FACING NEW CEO But a decline in international visitors to the U.S. is weighing on the parks business, with Disney shares falling more than 7% on Monday after the company flagged the \"headwind\" even as its overall sales and profit exceeded expectations.While D'Amaro is a familiar face for visitors to Walt Disney World in Florida, analysts have said he is little known in Hollywood. That could pose a challenge as he confronts an entertainment industry that generative AI tools threaten to reshape by automating writing, editing and visual effects. The timing is particularly high-stakes as the announcement comes just months before the industry's major guild contracts - including those for writers and actors - expire in May and June, setting the stage for a new round of labor negotiations. A breakdown in talks, partially over the use of AI, had led to dual strikes in 2023 by the unions that hobbled much of Hollywood production and cost around $6 billion in lost output. Disney is especially under scrutiny after it agreed late last year to let OpenAI use characters from its Star Wars, Pixar and Marvel franchises in the startup's Sora AI video generator. It has also agreed to invest $1 billion in the startup.Chapek, another parks veteran turned CEO, had struggled with talent relations and bungled a dispute with Scarlett Johansson over the simultaneous streaming and theatrical release of \"Black Widow,\" which resulted in a lawsuit and eventual settlement.\"These are big boots to fill. Disney can ill afford another messy handover,\" PP Foresight analyst Paolo Pescatore said.\"Ultimately, the key to Disney's success and future growth lies in content creation, which drives the flywheel across theatrical releases, experiences, licensing and streaming.\" Competition is also heating up as Netflix and Paramount try to bulk up by buying Warner Bros assets, with either combination expected to result in a major streaming and studio rival.D'Amaro will also have to navigate political pressure from the Trump administration. In September, the company pulled \"Jimmy Kimmel Live\" after the host's remarks about the assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk drew a threat from the communications regulator. It quickly reinstated the late-night show following backlash over the decision. President Donald Trump said in November that licenses used by affiliates of Disney-owned ABC should be \"taken away\" after a reporter for the network questioned him about the Jeffrey Epstein scandal.Disney has set D'Amaro's annual base salary at $2.5 million, and he will receive a long-term incentive award with a target value of $26.3 million each fiscal year.Former Disney CEO Michael Eisner lauded the choice of Iger's successor, and the decision to elevate Walden, in a post on the social media platform X.\"My advice to Josh is continue Bob Iger’s strategy that creativity will handle profits, always protect the brand,\" wrote Eisner. \"And keep close the words of Walt Disney: 'We love to entertain kings and queens, but the vital thing to remember is this—every guest receives the VIP treatment.'\"(Reporting by Aditya Soni in Bengaluru; additional reporting by Harshita Varghese and Dawn Chmielewski; Editing by Arun Koyyur, Anil D'Silva, Chris Reese and Nick Zieminski)","url":"https://www.livemint.com/companies/disney-taps-parks-head-josh-damaro-as-ceo-to-lead-post-iger-era-11770143550272.html","image":"https://www.livemint.com/lm-img/img/2024/12/06/1600x900/logo/company_4_1733465206851_1733465215415.png","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-02-04 18:32:29","author":"List.metadata.agency","authors":["List.metadata.agency"],"language":"en","source_country":"in","sentiment":0.465},{"id":399134410,"title":"Deportation raids drive Minneapolis immigrant family into hiding","text":"Latest News\n\nInternational News\n\nNorth & East\n\nEnvironment\n\nSocial Love\n\nHorse Racing\n\nWorld Champs\n\nCommonwealth Games\n\nFIFA World Cup 2022\n\nEntertainment\n\nArt & Culture\n\nTuesday Style\n\nFood Awards\n\nJOL Takes Style Out\n\nDesign Week JA\n\nBlack Friday\n\nRelationships\n\nClassifieds\n\nMotor Vehicles\n\nPlace an Ad\n\nJobs & Careers\n\nStudy Centre\n\nJnr Study Centre\n\nAdvertorial\n\nSupplements\n\n\n\nLatest News\n\nInternational News\n\nNorth & East\n\nEnvironment\n\nSocial Love\n\nHorse Racing\n\nWorld Champs\n\nCommonwealth Games\n\nFIFA World Cup 2022\n\nEntertainment\n\nArt & Culture\n\nTuesday Style\n\nFood Awards\n\nJOL Takes Style Out\n\nDesign Week JA\n\nBlack Friday\n\nRelationships\n\nClassifieds\n\nMotor Vehicles\n\nPlace an Ad\n\nJobs & Careers\n\nStudy Centre\n\nJnr Study Centre\n\nAdvertorial\n\nSupplements\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInternational News\n\nFood Awards\n\nEntertainment\n\nWorld Champs\n\nCareer & Education\n\nEnvironment\n\nAdvertorial\n\nSupplements\n\nClassifieds\n\nDesign Week\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAna (L), a Mexican resident of Minneapolis, is pictured holding hands with a friend inside her home on January 31, 2026, as federal immigration raids continue in the city.

Luis stays shut in with her because he was born in Mexico. The other three are native-born Americans, but she’s worried sick every time they leave the house.\n\n“I’m always afraid that even though they’re citizens, they won’t be respected and that they could be taken away just because of the color of their skin,” she said, trembling.\n\nThe children know to text before they come home, or else the door won’t open when they knock.\n\nAt 15, Luis longs to come and go as his brothers and sister do and dreams of walking to the fast-food spot “right down the street — when things get better.”\n\n“Right now it’s literally so close, but so far.”\n\n– ‘Trump swindled us’ –\n\nOnce his online classes are over, Luis zones out playing a first-person shooter game called “Half Life,” often for five hours a day.\n\n“It’s the only thing that makes me forget what’s going on,” he murmured.\n\nHis father Carlos seethes at their current ordeal.\n\nHe works installing granite countertops, and has paid nearly $11,000 in legal fees for his family’s visa applications, but the process has dragged on for nearly three years.\n\nHe and Ana both have work permits. But the armed, masked agents the Trump administration has deployed into this city don’t care about that document, which no longer protects against arrest or deportation.\n\n“They give you a work permit, but it doesn’t allow you to stay in this country legally. How is that possible?” Carlos asked.\n\n“When we realized Trump had removed the protection (of the work permit) against deportation, we felt as if he swindled us,” the 43-year-old added.\n\n“I don’t think we deserve this. We haven’t done anything wrong. We are not criminals.”\n\nThere are widespread fears of mistreatment amid the militarized raids favored by the two federal agencies carrying out Trump’s hardline policies, Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and Customs and Border Protection (CBP).\n\nIn major Democratic strongholds of Minneapolis, Los Angeles and Chicago, teams of masked agents have stepped up street sweeps, targeting working people at bus stops and hardware stores.\n\nCarlos said things were different during Trump’s first term, and he didn’t feel the need to lock himself in because operations were more targeted.\n\n– ‘Metro Surge’ –\n\nTwo men Carlos knew were deported during Trump’s first term.\n\n“One was involved in drug trafficking, the other beat his wife,” he said.\n\nAs “Operation Metro Surge” continues in Minneapolis, questions swirl around how many innocent people are swept up in raids.\n\nIn Los Angeles, during a surge in operations last summer, statistics showed that more than half of the immigrants detained in sweeps had no criminal record.\n\nBetween Carlos’s work and odd jobs Ana takes as a cook or cashier, the couple typically bring in $6,000 a month.\n\nBut since December, they’ve had no income.\n\nTo pay their $2,200 rent in January, they borrowed $1,500 from a friend.\n\nThey don’t know how they’ll manage this month, but they’re praying that the federal agents hunting immigrants in Minnesota get sent elsewhere in the country.\n\nDoubt creeps in.\n\n“What if it never stops?” Carlos asked. “The president has three years to go, three years is a long time.”\n\nAna admitted she sometimes imagines herself back in Mexico, but “the only thing keeping me here are my children’s dreams.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTags: deportation raid ICE Minneapolis \n\n\n\n\n\n\n {\"jamaica-observer\":\"Jamaica Observer\"} \n\n\n\n\n\n0 Comments · Make a comment\n\n\n\n\n ALSO ON JAMAICA OBSERVER\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLatest News, News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Curfew imposed in Norwood following double murder \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFebruary 3, 2026 \n\n\n ST JAMES, Jamaica — The St James police have imposed a curfew in a section of Norwood, St James, following a double murder in the community, which has... \n\n\n\n\n {\"jamaica-observer\":\"Jamaica Observer\"} \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInternational News, Latest News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Thousands of Venezuelans march to demand Maduro’s release \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFebruary 3, 2026 \n\n\n CARACAS, Venezuela (AFP)-Thousands of backers of Venezuela's former leader Nicolas Maduro, who was ousted in a deadly US military operation, marched i... \n\n\n\n\n {\"jamaica-observer\":\"Jamaica Observer\"} \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLatest News, News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n After Hurricane Melissa, HR leaders take centrestage in recovery push \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFebruary 3, 2026 \n\n\n As Jamaica continues to recover from Hurricane Melissa, human resource leaders are being called to play a more visible and decisive role in national r... \n\n\n\n\n {\"jamaica-observer\":\"Jamaica Observer\"} \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInternational News, Latest News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Arsenal sink Chelsea to reach League Cup final \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFebruary 3, 2026 \n\n\n LONDON, United Kingdom (AFP)-Arsenal reached the League Cup final for the first time in eight years as Kai Havertz sealed a 1-0 win against Chelsea in... \n\n\n\n\n {\"jamaica-observer\":\"Jamaica Observer\"} \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLatest News, News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n JPS transformers earmarked for restoration effort in Westmoreland destroyed by vandals \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFebruary 3, 2026 \n\n\n WESTMORELAND, Jamaica—The Jamaica Public Service (JPS) says several of its transformers that were scheduled for installation to support electricity re... \n\n\n\n\n {\"jamaica-observer\":\"Jamaica Observer\"} \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLatest News, News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Residents of Bath encouraged to enrol in HSDE programme offered by HEART/NSTA Trust \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFebruary 3, 2026 \n\n\n MORANT BAY, ST Thomas —Residents of Bath, St Thomas, are being encouraged to enrol in the High School Diploma Equivalency (HSDE) programme offered by ... \n\n\n\n\n {\"jamaica-observer\":\"Jamaica Observer\"} \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment, Latest News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Money Pallet defends ‘Street Safety’ amid road carnage \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFebruary 3, 2026 \n\n\n St Thomas-based dancehall artiste Money Pallet is upset about the continued carnage on the nation's roads that is claiming the lives of many Jamaicans... \n\n\n\n\n {\"jamaica-observer\":\"Jamaica Observer\"} \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHOUSE RULES\n\n\n\nWe welcome reader comments on the top stories of the day.

There are a lot of emotions,” said Jose Perdomo, a 58-year-old municipal employee who also declared his backing “for the decisions taken by our interim president, Delcy Rodriguez.”\n\nHe added that “sooner or later they will have to free our president.”\n\n– ‘Prosperous and democratic’ –\n\nRodriguez was a staunch backer of Maduro, and served as his vice president.\n\nUS President Donald Trump has said he is willing to work with her as long as she toes Washington’s line, particularly on granting access to Venezuela’s vast oil reserves.\n\nUnder pressure, Rodriguez has started freeing political prisoners and opened Venezuela’s nationalized hydrocarbons industry to private investment.\n\nThe countries have reestablished diplomatic relations severed in 2019 after Maduro was accused of stealing his first reelection.\n\nAmerican envoy Laura Dogu arrived in Caracas on Saturday.\n\nOn Tuesday, in a video issued by the US mission, she pointed to a three-phase plan for the crisis-stricken South American country, ending in “the transition to a friendly, stable, prosperous and democratic Venezuela.”\n\n– Freedom ‘in the streets’ –\n\nEarlier on Tuesday, hundreds of university students and relatives of political prisoners also marched in the capital, calling for the quick approval of an amnesty law promised by Rodriguez.\n\nIt has not yet come before parliament, whose leader is the acting president’s brother, Jorge Rodriguez, another staunch Chavista and Maduro backer.\n\nAnti-government protests had been rare since the crackdown on demonstrations against Maduro’s contested claim to another reelection in 2024.\n\nMore than 2,000 people were jailed at the time.\n\n“Freedom is in the streets and no one can stop it!” chanted the crowd.\n\nThe opposition in Venezuela has been calling for fresh elections to be held after Maduro’s ouster.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTags: Nicolas Maduro Venezuela Venezuelans march \n\n\n\n\n\n\n {\"jamaica-observer\":\"Jamaica

(Photo by Charly TRIBALLEAU / AFP) \n\n International News, Latest News \n\nFebruary 3, 2026\n\n\n\n\n US judge halts end to Haitian migrants’ protections \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWASHINGTON, United States (AFP)—A US judge has blocked the Trump administration’s decision to strip some 350,000 Haitian immigrants of deportation protections set to expire Tuesday.\n\nIn a scathing 83-page ruling, Judge Ana Reyes declared that Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem does not have the authority to end the safeguards known as Temporary Protected Status (TPS).\n\n“Plaintiffs charge that Secretary Noem preordained her termination decision and did so because of hostility to nonwhite immigrants,” Reyes wrote. “This seems substantially likely.”\n\nNoem’s actions were “arbitrary and capricious,” the judge said.\n\nShe continued: “Kristi Noem has a First Amendment right to call immigrants killers, leeches, entitlement junkies, and any other inapt name she wants.”\n\nBut Noem is obligated “to apply faithfully the facts of the law in implementing the TPS program,” the judge said.\n\nHaiti’s many woes include severe poverty, rampant violence from heavily armed gangs that control much of the country including most of the capital Port-au-Prince, and chronic political instability.\n\nThe current transitional government is very weak, with Haiti not holding any elections in the past 10 years.\n\nIn Florida, which is home to more than 150,000 Haitians with TPS, activists and local lawmakers welcomed the judge’s decision but warned that the Trump administration could appeal it.\n\n“This is a step forward. This is breathing room, but breathing room is not stability,” said Marleine Bastien, a county-level lawmaker in the Miami area and a Haitian-born activist.\n\n“If it is not safe for US citizens to travel to Haiti, if it is not safe for planes to fly to Haiti, then by God, it is not safe for anyone to be forcibly returned there,” Bastien told a news conference.\n\nTPS protects its holders from deportation and allows them to work.\n\nIt is granted to people deemed to be in danger if they return to their home countries, because of war, natural disaster or other extraordinary circumstances.\n\nThe Trump administration has pushed to dismantle the TPS program as part of its broader immigration crackdown.\n\nIt argues that TPS lures undocumented immigrants, has been used improperly and was extended for too long under previous Democratic administrations.\n\nHaiti was designated as eligible for TPS after a devastating earthquake that struck it in 2010. This status has been extended several times, most recently in 2021 under the Biden administration.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTags: Donald Trump Haitian Migrants \n\n\n\n\n\n\n {\"jamaica-observer\":\"Jamaica Observer\"} \n\n\n\n\n\n0 Comments · Make a comment\n\n\n\n\n ALSO ON JAMAICA OBSERVER\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLatest News, News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Man shot and injured in Mount Salem \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFebruary 3, 2026 \n\n\n ST JAMES, Jamaica — A man has been rushed to hospital after he was shot and injured in Mount Salem, St James on Tuesday afternoon.

Anderson, head of the U.S. military’s Africa Command (AFRICOM), said the deployment followed discussions between Washington and Abuja on the need to strengthen efforts against militant groups operating in the region. This marks the first public acknowledgment of U.S. troops on Nigerian soil since American airstrikes were carried out on Christmas Day.\n\n“That has led to increased collaboration between our nations, including a small U.S. team that brings some unique capabilities from the United States,” Anderson told reporters during a press briefing. He did not disclose details about the size of the team or the scope of its mission.\n\nNigeria’s Defence Minister, Christopher Musa, confirmed that U.S. personnel were working in the country but also declined to provide further information.\n\nAccording to a former U.S. official, the team is believed to be focused primarily on intelligence gathering and supporting Nigerian forces in operations against terrorist-affiliated groups. Reuters had earlier reported that the U.S. had been conducting surveillance flights over Nigeria from neighbouring Ghana since at least late November.\n\nThe deployment comes after President Donald Trump ordered airstrikes in December against what he described as Islamic State targets in northwestern Nigeria and warned that further U.S. military action could follow. AFRICOM said one such strike, carried out in coordination with Nigerian authorities in Sokoto state, killed multiple Islamic State militants.\n\nWashington has recently increased pressure on Nigeria over security concerns, particularly after President Trump accused the Nigerian government of failing to protect Christian communities from Islamist militants.

On February 2, gold prices collapsed by 25% from their all-time high of $5,600 The slump in gold prices has been attributed to the nomination of Kevin Warsh as the next chair of the Fed.

Roosevelt, in part to hide a White House bunker.\n\nThe ballroom has also raised eyebrows due to it being completely funded by donors - including companies that have business before the U.S. government.\n\nAhead of Thursday's meeting, a group of about a dozen protesters, including some from the watchdog group Common Cause, gathered outside NCPC's headquarters holding up signs including 'corruption never looked so tacky.' \n\nInside the meeting, NCPC Chairman Will Scharf - Trump's handpicked leader who also serves as White House Staff Secretary - advised the handful of members of the public in attendance to keep the peace.\n\nScharf acknowledged there was an agenda item, 'the ballroom,' that has attracted 'passionate comments on both sides.'\n\n'While there will be opportunities for public comment on the ballroom project in the future, we would ask that you not disrupt the commission meeting today and if you do make an out of order disruption of the commission, we will, unfortunately, have to ask you to leave the room,' Scharf said.\n\nScharf also apologized in advance if he got moody. \n\n'To those of you who have made New Year's resolutions, I quit Nicotine eight days ago, so if I am irritable or less enthusiastic or energetic, that's the reason,' the chairman said to laughs.\n\nHe reiterated during the meeting that he believed NCPC didn't oversee demolitions, which allowed the East Wing to be torn down in October without any government oversight. \n\nNo disruptions interrupted the meeting, with the only pushback to the ballroom plans coming from members of the committee who represented the city.\n\nBaranes, who took over the project from architect James McCrery in November, said late that month a decision was made 'not to continue exploring options for increasing the size of the project.' \n\nThere were rumblings that Trump wanted the ballroom to be even bigger - as the pricetag of the project has now inflated to around $400 million. \n\nThe current plans for the ballroom are based off of one of the plans McCrery originally designed, which would include a 22,000 square foot ballroom that would fit 1,000 seated guests for dinner.\n\nThe overall new structure, which will include the East Wing offices that belonged to the first lady's staff, would be part of the overall 89,000 square foot two-story building. \n\nPhil Mendelson, a NCPC committee member and the chairman of the D.C. City Council, said he'd like to see the project shrink in size, for fear that the addition would overpower the main White House building. \n\n'I'm concerned about the significant overwhelming of the original historic building,' he told the committee,' Mendelson said. \n\nHe also expressed concern that the board was only looking at one portion of the White House project at a time.\n\n'The other observation I have is that it is disturbing to me that we are looking at an addition to this historic structure, but we're looking at what appears to be an overall plan in a very segmented approach,' he said. \n\n'So there's going to be some changes to the visitors' center, there's going to be some changes to Lafayette Park, there's going to be some changes to the West Wing,' he noted, expressing that he's prefer to view the project as a whole. \n\nLinda Argo, an NCPC commission members appointed by Washington, D.C.'s Democratic Mayor Muriel Bower, also said that she had 'some concerns about the size and scale in a number of ways.' \n\nThe National Trust for Historic Preservation has sued over the ballroom project, with a federal judge telling lawyers for the Department of Justice in December, who were defending the White House's position, that plans for the ballroom needed to be submitted to the NCPC and the Commission of Fine Arts by the end of 2025.\n\nScharf told the Daily Mail after the hearing that he thought today's presentation would likely satisfy the judge's request - despite more formalized plans coming from the White House at a later date.\n\nThe chairman didn't hide the fact that he was for the project proceeding, pointing to a planned visit by King Charles later this year. 'More likely than not, he will be hosted in a tent on the South Lawn with port-a-potties,' Scharf said.\n\n'That, to me, is not a good look for the United States of America,' he said. \n\nThe White House is hoping to fast-track the project so it will be completed by 2028, Trump's last full year in office.","summary":"The president showed off what the finished $300million product will look like in a rendering from the point of view of the Treasury Building across the street on his Truth Social page.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-15525573/Trump-new-rendering-White-House-ballroom.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2026/02/04/01/106083911-0-image-a-10_1770168703099.jpg","video":"https://video.dailymail.com/video/mol/2025/12/17/932161845822142049/1024x576_MP4_932161845822142049.mp4","publish_date":"2026-02-04 01:34:22","author":"Editor,Stephen M.

However, DHS—the agency that oversees immigration enforcement—was funded only through Feb 13 under a temporary continuing resolution.\nDemocrats have insisted that they will not back further funding for DHS without significant reforms to immigration enforcement policies, particularly in the wake of public outrage over fatal encounters between federal agents and US citizens in Minneapolis.\n“This bill is a great victory for the American people,” Trump said after signing the legislation.\nHouse Speaker Mike Johnson described passage of the funding plan as a responsible step toward regularising government appropriations, with about 96% of federal operations funded.\nBut congressional Democrats, led by House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries, have signalled continued resistance to extending DHS funding without changes to US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and related agencies. Rep. Pete Aguilar of California criticised the Trump administration’s handling of federal immigration operations, saying, “Donald Trump and Kristi Noem have been using Americans taxpayer dollars to terrorise law abiding immigrants, kill US citizens, detain children and endanger communities.”\nFresh battle ahead\nThe short funding window for DHS means lawmakers must return to negotiations in the coming days. Democrats are demanding reforms such as mandatory body cameras for immigration officers, banning masks during operations and limiting roving patrols, before agreeing to long-term funding.\nThe compromise bill avoids an omnibus package this year, but intense debate over immigration enforcement, particularly the role and accountability of ICE, is likely to consume Congress in the run-up to the Feb 13 deadline.","url":"https://www.firstpost.com/world/us-govts-partial-shutdown-ends-trump-signs-funding-bill-but-dhs-headache-persists-13975869.html","image":"https://images.firstpost.com/uploads/2026/02/AFP__20260203__962867L__v1__HighRes__PresidentTrumpSignsAnExecutiveOrder-2026-02-75063af111565187f0a3589c03cd0f5a-1200x675.jpg?im=FitAndFill=(1200,675)","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-02-04 01:32:41","author":null,"language":"en","source_country":"in","sentiment":-0.225},{"id":399132012,"title":"LA Metro gets $94.3 million from Congress for better transit during Olympics in 2028","text":"LA Metro will be getting help in enhancing transit during the Los Angeles Summer Olympic Games in 2028.\n\nThe U.S. Congress approved $94.3 million in transit and “mobility-related” funding for the LA 2028 Olympic and Paralympic Games, LA Metro announced on Tuesday, Feb. 3.\n\nThe bipartisan transportation spending measure was passed by Congress and signed into law by President Donald Trump.\n\nMetro will use the funds to plan for the crush of spectators descending on Southern California from July 14 to July 30, 2028, with the opening ceremony on July 14, 2028.

Tapper says it is due to the fact that no one wants to perform there anymore, plus seats for events that do happen are going unsold.\n\nAfter Donald Trump announced the shutdown of the Kennedy Center, Tapper posted a video on X, questioning the president’s narrative and revealing that ticket sales at the center have fallen to levels last seen during the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n“Whatever spin the White House wants to put on this, a lot of artists and a lot of would-be performing arts goers have voted with their feet, and the voting for the president was not positive,” Tapper said. “Though, of course, I’m sure he’ll reject that because he tends to reject negative election results.”\n\nWhat is President Trump doing to the Kennedy Center and why now? pic.twitter.com/YZfT8DXelQ\n— Jake Tapper 🦅 (@jaketapper) February 2, 2026\n\nMeanwhile, Tapper visited the Kennedy Center, to which Trump has recently has added his name, following the news that the president has decided to stop “Entertainment Operations” from July 4 for around two years.\n\nWhile trying to push his own agenda and taste on the center, Trump, 79, said he would take the “tired, broken, and dilapidated” venue and make it into a “new and beautiful Landmark.”\n\nThe president is a former real estate developer and he says he conducted a one-year review of the Kennedy Center with “Contractors, Musical Experts, Art Institutions, and other Advisors and Consultants,” and he then considered both a partial and full closure.\n\nMoreover, Trump justified shutting the center completely by claiming that “interruptions with Audiences from the many events” would impact the timing and quality of the Kennedy Center’s makeover.\n\nHowever, Tapper claims the true reason is that performers and audience members like don’t want Trump’s version of the center is the true cause for the decision.\n\n“Because of what the president was doing, artists started canceling their performances here. And in fact, it got so bad that last October, the Washington Post reported that ticket sales for orchestra, theater and dance performances were the lowest they had been since the COVID pandemic,” he said.\n\nEarlier, Grammy-winning soprano Renée Fleming, cancelled her appearance at the center, giving her reason as a “scheduling conflict.” Meanwhile, renowned composer Philip Glass has withdrawn the much-anticipated world premiere of his Symphony No. 15, “Lincoln” last week, simply citing the reason as “current leadership.”\n\nMoreover, the Martha Graham Dance Company has canceled its booked April performance. Next, the center’s newly appointed programming chief resigned after a few days spent in the role. Furthermore, the Washington National Opera brought its five-decade run at the Kennedy Center to an end earlier this month.\n\nWhen Trump took over the Kennedy Center last year, he started purging the center’s board, while firing its president and chairman. He then appointed loyalist Ric Grenell as the president, and he himself as chairman of the center. After all these changes, the president insists he is saving the institution.\n\n“People don’t realize that The Trump Kennedy Center suffered massive deficits for many years and, like everything else, I merely came in to save it and, if possible, make it far better than ever before!” he wrote in a Truth Social post last week.","summary":"CNN anchor Jake Tapper has revealed the real reason President Donald Trump is closing the Kennedy Center.","url":"https://www.inquisitr.com/nobody-wants-to-perform-there-cnns-jake-tapper-on-trumps-excuse-for-kennedy-center-shutdown","image":"https://www.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/jake-tapper.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-02-04 01:30:59","author":"Anne Sewell","authors":["Anne Sewell"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.02},{"id":399134778,"title":"Literature of the absurd","text":"If there’s a Theater of the Absurd, of which Waiting for Godot is one of the prime examples, then these three novels would make a similar claim to be literary works that revel in the absurd and ridiculous, to our reading joy.\n\n\"Futility\" by Nuzo Onoh \n\nA Nigerian-British author who has received the Bram Stoker Award for Lifetime Achievement, Onoh is hailed as the Queen of African Horror, and this is her latest. Playing gleefully and in a demented manner on the themes of female retribution and punishment, we find two women as the central characters of the storyline. First, there is Chia, a woman who runs a highly regarded restaurant in Abuja, Nigeria. Their best-selling dish, a hot pepper meat soup, has a secret ingredient that would qualify as body horror. Then there is Claire, a 50-year-old white woman/diplomat who similarly resides in Abuja, but with Kolade, her Nigerian boy toy, and his beautiful young cousin Shadé. And back in the village where Chia hails from, there’s her mother, Obidibo, an imperious force who wields a lot of juju magic and can still make Chia quake in her stilettos.\n\nAfrican folklore spirits and depraved dark humor populate the narrative. There’s a trickster spirit, Oke-Mmuo, who wreaks havoc on the life of Chia, while body-swapping is what befalls Claire. Onoh pushes all the right buttons in upping the stakes of her dual-strand narrative, and when the two strands intersect, it’s mayhem galore. There’s Chia’s lifelong quest for a British visa, while Claire’s body swap is as silly/funny as that from the film \"Trading Places.\" An interlude set in London is Nigerian Black magic set loose in Knightsbridge and Mayfair hotels. And throughout all the horror and chilling comedy, there’s the underlying message of how men treat women, how women react, and how women treat their fellow women. Onoh may be an acquired taste, but she’s evidently the pioneer for younger writers like Oyinkan Braithwaite, who wrote \"My Sister, the Serial Killer.\"\n\n\"Big Time\" by Jordan Prosser \n\nA noted screenplay writer from Australia, this is Prosser’s first novel, and it’s one energetic storyline that blends SciFi with social commentary and a unique take on time travel. Set in a near-future Australia where the eastern states have become an autocracy. Pop music is propaganda, Science is considered the enemy, and moral indecency is punished with indefinite detention. Our main protagonist would be Julian Ferryman, bass player for The Acceptables. He arrives in Melbourne from South America to reconnect with the band and work on their second album. Ash, singer-composer, has taken on the mantle of sole band leader in Julian’s absence, and has even begun a relationship with Oriana, Julian’s ex. Also at the story’s core is a new designer drug that’s simply called F, and allows one to hallucinate one’s own future.\n\nA second narrative strand has to do with a pandemic of extreme coincidences, like the same football match being played 60 years apart with a different set of players, but exactly the same result, and the goals being scored at the exact same times. It’s a Vonnegut time loop, and watch out for when the different strands intersect in the name of scientific Discovery and Research. The FREA (Federal Republic of Eastern Australia) is just one aspect of this dystopian Australia Prosser-universe, and what a mind-blowing psychedelic road trip it turns out to be. Against all expectations, the FREA sponsors an academic symposium on the Anomaly, and the narrative strands interact when the band members meet the scientists at a Botany hotel. The novel does go off tangent at times, but you admire the ambition and scope - and the smart and funny tone of this contemplative adventure. \n\n\"Humdinger\" by Rick Mason \n\nThe art cover alone will tell you what you can expect from this woolly tale of a novel. It’s Trump America, in all its brazen and shameless glory. Ronald Humdinger is dead, having expired while enjoying the services of a dwarf dominatrix in a brothel in the border city of Tijuana, the \"Gateway to Mexico.\" A mean misanthrope, Humdinger is also a popular cult-like one-term politician and owns a business conglomerate. There’s a TV game show, plus an enterprise of turning abandoned shipping containers into homes for the homeless. Humdinger Habitats has now hired private detective Alex (Ace) Bancroft to ascertain if there was foul play and uncover the true circumstances of Ronald’s death. This leads to a hilarious and highly educational chapter, when Ace interviews the dominatrix, and we’re treated to the sordid details of an S&M session.\n\nA mass of walking contradictions, Humdinger is described like a small town version of the Donald we know from news reports. Ace is both our narrator and tour guide to this Baja California city that lies just south of San Diego, and he soon suspects there is more than what meets the eye with Humdinger’s demise. But of course, that’s not what Humdinger Habitats’ management really wants to hear. The colorful characters that populate this novel help make it a highly entertaining read. It’s Crime Fiction that’s not the usual polished product we’re offered, but a satirical mystery that has both wit and humor. On the cover, we have the subheading of how the book is about politics, death, and debauchery. If we’re talking about how business and economics are often entwined with politics, then this novel corroborates that notion, with a bunch of laughs along the way.","url":"https://mb.com.ph/2026/02/04/literature-of-the-absurd","image":"https://mb.com.ph/manilabulletin/uploads/global_files/default_meta_image.png","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-02-04 01:30:00","author":"Philip Cu Unjieng","authors":["Philip Cu Unjieng"],"language":"en","source_country":"ph","sentiment":0.391},{"id":399133638,"title":"Presidents Donald Trump and Gustavo Petro target drug trafficking","text":"Feb. 3 (UPI) -- President Donald Trump and Colombian President Gustavo Petro on Tuesday agreed to cooperate on thwarting drug trafficking and discussed sanctions during a late-morning meeting.\n\n\"He and I weren't exactly the best of friends, but I wasn't insulted because I never met him.

Email tips@dailymail.co.uk\nBy EIRIAN JANE PROSSER, SENIOR REPORTER \n Published:00:44 GMT, 4 February 2026 |Updated:01:24 GMT, 4 February 2026 \n\nArchitecturally challenging home rebuilds have long been a staple of TV favourite Grand Designs - where the tension of balancing owners' big ambitions with their limited budgets provides a gripping sense of jeopardy.\nBut a scene now unfolding in one particularly well-heeled corner of the famously moneyed Cotswolds is of a different order altogether: because although this makeover is as ambitious as any of its kind ever attempted in UK history, the budget is practically unlimited.\nAnd that's because the owner in this case is Sir Jony Ive - the design guru credited with making Apple products like the iPhone, iPad and iMac the best selling tech products in history - whose personal fortune is so vast he is thought to be nearing billionaire status.\nAnd it's just as well Sir Jony is renowned for his attention to detail because his Tudor manor house has Grade I listed status which means the enormous upgrade he is undertaking has to be carried out with micro-level care if he's not to fall foul of heritage inspectors.\nSir Jony, 58, is thought to have decided to return permanently to the UK after three triumphant decades in California which saw him spend £17million to acquire the historic manor house set in four acres of landscaped grounds.\nApple's former lead designer bought the sprawling property in a chocolate box village in Gloucestershire in 2023, a year after he officially left Apple.\nWhen Sir Jony and his wife Heather Pegg eventually move into their home, they will become the latest of the rich and famous now making the Cotswolds their home joining the likes of David and Victoria Beckham, Ellen Degeneres and Beyonce and Jay Z.\nAs well as the manor house itself being Grade I listed - the highest category of protection in English law covering only the most noteworthy properties - a number of outbuildings on the estate are Grade II listed, providing further challenges to Sir Jony's scheme.\n\nSir Jony Ive - the design guru behind iconic Apple products like the iPhone, iPad and iMac - is thought to have decided to return permanently to the UK after three triumphant decades in California, to the £17million home (pictured) he bought in the Cotswolds in 2023\n\nAnd it's just as well he is renowned for his attention to detail because his Tudor manor house, which he is currently renovating (pictured), is Grade I listed - so the enormous upgrade needs to be carried out with micro-level care if he's not to fall foul of heritage inspectors\n\nIn addition, a number of outbuildings on the estate (pictured) are Grade II listed, providing further challenges to Sir Jony's scheme\n\nPlans for the extraordinary project have been submitted by architects working on behalf of Sir Jony to the local council\n\nWhen Sir Jony and his wife Heather Pegg (pictured together in 2017) eventually move into their home, they will become the latest of the rich and famous now making the Cotswolds their home\nBut the designer is completely rethinking the layout of the estate to make his new family home more modern and sleeker - without compromising its historic status.\nAnd while the budget for the project has not been made public, the fact that Ive is using Foster and Partners - one of the most renowned architectural firms in the world, founded by legendary Lord Foster - gives a sense of how money is no object in the budget.\nOne local told us: 'The most ambitious project on Grand Designs has nothing on what's happening here - what Sir John is doing is like trying to build a James Bond villain's lair inside the fragile shell of a very old building.\n'He even has a Bond villain's private army in the shape of the dozens of workers he's using every day. And amazingly he seems to be carrying it off without any drama at all - which is frankly incredible.'\nThe three year renovation project, which started a few months ago, is now in full swing with the main building now scaffolded and hidden under vast plastic covers and as many as 100 workers on site each day.\nMeanwhile the high profile owner is thought to be living off site but visiting regularly to keep tabs on the fine details.\nAmong the upgrades planned by Sir Jony and artist Heather, who married in 1987 and who have two adult children, are decidedly non-Tudor: there will be an underground car park and a swimming pool.\nThe existing tennis court is set to be completely rebuilt while the home's historic riding stables are set to get a full makeover.\nThe home will also have a Silicon Valley spec studio created which might be used for further developing Sir Jony's latest project - he's working with ChatGPT's creator Sam Alton on a new AI product.\nThe old property will also get underfloor heating, while some of the home's outbuildings that aren't listed, including a workshop and machinery stores, as well as the housekeepers quarters, are set to be demolished.\n\nWhile the budget for overhauling the estate (pictured) has not been made public, the fact Ive is using Foster and Partners - one of the most renowned architectural firms in the world, founded by legendary Lord Foster - gives a sense of how money is no object\n\nThe three year renovation project, which started a few months ago, is now in full swing with the main building now scaffolded and hidden under vast plastic covers (pictured)\n\nThe project has received planning permission from the council and is expected to take three years \nIn order to assuage any concerns that the renovations will disturb wildlife on the estate they have voluntarily decided to build a bat house in the grounds.\nThere will also be an independent electrical substation to power the estate.\nIn a nod to the traditions of an historic estate, there are also plans to build an orangery - a cross between a green house and a conservatory where exotic fruit could be grown.\nA cottage on the grounds will also get a modern makeover.\nFoster and Partners said that the three-year project will deliver 'an architectural vision'.\nDesigners said the manor offers 'an exceptional opportunity to preserve and enhance important historic buildings set within a landscape'.\nThe group added that the couple intend to continue to use the property as a family home as it has been used for centuries previously.\nWhen the plans first surfaced there was uproar from locals living in the upmarket hamlet with some calling the scale of the proposals 'ridiculous' and 'a pretentious vanity project', according to local reports.\n\nMeanwhile the high profile owner (left, with fellow Apple designer Marc Newson) is thought to be living off site but visiting regularly to keep tabs on the fine details\n\nAmong the upgrades planned by Sir Jony (pictured in 2021) and artist Heather, who married in 1987 and who have two adult children, are an underground car park and a swimming pool\nOne resident in the picturesque village said at the time: 'The prospect of this lasting over three years is totally unacceptable, especially for someone who is not going to live here.\n'This vanity project will impact greatly on the community without any benefit to the community.'\nAnother added 'The listed walls must not be tampered with. The owner seeks to turn the Manor into a private fortress.'\nThe local Parish Council held a meeting where 50 locals turned up to voice their concerns - mostly about the traffic and how long the project would take.\nYet conciliatory Sir Jony appears to have gone to extraordinary lengths to make sure such concerns were not borne out - launching a charm offensive and ensuring disruption is kept to a minimum.\nAs a result village residents appear to have been almost entirely won over by the Ives' 'terribly kind' nature - and gestures like a generous donation of wine to a literary festival held in a neighbouring village of Bibury.\nEven when the main road in front of the manor estate had to be partially closed as water works were carried out on the site recently, there was no local uprising.\nOne neighbour told the Daily Mail: 'We were concerned at the scale of the planned works.\n'The initial feeling was that it was bound to cause disruption in a village this small when someone buys a house that big and they want to substantially renovate it.\n'Having said that all the workers are very pleasant and the Ives who have bought it are a terribly nice couple who are very aware of any disruption they are causing in the village.'\nAnd local councillor Craig Chapman, who sits on the parish council's committee for the development has said that Ives have continued to work with the community to make sure there are no issues as works continue.\nHe said: 'They have been the most collaborative group I can imagine. There have been no issues.\n'They came to the parish council to present on the project then we agreed to set up a working group and they have been perfect.\n\nWhen the plans for the estate (pictured) first surfaced there was uproar from locals living in the upmarket hamlet with some calling the scale of the proposals 'ridiculous' and 'a pretentious vanity project'\n\nYet conciliatory Sir Jony appears to have gone to extraordinary lengths to make sure such concerns were not borne out - launching a charm offensive and ensuring disruption to the project at his new home (pictured) is kept to a minimum\n\nAs a result village residents appear to have been almost entirely won over by Sir Jony (pictured at Goodwood in 2021) and his family's 'terribly kind' nature - and gestures like a generous donation of wine to a literary festival held in a neighbouring village of Bibury\n'Any issues they listen to. They have a WhatsApp group where they feed information back to locals. They have been model in the way they have reacted.\n'Initially people were worried because it is a big project and they thought it was bound to disrupt the community but they have been perfect.'\nAnother neighbour added: 'From what I've heard they have been very courteous about it all. No one I've spoken to seems to have an issue with it and of course they've known about it for ages.'\nAppleiPhoneJames Bond\n\nShare or comment on this article: \nThe house iPhone built: Apple icon Sir Jony Ive under fire for turning his £17million listed Cotswolds mansion into a 'James Bond lair'\n\nAdd comment\n\n Share what you think\n\nNo comments have so far been submitted.

I remember having sleepovers and going ''I wonder if they're going to kiss me.''\nMillie added that a lot of her struggles have been unpacked in therapy, telling Caggie: 'I've explored a lot of my relationship to women, I was bullied so I definitely have intimacy issues with women, but there's this attraction as well.'\n\nMillie, who went sober in 2022, is said to have found being fully open 'a lot to deal with'\n\nThe TV personality revealed that during her teenage years, she struggled to express her attraction to women, and would only find the courage to 'kiss' them when she was drunk\nShe continued: 'Obviously I'm married to a man, it's not something that affects our relationship at all now, but looking back and realising that was one of the reasons I drank in a destructive way, because there was a part of myself I didn't understand and I didn't know how to express it and I felt scared to express it.\n'Every time I would drink I would just keep doing it, even if I was in a relationship.'\nSharing the moment she opened up to husband Hugo Taylor about her sexuality, she revealed that he was incredibly supportive. \nThe Daily Mail revealed on Monday Millie and Hugo Taylor had split after seven years of marriage. \nSources close to the pair say they remain committed to co-parenting their young children, who continue to be their priority, and to maintaining a loving family life.\nMillie and Hugo, who met as teenagers and first dated during E4's Made In Chelsea, had been married since June 2018.\nA source revealed: 'Millie and Hugo are currently going through a separation and have sadly decided to split. \n'They have known each other for many years, and in recent weeks, have had serious conversations about their future, ultimately deciding it's better for them both to part ways.\n'Their main priority remains their children and family life, and separating is not something they ever hoped would happen.\n'At present, they are considering what living apart might look like and how they plan to navigate co-parenting their young children.\n'It's been an incredibly difficult start to the year, and one they hope to continue managing in private.' \n\nMillie first met Hugo as a teenager, and they began dating when she was 21, rising to fame together on the E4 reality series.\nIn 2013, the heiress married rapper Professor Green, 42, but the couple divorced in 2016, the same year she rekindled her relationship with Hugo.\nThe pair tied the knot two years later and welcomed their first daughter, Sienna, in 2020, followed by Aurelia in 2021.\nIn recent years, Millie has been open with her fans about her past struggles with alcohol, which led her to become teetotal and write the book Bad Drunk, as well as her journey in overcoming severe anxiety. \nMillie has spoken candidly about how she began binge drinking at a young age while at boarding school, using alcohol to cope with being away from home, bullying and her own insecurities.\nHugo TaylorMade In ChelseaMillie Mackintosh\n\nShare or comment on this article: \nMillie Mackintosh's split from husband Hugo Taylor 'was sparked after the star's admissions about her sexuality and alcohol addiction formed a rift in their marriage'\n\nAdd comment\n\n Share what you think\n\nWorst rated\n\nThe comments below have not been moderated.\n\nThe views expressed in the contents above are those of our users and do not necessarily reflect the views of MailOnline.\n\nAdd your comment\n\nEnter your comment\n\nBy posting your comment you agree to our house rules.\n\nSubmit Comment\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual.\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual\n\nWe will automatically post your comment and a link to the news story to your Facebook timeline at the same time it is posted on MailOnline.

Gavin Newsom’s Prop. 50 was a hit with California voters who approved the anti-Trump redistricting plan by huge margins. Turns out his wine company got a cut of the deal, too. \n\nNewsom raised $120 million last year to help pass the Election Rigging Response Act, intended to help Democrats win the House of Representatives this year by rejiggering California congressional maps to wipe out as many as five Republican-held seats. \n\nA whopping $26,882.89 of that donor cash was spent at Plumpjack Wines — Newsom’s ritzy San Francisco’s based wine shop — for a fundraising event, according to campaign filings unearthed by the Post. \n\nIt wasn’t the first time Newsom picked up a truckload of his own pricey wines at donors’ expense. Newsom’s Campaign for Democracy Committee — his national political machine raising millions to help burnish his national image and rail against corruption in President Donald Trump’s administration — splashed out $23,792.12 at Plumpjack Wines across two events in September and October 2023.\n\n“It’s certainly not a good luck for him and it does raise transparency issues,” said James Christopher, a New York-based political strategist. “As the old saying goes, those in glass houses shouldn’t throw stones.” \n\nAttorney Mark Meuser, who is leading the effort to challenge Prop. 50 in federal court, called the Newsom wine purchases “deeply troubling.”\n\n“Routing campaign dollars to a business long tied to his name reinforces perceptions of self-dealing,” Meuser said. “Americans across the political spectrum are fed up with politicians who use their power for personal gain.”\n\nPlumpjack is the crown jewel of the multimillion-dollar booze empire Newsom founded in 1991 with help from Gordon Getty, the oil billionaire who bankrolled his political rise. \n\nNewsom’s assets include the upscale San Francisco bar Balboa Cafe, Mastros Steakhouse, the Plumpjack Group and a collection of other wine, hospitality and retail businesses held in a blind trust called the Gavin C. Newsom Blind Trust, according a disclosure filed with the state last year. \n\nPlumpjack, headquartered in San Francisco’s exclusive Marina District, sells premium wines ranging from $62 per bottle to $884 or more for a 2-pack Vineyard Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon, according to its website. \n\nNewsom’s sprawling wine empire includes Plumpjack Winery in Oakville, Calif., which he co-founded with Gordon Getty, Napa Valley-based Odette Estate Winery, and roughly a dozen other associated entities, according to Newsom’s economic disclosure form filed last year. \n\nHis wineries have hosted exclusive charity events like “Vineyard Vibes,” a benefit for Plumpjack Foundation, where Newsom was spotted sipping a glass as chaotic anti-ICE protests roiled Los Angeles last summer. \n\nReached for comment, Newsom advisor Lindsey Cobia pointed the finger at Trump. \n\n“This is not a conflict. The only one enriching themselves in office is Donald Trump, who has already accumulated nearly $12 billion of crypto holdings and $800 million of income from foreign nationals and state linked entities seeking to curry favor with his administration,” she said. \n\nMeuser countered that Newsom should “lead by example and recognize that true leadership means avoiding even the appearance of using public position for private benefit.” \n\n“This isn’t just about one event, it is about restoring trust in a system where the connected politicians play by different rules.”\n\nNewsom cast himself as star in the Prop. 50 effort, spending tens of millions blanketing the airwaves with ads painting the ballot measure as key to protecting democracy against a corruption and authoritarian White House.\n\nHis federal Campaign for Democracy fund has spent heavily to build Newsom’s profile ahead of an expected presidential run, hawking merch like $100 anti-Trump “kneepads” and offering donors free copies of Newsom’s memoir Young Man in a Hurry in exchange for donations.\n\nJeff Burton, partner at the political consultancy Maven Advocacy, said voters may overlook the appearance of self-dealing in the modern era — to a point. “Where there’s smoke, there’s fire — whether there’s more here remains to be seen,” he said.","summary":"It wasn't the first time Newsom picked up a truckload of his own pricey wines at donors' expense.","url":"https://nypost.com/2026/02/03/us-news/gavin-newsom-spent-donor-money-at-his-own-wine-business-filings/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2026/02/comp-GettyImages-1408305140.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/yBYVNv5S-RyIcpnTz.mp4","publish_date":"2026-02-04 01:17:46","author":"Annie Gaus","authors":["Annie Gaus"],"language":"en","source_country":"zm","sentiment":-0.076},{"id":399131946,"title":"Trump reacts to NBC host Savannah Guthrie's mother Nancy's mysterious abduction","text":"President Donald Trump vowed on Tuesday to personally call NBC \"Today\" co-host Savannah Guthrie and offer additional federal assistance following her mother's apparent abduction in Tuscon, Arizona. Nancy Guthrie, 84, was last seen at her home at about 9:30 p.m. Saturday, and was reported missing by her family around noon Sunday, according to the Pima County Sheriff's Department. While officials did not immediately elaborate on the circumstances of her disappearance, they said they believe Nancy Guthrie was either kidnapped or abducted, and noted blood was found outside the home. During a Q&A session in the White House Oval Office Tuesday, Trump said he is considering sending additional federal agents to assist with the investigation.

I think it's a terrible thing. … Very unusual situation, but we're going to find out.\" Despite the pair's showdown in an October 2020 NBC town hall, Trump added, \"I always got along very good with Savannah.\" During the Miami town hall, Savannah Guthrie pressed Trump on his administration's handling of the COVID-19 pandemic, and his social media reposts questioning Osama bin Laden's death. At one point, she accused Trump of \"sending a lie\" to his followers, comparing him to \"someone's crazy uncle.\" NBC'S SAVANNAH GUTHRIE TO PULL OUT AS HOST OF WINTER OLYMPICS OPENING CEREMONY AS MOTHER REMAINS MISSING While the Pima County Sheriff's Department and FBI continue to investigate Nancy Guthrie's disappearance, officials on Tuesday confirmed they are \"aware\" of reports of a possible ransom note. \"We are aware of reports circulating about possible ransom note(s) regarding the investigation into Nancy Guthrie,\" the sheriff's office wrote in a statement Tuesday afternoon. \"Anything that comes in, goes directly to our detectives who are coordinating with the FBI.\" SAVANNAH GUTHRIE ASKS FOR PRAYER AS HER MOTHER REMAINS MISSING: 'WE NEED YOU' News outlets TMZ and KOLD 13 News announced on Tuesday they received unverified ransom notes demanding money for Nancy Guthrie's return.

Did you receive him and welcome him or not? And I think that there’s a deep reflection that needs to be made in terms of what’s happening,” he told reporters, referencing the gospel of Matthew. “Many people who’ve lived for years and years and years, never causing problems, have been deeply affected by what’s going on right now.”\n\nOn Tuesday, MeidasTouch reporter Pablo Manríquez told Johnson, “Pope Leo has cited Matthew 25:35 to critique Donald Trump’s mass deportation agenda. How would you respond to Pope Leo in scripture?”\n\n“So you want me to give you a theological dissertation? All right. I tell you what. I’ll post it on my website later today, but let me give you a quick summary,” Johnson responded before launching into a soliloquy insisting that the Bible says “assimilation is expected and anticipated and proper.”\n\n“When someone comes into your country, comes into your nation, they do not have the right to change its laws or to change a society. They’re expected to assimilate. We haven’t had a lot of that going on,” he said.\n\nJohnson also said that scripture mandates that civil authorities maintain order, which he claimed the Biden-Harris administration failed to do.\n\n“We did not take care of our borders,” he said. “We should love our neighbor as ourselves, as individuals, but as a civil authority, the government has to maintain the law, and that is biblical.”\n\nAfter finishing his two-minute speech, Johnson went on X to write more than 1,300 words further defending his argument.\n\n“Despite the unfounded claims of the Left, supporting a strong national border is a very Christian thing to do. The Bible tells us so,” he concluded.\n\nIt might take more than that to convince Pope Leo, who has consistently criticized the Trump administration’s handling of immigration.\n\nAfter ICE agents in Illinois refused to allow priests and laypeople to provide communion at a detention facility, Leo said “the spiritual rights of people who have been detained should also be considered, and I would certainly invite the authorities to allow pastoral workers to attend to the needs of those people.”\n\nAhead of the vote to fund the Department of Homeland Security, Cardinal Joseph Tobin, Leo’s top ally in the U.S., urged lawmakers to “vote against renewing funding for such a lawless organization.” A measure funding the agency for two weeks was signed by President Donald Trump on Tuesday.\n\nOn Sunday, Leo said in an X post that he had received “greatly troubling news” following a Wall Street Journal report citing insiders who said the Trump administration was planning a regime change in Cuba by the end of the year.","summary":"Getty ImagesMike Johnson put on his theologian hat and broke down scripture for the Vicar of Christ.\n\nThe House Speaker, a 54-year-old devout Southern Baptist, delivered a theological dissertation on Tuesday after he was asked to respond to comments made by Pope Leo XIV about the Trump administration’s hardline immigration agenda.\n\nRead more at The Daily Beast.","url":"https://www.thedailybeast.com/mike-johnson-mansplains-religion-to-the-pope/","image":"https://www.thedailybeast.com/resizer/v2/MPR55QRMGZHTRJG2GKOPKDZOVA.jpg?smart=true&auth=fad00163289b4501204731537e5812cd6ac30555b506864106f779b7bb67df0c&width=1440&height=1080","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-02-04 01:16:10","author":"Julia Ornedo","authors":["Julia Ornedo"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.104},{"id":399132080,"title":"Trump calls Colombia's Petro ‘terrific’ just weeks after insulting him as a ‘sick man’","text":"President Donald Trump met for nearly two hours with Colombian President Gustavo Petro at the White House on Tuesday (February 3, 2026), conducting a friendly face-to-face mere weeks after threatening military action against the South American country and accusing the leader of pumping cocaine into the United States.\n\nMr. Trump said afterwards that he and Mr. Petro had not been \"the best of friends,\" suggesting that he had felt insulted by the President of Colombia because he did not know him and because the two had never met.\n\nAfterwards, he had changed his mind, saying, \"We had a very good meeting. I thought he was terrific.\" Mr. Trump said the pair discussed cooperation in counter-narcotics operations and a number of other topics.\n\nThe meeting followed Mr. Trump saying Mr. Petro, who has continued to criticise Mr. Trump and the U.S. operation to capture Venezuela's Nicolás Maduro, has become more willing to work with his administration to stem the flow of illegal drugs from Colombia.\n\nThe good feelings seemed to be mutual\n\nMr. Petro posted on X a picture of Mr. Trump's book \"The Art of the Deal,\" with a signed inscription reading, \"You are great.\" Colombia's President wrote, ironically, in Spanish, \"What did Trump mean to say to me with this dedication? I don't understand English very well.\" \n\nMr. Petro also said in an interview with Colombia's Caracol Radio that he asked Mr. Trump to help mediate an escalating trade war between his country and Ecuador.\n\nStill, past bad blood continues to loom. Indeed, in the days prior to Tuesday's (February 3, 2026) meeting, Mr. Petro, a leftist politician, continued to poke at the conservative U.S. President, calling Mr. Trump an \"accomplice to genocide\" in the Gaza Strip, while asserting that the capture of Mr. Maduro was a kidnapping.\n\nAnd ahead of his departure for Washington, Mr. Petro called on Colombians to take to the streets of Bogotá during the White House meeting. He plans to hold a news conference at the Colombian Embassy in Washington later Tuesday (Ferbuary 3, 2026).\n\nMr. Petro brought along Foreign Relations Minister Rosa Yolanda Villavicencio, Defence Minister Pedro Arnulfo Sánchez Suárez and Ambassador Daniel García-Peña, while Mr. Trump was joined by Vice President J.D. Vance, Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Republican Senator Bernie Moreno, R-Ohio, who was born in Colombia.\n\nJust minutes before the meeting started, Mr. Petro, in a video shared by his office, described himself as a politician who has denounced and prosecuted drug traffickers.\n\nAccompanied by one of his daughters and his granddaughter, he lamented that most of his children live outside of Colombia, in exile, due to the fight he is waging against drug trafficking. \"We have truly suffered its effects directly,\" Mr. Petro said.\n\nAn ally of U.S.\n\nHistorically, Colombia has been a U.S. ally. For the past 30 years, the U.S. has worked closely with Colombia, the world's largest producer of cocaine, to arrest drug traffickers, fend off rebel groups and boost economic development in rural areas. Colombia is also designated by the U.S. as a major non-NATO ally.\n\nBut relations between the leaders have been strained by Mr. Trump's massing of U.S. forces in the region for unprecedented deadly military strikes targeting suspected drug-smuggling boats in the Caribbean Sea and the eastern Pacific. At least 126 people have been killed in 36 known strikes.\n\nIn October, Mr. Trump's Republican administration announced it was imposing sanctions on Mr. Petro, his family and a member of his government over accusations of involvement in the global drug trade.\n\nThe Treasury Department levelled the penalties against Mr. Petro; his wife, Veronica del Socorro Alcocer Garcia; his son, Nicolas Fernando Petro Burgos; and Colombian Interior Minister Armando Alberto Benedetti.\n\nThe sanctions, which had to be waived to allow Mr. Petro to travel to Washington this week, came after the U.S. administration in September announced it was adding Colombia to a list of nations failing to cooperate in the drug war for the first time in three decades.\n\nThen came the audacious military operation last month to capture Mr. Maduro and his wife to face federal drug conspiracy charges, a move that Mr. Petro has forcefully denounced. Following Mr. Maduro's ouster, Mr. Trump put Colombia on notice and ominously warned Mr. Petro he could be next.\n\nColombia is \"run by a sick man who likes making cocaine and selling it to the United States,\" Mr. Trump said of Mr. Petro last month. \"And he's not gonna be doing it very long, let me tell you.\" \n\nBut a few days later, tensions eased somewhat after a call between the leaders. Trump said Petro, in their hour-long conversation, explained \"the drug situation and other disagreements.\" And Trump extended an invitation to Petro for the White House visit.\n\nTrump skips greeting Petro, who comes bearing gifts\n\nThe Colombian President said he had planned to use the meeting to detail his country's counter-narcotics initiatives to Mr. Trump.

White House spokeswoman Karoline Leavitt told Fox News that US envoy Steve Witkoff is still expected \"to have conversations with the Iranians late this week,\" despite the incident. The downing of the drone was the second clash between the foes in Middle Eastern waters on the same day, after Iranian forces attempted to detain a US-flagged tanker in the Strait of Hormuz. Washington and Tehran have agreed to talks after US President Donald Trump repeatedly threatened Iran with military action -- and Iran warned that it would respond with strikes on US vessels and bases. The United States bombed Iran's nuclear sites last summer, and has sent a naval battlegroup back to the region since Tehran's deadly crackdown on anti-government protests. Negotiations are now set for Friday, but Trump has refused to rule out military action and his Iranian counterpart Masoud Pezeshkian insists talks will only go ahead provided they were free of threats. \"An F-35C fighter jet from Abraham Lincoln shot down the Iranian drone in self-defense,\" Central Command spokesman Captain Tim Hawkins said in a statement. The aircraft carrier was dispatched to the Arabian Sea last month amid a buildup of US forces. - 'Bad things' - Trump had told Iranians that \"help is on its way\" during anti-government protests in Iran that were met with a deadly crackdown last month. Pezeshkian confirmed on Tuesday that he had ordered the start of talks with the United States, provided they were free of threats, after Trump suggested \"bad things\" would happen without a deal. Iran has not confirmed where the talks will take place but said Turkey, Oman and \"some other countries in the region\" had expressed willingness to host them, adding that the venue and timing were \"not a complicated issue.\" Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu told Witkoff in Jerusalem on Tuesday that Iran \"cannot be trusted,\" according to a statement from Netanyahu's office. The US opposes Iran's nuclear program, which it maintains is a precursor to acquiring nuclear weapons, while Tehran insists it is for civilian research purposes. Washington also wants to curtail Iran's support for proxy forces in the region and cut its vast arsenal of ballistic missiles. \"I have instructed my minister of foreign affairs, provided that a suitable environment exists -- one free from threats and unreasonable expectations -- to pursue fair and equitable negotiations,\" Pezeshkian wrote in a post on X. Iran has repeatedly stressed that any talks should focus solely on the nuclear issue and not its missile program or defense capabilities. While Trump and Pezeshkian insisted they were dedicated to talks, US and Iranian forces were in action at sea. A US-flagged tanker was challenged on Tuesday by Iranian gunboats in the Strait of Hormuz, US Central Command said. Spokesman Captain Tim Hawkins said two Iranian boats and a drone approached the M/V Stena Imperative \"and threatened to board and seize the tanker.\" A US destroyer responded with air support and escorted the tanker onwards. British maritime security firm Vanguard Tech reported that the Stena Imperative was approached by three pairs of small armed boats belonging to the Revolutionary Guards while transiting the strait 16 nautical miles (30 kilometers) north of Oman. The ship increased speed and maintained course, the firm added, stressing it did not enter Iranian waters. But the Iranian news agency Fars said a vessel, whose nationality it did not specify, had entered the country's territorial waters in the Strait of Hormuz. \"It was therefore warned and immediately left Iranian waters,\" Fars said. - Thousands arrested - Protests against the rising cost of living broke out in Tehran in December before evolving into wider nationwide anti-government demonstrations that triggered a deadly crackdown by the authorities. Iranian officials have acknowledged more than 3,000 deaths during the unrest, but insist that most were members of the security forces and innocent bystanders, attributing the violence to \"terrorist acts.\" The Human Rights Activists News Agency, a US-based NGO, says it has confirmed 6,872 deaths, mostly protesters killed by security forces, with other rights groups warning the figure is far higher. On Tuesday, the NGO said it had counted at least 50,553 arrests linked to the protests, with further detentions ongoing. Iranian authorities have said the \"riots\" were inflamed by the United States and Israel.","summary":"The downing of the drone was the second clash between the foes in Middle Eastern waters on the same day, after Iranian forces attempted to detain a US-flagged tanker in the Strait of Hormuz","url":"https://www.deccanchronicle.com/world/us-jet-downs-iran-drone-but-talks-still-on-course-1934817","image":"https://www.deccanchronicle.com/h-upload/2026/02/04/2006452-aa-64130321.webp","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-02-04 01:13:07","author":"AFP","authors":["AFP"],"language":"en","source_country":"in","sentiment":-0.064},{"id":399133568,"title":"Trump signs bill to end partial government shutdown","text":"WASHINGTON — President Donald Trump signed a roughly $1.2 trillion government funding bill Tuesday that ends the partial federal shutdown that began over the weekend and sets the stage for an intense debate in Congress over Homeland Security funding.\n\nThe president moved quickly to sign the bill after the House approved it with a 217-214 vote.\n\n“This bill is a great victory for the American people,” Trump said.\n\nThe vote Tuesday wrapped up congressional work on 11 annual appropriations bills that fund government agencies and programs through Sept. 30.\n\nPassage of the legislation marked the end point for one funding fight, but the start of another. That’s because the package only funds the Department of Homeland Security for two weeks, through Feb 13, at the behest of Democrats who are demanding more restrictions on immigration enforcement after the shooting deaths of Alex Pretti and Renee Good by federal officers in Minneapolis.\n\nLeaders are digging in for a fight\n\nDifficult negotiations are ahead, particularly for the agency that enforces the nation’s immigration laws — U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, or ICE.\n\nHouse Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries quickly warned Democrats would not support any further temporary funding for Homeland Security without substantial changes to its immigration operations, raising the potential of another shutdown for the department and its agencies.\n\n“We need dramatic change in order to make sure that ICE and other agencies within the department of Homeland Security are conducting themselves like every other law enforcement organization in the country,” Jeffries said.\n\nSpeaker Mike Johnson said he expects the two sides will be able to reach an agreement by the deadline.\n\n“This is no time to play games with that funding. We hope that they will operate in good faith over the next 10 days as we negotiate this,” said Johnson. “The president, again, has reached out.”\n\nBut Johnson’s counterpart across the Capitol, Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., sounded less optimistic of a deal. “There’s always miracles, right?” Thune told reporters.\n\nVoting with no margin for error\n\nThe funding bill that cleared Congress Tuesday had provisions that appealed to both parties.\n\nRepublicans avoided a massive, catchall funding bill known as an omnibus as part of this year’s appropriations process. Such bills, often taken up before the holiday season with lawmakers anxious to return home, have contributed to greater federal spending, they say.\n\nDemocrats were able to fend off some of Trump’s most draconian proposed cuts while adding language that helps ensure funds are spent as stipulated by Congress.\n\nStill, Johnson needed near-unanimous support from his Republican conference to proceed to a final vote on the bill. He narrowly got it during a roll call that was held open for nearly an hour as leaders worked to gain support from a handful of GOP lawmakers who were trying to advance other priorities unrelated to the funding measure.\n\nThe final vote wasn’t much easier for GOP leaders. In the end, 21 Republicans sided with the vast majority of Democrats in voting against the funding bill, while that exact same number of Democrats sided with the vast majority of Republicans in voting yes.\n\nTrump had weighed in Monday in a social media post, calling on Republicans to stay united and telling holdouts, “There can be NO CHANGES at this time.”\n\nKey differences from the last shutdown\n\nThe current partial shutdown that is coming to a close differed in many ways from the fall impasse, which affected more agencies and lasted a record 43 days.\n\nThen, the debate was over extending temporary coronavirus pandemic-era subsidies for those who get health coverage through the Affordable Care Act. Democrats were unsuccessful in getting those subsidies included as part of a package to end the shutdown.\n\nCongress made important progress since then. Some of the six appropriations bills it passed prior to Tuesday ensured the current shutdown had less sting. For example, important programs such as nutrition assistance and fully operating national parks and historic sites were already funded through Sept. 30.\n\nThe remaining bills passed Tuesday mean that the vast majority of the federal government has been funded.\n\n“You might say that now that 96% of the government is funded, it’s just 4% what’s out there?” Johnson said. ”But it’s a very important 4%”\n\nBy KEVIN FREKING Associated Press AP video journalist Nathan Ellgren and writers Lisa Mascaro, Joey Cappelletti and Mary Clare Jalonick contributed to this report.","url":"https://www.dallasnews.com/news/politics/2026/02/03/trump-signs-bill-to-end-partial-government-shutdown-setting-stage-for-next-fight/","image":"https://dmn-dallas-news-prod.cdn.arcpublishing.com/resizer/v2/SIQ7AQVS3BAPNHVNQ6I2UWVDA4.jpg?auth=dc14fee5b2e97ea31be35cd5e41877a0f7fb3ece02e5f5f26c1dc3e453fd6414&quality=80&width=1200&height=630&smart=true","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-02-04 01:13:01","author":"The Associated Press","authors":["The Associated Press"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.348},{"id":399133942,"title":"From Bajaj Finance, Aditya Birla Capital to DLF – Here are 9 stocks to watch today","text":"All eyes are on Dalal Street after markets surged sharply in the previous session following the cut in tariff on India by US.

Further losses, he said, could rapidly strain the balance sheets of major holders, force selling across the crypto ecosystem and trigger widespread value destruction.“Sickening scenarios have now come within reach,” wrote Burry, who rose to prominence for his prescient bet against the US housing market ahead of the 2008 financial crisis. Should Bitcoin fall another 10%, Strategy Inc., the world's largest corporate crypto treasury, would be billions in the red and “find capital markets essentially closed.” Burry's comments come as Bitcoin dropped below $73,000 Tuesday to its lowest since President Donald Trump retook the White House a little more than a year ago. Analysts have offered a range of explanations for the slump, from fading inflows to deteriorating liquidity and a broader loss of macro appeal. A number of crypto-native traders are also cooling on the token economy, gravitating toward event betting as prediction markets take off. Bitcoin has failed to respond to typical drivers like dollar weakness or geopolitical risk, unlike gold and silver, which rallied to records as global tensions fueled fears about dollar debasement. “There is no organic use case reason for Bitcoin to slow or stop its descent,” Burry wrote.The token's adoption by corporate treasuries and new crypto-linked spot exchange-traded funds is not enough to buoy its price indefinitely, or prevent devastating consequences if it falls dramatically, he said. Nearly 200 public companies hold Bitcoin, he noted. While that's helped broaden demand, “there is nothing permanent about treasury assets,” he wrote.Treasury assets must be marked to market and included in financial reporting. If Bitcoin's price continues to fall, risk managers will start advising their companies to sell, Burry warned. He added that the advent of spot ETFs has only inflamed Bitcoin's speculative nature, while also increasing the token's correlation with stock markets. Bitcoin's correlation with the S&P 500 has lately approached 0.50, he wrote. Theoretically, liquidations will kick in aggressively when loss positions start to grow. Burry added that Bitcoin ETFs have been notching some of their biggest single-day outflows since late November, with three of them occurring in the last 10 days of January. Still, while Burry warns of fallout, crypto's footprint remains too small to trigger broad contagion. Bitcoin's sub-$1.5 trillion market value, limited household exposure, and narrow corporate uptake suggest any wealth effect is likely to stay contained.By some measures, the digital-asset treasury bubble has already burst. Retail leverage has dried up, and past collapses — from Terra to FTX — failed to infect traditional markets. Bulls now point to regulatory clarity and cheap valuation as fuel for another snapback.But as Bitcoin continues to drop below certain key levels, Burry sees it contaminating broader markets. He cited the fall in the cryptocurrency as partly to blame for the recent collapse in gold and silver as corporate treasurers and speculators needed to de-risk by selling profitable positions in tokenised gold and silver futures. These tokenised metal futures are not backed by actual physical metals and can overwhelm trading in physical metals, causing “a collateral death spiral,” he said. “It looks like up to $1 billion in precious metals were liquidated at the month's very end as a result of falling crypto prices,” Burry wrote. If Bitcoin were to fall to $50,000, miners would go bankrupt, while “tokenised metals futures would collapse into a black hole with no buyer,” he said.&nbsp","url":"https://www.ndtvprofit.com/world/michael-burry-warns-of-cascading-effects-from-bitcoin-plunge-10942146","image":"https://c.ndtvimg.com/2026-02/2sc4962k_xxx_625x300_04_February_26.jpg?im=FitAndFill,algorithm=dnn,width=1080,height=607","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-02-04 01:10:49","author":null,"language":"en","source_country":"in","sentiment":-0.022},{"id":399133628,"title":"Federal Reserve governor Miran steps down from White House post","text":"WASHINGTON (AP) — Federal Reserve governor Stephen Miran has stepped down from his position as chair of the White House’s Council of Economic Advisers, ending a controversial arrangement where he held positions at both institutions. \n\nHis resignation was confirmed by White House spokesman Kush Desai late Tuesday. \n\nPresident Donald Trump appointed Miran in September to a seat on the Fed’s seven-member board of governors after Adriana Kugler, who was appointed by President Joe Biden, abruptly resigned. Miran completed her term, which ended Jan. 31. Yet he can remain on the Fed’s board until a replacement is confirmed by the Senate. \n\nIt is unusual for someone to keep a White House position while also serving as a Fed governor, a nonpartisan position. Previous presidents have appointed aides to the Fed, but for decades they gave up their White House positions before joining the Fed. Miran took an unpaid leave of absence instead. \n\nMiran said when he was named in September that he would step down from his position at the CEA if he remained on the Fed board after Jan. 31. Fed governors vote on interest rate decisions and bank regulatory policy. \n\n“In accordance with the pledge he made to the Senate during his confirmation to the Federal Reserve’s Board of Governors, Stephen Miran has submitted his resignation from the Council of Economic Advisers,” Desai said. \n\nThe move underscores the intrigue around the Fed and its upcoming personnel changes. Trump has nominated Kevin Warsh, a former Fed official, to replace current Fed chair Jerome Powell, whose term atop the central bank ends May 15. \n\nYet Powell could, under a quirk in the Fed’s structure, remain on the board after his term as chair ends and deny Trump the opportunity to fill another seat. Many observers, as result, expect Warsh to take Miran’s seat and then be elevated to replace Powell in May, but that sequence of events hasn’t yet been confirmed.","url":"https://apnews.com/article/federal-reserve-miran-trump-94ab5f9ec2af0540b0a85b2a5ff2b713","image":"https://dims.apnews.com/dims4/default/5c77a3a/2147483647/strip/false/crop/2345x1563+0+0/resize/980x653!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fassets.apnews.com%2Fe4%2Ff4%2F99f1376b2cae34d369bfe73cfc0b%2F0b70366955824655a034583d042bae1d","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-02-04 01:08:39","author":"Christopher Rugaber,Will Weissert","authors":["Christopher Rugaber","Will Weissert"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.157},{"id":399134748,"title":"Want CEC to be impeached: Mamata says will discuss it with Opp parties","text":"Want CEC to be impeached: Mamata says will discuss it with Opp parties India \n 2 hr ago\n\n This is an AI assisted summary.\n\n TMC considers impeachment motion against CEC Gyanesh Kumar after meeting with Mamata Banerjee.

Email tips@dailymail.co.uk \nBy ALEX DOYLE - SENIOR SHOWBUSINESS REPORTER \n Published:00:01 GMT, 4 February 2026 |Updated:01:07 GMT, 4 February 2026 \n\nClaire Foy has revealed she gave up caffeine after discovering she had a parasite in her body for five years.\nThe British actress, 41, said she suspected something was wrong when she continued to lose weight.\nShe said she 'didn't know what was going on' so sought medical attention, where she was told she had a parasite in her system.\nAppearing on the latest episode of Table Manners with Jessie and Lennie Ware, Claire revealed she picked up the parasite whilst in Morocco.\nShe explained: 'At least five years. And they travel as a pair. I got told by the doctor, gross, absolutely rank. It's disgusting anyway.\n'So that's why I gave up caffeine. Because I had to give it up. I basically had to go on this diet, and because I didn't want to take, like, really hardcore antibiotics and stuff like that, I took all this little gross stuff, and part of that was giving up caffeine.'\n\nClaire Foy has revealed she gave up caffeine after discovering she had a parasite in her body for five years\n\nAppearing on the latest episode of Table Manners with Jessie and Lennie Ware, Claire revealed she picked up the parasite whilst in Morocco\nClaire also revealed she has given up gluten and sugar, owing to an autoimmune condition which results in inflammation.\nShe said: 'This is my big secret, I feel like I'm in The Traitors or something, and I'm letting everyone know that I'm related to someone!\n'So I don't actually eat gluten or sugar [..] except when I go out for dinner. It doesn't have an impact on me.\n'It's just because I have an autoimmune condition, so I should avoid anything which causes more inflammation.'\nClaire's latest comments come after she admitted she 'contemplated death' in a morbid conversation whilst discussing her multiple medical conditions as a child. \nThe Stockport born native - who will celebrate her 42nd birthday in April - was raised in mid-counties Buckinghamshire with two younger siblings before leaving to study film and drama at Liverpool John Moores University.\nBut her childhood was blighted by a series of unforeseen issues, including a benign tumour behind one eye and juvenile arthritis that left her unable to walk without the aid of crutches when she was just 13.\nAnd Claire concedes her spate of illnesses led to an unhealthy preoccupation with her own mortality, to the point where she believed her life would end before she reached middle age. \n\nClaire's latest comments come after she admitted she 'contemplated death' in a morbid conversation whilst discussing her multiple medical conditions as a child\n\n Claire Foy says she 'didn't think she'd live past 40' after suffering medical issues as a child \nShe told Sunday Times Culture last month: 'Death? The fact we're all on our way out? It's something we just don't want to think about while we're alive. But I have thought about death my whole life.\n'I just presumed that it was going to happen, especially through my childhood... my thing was that I was never going to make it past 40 ? ever. I have had many medical things in my life.\n'But, yes, I'm still here and someone once told me, \"You know, most people live?\" They meant most people live quite a long and lovely life. Well, not necessarily lovely. But people do tend to live.\n'That's what humans want to do. We want to survive, and that's quite reassuring.'\nClaire suffered 'horrible, debilitating' pain as a consequence of juvenile arthritis, which typically affects children under the age of 16, and she believes the condition helped give her positive outlook as she grew into adulthood. \nThe star will appear alongside Andrew Garfield in The Magic Faraway Tree, a special effects filled fantasy adventure based on author Enid Blyton's popular book series of the same name.\nIt is set to be released on March 26 in cinemas across the UK. \n\nShare or comment on this article: \nClaire Foy, 41, reveals she gave up caffeine after discovering she had a parasite in her body for FIVE years\n\nAdd comment\n\n Share what you think\n\nWorst rated\n\nThe comments below have not been moderated.\n\nThe views expressed in the contents above are those of our users and do not necessarily reflect the views of MailOnline.\n\nAdd your comment\n\nEnter your comment\n\nBy posting your comment you agree to our house rules.\n\nSubmit Comment\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual.\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual\n\nWe will automatically post your comment and a link to the news story to your Facebook timeline at the same time it is posted on MailOnline.

I didn't know him at all, and we got along very well,” Trump said at the White House hours after the meeting ended.\nThe US president said both sides were now “working on” cooperation to combat drug trafficking and were also discussing the possibility of lifting US sanctions imposed on Colombia.\nConcerns in Bogotá that Petro might face one of Trump’s confrontational Oval Office showdowns were eased when reporters were excluded from the talks. Instead, Petro’s office released photographs showing a relaxed atmosphere.\n“You are great,” Trump wrote to Petro while signing a copy of his 1987 book Art of the Deal, according to images shared by the Colombian president’s office.\nDespite their ideological differences, Petro returned the praise. “The truth is I like straightforward Americans, people who say what they feel. We’re different, undoubtedly, by a lot. But frankness comes first,” he said.\nPhotographs showed the two leaders seated in gold chairs in the Oval Office alongside US Vice President JD Vance, Secretary of State Marco Rubio, and senior Colombian officials. They were also pictured exchanging a warm handshake in the West Wing colonnade.\nPetro said Trump had agreed to mediate Colombia’s escalating trade dispute with Ecuador, after the two neighbours imposed 30 percent tariffs on each other over disagreements linked to drug trafficking.\nFrom frosty rhetoric to softer reset\nThe warmer mood in Washington stood in stark contrast to the bad blood that had defined ties between the two leaders, ideological opposites who had spent months trading sharp words.\nPetro had earlier defended Venezuela’s Nicolas Maduro and slammed US air strikes on suspected drug trafficking boats, while Trump repeatedly urged Colombia to step up its crackdown on drugs.\nThe tone began to shift after an unexpectedly friendly phone call on January 7. “I mean, he's been very nice over the last month or two,” Trump said ahead of the visit, hinting at a quiet reset.\nPetro echoed that sentiment on X, saying he was “determined to continue strengthening the relationship between two nations that share a common goal: the fight against drug trafficking,” while stressing an approach that “prioritizes life and peace in our territories.”","url":"https://www.firstpost.com/world/petro-calls-trump-meeting-positive-as-us-weighs-lifting-sanctions-13975867.html","image":"https://images.firstpost.com/uploads/2026/02/AFP__20260203__94Z7763__v1__HighRes__UsColombiaDiplomacyTrumpPetro-2026-02-32552f4e2534c3cfabf32537feadfd31-1200x675.jpg?im=FitAndFill=(1200,675)","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-02-04 01:07:15","author":null,"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"in","sentiment":0.239},{"id":399129902,"title":"RFK Jr. Announces $100 Million Program Aimed At Homelessness And Addiction","text":"Authored by Zachary Stieber via The Epoch Times (emphasis ours),\n\nHealth Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. on Feb. 2 announced a new $100 million program that he said will help homeless people find jobs and treat drug abuse.\n\nThe $100 million investment is aimed at assisting homeless people and drug users in recovering from addiction, finding employment, and locating stable housing.\n\nKennedy told an event on Prevention Day—which is sponsored by the government and dedicated to preventing drug abuse—in Washington on Monday that the health care system under the previous administration was designed to cycle people who suffer from mental illness and drug addiction “between sidewalks, emergency room visits, jails, mental hospitals, and shelters.”\n\n“No one took responsibility for the whole person. No one stayed long enough to help them recover, to help them reestablish their links, and teach them the lessons of how to live in a community,” he said. “That system is neither humane nor effective.”\n\nKennedy, who has said his addiction to heroin ended with help from 12-step programs, said that the $100 million would fund pilot initiatives that are crafted to resolve long-term homelessness and reduce opioid addiction by expanding treatment regimens that emphasize recovery and self-sufficiency. The program is known as Safety Through Recovery, Engagement, and Evidence-based Treatment and Supports, or STREETS.\n\n“STREETS will engage people continuously, from first contact on the street through recovery, through employment, and through self-sufficiency,” Kennedy said. “Law enforcement, first responders, courts, housing providers, and health care systems will work as one team, so people will no longer fall through the cracks.”\n\nSTREETS follows an executive order President Donald Trump signed in January that says drug addiction is a chronic disease and that the administration needs to prioritize addiction treatment and recovery.\n\nThe new program builds on an investment federal health officials awarded in 2025 to boost homes for recovering addicts. Kennedy says he knows many people who have recovered in such homes.\n\nKennedy also announced the government will be providing $10 million through an assisted outpatient program to help adults designated as having serious mental illness, which he said will reduce hospitalization, incarceration, and homelessness.\n\nOfficials also said that the Department of Health and Human Services will, moving forward, let states use federal funding to pay for addicted parents to receive Food and Drug Administration-approved medications.\n\nAnd they said that they would be giving faith-based organizations that meet certain standards funding to help with drug addiction recovery.\n\n“This is a chronic disease. It’s a physical disease, it’s a mental disease, it’s emotional disease, but above all, it’s a spiritual disease,“ Kennedy said. ”And we need to recognize that, and faith-based organizations play a critical role in ... helping people reestablish their connections to community.”","url":"https://www.zerohedge.com/political/rfk-jr-announces-100-million-program-aimed-homelessness-and-addiction","image":"/s3/files/styles/16_9_max_700/public/2026-02/bubblesthewire_80.jpg?h=df3c6bf4&amp;itok=5Gu6J5yB","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-02-04 01:05:00","author":"Tyler Durden","authors":["Tyler Durden"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.044},{"id":399131818,"title":"Walmart becomes first retailer to hit $1tn market value","text":"Walmart has become the first traditional retailer to hit a $1tn (730bn) market valuation, propelling it into a small group dominated by tech firms.\n\nThe milestone reflects the US retail giant’s booming e-commerce business and its success in drawing in price-conscious shoppers. Wall Street has also responded enthusiastically to its investments in artificial intelligence (AI).\n\nWalmart joins an elite club of mostly tech firms, including Nvidia and Alphabet, with valuations over $1tn.\n\nThe company’s share price, which has soared in recent months, rose by more than 3% on Tuesday.\n\nWalmart is the biggest brick-and-mortar retailer in the US and is known for its low prices. It has benefited from a trend of higher earners trading down to lower-priced items, as the jobs market cools and inflation persists. Its speedy home-delivery offering has also attracted shoppers across income brackets.\n\nIt reported strong sales across key sectors in its November earnings update, including grocery and clothing.\n\n“Walmart is better insulated than just about anybody given the value proposition we have,” John David Rainey, Walmart’s chief financial officer, said at the time.\n\nWalmart executives have said the effects of US President Donald Trump’s tariffs have been more muted than initially expected. While tariffs have raised prices for items like electronics and toys, the retailer’s scale has allowed it to weather the import taxes better than some rivals.\n\nWalmart’s online business has helped it emerge as a competitor to Amazon. E-commerce sales in the US jumped 28% in the three months to 31 October, propelled by online orders and advertising.\n\nStill, Amazon’s market value currently stands at $2.6tn – more than double Walmart’s.\n\nWall Street investors have embraced Walmart’s adoption of AI, helping push the company’s valuation to new highs.\n\nThe firm reached the $1tn milestone during chief executive John Furner’s first week at the helm of the company. Furner has been a vocal backer of its AI investments.\n\nIn October, the company announced a partnership with OpenAI, which it said “allows customers and Sam’s Club members to plan meals, restock essentials, or discover new products simply by chatting”.\n\nWalmart’s decision late last year to move its stock from the New York Stock Exchange to the tech-heavy Nasdaq reinforced the retailer’s push to be seen as a digital company.\n\nWalmart is the first traditional retailer to join the $1tn market capitalisation club. The group is still dominated by tech giants, though investment firm Berkshire Hathaway reached the milestone in 2024.\n\nDrug-maker Eli Lilly also surpassed $1tn late last year before falling back below the threshold.\n\nDISCLAIMER: The Views, Comments, Opinions, Contributions and Statements made by Readers and Contributors on this platform do not necessarily represent the views or policy of Multimedia Group Limited.\n\nDISCLAIMER: The Views, Comments, Opinions, Contributions and Statements made by Readers and Contributors on this platform do not necessarily represent the views or policy of Multimedia Group Limited.","summary":"Walmart has become the first traditional retailer to hit a $1tn (730bn) market valuation, propelling it into a small group dominated by tech firms.

Email: tips@dailymail.co.uk\nBy CAROLINE PEACOCK, SHOWBUSINESS REPORTER \n Published:00:52 GMT, 4 February 2026 |Updated:01:00 GMT, 4 February 2026 \n\nOnce the epitome of London's glamorous reality TV scene, Millie Mackintosh and Hugo Taylor were known for their late-night parties and high-profile romance on Made in Chelsea.\nTheir chemistry was undeniable, but so was their drama, breakups, and reconciliations.\nFast forward to today, Millie, 36, and Hugo, 39, could not live a more different life. \nMarried in 2018 and now parents to two young daughters, Sienna, five, and Aurelia, four, the pair have traded in their party-hard lifestyles for family life.\nYet, after seven years of marriage, the couple have quietly separated following a difficult start to the year, marking the end of a chapter. \nHere's a look at how Millie and Hugo went from reality TV rebels into devoted parents navigating life in the spotlight.\n\nMillie Mackintosh and Hugo Taylor could not live a more different life to the one that saw them fall in Love on Made In Chelsea (pictured on the E4 show)\n\nMarried in 2018 and now parents to two young daughters, Sienna, five, and Aurelia, four, the pair have traded in their party-hard lifestyles for family life and sobriety \n\nMillie and Hugo first began dating on Made in Chelsea in 2010, where viewers were hooked on their relationship.\nThey lived life in the fast lane, often heading to glamorous events together and enjoying late nights out.\nOn the reality show, the pair looked like a match made in heaven.\nBut after six months of dating, their relationship hit a wall when Millie accused Hugo of cheating with her best friend and co-star, Rosie Fortescue.\nThis all came out in an iconic MIC scene, which saw Millie propose a toast to the couple in front of a room full of partygoers in 1920s garb.\nShe said: 'This second... a second toast to my best friend Rosie Fortescue, for hooking up with Hugo Taylor while we were together and lying about it. Here's to friendship... You're disgusting.' \nHowever, it turned out that Millie had cheated on him beforehand during a trip to Ibiza. \nThe couple split in 2011, and it wasn't long before the Quality Street heiress found love elsewhere. \n\nMillie and Hugo first began dating on Made in Chelsea in 2010, where viewers were hooked on their relationship\n\nThey lived life in the fast lane, often heading to glamorous events together and enjoying late nights out\nAt the time, Millie claimed she would always love Hugo, saying in an interview: 'I loved him - those feelings don't disappear – but I just always have to remind myself why we're not together.'\n\n'I do think that, for the rest of my life, every time I see him, I'll get that feeling in my stomach. I don't think I could ever not get that butterfly feeling.'\nMillie then had a very high-profile relationship with rapper Professor Green, also known as Stephen Manderson.\nAfter seeing her on the cover of lad mag FHM, he made it his mission to get in touch with her.\nThey made their first public appearance as a couple at the 2012 BRIT Awards, and then the rapper proposed during a holiday in France just over a year later. \nAt this time, Millie quit Made in Chelsea to focus on her relationship and pursue other acting careers. \nWhen asked why she decided to leave MIC on Jamie Laing's Private Parts podcast, Millie revealed: 'I'd started a relationship with somebody that wasn't going to be in the show. \n'Then I felt like… and because they couldn't film that side of my life… and because Caggie had left, who was like my best friend on the show.\n\nBut after six months of dating, their relationship hit a wall when Millie accused Hugo of cheating with her best friend and co-star, Rosie Fortescue\n\nThis all came out in an iconic MIC scene, which saw Millie propose a toast to the couple in front of a room full of partygoers in 1920s garb\n\n'I felt like what I was being asked to film were things that weren't that genuine to me. I felt like I didn't have a storyline for them to follow. \n'I didn't want to be in there just creating drama for other people. I always said I would leave when it wasn't fun anymore and wasn't authentic. That's why I left.'\nMeanwhile, Hugo also left the show around the same time because he felt like he had outgrown it.\nHe told The Standard: 'Originally the producers only wanted me as a peripheral character and that's all I wanted to contribute.\n'I could wind up having absolutely everything or I could end up with nothing. But I've become lazy and comfortable on the show.' \nMillie and Professor Green tied the knot in a lavish ceremony at Babington House in Somerset in 2014.\nHowever, rumours began to swirl that they were heading for a divorce after a series of blazing rows in public. \nDespite them revealing they were in marriage counselling at the time, they went on to announce their separation after 30 months of marriage in February 2016.\n\nMillie then had a very high-profile relationship with rapper Professor Green, also known as Stephen Manderson\n\nThey went on to announce their separation after 30 months of marriage in February 2016\nThey released a joint statement which read: 'It is with sadness and regret that we confirm our separation.'\n'It is a mutual decision, we still care deeply about each other and would like it to be known it is on amicable terms and we wish each other well.'\nMillie previously kept quiet about her tumultuous chapter with the rapper, but has finally given an insight into what really went down.\n'I think we both were in our own struggles, and I think we maybe both thought we could fix each other. But we couldn't. And ultimately, we both had our own struggles, and it just magnified it. And it was actually quite toxic,' she told Brogan Garritt-Smith in a 2025 episode of her Getting There podcast.\nMeanwhile, Hugo was in a relationship with Natalie Joel before they split in 2015.\nMillie and Hugo then rekindled their romance just weeks after her divorce from Professor Green was finalised.\nAt the time, the reality star received backlash for how quickly she was linked with her cheating ex.\nMillie and Hugo sparked speculation that they were back together after posting several photos of the couple together on Instagram, including a snap of them kissing during the latter's 30th birthday weekend.\n\nMillie and Hugo sparked speculation that they were back together after posting several photos of the couple together on Instagram, including a snap of them kissing during the latter's 30th birthday weekend\n\nAfter reuniting, split rumours were circling in 2017, but the pair proved they were happier than ever by moving in together\nAfter reuniting, split rumours were circling in 2017, but the pair proved they were happier than ever by moving in together.\nHugo proposed to Millie during a romantic trip to Mykonos, Greece, that year. \nHer vintage flower halo engagement ring was a unique design that caught the eye. \nSpeaking to the Daily Mail, Queensmith Master Jewellers valued Millie's ring at £30,000-£40,000.\nThey went on to say 'I do' at an official legal ceremony at Chelsea Town Hall in June 2018.\nThis was followed by a huge bash at Whithurst Park estate in West Sussex, which is owned by Hugo's uncle, and was attended by their reality TV co-stars. \nRosie, whom Millie previously accused Hugo of cheating on her with, was one of the bridesmaids.\nTo celebrate their first year of marriage, Hugo wrote Millie a love letter, which she framed and later shared on Instagram.

Convened by US Secretary of State Marco Rubio, the summit will bring together more than 50 global partners to strengthen and diversify supply chains for critical minerals such as lithium and rare earths.\nDiscussions will centre on supply-chain resilience, clean energy transitions and reducing global dependence on China. US Ambassador Sergio Gor recently announced India’s induction into Pax Silica, a US-led initiative focused on artificial intelligence and supply-chain security, further solidifying cooperation between the two countries in the critical minerals sector.\nEarlier, Jaishankar held a private meeting with Secretary Rubio to discuss a potential trade deal, defence cooperation and nuclear energy. The visit follows a phone call between Prime Minister Narendra Modi and President Donald Trump, during which India reportedly agreed to abstain from purchasing Russian oil and move towards US energy products to help facilitate regional stability.\nTrilateral Ukraine talks to resume in Abu Dhabi\nThe second round of trilateral security talks involving Ukraine, Russia and the United States is set to resume in Abu Dhabi today. Originally planned for early February, the meeting was briefly delayed to coordinate the schedules of the three delegations.\nThe Ukrainian team is led by National Security and Defence Council Secretary Rustem Umerov, while the Russian delegation is expected to be headed by Admiral Igor Kostyukov. The United States is being represented by Special Envoy Steve Witkoff.\nAccording to reports, the negotiations are likely to focus on regional security, conflict de-escalation and the possibility of an energy ceasefire.\nRyan Routh to be sentenced\nRyan Wesley Routh, who attempted to assassinate then-presidential candidate Donald Trump in September 2024, is scheduled to be sentenced in a federal court in Florida today.\nFollowing a trial in which he initially represented himself, a federal jury found Routh guilty on all five counts in September 2025. His convictions include attempted assassination of a major presidential candidate, assault on a federal officer and multiple firearms-related offences.\nRyan W Routh poses in a jail booking photograph in Greensboro, North Carolina, US. File image/Reuters\nFederal prosecutors from the Department of Justice are seeking the maximum penalty of life imprisonment, arguing that Routh’s actions involved “careful plotting” and “premeditation”. They have also cited his lack of remorse since the conviction.\nFed governor Lisa Cook to give speech\nFederal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook is scheduled to deliver a significant policy speech today, as global markets closely watch signals from US policymakers.\nCook is expected to address the “uncertain economic outlook” created by recent shifts in global trade and potential inflationary pressures linked to new tariff policies.\nFederal Reserve Board of Governors member Lisa Cook.

Musk had accused the agency of selective enforcement and challenged the case as an affront to his constitutional free-speech rights, among other arguments.“A straightforward application of the law reveals that none of these arguments warrant dismissal of this lawsuit,” US District Judge Sparkle Sooknanan wrote in an order Tuesday in Washington.The SEC sued Musk in January 2025, less than a week before President Donald Trump took office. The regulator claimed the billionaire in 2022 amassed shares in Twitter and failed to disclose on time how much his stockpile grew. He later purchased Twitter for $44 billion, took it private and renamed it X.By waiting too long to reveal his growing stake, Musk was able to buy up shares cheaply, ultimately costing Twitter shareholders more than $150 million, the SEC said. Musk's attorneys in August sought to dismiss the suit, calling it a “waste of this court's time and taxpayer resources.” The SEC in response urged Sooknanan to find Musk liable without a trial, saying there is “absolutely no dispute” that he missed the disclosure deadline. “The court does not doubt that Mr. Musk would prefer to avoid having to disclose information that might raise stock prices while he makes a play for corporate control,” Sooknanan wrote. “But the balance Congress struck in Section 13(d) does not violate the First Amendment.”The case is Securities and Exchange Commission v.

While this is undoubtedly positive for the Indian economy, the consequences are not exactly straightforward. First things first: the reduction in the tariff to 18%, which comes into force immediately, means the effective US import duty on Indian products could fall to anywhere between 12% and 16% from 35-36%, according to economists. The effective tariff rate is lower than the headline number of 18% because of the concessions the US has made on electronics, pharmaceuticals, and food items such as spice, coffee, and tea and the Section 232 tariffs on products such as steel, aluminum, and automobiles. This, economists say, should provide significant relief to India’s export sector, especially labour-intensive ones such as gems and jewellery, textiles, agricultural products, and engineering goods. Also Read | India–US trade deal reaffirms what had started looking hazy: India’s role as US ally & China counter The above should have several positive consequences. Higher exports to the US should narrow India’s merchandise trade deficit, which had surged to an all-time high of $41.7 billion in October 2025 before cooling down to $25 billion in the final month of 2025. Higher exports, especially from key sectors such as textiles, could mean their job situation should, over a period of time, return to pre-August 2025 levels. The impact on the economy should be meaningful, considering the US is India’s largest destination for merchandise exports, accounting for nearly a fifth of all shipments in value terms. As a result, all economists — including Chief Economic Advisor V Anantha Nageswaran — expect growth forecasts to be revised higher in the coming months. The Economic Survey predicted the GDP growth rate to be in the range of 6.8-7.2% in FY27, down from 7.4% this year. However, an improved growth outlook following the US tariff cut means the case for the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) to further add to its 125 basis points worth of interest rate cuts announced in 2025 has weakened. “The deal now would boost the growth certainty and the current momentum seen in high frequency indicators can continue to sustain. We therefore change our rate cut call of 25 bps to hold for the upcoming February 6 meeting,” BofA Securities economists Rahul Bajoria and Smriti Mehra said in a note on Tuesday, adding that RBI is “now done cutting rates”. The policy repo rate currently stands at 5.25%. Capital flows and the rupee While the impact on India’s growth from the trade deal will take some time to materialise, the boost to market sentiment has already led to tangible results: the stock markets closed over 2% higher on Tuesday — reversing the post-Budget losses due to the hike in the Securities Transaction Tax (STT) — while the rupee strengthened by more than 1% against the US dollar. The cloud of uncertainty cast by the delay in India and the US finalising an agreement has weighed heavily on the rupee’s exchange rate, which crossed the 90- and 91-per-dollar levels in December 2025 and nearly 92 per dollar last week. Now, the only way seems up, at least in the short run, with the rupee closing strongly on Tuesday at 90.27 per dollar. HSBC analysts said on Tuesday that the rupee is now “slightly undervalued” and expect the currency to appreciate further to 88-per-dollar by the end of March. Also Read | US farm exports to India have been surging even with no trade deal But beyond the short run, the outlook for the rupee is a bit unclear. For one, there is still some clarity required over the contours of the US deal. Second, the factors that led to the rupee weakening by around 7% in 2025 haven’t really vanished. As such, Tuesday’s gains are not expected to be “sustained”, Singapore-based Mitul Kotecha, head of FX & EM Macro Strategy Asia at Barclays, said. Foreign Portfolio Investors (FPIs) had pulled out nearly $12 billion from India’s stock markets on a net basis during August 2025-January 2026. According to Kotecha, “hot money flows” such as those of FPIs have become important drivers of the rupee’s exchange rate. “As such, factors such as an unexciting earnings season, relatively high valuations, and re-allocation to more AI-skewed equity markets, have acted as a stumbling block for Indian equities.” Then there is the deal itself. While the details remain elusive, the fact that President Donald Trump has said India will move towards reducing its tariffs and non-tariff barriers against the US “to ZERO” and has committed to over $500 billion of American products across sectors means the situation is not all rosy. “While this is likely to be staggered, it is also likely to add to flow pressure on rupee,” analysts at Japanese brokerage firm Nomura said. Also Read | India-US trade deal may have a $100-bn opportunity for India’s electronics exports. Here’s why For context, India’s imports from the US in 2024-25 amounted to $46 billion. Its total global imports in that year were $721 billion. One deal after another India’s deal with the US comes close on the heels of the one struck with the European Union just last week. This trend, economists point out, bodes well for India’s share in global exports in the medium term. “In 2025, the government concluded/signed trade agreements with Oman, the UK and New Zealand. We believe the US India trade deal and recent FTAs will promote economic growth by reducing tariffs, lower input costs for Indian producers, increase market access, boost export competitiveness, promote a wider export market and encourage FDI. This may further push manufacturing, create jobs and increase India’s exports in the medium term,” UBS Chief India Economist Tanvee Gupta Jain said.","url":"https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-economics/trade-deal-rupee-gdp-interest-rates-10511838/","image":"https://images.indianexpress.com/2026/02/containership.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-02-04 01:00:01","author":"Siddharth Upasani","authors":["Siddharth Upasani"],"language":"en","category":"business","source_country":"in","sentiment":0.055},{"id":399132048,"title":"Melania Trump's body language 'speaks volumes in solo appearances'","text":"Few people face as much scrutiny and analysis as the First Lady of the United States, a fact that's become even more apparent following the release of her self-titled biographical film on Amazon. Yet, according to a psychotherapist and confidence expert, many viewers' interpretations of her behaviour are off the mark. The public has long been fixated on her reserved demeanour, interpreting her often neutral, seemingly cold expression as signs of discomfort, sadness, or disconnection. However, behavioural expert Shelly Dar suggests this could simply be Melania establishing her boundaries in the public eye. \"When we analyse Melania Trump , it can look like she's sad or worried, but what we're really seeing is her restraint,\" Dar clarifies, reports the Mirror US . \"Her public presence is so controlled and so neutral and very deliberate. And as First Lady, that restraint tightens even more because of the pressure and the cost of mistakes is very high.\" Melania Trump's public persona is characterised by limited facial expressions, minimal gestures, and a consistently neutral posture. Dar points out that Melania's restrained facial expressions and minimal gestures often lead to perceptions of her as \"angry, cold, or uncomfortable,\" rather than recognising what she describes as a conscious absence of visible warmth. \"When warmth isn't visible, people project sadness onto it,\" Dar explains. \"Psychologically, her body language doesn't communicate any emotions, it communicates boundaries. She doesn't perform emotions for comfort, something that we're used to in the Western world.\" Dar also points out that, typically, First Ladies in American and Western politics tend to exude a sense of openness and approachability. \"In a culture that expects First Ladies to appear warm, expressive, and at ease, that lack of emotional display is easy to misread,\" Dar elaborates. \"When expression is limited, people tend to fill in the gaps themselves, often projecting anger or unhappiness where there may simply be control. \"She's operating on a global stage, speaks publicly only when she has to, and communicates in a second language where every word is analysed,\" Dar observes. \"That level of scrutiny naturally leads to careful, rehearsed delivery and a more guarded presence.\" Dar interprets Melania's body language as communicating boundaries and precision rather than emotional openness, \"which can feel unsettling to audiences trying to decode her.\" However, when Melania is in close proximity to Donald Trump , Dar notes a distinct shift in her demeanour: \"She appears more composed in solo appearances, where her posture and pacing feel steadier and more intentional. When she's alongside her husband, her body language often tightens, less movement, more neutrality, which can signal role management rather than relational ease. \"She appears more self-possessed alone, and more guarded beside him, which suggests deliberate role separation rather than emotional disengagement.\"","summary":"Behavioural expert Shelly Dar has analysed the First Lady's restrained public demeanour, explaining that what many interpret as sadness or discomfort is actually deliberate boundary-setting","url":"https://www.dailystar.co.uk/news/us-news/melania-trumps-body-language-speaks-36661336","image":"https://i2-prod.dailystar.co.uk/article36661334.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200b/0_GettyImages-2252766054.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-02-04 01:00:00","author":"Maria Leticia Gomes","authors":["Maria Leticia Gomes"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.06},{"id":399128444,"title":"‘Melania’ Serves as a Dainty Middle Finger to Trump’s Media Tormenters","text":"In a big blow to the Trump-deranged community, Melania Trump’s eponymous movie knocked the lights out on its opening weekend. It came in at No. 3 overall, and its $7 million box office take in three days is almost unheard of for a documentary.\n\n“Melania” is crushing it on Rotten Tomatoes, too, with a 99% audience score on the “popcorno-meter” easily besting the sneering critics’ 10% on the Tomatometer ratings.\n\nLike everything to do with Donald Trump’s two presidencies, whatever the leftist media’s opinion, the American public thinks the opposite.

Yet according to a psychotherapist and confidence specialist, most public interpretations of her conduct miss the mark entirely. For years, observers have fixated on her reserved demeanour, frequently interpreting her typically neutral, seemingly aloof expression as evidence of unease, melancholy, or emotional distance. However, behavioural specialist Shelly Dar suggests this may simply represent Melania establishing firm boundaries when in the public eye. \"When we analyse Melania Trump , it can look like she's sad or worried, but what we're really seeing is her restraint,\" Dar explains, reports the Mirror US . \"Her public presence is so controlled and so neutral and very deliberate. And as First Lady, that restraint tightens even more because of the pressure and the cost of mistakes is very high.\" Melania Trump's public persona is characterised by restricted facial expression, sparse gestures, and an unwavering neutral stance. Dar observes that Melania's constrained facial movements and economical gestures typically result in her being perceived as \"angry, cold, or uncomfortable,\" rather than what she characterises as an intentional absence of outward warmth. \"When warmth isn't visible, people project sadness onto it,\" Dar explains. \"Psychologically, her body language doesn't communicate any emotions, it communicates boundaries. She doesn't perform emotions for comfort, something that we're used to in the Western world .\" She further points out how, within American and - more broadly - Western political circles, First Ladies typically project the complete opposite through displays of warmth and accessibility. \"In a culture that expects First Ladies to appear warm, expressive, and at ease, that lack of emotional display is easy to misread,\" Dar clarifies. \"When expression is limited, people tend to fill in the gaps themselves, often projecting anger or unhappiness where there may simply be control. \"She's operating on a global stage, speaks publicly only when she has to, and communicates in a second language where every word is analysed,\" Dar observes. \"That level of scrutiny naturally leads to careful, rehearsed delivery and a more guarded presence.\" Dar suggests Melania's body language conveys boundaries and precision instead of emotional transparency, \"which can feel unsettling to audiences trying to decode her.\" When Melania is in Donald Trump's presence, however, Dar highlights how her demeanour becomes even more restrained: \"She appears more composed in solo appearances, where her posture and pacing feel steadier and more intentional. When she's alongside her husband, her body language often tightens, less movement, more neutrality, which can signal role management rather than relational ease. \"She appears more self-possessed alone, and more guarded beside him, which suggests deliberate role separation rather than emotional disengagement.\"","summary":"Psychotherapist explains how Melania Trump's restrained public demeanour communicates boundaries rather than sadness","url":"https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/us-news/melania-trumps-very-telling-body-36661177","image":"https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/article36661176.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200b/2_GettyImages-2252766054.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-02-04 01:00:00","author":"Maria Leticia Gomes","authors":["Maria Leticia Gomes"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"GB","sentiment":-0.105},{"id":399130938,"title":"Thousands of Venezuelans march to demand Maduro's release","text":"\"Venezuela needs Nicolas,\" chanted the crowd, a month to the day since he was spectacularly toppled and whisked away to stand trial on drug charges in New York.\n\nInterim president Delcy Rodriguez has been walking a tightrope since then -- trying to hold on to support from Washington but also from Maduro acolytes in her government and the Venezuelan people.\n\nSeveral demonstrators, many of them public sector workers, held photos of Maduro and of his wife, Cilia Flores, who was also seized in the US raid.\n\nThe march, called by the government, stretched for several hundred meters, accompanied by trucks blaring music.\n\n\"These people are not American,\" said Maduro's son, Nicolas \"Nicolasito\" Maduro Guerra, a deputy in Venezuela's National Assembly.\n\n\"We have achieved a profound anti-imperialist consciousness.\"\n\nMany protesters waved Venezuelan flags and were dressed in the red colors of the ruling \"Chavista\" movement named after Maduro's socialist predecessor, Hugo Chavez.\n\n\"We feel confused, sad, angry.
