The city's Democratic mayor walked a political tightrope, referring to the takeover as an \"authoritarian push\" at one point and later framing the infusion of officers as boost to public safety, though one with few specific barometers for success. The Republican president has said crime in the city was at emergency levels that only such federal intervention could fix - even as District of Columbia leaders pointed to statistics showing violent crime at a 30-year low after a sharp rise two years ago.

But a significant increase was expected Wednesday at the Guard's armory and troops were expected to start doing more missions in Washington on Thursday, according to a Guard spokesman who spoke on condition of anonymity to describe the planning process. On Wednesday, agents from Homeland Security Investigations patrolled the popular U Street corridor. Drug Enforcement Administration officers were seen on the National Mall, while National Guard members were parked nearby. DEA agents also joined Metropolitan Police Department officers on patrol in the Navy Yard neighborhood. Hundreds of federal law enforcement and city police officers who patrolled the streets Tuesday night made 43 arrests, compared with about two dozen the night before. Live Events D.C. Councilmember Christina Henderson downplayed the arrest reports as \"a bunch of traffic stops\" and said the administration was seeking to disguise how unnecessary this federal intervention is. \"I'm looking at this list of arrests and they sound like a normal Saturday night in any big city,\" said Henderson. Unlike in other U.S. states and cities, the law gives Trump the power to take over Washington's police for up to 30 days. Extending his power over the city for longer would require approval from Congress, and that could be tough in the face of Democratic resistance. Trump suggested that he could seek a longer period of control or decide to call on Congress to exercise authority over city laws his administration sees as lax on crime. \"We're gonna do this very quickly. But we're gonna want extensions. I don't want to call a national emergency. If I have to, I will,\" he said. Later, on his Truth Social site, Trump reiterated his claims about the city, writing, \"D.C. has been under siege from thugs and killers, but now, D.C. is back under Federal Control where it belongs.\" Henderson, who worked for Sen. Chuck Schumer of New York before running for the D.C. Council, said she was already in touch with \"friends on the Hill\" to rally opposition for any Trump extension request. She added, \"It's Day Three and he's already saying he's going to need more time?\" Targeting a variety of infractions The arrests made by 1,450 federal and local officers across the city included those for suspicion of driving under the influence and unlawful entry, as well as a warrant for assault with a deadly weapon, according to the White House. Seven illegal firearms were seized. There have now been more than 100 arrests since Trump began beefing up the federal law enforcement presence in Washington last week, White House spokeswoman Taylor Rogers said. \"President Trump is delivering on his campaign promise to clean up this city and restore American Greatness to our cherished capital,\" she said. The president has full command of the National Guard and has activated up to 800 troops to support law enforcement, though exactly what form remains to be determined. Neither Army nor District of Columbia National Guard officials have been able to describe the training backgrounds of the troops who have so far reported for duty. While some members are military police, others likely hold jobs that would have offered them little training in dealing with civilians or law enforcement. The federalization push also includes clearing out encampments for people who are homeless, Trump has said. U.S. Park Police have removed dozens of tents since March, and plan to take out two more this week, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt has said. People are offered the chance to go to shelters and get addiction treatment, if needed, but those who refuse could be fined or jailed, she said. City officials said they are making more shelter space available and increasing their outreach. Violent crime has dropped in the district The federal effort comes even after a drop in violent crime in the nation's capital, a trend that experts have seen in cities across the U.S. since an increase during the coronavirus pandemic. On average, the level of violence Washington remains mostly higher than averages in three dozen cities analyzed by the nonprofit Council on Criminal Justice, said the group's president and CEO, Adam Gelb. Police Chief Pamela Smith said during an interview with the local Fox affiliate that the city's Metro Police Department has been down nearly 800 officers. She said the increased number of federal agents on the streets would help fill that gap, at least for now. Mayor Muriel Bowser said city officials did not get any specific goals for the surge during a meeting with Trump's attorney general, Pam Bondi, and other top federal law enforcement officials Tuesday. But, she said, \"I think they regard it as a success to have more presence and take more guns off the street, and we do too.\" She had previously called Trump's moves \"unsettling and unprecedented\" while pointing out he was within a president's legal rights regarding the district, which is the seat of American government but is not a state. For some residents, the increased presence of law enforcement and National Guard troops is nerve-racking. \"I've seen them right here at the subway ... they had my street where I live at blocked off yesterday, actually,\" Washington native Sheina Taylor said. \"It's more fearful now because even though you're a law-abiding citizen, here in D.C., you don't know, especially because I'm African American.\" ___ Associated Press writers Konstantin Toropin and Will Weissert, photographer Jacquelyn Martin and video journalist River Zhang contributed to this report.(You can now subscribe to our Economic Times WhatsApp channel)\n\nRead More News onUS Newswhite housetrumptruth socialnational guardhomeland security\n\n(Catch all the Business News, Breaking News, Budget 2025 Events and Latest News Updates on The Economic Times.)

It said it was also making progress in streamlining the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act (HSR) review process of mergers and reinstating more frequent use of targeted and well-crafted consent decrees. Biden signed a sweeping executive order in July 2021 to promote more competition in the U.S. economy as part of a broad push to rein in what his administration described as a pattern of corporate abuses, ranging from excessive airline fees to large mergers that raised costs for consumers.Live Events The initiative, which was very popular with Americans, was championed by top Biden economic officials, many of whom had previously worked for or with Senator Elizabeth Warren, who played a key role in creating the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau under former President Barack Obama. Trump has attacked that agency since taking office, announcing plans to shrink its workforce by 90%. Those moves have cost Americans at least $18 billion in higher fees and lost compensation for consumers allegedly cheated by major companies, according to an analysis released in June by the Student Borrower Protection Center and the Consumer Federation of America. Hannah Garden-Monheit, who was the director of competition policy under Biden, said Trump's move undercuts his promise to protect the Americans who need it the most. \"This shows President Trump's claim he would 'Make America Competitive Again' was a sham. Instead of enforcing the competition laws, he's throwing Main Street businesses and workers under the bus while doing favors for the rich and powerful,\" Garden-Monheit said.

The Social Security Act was signed into law by President Franklin D. Roosevelt in 1935, during the Great Depression. The bill was aimed at creating a federal safety net to help Americans with unemployment, illness, disability, death and old-age. The president's Thursday proclamation, obtained and reviewed in advance by Fox News Digital, proclaimed the Act as \"a monumental legislative achievement.\" SOCIAL SECURITY ADMINISTRATION PHISHING SCAM TARGETS RETIREES \"To this day, Social Security is rooted in a simple promise: those who gave their careers to building our Nation will always have the support, stability, and relief they deserve,\" the proclamation states. \"Thanks to my Administration’s efforts, Social Security now stands stronger and more resilient than ever before.\" During Trump's second term, Democrats have slammed his approach to helping improve the program, arguing cuts to the Social Security Administration's workforce and provisions in the Republican's One Big Beautiful Bill Act will negatively impact the critical program. However, the administration is fighting back at those notions, pointing to technological improvements, lower customer service wait times, and disability claim backlogs that have been cleared. \"While Democrats flail and peddle lies about Social Security, President Trump is demonstrating his unbreakable commitment to protecting and strengthening this vital program for the nearly 72 million Americans who benefit from it,\" White House spokesperson Liz Huston said. \"By massively improving the customer service experience through technological improvements, preventing illegal aliens from accessing benefits, and delivering no taxes on Social Security through the One Big Beautiful Bill – President Trump has Made Social Security Great Again.\" Trump's critics have suggested he is damaging the program, but according to the administration, things have drastically improved. A source in the administration told Fox News Digital that the administration completed over 3.1 million payments ahead of schedule thus far, totaling $17 billion, to eligible beneficiaries. Additionally, the wait time for social security's service delivery has been dramatically reduced under Trump, with the average telephone response time reduced from 30-minutes last year, to six minutes as it stands currently. That amounts to an 80% reduction in wait times.

And he alone has the diplomatic leverage necessary to force an end to the war in Ukraine.\n\nThere are many on the Left who will decry him for doing it, who will condemn any peace settlement simply because it is Trump who brings it about. To them, everything Trump does is abhorrent, and that includes stopping wars.\n\nBut the wider world, which has felt itself on the brink of global conflagration in the past few months, should feel profoundly grateful to the US president.\n\nIn his second term at the White House, he is proving the most effective American leader since Ronald Reagan ended the Cold War and set in train the collapse of the Soviet Union.\n\nTrump is to meet Putin for talks in Alaska on Friday – I write from Anchorage where history is unfolding before our eyes – and if he can strong-arm the Russian dictator into halting his slow annexation of Ukraine, which has claimed an estimated 350,000 lives with more than million combatants and civilians wounded, he will deserve the world’s gratitude.\n\nEuropean leaders warned on a call with the President yesterday that the ‘territorial integrity’ of Ukraine’s borders must be respected. But empty rhetoric from EU capitals will achieve nothing. Moscow has no regard at all for the European Union.\n\nPutin respects only one thing: strength. And Trump has demonstrated that repeatedly this year, both in military and economic terms.\n\nHis unilateral decision to wipe out Iran’s nuclear programme with a bunker-busting bomb assault in June was a dramatic display of US power. Iran has been defanged, and the planet is safer for it. Moscow took note.\n\nHe has also shown a repeated determination to douse local conflicts. Most significantly, his intervention obliged India and Pakistan to back down from a renewed border dispute in May after military strikes between the two nuclear-armed countries.\n\nHe also stepped in to quell tensions between Serbia and Kosovo.\n\nAnd in June, the foreign ministers of Rwanda and the Democratic Republic of the Congo signed a peace agreement brokered by Trump to end their deadly, nearly 30-year conflict.\n\nAnother US-backed peace deal was signed this month by Armenia and Azerbaijan which involved the creation of a profitable trade link – the ‘Trump corridor’ – between the two nations.\n\nIgnorant Left-wing critics mock Trump for his supposedly undisguised ambition to earn the Nobel peace prize, and his self-appointed title of ‘Peacemaker-in-chief’.\n\nHis foreign policy is motivated by vanity, they claim.\n\nI don’t believe that is true. He deplores the loss of human life, as we have seen from his angry social media posts condemning Russian attacks on Ukrainian cities. But he also believes in protecting America’s national security and economic interests, and his instincts tell him this is best done through peace – a peace achieved by strength.\n\nThe brazen hypocrisy of those who taunt him about the Nobel prize is ugly to witness. These are the same voices from the Left who are pleading for peace in the Middle East. Are they really so shallow that they care about human lives only when these can be saved by politicians of their own stripe?\n\nBarack Obama was awarded a Nobel peace prize in his first year as president, when his foreign policy had achieved nothing. Seven years later, he had still done nothing to merit it.\n\nJoe Biden managed less than nothing. It’s hard to escape the conclusion that Biden’s weakness emboldened Putin to attack Ukraine.\n\nRussia did not count on the doggedness of Ukrainian resistance, nor the way that Brexit Britain under Boris Johnson would rally European opposition to Putin’s so-called ‘special operation’. But Putin did gauge Biden’s lack of resolve correctly. The response from Washington was craven.\n\nNothing about America under Trump can justly be called craven. Nato too has rediscovered its backbone. For more than 30 years, as the Soviet threat receded, European countries were content to be freeloaders under US protection.\n\nBloated welfare state provision was funded by money saved on defence. Trump has not fully reversed that state of affairs, but he has begun to change it.\n\nThe Nato summit in June was a triumph for his deal-making, as America’s allies reached a reluctant decision to invest 5 per cent of GDP in defence.\n\nPutin knows Nato’s military might far outguns anything his war-ravaged country can muster. Nato’s long-range ballistic missiles, its phenomenal powers of intelligence gathering, its utter supremacy in air power and space communications, and above all its vast array of nuclear weapons, guarantee that Russia can never be victorious in a global conflict with the West.\n\nOf course Nato is a defensive alliance but Putin dare not provoke it now. The threat of a Russian invasion of the Baltic states, for example, while still real, has receded since Trump took office in January.\n\nWhat Putin fears most, though, is not only American military power but its economic might. Trump has sent shockwaves through the global financial system by imposing, lifting and reapplying tariffs. Most observers assumed he was doing this largely as leverage to achieve better trade deals.\n\nBut we are also increasingly seeing the strategic application of tariffs and economic pressure against America’s adversaries.\n\nThey are the economy’s equivalent of nuclear weapons, capable of bringing an enemy to his knees almost overnight. Russia is already subject to stiff sanctions. But these are not a complete financial stranglehold. Billions of roubles still flow into the country as oil and gas flow out.\n\nIndia and China are its biggest customers. And despite all the West’s condemnation of the Ukraine invasion, Europe also remains one of the major markets for Russian fossil fuels.\n\nThose markets will dry up overnight if Trump chooses. He can tell China, India and Europe to cease doing business with Russia, or face unprecedented tariffs. Self-interest will force them to comply.\n\nAs Trump and Putin meet this week, the world’s most powerful man and leader of the free world will be facing one of the most dangerous and evil dictators on the planet. The US president will need to prove himself a deal-maker as never before.\n\nBut if anyone can end the Ukraine war and bring peace to Europe’s eastern border, it is Donald Trump.\n\nNile Gardiner is a former aide to Margaret Thatcher","summary":"Trump alone has the power to drag Russia's Vladimir Putin to the negotiating table and has the diplomatic leverage necessary to force an end to the war in Ukraine.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/debate/article-14998043/Ignore-vitriol-Left-truth-week-Trump-worlds-Peacemaker-Chief-NILE-GARDINER.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/08/13/20/101197137-0-image-m-101_1755115196065.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-08-14 00:30:18","author":"Editor,Nile Gardiner","authors":["Editor","Nile Gardiner"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":0.095},{"id":350866370,"title":"400 National Guard members descend upon DC; expanded crime crackdown expected Wednesday night","text":"Around 400 D.C.

So can the ultimate survivor defeat his enemies on the battlefield and in the courtroom?","text":"Israel’s embattled prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu cut a confident and determined figure as he faced the foreign media in a rare live press conference held in his Jerusalem office late afternoon on Sunday.\n\nHe began against a backdrop of a screen that read, ‘Open your eyes to Hamas lies’. It was vintage ‘Bibi’: when your back’s against the wall, come out with all guns blazing.\n\nThousands of his fellow citizens may have been protesting in the streets against his plan to take over Gaza City but Netanyahu was going ahead regardless. This uncompromising approach has marked his attitude to the war from day one and is all the more remarkable given that he has simultaneously been fighting on a second, and far more personal, front.\n\nIsrael’s wartime leader has spent many key hours of the last few months in the austere surroundings of Jerusalem and Tel Aviv District Court rooms, where he is on trial for bribery, fraud and ‘breach of trust’.\n\nIn the days before he gave the order to strike Iran’s nuclear facilities in June, Netanyahu was not to be found hunkered down with close advisers at his official residence in Jerusalem.\n\nHe had not cleared his schedule for final meetings with the top brass, going over every detail ahead of the most high-stakes military operation of his long and colourful tenure.\n\nInstead, he spent many of those critical final hours sitting in a courtroom.\n\n‘He came to court but he couldn’t talk,’ says a source close to Netanyahu, who described the PM as uncharacteristically tongue-tied during the proceedings on June 11, after the Israeli PM had refused to vary his schedule in case Tehran took it as a signal that an attack was imminent.\n\n‘He hadn’t slept, but he had to play everything normal,’ the source adds.\n\n‘It was surreal,’ another senior Israeli official tells the Daily Mail. ‘I mean, there was even something about a Bugs Bunny doll bought for his son 30 years ago or something equally absurd.’ (The stuffed toy, gifted by a billionaire political supporter, nearly 30 years ago, was cited as evidence of Netanyahu’s alleged greed.)\n\nToday, we can reveal in detail the inside story of how Netanyahu has been fighting in court for his political life while waging his high-stakes war in the region.\n\nWe can report how top military officers were secretly brought into court to plead with the judge to reduce the number of weekly hearings in his case so he would have more time to plan the Iran operation as early as February this year.\n\nMost months there have been closed-door arguments over his availability as judges determine whether the case should be adjourned to help the war effort, or if his lawyers were just playing for time. Netanyahu’s legal team have been attending as many as three hearings every week – often with the PM himself required to appear.\n\nSo it was in the run-up to the strike on Iran. After the session described above had concluded, Netanyahu went home to clear his head.\n\nJust 24 hours later, he gave the order to launch Operation Rising Lion against the ayatollahs.\n\nIt was the start of what Donald Trump later christened the ‘Twelve-Day War’ — a unilateral strike that, exactly as Netanyahu had gambled, culminated with the US President dispatching American B2 planes to drop more than a dozen bunker-buster bombs on Iran’s nuclear sites built deep underground in mountainous regions.\n\nThis followed Hamas being pulverised in Gaza at immense cost to the civilian population; the decapitation of Hezbollah in a flamboyant ‘exploding pagers’ operation in Lebanon; and the fall of Bashar al-Assad in Syria.\n\nNow, in Tehran, the ‘head of the snake’ had been hit.\n\nAnd with Iran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei and his allies at their weakest, many believed a once-in-a-generation opportunity presented itself to reset the balance of power and bring about regional peace and security.\n\nNetanyahu stood on the cusp of striking a deal to end the war in Gaza. In doing so, he could engineer the return of the remaining hostages and perhaps even normalise relations with Saudi Arabia and the wider Arab world.\n\nIt was a truly remarkable change of fortune for Israel’s longest serving Prime Minister who had been caught unawares when his country suffered its greatest tragedy in the shape of October 7. As for the court case, at the height of his victory over Iran, Netanyahu’s lawyers were reportedly negotiating a plea deal that could have seen his case disappear – but Israeli Press said it fell apart over the PM’s refusal to step down as a condition.\n\nWhy didn’t he take the offer? Any sane man would surely accept a plea deal to ensure that his remarkable political career did not end in disgrace.\n\nYet the only thing everyone we spoke to agrees on is that Benjamin Netanyahu is not going anywhere. ‘It is not in his DNA,’ says long-standing political opponent and former deputy director of Mossad, Ram Ben-Barak.\n\nA close ally of the prime minister concurs. ‘He will never resign – not as a condition of these bogus allegations,’ they told us.\n\nBut, if he won’t resign, then what on earth is his plan? ‘He will run [for prime minister] again, of course,’ they added.\n\nToday, just weeks after turning down the plea deal, Netanyahu is once more under unbearable pressure with anti-war protests gathering steam and Israelis hysterical over appalling images of hostages Evyatar David and Rom Braslavski being starved in the terror tunnels of Gaza.\n\nJerusalem and Washington have both pulled out of ceasefire talks, blaming Hamas’s intransigence on key issues – with the terror group emboldened to refuse to disarm after calls from Britain, France and Canada to recognise a Palestinian state.\n\nMeanwhile, widely circulated images of starvation in Gaza – some now denounced by Netanyahu as fakes – have shocked the world and Netanyahu’s declaration that Israel will take over Gaza City has heaped yet more criticism on the war that has killed over 60,000 according to the Hamas-run health ministry.\n\nFor years now, Israel’s fate has become increasingly intertwined with that of Netanyahu, 75.\n\nHe became the first prime minister to be born in the Jewish State back in 1996 and he has served three terms, though not all of them continuously.\n\nIt was in 2019, while still in office, that Netanyahu was charged with bribery, fraud and breach of trust in three separate cases.\n\nHe is said to have accepted luxury gifts of cigars and champagne and to have struck ‘backroom deals’ with a newspaper baron and a telecoms boss.\n\nNetanyahu and his supporters insisted he was the victim of a ‘witch hunt’ and tied his political survival to that of the nation’s battle against internal enemies.\n\nHe was ousted in 2021 but cobbled together a hardline Right-wing coalition and returned in December 2022 – before announcing plans to overhaul the judiciary five days after reassuming power.\n\nIt sparked mass protests over allegations he was attempting to influence his own trials and – amid the chaos – Hamas launched its barbaric terror attack, killing 1,200 and taking 251 hostages.\n\nThere could be no doubt that both Netanyahu and his country were fighting for their survival.\n\nNetanyahu’s allies believe that events since October 7 are a vindication of their leader’s patriotism and far-sightedness. He has not only taken out Israel’s enemies one by one but cleared the way for that strike on Iran.\n\nBut his opponents, while supporting the attack on Tehran, are circumspect.\n\n‘He is taking a lot of credit for winning in Iran, which is much more down to our brilliant military and intelligence,’ says former deputy director of Mossad, Ben-Barak.\n\n‘I say, if you take the credit for winning in Iran, you must also take the responsibility for the failure of October 7.’\n\nThere has still been no inquiry for the failings that day – Netanyahu insists this must come after the war in Gaza ends.\n\nNaturally, opponents see a shrewd opportunist determined to fight a ‘forever war’ in a bid to keep his day of reckoning at bay.\n\nAs Britain becomes the latest to push for Palestine to be recognised when the UN General Assembly opens in September, critics see Netanyahu putting his personal survival above what is best for his country. Dr Nachman Shai, former Minister of Diaspora Affairs of the Israeli Labor party, said: ‘Netanyahu and this government have made Israel much weaker internationally.\n\n‘After October 7 Israel had all the legitimacy to destroy Hamas and bring back the hostages, but nearly two years later a Palestinian state is being recognised. How did we get here? It’s unimaginable.’\n\nOn the other hand, his supporters argue it is precisely Netanyahu’s ability to ignore criticism and stay focused on his goals that make him the only leader capable of leading Israel in its hour of need.\n\n‘One of his supporters told me they went to Africa and met an elephant with Bibi’s skin,’ an ally jokes. ‘You cannot live with these attacks unless you thicken your skin. That is what created him, that’s what gave him the opportunity and ability to win after October 7.’\n\nNot only was he facing calls to resign but, within weeks of October 7, his trial resumed.\n\nThe PM’s legal team is headed by 39-year-old attorney Amit Hadad. Members of Netanyahu’s inner circle quip that the leader spends more time with Hadad than with his own family.\n\nThe PM’s adviser, Topaz Luk, said the ‘profound closeness’ between the two men ‘goes beyond legal representation’ and everyone in the inner circle credits this relationship for much of Netanyahu’s success.\n\nThey describe as ‘absurd’ the decision to resume legal proceedings against him for three days a week in the wake of the October 7 attacks, given the grave military challenges facing the country.\n\n‘It was so surreal to me to see everything continue as if the world was not being torn apart,’ one says.\n\nBut Netanyahu has not struggled with the rigours of the process, they argue.\n\n‘If he was interrogated from 8am to 12pm, at 12.30pm he would meet the US Secretary of State,’ they add. ‘He doesn’t care, it’s as if it’s someone else’s trial. That’s how he works. He is only focused on the relevant target.’\n\nThat is not to say the court case hasn’t been distracting. Just two days after Bashar al-Assad’s Syrian dictatorship fell to hardline Islamist rebels on December 8 last year, for example, Netanyahu was in court embarking on his primary statement as a witness.\n\nHis pleas to postpone the case by two weeks on account of Assad’s fall went unheard and he was not granted a single day’s leave. Three months after that, the Daily Mail has learnt, Netanyahu made a top secret request to reduce the number of days the court would sit in order to give him more time to plan the Iranian operation.\n\nThe head of military intelligence and the military secretary all went to court to attend a closed-door hearing which got under way only after everyone present had signed a ‘vicious protocol’ which made it clear what would happen should they ‘expose this state secret’.\n\nIt is claimed the head of Israeli intelligence argued in line with the defence that this was essential.\n\nThe judge did adjourn hearings for two days, and the case continued at a reduced rate of two a week.\n\nNetanyahu’s inner circle adamantly believe the legal obduracy shows the case is designed to tie up the prime minister.\n\nBoaz Bismuth, a close ally of Netanyahu, says: ‘In these challenging times, we need a prime minister at the wheel and not in court.’\n\nFollowing the success of the Iran strikes, however, Bibi appeared to get his mojo back. ‘Those 12 days, they brought the colour back to his cheeks,’ an ally says of the attack.\n\nIt is this confidence that leads everyone who knows the prime minister to believe he will run again, before his term runs out in October next year.\n\nBut as Israel’s fate and that of its leader become ever more tightly intertwined, there is a growing fear that the historic opportunity that presents itself right now for regional peace will slip away.\n\nSome 50 hostages remain held by Hamas, of whom 20 are believed to be alive, but the growing international condemnation of Israel’s approach to Gaza and the increasing calls for recognition of a Palestinian state have emboldened Hamas to harden its stance in negotiations.\n\nMeanwhile, Israeli families are tired of burying their dead in a war they thought would be over in months, not years.\n\nFor Israel’s leading commentator, Amit Segal, who has seen his fair share of Israeli leaders come and go, Netanyahu’s rule is following a familiar pattern.\n\n‘At a certain point, they start believing that being a patriot means that they must serve as prime minister, because otherwise the country will collapse,’ he says.\n\n‘Netanyahu is no exception.’","summary":"Israel's wartime leader has spent many key hours of the last few months in the austere surroundings of Jerusalem and Tel Aviv District Court rooms, where he is on trial.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-14997973/battle-Bibis-political-life.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/08/13/20/101196653-0-image-m-11_1755113789392.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-08-14 00:23:07","author":"Editor,Natalie Lisbona","authors":["Editor","Natalie Lisbona"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":0.008},{"id":350859098,"title":"Taylor Swift on New Heights: New album, Travis Kelce relationship","text":"The episode begins with a screaming introduction from Jason, the former Philadelphia Eagles player, who runs through a long list of his brother's girlfriend's accomplishments, including being the only artist to win the album of the year Grammy four times.\n\nSwift sat beside Travis, chuckling along before thanking Jason for his enthusiasm.\n\nShe then went on to poke fun at her appearing on a podcast that typically caters to American football fans.\n\n\"As we all know, you know, you guys have a lot of male sports fans that listen to your podcast,\" she said. \n\n\"I think we all know that if there's one thing that male sports fans want in their spaces and on their screens, it's more of me,\" she deadpanned, looking straight into the camera. \n\nSwift's appearance at Kansas City Chiefs games caused a frenzy over the years.

The MACD shows bullish signals, RSI stays above 50, and the rally is driven by real demand, not leveraged bets, as mentioned by TradingNews. Ethereum (ETH) is at $4,693 (+8.18%), Solana (SOL) at $201 (+12%), and XRP at $3.28 (+2.88%). Still, Bitcoin dominates macro trends. Year-to-date, Bitcoin is up 28%, similar to Gold. But Bitcoin is now seen as a modern monetary hedge rather than just a risky asset, as per reports. Companies like GameStop, MicroStrategy, and ETHZilla are buying BTC and ETH for treasury reserves. ETHZilla holds $350M ETH and $240M cash, boosting its stock by 432% this week. BTC-USD is a buy with caution near $123K. Targets: $125K first, $137K extended. Risk is moderate. Close below $116K cancels short-term bullish view. Bitcoin continues as the strongest asset in a market driven by liquidity, rate cycles, and scarcity. Upward momentum remains unless Fed action or demand changes, as per TradingNews. FAQsQ1. Why is Bitcoin price rising so fast now?Bitcoin is rising due to strong ETF inflows, high institutional demand, supportive Fed rate cut expectations, and new policies allowing retirement accounts to invest in crypto.Q2. What is the next target price for Bitcoin?Bitcoin could reach $125,000 first, with an extended target of $137,000 if it breaks the $123,000 resistance level.(You can now subscribe to our Economic Times WhatsApp channel)\n\nRead More News onbitcoin pricebitcoinbtc pricebtcbtc all time highBitcoin investmentBitcoin ETF inflowsBitcoin target pricecrypto market trends\n\n(Catch all the US News, UK News, Canada News, International Breaking News Events, and Latest News Updates on The Economic Times.)

Later, he talked about it on the podcast, which Taylor heard, leading to them finally meeting.\n'This dude didn't get a meet and greet, and he's making it everyone's problem,' Swift — who also unveiled the sexy cover for her new album on Wednesday —\n\nThe Karma hitmaker compared their love story to being in 'an 80's John Hughes movie' adding, 'and he was just like standing outside my window with a boom box just being like \"I wanna date you!\"'\n'I was like, if this guy isn't crazy — which is a big if — this is sort of what I've been writing songs about wanting to happen to me since I was a teenager.' \nThe sweet appearance also included Travis kissing Taylor's hand and gushing that he was 'the luckiest man in the world.' \n\nTaylor Swift, 35, delighted her fans on Wednesday by sharing the 'wild' and 'romantic' details of how her love story with Travis Kelce, 35, began\nSwift shared how she owed a lot to the New Heights podcast, joking it helped her get a boyfriend because 'Travis decided to use [the podcast] as his personal dating app.'\nTravis' brother and co-host, Jason Kelce, then inquired, 'Were his friendship bracelets that good? Did you get the friendship bracelet?'\n\n Taylor Swift unveils VERY sexy cover for new album The Life Of A Showgirl and reveals release date \n'I've never seen the original,' Taylor quipped.\nTravis then explained that the bracelets 'didn't leave the stadium because he was 'butthurt' that he didn't get to meet Swift.\n'He threw a tantrum. He threw a man tantrum,' Taylor joked. \n'It was such a wild, romantic gesture, to just be like, \"I wanna date you!\"' the singer gushed. \n'Sweetie, that's what it does when you're on stage, you performed in Arrowhead, that's what it did to me,' Kelce said. 'You come to Arrowhead, I get to meet you. That's the perk of playing for the Chiefs,' the NFL star added.\nTaylor then humorously recalled how Travis 'didn't even reach out' to her management.\n'He thought that 'cause he knows the elevator lady, that he could talk to her about just getting down.'\n\nThe singer appeared on her boyfriend's New Heights podcast for the very first time, and recalled how Travis first got her attention, when he attended one of her Eras Tour concerts in July 2023\n\nThe Karma hitmaker compared their love story to being in 'an 80's John Hughes movie' adding, 'and he was just like standing outside my window with a boom box just being like \"I wanna date you!\"'\n\n'I was like, if this guy isn't crazy — which is a big if — this is sort of what I've been writing songs about wanting to happen to me since I was a teenager,' Taylor said\n\nThe sweet appearance also included Travis kissing Taylor's hand and gushing that he was 'the luckiest man in the world'\n'And I got denied,' Travis chimed in.\n'He really was just like, \"I know a guy, I can figure this out.\"'\nShe then compared Travis to a John Hughes movie character, joking he was outside her window with a boombox yelling 'I wanna date you! Do you wanna go on a date with me? I made you a friendship bracelet. Do you wanna date me?' \nTravis then added with a pleading voice, 'Just come outside and meet me. Just meet me once. Just give me a chance.' \nTravis also jokingly said he was listening to all of Taylor's songs and knew she wanted him to come to her concert.\nTaylor then imitated Travis' voice, stating, 'I'm upset that you didn't meet me, even though you didn't know I wanted to meet you because I didn't do any proper logistical planning.'\n'Who plans nowadays?' Travis quipped.\n'It was wild, but it worked,' Taylor said.\nTravis then kissed Taylor's hand, and said he was 'the luckiest man in the world.' \nJason then asked Taylor, 'How did you know he wasn't crazy?' to which the singer humorously replied, 'He is crazy, Jason.' \nTravis Kelce\n\nShare or comment on this article: \nTaylor Swift tells all on Travis Kelce love story as she thrills listeners with their dating secrets\n\nAdd comment\n\nComments 14\n\n Share what you think\n\nWorst rated\n\nThe comments below have not been moderated.\n\nThe views expressed in the contents above are those of our users and do not necessarily reflect the views of MailOnline.\n\nAdd your comment\n\nEnter your comment\n\nBy posting your comment you agree to our house rules.\n\nSubmit Comment\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual.\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual\n\nWe will automatically post your comment and a link to the news story to your Facebook timeline at the same time it is posted on MailOnline.

Email tips@dailymail.com \nBy BETHAN EDWARDS, SHOWBUSINESS REPORTER \n Published:00:43 BST, 14 August 2025 |Updated:01:17 BST, 14 August 2025 \n\nTaylor Swift looked nothing short of sensational in a skimpy feathered and bejewelled outfit in first look pictures of her jaw-dropping upcoming album artwork. \nThe 14-time Grammy Award-winning singer, 35, first dropped the news about her 12th studio album earlier this week while teasing her upcoming appearance on boyfriend Travis Kelce's New Heights podcast.\nAnd on Wednesday, just minutes after her New Heights episode premiered, the Red singer revealed the official album cover for The Life Of A Showgirl.\nShe confirmed that the album will be released on October 3 — just over a year and a half after the release of her 11th studio album, The Tortured Poets Department.\nIn the new album artwork Taylor made sure to drop jaws as she sizzled in racy bejewelled numbers as she posed in a theatre. \nIn one snap, the Shake It Off singer wore huge pink feathers and a bobbed black wig as she perched on a table sipping a cocktail.\nKeeping in the showgirl theme, Taylor wore a huge 20s themed feathered headpiece and dazzling bodysuit. \nTurning up the heat, the Cruel Summer songstress wowed in a black and red glittering strapless bodysuit as she posed lying on a chair. \n\nTaylor Swift looked nothing short of sensational in a skimpy feathered and bejewelled outfit in first look pictures of her jaw-dropping upcoming album artwork\n\nAnd during the New Heights podcast, Taylor shared her new album artwork where she sizzled in racy bejewelled numbers as she posed in a mirrored room \nShe left her long blonde tresses loose and accessorised with coordinated long gloves and sexy fishnet tights. \nFor the main album cover, Taylor showed off her amazing figure in a jewelled bodysuit as she lay in a bathtub. \nThe busty starlet stares stoically at the camera in the striking image captured by famed photographers Mert Alas and Marcus Piggott. \nElsewhere in the podcast, Taylor revealed the sweet reason why she chose to announce her new album on boyfriend Travis Kelce's New Heights show. \nShe gushed that the podcast has 'done a lot for me' as she opened up about her career on the special pre-season episode with Travis and his brother Jason Kelce. \nTaylor admitted that her teenage dreams have come true as she discussed her relationship and how the pair met. \nRevealing why she chose to go on the podcast, she said: 'This podcast has done a lot for me and this podcast got me my boyfriend after Travis used this as a dating profile. \n'It was wild that he was like, 'I want to date you', when this podcast came out he didn't even reach out to my management. He thought because he knew a guy he could just get in. \n'I'm not an online person at all it terrifies me as I have 20million unread DMs. He was just like, 'Date me I've made you a friendship bracelet'. And I was like if he wasn't crazy then this is exactly what I've wanted since I was a teenage.'\nTravis added: 'I credit the Eras Tour I was engulfed by you and you make me so much better. I see you on the stage and how crazy you can get a stadium going and I met you and it was the easiest conversation I have ever had'. \n\nThe pop superstar, 35, announced her 12th album The Life Of A Showgirl on boyfriend Travis Kelce's podcast New Heights\n\nProving to be her sexiest album cover yet, Swift flashes the flesh in a skimpy green jeweled bodysuit while submerged in water in what appeared to be a bathtub.\n\nShe made sure to catching the eye in a daring red and black strapless bodysuit which she teamed with long gloves and fishnet tights as she posed on a chair \n'You knocked my socks off, I've never experienced something so real and beautiful in person', he added. \nJason joked: 'Shall I just leave'. \nTravis first fell for Taylor as he attended her concert at Arrowhead Stadium, where he plays football for the Kansas City Chiefs.\nHe was pictured watching the concert from a private box, and even trading friendship bracelets with fans at the venue.\nThe NFL heartthrob revealed how he tried - and failed - to make a move on Swift at her concert.\nHe said he had his phone number inscribed on a bracelet, which he planned to present to the pop star.\nHowever when he attended one of Taylor's concerts in Kansas City, he was unsuccessful in his attempts to meet her backstage.\n'So she doesn't meet anybody and she doesn't - or at least she didn't want to meet me, so I took it personal,' he quipped on his podcast New Heights to his brother Jason Kelce.\nHe said he was 'disappointed that she doesn't talk before or after her shows because she has to save her voice for the 44 songs that she sings, so I was a little butthurt I didn't get to hand her one of the bracelets I've made for her.'\n'If you're up on Taylor Swift concerts, there are friendship bracelets, and I received a bunch of them being there, but I wanted to give Taylor Swift one with my number on it.'\nAlthough he was unable to meet with Taylor face-to-face, he had nothing but warm words for her performance, which he hailed as 'an unbelievable show.'\n\nTaylor wowed in a huge red feathered headpiece and dazzling bodysuit \n\nFor the main album cover, Taylor showed off her amazing figure in a jewelled bodysuit as she lay in a bathtub. The popstar revealed the album will be released on October 3\nElsewhere on the podcast, she revealed the album's song titles are: The Fate Of Ophelia, Elizabeth Taylor, Opalite, Father Figure, Eldest Daughter, Ruin The Friendship, Actually Romantic, Wi$h Li$t, Wood, CANCELLED!, Honey and The Life Of A Showgirl.\nFans were quick to spot that the album's title track features Swift's Eras Tour opening act and two-time Grammy winner, Sabrina Carpenter.\nThe album comes just a year and a half after the release of Swift's Grammy Award-winning 11th studio album, The Tortured Poets Department, which came out in April 2024.\nThe Life Of A Showgirl marks a major musical departure for Swift as it is her first album in 10 years that will not feature production by her longtime collaborator, Jack Antonoff.\nInstead, Swift confirmed she co-produced her new album with pop music heavyweights, Max Martin and Shellback.\nIt comes after Taylor shocked her loyal fans on Monday with a countdown leading down to the announcement of her new album: The Life Of A Showgirl.\nThe hitmaker's website initially featured a countdown over a glittering orange background and the cryptic text below: 'Expires August 12 at 12:12AM ET' the release date is yet to be confirmed.\nThe excitement-inducing countdown appeared after Swift left fans convinced that was preparing to release new music after a recent tease from the Empire State Building.\nTaylor's website crashed immediately after the timer ran out, stymying many of her devoted fans, but the X account for her boyfriend Travis Kelce's podcast shared a clip of her announcing the new LP.\n'So I wanted to show you something,' Taylor said in a clip as she sat next to Travis. Then she pulled out a white case with 'TS' written on the side in orange block letters.\n'This is my brand-new album, The Life Of A Showgirl,' Taylor said proudly as she held up a vinyl version of the album, which was censored in the video. \nTravis' brother Jason Kelce let out a piercing scream of joy as soon as the album title escaped her lips. \n'TS 12!' Travis cheered excitedly, referencing The Life Of A Showgirl's status as her twelfth studio album, as the announcement clip came to an abrupt end.\nOnce Swift's website was back online, it had transformed into a 'pre pre-order' store for the upcoming album.\n\nElsewhere on the podcast, Taylor admitted that her teenage dreams have come true as she discussed her relationship with Travis and how the pair met\n\n Taylor Swift tells all on Travis Kelce love story as she thrills listeners with their dating secrets \nShe was offering a $30 vinyl version of the album, a $13 CD that came with a double-sided poster decorated on either side with photos of the hitmaker and a $20 cassette version designed to appeal to fans with a retro streak. \nEach display featured a heavily blurred version of what appeared to be the album cover, and the description promised that the various formats would have unique cover designs.\nThe vinyl version appeared to be tailored to collectors, as it was described as being printed on 'Portofino Orange Glitter Vinyl,' which was described as translucent orange vinyl decorated with gold glitter.\nAfter the announcement, fans began speculating about possible guest appearances on The Life Of A Showgirl, even though Swift has given any indication of who might join her on the album.\nHowever, she may have given a hint about the album's producer with a Spotify playlist released on Monday in advance of the announcement.\nEagle-eyed fans noted that every song an the playlist had been produced by Max Martin. \nThe pop music maven used to be a major collaborator with Swift, but the two haven't worked together since recording music for 2017's Reputation, and Martin was notably absent from the sessions to rerecord songs he had previously worked on. \nAfter the announcement, fans shared their excitement on social media.\n'OMG OMG TAYLOR SWIFT'S NEW ALBUM — THE LIFE OF A SHOWGIRL — TS 12!! 🥹❤️ I'm so happy!!!' one user gushed on X.\nAnother fan posted a clip of Oprah Winfrey being overcome with emotion and juxtaposed it against Taylor's new preorders. \nOne disappointed Swiftie admitted that they 'missed' the album announcement because they were 'doing mcat practice questions,' adding, 'they really don't tell you about the sacrifices of a premed until you're in it 😔.' \n\nTaylor shocked her loyal fans on Monday with a countdown leading down to the announcement of her new album, which she shared in a preview of boyfriend Travis' podcast New Heights (pictured)\n\nThe pop superstar website featured a countdown over a glittering orange background and the cryptic text below: 'Expires August 12 at 12:12AM ET.' The website crashed immediately after the timer had run out\n\nOnce Swift's website was back online, it had transformed into a 'pre pre-order' store for the upcoming album. She was selling $30 orange-and-gold-glitter vinyl records, $13 CD-and-poster combos and $20 cassettes for retro-minded fans\n\nBREAKING NEWS Taylor Swift breaks down in tears during PDA-heavy podcast debut with boyfriend Travis Kelce \nSeveral fans also noted how different the album release was compared to previous announcements due to Taylor's decision to share the news on her boyfriend's podcast. \n'Announcing your album on your boyfriends and his brothers podcast...what's happened to my taylor swift,' wrote one concerned fan.\nSeveral other users poked fun at how Swift's website couldn't handle the throng of traffic it attracted. \nOne poster shared a gif of Kieran Culkin from Succession in which he looked morosely at a computer screen showing him nothing but bad news, captioning it, 'Taylor Swift's website administrator.' \nOn Monday, the official X account for the iconic New York City skyscraper shared an image of the building, seemingly taken in February, with its top part lit up with orange lights, and the caption, 'See you next era.'\nMany believed the post signaled Swift's next musical chapter following her extremely successful Eras Tour, and the consistent use of orange suggested a connection with her upcoming website reveal.\nThe official account for the Eras Tour even commented on the post, writing, 'Yessss' with an orange heart emoji. \nSwift's last musical release was her 11th album, The Tortured Poets Department, which came out in April 2024.\nTaylor SwiftJason KelceTravis Kelce\n\nShare or comment on this article: \nTaylor Swift's showgirl era!

New album The Life of a Showgirl. Out October 3 ❤️‍,' Swift tweeted to fans on X (formerly Twitter).\nProving to be her sexiest album cover yet, Swift flashes the flesh in a skimpy green jeweled bodysuit while submerged in water in what appeared to be a bathtub.\n\nTaylor Swift has officially revealed the release date for her highly-anticipated new album The Life Of A Showgirl as she unveiled the ultra sexy cover on Wednesday.\nThe busty starlet stares stoically at the camera in the striking image captured by famed photographers Mert Alas and Marcus Piggott. \nSwift — who will soon celebrate her and Kelce's 2nd anniversary — is decked out with diamond jewelry on her wrists as well as a red manicure.\nThe stylized cover art has a collage-like look as cropped, close-up photos of Swift's glitzy green costume are used a border.

So, \"to go a full year without one is a remarkable feat for most cities – let alone a European capital\".\n'Vision Zero'\nThe achievement is the culmination of years of work to reduce and then eliminate road deaths in Finland. The country adopted a \"Vision Zero\" traffic safety strategy in the early 2000s, guided by a set of principles and policies that, said The Guardian in 2020, \"shifts responsibility for crashes from road users to the designers of the road system\". If there is a crash, \"it is up to authorities to ensure that it does not happen again\".\n\nSubscribe to The Week\n\nEscape your echo chamber.

It recorded zero pedestrian fatalities in 2019, with the city's last fatal traffic accident occurring in early July 2024. Traffic-related injuries in the capital have also plummeted from 727 in 2023 to 14 in 2024.\n\nFor context, there were a total of 20,418 deaths on EU roads in 2023, with two countries, Lithuania and Latvia, registering an strong increase (33% and 26% respectively), according to a European Transport Safety Council report.\n'A handful of small changes'\nHelsinki's success does not come \"from any one major policy shift but from a handful of small changes\" that add up to \"meaningful impact\" said MSM. By focusing on safer people, safer roads, safer vehicles, safer speeds and better post-crash care, the aim is to create \"multiple layers of protection, so if one fails, the others will create a safety net to lessen the impact of a crash\", said Forbes\nMore than half the city's streets now have a speed limit of 30 kph (less than 20 mph), a decision driven by data showing the risk of pedestrian fatality is cut in half by reducing a car's speed of impact from 40 kph to to 30 kph, said Politico.\n\nSign up for Today's Best Articles in your inbox\nA free daily email with the biggest news stories of the day – and the best features from TheWeek.com\nContact me with news and offers from other Future brandsReceive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsorsBy submitting your information you agree to the Terms & Conditions and Privacy Policy and are aged 16 or over.\nAnd \"street design has also played a key role\", said Finnish news outlet YLE. \"Pedestrian and cycling infrastructure has been significantly upgraded\" and \"more traffic cameras and automated enforcement systems have been introduced\". In many areas, \"roads have been narrowed and trees have been planted with the deliberate goal of making drivers move more cautiously\", said Politico.\nOther measures include \"improving the traffic skills of different road users\", said Forbes, as well as increasing motorcycle and moped helmet-wearing rates to nearly 100%, and \"allowing the police to make random alcohol and drug tests\". Finland is also the only country in Europe to conduct an in-depth investigation into every single fatal collision.\nThe European Transport Safety Council has recognised the country's carefully co-ordinated progress in road safety. \"In Finland, they say, 'Vahinko ei tule kello kaulassa',\" said ETSC director Antonio Avenoso. This \"roughly translates as: 'Accidents don't come with a bell around their neck'\".\n\nExplore More\n\nThe Week UK\n\nSocial Links Navigation\n\nCritics' choice: Outstanding new Japanese restaurants\n\nAn all-women sushi team, a 15-seat listening bar, and more\n\nWhy do Dana White and Donald Trump keep pushing for a White House UFC match?\n\nTODAY'S BIG QUESTION\nThe president and the sports mogul each have their own reasons for wanting a White House spectacle\n\n'Quiet vacationing': a secret revolt against workplace culture\n\nThe explainer\nYou can be in two places at once\n\nYou might also like\n\nHow Norway became an electric vehicle pioneer\n\nUnder The Radar\nEarly adoption, incentives and political consistency have helped Scandinavian nation race ahead\n\nWhy are feds cracking down on SUVs and big trucks?\n\nToday's Big Question\nPedestrian deaths have risen sharply since 2009\n\nUS to require automatic braking on new cars\n\n'We're living through a crisis in roadway deaths'\n\nView More ▸\n\nContact Future's experts\n\nTerms and Conditions\n\nPrivacy Policy\n\nCookie Policy\n\nAdvertise With Us\n\nThe Week is part of Future US Inc, an international media group and leading digital publisher.

But he added that eventually \"there'll be some swapping, there'll be some changes in land\".\n\nMerz said Ukraine is ready to negotiate \"on territorial issues\" but stressed that legal recognition of Russian occupations \"would not be up for debate\".\n\nAfter the call, European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen said Europe, the United States and NATO had \"strengthened the common ground for Ukraine\" while NATO head Mark Rutte declared: \"The ball is now in Putin's court.\"\n\n- 'Wool over our eyes' -\n\nThe Russian foreign ministry had earlier branded the frantic round of diplomacy \"politically and practically insignificant\" and an attempt at \"sabotaging\" US and Russian efforts to end the conflict.\n\nDespite the upbeat comments by European leaders, Russia's offensive in eastern Ukraine was gaining speed and seizing ground Wednesday. \n\nRussia has made rapid advances this week in a narrow but important section of the front line in Ukraine. \n\nThe AFP data analysis showed that the Russian army took or claimed 110 square kilometers (42.5 square miles) on August 12 compared to the previous day. It was the most since late May 2024. \n\nUkrainian soldiers in Kramatorsk, an eastern city about 20 kilometers (12 miles) from the front, said they had low expectations for Trump's meeting with Putin.\n\nArtem, a 30-year-old serviceman, said the war would likely continue for \"a long time.\"\n\n\"Putin is massing an army, his army is growing, he is stockpiling weapons, he is pulling the wool over our eyes.\"","summary":"The high-stakes summit comes with Trump struggling to broker an end to the conflict, and Zelensky and his European allies earlier urged the Republican to push for a ceasefire.","url":"https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/trump-eyes-three-way-meeting-with-putin-zelensky-alska-meet-ukraine-ceasefire/article69930579.ece","image":"https://th-i.thgim.com/public/incoming/2ugj55/article69930584.ece/alternates/LANDSCAPE_1200/Trump_Russia_Ukraine_War_In_His_Words_69524.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-08-14 00:14:00","author":null,"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"in","sentiment":-0.062},{"id":350864000,"title":"Trump Administration Criticizes Britain for ‘Severe Free Speech Restrictions’ Over the Past Year","text":"DONALD Trump’s US administration has attacked Britain for “serious restrictions” on free speech over the past year. \n\nIt said that “the human rights situation worsened in the United Kingdom” during 2024. \n\nA report from the US State Department highlights efforts to suppress online speech following last summer’s Southport attack and the implementation of the recent Online Safety Act, which regulates internet content.\n\nThe document states: “Major human rights concerns include credible allegations of severe restrictions on freedom of expression, such as the enforcement or threat of legal actions to curtail speech, and crimes, violence, or threats targeting individuals motivated by antisemitism.”\n\nOne section also highlights arrests made in the wake of the Southport murders following social media commentary. \n\nThose held included Lucy Connolly, who was jailed after posting that migrant hotels should be burned down. \n\nPolice at the time also told people not to speculate about the identity of the murderer Axel Rudakubana. \n\nThe report called the “two-tier enforcement of these laws following the Southport attacks an especially grievous example of government censorship”. \n\nIt added: “Censorship of ordinary Britons was increasingly routine, often targeted at political speech.” \n\nYesterday, the UK Government asserted: “Free speech is crucial for democracy globally, including in the UK, and we are committed to upholding these freedoms while ensuring the safety of our citizens.”\n\nMeanwhile, the National Police Chiefs’ Council released new guidelines yesterday urging police forces to reveal the ethnicity of suspects in prominent cases. \n\nHome Secretary Yvette Cooper said it would provide greater transparency.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nDONALD Trump’s US administration has attacked Britain for “serious restrictions” on free&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Trump Administration Criticizes Britain for &#8216;Severe Free Speech Restrictions&#8217; Over the Past Year first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/news/us/trump-administration-criticizes-britain-for-severe-free-speech-restrictions-over-the-past-year/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Trumps-administration-slams-Britain-for-‘serious-restrictions-on-free-speech.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-08-14 00:09:59","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.08},{"id":350864946,"title":"Judge weighs whether Trump violated federal law by deploying National Guard to Los Angeles","text":"By OLGA R.

Also Read | 'Ask Government of Pakistan': US Declines To Confirm Fate of Pak's F-16s During Operation Sindoor, Refers Queries to Islamabad.\nHis remarks come after US President Donald Trump imposed 50 per cent tariff on Indian goods -- in two phases -- citing India's imports of Russian oil. Trump announced 25 per cent tariffs on Indian goods plus an unspecified penalty in July, even as there were hopes of an interim India-US trade deal that would have otherwise helped avoid elevated tariffs. A few days later, he imposed another 25 per cent tariff, taking the total to 50 per cent, over India's imports of Russian oil. Swarup described the tarrif hikes as part of a broader \"pressure tactic to secure a more favourable deal.\" Also Read | Wang Yi India Visit: Chinese Foreign Minister To Visit India on August 18 Ahead of PM Narendra Modi's Trip to Tianjin for SCO Summit.\nThe former diplomat also criticised Washington's deepening engagement with Pakistan, calling it a \"strategic mistake\" given Islamabad's close ties with Beijing. \"I think it's a strategic mistake on the part of the US that you are getting in bed with Pakistan, which is in bed with China. China is the US's strategic competitor,\" Swarup said. \"If you cave in to a bully, then the bully will increase his demands. Then there will be even more demands. So, I think we have done the right thing. India is too large, too proud a country to become a camp follower of any other country. Our strategic autonomy has been the bedrock of our foreign policy right from the 1950s. I don't think that any Govt in Delhi can compromise on that,\" he added. On criticism from the Opposition over India's foreign policy, Swarup said India should not cave in to any pressure, as India's strategic autonomy is non-negotiable. \"Here, I would not blame our diplomats at all. I think what has happened is Pakistan, through some intermediaries, has gotten the ear of the US President, and that is why, two visits by Asim Munir to Washington, the so-called \"deal\" with America on the so-called \"oil reserves\" of Pakistan. More importantly, I think Pakistan is now trying to position itself as the 'Crypto King' of South Asia and there, through World Liberty Financial, in which Trump's family has stakes, Steve Witkoff's family has a stake, through that I think Pakistan has managed to project an image of itself as a reliable partner...All these things have led to Trump having a softer approach towards Pakistan,\" he said. \"But that does not mean that he has given up on India or that India is now an adversary for him. I think this is part of his pressure tactics to secure a more favourable deal. India should not cave in because our strategic autonomy is non-negotiable,\" he added. Swarup, also a noted author, added that Trump has made no secret of his longing for the Nobel Peace Prize, and while he is a dealmaker, he has now made it his USP that he is the peacemaker.

Email tips@dailymail.com \nBy JASON CHESTER, ASSISTANT SHOWBUSINESS EDITOR \n Published:01:02 BST, 14 August 2025 |Updated:01:05 BST, 14 August 2025 \n\nAs Phillip Schofield staggered on to the street after a boozy afternoon out, clutching a vape with one hand and the waist of his male companion with the other, he looked every inch the carefree bachelor. \nThe beleaguered former presenter was accompanied by male friend Joshua Luke Sharman, a London based nurse, during an visit to the city's first LGBTQ+ dedicated cinema, the Arzner Bar & Cafe in Bermondsey. \nWith summer temperatures soaring, Schofield, 63, looked somewhat worse for wear, but fortunately, the former This Morning star had Sharman - who describes himself as a 'nurse, academic, inexperienced aviator and clueless but optimistic PhD candidate' - on hand as a supportive and stabilising presence. \nSchofield's wife Stephanie Lowe - the other supportive and stabilising presence in his life, for altogether different reasons - appeared to be absent as he walked arm-in-arm with Sharman across Bermondsey Square. \nTo all intents and purposes, the star - who came out as gay more than five years ago - looked like a carefree single man during his latest public appearance on Tuesday, despite his 23-year marriage to Stephanie. \nHis loyal wife previously insisted she would fully support her husband's 'brave step' and 'stand by his side' as he publicly announced his sexuality during a live appearance on This Morning. But with Schofield now living as an openly gay man, one cannot help but wonder if - or indeed when - the amicable couple might finalise an equally amicable divorce. \n\nPhillip Schofield had a supportive shoulder to lean on as he rounded off a boozy visit to the pub on Tuesday afternoon - and as he knows all too well, it wouldn't be the first\n\nA growing number of celebrity couples are choosing not to divorce, despite being separated, including Phillip Schofield and wife Stephanie Lowe (pictured)\n\nThe former presenter was accompanied by Joshua Luke Sharman, a London based nurse, during an appearance at the city's first LGBTQ + dedicated cinema, the Arzner Bar & Cafe\nSchofield was 25-years old and a fresh faced children's TV presenter when he met Stephanie, at the time a production assistant for CBBC. \nSix years later they were married, with the happy couple exchanging vows in appropriately romantic surroundings at the 16th century, Class A listed Ackergill Tower, located in Sinclair's Bay on Scotland's rugged northern coast. \nThe responsibilities of parenthood would soon follow; already pregnant on her wedding day, Stephanie welcomed the couple's first child - daughter Molly - just four months later, in July 1993. \nSecond child Ruby followed in 1996, the arrival coinciding with a transitional period for Schofield, who had branched into mainstream TV presenting and West End musical theatre after endearing himself to millions as the face of CBBC and Saturday morning kids show Going Live!\nStephanie meanwhile, was an ever present, the supportive and loyal wife pictured alongside her husband at showbiz soirees and red carpet events as his career went from strength to strength. \nAnd little appears to have changed, despite Schofield - whose TV career appears to be in ruins - later admitting he cheated on his her with a younger male colleague while host of ITV daytime flagship This Morning, a role he occupied for 21 years before his departure in 2023.\n\nSchofield was 25-years old and a fresh faced children's TV presenter when he met Stephanie, at the time a production assistant for CBBC (pictured with daughters Molly and Ruby in 2002)\n\nStephanie was an ever present, the supportive and loyal wife pictured alongside her husband at showbiz soirees and red carpet events as his career went from strength to strength\n\nThe downturn began in 2020, when Schofield - supported by This Morning co-host Holly Willoughby - announced in a tearful address to viewers that he is gay \nSchofield later admitted he was suicidal during the bitter fallout that ensued, but still had the valued support of his wife and two children.\nHowever, insiders painted a more complicated picture of the family dynamic, which revealed their pulling together was a matter of more than just family loyalty. \n'After so long together, Steph and Phil are co-dependent. They would rather be a united front and stay together', an insider told Daily Mail in 2024, adding that if they broke up it would 'create even more drama' for them and their daughters.\nAnother friend said: 'They still love each other. It's that simple'. \nSchofield's career imploded as his infidelity with an ITV staff-member came to light, as did his once rock solid friendship with co-host Holly Willoughby, to whom he lied about the affair. \nJust four years earlier Willoughby had comforted the emotional presenter live on air as he confirmed his sexuality in a tearful address to millions of viewers, but the writing appeared to be on the wall after Schofield's infidelity was exposed. \n\nLoyal Stephanie remained a tower of strength for her under-fire husband (L-R: Molly Lowe, Phillip Schofield, Stephanie Lowe and Ruby Lowe on the red carpet in 2018)\n\n Phillip Schofield's daughter reveals her father is still 'best friends' with his wife Stephanie \nRegardless, loyal Stephanie remained a tower of strength for her under-fire husband.\n'I love Phillip, as much today as I ever have, and always will,' she told The Sun at the time. \n'We've been awestruck by the strength and love of our precious girls, even as they've been trying to make sense of it all for themselves. Our family have also been so supportive and will help us going forward.\n'Although this is difficult for us all, I support Phillip in taking this brave step. I will still be there, holding his hand. Everyone should be proud to live their own truth.'\nThe couple's enduring closeness was well in evidence last year, when the Schofields allowed Channel 5 cameras into their Oxfordshire home for his warts-and-all docuseries, Phillip Schofield: Cast Away. \nSchofield, facing an uncertain professional future after leaving This Morning under a ruinously black cloud, was tasked with the unenviable challenge of living alone on a remote tropical island for ten days, where he would 'face the challenges of life in isolation.' \nBut not before bidding farewell to his loved ones over a boozy lunch, during which viewers were given a unique insight into his relationship with Stephanie and their daughters. \n\nMolly, who now works as her father's publicist, insisted that he and his wife Stephanie are 'still best friend' (Stephanie is pictured on Phillip Schofield: Cast Away)\n\n'We've seen him in his lowest times, but I've been so proud of him, and as a daughter to see the love that people had for him that when it's taken away it's just heartbreaking,' said Molly, who now works as her father's publicist, in a scene from the show. \n'Weirdly everything that's happened recently has made us closer. When my dad came out, it was, it was very hard for me. \n'It was very hard for the entire family. Mainly my mum, of course, everything was turned upside down. But we talked through it and over time it's got easier.' \nShe added: 'My mum, my sister, we're all the same we will always continued to support him no matter what. And I never thought it would have gone the way it has but to have my parents still best friends. I'm the luckiest person ever.'\nIn the first episode, Schofield told how he had 'everything in place' for a suicide attempt, but decided against it when his eldest daughter Molly persuaded him not to. \nHe said: 'In the last eighteen months, it got as dark as it is possible to get. A year ago I got so, so close. I had everything in place, everything was set up and everything was ready and it was Molly that was looking after me.'\n\nSchofield was tasked with the unenviable challenge of living alone on a remote tropical island for ten days, where he would 'face the challenges of life in isolation'\n\nSchofield with his wife Stephanie on his62nd birthday weekend. The couple still wear their wedding rings\nHe explained: 'Molly and Ruby both looking after me at the time, and Molly said: 'Do you imagine what this would do to us if you actually managed to pull this off? \n'Can you imagine what would happen and can you imagine what it would do to me if you did this on my watch?'\n'That was just enough, just enough to take a step back from the edge. I could have been hospitalised, I just raced to the family home and shut the gates and I was in there.'\nHe later paid tribute to his wife, Molly and his youngest daughter Ruby, adding: 'Without them, I wouldn't be here.'\nSchofield's return to television on Cast Away cames 16 months after he was forced to apologise to the Mail for lying about his affair with his former This Morning colleague.\nBut during the programme, he addressed the relationship, saying: 'It's like the biggest grenade going off in your life. You know you let people down, you know you've let yourself down.\n'It was an unwise and unprofessional thing to do. I will be forever sorry. I screwed up. I made a mistake, and I hurt the people around me.'\nIndeed, but what now for the Schofields? If history has told us anything, it tells us that love, however flawed, can weather any storm. \nOnly time will tell if it lasts. \nPhillip SchofieldThis MorningITV\n\nShare or comment on this article: \nIs Phillip Schofield's bachelor lifestyle a sign that divorce is on the cards?

Metro Transit Police said they were patrolling the U Street area, seemingly as part of the Trump administration's initiative to crackdown on crime in the nation's capital, when a man later identified as Sean Charles Dunn shouted obscenities at a CBP agent, standing inches from his face and calling him a \"fascist.\" Moments later, police said Dunn returned, wound up, and \"forcefully threw\" a sandwich at the agent, hitting him in the chest, according to court documents. He then ran away, with a trail of federal officers chasing him. Witnesses could be heard giggling as Dunn darted from the cops, according to an Instagram video posted by a bystander.

But now the 'Tariff King' in the world is the United States because our average tariff is about 15.98%. The US tariff today is 18.4%. So, it is now the 'Tariff King' of the world. But the fact is, tariffs are bringing in money. They will bring in about a 100 billion dollars a year for the US. But the issue is that eventually who will pay for these tariffs? By American consumers. So, what's going to happen is this is going to ratchet up inflation in America, it's going to ratchet up prices in America. I think that's when the chickens will come home to roost,\" he said.\n\"If you cave in to a bully then the bully will increase his demands. Then there will be even more demands. So, I think we have done the right thing. India is too large, too proud a country to become a camp follower of any other country. Our strategic autonomy has been the bedrock of our foreign policy right from the 1950s. I don't think that any Govt in Delhi can compromise on that,\" says former diplomat Vikas Swarup on the tariff rift between India and the US,\" he added.

A few days later, he imposed another 25 per cent tariff, taking the total to 50 per cent, over India's imports of Russian oil.\nOn Opposition questioning India's Foreign Policy and diplomacy, Vikas Swarup said India should not cave in to any pressure as India's strategic autonomy is non-negotiable\n\"Here, I would not blame our diplomats at all. I think what has happened is Pakistan, through some intermediaries, has gotten the ear of the US President and that is why, two visits by Asim Munir to Washington, the so-called \"deal\" with America on so-called \"oil reserves\" of Pakistan. More importantly, I think Pakistan is now trying to position itself as the 'Crypto King' of South Asia and there, through World Liberty Financial in which Trump's family has stakes, Steve Witkoff's family has a stake, through that I think Pakistan has managed to project an image of itself as a reliable partner...All these things have led to Trump having a softer approach towards Pakistan,\" he said. \"But that does not mean that he has given up on India or that India is now an adversary for him. I think this is part of his pressure tactics to secure a more favourable deal. India should not cave in because our strategic autonomy is non-negotiable,\" he added.\nVikas Swarup, a noted author, said Trump has made no secret of his longing for the Nobel Peace Prize and while he is a dealmaker, he has now made it his USP that he is the peacemaker.\n\"On 50% tariffs imposed by the US on India, former diplomat Vikas Swarup says, \"Trump is a dealmaker and he has now made it his USP that he is the peacemaker. Look at the number of conflict situations that he has mediated in, whether it is Thailand and Combodia, Rawanda and Democratic Republic of Congo, Armenia and Azerbaijan; he has injected himself into each of those. He feels that the biggest one of these was the India and Pakistan one because these two are nuclear powers,\" Vikas Swarup said. \"So, from that point of view, Trump feels that he deserves credit and Obama is the only Amercian President to have got the Nobel Peace Prize. Trump really wants to do one better than Obama, and that is why, I think, he has made no secret of his longing for that Nobel Peace Prize. He is hoping that if he could not get it for these, if he has able to bring about a ceasefire between Russia and Ukraine, then that might be his ticket to the Nobel Peace Prize,\" he added.\nThe former diplomat said that there is a need to look at the US' relationship with Pakistan through a different lens from the US' relationship with India. \"I think the relationship with Pakistan right now is a very tactical one and is a short-term one, primarily motivated by the financial gain that the Trump family and Witkoff family hope to make from the cryptocurrency assets in Pakistan. With India, I think, the relationship is much more strategic. It is not so transactional as it is with Pakistan. That is why I personally feel that it is a passing phase. I call it a storm, not a rupture. You just have to wait out the storms. All storms eventually pass,\" he said.\nHe said there are three reasons US President Donald Trump has imposed 50 per cent tariffs on Indian goods including his \"being miffed that India has not acknowledged his role\" in cessation of hostilities with Pakistan following Operation Sindoor, former diplomat Vikas Swarup has said, noting that if there is positive outcome of Alaska talks, Russia sanctions will be off the table.\n\"We have to understand why these tariffs have been imposed. I personally feel that there are three reasons. One, Trump is not happy with India because we are a member of BRICS and somehow, in his head, he has got this notion that BRICS is an anti-America alliance which is hell-bent on creating an alternative currency to the dollar. So, because of that, he feels that India should not be a member of the BRICS. Two, Operation Sindoor and his so-called role in bringing about the ceasefire,\" Vikas Swarup said.\n\"We have been saying right from the beginning that Trump had no role because we do not accept external mediation. This ceasefire was mediated directly between the DGMOs of Pakistan and India at the request of the DGMO of Pakistan. Trump has now said almost 30 times that it was he who got the two countries to stop back from the brink, who stopped a nuclear conflagration in the subcontinent. So, obviously he is miffed that India has not acknowledged his role, whereas Pakistan has not only acknowledged his role but has even nominated him for a Nobel Peace Prize,\" he added.\nReferring to Bilateral Trade Agreement (BTA) talks between India and US, Vikas Swarup said Trump is resorting to pressure tactics to get India to sign on his maximalist demands. \"...This is part of his pressure tactics to get India to sign on the dotted line on the maximalist demands that the US is making with regard to access to our dairy and agriculture and GM Crops. We have not caved in and it is also in a way a signal to Russia because he is also frustrated that he has not been able to get President Putin to agree to the ceasefire that Zelenskyy has agreed to,\" he said.\nVikas Swarup referred to the summit meeting between President Trump and President Putin in Alaska on August 15 over the Ukraine conflict.\n\"Now they are meeting in Alaska on 15th August. If there is a positive outcome of the Alaska talks then I am 100% sure that the Russia sanctions will be off the table because Putin is not going to accept a ceasefire and yet be saddled with economic sanctions,\" he said.\nIndia and the US initiated talks for a just, balanced, and mutually beneficial Bilateral Trade Agreement (BTA) in March this year, aiming to complete the first stage of the Agreement by October-November 2025.On April 2, 2025, President Trump signed an executive order for reciprocal tariffs on various trade partners, imposing varied tariffs in the range of 10-50 per cent.\nHe subsequently kept the tariffs in abeyance for 90 days, while imposing a 10 per cent baseline tariff. The deadline was to end on July 9, and the US administration later pushed it to August 1.\nDuring the ongoing Monsoon session of Parliament, Commerce and Industry Minister Piyush Goyal made a statement in both Houses, affirming that the government is examining the impact of tariffs and will take all necessary steps to safeguard the national interest.

The Trump administration is scrutinizing the Smithsonian Institution ahead of America's 250th anniversary celebration next year, requiring specific national museums and affiliated exhibits to \"reflect the unity, progress, and enduring values that define the American story.\" The largely federally funded museum has been scrutinized in recent years for politically charged materials, such as criticizing \"White dominant culture.\" In a letter penned to Smithsonian Institution Secretary Lonnie Bunch III, Trump administration officials laid out a review process that the institution will undergo in order to ensure alignment with President Donald Trump's \"Restoring Truth and Sanity to American History\" executive order and remove \"divisive or partisan narratives\" in America’s shared cultural institutions. CNN NewsNight with Abby Phillip was sharply divided over the move, with Jennings arguing that for America’s upcoming 250th anniversary, \"It is of vital interest and importance to the White House that this celebration be pro-America.\" TRUMP WHITE HOUSE CALLS OUT SMITHSONIAN FOR PUSHING 'ONE-SIDED, DIVISIVE POLITICAL NARRATIVES' Panelists proceeded to debate whether the choice to emphasize America’s accomplishments and exceptionalism is an act of erasure or of emphasis, with one panelist arguing that when one views the National Air and Space Museum, they naturally would expect to see more focus on America’s Moon landing rather than the Challenger shuttle disaster of 1986. \"This is very Russia-coded,\" commentator S.E. Cupp argued, comparing this review to Russian overhauls of Ukrainian museums. She was later pressed on whether monuments depicting Italian explorer Christopher Columbus should be taken down and replied, \"Well I’m Italian, I’m proud of Columbus.\" \"Yeah, the last time we sort of talked about the changing of historical exhibits was when all these angry mobs all over the country tore down historical statues all over the place, and the people who seem to be angriest about the Smithsonian review were cheering that on,\" Jennings argued. Rep. Maxwell Frost, D-Fla, challenged him, accusing Jennings of refusing to condemn politicians for \"editing our history.\" In return, Jennings rejected the idea that politicians were doing so. TRUMP WHITE HOUSE CALLS OUT SMITHSONIAN FOR PUSHING 'ONE-SIDED, DIVISIVE POLITICAL NARRATIVES America has been sharply divided in recent years over how to teach history to younger generations. One major example was the 1619 project, an initiative by The New York Times' Nikole Hannah-Jones, which purports that 1619, the year the first enslaved Africans were brought to what would later become the United States, should be considered the true founding year of the country. The project’s materials were integrated into school curriculums across the country and treated as a factual historical narrative, despite the fact it was challenged by historians for inaccuracies. In the past few years, particularly after statutes of Confederate leaders had sparked controversy or been dismantled, a move praised by Democrats, protesters went on to vandalize other figures from American history, such as Thomas Jefferson, George Washington and Ulysses S. Grant. Years after Trump condemned protesters for attempting to take down a statute of President Andrew Jackson in the nation's capital, Democrats pushed the Andrew Jackson Statue Removal Act to try to have it taken down by the federal government. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP New York City politician and Democratic mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani recently faced scrutiny in July for appearing to call for the destruction of a statue of Columbus. When riots took place across the country following George Floyd’s death, Mamdani posted a photo of what appears to be his hand flipping off a statue of Christopher Columbus and said \"Take it down.\" In July 2020, the Smithsonian’s National Museum of African American History and Culture released a controversial graphic showing guidelines for talking about race which vilified the \"Aspects and assumptions of Whiteness and White culture in the United States.\" These ranged from the largely Anglo-protestant values of American settlers such as \"rugged individualism\" to emphasizing \"Barbie\" as the essence of female beauty to White people. In what was widely mocked as patronizing to Black Americans, it was also argued that to believe in \"delayed gratification,\" to \"plan for the future,\" to practice \"rational linear thinking,\" and to \"follow rigid time schedules\" are also specifically White American values.","summary":"CNN&apos;s Scott Jennings argued many critics of Trump&apos;s Smithsonian review are hypocritical for previously cheering monument destruction during 2020 protests.","url":"https://www.foxnews.com/media/cnns-jennings-says-same-critics-trumps-smithsonian-review-were-cheering-destruction-monuments-2020","image":"https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2025/08/smithsonian-institution-building.png","video":"https://www.foxnews.com/video/6376891434112","publish_date":"2025-08-14 00:02:07","author":"Alexander Hall","authors":["Alexander Hall"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.121},{"id":350865668,"title":"Photoshop these glasshouse water lilies [Photoshop]","text":"Skip to content\n\nTry Ads-Free Fark\n\nIt's Not News, It's Fark\n\nHow To FarkLog In | Sign Up »\n\nForgot password?\n\n Turn on javascript (or enable it for Fark) for a better user experience.\n\nIf you can read this, either the style sheet didn't load or you have an older browser that doesn't support\nstyle sheets.

But their hopes of finding newfound freedom ended in misery\nBefore agreeing to buy the caravan, Samantha and Lushana claim they were given assurances that it would be ok to leave their dogs unattended in the caravan. \n'We made sure that our dogs were ok to be left alone in the caravan with occasional help from a dog-sitter,' Samantha explained. \n'We chose our site, number 14 for two reasons, firstly that's my birthday and secondly we were told that was a particularly well protected location in case of any flooding.'\nThe couple were aware the park had flooded before, but were told Meadow Bay - Billing Aquadrome's parent company - were investing £12 million in the park and flood protection 'was the top spending priority'.\n'We confirmed that our annual site fees included: rates and water; grounds maintenance and landscaping; park security; street lighting; office admin; and access to the indoor heated swimming pool, bars and restaurants, fishing lakes and owner events,' Samantha continued.\n'We had heard horror stories of some parks increasing annual fees to £10,000 a year or more and sought assurances that this would not happen here.' She was told that while there wouldn't be any specific limits on increases, they would be minimal.\n'Finally we confirmed that we could live permanently in the caravan. We've all seen the stories about people who bought a static caravan to live in, only to be told later that it could only be used as a holiday stay.'\nSamantha says they were told they could live in the park legally for 11 months a year, as it had to close for a month 'as a kind of loophole to allow people to live there permanently outside of those weeks'. \n\nSamantha (pictured) said she and her partner have since moved out of park but are still having to pay more than £2,000 a month to pay back loans \n\nPiled up garbage at Billing Aquadrome, which the couple described as a 'run down slum'\nTheir concerns seemingly addressed, Samantha and Lushana completed the agreement and moved in. \nBut before they were even able to do so, the couple were dealt the first of many disappointing blows.\n'We were waiting for the caravan to be installed when we were given the paperwork, which we had not seen completed copies of until this point,' Samantha said. \n'Our first shock was to discover that not only were dogs forbidden to be left unattended in a caravan, but any person minding a dog had to be over 18 years old.\n'This would have been a deciding factor in us buying the caravan as the only dog-sitter we knew was 17 years old.\n'Already upset, we went to plot number 14 to inspect our newly installed caravan. It was installed on plot 13.\n'We were unhappy about this as not only are we superstitious, but had chosen 14 because of my birthday as well as the very salient fact that it was sold to us as being better sited for flood defence.'\nFrom then on, their issues seemingly became never-ending. \n\nThe caravan parks also flooded while the couple were living there, despite being told the park owner would be investing in flood defenses\n'Despite our own small dogs not being allowed to be alone even inside the caravan, or minded by a 17 year old, there were terrifying XL bully dogs roaming unattended around the site. \n'We needed to put up skirting around our caravan to keep the dangerous dogs out of our area, but were told this was not allowed unless we paid the park £2700 to do it for us.\n'The ground rent has already gone up by £500 in the first year. It is now £5100 for 2025. We can not afford increases like this. \n'Also we soon discovered that rates and water are not included in the annual fees, which increases the annual costs even further.'\nSamantha claimed the promise of an indoor swimming pool has also been abandoned as it rarely open. As for security and maintenance, it was practically non-existent, she said.\n'There are overgrown hedges and uncut grass everywhere, as well as piles of garbage, dog excrement, duck excrement and other litter all over the park. \n'The 'street lighting' does not work except for one individual light at the end of the park. The road is pitch black at night, and can not be walked without torches.\n'The annual fee is supposed to include on-park security, yet there were multiple reports of XL bully dog attacks around the park, some resulting in fatalities to other dogs.'\n\nBilling Aquadrome has previously had issues with flooding. It is pictured surrounded by water after a storm last year\n\nA car sits in floodwater at the Billing Aquadrome holiday park, Northamptonshire, after flooding caused 43 residents to evacuate in September 2024\n'We have also personally witnessed terrifying scenes of people dressed in black, wearing balaclavas and threatening people in cars with machetes. \n'Since one such event, my partner Lushana has suffered from severe mental health issues requiring long-term professional care.'\nAnd despite assurances that Meadow Bay were investing in flood prevention measures, the park has indeed flooded - with the water stopping just metres from their door in one instance. \nEven the caravan itself has not lived up to the standards that they hoped, with badly fitted doors, leaking taps and cheap and dangerous front steps.\n'The steps were nothing like the brand new, high quality ones we were shown on the sales presentation. They were slippery, had gaps and they sank into the ground when it rained. \n'Lushana injured herself slipping on the steps. We complained to the office, but were simply told: 'tough, you won't be getting the good steps.'\n'The caravan design company eventually sent someone to fix the issues, and he confirmed that the fixtures were bodged. We began to question whether our caravan was even a new one.'\nThe couple discovered that they were contractually obliged to buy gas directly from the park at £98 per canister, despite it being much cheaper elsewhere. They also were forbidden from erecting even a portable clothes dryer outside.\n\nThe caravan park was also covered in rubbish and other debris despite being told there was a round the clock maintenance team clearing up the site\n\nBreeze blocks, metal pipes and other various rubbish items are strewn across the grass close to the couple's caravan site\n'The 'garden' was a patch of uneven grass with a huge, mud circle where a plastic table had been,' Samantha continued. \n'There was an old satellite dish half embedded in the ground, and when they did cut the nettles, they left them in a heap together with old plastic bottles, crisp packets and other rubbish in a storm drain at the back of our caravan.'\n'Any time we complained about any of the issues, we were met with hostility, aggression and even swearing from angry staff members who came banging on our door.'\nSamantha and Lushana have since enquired about selling the less-than-one-year-old caravan back to the park, but were told that the most Meadow bay could offer was only £20,000.\n'That price would not come close even to covering the outstanding debt payments we have on the caravan,' Samantha explained.\n'This has destroyed us. All our money has gone. The caravan is standing empty but still costing us over £2000 a month in fees and loans to pay back. \n'We have had to move back in with my family in London and thanks to these stressful events at Billing Aquadrome, Lushana still requires professional medical help and is only just starting to recover.\n'Billing Aquadrome has turned out to be nothing but a run down slum. We were sold a dream and bought a nightmare.'\nThey are now seeking advice for European Consumer Claims which is spearheading a national campaign for accountability within the holiday park sector.\nGreg Wilson, ECC CEO, said: 'For some time ECC have been lobbying for changes in the law to make holiday park businesses both more strictly regulated and accountable.\n'So far, successive governments have refused, saying that people should rely on the Consumer Credit Act for protection. However for most people this is an expensive and often ineffective way to seek redress without expert help.\n'ECC remains staunchly at the forefront of this national fight for holiday park justice.'\nThe Mail has contacted Meadow Bay for comment. \n\nShare or comment on this article: \nOur £48k caravan park hell: Couple face financial ruin after buying first home on 'rundown slum' site plagued with XL Bullies, machete-wielding thugs and flooding\n\nAdd comment\n\n Share what you think\n\nNo comments have so far been submitted.

This would signal a thaw in relations with the neighbour amid heightening tensions with the US and the clamour from Indian industry to expedite imports of essential inputs from China. Consultations between representatives of the two countries are likely to take place later this month, around the time of Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s visit for the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) summit, scheduled to be held in Tianjin from August 31 to September 1, the people said. “The top three items on the agenda for discussion are rare earth magnets, fertilisers and pharmaceuticals,” a senior official told ET.FinanceValue and Valuation Masterclass - Batch 4By CA Himanshu JainArtificial IntelligenceAI For Business Professionals Batch 2By Ansh MehraFinanceValue and Valuation Masterclass - Batch 3By CA Himanshu JainArtificial Intelligence AI For Business ProfessionalsBy Vaibhav SisinityFinanceValue and Valuation Masterclass - Batch 2By CA Himanshu JainFinanceValue and Valuation Masterclass Batch-1By CA Himanshu JainWhile outreach has begun, supplies of rare earth magnets and all fertilisers are yet to resume from China. India mandates government approval for investment by countries that have a border with it, a measure specifically aimed at its northern neighbour. That’s against the backdrop of an escalation in tensions over the past five years, including border skirmishes and China’s support for Pakistan. China announced export controls on medium and heavy rare earth-related items on April 4, with a view to “safeguarding national security” in response to US President Donald Trump’s tariffs, citing end-use norms. Possible talks with Beijing assume significance in light of the 50% tariff that Trump has imposed on Indian exports.Live Events The US has deferred tariffs on China by 90 days. Rare earth magnets are essential for a wide range of products, but especially for electric vehicles. While China has resumed shipments of rare earth magnets to companies in the US, Europe and Southeast Asia, export licences are yet to be issued to vendors supplying to India. “Individual clearances for importing these items have not come so far,” said one of the persons. “Negotiations will now start between the two countries for a trade package.” Beijing had also halted shipments of urea and some other fertilisers to India in the last three months. It has begun the process of easing restrictions on supplies of just urea to the country. “Tenders for import of urea from China have been floated,” said a top executive of a fertiliser company. This indicates China is agreeable to sending some amount of the fertiliser to India. State trading enterprises, which import urea from China on behalf of the Indian government, have started floating tenders for the import of a limited quantity of the crop nutrient. While there is no talk about specialty fertilisers, discussions are likely going ahead, people aware of developments said. China had also stopped shipments of specialty fertilisers such as calcium nitrate and mono ammonium phosphate. India imports about 80% of these chemicals from China. A global supplier of agricultural inputs, Beijing has, however, been exporting them to other countries. LOOKING AHEAD Meanwhile, both India and China are concerned about the looming trade imbalance in pharmaceuticals. Trump’s proposed tariff on finished drugs — 250% over the next one and a half years — stands to disrupt the industry in both countries. The commerce ministry has called for a meeting ahead of the SCO summit with top representatives from the pharmaceutical industry to discuss, among other issues, ways to collaborate and strengthen ties with China as part of broader cooperation. Industry watchers told ET the contours of the discussions have not been disclosed yet, but these may include mitigation plans against the backdrop of US tariffs. “While pharmaceutical exports from India have been thus far exempt from the 50% US tariffs, future risks cannot be ruled out,” an industry expert told ET.(You can now subscribe to our Economic Times WhatsApp channel)\n\nRead More News onBeijing trade packageTrump tariffsrare earth magnetsIndia China relationsIndia China trade negotiationspharmaceutical importsfertiliser imports\n\n(Catch all the Business News, Breaking News, Budget 2025 Events and Latest News Updates on The Economic Times.)

But the question remains: will recognition by France, the UK, and Canada actually stop the Israeli bombard-ment and lift the food blockade? Could this be an emotional, knee-jerk decision rather than a strategically calculated move?\n\nIn response to Medvedev’s perceived threat, President Trump has ordered U.S. nuclear submarines into strategic positions, further heightening global tensions. Realizing that Trump may be serious about his threat to im-pose more sanctions and punish the nations that breach the sanctions, Russian President Vladmir Putin has now agreed to a meeting with President Trump in Alaska next Friday, 15th August.\n\nIndia that is accused of buying Russian oil in breach of sanctions, has been hit with a steep tariff by the Trump administration. Similarly, a higher tariff has been imposed on Canada for its plan to recognize Palestine.\n\nClearly, Trump is leveraging economic se-curity to strengthen national security—penal-izing India for buying Russian oil and Canada for aligning with France and the UK as well as Australia on Palestinian recognition. The UK, however, has been spared harsher measures, benefiting from a baseline tariff of only 10%, reportedly due to the positive influence of King Charles during Trump’s recent visit to his golf courses in Ireland. France, by contrast, faces a significantly higher tariff than the UK.\n\nTariffs have also been increased to 40% for about 30 countries deemed to have made in-sufficient efforts to negotiate new trade terms with the U.S. The shifting of the 90-day tariff pause deadline from July 9 to August 1—al-lowing more time for compliance—along with Trump’s discretionary tariff use, reinforces that America First does not mean America Alone.\n\nAs U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent ex-plained, America First means the U.S. is ready to trade with the rest of the world—but only on the basis of new tariff rates the U.S. deems fair, in reciprocity to what American goods and services face abroad. Historically, the U.S. vol-untarily accepted less favorable trade terms as part of its “big brother” role in global affairs. Under Trump, this “do-good” approach is be-ing replaced with reciprocal tariffs—disrupt-ing the established trade order and, potentially, reshaping the global order entirely.\n\nThe U.S. is not alone in facing unfair trade. Africa has long been stunted by inequitable trade practices imposed by its former colo-nizers since the Berlin Conference of 1884–85, where the continent was partitioned without African leaders at the table. Since the 15th cen-tury—through slavery, colonialism, imperial-ism, neo-colonialism, and now debt traps—Af-rica has been exploited. Unfair trade remains the latest manifestation of this exploitation.\n\nThis is a yoke the continent must break, and Trump’s effort to restructure the 80-year-old global trade order via sweeping tariffs pres-ents a rare opportunity for Africa to negotiate better terms. Africa’s leaders should leverage Trump’s justification for reciprocal tariffs to demand fairer trade arrangements, which would address one of the root causes of the continent’s extreme poverty.\n\nFor too long, Africa has been treated as a source of unprocessed raw materials and a dumping ground for finished products. The continent’s leaders must embrace global trade reforms rather than remain passive, lest they become complicit in its continued underde-velopment.\n\nU.S. Senator Bernie Sanders recently re-marked that “status quo politics is no longer tenable” in America. While speaking about U.S. domestic politics, this sentiment can be applied globally. Trump’s disruption of the old world order—particularly in trade and tariffs—aligns with Sanders’ progressive worldview.\n\nIf equity and justice are still central to de-mocracy, it is time to give Africa a fair chance by intentionally reviewing global trade with the continent. As traditional U.S. partners struggle to meet its new expectations, Africa could fill the gap. The continent’s current in-frastructure deficits—one of the main deter-rents to manufacturing investment—could be addressed through U.S. cooperation, much like China’s transformation into the world’s manufacturing hub following U.S. diplomatic engagement in the 1970s.\n\nTrump’s initial 145% tariff hike on China was indeed a shock to the global system. But af-ter high-level negotiations, rates were reduced to more sustainable levels—yet another exam-ple that America First does not mean America Alone. Trump, a master negotiator, used the high tariff as a starting point, anticipating that nations would resist at first but ultimately en-gage in talks, hence the offer of a 90-day pause.\n\nThe U.S. had also threatened to impose a 50% tariff on the EU from June 1, after pausing earlier retaliatory rates. When the EU sought a resolution, the deadline was moved to July 9, which has now expired. With little progress in negotiations and accusations that the EU is being overly rigid, the U.S. had reinstated the 50% tariff which it later withdrew.\n\nEurope’s tough bargaining is unsurpris-ing. The EU had previously retaliated against the U.S. tariffs announced in April but pulled back at the last moment, leaving China iso-lated in the trade conflict. China, the world’s second-largest economy, eventually negotiated a reprieve in Geneva, easing tensions with the U.S. The EU narrowly avoided a similar con-frontation by securing a pause.\n\nTo prevent the activation of Trump’s new tariff threat to Europe, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen has assured, “Europe is ready to advance talks swiftly and decisively.” She recently added that Europe is working toward meeting the new August 1 deadline and she actually met the deadline.\n\nThe rapprochement is unsurprising be-cause the volume of trade between the US and the EU is currently about $606 billion. That is much larger than the combined value of US trade with its northern neighbors—Mexico and Canada—and even bigger than the com-bined trade between the US, China, and Japan.\n\nSo far, nine countries have signed agree-ments already. The UK was granted only a 10% tariff rate—seen as a gesture of deference by President Trump to the King of England— while Brazil was hit with a 50% tariff, South Korea with 15%, and India with 25%, the latter also sanctioned with additional 25% for buying oil from Russia despite global sanctions related to its ongoing invasion of Ukraine.\n\nAhead of the deadline, Europe, South Ko-rea, India, and a few other nations negotiated new tariff rates with the US, which have risen from a flat 10% to between 15% and 50%. In fact, Trump’s tariffs have raised rates to their highest levels since the Great Depression. And all things being equal the huge deficit current-ly weighing the economy down may be on a balancing trajectory.\n\nCritics initially believed he would fail in this tariff war, fearing it would negatively im-pact the US economy and the rest of the world would ignore him. Yet, despite the trade battles, US GDP rose to 3%. Skeptics, however, argue that manufacturers and retailers have been holding off on passing costs to consumers, which is why Americans have yet to feel the pain. That fear remains an imagination as the US economy is not showing signs of going into a recession as projected.\n\nIn what seems like desperate efforts to se-cure favorable trade terms, presidents of some nations that he has slammed reciprocal tariffs are running helter skelter and others are rush-ing off to Washington, uninvited to the White House trying to curry Trump’s favor.\n\nOne thing is certain: Trump has profoundly reshaped the global trade landscape, wielding economic policy as a tool of national security. He has even threatened higher tariffs on Cana-da for its plans to recognize Palestine—follow-ing the example of France, the UK, Canada, and most recently, Australia.\n\nClearly, the whole world is now metaphor-ically dancing to the tune being dictated by President Trump leveraging economic secu-rity to achieve global security.\n\nUndeniably, Trump is turning out to be one of the world’s greatest reformers. Irrespective of the fact that his reforms were initially derid-ed and rejected by Americans and indeed crit-ics across the world who felt that his reforms were capable of disrupting the old world order and would spell doom for humankind.\n\nAs things currently stand, if Trump ends the Russia-Ukraine war and brings peace to the Middle East by resolving the Israeli-Hamas horrific bloodshed leveraging his unconven-tional method of using economic security to achieve global security, as Christina Aguilera, a US song writer, noted: “The roughest road often leads to the top.”\n\nWhat the statement above suggests is that meaningful reform often requires difficult choices and hard work but ultimately leads to a more prosperous and resilient nation.\n\nAccording to Kofi Annan, former UN Sec-retary General, “Reform is a process, and not an event.” That wise admonition underscores the idea that reform is an ongoing process that requires effort and dedication, rather than a single event or decision.”\n\nFurthermore, the perspective offered by Catherine the Great, empress of Russia from 1762-1796, known for her impressive reign and cultural achievements: “It is better to inspire a reform than to enforce it,” is quite instructive in the current circumstances. It suggests that inspiring reform can be more effective than forcing it, highlighting the importance of lead-ership and vision in driving positive change.\n\nCircling back to Nigeria, and drawing a parallel between reformist President Trump of the US and President Bola Tinubu who has engaged in reforms since he took office on May 29, 2023, is a little over two years ago, reformers always face resistance, humans often fear the unknown and are always happy to remain in their comfort zones.\n\nHence, it is unsurprising that Tinubu’s re-forms were greeted with cynicism by some Nigerians weary of a period of failed govern-ment promises of a better life by previous ad-ministrations.\n\nEnding over four decades long fuel and sub-sidy, boosting the foreign exchange reserve in the Central Bank of Nigeria, CBN, from $34 billion in 2023 to $40 billion this year and in-creasing the funds going to the states for the development of the rural areas by governors sometimes as much as threefold, and the boost in non-oil exports by as much as $3.225 billion are some positive outcomes of Tinubu’s re-forms. All of these have resulted in the stabi-lization of the naira enhanced by the boost in crude oil production which has climbed from a low of roughly 1.3 million barrels per day in 2023 to about 1.8 million this year not forgetting the stability of the naira which cures business uncertainty.\n\nBut, as encouraging as these outlined devel-opments are, due to skepticism arising from the hardship associated with the reforms, Tinubu is not being given the flowers that he should have been receiving.\n\nThe question is: By the time he completes his reforms and term in office, would President Donald J Trump be the new President George Washington of America in terms of positive and consequential impact?\n\nAnd would President Bola Tinubu leave a type of positive legacy in the manner that Nel-son Mandela left huge positive imprints in the sands of time in South Africa?\n\nGiven the rainbow forming on the horizon in the US, the world, and Nigeria through the reform efforts of Trump regarding the US and the world through sweeping trade tariff chang-es, and Tinubu in Nigeria who has ended en-trenched obnoxious policies respectfully, one cannot help but be optimistic about a better lease of life awaiting the world, Americans and Nigerians.\n\n• Magnus Onyibe, an entrepreneur, public policy analyst, author, democracy advocate, development strategist, and alumnus of the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy, Tufts University, Massachusetts, USA, is a Common-wealth Institute scholar and a former commis-sioner in the Delta State government.

I'd get home and prance around the house.' \nDaily Mail has contacted Dani's representatives and BBC for comment.\nDani, who wed husband Jarrod Bowen this year, shot to fame in 2018 on the ITV2 dating show when she bagged the £50k prize with Jack Fincham.\nSpeaking about taking part in the new series of Strictly, Dani said: 'Getting the opportunity to be on Strictly is the second most amazing thing I've done this year!\n'I feel very very blessed and cannot wait to get my dancing shoes on.'\nShe joins a host of stars in the lineup which also includes actress Alex Kingston, 62, former footballer Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink, 53, trailblazing Down syndrome model Ellie Goldstein, 23, and Harry Aikines-Aryeetey, 36.\nStrictly's new series has been hit by a string of scandals in the lead-up to its return, including revelations that the broadcaster had hired a law firm to probe allegations of drug taking by two individuals.\n\nThe daughter of acting legend Danny Dyer said in her 2019 book that she would put 'qualified dancer' under the list of qualifications on her CV\nOne of the stars involved in the drugs probe was also suspected of drinking while working on the show after crew smelt alcohol on their breath.\nThe Sun alleged that it was widely known that the pair, who have not been named, took the Class A substance, and that one of these Strictly performers was known for being a drinker.\nThe publication have now reported that junior members of the team were asked to keep an eye on them during last year's show and to look for signs that they may have been boozing during work hours.\nOver the weekend, a staffer also claimed they were offered cocaine by one of the show's stars.\nHe told The Sun: 'The main partying is on site at Elstree after filming of the live show has finished. Boozing and drug taking goes on until 3am, sometimes 4am. The smoking area outside is a hive of activity. Cocaine gets taken there'.\nHe went on to claim that drug use was so common on the show, that when he found a suspicious bag of white powder, an unfazed senior producer told him to 'leave it on my desk' as the incident failed to raise even an eyebrow.\nThe staff member also said the show's annual special filmed at the Blackpool Tower Ballroom was an especially 'big party night' full of debauchery.\n'I was offered cocaine by a star at an after show party. Lots of people would go back to the hotel. It was a closed-off party, just for the cast and crew. It went on until 5am, even to 6am, it was insane. People were wired and you could see it in their eyes'.\n\nDani shot to fame in 2018 on the ITV2 dating show when she bagged the £50k prize with Jack Fincham (pictured together)\n\nDani wed husband Jarrod Bowen this year\n\n Love Island winner, Doctor Who star and footballing legend confirmed for Strictly Come Dancing 2025 \nA BBC spokesperson told Daily Mail: 'We have clear protocols and policies in place for dealing with any serious complaint raised with us. We would always encourage people to speak to us if they have concerns. It would not be appropriate for us to comment further.'\nThe shock allegations come amid a long period of controversy for the BBC and Strictly over the past year or so.\nIn July last year, more than six months after quitting the show citing 'personal reasons', actress Amanda Abbington accused pro dancer Giovanni Pernice of 'unnecessary, cruel and mean behaviour' during their time dancing together on Strictly.\nGiovanni rejected the claims immediately, and a BBC investigation ruled in September that her claims of physical aggression and threatening behaviour were not upheld.\nWhen BBC bosses published their report into Giovanni's behaviour, it cleared him of the most serious allegations of physical aggression, but upheld verbal bullying and harassment.\nComplaints of verbal bullying and harassment meant the BBC issued an apology to Amanda, but Giovanni said he was 'pleased the report has not found any evidence of threatening or abusive behaviour'.\nElsewhere, the show was plunged into crisis after Welsh opera singer Wynne Evans made a controversial joke during his time preparing for the Strictly tour in January.\nHe used a vile sexual innuendo and was also caught up in a 'wandering hand' incident with dance partner Katya Jones , who seemed to remove his arm from her lower waist on the show.\n\nStrictly has been hit by a string of scandals in the lead-up to its return, including revelations that the broadcaster had hired a law firm to probe allegations of drug taking by two individuals \nAfter the BBC launched an investigation into his conduct, bosses decided not to renew his radio contract for his show.\nThe TV star confirmed in May that they will not be renewing his one-year rolling contract following a four-month investigation after the inappropriate comments made during his time on Strictly.\nElsewhere, in further scandals for the BBC, Gregg Wallace was recently dismissed from MasterChef after more than 40 complaints against him were upheld following a BBC investigation.\nWhile his co-star John Torode was also sacked after two decades over allegations that he used the N-word, which he claims to have 'absolutely no recollection' of.\nIn separate further controversy, it's recently been reported that Naga Munchetty could face an investigation from BBC bosses after she was accused of bullying a junior colleague.\nThe BBC Breakfast host, 50, has been placed 'under review' while bosses consider escalating complaints to a formal investigation, The Sun reports.\nA source said higher-ups had heard from several colleagues and logged concerns over her 'hard' and 'bullying' behaviour on the breakfast show, as well as her Radio 5 Live show.\n\nSTRICTLY LINEUP 2025\n\nHarry Aikines-Aryeetey\n\nProfession: Olympic Sprinter and Gladiator\nHarry says: 'I'll be bringing tons of energy to light up the dance floor.

Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Democratic House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, and Mamdani, highlighting Mamdani’s pronouncements, like being “unapologetic about our socialism” and advocating for the “abolition of private property.”\n\nREAD MORE: Mamdani Wants Gov’t-Run Grocery Stores in NYC. Here’s How Well That’s ‘Working’ in Kansas City.\n\nMamdani’s Affordable Housing Plan Doomed to Fail\n\n#BREAKING: Project 2026 serves as the policy framework for Hakeem Jeffries & the Democrats, featuring ideas like police defunding, open borders, impeaching Trump, tax increases on workers & families, and a full socialist agenda.\nDemocrats would turn America into a socialist, crime-filled dystopia pic.twitter.com/dJKrNuiuUw\n— NRCC (@NRCC) August 13, 2025\n\n“Hakeem Jeffries’ plan to remake America,” the ad kicked off. “Raise taxes on working families, impeach President [Donald] Trump.”\n\nJeffries is featured in one clip stating the need for “Donald Trump to be removed from office,” whilst Dem. Rep. Dina Titus expresses, “I’d like to impeach the bastard right now.”\n\nThe ad continues with visuals of “open the border” chaos under former President Joe Biden, with a message suggesting Democrats aim to “restart the invasion” of illegal immigration, signaling their potential agenda if they regain power.\n\nAdditional footage includes AOC and Dem. Rep. Gabe Vasquez calling for the abolition of ICE and defunding the police, respectively. The ad proceeds with scenes of rioting and looting, showing glimpses from the Los Angeles anti-ICE protests earlier this year.\n\n“Chip at it aggressively until we can unravel the whole system,” went another clip of Jeffries.\n\nIt concluded with a message about how the Democrats want to “turn America into a socialist, crime-filled dystopia…..” Are you going to let them?”\n\nNRCC spokesman Mike Marinella told Fox News Digital, “This is the America Democrats want to build: Raising taxes for working families, baseless impeachments, wide open borders, abolishing ICE, defunding the police, and turning America into a socialist, crime-filled dystopia. House Republicans are the only thing standing between you and the nightmare of ‘Project 2026.'”\n\nAs RedState’s Bonchie reported, Mamdani’s radical plans to take over the food chain with government-owned grocery stores, and his comment about seizing “the means of production” are right out of the communist rule book.\n\nBonchie wrote:\n\nThere is no more fundamental aspect of communism than seizing the means of production. So, how do you think noted fact-checking outlet Politifact handled this issue? Did they do a deep dive into Mamdani’s past to give an honest assessment of his ideology? Of course not. They just declared it false to say he’s a communist, even though he’s absolutely, without a doubt, by his own admission, a communist. \n\nSEE: Liz Warren Gets Schooled After Going All-In for Mamdani’s Socialism Plans: ‘They Will Leave’\n\n Carville Sounds Alarm About ‘Gift To Republicans’ Of Socialist Mayoral Primary Victory\n\nAnd my RedState colleague Becky Noble recently reported on how government-run grocery stores are not some new experiment and have been a disaster everywhere they’ve been tried, even right here in the U.S.\n\nShe reported on how a city-run grocery store in Kansas City attempted to address so-called “food deserts” and has failed miserably.\n\nMany of the store’s shelves were only partially stocked or not stocked at all. That includes the produce, meat, and dry goods with which the store was supposed to alleviate the need in the neighborhood. As far as prices go, one shopper said that the prices were better compared to other stores, but another stated the obvious: there is hardly anything on many of the store’s shelves. \n\nThese are the reasons veteran Democrat strategists, like James Carville, have warned that the party is going down a dangerous path with Mamdani. And Republicans have warned voters that socialism/communism is what the Democratic Party is selling.\n\nHelp us continue exposing Democrats’ plans to lead America down a dangerous path.

Email tips@dailymail.com \nBy CHRISTINE RENDON, US SENIOR REPORTER \n Published:00:23 BST, 14 August 2025 |Updated:00:54 BST, 14 August 2025 \n\nShe was unable to contain her smile as she worked with Joshua Jackson last week.\nBut Katie Holmes was looking glum as she returned to the set of Happy Hours on Monday. \nThe Dawson's Creek star, 46, was not exactly embodying the name of her film as she chatted with Joshua during a scene shot outside of the Dear Strangers restaurant in Greenwich Village.\nThe latest day of filming comes days after Joshua sparked romance rumors with Bridgerton star Simone Ashley. \nIt seemed as though nothing could break Katie's concentration as she brought her vision to life. \nKatie, 47, was in full filmmaker mode as she chatted with her former co-star, even gesturing to make a point.\n\nKatie Holmes was looking glum as she as she directed Joshua Jackson in New York City on Monday\n\n It seems nothing could break her concentration\n\nIt's a contrast from the considerably more giddy display she put on last week \nJoshua listened on intently, his hand rubbing his chin with a studious flourish.\nKatie, hair piled up into a messy bun, wore a bright red button down shirt and graphic T-shirt tucked into a belted pair of jeans.\n\n Katie Holmes lights up around ex Joshua Jackson as fans think she is 'still in love with him' \nJoshua opted for a graphic T-shirt, jeans, and leather footwear with a handy watch on his wrist.\nKatie was able to lighten up at one point, as she cracked a smile while enjoying a Diet Coke break.\nAs the director, writer, and one of the stars of the film, Katie certainly has a lot on her plate when it comes to this particular project. \nThis new movie certainly isn't the first time Katie and Joshua have worked together - they famously starred in the hit high school series Dawson's Creek, which aired from 1998 to 2002.\nThe pair even dated in real life, from 1998 to 1999. \nLast week Katie couldn't have looked any happier working with Joshua on set - a trait that did not go unnoticed by various netizens. \nThe googly eyes were not for a movie scene: Holmes was sizzling when the cameras were off too as they were seen on a busy sidewalk.\n\nThe actress-turned-director was fully engrossed in conversation with her cast member\n\nKatie opted for bright red button down and belted jeans for her day of filmmaking\n\nBut she did crack a smile as she enjoyed a Diet Coke break\nThe chemistry was palpable as they looked at each other and joked around while chatting with the crew.\nOne fan said of the bubbly mood Katie - who has daughter Suri Cruise, 19, with ex-husband Tom Cruise - displayed around Joshua: 'She looks like she is still in love with him.' \nAnother chimed in: 'She has the feels for this dude, can't blame her, he is certainly cute!' Then there was this: 'I am in love with how in love she is with Pacey.'\nOne also wrote: 'This dude needs to put a ring on it ASAP: Katie is the catch of the century. You won't find better.'\nBut Joshua has since sparked romance rumors with someone else. \nThe actor was spotted getting cozy with the actress Simone Ashley over the weekend.\n\nThe filmmaker gestured to make her point \n\nHolmes previously worked with Jackson on their hit high school series Dawson's Creek, and they even dated\n\nIt comes after Joshua sparked romance rumors with Bridgerton star Simone Ashley\nThe Affair star was pictured strolling with the 30-year-old Bridgerton actress on Saturday in New York City. \nJackson and Ashley were spending time together two years after his divorce from Jodie Turner-Smith, with whom he shares his five-year-old daughter Juno.\nAshley more recently got out of a relationship, as she revealed in February of this year that she and Constantin Klein had split after nearly three years together.\nJoshua JacksonKatie HolmesBridgerton\n\nShare or comment on this article: \nKatie Holmes looks glum on set with Joshua Jackson after he sparked romance rumors with Bridgerton star\n\nAdd comment\n\n Share what you think\n\nWorst rated\n\nThe comments below have not been moderated.\n\nThe views expressed in the contents above are those of our users and do not necessarily reflect the views of MailOnline.\n\nAdd your comment\n\nEnter your comment\n\nBy posting your comment you agree to our house rules.\n\nSubmit Comment\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual.\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual\n\nWe will automatically post your comment and a link to the news story to your Facebook timeline at the same time it is posted on MailOnline.

During the event, Texas state Rep. Gene Wu, who is chair of the Texas House Democratic Caucus, said that by fleeing the state to deny a voting quorum in the Texas House, his caucus is \"blocking a racist, unconstitutional and illegal gerrymandering effort.\" He said the AWOL Democrats are also \"stopping the DC swamp from dictating who we get to vote for.\" GOV. ABBOT STILL BEAT NEWSOM IN DISASTER RELIEF DESPITE TEXAS DEMOCRATS STALLING, HIDING OUT This comes as Texas Governor Greg Abbott and other state authorities have called for the arrest and removal of Democratic lawmakers who disappeared from the state and brought legislative progress in the state House of Representatives to a grinding halt. Because of the missing Democrats, the Texas House has not been able to pass the redistricting bill though it passed in the Texas Senate on Tuesday. In an interview with Fox News Digital, Abbott said that, in addition to political backlash, Democratic lawmakers who accepted money to assist with their exodus could face felony bribery charges. Now, several Democrats are reportedly planning to return to the state as Abbott calls for a second special legislative session to pass the redistricting bill. Despite this, the Democrats are asserting that their efforts have been a success. Speaking on Wednesday, Wu said, \"I'm so happy to be here today because in the past week we have heard from California, we have heard from New York, we have heard from Illinois, that people are ready to stand up. People are ready to fight back.\" DEMS FACE SCRUTINY OVER CONGRESSIONAL REPRESENTATION GAPS IN BLUE STATES: 'DON'T HAVE CLEAN HANDS' Wu called on more people to join in the efforts and to take \"more aggressive actions\" to fight the GOP. \"We cannot do this alone; that this is not a fight that we can sustain and win on our own,\" said Wu. \"What we need is we need more people to join us. We need more states to come to our aid, and we need more people to say we will start taking more aggressive actions, we will defend against this.\" Wu went on to say that if Texas and other red states are \"determined to do this,\" then \"other states will make sure that it does not matter what they do, that we will nullify their actions.\" \"We will make it pointless for them to attack our democracy,\" he said. In response, Andrew Mahaleris, a spokesperson for Abbott, told Fox News Digital that \"Democrats fundamentally misunderstand Texans.\" \"Texans expect their elected leaders to show up to work, and the Democrats refuse to do so,\" said Mahaleris. \"Voters, especially Hispanic Texans, are increasingly deserting the Democrats and deserve to be able to vote for candidates who better align with their values. At the end of the day, candidates win on the merits, not the map. If Democrats have any hope of winning elections, they need to change their platform. Running away from a fight is not a solution and is the antithesis of being a Texan.\" Amidst this controversy, Vance has also called for red states to counter what he called \"aggressive\" Democratic gerrymandering in blue states like California, New York and Illinois. Speaking with Maria Bartiromo on Fox News' \"Sunday Morning Futures\" this past weekend, Vance said, \"We're just trying to rebalance the scales and frankly push back against a very unfair system created by the Democrats.\" JD VANCE CALLS ON REPUBLICANS TO TAKE 'DECISIVE ACTION' TO COUNTER DEMOCRATIC GERRYMANDERING Vance said Democrats have had the upper hand in the game for many years and, under President Donald Trump's leadership, Republicans are finally playing offense. \"It's ridiculously unfair,\" he said of illegal immigrants being included in the total population used to determine how many seats each state receives in the U.S. House of Representatives. \"The only real way to fight back against it is for us to redistrict, in some ways, as aggressively as these hard blue states have done,\" he added. On Wednesday, Indiana state Rep. Ed DeLaney, a Democrat serving in a majority Republican legislature, accused Vance of engaging in \"congressional-level shoplifting.\" \"JD Vance, in my view, and I'm being serious about this, the man is engaged in congressional-level shoplifting, and I say that again. That's what he's doing,\" said DeLaney. \"Never in my life did I think that the Vice President of the United States would come to my state to ask our legislators to shoplift a congressional district like this, steal them off the shelf, run outside and wave them in front of the country. We cannot have this kind of conduct,\" he said. O'ROURKE, SOROS-LINKED GROUPS FACE CALL FOR DOJ PROBE OVER ALLEGED FUNDING OF TEXAS DEM WALKOUT DeLaney asserted that \"this game of, you know, ritual gerrymandering\" puts at risk \"the mutual respect of the legislature of our state and of Texas and of other states.\" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP He went on to say, \"If these idiots get their wishes, what happens if they lose one of those five congressional races? Oh my God, let's have another redistricting next year. This has got to be put to a stop.\" He went on to say that the Texas Democrats \"are the people who are going to try to put it to a stop,\" adding, \"I know how hard it is, but we need to support them and stand with them. Otherwise, our people will be subjected to ever-changing districts, none of which are representative.\" Fox News Digital also reached out to Vance's office for comment, but did not immediately hear back.","summary":"Democratic lawmakers slammed Republican redistricting efforts before the 2026 Midterm Elections, with one accusing JD Vance of engaging in &quot;congressional-level shoplifting.&quot;","url":"https://www.foxnews.com/politics/dems-accuse-jd-vance-congressional-level-shoplifting-call-more-join-awol-lawmakers","image":"https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2025/08/vance-texas-voting.png","video":"https://www.foxnews.com/video/6376892634112","publish_date":"2025-08-13 23:44:08","author":"Peter Pinedo","authors":["Peter Pinedo"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.34},{"id":350864882,"title":"Failed New Mexico candidate gets 80 years for convictions in shootings at officials’ homes","text":"ALBUQUERQUE, N.M.

Donna Howard said at a Planned Parenthood of Illinois event Wednesday in Chicago that “there’s no plan at this point, we’re watching day by day what goes on.”\n\nGov. Greg Abbott has ordered Texas authorities to locate and arrest the absentees.\n\n“There will be no reprieve for the derelict Democrats who fled the state and abandoned their duty to the people who elected them,” Abbott said in statement. He promised to “call special session after special session,” to get the remap passed, which could gain Republicans five seats in Congress.\n\n“The maps would silence Black and Brown communities,” state Rep. Sheryl Cole said Wednesday. “We stand firm on the right side of history.”\n\nRepublicans argue the Democratic exodus will delay relief for victims of devastating floods in July.\n\n“Our governor, who has given himself immense powers to do and act as he pleases, could act right now,” Democratic State Rep. Lauren Ashley Simmons said. “He could move resources and funds to help … he should have done it the day the disaster happened.”\n\nThe Illinois contingent of Texans met with DuPage County Democrats upon their arrival and have stayed at a St. Charles conference center.\n\n“The people of Illinois and in the city of Chicago have been overwhelmingly welcoming,” Simmons said.\n\n“A state like this gives us a lot of hope to be able to see that the things that we’re fighting for on a daily basis in our legislature can come to pass.”\n\nBut they also experienced a bomb threat Aug. 6 at their lodgings in St. Charles, along with warnings of reprisals such as $500 a day fines back home.\n\n“We know the risks,” State Rep. Jon Rosenthal said. “We know the dangers. We signed up for this. Whatever comes, we are working for the people that we represent, for the people of Texas ... to ignite this national conversation. Because what happens in Texas doesn’t stay in Texas.”\n\nOver the summer, Democrats had considered leaving the state, but ultimately, ”it was a last-minute, grab your bags and come kind of thing,” Howard said. She’s the primary caregiver for a young grandson who also came along.\n\n“Clearly, it’s not something we did lightly, it’s a big challenge and a huge sacrifice for many of us in terms of families, in terms of work but we’re here working every day, representing our constituents.”\n\nThe four lawmakers joined Planned Parenthood leaders to discuss reproductive rights and abortion bans Wednesday. Texas has one of the more restrictive policies in the U.S.\n\nSince Roe v. Wade was overturned, Illinois Planned Parenthood has served 47% more abortion patients, and out-of-state clients have grown from 4% to about 25%, officials said.\n\n“Thousands of Texans have come to Illinois for care because Illinois is a safe haven for them and our own state has abandoned them,” said Executive Director of Planned Parenthood Advocates of Texas Shellie Hayes-McMahon.\n\n“No one should be forced to travel hundreds of miles for the care they could receive in their own state from a trusted provider,” interim Planned Parenthood of Illinois CEO Tonya Tucker said. But she warned that existing and potential funding cuts will negatively impact the agency.\n\nAbbott’s Press Secretary Andrew Mahaleris said, “Texas House Democrats may as well stay in Illinois, their values align more with Chicago than Texas. Policy matters aside, Texans expect their elected leaders to show up to work, and these Democrats refuse to do so.

Haters know exactly where he should go — but Montauk’s no good because he’d have to listen to Bill O’Reilly.\n\nBetter he go to host Elvis’ packed Italian restaurant Canaletto where East Siders are still waiting for a table.\n\nMeanwhile, our vice president was resting his beard in the Cotswolds. His current heavy duty is downtime.\n\nMaybe Putin’s well-secured, heavily protected Black Sea dacha? The pile comes with a submarine bar and indoor hockey rink so he can always score.\n\nCampobello? FDR always went there — while Eleanor absolutely 100% did not. Not!\n\nSwitzerland? Naahh. He just laid an 800% tariff on chocolate or something. India? Don’t think so.\n\nDonald isn’t heavy on hobbies. What should he do — weave? Knit? Tat? Crochet? \n\nCuffing season?\n\nPAY attention. A former NYPD VIP says more cops do not necessarily equal better safety. This report states that when the uniformed NYPD types lessened — crime declined! Believe this? If you do, Girl Scout cookies will get hustled to you in solitary.\n\nAlready this year, 1,555 officers have left the force. More than 57,000 felonies in first half of the year. In 2024, it was 123,890 felonies total with 32,500 cops, lowest since 1990. Politicians like Mandamnhim are not what you’d call mathematicians.\n\nDeath defined\n\nBILL Boggs and Bill McCuddy at an East Hampton book party. Discussing books: a real California crime story. Abusive ex-boyfriend. The female kicked him out. He then strangled her. She was on life support five days. The charge: Attempted murder. When she died the charge became murder. In this true story the judge supposedly disliked the prosecutor so they convicted this guy of manslaughter. He only did 3½ years despite prior history of violence against women.\n\nThe book party discussion dealt with law. Murder 1 means calculation, intent. Seems somehow that to shoot someone — which takes a minute — shows clear intent. But strangle someone to death — which takes maybe four or five minutes — it’s somehow “manslaughter?”\n\nListen, if you know the name of this book: Tell me!\n\nComics ‘Pickup’ the pieces\n\nMEANWHILE, to help the cause of love and safety comes Eddie Murphy and Pete Davidson. Their new film’s: “The Pickup.” Their job is to steal $60 million from a casino. Davidson says, “I play a special little idiot.” Me, I make no comment. I’m sort of a nice lady.\n\nAND to keep B’way alive and thriving, trudges in now yet another oldie. “The Sound of Music” whose sound probably we haven’t heard for weeks. It says it’s a North American tour. Right. Like where else would it be? Like maybe they’re hustling seats on the front hump of a camel?\n\nOld-time regurgitated ancient passe theater is now so prevalent that young aspiring showbiz minded schoolkids are actually preferring to stay in their rooms and do homework.\n\nOnly in New York, kids, only in New York.","summary":"So where’s our hardworking commander-in-chief go for a break?","url":"https://nypost.com/2025/08/13/opinion/where-does-trump-go-when-he-needs-a-little-vacation/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/08/newspress-collage-t53ow49z3-1755126761510.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&1755112375&w=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-08-13 23:39:01","author":"Cindy Adams","authors":["Cindy Adams"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.007}]}
