But essentially that’s the way it is right now,” he said in the presence of visiting Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.\nHe also said the tariff letters sent to different countries are “more or less final offers”, adding that the US wanted fairness and had taken in over $100 billion worth of tariffs already.\n“We’ve made a deal with United Kingdom, we’ve made a deal with China. We’re close to making a deal with India. Others we’ve met with, and we don’t think we’re going to be able to make a deal. So we just send them a letter. If you want to play ball, this is what you have to pay,” he said.\nTrump added, “As far as I’m concerned, we’re done with sending out letters to various countries telling them how much tariffs they have to pay. Some will maybe adjust a little bit, depending if they have a you know, cause. But we’re not going to be unfair about it.”\nALSO READ: ‘If You Decide To…’: Bangladesh, 13 Others Slapped With Trump Tariff Letters | Full List\nWhich Countries Received Trump’s Letters?\nFollowing up on his promise to send letters to the countries for tariffs or deal with the US, Trump rolled out letters to 14 countries, including its key allies in Asia — Japan and South Korea — slapping 25% tariff on each.\nMalaysia and Kazakhstan were slapped with a 25% tariff each on their exports to the US, while South Africa faced a 30% tariff. The US President further imposed as high as 40% tariffs on goods from Myanmar and Laos.\nThailand, Cambodia, Serbia, Bangladesh, Indonesia and Bosnia and Herzegovina were slapped with additional tariffs ranging from 30-36%. Trump warned against any retaliatory tariffs, threatening reciprocation from the US.\nThe US president had unveiled sweeping tariffs on imports on what he called “Liberation Day” on April 2, including a baseline 10% tariff on all countries. However, he quickly suspended all tariffs above 10% for 90 days following turmoil in the markets.\nThe reciprocal tariffs were set to kick in by July 9 but were delayed to August 1 to allow countries to negotiate.

The decision had not been previously announced, although it was made as the Trump administration has been moving to ease or end many US sanctions that had been imposed during Assad’s rule.\nThe step looks to further end Syria’s isolation since a lightning rebel offensive ousted the Assad family from decades of rule and give the new government a boost as it tries to rebuild a country shattered by 13 years of civil war.\nPresident Donald Trump, before having dinner Monday with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu at the White House, repeated that he previously had been told that Syria’s new leader “comes from a very tough background.” “I said, Well, you know, I’m not that surprised. It’s a tough part of the world,’” said Trump, who met with al-Sharaa in Saudi Arabia in May. “But I was very impressed by him. But we took the sanctions off because we want to give them a chance.” The brief notice offered no details about the revocation of the foreign terrorist organisation designation for the al-Nusrah Front, also known as Hayat Tahrir al-Sham.\nAl-Nusrah was originally designated a foreign terrorist organisation for its previous affiliation with al-Qaida. In 2017, it split and changed its name to Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, which the first Trump administration added to the initial designation.\nSyria has been improving relations with the United States and other Western countries following the fall of Assad in December in an offensive led by al-Sharaa ‘s group.\nOn June 30, seven days after Rubio signed the revocation, Trump inked an executive order ending many US economic sanctions on Syria, following through on a promise he made to al-Sharaa when they met.\n“This FTO revocation is an important step in fulfilling President Trump’s vision of a stable, unified, and peaceful Syria,” Rubio said in his statement.\nNetanyahu, speaking across the table Monday from Trump and Rubio, agreed that the change of leadership in Syria “presents opportunities for stability, for security and eventually for peace.” “There’s a lot to lose by going back to conflict,” the Israeli leader said. “And there’s a lot to gain by moving towards peace.” Trump’s executive order did not rescind sanctions imposed on Assad, his top aides, family members and officials who had been determined to have committed human rights abuses or been involved in drug trafficking or part of Syria’s chemical weapons program.\nIt also leaves intact a major set of sanctions passed by Congress targeting anyone doing business with or offering support to Syria’s military, intelligence or other suspect institutions.\nWhile the Trump administration has passed temporary waivers on those sanctions, known as the Caesar Act, they can only be permanently repealed by law.

We don't want an emperor.\"\n\nDeveloping nations at the BRICS summit on Monday brushed away an accusation from President Donald Trump that they are \"anti-American,\" with Brazil's president saying the world does not need an emperor after the U.S. leader threatened extra tariffs on the bloc. Trump's threat on Sunday night came as the U.S. government prepared to finalize dozens of trade deals with a range of countries before his July 9 deadline for the imposition of significant \"retaliatory tariffs.\" The Trump administration does not intend to immediately impose an additional 10% tariff against BRICS nations, as threatened, but will proceed if individual countries take policies his administration deems \"anti-American,\" according to a source familiar with the matter. At the end of the BRICS summit in Rio de Janeiro, Lula was defiant when asked by journalists about Trump's tariff threat: \"The world has changed. We don't want an emperor.\" \"This is a set of countries that wants to find another way of organizing the world from the economic perspective,\" he said of the bloc. \"I think that's why the BRICS are making people uncomfortable.\"Live Events In February, Trump warned the BRICS would face \"100% tariffs\" if they tried to undermine the role of the U.S. dollar in global trade. Brazil's BRICS presidency had already backed off efforts to advance a common currency for the group that some members proposed last year. But Lula repeated on Monday his view that global trade needs alternatives to the U.S. dollar. \"The world needs to find a way that our trade relations don't have to pass through the dollar,\" Lula told journalists at the end of the BRICS summit in Rio de Janeiro. \"Obviously, we have to be responsible about doing that carefully. Our central banks have to discuss it with central banks from other countries,\" he added. \"That's something that happens gradually until it's consolidated.\" Other BRICS members also pushed back against Trump's threats more subtly. South African President Cyril Ramaphosa told reporters that the group does not seek to compete with any other power and expressed confidence in reaching a trade deal with the U.S. \"Tariffs should not be used as a tool for coercion and pressuring,\" Mao Ning, the Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson said in Beijing. The BRICS advocates for \"win-win cooperation,\" she added, and \"does not target any country.\" A Kremlin spokesperson said Russia's cooperation with the BRICS was based on a \"common world view\" and \"will never be directed against third countries.\" India did not immediately provide an official response to Trump. Many BRICS members and many of the group's partner nations are highly dependent on trade with the United States. New member Indonesia's senior economic minister, Airlangga Hartarto, who is in Brazil for the BRICS summit, is scheduled to go to the U.S. on Monday to oversee tariff talks, an official told Reuters. Malaysia, which was attending as a partner country and was slapped with 24% tariffs that were later suspended, said that it maintains independent economic policies and is not focused on ideological alignment. MULTILATERAL DIPLOMACYWith forums such as the G7 and G20 groups of major economies hamstrung by divisions and Trump's disruptive \"America First\" approach, the BRICS group has presented itself as a haven for multilateral diplomacy amid violent conflicts and trade wars. In a joint statement released on Sunday afternoon, leaders at the summit condemned the recent bombing of member nation Iran and warned that the rise in tariffs threatened global trade, continuing its veiled criticism of Trump's tariff policies. Hours later, Trump warned he would punish countries seeking to join the group. The original BRICS group gathered leaders from Brazil, Russia, India and China at its first summit in 2009. The bloc later added South Africa and last year included Egypt, Ethiopia, Indonesia, Iran, and the United Arab Emirates as members. Saudi Arabia has held off formally accepting an invitation to full membership, but is participating as a partner country. More than 30 nations have expressed interest in participating in the BRICS, either as full members or partners.

We're going to have to send more weapons, defensive weapons, primarily, but they're getting hit very, very hard,” he said before adding that “so many people” were “dying in that mess.”\n\nThe president’s comments come less than a day after Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky told ABC News that his forces had been counting on promised weapons shipments, including 20,000 anti-drone missiles that the Trump administration diverted to the Middle East. \n\nZelensky said the missiles in question, which had been pledged by the Biden administration, were needed to counter the Iranian-made Shahed drones that Moscow has been raining down on his country en masse. \n\nThat diversion, which had been ordered by Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, ostensibly to give U.S. and Israeli forces needed arms for a potential war with Iran, was part of a larger pause in aid which Pentagon officials say was prompted by concerns that U.S. stockpiles were getting too low.\n\nAt the time, White House spokesperson Anna Kelly said the decision had been made “to put America’s interests first following a DOD review of our nation’s military support and assistance to other countries across the globe.”\n\nThe pause mainly held up shipments of American-made Patriot air defense batteries, National Advanced Surface-to-Air Missile Systems and HAWK air defense systems which Ukraine has sorely needed for air defense — from taking out Russian aircraft in the early days of the conflict to having to defend itself against long-range missiles now.\n\nDefense officials say Kyiv’s need for air defense materiel has been in tension with needs in the Middle East and the reality of American procurement capabilities, citing U.S. forces’ inability to keep enough munitions on hand to sustain a high rate of deliveries while still giving American forces enough to train on while keeping a stockpile on hand for any future wars. \n\nTrump also briefly ordered a halt to shipments after a disastrous Oval Office meeting with the Ukrainian president in March but resumed them after Republican lawmakers complained.\n\nWith additional reporting from agencies.","summary":"A top Pentagon official had ordered a halt to weapons shipments just days earlier","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/trump-ukraine-weapons-russia-war-b2784407.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/07/07/23/38/2025-07-07T233711Z_541533917_RC2ZHFADAZ7S_RTRMADP_3_USA-ISRAEL.jpeg?width=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/xVaFsKQN-4VHSaSK0.mp4","publish_date":"2025-07-08 00:56:01","author":"Andrew Feinberg","authors":["Andrew Feinberg"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.006},{"id":339278986,"title":"'We won't do that again': Republicans fear budget may trigger another 'Blue Wave' midterm","text":"Republicans are reportedly experiencing déjà vu as President Donald Trump signed another massive tax cut package primarily benefiting the wealthy the year before a crucial midterm election — and they're already fighting hard to ensure a different result next November.\n\nThat's according to a Monday article in NBC News, which reported that Republicans are opting to stand firmly behind their massive new budget law and defend their support of it to voters in their own districts, despite the legislation's overwhelming unpopularity.

And in addition to the \"Big Beautiful Bill Act\" extending Trump's costly tax cuts for another 10 years, it also cuts funding for Medicaid – the program that provides health insurance for low-income and disabled Americans — by more than $1 trillion. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimated that nearly 12 million Americans could be kicked off of their health insurance plans as a result of the new law. \n\nJust as in 2018, Democrats are already focusing on several dozen vulnerable House Republicans who voted for the legislation, and aim to take back control of the House by reminding their constituents about the harm that will soon befall them as a result of their elected representatives' votes. Some of the biggest targets include Reps. Jen Kiggans (R-Va.) and David Valadao (R-Calif.), who both spoke out against several of the bill's provisions yet still voted for its final passage last week.\n\n“The so-called moderate House Republicans have shamelessly lied for months — hiding behind meaningless letters and performative tweets — claiming they’d protect Medicaid, food assistance and energy jobs,” Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee spokesperson Justin Chermol told NBC. “But their vote is the only thing that matters, and they’ll pay the price next year.”\n\nNBC further reported that Republicans view the bill as \"the defining issue of 2026,\" and are planning an onslaught of political spending touting the legislation's new funding for immigration enforcement and other components of the law like cutting taxes on tips and overtime work. Notably, Republicans are keeping quiet on the Medicaid cuts and are hoping that voters in next year's elections will be swayed by other items.\n\nREAD MORE: 'Utter buffoon': 'Senile' Trump mocked over letters he had 'no legal authority' to send\n\nClick here to read NBC's report in its entirety.","summary":"Republicans are reportedly experiencing déjà vu as President Donald Trump signed another massive tax cut package primarily benefiting the wealthy the year before a crucial midterm election — and they're already fighting hard to ensure a different result next November.\n\nThat's according to a Monday article in NBC News, which reported that Republicans are opting to stand firmly behind their massive new budget law and defend their support of it to voters in their own districts, despite the legislation's overwhelming unpopularity.

The confidential letter, dated June 23, was leaked to Colombian media outlets on Monday. Relations between the two countries are at their worst since the 1990s, when the US stripped a Colombian president of his visa following allegations that his campaign was financed by drug traffickers.

In the June 23 letter, Petro appears to backtrack from comments made during a speech on June 11, where he accused Secretary of State Marco Rubio of leading a plot to overthrow his government. Petro had said in the speech that \"a neighbouring President\" had told him that Rubio was leading a plot against him. \"I would like to clarify that any expression of mine, which may have been interpreted as a direct accusation about participation in a coup attempt in Colombia had no in intention of signaling anyone personally or questioning the role of the United States, without any proof,\" Petro writes in the letter. He also suggests that both Presidents should lead a US-Latin America summit.

White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said Monday she was not sure if Trump had seen the letter. Petro did not immediately comment on the letter after it was leaked to the press Monday. Colombia's Foreign Minister Laura Sarabia confirmed the letter was sent last month as part of an effort to “strengthen\" the relation between both countries. On Thursday, the US recalled its top diplomat from Colombia with the State Department citing “baseless and reprehensible statements from the highest levels” of Colombia's government. Colombia replied by recalling its ambassador from Washington in what Petro described as an effort to review the bilateral relationship, and analyse what kind of progress has been made on issues such as fighting climate change and “attacking” the international finances of drug traffickers. Colombia and the US have long been partners in the fight against the cocaine trade, with the South American country receiving more than USD 13 billion in US aid over the past two decades. But the relationship has changed since Petro came into office in 2022, with the Colombian president prioritising issues like climate change and the transition to clean forms of energy. Petro and Trump clashed in January after Colombia's president refused to accept two deportation flights operated by the US military, arguing that Colombian citizens on the planes were being subjected to inhumane conditions. Trump threatened Colombia with 25 per cent tariffs after the planes were prevented from landing, but the dispute was resolved within hours through a deal in which Colombia agreed to send its own planes to the US to pick up Colombian migrants that have been handed deportation orders. In June, Petro accused US Congressmen Carlos Gimenez and Mario Diaz Balart of trying to overthrow him. The congressmen were mentioned in recordings in which Colombia's former foreign minister, Alvaro Leyva, discusses plans to remove Petro from office, with an unnamed source. Both have denied any involvement in plans to remove Petro. Last week, Colombian prosecutors opened an investigation into the recordings, which were leaked to the Spanish newspaper El País. Tensions between Colombia and the United States come as cocaine production in Colombia reaches records levels, with Colombia's coca crop reaching 253,000 hectares (976 square miles) in 2023, according to the United Nations, a 40 per cent increase from 2020.

We have to,' he said.' He said they were 'primarily' defensive weapons, because Ukraine is being hit 'very hard.' He repeated his statements that he was 'disappointed' in his call with Russian President Vladimir Putin.\n\nHouse Republican allies of Trump have also been talking up a peace prize nomination for the president, and Trump has been pointing to his own efforts to settle shooting between nuclear powers India and Pakistan. 'We stopped a lot of fights,' Trump said.\n\nTrump's dinner with Netanyahu was part of strategy session to determine a way forward with Iran after the president joined Israel's assault on its longtime nemesis.\n\nA solution to the ongoing war in Gaza, which Israel began after the brutal October 7 attacks inside Israel, has proved elusive.\n\n'The utmost priority for the president right now in the Middle East is to end the war in Gaza and to return all of the hostages,' Leavitt told reporters ahead of the leaders' private dinner. \n\n She said Trump wants Hamas to agree to a US-brokered proposal 'right now.'\n\nTrump's special envoy Steve Witkoff is set to join talks in Doha later this week as the war approaches the two-year mark. \n\nThe meeting is the third between Trump and Netanyahu this year. \n\nYet the outwardly triumphant visit will be dogged by Israel's 21-month war against Hamas in Gaza and questions over how hard Trump will push for an end to the conflict.\n\nTrump has made clear that following last month's 12-day war between Israel and Iran he would like to see the Gaza conflict end soon. The meeting between Trump and Netanyahu could give new urgency to a U.S. ceasefire proposal being discussed by Israel and Hamas, but whether it leads to a deal that ends the war is unclear.\n\nBefore departing for Washington on Sunday, Netanyahu praised the cooperation with the U.S. for bringing a 'huge victory over our shared enemy.' He struck a positive note on a ceasefire for Gaza, saying he was working 'to achieve the deal under discussion, on the terms we agreed to.'\n\n'I think that the discussion with President Trump can certainly help advance that result, which all of us hope for,' Netanyahu said.\n\nWhite House officials are urging Israel and Hamas to quickly seal a new ceasefire agreement that would bring about a 60-day pause in the fighting, send aid flooding into Gaza and free at least some of the remaining 50 hostages held in the territory, 20 of whom are believed to be living.\n\nLeavitt announced on Monday that Witkoff will travel later this week to Doha, Qatar, for ceasefire and hostage talks.\n\nBut a sticking point is whether the ceasefire will end the war altogether. Hamas has said it is willing to free all the hostages in exchange for an end to the war and a full Israeli withdrawal from Gaza. Netanyahu says the war will end once Hamas surrenders, disarms and goes into exile - something it refuses to do.\n\nDemonstrators, including hostage family members, gathered outside the U.S. Capitol before the leaders' meeting to press for the release of all remaining hostages in any agreement.\n\n'We cannot accept a deal for a partial release,' said Ilan Dalal, father of Guy Gilboa-Dalal. 'A partial deal would mean that some of the hostages will stay in the tunnels for more time and this would be a death sentence.'\n\nTrump has been pressuring Israel and Hamas to wrap up the conflict, which has killed more than 57,000 Palestinians, ravaged Gaza, deepened Israel´s international isolation and made any resolution to the broader conflict between Israel and the Palestinians more distant than ever.\n\nBut the precise details of the deal, and whether it can lead to an end to the war, are still in flux. In the days before Netanyahu´s visit, Trump seemed to downplay the chances for a breakthrough.\n\nAsked on Friday how confident he was a ceasefire deal would come together, Trump told reporters: 'It changes from day to day.'\n\nOn Sunday evening, he seemed to narrow his expectation, telling reporters that he thought an agreement related to the remaining hostages would be reached in the coming week.\n\nThose mood swings also have embodied Trump´s relationship with Netanyahu.\n\nAs recently as Netanyahu´s last visit to Washington in April, the tone was markedly different.\n\nTrump used the photo-op with Netanyahu to announce that the U.S. was entering into negotiations with Iran over its nuclear program - appearing to catch the Israeli leader off guard and, at the time, slamming the brakes on any Israeli military plan.\n\nTrump, whose policies have largely aligned with Israel's own priorities, pledged last week to be 'very firm' with Netanyahu on ending the war, without saying what that would entail. Pressure by Trump has worked on Netanyahu in the past, with a ceasefire deal having been reached right as the president was taking office again.\n\nNetanyahu has to balance the demands of his American ally with the far-right parties in his governing coalition, which hold the key to his political survival and oppose ending the war.\n\nBut given the strong U.S. support in Israel's war against Iran, highlighted by joint airstrikes on a fortified underground Iranian nuclear site, Netanyahu may have a tough time saying no.\n\nTrump also may expect something in return for his recent calls for Netanyahu's corruption trial to be canceled - a significant interference in the domestic affairs of a sovereign state.\n\n'Trump thinks that Netanyahu owes him,' said Eytan Gilboa, an expert on U.S.-Israel affairs at Bar-Ilan University near Tel Aviv. 'And if Trump thinks that he needs to end the war In Gaza, then that is what he will need to do.'\n\nTrump on Sunday told reporters he continues to look for a 'permanent deal' with Tehran to ensure Iran doesn't try to restart its nuclear program.\n\nIran's President Masoud Pezeshkian in an interview published Monday said the U.S. airstrikes so badly damaged his country´s nuclear facilities that Iranian authorities still have not been able to access them to survey the destruction.\n\nPezeshkian added in the interview with conservative American broadcaster Tucker Carlson that Iran would be willing to resume cooperation with the U.N. nuclear watchdog but cannot yet commit to allowing its inspectors unfettered access to monitor the sites.\n\n'We stand ready to have such supervision,' Pezeshkian said. 'Unfortunately, as a result of the United States´ unlawful attacks against our nuclear centers and installations, many of the pieces of equipment and the facilities there have been severely damaged.'\n\nNetanyahu is slated to meet Tuesday with Republican House Speaker Mike Johnson.","summary":"President Donald Trump spoke before a dinner with Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu at the White House Monday.

When I visited the Hemerdon site a few months ago, it was almost completely deserted. But here, beneath the ground on the edge of Dartmoor, is one of the world's biggest troves of tungsten.\n\nTungsten is a substance of superlatives. Phenomenally hard, extraordinarily strong and incredibly dense, it has the highest melting point of any metal. And, thanks to these properties, it is an essential ingredient in how we make the modern world.\n\nAdvanced semiconductors – computer chips – rely on tungsten for some of their critical junctions and connections.\n\nTools and drills use tungsten for its hardness. And, perhaps most relevant of all these days, it is a crucial component in weapons and armour. If you are going to war, you need tungsten.\n\nAll of which is why there is a race underway to procure as much as possible of this metal. Tungsten is what governments around the world call a 'critical mineral'. It is one of a suite of such substances without which civilisation as we know it would crumple.\n\nWithout critical minerals we cannot build the technology that powers the World Wide Web; we couldn't make the machines that keep us alive or the ones that defend us from our enemies. But since many of these metals are scarce and since demand for them is on the rise, countries around the world are competing to get their hands on them.\n\nCold War-era hangars are now storing stockpiles of obscure metals. Geologists are travelling to far-flung lands, drilling thousands of feet below the ground and pushing the limits of technology to acquire them. And, all of a sudden, critical minerals are playing a key role in the brewing trade war.\n\nTungsten is just the start of it. When Chinese and American officials gathered in London for talks a few weeks ago, the negotiations hinged on a very particular category of minerals: rare earths.\n\nRare earth metals are a set of elements that occupy their own section at the very bottom of the periodic table. These metals play an important role in defence and technology. From fighter jets to wind turbines to the earphones you might use, rare earth metals are everywhere in our lives.\n\nYttrium makes steel alloys far tougher and more resilient. Neodymium makes far more powerful magnets. But the vast majority of rare earths are mined and refined in China.\n\nBeijing already has a near stranglehold over these materials and the products made of them. So when, in April, it deployed them as an economic weapon, it sent shudders through the global economy.\n\nChina restricted exports of seven heavy and medium rare earth elements and the components made with them, gumming up the supply chains manufacturing motor cars and electronics around the world.\n\nRare earths proved more than a match even for the great negotiator himself: they, more than anything else, forced Donald Trump to compromise on tariffs with the Chinese.\n\nThough even now it's still unclear whether China will lift its restrictions any time soon.\n\nConsider a metal such as cobalt. You may not think much in your life depends on this exotic material, but without it your smartphone and laptop wouldn't function, since their batteries depend on a cocktail of lithium and cobalt atoms.\n\nMost of the world's cobalt is to be found in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), where conditions in mines can be gruesome. Indeed, investing in the DRC is so fraught with risk that many Western companies have abandoned the country, leaving much of the mining to Chinese businesses.\n\nWhat about the jet engines that power our planes? To make the superalloys you need in their turbine blades you don't just need cobalt. You also need nickel, molybdenum, magnesium and a host of other obscure elements: titanium, rhenium, niobium and chromium.\n\nAnd what do nearly all of these elements have in common? The fact that China has a near stranglehold on either their production or refining.\n\nThe one exception, in this case, is niobium. But since nearly the entire world's supply comes from a single mine in Brazil, this is not especially reassuring either.\n\nLithium is even more irreplaceable when it comes to modern batteries than cobalt, yet its supply is only somewhat less concentrated. Much of it is to be found in salt flats high up in the Andes in Chile and Argentina. Even more comes from the Australian Outback. Yet what both of these regions have in common is that they ship most of their raw ores and concentrates over to China for processing.\n\nFor a long time, most Western politicians chose to ignore this topic, but today that is all changing. They have realised that economic and military supremacy depends not just on barrels of oil but on the minerals that go into batteries and drones, not to mention high-tech weaponry. And so, in what feels almost like a new Great Game, they are scrambling to try to secure them.\n\nMost famous is President Trump's minerals deal with Ukraine, which provides the US with access to the rare earths and lithium in the Ukrainian steppe. And part of the President's fixation with buying Greenland is said to be the mineral riches beneath the territory.\n\nAccording to the Financial Times, China's acquisition of foreign mines is at the highest level for a decade, with ten deals worth more than $100 million (£73 million) in the past year.\n\nEvery week brings fresh stories of new discoveries: rare earths in Kazakhstan; rich veins of phosphates in Norway.\n\nThe problem, however, is that with such discoveries, the brutish reality of what it takes to get this stuff out of the ground means they rarely live up to their initial hype. The difficulty of sourcing terrestrial minerals has given rise to a parallel race, into the oceans.\n\nFor decades, deep-sea mining was considered a technological and economic impossibility. But now, in an age of AI and advanced robotics, investors believe it is only a matter of time before minerals are extracted from the seabed.\n\nThat would mean meddling with one of the last remaining pristine ecosystems on the planet, raising the question: does the demand for critical minerals trump the environment?\n\nNo prizes for guessing the US President's answer. He recently gave the go-ahead for deep sea mining in American waters. But here again, he runs into a challenge: China has been investing in the sector for so long that it is widely seen as the world leader.\n\nAt this stage you're perhaps wondering, is China dominant absolutely everywhere?\n\nWell, not quite. Consider the parts and materials you need to make the computer chip. Nearly all of the world's advanced semiconductors are made in Taiwan by a company called TSMC. They're the ones making the silicon brains inside pretty much every smartphone.\n\nEvery silicon chip in the world –and for that matter every solar panel – depends on the minerals being dug out of a single vein of rock in an obscure part of North Carolina. For the silicon out of which those chips and panels are made can be refined only with the help of what is known as ultra-high purity quartz. And the world's premier resource for this material is Spruce Pine, in the Blue Ridge mountains.\n\nThat you probably haven't heard of it is not without reason. Like most of these places, it is happy to operate beneath the radar.\n\nSibelco, the company that mines most of the ultra-high purity quartz at Spruce Pine, hasn't admitted journalists to its site in decades, if ever. When technicians are brought in to repair machines, they are reportedly blindfolded to prevent them glimpsing the company's methods.\n\nBut is it any wonder secrecy abounds, given this business holds the fate of the world in its hands? One former worker told me: 'If you flew over the two mines in Spruce Pine with a crop-duster loaded with a very particular powder, you could end the world's production of semiconductors and solar panels within six months.'\n\nLast autumn Hurricane Helene nearly did just that, flooding the town, including Sibelco's works. For a week or so, chip companies fretted about a sudden shortage of the silicon they needed to make semiconductors.\n\nBut Sibelco managed to get its machinery up and running within a few weeks. Everyone has now forgotten about this critical link in the global economy – until the next time something goes wrong.\n\nMost major nations around the world have spent decades quietly building up lists of critical minerals. Some are necessary for technology – to make batteries, semiconductors or electric motors. Some are important for construction, others for defence. Some, like rare earth metals, go into more or less everything.\n\nBut, as the recent trade spat between the US and China has underlined, most Western countries have failed to turn these lists into physical results. In some respects, this seems almost inexplicable. If these metals are quite so important, why on earth is the US, or for that matter Britain, relying so much on China?\n\nIt's not as if they need to – especially America, which has far richer resources near at hand than its rival superpower. There are richer reserves of rare earths in California than in China – but they mostly lie untouched.\n\nTo understand why you need to remember two things.\n\nFirst, blasting rocks out of the ground and turning them into metals is a dirty business, producing plenty of carbon emissions, not to mention other airborne nasties. Refining rare earths produces especially noxious side-products. So most Western nations have been happy to outsource it to countries with fewer environmental qualms (and less pressing Net Zero targets).\n\nSecond, despite how exotic this all sounds, in practice the rewards for mining and refining critical minerals have long been rather disappointing. Metals companies go bust with metronomic regularity. And in part this comes back (yet again) to the fact that China has long controlled the market – and competing with China on price is a mug's game.\n\nBack to the Hemerdon mine in Devon and its tungsten.\n\nIn theory, this place should be one of the most important suppliers of this critical mineral. When I visited, we drove to the bottom of the open pit, where I picked up a heavy lump of rock flecked with dark spots – tell-tale signs of raw tungsten.\n\nFew other sites have as much of the metal as this place. In theory, it could catapult Britain from zero to being one of the world's biggest tungsten exporters. But right now, it is essentially just a big hole in the ground.\n\nThe last company attempting to make a go of the mine went bust a few years ago, leaving an empty site with millions of pounds of equipment and a large, mostly empty 'tailings' dam, which was where the waste was supposed to go (that's what lurks behind the big mound you can see from the road).\n\nIndeed, the only other times this place has ever run for more than a few days was during the two world wars, when it provided the tungsten and tin that helped Britain fight Germany. This time around, Europe is hoping British tungsten could help it wage economic war against other nations.\n\nNow, there's a new company, Tungsten West, hoping for better luck. It says it could get drilling in a matter of months. Last month the European Commission designated it as a 'Strategic Project' for critical materials.\n\nBut in practice, it still faces the same challenges. If China rations tungsten exports, this place becomes all-important. If China swamps the market, it is potentially unviable.\n\nHaving essentially ignored this stuff for years, even as other nations were building up their stockpiles, Britain is now belatedly trying to catch up – but progress is slow. A critical minerals strategy was due to be published in the spring but is now, I'm told, expected 'very soon'. The question is whether it is all too little, too late.\n\nAs the world slides into trade and conventional war, those who control these materials may end up controlling our future.\n\nEd Conway is economics editor of Sky News and author of Material World","summary":"Take the road north from Plympton in Devon and after a couple of miles driving past fields and solar panels, you will see what looks like a big, artificial hill rearing up to your right.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-14883565/future-phones-North-Carolina-crater-Devon-power-Britains-war-machine.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/07/07/21/100088129-0-image-m-66_1751919152435.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-07-08 00:46:11","author":"Ed Conway,Editor","authors":["Ed Conway","Editor"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.224},{"id":339279884,"title":"World News | Trump Announces Tariffs for 14 Nations, Including Allies Japan, South Korea","text":"Washington, DC [US], July 8 (ANI): US President Donald Trump on Monday (local time) shared letters sent by his administration to 14 countries, informing them of the reciprocal tariffs that will take effect from August 1.\nTrump first shared the letters sent to Japan's Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba and South Korea's President Lee Jae-myung.

In the letters, Trump mentioned that Malaysia and Kazakhstan will each face 25 per cent tariffs. Myanmar and Laos will face a 40 per cent tariff on their goods exported to the US. Indonesia will face a tariff rate of 32 per cent. Imports from South Africa and Bosnia and Herzegovina will be subject to 30 per cent tariffs on August 1. According to the letters, Tunisia will face a tariff of 25 per cent. https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump\nIn the letters written to the South Korean President and the Japanese Prime Minister, Trump stated that Japan and South Korea will face a 25 per cent tariff from August 1. https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump\nIn the letters, Trump threatened to increase the tariff rate by the same amount if the countries decided to raise their tariffs on importing American products. However, the US President indicated his willingness to reduce these tariffs if these countries revised their trade policies.\nEarlier, White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt announced that US President Donald Trump will sign an executive order delaying his July 9 tariff deadline to August 1.\nWhile addressing a press briefing on Monday (local time), Leavitt stated that 12 other nations, in addition to South Korea and Japan, will receive letters and notifications regarding tariffs from Trump. She recalled how she had announced that Trump was going to create tailor-made trade plans for each nation. She stated that the Trump administration wants to have the best deals for the American people.\nWhen asked why Trump decided to delay the tariffs originally scheduled to take effect on July 9 and whether other US trading partners will receive letters on tariffs apart from Japan and South Korea, Leavitt responded, \"Yes, I can confirm. In fact, I have those letters... I have the signed letters that went out to both South Korea and Japan today. There will be approximately 12 other countries that will receive notifications and letters directly from the President of the United States. Weeks ago, I stood at this podium and I told all of you that the President was going to create tailor-made trade plans for each and every country on this planet.\"\n\"The President will also sign an executive order today delaying the July 9th deadline to August 1st. So the reciprocal tariff rate or these new rates that will be provided in this correspondence to these foreign leaders will be going out the door within the next month or deals will be made and those countries continue to negotiate with the United States. We've seen a lot of positive developments in the right direction. But, the administration, the president and his trade team want to cut the best deals for the American people and the American worker. That's what they're focused on and in the effort of transparency, these letters will continue to be posted to Truth Social. So, you can enjoy them yourself,\" she added.\nThe 90-day deadline Trump set for nations to make trade deals with the US or face higher tariffs is scheduled to end on July 9, CNN reported. On April 2, Trump unveiled new \"reciprocal\" tariff rates for key US trading partners, with some tariffs as high as 50 per cent.\nCollectively, the tariffs were the highest the US has charged on foreign goods in over 100 years, CNN reported. After the tariffs took effect on April 9, they led to a sell-off on Wall Street, and the bond market rebelled, prompting Trump to announce a three-month pause to give nations more time to negotiate with the US.

Here are some of the key questions being asked in the aftermath of the tragedy.\n\nWhat kind of warnings did residents receive?\n\nThe National Weather Service (NWS) issued a flood watch on Thursday afternoon local time, advising of potential rainfall of up to 7 inches (17 centimetres).\n\nBut it was not until the early hours of the next morning, when many people were still asleep, that the warnings became more serious.\n\nAlerts were being sent out to enabled mobile phones from 1:14am, with an urgent warning issued at 4:03am.\n\nPhone reception in the affected areas can be patchy, and some residents say they did not receive the alerts.\n\nBy at least 5:20 am, some in the Kerrville City area, north-west of San Antonio, say water levels were getting alarmingly high.\n\nSome are now calling for a siren system along the river, similar to what is used for tornadoes in other parts of the United States.\n\nThe top elected official in Kerr County, Judge Rob Kelly, says that idea was examined several years ago but considered too expensive.\n\n\"We've looked into it before … the public reeled at the cost,\" he told AP.\n\nThe NWS says it is \"heartbroken\" by the loss of life in Texas. It has released a timeline of its alerts in the lead-up to the floods and says it had conducted forecast briefings for emergency management the day before they struck.\n\nSome meteorologists have defended its work, arguing the forecasts were as accurate as they could have been. Ultimately, they say the NWS did its job in extremely challenging circumstances.\n\n\"An overarching point that I think needs to be emphasised about this event is just what an absolute worst-case scenario it was,\" wrote Alan Gerard, who spent decades at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA).\n\n\"The flash flood event occurred in the middle of the night when people are typically asleep … [and] it occurred at the start of a long summer holiday weekend when campgrounds and resorts such as the ones that cluster along the Guadalupe River are most likely to be full.\"\n\nTexas Governor Greg Abbott argued advance warnings of the anticipated rainfall did not reflect the scale of what was to come.\n\n\"To most people in the area, flash flooding would mean one thing, not what it turned out to be,\" he told reporters on Sunday, local time.\n\n\"Because they deal with flash floods all the time … but there's no expectation of a water wall of almost 30 feet [9 metres] high.\"\n\nWhy were summer camps in 'flash flood alley' not evacuated?\n\nThe risk of flash flooding in central Texas is well-recognised. The area's steep hills, shallow rivers and semi-arid soils mean water can move very quickly through the area, earning it the nickname \"flash flood alley\".\n\nHatim Sharif, a professor of civil and environmental engineering at the University of Texas, says it is one of the most dangerous places for flash flooding in all of the US.\n\nThis storm dumped up to 15 inches (38 centimetres) of rain in the worst-affected area, equivalent to several months of its usual annual total.\n\nThe impact on the Guadalupe River was catastrophic, with waters rising 26 feet (8 metres) in only 45 minutes.\n\nStaff at one of the summer camps in the area, the Presbyterian Mo-Ranch Assembly, say they started moving children and staff to higher ground when they noticed the river rising.\n\nBut the nearby Camp Mystic, a Christian summer camp along the river, has been devastated. Twenty seven of the people killed in floods were campers and counsellors at the camp.\n\nAsked why the facility was not evacuated, given its proximity to the river, Kerrville city manager Dalton Rice said it was a \"great question\" but that authorities were still focused on searching for those missing.\n\nSummer camps are a long-standing American tradition during the school holidays, with Camp Mystic attracting children from across the state for nearly 100 years.\n\nChip Roy, a Republican congressman who represents the area, expects a debate over whether similar facilities should now be moved from vulnerable areas.\n\n\"The response is going to be, 'We've gotta move all these camps — why would you have camps down here by the water?'\" the BBC quoted him as saying.\n\n\"Well, you have camps by the water because it's by the water. You have camps near the river because it's a beautiful and wonderful place to be.\"\n\nDid budget cuts have an impact?\n\nThe NWS is one of many US government agencies forced to cut its staffing levels under US President Donald Trump's efficiency drives.\n\nTom Fahy from the National Weather Service Employees Organization told NBC that the local weather forecasting offices were adequately staffed ahead of the floods.\n\nBut he said the San Angelo office, which issued warnings for some of the affected areas, did not have a senior hydrologist or a permanent meteorologist-in-charge.\n\nSome experts have questioned whether the vacancies could have affected the level of coordination between the NWS and local officials.\n\nThe top Democrat in the Senate, Chuck Schumer, has asked a government watchdog to investigate whether staffing vacancies in the area contributed to \"delays, gaps or diminished accuracy\".\n\n\"This is a national tragedy which people across the country are mourning. The American people deserve answers,\" he wrote.\n\nWhite House press secretary Karoline Leavitt dismissed criticism of the federal response as a \"depraved lie\".\n\nThe president rejected concerns staffing cuts could have hampered the delivery of warnings, describing the floods as a one-in-100-year event.\n\n\"This was a thing that happened in seconds, nobody expected it, nobody saw it,\" Mr Trump said, adding that he did not think fired staffers needed to be re-hired.\n\nMr Trump did not comment on his suggestion, made earlier in his second term, that the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) should be abolished.\n\nCould it get worse?\n\nTexas authorities have warned the death toll is likely to rise as search-and-rescue operations continue.\n\nHundreds of volunteers are scouring the area around the Guadalupe River, with the chance of finding survivors diminishing with each day that passes.\n\nResidents are also bracing for more heavy rain, which could cause further flooding across the region.\n\nDalton Rice, the city manager in Kerrville, said a full review would be carried out in the hope of improving the area's preparedness for future disasters.\n\n\"We owe that commitment to the families who are suffering and to every member of our community,\" he said.","summary":"US President Donald Trump describes the catastrophic Texas floods as a one-in-100-year event — a disaster \"nobody expected\".

Tesla stocks are down 31% since Trump's inauguration in January, while the S&P 500 gained around 4% over the same period.Tesla has also posted back-to-back quarterly declines in vehicle deliveries in 2025, marking the EV maker's worst performance since 2022.Tesla and Musk did not immediately respond to requests for comments.Recent notes from analysts show investors disapprove of Musk's latest political moves across the board.\"Elon Musk diving deeper into politics and now trying to take on the Beltway establishment is exactly the opposite direction that Tesla investors/shareholders want him to take,\" Wedbush Securities analyst and Tesla Bull Dan Ives wrote in a note on Sunday.William Blair analysts Jed Dorsheimer and Mark Shooter wrote in a note on Monday that \"investors are growing tired of the distraction\" and that shareholders would \"prefer this effort to be channeled towards the robotaxi rollout.\"William Blair also downgraded Tesla from \"buy\" to \"hold\" based on regulatory headwinds from Trump's \"Big Beautiful Bill,\" which would eliminate tax credits for electric vehicles.According to Silver Bulletin's composite average of public opinion polls, the share of Americans with an unfavorable view of Musk has now risen to 55% from 45% at the end of 2024, and the trend is present across party lines.Philip Bell, political strategist and CEO of Tower K Group, told Business Insider on Monday that as a Tesla investor himself, he doesn't think it would be disastrous for Tesla if Musk leaves the company entirely to pursue politics.\"I think it could be beneficial to Tesla because you'll have that belief of founder risk finally go away,\" said Bell, \"And number two, the DNA that he has infused in Tesla will allow it to succeed for quite some time — there are a lot of people there who are able to innovate and obviously able to do the nuts and bolts of putting cars together.\"","summary":"The world's richest man's latest political activities prompted a brutal sell-off of Tesla stock as investors question his focus on the company.","url":"https://www.businessinsider.com/musk-loses-15-billion-net-worth-tesla-stock-america-party-2025-7","image":"https://i.insider.com/686c412785e81483682d83b2?width=1200&format=jpeg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-07-08 00:31:03","author":"Katherine Li","authors":["Katherine Li"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.301},{"id":339275630,"title":"The America Party is right out of the 'Musk playbook'","text":"If Elon Musk ever had to write a cover letter, he might say that he's the kind of leader who identifies an important problem and launches into action to find a solution — regardless of the odds.He wouldn't be lying. It's one of his primary traits as a business leader.Musk has a long history of founding and leading companies designed to tackle issues he feels need to be addressed. The latest example is his announcement over the weekend that he was moving forward with plans to create a new political party, the America Party for the \"80% in the middle,\" to break the impasse formed by the two-party system in the United States.Musk has shown a tendency to identify a challenge and home in on it as the fixer without necessarily considering whether he's best suited to do so, Jeffrey Sonnenfeld, a Yale School of Management leadership professor, told BI.\"That is the Musk playbook,\" he said.Musk didn't immediately respond to a request for comment from Business Insider.While Musk's America Party is his reaction to President Donald Trump's sprawling spending bill, which will likely add to the national deficit and which Musk has repeatedly criticized, he earlier described his new party as one that would represent voters in the middle of the political spectrum.Breaking the two-party system is a tall order. None of the many previous attempts have come close. Theodore Roosevelt's Progressive Party garnered 27% of the vote in 1912, and Ross Perot took in 19% of the vote in 1992 as an independent before forming the Reform Party for his 1996 bid.But Musk is not one to shy away from the difficult.\"When something is important enough, you do it, even if the odds are not in your favor,\" Musk told \"60 Minutes\" in 2012.OpenAI's Sam Altman, with whom Musk is currently engaged in a legal battle, has put it another way.\"Elon desperately wants the world to be saved. But only if he can be the one to save it,\" Altman said in a 2023 interview.When challenges arise at one of Musk's companies, he \"goes all in on it,\" Andy Wu, an associate professor of business administration at Harvard Business School, previously told BI.Musk founded SpaceX a decade earlier, easily his most ambitious project, investing $100 million of his own fortune despite having no experience in aerospace engineering. With its reusable rockets, SpaceX overtook legacy aerospace giants to become the dominant launch provider for astronauts, satellites, and commercial payloads. Musk says his goal is to make space travel more accessible and to give life on Earth an option should the human race face extinction at home.\"I've said I want to die on Mars — just not on impact,\" Musk said during a 2013 keynote at South by Southwest.Musk became an early investor in Tesla to tackle another problem he viewed as important: the environmental impact of fossil fuels. In 2006, before he became CEO, he wrote he was funding the company to \"help expedite the move from a mine-and-burn hydrocarbon economy towards a solar electric economy.\" While Musk went on to create the most profitable EV company in the world, it has more recently struggled as Musk's foray into government impacted the brand and confounded investors.Even The Boring Company, which Musk founded in 2017 to dig tunnels for underground transport, was born from Musk's frustration with Los Angeles traffic.\"Traffic is driving me nuts,\" Musk posted in December 2016. \"Am going to build a tunnel boring machine and just start digging...\"The Boring Company has since completed four operational tunnels in Las Vegas that are open to the public, while other proposed projects, such as a high-speed tunnel in Chicago and a Washington-to-Baltimore hyperloop, have been shelved.Musk's acquisition of Twitter in 2022 was a big swing — a $44 billion one, to be exact — to address another complex issue Musk saw as important.In the wake of the pandemic and civil rights unrest, Musk said he worried that the freedom to say anything you wanted was at risk. Buying Twitter was his solution.\"This is a battle for the future of civilization,\" he said on Twitter in 2022 after acquiring it, six months before he rebranded it as X. \"If free speech is lost even in America, tyranny is all that lies ahead.\"Musk has also voiced concerns about the future of artificial intelligence. He's gone to war with OpenAI CEO Sam Altman over that company's attention to its mission, which Musk helped craft as an early cofounder: to develop artificial general intelligence in a way that benefits humanity. Musk sees AGI as an existential threat, and said it is one of the reasons he founded xAI, the startup behind the Grok chatbot, in 2023.\"I'm going to start something which I call TruthGPT or a maximum truth-seeking AI that tries to understand the nature of the universe,\" Musk told Fox News in 2023, adding that xAI \"might be the best path to safety\" that would be \"unlikely to annihilate humans.\"AI is also part of his stated reasoning for founding Neuralink, which designs brain chips so humans can interact with computers. The chip is now in trials and used by a handful of disabled patients, who use it to more easily communicate, operate computers, or play video games. Musk has said that the ability for humans to integrate directly with machines can help ensure human control of AI.He said in a 2021 podcast appearance that he created Neuralink \"specifically to address the AI symbiosis problem, which I think is an existential threat.\"Musk may not be able to apply the same strategy to solving massive political challenges, said Sonnenfeld, the Yale professor, who's also the founder of Yale's Chief Executive Leadership Institute.\"He is great as a technology creator and entrepreneur, but not great in turnarounds and has been quite ham-handed in government, if not brutally offensive,\" Sonnenfeld said.With his efforts at the Department of Government Efficiency, Musk set out to cut what he described as fraudulent or excessive spending. The group's cost-cutting efforts spurred widespread layoffs across federal departments — actions that drew backlash from some on the political left.In the spring, Musk said that DOGE had been effective, though not to the degree he'd hoped. The spending cuts so far have fallen short of the initial target of slashing $2 trillion from federal outlays.There are signs that Musk, whose plans for a new party attracted support from Mark Cuban among others, is open to taking a measured approach with his latest political play.Musk said on Sunday that while the America Party may consider \"backing a candidate for president\" down the line, its main focus \"for the next 12 months is on the House and the Senate.\"Sonnenfeld said that Musk doesn't appear to have the skills and diplomacy needed to build his party, adding that the reaction among many investors and consumers to his political efforts has been \"overwhelmingly negative.\"\"He's a brilliant technologist and an entrepreneur who doesn't know his limits — and he has them,\" Sonnenfeld said.","summary":"Elon Musk's America Party is the latest example of the CEO jumping into action to solve what he views as a problem &mdash; regardless of the odds.","url":"https://www.businessinsider.com/elon-musk-america-party-playbook-solve-challenges-2025-7","image":"https://i.insider.com/686c460b3d5881a51c1cd53b?width=1200&format=jpeg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-07-08 00:31:01","author":"Peter Gelling,Tim Paradis","authors":["Peter Gelling","Tim Paradis"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.026},{"id":339277898,"title":"Netanyahu meets Trump at White House as Israel, Hamas discuss ceasefire","text":"U.S. President Donald Trump, who hosted Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu at the White House on Monday, said the United States had scheduled talks with Iran and had seen good cooperation with Israel's neighbors on helping Palestinians.\n\nSpeaking to reporters at the beginning of a dinner between U.S. and Israeli officials, Netanyahu said the United States and Israel were working with other countries who would give Palestinians a \"better future,\" suggesting that the residents of Gaza could move to neighboring nations.\n\n\"If people want to stay, they can stay, but if they want to leave, they should be able to leave,\" Netanyahu said. \"We're working with the United States very closely about finding countries that will seek to realize what they always say, that they wanted to give the Palestinians a better future. I think we're getting close to finding several countries.\"\n\nTrump and Netanyahu met in Washington while Israeli officials held indirect negotiations with Hamas aimed at securing a U.S.-brokered Gaza ceasefire and hostage-release deal.\n\nNetanyahu's visit follows Trump's prediction, on the eve of their meeting, that such an agreement could be reached this week. Before heading to Washington, the right-wing Israeli leader said his discussions with Trump could help advance negotiations under way in Qatar between Israel and the Palestinian militant group.\n\nIt was Trump's third face-to-face encounter with Netanyahu since returning to office in January, and came just over two weeks after the president ordered the bombing of Iranian nuclear sites in support of Israeli air strikes. Trump then helped arrange a ceasefire in the 12-day Israel-Iran war.\n\nTrump said his administration would be meeting with Iran. Special envoy Steve Witkoff said the meeting would take place in the next week or so. Trump said he would like to lift sanctions on Iran at some point.\n\nTrump and his aides appeared to be trying to seize on any momentum created by the weakening of Iran, which backs Hamas, to push both sides for a breakthrough in the 21-month Gaza war. He has said he also wanted to discuss with Netanyahu the prospects for a \"permanent deal\" with Iran, Israel's regional arch-foe.\n\nThe two leaders, with their top advisers, held a private dinner in the White House Blue Room, instead of more traditional talks in the Oval Office, where the president usually greets visiting dignitaries.\n\nAfter arriving overnight in Washington, Netanyahu met earlier on Monday with Witkoff and Secretary of State Marco Rubio in preparation for his talks with the president. He planned to visit the U.S. Capitol on Tuesday to see congressional leaders.\n\nDuring their meeting, Netanyahu gave Trump a letter that he said he had used to nominate the U.S. president for the Nobel Peace Prize. Trump appeared pleased by the gesture.\n\nAhead of their visit, Netanyahu told reporters Israeli negotiators were driving for a deal on Gaza in Doha, Qatar's capital.\n\nIsraeli officials also hope the outcome of the conflict with Iran will pave the way for normalization of relations with more of its neighbors such as Lebanon, Syria and Saudi Arabia, another issue expected to be on the agenda with Trump.\n\nSECOND DAY OF QATAR TALKS\n\nWitkoff, who played a major role in crafting the 60-day ceasefire proposal at the center of the Qatar negotiations, will travel to Doha this week to join discussions there, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters earlier on Monday.\n\nIn a sign of continued gaps between the two sides, Palestinian sources said Israel's refusal to allow the free and safe entry of humanitarian aid into Gaza remains the main obstacle to progress in the indirect talks. Israel insists it is taking steps to get food into Gaza but seeks to prevent militants from diverting supplies.\n\nOn the second day of negotiations, mediators hosted one round and talks were expected to resume in the evening, the Palestinian sources told Reuters.\n\nThe U.S.-backed proposal envisages a phased release of hostages, Israeli troop withdrawals from parts of Gaza and discussions on ending the war entirely.\n\nHamas has long demanded a final end to the war before it would free remaining hostages; Israel has insisted it would not agree to halt fighting until all hostages are released and Hamas dismantled.\n\nTrump told reporters last week that he would be “very firm” with Netanyahu on the need for a speedy Gaza deal and that the Israeli leader also wanted to end the war.\n\nSome of Netanyahu's hardline coalition partners oppose halting military operations but, with Israelis having become increasingly weary of the Gaza war, his government is expected to back a ceasefire if he can secure acceptable terms.\n\nA ceasefire at the start of this year collapsed in March, and talks to revive it have so far been fruitless. Meanwhile, Israel has intensified its military campaign in Gaza and sharply restricted food distribution.\n\nGazans were watching closely for any sign of a breakthrough. “I ask God almighty that the negotiating delegation or the mediators pressure with all their strength to solve this issue, because it has totally became unbearable,” said Abu Suleiman Qadoum, a displaced resident of Gaza city.\n\nThe Gaza war erupted when Hamas attacked southern Israel in October 2023, killing around 1,200 people and taking 251 hostages. Some 50 hostages remain in Gaza, with 20 believed to be alive.\n\nIsrael's retaliatory war in Gaza has killed over 57,000 Palestinians, according to the enclave's health ministry. Most of Gaza's population has been displaced by the war and nearly half a million people are facing famine within months, according to United Nations estimates.\n\nTrump has been strongly supportive of Netanyahu, even wading into domestic Israeli politics last month by lashing out at prosecutors over a corruption trial against the Israeli leader on bribery, fraud and breach-of-trust charges that Netanyahu denies.\n\n© Thomson Reuters 2025.","summary":"U.S. President Donald Trump, who hosted Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu at the White House on Monday, said the United States had scheduled talks with Iran and had…","url":"https://japantoday.com/category/world/netanyahu-meets-trump-at-white-house-as-israel-hamas-discuss-ceasefire1","image":"https://media.japantoday.com/img/store/37/88/2973da3258f58bc130039e109bf67fa64eb6/tag-reuters/_w1700.jpeg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-07-08 00:30:18","author":"Japan Today Editor,Jeff Mason","authors":["Japan Today Editor","Jeff Mason"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"jp","sentiment":-0.141},{"id":339275462,"title":"Judge Says New Trump Travel Ban Strongly Resembles Previous Version","text":"A Seattle federal judge declared there is a pressing need for clarity and decisive steps to determine how many refugees have been potentially impacted by President Donald Trump’s decision to pause the U.S. Refugee Admissions Program (USRAP) for intervals of 90 days. This comes after immigration lawyers alleged in court on Monday that this number could range in the “hundreds or even thousands,” significantly exceeding the 160 individuals currently accounted for.\n\nDuring a hearing on Monday morning in the Western District of Washington, U.S. District Judge Jamal Whitehead, appointed by President Joe Biden, informed lawyers from the Justice Department and attorneys representing a Congolese refugee known as Pacito, who is challenging the USRAP suspension along with eight others, that they should “anticipate a court order by the end of the week.” This forthcoming order will aim to establish a structured compliance plan to evaluate refugee eligibility based on an injunction he issued in February.\n\nMonday’s hearing covered the Trump administration’s attempt to apply his latest June 2025 travel ban to refugees the court has ordered resettled under Whitehead’s preliminary injunction.\n\nIt is one of the first cases where a federal court is considering the impact of the U.S. Supreme Court’s June 27 ruling limiting nationwide injunctions.\n\nLove true crime? Sign up for our newsletter, The Law&Crime Docket, to get the latest real-life crime stories delivered right to your inbox.\n\nIn a filing last week, lawyers for Pacito insisted the high court’s ruling had no impact on their case. They filed a seven-page motion asking Whitehead to continue enforcing the injunction that bars the Trump administration from attempting to “dismantle” the country’s refugee resettlement system.\n\nThe case stems from Trump’s efforts to suspend USRAP “until such time as the further entry into the United States of refugees aligns with the interests of the United States.” The plaintiffs, in their lawsuit, called Trump’s executive order a “stark violation of federal law” and accused Trump of violating the 1980 Refugee Act, which is part of the broader Immigration and Nationality Act (INA). This federal law “sets out detailed policies and procedures” that make up the USRAP, according to the lawsuit, and the plaintiffs say portions of it are “statutorily mandated.”\n\nAttorney Jonathan Hawley, of Perkins Coie, said Monday that the Trump administration and the district court needed to take into account all of the people who had travel plans canceled “for reasons other than the refugee ban” before it officially went into effect, and were then unable to rebook them due to said ban. He argued that even though there is a pending motion for class certification, it should weigh in favor of broader relief, and that “urgency” is key due to some refugees having medical conditions and health issues.\n\n“We have evidence that the travel ban was imposed even before its effective date, and indeed even before January 20, 2025,” Hawley asserted. “We know of at least one Afghan refugee who had travel scheduled for January 16, 2025, where travel was canceled without reason, and the refugee was never rebooked for additional travel.”\n\nHawley said that the fact that there might have been “pretextual cancellations in the run up to the executive order” might explain why only 160 injunction-protected refugees are being recognized in a two-week period, starting Jan. 20. Of that group, 120 have been processed and are awaiting entry, with about two-thirds being affected by the June travel ban.\n\n“Given that there are 52 weeks in a year and that 100,000-plus refugees are admitted annually, you would expect in a given two-week period to see thousands of refugees … for any given two-week period,” Hawley argued. “Here we only have 160 … so the idea that the government might have proactively canceled some travel because of the refugee ban is not only probable, but likely.”\n\nWhitehead appeared to agree, saying at the end of the hearing: “As Mr. Hawley has pointed out repeatedly … dispute resolution process, or whatever you want to call it, for evaluating the case-by-case reliance interests of the injunction-eligible refugees is needed.”\n\nAt one point, the judge joined Hawley in calling out the Trump administration for trying to claim that Trump’s latest travel ban was different from the one he issued during his first term. DOJ lawyer David Kim claimed the two travel bans differed in wording and that the latest one recognized refugees while his first ban didn’t, to which Hawley and Whitehead disagreed.\n\n“I have the text of these two carve-outs side by side, the old travel ban and the new travel ban, and I confess — I struggle to find any meaningful difference from them,” Hawley said.\n\n“There’s an uncanny resemblance there,” Whitehead added.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nPresident Donald Trump, pictured on the right, talks with reporters while Secretary&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Judge Says New Trump Travel Ban Strongly Resembles Previous Version first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/crime/judge-says-new-trump-travel-ban-strongly-resembles-previous-version/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Judge-blocks-Trump-admins-transgender-passport-policy.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-07-08 00:26:26","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.25},{"id":339278462,"title":"Tips And Overtime Deductions In Big Beautiful Bill  Create Odd Marriage Incentives","text":"TOPSHOT - US President Donald Trump (C) shows his signature on the \"Big Beautiful Bill Act\" at the ... More White House in Washington, DC, on July 4, 2025. US President Donald Trump signed his flagship tax and spending bill on July 4 in a pomp-laden Independence Day ceremony featuring fireworks and a flypast by the type of stealth bomber that bombed Iran. Trump pushed Republican lawmakers to get his unpopular \"One Big Beautiful Bill\" through a reluctant Congress in time for him to sign it into law on the US national holiday — and they did so with a day to spare Thursday. (Photo by Brendan SMIALOWSKI / POOL / AFP) (Photo by BRENDAN SMIALOWSKI/POOL/AFP via Getty Images)\nPOOL/AFP via Getty Images\n\nWhen President Trump came out for \"No tax on tips\" during the election campaign, I analyzed two legislative proposals towards that end that were in Congress. So when it came time for me to read the tax provisions of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act that is where I focused a lot of attention. You can find it on page 247 at the head of Chapter 2 (Delivering On Presidential Priorities To Provide New Middle-Class Tax Relief) - Bill Section 70201 - No Tax On Tips, if you want to follow along. In general, I find the provision very well thought out, except for one very odd thing. There appears to be a marriage penalty for well tipped servers tying the knot with one another and a marriage bonus for well tipped servers marrying industrious blue collar workers.\n\nIt Is A Deduction\n\nThe provision adds Section 224 to the Internal Revenue Code which allows a deduction for \"qualified tips\". The deduction is limited to $25,000. The deduction is phased out starting at $150,000 of modified adjusted gross income (MAGI), $300,000 in the case of joint returns. The phase-out rate is $100 per $1,000 of MAGI. The \"modifications\" that are added are for income excluded because it was earned by working abroad, in US possessions or Puerto Rico. The deduction is not an itemized deduction. You will be able to claim the standard deduction on top of it. If married you have to file a joint return to claim the deduction.\n\nSection 225 adds a deduction for qualified overtime compensation. That deduction is $12,500 or $25,000 in the case of a joint return. The phase-out is the same as for the tip deduction. As with the tip deduction married people have to file jointly in order to claim it. Why is the tip deduction limit $25,000 while the overtime deduction limit is either $12,500 or $25,000 depending on whether it is a joint return? I don't know and as a planner I follow Reilly's First Law of Tax Planning - It is what it is. Deal with it.\n\nA Get Together\n\nThere are five high school friends who get together. They are not married but are thinking about it. They each make about $100,000 per year, Robin and Terry are servers in a pricey restaurant. Most of their income is from tips. Blynn and Ashley are electricians who work a lot of overtime, well above the average. Jesse is an enrolled agent.\n\nThey get together to celebrate the Big Beautiful Bill. Robin and Terry want to know how much no tax on tips is going to save them and Blynn and Ashley are of course interested in the effect of no tax on overtime. It is up to Jesse to explain to them that that is not how it worked out in the Senate. It was converted to a deduction and there is a limitation. Remember they are all single. Jesse makes a big point of that, because Jesse is a bit on the pedantic side.\n\nMORE FOR YOU\n\nRobin and Terry will each get a $25,000 deduction. Blynn and Ashley will each get a $12,500 deduction. Jesse, of course, gets nothing other than a lot of aggravation. Not that anybody would care about this, but the whole crew will be getting $75,000 in deductions. Since Jesse made such a big deal about them being single, the question of what happens if they get married comes up. And this is where it gets weird.\n\nIf Robin and Terry get married their deduction drops to $25,000. If Blynn and Ashley marry they get $25,000 on their joint return. So the whole crew now gets $50,000 in deductions - a marriage penalty. But what if Robin marries Blynn and Terry marries Ashley. Now both couples get $50,000 in deductions or $100,000 for the whole crew - a marriage bonus.\n\nThere Is More\n\nA lot of thought seems to have gone into the tips deduction and I think the details of that are worthy of a separate post. For now I will refer you to Reilly's Third Law of Tax Planning - Any clever idea that pops into your probably has (or will have) a corresponding rule that makes it not work. The statute seems to address many of the ways people might try to game the system.\n\nThe difference in the limit on tips and overtime for single people, but not married people strikes me as possibly unintentional particularly since the phase-our language is identical. The original House bill did not include any limit at all, so that language was dropped in by the Senate. It reminds me a bit of the \"grain glitch\" in the Tax Cuts And Jobs Act of 2017. You probably need to be a real tax nerd or a grain farmer to remember that. That was fixed, but this, if it is not what was intended, may be harder to fix.\n\nBy the way, there was a reason that I have waited to read the Big Beautiful Bill. Starting in 1984, I deeply studied the proposals which ultimately resulted in the Tax Reform Act of 1986. That one was really big, which is why we still call it the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. TRA 1986 made my career. There was, however, a downside to all that study. In the years after enactment, I would often have ideas pop into my head based on provisions that were not enacted. So now I don't read them till they are signed.\n\nEditorial StandardsReprints & Permissions","summary":"There appears to be a marriage penalty for well tipped servers tying the knot with one another and a marriage bonus for well tipped servers marrying blue collar workers.","url":"https://www.forbes.com/sites/peterjreilly/2025/07/07/tips-and-overtime-deductions-in-big-beautiful-bill--create-odd-marriage-incentives/","image":"https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/686c63a7d923f445c67bb273/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-07-08 00:25:01","author":"Contributor,Peter J Reilly","authors":["Contributor","Peter J Reilly"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.202},{"id":339273000,"title":"Trump says the US will send more weapons to Ukraine — days after ordering pause in deliveries","text":"President Donald Trump says the US will have to send more weapons to Ukraine, just days after ordering a pause in critical weapons deliveries to Kyiv.\n\nThe comments by Trump on Monday appeared to be an abrupt change in posture after the Pentagon announced last week that it would hold back delivering to Ukraine some air defense missiles, precision-guided artillery and other weapons as part of its announced pause to some arms shipments amid US concerns that its own stockpiles have declined too much.\n\n“We have to,” Trump told reporters about additional weapons deliveries for Ukraine. “They have to be able to defend themselves.”\n\nRussian attacks on Ukraine killed at least 11 civilians and injured more than 80 others, including seven children, officials said Monday.\n\nMeanwhile, Russian’s transport minister was found dead in what authorities said was an apparent suicide — news that broke hours after the Kremlin announced he had been dismissed by President Vladimir Putin.

Thank you for your attention to this matter,” Trump posted on Truth Social on Monday.\nHis announcement came as several countries in the BRICS group, including India, Indonesia, and other nations, were already in negotiations for trade deals with the US ahead of the deadline on Wednesday. The earlier three-month pause on Trump’s April 2 “Liberation Day” tariffs would have gone live on July 9; however, the effective date has been postponed until August 1.\nIt was not immediately clear if Trump’s new threat would derail trade negotiations that are underway with India, Indonesia, and other BRICS nations.\nHowever, Trump sent out tariff letters to leaders of 14 countries on Monday, which included Japan, South Korea, Indonesia, South Africa, Bangladesh, among others. However, no letter has been sent to Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi.\nSouth Africa insisted that it was not “anti-American” and said that its talks with the US government remained constructive.\n(With Reuters inputs)","summary":"Trump had threatened to impose 10% additional tariffs on countries aligning with \"anti-American policies\" of BRICS nations.","url":"https://www.news18.com/world/line-being-drawn-trump-to-impose-brics-tariffs-only-if-policies-are-anti-us-says-report-9426787.html","image":"https://images.news18.com/ibnlive/uploads/2025/07/Donald-Trump-BRICS-2025-07-008dce6060c0256a33969a30317c106f.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-07-08 00:17:31","author":"Ashesh Mallick,News18","authors":["Ashesh Mallick","News18"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"in","sentiment":-0.534},{"id":339278506,"title":"Japan, South Korea hit with 25% tariffs as Trump ramps up trade war in letters to leaders","text":"ANIDonald Trump\n\nU.S. President Donald Trump on Monday began telling trade partners - from powerhouse suppliers like Japan and South Korea to minor players - that sharply higher U.S. tariffs will start August 1, marking a new phase in the trade war he launched earlier this year. The 14 countries sent letters so far, which included smaller U.S. exporters like Serbia, Thailand and Tunisia, hinted at opportunities for additional negotiations while at the same time warning that any reprisal steps would be met with a like-for-like response. \"If for any reason you decide to raise your Tariffs, then, whatever the number you choose to raise them by, will be added onto the 25% that we charge,\" Trump said in letters, released on his Truth Social platform, to Japan and South Korea. The higher tariffs, levied on U.S. importers of foreign goods, take effect August 1, and notably will not combine with previously announced sector tariffs such as those on automobiles and steel and aluminum. That means, for instance, that Japanese vehicle tariffs will remain at 25%, rather than the existing 25% auto sector tariff climbing to 50% with the new reciprocal rate as has occurred with some of Trump's tariffs. The clock has been ticking for countries to conclude deals with the U.S. after Trump unleashed a global trade war in April that has roiled financial markets and sent policymakers scrambling to protect their economies.Live Events Trading partners got another reprieve as Trump signed an executive order on Monday extending the Wednesday deadline for negotiations to August 1. Trump has kept much of the world guessing on the outcome of months of talks with countries hoping to avoid the hefty tariff hikes he has threatened. The rate for South Korea is the same as Trump initially announced, while the rate for Japan is 1 point higher than the one announced on April 2. A week later, he capped all of the so-called reciprocal tariffs at 10% until Wednesday. Only two agreements have so far been reached, with Britain and Vietnam. Wendy Cutler, vice president of the Asia Society Policy Institute, said it was unfortunate Trump was hiking tariffs on imports from two of the closest U.S. allies, but there was still time for a breakthrough in negotiations. \"While the news is disappointing, it does not mean the game is over,\" Cutler said. Trump said that the United States would impose 25% tariffs on goods from Tunisia, Malaysia and Kazakhstan; 30% on South Africa, Bosnia and Herzegovina; 32% on Indonesia; 35% on Serbia and Bangladesh; 36% on Cambodia and Thailand and 40% on Laos and Myanmar. South Korea said it planned to intensify U.S. trade talks and considers Trump's plan for a 25% tariff from August 1 as effectively extending a grace period on implementing reciprocal tariffs. \"We will step up negotiations during the remaining period to reach a mutually beneficial result to quickly resolve the uncertainties from tariffs,\" the country's Industry Ministry said. South African President Cyril Ramaphosa said the 30% U.S. tariff rate was unjustified given that 77% of U.S. goods enter South Africa with no tariffs. Ramaphosa's spokesperson said his government would continue to engage with the U.S. There was no response from the Japanese embassy in Washington. MARKET DROP U.S. stocks fell in response, the latest market turmoil as Trump's trade moves have whipsawed financial markets and sent policymakers scrambling to protect their economies. U.S. stocks were driven to near bear-market territory by his cascade of tariff announcements through the early spring but quickly rebounded to record highs after he put the stiffest levies on hold on April 9. The S&P 500 closed down about 0.8%, its biggest drop in three weeks. U.S.-listed shares of Japanese automotive companies fell, with Toyota Motor closing down 4.0% and Honda Motor off by 3.9%. The dollar surged against both the Japanese yen and the South Korean won. \"Tariff talk has sucked the wind out of the sails of the market,\" said Brian Jacobsen, chief economist at Annex Wealth Management. Most of the announced tariff rates have been rounded down, he added, and the letters come across as \"take it or leave it\" offers. U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said earlier on Monday he expected several trade announcements in the next 48 hours, adding that his inbox was full of countries' last-ditch offers. TRADING BLOCS The European Union will not be receiving a letter setting out higher tariffs, EU sources familiar with the matter told Reuters on Monday. The EU still aims to reach a trade deal by Wednesday after European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen and Trump had a \"good exchange,\" a commission spokesperson said. The EU has been torn over whether to push for a quick and light trade deal or leverage its economic clout to negotiate a better outcome. It had already given up hopes for a comprehensive trade agreement before the July deadline. The president also threatened leaders of developing nations in the BRICS group, who are meeting in Brazil, with an additional 10% tariff if they adopt \"anti-American\" policies. The group includes Brazil, Russia, India and China among others.

Kerr County officials said Monday 10 campers and one counselor have still not been found.\n\nSearchers have found the bodies of 84 people, including 28 children, in the county home to Camp Mystic and several other summer camps, officials said.\n\nWith additional rain on the way, more flooding still threatened saturated parts of central Texas. Authorities said the death toll was sure to rise.\n\nThe raging flash floods — among the nation’s worst in decades — slammed into camps and homes along the edge of the Guadalupe River before daybreak Friday, pulling sleeping people out of their cabins, tents and trailers and dragging them for miles past floating tree trunks and cars. Some survivors were found clinging to trees.\n\nPiles of twisted trees sprinkled with mattresses, refrigerators and coolers littered the riverbanks Monday. The debris included reminders of what drew so many to the campgrounds and cabins in the Hill Country — a volleyball, canoes and a family portrait.\n\nNineteen deaths were reported in Travis, Burnet, Kendall, Tom Green and Williamson counties, local officials said.\n\nAmong those confirmed dead were 8-year-old sisters from Dallas who were at Camp Mystic and a former soccer coach and his wife who were staying at a riverfront home. Their daughters were still missing.\n\nCalls for finding why warnings weren’t heard\n\nAuthorities vowed that one of the next steps would be investigating whether enough warnings were issued and why some camps did not evacuate or move to higher ground in a place long vulnerable to flooding that some local residents refer to as “flash flood alley.”\n\nThat will include a review of how weather warnings were sent out and received. One of the challenges is that many camps and cabins are in places with poor cellphone service, Kerrville City Manager Dalton Rice said.\n\n“We definitely want to dive in and look at all those things,” he said. “We’re looking forward to doing that once we can get the search and rescue complete.”\n\nSome camps were aware of the dangers and monitoring the weather. At least one moved several hundred campers to higher ground before the floods.\n\nSen. Ted Cruz, a Texas Republican, said recent government spending cuts to the Federal Emergency Management Agency and the National Weather Service did not delay any warnings.\n\n“There’s a time to have political fights, there’s a time to disagree. This is not that time,” Cruz said. “There will be a time to find out what could been done differently. My hope is in time we learn some lessons to implement the next time there is a flood.”\n\nThe weather service first advised of potential flooding on Thursday and then sent out a series of flash flood warnings in the early hours of Friday before issuing flash flood emergencies — a rare step that alerts the public to imminent danger.\n\nAuthorities and elected officials have said they did not expect such an intense downpour, the equivalent of months of rain. Some residents said they never received any warnings.\n\nPresident Donald Trump, who signed a major disaster declaration for Kerr County, said he plans to visit the state on Friday. He had said Sunday that he does not plan to rehire any of the federal meteorologists who were fired this year.\n\n“This was a thing that happened in seconds. Nobody expected it,” the president said.\n\nWhite House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said local and federal weather services provided sufficient warnings.\n\nCrews search for dozens of peopleMore than three dozen people were unaccounted for across the state and more could be missing, Gov. Greg Abbott said Sunday.\n\nSearch-and-rescue crews at one staging area said Monday that more than 1,000 volunteers had been directed to Kerr County.\n\nKerrville city officials urged people to stop flying drones over the area after they said a private drone operating illegally Monday afternoon collided with a helicopter involved in emergency operations. The helicopter was forced to make an emergency landing and is out of service until further notice.\n\nLittle time to escape floods\n\nReagan Brown said his parents, in their 80s, managed to escape uphill as water inundated their home in the town of Hunt. When the couple learned that their 92-year-old neighbor was trapped in her attic, they went back and rescued her.\n\n“Then they were able to reach their tool shed up higher ground, and neighbors throughout the early morning began to show up at their tool shed, and they all rode it out together,” Brown said.\n\nElizabeth Lester, a mother of children who were at Camp Mystic and nearby Camp La Junta during the flood, said her young son had to swim out his cabin window to escape. Her daughter fled up the hillside as floodwaters whipped against her legs.\n\nSeewer reported from Toledo, Ohio.

It was there that he first witnessed the smartphone revolution and got hooked on entrepreneurship. \n\nHis pivot to skincare came in 2014 when he launched APR, initially focused on cosmetics. In 2021, the business expanded into producing high-tech facial devices that promise spa-like treatments at home. \n\nIt’s a product line that Kim personally evangelises — he uses APR’s facial gadget for 30 minutes every day — APR’s Chief Financial Officer Shin Jae Ha told Bloomberg News in an interview.\n\nAfter going public last year, APR is now the second-largest publicly traded beauty firm in South Korea with a market capitalization of more than $4 billion. \n\nEndorsements from top-tier influencers reflect the growing mainstream appeal of K-beauty, the umbrella term for South Korea’s booming beauty exports. Once the domain of Gen Z or Asian American influencers, they have gone mainstream in the US, where sales of Korean beauty products jumped 56% to $1.9 billion last year.\n\nWith global interest rising alongside K-pop music and Korean dramas, celebrities began spotlighting products from APR’s flagship brand Medicube in their routines. Hailey Bieber first posted about its gel mask in late 2023, unprompted, the company said. That organic buzz paved the way for APR’s global campaigns in 2024 featuring Kylie and Kendall Jenner, and Khloe Kardashian. \n\n“Now it feels that K-beauty has reached the stage where it’s spreading from early adopters to mass-market consumers,” said APR’s CFO Shin, a former M&A banker at HSBC Holdings Plc, who joined Kim in 2016 after being drawn to his vision.\n\nWhile the rise of K-beauty has mirrored the global surge of South Korean culture, APR is part of a new wave of cosmetic exports. Unlike legacy brands that relied heavily on duty-free shops or China-focused lines, APR found its niche in TikTok-powered skincare campaigns and sleek devices that serve up beauty tech.\n\n\"K-beauty companies that are good at marketing on digital platforms tend to show faster growth in e-commerce,” said Eun-Jung Park, an analyst with Hana Securities in Seoul. \n\nChina remains South Korea’s largest beauty export market — but just barely. While Chinese imports are slowing, the US is now growing faster and offers higher margins, thanks to its premium retail landscape. More than 70% of APR’s revenue now comes from overseas markets — and the US is its biggest driver of growth outside South Korea.\n\nThe company is now preparing for its biggest retail push yet: in August, Medicube will be sold at cosmetics retailer chain Ulta Beauty Inc. stores across the US, expanding its presence beyond online platforms like Amazon.com Inc. and its own e-commerce channels.\n\n“APR is one of the strongest marketing players among K-beauty brands,” said Park. “Its Medicube is No.1 in sales [in the US] for a single K-beauty brand.”\n\nAPR’s current lines of skincare and devices focus on anti-aging, moisturizing and brightening, with a possibility of expanding into healthcare, the company said in an email.\n\nBut it is not immune to global trade pressures. For now, APR pays a 10% tariff on beauty goods imported to the US, which Shin calls “manageable.” But potential escalation in trade tensions, or US clampdowns on Asian imports, could disrupt its rapid growth. \n\nOn Monday in the US, President Donald Trump unveiled a tariff of 25% on goods from South Korea beginning Aug. 1. That effectively buys South Korea — and other affected nations — an extra three weeks to cut a deal with the White House.\n\nMeanwhile, Shin expects the company’s sales to hit 1 trillion won ($730 million) in annual revenue this year, a metric in which it is currently lagging its peers.\n\nAs the business grows, founder-turned-billionaire Kim’s personal moves are making local headlines. He recently purchased a penthouse in Seoul’s upscale Seongsu-dong neighborhood for 29 billion won ($21 million), the company confirmed, setting a new national record for the highest price per square meter. The luxury residence is also home to well-known movie stars and sports figures, signaling his arrival as one of the country’s most visible new billionaires.\n\nDespite his new wealth, Kim, who serves as the company’s chief executive officer, remains intensely hands-on — coming into the office daily, closely tracking consumer trends and market reactions, and holding strategy meetings with top management even on weekends, Shin said. A few years ago, Kim shared a before-and-after video on social media showcasing the effects of APR’s facial gadget on his own skin. \n\nBut in recent years, he’s largely stepped back online, keeping a lower profile as the company’s visibility has soared. \n\nHe declined Bloomberg News requests for an interview, but has in the past spoken about being influenced by the business models of Apple Inc. and Tesla Inc. \n\n“If someone asks me what my career goal is, I’d say now I want to make a big company everyone knows,” Kim told local media around the time of his last Instagram post. “Like Apple, we want to introduce products that would make us the most innovative company in the beauty industry.”\n\nMore stories like this are available on bloomberg.com\n\nGulf News English Text RSS April 2024\n\n©2025 Bloomberg L.P.","summary":"A 36-Year-Old Beauty Mogul Is South Korea's Newest Billionaire","url":"https://gulfnews.com/your-money/kardashian-endorsed-k-beauty-s-medicube-makes-korean-founder-a-billionaire-1.500190357","image":"https://media.assettype.com/gulfnews%2F2025-07-08%2Fx1i93ax7%2FKim-Byung-Hoon-a-tech-entrepreneur-turned-beauty-mogul-whose-company-has-made-him-South-Korea%E2%80%99s-newest-billionaire.?w=1200&ar=40%3A21&auto=format%2Ccompress&ogImage=true&mode=crop&enla","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-07-08 00:14:58","author":"Bloomberg","authors":["Bloomberg"],"language":"en","source_country":"ae","sentiment":0},{"id":339275150,"title":"Donald Trump news: Israel Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu nominates US President for Nobel Peace Prize","text":"Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has presented US President Donald Trump with a letter nominating him for a Nobel Peace Prize during a dinner at the White House for his role in ending the 12-day war with Iran.\n\nMr Netanyahu travelled to Washington on Monday in an effort to advance a Gaza ceasefire deal after he sent negotiators to Doha for indirect talks with Hamas.\n\nFacing growing pressure to bring an end to the nearly 22-month-long war, the Israeli Prime Minister is expected to have a meeting with Mr Trump to discuss ending the conflict.\n\nDuring a dinner with Mr Trump and senior members of his Administration, Mr Netanyahu expressed his gratitude for the US President’s leadership in bringing the Israel-Iran war to an end.\n\n“I want to express the appreciation and admiration not only of all Israelis, but of the Jewish people and many, many admirers around the world, for your leadership, your leadership of the free world, your leadership of a just cause, and the pursuit of peace and security,” he said.\n\n“The President has an extraordinary team, and I think our teams, together, make, an extraordinary combination to meet challenges and seize opportunities.\n\n“The President has already realised great opportunities. He forged the Abraham Accords. He is forging peace as we speak in one country and one region after the other,” he continued.\n\n“So I want to present to you, Mr President, the letter I sent to the Nobel Prize committee. It’s nominating you for the peace prize, which is well deserved.”\n\nMr Netanyahu added that Mr Trump “should get it”.\n\nMr Trump was visibly taken aback by the gesture, revealing that he didn’t know the nomination was coming from the Israeli Prime Minister.\n\n“Thank you very much. This I didn’t know. Thank you very much. Coming from (Mr Netanyahu) in particular, this is very meaningful. Thank you very much, Bibi,” he said.\n\n“Thank you for everything you do,” Mr Netanyahu responded.\n\nMr Trump has made clear that following last month’s 12-day war between Israel and Iran, he would like to see the Gaza conflict end soon.\n\nThe meeting between Mr Trump and Mr Netanyahu could give new urgency to a US ceasefire proposal being discussed by Israel and Hamas, but whether it leads to a deal that ends the war is unclear.\n\n“The utmost priority for the President right now in the Middle East is to end the war in Gaza and to return all of the hostages,” White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters hours before the two leaders meet for a private dinner.\n\nBefore departing for Washington on Sunday, Mr Netanyahu praised the cooperation with the US for bringing a “huge victory over our shared enemy.”\n\nHe struck a positive note on a ceasefire for Gaza, saying he was working “to achieve the deal under discussion, on the terms we agreed to”.\n\nThe Prime Minister was scheduled to hold separate meetings on Monday with special envoy Steve Witkoff and Secretary of State Marco Rubio before the dinner with Mr Trump.\n\nMr Netanyahu is slated to meet Tuesday with Republican House Speaker Mike Johnson.\n\n“I think that the discussion with President Trump can certainly help advance that result, which all of us hope for,” Mr Netanyahu said.\n\nIsrael and Hamas appear to be inching toward a new ceasefire agreement that would bring about a 60-day pause in the fighting, send aid flooding into Gaza and free at least some of the remaining 50 hostages held in the territory, 20 of whom are believed to be living.\n\nMs Leavitt announced on Monday that Witkoff will travel later this week to Doha, Qatar, for ceasefire and hostage talks.\n\nBut a perennial sticking point is whether the ceasefire will end the war altogether.\n\nHamas has said it is willing to free all the hostages in exchange for an end to the war and a full Israeli withdrawal from Gaza.\n\nMr Netanyahu says the war will end once Hamas surrenders, disarms and goes into exile — something it refuses to do.\n\nDemonstrators, including hostage family members, gathered outside the US Capitol before the leaders’ meeting to press for the release of all remaining hostages in any agreement.\n\n“We cannot accept a deal for a partial release,” said Ilan Dalal, father of Guy Gilboa-Dalal.\n\n“A partial deal would mean that some of the hostages will stay in the tunnels for more time and this would be a death sentence.”\n\nMr Trump has made it clear that he wants to be known as a peacemaker.\n\nHe has repeatedly trumpeted recent peace deals that his administration facilitated between India and Pakistan, the Democratic Republic of Congo and Rwanda, and Israel and Iran, and for years has made little secret of the fact that he covets a Nobel Peace Prize.\n\nHe has been pressuring Israel and Hamas to wrap up their own conflict, which has killed tens of thousands of Palestinians, ravaged Gaza, deepened Israel’s international isolation and made any resolution to the broader conflict between Israel and the Palestinians more distant than ever.\n\nIn the days before Mr Netanyahu’s visit, Mr Trump seemed to downplay the chances for a breakthrough.\n\nAsked on Friday how confident he was that a ceasefire deal would come together, Trump told reporters: “I’m very optimistic — but you know, look, it changes from day to day”.","summary":"Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has nominated US President Donald Trump for a Nobel Peace Prize for his role in ending the 12-day war with Iran.","url":"https://thewest.com.au/news/world/donald-trump-news-israel-prime-minister-benjamin-netanyahu-nominates-us-president-for-nobel-peace-prize-c-19283912","image":"https://images.thewest.com.au/publication/C-19283912/cada59c8225d2f2b40b86a472fbd698c0fc44b1c-16x9-x1y0w2446h1376.jpg?imwidth=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-07-08 00:14:43","author":"Amy Lee","authors":["Amy Lee"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"au","sentiment":0.382},{"id":339276890,"title":"Trump says US will resume weapon shipments to Ukraine days after pause","text":"President Donald Trump on Monday said the United States would resume providing weapons to Ukrainian defense forces because the country was being slammed by ongoing Russian aerial attacks, just days after the Pentagon halted shipments to review whether current stockpiles were sufficient for American defense needs.\n\nSpeaking during a dinner with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and members of their respective staffs, Trump was asked if he planned to sent more weapons for use by Kyiv.\n\nHe replied affirmatively, telling reporters: “We're going to send some more weapons.”\n\n“We have to, they have to be able to defend themselves. They're getting hit very hard. Now they're getting hit very hard. We're going to have to send more weapons, defensive weapons, primarily, but they're getting hit very, very hard,” he said before adding that “so many people” were “dying in that mess.”\n\nThe presidents comments came less than a day after Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky told ABC News that his forces had been counting on promised weapons shipments, including 20,000 anti-drone missiles that the Trump administration diverted to the Middle East.\n\nZelensky said the missiles in question, which had been pledged by the previous Biden administration, were needed to counter the Iranian-made Shahed drones that Moscow has been raining down on his country en masse.\n\nThat diversion, which had been ordered by Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, ostensibly to give U.S. and Israeli forces needed arms for a potential war with Iran, was part of a larger pause in aid which Pentagon officials say was prompted by concerns that U.S. stockpiles were getting too low.\n\nAt the time, White House spokesperson Anna Kelly said the decision had been made “to put America’s interests first following a DOD review of our nation’s military support and assistance to other countries across the globe.”\n\nThe pause mainly held up shipments of American-made Patriot air defense batteries, National Advanced Surface-to-Air Missile Systems and HAWK air defense systems which Ukraine has sorely needed for air defense — from taking out Russian aircraft in the early days of the conflict to having to defend itself against long-range missiles now.\n\nDefense officials say Kyiv’s need for air defense materiel has been in tension with needs in the Middle East and the reality of American procurement capabilities, citing U.S. forces’ inability to keep enough munitions on hand to sustain a high rate of deliveries while still giving American forces enough to train on while keeping a stockpile on hand for any future wars.\n\nTrump also briefly ordered a halt to shipments after a disastrous Oval Office meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in March but resumed them after Republican lawmakers complained.\n\nWith additional reporting by agencies","url":"https://uk.news.yahoo.com/trump-says-us-resume-weapon-000305360.html","image":"https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_independent_577/8c6d496362d8686d2b1eb88ab5183f8b","video":"","publish_date":"2025-07-08 00:14:21","author":"Andrew Feinberg","authors":["Andrew Feinberg"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.022},{"id":339273214,"title":"World News | Trump to Sign Executive Order Delaying July 9 Tariff Deadline to August 1: White House","text":"Washington, DC [US], July 8 (ANI): US President Donald Trump will sign an executive order delaying his July 9 tariff deadline to August 1, the White House announced on Monday (local time).

On April 2, Trump unveiled new \"reciprocal\" tariff rates for key US trading partners, with some tariffs as high as 50 per cent. Collectively, the tariffs were the highest the US has charged on foreign goods in over 100 years, CNN reported. After the tariffs took effect on April 9, they led to a sell-off on Wall Street, and the bond market rebelled, prompting Trump to announce a three-month pause to give nations more time to negotiate with the US.

says, as Trump sends letters","text":"Australian goods may not be getting slugged with higher US tariffs, but that does not mean the country is getting the best deal possible, the opposition says.\n\nDonald Trump has begun sending out letters to countries that failed to lock in new trading terms with the US.\n\nThe letters informed them their exports to the US would be hit with new tariff rates from August 1.\n\nThe countries included close allies Japan and South Korea, which both face 25 per cent imposts.\n\nFor others, the new rate is as high as 40 per cent.\n\nAustralia was not named among those facing “reciprocal tariffs” announced in April but was instead subjected to the universal 10 per cent taxes on all foreign imports – a position Anthony Albanese has said he did not expect to change.\n\nOpposition finance spokesman James Paterson said on Tuesday any tariffs on Australia were unacceptable but the Prime Minister had not given Australia the “best chance” of getting a carve out.\n\n“The only fair tariff on Australia would be 0 per cent, and I hope that’s what we get,” Senator Paterson told Nine’s Today.\n\n“But we haven’t given ourselves the best chance of securing that from the Trump administration because the Prime Minister has not even met President Trump now, seven months after he was elected.\n\n“In stark contrast to other world leaders, like the UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer who did secure an exemption from steel and aluminium tariffs for the UK because of the personal relationship that he formed with President Trump.\n\n“I really hope the Prime Minister doesn’t leave it any longer before he forms that relationship and argues for the best case possible for our country.”\n\nThe UK and Vietnam are the only countries to secure deals with the Trump administration.\n\nThough, neither have escaped the US President’s levies altogether, with Vietnam still subject to 20 per cent duties.\n\nUK Prime Minister Keir Starmer has said his efforts to build a strong personal relationship with Mr Trump helped secure tariff leniency, particularly on automakers.\n\nBritish cars were facing a 25 per cent rate, but that was dropped to 10 per cent.\n\nSimilarly, British steel and aluminium have remained at the initial 25 per cent rate, while Australian steel and aluminium have been swept up in the 50 per cent rate.\n\nBut speaking to Sky News, Assistant Treasurer Dan Mulino insisted the Albanese government was “clearly continuing to argue for the best possible deal”.\n\n“My understanding is that we are still at the position of having a 10 per cent tariff imposed, but the good news is that that is the lowest rate that any country has been able to secure,” he said.\n\n“So we’ll continue to argue for the best possible deal, and we’ll continue to argue for it to be lower than that.”\n\nMr Mulino went on to cite Productivity Commission analysis that suggested Australia could have an advantage over other countries because “if we’re lower than other countries, that might present opportunities for us to increase our trade with the US”.\n\n“In some situations, the tariffs the US imposing might also offer opportunities for us to secure goods from other countries that might be redirecting their trade to other parts of the world,” he said.","summary":"Just because Australia is not getting a letter from Donald Trump does not

Well, they’re in the country illegally, that's our job,” he said. “We told ICE agents in the process of going out looking for the bad guy — and this is the problem with sanctuary cities.

But How Long Can It Last?","text":"Cathie Wood, CEO of Ark Invest, oversees numerous exchange-traded funds (ETFs), including a family of funds that invest in technology stocks. \n\nThese funds have had some success in the past, with the Ark Innovation ETF (ARKK -0.91%), the largest one under the company's umbrella, returning nearly 60% over the past year through June 30. That's nearly four times the Nasdaq Composite's 15.7% return during that time. \n\nBut the fund isn't necessarily for the faint of heart, given its concentration in the tech sector. It seeks to invest in companies at the forefront of \"disruptive innovation. One of the Ark Innovation ETF's biggest winners has been Tesla (TSLA -6.72%). As of July 2, the fund owned about 2.1 million shares of the electric vehicle (EV) maker. That stake, worth over $630 million, represented 9.6% of the fund's assets, making it the ETF's biggest position. \n\nBut can Tesla continue to rocket upwards, or is it due for a crash landing?\n\nTesla's electric returns\n\nTesla, one of the \"Magnificent Seven\" group of technology stocks, has produced strong returns for shareholders. In 2024, the stock gained 62.5%, easily besting the S&P 500's total return of 25% and the Nasdaq Composite's total return of 29.6%.\n\nTesla's automotive business produces most of the company's revenue. In 2024, this fell 6% to $77.1 billion due in part to lower EV prices. Including services (e.g., used vehicles, maintenance services, supercharging, and insurance), the top line from that segment dropped 3% to $87.6 billion.\n\nIts other major revenue source is the energy generation and storage segment, which was a bright spot. That business includes selling, leasing, and financing solar energy generation and storage products, and it saw a 67% increase in revenue to $10.1 billion. However, it made up only about 10% of Tesla's total revenue. \n\nHas the stock boom ended?\n\nArguably, Elon Musk's relationship with Donald Trump, both during the campaign and his presidency, likely contributed to the stock price growth last year. But Musk and Trump have had a falling out, and it's difficult to analyze a company's long-term prospects based on personal relationships with politicians. The stock has lost 21.9% this year through July 2, badly lagging the S&P 500, which has gained 6.8%.\n\nAdditionally, portions of the Republicans' recently passed tax and spending bill would seem to hurt Tesla's prospects. The new law eliminates the federal tax credits for electric vehicles and solar energy systems, which makes those products more expensive for consumers.\n\nTesla was already facing challenges, including China-based EV giant BYD (BYDD.F -0.84%) (BYDDY -1.56%), which has been slashing its prices. The fierce competition has negatively affected Tesla's results. Tesla will report its second-quarter results at the end of the month, but its first-quarter automotive revenue dropped by 20% to $14 billion. That results in a total top-line drop of 9%, and its operating income under generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) fell by 66% to $399 million.\n\nManagement has already published its second-quarter vehicle delivery numbers, which showed that its sales remain under pressure. It delivered about 384,000 cars in Q2, compared to over 422,000 in the prior-year period.\n\nManagement has been investing in new technologies and products, like the fully autonomous Cybercab, which is scheduled to go into production next year. There's a potentially large market for such vehicles, and for the robotaxi service Tesla intends to build, but it's one fraught with challenges. The race to autonomous driving has seen a number of false starts from other companies.\n\nIt's hard to bet against a Musk-run company given the success he's had in his various ventures. However, given the challenges Tesla faces and its high valuation -- it trades today at a price-to-sales ratio of 11.6 and a price-to-earnings ratio of 173 -- I'd stay away from the stock. And for investors in the Ark Innovation ETF, I wouldn't expect the EV stock to be the biggest positive driver of the fund's future returns.","url":"https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/07/07/cathie-woods-tesla-bet-pays-off-again-but-how-long/","image":"https://g.foolcdn.com/image/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fg.foolcdn.com%2Feditorial%2Fimages%2F823765%2Ftesla-ev-electric-vehicle-charging-station-1200x800-5b2df79.jpg&amp;op=resize&amp;w=1200&amp;h=630","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-07-08 00:05:00","author":"CFA,Lawrence Rothman","authors":["CFA","Lawrence Rothman"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.186},{"id":339272922,"title":"King Charles' 'profound sadness' revealed in letter to Donald Trump","text":"King Charles shared a message of support in a letter to Donald Trump amid the devastating flash floods occurring in Texas, which have claimed the lives of at least 100 people.\n\nThe King offered his \"deepest sympathy\" over the disaster through the British embassy in Washington D.C., and shared his admiration for the incredible rescue and volunteer teams heading into the fray.\n\nShow of support\n\n\"Following the devastating flooding in Texas, His Majesty King Charles has written to President Trump to express his profound sadness at the tragic loss of life,\" the statement read. \n\n\"He offered his deepest sympathy to all families who have lost loved ones and paid tribute to courage and selflessness of the emergency service and volunteers.\"\n\nCentral Texas was hit with unprecedented rainfall over the Fourth of July weekend, with authorities warning residents to evacuate as soon as possible.\n\nFlash flooding\n\nCamp Mystic, a Christian summer camp, was devastated after the Guadalupe River rose over 26 feet in just 45 minutes, with over 27 campers and counselors confirmed to have passed away in the hours following. \n\nThe camp director, Dick Eastland, also lost his life in the disaster, and several campers remain missing. \"It was nothing short of horrific to see what those young children went through,\" said Texas Governor Greg Abbott in a press conference on Sunday. \n\n\"We won't stop until we find every girl who was in those cabins,\" he later added on X. \n\nThe camp released a statement on Monday sharing their immense grief over the disaster. \"Our hearts are broken alongside our families that are enduring this unimaginable tragedy,\" the statement read. \n\nCamp counselor Katharine Somerville spoke to Fox News about seeing the damage occur, and shared that many children were able to reach safety after being evacuated on military trucks. \n\n\"Our cabins at the tippity top of hills were completely flooded with water.

It's the president's utmost responsibility to put the interests of the United States first. That's how he views his job as president. So, he's going to ensure that America is fairly treated on the world stage, and he'll take any action necessary to prevent countries from taking advantage of the United States and our people.\"\nShe stated that Trump is \"closely monitoring\" the BRICS Summit, and he perceives these nations as trying to undermine the US interests.

He does not perceive these countries as growing stronger. He just perceives them as trying to undermine the United States' interests. And that's not okay with him. No matter how strong or weak a country may be.\" Her remarks come after Trump issued a strong warning to countries supporting what he termed the anti-American policies of BRICS. In a post shared on Truth Social, Trump stated that any country aligning itself with the \"Anti-American policies of BRICS\" will face an additional 10 per cent tariff on goods. \"Any Country aligning themselves with the Anti-American policies of BRICS, will be charged an ADDITIONAL 10% Tariff. There will be no exceptions to this policy. Thank you for your attention to this matter,\" Trump posted on Truth Social. https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/114809574296066307\nTrump's statement signals a hard stance from the US administration against what it sees as growing opposition from BRICS nations. The response came after the joint statement of the Finance Ministers and Central Bank Governors (FMCBG) Meeting of BRICS nations voiced opposition to the unilateral imposition of trade and finance-related actions, including the raising of tariffs and non-tariff measures.\nThe statement stated, \"We voiced our serious concerns with the unilateral imposition of trade and finance-related actions, including the raising of tariffs and non-tariff measures which distort trade and are inconsistent with World Trade Organisation (WTO) rules.\"\nThe statement further adds that \"In this testing environment, BRICS members have demonstrated resilience and will continue to cooperate among themselves and with other countries to safeguard and strengthen the non-discriminatory, open, fair, inclusive, equitable, transparent, and rules-based multilateral trading system with the WTO at its core, avoiding trade wars that could plunge the global economy into recession or further prolong subdued growth\".\nAltogether, BRICS nations--Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa, as well as many other developing nations that have joined BRICS over the last few years --account for nearly half of the world's population and about 40 per cent of the global GDP. The BRICS group now accounts for approximately a quarter of global trade and investment flows.

At least 27 campers and counsellors perished, with 10 girls still unaccounted for, according to authorities. The camp issued a statement saying: \"We have been in communication with local and state authorities who are tirelessly deploying extensive resources to search for our missing girls.\" On Sunday, Texas Governor Greg Abbott revealed that 41 individuals were still missing across the state, reports the Mirror US . Some officials in Texas have pointed fingers at the National Weather Service, suggesting the agency underestimated the rainfall. Kerr County's top elected official, Judge Rob Kelly, admitted on Friday: \"we do not have a warning system.\" He assured: \"Rest assured, no one knew this kind of flood was coming.\" An initial flood watch was issued by the local NWS office at 1:18 p.m. Thursday, predicting between 5 to 7 inches of rain. The NWS stated it issued a flash flood warning with a \"considerable\" warning at 1:14 a.m. Friday morning for Kerr and Bandera Counties. At 4:03 a.m., an urgent warning was issued, highlighting the potential for catastrophic damage and a severe threat to human life. The NWS defended itself, stating it held briefings for emergency officials on Thursday and issued sufficient warnings. Critics have questioned whether staff cuts to the NWS impacted the response to the storm. US President Donald Trump dismissed these claims on Sunday. He said: \"This was a thing that happened in seconds. Nobody expected it, nobody saw it. Very talented people are there, and they didn't see it,\".

What’s not great, according to Musk, is that Trump didn’t cut enough. So with the same unwarranted confidence he brings to all things, Musk has declared he is starting the “America Party.”\n\nLike all his efforts, Musk sees the creation of a new major party as a piece of cake, something no one else has yet succeeded at because they don’t have his big brain. So of course this will work, just as well as it worked with the Boring Company. You know, where Musk promised a network of high-speed underground tunnels where you could zip along at stupid speeds, but what we really got was a 2.4-mile stretch in Las Vegas where you get to toodle along in a Tesla driven by someone else. \n\nOr maybe it will work as well as the efforts to get to Mars, where Musk once promised crewed missions by 2024. Or perhaps it will turn out like his promises for full self-driving technology in Teslas, where we were supposed to be letting the Tesla computer entirely take over way back in 2016. \n\nPer Musk, breaking the two-party system is “not hard tbh,” which are the words of a person who has paid no attention to American politics whatsoever until buying Trump the presidency. If Musk bothered to look around, he’d see that American politics has been notoriously resistant to third parties, particularly celebrity-driven parties like the one Musk is proposing. \n\nMusk also displayed his profound lack of understanding when he declared that the new party was needed to “represent the 80% in the middle.” In reality, there are very few things that 80% of Americans approve of, and Musk’s wholesale destruction of the federal government is not one of them. \n\nExcept Musk isn’t actually going to try for widespread representation of those 80% at all. What he’s actually going to focus on are “just 2 or 3 Senate seats and 8 to 10 House districts.” Why? “Given the razor-thin legislative margins, that would be enough to serve as the deciding vote on contentious laws, ensuring that they serve the true will of the people.\n\nSo, Musk will be handpicking seats to install representatives and senators by deploying his enormous resources, but that’s not about representing the people. Instead, it looks much more like Musk has simply decided to shift his locus of control from Trump to Congress, and will use those people he ushers into office to ensure he controls vote outcomes. \n\nThe market doesn’t seem too wild about Musk’s latest foray into politics, with Tesla shares taking a bath as of Monday. This continues the tremendous drop in value Tesla has suffered since Musk made himself the face of the brutal cuts the Department of Government Efficiency unleashed. It turns out people do not like buying cars from a Nazi-saluting goon who played a key role in the Trump administration’s dismantling of science, public health, safety, and more. \n\nUnsurprisingly, Trump is not impressed with Musk’s efforts, initially saying that it was “ridiculous” to start a third party because “we have a tremendous success with the Republican Party” and “starting a third party just adds to the confusion.” After he stewed on it some more, he made a Truth Social post saying that Musk was going “off the rails” and was now a TRAIN WRECK. Perhaps Trump will renew his threats to Musk that he’ll have him deported. \n\nIt isn’t clear at this point if the America Party effort will get Musk’s full attention, as DOGE did, or if he will treat it like one of his products, where Musk’s spectacular pronouncements always collapse into a series of broken promises made by a congenitally arrogant and lazy man. Either way, Musk’s efforts aren’t meant to help anyone except Elon Musk.","summary":"Elon Musk is pretty cool with the fact that President Donald Trump’s “One Big, Beautiful Bill” gave a $1 trillion tax cut to gazillionaires like himself.

At present, there are only two pandas in the country, at Ueno Zoo in Tokyo, and those are due to return to China in February.\n\n“Japanese people love to see pandas and they are deeply symbolic, but it goes beyond that at a time like this,” said Hiromi Murakami, a professor of political science at the Tokyo campus of Temple University.\n“With the US administration being so harsh on tariffs on both countries at the moment, I think both sides are trying to build better relationships with other countries in the region,” she told This Week in Asia.\n“In this situation, pandas are effectively a bargaining chip that can be used to make bilateral ties stronger and, for China, to show to the rest of the world that it is willing to work with Japan and other nations and can be a regional leader.”\nImproved ties with its giant neighbour would appeal to Tokyo as well given current trade tensions, Murakami said. Trump on Monday slapped 25 per cent unilateral tariffs on Japan and South Korea, to take effect from August 1.\n“It’s not just because of this US administration, but it has reinforced the message that Japan really needs to diversify its trade and economic partners and build resilient supply chains,” she said.\nTo underline that position, she pointed out that new South Korean President Lee Jae-myung was pushing hard to arrange an official visit to Japan, just a month after he took office.\nJapan and the European Union announced in June a major upgrade to their cooperation in the defence sector, while Mitsubishi Corp is preparing to start importing liquefied natural gas from Canada in the coming months, with imports eventually expected to meet about one quarter of total Japanese demand.\n\nJeff Kingston, director of Asian Studies at Temple University, described discussions on the loan of pandas to Japan as another example of recent “softball diplomacy”.\n“There is a greater desire to seek common ground on both sides, with China relaxing some of the regulations on imports of Japanese seafood and the ministry of education in Tokyo announcing that it will cut living expenses for foreign graduate students,” he said.\n“Chinese students make up [more than] one-third of all the foreign students in Japan, so that will be a welcome subsidy.”\nKingston, however, said tongue in cheek that he did not expect Japan to make “major concessions” on the Diaoyu Islands – the disputed archipelago in the East China Sea also known as the Senkaku Islands in Japan – as a result of the pandas. “But the ripples of what is happening in America are travelling around the world.”\nChina may not even require a reciprocal move from Japan after the pandas are delivered, according to Murakami.\n“It is enough for Beijing to show that it is a leader in the region and is willing to work with other countries on trade and in other sectors,” she said. “China is becoming the guardian of this freer trading system, the system that the US used to control.”","summary":"Panda diplomacy is back in play as Japan seeks to charm visiting Chinese Vice-Premier He Lifeng with hopes of securing one or two of the endangered bears on loan.\nThe gesture could help soothe bilateral ties and signal regional unity amid growing unease over US trade policy under President Donald Trump, analysts have said.\nHe, a close adviser to President Xi Jinping, is scheduled to attend the the World Expo in Osaka for “national pavilion day” at the Chinese pavilion on Friday.\nThe Yomiuri...","url":"https://www.scmp.com/week-asia/politics/article/3317256/panda-diplomacy-boost-china-japan-ties-amid-us-tariff-anxiety","image":"https://cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2025/07/07/2e227a50-9c4a-4585-8c28-b14b9b0bfe7f_1607916d.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-07-08 00:00:10","author":"Julian Ryall","authors":["Julian Ryall"],"language":"en","source_country":"cn","sentiment":0.126}]}
