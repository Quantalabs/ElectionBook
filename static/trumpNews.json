Many Democrats are fighting me on that, I hope you continue because you'll never win another race,' he said. \n\nThe ban is 'to protect women,' he claimed.\n\n'Are you not going to comply with it?' he asked Mills.\n\n'I'm complying with state and federal laws,' she responded.\n\n'Well, we are the federal law... You better do it, because you're not going to get any federal funding at all if you don't,' the president said.\n\n'See you in court,' she responded.\n\n'Good, I'll see you in court. I look forward to that. That should be a real easy one. And enjoy your life after governor, because I don't think you'll be in elected politics,' a visibly angry Trump replied.\n\nTrump's order allows US government agencies to deny funds to schools that allow transgender athletes to compete on women's teams.\n\nMills told Trump 'See you in court' over the issue of trans women in sports as Trump addresses a meeting of governors at the White House\n\n'It was a little uncomfortable in the room,' admitted National Governors Association (NGA) Vice Chairman and Oklahoma Governor Kevin Stitt.\n\nTrump spoke at the Governors Working Session in the State Dining Room of the White House in Washington on Friday\n\nTrump made a similar funding threat on Thursday night as he spoke to a group of Republican governors. He said that he 'heard men are still playing in Maine' and that he would pull funding because of it.\n\n'So we're not going to give them any federal funding. None whatsoever, until they clean that up,' Trump said.\n\nSome Maine officials have said they will continue a policy of allowing transgender students to choose which team they play on, citing state law under the Maine Human Rights Act, according to the Portland Press Herald.\n\nMills and the state's attorney general have vowed to fight any move to deny the state federal funds, the newspaper reported.\n\nThe words cut through the room like a knife with some governors exchanging uneasy glances, while others, particularly Republican leaders, nodding in approval.\n\n'It was a little uncomfortable in the room,' admitted National Governors Association (NGA) Vice Chairman and Oklahoma Governor Kevin Stitt. 'But, like Governor Polis said, I wasn't sure exactly what the backstory was behind the conflict there.'\n\nColorado Democratic Governor Jared Polis said the spat did little to advance the NGA's goal of generating productive discourse. \n\n'We always hope that people can disagree in a way that elevates the discourse and tries to come to a common solution,' he remarked.\n\nStitt, a staunch supporter of Trump's policy, suggested that the moment might have served as a rallying cry for each parties' political bases. 'It may have been good politics for both sides,' he noted.\n\nStitt further underscored his support for Trump's stance, pointing out that he had spearheaded a similar policy in Oklahoma back in 2022. \n\nTrump forcefully reiterated his executive order barring transgender athletes from women's sports mandating scholastic athletics align with biological sex or risk losing federal funding\n\nThe confrontation in the State Dining Room was an unusual breach of the typically courteous interactions that lawmakers, even of opposing parties, have historically shared at the White House\n\n'The NCAA has followed that, I think the Olympics have. And then you have a governor saying that they're not going to follow that. So, I don't know what legal background she has, but they talked about seeing each other in court. And we'll see what happens.'\n\nDespite the acrimony, Trump, ever the businessman, sought to smooth things over with an offer that left some governors amused. \n\nHe assured state leaders that he was just a phone call away - especially if they were Democrats.\n\n'He is a businessman. He is not ideological. He wants to get things done,' Stitt explained, recalling Trump's jest that if both a Democrat and a Republican governor called at the same time, he would take the Democrat's call first.\n\nSouth Carolina Governor Henry McMaste revealed how Alabama Governor Kay Ivey had managed to secure direct lines to cabinet officials for better communication.\n\nMcMaster then joked Trump had offered an open line to all governors but wasn't exactly handing out his personal number.\n\n'I've got it, but I'm going to hold onto it,' McMaster quipped. \n\nA statement cited allegations that Maine's education department 'continues to allow male athletes to compete in girls' interscholastic athletics and that it has denied female athletes female-only intimate facilities, thereby violating federal anti-discrimination law.' \n\nThe US Department of Education's Office of Civil Rights said in a letter sent later on Friday to the commissioner of the state Department of Education that it was launching an investigation amid 'allegations that it continues to allow male athletes to compete in girlsÂ´ interscholastic athletics,' which it called a violation of federal anti-discrimination law.\n\nThe US Department of Education's statement said state laws do not override federal anti-discrimination laws. \n\nThe back-and-forth came in the middle of the president's remarks welcoming the nation's governors to the White House\n\nIf the state wants to continue to receive federal funds from the education department, it must follow Title IX to continue receiving federal funds, said Craig Trainor, acting assistant secretary for civil rights with the education department, in a statement.\n\n'If it wants to forgo federal funds and continue to trample the rights of its young female athletes, that, too, is its choice,' he said in the statement.\n\nMills called it a 'politically directed move' to strip funding 'paid for by Maine taxpayers.' \n\n'I imagine that the outcome of this politically directed investigation is all but predetermined,' she said in a statement. \n\nShe added: 'But do not be misled: this is not just about who can compete on the athletic field, this is about whether a President can force compliance with his will, without regard for the rule of law that governs our nation. I believe he cannot.'\n\n'If the president attempts to unilaterally deprive Maine school children of the benefit of Federal funding, my administration and the attorney general will take all appropriate and necessary legal action to restore that funding and the academic opportunity it provides,' Mills said in a statement before the confrontation with Trump. \n\nRepublicans hammered Democrats on transgender issues especially when it came to youth and sports ahead of the 2024 election, capitalizing on a broader culture war over LGBTQ rights.\n\nSince his return to power, Trump has demonized any recognition of gender diversity, attacking transgender people - a small minority of the population - and gender-affirming care for minors in both his rhetoric and in executive orders.\n\nOut of 510,000 athletes competing at the collegiate level, there are fewer than 10 who publicly identify as transgender, NCAA President Charlie Baker said in January. \n\nTransgender people make up less than 1 percent of adults in the United States, according to the Williams Institute at the UCLA School of Law, which studies LGBTQ issues. \n\nTrump has said he will also push the International Olympic Committee to change its rules on transgender athletes before the 2028 Los Angeles Games.\n\nMaineDemocrats\n\nShare or comment on this article:\nGovernors reveal what it was REALLY like inside room when Trump clashed with Maine's Democratic leader\n\nAdd comment","summary":"At a White House meeting, Maine Governor Janet Mills clashed with President Trump over his executive order on transgender athletes, defiantly telling him, 'See you in court.'","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-14425549/Donald-Trump-Maine-Governor-Janet-Mills-showdown.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/02/23/00/95486715-0-image-m-35_1740270760895.jpg","video":"https://videos.dailymail.co.uk/video/mol/2025/02/21/2939774103097524392/1024x576_MP4_2939774103097524392.mp4","publish_date":"2025-02-23 01:16:10","author":"Editor,James Gordon","authors":["Editor","James Gordon"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.03},{"id":293353802,"title":"Britain will 'turn the screws' on Putin with new sanctions on Russia, No10 assures Zelensky as Trump demands return on Ukraine aid money","text":"Britain will 'turn the screws' on Putin with new sanctions on Russia, No10 assures Zelensky as Trump demands return on Ukraine aid money\n\nPODCAST: Trump and Muskâs bromance and JD Vanceâs strong words for Zelensky â on Welcome to MAGAland\n\nBy GLEN OWEN POLITICAL EDITOR\n\nPublished: 00:54 GMT, 23 February 2025 | Updated: 01:06 GMT, 23 February 2025\n\nBritain will 'turn the screws' on Vladimir Putin with a package of sanctions against Russia to reassert the UK's 'ironclad' support for Ukraine, the Government will announce today.\n\nForeign Secretary David Lammy will make the vow as Sir Keir Starmer prepares to fly out for an historic meeting with Donald Trump at the White House â while Washington and Kyiv continue to haggle over demands President Zelensky hand over hundreds of billions of pounds of mineral reserves in exchange for US military support.\n\nDiplomatic preparations for the visit were thrown into chaos last week when the US president launched an extraordinary verbal attack on Volodymyr Zelensky, calling Ukraine's leader a 'dictator' who had 'no cards' in peace negotiations.\n\nTrump also said that the British Prime Minister and French President Emmanuel Macron â who will visit the White House tomorrow, three days before Sir Keir â 'haven't done anything' to end the war.\n\nIndicating that the Government would not dilute its support for Ukraine in the face of President Trump's attacks, Mr Lammy said he was planning to announce 'the largest package of sanctions against Russia since the early days of the war â eroding their military machine and reducing revenues fuelling the fires of destruction in Ukraine'.\n\nSpeaking ahead of tomorrow's third anniversary of the Russian invasion, the Foreign Secretary declared: 'This is a critical moment in the history of Ukraine, Britain and all of Europe. The repercussions of Putin's invasion have already been felt far beyond the front line.\n\n'Now is the time for Europe to double down on our support for Ukraine, in pursuit of peace through strength. On the battlefield we remain committed to providing Â£3 billion of military support a year to put Ukraine in the strongest position possible, and being ready and willing to provide UK troops as part of peacekeeping forces if necessary.\n\n'[This is] the time to turn the screws on Putin's Russia'.\n\nSir Keir Starmer is set to fly out for an historic meeting with Donald Trump at the White House\n\nWashington and Kyiv continue to haggle over demands President Zelensky hand over hundreds of billions of pounds of mineral reserves in exchange for US military support\n\nDavid Lammy has said that it is time to 'put the screws' to Putin's (pictured) Russia\n\nBREAKING NEWS\n\nZelensky 'refuses to sign' Donald Trump's 'problematic' minerals deal\n\nIt comes after Sir Keir told Mr Zelensky in a phone call yesterday â their second in four days â that he would urge Mr Trump to safeguard Ukraine's sovereignty. \n\nA No 10 spokesman said: 'The Prime Minister began by reiterating the UK's ironclad support for Ukraine and commitment to securing a just and enduring peace to bring an end to Russia's illegal war.\n\n'The Prime Minister repeated that Ukraine must be at the heart of any negotiations to end the war and that safeguarding Ukraine's sovereignty was essential to deter future aggression from Russia.'\n\nAmerican and Ukrainian officials are working on a draft agreement under which American could secure up to $500 billion (Â£400 million) worth of Ukrainian minerals.\n\nThe nation has Europe's largest reserves of titanium, used to produce alloys for aircraft and ships, as well as vast sources of lithium, for use in electric vehicles, and other minerals essential for high-tech industries.\n\nMr Zelensky said the demands of the US 'payback deal' went far beyond America's total contribution to the Ukraine war effort of $100 billion. Tensions between the two sides rose so high that Trump threatened to completely pull US funding from Ukraine and to cut Kyiv's vital access to Elon Musk's Starlink satellite communications system if it did not agree to the mineral rights deal.\n\nA senior White House official said: 'Zelensky is an actor who committed a common mistake of theatre kids: he started to think he's the character he plays on TV.\n\n'Yes, he has been brave and stood up to Russia. But he would be six feet under if it wasn't for the millions we spent, and he needs to exit stage right.'\n\nTrump has said that the British Prime Minister and French President Emmanuel Macron â who will visit the White House tomorrow â 'haven't done anything' to end the war\n\nForeign Secretary David Lammy said: 'Now is the time for Europe to double down on our support for Ukraine'\n\nThousands of protesters gathered outside the Russian embassy in London over the weekend to support Ukraine, amid increasing tensions between Washington and Kyiv\n\nDemonstrators were chanting 'stop Russia, stop the war' and 'Russia is a terrorist state', after marching to the embassy in Notting Hill on Saturday\n\nThousands of marchers take to the streets of London to support Ukraine at anti-Putin rally\n\nYesterday, a Ukrainian source said of the proposed deal: 'The agreement is not yet ready to be signed. There are a number of problematic issues in the current draft and the president is not ready to accept it. The drafts do not reflect a partnership... only unilateral commitments by Ukraine.'\n\nMr Zelensky said in his nightly video address to the nation: 'I look forward to the outcome [of negotiations] â a just result.'\n\nSir Keir also spoke to the president of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, yesterday, with the two leaders agreeing Europe must 'step up' for the good of collective security. \n\nMeanwhile, thousands of pro-Ukraine protesters gathered outside Russia's London embassy yesterday, with some brandishing placards which read: 'Trump, Musk and Putin are in denial of the truth.'\n\nDonald TrumpRussiaUkraine\n\nShare or comment on this article:\nBritain will 'turn the screws' on Putin with new sanctions on Russia, No10 assures Zelensky as Trump demands return on Ukraine aid money\n\nAdd comment","summary":"Sir Keir Starmer is set to fly out for meeting with Donald Trump, while Washington and Kyiv haggle over demands President Zelensky hand over mineral reserves for US military support.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-14425517/Britain-sanctions-Russia-Zelensky-Trump-ukraine.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/02/22/23/95485591-0-image-m-148_1740266533923.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-02-23 01:06:36","author":"Editor,Glen Owen","authors":["Editor","Glen Owen"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":0.164},{"id":293353818,"title":"Chief Scout and former SAS man Bear Grylls nearly became our US envoy, diplomatic sources claim","text":"Chief Scout and former SAS man Bear Grylls nearly became our US envoy, diplomatic sources claim\n\nPODCAST: Trump and Muskâs bromance and JD Vanceâs strong words for Zelensky â on Welcome to MAGAland\n\nBy GLEN OWEN\n\nPublished: 00:46 GMT, 23 February 2025 | Updated: 00:46 GMT, 23 February 2025\n\nTV adventurer Bear Grylls came within a whisker of becoming Britainâs Ambassador to Washington, diplomatic sources have claimed.\n\nHe is said to have been on a shortlist of three for the job, which went to former Labour minister Peter Mandelson.\n\nThe other candidate is understood to have been former chancellor George Osborne.\n\nGrylls, 50, an Old Etonian former SAS soldier who became Chief Scout, is well known in America through his programme Man vs Wild.\n\nTV personality Bear Grylls was in the running to be British ambassador to the US, sources have claimed\n\nFormer Labour minister Lord Mandelson, who was picked for the job, once called Donald Trump a 'danger to the world'\n\nFormer Tory chancellor George Osborne was also one of three shortlisted for the role\n\nLord Mandelsonâs appointment was mired in controversy because he once called Donald Trump a âdanger to the worldâ.\n\nWhen Grylls was asked if he had been âtapped upâ for the job, he said: âIâve got to honour privacy. \n\n'This is a golden chance for a positive reset with the US.

details of military aid for Ukraine alongside the sanctions, while the Home Office will launch a crackdown on Russian âdirty moneyâ, with Whitehall figures describing the plans as a âfull triple whammyâ. \n\nSir Keir is also expected to confirm a timeline to raise Britainâs defence spending from 2.3 to 2.5 per cent of GDP when he visits Washington, as well as giving Mr Trump an invitation for a state visit from the King. \n\nMr Lammy added: \"As we mark three years since Putin launched his full-scale invasion of Ukraine, we also mark three years of Britain standing united with Ukraine,

recording uncovers pilotâs incredible UFO sighting as âcylindrical objectâ passed within 10 feet of the aircraftâ","text":"LEAKED audio from a military pilot had revealed he saw a âweirdâ flying object pass his under plane just 10 feet away.\n\nReported during a Homeland Security flight over California, the close encounter with the âcylindrical objectâ occurred at approximately 2:30 pm on September 17, 2024.\n\nFormer FBI special agent and UFO investigator Ben Hanson shared the audio of the shocked pilotâs report with NewsNation.\n\nHe claimed that the flight was on a mission, most likely related to âdrug interdictionâ when the dark, football-sized object flew past the aircraft.\n\nHanson said the experienced US Air Force pilot was flying a Beechcraft 350 C at about 20,000 feet in controlled air space at the time.\n\nThe pilot, identified as âTroy 21â told the local air traffic controller in Los Angeles: âThis is going to sound weird.\n\nâI just had something pass underneath my wing.\n\nâMaybe a football-sized object right under my wing.â\n\nâIâve got my sensor operator looking for it on the camera right now, weâll see if we can find it,â he added.\n\nâBut it was like a dark gray, cylindrical object and it was probably the size of a football and it passed maybe 10 feet under our right wing.â\n\nShortly after the first sighting, the pilot communicated with air traffic control indicating an object visible on the aircraftâs air-to-air system.\n\nJust seconds later, he added that he could see an object on the radar 60 miles away, though it is not known if it was the same one.\n\nTo cover the distance in two minutes, the object observed passing under the wing would have had to be traveling at speeds exceeding 1,500mph, surpassing Mach 2.\n\nThis is something a drone could not do, especially at that altitude, the former FBI agent said.\n\nFollowing the pilotâs report, another air traffic controller said: âThere was a UFO reported here, but thatâs all taken care of now.\n\nâIt was earlier, but itâs gone.â\n\nBut Hanson said that the unknown presence of these objects in controlled airspace is incredibly dangerous.\n\nâThere are big problems with that happening in controlled airspace like they were,â he said.\n\nâAnd they werenât notified of any air traffic that was supposed to be in the area.â\n\nHe added that the pilots in the aircraft were âvery experiencedâ and due to the clear weather conditions, they could âget a good lookâ at the unusual object.\n\nThe leak comes just days after former UFO investigator Nick Pope told The U.S. Sun that Donald Trump needs to immediately set up a UFO czar.\n\nPope said the task force should work on developing a contingency plan for a potential alien encounter, he said.\n\nHe hopes that a czar would finally uncover the mystery that surrounds unidentified aerial phenomena that has haunted bureaucrats in Washington DC.\n\nIt comes after decades of allegations that the issue of unidentified aerial phenomena has been swept under the carpet and covered up by officials.\n\nBut calls are growing louder for transparency and disclosure especially as UAPs have been linked to national security fears and concerns have escalated that Americaâs enemies are penetrating the skies.","summary":"Internewscast

justify their work or lose jobs","text":"Elon Musk, the billionaire advisor to Donald Trump, said Saturday that all US federal employees must justify their work or lose their jobs, hours after the president pushed him to be \"more aggressive\" in slashing government spending.Musk â the world's richest person and Trump's biggest donor â has led the effort to fire swaths of the government workforce.\"All federal employees will shortly receive an email requesting to understand what they got done last week.

He's a character,\" Trump added. \"People said, what official position does he have? I said, 'Patriot'.\"Musk said this week DOGE was publicizing its actions on its website and that the transparency would hold him accountable.","summary":"","url":"https://tribune.net.ph/2025/02/23/musk-says-all-us-govt-staff-must-justify-their-work-or-lose-jobs","image":"https://media.assettype.com/tribune/2025-02-23/7lkepgny/00036UU9WR.jpg?w=1200&h=675&auto=format%2Ccompress&fit=max&enlarge=true","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-02-23 00:28:11","author":"Agence France-Presse","authors":["Agence France-Presse"],"language":"en","source_country":"ph","sentiment":-0.334},{"id":293351598,"title":"How Trump chose Dan Caine to be top US military officer","text":"Dan Caine may not have been on Washingtonâs radar before Friday night. \n\nBut President Donald Trumpâs fascination with the retired three-star general, his surprise pick to become the next chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, appears to go back to their first meeting in Iraq in 2018.\n\nCaine, then the deputy commander of a special operations task force fighting Islamic State, told the president that the militant group could be destroyed in just a week, Trump recalled during a speech to the Conservative Political Action Conference in 2019.\n\nSince then, he has retold the story about how he met âRazinâ Caine multiple times â and the praise has only grown more effusive.\n\nâHeâs a real general, not a television general,â Trump said in Miami on Wednesday, two days before his Truth Social post catapulted Caine from retirement to a nomination to be the most senior active-duty officer in the U.S. military.\n\nIf approved by the Senate, Caine will take over a military that is undergoing change in the first 30 days of the Trump administration and will inherit a Joint Staff rattled by Trumpâs surprise firing of the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Air Force General C.Q. Brown.\n\nCaine, a retired F-16 pilot, will be promoted to four-star general, and then have to undergo a potentially grueling Senate confirmation process to get a four-year term as the uniformed head of the nationâs military.\n\nJust last month, Caine joined a venture capital firm known as Shield Capital. \n\nHis LinkedIn profile showed that starting last month, he was associated with two other investment firms.\n\nUnconventional Pick\n\nCaineâs military career is a far cry from the traditional path to becoming the presidentâs top military adviser.\n\nPrevious generals and admirals have led a combatant command or a military branch of service.\n\nCaine did not rise that high in the ranks before retirement. \n\nAccording to Trump, he was âpassed over for promotion by Sleepy Joe Biden.â\n\nâBut not anymore!â, Trump wrote on Truth Social.\n\nEarlier this year, Caine described on a podcast how as a young man he wanted to follow in the footsteps of his father, a fighter pilot.\n\nâWe started moving around as a kid. So I felt like this was something that I really, really, really wanted to do, was fly jets in the Air Force,â Caine said.\n\nHe graduated in 1990 from the Virginia Military Institute with a bachelorâs degree in economics.\n\nCaine, who flew more than 2,800 hours in the F-16, was one of the pilots tasked with protecting Washington on September 11, 2001, when al Qaeda hijackers slammed commercial jets into the Pentagon and the World Trade Center in New York City.\n\nCaine realized he might have to shoot down a hijacked plane if one crossed his path.\n\nâI was very mindful that if we made a mistake or if we got it wrong or if we missed somebody and we did not shoot, the consequences of that could be catastrophic,â Caine, who has also flown the T-37 and T-38 aircraft, said in an article posted on the CIA website.\n\nCaine held a number of posts in the capital from 2005. \n\nHe was a special assistant to the secretary at the Department of Agriculture and then policy director for counterterrorism at the White Houseâs homeland security council.\n\nAccording to his official Air Force biography, Caine was a part-time member of the National Guard and âa serial entrepreneur and investorâ from 2009 to 2016.\n\nHe was most recently the associate director for military affairs at the Central Intelligence Agency, before his retirement late last year.\n\nBut it was his time in Iraq from 2018 to 2019 that helped him gain Trumpâs attention.\n\nCaine will be under particular scrutiny to ensure that he is apolitical, a concern that was heightened by the Friday night firing of Brown, a four-star general. Uniformed military officials are supposed to be loyal to the U.S. Constitution and independent of any party or political movement.\n\nA senior U.S. military official who has worked with Caine for more than a decade said he would seek to keep the military out of politics.\n\nCaine âputs the mission and troops above politics. He is not a political guy,â the official said.\n\nThe official added that when Caine found out he would be picked for the top job by Trump, his first concern was that Brown was taken care of and treated with respect.\n\nHow far Cain can keep the military out of politics may largely depend on Trump â who in the past has dragged the military into partisan issues.\n\nIn a recent re-telling of their first meeting in Iraq, Trump said that Caine was in the hangar where service members started putting on âMake America Great Againâ hats.\n\nâThey all put on the Make America Great Again hat. Not supposed to do it,â Trump said during a speech last year.\n\nâI said, âyouâre not supposed to do that. You know that.â They said, âItâs OK, sir.

'Hopefully this would get better engagement for UK PLC,' a senior source said.\n\nThe three 'keyholders' of Westminster Hall, where foreign leaders usually address Parliament, are the Commons Speaker, the Lord Speaker and the Lord Great Chamberlain, who is represented by Black Rod.\n\nAll three have to agree for a visit to take place, after a request is made by the Government. In 2017 then-speaker Mr Bercow banned Mr Trump from addressing Parliament during his state visit.\n\nAt the time Theresa May welcomed the President, who heaped praise on the Queen during the state banquet in his honour. But Mr Bercow used his veto power to block a formal address to Parliament based on Mr Trump's migration policies. He told MPs such a visit was 'not an automatic right, it is an earned honour'.\n\nSenior sources confirmed to The Mail on Sunday that this time both the Lord Speaker and Commons Speaker would welcome a visit.\n\nDonald Trump is set to address Parliament for the first time in a state visit\n\nSir Keir Starmer is expected to hand over an invitation to the President when he meets Mr Trump in Washington this week\n\nOne source said: 'Trump is the leader of the free world. He has just been elected with a large majority. Why would you want to say no? It will be interesting to see what he's going to tell Parliament.'\n\nThe visit would involve an address to both Houses of Parliament, with MPs, Lords and senior staff invited.\n\nLast night Mr Trump gave a wide-ranging speech at the Conservative Political Action Conference in Washington, touting the accomplishments of the first month of his presidency.\n\nThe PM will travel to Washington for talks with Mr Trump on Thursday. The two are scheduled to meet privately before posing together in the Oval Office and then holding a joint press conference. Sir Keir is expected to use the visit to announce the date by which he will boost spending on defence to 2.5 per cent of GDP, as well as\n\nreinforcing Britain's commitment to supporting Ukraine â in an attempt to convince Mr Trump Europe is prepared to do more.\n\nHe will also formally invite Mr Trump to a state visit, which would make the President the first elected leader to receive the invitation twice in modern history.\n\nThe PM will be accompanied by Foreign Secretary David Lammy. US ambassador Lord Mandelson is also expected to attend.\n\nLast night Sir Keir's plans to offer a state visit were praised by politicians from both main parties. One senior Labour MP said: 'It makes sense to offer a state visit. The Prime Minister needs to make clear he is not going to shift his position on Ukraine and the Russian invasion.\n\n'He can be firm on that while still being friendly â you have to do both things at once. He needs to be clear on what our values are, and say to Trump, we are your friends, instead of shouting at him.'\n\nThe MP added the visit 'is really fraught'. 'The question is, who is he going to pay attention to? We want that to be us.'\n\nDuring his first state visit in 2019 hosted by Theresa May, Mr Trump was banned from addressing Parliament by the then Commons speaker John Bercow\n\nFewer than one in five voters think Starmer will be able to build a relationship with Trump following their meeting this week\n\nThe last US president to address Parliament during a state visit was Barack Obama in 2011. Ronald Reagan also spoke to MPs in 1982 and Bill Clinton in 1995, although neither were during a state visit.\n\nA source close to Lord McFall, the Speaker in the upper house, said he would not object to Mr Trump addressing Parliament.\n\nIn 2017 his predecessor Lord Fowler criticised Mr Bercow's decision to ban Mr Trump. The former speaker had said to MPs in justification: 'After the imposition of the migrant ban by President Trump, I am even more strongly opposed to an address by President Trump in Westminster Hall.'\n\nIt is understood ministers are yet to make their formal approach to the Lords and Commons Speakers. But last night sources close to both Speakers said a repeat of Mr Bercow's ban would not happen. \n\nFormer Tory veterans minister Tobias Ellwood, who attended Mr Trump's inauguration, welcomed the state visit plans and said the Royal Family had to be involved, as it is 'one of the most critical aspects of Britain that Trump respects and wants, that the United States doesn't have'.\n\nHe added: 'If we're going to have any form of leverage, we need to be deploying it, 100 per cent.\n\nAny opportunity to improve backchannels, get your message across, to nudge the White House to think differently, should absolutely be leveraged at every opportunity. We need to persuade it is in America's interests to have a strong Europe. That is better done through state visits, through backchannels.'\n\nMr Ellwood, a fellow of the Atlantic Council think tank, added: 'We mustn't get distracted by the frenzy of commentary, or spooked by dramatic rhetoric. We want to keep America close.'\n\nBut some MPs warned talk of a state visit would be an unwelcome distraction from the big issues.\n\nLabour MP Alex Sobel said: 'Keir Starmer has rightly said the UK Government stands 'ready and willing' to act to guarantee the security of Ukraine as part of international efforts to get a lasting peace.\n\n'Tomorrow it is three years since Russia invaded Ukraine and attempted to capture Kyiv and overthrow the democratically elected government. All our efforts should be focused on a fair, just and lasting peace for the Ukrainian peoples.'\n\nThe last US President to address Parliament during a state visit was Barack Obama in 2011\n\nSources close to Mr Trump say they expect Thursday's meeting will be 'courteous and productive' despite tensions over Ukraine.\n\n'The President has always valued the unique relationship between America and Britain, longtime allies and friends. But he will continue to put the interests of America first,' the sources added.\n\nAs well as Westminster Hall, addresses by foreign leaders can also take place in the Royal Gallery or Robing Room, depending on the size of the crowd.\n\nMr Reagan addressed Parliament in the Royal Gallery after Labour's Michael Foot stopped him using Westminster Hall.\n\nAdditional reporting by Caroline Graham\n\nUkraineDonald TrumpKeir StarmerJohn Bercow\n\nShare or comment on this article:\nAfter his first-term snub, No10 hopes that giving Donald Trump his big day in Parliament could seal the 'Special Relationship'\n\nAdd comment","summary":"This is expected to involve Mr Trump formally addressing MPs and Lords - ahead of his first state visit he had been controversially blocked by former speaker John Bercow .","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-14425567/No10-Donald-Trump-Parliament-Special-Relationship.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/02/23/00/95486921-0-image-a-103_1740269796595.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-02-23 00:18:59","author":"Anna Mikhailova,Editor","authors":["Anna Mikhailova","Editor"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":0.111},{"id":293350192,"title":"Trudeau, Trump discuss Ukraine and shared border","text":"OTTAWA, February 22. /TASS/.

The short distance between him and them is insurmountable - and thereâs a wall of police vans in the way. \n\nIn front of him, a man in a Donald Trump 2024 hat cheers. A man at the back waves a flag that embraces the national colours of Germany and Russia. He would later describe Vladimir Putin as a âgood guyâ.\n\nâWe are in this constellation â¦ that has a deep love for its own,â says Mr HÃ¶cke, who was recently found guilty of knowingly using Nazi slogans. âAnd now, with Trump and [Vladimir] Putin together, we will continue this historic mission of Germany that has been put off for decades. We will be a bridge between the West and East, dear friends.â \n\nThe applause from the AfD camp jars against the cries of âNazis outâ from the other side of the square. \n\nIn less than 24 hours, Germany will go to the polls for nationwide elections. The popularity of the AfD, led by Alice Wiedel but in many ways guided by Mr HÃ¶cke, is swelling. \n\nAround a fifth of the population is expected to vote for them, good enough for second place overall behind the centre-right Christian Democratic Union (CDU), expected to win a little under a third of the vote. \n\nIn Thuringia, which sits in the middle of the spine dividing Germany, the AfD are the most popular. That their branch was designated a far right extremist organisation in 2021 isnât putting people off, nor is the controversy Mr HÃ¶cke has frequently courted since creating the branch the same month the AfD was founded in 2013. \n\nThe AfDâs popularity across the country has been driven by concerns over immigration, which though it declined last year is worrying a significant portion of Germans because of a spate of terror attacks. There have been three in the last three months after the coalition government collapsed and a snap election was called. At least nine people have been killed, including two children, and dozens injured. \n\nJorn Kaulhausen, 63, says he is an AfD supporter because he âcannot accept anymoreâ these attacks. âOur lives have changed,â he says, from the back of the rally in Erfurt. âA lot of people try to attack us with knives.â \n\nCaroline Litchtenheld, 22, agrees. She has spent the last two years as the head of the Young Alternative for Germany in Thuringia. âYou see all this death and of course you have to say the safety in Germany is decreasing,â she says. Germany must have a policy of âremigrationâ, she adds. \n\nIt is the AfDâs main policy and it is a euphemism for mass deportation. The phrase can also be found in Mr HÃ¶ckeâs book, Never Twice in the Same River, published in 2018, in which he called for a âlarge-scale remigration projectâ to reverse the effects of former chancellor Angela Merkel opening up the German borders to a million refugees in 2015 during the migrant crisis. \n\nOn the other side of Erfurtâs square, counterprotester Regina, 54, says this is clear evidence of the AfDâs racism and fascism reminiscent of the Nazi Party. âIt is not just foreigners that are criminals,â he says. âBut if a foreigner kills a German, the AfD are happy about it because they can use it for their political propaganda.â \n\nA spokesperson for the counter-demonstration then says they are there every time the AfD holds a rally because âwe donât want to give them our cityâ, nodding her head towards the other side of the square. \n\nThe CDU has vowed to be tougher on migration to address fears nonetheless, even accepting help from the AfD to pass a motion calling for a tougher stance on immigration. \n\nBut the expected future chancellor and CDU leader, Friedrich Merz, says he will respect the longstanding policy of not inviting the far-right into government to form a coalition. \n\nThis policy has been in place since the fall of the democratically-elected Adolf Hitlerâs Third Reich and the death of millions during World War II and the Holocaust. \n\nHere is where Mr Trumpâs administration has grown frustrated. \n\nUS vice president JD Vance said last week during a speech in Munich that what he called the censorship of the right was a greater threat to European democracy than Russia. The comments infuriated the German establishment, who said it was an affront to democracy. \n\nTech billionaire turned key Trump aide Elon Musk has fully endorsed the AfD, describing them as the âonly party that can save Europeâ. He has promoted them relentlessly on his social media platform X, bringing them in from the cold of the less-popular Russian site Telegram. Ms Wiedel is by far the most popular politician in Germany as a result. \n\nMr Trump himself, meanwhile, invited the AfD to his inauguration. And when he decided to have a call with Mr Putin to discuss ending the war in Ukraine, a move that left Ukrainians and their European supporters worried that a deal could be done over their heads that threatens the continentâs security and rewards Russian aggression, the traditionally pro-Russian AfD were equally happy. \n\nStefan MÃ¶ller, a member of the Thuringian State Parliament for the AfD and the second speaker behind Mr HÃ¶cke in Erfurt, says they are âvery gratefulâ to Mr Trumpâs administration for their interventions both in German politics and in European geopolitics. \n\nâI am a big fan of them,â he says. âThe politics, or political change, for which these three people [Mr Trump, Mr Musk and Mr Vance] are standing in America is exactly the political change that we are also planning in Germany. \n\nâIt is a refocus of politics on the normal population and their interests. And we want to achieve that, insofar as we are also involved.â \n\nOn the issue of relations with Russia and Mr Putin, he adds: âI think that [Russia] has to be an important partner for Europe and also for Germany so that a peaceful relationship can be based on mutual understanding.â \n\nFor all the bonds being done with like-minded individuals abroad, however, there is no peaceful relationship between the citizens of Erfurt on either side of the square. \n\nAs the counter protesters were escorted to their rally at the start of the day, some of the stragglers from the AfD were caught up in the crowd. \n\nA woman holding an anti-fascist placard collided with a man in a blue AfD hat. As they turned to face one another, she put out her middle finger and he burst out laughing. Then they quickly sped off. Neither had spoken a word.","summary":"The popularity of the AfD, led by Alice Wiedel but in many ways guided by Mr HÃ¶cke, is swelling","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/afd-germany-elections-thuringia-b2702954.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/02/22/22/57/IMG_6709.jpeg?trim=505,900,582,730&width=1200&height=800&crop=1200:800","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/lTLy6MyX-4VHSaSK0.mp4","publish_date":"2025-02-23 00:05:01","author":"Tom Watling","authors":["Tom Watling"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.05},{"id":293349534,"title":"Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni speaks via videolink to the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) on February 22, 2025","text":"Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni speaks via videolink to the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) on February 22, 2025 | National News | guampdn.com\n\nSkip to main content\n\nYou have permission to edit this image.\n\nItalian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni speaks via videolink to the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) on February 22, 2025\n\nROBERTO SCHMIDT\n\nPartners/afp\n\nAs featured on\n\nItaly PM says US, Europe to stay close under Trump despite tensions\n\nItaly's Giorgia Meloni told American conservatives on Saturday that the United States and Europe would remain close under Donald Trump, despite soaring tensions between the allies including over the fate of Ukraine.\n\nWATCH: Governor shares updates from nation's capital\n\nLatest E-Edition\n\nPacific Daily News\n\nPacific Daily News\n\nTrending Now\n\nMan sentenced to more than 8 years in prison for meth in the mail\n\nRing camera leads to arrest of civilian worker at Andersen Air Force Base\n\nMan finds his stolen trailer for sale on Facebook\n\nWoman accused of ramming unpaid rental car into tow truck\n\nGFD: Driver hits pole in Maite, care terminated due to injuries sustained\n\nLocal Events\n\nClassifieds\n\nProperty for Sale","summary":"Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni speaks via videolink to the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) on February 22, 2025","url":"https://www.guampdn.com/news/national/italian-prime-minister-giorgia-meloni-speaks-via-videolink-to-the-conservative-political-action-conference-cpac/image_0b269ccf-f957-5c00-818d-4658221e54d9.html","image":"https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/guampdn.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/0/b2/0b269ccf-f957-5c00-818d-4658221e54d9/67ba3ece55b73.image.jpg?crop=341%2C341%2C85%2C0&resize=200%2C200&order=crop%2Cresize","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-02-23 00:03:13","author":"Roberto Schmidt","authors":["Roberto Schmidt"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"GU","sentiment":0.051},{"id":293346898,"title":"Inside the Trump-loving gathering that wants to âsave Australiaâ","text":"National Harbor, Maryland: âLook at these crazy Australians, who let them in?â Benny Johnson joked as he took to the stage, gesturing to a rowdy group of fans up the front of the ballroom.\n\nâTheyâre from Australia, they escaped the concentration camps in Australia.

They deny the charges.\n\nThe men are also facing similar charges in the United Kingdom.\n\nThe women who have made the allegations against Tate have spoken out against Trumpâs efforts. Matthew Jury, the lawyer representing the four alleged victims, told the BBC they are âabsolutely bewildered why the Trump administration has decided to interfere in this way.â\n\nTate is a self-described misogynist who sells instructional videos instructing men how to pick up women and has advised men to physically assault women who cheat and to force them into sex. He is one of the most prominent figures in the right-wing âmanosphereâ of content producers popular among conservative audiences.\n\nHe is also a Trump supporter. After the 2024 election, Tate praised Trump as a âheroâ who âsingle handedly kept two evil war mongering she witches out of office,â referring to Sec. Hillary Clinton and Vice President Kamala Harris.\n\nFollowing his arrest, Tate has become a right-wing cause cÃ©lÃ¨bre. Donald Trump Jr. has described Romaniaâs legal action against Tate as âabsolute insanity,â while Trump financier Elon Musk has praised Tate for his long-shot campaign to run for British prime minister.\n\nDuring his 2024 campaign, Trump pandered to the misogynist manosphere with multiple interviews and appearances on the podcasts and other streaming shows that make up that world. Those appearances were seen as key to Trumpâs improved performance with young men in the election compared to the results in 2016 and 2020.\n\nTrump and figures in his administration like Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth have also extolled the virtues of misogynist, right-wing faux masculinity for yearsâa sentiment embodied by Tate.\n\nAdvocating for Tate, even with the distasteful rhetoric the influencer has used and the seriousness of the charges against him, are a pathway for Trump to show the manosphere and its audience that he is on their side and advocating for them. Many of these men share the world view that decades of fights for sexual equality are suppressing their rights and are yearning for a return to a misogynist system where womenâs views and roles are minimized.\n\nFurthermore, Trump himself is an admitted serial assaulter of women. He has bragged about groping women, been accused of sexual assault, and has surrounded himself with other men that have been the subject of similar accusations.\n\nIn Trumpâs view, Tate is a fellow traveler. Advocating for the misogynist also feeds into the false narratives promoted by Trump, Musk, and other conservative figures that international governments are in on a conspiracy to suppress âtraditionalâ (misogynist) values. \n\nWhen Trump rails against âwokeâ mindsets and pushes to purge it from the U.S. government by rolling back civil rights protections, that also applies to global governments. In their distorted view, Romaniaâs government is being too âwokeâ by restricting the movement of an accused sex trafficker.\n\nTrump is not tough on crime, as the freed perpetrators of Jan. 6 can attest to. But now that also applies to alleged crime in other countries, as long as the cause of fake masculinity can be advanced.","summary":"Explaining the Right is a weekly series that looks at what the right wing is currently obsessing over, how it influences politicsâand why you need to know.\n\n\n\n\nDespite his repeated claims that he is in favor of âlaw and order,â Donald Trumpâs administration is pressuring the Romanian government to roll back travel restrictions on right-wing influencer Andrew Tate, who has been accused of rape and human trafficking.\n\n\n\nTate is currently under house arrest following his 2023 arrest.

The state's sanctuary policies mean that courts and law enforcement do not have to comply with ICE orders.Homan's warning comes after sanctuary policies are coming under scrutiny as Homan and the administration have made similar warnings arguing that these get in the way of mass deportation and other enforcement efforts that have proven popular in polling both before and after the election.An Associated Press-NORC poll, conducted from January 9 to 13 among 1,147 adults, found that 83 percent of Americans support deporting migrants living in the U.S. illegally who have been convicted of a violent crime, while only 6 percent would oppose doing so.What To KnowSpeaking at this year's Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) in Maryland, Homan warned Cox that he is \"coming to Boston\" and \"bringing hell\" after the police commissioner said his department does not comply with ICE's civil immigration detainers.\"Police commissioner of Boston, you said you'd double down on not helping the law enforcement officers of ICE, I'm coming to Boston and I'm bringing hell with me. I looked at the numbers this morning, I stopped counting at nine, nine child rapists that were in jail in Massachusetts but rather than honoring an ICE retainer, released back onto the street. You're not a police commissioner. Take that badge off your chest, put it in a desk drawer because you became a politician. You forgot what it's like to be a cop,\" Homan, a former police officer and Border Patrol agent, said on Saturday.Cox, appointed by Democratic Mayor Michelle Wu in 2022, affirmed on local news station WCVB last Sunday that his department does not comply with ICE's civil immigration detainers.\"The Boston Police Department has pretty defined rules, and we abide by the law here in the state, and we don't enforce civil detainers regarding federal immigration law,\" he said.Cox added: \"Our department abides by Boston law and Massachusetts law. We don't have the authority to enforce federal immigration law. So, from our perspective, what we tell anyone who comes to visit our city or lives in our city is that we don't care about your immigration status. What we do care about, is are you a victim of crime in our city or are you a victimizer? We still hold you accountable for that, no matter what your immigration status is.\"This comes as courts in Massachusetts do not have to enforce ICE detainers after a ruling in 2017 by the state's highest court that was meant to tackle \"anti-immigrant policies\" during the early days of the first Trump administration.Maura Healey, then the state attorney general and now its Democratic governor, said in a statement at the time that the ruling would protect residents from illegal detention.In late January, Healey told reporters that Massachusetts was not a sanctuary state and that officials needed to follow the law when it came to immigration enforcement, especially when agents were targeting known criminals. The state's Democratic Attorney General Andrea Joy Campbell affirmed that leaders would not stand for any enforcement they saw as illegal.Homan's remarks mirror previous comments he made in November when he said he was willing to throw Denver Mayor Mike Johnston in jail over his protests about mass deportation.\"But look, me and the Denver mayor, we agree on one thingâhe's willing to go to jail, I'm willing to put him in jail because there there's a statute. It's Title 8 United States Code 1324 (iii). And what it says is it's a felony if you knowingly harbor and conceal an illegal alien from immigration authorities.

She got BOOED out of the Stadium. MAGA is very unforgiving!â \n\nKelceâs reaction to his girlfriend getting booed in the stadium was revealed with a source telling Dailymail.com, âTravis was aware of Taylor getting booed and he felt helpless. Seeing the look on her face got to him.â \n\nâHe always protects her and it broke his heart. He was already having a tough night and the fact that the stadium was predominantly Eagles fans didnât help. Travis knows that this hurt her and anyone can see this.â \n\nThe insider added, âItâs clear to many that the Eagles fans feel she is a traitor of sorts â being from Pennsylvania and even wearing Eagles gear prior to dating him. \n\nâTravis believes that it was unnecessary for Trump to take a dig at her especially after he voiced that he was honored for a president to be there.â \n\nThe source continued, âAfter Taylor being shut out for a Grammy and Travis losing the biggest game of the year it just hasnât been a good week for them. \n\nâBut he knows that even though this is not a happy ending to the season having her love gives him so much joy.â \n\nAfterwards, other stars came to the defense of Swift and shared their thoughts on social media as an offer of support. \n\nSerena Williams â who made a surprise appearance during Kendrick Lamarâs Halftime Show â penned: âI love you @taylorswift13 dont listen to those booo!!â \n\nDays after Taylor was booed and the Chiefsâ loss at the Super Bowl, People reported that the pair have plans to take a step away from the spotlight. \n\nâTheir lives have been a whirlwind since they first started dating. Things seem great between them, and theyâre incredibly happy together,â a source informed the outlet.\n\nThe insider added Taylor and Travis will âhave a break togetherâ and stated that the Super Bowl loss âwas upsetting for everyone.â \n\nKendrick Lamar notably took on the role of the Halftime Show performer and sang his diss track Not Like Us amid his ongoing feud with Drake. \n\nFans have since called for Swift to headline the Super Bowl Halftime Show and an insider revealed to DailyMail.com the singerâs stance on the job. \n\nâShe doesnât want to do it now until Travis is fully retired as she would like to be at the game supporting him rather than performing at it,â the source expressed. \n\nâWhen she eventually performs at it, she wants all her loved ones to be able to experience it. And as long as Travis is in the league, the Chiefs have a chance to be in the game, so she is going to wait to do it till he is officially done.â\n\nTaylor never performed the Halftime Show due to its affiliation with Pepsi. Swift notably has a longtime partnership with Coco-Cola. \n\nâIf Pepsi wasnât the sponsor of the halftime show for so many years, then Taylor Swift would have potentially already been the performer,â the source said. \n\nâBut she has had a long-standing partnership with Coke and sponsorship with them, so that was one glaring reason she was never able to do it.â \n\nHowever, the insider expressed, âTaylor is and always will be considered. And if she wants to do it, she will get the gig.â \n\nâThe NFL and Jay are throwing other names out there and they will have someone confirmed on their side of things this summer and then announce it in the start of next season or at the latest Thanksgiving.\n\nâTaylor is not in talks but is always a phone call away because the NFL knows they would be stupid if they didnât at least entertain the fact to her that she should do it.â\n\nThe source continued, âThey will continue to have their feelers out there and if she wanted to do it, again she would absolutely get it.â","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nTaylor Swift has reportedly lost nearly 150,000 followers on Instagram after she&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Taylor Swift Faces Social Media Backlash Following Super Bowl Performance first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/news/us/taylor-swift-faces-social-media-backlash-following-super-bowl-performance/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/rewrite-this-title-Taylor-Swift-LOSES-nearly-150000-followers-after.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-02-22 23:24:56","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","category":"entertainment","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.317},{"id":293345060,"title":"Australia treasurer to discuss tariffs with US Treasury's Bessent in Washington - TradingView","text":"Australia's Treasurer Jim Chalmers said on Sunday he would visit the United States this week to meet with U.S. counterpart Scott Bessent for talks, including about tariffs.\n\nChalmers told Australian Broadcasting Corporation television that he would leave for Washington on Sunday \"to hold one-on-one conversations with my Treasury counterpart,\" adding that trade and tariffs will be part of the discussion.\n\nThe trip comes after U.S. President Donald Trump this month agreed to consider exempting Australia from his steel and aluminium tariffs in view of its trade surplus with the U.S., following a phone call with Prime Minister Anthony Albanese.\n\nChalmers said he did not expect to conclude discussions on steel and aluminium while in Washington, but looked forward to meeting with Bessent for the first time since he was sworn into his role.\n\nAlbanese said this month he remained confident a deal could be reached with Trump given the \"tremendous start\" of Australia's relationship with the new U.S. administration.\n\nA key U.S. security ally in the Indo-Pacific, Australia is a small global exporter of steel, although it is the world's largest exporter of the main steelmaking raw material, iron ore.\n\nTrump, during his first term, exempted Australia from U.S. tariffs on steel and aluminium.","summary":"Australia treasurer to discuss tariffs with US Treasury's Bessent in Washington  TradingView","url":"https://www.tradingview.com/news/reuters.com,2025:newsml_L3N3PD04L:0-australia-treasurer-to-discuss-tariffs-with-us-treasury-s-bessent-in-washington/","image":"https://s.tradingview.com/static/images/illustrations/news-story.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-02-22 23:23:19","author":null,"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":0.022},{"id":293342534,"title":"Donald Trump Predicts Republicans to Defy History in CPAC Speech","text":"During his address Saturday at the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC), President Donald Trump predicted that the Republican Party will perform \"fantastically well\" in the 2026 midterm elections, defying the historical trend of the current president's party losing congressional seats.Why It Matters Typically, although there are exceptions, the political party currently in the White House loses congressional seats during the midterm elections.The 2024 election gave Republicans control of the U.S. Senate, the U.S. House of Representatives, and White House. If Republicans hold their majority through the 2026 midterms, Trump could enjoy four years of a Republican-led Congress supporting his agenda, along with a conservative-majority Supreme Court.What To Know Trump opened his speech in Maryland on Saturday by touting his staff, naming allies, and reflecting on his high polling numbers. Part way through his speech, he said, \"With the help of so many incredible supporters here today, we are going to forge a new and lasting political majority that will drive American politics for generations to come.\"CPAC is an annual gathering of leading conservative voices and Make America Great Again (MAGA) activists. This year's four-day event featured Elon Musk, Steve Bannon, Argentina's President Javier Milei, among others.The president then predicted that the party is going to \"do fantastically well in the midterms.\"\"We're at a levelâI don't think we have been at this level maybe ever, as a Republican Party. We are a bigger, better, stronger party than ever before. More people in our party than ever before,\" he said.Newsweek has reached out to the Democratic National Committee (DNC) for comment via email on Saturday.In last year's election, Trump won both the popular vote and the Electoral College, securing over 77 million votes and beating out then-Vice President Kamala Harris. The Republican president won all seven swing states, and more than 89 percent of counties shifted redder, according to The New York Times.Several high-stakes Senate races are already set for November 2026, including in Michigan following Democratic Senator Gary Peters' decision not to seek reelection, Georgia, North Carolina, and Maine.In order for Democrats to regain control of the House, they would need a net gain of three seats, and a net gain of four in the Senate. Voter turnout in midterm elections is significantly lower than general elections.Previous Midterm Election ResultsIn the most recent midterm elections in 2022, held during Democratic President Joe Biden's term, Republicans won control of the House, while Democrats retained a slim majority in the Senate. The election saw relatively high voter turnout, with Democrats outperforming initial forecasts.During Trump's first term, the 2018 midterm elections resulted in significant political shifts. Democrats gained 40 seats in the House, flipping control of the chamber, and captured seven governorships. Meanwhile, Republicans expanded their majority in the Senate.While typically the party in the White House doesn't fare as well during midterms, that was not the case in the 2002 midterms. Republican President George W. Bush saw his party make notable gains a year after the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, gaining eight seats in the House and two in the Senate.What People Are SayingLakshya Jain of Split Ticket, an election analysis and forecasting organization, wrote in an X, formerly Twitter, post in January: \"One side effect here is because these voters mostly don't vote in midterms, Dems could very plausibly change ~nothing and still win the national vote comfortably in 2026 while flipping the House and the Maine/North Carolina senate seats, before running into similar issues in 2028.\"Blake Allen, an attorney with 19,500 followers on X, wrote in a February 13 post: \"It's cold comfort for Democrats, but if Republicans move forward with the mix of: cutting Medicaid, cutting SNAP, cutting the taxes of corporations & rich Americans all the while raising taxes on the poor/middle class through tariffs the 2026 midterms are going to be wild.\"Red Eagle Politics, a political commentary account with over 105,000 followers on X, wrote in a January post: \"Both insane electoral hubris and total defeatism are bad for 2026. We're not guaranteed an asterisk midterm (party in power gains) just because Trump won, and an asterisk midterm is still possible if we put in the work.\"What Happens Next?Although the midterm elections are not until November 3, 2026, campaigning and fundraising for key races are expected to ramp up soon.","summary":"The president predicted on Saturday that his party will do well in the 2026 midterm elections.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/donald-trump-predicts-republicans-defy-history-cpac-speech-2034907","image":"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2593645/donald-trump-cpac.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-02-22 23:21:54","author":"Mandy Taheri","authors":["Mandy Taheri"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.101},{"id":293345058,"title":"US FDA asks fired scientists to return, including some reviewing Muskâs Neuralink - Reuters","text":"SummaryCompaniesFDA plans to rehire around 300 recently fired staff, sources sayRehiring follows Trump's firing spree, raising efficiency concernsElon Musk has been leading charge to fire federal workers\n\nFeb 22 (Reuters) - The U.S. Food and Drug Administration is asking some of its recently fired scientists if they will come back to their jobs, including some employees reviewing Elon Musk's brain implant company, Neuralink, multiple sources familiar with the matter told Reuters.\n\nThe FDA plans to rehire around 300 people in total, according to four sources with secondhand knowledge of the situation, following President Donald Trump's rush last week to fire employees at the agency responsible for reviewing drugs, food safety, medical devices and tobacco. Reuters could not verify the figure.\n\nAdvertisement Â· Scroll to continue\n\nElon Musk, the world's richest person, who oversees Neuralink and spent more than $250 million to help elect Trump, has been leading an effort to cut federal workers with his Department of Government Efficiency, including at the FDA. Thousands have been cut.\n\nIt is not known who ordered the firings and now the rehirings, according to sources familiar with the situation, including several employees caught up in the turmoil.\n\nAt least 11 employees working at the FDA's Center for Devices and Radiological Health - which oversees medical device reviews - have received calls since Friday saying they could return to work on Monday, according to eight FDA sources who spoke under condition of anonymity. Some of the sources were told the FDA would continue making requests to return throughout the weekend.\n\nAdvertisement Â· Scroll to continue\n\nIf the scientists agree to return, they would represent less than one-third of the staffers dismissed about a week ago. The White House told Reuters the administration had fired over 1,000 FDA staffers.\n\nThe FDA firings last week included about 20 people in its office of neurological and physical medicine devices, several of whom worked on Neuralink, Reuters exclusively reported. It is not known if all of the fired workers reviewing Neuralink have received the return offer.\n\nThe FDA had initially rejected Neuralink's request to start clinical trials, citing safety risks, Reuters reported in 2023.

Bringing these specific experts back would help fulfill that mission,\" said Scott Whitaker, CEO of the medical device industry group AdvaMed, which had criticized the firings.\n\nHundreds of jobs were cut that were funded by fees from medical device companies, banks, and others, not by taxpayers, raising questions about the Trump administration's stated goal of saving taxpayer money.\n\nAt least three of the employees asked to rejoin the FDA received termination letters telling them their performance had \"not been adequate to justify further employment at the agency.\" Reuters earlier reported that many of the fired employees had received exemplary rankings just weeks ago and had no performance issues.\n\nAnna Kelly, White House deputy press secretary, previously told Reuters that Trump had moved swiftly to cut wasteful spending and non-critical government jobs.\n\nReporting by Patrick Wingrove and Michael Erman in New York and Rachael Levy in Washington; editing by Caroline Humer and Rod Nickel\n\nPurchase Licensing Rights\n\nRachael LevyThomson ReutersPulitzer Prize-winning business correspondent based in Washington, D.C. who has reported on the inner workings of Wall Street, Silicon Valley, American health care and national security.

Many work outside of Washington. The cuts include thousands at the Departments of Veterans Affairs, Defense, Health and Human Services, the Internal Revenue Service and the National Parks Service, among others. \n\nAFGE President Everett Kelley quickly condemned the ultimatum as an example of Trump and Musk's âutter disdain for federal employees and the critical services they provide to the American people.â\n\nâIt is cruel and disrespectful to hundreds of thousands of veterans who are wearing their second uniform in the civil service to be forced to justify their job duties to this out-of-touch, privileged, unelected billionaire who has never performed one single hour of honest public service in his life,\" Kelley said. âAFGE will challenge any unlawful terminations of our members and federal employees across the country.â\n\nMusk on Friday celebrated his new role at a gathering of conservatives by waving a giant chainsaw in the air.

That launched his trajectory to run for president four years later. \n\nâNobodyâs ever seen anything like this and nobody ever seen four weeks weâve had,â he said, comparing to a game of golf, also repeating his lies of rampant voter fraud even though he won.\n\nâDespite that, they cheated like hell,â he said. âIt was just too big to rig. It was just too big to rig.â \n\nIn one corner of the auditorium, Trump was cheered on by those pardoned for their actions during the January 6 riot. Referring again to those prosecuted as âhostages,â the moment solidified the events that day not as something for which the President was morally responsible, but rather part of his lore which should be celebrated.\n\nTrump has plenty of reason to celebrate. After being impeached twice - the latter of which should have ended his career after the January 6 riot - he pulled off a return to the White House many considered unthinkable just a few years ago, winning every swing state in the process. The Republican Party that once felt uneasy about him at the helm has subsumed itself to his embrace. \n\nThe failed assassination attempt in July turned him into a quasi-religious figure. \n\nBut beyond Trumpâs conquest, the decision by CPAC to fully hitch itself to his movement showed how it lacks a coherent future.\n\nIn the past, CPAC served as an audition for ambitious young Republicans to see how they would be received by the base of the party. Marco Rubio, Ted Cruz, J.D. Vance and Ron DeSantis all at one point addressed the conference, as did Trump. \n\nNow, much like the GOP itself, Trump has eclipsed the rest of the conservative movement. Few up-and-coming voices descended on the Gaylord National Resort & Convention Center. Only a few rising stars like Florida congressman Byron Donalds, whom Trump backed to be governor, and Sarah Huckabee Sanders, Trumpâs former press secretary who now works as governor of Arkansas, came down. Unlike past conferences, Marjorie Taylor Greene and Lauren Boebert were not on hand. \n\nRather, much of the attention focused on talks with Trumpâs new administration. Attorney General Pam Bondi, his special presidential envoy Ric Grenell, his National Security Adviser Mike Waltz and his deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller served as the main attractions.\n\nTake Vance for example. On the first full day of CPAC, he was supposed to be the keynote speaker on Thursday as a sort of coming out as vice president. Last yearâs CPAC straw poll showed him as the conferenceâs favorite senator.\n\nBut instead, as has been the case throughout the first month of the Trump presidency, CPAC Chairman Matt Schlapp and his wife Mercedes announced that Elon Musk would speak later in the day. \n\nFew people remembered Vanceâs address, but almost all of the reports of CPAC led with images of Musk, whom as a naturalized citizen cannot run for president, wearing his Dark MAGA hat and shades, swinging around a chainsaw gifted to him by Argentinian President Javier Milei. \n\nVance couldnât even be his own man on a separate occasion. Before Trump took the stage, his campaign pollster Jim McLaughlin released the results of this yearâs straw poll showing 61 percent of attendees want Vance to be the 2028 Republican nominee.\n\nâAnd why? Because heâs viewed as the closest thing to Donald Trump,â McLaughlin said. \n\nSteve Bannon, who landed in hot water when he delivered what the leader Franceâs far-right National Rally considered to be a Nazi salute, came in second place. But instead of talking about the next generation, Bannon said he wanted to stay on the Trump train.\n\nâThe future of MAGA is Donald J Trump,â he said on Thursday to applause. âWe want Trump in â28. That's what they can't stand. A man like Trump comes along only once or twice in the countryâs history. We want Trump!â\n\nBannon proceeded to lead a chant of people shouting âWe want Trump!â\n\nIn the same token, Schlapp said after 2021, he and Mercedes rejected the idea of letting other people have their turn. \n\n âWe knew in our hearts, we knew in our souls that there was only one man ordained to do this most impossible job,â he said. \n\nBut hitching an entire political movement to one singular figure has significant perils. In one way or another, Trump will exit the stage. He could choose not to run again, he could lose again should he run for a third term, despite the U.S. Constitution forbidding it. Or he could die in office. \n\nFocusing entirely on Trump - especially given the fact he his specific politics have never been in line with conservative orthodoxy - risks his movement dying with him.\n\nPolitical parties ostensibly exist to prevent ideological movements investing entirely in one person. \n\nFor all their mewling and moping after losing to Trump, the Democratic Party is behaving like a proper party, figuring out what went wrong, what to do next and how to win again. \n\nIt will be messy, but necessary if Democrats want to ever return to the White House or control the House of Representatives or the Senate again. \n\nBut CPAC shows that while Trumpworld is victorious now, it has yet to create a long-term plan for the future.","summary":"Trump is triumphant.

Email tips@dailymail.com \nBy DEIRDRE DURKAN-SIMONDS FOR DAILYMAIL.COM \n Published:22:57 GMT, 22 February 2025 |Updated:23:16 GMT, 22 February 2025 \n\nSpider-Man 4 has been pushed back by a week.\nThe fourth movie, starring Tom Holland as the titular superhero, will now hit cinemas on July 31, 2026, instead of July 24, 2026, Sony has confirmed.\nThe blockbuster - which is being helmed by Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings director Destin Daniel Cretton - will be released two weeks after Holland's Christopher Nolan film The Odyssey.\nThe 28-year-old actor previously revealed filming is due to start this summer.\nDuring an appearance on The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon in October, the host asked the Marvel star what he knew about the movie, to which Holland simply said: 'It's happening.'\nAfter Fallon pushed the actor for more information, Holland revealed: 'Yeah, next summer. Next summer we start shooting, everything's good to go, we're nearly there, super exciting. I can't wait.'\n\nSpider-Man 4, starring Tom Holland as the titular superhero, will now hit cinemas on July 31, 2026, instead of July 24, 2026 (Holland seen in 2022)\nWhile plot details are being kept under wraps, the upcoming flick will see Holland and his real-life fiancÃ©e Zendaya, also 28, reprise their respective roles as Peter Parker and his partner MJ.\nThe Uncharted star previously teased he and Zendaya were 'bouncing around the room' with excitement after reading the first draft of the script. \n\n Tom Holland shares first reaction to Spider-Man 4 after reading script with Zendaya \n'It needs work, but the writers are doing a great job,' Holland said on the Rich Roll Podcast in October.\n'I read it three weeks ago, and it really lit a fire in me. Zendaya and I sat down and read it together, and we at times were bouncing around the living room like, \"This is a real movie worthy of the fans' respect.\" But there's a few things we need to figure out before we can get that really going, but it's exciting.'\nThe actor added it was important for the team to consider that the flick had to fit into the wider story of the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU).\nHe explained: 'One of the things to bear in mind with Marvel is that your film is a small cog in a large machine.\n'And that machine has got to keep running. And you need to make sure you can fit into that timeline at the right time to benefit the bigger picture.\n'That's one of the challenges we're facing. The time in which we need to get that done is a tall order but definitely achievable with the fantastic people we have working on it now.'\n\nThe blockbuster - which is being helmed by Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings director Destin Daniel Cretton - will be released two weeks after Holland's Christopher Nolan film The Odyssey (Holland and Zendaya pictured in 2018)\nHolland has portrayed Peter Parker/Spider-Man in three films: Homecoming (2017), Far From Home (2019) and No Way Home (2021).\nHe's also starred as the Marvel superhero in Captain America: Civil War, Avengers: Infinity War and Avengers: Endgame.\nBefore Holland, Tobey Maguire and Andrew Garfield famously portrayed the masked crusader on the big screen.\nMeanwhile, Zendaya has starred in all three films with Holland as Peter Parker's classmate-turned-girlfriend Michelle 'MJ' Jones-Watson.\nIn April 2024, Holland confirmed he would be returning for a fourth Spider-Man film.\n'The simple answer is that I'll always want to do Spider-Man films,' he told reporters at the Sands International Film Festival in St. Andrews, Scotland.\n'I owe my life and career to Spider-Man. So the simple answer is yes. I'll always want to do more.'\n\nThe 28-year-old actor previously revealed filming is due to start this summer\n'We have the best in the business working toward whatever the story might be. But until we've cracked it, we have a legacy to protect. The third movie was so special in so many ways that we need to make sure we do the right thing.\n'This is the first time in this process that I've been part of the creative so early. It's just a process where I'm watching and learning. It's just a really fun stage for me. Like I said, everyone wants it to happen.\n'But we want to make sure we're not overdoing the same things,' he added.\n2021's Spider-Man: No Way Home ended on a dramatic cliffhanger as Doctor Strange (played by Benedict Cumberbatch) cast a spell that erased the world's memory of Peter Parker, including that of his girlfriend MJ (Zendaya).\nA fourth Spider-Man film was first confirmed by Marvel Studios president Kevin Feige in 2023.\nHe dished to Entertainment Weekly that a 'story' had been written.\n\nDuring an appearance on The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon in October, the host asked the Marvel star what he knew about the movie, to which Holland simply said: 'It's happening' (seen in 2021)\n'All I will say is that we have the story. We have big ideas for that, and our writers are just putting pen to paper now,' he teased.\nHowever, development was stalled in May 2023 due to the Writers Guild Of America (WGA) strike, which lasted 148 days.\nMonths after the strike ended, Holland worried Spider-Man fans when he told the Critics Choice Association that he'd only return for a fourth film if they could do the character 'justice.'\n'All I can say is that we have been actively engaging in conversations about what it could potentially look like for a fourth rendition of my character,' he revealed at the time.\n'Whether or not we can find a way to do justice to the character is another thing.'\nThe Spider-Man trilogy starring Holland was helmed by director Jon Watts.\n\nWhile plot details are being kept under wraps, the upcoming flick will see Holland and his real-life fiancÃ©e Zendaya, also 28, reprise their respective roles as Peter Parker and his partner MJ; seen in 2024\n\nBut director Destin Daniel Cretton â known for Marvel's Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings (2021) has been in 'talks' to takeover the franchise, as confirmed by Variety in September.\nHolland and Zendaya famously fell in love while making the Spider-Man franchise.\nFive years after meeting on set for the first time in 2016, they confirmed their romance in 2021 when they were caught kissing in public.\nSince then, the beloved Hollywood couple have been living together and they've also faced engagement rumors in recent years.\nMost recently, Zendaya supported Holland by attending several productions of his stage play Romeo & Juliet in Londonâs West End.\nTom HollandZendaya\n\nShare or comment on this article: \nTom Holland's Spider-Man 4 has been pushed back\n\nAdd comment\n\nEnter search term:\n\nJustin Bieber has heated confrontation with paparazzi while out with wife Hailey in Los Angeles\n\nHelen Flanagan, 34, cruelly mum-shamed after posing in busty black dress for night out with her boyfriend Robbie Talbot, 45, and his daughter Sophie, 14\n\nKim Kardashian wows in a busty bikini as she takes a splash for playful beach photo shoot in Los Angeles\n\nBikini-clad Millie Bobby Brown relaxes in a hammock while reading her own Vanity Fair cover in Turks and Caicos\n\nKATIE HIND: Impeccably dressed, musical children - the clues Bridget Jones film's pushy mum Perfect Nicolette is based on Myleene Klass\n\nLooking to boost your gut health?

Janet Millsâ public dust-up with President Donald Trump during a White House meeting with most of Americaâs state leaders didnât live up to governorsâ collective goal of âdisagree[ing] better,â the National Governors Association chairman said Saturday.\n\nColorado Democratic Gov. Jared Polis was asked about the exchange â in which Trump challenged Maine to comply with his executive order on transgender athletes in school sports, and Mills told Trump âsee you in court.â \n\nThe president remarked that any state that does not align its scholastic athletics with biological sexes will not receive federal funding.\n\nâAs governors, we have our prior initiative that we continue to work on is to disagree better,â Chairman Polis said.\n\nâWe always hope that people can disagree in a way that elevates the discourse and tries to come to a common solution around . . . what the issue is. I donât think that that disagreement is necessarily a model of that,â he continued, adding that some governors may not have known the origins of the fiery exchange at the time.\n\nPolis said governors do have the right to sue the federal government but that there are also other ways to understand where respective parties are coming from.\n\nâIt was a little uncomfortable in the room,â added NGA Vice Chairman Kevin Stitt, Oklahomaâs GOP governor.\n\nâBut like, like Governor Polis said, I wasnât sure exactly what the backstory was behind the conflict there. Apparently, there had been some things that both sides have said.â\n\nStitt remarked that the exchange may have been âgood politicsâ for both Mills and Trump with their respective bases.\n\nHe added that he personally agrees with Trumpâs stance and noted that he led a push in 2022 to ensure that scholastic athletes are competing against people of their own biological sex in Oklahoma.\n\nâThe NCAA has followed that, I think the Olympics have. And then you have a governor saying that theyâre not going to follow that. So, I donât know what legal background she has, but they talked about seeing each other in court. And weâll weâll see what happens on it.â\n\nPolis added that Mills maintained that she is following current federal law under her current stance.\n\nLater, Stitt said that Trump had invited all governors to give him a call, and had quipped that if a Democrat and a Republican call at the same time, he will take the Democratâs call first.\n\nâHe is a businessman. He is not ideological. He wants to get things done,â Stitt said.\n\nAt the White House meeting, Alabama Gov. Kay Ivey successfully asked cabinet officials to share their direct lines, to better facilitate cooperation between states and the Trump administration. \n\nThat nugget was revealed by South Carolina Gov. Henry McMaster, who quipped that ther president had also offered governors an open line â but did not explicitly publicize his number.\n\nâIâve got it, but Iâm going to hold onto it,â McMaster joked.","summary":"Maine DemocraticÂ Gov.

Twenty people were rescued, Panamanian border police confirmed, adding they âare deeply sorry about the death of the minor.â\n\nA growing number of migrants who once hoped to reach the U.S. have begun a âreverse flowâ back to their countries of origin due to a tightening of immigration policy under U.S. President Donald Trump.\n\nMany of those migrants waited for months, sometimes more than a year, to apply for formal asylum in the U.S. using the Biden-era CBP One app. Those hopes were washed away when Trump took office and immediately closed down the app.\n\nPanama has not shared figures on how many migrants in the âreverse flowâ pass through the country per day, but in neighboring Costa Rica, an official told The Associated Press this week they were seeing between 50 and 75 new migrants traveling south daily.\n\nWith few resources or ways to get home, many South American migrants have started to travel home to their Andean countries with the help of smugglers. They often use small, motorized boats that travel through the Guna Yala, an archipelago with hundreds of small islands in the Caribbean.\n\nThe boats often make trips between nearby coastal communities in Colombia and Panama.\n\nOne pair of migrants who spoke to AP said they wanted to take the marine route because it was safer than traveling through the perilous jungled trenches of the Darien Gap, which divides Panama and Colombia.\n\nSmugglers once raked in money when migration flows north were heavy more than a year ago, and continue to make a smaller profit on migrants traveling back.\n\nPanamaâs National Coastal Service said in a statement that Saturdayâs boat capsizing was due to heavy swells in the archipelago. Border police and villagers were carrying out search and rescue efforts.\n\nMeanwhile, dozens of other migrants were being transported on Saturday to Guna Yala to begin their return by sea.","summary":"The boat, full of mostly Venezuelans and Colombians, carried 21 people in total.","url":"https://nypost.com/2025/02/22/world-news/8-year-old-boy-dies-as-boat-carrying-migrants-capsizes-off-panama-coast/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/02/99024406.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/SymBpEI7-RyIcpnTz.mp4","publish_date":"2025-02-22 23:15:24","author":"Associated Press","authors":["Associated Press"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.22},{"id":293339626,"title":"Arab Parliamentary Conference Reaffirms Support for Qatar and Egypt's Efforts to Maintain Gaza Ceasefire Agreement","text":"Cairo, February 22 (QNA) - The 7th conference of the Arab Parliament and the Presidents of Arab Councils and Parliaments, organized by the Arab Parliament and the Arab Inter-Parliamentary Union at the headquarters of the General Secretariat of the Arab League in Cairo today, reaffirmed its full support for the State of Qatar and the Arab Republic of Egypt's efforts in securing a ceasefire agreement in the Gaza Strip, the exchange of detainees, and the delivery of aid, condemning any Israeli attempt to obstruct this agreement.\n\nThis came as part of a plan for Arab parliamentary action outlined in the conference's final communique, which includes a road-map of 15 points outlining the steps and actions to be taken by Arab parliamentarians in the near future to support the steadfastness of the Palestinian people on their land, rejecting any plans for displacement, annexation, or the liquidation of the Palestinian cause.\n\nThis includes requesting that the Inter-Parliamentary Union and regional parliaments form parliamentary committees to visit the Gaza Strip to examine Israeli war crimes committed against Palestinian civilians, in addition to an endeavor for the upcoming Inter-Parliamentary Union meeting to issue an international parliamentary resolution rejecting all displacement plans and attempts to liquidate the Palestinian cause.\n\nMoreover, the Arab parliamentary action plan calls for intensifying communication with the parliaments of: A) countries that have suspended funding to the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA) and B) countries that recognized Jerusalem as the capital of Israel or moved their embassies there, to urge them to reverse these decisions.\n\nIt also includes a call for Arab parliaments to coordinate efforts to freeze the membership of the Israeli parliament in the Inter-Parliamentary Union and regional parliamentary organizations.\n\nThe action plan also proposed the formation of a joint parliamentary committee from both the Arab Parliament and the Arab Inter-Parliamentary Union to facilitate the execution of the plan's recommendations.\n\nIn a related context, the conference reiterated its complete rejection of all forms of displacement of the Palestinian people from their historic land, including such calls made by US President Donald Trump.\n\nThe conference also adopted a document setting out the ten core principles informing the Arab stance on the Palestinian cause, these include the full support for the Palestinian people's inalienable and legitimate rights, including their right to self-determination, ending the occupation, and establishing their independent state with Jerusalem as its capital.\n\nThe document and the action plan will be submitted to the upcoming emergency Arab Summit, to be hosted by the Arab Republic of Egypt on March 4, in an effort to integrate diplomacy and parliamentary action to support the steadfastness of the Palestinian people.

months after Vauxhall bosses blamed Labour's EV mandate for death of Luton car plant","text":"BMW has paused a planned Â£600million investment in its UK car manufacturing plant because of uncertainty in the industry.\n\nIn 2023, it was announced the Mini brand would be made all-electric by 2030 with production due to start in Oxford in 2026.\n\nBut due to 'multiple uncertainties facing the automotive industry', the BMW Group said it is now rethinking the plan - and is currently making the British icon's next generation at plants in China.\n\nMini has said construction in Oxford was underway 'to make the plant future ready' but has told the UK government it will be reviewing the timeline for production, knocking back a Â£60million grant from ministers for the project at the same time.\n\nA spokesperson for BMW said: 'Given the multiple uncertainties facing the automotive industry, the BMW Group is currently reviewing the timing for reintroducing battery-electric Mini production in Oxford.\n\n'As part of this discussion, we agreed not to take the previously announced grant, but we remain in close dialogue about our future plans.'\n\nIt was initially promised that the electric vehicle initiative at the plant in Cowley would help secure jobs in Oxford and at a body-pressing facility in Swindon.\n\nBut BMW's decision to delay the reintroduction of electric vehicles at the Oxford BMW factory - where petrol Minis are made - will likely lead to a loss in expected employment and spending in the country.\n\nInstead, the electric version of the British icon is currently being produced at a plant in Zhangjiagang, China.\n\nThe move comes months after Vauxhall parent firm Stellantis blamed Labour's electric vehicle mandate for the closure of their van plant in Luton, which put 1,100 jobs at risk.\n\nThe UK's zero emissions vehicle (ZEV) mandate requires car firms to sell a certain amount of electric cars each year or face financial penalties.\n\nThis year, they require 28 per cent of all new car sales in the UK to be zero-emission vehicles. \n\nThe government has already faced backlash from the UK automotive industry, which has said the expectations are too high and not enough is being done to support car makers and encourage the uptake of electric cars.\n\nThe general consensus among motoring industry experts and executives is that the government need to show support including tax breaks to convince drivers to switch away from petrol and diesel. \n\nAcademics say demand for EVs has 'flatlined' because of their huge upfront cost compared to petrol and diesel rivals and concerns over running out of battery.\n\nDr Jonathan Owens, a senior lecturer at the University of Salford's business school, previously told MailOnline the mandate has become 'more of a hinderance than a help'.\n\nHe said: 'While charge point numbers are increasing, this needs to accelerate further to align support with the ZEV mandate for manufacturer's targets, which will also support consumer confidence to buy into the market.'\n\nCar makers also face stiff competition from Chinese brands such as BYD and the now Chinese-owned MG, which make very cheap electric cars at an unimaginable scale.\n\nSubsequently, Britain's car market is flooded with cheap Chinese imports putting jobs and investment at risk. \n\nThe Department for Transport said it recognised the challenges car manufacturers were facing but the majority of manufacturers are on track to meet their ZEV mandate targets.\n\nOn top of that the industry is contending with US President Donald Trump's threat to impose a 25 per cent tariff on all U.S. auto imports.\n\nHe has long railed against what he calls the unfair treatment of US automotive exports in foreign markets and vowed to impose levies 'in the neighborhood of 25 per cent' on imported vehicles. \n\nMr Trump said the automotive tariffs could come as soon as April 2, the day after members of his cabinet are due to deliver reports to him outlining options for a range of import duties as he seeks to reshape global trade.","summary":"BMW has paused its Â£600million investment in the UK because of uncertainty in the industry.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-14425367/BMW-600million-plan-electric-Minis-Britain-industry-Vauxhall-Labours-EV-mandate-Luton.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/02/22/22/95484737-0-image-a-82_1740264772985.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-02-22 23:04:13","author":"Editor,Jordana Seal","authors":["Editor","Jordana Seal"],"language":"en","source_country":"GB","sentiment":-0.357},{"id":293342424,"title":"Bikini-clad Millie Bobby Brown relaxesÂ  in a hammock while reading her own Vanity Fair cover in Turks and Caicos","text":"Black Friday\n\nKim Kardashian\n\nVictoria Beckham\n\nHarry Styles\n\nAmanda Holden\n\nBritain's Got Talent\n\nPrivacy Policy\n\nSaturday, Feb 22nd 2025\n\n5-Day Forecast\n\nAdvertisement\n\nKnock knock, it's the Thought Police: As thousands of criminals go uninvestigated, detectives call on a grandmother.

Email tips@dailymail.com\nBy AMY LAMARE and CARLY JOHNSON FOR DAILYMAIL.COM \n Published:23:02 GMT, 22 February 2025 |Updated:23:03 GMT, 22 February 2025 \n\nMillie Bobby Brown took a moment to relax after ringing in her 21st birthday with husband Jake Bongiovi and friends in Turks and Caicos.\nThe Stranger Things star posted three photos to her Instagram and captioned it 'birthday magic.'\nShe tagged the location as Long Bay Beach, Turks and Caicos Island.\nIn one photo, she lounges in a hammock in an itty bitty, red-trimmed bikini reading an issue of Vanity Fair featuring her on the cover.\nThe crystal clear Caribbean sea could be seen feet away from the actress as she browse through her magazine.\nShe also shared a snap building sand castles with two girlfriends and another of herself leaning off of a boat to look at a shark just beneath the surface of the water. \n\nMillie Bobby Brown took a moment to relax after ringing in her 21st birthday with husband Jake Bongiovi and friends in Turks and Caicos\n\nBrown looked nearly unrecognizable with her new blonde hair, which she debuted on her birthday.\nSince wrapping the fifth and final season of Netflix's Stranger Things in December, Brown has been enjoying some rare downtime.\n\n Millie Bobby Brown rocks sparkly bustier and new blonde hair as she rings in her 21st birthday \nLast year, she married Jake, the model son of rocker Jon Bon Jovi and Dorothea Hurley.\nJake paid tribute to Millie on her birthday by sharing a sweet post to his own Instagram.\n'Happy 21st baby. I love you so much,' 22-year-old captioned the post, which included a mirror selfie of him with a bikini-clad Millie.\nInstead of embracing the Hollywood life, the happy couple have been living on a farm in rural Georgia with their many pets.\nWhile Brown has been enjoying the 'trad life,' she told Vanity Fair earlier this month that it is not all tulips and sunshine.\nShe admitted that there are some downsides with the 'simple life' approach.\n\nThe Stranger Things star posted three photos to her Instagram and captioned it 'birthday magic'\n\nShe tagged the location as Long Bay Beach, Turks and Caicos Island\n\nBrown looked nearly unrecognizable with her new blonde hair, which she debuted on her birthday\nThe couple get their hands plenty dirty as they tend to sheep, goats, cows, donkeys and their beloved dog Winnie.\n'If you're not picking up horse s**t or washing a cow with your bare hands, then that life is not made for you. At all,' Brown shared with the magazine.\n'I'm doing it because I love it. There are maybe some trad wives out there doing it because it seems wholesome, but it is not.'\nShe loves animals so much she has been taking veterinary classes to help her four-legged friends out.\n'I'm able to treat wounds, take their pulse, moderate blood pressure, things like that. I do all their medical records myself,' she revealed.\n'Now I just have to do my externship, which is like sitting in on surgeries and things like that. Adoption campaigns [on social media] are wonderful temporarily, but you really have to get in there and do the work to make a difference.'\nIn the same interview, Brown shared her thoughts about Stranger Things â the show that made her a household name at 11-years-old â coming to and end after nearly a decade on the air.\n'It wasn't hitting me this entire timeâuntil yesterday,' said Brown. 'I was on set, and I was like, \"Well, I have one more day left.\" And I started crying.\n\nJake paid tribute to Millie on her birthday by sharing a sweet post to his own Instagram\n\nWhile Brown has been enjoying the 'trad life,' she told Vanity Fair earlier this month that it is not all tulips and sunshine\n\n'I don't actually like to cry at work. I'm a really emotional person, but I try to stay super strong.\n'It made me feel so uncomfortable. Jake was like, \"It's good, you have to get it out!\" and I just started welling up.' \nShe also told the outlet how she got into character as Eleven in Stranger Things.\n'I implemented what I was learning as a child, or what I was going through, into her,' she noted.\n'Elevenâs identity was a huge thing that we were kind of fighting with. Is she going to dress as a girl? Or is she gonna dress in the shirts of her adoptive father, Hopper? Or is she gonna be what her friends are helping her to be?\n'At that time in my life, I didnât know what I wanted to look like, if I preferred more feminine looks, more masculine looks, more androgynous, more grunge. So I implemented that confusion.'\nMillie Bobby BrownStranger ThingsJake Bongiovi\n\nShare or comment on this article: \nBikini-clad Millie Bobby Brown relaxes in a hammock while reading her own Vanity Fair cover in Turks and Caicos\n\nAdd comment\n\nEnter search term:\n\nJustin Bieber has heated confrontation with paparazzi while out with wife Hailey in Los Angeles\n\nHelen Flanagan, 34, cruelly mum-shamed after posing in busty black dress for night out with her boyfriend Robbie Talbot, 45, and his daughter Sophie, 14\n\nKim Kardashian wows in a busty bikini as she takes a splash for playful beach photo shoot in Los Angeles\n\nBikini-clad Millie Bobby Brown relaxes in a hammock while reading her own Vanity Fair cover in Turks and Caicos\n\nKATIE HIND: Impeccably dressed, musical children - the clues Bridget Jones film's pushy mum Perfect Nicolette is based on Myleene Klass\n\nLooking to boost your gut health?

And itâs possible only American intervention against Ukraine may reverse the Russiansâ faltering fortunes.\n\nFor an entire year since capturing the ruins of Avdiivka in eastern Ukraine, the Russian Center Operational Groupingâone of as many as six such groupings along the front line of Russiaâs wider war on Ukraineâhas been crawling toward the fortress city of Pokrovsk, 30 miles to the west.\n\nThe Center Operational Groupingâs forcesâon paper, at least 50,000 troops, many of them belonging to the 41st Combined Arms Armyâhave finally managed to reach Pokrovskâs outskirts. But it cost them potentially tens of thousands of soldiers and no fewer than 2,200 vehicles including that T-80 that burst into flames this weekend.\n\nAccording to Gen. Oleksandr Syrskyi, the Ukrainian commander in chief, around 15,000 Russians were âneutralizedâ around Pokrovsk in January alone.\n\nUkraineâs own losses in the area have been much lighter since its battered brigades finally retreated from Avdiivka last February. Independent analyst Naalsio has tallied 2,300 destroyed, damaged and captured Russian vehicles on the Pokrovsk axis, but just 700 destroyed, damaged and captured Ukrainian vehicles: a more than three-to-one ratio favoring the Ukrainians.\n\nThe staggering losses explain why the Russian may advance near Pokrovsk without actually capturing the city, which anchors a long chain of fortified cities stretching north toward Kharkiv. âThe enemyâs Center Operational Grouping on the Pokrovsk direction has made no advances on any of its fronts for three days and was forced to retreat from previously occupied positions in several areas,â the Ukrainian Center for Defense Strategies explained on Saturday.\n\nâThe 41st Combined Arms Army is unable to continue its offensive to the north and northwest to accomplish its primary objectiveâto envelop Pokrovsk from the west and cut off the road to Pavlohrad.â\n\nStymied, the Russians are pivoting to other objectives. âThe Russian command in the theater of war is focusing its main attention not on Pokrovsk but on the adjacent Novopavlivka and Toretsk directions,â CDS explained. And the command is willing to rob the 41st Combined Arms Army in the process, reportedly transferring its most powerful formationâthe 90th Tank Divisionâfrom the Pokrovsk sector south toward Andriivka, where a pair of Russian regiments have achieved âtactical successes,â according to CDS.\n\nItâs obviously not great news for Russiaâs war effort that one of its main offensives is losing momentum. Itâs better news for the Russians that their commanders are willing and able to adapt to changing conditions.\n\nAdaptation is the key for both sides as the war grinds on and the politics surrounding it shift. The United States, one of Ukraineâs staunchest allies under former President Joe Biden, is quickly realigning toward Russia under the chaotic leadership of President Donald Trump.\n\nAfter Ukrainian Pres. Volodymyr Zelensky rejected Trumpâs attempt to extort Ukraine for up to $500 billion in mineral wealth, Trumpâs administration threatened to cut off Ukraineâs access to Starlink satellite terminals, which many Ukrainian units use to communicate with each other and, equally critically, with their drones.\n\nStarlink is operated by SpaceX, itself largely owned by rightwing billionaire Elon Musk, who was a top Trump donor and is currently heading an extralegal âefficiencyâ organization that has haphazardly fired tens of thousands of federal employees and gutted entire agencies in Washington, D.C.\n\nWithout Starlink, Ukraine may struggle to deploy the very drones that blew up that T-80 and many hundreds of other Russian vehicles on the long bloody road to Pokrovsk. Itâs not for no reason that one of Ukraineâs top European allies quickly rose to Ukraineâs defense amid the threats over Starlink access.\n\nâWe pay and will continue to pay a subscription fee for satellite internet for Ukraine,â Polish Deputy Prime Minister Krzysztof Gawkowski wrote on X, a Musk-owned social media platform. âI cannot imagine that someone could decide to terminate a business contract for a commercial service to which Poland is a party,â Gawkowski added.\n\nUkrainian and allied officials would do well to expand their conception of whatâs possible in this dangerous new era of American-fueled geopolitical chaos.

Colorado Gov. Jared Polis, a Democrat and chairman of the National Governors Association, and Oklahoma Republican Gov. Kevin Stitt told Fox News Digital they want states to have a say in immigration enforcement and issuing work permits. \"We want to make sure we're at the table in that with regard to immigration,\" Polis told Fox News Digital. DEMS SAY THEY'RE AGAINST GOVERNMENT WASTE, BUT THEY HATE DOGE MORE He said the idea that the states should have a seat at the table regarding immigration decisions \"has a lot of support (among) both Democratic and Republican governors.\" Polis said states know what their labor needs are and could grant work permits after careful vetting. \"Let us be able to grant those based on free background checks â¦ and that'll help our economic growth,\" Polis said. Polis, whose state has been ground zero for criminal activity and violence by the migrant gang Tren de Aragua, said \"varying degrees of cooperation\" between state and federal authorities are necessary. Colorado has several sanctuary-style laws limiting law enforcement cooperation with federal authorities, but Polis insisted its relationship with federal law enforcement agencies is strong. COLORADO CITY HELPS DOZENS OF FAMILIES RELOCATE AFTER TREN DE ARAGUA APARTMENT INFESTATION Stitt said he would encourage Trump to consider giving states the ability to grant workforce visas. \"I've been an advocate for workforce visas at the state level,\" Stitt said. \"Matching employers with employees is something that governors should be able to do, whether it's in the construction industry, the agricultural industry, engineering, aviation, whatever.\" OKLAHOMA SUPERINTENDENT WHO BRAWLED WITH CNN OVER ICE ENTERING SCHOOLS DOUBLES DOWN: 'DEPORTED TOGETHER' He joked that the U.S. is \"like [a team in] the NFL with the No. 1 draft pick.\" \"We should be able to choose the very best and brightest to our country. But we're just being silly how we do it right now. Let's close the border. Let's make sure we have the very best and brightest that come into our country,\" Stitt said. Stitt also touted his stateâs Operation Guardian, which he launched earlier this month to empower state and local law enforcement to better work with the Trump administration and ICE to deport criminal illegal aliens. \"I put my commissioner of public safety in charge to say, âHow many people do we currently have in prison in the state of Oklahoma who are here illegally that have committed crimes? And then how can we work with the Trump administration to get them out of our state, out of our country and off of the taxpayer rolls in Oklahoma? So, I think that's probably the first step,\" Stitt said.

He insisted of Republicans, âI donât think weâve been at this level, maybe ever.â\n\nâNobodyâs ever seen anything like this, and nobodyâs ever seen four weeks like we had,â Trump said, likening his new administrationâs opening month to being on a roll through the first four holes of a round of golf, which he said gave him confidence for the fifth.\n\nTrump has empowered Elon Musk to help carry out the firings, and the billionaire vowed Saturday more may be coming.\n\nâConsistent with President @realDonaldTrumpâs instructions, all federal employees will shortly receive an email requesting to understand what they got done last week,â Musk posted on X, which he owns. âFailure to respond will be taken as a resignation.â\n\nConsistent with President @realDonaldTrumpâs instructions, all federal employees will shortly receive an email requesting to understand what they got done last week.Failure to respond will be taken as a resignation.â Elon Musk (@elonmusk) February 22, 2025\n\nOfficials received an email with the subject line âWhat did you do last week?â and a message reading âPlease reply to this email with approx. 5 bullets of what you accomplished last week and cc your manager.

Deadline is this Monday at 11:59pmEST.â \n\nTrump also repeatedly said Saturday that heâd carry out harder-line immigration policies. But those efforts have largely been overshadowed by his administrationâs mass federal firings. He announced that one agency that had been significantly reduced, the U.S. Agency for International Development, would have its Washington office taken over by Customs and Border Protection officials.\n\nâThe agencyâs name has been removed from its former building,â he said.\n\nThe president also repeated his previous promises that his administration will scrutinize the countryâs gold depository at Fort Knox.\n\nâWould anybody like to join us,â he said to cheers from the crowd. âWe want to see if the gold is still there.â\n\nBut Trump also devoted large chunks of his address reliving last yearâs presidential race, jeering at former President Joe Biden and mispronouncing the first name of former Vice President Kamala Harris â his Election Day opponent â gleefully proclaiming, âI havenât said that name in a while.â\n\nHe even mentioned Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., who ran for president in 2020.\n\nThe president said immigration and border policy under Biden made him angry. âI couldnât stand it,â Trump said, before cautioning himself, âDonald, donât get angry.â He went on to use an expletive to describe how he thinks of Bidenâs handling of border security, despite noting that evangelical conservatives have urged him not to use foul language.\n\nTrump had kinder words for Chinese President Xi Jinping, saying âI happen to likeâ him, while adding, âweâve been treated very unfairly by China and many other countries.â\n\nOn the sidelines of the conference, Trump met with conservative Polish President Andrzej Duda amid rising tensions in Europe over Russiaâs war in Ukraine. After he took the stage, Trump saluted Duda and Argentine President Javier Milei, who himself separately addressed the conference.\n\nTrump called Duda âa fantastic man and a great friend of mineâ and said âyou must be doing something right, hanging out with Trump.â He noted that Milei was âa MAGA guy, too, Make Argentina Great Again.â\n\nDuda is a populist who has enjoyed a close relationship with Trump in years past. Poland is a longtime ally of Ukraine. Trump upended recent U.S. policy by dispatching top foreign policy advisers to Saudi Arabia for direct talks with Russian officials that were aimed at ending fighting in Ukraine.\n\nThose meetings did not include Ukrainian or European officials, which has alarmed U.S. allies. After his face-to-face with Duda, Trump is meeting on Monday at the White House with French President Emmanuel Macron and Thursday with British Prime Minister Keir Starmer.\n\nTrump also has begun a public back and forth with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, whom the U.S. president called a âdictatorâ while falsely suggesting that Ukraine started the war â though on Friday he acknowledged that Russia attacked its neighbor.\n\nTrump said during his speech, âIâm dealing with President Zelenskyy. Iâm dealing with President Putinâ and added of fighting in Ukraine, âIt affects Europe. It doesnât really affect us.â\n\nZelenskyy has said Trump is living in a Russian-made âdisinformation space.â\n\nFor much of the time since Russia invaded in February 2022, the United States, under Biden, pledged that Ukraine would play in any major effort to end the fighting, vowing ânothing about Ukraine without Ukraine.â Trumpâs administration has dispensed with that notion, as the Republican president has accelerated his push to find an endgame to the war.\n\nâI think weâre pretty close to a deal, and we better be close to a deal,â Trump said Saturday of ending the war in Ukraine.\n\nLater, the president and first lady Melania Trump were hosting an evening reception and dinner at the White House for the National Governors Association, which was holding their own weekend meetings in Washington.\n\nWeissert reported from Washington.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nFederal employees must report their weekly &#8216;accomplishments&#8217; or resign, Musk says.

Of course, that might be worse. â¦ Forty million to improve the social and economic inclusion of sedentary migrants. \"Forty-two million for social and behavior change in Uganda. Ten million for Mozambique medical male circumcisions. Why are we going to Mozambique to do circumcisions?\" Trump asked, before continuing to rattle off a handful of other pricey initiatives funded by taxpayers uncovered by DOGE. 'SAVED THE COUNTRY': CPAC ATTENDEES SEE SILVER LINING AFTER ELON MUSK'S DOGE SPEECH CPAC is an annual conference of conservative lawmakers, leaders and voters, which kicked off on Wednesday and wraps up Saturday after Trump's speech. KAROLINE LEAVITT OFFERS WORDS OF WISDOM TO YOUNG WOMEN AT CPAC: 'JUST BELIEVE IN YOURSELF' Earlier in the day, Trump sent a message on his Truth Social platform calling on Musk to \"get more aggressive\" with his DOGE work. \"Will do, Mr. President!\" Musk responded just a few hours ahead of Trump's CPAC speech. Musk later added on X, \"Consistent with President @realDonaldTrumpâs instructions, all federal employees will shortly receive an email requesting to understand what they got done last week. Failure to respond will be taken as a resignation.\" \"We have a very corrupt group of people in this country, and we're finding them out,\" Trump said during his speech. \"We're removing all of the unnecessary, incompetent and corrupt bureaucrats from the federal workforce.\" VP JD VANCE SPEAKS ON 'FUNDAMENTAL GOAL' OF TRUMP ADMINISTRATION AT CPAC ADDRESS Trump said he and Musk will head to Fort Knox in Kentucky to ensure the United States Bullion Depository still houses a reported $425 billion in government gold. The Trump administration and Republican allies have called for more transparency about the vault. President Franklin D. Roosevelt visited the vault in 1943, which was followed by Treasury Secretary William Simon opening the vault to journalists and lawmakers in 1974 and again during the first Trump administration when Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin and lawmakers, including Republican Sen. Mitch McConnell, inspected the vault. \"We are also going to Fort Knox. I'm going to go with Elon. And would anybody like to join us? Because we want to see if the gold is still there. We want to see,\" Trump said. \"Wouldn't that be terrible? We open [it] up, and this Fort Knox has got nothing. It's just solid granite that's five feet thick. The front door, you need six musclemen to open it up. I don't even think they have windows. Wouldn't that be terrible if we opened it up and there was no gold there? So, we're going to open those doors, we're going to take a look. And if there's 27 tons of gold, we'll be very happy,\" he added. \"I don't know how the hell we'll measure it, but that's OK.\" Trump ended his first full month back in the White House this week, which has included a breakneck pace of executive orders and actions. He took a victory lap for his whirlwind first month, touting in his speech the administration's work to end the \"weaponization\" of the government under the former Biden administration, his plan to soon impose reciprocal tariffs on foreign trading partners and celebrating the deportation of illegal immigrants from communities across the nation. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP \"We're liberating communities like Aurora, Colorado, and Springfield, Ohio, that have been occupied by illegal alien criminals from all over the world,\" Trump said. \"We're rescuing the Americans whose jobs have been stolen, whose wages have been robbed and whose way of life has been absolutely destroyed. And, under the Trump administration, our country will not be turned into a dumping ground.\"","summary":"President Donald Trump lauded Elon Musk and DOGE for their work uncovering government overspending in his speech before the Conservative Political Action Conference.","url":"https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-runs-down-flagrant-scams-uncovered-doge-sets-sights-opening-fort-knox-vault-cpa","image":"https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2025/02/931/523/u.s.-president-donald-trump-attends-the-conservative-political-action-conference-2.jpg?ve=1&tl=1","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-02-22 22:37:13","author":"Emma Colton","authors":["Emma Colton"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.271},{"id":293335730,"title":"Ariana Grande's friends say her 'non-stop' schedule has taken a toll on her physically amid health concerns","text":"Black Friday\n\nKim Kardashian\n\nVictoria Beckham\n\nHarry Styles\n\nAmanda Holden\n\nBritain's Got Talent\n\nPrivacy Policy\n\nSaturday, Feb 22nd 2025\n\n5-Day Forecast\n\nAdvertisement\n\nElon Musk's shocking messages to 'baby mama' Ashley St. Clair revealed\n\nMoment Gen Z yobs jump on police car roof while crowds chant 'f*** the feds' as chaos erupts at trainers launch in busy London shopping street\n\nPope Francis is in a 'critical condition' and has received blood transfusions after suffering asthmatic respiratory crisis, Vatican says\n\nCowardice and treachery over Ukraine as political insiders tell me what's REALLY going on, the two people who've shown surprising strength... and the new plan for defence: DAN HODGES\n\nHow I lost 3 STONE in 3 WEEKS.

Itâs superhuman,' the insider declared. \n'Itâs just the non-stop running on that kind of schedule and that kind of level. It definitely takes a toll on your health â itâs that much harder to take care of yourself â mentally as well as physically,' they added.\nThat kind of tough schedule means, 'You always have to be on. You have to really be measured about what you say, you always have to be thinking, \"If I say this, is it going to come out like this?\" Your brain is nonstop working.'\nAnother source, who allegedly worked for Grande in the past, noted the singer has struggled with anxiety for years, but managed to push through. \n'I never got a sense from her that she didn't like who she was or how she looked,' the former employee said. \nAfter Grande dyed her hair a light blonde for her role as Glinda in 2023, fans began to voice their concerns about her appearance, and what appeared to be weight loss from her petite frame.\n\nMany noticed that her sternum was clearly visible thanks to Louis Vuitton gown's plunging neckline.

Iâm sure itâs mostly great. Like everything it comes with its cons. You learn resilience at a very young age working on Broadway. Thereâs too much money and not a lot of time involved,' he explained. \nLondonAriana GrandeBAFTAs\n\nShare or comment on this article: \nAriana Grande's friends say her 'non-stop' schedule has taken a toll on her physically amid health concerns\n\nAdd comment\n\nEnter search term:\n\nJustin Bieber has heated confrontation with paparazzi while out with wife Hailey in Los Angeles\n\nHelen Flanagan, 34, cruelly mum-shamed after posing in busty black dress for night out with her boyfriend Robbie Talbot, 45, and his daughter Sophie, 14\n\nKim Kardashian wows in a busty bikini as she takes a splash for playful beach photo shoot in Los Angeles\n\nKatie Price's daughter Princess Andre shows off her dramatic hair transformation in new video\n\nGino D'Acampo 'drew explicit image of female TV producer during live filming' in 'unsettling' encounter, ITV probe into TV chef is told\n\nLooking to boost your gut health?

Jaishankar has raised concerns over allegations that USAID provided $21 million for \"voter turnout in India.\" He emphasized that if these claims are true, the country must know who was involved.\nSpeaking at the Delhi University Literature Festival, Jaishankar responded to statements made by former US President Donald Trump. \"Some information has been put out there by the Trump administration, and obviously, that is concerningâ¦ Weâre looking into it, and the facts will come out. USAID was allowed here in good faith, but now there are suggestions from America about bad-faith activities. Thatâs worrisome,â he said.\nUSAIDâs Role Under Scrutiny\nThe allegations suggest that USAID, an American agency responsible for international development, may have been involved in influencing voter turnout in India. The controversy has sparked debate, with officials and experts calling for an investigation into the matter. Economist Sanjiv Sanyal, a member of the Prime Ministerâs Economic Advisory Council, has called the controversy âthe biggest scam in human history.â\nModi-Trump Relationship and Shared Nationalism\nDuring his speech, Jaishankar also reflected on Prime Minister Narendra Modiâs relationship with Donald Trump. He described their interaction as one marked by \"strong chemistry and mutual respect.\" He pointed out that both leaders, as nationalists, shared a deep understanding of each other's commitment to their countries.\nâPM Modi is a strong nationalist, and he radiates that. Trump, as an American nationalist, respects that. Modi is in it for India, and Trump is in it for America,â Jaishankar said.\nDiplomacy and the Ramayana Analogy\nJaishankar compared Indiaâs diplomatic strategies to Lord Hanumanâs mission in Lanka, as described in the epic Ramayana. He explained how Hanuman was sent to a hostile territory to assess the situation, boost Ma Sitaâs morale, and understand the power dynamics.\nâLord Hanuman even identified Vibhishana as an ally and ultimately set Lanka on fire,â Jaishankar said, adding with a smile, âImagine a diplomat going somewhere and setting a placeânot metaphorically, but literallyâon fire.â\nWhen asked if he had ever attempted something similar, he humorously responded, âDo not tempt me.â\nIndiaâs Expanding Diplomatic Circle\nJaishankar emphasized that diplomacy is about building alliances, even with countries that do not always align with Indiaâs stance.\nâWhat are we trying to do today as Bharat? We are expanding our circle of friends and bringing together nations that may not always be on the same page to achieve common goals,â he said.\nALSO READ: Double Engine Government In Delhi: What It Means For The National Capital?","summary":"External Affairs Minister S.
