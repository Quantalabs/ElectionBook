{"offset":0,"number":50,"available":13690,"news":[{"id":280053212,"title":"Indiana Is Latest State to Try to Criminalize Abortion Pills","text":"As of this week, Indiana has become the latest state to try to criminalize possession of abortion pills, as part of an appallingly comprehensive new anti-abortion bill. The bill, filed by state Sen. Mike Young (R), would make it a misdemeanor to prescribe or possess medication abortion, though it carves out an exception for pregnant people who already have the pills.\n\nIn 2024, Louisiana became the first state in the nation to enact such a law and, in November, Texas Republicans pre-filed an identical bill. Both pieces of legislation nonsensically classify abortion pills as dangerous, “Schedule IV” drugs, eerily wielding the tactics of the War on Drugs. In Louisiana, now that mifepristone pills aren’t readily available to them, hospitals are scrambling to figure out how to save lives if patients experience postpartum hemorrhaging.\n\nNow, Indiana is following suit. While all three bills offer a stated exception for someone imminently about to take the pills, this policy remains incredibly dangerous. After Donald Trump won reelection, consequently threatening access to abortion pills in all states, organizations like Plan C Pills called on pregnant-capable people to buy medication abortion in advance while you can, whether you’re pregnant or not. These laws could criminalize this.\n\nIndiana’s same, wide-reaching bill, SB 171, would also make it illegal for organizations like abortion funds to pay for or subsidize the costs of medication abortion, and would give Indiana’s attorney jurisdiction over criminal cases involving medication abortion should local prosecutors decline to prosecute these cases. And, in an especially cruel feature of SB 171, it would further narrow the rape exception attached to the state’s existing abortion ban, requiring that if a survivor wants an abortion, they have to provide their doctor with an affidavit and potentially face perjury penalties for supposed false reports. \n\nJust as SB 171 follows a growing trend of states trying to criminalize the mere possession of abortion pills, it also follows a trend of anti-abortion state legislatures either outright rejecting rape exceptions to abortion bans or establishing invasive, retraumatizing, or downright impossible barriers to these exceptions. Dr. Caitlin Bernard, an Indiana OBGYN who became the target of terrifying right-wing smear campaigns when she offered abortion care to a 10-year-old Ohio rape victim in 2022, told the Indiana Capital Chronicle that the bill will retraumatize victims who “are more likely to not seek care if they know they will be forced to go through this agonizing process.” \n\nSB 171 also comes as more and more anti-abortion lawmakers are targeting the mere act of helping someone access abortion, whether through legal threats or lawsuits against abortion funds, or bills to criminalize helping someone travel across state lines for care. The goal is transparently to trap as many people as possible under abortion bans.\n\nThe Chronicle reports that, terrifying as SB 171 is, it faces an “uncertain” future, since Sen. Young “has clashed with caucus leadership over Indiana’s abortion ban” before. Further, Haley Bougher, Indiana State Director for Planned Parenthood Alliance Advocates, told the outlet the bill is legally dubious. “This legislation is riddled with constitutional challenges and legal enforceability, as it infringes on the right to travel and access legal care in other states,” Bougher said. “These measures are duplicative, wasteful and show just how far extremists will go.” So, there’s that!","url":"https://www.jezebel.com/indiana-is-latest-to-try-to-criminalize-abortion-pills-also-targets-rape-exception-abortion-funds","image":"https://img.pastemagazine.com/wp-content/juploads/2024/12/Untitled-design-2024-12-11T113456.844.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-01-12 16:49:34","author":"Kylie Cheung","authors":["Kylie Cheung"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.475},{"id":280052906,"title":"US official says talks on hostage deal 'very close'","text":"US President Joe Biden will likely talk with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu soon, his national security adviser says, as US officials race to reach a Gaza Strip hostage and ceasefire deal before Biden leaves office.\n\nJake Sullivan told CNN that the parties were \"very, very close\" to reaching a deal to halt the fighting in the enclave and free the remaining 98 hostages held there but still had to get it across the finish line.\n\nBiden was getting daily updates on the talks in Doha, where Israeli and Palestinian officials have said since Thursday that some progress has been made in the indirect talks between Israel and militant group Hamas, Sullivan said.\n\n\"We are still determined to use every day we have in office to get this done,\" he said, adding that Biden \"is likely, in the near term, to engage with Prime Minister Netanyahu, and we are not, by any stretch of imagination, setting this aside\".\n\nHe said there was still a chance to reach an agreement before Biden leaves office on January 20 but that it was also possible \"Hamas, in particular, remains intransigent\".\n\nNetanyahu's office said on Saturday that an Israeli delegation including Mossad Head David Barnea, the head of the Shin Bet domestic security service Ronen Bar and the military's head of the hostage brief Nitzan Alon had arrived in Qatar for talks.\n\nIt is unclear how they will bridge one of the biggest gaps that has persisted throughout previous rounds of talks: Hamas demands an end to the war while Israel says it will not end the war as long as Hamas rules the Gaza Strip and poses a threat to Israelis.\n\nIsrael launched its assault in the Gaza Strip after Hamas fighters stormed across its borders in October 2023, killing 1200 people and taking more than 250 hostages, according to Israeli tallies.\n\nSince then, more than 46,000 people have been killed in the Gaza Strip, according to Palestinian health officials, with much of the enclave laid to waste and gripped by a humanitarian crisis and most of its population displaced.\n\nVice president-elect JD Vance told Fox News in an interview taped on Saturday that he expects a deal for the release of US hostages in the Middle East to be announced in the final days of the Biden administration, maybe in the last day or two.\n\nUS president-elect Donald Trump has strongly backed Netanyahu's goal of destroying Hamas.\n\nHe has promised to bring peace to the Middle East but has not said how he would accomplish that.","summary":"Israel and Hamas are \"very, very close\" to reaching a deal to halt the fighting in the Gaza Strip and release hostages, US adviser Jake Sullivan says.","url":"https://thewest.com.au/news/conflict/us-official-says-talks-on-hostage-deal-very-close-c-17366917","image":"https://images.thewest.com.au/publication/C-17366917/b80f5a28265f60ef3844aec9ef629c805fa2edb5-16x9-x0y0w1280h720.jpg?imwidth=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-01-12 16:45:36","author":"Staff Writers","authors":["Staff Writers"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"au","sentiment":-0.315},{"id":280052946,"title":"Europe is divided over Trump's call for NATO members to boost defense spending to 5% of GDP","text":"Donald Trump's suggestion that NATO members should allocate 5% of their GDP on defense has prompted mixed reactions in Europe.The president-elect floated the figure — which is more than double the current target — at a press conference on Tuesday.\"I think NATO should have 5%,\" he said. \"They can all afford it, but they should be at 5%, not 2%.\"Currently, no alliance member spends 5% of GDP on defense.NATO estimates showed Poland was set to lead the alliance in defense spending as a percentage of GDP in 2024, with Warsaw investing more than 4% of its economic output on defense. Estonia and the US followed, spending 3.43% and 3.38% respectively.Trump's remarks sparked dismay among some European officials.Ralf Stegner, a member of Germany's Social Democratic Party, wrote in a Facebook post that Trump's comments were \"delusional and truly insane.\"\"Where are the resources supposed to come from to solve the real-world problems?\" he said. \"We have too much poverty, environmental destruction, civil wars, migration, and too few resources to combat this more actively.\"Speaking to reporters on Wednesday, Italian Defense Minister Guido Crosetto cast doubt on the feasibility of Trump's proposal: \"I don't think it will be five, which at this time would be impossible for almost all nations in the world,\" he said, per Italian news agency Ansa.But Crosetto added that he did expect the target to be raised above 2%.Italy was on track to spend 1.49% of GDP on defense in 2024, while Germany — which is gearing up for a snap federal election in February — was set for 2.12%.For nations closer to Russia and its ongoing invasion of Ukraine, increasing defense expenditure may not seem like such a bad idea, however.Warsaw has already signaled its support for Trump's demand, with the Polish defense minister telling the Financial Times that Poland \"can be the transatlantic link between this challenge set by President Trump and its implementation in Europe.\"In Estonia, the shared border with Russia has led to heightened tensions and an increasing focus on defense.Reacting to Trump's comments, Estonian Prime Minister Kristen Michal told Politico that it was the \"message that Estonia has been advocating for years.\"\"This is a clear signal to Putin that he should not dare to test NATO's nerves and that we are prepared for it,\" he said.At a Northern Group partners' meeting last year, Estonia's defense minister urged allies to increase spending to 2.5% to counter the threat of Russian aggression.Sweden, which has also increased defense spending since Russia's invasion of Ukraine in 2022, also backed the call for increased spending.\"There is a broad consensus in Sweden that we need to invest more in our defense,\" the country's foreign minister, Maria Malmer Stenergard, said, per Politico. \"US governments have long urged European countries to increase their defense spending and to bear more of their own defense costs. We share this view.\"Lithuania has also prioritized defense spending amid the growing Russian threat. Its president, Gitanas Nausėda, recently called on European countries to \"show more support for the US global agenda\" by increasing their share of the defense burden.For his part, NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte has said Europe knows it must spend more on defense.During a trip to Warsaw in November, Rutte praised Poland for its defense spending efforts, saying it sent \"a clear message not only to our adversaries but also to the United States. That Europe understands it must do more to ensure our shared security. And that starts with spending more and also fielding more capabilities.\"Nevertheless, analysts say Trump's 5% figure is unrealistic.\"Many European NATO countries are funding higher military spending through debt, cuts in other expenditure areas, and proposals to increase taxes,\" Nan Tian, a senior researcher and program director at the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute's Military Expenditure and Arms Production Programme, told Business Insider. \"These existing increases would push military spending to a level about half of what Trump proposed of 5% of GDP, thus I don't think this is a realistic target.\"\"5% of GDP level would be higher than the same countries spent at the height of the Cold War,\" Tian added.Ruther Deyermond, a senior lecturer at King's College London's Department of War Studies, went further, calling Trump's suggestion a \"coercive tactic.\"\"It looks as if the point of the 5% demand is for it to be unachievable - the intention seems to be that states will fail,\" Deyermond wrote on X. \"It's a coercive tactic (pay up or your country gets it) that also signals that NATO is no longer a meaningful alliance.\"","summary":"Ralf Stegner, a member of Germany's Social Democratic Party, called Trump's comments \"delusional and truly insane.\" Poland has backed Trump's demand.","url":"https://www.businessinsider.com/europe-divided-trump-call-boost-defense-spending-gdp-russia-ukraine-2025-1","image":"https://i.insider.com/677fd9c5f83fcec7e5b52f92?width=1200&format=jpeg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-01-12 16:39:37","author":"Nathan Rennolds,Rebecca Rommen","authors":["Nathan Rennolds","Rebecca Rommen"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.35},{"id":280051814,"title":"Jamie Dimon on Why Donald Trump Won: 'Legitimate Issues'","text":"JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon has attributed President-elect Donald Trump's 2024 victory to his focus on \"legitimate issues\" that resonate with American voters.In an interview with CBS News that aired Sunday morning, Dimon discussed economic inequality, inflation and job insecurity—noting that Trump's messaging aligned with voter concerns.Newsweek has reached out to the Trump transition team via email for comment.Why It MattersTrump's win has been seen as marking a significant shift in American politics, as he became the first Republican president in 20 years to win the popular vote. The 2024 election saw a major realignment of voter demographics, with working-class and minority communities showing increased support for Trump. Analysts point to economic dissatisfaction, skepticism toward establishment politics, and shifting party coalitions as key reasons for his victory.Dimon's comments highlight the extent to which economic concerns played a role. Inflation, rising interest rates, and the cost-of-living were top priorities for voters. Pre-election polling consistently showed that Americans viewed the economy as their biggest concern, and Trump held an advantage among those who prioritized economic issues.What to KnowDimon emphasized that voters were deeply affected by economic concerns and that Trump successfully spoke to those issues.\"People feel left behind,\" Dimon told CBS News. \"They look at their wages, they look at inflation, and they don't feel better off. Trump, rightly or wrongly, spoke to that frustration.\"He also pointed to dissatisfaction with government policies. \"If you ask people, 'Are you better off than four years ago?' a lot of them say 'no,'\" he said. \"We need policies that support job growth, improve wages, and address the cost-of-living—those are things that matter most to people.\"Dimon further discussed tax policy and deregulation, saying, \"Businesses want certainty. If Trump can provide that, you'll see more investment and job creation.\" He added that policies addressing energy independence and reshoring manufacturing jobs were major factors in Trump's appeal to voters.The CEO, who is estimated to be worth $2.5 billion by Forbes, said that he understands voters negative views of the country's situation.\"I do understand it, 'cause I think there are a lot of legitimate concerns that Americans have. For example, ineffective government, they're angry about it. They're angry about immigration. There're people with legitimate issues,\" he said.Among the biggest policy ideas floated by Trump is the extension of the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA), which is currently due to expire in 2025. When it was first enacted under his stewardship in 2017, it created a single flat corporate tax rate of 21 percent, down from 35 percent under his predecessor Barack Obama. In an interview with Bloomberg, Trump said he wanted to cut the corporation tax rate further to 20 percent but also floated lowering it to 15 percent. \"I liked 20 percent better,\" he said. \"I like 15 percent yet better, but I think that would be, you know, that'd be hard.\"Trump has also said he wishes to impose a universal baseline tariff on all U.S. imports as well as lifting current tariffs on China to at least 60 percent. According to CNBC, Trump floated the idea of eliminating income taxes and replacing the revenue with higher tariffs in a private meeting with GOP lawmakers last year. Analysts have raised concerns about this idea, suggesting it would raise prices for Americans and not work the way Trump has said.What People Are SayingPresident-elect Donald Trump wrote on Truth Social earlier this month: \"We must Secure our Border, Unleash American Energy, and Renew the Trump Tax Cuts, which were the largest in History, but we will make it even better - NO TAX ON TIPS. IT WILL ALL BE MADE UP WITH TARIFFS, AND MUCH MORE, FROM COUNTRIES THAT HAVE TAKEN ADVANTAGE OF THE U.S. FOR YEARS. Republicans must unite, and quickly deliver these Historic Victories for the American People.\"Johns Hopkins historian Leah Wright Rigueur told Johns Hopkins University Hub on November 7: \"The increasing polarization over the last four years, combined with an incumbent president stepping down mid-campaign, made this an uphill battle for Democrats.\"Wayne Steger, a political scientist at DePaul University, told PBS NewsHour on November 24 about the 2024 election results: \"Inflation, immigration, and backlash against Democrats on cultural issues created a Republican-leaning environment.\"Democratic National Committee (DNC) spokesperson Aida Ross said in a Friday press release: \"As Donald Trump pledges to enact a disastrous and expensive tax plan, new polling shows that Americans fear Trump's agenda will hurt working families by raising costs and putting Social Security and Medicare at risk.\"What Happens NextWith Trump set to return to the White House, his administration's policies on taxes, trade, immigration and regulations will be closely watched. His campaign promises included cutting interest rates, deregulating industries, and taking a harder stance on immigration. Analysts say that governing may prove more challenging than campaigning.As Trump prepares for his second term, voters will be watching to see whether he delivers on the economic promises that propelled him back into office. For now, figures like Dimon suggest that Trump's victory was less about rhetoric and more about real concerns facing the American people.","summary":"\"People feel left behind,\" the JPMorgan Chase CEO said.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/jamie-dimon-why-donald-trump-won-legitimate-issues-2013655","image":"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2562694/jamie-dimon-trump.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-01-12 16:36:17","author":"Jason Lemon","authors":["Jason Lemon"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.182},{"id":280052396,"title":"Dominic Cummings and Elon Musk in alleged WhatsApp plot to derail UK politics","text":"Dominic Cummings is helping Elon Musk in his aggressive attacks on Keir Starmer and the Labour government, it has been claimed.\n\nThe pair, who are both fiercely anti-establishment, are said to be scheming on WhatsApp to derail politics in the UK, according to unconfirmed reports in the Mail on Sunday.

With the support of a Republican majority in the Senate, this historic legislation opened ANWR to drilling for the first time.\n\nThe area in the coastal plain that is up for lease is estimated to contain 11.8 billion barrels of recoverable oil. \n\nIn 1960, the Eisenhower Administration established ANWR, affectionately dubbed “America’s Serengeti,’ as an area of biological significance. \n\n“That was a major victory for those who wanted to keep it out of development,” said Dr. Scott L. Montgomery, lecturer at the School of International Studies at the University of Washington.\n\nANWR is known worldwide for its unique biodiversity as a home to charismatic species like polar bears, wolves, and the caribou that are sacred to the Gwich’in, a Northwestern Alaska tribe.\n\n“It is a migration pathway and a habitation for many large and also a migratory species,” said Montgomery.\n\nOil and gas operations elicit mixed responses from Alaskan Natives, however. While some worry that drilling activity will hurt vulnerable wildlife and subsistence living, others say the oil and gas industry funds important infrastructure for their communities.\n\nOil and Gas Operations Fund Infrastructure in Rural Alaska\n\n“Our budget every single year is absolutely tied to the kinds of revenue that we get from the price of oil, ” said Dr. A.L. Lovecraft, professor of Political Science and director of the Center for Arctic Policy Studies at the University of Alaska Fairbanks.\n\nNinety-five percent of the North Slope Borough’s budget comes from taxation on development infrastructure on the oil and gas industry.\n\nAccording to a 2024 Bureau of Land Management (BLM) report, oil and gas operations contributed to almost $1.4 billion in economic output on Alaska’s BLM-managed lands, accounting for 81% of total economic output generated on federal land. Meanwhile, recreation on BLM land accounted for about 3% of total economic output, or $48.1 million.\n\nIn the North Slope Borough, oil and gas extraction made up 48% of all employment in 2023, compared to about 1.4% of employment in the rest of non-metro counties in the United States, according to an analysis of Bureau of Labor Statistics data by Headwaters Economics, a nonprofit research organization.\n\nBut most of those jobs are filled by transient workers, not natives of the North Slope. The majority of full-time North Slope residents work for the local government.\n\nHowever, Alaska’s oil and gas industry provides opportunities beyond direct employment.\n\nLovecraft mentioned hiring a student research assistant through an internship funded by the Arctic Slope Regional Corporation (ASRC), one of twelve regional corporations created under the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act of 1971.\n\nUnlike reservations in the lower 48, Alaskan Natives have regional corporations like the ASRC. These corporations operate like traditional businesses, benefiting their shareholders—who are Alaskan Native peoples—by generating revenue from industries such as oil and gas. Currently, the ASRC has over 13,000 shareholders who receive dividends. Since its establishment in 1972, the ASRC has distributed more than $1 billion in dividends.\n\nMany leaders of the Iñupiat, an indigenous people native to Alaska’s North Slope Borough, say that oil and gas operations can be good for native communities if conducted responsibly.\n\n“Before oil and gas, you couldn't graduate high school and stay in the North Slope,” said Nagruk Harcharek, president of the Voice of the Arctic Iñupiat, a nonprofit organization that advocates for Alaska’s Iñupiat people. “Now there's K-12 schools in every North Slope village.\" \n\nHarcharek credited revenue from the oil and gas industry with funding the establishment of search and rescue teams and improving home heating in the region. But regardless of the oil and gas industry’s potential benefits to his community, he emphasized the importance of having a seat at the table where decisions about their land are made, rather than being sidelined by oil executives and presidential administrations.\n\n“We don’t want to hear about things through the news media,” said Harcharek. He said they want to be included before decisions are announced publicly. \n\nHarcharek said that the controversial Willow Project, a ConocoPhillips drilling project in the North Slope, west of ANWR, was a good example of what it looks like to engage Alaskan Natives. He said they were consulted “early and often” in the decision-making process.\n\nThe Risks of Drilling in the Arctic\n\nDrilling in the Arctic raises significant environmental concerns, including the acceleration of climate change and potential disruption to vulnerable wildlife. It can also be costly due to short work seasons and limited existing infrastructure.\n\nAnd according to climate data from NOAA, temperature has increased more in Alaska’s North Slope Borough compared to any other region in the state since 1970. That, in turn, has destabilized ice, making snowmobile travel more hazardous. In a state twice the size of Texas with only 700,000 residents spread across approximately 200 communities, snowmobiles are often one of the few viable modes of transportation in remote areas.\n\nParts of the North Slope Borough are also important breeding and hunting grounds for caribou. And some Alaskan Natives worry about how devastating oil spills will disrupt migration patterns and harm traditional ways of life.\n\nOther Alaskans are concerned that climate change will melt ice and the permafrost, leading to hazardous hunting conditions as individuals risk falling through the ice and face challenges storing food in traditional underground ice cellars.\n\n“The indigenous population in these villages rely on subsistence practices,” said Lovecraft. “Both to be physically healthy, and of course to ensure that language and culture continue.\" \n\nHunting is more than just a hobby in many native villages with high poverty rates. Hunting is a method of survival, said Lovecraft. “[Drilling] also comes with all of this other baggage... Problems related to health, indoor health, indoor air quality, outdoor air quality.” \n\nThe air toxins released during oil and gas activity include chemicals like benzene and n-hexane, which are thought to cause cancer and cause other health conditions, according to the EPA. \n\nArctic Drilling is Costly\n\nBut the costs of oil and gas drilling in the Arctic are not solely environmental; they also include significant economic challenges.\n\nDespite Trump’s “Drill Baby, Drill” attitude, the success of Arctic drilling depends less on Republican policies and more on the global price of oil—a complex and fluctuating factor beyond the president-elect’s direct control.\n\nMany arctic oil exploration sites don’t have existing infrastructure like permanent roads or nearby oil and gas pipelines. Building out the necessary infrastructure can be cost prohibitive if the global price of oil isn’t high enough to make it worth the investment, according to Montgomery.\n\nMuch of this infrastructure can only be established in the winter, as ice roads are required to transport materials.\n\nA 2024 brief from the Alaska Wilderness League estimated that oil prices need to be between $63 and $84 per barrel to be worth the costly investment. But the latest data from the Energy Information Administration predicted that the price of oil per barrel will hover around $61 to $63 per barrel in 2025.\n\nThe Trump Administration’s first lease sale in 2021 didn’t attract much interest. Only 11 of the 22 tracts available received any bids. That sale took place during the pandemic, a period marked by historically low oil prices—approximately $56 per barrel, according to the Energy Information Administration.\n\nIn December 2024, the price was $61, still modest compared to the $172 per barrel at the twenty-year high in 2008.\n\nMontgomery said he thinks there will be small, if any, interest in the upcoming January 9th lease auction. “But I think there might be a few companies that would take the bait,” he said.\n\nAccording to Montgomery, some companies might sit on the lease until oil prices improve before they start drilling procedures.\n\nWith any bids that do take place on January 9th, Harcharek hopes that the Iñupiat will be heard and included. \"We get characterized as oil and gas advocates but that's not the truth,” he said. \n\nHarcharek said they want a slice of the pie when profits are being made on their land. It just so happens that right now, those profits are coming from the oil and gas industry.","url":"https://ictnews.org/news/americas-serengeti-oil-gas-and-the-fight-for-native-inclusion-in-alaskas-arctic-refuge","image":"https://ictnews.org/.image/ar_1.91%2Cc_fill%2Ccs_srgb%2Cfl_progressive%2Cg_faces:center%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MTc0NzcyNDc4MzQwNTA3NDA3/arctic-national-wildlife-refuge---alaska---us-fish-and-wildlife-service-public-domain.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-01-12 16:32:34","author":"The Daily Yonder","authors":["The Daily Yonder"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.024},{"id":280051246,"title":"Jimmy Carter honored with Washington funeral before burial in his Georgia hometown","text":"Bill BarrowAssociated Press\n\nJimmy Carter, who considered himself an outsider even as he sat in the Oval Office as the 39th U.S. president, was honored Thursday with the pageantry of a funeral at Washington National Cathedral before a second service and burial in his tiny Georgia hometown.\n\nThe first speaker was Joshua Carter, the former president's grandson, who recalled how Carter regularly taught Sunday school after leaving the White House.\n\n\"He built houses for people who needed homes,\" Joshua said. \"He eliminated diseases in forgotten places. He waged peace anywhere in the world, wherever he saw a chance. He loved people.\"\n\nJason Carter, another grandson, praised his grandfather and his wife Rosalynn, who died in 2023.\n\n\"They were small-town people who never forgot who they were and where they were from no matter what happened in their lives,\" said Jason, who chairs the Carter Center, a global humanitarian operation founded by the former president shortly after leaving office.\n\nPresident Joe Biden, who was the first sitting senator to endorse Carter's 1976 campaign, eulogized his fellow Democrat a little more than a week before he leaves office.\n\n\"Today many think he was from a bygone era, but in reality he saw well into the future,\" Biden said.\n\n\"I miss him,\" he added. \"But I take solace in knowing that he and his beloved Rosalynn are reunited once again.\"\n\nAll of Carter's living successors attended the Washington funeral, including President-elect Donald Trump, who paid his respects in the Capitol Rotunda on Wednesday. The rare gathering of commanders in chief offered an unusual moment of comity for the nation in a factionalized, hyper-partisan era, and they met privately before the service began.\n\nAs Trump went to his seat, he shook hands with Mike Pence in a rare interaction with his former vice president. The two men had a falling out over Pence's refusal to help Trump overturn his election defeat to Biden four years ago.\n\nTrump was seated next to former President Barack Obama and the two could be seen chatting for several minutes. Vice President Kamala Harris, who lost to Trump in November, entered afterwards but did not interact with him.\n\nCarter died died Dec. 29 at the age of 100, living so long that two of the eulogies were written by people who died before him — his vice president Walter Mondale and his White House predecessor Gerald Ford.\n\n\"By fate of a brief season, Jimmy Carter and I were rivals,\" said the eulogy from Ford, which was read by his son Steven. \"But for the many wonderful years that followed, friendship bonded us as no two presidents since John Adams and Thomas Jefferson.\"\n\nCarter defeated Ford in 1976 but the presidents and their wives became close friends, and Carter eulogized Ford at his own funeral.\n\nDays of formal ceremonies and remembrances from political leaders, business titans and rank-and-file citizens have honored Carter for decency and using a prodigious work ethic to do more than obtain political power.\n\nThe proceedings began Thursday morning as military service members carried Carter's flag-draped casket down the east steps of the U.S. Capitol, where the former president had laid in state, to be transported to the cathedral. There was also a 21-gun salute.\n\nAt the cathedral, the Armed Forces Chorus sang the hymn \"Be Still My Soul\" before Carter's casket was brought inside.\n\nMourners also heard from 92-year-old Andrew Young, a former Atlanta mayor, congressman and U.N. ambassador during the Carter administration. Carter outlived much of his Cabinet and inner circle, but remained especially close to Young — a friendship that brought together a white Georgian and Black Georgian who grew up in the era of Jim Crow segregation.\n\n\"Jimmy Carter was a blessing that helped create a great United States of America,\" Young said.\n\nThursday will conclude six days of national rites that began in Plains, Georgia, where Carter was born in 1924, lived most of his life and died after 22 months in hospice care. Ceremonies continued in Atlanta and Washington, where Carter, a former Naval officer, engineer and peanut farmer, has lain in state since Tuesday.\n\nLong lines of mourners waited several hours in frigid temperatures to file past his flag-draped casket in the rotunda, as tributes focused as much on Carter's humanitarian work after leaving the White House as what he did as president from 1977 to 1981.\n\nAfter the morning service in Washington, Carter's remains, his four children and extended family will return to Georgia on a Boeing 747 that serves as Air Force One when the sitting president is aboard.\n\nThe outspoken Baptist, who campaigned as a born-again Christian, will then be remembered in an afternoon funeral at Maranatha Baptist Church, the small edifice where he taught Sunday school for decades after leaving the White House and where his casket will sit beneath a wooden cross he fashioned in his own woodshop.\n\nFollowing a final ride through his hometown, past the old train depot that served as his 1976 presidential campaign headquarters, he will be buried on family land in a plot next to Rosalynn, to whom Carter was married for more than 77 years.\n\nCarter, who won the presidency promising good government and honest talk for an electorate disillusioned by the Vietnam War and Watergate, signed significant legislation and negotiated a landmark peace agreement between Israel and Egypt. But Carter also presided over inflation, rising interest rates and international crises — most notably the Iran hostage situation with Americans held in Tehran for more than a year. Carter lost a landslide to Republican Ronald Reagan in 1980.\n\nFormer White House aide Stu Eizenstat used his eulogy to make an effort to reframe the Carter presidency as more successful than voters appreciated at the time.\n\nHe noted Carter deregulated U.S. transportation industries, streamlined energy research and created the Federal Emergency Management Agency. He emphasized that Carter's administration secured the release of the American hostages in Iran, though they were not freed until after his 1980 defeat.\n\n\"He may not be a candidate for Mount Rushmore, but he belongs in the foothills,\" Eizenstat said.\n\nSchedule for the final day of funeral rites for President Jimmy Carter\n\nHere is Thursday's schedule for the final day of rites honoring Jimmy Carter, the 39th president, who died Dec. 29. \n\nAll times are Eastern:9 a.m. — Carter's casket departs the U.S. Capitol. The funeral motorcade travels to Washington National Cathedral.9:30 a.m. — Carter's motorcade arrives at Washington National Cathedral.10 a.m. — The Washington funeral begins.

Trump escalated his criticism of the officials managing the Los Angeles wildfires early Sunday, describing them as \"incompetent\" and expressing frustration over the ongoing crisis. He questioned why the wildfires had not yet been extinguished, despite the significant resources and efforts dedicated to controlling the flames. His comments reflected growing concerns over the handling of the disaster as it continued to devastate communities in the region.Taking to his Truth Social site, Trump wrote, \"The fires are still raging in L.A. The incompetent pols have no idea how to put them out.\"Thousands of magnificent houses are gone, and many more will soon be lost. There is death all over the place.\" He added that the fires are \"one of the worst catastrophes in the history of our Country.\"\"They just can't put out the fires. What's wrong with them?\" he wrote.Trump's remarks indicated that the wildfires, along with the perceived inadequate response from officials, are likely to play a significant role in shaping his domestic political agenda once he takes office on January 20. By criticizing the handling of the crisis, he signaled that disaster management and the effectiveness of government agencies in responding to such emergencies would be key issues for his administration. This focus on the fires and the government's response may drive his policies and public messaging in the early stages of his presidency.He has reignited a long-standing feud with California Governor Gavin Newsom, who has responded by accusing Trump of politicizing the wildfires. This back-and-forth reflects ongoing tensions between the two over how the crisis is being handled and its broader political implications.Since the fires began on Tuesday, California politicians have faced significant criticism, particularly regarding the preparedness of local and state authorities. Many have questioned how the fires grew so quickly into large-scale blazes and whether adequate measures were taken to prevent such a rapid escalation. The situation has sparked a broader debate over the effectiveness of emergency response and management strategies.The situation may soon worsen, as a red flag and fire watch warning issued at 6 p.m. local time on Saturday has now been extended through Wednesday night, raising concerns about the potential for further devastation. The extended warning has heightened fears that the fires could spread even more rapidly, causing additional damage.The fires, which have claimed 16 lives as of Sunday, have led to additional evacuations, with LA County declaring a local health emergency.

The accusations came from a joint investigation by The Sunday Times and The Times and TV show Dispatches. Brand has since denied the allegations as \"egregious\" and claimed the \"mainstream media\" had started a \"coordinated\" witch hunt against him.What To KnowIn an interview with The Telegraph published on Saturday, Grylls, a British adventurer and writer, defended Brand's recent conversion to Christianity, in which Brand revealed in April that he had been baptized as a Christian in the River Thames.\"First of all, I didn't baptize. I never judge and he was a friend through [appearing on] Running Wild [Grylls' reality show], and he's had a real journey in his life. You know what, whoever it is, you can't only stand beside people who have had perfect journeys. It was for him a real moment of humility and repentance and genuine heart-felt finding of quite a faith in his life,\" Grylls said.He added that he believes Brand's embrace of Christianity is genuine, \"People say to me, 'What about the victims?' if they're victims. And I go, 'Of course I stand beside everybody. We are called to love everybody and not to judge anyone.'\"Grylls, a prominent Christian who has appeared in marketing material for the Alpha course, an evangelical introduction to Christianity, has a longstanding friendship with Brand and assisted in the baptism ceremony.Investigation Into Russell Brand's Sexual Assault AllegationsLast November, detectives handed a file of evidence to the Crown Prosecution Service. It came after the investigation revealed four women alleged the sexual assaults occurred between 2006 and 2013 while Brand was a presenter for BBC Radio 2 and Channel 4 as well as when he was an actor in Hollywood.According to The Sunday Times, the investigations have been developing over the past few years with reporters interviewing hundreds of sources who knew or worked with Brand such as ex-girlfriends and their friends and family, comedians, celebrities, people who worked with him in radio and TV, and senior staff at the BBC, Channel 4 and other media organizations.Who Is Russell Brand?Brand, 49, who was born in England is most known for his work as an actor and comedian. His first turning point in his career came in mid-2000s, when he hosted Big Brother's Big Mouth. He then quickly moved on to be a presenter and actor in Hollywood.Brand, who has been open about his use of illegal drugs and addiction to sex, has also written an autobiographyIn addition, over the years, Brand has developed a cult following for his views on politics and society, and more recently has dabbled in the world of conspiracy theories in videos posted on YouTube and Rumble.Brand has emerged as a staunch President-elect Donald Trump supporter in the months leading up to November's election.Who Is Russell Brand's Wife?While Brand is often associated with his ex-wife and pop star Katy Perry, the comedian has been married to Laura Brand since 2017. Russell and Laura share three children together. Laura comes from a relatively famous family. Her father is the Scottish golfer Bernard Gallacher, who was a Ryder Cup captain for multiple European teams.Is Russell Brand Catholic?In May, Brand, who was previously a Buddhist, posted an Instagram picture of his baptism ceremony, which took place near his home in Henley-on-Thames, Oxfordshire. The image was captioned: 'Me, Bear Grylls, The River Thames and of course, The Holy Spirit.' In the Instagram announcement, Brand also noted that his wife is Catholic.However, it remains unclear into which church he has been received, but Brand has since considered himself as someone who is embracing Christianity.Russell Brand's Net WorthAccording to the New York Post, citing the Mirror, in 2023 Brand's net worth was reported to be $20 million.What People Are SayingThe Metropolitan Police said in a statement in November that did not mention Brand by name, \"Following an investigation by Channel 4's Dispatches and the Sunday Times in September 2023, the Met received a number of reports of sexual offences from women in London and elsewhere in the country. A file of evidence has now been passed to the CPS for their consideration. As part of the investigation, a man in his 40s has been interviewed by officers under caution on three separate occasions.\"Public relations expert Molly McPherson previously told Newsweek regarding the sexual assault allegations against Brand, \"Russell Brand's approach is noticeably calculated because he is not just denying the allegations but is also diverting the conversation by framing it as a media attack. It creates a smokescreen, allowing him to mobilize his large and vocal fan base as a counteroffensive tactic.\"What Happens NextThe investigation into Brand's alleged sexual assaults continues.","summary":"In an interview with The Telegraph published on Saturday, Grylls defended Brand's recent conversion to Christianity.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/russell-brands-christianity-bear-grylls-weighs-comedians-conversion-2013650","image":"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2562691/russell-brand.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-01-12 16:19:36","author":"Natalie Venegas","authors":["Natalie Venegas"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":0},{"id":280049408,"title":"Queensland government announces $32m investment into fighting crime","text":"Perth promised new motorsports street circuitThe race to the polls is heating up and WA Premier Roger Cook is committing $217 million for a new motorsports street circuit.

This is not what Donald Trump said as he promised sweeping pardons on day one of his administration for anyone involved in those riots. “Those people have suffered long and hard,” he said adding that there might be some exceptions but he would look at individual cases. More than 1,250 people were convicted or pleaded guilty for their role in the Capitol riot, with charges ranging from trespassing to seditious conspiracy. Several rioters sought to attack top-elected officials, including Rep. Nancy Pelosi and then-Vice President Mike Pence.“I think it’s very simple,” Vance told Bream. “If you protested peacefully on January the 6th and you’ve had [Attorney General] Merrick Garland’s Department of Justice treat you like a gang member, you should be pardoned. If you committed violence on that day, obviously you shouldn’t be pardoned.”— FoxNewsSunday (@FoxNewsSunday) “There’s a little bit of a gray area there, but we’re very much committed to seeing the equal administration of law, and there are a lot of people, we think, in the wake of January 6 who were prosecuted unfairly,” Vance said.Some Republican lawmakers have urged Trump to issue pardons for all January 6 rioters. Georgia Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, a close Trump ally, told the Associated Press last week that those imprisoned over the attacks—regardless of their crime—should be released.“Even the ones that fought Capitol Police, caused damage to the Capitol, I think they’ve served their time, and I think they should all be pardoned and released from prison,” Greene said.","summary":"Vice-President-elect JD Vance did not commit to blanket pardons for January 6 rioters, stating that only those who protested peacefully should be considered. This stance contrasts with Donald Trump's promise of sweeping pardons on day one of his administration. ​“There’s a little bit of a gray area there,” Vance said.","url":"https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/is-jd-vance-not-on-the-same-page-with-trump-on-pardoning-jan-6-rioters-a-little-bit-of-gray-area/articleshow/117178045.cms","image":"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/resizemode-4,width-1280,height-720,msid-117178116/117178116.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-01-12 16:15:18","author":"Toi World Desk","authors":["Toi World Desk"],"language":"en","source_country":"in","sentiment":-0.392},{"id":280049322,"title":"Steve Bannon goes berserk on Elon Musk, vows to drive him away from White House: ‘He is a truly evil guy’","text":"Days after fawning over what tech magnate Elon Musk’s deep pockets could do for the MAGA movement, Steve Bannon went berserk on the world’s richest man and vowed to limit his White House influence.\n\nBannon, 71, who hosts the “War Room” podcast and has a penchant for plotting all-out brass-knuckled political warfare, suggested Musk “should go back to South Africa” and decried his stance on H1-B visas.\n\n“I will have Elon Musk run out of here by Inauguration Day,” Bannon, told the Italian daily Corriere della Sera last week, per excerpts translated by his former employer Breitbart. “He will not have a blue pass to the White House, he will not have full access to the White House, he will be like any other person.”\n\n“He is a truly evil guy, a very bad guy. I made it my personal thing to take this guy down,” he went on. “Before, because he put money in, I was prepared to tolerate it. I’m not prepared to tolerate it anymore.”\n\nLast month, just before Christmas, a war erupted within the MAGA movement between the tech bros and immigration hardliners over H1-B visas, which permit foreign workers to come to the US for specialty occupations. \n\nMusk, 53, a US citizen who emigrated from South Africa, emerged as a fierce defender of H1-B visas. President-elect Donald Trump, 78, eventually backed Musk’s stance and the tech billionaire. But Bannon hasn’t let the H1-B visa flap go. \n\n“This thing of the H-1B visas, it’s about the entire immigration system is gamed by the tech overlords, they use it to their advantage, the people are furious,” Bannon told the outlet\n\nBannon also unleashed on other big-name billionaire Trump backers.\n\n“Peter Thiel, David Sacks, Elon Musk, are all white South Africans,” he added. “He should go back to South Africa. Why do we have South Africans, the most racist people on earth, white South Africans, we have them making any comments at all on what goes on in the United States?”\n\nBillionaire entrepreneur Peter Thiel, is German-American but lived in South Africa and Namibia as a child.\n\nHe had worked with Musk on PayPal, had been a top backer of Vice President-elect JD Vance’s Ohio Senate bid in 2022. \n\nMusk has espoused increasingly conservative viewpoints in the public eye since the COVID-19 pandemic. In the GOP primaries, he backed alternatives to Trump, including Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis (R). However, after the July 13 assassination attempt, Musk began going all in on the president-elect. \n\nSince Trump’s election victory, Musk has spent a large chunk of his time hunkered down at Mar-a-Lago. Trump has tapped him to helm the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), which isn’t actually a government department. \n\nDemocrats have attempted to poke at both Musk’s and Trump’s egos and pit the two against each other. Last month, when Musk whipped up public opposition to a government funding bill in Congress, Democrats branded him “President Musk,” though Trump has so far declined to take the bait. \n\nBannon complained that Musk’s “sole objective is to become a trillionaire.” Bannon has previously called for more taxes on the wealthy and warned about a French Revolution-style uprising in the US over the growing disparities between the mega-rich and the poor. \n\n“[Musk] will do anything to make sure that any one of his companies is protected or has a better deal or he makes more money,” Bannon further groused. “His aggregation of wealth, and then — through wealth — power: that’s what he’s focused on.”\n\nBannon also took a jab at Musk for appearing to concur with a post on X that suggested Americans are too “retarded” to do the jobs that companies use foreigners via the H1-B visa system. Musk later deleted that post. \n\n“He went out of his way to mock our movement as racist and retards, and he lost,” Bannon complained. “We blew him out of the water.”\n\nBefore Musk got behind Trump, Bannon had lashed out at the Tesla and SpaceX for not being critical of China. Musk has waded heavily into US and European politics, but largely eschewed mention of China, where he has factories and a massive Tesla sales business.\n\nJust last week, however, Bannon argued that despite their differences, Musk joining the MAGA movement could be an important boon and took note of the billionaire’s efforts to wade into European politics.\n\n“I support his participation because the enemy of my enemy is my friend,” Bannon told Bloomberg. “Musk just spent a quarter of a billion dollars to elect Trump.”\n\n“If he puts the same amount of money into all of Europe that he put behind Trump, he will flip every nation to a populist agenda. There’s not a centrist left-wing government in Europe that will be able to withstand that onslaught.”","summary":"Days after fawning over what tech magnate Elon Musk’s deep pockets could do for the MAGA movement, Steve Bannon went berserk on the world’s richest man and vowed to limit his White House influence.

PICTURE: REUTERS/MARIO ANZUONI\n\nLos Angeles — Aircraft dropped water and fire retardant on steep hills to stem the eastward spread of the Palisades wildfire in Los Angeles on Saturday as on-the-ground firefighting intensified amid warnings of wind gusts of up to 110km that could make matters worse.\nOver the past 24 hours, the Palisades Fire spread over an additional 400ha, consuming more homes, officials reported.\nSix simultaneous blazes that have ripped across Los Angeles County neighbourhoods since Tuesday have killed at least 16 people from late Saturday, the Washington Post and other media reported, citing the Los Angeles County medical examiner’s office. Reuters could not immediately reach the coroner.\nThe blazes have damaged or destroyed 12,000 structures, fire officials said. At least 13 people are estimated to be missing.\nThe death toll is expected to mount when firefighters are able to conduct house-to-house searches.\nCal Fire official Todd Hopkins told a press conference that while 11% of the Palisades Fire was now contained, it has burned more than 22,000 acres.\nHopkins said the Palisades Fire had spread into the Mandeville Canyon neighbourhood and threatened to jump into Brentwood, an upscale neighbourhood where celebrities live and play, and the San Fernando Valley. It also inched towards the north-south 405 freeway.\nThe National Weather Service had warned of worsening Santa Ana winds that it predicted would pick up Saturday night into Sunday morning in Los Angeles and Ventura counties, and again on late Monday through Tuesday morning.\n\n A LAPD helicopter patrols following the Palisades Fire at the Pacific Palisades neighborhood in Los Angeles, California, US, on January 10 2025. Picture: MIKE BLAKE/REUTERS\n\n“We're in a continued period of critical fire weather through Wednesday,” said NWS meteorologist Rose Schoenfeld. Conditions were expected to moderate by Thursday.\nEvacuation orders throughout the Los Angeles area now cover 153,000 residents, putting 57,000 structures at risk. Another 166,000 residents have been warned that they may have to evacuate, said Los Angeles County sheriff Robert Luna.\nBut progress was reported in bringing electrical power back to Los Angeles neighbourhoods. Southern California Edison CEO Steven Powell told reporters there were now about 50,000 customers without power, “down from over half a million just a couple days ago”.\nPowell said there was no evidence that any of Edison’s equipment caused the Hurst fire but that the investigation was continuing.\nAs state and local officials grappled with the worst cluster of fires in Los Angeles history, President Joe Biden spoke by phone with some of them to get an update on their efforts. He was also briefed by senior aides on federal resources that were being dispatched.\nBiden’s major disaster declaration unlocked federal assistance for those affected by the wildfires, clearing the way for the Federal Emergency Management Agency (Fema) to provide support. Fema officials were at the Pasadena Convention Centre helping residents navigate aid applications.\n\n People hold signs asking for donations for people affected by the Eaton fire in Pasadena, California, US, on January 11 2025.Picture: MARIO ANZUONI/REUTERS\n\nSupport can range from funding for home repairs to money to replace lost food or medication, said Fema spokesperson Michael Hart, adding that assistance can be provided within days.\nLos Angeles Board of Supervisors chair Kathryn Barger told reporters she had invited president-elect Donald Trump to visit the county to get a first-hand look at the destruction.\nLuna said the sheriff’ office has dispatched 40 search and rescue team workers to work jointly with other agencies, including the use of cadaver dogs to search for remains of victims and help reunite separated families.\n“LA County had another night of unimaginable terror and heartbreak,” said Los Angeles County supervisor Lindsey Horvath.\nThe fierce Santa Ana winds that fanned the infernos eased on Friday night. But the Palisades Fire on the city’s western edge was heading in a new direction as winds came off the Pacific Ocean.\nThe fire has razed whole neighbourhoods leaving the smouldering ruins of what had been people’s homes and possessions.\nBefore the latest flare-up, firefighters had reported progress in subduing the Palisades Fire and the Eaton Fire in the foothills east of the metropolis after it burned out of control for days.\nIn Altadena, official Don Fregulia said managing the Eaton Fire and its impact will be a “huge, Herculean task” that he said will take “many weeks of work”.\nThe two big fires combined have consumed more than 14,500ha, or 145km2 — two and a half times the land area of Manhattan.\nSeven neighbouring states, the federal government and Canada and Mexico have rushed aid and firefighters to California, bolstering aerial teams dropping water and fire retardant on the flaming hills and crews on the ground attacking fire lines with hand tools and hoses.\nOfficials have declared a public health emergency due to the thick, toxic smoke.\nHomes reduced to ash\nPacific Palisades residents who ventured back to their devastated neighbourhoods on Friday were shocked to find brick chimneys looming over charred waste and burnt-out vehicles as acrid smoke lingered in the air.\n“This was a house that was loved,” Kelly Foster said while combing through the rubble where her house once stood.\nFoster’sdaughter, Ada, said she tried to get inside but “I just became sick. I just couldn’t even... Yeah, it’s hard.”\nIn Rick McGeagh’s Palisades neighbourhood, only six of 60 homes survived and all that remained standing at his ranch house was a statue of the Virgin Mary.\n“Everything else is ash and rubble,” said McGeagh, a commercial real estate broker who, along with his wife, raised three children at their home.\nOn Friday morning, hundreds of people streamed into a parking lot near the Rose Bowl stadium in Pasadena for donated clothing, diapers and bottled water.\nDenise Doss said she was anxious to return to her destroyed home in Altadena to see if anything was salvageable, but officials stopped her due to safety concerns.\n“At least to say goodbye until we can rebuild. I will let God lead me,” Doss said.\nBillions in losses\nMany Altadena residents said they were worried government resources would go to wealthier areas and that insurers might short-change those who cannot afford to contest denials of fire claims.\nBeyond those who lost their homes, tens of thousands remained without power, and millions of people were exposed to poorer air quality, as the fires lofted traces of metals, plastics and other synthetic materials.\nPrivate forecaster AccuWeather estimated the damage and economic loss at $135bn-$150bn, portending an arduous recovery and soaring homeowners’ insurance costs.\nCalifornia Insurance commissioner Ricardo Lara called on insurers on Friday to suspend pending non-renewals and cancellations that homeowners received before the fires began and to extend the grace period for payments.\n Biden has declared the fires a major disaster and said the US government would reimburse 100% of the recovery for the next six months.\nLaw enforcement officials were warning residents to adhere to curfews amid arrests with charges of burglary, looting and the possession of concealed firearms.\n“You go out there and you violate this curfew, you are going to spend time in jail,” Luna said.\n\nLos Angeles’ ordinaryfire survivors say they are overlooked\nLess help has allegedly been received by residents of Altadena, a racially and economically diverse community\n\nFilm stars, celebrities lose homes, flee from Los Angeles wildfires\nJamie Lee Curtis, James Woods, Mandy Moore, Mark Hamill and Maria Shriver among those who lost homes\n\nClimate change ‘shows its claws’ with rising costs for disasters\nMunich Re estimates insured losses soared to $140bn for 2024 as catastrophes mount\n\nRaging Los Angeles fires kill at least two people\nUpmarket Pacific Palisades among suburbs affected as officials order mass evacuations\n\n4 days ago \n\nNext Article \n\nSupport our award-winning journalism.The Premium package (digital only) is R30 for the first month and thereafter you pay R129 p/m now ad-free for all subscribers.\nSubscribe now \n\nWould you like to comment on this article?\n Sign up (it's quick and free) or sign in now.\n\nPlease read our Comment Policy before commenting.\n\n Subscribe now for an ad-free experience.Support independent journalism.\nSubscribe now \n\nLA Palisades fire expected to spread as death ... \nWorld /Americas\n\nUS House passes bill to sanction International ... \nWorld /Americas\n\nNEWS ANALYSIS: Trump previews combative foreign ... \nWorld /Americas\n\nMozambique’s top court confirms ruling party win ... \nWorld /Africa\n\nLegislators want US to curb biotech exports to ... \nWorld /Americas\n\nRelated Articles \n\nLos Angeles’ ordinaryfire survivors say they are overlooked\n World /Americas\n\nFilm stars, celebrities lose homes, flee from Los Angeles wildfires\n World /Americas\n\nClimate change ‘shows its claws’ with rising costs for disasters\n\nRaging Los Angeles fires kill at least two people\n World /Americas\n\n Published by Arena Holdings and distributed with the Financial Mail on the last Thursday of every month except December and January.\n\n Subscribe now for an ad-free experience.Support independent journalism.\nSubscribe now \n\nLA Palisades fire expected to spread as death ... \nWorld /Americas\n\nUS House passes bill to sanction International ... \nWorld /Americas\n\nNEWS ANALYSIS: Trump previews combative foreign ... \nWorld /Americas\n\nMozambique’s top court confirms ruling party win ... \nWorld /Africa\n\nLegislators want US to curb biotech exports to ... \nWorld /Americas\n\nRelated Articles \n\nLos Angeles’ ordinaryfire survivors say they are overlooked\n World /Americas\n\nFilm stars, celebrities lose homes, flee from Los Angeles wildfires\n World /Americas\n\nClimate change ‘shows its claws’ with rising costs for disasters\n\nRaging Los Angeles fires kill at least two people\n World /Americas\n\n Published by Arena Holdings and distributed with the Financial Mail on the last Thursday of every month except December and January.\n\n Science & Environment \n\n Middle East \n\n Other Sport\n\n Companies \n\n Financial Services\n Healthcare\n Industrials\n Innovation\n\n Land & Agriculture\n Management\n\n Retail & Consumer\n Telecoms & Technology\n Trade & Industry\n Transport & Tourism\n Markets Data\n\n Markets Data \n\n Legal Notices \n\n Columnists\n Editorials\n\n Contact us \n Subscribe \n\n Terms & Conditions \n Privacy policy \n\n Careers and Tenders \n\n Contact us \n Subscribe \n\n Terms & Conditions \n Privacy policy \n\n © 2025 Arena Holdings.

Exchangein New York City, US. File photo: ANDREW KELLY/REUTERS\n\nBengaluru/New York — US stocks sold off on Friday, with the S&P 500 erasing its 2025 gains, after an upbeat jobs report stoked fresh inflation fears, reinforcing bets that the Federal Reserve will be cautious in cutting interest rates this year.\nWall Street’s main indices closed their second consecutive week in the red.\n“We started the year on the wrong foot,” said Sam Stovall, market strategist at CFRA Research, commenting on the impact of a hotter-than-expectedjobs data on equities. He added the environment for stocks could become “quite challenging”.\nThe Dow Jones industrial average fell 696.75 points, or 1.63%, to 41,938.45, the S&P 500 lost 91.21 points, or 1.54%, to 5,827.04 and the Nasdaq composite lost 317.25 points, or 1.63%, to 19,161.63.\nThe domestically focused small-cap Russell 2000 index also fell 2.27%, slipping into correction territory as it was down 10.4% from its November 25 closing high. Wall Street’s fear gauge hit a three-week high on Friday.\nA labour department report showedjobs growth unexpectedly accelerated in December while the unemployment rate fell to 4.1% as the labour market ended the year on a strong note.\nA hotter-than-expectedjobs gain could translate into faster economic expansion, leading to a rise in prices. To contain a still-elevated inflation, the Fed could be forced to take a more conservative stance on rate cuts this year.\nTraders see the central bank lowering borrowing costs for the first time in June and then staying steady for the rest of the year, according to the CME Group’s FedWatch Tool.\nBrokerages also revised their Fed rate cut forecasts, with BofA Global Research forecasting a potential rate hike.\nHowever, Chicago Fed president Austan Goolsbee said there wasno evidence the economy is overheating again, adding he still expects it will be appropriate to lower interest rates further.\nPressuring stocks, the yield on the 30-year Treasury note touched 5% — its highest since November 2023, but slightly retreated to 4.966%.\nMost of the 11 S&P 500 sectors declined, except for the energy index, which rose 0.34%.\nAdding to the dour mood, a University of Michigan survey showed consumer sentiment dropped to 73.2 in January from the previous month.\nFresh inflation worries have taken the spotlight, compelling the Fed to issue a cautious forecast on monetary easing last month, as it anticipates policy changes on trade and immigration under president-elect Donald Trump, who is expected to take office in 10 days.\nOn January 15, investors will closely watch the release of the monthly consumer price index, which could spark further volatility if it comes in higher than expectations.\n“Markets would sell off meaningfully because all of a sudden the Fed is probably in a position not just to not cut rates and support markets, but to actually hike rates,” said Bryant VanCronkhite, senior portfolio manager at Allspring.\nChip stocks such as Nvidia dropped about3%, weighed down by a report that the US could announce new export regulations as early as Friday.\nConstellation Energy soared 25.16% after agreeing to buy privately held natural gas and geothermal company Calpine Corp for $16.4bn, while Constellation Brands slid 17.09% after cutting its annual sales and profit forecasts.\nWalgreens Boots Alliance jumped 27.55% after reporting an upbeat quarterly profit.\nDeclining issues outnumbered advancers by a 4.24-to-1 ratio on the NYSE and by a 3.32-to-1 ratio on the Nasdaq.\nThe S&P 500 posted six new 52-week highs and 32 new lows while the Nasdaq composite recorded 39 new highs and 211 new lows.\nVolume on US exchanges was 16.24-billion shares, compared with the 12.31-billion average for the full session over the past 20 trading days.\n\nMARKET WRAP: Rand breaches 19/$ after hot US jobs report\nThe JSE all share lost 0.28% to 83,466

US and Europe driving up fuel demand for heating.\nBrent crude futures climbed 40c, or 0.5%, to $77.32 a barrel at 6.02am GMT. US West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures gained 38c, also 0.5%, to $74.30.\nOver the three weeks ending January 10, Brent has advanced 6% while WTI has jumped 7%\nAnalysts at JPMorgan attributed the gains to growing concern over supply disruptions due to tightening sanctions, amid low oil stockpiles, freezing temperatures in many parts of the US and Europe and improving sentiment regarding China’s stimulus measures.\nThe US weather bureau expects central and eastern parts of the country to experience below-average temperatures. Many regions in Europe had also been hit by extreme cold and were likely to continue to experience a colder-than-usual start to the year, which JPMorgan analysts expect to boost demand.\n“We anticipate a significant year-over-year increase in global oil demand of 1.6-million barrels a day in the first quarter of 2025, primarily boosted by ... demand for heating oil, kerosene, and LPG,” JPMorgan said in a note on Friday.\nMeanwhile, the premium of the front-month Brent contract over the six-month contract reached its widest since August this week, potentially indicating supply tightness at a time of rising demand.\nOil prices have rallied despite the US dollar strengthening for six consecutive weeks. A stronger dollar typically weighs on prices, as it makes purchases of crude expensive outside the US.\nSupplies could be further hit as US President Joe Biden is expected to announce new sanctions targeting Russia’s economy this week in a bid to bolster Ukraine’s war effort against Moscow before president-elect Donald Trump takes office on January 20. A key target of sanctions so far has been Russia’s oil industry.\n“Uncertainty over how hawkish Trump will be with Iran will be providing some support. Asian buyers have already been looking for alternative grades from the Middle East, with broader sanctions against Russia and Iran making this oil flow more difficult,” ING analysts said in a note on Friday. \n\nGlobal markets stressed ahead of US jobs data\nUS nonfarm payrolls report could worsen or ease sell-off in the global bond market\n\nGold on track for best week since mid-November\nInvestors are waiting for US jobs data to gauge how aggressively the Fed may cut rates in 2025\n\nMARKET WRAP: Rand recovers slightly but dollar’s strength continues to rise\nUS currency supported by higher US treasury yields and uncertainty over Trump’s stance on trade tariffs\n\n2 days ago \n\nNext Article \n\nSupport our award-winning journalism.The Premium package (digital only) is R30 for the first month and thereafter you pay R129 p/m now ad-free for all subscribers.\nSubscribe now \n\nWould you like to comment on this article?\n Sign up (it's quick and free) or sign in now.\n\nPlease read our Comment Policy before commenting.\n\n Subscribe now for an ad-free experience.Support independent journalism.\nSubscribe now \n\nMARKET WRAP: Rand breaches 19/$ after hot US jobs ... \n\nJSE firms and rand remains muted before key US ... \n\nAsia shares rise, dollar supported by elevated ... \n\nCold weather supports oil \n\nMARKET WRAP: Rand weakens again in thin trade \n\n Published by Arena Holdings and distributed with the Financial Mail on the last Thursday of every month except December and January.\n\n Subscribe now for an ad-free experience.Support independent journalism.\nSubscribe now \n\nMARKET WRAP: Rand breaches 19/$ after hot US jobs ... \n\nJSE firms and rand remains muted before key US ... \n\nAsia shares rise, dollar supported by elevated ... \n\nCold weather supports oil \n\nMARKET WRAP: Rand weakens again in thin trade \n\n Published by Arena Holdings and distributed with the Financial Mail on the last Thursday of every month except December and January.\n\n Science & Environment \n\n Middle East \n\n Other Sport\n\n Companies \n\n Financial Services\n Healthcare\n Industrials\n Innovation\n\n Land & Agriculture\n Management\n\n Retail & Consumer\n Telecoms & Technology\n Trade & Industry\n Transport & Tourism\n Markets Data\n\n Markets Data \n\n Legal Notices \n\n Columnists\n Editorials\n\n Contact us \n Subscribe \n\n Terms & Conditions \n Privacy policy \n\n Careers and Tenders \n\n Contact us \n Subscribe \n\n Terms & Conditions \n Privacy policy \n\n © 2025 Arena Holdings.

January 11 2025.Picture: AJENG DINAR ULFIANA/REUTERS\n\nTokyo/Washington — The foreign ministers of Japan and the US said their countries’ ties were stronger than ever on Tuesday, even after Japan’s prime minister called US President Joe Biden’s decision to block Nippon Steel’s $14.9-billion bid for US Steel “perplexing.”\nBiden’s move last Friday was a jolt to US efforts to boost ties just as neighbouring South Korea’s political crisis potentially complicates a deepening trilateral relationship between Washington, Seoul and Tokyo formed to counter China’s growing military power.\nOn Monday, Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba expressed confusion over Biden’s decision, but after meeting in Tokyo on Tuesday, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Japan’s Foreign Minister Takeshi Iwaya hailed bilateral ties as stronger than ever.\nIn remarks to the media, at which no questions were taken, Blinken did not mention Nippon Steel, but a statement from Japan’s foreign ministry said he and Iwaya “exchanged views on the economy, including on the acquisition of US Steel Corporation by Nippon Steel Corporation.”\nIt said they “reaffirmed the importance of Japan-US economic relations, including investments by Japanese companies in the US.”\nBlinken said the two countries were “leading the way” in co-operation between like-minded countries and added: “I have great confidence that will continue for many, many years to come.”\nAfter meeting Ishiba at his residence, Blinken did not respond to questions shouted by reporters about the potential effect of Biden’s decision on bilateral ties.\nAnalysts say that while it could have a chilling effect on Japanese investment into the US, any damage to their wider relationship will probably be limited given the two countries’ shared security concerns about China.\nBusiness lobbies in both Japan and the US have pushed hard for the merger, backing their arguments up with warnings about the effect on the vital US-Japan relationship.\nBut it still faced opposition from both Biden and president-elect Donald Trump, who takes office on January 20 and was assiduously courted by Japan in the run up to his re-election.\nAhead of his trip, the State Department said Blinken wanted to build on the momentum of US-Japan-South Korea trilateral co-operation.\nIn Seoul on Monday, Blinken reaffirmed confidence in South Korea’s handling of its political turmoil as investigators there sought to extend a warrant for the arrest of impeached President Yoon Suk Yeol.\nTrump’s allies have also reassured Seoul and Tokyo he will support continuing efforts to improve ties and advance military, economic and diplomatic co-operation to counter China and North Korea, Reuters reported ahead of the US election.\nNippon Steel and US Steel filed a lawsuit on Monday charging that Biden violated the US constitution by blocking their merger through what they termed a sham national security review. They called for the US federal court to overturn the decision.\nA Japanese diplomat told Reuters Biden’s move could chill foreign direct investment, but hoped close US-Japan relations would continue, with a strong emphasis on re-establishing the strong ties with Trump seen during his previous administration, and taking advantage of the increasingly hawkish mood in Washington on China.\nNicholas Szechenyi, a Japan expert at Washington’s Center for Strategic and International Studies, said Japan would not let the decision poison the US-Japan relationship. “It’s too important for Japan’s national security,” he said.\nTrump reiterated after his election win that he was “totally against” the merger and vowed to block it as president and support US Steel with tax breaks and tariffs.\nA former senior official in Trump’s first administration told Reuters he believed Trump would have taken the same approach as Biden.\nMarc Busch, a fellow at Georgetown University’s McDonough School of Business, forecast “significant fallout” for US efforts to work with allies to create resilient supply chains in the face of Chinese dominance or competition in key areas.\n“Japan and other allies will have doubts about investing in or aligning with politically sensitive US supply chains,” he said. “China must be chuckling to itself that it could never have hoped for a better outcome.”\n\nUS Steel and Nippon Steel sue Biden administration over blocked merger\nBiden blocked proposed deal on national security grounds\n\nWhite House mum on Biden blocking US Steel sale to Japanese buyer\nAnonymous officials cited as saying call to stop the deal has come despite contrary efforts by senior advisers\n\n1 week ago \n\nNext Article \n\nSupport our award-winning journalism.The Premium package (digital only) is R30 for the first month and thereafter you pay R129 p/m now ad-free for all subscribers.\nSubscribe now \n\nWould you like to comment on this article?\n Sign up (it's quick and free) or sign in now.\n\nPlease read our Comment Policy before commenting.\n\n Subscribe now for an ad-free experience.Support independent journalism.\nSubscribe now \n\nLA Palisades fire expected to spread as death ... \nWorld /Americas\n\nUS House passes bill to sanction International ... \nWorld /Americas\n\nNEWS ANALYSIS: Trump previews combative foreign ... \nWorld /Americas\n\nMozambique’s top court confirms ruling party win ... \nWorld /Africa\n\nLegislators want US to curb biotech exports to ... \nWorld /Americas\n\nRelated Articles \n\nArcelorMittal SA’s collapse highlights need for industrial policy reform\n\nUS Steel and Nippon Steel sue Biden administration over blocked merger\n World /Americas\n\nNippon Steel facing growth challenges after US Steel purchase blocked\n Companies /Industrials\n\nWhite House mum on Biden blocking US Steel sale to Japanese buyer\n World /Americas\n\n Published by Arena Holdings and distributed with the Financial Mail on the last Thursday of every month except December and January.\n\n Subscribe now for an ad-free experience.Support independent journalism.\nSubscribe now \n\nLA Palisades fire expected to spread as death ... \nWorld /Americas\n\nUS House passes bill to sanction International ... \nWorld /Americas\n\nNEWS ANALYSIS: Trump previews combative foreign ... \nWorld /Americas\n\nMozambique’s top court confirms ruling party win ... \nWorld /Africa\n\nLegislators want US to curb biotech exports to ... \nWorld /Americas\n\nRelated Articles \n\nArcelorMittal SA’s collapse highlights need for industrial policy reform\n\nUS Steel and Nippon Steel sue Biden administration over blocked merger\n World /Americas\n\nNippon Steel facing growth challenges after US Steel purchase blocked\n Companies /Industrials\n\nWhite House mum on Biden blocking US Steel sale to Japanese buyer\n World /Americas\n\n Published by Arena Holdings and distributed with the Financial Mail on the last Thursday of every month except December and January.\n\n Science & Environment \n\n Middle East \n\n Other Sport\n\n Companies \n\n Financial Services\n Healthcare\n Industrials\n Innovation\n\n Land & Agriculture\n Management\n\n Retail & Consumer\n Telecoms & Technology\n Trade & Industry\n Transport & Tourism\n Markets Data\n\n Markets Data \n\n Legal Notices \n\n Columnists\n Editorials\n\n Contact us \n Subscribe \n\n Terms & Conditions \n Privacy policy \n\n Careers and Tenders \n\n Contact us \n Subscribe \n\n Terms & Conditions \n Privacy policy \n\n © 2025 Arena Holdings.

Mike Lawler, Nicole Malliotakis, Nick LaLota and Andrew Garbarino are among those expected to meet with Trump to discuss the so-called SALT deduction cap that’s been excoriated on both sides of the aisle since Trump signed much smaller deduction limits into law during his first term.\n\nWhile Trump has made allusions in recent months to restoring the so-called SALT deductions, Republican lawmakers who have been vocal about repealing the cap are managing expectations around a full restoration.\n\n“I’ve been very clear, I will not support a tax bill that does not lift the cap on SALT,” Lawler told Spectrum News this week. “Ideally, we would go back to unlimited, but I'm not sure that's realistic as you're negotiating through a tax bill.”\n\nLawler reintroduced his bill this week seeking a more generous deduction limit — $100,000 for single filers and $200,000 for married couples — as the freshly reelected House Republican weighs his political future. Current law allows for a $10,000 deduction for both.\n\nA separate high-profile attempt led by Lawler to reform SALT for married couples faltered in the House last February, prompting Republicans to accuse Democrats of playing politics with the issue by withholding support for the bill. Multiple lawmakers have introduced or backed measures for SALT reform.\n\nPolling indicates about 75 percent of New Yorkers want to to see the cap raised to some extent, if not eliminated. It's a particularly potent issue in suburban areas of New York City where homeowner populations are large and property taxes are high. Democratic Gov. Kathy Hochul is demanding a full repeal.\n\n“Republicans have failed in restoring the ability of New Yorkers to deduct their state and local taxes,” she said during an interview on PIX 11 Friday night. “It's been in place since Abraham Lincoln was president. It was removed in 2017 under Donald Trump. I'm really hoping that he will keep his promise and not just tweak it up ... [but] restore our ability to have that deduction.”\n\nAfter the governor made similar comments on social media earlier in the week, New York Republicans — including those poised to meet with Trump on Saturday — immediately piled on.\n\n“You do realize that the reason New York needs SALT relief is because YOU keep taxing New Yorkers to death? Why don’t you just lower income taxes??” Malliotakis posted in response.\n\nIn a video taken in front of the U.S. Capitol this week, LaLota said he was among those working to “get a higher deduction of the state and local tax,\" as he sprinkled generous portions of salt on what appeared to be a balcony floor.\n\n“I'm here spreading the word of our SALT message, bringing it down to Mar-a-Lago this weekend, making sure the president and the House are on the same page,” LaLota said.","summary":"Reps.

They just can't put out the fires. What's wrong with them?\" Trump said on his Truth Social platform.\n\nTeams with cadaver dogs were combing through the rubble, with several people known to be missing and fears that the death toll will grow.\n\nAmong those known to have died in the tragedy was former Australian child star Rory Sykes, who appeared in British TV show \"Kiddy Kapers\" in the 1990s.\n\nClimate impact\n\nA huge investigation by federal and local authorities was underway to determine what caused the blazes.\n\nCalifornia Governor Gavin Newsom told Meet the Press he was also launching a \"Marshall Plan\" for the state as it looks to rebuild.\n\n\"We already have a team looking at reimagining L.A. 2.0,\" he said.\n\nHe also stressed the immediate problem of weather conditions, saying \"the challenge is the winds. We've got these winds coming back this evening, Sunday night. We've got peak winds on Monday.\"\n\nWhile the ignition of a wildfire can be deliberate, they are often natural, and a vital part of an environment's life cycle.\n\nBut urban sprawl puts people more frequently in harm's way, and the changing climate -- supercharged by humanity's unchecked use of fossil fuels -- is exacerbating the conditions that give rise to destructive blazes.\n\n(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)","summary":"US officials warned &quot;dangerous and strong&quot; winds were set to push deadly wildfires further through Los Angeles residential areas Sunday as firefighters struggled to make progress against the flames.","url":"https://nation.lk/online/dangerous-winds-threaten-to-spread-los-angeles-wildfires-officials-291349.html","image":"https://c.ndtvimg.com/2025-01/r3io7f_los-angeles-fire_625x300_12_January_25.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-01-12 16:00:06","author":null,"language":"en","source_country":"lk","sentiment":-0.297},{"id":280048010,"title":"Montana elected a firefighter to the Senate. He’s already pushing for solutions","text":"(CNN) — With wildfires fires ravaging Los Angeles, the firefighter-turned-senator from Montana wants to fight bureaucracy.\n\nLess than a week into his new job, Montana Republican Tim Sheehy is finding plenty of use for his previous experience as an aerial firefighter and wildfire entrepreneur as he pushes for new legislation to address the new reality of a fire season that never ends.\n\nReset your view of wildfires\n\n“There’s a huge dichotomy in America between structural firefighting — the red fire truck, traditional firemen everyone’s familiar with — and wildland firefighting,” Sheehy told CNN’s Kaitlan Collins on Thursday, adding that the country needs more money to fight wildfires and to cut past wildlife protections when flames are raging.\n\n“The entire wildfire community has been speaking for years, shouting from the rooftops that this big one was going to be coming, and we’re not ready,” he said. That big one is now here in Los Angeles, he said.\n\nScientists and activists alarmed by the climate crisis have also been talking about the likelihood of a never-ending fire season, although Sheehy did not mention the climate. But the new reality of fire season is beyond dispute.\n\nA year-round threat in need of a bipartisan solution\n\n“There’s no fire season in California. It’s year-round,” Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom told CNN’s Anderson Cooper on Wednesday.\n\nSheehy echoed that sentiment when he told Collins, “It’s a year-round threat. It’s a 50-state threat.”\n\nThe fires are still raging in LA, but already Sheehy is working with Sens. Adam Schiff of California and Andy Kim of New Jersey, both Democrats whose states have suffered from wildfires, on new legislation.\n\n“This can be a bipartisan solution,” Sheehy said, adding that he, Schiff and Kim don’t see eye to eye on a lot things, but on this, they can work together.\n\nCNN reached out to Kim’s and Schiff’s offices to inquire about their priorities for a piece of wildfire preparedness legislation.\n\nWith his bona fides and the support of President-elect Donald Trump, Sheehy said there is speedy movement toward a new law.\n\n“We’re going to try to start making these changes immediately, and punch through the bureaucracy. Because we have brave firefighters out there on the ground, and they need the right amount of support, and they’re not getting it,” Sheehy told Collins.\n\nWhere is the water?\n\nHe said there will need to be a focus on how states like California have approached water.\n\n“You’ve been seeing a lot of criticism of the California government, and other entities in the government, not unfairly, about the restriction of water use,” Sheehy said.\n\nTrump is among those who have criticized California’s government for its approach to water management, although, as CNN’s Daniel Dale noted, the president-elect’s arguments about the availability of water were not entirely rooted in reality.\n\nOfficials in Los Angeles have said it is the scale of multiple fires being fought simultaneously that sapped hydrants of pressure when it was needed most, but there will certainly be an accounting to determine why, exactly, the system ran dry.\n\nWhat should a new law do?\n\nAs he tries to lead the way to a new law, Sheehy said it needs to include a readiness requirement to respond to a wildfire.\n\n“It can take hours. It can take days, before an aircraft or a fire truck can respond to a wildland fire,” he said. “We have to reform that. That’s No. 1.”\n\nHis second priority would be to make the national wildfire apparatus a year-round operation.\n\n“We treat these firefighters, who are brave first responders, we treat them like seasonal ski resort employees. They get underpaid, they don’t get benefits, they don’t get medical care, if they get injured on the job. … We do our best for our troops. Wildland firefighters don’t get any of that,” he said.\n\nThere have been efforts to increase funding for firefighters in recent years. The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law signed by President Joe Biden in 2021 allocated billions of dollars to raise wages for firefighters. The Inflation Reduction Act passed by Democrats the following year also included funding to mitigate the risk of wildfires. The Los Angeles disaster could create momentum to do much more.\n\nFirefighting with the private sector in the era of DOGE and spending cuts Spending more money could be difficult at the outset of the Trump administration since Republicans are entering office with promises to cut government spending, not increase it.\n\nIn a December op-ed for Fox News, Sheehy argued that the government efficiency effort being led by businessmen Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy presents an opportunity to improve wildfire response by putting a focus on the private sector’s ability to respond to fires.\n\n“The private sector always has and always will produce new innovations and better results faster and cheaper than the government. The same holds true in wildfire response. We must embrace this truth. Fostering stronger public-private partnerships with the wildland fire industry is essential,” Sheehy wrote.\n\nA business built on fighting wildfires\n\nIt’s important to note here that some of Sheehy’s personal wealth comes in part from the aerial firefighting company he founded and used to lead, Bridger Aerospace, which relies on government contracts to help fight wildfires.\n\nThe young company has struggled financially and, during Sheehy’s Senate campaign, questions were raised about a $160 million public bond Gallatin County in Montana backed to help the private enterprise. Sheehy resigned as CEO in July during his Senate bid.\n\nMusk’s Tesla and SpaceX have also relied on public backing to build wealth.\n\nSheehy told Collins that fires put millionaires and billionaires out on the street alongside the poor.\n\n“They’re going to burn our houses the same way,” he said. “Let’s get ready.”\n\nThe-CNN-Wire ™ & © 2025 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros.

As a case in point, according to a recent Wells Fargo report, American banks currently possess high capital levels, low risk ratios and liquidity that is approaching a fifteen-year high.\n\nNotwithstanding, the risk of repeating malpractices is not remote. In the US, President-elect Donald Trump has recently made statements about the need to limit banking supervision and to lower interest rates, indicating his intention to interfere with the independent operation of the supervisory authority. Recently, a number of credit institutions in the US filed a lawsuit against the Federal Reserve, challenging its key supervisory powers, including the conduct of bank stress exercises.\n\nThis would have been unthinkable only a few years ago. The balance is therefore fragile and, if the agents involved do not act responsibly, there is a looming risk of repeated crises.\n\nAndreas Charalambous and Omiros Pissarides are economists and the opinions they express are personal","summary":"Banks play a key role and are inextricably linked to the outlook of the economy, mainly through supporting growth by providing financing to businesses and individuals.

Like China's President Xi Jinping, Prime Minister Modi is deputing his top mandarin on the landmark occasion, behooving the traditional non-partisan discretion both nations exercise. But leaders of several other countries, ideologically aligned with Trump, are themselves making a dash to Washington DC to revel in the rise of the right across the world. Among them: Italy's Georgia Meloni, Argentina's Javier Mellei, and Hungary's Victor Orban. Trump has also invited ideological journeymen like Brazil's Jair Bolsonaro, who like him was voted out after a stint in power and claimed the elections were stolen. The US Presidential inauguration is customarily a strictly domestic affair with no record of any foreign leader formally attending one in 248 years. In fact, so insular is the ceremony, typically held on the steps of the Capitol in near-freezing temperatures at noon on January 20, that the State Department, lead agency for foreign interface, sent a letter to embassies ahead of the 2009 Obama inauguration saying “As in the past, foreign delegations will not be invited to Washington for this occasion,” after polite inquiries about a seat at the milestone event that saw the US elect the first black person to the White House. But as with many other conventions he has torpedoed, Trump is set to toss this aside in a celebration of the right although there will be some unusual guests. Among them, El Salvador's outlier president Nayib Bukele and Israeli settlement leaders .Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu's attendance though is up in the air after Trump threw a social media grenade over the weekend when he shared post of public policy maven Jeffrey Sachs calling Netanyahu a “deep, dark son of a b*tch” who has been dragging the US into endless wars in the Middle East. Presidential historians are already chalking up notes to highlight this will be an unprecedented inauguration. Aside from Trump becoming only the second US president in history to serve non-consecutive terms, the event will also take place with US flags at half-mast to honor the passing of President Jimmy Carter. Trump and his supporters have expressed disquiet at what they see as a petty action by the outgoing Biden administration although the US flag code prescribes lowering the flags to half-staff for a 30-day period after the death of current and former presidents. Flags were at half-mast at Nixon's second inauguration after President Truman died in the weeks before. Trump himself is piqued about the flag issue. \"The Democrats are all ‘giddy’ about our magnificent American Flag potentially being at ‘half mast’ during my Inauguration. They think it’s so great, and are so happy about it because, in actuality, they don’t love our Country, they only think about themselves. Look at what they’ve done to our once GREAT America over the past four years - It’s a total mess!” he complained last week. \"Nobody wants to see this, and no American can be happy about it. Let’s see how it plays out. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!” he added, in an indication that he will restore the flag after he is sworn in since the flag code is convention, not law. Foreign attendees though will be more concerned about the weather than the flag. Inauguration Day, January 20, is typically wintry and cold although the oath of office is always set for noon. The story goes that William Harrison, the first US President to die in office, died of pneumonia a month after Inauguration Day where he delivered a two-hour speech and rode in an open horse carriage with no hat or overcoat, attending parties and balls in wet clothes. Current weather forecast for January 20, 2025 shows a maximum temperature of 35F (2C) and a minimum of 19F (-7C).","summary":"India's external affairs minister S Jaishankar will attend Donald Trump's inauguration as the 47th US President on January 20, joining a group of mostly right-wing foreign leaders.

John Swinney claimed he is willing to use his channels of communication with the incoming president to prevent blows to Scotland’s exports, insisting Mr Trump has “affinity and warmth” for Scotland. Mr Swinney backed Kamala Harris to win the presidency, something which the Republican’s son Eric Trump criticised during a visit to Scotland. The First Minister was asked about relations with the new US administration as he appeared on BBC Scotland’s Sunday Show. He insisted Mr Trump was “very warm and positive” on the call and spoke of his enthusiasm for Scotland, where he has family roots and owns two golf courses. The First Minister said: “He talked warmly about his mum’s roots in Lewis. “He talked about his pride in the business interests that he’s taking forward at Turnberry and at Balmedie – the golf courses. “So he’s got an affinity and a warmth towards Scotland. “And if that means that it helps us to avoid tariffs that might be damaging to legitimate and important, critical economic interests in Scotland, then don’t be surprised if this First Minister in Scotland uses that channel (to Mr Trump) to try to secure that outcome.” During his campaign, Mr Trump repeatedly promised to impose a blanket 20 per cent tariff on all imports into the US, and a 60 per cent tax on imports from China. Analysis suggested that if he followed through with the plans, it could cost the UK £22 billion. Tariffs on whisky, a vital Scottish export, were not discussed as Mr Swinney said he did not want to go into that detail without knowing the President’s precise plans. In the same interview, Mr Swinney also rejected claims made by former SNP first minister Nicola Sturgeon that independence is “off the radar now”, claiming his focus was on making it an “overwhelmingly popular concept in Scotland”. He said: “No, I don’t think it is. I think what, if we talk in this interview about the economic circumstances that we face, I think it’s pretty clear that economic management in the UK and economic opportunity is deeply flawed and deeply weakened because of the folly of Brexit. “Now the way to sort Brexit is for Scotland to become an independent country and re-join the European Union, that will open up economic opportunities for our country. “It will, crucially, allow us to have our approach to migration which will actually be in our economic interests other than the folly that’s been pursued by the UK Government.” The First Minister also expressed concerns at the “storm clouds” ahead, and admitted there was a lot of “uncertainty” about the future. He said: “There are storm clouds ahead for us. The economic outlook for the United Kingdom is troubling, there's a lot of uncertainty in terms of international conflict in Ukraine and in the Middle East, and there is obviously the emergence of the Trump presidency and that will bring with it what it brings. “So there is a lot of uncertainty but crucially what we must do is look carefully at all of that information, all of those situations and make the wisest judgements we can.” Mr Swinney also explained his renewed passion for leading the country, and why he wants to remain as First Minister until at least 2031. He said: “I came to the conclusion in 2023 that I'd done my bit and I should make way for others. Things have obviously got a bit difficult for my party and the government. I had the benefit of a restful year after I stood down, I’m now explaining this as my sabbatical year. I didn’t plan it like this, but that’s what it turned out to be. It gave me a chance to rest and reflect on the issues that we face. When this situation suddenly emerged in 2024 and my party said to me, ‘we need you to come in and lead and stand for First Minister’, I wasn’t planning for it, but I’m relishing it, I’m loving being First Minister, and I’m loving serving the people of Scotland.” Responding to his interview, Scottish Labour Deputy Leader Jackie Baillie claimed it was “clearer than ever that John Swinney and the SNP have no real vision for Scotland’s future”. She said: “From the state of public services to the ferry fiasco to the financial chaos the SNP has created, John Swinney is in denial about the scale of the challenges we face and out of ideas on how to fix them. “Every single institution in Scotland has been left weaker by almost 18 years of SNP government, and John Swinney has been at the heart of this failing government throughout. “The only way to deliver the change in direction Scotland so badly needs is by electing a Scottish Labour government in 2026.” Shadow cabinet secretary for finance and local government Craig Hoy accused the First Minister of pushing “failed policies”. He said: “Scots will respond to John Swinney’s bid to cling on to office with anger and dismay. The First Minister is peddling the same failed policies and continuing to push the SNP’s divisive independence agenda. “His responses to questions about his dire budget showed that he still has no idea how to deliver growth or repair the damage his government has done to our public services. He’s promising a new start but offering nothing but the same high-tax agenda, wasteful spending and left-wing policies. “The First Minister rightly criticised the Labour government’s tax on jobs, but the SNP has done immense damage to Scottish businesses by imposing endless red tape and failing to pass on rates relief. His suggestion that the UK government should follow his example and increase income tax speaks volumes about the SNP’s economic illiteracy. “Only the Scottish Conservatives are offering the common sense solutions – cutting taxes on hardworking households and businesses and calling a halt to wasteful spending to protect services.”","summary":"The incoming president has threatened a blanket 20 per cent tariff on all imports into the US","url":"https://www.scotsman.com/news/politics/first-minister-donald-trump-tariff-talks-4940158","image":"https://www.scotsman.com/jpim-static/image/2025/01/05/17/12/GettyImages-542980378.jpeg?width=1200&enable=upscale","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-01-12 15:45:41","author":"Alexander Brown","authors":["Alexander Brown"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":0.115},{"id":280047590,"title":"Tougher US sanctions to curb Russian oil supply to China and India","text":"NEW DELHI/SINGAPORE: Chinese and Indian refiners will source more oil from the Middle East, Africa and the Americas, boosting prices and freight costs, as new U.S. sanctions on Russian producers and ships curb supplies to Moscow’s top customers, traders and analysts said.\n\nThe U.S. Treasury on Friday imposed sanctions on Russian oil producers Gazprom Neft and Surgutneftegas, as well as 183 vessels that have shipped Russian oil, targeting the revenues Moscow has used to fund its war with Ukraine.\n\nMany of the tankers have been used to ship oil to India and China as western sanctions and a price cap imposed by the Group of Seven countries in 2022 shifted trade in Russian oil from Europe to Asia. Some tankers have also shipped oil from Iran, which is also under sanctions.\n\nRussian oil exports will be hurt severely by the new sanctions, which will force Chinese independent refiners to cut refining output going forward, two Chinese trade sources said.\n\nThe sources declined to be named as they are not authorised to speak to media.\n\nPRL denies reports of importing Russian crude at discounted rates\n\nAmong the newly sanctioned ships, 143 are oil tankers that handled more than 530 million barrels of Russian crude last year, about 42% of the country’s total seaborne crude exports, Kpler’s lead freight analyst Matt Wright said in a note.\n\nOf these, about 300 million barrels was shipped to China while the bulk of the remainder went to India, he added.\n\n“These sanctions will significantly reduce the fleet of ships available to deliver crude from Russia in the short term, pushing freight rates higher,” Wright said.\n\nA Singapore-based trader said the designated tankers shipped close to 900,000 bpd of Russian crude to China over the past 12 months.\n\n“It’s going to drop off a cliff,” he added.\n\nFor the first 11 months last year, India’s Russian crude imports rose 4.5% on year to 1.764 million bpd, or 36% of India’s total imports. China’s volume, including pipeline supply, was up 2% at 99.09 million metric tons (2.159 million bpd), or 20% of its total imports, over the same period.\n\nChina’s imports are mostly Russian ESPO Blend crude, sold above the price cap, while India buys mostly Urals oil.\n\nVortexa analyst Emma Li said Russian ESPO Blend crude exports would be halted if the sanctions were strictly enforced, but it would depend on whether U.S. President-elect Donald Trump lifted the embargo and also whether China acknowledged the sanctions.\n\nAlternatives\n\nThe new sanctions will push China and India back into the compliant oil market to seek more supply from the Middle East, Africa and the Americas, the sources said.\n\nSpot prices for Middle East, Africa and Brazilian grades have already risen in recent months on rising demand from China and India as supplies of Russian and Iranian oil tightened and became more expensive, they added.\n\n“Already, prices are rising for Middle Eastern grades,” said an Indian oil refining official.\n\n“There is no option than that we have to go for Middle Eastern oil. Perhaps we may have to go for U.S. oil as well.”\n\nA second Indian refining source said the sanctions on Russian oil insurers will prompt Russia to price its crude below $60 a barrel so Moscow can continue to use Western insurance and tankers.\n\nHarry Tchilinguirian, head of research at Onyx Capital Group said: “Indian refiners, the main takers of Russian crude, are unlikely to wait around to find out and will be scrambling to find alternatives in Middle Eastern and Dated-Brent related Atlantic Basin crude.\n\n“Strength in the Dubai benchmark can only rise from here as we are likely to see aggressive bidding for February loading cargoes of the likes of Oman or Murban, leading to a tighter Brent/Dubai spread,” he added.\n\nLast month, the Biden administration designated more ships dealing with Iranian crude ahead of tougher action expected from the incoming Trump administration, leading the Shandong Port Group to ban sanctioned tankers from calling into its ports in the eastern Chinese province.\n\nAs a result, China, the main buyer of Iranian crude, will also turn to heavier Middle Eastern oil and most likely will maximise its offtake of Canadian crude from the Trans-Mountain pipeline (TMX), Tchilinguirian said.","summary":"NEW DELHI/SINGAPORE: Chinese and Indian refiners will source more oil from the Middle East, Africa and the Americas, boosting prices and freight costs, as new U.S. sanctions on Russian producers and ships curb supplies to Moscow’s top customers, traders and analysts said.\n\n\nThe U.S. Treasury on Friday imposed sanctions on Russian oil producers Gazprom Neft and Surgutneftegas, as well as 183 vessels that have shipped Russian oil, targeting the revenues Moscow has used to fund its war with Ukraine.\n\n\nMany of the tankers have been used to ship oil to India and China as western sanctions and a price cap imposed by the Group of Seven countries in 2022 shifted trade in Russian oil from Europe to Asia.

Oil is Russia’s most important source of revenue, accounting for more than a third of the federal budget.\n\nThe new measures target Gazprom Neft and Surgutneftegas, Russia’s second- and fourth-largest oil producers, as well as 183 vessels transporting Russian oil and oil products to foreign markets. The Biden administration also sanctioned “opaque” traders of Russian oil, more than 30 Russia-based oilfield service providers, and more than a dozen leading Russian energy officials and executives.\n\n\"These measures will collectively drain billions of dollars per month from the Kremlin's war chest and, in doing so, intensify the costs and risks for Moscow to continue its senseless war,\" Daleep Singh, deputy national security adviser for international economics, said in a statement.\n\nBritain joined the United States in sanctioning the two oil companies, which combined produce more than 1 million barrels a day. Their majority-owned subsidiaries, such as Gazprom Neft's Serbian unit NIS, also come under the sanctions.\n\n“Putin is in tough shape right now, and I think it’s really important that he not have any breathing room to continue to do the god-awful things he continued to do,” Biden told reporters at the White House.\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said he spoke with Biden by phone and thanked him for his \"unwavering support\" of Ukraine's independence and for the \"vital role the United States has played in uniting the international community.\"\n\nEarlier in a statement on X, he thanked the United States and Britain for the new measures, saying he expected them to cut income for the Kremlin.\n\n\"The less revenue Russia earns from oil and other energy resources, the sooner peace will be restored,\" he said.\n\nThe latest measures are meant to complement sanctions previously slapped on Russia's energy sector.\n\nIn December 2022, the United States and Europe imposed a price cap of $60 a barrel on Russian oil sold with the use of Western ships and insurance.\n\nThe novel measure aimed to trim Kremlin revenues while also keeping Russian oil flowing to global markets to avoid a price spike at a time of surging global inflation.\n\nWestern firms dominated the oil transportation industry, pushing Russia to scoop up hundreds of tankers to circumvent the sanctions.\n\nWithin two years, Russia had more than 300 vessels in its \"shadow fleet\" transporting oil mainly to India, China, and Turkey at prices exceeding the cap.\n\nAs a result, Russia has continued to reap hundreds of billions of dollars in energy revenue despite the sanctions. Ukrainian officials and Western supporters of Kyiv had been urging the Biden administration for months to impose greater measures on Russia's oil industry and tighten and enforcement.\n\nIn the statement, Singh defended the decision to move ahead with additional energy sanctions now, just 10 days before the Biden administration leaves office, saying oil supply is forecast to exceed demand this year.\n\nSome experts have said that Biden was holding back on tougher sanctions against Russia until after the November 5 U.S. presidential election lest they hurt his party's chances of winning. Rising prices for many goods, including energy, were a major issue during the campaign. Biden’s Democratic Party lost the presidency and both chambers of Congress.\n\nFollowing the announcement of the latest sanctions, oil prices jumped more than 3 percent to their highest since October amid concern they could curtail Russian supply. Russia is currently the largest exporter of oil and oil products, shipping more than 6.5 million barrels to global markets a day.\n\nLNG Project Targeted\n\nThe sanctions announced on January 10 also target a major liquefied natural gas (LNG) project in Russia’s Arctic, those involved in Russia's metals and mining sectors, and senior officials from Rosatom, the state-owned builder of civilian nuclear power plants.\n\nSingh said the new sanctions are intended to strengthen Ukraine’s hand in any negotiations that take place to end the war.\n\nRepublican President-elect Donald Trump has said he wants to start negotiations to end the war soon after he takes office on January 20 but has not given any details on timing.\n\nA senior Biden administration official declined to say whether the incoming Trump administration supported the latest round of sanctions. However, the official said a number of Republican members of Congress had called on the Treasury Department to impose the type of sanctions included in the January 10 announcement.\n\nChris Weafer, a Russia energy expert and founder of Macro-Advisory, said the impact of the latest round of sanctions will depend on whether China, India, and Turkey observe them. Russia sells its oil to those countries at a discount to global prices.\n\n\"Despite this escalation in sanctions, it is not clear that they will work. It entirely depends on those countries. Will they give up cheap Russian oil in order to buy more expensive oil from someone else? They haven't done it thus far,\" he told RFE/RL.\n\nNonetheless, he said sanctions are now at their \"most dangerous level\" for the Russian economy since the Kremlin launched the invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.\n\nThe latest sanctions come on the heels of stinging measures imposed by the United States on Russia's financial sector.\n\nIn late November, the Biden administration designated Gazprombank, one of Russia’s largest lenders, and more than 50 other financial institutions, further cutting the country off from U.S. financial markets and increasing pressures on the economy. Those measures forced the Russian Central Bank to significantly weaken the currency.\n\nWeafer said Trump could use the latest measures on the energy industry as leverage to get Russian President Vladimir Putin to the negotiating table.\n\n\"Nobody in Moscow is going to panic over these sanctions just yet because the U.S. administration is about to change. They are a further complication but no one is going to push any panic buttons until after they hear what Trump has to say,\" Weafer said.\n\nOne of the officials on the call said the measures, combined with previous sanctions, “provide the next administration a considerable boost to their and Ukraine's leverage in brokering a just and doable peace.”","summary":"Thousands of people rallied in the Romanian capital, Bucharest, on January 12 to protest the December annulment of the presidential election in which right-wing, pro-Russian candidate Calin Georgescu won the first round.","url":"https://www.rferl.org/a/romania-protests-calin-georgescu-presidential-election/33273091.html","image":"https://gdb.rferl.org/85E95F61-B95D-47F2-A145-1C5DA2A48C04_w1080_h608.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-01-12 15:30:29","author":"Rfe/rl's Romanian Service","authors":["Rfe/rl's Romanian Service"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.088},{"id":280046650,"title":"The FBI Director | Sunday on 60 Minutes","text":"The FBI Director | Sunday on 60 Minutes\n As FBI director Christopher Wray prepares to step down before President-elect Donald Trump takes office, Scott Pelley speaks with him for his only broadcast exit interview. 60 Minutes, Sunday.","summary":"As FBI director Christopher Wray prepares to step down before President-elect Donald Trump takes office, Scott Pelley speaks with him for his only broadcast exit interview. 60 Minutes, Sunday.","url":"https://www.cbsnews.com/video/the-fbi-director-sunday-on-60-minutes/","image":"https://assets1.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2025/01/12/40300644-2383-4728-9662-6733b0cc8170/thumbnail/1200x630/a562abd827c17ec9f610fbf2b48fa483/fbi-director-exit-interview-1-3461467-640x360.jpg?v=c32e88638f4c371ec40100fff0bc2158","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-01-12 15:29:09","author":null,"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.242},{"id":280046652,"title":"Secretary of State Antony Blinken on America's role in the world","text":"No easy stroll to the exit for Antony Blinken. With exactly eight days left as secretary of state, he's only just concluded what is likely his last trip back-and-forth across the globe, with meetings in Seoul, Tokyo, Paris and, finally, Rome.Blinken has traveled more than a million miles on the job. \"Every minute, every hour, every day of the time that we have left, we're focused on getting results,\" he said. \"Sunday Morning\" flew with him in early December – three trips ago – from Washington to Brussels for the most recent NATO foreign ministers meeting. The main topic of discussion was Russian aggression in Ukraine. \"We have a new NATO strategic concept,\" said Blinken. \"It recognizes Russia as the most direct threat to the alliance.\" But there was a lot of well-wishing going on as well. Blinken stood right in the middle of the so-called \"family photo,\" and also photo-bombed a portrait of all the women foreign ministers. Mark Rutte of the Netherlands, the secretary-general of NATO, told Blinken, \"You have been a staunch ally, and people like you very much.\"All this ceremonial show & tell might be seen as subtle messaging to the incoming Trump administration about the value of nurturing alliance – the \"stronger together\" argument. Blinken said, \"The instruction I got from President Biden on Day One was, get in there, rejuvenate, re-energize, and even re-imagine our alliances and partnerships.\"Here was one more chance for Blinken to hold up the Biden administration foreign policy report card … and his own. He explained, \"If the United States is not engaged, if we're not leading, then probably either someone else is (and probably not in a way that reflects our interests and our values), or maybe just as bad, no one is. What we've done over the last four years is, we've re-engaged.\"As for Ukraine, he told the press in Brussels, \"All told, the U.S. has provided $102 billion in assistance to Ukraine, our allies and partners $158 billion. This may be the best example of burden-sharing that I've seen in the 32 years that I've been doing this.\"President-elect Trump wants to end Russia's war with Ukraine, critics fear not to Ukraine's advantage. Ever the diplomat, Blinken won't say he's trying to Trump-proof the potential outcome. \"For any of us to really speculate at this point, I don't think makes a lot of sense,\" Blinken said. \"What does make sense is to make sure that we give the next administration, we give the incoming Trump administration, the strongest possible hand for it to play around the world, whether it's on Ukraine or anything else.\"Sixty-two years old, Antony Blinken was practically born to be secretary of state. His father, financier and philanthropist Donald Blinken, served as ambassador to Hungary. His stepfather, international lawyer and humanitarian Samuel Pisar, was a Holocaust survivor from Poland. \"He was on a death march out of the camps, and he and some friends managed to escape the death march itself, hid out in the Bavarian woods,\" Blinken said. \"They saw a tank with a five-pointed white star. And the hatch opened up, and a very large African American GI looked down at him, and he got down on his knees and said the only words that he knew in English that his mother had taught him before the war: 'God bless America.' And the GI lifted him into the tank, into freedom, into the United States. Those are the stories that I grew up hearing, and it made me feel that there was something special about our country.\" Blinken grew up in Paris. He went to Harvard, Columbia Law School, and in 1993, during President Clinton's first term, began his diplomatic career at the State Department. During one administration after another, Blinken was always in \"the room where it happens.\" There he was (right, background) in the famous picture when President Obama took out Osama bin Laden. Blinken was national security advisor to then-Vice President Joe Biden. The two are exceptionally close. \"One of the things that's been an immense privilege is to have the kind of relationship where he would seek my counsel,\" said Blinken, \"and I always felt with him the ability to speak my mind.\"It was reported in Bob Woodward's recent book, \"War,\" that after President Biden's shaky debate performance last July, Blinken met with the president and asked him to consider whether he \"wanted to be doing this another four years?\"... adding, \"I don't want to see your legacy jeopardized.\" Blinken and Biden's legacies are inevitably linked, for better or worse. Blinken has defended the chaotic U.S. pull-out from Afghanistan on their watch, reminding the world that the first Trump administration made a deal with the Taliban, forcing the withdrawal.On their rocky relationship with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu over the devastation of Gaza, in response to the October 7, 2023 Hamas attack on Israel, and the appearance that Netanyahu is not respecting the role that the United States is trying to play (and has helped to finance) in its support of Israel, that calls to protect and feed people have been ignored, Blinken said this: \"The quickest way, the most effective way to get people what they need is actually through what we've been trying to achieve for many months now, and that's a ceasefire, with the hostages coming home, massive assistance going in.\"Even this late in the game, Blinken is hoping a deal can be reached before Inauguration Day. But if not? He said, \"When that agreement is reached, it will be on the basis of what President Biden put forward.\" And who will get the credit? \"You know, ultimately, it doesn't matter,\" Blinken said. \"What really matters is whether the United States can bring real change, real change to people's lives.\" He still sounds idealistic. There's something a bit square about Antony Blinken. After all, he's the guy who promoted music diplomacy by performing the Muddy Waters blues standard, \"Hoochie Coochie Man,\" in a suit and tie: What will he do now? He's vague on that. As he left NATO headquarters for the last time as secretary of state, I asked, \"You can't not have strong feelings knowing that you're leaving this building?\"\"Sure,\" Blinken said. \"Look, there'll always be a moment. Someone says something to you, there's some generous recognition, and for about 30 seconds you feel that. You take it to heart. But then, it's back to work. That really is my focus. Now, talk to me on January 21.\" WATCH: Secretary of State Blinken on America's role in Syria (Web Extra) For more info:Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken Story produced by Ed Forgotson.

The local currency had weakened further during the holiday period, reaching a selling rate of 3,707 earlier in the week.\n\nThe shilling’s recovery was largely attributed to increased diaspora remittances and a reduction in the demand for dollars over the festive season. As businesses closed for the holidays and the flow of imports slowed, the demand for US dollars weakened.\n\nRahmah Masagazi, Head of Sales – Global Markets at Absa Bank Uganda, noted that this demand initially came from the energy sector at the start of the week, and later shifted to the manufacturing sector, as remittances from the diaspora slowed down.\n\nAt the beginning of the week, the shilling was trading at 3,680/3,690 at commercial banks, but the heightened dollar demand saw it rise to 3,707/3,717 levels midweek. Experts pointed out that while diaspora remittances and agricultural commodity exports traditionally help stabilize the shilling, the low supply of dollars was overshadowed by the persistent demand.\n\nOutlook for the Shilling\n\nDespite the stabilization, Masagazi warned of potential pressure on the shilling in the short term as businesses resumed operations after the end-of-year break. It is anticipated that trading levels will fluctuate between 3,675 and 3,730 as the corporate sector begins to demand more dollars for imports and other business activities.\nIn a move to manage liquidity and stabilize the economy, the Bank of Uganda conducted a Treasury Bond auction during the week. The auction was highly successful, with a total of 791.17 billion shillings accepted, accounting for 80% of the amount offered.\n\nThe yields on the bonds increased across the board, with the two-year bond yielding 16.0%, up from 15.75% in the previous auction; the five-year bond yielded 16.75%, up from 16.0%; and the 15-year bond returned 17.5%, up from 16.75%. The increase in yields reflects rising interest rates and an attempt to control inflationary pressures.\n\nOn the global stage, the Euro remained stable against the US dollar at 1.03 on Friday for the third consecutive day. However, the Euro has been under significant pressure for the past four months, primarily due to geopolitical risks and the diverging economic policies between the US and Europe. The swearing-in of US President-elect Donald Trump has added further uncertainty, as his stance on economic policy and tariffs could have far-reaching implications for global markets. The US dollar has been bolstered by expectations that the Federal Reserve may further raise interest rates, strengthening the dollar against other currencies.\n\nAs the US administration signals possible trade protectionism, with the imposition of new tariffs on imports, there is growing concern over inflationary pressures within the US economy. This could lead to new data that might prompt further interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve in the medium term.\nThe British pound was also under pressure, losing 0.97% against the US dollar over the week, reaching its weakest point since November 2023. The pound’s weakness was driven by concerns over the UK government’s ability to manage its fiscal deficit amid rising borrowing costs. Additionally, the imposition of stricter sanctions on Russia and Iran has contributed to global oil price pressures, which could have knock-on effects on oil-importing countries like Uganda.\n\nOil Prices and Regional Economic Concerns\nOil prices reached a three-month high, driven by a contraction in US crude stockpiles and tightening supplies from Russia and Iran due to sanctions. Brent crude, a benchmark for global oil prices, was trading around $78 per barrel, representing an increase of over 5% in January. The rising oil prices are of particular concern to Uganda, a net oil importer, as they could exacerbate inflationary pressures and increase the cost of living.\n\nMasagazi highlighted that the stricter sanctions on Russian and Iranian crude have prompted refiners in China and India to seek alternative supplies from the Middle East, further tightening global oil markets. For Uganda, higher oil prices could mean increased costs for fuel and energy, which would have a direct impact on both the consumer and business sectors.\n\nIn East Africa, the Uganda-Kenya shilling market remained relatively stable. The Kenyan shilling traded at 28.55 against the Uganda shilling, maintaining steady levels despite global pressures on currencies and commodities.\n\nAs Uganda’s economy navigates global market forces, the local currency has shown signs of stabilizing against the US dollar, though experts anticipate continued fluctuations in the short term. The combination of seasonal trends, business resumption after the holiday period, and global economic factors such as oil prices and geopolitical tensions are likely to influence the shilling’s performance in the coming months.\n\nDo you have a story in your community or an opinion to share with us: Email us at editorial@watchdoguganda.com","summary":"The Uganda shilling showed signs of stabilization against the US dollar at the close of the week, with the Bank of Uganda quoting the exchange rate at 3,695.05 buying and 3,705.05 selling on Friday.

He often clapped and made other big gesticulations as he answered questions. \n\nHe signaled that he didn’t know why all three water storage tanks in the Pacific Palisades – each holding about 1 million gallons – had run dry right as the fires began last week.\n\n‘Was it pipes? Was it electricity? It was a combination of pipes, electricities, and pumps,’ Newsom told NBC News correspondent Jacob Soboroff as he rocked back and forth and threw up his hands. ‘Was that drawdown impossible because you lost seven-plus thousand structures right here anyway and every single structure we lost had a pipe that was leaking, and we would’ve lost that water pressure anyway?’\n\n‘Did it contribute in any way to our inability to fight the fire? Or were 99 mile-an-hour winds determinative and there was really no firefight that could’ve been more meaningful?’\n\nOne person reacting to the interview on X picked up on the governor’s restless movements and said: ‘Who the hell is he dancing with?’\n\nAnother said: ‘Watching Gavin Newsome (sic) his body language and speech suggests he is overwhelmed.’\n\n‘At the beginning of his interview, the first thing he does is start waving his fingers,’ a third pointed out.\n\n‘His physical gestures are over the top and distracting,’ another watcher thought.\n\nOne person shifted their anger to Soboroff, the interviewer, and claimed he wasn’t pushing Newsom hard enough. \n\n‘If you had an ounce of integrity or shame @jacobsoboroff, you’d resign for this obsequious joke of an interview & give your job to the woman who cornered Newsom in the street with real Qs after her community burned down,’ they wrote.\n\nThe interview covered topics such as Newsom’s culpability in the crisis, President-elect Donald Trump’s criticisms of the state’s wildfire response and new executive orders the governor is pursuing to provide relief to Californians. \n\nNewsom denied he was playing the blame game by opening an independent investigation into why the reservoirs were empty.\n\n‘How could it be when we’re doing an independent investigation and we just want the adjudication of the facts? As I say, it’s not about finger pointing. It’s about answering the questions you and everybody want answered,’ he said.\n\n‘The same ones you’re asking. Same ones that people out on the streets are asking, yelling about, “What the hell happened? What happened to the water system?”‘ \n\nAs of Sunday morning, the Palisades Wildfire, west of downtown Los Angeles, has grown to about 23,654 acres with containment at 11 percent. \n\nThe blaze leveled homes, businesses and structures in the Pacific Palisades right across to the Pacific Coast Highway near Malibu. It is believed five people have died as a result of this fire.\n\nThe Eaton Fire, which broke out Tuesday northeast of Los Angeles, currently spans 14,005 acres with containment at 15 percent. It has been estimated that this fire has destroyed 7,000 structures and is responsible for the deaths of 8 people.\n\nIn total, 16 people have lost their lives and more than 12,000 structures have burnt to the ground.\n\nNewsom put the death toll at a more conservative 13 and said his office is still getting information from coroners, adding ‘I’ve got search and rescue teams out.’\n\n‘And there’s likely to be a lot more.’\n\nWhen asked if the buck stops with him, Newsom replied: ‘I mean, you’re governor of California. It might as well be the mayor of California. We’re all in this together. We’re all better off when we’re all better off.\n\n‘And we’re here not just in the immediacy of the crisis, but we’re here after the crisis, as opposed to creating a crisis in the middle of this by trying to divide people and play political, take cheap political shots.’\n\nThe conversation soon shifted to President-elect Donald Trump, who has blamed Newsom for the wildfires.\n\nTrump said that the governor, who he referred to as ‘Gavin Newscum’ – a favorite of the Republican’s pet names – refused to accept preemptive help from the federal government back when he was president.\n\n‘Governor Gavin Newscum refused to sign the water restoration declaration put before him that would have allowed millions of gallons of water, from excess rain and snow melt from the North, to flow daily into many parts of California, including the areas that are currently burning in a virtually apocalyptic way,’ Trump wrote on Truth Social.\n\nTrump also argued that Newsom’s efforts to protect a fish called the Delta smelt has stopped water from being delivered to farmers and major cities.\n\n‘I don’t know what he’s referring to when he talks about the Delta smelt in reservoirs. The reservoirs are completely full, the state reservoirs here in Southern California,’ Newsom said.\n\nHowever, DailyMail.com revealed that a reservoir that served the Palisades area was left disconnected by Department of Water and Power (LADWP) CEO Janisse Quiñones. \n\nOn top of that, fire hydrants usually fed by that water source, the Santa Ynez Reservoir, were broken for months before the fires, leading to firefighters running out of water as they battled the devastating blazes.\n\nThe reservoir was also taken offline in recent months to repair a tear in its cover that exposed the water and potentially impacted its drinkability.\n\nThe shutdown, which left the 117-million-gallon water storage complex completely empty, was first reported by the LA Times on Friday morning.\n\nWhen confronted about this, Newsom said it ‘was not a state system reservoir.’\n\nTo address the damage caused to people’s homes and buildings around the city, Newsom announced he’d be issuing executive orders on ‘price gouging’ and ‘recovery.’\n\nHe also said the executive orders will help people get their insurance claims ‘within the next few weeks.’\n\nWhen it comes to rebuilding, Newsom signaled he’d be relaxing the rigid environmental review processes that often make development difficult in California.\n\n‘We want to fast-track by eliminating any [California Environmental Quality Act] requirements. I’ve got Coastal Act changes that we’re making. I want to make sure when someone rebuilds that they have their old property tax assessments and that they’re not increased,’ he said.\n\nNewsom also thanked President Joe Biden for pledging to cover 100 percent of disaster related costs in California for the next 180 days. Early estimates suggest damages could cost as much as $150 billion.\n\n‘We had support from the President of the United States, Joe Biden, with 100% reimbursement, all the resources you could hope for, imagine, constant communication. I’d like to extend that to the president-elect,’ he said.","summary":"Governor Gavin Newsom was slammed for his &#8216;over-the-top&#8217; body language in an&#8230;","url":"https://internewscast.com/news/us/analysis-criticism-mounts-as-gavin-newsom-faces-backlash-for-contentious-interview-deflecting-responsibility-for-wildfires-in-los-angeles/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/rewrite-this-title-Gavin-Newsom-is-slammed-for-car-crash-800x430.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-01-12 15:14:08","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.487},{"id":280047554,"title":"'Dangerous And Strong' Winds Threaten To Spread LA Inferno","text":"US officials warned \"dangerous and strong\" winds were set to push deadly wildfires further through Los Angeles residential areas Sunday as firefighters struggled to make progress against the flames.At least 16 people have been confirmed dead from blazes that have ripped through the city, reducing whole neighborhoods to ashes and leaving thousands without homes.Despite massive efforts, including precision sorties from aerial crews, the Palisades Fire continued to grow, spreading east towards the priceless collections of the Getty Center art museum and north to the densely populated San Fernando Valley.\"The winds are potentially getting dangerous and strong again,\" Deanne Criswell, head of the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), told CNN.\"The biggest thing that people need to know is that this is still dangerous.\"A brief lull in the wind gave way to gusts that forecasters warned could reach up to 50 miles per hour (80 kilometers per hour) early Sunday, and feed the blazes for days to come.The winds were due to weaken later Sunday before picking up again overnight, the National Weather Service said.The Palisades Fire was 11 percent contained but had grown to 23,600 acres (9,500 hectares), while the Eaton Fire was at 14,000 acres and 15 percent contained.Official figures show more than 12,000 structures burned, though Cal Fire's Todd Hopkins said not all were houses and the number included outbuildings, trailers and sheds.In some areas, the ferocious fire left streaks of molten metal flowing from burnt-out cars.The sudden rush of evacuated people needing somewhere to live posed a growing problem for the city.\"I'm back on the market with tens of thousands of people,\" said a man who gave his name as Brian, whose rent-controlled apartment has burned. \"That doesn't bode well.\"With incidences of looting and a nighttime curfew in place, police and National Guard mounted checkpoints to prevent people getting into the disaster zones.Two people were arrested near Vice President Kamala Harris's Brentwood house for violating the curfew order after police received reports of burglary.A handwritten sign with \"looters will be shot\" was hung on one tree, next to the US flag outside a house in Pacific Palisades.But the security checkpoints have left residents frustrated as they queue for up to 10 hours to try to get back in and see what, if anything, is left of their homes or check on family.Prevented from entering an evacuation zone, Altadena resident Bobby Salman, 42, said: \"I have to be there to protect my family, my wife, my kids, my mom and I cannot even go and see them.\"The queues left some people fuming about poor management, the latest gripe from a population already angry over hydrants that ran dry in the initial firefight.City officials have put on a united front after reports of a behind-the-scenes row between the mayor and the fire chief.But President-elect Donald Trump accused California officials of incompetence.\"This is one of the worst catastrophes in the history of our Country.

Sala, who was believed held as a bargaining chip for Abedini’s release, returned home last week, giving rise to speculation about his fate. \n\nAn official note released by the Justice Ministry on Sunday said that under Italy-U.S. extradition treaties, “only crimes that are punishable according to the laws of both sides can lead to extradition, a condition which, based on the state of documents, can’t be considered as existing.”\n\nThe ministry said that the potential charge against Abedini — criminal association for violating the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, a U.S. federal law — “did not correspond to any conduct recognized by Italian law as a crime.”\n\nThe U.S. Justice Department has accused Abedini of supplying the drone technology to Iran that was used in a January 2024 attack on a U.S. outpost in Jordan that killed three American troops.\n\nItalian Premier Giorgia Meloni described a “diplomatic triangulation” with Iran and the United States as being key to securing Sala’s release, confirming for the first time that Washington’s interests in the case entered into the negotiations.\n\nSala’s release came after Meloni made a surprise trip to Florida to meet U.S. President-elect Donald Trump at his Mar-a-Lago estate.\n\n— Nasser Karimi in Tehran contributed to this report.","summary":"Italy’s justice minister seeks to revoke the arrest of an Iranian based on a US warrant  The Associated Press","url":"https://apnews.com/article/italy-iran-arrest-abedini-us-sala-b13f97d133becca587ba3490e09ecda1","image":"https://dims.apnews.com/dims4/default/8430e29/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3800x2138+0+198/resize/1440x810!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fassets.apnews.com%2Fc4%2Ff0%2Fb035d7ec033b01bac7c4a2194ef5%2Fa2b08c36030347a39efc04b9b8de931c","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-01-12 15:10:00","author":"Giada Zampano","authors":["Giada Zampano"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.306},{"id":280043462,"title":"Steve Bannon goes berserk on Elon Musk, vows to drive him away from White House: ‘He is a truly evil guy’","text":"Days after fawning over what tech magnate Elon Musk’s deep pockets could do for the MAGA movement, Steve Bannon went berserk on the world’s richest man and vowed to limit his White House influence.\n\nBannon, 71, who hosts the “War Room” podcast and has a penchant for plotting all-out brass-knuckled political warfare, suggested Musk “should go back to South Africa” and decried his stance on H1-B visas.\n\n“I will have Elon Musk run out of here by Inauguration Day,” Bannon, told the Italian daily Corriere della Sera last week, per excerpts translated by his former employer Breitbart. “He will not have a blue pass to the White House, he will not have full access to the White House, he will be like any other person.”\n\n“He is a truly evil guy, a very bad guy. I made it my personal thing to take this guy down,” he went on. “Before, because he put money in, I was prepared to tolerate it. I’m not prepared to tolerate it anymore.”\n\nLast month, just before Christmas, a war erupted within the MAGA movement between the tech bros and immigration hardliners over H1-B visas, which permit foreign workers to come to the US for specialty occupations. \n\nMusk, 53, a US citizen who emigrated from South Africa, emerged as a fierce defender of H1-B visas. President-elect Donald Trump, 78, eventually backed Musk’s stance and the tech billionaire. But Bannon hasn’t let the H1-B visa flap go. \n\n“This thing of the H-1B visas, it’s about the entire immigration system is gamed by the tech overlords, they use it to their advantage, the people are furious,” Bannon told the outlet\n\nBannon also unleashed on other big-name billionaire Trump backers.\n\n“Peter Thiel, David Sacks, Elon Musk, are all white South Africans,” he added. “He should go back to South Africa. Why do we have South Africans, the most racist people on earth, white South Africans, we have them making any comments at all on what goes on in the United States?”\n\nBillionaire entrepreneur Peter Thiel, is German-American but lived in South Africa and Namibia as a child.\n\nHe had worked with Musk on PayPal, had been a top backer of Vice President-elect JD Vance’s Ohio Senate bid in 2022. \n\nMusk has espoused increasingly conservative viewpoints in the public eye since the COVID-19 pandemic. In the GOP primaries, he backed alternatives to Trump, including Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis (R). However, after the July 13 assassination attempt, Musk began going all in on the president-elect. \n\nSince Trump’s election victory, Musk has spent a large chunk of his time hunkered down at Mar-a-Lago. Trump has tapped him to helm the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), which isn’t actually a government department. \n\nDemocrats have attempted to poke at both Musk’s and Trump’s egos and pit the two against each other. Last month, when Musk whipped up public opposition to a government funding bill in Congress, Democrats branded him “President Musk,” though Trump has so far declined to take the bait. \n\nBannon complained that Musk’s “sole objective is to become a trillionaire.” Bannon has previously called for more taxes on the wealthy and warned about a French Revolution-style uprising in the US over the growing disparities between the mega-rich and the poor. \n\n“[Musk] will do anything to make sure that any one of his companies is protected or has a better deal or he makes more money,” Bannon further groused. “His aggregation of wealth, and then — through wealth — power: that’s what he’s focused on.”\n\nBannon also took a jab at Musk for appearing to concur with a post on X that suggested Americans are too “retarded” to do the jobs that companies use foreigners via the H1-B visa system. Musk later deleted that post. \n\n“He went out of his way to mock our movement as racist and retards, and he lost,” Bannon complained. “We blew him out of the water.”\n\nBefore Musk got behind Trump, Bannon had lashed out at the Tesla and SpaceX for not being critical of China. Musk has waded heavily into US and European politics, but largely eschewed mention of China, where he has factories and a massive Tesla sales business.\n\nJust last week, however, Bannon argued that despite their differences, Musk joining the MAGA movement could be an important boon and took note of the billionaire’s efforts to wade into European politics.\n\n“I support his participation because the enemy of my enemy is my friend,” Bannon told Bloomberg. “Musk just spent a quarter of a billion dollars to elect Trump.”\n\n“If he puts the same amount of money into all of Europe that he put behind Trump, he will flip every nation to a populist agenda. There’s not a centrist left-wing government in Europe that will be able to withstand that onslaught.”","summary":"“I will have Elon Musk run out of here by Inauguration Day,” Bannon reportedly told an Italian newspaper.","url":"https://nypost.com/2025/01/12/us-news/steve-bannon-goes-berserk-on-elon-musk-vows-to-drive-him-away-from-white-house/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/01/96593289.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-01-12 15:07:47","author":"Ryan King","authors":["Ryan King"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.031},{"id":280046076,"title":"Tougher US sanctions to curb Russian oil supply to China and India: analysts","text":"WASHINGTON: Chinese and Indian refiners will source more oil from the Middle East, Africa and the Americas, boosting prices and freight costs, as new US sanctions on Russian producers and ships curb supplies to Moscow’s top customers, traders and analysts said.\n\nThe US Treasury on Friday imposed sanctions on Russian oil producers Gazprom Neft and Surgutneftegas, as well as 183 vessels that have shipped Russian oil, targeting the revenues Moscow has used to fund its war with Ukraine.\n\nMany of the tankers have been used to ship oil to India and China as western sanctions and a price cap imposed by the Group of Seven countries in 2022 shifted trade in Russian oil from Europe to Asia. Some tankers have also shipped oil from Iran, which is also under sanctions.\n\nRussian oil exports will be hurt severely by the new sanctions, which will force Chinese independent refiners to cut refining output going forward, two Chinese trade sources said. The sources declined to be named as they are not authorised to speak to media.\n\nAmong the newly sanctioned ships, 143 are oil tankers that handled more than 530 million barrels of Russian crude last year, about 42 per cent of the country’s total seaborne crude exports, Kpler’s lead freight analyst Matt Wright said in a note.\n\nOf these, about 300m barrels was shipped to China while the bulk of the remainder went to India, he added.\n\n“These sanctions will significantly reduce the fleet of ships available to deliver crude from Russia in the short term, pushing freight rates higher,” Wright said.\n\nA Singapore-based trader said the designated tankers shipped close to 900,000 bpd of Russian crude to China over the past 12 months.\n\n“It’s going to drop off a cliff,” he added.\n\nFor the first 11 months last year, India’s Russian crude imports rose 4.5pc on year to 1.764m bpd, or 36pc of India’s total imports. China’s volume, including pipeline supply, was up 2pc at 99.09m metric tonnes (2.159m bpd), or 20pc of its total imports, over the same period.\n\nChina’s imports are mostly Russian ESPO Blend crude, sold above the price cap, while India buys mostly Urals oil.\n\nVortexa analyst Emma Li said Russian ESPO Blend crude exports would be halted if the sanctions were strictly enforced, but it would depend on whether US President-elect Donald Trump lifted the embargo and also whether China acknowledged the sanctions.\n\nAlternatives\n\nThe new sanctions will push China and India back into the compliant oil market to seek more supply from the Middle East, Africa and the Americas, the sources said.\n\nSpot prices for Middle East, Africa and Brazilian grades have already risen in recent months on rising demand from China and India as supplies of Russian and Iranian oil tightened and became more expensive, they added.\n\n“Already, prices are rising for Middle Eastern grades,” said an Indian oil refining official.\n\n“There is no option than that we have to go for Middle Eastern oil. Perhaps we may have to go for US oil as well.”\n\nA second Indian refining source said the sanctions on Russian oil insurers will prompt Russia to price its crude below $60 a barrel so Moscow can continue to use Western insurance and tankers.\n\nHarry Tchilinguirian, head of research at Onyx Capital Group said: “Indian refiners, the main takers of Russian crude, are unlikely to wait around to find out and will be scrambling to find alternatives in Middle Eastern and Dated-Brent related Atlantic Basin crude.\n\n“Strength in the Dubai benchmark can only rise from here as we are likely to see aggressive bidding for February loading cargoes of the likes of Oman or Murban, leading to a tighter Brent/Dubai spread,” he added.\n\nLast month, the Biden administration designated more ships dealing with Iranian crude ahead of tougher action expected from the incoming Trump administration, leading the Shandong Port Group to ban sanctioned tankers from calling into its ports in the eastern Chinese province.\n\nAs a result, China, the main buyer of Iranian crude, will also turn to heavier Middle Eastern oil and most likely will maximise its offtake of Canadian crude from the Trans-Mountain pipeline (TMX), Tchilinguirian said.","summary":"WASHINGTON: Chinese and Indian refiners will source more oil from the Middle East, Africa and the Americas, boosting prices and freight costs, as new US sanctions on Russian producers and ships curb supplies to Moscow’s top customers, traders and analysts said.

At least as far as the stock market is concerned. Wall Street concluded an already softer week with a thud Friday after the December jobs report came in much hotter than expected. The S & P 500 lost 1.54% in the session and 1.94% for the week. The Nasdaq Composite and the Dow Jones Industrial Average, meanwhile, also fell sharply Friday and ended the week down 2.34% and 1.86%, respectively. The jobs report sent bond yields spiking , as investors reconsidered the likelihood of additional Federal Reserve interest cuts this year if the U.S. economy is as strong as the December employment data suggests. \"When I see this number, what I say to myself is ... would you prefer earnings to be good? Because this is an earnings-are-good [report],\" Jim Cramer said Friday. \"Or would you prefer rate cuts? Any time I can get earnings to be good, I vastly prefer that to rate cuts, because rate cuts don't necessarily translate into [earnings per share].\" The conventional wisdom on Wall Street is that higher interest rates are bad for equities , at least initially, because it changes a key input into valuation models for individual stocks and makes bonds relatively more attractive as an investment. Understanding this dynamic, it's no surprise that traders reacted to the jobs report the way they did Friday. But, as fundamentals-focused investors at the Club, our calculus is different. \"What's really bad for stocks is unemployment, is a recession. These [jobs] numbers are so far away from recession, the only thing I can conclude is that the Fed got it wrong\" in cutting rates again in December, Jim argued, referring to the Fed's third reduction since September. \"But that doesn't mean, necessarily, that CEOs are going to get it wrong, that businesses are going to get it wrong,\" he continued. \"We do not have a number that is going to wipe out companies. We have a number that is going to keep this economy afloat, no matter what the Fed does.\" We made a trade into Friday's weaker market, adding to our position in Home Depot for the first time since Dec. 19. It capped off a busy week of moves — seven trade alert stories about six stocks — despite having one fewer day of trading on Thursday, when the U.S. market was closed in observance of former President Jimmy Carter's state funeral in Washington. Our week of trades Monday, Jan. 6 Bought 25 shares of Goldman Sachs Sold 150 shares of Nextracker Tuesday, Jan. 7 Bought 82 shares of Goldman Sachs and exited our stake in Morgan Stanley Sold 150 shares of Nextracker Wednesday, Jan. 8 Sold 150 shares of Palo Alto Networks Bought 25 shares of BlackRock Friday, Jan. 10 Bought 25 shares of Home Depot Among the lowlights in recent days was Constellation Brands' quarterly earnings report Friday, which sent shares sliding 17% in the session and firmly entrenched the stock as our worst-performing name for the week. We downgraded the stock to a 3 rating , meaning sell into strength. Nvidia also was near the bottom of the weekly scoreboard, losing almost 6%, despite closing at a record high Monday ahead of CEO Jensen Huang's keynote address at the annual CES conference. We loved what we heard from Huang on Nvidia's long-term AI strategy and were unmoved the market's sour short-term reaction. On the other hand, Texas-based driller Coterra Energy was our No. 1 performer, adding 5.8% amid a strong week for natural gas and oil futures , the two commodities that most influence its stock price. Recently disappointing GE Healthcare , which caught an upgrade to buy from hold at Jefferies on Wednesday, was hot on Coterra's heels, adding 5.3% in its best week since February of last year. It's going to be a busy week ahead for both economic and corporate data. The influential JPMorgan Healthcare Conference also takes place in San Francisco. Jim will be in attendance. In the early part of the week, we'll hear from executives at GE Healthcare and fellow portfolio holdings Danaher , Eli Lilly and Bristol Myers Squibb . Economy The big event is Wednesday morning's consumer price index for December, which gives investors a critical look at inflationary pressures in the U.S. economy. Wall Street expects to see a 2.9% year-over-year increase and a 0.3% month-over-month rise , according to estimates compiled by Dow Jones. Excluding volatile food and energy prices, so-called core CPI is expected to be up 3.3% annually and 0.2% on a monthly basis. The December producer price index is due out a day earlier, on Tuesday morning, providing an update on wholesale inflation. The CPI gets more attention because it captures the prices that U.S. shoppers are being asked to pay, but the PPI has its role, too. It's seen as a leading indicator for future CPI reports because it measures various input costs for businesses, offering clues on whether they will need to raise prices in the future protect their profit margins. As of Friday, economists expect a 0.3% month-over-month increase in both the headline and core PPI, according to Dow Jones. With Friday's jobs report forcing investors to rethink expectations on future Fed cuts, the PPI and CPI reports may be even more pivotal than usual. Hotter-than-projected inflation data could, at least in the short term, solidify a more hawkish central bank. Among the secondary economic reports are the Commerce Department's monthly look at retail sales on Thursday morning, which are expected to be up 0.4%, and the Fed's update on industrial production and capacity utilization before the bell Friday. The retail data will add to our understanding of U.S. consumer behavior during the key holiday shopping period, while the Fed's report will provide insight into production at factories, mines and utilities. Industrial production is projected to rise 0.3% while capacity utilization is forecast to be 77%, according to the Dow Jones consensus. On Friday morning, the Commerce Department also will release its report on new residential construction in December, known as housing starts. With housing inflation remaining sticky, this data is important because it reflects new homes that will eventually be on the market to address the mismatch between supply and demand in many parts of the U.S. Economists expect housing starts of 1.32 million, according to Dow Jones. Earnings A trio of portfolio companies are set to report fourth-quarter results in the week ahead — all on Wednesday morning. We'll hear from Wells Fargo , Goldman Sachs and BlackRock , as financials typically make up the first wave of companies reporting each earnings season. Goldman and BlackRock will be reporting for the first time as portfolio stocks. A potential common topic across all three conference calls is the regulatory environment under President-elect Donald Trump . The incoming administration is widely to pursue a more hands-off approach toward the financial industry, which is one reason why bank stocks were such strong performers in the wake of the Nov. 5 election. Some of those gains have been given back amid the broader market retreat since early December. Still, the KBW Bank Index is up 3.3% since the election while the S & P 500 is up less than 1% after Friday's sell-off. The regulatory shift hopefully means that the Federal Reserve will soon lift the asset cap on Wells Fargo, which has been in place for almost seven years and stymied the bank's growth throughout that time. On Wednesday's earnings call, analysts will likely ask CEO Charlie Scharf for his latest expectations on the removal of the unprecedented penalty handed down in response to scandals under previous leadership. With Trump in the White House, the Department of Justice and Federal Trade Commission also are anticipated to be less aggressive on antitrust enforcement than the Biden administration — a good thing for mergers and acquisitions activity. While we're already seeing a pickup in dealmaking, Goldman Sachs CEO David Solomon should provide additional color on where the investment banking giant expects it to go from here. The impending M & A wave is why we took a stake in Goldman last month, believing it's better positioned to benefit than now-former Club name Morgan Stanley because investment banking represents a bigger share of its revenue pie. Wells Fargo has been building up its business in this area , though it's still a much smaller player than Goldman. Once the asset cap is gone, Wells Fargo should be able to invest even more in this growth priority. Analysts expect Wells Fargo to report earnings of $1.35 per share on revenues of $20.59 billion for the three months ended Dec. 31, according to LSEG. Wells Fargo's guidance on net interest income — the difference between what it makes on loans and what it pays on deposits — and corporate expenses also will be important. For Goldman Sachs , the current Wall Street consensus is fourth-quarter revenue of $12.25 billion and earnings per share of $8.17, according to LSEG. When Goldman reported in October, analysts asked Chief Executive Solomon about his plan to improve the bank's return on equity to at least 15% on a more regular basis, as well as the competitive landscape for its trading business. As mentioned, the M & A environment figures to be a major focus of Goldman's earnings call this time around. BlackRock is expected to report quarterly revenue of $5.52 billion and earnings per share of $11.22, LSEG data shows. Below those headline numbers, net inflows is a key metric to watch for BlackRock, the world's largest asset manager. BlackRock ended the third quarter with a record $11.48 trillion in assets under management, up from $10.65 trillion in the April-to-June period. The more assets that BlackRock gathers, the more fees that it can generate. From there, staying disciplined on costs helps translate to improved bottom-line performance. On the call, we'll be listening to CEO Larry Fink's commentary on the integration of Global Infrastructure Partners after that acquisition closed Oct. 1 . BlackRock's roughly $12 billion deal to buy HPS Investment Partners — announced last month as part of a push into the hot private credit market — is likely to be a topic of discussion. We're upbeat on the move and cited it in our decision to add to our BlackRock position on Wednesday.

For the second time, the US president-elect publicly proclaimed the need for a takeover of the sparsely populated 830,000 square mile island. The Orange Manbaby believes the autonomous Danish territory is vital to the economic and military security of the US – and he refused to rule out taking the land mass, which is mostly covered in ice, by force. Perhaps the first scout of a full scale invasion was Donald Trump Jnr, who landed in capital city Nuuk shortly after his father's land grabbing declaration. Chief of the MAGA welcoming committee in the 20,000-strong town was Jorgen Boassen, a broad bricklayer and loyal Trump supporter. The 50-year-old Greenlander previously rubbed shoulders with Nigel Farage when he was invited to Trump's election victory party in Mar-a-Lago. Upon his arrival at Nuuk International Airport, a group of 15 red MAGA hat-clad Trump supporters rushed to embrace Donald jnr. Speaking to journalists, Mr Boassen threw cold water over the idea of an invasion. He said: \"You know Trump. It's best to take everything he says with a pinch of salt. Trump always does tricks like this to make people overreact. \"Then he can see who is his friend and who is his enemy\". Instead of fighting America taking over his island, Mr Boassen would welcome the foreign superpower because, in his view, they are better placed to defend the territory from China and Russia than their Danish rulers. He said: \"East Greenland is very close to Russia, and if something happens to either Russia or China here, we only have Danish soldiers patrolling with dog sleds. \"Russia has noticed this, and that Greenland is far away from Denmark. If Russia wants to provoke Denmark, we could be the victims of that.\" In what might well be an attempt to bring Greenlanders over to his side of thinking, convicted felon Trump waved wads of US dollars in their face. He said: \"75% of Greenlanders live in some form of poverty, and by the end of the month they are always out of money. \"Greenland has enormous natural resources, oil, natural gas and rare earths. Denmark's resources are not enough to exploit them. We need a good deal with the United States.\" Greenlander Karen Kielsen, who earns a crust as a cleaning assistant, told CNN: \"Everything is just getting more and more expensive here. Goods from Denmark are extremely expensive, so of course the USA seems more attractive.\" Student Imaakka Boassen added: \"I don't completely trust the Danes. Maybe I would have more trust in Trump. There are so many Danes in leading positions in Greenland, but when we live in Greenland, it should be Greenlanders who lead.\" However, boffin with University of Greenland Ebbe Volquardsen said it was \"absolutely not the case\" that there was a fully-fledged MAGA movement in Greenland and that any support was limited to \"a few individuals\". In response to the Orange Manbaby's sabre rattling, Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen said: “Greenland is not for sale and will not be in the future either.” It’s not the first time Frederiksen has had to rebuke the Republican - in 2019 she was also forced to slap down Trump’s Arctic aspirations. “On one hand, I am pleased regarding the rise in American interest in Greenland,” Frederiksen said, speaking with Danish broadcaster TV 2. “But of course it is important that it takes place in a way where it is the Greenlanders’ decision, what their future holds.” However, Greenland Prime Mute Eged said at the start of the year that he wanted Greenland to be independent from Denmark. \"It is about time that we ourselves take a step and shape our future, also with regard to who we will cooperate closely with, and who our trading partners will be,\" Mr Egede said.
