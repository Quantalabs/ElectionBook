Not even 48 hours after word got out a 43-foot-tall nude effigy of Donald Trump hung suspended from a construction crane, the indecent artwork was gone. But for most of Saturday and Sunday, a mile or two off Interstate 15, a few hundred yards from the always-bustling Love’s Travel Stop just north of Sin City, the statue had people stopping and staring. But the trickle of spectators — just 27.5 miles from the towering Trump International Hotel on the Las Vegas Strip — leering at the lewd likeness of the former president couldn’t rival the thousands of supporters Trump commands in person at political stops. Although it was hung well near a busy north-south highway connecting Las Vegas to Salt Lake City and points north, the figure was not easily seen from the roadway. That’s probably a good thing since the uncensored effigy had the potential to stop traffic and even cause accidents. That’s because the statue was what some would call “anatomically correct,” displaying the unknown artist’s concept of the very public billionaire’s private parts. The Trump image here materialized as smaller but equally graphic effigies of the 45th president are springing up in cities across the country, from New York’s Union Square to Los Angeles, Cleveland, Seattle and San Francisco. It’s unknown if the different projects are unrelated or part of a sleazy series. But the Nevada version of Trump had a much more authentic-looking face than the closer-to-life-size naked Trumps an anarchist collective took credit for. TMZ reported the image is not supposed to be flattering. Citing sources “with direct knowledge” of the artwork’s creation, the online outlet said the piece is titled “Crooked and Obscene,” a reference to both the sculpture and its subject. There’s no visible identification of who placed the hanging artwork there, and public records indicate a trust registered in Las Vegas owns the eight-acre parcel where the crane is parked. The Post did not hear back from the Nevada Democratic Party for comment. The Nevada GOP slammed the pop-up as an “offensive marionette, designed intentionally for shock value rather than meaningful dialogue.” “While Democrats, especially Kamala Harris, continue to prioritize shock value over substance. President Trump is the only candidate in this race standing up for working men and women across Nevada,” the party added. Onlookers gawped and took selfies as cars drove up, parked and spent a few minutes ogling the naked spectacle. “I think it’s a funny, comical gesture for the up-and-coming election,” Nathan Oubre, 32, a gas-industry worker, told The Post. “Normally, you don’t see things like this, but it just gives a sign of laughter to the world seeing a big, huge statue of Donald Trump naked.” Although he is “working in the gas industry, and I’m a big supporter of it,” the Louisiana native wouldn’t say which candidate will get his vote come November. “My biggest take on the election is vote for whatever you believe in,” Oubre said. Alex Lannin, a 53-year-old special-education teacher in Las Vegas, brought Spirit Airlines flight attendant Honey Hunter, 27, of Spokane, Wash., to view the piece. “I would say [it’s] very creative, like a piece of artwork, you know,” Hunter said. She said she was not a Trump supporter and wouldn’t vote for the mogul. Lannin, who also said he’s not a Trump supporter, said he was “a little worried about him getting a sunburn, but other than that, I love it.” Real-estate professional Clem Zeroli, 25, brought his girlfriend Tommi Alexander, 24, to pose together for a selfie at the site. But this pair wasn’t purely positive on the artwork. “It’s not very respectful,” Zeroli said, “but I think it’s kind of funny. Any publicity is good publicity.” Alexander, who works for her family’s Sin City swimming-pool business, said that while she felt compelled to see the piece in person, it won’t change her support for Trump this fall. “As a daughter of business owners, there’s many reasons for us to want him as our president, but we were doing much better under Trump,” she said. “We support a lot of employees, and our business has been doing very badly the past two years,” adding they’ve likely been the worst in the firm’s 30-year history. Fifteen-year-old Anthony Sears, a student at Las Vegas’ Shadow Ridge High School, isn’t old enough to vote but wanted to see a piece of art that’s “not something you see every day.” The high schooler said he “doesn’t really follow politics” and couldn’t say who he’d vote for this year if he could cast a ballot.","summary":"LAS VEGAS — Call it the pop-up that didn’t stay up.

Ohio’s U.S. Sen. JD Vance, the Republican, and Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, the Democratic candidate, are scheduled to square off at CBS Broadcast Center in New York City at 9 p.m. Just like the debate already held between former President Donald Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris — and the one before that between Trump and President Joe Biden — this debate will go forward without a studio audience. But unlike the Trump Harris debate, both candidates’ microphones will remain unmuted while the other is speaking. Harris’ campaign had requested live mics during her meeting with the 45th President, but Trump demurred and insisted on sticking to the rules that Biden laid out in the debate challenge he issued before he dropped out of the race. Moderators Norah O’Donnell and Margaret Brennan will have the ability to mute the microphones, according to their network, but it will be up to the candidates to fact check each other while maintaining decorum. The candidates are not expected to give opening statements and will argue for 90 minutes, with two four-minute breaks scheduled. Walz, as the candidate representing the incumbent party, is scheduled to speak first, according to CBS. Candidates will have two minutes to answer questions — which the network says they will not receive in advance — and a minute for rebuttals. Neither will be allowed to interact with campaign staff during the debate or breaks, and are only permitted access to a notepad, a pen, and a bottle of water. The debate is scheduled to end with two-minute closing statements. After the debate was scheduled, CBS apparently flipped a coin which Vance called correctly. He elected to speak after Walz, meaning he will get the last word. Vance’s final thoughts may be the last time any voter sees these candidates or their running mates on a stage alongside their opponents. After the first presidential debate, CNN indicated it would be willing to host a second contest. Harris accepted, but Trump declined. Tuesday’s debate will be broadcast on CBS, CNN, FOX, MSNBC, NBC, PBS, and Telemundo and will be available on multiple streaming platforms.","summary":"Ohio’s U.S. Sen.

It’s a warm June evening and the place feels like the Platinum Room at Guitar Center, with the walls covered in blond wood and baroque blue wallpaper. It’s his own mini dad-rock mecca. There’s the “engagement guitar” his wife got him after he joked that if she was getting an engagement ring, he wanted another six-string. A phalanx of Gibson hollow bodies and Les Paul Juniors hangs proudly near a custom-made Collings with a paw print on the headstock and a fur-black finish. (It’s named Murray after the family dog, a schnauzer-poodle mix.) And the crown jewel: a lightly modified 1960 sunburst Stratocaster. There are dozens of guitar pedals, vintage tweed Fender amps scattered all over, and a few keyboards and synthesizers tucked under a center table. At least a dozen more guitars are hidden away in closets in the back of the room. Kanter, 51, is a longtime collector and music obsessive who spends his free time recording original songs, a hobby since high school. He studied electronic music while majoring in political science at SUNY Albany in the Nineties and calls himself “a child of New Wave music,” citing Depeche Mode and the Cure as his favorites. He’s also the Joe Biden-appointed assistant attorney general heading up the antitrust division of the Department of Justice. The next morning, Kanter will don a sharp suit and head to the Robert F. Kennedy Building in Washington, D.C., where his team of approximately two dozen attorneys is preparing for trial in one of the most significant antitrust cases in decades: a blockbuster lawsuit that could result in a breakup of the live-music behemoth Live Nation-Ticketmaster. The suit marks one of the first times the DOJ has sought to split up a major corporation since it brought a case against Microsoft in the late 1990s. The DOJ filed its lawsuit against Live Nation in May, alongside 30 attorneys general from red and blue states, accusing the company of operating as a monopoly. (Ten more states joined in August.) Kanter’s antitrust division has taken on giants like Apple and Google — winning a landmark case against the latter over its internet-search dominance — but he says nothing they’ve done has elicited a reaction among consumers and lawmakers alike quite like this. “When we talk to family farmers concerned about meat-packers and processors, we hear the same sort of urgency. Same with health care,” Kanter tells Rolling Stone. “But people love music, and a monopolist is getting in the way of their ability to access it and making their lives more expensive.” The complaint comes at what feels like a peak moment of fan frustration over the concert-going experience. While seeing the biggest artists live has been something of a splurge for decades (see the viral clip of Kurt Cobain reacting with disgust to learn Madonna was charging $50 a ticket in 1993), today it can cost as much as a month’s rent for the priciest tickets — and that’s if you even get through the byzantine purchase process.For the most in-demand shows, seasoned fans know what to expect: Cross your fingers days in advance, hoping to get a Ticketmaster verified fan code that merely gives you the right to wait in a hellish online queue. Assuming technical difficulties from the high traffic don’t kick you out of line or crash the site altogether (condolences if you tried and failed to buy Oasis tickets in August), by the time you reach the lobby, you have to brace for sticker shock. Statistically speaking, the average ticket price for the world’s 10 highest-grossing concerts has risen 26 percent over the past five years, according to research from the trade publication Pollstar. (A ticket to see Drake in 2023, for example, cost $260 on average, up from $116 in 2018.) Combined with the insult of dynamic pricing — the business tactic that can hike the ticket price hundreds of dollars based on demand — and the sense that much of your money is going to surcharges and hidden fees, the rising costs have driven fans mad. (Fees added, on average, another 27 percent to a purchase, according to a 2018 study by the U.S. Government Accountability Office.) Those who get shut out during the official sale and turn to the secondary ticket market fare no better. Today’s scalpers use bots to game the system and charge double the face value, or more. Prices were so high to catch the U.S. leg of Taylor Swift’s Eras Tour in 2023, it was actually more affordable for some American fans to pay for tickets, airfare, and hotel combined to see the pop star in Paris — where scalping is much more regulated — rather than stateside. The cheapest seats Rolling Stone could find on StubHub for Swift’s Oct. 18 show in Miami were nearly $4,000 a pair, including fees. (Ticketmaster isn’t listing resold tickets for Swift’s shows.) When Bruce Springsteen used dynamic pricing for his tour last year, he faced significant criticism from fans who felt he’d abandoned them and his working-class roots. Though his own team said most of the tickets for that tour were below $200, some cost thousands of dollars. The anger was palpable, with fan magazine Backstreets shutting down as publisher Chris Phillips wrote they were “disillusioned” with the ticketing practice. Even artists lament the current state of the market. Last year, Zach Bryan announced he’d play mainly non-Ticketmaster venues for his Burn, Burn, Burn Tour. By September, he’d ended that battle, electing to play Ticketmaster venues for his Quittin’ Time Tour. “All my homies still do hate Ticketmaster but hard to realize one guy can’t change the whole system,” Bryan wrote on X. “It is intentionally broken and I’ll continue to feel absolutely horrible about the cost of tickets in an unfair market.” Not all of these problems are attributable to Live Nation and Ticketmaster, of course. The concert giant has joined indie promoters in calling for lawmakers to more stringently regulate the resale market, and much of the live-music industry supports measures requiring ticket sellers to list fees upfront rather than hide them. The company will also be all too happy to tell you that artists are the ones who set ticket prices. But there’s still a sense that this arm of the music industry is utterly dysfunctional — and that the DOJ’s case could be one big step toward fixing it. “There’s a lot of fans who understand music [is] more than commerce,” says Kevin Erickson, director of the music advocacy nonprofit The Future of Music Coalition, which has publicly called for a Live Nation breakup. “While it relies on having a business infrastructure to be able to operate, it runs deeper than that. It has hugely important personal meaning to so many music fans. The brazen ways that unaccountable private power has taken over live music might be common in other parts of the economy, [but it] reflects that music is special.” “We’re an Exceedingly Modestly Profitable Company” By the time I’m in Kanter’s home studio, it’s been about a month since the Justice Department announced its lawsuit against Live Nation, the culmination of an 18-month investigation into the company’s dominance over the live-music business. The suit paints the concert giant as a mob-like organization, complete with powerful “pimp” and “hammer” enforcers to stifle competitors, exclusivity deals that suffocate other ticketing companies, and threats of withholding artists from venues that dare try their luck with another ticketing provider. Live Nation is unquestionably the most powerful entity in the live-music business. Valued at $25 billion, the company owns and operates hundreds of venues around the world, including a majority of the largest amphitheaters in the U.S. Its promotion business alone pulled in $4.5 billion in the third quarter of 2024, more than twice as much as its next largest competitor, AEG Presents, according to Pollstar. It’s one of the largest music-management companies, representing 380 artists last year. And thanks to its 2010 merger with Ticketmaster — the exclusive ticketing partner for most of the arenas and stadiums in the United States — it is the largest primary ticketing provider in the industry. It has a foot in the secondary market as well, allowing brokers and scalpers to sell tickets for shows on Ticketmaster’s website. (Live Nation maintains the resale marketplace is a small part of its business.) Despite the fact that the DOJ itself approved that merger nearly 15 years ago (with some strings), it now views it as detrimental to the industry. “We are not here today because Live Nation-Ticketmaster’s conduct is inconvenient or frustrating,” Attorney General Merrick Garland said at a press conference in May. “We are here because … that conduct is anticompetitive and illegal. We allege that Live Nation has illegally monopolized markets across the live-concert industry in the United States for far too long. It is time to break it up.” The DOJ says, in part, that Live Nation is so big it can lure artists into touring contracts with huge payouts that smaller competitors can’t afford. In turn, they say, tickets are becoming more and more expensive as fans absorb the costs of those contracts in fees. Live Nation has vehemently denied the department’s claims, asserting that it only sees a modest amount of the total fees Ticketmaster charges. (Live Nation says venues take two-thirds of ticket fees to cover operation costs for concerts.) Dan Wall, Live Nation’s executive vice president of corporate and regulatory affairs, says the DOJ’s suit “ignores everything that is actually responsible for higher ticket prices,” such as high production costs, predatory scalping, and even musicians themselves. Speaking with Rolling Stone at Live Nation’s Beverly Hills headquarters, Wall emphasizes that it’s the artists who set ticket prices “fundamentally based on supply and demand.” He also maintains that the driving issue behind high ticket prices is scalpers who use sophisticated bots and dummy accounts to flood the primary market and secure tickets for the most in-demand shows, then gouge fans for those tickets on resale sites. A breakup of Live Nation, Wall says, won’t solve this problem. In a May post on its website rebutting the lawsuit, Live Nation presented data it says shows that its fee earnings and profit margins are far lower than comparable figures for service providers like Uber and tech giants like Meta. “The data conflicted too much with [the DOJ’s] preconception that Live Nation belongs in the ranks of the other ‘tech monopolists’ they have targeted,” Wall, who is also a lecturer on antitrust at University of California, Berkeley’s School of Law, wrote in the post. “At bottom, we are another casualty of this administration’s decision to turn over antitrust enforcement to a populist urge that simply rejects how antitrust law works.” “People love music, and a monopolist is getting in the way of their ability to access it and making their lives more expensive”Jonathan Kanter In Wall’s view, the live-music industry is functioning more or less as it should considering certain market realities. “There’s an ongoing natural experiment out in the world where there’s every combination you can think of — a different promoter, a different ticketing company, a Live Nation venue or non-Live Nation venue — and it doesn’t make any difference on the price of tickets,” Wall says. “J onathan Kanter is being extremely disingenuous in what he says to the American public about ticket prices.” Furthermore, Wall says, the Live Nation-Ticketmaster merger made live music a sustainable business given that, separately, both concert promotion and ticketing are historically low-margin businesses. “People think we’re this filthy-rich monopolist when we’re an exceedingly modestly profitable company,” he says. “It’s a good business, but the monopoly narrative has to be reconciled with this…. The irony of all this is that the biggest barrier to taking on Ticketmaster is probably because Ticketmaster doesn’t engage in monopolist pricing the way monopolies are supposed to.” Not everyone is buying Wall’s argument. As one live-music industry insider, who requested anonymity over fear of retaliation from Live Nation, says: “They point the finger everywhere except the mirror.” Fairly or not, pissed-off Swifties certainly blamed the company for the chaotic Eras Tour sale in 2022, which saw long online queues, technical difficulties, and sky-high prices. “Ticketmaster is a multi BILLION dollar company. They knew the demand for these tickets. They need better systems. Fans get let down time after time,” one furious fan tweeted the day tickets went on sale. “‘We put the fans first,’ no you don’t. If you did, you would have this issue solved by now after YEARS of things like this happening.” The situation became a PR disaster that brought the ticketing marketplace back to the national consciousness, as dozens of Swifties filed a class-action lawsuit against Live Nation-Ticketmaster. Though the case was later dismissed, the public outcry did inspire a Senate judiciary committee hearing in which lawmakers scrutinized Live Nation for hours (while making one too many Swift-inspired puns). Asked what he thinks spurred the DOJ’s investigation, Wall cites not the Swifties but complaints from competitors like SeatGeek and AEG. He further states that AEG’s statements on the matter should be taken “with a bucket of salt,” adding, “They’re trying to get what they can out of the legal process.” “While we are flattered that Live Nation believes that AEG can bend the United States Department of Justice to its will, that’s not how the legal system works,” AEG said in a statement. “Yes, Live Nation’s monopolistic business practices hurt AEG. But that’s not what the DOJ’s lawsuit is about. It’s about fostering greater competition for the benefit of artists and fans.” SeatGeek declined to comment for this article. But back when the DOJ first announced the lawsuit, the company said it was “hopeful that the Department of Justice’s antitrust lawsuit to break up the Live Nation-Ticketmaster monopoly will restore fair market competition to live entertainment.” Kanter and the DOJ decline to say if any specific incident spurred the investigation — though they assert that the Eras Tour fiasco did not play a role. Rather, they describe the probe and subsequent lawsuit as the culmination of “a steady stream of concerns coming from both industry and consumers” about Live Nation-Ticketmaster. “When I came in [as assistant attorney general], I asked [staff] about it, and the response I got was a very strong degree of concern that had accumulated over the course of many years,” Kanter says. “It was pushing on an open door.” “Until Recently, The Regulators … Haven’t Been Doing Their Jobs” Live Nation wasn’t always the dominant player in the promotion space. Until the late Nineties, a collection of regional promoters around the country, such as Bill Graham Presents in the Bay Area and Cellar Door Productions in Washington, D.C., had significant control over their respective markets. Then businessman Robert Sillerman started spending billions of dollars to acquire many of those smaller outfits and sold the resulting company to the radio conglomerate Clear Channel (now iHeartMedia) in 2000. Clear Channel spun off that business in 2005, establishing the promotion firm now known as Live Nation. From that point on, promotion was a national game — and Live Nation was the de facto concert leader. The company and the live-music industry grew in lockstep through the aughts; as record sales plummeted due to rampant piracy in the digital age, artists turned to touring to make up the losses. By the time Live Nation announced its merger with Ticketmaster in 2009, it had about $4.1 billion in revenue. The internet had other ripple effects. It opened a huge opportunity for ticket resale and scalping, as services like StubHub and Vivid Seats made it easier for brokers, scalpers, and casual ticket holders to resell their tickets online. It’s also made it much easier for fans to voice their frustration with the system and coalesce around their cause. Prior to that, artists had the biggest megaphone in the fight against Ticketmaster. Pearl Jam railed against the company’s service-fee policy way back in 1994, well before the Live Nation merger. The band even went so far as to file an antitrust complaint with the Justice Department. Testifying to Congress, guitarist Stone Gossard called the relationship between promoters and venues “incestuous” and decried “the lack of any national competition for Ticketmaster that has created the situation we’re dealing with today.” (The department closed the investigation the following year with no action.) “If Pearl Jam couldn’t do it,” Rolling Stone wrote in 1995, “who can?” Thirty years later, the DOJ’s lawsuit could finally be a first step toward lower prices. Still, music-industry experts like Erickson say breaking up Live Nation and Ticketmaster isn’t enough. Regulation of the secondary market is crucial to fixing the system, too. “Rampant, unregulated, deceptive, and predatory behavior by secondary sellers [have] added new and innovative forms of dysfunction on top of the existing dysfunction,” Erickson says. “Until recently, the regulators, policymakers, and enforcers who could’ve done something haven’t been doing their jobs. “Live Nation-Ticketmaster is allowed to make the rules and reshape the industry in ways that degrade the experience for fans,” Erickson adds, “and leave artists and venues with fewer options.” Getting industry stakeholders like artists, venue owners, and promoters to be vocal on these issues, however, has been challenging for Kanter’s team. “I’ve been getting a lot of positive feedback at a personal level, but it’s really quiet, and that’s consistent with the trouble we had getting people to speak up,” Tennessee Attorney General Jonathan Skrmetti tells Kanter on a call in June. “People recognize there’s a problem here, but nobody really wants to stick their head up. But at things like kids’ birthday parties, where [I see] a lot of folks in the industry, I get a lot of grateful feedback.” A DOJ source tells Rolling Stone the department reached out to “A-listers across every genre” who had issues with Ticketmaster in recent years to discuss the lawsuit publicly, but were told it was “too hot for them to weigh in.” (Rolling Stone contacted the 10 highest-grossing touring artists of last year for this story; all either declined to comment or did not respond.) “We Take Our Work Seriously, But Not Ourselves” Under Kanter, the antitrust team has brought a verve not seen in the division in years. The bespectacled, Queens-born attorney has a gravitational pull in his office as a high-energy leader who seldom sits still and has created an irreverent culture in the office. (Sen. Amy Klobuchar, a Minnesota Democrat, once described the Kanter-led department to Rolling Stone as “not your grandpa’s DOJ.”) The team refers to its main conference room — where visitors and investigation targets alike meet with the antitrust heads — as “hot sauce,” both a Beyoncé reference and a hint that this is their “situation room.” A bottle of Cholula rests pointedly atop a fireplace mantle there. The room next door is called “mild,” complete with an unopened jar of Tostitos mild salsa. “We take our work seriously, but not ourselves,” says Kanter — and several deputy assistant attorney generals at the antitrust department agree. “Is this typical for how the antitrust department has looked in the past?” I ask John Elias, one of the antitrust division’s deputy assistant attorney generals who’s worked there for over 15 years. “No, definitely not,” he says. Early in his tenure, Kanter had a custom hourglass made, timed to exactly six minutes, a nod to the increments in which the most elite law firms charge for their time. “Their clients like it,” Kanter says. “The lawyers, not so much.” A decal adorning the back of his iPhone features a red circle with a slash over the letters “DB”: It stands for “No Douchebags.” Kanter’s own office is similarly colorful. A Muppet version of Kanter wearing a Mike Wazowski hat from Monsters, Inc. sits right outside the lobby, while a small stuffed version of Kanter’s dog Murray (the antitrust department’s unofficial mascot) rests below, alongside a board game that reads “Anti-Monopoly.” Monopoly imagery is a common theme throughout the office, with about a half-dozen artworks of the board game or its iconic mustachioed mascot, Mr. Monopoly, on display, including in Kanter’s personal restroom. The bookcase behind his desk has several Monopoly pictures and figurines, along with photos of Murray, Kanter’s children, and Fiona, the hippo born prematurely at the Cincinnati Zoo & Botanical Gardens in 2017. On the top shelf is an unopened bottle of Yoo-hoo, a John Lennon figurine, and a Mets cap and bobblehead, all of which Kanter says are there “to remind me of my childhood.” Kanter started his career at the Federal Trade Commission in 1998, then went into private practice and represented companies like Microsoft and Yelp in their antitrust cases against fellow tech giant Google. Eventually, he grew disillusioned with the state of antitrust law, believing that the government had failed to protect its citizens from increasingly powerful tech juggernauts. “To me, the American dream is to own your own house and own your own business. That was the pathway to success,” Kanter says, sitting on a blue leather chair in his office. A Jerry Garcia Funko pop and Kanter’s Ukrainian-American grandfather’s certificate of naturalization sit on a coffee table nearby. “As I went through my career, I realized that what antitrust enforcement was supposed to help preserve — that opportunity — was not doing that, and, in fact, the system was an obstacle. “The power that big companies have can rival governments if not exceed them. That’s not freedom, that’s not opportunity,” he adds. “If you can’t build a business and succeed on your own merits … that’s not a market-based economy, that’s not capitalism. That’s exploitation.” “A Scalpel Rather Than a Sledgehammer” When Live Nation looked to merge with Ticketmaster in 2009, the company argued it was essential to stabilize two rocky businesses — ticketing and concert promotion. It also touted the merger as a lifeline to get artists paid at a time when their royalties were tanking. “The music-industry model that existed when I entered the business is irreparably broken,” Live Nation CEO Michael Rapino told a Senate hearing on the merger in 2009, also pointing toward the extreme growth of the scalping business. “In the old model, the record label supported the artist[s], record sales were the hub, and everything else — concerts, promotion, merchandising — flowed from that.… That model is as obsolete as an eight-track tape.” Rapino wasn’t wrong. Touring has become a much bigger moneymaker in an era where many artists complain of paltry royalty checks off of hundreds of thousands of streams. (One 2022 study from the American Economics Liberties Project, a nonpartisan, nonprofit think tank that has called for a Live Nation breakup, noted that touring makes up roughly 95 percent of a musician’s income.) For rising and mid-tier artists, touring expenses still make earning a living on the road difficult. Today, no one is writing bigger checks to touring artists than Live Nation. Competitors voiced their concerns quickly, arguing that Live Nation had already monopolized the promotion space more or less since its inception. But the DOJ allowed the merger anyway. Supposed safeguards were put into place, most notably a “consent decree” that said Live Nation couldn’t retaliate against other venues by withholding artists’ shows if they used another ticketing company. Christine Varney, the assistant attorney general who greenlit the merger, called the agreement “vigorous antitrust enforcement — only with a scalpel rather than a sledgehammer.” Varney added that the settlement “allowed us to secure a package of remedies that mitigated consumer harm while still allowing the parties to prove that together they could discount, innovate, or otherwise benefit the live-music industry and its fans.” Critics blasted the decision — and point to the current situation as evidence that their concerns were justified. David Balto, a longtime antitrust lawyer who worked at the DOJ in the Nineties, represented several of Live Nation’s competitors at the time. Balto fervently opposed the merger, testifying before a 2009 Senate Judiciary committee and meeting with the DOJ several times to warn about potential fallout for the industry. “There were clear competitive concerns, but this was a timid agency unwilling to test the limits of the law,” Balto says. “The paycheck of a staff attorney in the antitrust division says ‘trial attorney.’ Their job is to go to trial. Their job is not to interpret a consent decree and figure out how to regulate a market.” Nancy Prager, a lawyer who worked with antitrust attorneys in 2009 to block the merger, calls the anti-retaliation agreement “incredibly frustrating.” “The merger should never have been allowed to happen, and now, 14 years later, that error has been recognized,” Prager says. After speaking to the DOJ at the time, she says, she felt it was failing to properly consider all of the many businesses the combined company would oversee. “The Department of Justice failed in two ways. They really didn’t understand the industry they were working with,” she says. “And they didn’t understand the magnitude of the monopolies that were already in place. They just really missed it altogether.” “We are another casualty of this administration’s decision to turn over antitrust enforcement to a populist urge that simply rejects how antitrust law works.”Live Nation’s Dan Wall Balto and the live-music industry insider recall being summoned to the DOJ’s office soon after the merger confirmation. The insider remembers the Justice Department lawyers framing the consent decree as a key victory in stabilizing the market and staving off the industry’s concerns. “We all looked at each other in there just thinking, ‘This is bullshit,’” the insider says. The following few years weren’t any more comforting for Live Nation’s critics, who’ve only felt more strongly that the merger has warped the industry. The company faced a DOJ investigation in 2018 over retaliation allegations from several venues, settling the claims in 2020 and extending the consent decree to 2025. But retaliation allegations surface in the government’s new complaint as well. In the lawsuit, the DOJ points to one major venue ending a contract with SeatGeek to return to Ticketmaster, claiming Live Nation withheld shows at the venue. (Wall denies those claims, alleging that tech issues on SeatGeek’s platform led to the switch. The low number of retaliation claims the DOJ had cited since the consent decree started “has proven a very, very high degree of compliance, not of non-compliance,” he says.) Live Nation-Ticketmaster competitors say that even the potential for retaliation keeps venues from signing with other ticketers, which they say further proves the DOJ’s previous efforts at deterrence didn’t help. As one former ticketing executive who’d spoken with the DOJ during its investigation tells Rolling Stone, the company doesn’t need to spell out the pluses and minuses of going with Ticketmaster — in fact, they’re better off not being explicit, lest their business proposition be viewed as a threat. “Venues don’t have to be told [what would happen],” the former executive says. “Ticketmaster reps are probably told not to say [anything]. Many venues look at it as beneficial [to deal with them] knowing you’ll get more shows.” “There’s just no reason we should have had to settle for this,” says Erickson. “The only reason is that the people whose job it was [to regulate the industry] let themselves get blinded by this toxic faith in unregulated markets that ended up meaning the corporations have been making the rules.” “This Is Going to Be a Blip” Once an aggressive trust-busting force, the DOJ grew more conservative in the cases it pursued over the past 40 years, giving way to looser regulation and allowing the markets some autonomy. While the antitrust department is reportedly considering a breakup of Google, big swings like that are far from the norm. Throughout the 2000s, several current and former DOJ employees tell Rolling Stone, it was relatively unheard of for the antitrust division to challenge mergers at all. “You need[ed] clear and convincing evidence that a merger is going to produce bad results [like] higher prices, lower output, lower quality, and if you have any doubt about that, you’re better off not enforcing,” Bill Baer, the former assistant attorney general who took over just after the Live Nation merger, says over coffee in the cafeteria at the Brookings Institution, the public-policy nonprofit where he is now a visiting fellow. Another former DOJ lawyer familiar with the department’s 2018 Live Nation inquiry praised Varney for putting up any resistance to the merger at all. “She pushed for there to be relief at a time where these sorts of cases and challenges were not in vogue,” the executive, who requested anonymity, says. “People like to look back and be critical, but at the time, she was deemed aggressive for even pushing for the decree.” To Balto, Varney would’ve gone harder on Live Nation during those proceedings, but she was limited by a staff uncertain they could win. “The staff was like, ‘No we can’t do this, we’re going to lose,’” Balto adds. “But what’s the harm in losing?” Back then, regulators were optimistic that those consent decrees would protect the markets. However bullish Varney’s move was perceived to be at the time, today, all the antitrust attorneys Rolling Stone spoke with agree that the consent decree didn’t work as intended. “Live Nation subtly and increasingly not-so-subtly found ways to evade the commitments they’d made. That’s why my successor under Trump went after them,” Baer says. “Arguably, he should’ve sued for a breakup then because they already demonstrated you can’t trust them to honor their commitments.” “They cut off all the different vectors, and they all work together.”Jonathan Kanter Wall says he doesn’t expect the antitrust division’s hardened stance under Kanter to last when his tenure is done. “This is going to be a blip,” he says. “Antitrust has been one of the few areas of business regulation that has been marked by a fundamental bipartisan consensus on what the rules are and what the goals are. This group who’s in office right now is challenging that consensus, and when they’re gone, the consensus reestablishes itself.” (Asked about Wall’s claim, Kanter says that “the work that we’re doing is the current consensus.”) “There is a pattern here of wanting to bring big-impact monopoly cases against the companies that have platforms,” Wall continues. “There’s nothing in the four corners of this lawsuit that we couldn’t have potentially settled and compromised. Jonathan Kanter wanted nothing to do with settlement negotiations that were going to get in the way of filing this case.” In some ways, it feels like Kanter’s department is seeking to undo the very work his predecessors did over a decade ago when they allowed the merger to take place. Asked directly if he feels the DOJ made a mistake, Kanter is guarded. “You have to focus on what’s in front of you,” he says. “Our case isn’t about a merger; it’s about what happened after a merger.” Still, he says, “We take a clear-eyed look at the facts to determine if there’s a problem. And if there is a problem, we call it like we see it.” Does Kanter think anything short of an absolute Ticketmaster-Live Nation breakup will remedy the situation? “We were very clear in our lawsuit and in our statement around our lawsuit about what we think the proper remedy is,” he says. Meaning: A breakup is necessary. “We are not that direct in all of our cases.” “Abuse, Exploitation, and Self-Dealing” The DOJ’s investigation moved quickly. As Kanter and multiple other DOJ officials confirm, the team had already been several months into their investigation by the time the Eras Tour debacle unfolded in November 2022. Both he and his principal deputy assistant attorney general, Doha Mekki, say it had little impact on how they would handle the rest of their inquiry. “If you had seen what we’d already seen at that point, [the Eras Tour] did not strike me as any notable event in our investigation,” Mekki says. “Ticketmaster had its explanation for what happened. Obviously, there are times where demand outstrips supply. That’s just the way the market works. Our claim was about something different; [it was] about abuse, exploitation, and self-dealing.” Mekki is referencing Live Nation’s so-called “flywheel” model, a complex web of interconnected businesses under its control where the more profitable sectors, like ticketing and sponsorship from corporations and advertisers, subsidize its less profitable concert-promotion business. The DOJ asserts that that puts smaller competitors without multifaceted businesses at an unfair disadvantage. Wall calls that flywheel argument “all rhetoric.” He acknowledges that it’s much harder for competing companies to thrive without vertical integration — a strategy where companies have their hands in multiple aspects of a business, like, in Live Nation’s case, ticketing, promotion, and artist management — but adds that Live Nation’s largest competitors operate this way as well. “Everybody is vertically integrated in this industry, and that is because these pieces by themselves are not very profitable industries. You have to find the efficiencies of combining them to be a competitor.” The lawsuit says Live Nation has dominated the market through its exclusivity agreements with venues. Many venues happily sign the deal both for cash advances Ticketmaster will provide them and to avoid the headache of dealing with more than one ticketer at shows. But the DOJ alleges that the Ticketmaster exclusives are predatory. According to the department, the deals shut out competing ticketing companies for years as they wait for contracts to end so they can get in the ring. The DOJ also claims Live Nation colluded with the venue developer Oak View Group (OVG), which acted as a “pimp” and “hammer” enforcer to get more venues to use Ticketmaster. (Neither Oak View Group, co-founded by industry titan and former Ticketmaster chairman Irving Azoff, nor any of its executives are listed as defendants in the lawsuit. A rep for Oak View Group declined to comment.) The department filing includes emails between Live Nation CEO Rapino and another OVG co-founder in which Rapino reprimands OVG after the company put in an offer to promote an artist’s show, with Rapino claiming such an action would only cause the artist’s team to start asking for higher compensation. “What’s up?” Rapino wrote. “We have done his [touring] and vegas[.] Let’s make sure we don’t let [the artist agency] now start playing us off.” Further, the DOJ alleges that in at least one instance, Live Nation violated the 2010 consent decree by withholding shows from venues that use services other than Ticketmaster. “The longer the conduct goes on, and the more entrenched the company is, the more widespread the behavior,” Kanter says. By the fall of 2023, the DOJ believed it had enough evidence against Live Nation for a potential antitrust complaint. It just wasn’t sure how to present it in a lawsuit. Kanter says a flux capacitor helped officials reach their conclusion. In almost any other context, the device that helps Marty McFly and Doc Brown travel through time in Back to the Future is merely the stuff of science fiction: a Y-shaped light device attached in the back of a DeLorean. But at the DOJ, it’s real. Kind of. “Doc Brown says this is what makes time travel possible, but this is what makes monopolization cases possible,” Kanter says. In the antitrust division, “flux capacitor” means identifying changes that target the core of a monopoly rather than its symptoms. As I follow Kanter to several events in which he talks about antitrust in agriculture, artificial intelligence, or media, the philosophical through line is the same: A lack of competition in the marketplace will trickle down to the entire ecosystem around it, and stopping it requires more robust antitrust action. In the Live Nation case, the “flux capacitor” would mean targeting their “flywheel” and, as Kanter says, breaking up the company. “If you want the promoter, you have to use the ticketing. If you want access to the venue, you have to use the ticketing,” Kanter explains. “If you want access to the artist, you have to use the ticketing and the promoter. They cut off all the different vectors, and they all work together.” The flux-capacitor theory is so crucial to the DOJ’s work that Kanter keeps a printed-out image of the fictional device on his desk. To prove the point, he pulls two deputies into the office, one at a time, quizzing them quickly on what the flux capacitor is. Without missing a beat, both give virtually the same answer: more aggressive antitrust policy. This DOJ views monopolistic companies like an octopus, with many tentacles holding a vise grip over every aspect of a business it feeds on. Mekki and another executive within the antitrust division have octopus plush toys in their office to reinforce the metaphor. In an earlier era, they’d go after “the tentacles,” Kanter says. But, Mekki says, pointing at the octopus in the corner of her office, “If you cut off the tentacle, you’ve still got an octopus.” “They grow back,” Kanter interjects. “But if you go for the head … ” she says, not having to finish the sentence. There’s no certainty that the DOJ will prevail in its case, or that a divestment of Ticketmaster and Live Nation would drastically change the experience for consumers. Kanter and his team are also weeks away from an election that could find a new president cleaning house entirely. Such a move seems all but inevitable if Donald Trump wins, and it’s unclear if Kamala Harris would maintain the status quo with the Joe Biden appointee or install a new team. Still, Kanter and Mekki seem unperturbed, pointing to the bipartisan support this suit has drawn. “Ticketmaster is our attempt to say that in this industry … it’s not just about the venues. It’s not just about the promoter. It’s not just about workers. It all works together to basically take money from consumers, and often [take] away from artists, who the market should be rewarding,” Mekki says. “More of it gets sucked out in the middle, and it always comes up Live Nation.”","summary":"The Justice Department has accused the live-music behemoth of “abuse, exploitation, and self-dealing.” Live Nation says the DOJ is “being extremely disingenuous” about why the system is broken.

He was 83. Stephanie Wheatley, a spokesperson for Clark County in Nevada, confirmed on behalf of the medical examiner that Rose died Monday. Wheatley said his cause and manner of death had not yet been determined. For fans who came of age in the 1960s and ‘70s, no player was more exciting than the Cincinnati Reds’ No. 14, “Charlie Hustle,” the brash superstar with the shaggy hair, puggish nose and muscular forearms. At the dawn of artificial surfaces, divisional play and free agency, Rose was old school, a conscious throwback to baseball’s early days. Millions could never forget him crouched and scowling at the plate, running full speed to first even after drawing a walk, or sprinting for the next base and diving headfirst into the bag. A 17-time All-Star, the switch-hitting Rose played on three World Series winners. He was the National League MVP in 1973 and World Series MVP two years later. He holds the major league record for games played (3,562) and plate appearances (15,890) and the NL record for the longest hitting streak (44). He was the leadoff man for one of baseball’s most formidable lineups with the Reds’ championship teams of 1975 and 1976, with teammates that included Hall of Famers Johnny Bench, Tony Perez and Joe Morgan. But no milestone approached his 4,256 hits, breaking his hero Ty Cobb’s 4,191 and signifying his excellence no matter the notoriety which followed. It was a total so extraordinary that you could average 200 hits for 20 years and still come up short. Rose’s secret was consistency, and longevity. Over 24 seasons, all but six played entirely with the Reds, Rose had 200 hits or more 10 times, and more than 180 four other times. He batted .303 overall, even while switching from second base to outfield to third to first, and he led the league in hits seven times. “Every summer, three things are going to happen,” Rose liked to say, “the grass is going to get green, the weather is going to get hot, and Pete Rose is going to get 200 hits and bat .300.” Rose was Rookie of the Year in 1963, but he started off 0 for 12 with three walks and a hit by pitch before getting his first major league hit, an eighth-inning triple off Pittsburgh’s Bob Friend. It came in Cincinnati on April 13, 1963, the day before Rose’s 22nd birthday. He reached 1,000 in 1968, 2,000 just five years later and 3,000 just five years after that. He moved into second place, ahead of Hank Aaron, with hit No. 3,772, in 1982. No. 4,000 was off the Phillies’ Jerry Koosman in 1984, exactly 21 years to the day after his first hit. He caught up with Cobb on Sept. 8, 1985, and surpassed him three days later, in Cincinnati, with Rose’s mother and teenage son, Pete Jr., among those in attendance. Rose was 44 and the team’s player-manager. Batting left-handed against the San Diego Padres’ Eric Show in the first inning, he smacked a 2-1 slider into left field, a clean single. The crowd of 47,000-plus stood and yelled. The game was halted to celebrate. Rose was given the ball and the first base bag, then wept openly on the shoulder of first base coach and former teammate, Tommy Helms. He told Pete Jr., who would later play briefly for the Reds: “I love you, and I hope you pass me.” He thought of his late father, a star athlete himself who had pushed him to play sports since childhood. And he thought of Cobb, the dead-ball era slasher whom Rose so emulated that he named another son Tyler. Baseball Commissioner Peter Ueberroth, watching from New York, declared that Rose had “reserved a prominent spot in Cooperstown.” After the game, a 2-0 win for the Reds in which Rose scored both runs, he received a phone call from President Ronald Reagan. “Your reputation and legacy are secure,” Reagan told him. “It will be a long time before anyone is standing in the spot where you’re standing now.” Four years later, he was gone. On March 20, 1989, Ueberroth (who would soon be succeeded by A. Bartlett Giamatti) announced that his office was conducting a “full inquiry into serious allegations” about Rose. Reports emerged that he had been relying on a network of bookies and friends and others in the gambling world to place bets on baseball games, including some with the Reds. Rose denied any wrongdoing, but the investigation found that the “accumulated testimony of witnesses, together with the documentary evidence and telephone records reveal extensive betting activity by Pete Rose in connection with professional baseball and, in particular, Cincinnati Reds games, during the 1985, 1986, and 1987 baseball seasons.” Betting on baseball had been a primal sin since 1920, when several members of the Chicago White Sox were expelled for throwing the 1919 World Series — to the Cincinnati Reds. Baseball’s Rule 21, posted in every professional clubhouse, proclaims that “Any player, umpire or club or league official or employee who shall bet any sum whatsoever upon any baseball game in connection with which the bettor has a duty to perform shall be declared permanently ineligible.‘’ In the decades following the 1919 Series, Dodgers manager Leo Durocher and Detroit Tigers pitcher Denny McLain were among those suspended for gambling, and Willie Mays and Mickey Mantle were reprimanded for associating with casinos, even though both had retired years earlier. As far back as the 1970s, Bench and others had worried about Rose. By all accounts, he never bet against his own team, but even betting on the Reds left himself open to blackmail and raised questions about whether a given managerial decision was based on his own financial interest. In August 1989, at a New York press conference, Giamatti spoke some of the saddest words in baseball history: “One of the game’s greatest players has engaged in a variety of acts which have stained the game, and he must now live with the consequences of those acts.” Giamatti announced that Rose had agreed to a lifetime ban from baseball, a decision that in 1991 the Hall of Fame would rule left him ineligible for induction. Rose attempted to downplay the news, insisting that he had never bet on baseball and that he would eventually be reinstated. Within weeks of his announcement, Giamatti was dead from a heart attack. But the ban remained in place and Rose never made it to the Hall in his lifetime, although he did receive 41 votes in 1992 (when 323 votes were needed), around the time the Hall formally ruled that those banned from the game could never be elected. His status was long debated. Rose’s supporters including Donald Trump, who in 2015, the year before he was elected president, tweeted: “Can’t believe Major League Baseball just rejected @PeteRose_14 for the Hall of Fame. He’s paid the price. So ridiculous — let him in!” Meanwhile, his story changed. In a November 1989 memoir, written with “The Boys of Summer” author Roger Kahn, Rose again claimed innocence, only to reverse himself in 2004. He desperately wanted to come back, and effectively destroyed his chances. He would continue to spend time at casinos, insisting he was there for promotion, not gambling. He believed he had “messed up” and that his father would have been ashamed, but he still bet on baseball, albeit legally. “I don’t think betting is morally wrong. I don’t even think betting on baseball if morally wrong,” he wrote in “Play Hungry,” a memoir released in 2019. “There are legal ways, and there are illegal ways, and betting on baseball the way I did was against the rules of baseball.” His disgrace was all the harder because no one seemed to live for baseball more than Rose did. He remembered details of games from long ago and could quote the most obscure statistics about players from other teams. He was as relentless in spring training as he was in the postseason, when he brawled with the New York Mets’ Buddy Harrelson during the 1973 NL playoffs. His compulsion was most memorably defined in an otherwise meaningless contest — the 1970 All-Star Game, in Cincinnati. In the bottom of the 12th inning, the score tied at 4, he singled with two outs and advanced to second on a single by Billy Grabarkewitz. When Jim Hickman followed with a single, Rose raced past third and crashed at home into the Cleveland Indians’ Ray Fosse, scoring the winning run and fracturing Fosse’s shoulder. It was a collision often replayed, and an injury from which the catcher would say years later still pained him. “Would I do the same thing again today in the same situation? Damn right I would,” Rose wrote in his 2019 memoir. “But would I rather it had all gone down without Ray having suffered an injury that would dog his career? You bet.” Rose didn’t drink or smoke but indulged himself in other ways. He cared openly about money, vowing to become the first singles hitter to make $100,000 a year and leaving the Reds for the Phillies after declaring free agency at the end of the 1978 season (Rose returned in 1984). He was a longtime womanizer whose two marriages ended in divorce and who acknowledged fathering a child out of wedlock. In 1990, he pleaded guilty to two charges of filing false income tax returns and served five months in prison, the prosecutor calling his sentencing \"a sad day for those young Americans to whom Pete Rose was an idol.\" In the beginning, it was all about the game. He was a Cincinnati native from a working-class neighborhood whose father, Harry Francis Rose, like the father of Mickey Mantle, taught his son to be a switch hitter. Rose mastered his skills with a broom handle and a rubber ball, thrown to him by his younger brother, Dave. “I’d let him get as close as he wanted,‘’ Pete Rose told The Cincinnati Enquirer in 2015. “The closer he got, the harder it was to hit. Hour after hour, he’d try to strike me out. I wore that wall out.‘’ The Roses attended numerous games at Cincinnati’s Crosley Field, where the elder Rose noticed that St. Louis outfielder Enos Slaughter would always run full speed, whether at bat or in the field, and tell his son to do the same. Pete Rose graduated from high school in June 1960. He flew to Rochester, New York, two days later, and then rode a bus some 45 miles to Geneva, home of the Reds’ level D minor league team. By 1962, he had been promoted to level A, in Macon, Georgia. He batted .330 and vowed to displace Reds second baseman Don Blasingame in 1963, telling a reporter “I’m going to be on his heels.” Blasingame was with the Washington Senators by midseason and Rose was a phenomenon: “Charlie Hustle,” Yankees pitcher Whitey Ford reportedly called him, mockingly, after watching him hurry to first upon drawing a walk in spring training. Rose hit .273 as a rookie and, starting in 1965, batted .300 or higher 14 out of 15 seasons. He was so dependable that in 1968, the “Year of the Pitcher,” he led the league with a .335 average, one of three batting titles. “You could see he was going to be something, even in the minor leagues,” Dave Bristol, who managed him in the minors and for the Reds, told the Los Angeles Times in 1985. “You knew he was going to set records at something, if not Cobb’s. All that determination. He didn’t hit a ball, he attacked it. He was like a guy breaking up a dogfight. He loved to hit and hit and hit. You go to his hotel room at night, and he’s hitting the bed post.” After the 1969 season, when the Reds finished third, Bristol was fired and replaced by a minor league manager, 36-year-old Sparky Anderson. The age of “The Big Red Machine” had arrived. Anderson was known as “Captain Hook” for his willingness to replace pitchers, but he flattered and pampered his hitters, naming Rose team captain and letting Rose practice separately with Morgan, Bench and Perez. Between 1970 and 1976, the Reds won five division titles, four pennants and two World Series. As much as any player, Rose made the machine run, and not just on offense. With the Reds struggling at the start of the 1975 season, he agreed to move from left field to third base and make room for power hitter George Foster. The Reds were soon unstoppable, finishing 108-54 and sweeping Pittsburgh in the playoffs. In the World Series, one of baseball’s most dramatic, they outlasted the Boston Red Sox in seven games and won their first championship since 1940. Rose batted .370 and enjoyed himself so completely that during Game 6, won by Boston on Carlton Fisk’s 11th-inning homer, he turned to the Red Sox catcher during a previous inning and marveled at what a great game they were in. The Reds faded after the 1976 season and their World Series sweep against the Yankees, but Rose’s hits continued. In 1978, he batted safely in 44 straight games, placing him second behind Joe DiMaggio’s 56. After leaving for the Phillies in 1979, he surpassed Stan Musial as the National League’s career hit leader and helped lead Philadelphia to its first World Series title in 1980. At age 39, he batted a solid .282 and scored 95 runs, and, always hustling, made one of the World Series’ most memorable defensive plays. In the decisive Game 6 against Kansas City, the Royals trailed 4-1 going into the ninth inning, but loaded the bases with one out against reliever Tug McGraw. Kansas City’s Frank White then lofted a foul pop fly to the first base side of home plate. Catcher Bob Boone raced under it, only to have the ball pop out of his glove. Rose, sprinting in from first, snatched the ball for the out. McGraw struck out Willie Wilson to end the game. Rose played in one more World Series, in 1983, when he batted .313 even as the Phillies fell to the Baltimore Orioles in five games. He signed with the Montreal Expos in 1984, but rejoined the Reds in August as player-manager, replacing the fired Vern Rapp after the Reds acquired him in exchange for a minor leaguer. “There’s no question I’ll make some mistakes,” he told reporters. Rose had planned to limit himself to pinch-hitting with the Reds, but the trade revived him and he hit .365 over the rest of the season after batting just .259 for Montreal. He retired as a player after the 1986 season and his last game as a manager came two days before his banishment, Aug. 21, 1989, a 6-5 victory over the Chicago Cubs. His career managerial record was 412-373. In his post-baseball life, he did make it to a few honorary associations. The Reds voted him into the team’s Hall of Fame in 2016, the year before a bronze sculpture of Rose’s iconic slide was unveiled outside of Cincinnati’s Great American Ball Park. Rose the man was never inducted into Cooperstown, but his career was well represented. Items at the Baseball Hall include his helmet from his MVP 1973 season, the bat he used in 1978 when his hitting streak reached 44 and the cleats he wore, in 1985, on the day he became the game’s hits king.","summary":"Banished baseball great Pete Rose has died.

Harris, whose campaign plans were disrupted by the disaster, cut her trip short to return to Washington and monitor the federal response.President Joe Biden announced that he had communicated with the governors of Georgia and North Carolina following the devastating impact of Hurricane Helene on their states and expressed his intention to visit the state later in the week, likely on Wednesday or Thursday. Furthermore, he indicated that he \"may have to request\" Congress to convene a special session to approve additional funding to support those affected by the hurricane's aftermath.","summary":"Former President Trump accused Vice President Kamala Harris of staging a photo showing her during a call about Hurricane Helene recovery efforts.

The sheet of paper in front of Harris also appears to be blank. “This is the most VEEP-like photo ever — pretending to be on a phone call but forgetting to plug in the antiquated earphones while pretending to write on a blank piece of paper instead of actually doing anything,” conservative commentator Mollie Hemingway wrote on X. “Border Czar Kamala can’t miss a photo op,” Rep. Andy Biggs (R-Ariz.) tweeted. “The photographer should make sure the headphones are plugged into the phone next time.” “Thank goodness she’s pretending to write on this blank piece of paper from the plane while campaigning,” Republican communicator Matt Whitlock wrote on X. “I’m sure the people without power and water feel totally supported.” Harris, 59, has not traveled to any of the states affected by the storm, which has killed at least 120 people across the southeastern US since making landfall last Thursday. Meanwhile, Trump, 78, toured some of the damage left by Helene in Valdosta, Ga., on Monday and spoke with impacted citizens and local officials. The former president also pledged to deliver several semi trucks filled with “relief aid,” including gasoline, during his visit to the Peach State. “Biden and Harris abandoned Americans in Afghanistan,” Trump’s Truth Social post continued. “They sacrificed Americans to an Open Border, and now, they have left Americans to drown in North Carolina, Georgia, Tennessee, Alabama, and elsewhere in the South.” “Under this Administration, Americans always come last, because we have ‘leaders’ who have no idea how to lead!” he added. The Harris campaign did not respond to The Post’s request for comment.","summary":"Former President Donald Trump charged Monday that a photograph of Vice President Kamala Harris purportedly being briefed on the impacts of Hurricane Helene was “staged” and “fake” because her earbuds appear to not be plugged into her cellphone.  “Another FAKE and STAGED photo from someone who has no clue what she is doing,” the Republican &#8230;\n\n\nThe post Trump accuses Kamala Harris of staging Hurricane Helene briefing photo: ‘You have to plug the cord into the phone for it to work!’ appeared first on WorldNewsEra.","url":"https://worldnewsera.com/news/us-news/trump-accuses-kamala-harris-of-staging-hurricane-helene-briefing-photo-you-have-to-plug-the-cord-into-the-phone-for-it-to-work/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/09/trump-accuses-kamala-harris-staging-90757885.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1024","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-10-01 00:04:01","author":"Evelyn Blackwell","authors":["Evelyn Blackwell"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.536},{"id":258000412,"title":"Pete Rose, baseball’s banned hits leader, has died at age 83","text":"Pete Rose, baseball’s career hits leader and fallen idol who undermined his historic achievements and Hall of Fame dreams by gambling on the game he loved and once embodied, has died. He was 83. Stephanie Wheatley, a spokesperson for Clark County in Nevada, confirmed on behalf of the medical examiner that Rose died Monday. Wheatley said his cause and manner of death had not yet been determined. For fans who came of age in the 1960s and ‘70s, no player was more exciting than the Cincinnati Reds’ No. 14, “Charlie Hustle,” the brash superstar with the shaggy hair, puggish nose and muscular forearms. At the dawn of artificial surfaces, divisional play and free agency, Rose was old school, a conscious throwback to baseball’s early days. Millions could never forget him crouched and scowling at the plate, running full speed to first even after drawing a walk, or sprinting for the next base and diving headfirst into the bag. A 17-time All-Star, the switch-hitting Rose played on three World Series winners. He was the National League MVP in 1973 and World Series MVP two years later. He holds the major league record for games played (3,562) and plate appearances (15,890) and the NL record for the longest hitting streak (44). He was the leadoff man for one of baseball’s most formidable lineups with the Reds’ championship teams of 1975 and 1976, with teammates that included Hall of Famers Johnny Bench, Tony Perez and Joe Morgan. But no milestone approached his 4,256 hits, breaking his hero Ty Cobb’s 4,191 and signifying his excellence no matter the notoriety which followed. It was a total so extraordinary that you could average 200 hits for 20 years and still come up short. Rose’s secret was consistency, and longevity. Over 24 seasons, all but six played entirely with the Reds, Rose had 200 hits or more 10 times, and more than 180 four other times. He batted .303 overall, even while switching from second base to outfield to third to first, and he led the league in hits seven times. “Every summer, three things are going to happen,” Rose liked to say, “the grass is going to get green, the weather is going to get hot, and Pete Rose is going to get 200 hits and bat .300.” Rose was Rookie of the Year in 1963, but he started off 0 for 12 with three walks and a hit by pitch before getting his first major league hit, an eighth-inning triple off Pittsburgh’s Bob Friend. It came in Cincinnati on April 13, 1963, the day before Rose’s 22nd birthday. He reached 1,000 in 1968, 2,000 just five years later and 3,000 just five years after that. He moved into second place, ahead of Hank Aaron, with hit No. 3,772, in 1982. No. 4,000 was off the Phillies’ Jerry Koosman in 1984, exactly 21 years to the day after his first hit. He caught up with Cobb on Sept. 8, 1985, and surpassed him three days later, in Cincinnati, with Rose’s mother and teenage son, Pete Jr., among those in attendance. Rose was 44 and the team’s player-manager. Batting left-handed against the San Diego Padres’ Eric Show in the first inning, he smacked a 2-1 slider into left field, a clean single. The crowd of 47,000-plus stood and yelled. The game was halted to celebrate. Rose was given the ball and the first base bag, then wept openly on the shoulder of first base coach and former teammate, Tommy Helms. He told Pete Jr., who would later play briefly for the Reds: \"I love you, and I hope you pass me.\" He thought of his late father, a star athlete himself who had pushed him to play sports since childhood. And he thought of Cobb, the dead-ball era slasher whom Rose so emulated that he named another son Tyler. Baseball Commissioner Peter Ueberroth, watching from New York, declared that Rose had “reserved a prominent spot in Cooperstown.” After the game, a 2-0 win for the Reds in which Rose scored both runs, he received a phone call from President Ronald Reagan. “Your reputation and legacy are secure,\" Reagan told him. “It will be a long time before anyone is standing in the spot where you're standing now.\" Four years later, he was gone. On March 20, 1989, Ueberroth (who would soon be succeeded by A. Bartlett Giamatti) announced that his office was conducting a \"full inquiry into serious allegations\" about Rose. Reports emerged that he had been relying on a network of bookies and friends and others in the gambling world to place bets on baseball games, including some with the Reds. Rose denied any wrongdoing, but the investigation found that the “accumulated testimony of witnesses, together with the documentary evidence and telephone records reveal extensive betting activity by Pete Rose in connection with professional baseball and, in particular, Cincinnati Reds games, during the 1985, 1986, and 1987 baseball seasons.” Betting on baseball had been a primal sin since 1920, when several members of the Chicago White Sox were expelled for throwing the 1919 World Series — to the Cincinnati Reds. Baseball’s Rule 21, posted in every professional clubhouse, proclaims that “Any player, umpire or club or league official or employee who shall bet any sum whatsoever upon any baseball game in connection with which the bettor has a duty to perform shall be declared permanently ineligible.'' In the decades following the 1919 Series, Dodgers manager Leo Durocher and Detroit Tigers pitcher Denny McLain were among those suspended for gambling, and Willie Mays and Mickey Mantle were reprimanded for associating with casinos, even though both had retired years earlier. As far back as the 1970s, Bench and others had worried about Rose. By all accounts, he never bet against his own team, but even betting on the Reds left himself open to blackmail and raised questions about whether a given managerial decision was based on his own financial interest. In August 1989, at a New York press conference, Giamatti spoke some of the saddest words in baseball history: “One of the game's greatest players has engaged in a variety of acts which have stained the game, and he must now live with the consequences of those acts.” Giamatti announced that Rose had agreed to a lifetime ban from baseball, a decision that in 1991 the Hall of Fame would rule left him ineligible for induction. Rose attempted to downplay the news, insisting that he had never bet on baseball and that he would eventually be reinstated. Within weeks of his announcement, Giamatti was dead from a heart attack. But the ban remained in place and Rose never made it to the Hall in his lifetime, although he did receive 41 votes in 1992 (when 323 votes were needed), around the time the Hall formally ruled that those banned from the game could never be elected. His status was long debated. Rose’s supporters including Donald Trump, who in 2015, the year before he was elected president, tweeted: “Can’t believe Major League Baseball just rejected @PeteRose_14 for the Hall of Fame. He’s paid the price. So ridiculous — let him in!” Meanwhile, his story changed. In a November 1989 memoir, written with “The Boys of Summer” author Roger Kahn, Rose again claimed innocence, only to reverse himself in 2004. He desperately wanted to come back, and effectively destroyed his chances. He would continue to spend time at casinos, insisting he was there for promotion, not gambling. He believed he had “messed up” and that his father would have been ashamed, but he still bet on baseball, albeit legally. “I don’t think betting is morally wrong. I don’t even think betting on baseball if morally wrong,” he wrote in “Play Hungry,” a memoir released in 2019. “There are legal ways, and there are illegal ways, and betting on baseball the way I did was against the rules of baseball.” His disgrace was all the harder because no one seemed to live for baseball more than Rose did. He remembered details of games from long ago and could quote the most obscure statistics about players from other teams. He was as relentless in spring training as he was in the postseason, when he brawled with the New York Mets’ Buddy Harrelson during the 1973 NL playoffs. His compulsion was most memorably defined in an otherwise meaningless contest — the 1970 All-Star Game, in Cincinnati. In the bottom of the 12th inning, the score tied at 4, he singled with two outs and advanced to second on a single by Billy Grabarkewitz. When Jim Hickman followed with a single, Rose raced past third and crashed at home into the Cleveland Indians’ Ray Fosse, scoring the winning run and fracturing Fosse’s shoulder. It was a collision often replayed, and an injury from which the catcher would say years later still pained him. “Would I do the same thing again today in the same situation? Damn right I would,” Rose wrote in his 2019 memoir. “But would I rather it had all gone down without Ray having suffered an injury that would dog his career? You bet.” Rose didn’t drink or smoke but indulged himself in other ways. He cared openly about money, vowing to become the first singles hitter to make $100,000 a year and leaving the Reds for the Phillies after declaring free agency at the end of the 1978 season (Rose returned in 1984). He was a longtime womanizer whose two marriages ended in divorce and who acknowledged fathering a child out of wedlock. In 1990, he pleaded guilty to two charges of filing false income tax returns and served five months in prison, the prosecutor calling his sentencing \"a sad day for those young Americans to whom Pete Rose was an idol.\" In the beginning, it was all about the game. He was a Cincinnati native from a working-class neighborhood whose father, Harry Francis Rose, like the father of Mickey Mantle, taught his son to be a switch hitter. Rose mastered his skills with a broom handle and a rubber ball, thrown to him by his younger brother, Dave. \"I'd let him get as close as he wanted,'' Pete Rose told The Cincinnati Enquirer in 2015. \"The closer he got, the harder it was to hit. Hour after hour, he'd try to strike me out. I wore that wall out.'' The Roses attended numerous games at Cincinnati’s Crosley Field, where the elder Rose noticed that St. Louis outfielder Enos Slaughter would always run full speed, whether at bat or in the field, and tell his son to do the same. Pete Rose graduated from high school in June 1960. He flew to Rochester, New York, two days later, and then rode a bus some 45 miles to Geneva, home of the Reds’ level D minor league team. By 1962, he had been promoted to level A, in Macon, Georgia. He batted .330 and vowed to displace Reds second baseman Don Blasingame in 1963, telling a reporter “I’m going to be on his heels.” Blasingame was with the Washington Senators by midseason and Rose was a phenomenon: “Charlie Hustle,” Yankees pitcher Whitey Ford reportedly called him, mockingly, after watching him hurry to first upon drawing a walk in spring training. Rose hit .273 as a rookie and, starting in 1965, batted .300 or higher 14 out of 15 seasons. He was so dependable that in 1968, the “Year of the Pitcher,” he led the league with a .335 average, one of three batting titles. “You could see he was going to be something, even in the minor leagues,” Dave Bristol, who managed him in the minors and for the Reds, told the Los Angeles Times in 1985. “You knew he was going to set records at something, if not Cobb’s. All that determination. He didn’t hit a ball, he attacked it. He was like a guy breaking up a dogfight. He loved to hit and hit and hit. You go to his hotel room at night, and he’s hitting the bed post.” After the 1969 season, when the Reds finished third, Bristol was fired and replaced by a minor league manager, 36-year-old Sparky Anderson. The age of “The Big Red Machine” had arrived. Anderson was known as “Captain Hook” for his willingness to replace pitchers, but he flattered and pampered his hitters, naming Rose team captain and letting Rose practice separately with Morgan, Bench and Perez. Between 1970 and 1976, the Reds won five division titles, four pennants and two World Series. As much as any player, Rose made the machine run, and not just on offense. With the Reds struggling at the start of the 1975 season, he agreed to move from left field to third base and make room for power hitter George Foster. The Reds were soon unstoppable, finishing 108-54 and sweeping Pittsburgh in the playoffs. In the World Series, one of baseball’s most dramatic, they outlasted the Boston Red Sox in seven games and won their first championship since 1940. Rose batted .370 and enjoyed himself so completely that during Game 6, won by Boston on Carlton Fisk’s 11th-inning homer, he turned to the Red Sox catcher during a previous inning and marveled at what a great game they were in. The Reds faded after the 1976 season and their World Series sweep against the Yankees, but Rose’s hits continued. In 1978, he batted safely in 44 straight games, placing him second behind Joe DiMaggio’s 56. After leaving for the Phillies in 1979, he surpassed Stan Musial as the National League’s career hit leader and helped lead Philadelphia to its first World Series title in 1980. At age 39, he batted a solid .282 and scored 95 runs, and, always hustling, made one of the World Series’ most memorable defensive plays. In the decisive Game 6 against Kansas City, the Royals trailed 4-1 going into the ninth inning, but loaded the bases with one out against reliever Tug McGraw. Kansas City’s Frank White then lofted a foul pop fly to the first base side of home plate. Catcher Bob Boone raced under it, only to have the ball pop out of his glove. Rose, sprinting in from first, snatched the ball for the out. McGraw struck out Willie Wilson to end the game. Rose played in one more World Series, in 1983, when he batted .313 even as the Phillies fell to the Baltimore Orioles in five games. He signed with the Montreal Expos in 1984, but rejoined the Reds in August as player-manager, replacing the fired Vern Rapp after the Reds acquired him in exchange for a minor leaguer. “There’s no question I’ll make some mistakes,” he told reporters. Rose had planned to limit himself to pinch-hitting with the Reds, but the trade revived him and he hit .365 over the rest of the season after batting just .259 for Montreal. He retired as a player after the 1986 season and his last game as a manager came two days before his banishment, Aug. 21, 1989, a 6-5 victory over the Chicago Cubs. His career managerial record was 412-373. In his post-baseball life, he did make it to a few honorary associations. The Reds voted him into the team’s Hall of Fame in 2016, the year before a bronze sculpture of Rose’s iconic slide was unveiled outside of Cincinnati’s Great American Ball Park. Rose the man was never inducted into Cooperstown, but his career was well represented. Items at the Baseball Hall include his helmet from his MVP 1973 season, the bat he used in 1978 when his hitting streak reached 44 and the cleats he wore, in 1985, on the day he became the game’s hits king. ___ AP MLB: https://apnews.com/hub/MLB","summary":"Banished baseball great Pete Rose has died","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/ap-hall-of-fame-cincinnati-reds-cincinnati-ty-cobb-b2621671.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2024/10/01/01/Obit_Pete_Rose_93074.jpg?width=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-30 23:59:39","author":"Hillel Italie","authors":["Hillel Italie"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":0.547},{"id":258000290,"title":"Pete Rose, baseball’s banned hits leader, has died at age 83","text":"NEW YORK (AP) — Pete Rose, baseball’s career hits leader and fallen idol who undermined his historic achievements and Hall of Fame dreams by gambling on the game he loved and once embodied, has died.

At age 39, he batted a solid .282 and scored 95 runs, and, always hustling, made one of the World Series’ most memorable defensive plays. In the decisive Game 6 against Kansas City, the Royals trailed 4-1 going into the ninth inning, but loaded the bases with one out against reliever Tug McGraw. Kansas City’s Frank White then lofted a foul pop fly to the first base side of home plate. Catcher Bob Boone raced under it, only to have the ball pop out of his glove. Rose, sprinting in from first, snatched the ball for the out. McGraw struck out Willie Wilson to end the game. Rose played in one more World Series, in 1983, when he batted .313 even as the Phillies fell to the Baltimore Orioles in five games. He signed with the Montreal Expos in 1984, but rejoined the Reds in August as player-manager, replacing the fired Vern Rapp after the Reds acquired him in exchange for a minor leaguer. “There’s no question I’ll make some mistakes,” he told reporters. Rose had planned to limit himself to pinch-hitting with the Reds, but the trade revived him and he hit .365 over the rest of the season after batting just .259 for Montreal. He retired as a player after the 1986 season and his last game as a manager came two days before his banishment, Aug. 21, 1989, a 6-5 victory over the Chicago Cubs. His career managerial record was 412-373. In his post-baseball life, he did make it to a few honorary associations. The Reds voted him into the team’s Hall of Fame in 2016, the year before a bronze sculpture of Rose’s iconic slide was unveiled outside of Cincinnati’s Great American Ball Park. Rose the man was never inducted into Cooperstown, but his career was well represented.

He was 83. Stephanie Wheatley, a spokesperson for Clark County in Nevada, confirmed on behalf of the medical examiner that Rose died Monday. Wheatley said his cause and manner of death had not yet been determined. For fans who came of age in the 1960s and ‘70s, no player was more exciting than the Cincinnati Reds’ No. 14, “Charlie Hustle,” the brash superstar with the shaggy hair, puggish nose and muscular forearms. At the dawn of artificial surfaces, divisional play and free agency, Rose was old school, a conscious throwback to baseball’s early days. Millions could never forget him crouched and scowling at the plate, running full speed to first even after drawing a walk, or sprinting for the next base and diving headfirst into the bag. A 17-time All-Star, the switch-hitting Rose played on three World Series winners. He was the National League MVP in 1973 and World Series MVP two years later. He holds the major league record for games played (3,562) and plate appearances (15,890) and the NL record for the longest hitting streak (44). He was the leadoff man for one of baseball’s most formidable lineups with the Reds’ championship teams of 1975 and 1976, with teammates that included Hall of Famers Johnny Bench, Tony Perez and Joe Morgan. But no milestone approached his 4,256 hits, breaking his hero Ty Cobb’s 4,191 and signifying his excellence no matter the notoriety which followed. It was a total so extraordinary that you could average 200 hits for 20 years and still come up short. Rose’s secret was consistency, and longevity. Over 24 seasons, all but six played entirely with the Reds, Rose had 200 hits or more 10 times, and more than 180 four other times. He batted .303 overall, even while switching from second base to outfield to third to first, and he led the league in hits seven times. “Every summer, three things are going to happen,” Rose liked to say, “the grass is going to get green, the weather is going to get hot, and Pete Rose is going to get 200 hits and bat .300.” Rose was Rookie of the Year in 1963, but he started off 0 for 12 with three walks and a hit by pitch before getting his first major league hit, an eighth-inning triple off Pittsburgh’s Bob Friend. It came in Cincinnati on April 13, 1963, the day before Rose’s 22nd birthday. He reached 1,000 in 1968, 2,000 just five years later and 3,000 just five years after that. He moved into second place, ahead of Hank Aaron, with hit No. 3,772, in 1982. No. 4,000 was off the Phillies’ Jerry Koosman in 1984, exactly 21 years to the day after his first hit. He caught up with Cobb on Sept. 8, 1985, and surpassed him three days later, in Cincinnati, with Rose’s mother and teenage son, Pete Jr., among those in attendance. Rose was 44 and the team’s player-manager. Batting left-handed against the San Diego Padres’ Eric Show in the first inning, he smacked a 2-1 slider into left field, a clean single. The crowd of 47,000-plus stood and yelled. The game was halted to celebrate. Rose was given the ball and the first base bag, then wept openly on the shoulder of first base coach and former teammate, Tommy Helms. He told Pete Jr., who would later play briefly for the Reds: “I love you, and I hope you pass me.” He thought of his late father, a star athlete himself who had pushed him to play sports since childhood. And he thought of Cobb, the dead-ball era slasher whom Rose so emulated that he named another son Tyler. Baseball Commissioner Peter Ueberroth, watching from New York, declared that Rose had “reserved a prominent spot in Cooperstown.” After the game, a 2-0 win for the Reds in which Rose scored both runs, he received a phone call from President Ronald Reagan. “Your reputation and legacy are secure,” Reagan told him. “It will be a long time before anyone is standing in the spot where you’re standing now.” Four years later, he was gone. On March 20, 1989, Ueberroth (who would soon be succeeded by A. Bartlett Giamatti) announced that his office was conducting a “full inquiry into serious allegations” about Rose. Reports emerged that he had been relying on a network of bookies and friends and others in the gambling world to place bets on baseball games, including some with the Reds. Rose denied any wrongdoing, but the investigation found that the “accumulated testimony of witnesses, together with the documentary evidence and telephone records reveal extensive betting activity by Pete Rose in connection with professional baseball and, in particular, Cincinnati Reds games, during the 1985, 1986, and 1987 baseball seasons.” Betting on baseball had been a primal sin since 1920, when several members of the Chicago White Sox were expelled for throwing the 1919 World Series — to the Cincinnati Reds. Baseball’s Rule 21, posted in every professional clubhouse, proclaims that “Any player, umpire or club or league official or employee who shall bet any sum whatsoever upon any baseball game in connection with which the bettor has a duty to perform shall be declared permanently ineligible.” In the decades following the 1919 Series, Dodgers manager Leo Durocher and Detroit Tigers pitcher Denny McLain were among those suspended for gambling, and Willie Mays and Mickey Mantle were reprimanded for associating with casinos, even though both had retired years earlier. As far back as the 1970s, Bench and others had worried about Rose. By all accounts, he never bet against his own team, but even betting on the Reds left himself open to blackmail and raised questions about whether a given managerial decision was based on his own financial interest. In August 1989, at a New York press conference, Giamatti spoke some of the saddest words in baseball history: “One of the game’s greatest players has engaged in a variety of acts which have stained the game, and he must now live with the consequences of those acts.” Giamatti announced that Rose had agreed to a lifetime ban from baseball, a decision that in 1991 the Hall of Fame would rule left him ineligible for induction. Rose attempted to downplay the news, insisting that he had never bet on baseball and that he would eventually be reinstated. Within weeks of his announcement, Giamatti was dead from a heart attack. But the ban remained in place and Rose never made it to the Hall in his lifetime, although he did receive 41 votes in 1992 (when 323 votes were needed), around the time the Hall formally ruled that those banned from the game could never be elected. His status was long debated. Rose’s supporters including Donald Trump, who in 2015, the year before he was elected president, tweeted: “Can’t believe Major League Baseball just rejected @PeteRose_14 for the Hall of Fame. He’s paid the price. So ridiculous — let him in!” Meanwhile, his story changed. In a November 1989 memoir, written with “The Boys of Summer” author Roger Kahn, Rose again claimed innocence, only to reverse himself in 2004. He desperately wanted to come back, and effectively destroyed his chances. He would continue to spend time at casinos, insisting he was there for promotion, not gambling. He believed he had “messed up” and that his father would have been ashamed, but he still bet on baseball, albeit legally. “I don’t think betting is morally wrong. I don’t even think betting on baseball if morally wrong,” he wrote in “Play Hungry,” a memoir released in 2019. “There are legal ways, and there are illegal ways, and betting on baseball the way I did was against the rules of baseball.” His disgrace was all the harder because no one seemed to live for baseball more than Rose did. He remembered details of games from long ago and could quote the most obscure statistics about players from other teams. He was as relentless in spring training as he was in the postseason, when he brawled with the New York Mets’ Buddy Harrelson during the 1973 NL playoffs. His compulsion was most memorably defined in an otherwise meaningless contest — the 1970 All-Star Game, in Cincinnati. In the bottom of the 12th inning, the score tied at 4, he singled with two outs and advanced to second on a single by Billy Grabarkewitz. When Jim Hickman followed with a single, Rose raced past third and crashed at home into the Cleveland Indians’ Ray Fosse, scoring the winning run and fracturing Fosse’s shoulder. It was a collision often replayed, and an injury from which the catcher would say years later still pained him. “Would I do the same thing again today in the same situation? Damn right I would,” Rose wrote in his 2019 memoir. “But would I rather it had all gone down without Ray having suffered an injury that would dog his career? You bet.” Rose didn’t drink or smoke but indulged himself in other ways. He cared openly about money, vowing to become the first singles hitter to make $100,000 a year and leaving the Reds for the Phillies after declaring free agency at the end of the 1978 season (Rose returned in 1984). He was a longtime womanizer whose two marriages ended in divorce and who acknowledged fathering a child out of wedlock. In 1990, he pleaded guilty to two charges of filing false income tax returns and served five months in prison, the prosecutor calling his sentencing \"a sad day for those young Americans to whom Pete Rose was an idol.\" In the beginning, it was all about the game. He was a Cincinnati native from a working-class neighborhood whose father, Harry Francis Rose, like the father of Mickey Mantle, taught his son to be a switch hitter. Rose mastered his skills with a broom handle and a rubber ball, thrown to him by his younger brother, Dave. “I’d let him get as close as he wanted,” Pete Rose told The Cincinnati Enquirer in 2015. “The closer he got, the harder it was to hit. Hour after hour, he’d try to strike me out. I wore that wall out.” The Roses attended numerous games at Cincinnati’s Crosley Field, where the elder Rose noticed that St. Louis outfielder Enos Slaughter would always run full speed, whether at bat or in the field, and tell his son to do the same. Pete Rose graduated from high school in June 1960. He flew to Rochester, New York, two days later, and then rode a bus some 45 miles to Geneva, home of the Reds’ level D minor league team. By 1962, he had been promoted to level A, in Macon, Georgia. He batted .330 and vowed to displace Reds second baseman Don Blasingame in 1963, telling a reporter “I’m going to be on his heels.” Blasingame was with the Washington Senators by midseason and Rose was a phenomenon: “Charlie Hustle,” Yankees pitcher Whitey Ford reportedly called him, mockingly, after watching him hurry to first upon drawing a walk in spring training. Rose hit .273 as a rookie and, starting in 1965, batted .300 or higher 14 out of 15 seasons. He was so dependable that in 1968, the “Year of the Pitcher,” he led the league with a .335 average, one of three batting titles. “You could see he was going to be something, even in the minor leagues,” Dave Bristol, who managed him in the minors and for the Reds, told the Los Angeles Times in 1985. “You knew he was going to set records at something, if not Cobb’s. All that determination. He didn’t hit a ball, he attacked it. He was like a guy breaking up a dogfight. He loved to hit and hit and hit. You go to his hotel room at night, and he’s hitting the bed post.” After the 1969 season, when the Reds finished third, Bristol was fired and replaced by a minor league manager, 36-year-old Sparky Anderson. The age of “The Big Red Machine” had arrived. Anderson was known as “Captain Hook” for his willingness to replace pitchers, but he flattered and pampered his hitters, naming Rose team captain and letting Rose practice separately with Morgan, Bench and Perez. Between 1970 and 1976, the Reds won five division titles, four pennants and two World Series. As much as any player, Rose made the machine run, and not just on offense. With the Reds struggling at the start of the 1975 season, he agreed to move from left field to third base and make room for power hitter George Foster. The Reds were soon unstoppable, finishing 108-54 and sweeping Pittsburgh in the playoffs. In the World Series, one of baseball’s most dramatic, they outlasted the Boston Red Sox in seven games and won their first championship since 1940. Rose batted .370 and enjoyed himself so completely that during Game 6, won by Boston on Carlton Fisk’s 11th-inning homer, he turned to the Red Sox catcher during a previous inning and marveled at what a great game they were in. The Reds faded after the 1976 season and their World Series sweep against the Yankees, but Rose’s hits continued. In 1978, he batted safely in 44 straight games, placing him second behind Joe DiMaggio’s 56. After leaving for the Phillies in 1979, he surpassed Stan Musial as the National League’s career hit leader and helped lead Philadelphia to its first World Series title in 1980. At age 39, he batted a solid .282 and scored 95 runs, and, always hustling, made one of the World Series’ most memorable defensive plays. In the decisive Game 6 against Kansas City, the Royals trailed 4-1 going into the ninth inning, but loaded the bases with one out against reliever Tug McGraw. Kansas City’s Frank White then lofted a foul pop fly to the first base side of home plate. Catcher Bob Boone raced under it, only to have the ball pop out of his glove.

At age 39, he batted a solid .282 and scored 95 runs, and, always hustling, made one of the World Series’ most memorable defensive plays. In the decisive Game 6 against Kansas City, the Royals trailed 4-1 going into the ninth inning, but loaded the bases with one out against reliever Tug McGraw. Kansas City’s Frank White then lofted a foul pop fly to the first base side of home plate. Catcher Bob Boone raced under it, only to have the ball pop out of his glove. Rose, sprinting in from first, snatched the ball for the out. McGraw struck out Willie Wilson to end the game. Rose played in one more World Series, in 1983, when he batted .313 even as the Phillies fell to the Baltimore Orioles in five games. He signed with the Montreal Expos in 1984, but rejoined the Reds in August as player-manager, replacing the fired Vern Rapp after the Reds acquired him in exchange for a minor leaguer. “There’s no question I’ll make some mistakes,” he told reporters. Rose had planned to limit himself to pinch-hitting with the Reds, but the trade revived him and he hit .365 over the rest of the season after batting just .259 for Montreal. He retired as a player after the 1986 season and his last game as a manager came two days before his banishment, Aug. 21, 1989, a 6-5 victory over the Chicago Cubs. His career managerial record was 412-373. In his post-baseball life, he did make it to a few honorary associations. The Reds voted him into the team’s Hall of Fame in 2016, the year before a bronze sculpture of Rose’s iconic slide was unveiled outside of Cincinnati’s Great American Ball Park. Rose the man was never inducted into Cooperstown, but his career was well represented. Items at the Baseball Hall include his helmet from his MVP 1973 season, the bat he used in 1978 when his hitting streak reached 44 and the cleats he wore, in 1985, on the day he became the game’s hits king.","summary":"Rose, known as Charlie Hustle, won World Series titles with the Reds and the Phillies before he was banned in 1989.","url":"https://www.centralmaine.com/2024/09/30/pete-rose-mlbs-all-time-hits-leader-who-was-banned-from-baseball-for-gambling-dies-at-83/","image":"https://w2pcms.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2024/04/Sports_Bans_Baseball_64204.jpg?w=1000","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-30 23:53:41","author":"Associated Press,Scott Martin","authors":["Associated Press","Scott Martin"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.549},{"id":257999860,"title":"Trump accuses Kamala Harris of staging Hurricane Helene briefing photo: ‘You have to plug the cord into the phone for it to work!’","text":"Former President Donald Trump charged Monday that a photograph of Vice President Kamala Harris purportedly being briefed on the impacts of Hurricane Helene was “staged” and “fake” because her earbuds appear to not be plugged into her cellphone. “Another FAKE and STAGED photo from someone who has no clue what she is doing,” the Republican presidential nominee wrote on Truth Social. “You have to plug the cord into the phone for it to work!” he added. The photograph in question – posted on Harris’ official vice presidential X account on Sunday – shows the Democratic nominee appearing pensive and writing notes as she takes a call aboard Air Force Two. “I was just briefed by [FEMA Administrator Deanne Criswell] on the latest developments about the ongoing impacts of Hurricane Helene,” Harris states in the post. “We also discussed our Administration’s continued actions to support emergency response and recovery.” “I also spoke with [North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper] about the ongoing rescue and recovery efforts in North Carolina,” she added. “Our Administration will continue to stay in constant contact with state and local officials to ensure communities have the support and resources they need.” As Trump and several social media users pointed out, from the angle of the photograph posted on X, the cord that should be connecting Harris’ old-fashioned earbuds to the phone resting on the table in front of her dangles straight down and does not appear to be connected to the device. The sheet of paper in front of Harris also appears to be blank. “This is the most VEEP-like photo ever — pretending to be on a phone call but forgetting to plug in the antiquated earphones while pretending to write on a blank piece of paper instead of actually doing anything,” conservative commentator Mollie Hemingway wrote on X. “Border Czar Kamala can’t miss a photo op,” Rep. Andy Biggs (R-Ariz.) tweeted. “The photographer should make sure the headphones are plugged into the phone next time.” “Thank goodness she’s pretending to write on this blank piece of paper from the plane while campaigning,” Republican communicator Matt Whitlock wrote on X. “I’m sure the people without power and water feel totally supported.” Harris, 59, has not traveled to any of the states affected by the storm, which has killed at least 120 people across the southeastern US since making landfall last Thursday. Meanwhile, Trump, 78, toured some of the damage left by Helene in Valdosta, Ga., on Monday and spoke with impacted citizens and local officials. The former president also pledged to deliver several semi trucks filled with “relief aid,” including gasoline, during his visit to the Peach State. “Biden and Harris abandoned Americans in Afghanistan,” Trump’s Truth Social post continued. “They sacrificed Americans to an Open Border, and now, they have left Americans to drown in North Carolina, Georgia, Tennessee, Alabama, and elsewhere in the South.” “Under this Administration, Americans always come last, because we have ‘leaders’ who have no idea how to lead!” he added. The Harris campaign did not respond to The Post’s request for comment.","summary":"The photograph in question – posted on Harris’ official vice presidential X account on Sunday – shows the Democratic nominee appearing pensive and writing notes as she takes a call aboard Air Force Two.  ","url":"https://nypost.com/2024/09/30/us-news/trump-accuses-kamala-harris-of-staging-hurricane-helene-briefing-photo/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/09/trump-accuses-kamala-harris-staging-90757885.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/QYgJMQKr-RyIcpnTz.mp4","publish_date":"2024-09-30 23:53:31","author":"Victor Nava","authors":["Victor Nava"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.536},{"id":257999864,"title":"Pete Rose, MLB hit king banned from baseball, dies at 83","text":"NEW YORK — Pete Rose, baseball’s career hits leader and fallen idol who undermined his historic achievements and Hall of Fame dreams by gambling on the game he loved and once embodied, has died. He was 83. Stephanie Wheatley, a spokesperson for Clark County in Nevada, confirmed on behalf of the medical examiner that Rose died Monday. Wheatley said his cause and manner of death had not yet been determined. For fans who came of age in the 1960s and ‘70s, no player was more exciting than the Cincinnati Reds’ No. 14, “Charlie Hustle,” the brash superstar with the shaggy hair, puggish nose and muscular forearms. At the dawn of artificial surfaces, divisional play and free agency, Rose was old school, a conscious throwback to baseball’s early days. Millions could never forget him crouched and scowling at the plate, running full speed to first even after drawing a walk, or sprinting for the next base and diving headfirst into the bag. A 17-time All-Star, the switch-hitting Rose played on three World Series winners. He was the National League MVP in 1973 and World Series MVP two years later. He holds the major league record for games played (3,562) and plate appearances (15,890) and the NL record for the longest hitting streak (44). He was the leadoff man for one of baseball’s most formidable lineups with the Reds’ championship teams of 1975 and 1976, with teammates that included Hall of Famers Johnny Bench, Tony Perez and Joe Morgan. But no milestone approached his 4,256 hits, breaking his hero Ty Cobb’s 4,191 and signifying his excellence no matter the notoriety which followed. It was a total so extraordinary that you could average 200 hits for 20 years and still come up short. Rose’s secret was consistency, and longevity. Over 24 seasons, all but six played entirely with the Reds, Rose had 200 hits or more 10 times, and more than 180 four other times. He batted .303 overall, even while switching from second base to outfield to third to first, and he led the league in hits seven times. “Every summer, three things are going to happen,” Rose liked to say, “the grass is going to get green, the weather is going to get hot, and Pete Rose is going to get 200 hits and bat .300.” Rose was Rookie of the Year in 1963, but he started off 0 for 12 with three walks and a hit by pitch before getting his first major league hit, an eighth-inning triple off Pittsburgh’s Bob Friend. It came in Cincinnati on April 13, 1963, the day before Rose’s 22nd birthday. He reached 1,000 in 1968, 2,000 just five years later and 3,000 just five years after that. He moved into second place, ahead of Hank Aaron, with hit No. 3,772, in 1982. No. 4,000 was off the Phillies’ Jerry Koosman in 1984, exactly 21 years to the day after his first hit. He caught up with Cobb on Sept. 8, 1985, and surpassed him three days later, in Cincinnati, with Rose’s mother and teenage son, Pete Jr., among those in attendance. Rose was 44 and the team’s player-manager. Batting left-handed against the San Diego Padres’ Eric Show in the first inning, he smacked a 2-1 slider into left field, a clean single. The crowd of 47,000-plus stood and yelled. The game was halted to celebrate. Rose was given the ball and the first base bag, then wept openly on the shoulder of first base coach and former teammate, Tommy Helms. He told Pete Jr., who would later play briefly for the Reds: “I love you, and I hope you pass me.” He thought of his late father, a star athlete himself who had pushed him to play sports since childhood. And he thought of Cobb, the dead-ball era slasher whom Rose so emulated that he named another son Tyler. Baseball Commissioner Peter Ueberroth, watching from New York, declared that Rose had “reserved a prominent spot in Cooperstown.” After the game, a 2-0 win for the Reds in which Rose scored both runs, he received a phone call from President Ronald Reagan. “Your reputation and legacy are secure,” Reagan told him. “It will be a long time before anyone is standing in the spot where you’re standing now.” Four years later, he was gone. On March 20, 1989, Ueberroth (who would soon be succeeded by A. Bartlett Giamatti) announced that his office was conducting a “full inquiry into serious allegations” about Rose. Reports emerged that he had been relying on a network of bookies and friends and others in the gambling world to place bets on baseball games, including some with the Reds. Rose denied any wrongdoing, but the investigation found that the “accumulated testimony of witnesses, together with the documentary evidence and telephone records reveal extensive betting activity by Pete Rose in connection with professional baseball and, in particular, Cincinnati Reds games, during the 1985, 1986, and 1987 baseball seasons.” Betting on baseball had been a primal sin since 1920, when several members of the Chicago White Sox were expelled for throwing the 1919 World Series — to the Cincinnati Reds. Baseball’s Rule 21, posted in every professional clubhouse, proclaims that “Any player, umpire or club or league official or employee who shall bet any sum whatsoever upon any baseball game in connection with which the bettor has a duty to perform shall be declared permanently ineligible.’’ In the decades following the 1919 Series, Dodgers manager Leo Durocher and Detroit Tigers pitcher Denny McLain were among those suspended for gambling, and Willie Mays and Mickey Mantle were reprimanded for associating with casinos, even though both had retired years earlier. As far back as the 1970s, Bench and others had worried about Rose. By all accounts, he never bet against his own team, but even betting on the Reds left himself open to blackmail and raised questions about whether a given managerial decision was based on his own financial interest. In August 1989, at a New York press conference, Giamatti spoke some of the saddest words in baseball history: “One of the game’s greatest players has engaged in a variety of acts which have stained the game, and he must now live with the consequences of those acts.” Giamatti announced that Rose had agreed to a lifetime ban from baseball, a decision that in 1991 the Hall of Fame would rule left him ineligible for induction. Rose attempted to downplay the news, insisting that he had never bet on baseball and that he would eventually be reinstated. Within weeks of his announcement, Giamatti was dead from a heart attack. But the ban remained in place and Rose never made it to the Hall in his lifetime, although he did receive 41 votes in 1992 (when 323 votes were needed), around the time the Hall formally ruled that those banned from the game could never be elected. His status was long debated. Rose’s supporters including Donald Trump, who in 2015, the year before he was elected president, tweeted: “Can’t believe Major League Baseball just rejected @PeteRose14 for the Hall of Fame. He’s paid the price. So ridiculous — let him in!” Meanwhile, his story changed. In a November 1989 memoir, written with “The Boys of Summer” author Roger Kahn, Rose again claimed innocence, only to reverse himself in 2004. He desperately wanted to come back, and effectively destroyed his chances. He would continue to spend time at casinos, insisting he was there for promotion, not gambling. He believed he had “messed up” and that his father would have been ashamed, but he still bet on baseball, albeit legally. “I don’t think betting is morally wrong. I don’t even think betting on baseball if morally wrong,” he wrote in “Play Hungry,” a memoir released in 2019. “There are legal ways, and there are illegal ways, and betting on baseball the way I did was against the rules of baseball.” His disgrace was all the harder because no one seemed to live for baseball more than Rose did. He remembered details of games from long ago and could quote the most obscure statistics about players from other teams. He was as relentless in spring training as he was in the postseason, when he brawled with the New York Mets’ Buddy Harrelson during the 1973 NL playoffs. His compulsion was most memorably defined in an otherwise meaningless contest — the 1970 All-Star Game, in Cincinnati. In the bottom of the 12th inning, the score tied at 4, he singled with two outs and advanced to second on a single by Billy Grabarkewitz. When Jim Hickman followed with a single, Rose raced past third and crashed at home into the Cleveland Indians’ Ray Fosse, scoring the winning run and fracturing Fosse’s shoulder. It was a collision often replayed, and an injury from which the catcher would say years later still pained him. “Would I do the same thing again today in the same situation? Damn right I would,” Rose wrote in his 2019 memoir. “But would I rather it had all gone down without Ray having suffered an injury that would dog his career? You bet.” Rose didn’t drink or smoke but indulged himself in other ways. He cared openly about money, vowing to become the first singles hitter to make $100,000 a year and leaving the Reds for the Phillies after declaring free agency at the end of the 1978 season (Rose returned in 1984). He was a longtime womanizer whose two marriages ended in divorce and who acknowledged fathering a child out of wedlock. In 1990, he pleaded guilty to two charges of filing false income tax returns and served five months in prison, the prosecutor calling his sentencing \"a sad day for those young Americans to whom Pete Rose was an idol.\" In the beginning, it was all about the game. He was a Cincinnati native from a working-class neighborhood whose father, Harry Francis Rose, like the father of Mickey Mantle, taught his son to be a switch hitter. Rose mastered his skills with a broom handle and a rubber ball, thrown to him by his younger brother, Dave. “I’d let him get as close as he wanted,’’ Pete Rose told The Cincinnati Enquirer in 2015. “The closer he got, the harder it was to hit. Hour after hour, he’d try to strike me out. I wore that wall out.’’ The Roses attended numerous games at Cincinnati’s Crosley Field, where the elder Rose noticed that St. Louis outfielder Enos Slaughter would always run full speed, whether at bat or in the field, and tell his son to do the same. Pete Rose graduated from high school in June 1960. He flew to Rochester, New York, two days later, and then rode a bus some 45 miles to Geneva, home of the Reds’ level D minor league team. By 1962, he had been promoted to level A, in Macon, Georgia. He batted .330 and vowed to displace Reds second baseman Don Blasingame in 1963, telling a reporter “I’m going to be on his heels.” Blasingame was with the Washington Senators by midseason and Rose was a phenomenon: “Charlie Hustle,” Yankees pitcher Whitey Ford reportedly called him, mockingly, after watching him hurry to first upon drawing a walk in spring training. Rose hit .273 as a rookie and, starting in 1965, batted .300 or higher 14 out of 15 seasons. He was so dependable that in 1968, the “Year of the Pitcher,” he led the league with a .335 average, one of three batting titles. “You could see he was going to be something, even in the minor leagues,” Dave Bristol, who managed him in the minors and for the Reds, told the Los Angeles Times in 1985. “You knew he was going to set records at something, if not Cobb’s. All that determination. He didn’t hit a ball, he attacked it. He was like a guy breaking up a dogfight. He loved to hit and hit and hit. You go to his hotel room at night, and he’s hitting the bed post.” After the 1969 season, when the Reds finished third, Bristol was fired and replaced by a minor league manager, 36-year-old Sparky Anderson. The age of “The Big Red Machine” had arrived. Anderson was known as “Captain Hook” for his willingness to replace pitchers, but he flattered and pampered his hitters, naming Rose team captain and letting Rose practice separately with Morgan, Bench and Perez. Between 1970 and 1976, the Reds won five division titles, four pennants and two World Series. As much as any player, Rose made the machine run, and not just on offense. With the Reds struggling at the start of the 1975 season, he agreed to move from left field to third base and make room for power hitter George Foster. The Reds were soon unstoppable, finishing 108-54 and sweeping Pittsburgh in the playoffs. In the World Series, one of baseball’s most dramatic, they outlasted the Boston Red Sox in seven games and won their first championship since 1940. Rose batted .370 and enjoyed himself so completely that during Game 6, won by Boston on Carlton Fisk’s 11th-inning homer, he turned to the Red Sox catcher during a previous inning and marveled at what a great game they were in. The Reds faded after the 1976 season and their World Series sweep against the Yankees, but Rose’s hits continued. In 1978, he batted safely in 44 straight games, placing him second behind Joe DiMaggio’s 56. After leaving for the Phillies in 1979, he surpassed Stan Musial as the National League’s career hit leader and helped lead Philadelphia to its first World Series title in 1980. At age 39, he batted a solid .282 and scored 95 runs, and, always hustling, made one of the World Series’ most memorable defensive plays. In the decisive Game 6 against Kansas City, the Royals trailed 4-1 going into the ninth inning, but loaded the bases with one out against reliever Tug McGraw. Kansas City’s Frank White then lofted a foul pop fly to the first base side of home plate. Catcher Bob Boone raced under it, only to have the ball pop out of his glove. Rose, sprinting in from first, snatched the ball for the out. McGraw struck out Willie Wilson to end the game. Rose played in one more World Series, in 1983, when he batted .313 even as the Phillies fell to the Baltimore Orioles in five games. He signed with the Montreal Expos in 1984, but rejoined the Reds in August as player-manager, replacing the fired Vern Rapp after the Reds acquired him in exchange for a minor leaguer. “There’s no question I’ll make some mistakes,” he told reporters. Rose had planned to limit himself to pinch-hitting with the Reds, but the trade revived him and he hit .365 over the rest of the season after batting just .259 for Montreal. He retired as a player after the 1986 season and his last game as a manager came two days before his banishment, Aug. 21, 1989, a 6-5 victory over the Chicago Cubs.

Hour after hour, he’d try to strike me out. I wore that wall out.’' The Roses attended numerous games at Cincinnati’s Crosley Field, where the elder Rose noticed that St. Louis outfielder Enos Slaughter would always run full speed, whether at bat or in the field, and tell his son to do the same. Pete Rose graduated from high school in June 1960. He flew to Rochester, New York, two days later, and then rode a bus some 45 miles to Geneva, home of the Reds’ level D minor league team. By 1962, he had been promoted to level A, in Macon, Georgia. He batted .330 and vowed to displace Reds second baseman Don Blasingame in 1963, telling a reporter “I’m going to be on his heels.” Blasingame was with the Washington Senators by midseason and Rose was a phenomenon: “Charlie Hustle,” Yankees pitcher Whitey Ford reportedly called him, mockingly, after watching him hurry to first upon drawing a walk in spring training. Rose hit .273 as a rookie and, starting in 1965, batted .300 or higher 14 out of 15 seasons. He was so dependable that in 1968, the “Year of the Pitcher,” he led the league with a .335 average, one of three batting titles. “You could see he was going to be something, even in the minor leagues,” Dave Bristol, who managed him in the minors and for the Reds, told the Los Angeles Times in 1985. “You knew he was going to set records at something, if not Cobb’s. All that determination. He didn’t hit a ball, he attacked it. He was like a guy breaking up a dogfight. He loved to hit and hit and hit. You go to his hotel room at night, and he’s hitting the bed post.” After the 1969 season, when the Reds finished third, Bristol was fired and replaced by a minor league manager, 36-year-old Sparky Anderson. The age of “The Big Red Machine” had arrived. Anderson was known as “Captain Hook” for his willingness to replace pitchers, but he flattered and pampered his hitters, naming Rose team captain and letting Rose practice separately with Morgan, Bench and Perez. Between 1970 and 1976, the Reds won five division titles, four pennants and two World Series. As much as any player, Rose made the machine run, and not just on offense. With the Reds struggling at the start of the 1975 season, he agreed to move from left field to third base and make room for power hitter George Foster. The Reds were soon unstoppable, finishing 108-54 and sweeping Pittsburgh in the playoffs. In the World Series, one of baseball’s most dramatic, they outlasted the Boston Red Sox in seven games and won their first championship since 1940. Rose batted .370 and enjoyed himself so completely that during Game 6, won by Boston on Carlton Fisk’s 11th-inning homer, he turned to the Red Sox catcher during a previous inning and marveled at what a great game they were in. The Reds faded after the 1976 season and their World Series sweep against the Yankees, but Rose’s hits continued. In 1978, he batted safely in 44 straight games, placing him second behind Joe DiMaggio’s 56. After leaving for the Phillies in 1979, he surpassed Stan Musial as the National League’s career hit leader and helped lead Philadelphia to its first World Series title in 1980. At age 39, he batted a solid .282 and scored 95 runs, and, always hustling, made one of the World Series’ most memorable defensive plays. In the decisive Game 6 against Kansas City, the Royals trailed 4-1 going into the ninth inning, but loaded the bases with one out against reliever Tug McGraw. Kansas City’s Frank White then lofted a foul pop fly to the first base side of home plate. Catcher Bob Boone raced under it, only to have the ball pop out of his glove. Rose, sprinting in from first, snatched the ball for the out. McGraw struck out Willie Wilson to end the game. Rose played in one more World Series, in 1983, when he batted .313 even as the Phillies fell to the Baltimore Orioles in five games. He signed with the Montreal Expos in 1984, but rejoined the Reds in August as player-manager, replacing the fired Vern Rapp after the Reds acquired him in exchange for a minor leaguer. “There’s no question I’ll make some mistakes,” he told reporters. Rose had planned to limit himself to pinch-hitting with the Reds, but the trade revived him and he hit .365 over the rest of the season after batting just .259 for Montreal. He retired as a player after the 1986 season and his last game as a manager came two days before his banishment, Aug. 21, 1989, a 6-5 victory over the Chicago Cubs. His career managerial record was 412-373. In his post-baseball life, he did make it to a few honorary associations. The Reds voted him into the team’s Hall of Fame in 2016, the year before a bronze sculpture of Rose’s iconic slide was unveiled outside of Cincinnati’s Great American Ball Park. Rose the man was never inducted into Cooperstown, but his career was well represented.

He was 83. Stephanie Wheatley, a spokesperson for Clark County in Nevada, confirmed on behalf of the medical examiner that Rose died Monday. Wheatley said his cause and manner of death had not yet been determined. For fans who came of age in the 1960s and ‘70s, no player was more exciting than the Cincinnati Reds’ No. 14, “Charlie Hustle,” the brash superstar with the shaggy hair, puggish nose and muscular forearms. At the dawn of artificial surfaces, divisional play and free agency, Rose was old school, a conscious throwback to baseball’s early days. Millions could never forget him crouched and scowling at the plate, running full speed to first even after drawing a walk, or sprinting for the next base and diving headfirst into the bag. A 17-time All-Star, the switch-hitting Rose played on three World Series winners. He was the National League MVP in 1973 and World Series MVP two years later. He holds the major league record for games played (3,562) and plate appearances (15,890) and the NL record for the longest hitting streak (44). He was the leadoff man for one of baseball’s most formidable lineups with the Reds’ championship teams of 1975 and 1976, with teammates that included Hall of Famers Johnny Bench, Tony Perez and Joe Morgan. But no milestone approached his 4,256 hits, breaking his hero Ty Cobb’s 4,191 and signifying his excellence no matter the notoriety which followed. It was a total so extraordinary that you could average 200 hits for 20 years and still come up short. Rose’s secret was consistency, and longevity. Over 24 seasons, all but six played entirely with the Reds, Rose had 200 hits or more 10 times, and more than 180 four other times. He batted .303 overall, even while switching from second base to outfield to third to first, and he led the league in hits seven times. “Every summer, three things are going to happen,” Rose liked to say, “the grass is going to get green, the weather is going to get hot, and Pete Rose is going to get 200 hits and bat .300.” Rose was Rookie of the Year in 1963, but he started off 0 for 12 with three walks and a hit by pitch before getting his first major league hit, an eighth-inning triple off Pittsburgh’s Bob Friend. It came in Cincinnati on April 13, 1963, the day before Rose’s 22nd birthday. He reached 1,000 in 1968, 2,000 just five years later and 3,000 just five years after that. He moved into second place, ahead of Hank Aaron, with hit No. 3,772, in 1982. No. 4,000 was off the Phillies’ Jerry Koosman in 1984, exactly 21 years to the day after his first hit. He caught up with Cobb on Sept. 8, 1985, and surpassed him three days later, in Cincinnati, with Rose’s mother and teenage son, Pete Jr., among those in attendance. Rose was 44 and the team’s player-manager. Batting left-handed against the San Diego Padres’ Eric Show in the first inning, he smacked a 2-1 slider into left field, a clean single. The crowd of 47,000-plus stood and yelled. The game was halted to celebrate. Rose was given the ball and the first base bag, then wept openly on the shoulder of first base coach and former teammate, Tommy Helms. He told Pete Jr., who would later play briefly for the Reds: “I love you, and I hope you pass me.” He thought of his late father, a star athlete himself who had pushed him to play sports since childhood. And he thought of Cobb, the dead-ball era slasher whom Rose so emulated that he named another son Tyler. Baseball Commissioner Peter Ueberroth, watching from New York, declared that Rose had “reserved a prominent spot in Cooperstown.” After the game, a 2-0 win for the Reds in which Rose scored both runs, he received a phone call from President Ronald Reagan. “Your reputation and legacy are secure,” Reagan told him. “It will be a long time before anyone is standing in the spot where you’re standing now.” Four years later, he was gone. On March 20, 1989, Ueberroth (who would soon be succeeded by A. Bartlett Giamatti) announced that his office was conducting a “full inquiry into serious allegations” about Rose. Reports emerged that he had been relying on a network of bookies and friends and others in the gambling world to place bets on baseball games, including some with the Reds. Rose denied any wrongdoing, but the investigation found that the “accumulated testimony of witnesses, together with the documentary evidence and telephone records reveal extensive betting activity by Pete Rose in connection with professional baseball and, in particular, Cincinnati Reds games, during the 1985, 1986, and 1987 baseball seasons.” Betting on baseball had been a primal sin since 1920, when several members of the Chicago White Sox were expelled for throwing the 1919 World Series — to the Cincinnati Reds. Baseball’s Rule 21, posted in every professional clubhouse, proclaims that “Any player, umpire or club or league official or employee who shall bet any sum whatsoever upon any baseball game in connection with which the bettor has a duty to perform shall be declared permanently ineligible.” In the decades following the 1919 Series, Dodgers manager Leo Durocher and Detroit Tigers pitcher Denny McLain were among those suspended for gambling, and Willie Mays and Mickey Mantle were reprimanded for associating with casinos, even though both had retired years earlier. As far back as the 1970s, Bench and others had worried about Rose. By all accounts, he never bet against his own team, but even betting on the Reds left himself open to blackmail and raised questions about whether a given managerial decision was based on his own financial interest. In August 1989, at a New York press conference, Giamatti spoke some of the saddest words in baseball history: “One of the game’s greatest players has engaged in a variety of acts which have stained the game, and he must now live with the consequences of those acts.” Giamatti announced that Rose had agreed to a lifetime ban from baseball, a decision that in 1991 the Hall of Fame would rule left him ineligible for induction. Rose attempted to downplay the news, insisting that he had never bet on baseball and that he would eventually be reinstated. Within weeks of his announcement, Giamatti was dead from a heart attack. But the ban remained in place and Rose never made it to the Hall in his lifetime, although he did receive 41 votes in 1992 (when 323 votes were needed), around the time the Hall formally ruled that those banned from the game could never be elected. His status was long debated. Rose’s supporters including Donald Trump, who in 2015, the year before he was elected president, tweeted: “Can’t believe Major League Baseball just rejected @PeteRose_14 for the Hall of Fame. He’s paid the price. So ridiculous — let him in!” Meanwhile, his story changed. In a November 1989 memoir, written with “The Boys of Summer” author Roger Kahn, Rose again claimed innocence, only to reverse himself in 2004. He desperately wanted to come back, and effectively destroyed his chances. He would continue to spend time at casinos, insisting he was there for promotion, not gambling. He believed he had “messed up” and that his father would have been ashamed, but he still bet on baseball, albeit legally. “I don’t think betting is morally wrong. I don’t even think betting on baseball if morally wrong,” he wrote in “Play Hungry,” a memoir released in 2019. “There are legal ways, and there are illegal ways, and betting on baseball the way I did was against the rules of baseball.” His disgrace was all the harder because no one seemed to live for baseball more than Rose did. He remembered details of games from long ago and could quote the most obscure statistics about players from other teams. He was as relentless in spring training as he was in the postseason, when he brawled with the New York Mets’ Buddy Harrelson during the 1973 NL playoffs. His compulsion was most memorably defined in an otherwise meaningless contest — the 1970 All-Star Game, in Cincinnati. In the bottom of the 12th inning, the score tied at 4, he singled with two outs and advanced to second on a single by Billy Grabarkewitz. When Jim Hickman followed with a single, Rose raced past third and crashed at home into the Cleveland Indians’ Ray Fosse, scoring the winning run and fracturing Fosse’s shoulder. It was a collision often replayed, and an injury from which the catcher would say years later still pained him. “Would I do the same thing again today in the same situation? Damn right I would,” Rose wrote in his 2019 memoir. “But would I rather it had all gone down without Ray having suffered an injury that would dog his career? You bet.” Rose didn’t drink or smoke but indulged himself in other ways. He cared openly about money, vowing to become the first singles hitter to make $100,000 a year and leaving the Reds for the Phillies after declaring free agency at the end of the 1978 season (Rose returned in 1984). He was a longtime womanizer whose two marriages ended in divorce and who acknowledged fathering a child out of wedlock. In 1990, he pleaded guilty to two charges of filing false income tax returns and served five months in prison, the prosecutor calling his sentencing \"a sad day for those young Americans to whom Pete Rose was an idol.\" In the beginning, it was all about the game. He was a Cincinnati native from a working-class neighborhood whose father, Harry Francis Rose, like the father of Mickey Mantle, taught his son to be a switch hitter. Rose mastered his skills with a broom handle and a rubber ball, thrown to him by his younger brother, Dave. “I’d let him get as close as he wanted,” Pete Rose told The Cincinnati Enquirer in 2015. “The closer he got, the harder it was to hit.

Pete Rose graduated from high school in June 1960. He flew to Rochester, New York, two days later, and then rode a bus some 45 miles to Geneva, home of the Reds’ level D minor league team. By 1962, he had been promoted to level A, in Macon, Georgia. He batted .330 and vowed to displace Reds second baseman Don Blasingame in 1963, telling a reporter “I’m going to be on his heels.” Blasingame was with the Washington Senators by midseason and Rose was a phenomenon: “Charlie Hustle,” Yankees pitcher Whitey Ford reportedly called him, mockingly, after watching him hurry to first upon drawing a walk in spring training.

We lead the world because, unique among nations, we draw our people – our strength – from every country and every corner of the world. And by doing so we continuously renew and enrich our nation.” That the truth Reagan spoke is obvious makes it no less important to remember, especially these days, when Donald Trump and J.D. Vance are basing their attempt to return Trump to the White House on the hope that they can gin up hatred toward immigrants. Reagan wasn’t the first American president to emphasize that all of us, other than perhaps Native Americans, are the very people whom hate-peddlers hope to demonize. “Every American who ever lived, with the exception of one group, was either an immigrant himself or a descendant of immigrants,” wrote then-Senator John F. Kennedy in his 1958 essay “A Nation of Immigrants.” Trump’s campaign speeches are blustery, falsehood-filled and increasingly indecipherable affairs, but what is clear is that he hopes to capitalize on xenophobia. Bigotry toward immigrants has persisted here for nearly 200 years, and the pitch of those hoping to exploit it has always remained the same: “Look at them, they’re different, please hate them.” It’s always been ugly, and it’s always been dumb, since virtually all of us or our forebears have been subjected to this stuff. You don’t have to look to your right and your left to see immigrants or their descendants, as both Reagan and Kennedy pointed out. You need only look in the mirror. Trump’s intensified effort to get Americans to broadly hate the “other” comes, ironically enough, in the middle of Hispanic Heritage Month, but isn’t new for him. He has repeatedly referred to those coming here from elsewhere as “animals,” part of an “invasion” that “has spread misery, crime, poverty, disease and destruction to communities all across the land.” This past weekend he accused those who enter the United States without proper documentation of wanting to “rape, pillage, thieve, plunder and kill the people of the United States.” Referring to immigrants generally, Trump repurposed the age-old demagoguery that those who came before us endured. “They can’t even speak English,” he ranted. “They don’t even know what country they’re in.” He harbors a particular animus toward Haitians, evidently. “We have hundreds of thousands of people coming in from Haiti,” Trump railed in 2021. “Many of these people will probably have AIDS and they’re coming into the country.” At his recent debate with Kamala Harris, Trump’s anti-Haitian bigotry was obscured only by his historic propensity to recite hooey. Referencing a wholly debunked rumor out of Springfield, Ohio, he claimed that Haitian residents lawfully living there “are eating the dogs. The people that came in, they’re eating the cats. They’re eating – they’re eating – they’re eating the pets of the people that live there. And this is what’s happening in our country.” Trump has quadrupled-down on this, not so much a dog whistle as a bullhorn meant to stoke irrational hatred. Springfield’s mayor and Ohio’s governor, both Republicans, pronounced Trump’s claim false. Vance admitted the same. Even Trump acolyte Vivek Ramaswamy conceded gingerly “Having gone to Springfield, I don’t see that evidence.” But real damage is being done. Springfield has been hit with over 30 bomb threats. Colleges, elementary schools and government offices have been shut down, an entire community terrorized and terrified. We are not talking about border security here. Trump has already seen to it that a bipartisan bill aimed at improving that went nowhere in Congress. We’re talking about basic human decency, and whether, going forward, America will try to honor it.

At least 121 deaths in six states have been attributed to the storm — a toll that climbed Monday as a clearer picture emerged of the devastation it inflicted on an area stretching from Florida's Gulf Coast northward to the Appalachian Mountains in Virginia. More than 600 are missing. On her SiriusXM show Monday, Kelly wondered why Harris was hobnobbing with the stars instead of tending to those left behind. 'Last night, well into the devastation, the loss of life, men, women, children, pets, the entire devastation and destruction of communities, Kamala Harris attended an LA fundraiser,' she said. The stars in sight that evening included Stevie Wonder Keegan-Michael Key, Sterling Brown, Demi Lovato, Jessica Alba, Lily, Tomlin, Alanis Morissette, and Halle Bailey. Kelly remarked: 'The devastation was ongoing. How dare she!' Harris is cancelling her planned campaign stops for Monday in order to return to Washington D.C. for briefings on Hurricane Helene. She will leave Las Vegas in the morning and be in Washington for a briefing at FEMA on Monday afternoon, according to her campaign. She will also visit the devastated areas when it won't disrupt the emergency response efforts. Kelly was no kinder to Joe Biden, who has insisted he's taken charge in the wake of the disaster while claiming he won't visit until he can avoid being a distraction. 'He spent the weekend in Delaware at his beach house, but great I'm glad that now that it's Monday and we're between 11 and 4, he's actually taking it seriously. I'm sorry, but get off your beach and get to work… He says he wants to avoid being a distraction, and therefore expects to be there later this week,' she said. 'I'm just going to say it. I don't believe him. I don't believe he's worried about being a distraction that can be an issue with presidents. I believe he's tired. He didn't get off his a** until late in this crisis.' Donald Trump has ridiculed Harris for 'pretending' to work on Hurricane Helene disaster relief in a photo posted on her social media. An image posted on Harris's X account Sunday shows the VP aboard a plane with headphones while seemingly on a call while she studiously writes on paper in front of her. The post even mentioned how she was coordinating with North Carolina's governor to help the state's recovery efforts. However, Trump pointed out a glaring issue with the photo. 'You have to plug the cord into the phone for it to work!' Trump wrote on his Truth Social app, pointing out the headphone she's wearing isn't attached to her phone on the desk. 'Another fake and staged photo from someone who has no clue what she is doing.' However, the angle of the image does not provide a sight-line to the port in the VP's phone, raising the possibility that her headphones were in fact plugged in to the device. The earphone's cord falls straight down seemingly on the VP's lap and not onto the phone one the table before her, also meaning there could be a second phone involved in this latest scandal. The photo appearing to show Harris hard at work on the phone is captioned: 'I was just briefed by [FEMA Administrator Deanne Criswell] on the latest developments about the ongoing impacts of Hurricane Helene. We also discussed our Administration's continued actions to support emergency response and recovery.' 'I also spoke with [Gov. Roy] Cooper about the ongoing rescue and recovery efforts in North Carolina,' the post continued. 'Our Administration will continue to stay in constant contact with state and local officials to ensure communities have the support and resources they need.' Harris has yet to visit any of the states impacted by the tragic and deadly storm. Trump, on the other hand, went to Valdosta, Georgia, to tour damage done by Helene on Monday afternoon. He spoke to those impacted by the storm and helped distribute goods to those in attendance. The former president, in addition to ripping her for the 'staged' photo, slammed Harris for letting Americans drown. 'Biden and Harris abandoned Americans in Afghanistan,' Trump's post continued. 'They sacrificed Americans to an Open Border, and now, they have left Americans to drown in North Carolina, Georgia, Tennessee, Alabama, and elsewhere in the South.' Biden said he expects to visit the areas devastated by Hurricane Helene this week as he defended spending the weekend at his beach house when the storm hit. 'I've told the governor of North Carolina I'll go down and I expect to be down there by Wednesday or Thursday when it is clear for me,' he told reporters at the White House. 'I'm committed to traveling to impacted areas as soon as possible, but I've been told that it would be disruptive if I did it right now,' he noted. The president became defensive when asked how he was in command while spending the weekend at his Rehoboth Beach vacation home while the hurricane was devastating parts of the South. 'I was commanding, I was on the phone for at least two hours yesterday, and the day before, as well. I commanded, it's called a telephone,' he said. He noted he spoke with the governors of Georgia and North Carolina, two of the states hardest hit by the storm. Roads and I-64, a major interstate, have been wiped out in parts of these areas, making it difficult to bring in necessary supplies. Local and federal officials, along with the National Guard, are racing to bring relief. More than 460,000 people are without power and more than 1,000 had taken refuge in 24 shelters. Search and rescue teams from 19 states and the US government have converged on North Carolina, Gov. Roy Cooper said, adding that some roads could take months to repair. Damage estimates ranged from $15billion to more than $100billion, insurers and forecasters said over the weekend, as water systems, communications and critical transportation routes were affected. Property damage and lost economic output will become clearer as officials assess the destruction. Roughly 2.7 million customers throughout the South were without power on Sunday, a US Energy Department official said, down 40 per cent from Friday after unprecedented storm surges, ferocious winds and perilous conditions extended hundreds of miles inland.","summary":"Megyn Kelly trashed Kamala Harris for attending a fundraiser full of Hollywood elites instead of heading to the areas affected by Hurricane Helene.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-13909095/Megyn-Kelly-blasts-Kamala-attending-star-studded-fundraiser-hurricane-disaster.html?ns_mchannel=rss&ns_campaign=1490&ito=1490","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2024/09/30/23/90289831-0-image-m-15_1727737129908.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-30 23:41:42","author":"Editor,Stephen M.

Overall, Silver's forecast on Monday found that Trump improved by 0.7 percentage points in Pennsylvania and 0.4 percentage points in Michigan over the past week.Harris still leads in both battleground states on average, although Silver noted that there is a clear gap between state polling and the vice president's overall lead across national polls. While Harris is up 3.2 points on Trump as of Monday, per Silver's tracking, she is only ahead by 1.2 points in Pennsylvania on average. Similarly, in Michigan, Harris is up by 1.8 points.Silver noted in Monday's edition of the Silver Bulletin that the gap is a sign that the Electoral College \"is still a big net disadvantage for Democrats.\" Nevertheless, Silver's model still favors Harris to win the necessary 270 electoral votes in November, giving her a 55.1 percent chance of victory this fall. In comparison, as of Monday, Trump was given a 44.7 percent chance of winning a second term in the White House.Harris also maintains a slight lead across national polls per FiveThirtyEight's tracking, which finds the vice president up 48.5 percent to 45.7 percent on average as of Monday afternoon. With less than 40 days until Election Day, the race is much too close to call a clear winner.The 2024 race is set up to be one of the closest presidential races in U.S. history, and experts are closely watching the contests in seven states in the final weeks, although as FiveThirtyEight's Geoffrey Skelley wrote in a report on Monday, the results in November will likely eventually come down to a single \"tipping-point\" state: Pennsylvania.\"Looking at 538's forecast, the most likely tipping-point state across all scenarios for the 2024 election is Pennsylvania,\" Skelley wrote. \"In 18 out of 100 cases, the Keystone State provides the winning electoral votes for either Harris or Trump.\"Silver also predicts Pennsylvania has the highest chance—31 percent—of tipping the election.","summary":"Both Michigan and Pennsylvania shifted toward former President Trump over the past week, per Silver's election model.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/nate-silver-latest-projection-shows-key-swing-state-shifts-1961694","image":"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2484143/nate-silver-key-swing-state-shifts.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-30 23:36:42","author":"Kaitlin Lewis","authors":["Kaitlin Lewis"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.232},{"id":257999414,"title":"Hundreds Missing in Mountain Towns as Historic Flooding and Destruction Follow Hurricane Helene | Capitol Report","text":"Sep-30-2024 We have the latest on the federal response to Hurricane Helene and how the death toll could be much higher than anticipated.

It was revealed earlier this month that Romeo had reportedly left his Premier League football club, despite being offered a new contract by Brentford FC in June, to pursue a fashion career. The middle Beckham son, 22, looked stylish as he walked the show in a blue striped polo shirt and a pair of baggy jeans. He completed his ensemble with a pair huge silver moon boot shoes and visor-style sunglasses. Also in attendance for the show was Amelia Gray Hamlin, who looked chic in an oversized black trench coats and wide-leg pants.

Fully committing to fashion, Romeo recently signed with top Paris fashion agency Safe Management. A promising football prospect in his youth, Romeo drifted away from the game after being released by Arsenal in 2015 and turned his attention towards a career in tennis. However, Romeo announced he intended on a return to football in 2020 before joining dad David's MLS franchise Inter Miami the following year. Romeo's first big break in the fashion world came when he was just 10-years-old as he took his first modelling assignment for Burberry. Following in his mother's footsteps from a young age, Romeo was undaunted on set as was described 'amazing, incredible and a little joy' who kept everyone entertained as he was 'bouncing around'. His passion for fashion was cemented from an early age as he accompanied Victoria on shoots and mingling amongst a host of top designers. A favourite of the brand, Romeo returned to film a Christmas advert with the designer two years later as he wore the classic Burberry trench along with a smart Burberry scarf and umbrella.

In 2015 the child star was ranked at 25th in the prestigious best-dressed list, outshining his famous father who only managed 46th. Romeo added another string to his bow when he released his debut cover shoot with celebrated fashion bible L’Uomo Vogue back in 2021. Collaborating with fashion photographers Mert Alas and Marcus Piggott, the collection of shots captured Romeo modelling a mixture of designer and vintage clothing. Sporting platinum blonde locks, Romeo modelled a bespoke look created exclusively by stylist Louis Ghewy. In keeping with the shoot's notably casual theme, the teenager wears an oversized green cardigan and grey joggers, teamed with distinctive black leather boots from Italian fashion house Prada. Romeo unveiled his modelling campaign for GQ Korea back in 2022 when he featured on the cover of the magazine. The star, who was then 19, looked a natural on the black-and-white cover as he sported a denim waistcoat.

The stylist opted for thick white socks to be pulled up over Romeo's trouser leg, as he slipped into a pair of cream laced shoes. Romeo is also a regular in attendance at the British Fashion Awards after making his first joint red carpet appearance with his former girlfriend Mia Regan at the event back in 2021. Romeo displayed his modelling prowess as he posed for PUMA's launch of the 180 sneaker collection back in August 2023. The star rocked a double denim co-ord for the shoot consisting of a faded denim jacket and a pair of baggy faded denim jeans. Donning a plain white vest underneath Romeo showcased the brand's iconic white sneaker which featured panels of brown corduroy for a luxe feel.

It was revealed earlier this month that Romeo had reportedly left his Premier League football club, despite being offered a new contract by Brentford FC in June, to pursue a fashion career. The middle Beckham son, 22, looked stylish as he walked the show in a blue striped polo shirt and a pair of baggy jeans. He completed his ensemble with a pair huge silver moon boot shoes and visor-style sunglasses. Also in attendance for the show was Amelia Gray Hamlin, who looked chic in an oversized black trench coats and wide-leg pants.

After the show, Romeo enjoyed a dinner at Hotel Costes in the French capital - continuing to rep Balenciaga in a pair of grey tracksuit bottoms and an oversized hoodie. Romeo Beckham took to the Paris Fashion Week catwalk for the Balenciaga show on Monday as he cemented his foray into fashion The middle Beckham son, 22, looked stylish as he walked the show in a blue striped polo shirt and a pair of baggy jeans He also donned a black beanie hat and light purple trainers to complete his look. Fully committing to fashion, Romeo recently signed with top Paris fashion agency Safe Management. A promising football prospect in his youth, Romeo drifted away from the game after being released by Arsenal in 2015 and turned his attention towards a career in tennis. However, Romeo announced he intended on a return to football in 2020 before joining dad David's MLS franchise Inter Miami the following year. Romeo's first big break in the fashion world came when he was just 10-years-old as he took his first modelling assignment for Burberry. Following in his mother's footsteps from a young age, Romeo was undaunted on set as was described 'amazing, incredible and a little joy' who kept everyone entertained as he was 'bouncing around'. His passion for fashion was cemented from an early age as he accompanied Victoria on shoots and mingling amongst a host of top designers. A favourite of the brand, Romeo returned to film a Christmas advert with the designer two years later as he wore the classic Burberry trench along with a smart Burberry scarf and umbrella. After the show, Romeo enjoyed a dinner at Hotel Costes in the French capital - continuing to rep Balenciaga He sported a pair of grey tracksuit bottoms and an oversized hoodie Also in attendance for the show was Amelia Gray Hamlin, who looked chic in an oversized black trench coats and wide-leg pants Her appearance came days after her and Romeo were spotted sneaking out of a London Fashion Week bash Then at just 12-year-old Romeo made his debut in the GQ's best-dressed men list - 21 places above his father. In 2015 the child star was ranked at 25th in the prestigious best-dressed list, outshining his famous father who only managed 46th. Romeo added another string to his bow when he released his debut cover shoot with celebrated fashion bible L’Uomo Vogue back in 2021. Collaborating with fashion photographers Mert Alas and Marcus Piggott, the collection of shots captured Romeo modelling a mixture of designer and vintage clothing. Sporting platinum blonde locks, Romeo modelled a bespoke look created exclusively by stylist Louis Ghewy. In keeping with the shoot's notably casual theme, the teenager wears an oversized green cardigan and grey joggers, teamed with distinctive black leather boots from Italian fashion house Prada. Romeo unveiled his modelling campaign for GQ Korea back in 2022 when he featured on the cover of the magazine. The star, who was then 19, looked a natural on the black-and-white cover as he sported a denim waistcoat. Romeo's first big break came when he was just 10-years-old as he took his first modelling assignment for Burberry At just 12-year-old Romeo made his debut in the GQ's best-dressed men list - 21 places above his father Fully committing to fashion, Romeo has signed with top Paris fashion agency Safe Management, leaving behind his career at Brentford He rocked a white knitted vest and a pair of light blue baggy denim jeans For a second look, which his Inter Miami CF president father gushed he 'loved so much', Romeo threw a candid pose dressed in a black lace shirt tucked into complementary trousers. The stylist opted for thick white socks to be pulled up over Romeo's trouser leg, as he slipped into a pair of cream laced shoes. Romeo is also a regular in attendance at the British Fashion Awards after making his first joint red carpet appearance with his former girlfriend Mia Regan at the event back in 2021. Romeo displayed his modelling prowess as he posed for PUMA's launch of the 180 sneaker collection back in August 2023. The star rocked a double denim co-ord for the shoot consisting of a faded denim jacket and a pair of baggy faded denim jeans. Donning a plain white vest underneath Romeo showcased the brand's iconic white sneaker which featured panels of brown corduroy for a luxe feel.

Earlier on Monday, Trump suggested that Biden and North Carolina Governor Roy Cooper were ignoring the devastation wrought by the storm, which has killed over 100 people and left hundreds missing and unaccounted for in the Tar Heel state. In a Truth Social post, Trump wrote that he “[didn’t] like the reports” he was allegedly getting about the federal and state governments “going out of their way to not help people in Republican areas” hit by the hurricane. Asked to respond as he addressed reporters after receiving a briefing from Cooper and Federal Emergency Management Agency administrator Deanne Criswell in the Oval Office, Biden interjected, cutting off the question from The Independent to denounce Trump’s false statements. “He's lying, and the governor told him he was lying. The governor told me he was lying. I've spoken to the governor, I spent time with him, and he told me he's lying. I don't know why he does this,” he said. Biden added that he doesn’t care what Trump says about him, but he stressed that what he cares about is ”what he communicates to people that are in need” when he “implies that we're not doing everything possible.” “We are,” he said. “I assume you heard the Republican governor of Georgia talk about that. He was on the phone with me more than once. So that's simply not true, and it's irresponsible.” Biden also told reporters he would visit North Carolina to survey damage on Wednesday. He previously said he was holding off on making the trip to the storm-ravaged state until he could be sure traveling there would not divert resources needed for the response and recovery efforts. On Monday, government officials and aid groups worked to get supplies to stranded residents in hard-hit areas.

Brian Kemp was “having a hard time getting the president on the phone,” adding it’s “irresponsible” of Trump to imply “that we're not doing everything possible” to help the victims of Hurricane Helene, which ravaged southern states over the weekend.

(Photo by Kent Nishimura/Getty Images) Getty Images Key Facts Trump told reporters Monday in Georgia “the federal government is not being very responsive” and alleged Kemp was having a hard time reaching Biden—despite Kemp previously saying he had spoken to Biden, who he said told him “if there’s [anything else] we need just to call him directly.” “I get so angry about it,” Biden said of Trump’s claims, adding “I don't care about what he says about me, but I care what he communicates to the people that are in need.” The president went on to say: “He implies that we're not doing everything possible. We are.” Trump has been slamming the government’s response to Helene, accused Biden of “sleeping” instead of responding to people in need and criticized Vice President Kamala Harris for not immediately traveling to damaged areas.

Surprising Fact Despite Trump’s criticism of Biden and Harris not getting to the disaster zones sooner, two former FEMA directors told Politico on Monday it’s often better to wait in situations like this, and The Washington Post also spoke to disaster experts who said it can be complicated to visit too soon after because of how presidential travel and logistics can disrupt response efforts. Key Background Hurricane Helene made landfall in Florida’s Big Bend as a Category 4 storm on Thursday before northward, bringing “historic and catastrophic flooding” to the southern Appalachians. The storm killed more than 130 people, according to the Associated Press, and the death toll is expected to continue rising. An estimated 2 million people were still without power on Monday afternoon, CNN reported, and hundreds of people across six southern states—Georgia, Florida, North Carolina, South Carolina, Virginia and Tennessee—were reportedly still unaccounted for.

The Drye's were pictured by their daughter Megan who along with her seven-year-old son, Micah, had clambered to the rooftop of their Asheville home as the house was slowly consumed by the storm waters. The couple in their 70s can be seen dressed in regular clothes, wearing coat and a backpack with a couple of blankets for comfort. 'They are watching 18 wheelers and cars floating by. In addition, part of the house they're sitting on is in front of them. They've called 911 but they aren't the only ones needing rescue. This is definitely a moment when faith is all you have,' wrote Megan's sister Jessica Drye. A tragic final photo has emerged of grandparents sitting on the roof of their North Carolina home surrounding by raging floodwaters as they waited for rescuers to arrive Their daughter Meghan took this photo moments before the entire home collapsed killing the couple and their grandson Seven-year-old Micah was with his grandparents when he drowned. His mother, Megan Drye, was able to survive after she became wedged between something, stopping her drowning Tragically the pair, along with their grandson drowned after the roof eventually gave way no longer able to withstand the force of the torrent. Somehow Megan managed to survive after she became trapped between something and was able to keep her head above water. She was rescued one hour later and is now recovering in intensive care. Detailing the encounter on Facebook, sister Jessica shared her sadness at what had happened. 'I cannot convey in words the sorrow, heartbreak and devastation my sisters and I are going through nor imagine the pain before us. Please lift my sister who lost her son up in prayers and my other sister and myself as we come together to somehow comfort her and get through each moment banded together.' The destruction and desperation across North Carolina in particular appears to be unimaginable. The destruction and desperation across North Carolina in particular appears to be unimaginable. A part of Asheville is pictured The North Carolina mountain town of Asheville has faced a massive amount of destruction following Hurricane Helene Flood damage caused by the storm that hit Asheville, North Carolina can be seen from above A flattened cargo container sat atop a bridge crossing a river with muddy brown water. Overturned pontoon boats and splintered wooden docks and tree trunks covered the surface of a picturesque lake tucked between the mountains. The North Carolina death toll included one horrific story after another of people who were trapped by floodwaters in their homes and vehicles or were killed by falling trees. A courthouse security officer died after being submerged inside his truck. Rescuers did manage to save dozens, including an infant and two others stuck on the top of a car in Atlanta. More than 50 hospital patients and staff in Tennessee were plucked by helicopter from the hospital rooftop in a daring rescue operation. Those Western North Carolina residents who survived Helene faced a 'post-apocalyptic' landscape on Monday, with hundreds of people still missing and residents struggling amid flooded roads and a lack of basic services. More than 128 deaths across a half-dozen states have been attributed to the powerful storm that slammed into Florida's Big Bend region late on Thursday before cutting a destructive path through Georgia and into the Carolinas. The federal government has declared a major disaster for 25 North Carolina counties, promising aid and reimbursement for local agencies A thick layer of mud blankets the entire area in Swannanoa, North Carolina Homes have been torn from foundations, thrown upside-down or split in half in Swannanoa The once-picturesque town now lies in ruins. Cars can be seen perched in tree limbs along the flooded Swannanoa River As many as 600 people remain missing, U.S. Homeland Security adviser Liz Sherwood-Randall said at the White House, though she noted that the numbers could vary as responders reach more locations. Either way, the death toll is likely to rise, officials said. Residents in devastated communities found themselves isolated by flooded roads and a lack of running water, power and cell phone service. In mountainous Buncombe County, which includes the popular tourist destination of Asheville, 35 people have died The county was set to begin distributing food and water to residents later in the day. Some supplies had to be airlifted to the region with most major routes blocked by mudslides and flooding. 'They're running out of gas for ATVs that are helping the rescue, they're also running out of gas for the chainsaws,' said Colleen Burns, 58, whose house is near Burnsville, in neighboring Yancey County. 'We desperately need gas.' The brutal onslaught of Hurricane Helene has left the small mountain town of Swannanoa, North Carolina , in ruins - with locals describing the community as 'entirely erased' Volunteers stage water for people in the aftermath of Hurricane Helene, in Asheville A gas natural gas tank lies with other debris on a train bridge in the aftermath of Hurricane Helene in Asheville Carrie Owenby looks at her phone as a neighbor with power dropped an extension cord for neighbors who have no power in the aftermath of Hurricane Helene in Asheville Volunteers stage water for citizens in the aftermath of Helene in Asheville A worker moves debris in the aftermath of Hurricane Helene in Asheville Debris is seen in the aftermath of Hurricane Helene, in Asheville People wait to get water at Mountain Valley Water in the aftermath of Helene in West Asheville Flood debris from Hurricane Helene floats by in Rutherford County, North Carolina Elsewhere in Yancey, the storm snapped century-old trees around the home of Taylor Shelton, 44. It took her husband two days with a chainsaw to cut a passage through the felled trees in their driveway and the nearby road so they could drive themselves and their three children out of the darkened house.

The National Guard and emergency workers from 19 states have been deployed to help, along with Federal Emergency Management Agency personnel.

The Drye's were pictured by their daughter Megan who along with her seven-year-old son, Micah, had clambered to the rooftop of their Asheville home as the house was slowly consumed by the storm waters. The couple in their 70s can be seen dressed in regular clothes, wearing coat and a backpack with a couple of blankets for comfort. 'They are watching 18 wheelers and cars floating by. In addition, part of the house they're sitting on is in front of them. They've called 911 but they aren't the only ones needing rescue. This is definitely a moment when faith is all you have,' wrote Megan's sister Jessica Drye. A tragic final photo has emerged of grandparents sitting on the roof of their North Carolina home surrounding by raging floodwaters as they waited for rescuers to arrive Their daughter Meghan took this photo moments before the entire home collapsed killing the couple and their grandson Seven-year-old Micah was with his grandparents when he drowned. His mother, Megan Drye, was able to survive after she became wedged between something, stopping her drowning Tragically the pair, along with their grandson drowned after the roof eventually gave way no longer able to withstand the force of the torrent. Somehow Megan managed to survive after she became trapped between something and was able to keep her head above water. She was rescued one hour later and is now recovering in intensive care. Detailing the encounter on Facebook, sister Jessica shared her sadness at what had happened. 'I cannot convey in words the sorrow, heartbreak and devastation my sisters and I are going through nor imagine the pain before us. Please lift my sister who lost her son up in prayers and my other sister and myself as we come together to somehow comfort her and get through each moment banded together.' The destruction and desperation across North Carolina in particular appears to be unimaginable. The destruction and desperation across North Carolina in particular appears to be unimaginable. A part of Asheville is pictured The North Carolina mountain town of Asheville has faced a massive amount of destruction following Hurricane Helene Flood damage caused by the storm that hit Asheville, North Carolina can be seen from above A flattened cargo container sat atop a bridge crossing a river with muddy brown water. Overturned pontoon boats and splintered wooden docks and tree trunks covered the surface of a picturesque lake tucked between the mountains. The North Carolina death toll included one horrific story after another of people who were trapped by floodwaters in their homes and vehicles or were killed by falling trees. A courthouse security officer died after being submerged inside his truck. Rescuers did manage to save dozens, including an infant and two others stuck on the top of a car in Atlanta. More than 50 hospital patients and staff in Tennessee were plucked by helicopter from the hospital rooftop in a daring rescue operation. Those Western North Carolina residents who survived Helene faced a 'post-apocalyptic' landscape on Monday, with hundreds of people still missing and residents struggling amid flooded roads and a lack of basic services. More than 128 deaths across a half-dozen states have been attributed to the powerful storm that slammed into Florida's Big Bend region late on Thursday before cutting a destructive path through Georgia and into the Carolinas. The federal government has declared a major disaster for 25 North Carolina counties, promising aid and reimbursement for local agencies A thick layer of mud blankets the entire area in Swannanoa, North Carolina Homes have been torn from foundations, thrown upside-down or split in half in Swannanoa The once-picturesque town now lies in ruins. Cars can be seen perched in tree limbs along the flooded Swannanoa River As many as 600 people remain missing, U.S. Homeland Security adviser Liz Sherwood-Randall said at the White House, though she noted that the numbers could vary as responders reach more locations. Either way, the death toll is likely to rise, officials said. Residents in devastated communities found themselves isolated by flooded roads and a lack of running water, power and cell phone service. In mountainous Buncombe County, which includes the popular tourist destination of Asheville, 35 people have died The county was set to begin distributing food and water to residents later in the day. Some supplies had to be airlifted to the region with most major routes blocked by mudslides and flooding. 'They're running out of gas for ATVs that are helping the rescue, they're also running out of gas for the chainsaws,' said Colleen Burns, 58, whose house is near Burnsville, in neighboring Yancey County. 'We desperately need gas.'

I don't know why he does it... that's simply not true, and it's irresponsible.\"At least 118 people were killed by the storm and associated flooding -- 49 in North Carolina, 25 in South Carolina, 25 in Georgia, 14 in Florida, four in Tennessee and one in Virginia, according to tallies from local authorities compiled by AFP.Emergency workers continued a grim search for hundreds of people still unaccounted for across the affected states, where torrential rains brought widespread havoc.They also worked to restore water and power supply to the affected areas, remove fallen trees, deliver supplies and register people for disaster assistance.The death toll was expected to rise, authorities warned, with cell phone service knocked out across much of the region and up to 600 people still missing.With Biden preparing to head to North Carolina, Trump on Monday arrived in Georgia, another epicenter of the destruction -- and both are among the key swing states where the US election will be decided in just five weeks' time.In the city of Valdosta, Georgia, Trump vowed to \"bring lots of relief material, including fuel, equipment, water, and other things\" to those in need.\"The federal government is not being responsive,\" he told reporters. \"The vice president, she's out someplace, campaigning, looking for money,\" he said, referring to his election rival, Vice President Kamala Harris.\"We're not talking about politics now,\" he said later, wearing a bright red \"Make America Great Again\" hat while standing in the rubble of a furniture store.Democrat Harris, canceled campaign events to return to Washington Monday for a briefing on the federal response.\"Over the past few days, our nation has endured some of the worst destruction and devastation that we have seen in quite some time,\" Harris said following the briefing.\"And we have responded with our best, with the best folks who are on the ground and here doing the kind of work that is about rising to a moment of crisis.\"Responding to Trump's criticism that he was \"sleeping\" instead of dealing with the storm damage, Biden defended his decision to spend the weekend at his home in Delaware, saying he was working \"the whole time.\"When a major natural disaster hits the United States, the federal government responds at the request of states. A president's role is usually to oversee and coordinate aid, including funding.Scientists say climate change likely plays a role in the rapid intensification of hurricanes, because there is more energy in warmer oceans for them to feed on, and Biden stressed as much Monday.\"Absolutely, positively, unequivocally, yes, yes, yes, yes,\" Biden told reporters in the Oval Office when asked if climate change was to blame for the trail of destruction left by the storm.The sheriff's office in Pinellas County, Florida, published a grim litany of the nine lives lost there so far, almost all of whose bodies were found in their homes.Nearly all appeared to have drowned, it said, describing some found still lying in several inches of water, while others were buried under debris.In Georgia, residents faced power cuts, supply shortages, blocked roads and broken communication lines in often mountainous terrain, with Governor Brian Kemp describing the storm as a \"250-mile wide tornado.\"Close to two million households and businesses remained without power on Monday, according to tracker poweroutage.us.Cooper, the North Carolina governor, said Monday that hundreds of roads had been destroyed and many communities were \"wiped off the map.\"\"This is an unprecedented storm,\" he told reporters. \"The emotional and physical toll here is indescribable.\"Cooper, a Democrat, also thanked Biden for providing federal personnel and resources.","summary":"The death toll from a devastating storm that battered the southeastern United States climbed to 118 on Monday, as the disaster became a hot topic in an already bitter election campaign, with the White House angrily refuting claims it had been slow to respond.","url":"https://www.ibtimes.com.au/118-dead-hurricane-helene-biden-defends-us-government-response-1852023","image":"https://d.ibtimes.com.au/en/full/1860972/people-wait-line-gasoline-aftermath-hurricane-helene-september-29-2024-fletcher-north.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-30 23:03:13","author":"John Falchetto","authors":["John Falchetto"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"au","sentiment":-0.159},{"id":257998720,"title":"UK firms growing in the US as presidential election looms large","text":"Business activity between the UK and the US has ramped up this year, new data showed, as firms shrug off uncertainty ahead of the American presidential election.

NBC said Monday that 5.3 million people watched the premiere live, the best opening for the show since 2020, when Alec Baldwin reprised his role as then-President Donald Trump and Chris Rock hosted with musical guest Megan Thee Stallion. The sketch comedy show welcomed back several alums this weekend for its opening skit about this year's U.S. presidential race, with Maya Rudolph playing Kamala Harris and Dana Carvey playing President Joe Biden. The episode is the most-watched “SNL” ever on Peacock in its first weekend, NBC said. Jean Smart hosted the 50th season premiere and country sensation Jelly Roll was the musical guest. The opening sketch could be a preview of the season ahead, with alum Andy Samberg returning to play Harris' husband, Doug Emhoff, and actor-comedian Jim Gaffigan playing Harris' running mate, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz. Only Rudolph as Harris was expected, although “SNL” hadn't confirmed she would reprise the role. The first “SNL” episode aired Oct. 11, 1975, with Lorne Michaels at the helm, just as he is now. George Carlin hosted then and the show introduced its first cast of the so-called Not Ready for Prime Time Players: Chevy Chase, John Belushi, Gilda Radner, Dan Akroyd, Jane Curtin, Laraine Newman and Garrett Morris. Comedian Nate Bargatze is hosting this weekend's “SNL,” with Coldplay appearing as the musical guest. NBC will air a three-hour live “SNL” celebration on Feb. 16 to mark the anniversary.","summary":"The 50th season of “Saturday Night Live” is off to a strong ratings start and is a record-breaker for the streaming service Peacock","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/nbc-ap-alec-baldwin-megan-thee-stallion-new-york-b2621657.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2024/10/01/00/SNL-50th-Season-Premiere_38349.jpg?width=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-30 23:00:44","author":"Via AP news wire","authors":["Via AP news wire"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":0.024},{"id":257997276,"title":"Letters: S.J.

George, with his experience as a San Jose planning commissioner, attorney and real estate professional, is the right person to deliver that change. His diverse background gives him a unique perspective on housing, economic development and the future of our city. George understands District 10’s concerns and has the skills to tackle them head on. He listens, values transparency and has a clear plan to address public safety, support local businesses and resolve housing issues. It’s time for a leader with the experience and vision to make real progress. Casey is that leader. Nicholas Adams San Jose Trump would be bad for students with loans The rising cost of education at San Jose State University, and universities nationwide, could worsen if Donald Trump is elected president. Trump has consistently criticized President Joe Biden’s efforts to provide student debt relief, calling them “vile” and “not even legal.” At a recent rally in Wisconsin, Trump reiterated his plan to eliminate the Department of Education if reelected. This would significantly impact students, potentially increasing their debt burdens, which could take years to repay. It would also harm teachers, public defenders, first responders and others. Younger generations must recognize the potential consequences of Trump’s presidency, particularly with student loan debt in America. Ryan Vivian San Jose Patriotic Republicans should vote Democrat This letter is for the Republicans who know better and still support Donald Trump. Are you proud of a man so immature that he constantly calls out anyone who slights him with derogatory names characteristic of a third-grader? Are you proud of the tens of thousands of lies he has spewed out over the past eight years? Are you proud of his cognitive decline (Bagram is an airbase in Afghanistan not Alaska)? Are you proud of the fact that your support will be complicit in destroying our democracy and installing a fascist/authoritarian government if Trump wins in November? Voting for Kamala Harris doesn’t make you a Democrat but a patriot in the words of former Georgia Republican Lieutenant Governor Geoff Duncan. Can you put the love of your country before party and personal interests? Do you have the courage to be a patriot? I hope so. Our democracy depends on it.

Even though I’ve voted both sides of the aisle, when my candidate of choice lost, there was no doubt in my mind, not a reasonable doubt, but no doubt, a peaceful transition of power would take place; that the country would be in the hands of a patriot, a person who, if not managing things to my personal liking, would protect and honor our Founding Father’s idea of how a democracy should and can work in the hands of caring civil servants. I did not worry about freedom of the press or how the winner might take action against his enemies, both real and imagined. Our elections, with very few exceptions, have always been about the economy, taxes, wars and immigration. Democracy has never been on the ballot.

Want to level up your entertainment career? Go here for more information. “SNL” kicked off its 50th season with the biggest premiere audience the NBC show has seen since 2020. The Season 5o premiere of “SNL,” which aired on Sept. 28, scored a viewership of 5.3 million on NBC, according to Nielsen live-plus-same-day viewing figures, outpacing viewership for “SNL” season premieres for Seasons 47-49. The episode als ranks as the most-watched “SNL” ever on Peacock in its first weekend on the streamer. Viewership for the Season 50 premiere was up 10.4% from the Season 49 of “SNL,” which debuted its first post-strike episode to an audience of 4.8 million viewers. “SNL” Season 46 premiered in 2020 to 7.77 million total viewers as it saw Jim Carrey play Joe Biden, Maya Rudolph play Kamala Harris and Alec Baldwin portray Donald Trump. Four years later, the cold open for Season 50 saw Rudolph return as Harris, while Dana Carvey played Biden, Jim Gaffigan played VP candidate Tim Walz, and Andy Samberg played Harris’ husband, Doug Emhoff. The “SNL” Season 50 debut was hosted by “Hacks” star Jean Smart, who recently won her sixth Emmy for her performance as Deborah Vance in “Hacks,” and featured Jelly Roll as the episode’s musical guest. “SNL” is set to return on Oct. 5 with Nate Bargatze hosting and Coldplay serving as the musical guest. Ariana Grande, Michael Keaton and John Mulaney have already been announced as hosts for subsequent episodes this fall, with already announced musical guests including Stevie Nicks, Billie Eilish and Chappell Roan. Bargatze hosted an episode of “SNL” last fall, which brought in 4.9 million viewers, which was, at the time, the most-watched new installment of the show since December 10, 2022, when “Only Murders in the Building” stars and “SNL ” alum Steve Martin and Martin Short hosted. “SNL” broadcasts at 11:30 p.m. ET/ 8:30 p.m. PT on NBC and streams live on Peacock.

Consider that the Pact, with over 56 action points, only has one provision on sexual and reproductive health. The two annexes are silent on this thematic area. Although the three texts are to be considered jointly, and therefore all encompassing, thematic areas such as climate and conflict are widely provided for across the three texts – and in some cases, repeated. While the sustained threats of climate and conflict are indeed crucial, the lopsided advancement of some goals and the relegation of others will ultimately result in the non-realization of our collective goals for people and planet. Alarmingly, over 30 countries, all who adopted the Pact – and therefore committed to securing reproductive health, are signatories to the Geneva Consensus Declaration (GCD). This is a regressive anti-abortion declaration that was initiated by anti-gender activist Valerie Huber, former advisor to ex-US President Donald Trump in the US Department of Health and Human Services, who erroneously claimed that there is no international right to abortion. Even though, this right is explicitly provided for in international legal frameworks including the UN Convention on the Elimination of all forms of Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW); and the Protocol to the African Charter on Human and Peoples' Rights on the Rights of Women in Africa – commonly referred to as the Maputo Protocol. Additionally, the right to abortion has been determined by international human rights mechanisms including the UN Human Rights Committee, the European Court of Human Rights, the Inter-American Court of Human Rights, and the African Commission on Human and Peoples' Rights. Further, the Geneva Consensus Declaration, encourages countries to hide under the principle of sovereignty to ‘release' countries from their obligations under international law. This ideological position goes against the thrust of the Pact of the Future that seeks to renew trust in multilateralism and promote international cooperation. We already know that subscription to the realist school of thought has led to some of the world's worst crises including the historical great wars and the raging wars across Africa, the Middle East, Eastern Europe and beyond. The Geneva Consensus Declaration in advancing this position is therefore an affront to the progress made under international relations towards peace and development. Even so, a country like Kenya maintains its signature on the Declaration – that contravenes its own national laws. The Constitution provides for the right to the highest attainable standard of reproductive health. Further, there are provisions therein that guarantee access to safe abortion in certain instances. This has been buttressed by case law, notably in the decision in Constitutional Petition E009 of 2020, which strongly affirmed that abortion care is a fundamental right under the Constitution of Kenya and outlawed arbitrary arrests and prosecution of patients and healthcare providers for seeking or offering such services. Kenya must therefore rescind its signature on this document that contravenes national and international laws and which conflicts with its foreign policy positions. While the GCD is not legally binding, it could form the basis of how future norms begin. In fact, Valerie Huber through the Institute for Women's Health has launched a mechanism called Protego to operationalize the Declaration. Additionally, has been engaged in campaigns targeted at the First Ladies of African countries in a bid to secure their countries' political commitments on the Declaration. Consequently, Chad and Burundi recently signed onto it; expanding its reach. It must therefore be challenged to stop it from becoming the primary basis for encoding anti-abortion ideology into international law. Following the Summit of the Future and on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly, governments and philanthropies committed US$350 million in new investments for sexual and reproductive health services. While this is welcome in securing these rights, it does not cover the financing gap on SRHR. This vacuum includes crucial funding needs to mitigate the threats of the well-resourced and coordinated anti-gender/ anti-rights movement that misleadingly weaponize family values towards negating human rights. Moreover, it is crucial that the commitments convert to actual disbursements that benefit the intended recipients. As gears switch from negotiations and adoption of the Pact of the Future, countries must withdraw their signatures on this Declaration and align their foreign policy positions with their domestic and international legal obligations. More so, together with philanthropies, civil society and private sector through the imPACT coalitions – designed to drive reforms and proposals toward the Summit of the Future and thereafter the implementation process of the Pact, must consider the deleterious impact of the anti-gender / anti-rights movement on advancing the development agenda; and formulate strategies to mitigate their footprint. These must include the universal withdrawal from the GCD. Until then, women and girls – more so in low- and middle-income countries, will continue to die preventable deaths annually, from complications arising from unsafe abortions.

Fulton County Superior Court Judge Robert McBurney wrote in his order that the law violates Georgia’s Constitution, finding that “liberty in Georgia includes in its meaning, in its protections, and in its bundle of rights the power of a woman to control her own body, to decide what happens to it and in it, and to reject state interference with her healthcare choices.” When the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in 2022 and ended a national right to abortion, it opened the door for state bans. Thirteen states now bar abortion at all stages of pregnancy, with some exceptions. Georgia was one of four where bans begin after about the first six weeks of pregnancy — often before women realize they’re pregnant. McBurney’s ruling would allow abortions through at least 20 weeks of pregnancy. Kara Murray, a spokesperson for Georgia Attorney General Chris Carr, said he would immediately appeal to the state supreme court. The state high court earlier reversed a separate ruling by McBurney that had struck down the law on different grounds and could put Monday’s ruling on hold pending an appeal. “We believe Georgia’s life act is fully constitutional,” Murray said. The bans have been felt deeply in the South because many people live hundreds of miles from states where abortion procedures can be obtained legally. If the Georgia ruling stands, it could open new avenues to access abortion not only in Georgia, but for people in nearby states. Georgia’s law was passed by state lawmakers and signed by Republican Gov. Brian Kemp in 2019 but it was initially blocked from taking effect until the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade, which had protected the right to an abortion for nearly 50 years. Kemp has in the past tried to soften its political impact by trying to focus on the health of mothers. Monday, he attacked the ruling. “Once again, the will of Georgians and their representatives has been overruled by the personal beliefs of one judge,” Kemp said in a statement. “Protecting the lives of the most vulnerable among us is one of our most sacred responsibilities, and Georgia will continue to be a place where we fight for the lives of the unborn.” Carol Tobias, president of the National Right to Life Committee, called the ruling “ridiculous.” “This judge is an activist judge who is ignoring higher court rulings to do what he wants,” she said in an interview. “And I don’t think it’s going to stand.” Monica Simpson, executive director of SisterSong Women of Color Reproductive Justice Collective, one of the plaintiffs in the lawsuit, celebrated the ruling. “Since we’ve seen these direct attacks here in the South, in particular, on abortion access, we have been in a deep defensive posture for a really long time,” she said. “It feels like our work has not been in vain.” While carafem, an abortion provider in Atlanta, plans to expand its services as permitted over the next several weeks, co-founder Melissa Grant said she fears a reversal. “Staff and clients will be living with this possibility hanging over immediate change, and that can be devastating to people who are trying to plan their lives and try to take care of their health,” Grant said. Kwajelyn Jackson, executive director of Feminist Women’s Health Center, another Atlanta abortion provider, said they “will not be turning patients away based on the presence or absence of fetal cardiac activity, and so for as long as we are able, we’re hopeful that we’ll be able to care for patients who need services from us.” Georgia’s law prohibited most abortions once a “detectable human heartbeat” was present. Cardiac activity can be detected by ultrasound in an embryo’s cells that will eventually become the heart at around six weeks into a pregnancy. Before the law kicked in, there were more than 4,400 abortions each month in Georgia. That has dropped a monthly average of about 2,400 since the ban began in 2022 according to data from the Society of Family Planning. The ruling means the law in the state reverts to its prior status, allowing abortions until roughly 20 weeks into a pregnancy, McBurney wrote. The right to privacy in the Georgia Constitution includes the right to make personal healthcare decisions, he wrote. “When a fetus growing inside a woman reaches viability, when society can assume care and responsibility for that separate life, then — and only then — may society intervene,” McBurney wrote. An “arbitrary six-week ban” on abortions “is inconsistent with these rights and the proper balance that a viability rule establishes between a woman’s rights of liberty and privacy and society’s interest in protecting and caring for unborn infants,” the order says. Claire Bartlett, executive director of the Georgia Life Alliance, expressed confidence that the Georgia Supreme Court would again overturn McBurney, saying he wrongly attempted “to create a right to abortion out of whole cloth by finding that it resides in our Constitution.” “It’s just ironic that based on his decision on Georgia’s constitutional protection against a person being deprived of life, liberty or property, which is what the argument was, that he chose to focus on a woman’s right to liberty rather than the child’s right to life,” Bartlett said. In part because Georgia has no way for citizens to place initiatives on the ballot, there’s no referendum on abortion rights scheduled for Georgia’s election this year. But Democrats have focused on abortion as they appeal to women and suburbanites. On Sept. 20, Vice President Kamala Harris visited Atlanta to cast Republican Donald Trump as a threat to women’s freedom and lives, warning Trump would limit abortion access even more if reelected. It’s also a key issue in state legislative races as Democrats try to cut into Republican majorities. Harris’ visit came after ProPublica reported that two women in the state died after they didn’t get proper medical treatment for complications from taking abortion pills to end their pregnancies. Democrats argue such deaths were a predictable outcome of restrictive laws Harris has been outspoken on abortion rights ever since the Supreme Court’s decision more than two years ago.

In April, California Attorney General Rob Bonta and Secretary of State Shirley Weber sued Huntington Beach to invalidate the law, arguing the local measure violated state voting protections.\"The right to freely cast your vote is the foundation of our democracy, and Huntington Beach's voter ID policy flies in the face of this principle,\" Bonta said in a statement when the lawsuit was filed.The new measure, which becomes effective on January 1, 2025, makes California one of 14 states that do not require voter ID for elections, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures.Authored by state Senator Dave Min, the legislation was passed by the California Assembly and Senate earlier this year. Min, a Democrat running for Congress, introduced the bill so local governments cannot impose their own voter ID rules, which he said disproportionately affect low-income, elderly and minority voters.\"We cannot have 100 different charter cities making up 100 different sets of voting rules based on fringe conspiracy theories,\" Min said in a statement to the Los Angeles Times.Huntington Beach, led by a Republican city council, has defended its voter ID law, saying its status as a charter city gives it authority over local elections. The state's lawsuit challenged that position, arguing that state laws take precedence.\"The right to freely cast your vote is the foundation of our democracy and Huntington Beach's voter ID policy flies in the face of this principle,\" Bonta said in an April statement about the lawsuit.California's Democratic lawmakers have introduced multiple bills aimed at closing loopholes in election laws, particularly to prevent conservative-leaning places like Shasta County from adopting voter ID or other restrictive measures.This legislative push comes in response to broader national debates over voter fraud, which intensified after the 2020 presidential election. Efforts to impose voter ID requirements or eliminate electronic voting machines, such as those attempted in Shasta County, are part of a movement spurred by baseless claims of election fraud made by former President Donald Trump and his supporters.Min's bill is part of a larger strategy to ensure consistent voting rights protections across California. Other recently passed legislation includes measures to increase the secretary of state's control over voting systems and ensure election data security.Despite ongoing legal battles, Huntington Beach officials have yet to formally respond to the state's lawsuit.","summary":"The new law aims to curb conservative efforts in cities like Huntington Beach, where a voter ID requirement was passed in March.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/gavin-newsom-bans-california-requiring-id-vote-1961685","image":"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2484131/gavin-newsom.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-30 22:52:17","author":"Jesus Mesa","authors":["Jesus Mesa"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.081},{"id":257996506,"title":"Georgia judge overturns state’s six-week ban on abortions","text":"Fulton County Superior Court Judge Robert McBurney declared that Georgia’s 2019 heartbeat bill was unconstitutional because “a review of our higher courts’ interpretations of ‘liberty’ demonstrates that liberty in Georgia includes in its meaning, in its protections, and in its bundle of rights the power of a woman to control her own body.” When the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in 2022 and gave control over abortion laws back to the states, a bill signed by Gov. Brian Kemp (R-GA) went into effect. The legislation effectively prohibited the termination of pregnancies after a heartbeat is detected. Under McBurney’s ruling, women will be able to obtain an abortion until the point of viability, at roughly 20-24 weeks, or when the baby is able to survive outside the womb. McBurney said his decision would allow women to “reject state interference” with what he described as “healthcare choices.” “That power is not, however, unlimited,” he wrote in a 26-page ruling. “When a fetus growing inside a woman reaches viability, when society can assume care and responsibility for that separate life, then — and only then — may society intervene.” Kemp slammed the ruling on Monday for overturning “the personal beliefs” of Georgia residents. “Once again, the will of Georgians and their representatives have been overruled by the personal beliefs of one judge,” Garrison Douglas, a spokesman for the governor’s office told WABE. “Protecting the lives of the most vulnerable among us is one of our most sacred responsibilities.” The superior court’s ruling will likely face an appeal from anti-abortion groups who have already blasted the “activist” judge’s decision. “Our team is reviewing this atrocious activist ruling that denies the humanity of unborn children with beating hearts & would legalize late-term abortions in Georgia,” Susan B.

During the pair’s first presidential debate earlier this month, Trump accused Harris of taking a “radical” stance on abortion and said her running mate, Gov. Tim Walz (D-MN), supported “abortion in the ninth month.” There is no evidence Walz has done this. Meanwhile, Harris has alleged Trump will sign a national ban on abortion into law if he wins a second term.

(Photo by Noam Galai/Getty Images) Getty Images When Sunday night rolled around, fans of the legendary animated primetime television series The Simpsons were left in disbelief after what they thought was the show's \"final episode.\" Can you imagine? No more Julie Kavner? The voice of Marge Simpson? Social media exploded with confusion, only to reveal that it was actually the kickoff to Season 36. Why should we care? Safe to say, few shows have managed to stay as culturally relevant as The Simpsons. Created by Matt Groening, with contributions from James L. Brooks and Sam Simon, this satirical television series has spanned over thirty years with nearly 1000 individual episodes. Produced by 20th Television, The Simpsons has entertained audiences not just with its regular characters like Bart Simpson, Lisa Simpson, and Grampa Simpson, but also with tertiary characters who contribute to the richness of its world. The show provides sharp insights into society, politics, and human nature, all through the lens of a dysfunctional working-class American family.

[+] 2023 in Los Angeles, California (Photo by Lisa O'Connor/Variety via Getty Images) Variety via Getty Images For brands looking to resonate with their audiences, I believe there are four key lessons to learn from the series—especially when it comes to audience engagement and brand relevance. Harness Humor and Satire: At its essence, The Simpsons teaches us the importance of humor and satire. The show, with guidance from key contributors like Matt Selman, James L. Brooks, and Sam Simon, brilliantly critiques societal issues and pop culture from the viewpoint of a working-class family. The show also includes one-time jokes and visual jokes that add layers to the humor, keeping audiences engaged. For brands, this reinforces the immense potential of humor in marketing. When delivered thoughtfully, humor can make messaging more relatable and shareable, compelling audiences to engage with the brand on a deeper level. Sure, some may argue that brands need to tread carefully—that humor must align with a brand's identity to prevent misinterpretation or backlash. But I believe that this fear is holding CMOs back from embracing humor.

(Photo by Charlotte Tattersall/Getty Images) Getty Images Create Relatable Characters: The characters that populate The Simpsons—created by Matt Groening—are exaggerated yet profoundly relatable. Who doesn’t love Bart Simpson's mischievous nature or Lisa Simpson's thoughtful idealism? And that’s before we get to Grampa Simpson’s old-school charm and absurd storytelling that add to the family’s lovable dynamic. These regular characters personify various aspects of society, from the endearing underdog to the clueless patriarch—and most importantly, we can all relate to them. For brands, it’s vital to craft relatable personas or archetypes. When audiences see themselves reflected in a brand's narrative or characters, it breeds loyalty and engagement. As I said, in my book, The Kim Kardashian Principle, by emphasizing the human element—or the dysfunctional family—brands can create connections that go beyond mere transactions. Deloitte reports that 57% of consumers are more loyal to brands that actively address social inequities in their practices. Furthermore, 70% of Gen Z consumers are more likely to trust brands that showcase diversity in their advertising efforts.

(Photo by Patrick Smith/Getty Images) Getty Images Stay Relevant and Adaptable: One of the most admirable traits of The Simpsons is its uncanny ability to evolve with the times. The show, spearheaded by Matt Groening’s creative vision, deftly addresses current events and cultural shifts, adapting to ensure its content remains pertinent. This was evident during episodes from season 22, and it continues now with its 36th season. Produced by 20th Television, the series remains one of the longest-running satirical television series in American history, and its approach resonates with viewers young and old. There is no doubt in my mind that The Simpsons has managed to remain relevant alongside other satirical television series like Family Guy, by reflecting cultural trends. This ability to evolve is one of the reasons The Simpsons, an American LGBTQ-related animated television series, has endured for so long. And let’s not forget the show’s tertiary characters, one-time jokes, and clever visual jokes. Matt Groening’s creative genius, combined with the contributions from L. Brooks and Sam Simon, gives The Simpsons the ability to appeal to both a broad audience and niche communities. Matt Zoller also recognizes these dynamics in his praise of the show’s layered narrative and cultural impact. Family Guy may have its moments, but I’d say it’s The Simpsons, with its deep well of individual episodes and carefully crafted episode credits, that has set the bar for American family comedies and satirical television series.ues, further cementing its cultural relevance. Matt Zoller, a prominent critic, even praised the show’s inclusiveness and its subtle commentary on identity. This dedication to staying relevant and helps build a strong community around the show. I’ve said it before I’ll say it again, in a marketplace that’s constantly changing, being in tune with cultural trends and consumer sentiment is essential. This means not only reacting to current events but also anticipating shifts in consumer behavior and values to maintain alignment with audiences. Yet a surprising 30% of employees still express skepticism about change but are open to being shown its benefits by managers or peers. Additionally, 73% of employees undergoing change report experiencing moderate to high stress levels.

[+] (Photo by Costfoto/NurPhoto via Getty Images) NurPhoto via Getty Images Cultivate a Strong Community The Simpsons has fostered a dedicated and enthusiastic fan base that engages with the show on various levels and across multiple platforms—from merchandise to fan theories. As an American LGBTQ-related animated television series, The Simpsons has tackled diverse and important societal issues, cementing its cultural relevance. Matt Zoller, a prominent critic, praised the show’s inclusiveness and its subtle commentary on identity. His review echoes the sentiments of many fans who have followed episodes from season to season, including the show's 22nd season and current 36th season. Brands must tap into this community spirit by nurturing connections among their audiences. Engaging on social media, promoting user-generated content, and offering platforms for consumer interaction can cultivate brand loyalty and advocacy. Remember, a vibrant community not only bolsters brand perception but also fuels word-of-mouth marketing and long-term growth. And while Family Guy may compete for animated comedy dominance, I believe The Simpsons remains a force. With individual episodes racking up critical acclaim and episode credits across the board, The Simpsons demonstrates that a consistent approach—focused on humor, social relevance, and community—can cement any brand’s legacy. Whether it's Bart Simpson causing chaos or the episodes from season after season addressing societal issues, The Simpsons shows that longevity in any industry comes from listening to your audience and evolving alongside them. Currently, 70.41% of brands have established active communities, while another 26.3% are eager to create their own communities soon. Remarkably, only 3.29% of brands lack a community and have no plans to form one. This trend sends a clear message: brand communities are set to become a defining aspect of the future landscape.

Brooks, and Sam Simon—offers invaluable lessons in brand engagement. By embracing humor, crafting relatable characters like Bart Simpson, staying relevant, and building a strong community, brands can elevate their marketing strategies and forge deeper connections with their audiences. All this to say, the wisdom from this iconic primetime television series—brought to life by talents like Julie Kavner, Yeardley Smith, and the creative guidance of Matt Groening’s team—serves as a powerful reminder of what is essential for fostering lasting brand loyalty. Produced by 20th Television, the show continues to inspire marketers and creators alike. The series has proven through its episodes of season after season—including the 22nd season and now the 36th season—that storytelling, especially from a human or in this case working-class family perspective, is timeless.

Here’s what he said: ‘It is unacceptable and disgusting that in our time of need, cellular service for the entire region is blocked out. There’s no excuse for that.

Is this something that is going to be more and more normal as we see more and more devastating storms? What do you say to people who are desperate to find whether the people they love are still alive?” The Homeland Security secretary lamented that the communications infrastructure needed improvement. “Well, I understand the concerns that are expressed. These are people in the midst of a tragic hurricane. That is precisely why we and others have been deploying communications resources to ensure that communication is reinstated as quickly as possible,” Mayorkas responded. “The reality is that the severity and frequency of extreme weather events are only increasing.

After widespread criticism of the communications problems following the hurricane, Homeland Security adviser Liz Sherwood-Randall announced Monday that FEMA would “install 30 Starlink receivers in western North Carolina to provide immediate connectivity for those in greatest need.” Former President Donald Trump said Monday that he had spoken to billionaire Elon Musk about helping with communication resources for the victims of Hurricane Helene. “Elon will always come through,” said Trump.","summary":"Biden administration Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas addressed concerns about the lack of communication resources in the aftermath of Hurricane Helene, blaming the increasing &#8220;severity and frequency of extreme weather events.&#8221; During Mayorkas&#8217;s appearance on MSNBC&#8217;s Chris Jansing Reports Monday, host Chris Jansing asked him about criticisms regarding failing communications infrastructure, including cellular service outages, [&#8230;]","url":"https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/policy/energy-and-environment/3171935/mayorkas-climate-change-communication-resources-hurricane/","image":"https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Mayorkas.webp","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-30 22:47:53","author":"Heather Hunter","authors":["Heather Hunter"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.385},{"id":257999280,"title":"Hailey Bieber enjoys girls' night with Kendall Jenner - amid claims husband Justin is 'stressed' over Diddy allegations","text":"Home News Royals U.S. Sport TV Showbiz Femail Health Science Money Travel Podcasts Shopping Best Buys Discounts My Profile Logout Login Headlines Showbiz Kim Kardashian Victoria Beckham Harry Styles Amanda Holden Britain's Got Talent My Profile Logout Login Privacy Policy Feedback Monday, Sep 30th 2024 1AM 8°C 4AM 8°C 5-Day Forecast Advertisement Israel goes in: IDF confirms boots on the ground in southern Lebanon as bombs rain fire from the sky after day of ratcheting tensions saw Netanyahu warn Iran NOWHERE in Middle East is out of reach Giovanni Pernice reveals toll Strictly bullying probe has taken on him as 'relieved' star looks to put 'extremely difficult year' behind him after being cleared of majority of allegations John Simm left 'questioning everything' after discovering he and his father were not biologically related during emotional episode of ITV's DNA journey: 'It spun my world out!'

The 27-year-old model, who welcomed her son Jack Blues with husband Justin Bieber in August, appeared in high spirits as she and the 28-year-old reality star headed to a sushi restaurant for a relaxed outing. Dressed in a cozy gray cardigan, the beauty pulled her sandy blonde hair back into a sleek bun as she made her way into Sushi Park in West Hollywood. Kendall followed closely behind in a black trench coat, showing off her newly dyed platinum hair. Both friends kept a low profile, sporting sunglasses as they made their way inside. The outing comes amid reports that Justin is determined to block out growing rumors about his connection with Sean 'Diddy' Combs, choosing instead to focus on his role as a first-time dad. Hailey Bieber took a break from her new role as a mom , stepping out with her best friend Kendall Jenner in Hollywood on Sunday The 27-year-old model, who welcomed her son Jack Blues with husband Justin Bieber in August, appeared in high spirits as she and the 28-year-old reality star headed to a sushi restaurant for a relaxed outing Read More Shirtless Justin Bieber pictured in bizarre outfit for church - amid fears for his health Combs, 54, was arrested in New York last week on charges of coercion and abuse. Following the indictment, Justin's past close relationship with the rapper has come under scrutiny, with resurfaced videos showing a 15-year-old Bieber spending '48 hours with Diddy' and partying together. Bieber hasn't addressed the situation publicly, but fans have expressed concern about his noticeably 'thin' appearance. Now sources tell DailyMail.com that the singer feels he has no one to talk to about the Diddy revelations and is 'sailing these waters alone.' 'Justin feels like there is no one that he can talk to that understands and, to be honest, he doesn't even fully understand,' the insider explained. 'He was a kid.' The source added that the fallout comes amid his current struggles to try and be a good parent having not had the best example from his own father, Jeremy Bieber. 'Justin is stressed right now,' the insider continued. 'He has a baby boy and trying to be a good dad without having anything to reference what a good father is.' Speaking to the fragile singer's emotional state, the source added: 'He is sailing these waters alone and everyone fears that if Hailey shows any struggles with being a first time mom then this is going to be incredibly difficult for Justin. Kendall followed closely behind in a black trench coat, showing off her newly dyed platinum hair Both friends kept a low profile, sporting sunglasses as they made their way inside Kendall and Hailey have been close friends for years, often spotted enjoying vacations together and attending major fashion events side by side The two bonded over their shared modeling careers and high-profile families, frequently posting about their adventures on social media 'Diddy could not have happened at a worse time as he is trying to experience the joy of being a father with the pain of having to deal with all of this.' Bieber announced the birth of his first child on August 23, and gave fans a glimpse of the baby's tiny foot and wife Hailey's hands. 'WELCOME HOME JACK BLUES BIEBER,' the proud dad penned in the caption. The former Victoria's Secret model also shared the post on her Instagram Story with the youngster's name and various emojis. It came just weeks before Combs was accused of inducing female victims and male sex workers into drugged-up, sometimes days-long sexual performances referred to as 'Freak Offs.' According to the indictment, he would allegedly use force, threats and coercion to get the women to engage with male sex workers in the 'Freak Offs,' described as 'elaborate and produced sex performances' arranged and directed by Combs while he masturbated and often recorded them. The indictment further stated that some 'Freak Offs' would last for days, requiring Combs and victims to receive IV fluids to recover from the exertion and drug use. Diddy pleaded not guilty to charges against him and was denied bail, despite his legal team's request for him to be released for $50 million and kept electronically monitored. Whether hitting the runway or relaxing on tropical getaways, they remain inseparable, with Kendall even serving as a bridesmaid at Hailey's wedding to Justin The outing comes amid reports that Justin is determined to block out growing rumors about his connection with Sean 'Diddy' Combs , choosing instead to focus on his role as a first-time dad Hailey and Justin's romance began as a close friendship, which eventually blossomed into a full-blown relationship in 2016 After a brief split, they rekindled their love in 2018 and quickly became inseparable, getting engaged in the Bahamas just a few months later Dressed in a cozy gray cardigan, the beauty pulled her sandy blonde hair back into a sleek bun as she made her way into Sushi Park in West Hollywood The couple officially tied the knot in a private courthouse ceremony in New York that same year, followed by a lavish second wedding in South Carolina in 2019 Hailey and Justin welcomed their son Jack in August Kendall has kept her love life relatively private, though she has been linked to several high-profile figures, including NBA stars Ben Simmons and Devin Booker Hailey's father is actor Stephen Baldwin Combs' lawyer, Marc Agnifilo, said the 'Freak Offs' stemmed from the star's former on-again-off-again relationship with R&B singer Cassie, and were not coercive. Prosecutors said they had interviewed more than 50 victims and witnesses, and are expecting the number to grow. Bieber was just a child when he forged a friendship with Combs, and the singer most recently featured on the rapper's track Moment, which appeared on his 2023 album The Love Album: Off the Grid. Following the album's release last October, Bieber reflected on his first encounter with Combs. 'I remember going to my brother Diddy's office to pitch him a song I wrote for him when I was like 14,' he wrote on Instagram. 'Sadly the song was trash haha and it would be a hard no from him.' He continued: 'Fast forward to a few years ago Puff asked if I would freestyle something for his upcoming love album. Wild full circle moment, love you @diddy.' Bieber, 30, was just a child when he forged a friendship with Combs (Pictured in 2010) An insider told DailyMail.com: 'There is no one that he can talk to that understands and, to be honest, he doesn't even fully understand. He was a kid' The source added: 'Diddy (seen in 2022) could not have happened at a worse time as he is trying to experience the joy of being a father with the pain of having to deal with all of this' An insider previously revealed to DailyMail.com that Bieber deeply regrets having collaborated with the disgraced mogul last year, and would never have done so had he known the allegations that have since come to light. They continued: 'He had a long break from Diddy when he believes most of this took place and he had distanced himself from him. 'He was featured on Diddy's most recent album, and had he known any of this, there is no way he would have done it.' In March, old clips of Bieber and Combs resurfaced shortly after Homeland Security raided the music mogul's properties in Miami and Los Angeles. One video saw Combs standing next to the young pop sensation, aged 15, while telling the camera: 'He's having 48 hours with Diddy, where we hanging out and what we're doing we can't really disclose. 'But it's definitely a 15-year-old's dream.' The hip hop star added: 'I have been given custody of him. He's signed to Usher and I had legal guardianship of Usher when he did his first album. 'I don't have legal guardianship of him [Bieber] but for the next forty-eight hours he's with me and we're gonna go full crazy.' Creepy footage of Combs and Bieber first reemerged online after the rapper's properties were raided as part of the ongoing sex trafficking investigation earlier this year Bieber, wearing a black baseball cap and purple shirt smiles and looks up at Combs throughout the video, making small comments such as 'yeah' and 'full crazy.' The video was posted to social media and triggered an outpouring of criticism and concern. Another resurfaced clip saw the rapper grilling a 16-year-old Bieber on why he hadn't been speaking to him as much. 'What's up man, you good? Selling out arenas and everything?' Combs asked the youngster. 'Starting to act different, huh? You haven't been calling me and hanging out the way we used to hang out.' Bieber appeared anxious as he responded to his musical colleague. 'I mean you tried to get in contact with me throughout all my... and what not... but you never got my number,' he said. 'I'm going to tell you my number.' One clip showed a 16-year-old Bieber appearing anxious as he responded to Combs' questions Another insider previously revealed to DailyMail.com that Bieber has been completely 'thrown' by the harrowing allegations and is grappling to make sense of them - especially given that he collaborated with Combs less than a year ago. The source said of the fragile singer: 'Bieber is so disturbed by the Diddy news and is unwilling to process it or discuss it so he has shut off. 'So many people who helped to make him who he is were very close to Diddy and it has completely thrown him. 'Justin hasn't been responding on this since the home raids. He's not going to.'

The 27-year-old model, who welcomed her son Jack Blues with husband Justin Bieber in August, appeared in high spirits as she and the 28-year-old reality star headed to a sushi restaurant for a relaxed outing. Dressed in a cozy gray cardigan, the beauty pulled her sandy blonde hair back into a sleek bun as she made her way into Sushi Park in West Hollywood. Kendall followed closely behind in a black trench coat, showing off her newly dyed platinum hair. Both friends kept a low profile, sporting sunglasses as they made their way inside. The outing comes amid reports that Justin is determined to block out growing rumors about his connection with Sean 'Diddy' Combs, choosing instead to focus on his role as a first-time dad. Hailey Bieber took a break from her new role as a mom , stepping out with her best friend Kendall Jenner in Hollywood on Sunday The 27-year-old model, who welcomed her son Jack Blues with husband Justin Bieber in August, appeared in high spirits as she and the 28-year-old reality star headed to a sushi restaurant for a relaxed outing Read More Shirtless Justin Bieber pictured in bizarre outfit for church - amid fears for his health Combs, 54, was arrested in New York last week on charges of coercion and abuse. Following the indictment, Justin's past close relationship with the rapper has come under scrutiny, with resurfaced videos showing a 15-year-old Bieber spending '48 hours with Diddy' and partying together. Bieber hasn't addressed the situation publicly, but fans have expressed concern about his noticeably 'thin' appearance. Now sources tell DailyMail.com that the singer feels he has no one to talk to about the Diddy revelations and is 'sailing these waters alone.' 'Justin feels like there is no one that he can talk to that understands and, to be honest, he doesn't even fully understand,' the insider explained. 'He was a kid.' The source added that the fallout comes amid his current struggles to try and be a good parent having not had the best example from his own father, Jeremy Bieber. 'Justin is stressed right now,' the insider continued. 'He has a baby boy and trying to be a good dad without having anything to reference what a good father is.' Speaking to the fragile singer's emotional state, the source added: 'He is sailing these waters alone and everyone fears that if Hailey shows any struggles with being a first time mom then this is going to be incredibly difficult for Justin. Kendall followed closely behind in a black trench coat, showing off her newly dyed platinum hair Both friends kept a low profile, sporting sunglasses as they made their way inside Kendall and Hailey have been close friends for years, often spotted enjoying vacations together and attending major fashion events side by side The two bonded over their shared modeling careers and high-profile families, frequently posting about their adventures on social media 'Diddy could not have happened at a worse time as he is trying to experience the joy of being a father with the pain of having to deal with all of this.' Bieber announced the birth of his first child on August 23, and gave fans a glimpse of the baby's tiny foot and wife Hailey's hands. 'WELCOME HOME JACK BLUES BIEBER,' the proud dad penned in the caption. The former Victoria's Secret model also shared the post on her Instagram Story with the youngster's name and various emojis. It came just weeks before Combs was accused of inducing female victims and male sex workers into drugged-up, sometimes days-long sexual performances referred to as 'Freak Offs.' According to the indictment, he would allegedly use force, threats and coercion to get the women to engage with male sex workers in the 'Freak Offs,' described as 'elaborate and produced sex performances' arranged and directed by Combs while he masturbated and often recorded them. The indictment further stated that some 'Freak Offs' would last for days, requiring Combs and victims to receive IV fluids to recover from the exertion and drug use. Diddy pleaded not guilty to charges against him and was denied bail, despite his legal team's request for him to be released for $50 million and kept electronically monitored. Whether hitting the runway or relaxing on tropical getaways, they remain inseparable, with Kendall even serving as a bridesmaid at Hailey's wedding to Justin The outing comes amid reports that Justin is determined to block out growing rumors about his connection with Sean 'Diddy' Combs , choosing instead to focus on his role as a first-time dad Hailey and Justin's romance began as a close friendship, which eventually blossomed into a full-blown relationship in 2016 After a brief split, they rekindled their love in 2018 and quickly became inseparable, getting engaged in the Bahamas just a few months later Dressed in a cozy gray cardigan, the beauty pulled her sandy blonde hair back into a sleek bun as she made her way into Sushi Park in West Hollywood The couple officially tied the knot in a private courthouse ceremony in New York that same year, followed by a lavish second wedding in South Carolina in 2019 Hailey and Justin welcomed their son Jack in August Kendall has kept her love life relatively private, though she has been linked to several high-profile figures, including NBA stars Ben Simmons and Devin Booker Hailey's father is actor Stephen Baldwin Combs' lawyer, Marc Agnifilo, said the 'Freak Offs' stemmed from the star's former on-again-off-again relationship with R&B singer Cassie, and were not coercive. Prosecutors said they had interviewed more than 50 victims and witnesses, and are expecting the number to grow. Bieber was just a child when he forged a friendship with Combs, and the singer most recently featured on the rapper's track Moment, which appeared on his 2023 album The Love Album: Off the Grid. Following the album's release last October, Bieber reflected on his first encounter with Combs. 'I remember going to my brother Diddy's office to pitch him a song I wrote for him when I was like 14,' he wrote on Instagram. 'Sadly the song was trash haha and it would be a hard no from him.' He continued: 'Fast forward to a few years ago Puff asked if I would freestyle something for his upcoming love album. Wild full circle moment, love you @diddy.' Bieber, 30, was just a child when he forged a friendship with Combs (Pictured in 2010) An insider told DailyMail.com: 'There is no one that he can talk to that understands and, to be honest, he doesn't even fully understand. He was a kid' The source added: 'Diddy (seen in 2022) could not have happened at a worse time as he is trying to experience the joy of being a father with the pain of having to deal with all of this' An insider previously revealed to DailyMail.com that Bieber deeply regrets having collaborated with the disgraced mogul last year, and would never have done so had he known the allegations that have since come to light. They continued: 'He had a long break from Diddy when he believes most of this took place and he had distanced himself from him. 'He was featured on Diddy's most recent album, and had he known any of this, there is no way he would have done it.' In March, old clips of Bieber and Combs resurfaced shortly after Homeland Security raided the music mogul's properties in Miami and Los Angeles. One video saw Combs standing next to the young pop sensation, aged 15, while telling the camera: 'He's having 48 hours with Diddy, where we hanging out and what we're doing we can't really disclose. 'But it's definitely a 15-year-old's dream.' The hip hop star added: 'I have been given custody of him. He's signed to Usher and I had legal guardianship of Usher when he did his first album. 'I don't have legal guardianship of him [Bieber] but for the next forty-eight hours he's with me and we're gonna go full crazy.' Creepy footage of Combs and Bieber first reemerged online after the rapper's properties were raided as part of the ongoing sex trafficking investigation earlier this year Bieber, wearing a black baseball cap and purple shirt smiles and looks up at Combs throughout the video, making small comments such as 'yeah' and 'full crazy.' The video was posted to social media and triggered an outpouring of criticism and concern. Another resurfaced clip saw the rapper grilling a 16-year-old Bieber on why he hadn't been speaking to him as much. 'What's up man, you good? Selling out arenas and everything?' Combs asked the youngster. 'Starting to act different, huh? You haven't been calling me and hanging out the way we used to hang out.' Bieber appeared anxious as he responded to his musical colleague. 'I mean you tried to get in contact with me throughout all my... and what not... but you never got my number,' he said. 'I'm going to tell you my number.' One clip showed a 16-year-old Bieber appearing anxious as he responded to Combs' questions Another insider previously revealed to DailyMail.com that Bieber has been completely 'thrown' by the harrowing allegations and is grappling to make sense of them - especially given that he collaborated with Combs less than a year ago. The source said of the fragile singer: 'Bieber is so disturbed by the Diddy news and is unwilling to process it or discuss it so he has shut off. 'So many people who helped to make him who he is were very close to Diddy and it has completely thrown him. 'Justin hasn't been responding on this since the home raids. He's not going to.'

On Monday, New York City’s first indicted sitting mayor moved to dismiss the federal bribery charge against him, citing that recent Supreme Court precedent, called Snyder v. United States. “Just three months ago, the Supreme Court rebuked the Justice Department for adopting an ‘unfathomable’ interpretation of the federal-program bribery statute,” the Democratic mayor’s lawyers wrote in their trial court motion, citing the Snyder case. “Yet here goes the Department again,” they argued, surmising that: Arguing that “the government’s makeover doesn’t work,” Adams’ lawyers wrote: They concluded the 25-page filing by writing: Now, this is the type of argument that the Supreme Court has embraced in recent years — not just in the Snyder case but also in a string of appeals dating back at least to the 2016 ruling in favor of former Virginia Gov. Bob McDonnell that narrowed corruption-related prosecutions. It’s too early to know whether Adams, who has pleaded not guilty, will be able to successfully harness that judicial skepticism to get out of his indictment, which we’re all still digesting. But however heavy-handed the defense argument sounds, it’s the sort of claim that Adams’ lawyers would be foolish not to make, given the state of the law and the Supreme Court. The Justice Department will get to respond to Adams’ motion, and federal prosecutors will likely disagree with both the defendant’s understanding of the law and how it applies to the facts of his case. (Adams’ motion only concerns the bribery allegation, and we should expect him to separately challenge the other charges in the indictment, including those related to allegedly illegal campaign contribution dealings.) Indeed, prosecutors probably aren’t too surprised at Adams’ argument. At least they shouldn’t be. In strategizing the case, they likely will have considered the charges against the backdrop of how they would fare on an inevitable appeal if there’s a conviction. But however damning the allegations against the mayor may seem, the justices seemingly stand ready to save white-collar defendants from charges that might possibly be seen as criminalizing politics, however shady that politics is.

J.D. Vance, who’s shrugged off debate prep, should not underestimate Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz ahead of Tuesday night’s face-off, a fellow North Star State ex-lawmaker warns. And he should know — he had to become Walz when he played the gov in GOP gubernatorial debate practice. Tuesday night is the first and likely only time the vice-presidential hopefuls will wrangle before the election. Walz, 60, was key in framing the Democratic narrative around Donald Trump and Vance as “weird,” while Vance, 40, has attacked Kamala Harris’ running mate on stolen-valor claims. Marty Seifert, former Minnesota House minority leader and 2010 and 2014 gubernatorial candidate, has a unique perspective on Walz’s skills — he stood in for the Democrat in debate prep for his unsuccessful Republican challenger, Scott Jensen, two years ago. In a phone call with The Post, he predicted Walz is going to appeal to the average voter Tuesday night — and Vance will lose if he sticks with canned talking points. That might be just what the Republican plans to do, though. Vance has publicly brushed off debate prep, as The Post reported last week: “We have well-developed views on public policy, so we don’t have to prepare that much,” he said. Seifert urged Vance to stay away from personal attacks and focus on substance and, most important, the “average American.” “He needs to talk about middle America — the mainstream not the extreme,” he advised. “Vance has an opportunity if he knows how to use it.” One example: Minnesota had the largest surplus in state history, and under Walz’s leadership it was spent — and taxes were raised. Much of the state’s $17.5 billion surplus in 2023 was used for one-time funding of new and existing programs, including child tax credits, tax rebates and exemptions, free college tuition and green energy. “That’s not where the average person is. If you had a surplus I think you’d want moderation,” Seifert noted. Seifert thinks Walz’s handling of the George Floyd unrest in the Twin Cities is another weak point Vance could exploit, as the governor has been blamed for a delayed response to the rioting, something the “Hillbilly Elegy” author has pointed out before. Seifert joked he’s “probably the only guy in any state that has played Tim Walz,” and he’s not ashamed of it. To convincingly play a character, you better “study and appreciate them, and I certainly tried to do my part,” he said. The Republican said he respects Walz and has an amicable relationship with the former teacher. “He earned his way to where he is, worked hard and got himself up there” — and got a few breaks by being in the right place at the right time, Seifert added. “I’ve studied Tim Walz for years,” the former legislator said, noting some Minnesota Republicans couldn’t get past their dislike of Walz to see his talents. “They underestimate him every time he runs.” “I saw him at a parade when he unseated a 12-year congressman. He had 100 people walking with him, and he had a bullhorn talking about how we need to get out of the Iraq War,” Seifert remembered. “I just thought, ‘This guy is going to win.’ And I watched him ever since dispensing Republican after Republican.” Seifert’s warnings echo those of fellow Minnesota Republicans The Post spoke to when Harris made Walz her running mate. “He’s a good speaker, good debater. I wouldn’t take [him] lightly, that’s for sure,” Cal Brink, a retired Minnesota businessman. said in early August. “Bring some popcorn to the debate with J.D. Vance,” Jen DeJournett, president of Ballot Box Strategies in Minnesota, said then, predicting the vice-presidential debate would be much more interesting than the Trump-Harris matchup. Walz, who could boast a National Rifle Association endorsement as a congressman, reflected the more moderate stance of his southern Minnesota district while in Congress, Seifert said. In comparison, Walz’s time governing the state has been “more left with a few spots of moderation.” Siefert, whose legislative district was near Walz’s congressional district, said there’s a joke in southern Minnesota: “The only thing moderate about Walz is his haircut.” The former lawmaker thinks highlighting social issues is another losing debate strategy and emphasized Vance’s focus should be on the economy and the border. For the average American, Seifert reiterated: “At the end of the day their discretionary disposable income is how they judge the economy.” Vance’s counterpoint to Walz’s appeal to middle America should be simple, Seifert said: “It costs too much to live, the border is out of control, and we can do better, we have a plan.” The 538 polling average gives Vance a net unfavorability rating of +11.3, compared with a +3.7 net favorable for Walz.","summary":"Ohio Sen.
