The U.S. imposed a 35 percent tariff on some of the most critical exports between the countries.\n\nBut the president abruptly canceled the talks after the Ontario government started running an ad that featured Reagan, a Republican, criticizing tariffs and warning of the dangers they pose in his April 1987 radio address urging Congress not to pursue protectionism in dealing with Japan.\n\nUS President Donald Trump greets Canada’s Prime Minister Mark Carney during a summit on Gaza in Sharm el-Sheikh on October 13, 2025.

(Photo by Evan Vucci/POOL/AFP via Getty Images)\n\nTrump denounced the ad as fraudulent, and the Ronald Reagan Presidential Foundation and Institute issued a statement criticizing the ad as misrepresenting Reagan’s presidential address through “selective audio and video.” The foundation also said that it would review legal options, as Ontario did not seek nor receive permission to use and edit the remarks.\n\nOntario Premier Doug Ford announced Friday that he had ordered a pause in the ad campaign, which he had intended to run during the first two games of the World Series, which are taking place in Canada as the Toronto Blue Jays host the Los Angeles Dodgers. \n\nWhat To Know\n\nTrump’s decision to increase the tariff marks an escalation of tensions between the U.S. and Canada even after Carney did not dispute the president’s complaint against the ad.\n\nWhen asked about Trump’s decision to suspend negotiations over the ad, Carney told reporters that Canada is “ready to pick up on those discussions when the Americans are ready.”\n\nListen to President Reagan's unedited remarks here: https://t.co/1gQUcbR4eZ pic.twitter.com/iqmjSuypp0— Ronald Reagan Presidential Foundation & Institute (@RonaldReagan) October 24, 2025\n\nTrump alleged that Ontario ran the ad as a means of influencing the Supreme Court as the Justices consider cases concerning the limits on the presidential use of tariffs – an allegation he repeated in his Saturday post, writing: “The sole purpose of this FRAUD was Canada’s hope that the United States Supreme Court will come to their ‘rescue’ on Tariffs that they have used for years to hurt the United States.”\n\n“Now the United States is able to defend itself against high and overbearing Canadian Tariffs (and those from the rest of the World as well!),” Trump added.\n\nThis will bring the general tariff on Canada up to 45 percent, but it remains unclear when the tariff increase would go into effect.\n\nWhat People Are Saying\n\nPresident Donald Trump in his Truth Social post: “Canada was caught, red handed, putting up a fraudulent advertisement on Ronald Reagan’s Speech on Tariffs. The Reagan Foundation said that they, “created an ad campaign using selective audio and video of President Ronald Reagan. The ad misrepresents the Presidential Radio Address,” and “did not seek nor receive permission to use and edit the remarks. The Ronald Reagan Presidential Foundation and Institute is reviewing its legal options in this matter.” The sole purpose of this FRAUD was Canada’s hope that the United States Supreme Court will come to their “rescue” on Tariffs that they have used for years to hurt the United States.”\n\n“Now the United States is able to defend itself against high and overbearing Canadian Tariffs (and those from the rest of the World as well!). Ronald Reagan LOVED Tariffs for purposes of National Security and the Economy, but Canada said he didn’t! Their Advertisement was to be taken down, IMMEDIATELY, but they let it run last night during the World Series, knowing that it was a FRAUD. Because of their serious misrepresentation of the facts, and hostile act, I am increasing the Tariff on Canada by 10% over and above what they are paying now. Thank you for your attention to this matter!” he added. \n\nOntario Premier Doug Ford wrote on X: “”Our intention was always to initiate a conversation about the kind of economy that Americans want to build and the impact of tariffs on workers and businesses.

I have lived my entire career a life of service, and it’s in my bones. And there are many ways to serve. I have not decided yet what I will do in the future beyond what I’m doing right now.”\n\nHarris was also pressed on her political odds in the White House race after bookmakers placed her behind celebrity figures such as actor and former wrestler Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson.\n\nHarris remained unfazed, saying, “I’ve never listened to polls. If I listened to polls, I would not have run for my first office or my second office, and I certainly wouldn’t be sitting here in this interview.”\n\nHarris became the Democratic presidential nominee in 2024 after Joe Biden dropped out of the White House race following his disastrous debate with Trump, during which he appeared to stumble over his words and lose his train of thought, prompting concerns about his age and fitness for office. Harris went on to face Trump, who soundly defeated her in the November election.\n\nWith the next presidential race three years away, media have speculated that possible Democratic contenders in the 2028 election could include Harris, California Governor Gavin Newsom, and New York Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez.\n\nAmong Republicans, Vice President J.D.

Thank you for your attention to this matter!,” Donald Trump posted on Truth Social while aboard Air Force One. Multiple Canadian products already face a 35% tariff, while steel and aluminium are subject to a 50% tariff, and energy products face a mere 10%. Trump did not clarify which products or sectors the additional 10% will apply to. Trump further claimed that Canada is looking to be “rescued” by the Supreme Court regarding tariffs and called for the ad to be taken down immediately. “The sole purpose of this FRAUD was Canada’s hope that the United States Supreme Court will come to their “rescue” on Tariffs that they have used for years to hurt the United States.

Earlier on Saturday, US President Donald Trump refused to meet with Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney, just moments before departing the White House for his trip to Asia.When asked by reporters whether he intended to hold talks with Carney, who will also be in Asia, Trump replied, “No, I don’t have any plan to.”The controversial ad uses a clip of former US president Ronald Reagan, which is allegedly misinterpreted as being against tariffs. The Ontario government reportedly paid for the ad, which has been running on major US networks and cost $75 million. This comes weeks after US President Trump and visiting Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney discussed trade, border security, and ongoing negotiations between the two neighbouring nations on October 7, providing the backdrop to the sudden termination of talks.Addressing reporters at the Oval Office, Trump described the trade talks as “complicated, more complicated than maybe any other agreement we have on trade.” He explained that the complexity stemmed from both competition and closeness between the two countries, describing it as a mix of “natural conflict” and “mutual love.” (ANI)","summary":"","url":"https://www.news18.com/agency-feeds/trump-raises-tariffs-on-canada-by-10-over-fraudulent-reagan-ad-9659103.html","image":"https://images.news18.com/ibnlive/uploads/2025/05/News18_India_Section_Default_Image_1600x900-2025-05-b4faf46d67a95708181b01e36cf20c4b.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-10-26 00:59:47","author":"News18","authors":["News18"],"language":"en","source_country":"in","sentiment":0.075},{"id":372594724,"title":"Every tent in this godforsaken camp could be incubating another Manchester attack. I don't believe the inmates' claims of innocence. ISIS armies are rising here in the dust, reports DAVID PATRIKARAKOS from Syria","text":"His voice is gentle, his eyes calm, his smile polite; he looks harmless, the kind of ordinary man you might pass without notice on a London high street. But this man is not ordinary. He was once in ISIS, the world’s most savage terror group – he helped to power one of the 21st century’s greatest horrors.\n\nWe meet in a hut in east Syria. It is bare except for two plastic chairs. The air is heavy with heat and dust. The man across from me is in brown prison clothes. I am conducting a rare face-to-face interview with a British jihadi.\n\nImad Othman Mohamed Ali is one of 10,000 presumed ISIS-affiliated men and hundreds of youths in 14 prisons run by the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) across north-east Syria. We in the West owe the Kurds a debt. First, we demanded they help us defeat ISIS; then, after the terror group’s so-called Caliphate was crushed militarily in 2019, we insisted that they imprison its remnants.\n\nThe Kurds loathe ISIS. But how much longer can they do this? They are constantly under attack from their old enemy Turkey. They fear Syria’s new government, led by former jihadi Ahmed al-Sharaa, is sympathetic to ISIS.\n\nAnd they rely on foreign funding, much of which Donald Trump withdrew this year.\n\nWithout sufficient resources, these prisons and camps can’t hold – yet what’s inside them is deadly. The jihadi ideology festers here. If the Kurds falter, the ISIS nightmare could return.\n\nLet us never forget that, from 2013-19, the Islamic State turned Syria and Iraq into laboratories of terror, where brutality was staged as theatre. In Raqqa, its self-declared capital, ISIS carried out beheadings in public squares, mounting the heads of its victims on spikes.\n\nIn Mosul, men accused of homosexuality were thrown from roofs. Prisoners were doused in petrol and set alight in cages, the horror broadcast in slick videos. Women were stoned to death for ‘adultery’; children had to watch executions to inure them to killing.\n\nIn Fallujah, crucifixion returned to the modern world – bodies nailed to makeshift crosses and left to rot in the sun. Streets that once bustled with traders and children echoed with the chants of black-clad militants and screams of victims.\n\nSlavery became a state industry. Fighters were gifted ‘wives’ as rewards. Children were torn from parents and trained as soldiers.\n\nISIS was not only a terror group but a bureaucracy of savagery, cataloguing rape and murder with the same efficiency as it managed its oil wells. Cruelty was systemic, deliberate and proudly executed.\n\nAli arrived in Britain from Sudan in 1989 as a 26-year-old asylum seeker. Britain gave him everything: an IT degree, postgraduate study in Glasgow and a job in tech support in east London.\n\nLater he moved to Qatar to work in oil and gas. It was a life far beyond anything he could have imagined in Sudan. Then he threw it away to join the ISIS butchers.\n\nWhy? He simply wanted ‘to live under Sharia law’. There is no grand narrative here, no tortured tale of poverty, discrimination, alienation. Just quiet, chilling determination to join the Caliphate.\n\nOnce in Syria, ISIS put him in charge of maintenance across 18 workshops servicing oil wells and pipelines. The work had a rhythm: by day, Coalition jets bombed refineries; by night Ali and his crews scrambled to keep the financial lifeblood flowing. At the peak – from 2014 to 2016 – he claims ISIS cleared $50 million a month from oil and gas, often through intermediaries who sold it to Syria’s then leader Bashar al-Assad, as well as to ‘normal people’ and to Turkey.\n\nThrough it all he presents himself as a technician, not a soldier.\n\n‘I never trained,’ he says; then admits to occasional ‘ribat’ – guard duty with a rifle – because ‘sometimes they told us to do it’. He insists he never fought, never killed, never saw a beheading.\n\nIt’s a familiar choreography of denial: the violence was elsewhere, the men in black weren’t him; murders happened offstage. But he knew what he was signing up for, and the banality of his excuses underscores the horror.\n\nI press him. He yields a fraction. ISIS ‘did a lot of bad things’, he concedes. Yes, there were unjustified beheadings. Yes, there were moments that ‘shocked’ him: favouritism, hypocrisy, the reliance on smugglers to get potential recruits into ISIS territory one week and the execution of those same smugglers the next.\n\nHe describes an early period as ‘utopian’, when life under ISIS felt orderly – followed by collapse under Western airstrikes.\n\nBy 2018, with defeat for ISIS looking inevitable, he claims he’d had enough. He paid a smuggler to reach Turkey. The smuggler handed him to the Kurds.\n\nNow he wants a trial, preferably in Britain – in a court.\n\nI look at him: the immigrant who had every British opportunity; the engineer who kept ISIS’s wells pumping; the prisoner who craves due process from the country he betrayed. He asks for understanding but accepts no real guilt. Because whatever his denials, Ali was part of the machine that kept ISIS alive. Every barrel of oil he kept flowing funded bullets, bombs and the blades of knives that cut people’s throats, decapitated them.\n\nWithout engineers like him, ISIS would not have been able to pay fighters, buy weapons or export their bloody chaos across the globe. The calm, smiling man before me is proof of how ordinary the face of evil can be.\n\nNext day I head to Al-Roj Camp, a cluster of tents and fences on the edge of the desert in Syria’s north-east governorate of Al-Hasakah. Established in 2014 for displaced families, Roj was once a refuge for those fleeing ISIS barbarism. Now it’s a holding pen under Kurdish control for the women and children of ISIS fighters – a micro-Caliphate behind wire.\n\nIn its heyday, ISIS drew an estimated 53,000 foreign affiliates from 80 countries, building a network of terror that reached into the heart of Europe.\n\nThe Paris massacre of 2015 killed 130 people; Brussels in 2016 left 32 dead; Nice that same year killed 86 and the Manchester Arena bombing in 2017 murdered 22 and injured more than 1,000.\n\nFrom 2015 to 2017 alone, jihadi attacks across the EU killed more than 300 people. This was ISIS’s most lethal export: not oil or gas but blood and ideology.\n\nAnd here in Syria that ideology does not die – it breeds.\n\nThis is the camp that holds Shamima Begum, the schoolgirl who fled Bethnal Green in London in 2015 to join ISIS.\n\nShe married a Dutch fighter and had three children, all of whom died. Stripped of her UK citizenship in 2019, she lost every appeal against the decision, most recently at the Supreme Court last year. The camp is a tangle of dirt paths, floodlights and rusting wire. Veiled little girls amble through the dust.\n\nWithout support, camps like Roj could collapse. And then what? Thousands of hardened ISIS families released into chaos. That thought should terrify us.\n\nFor all the billions spent fighting ISIS, its containment rests with overstretched Kurdish guards and threadbare aid budgets.\n\nMy first meeting is with the camp’s co-administrator Hukmia Ibrahim. Small, composed and long past outrage, she explains that Roj was set up for families fleeing the barbarism of ISIS and Al Qaeda’s Syrian franchise Jabhat al-Nusra.\n\n‘After the Caliphate collapsed in 2017, it changed,’ she explains. ‘We created a special section for the foreign women and their children who had joined Daesh [ISIS].’\n\nShe spreads a map of the camp across her desk. ‘Now we have 765 families here, around 2,300 people – from 50 nationalities. Only a handful of Syrian and Iraqi refugee families remain. The rest are ISIS wives and children.’\n\nAsked about Shamima Begum, Ibrahim replies: ‘She refuses to speak to anyone. She used to wear full Islamic dress but now she’s always in sports clothes.\n\n‘She stays in her tent and won’t engage. She adopted this attitude after she was stripped of her nationality. Once I took a journalist to her tent. She pushed us out.’\n\nI ask if ISIS ideology survives here. She sighs: ‘When you visit the inmates they seem normal. But when Turkish attacks on Kurdish positions are reported nearby, they demonstrate, shouting that Turkey’s coming to save them.\n\n‘When [former jihadi and new Syrian President] Ahmed al-Sharaa’s militia group took control of Damascus, inmates started handing out sweets in the camp. Some came to me and said, “Tomorrow you will be in our place and you’ll see how it feels”. If you visit their tents, you can see bags packed; they are ready to renew their “Islamic Caliphate”.’\n\nTwo weeks ago, she says, French government representatives came to try to repatriate families. ‘We have 42 French families here. Only two agreed to go. Now that Sharaa is Syria’s President, most still hope that he will rescue them.’\n\nIt is the teenage boys, she tells me, who worry her most. ‘We used to move them to re-education centres when they reached adolescence but there’s no space any more. As they grow older they form gangs, 30 or 40 at a time, attacking schools in the camp, clinics, even each other.’ Then, more quietly, she tells me: ‘We’ve had many cases of sexual harassment and rape – even of boys.\n\n‘Victims rarely name their attackers because if they do, the young men will be taken from the camp and their families will retaliate against the informer.’\n\nShe places three objects on the desk – sticks bound together and wrapped in coloured tape, shaped into two pistols and one machine gun. ‘They make these in their tents. Parents are training them to continue the jihadist mission.\n\n‘Now even children in the camp will accuse you of being a Kafir [unbeliever]. They ask women why their faces are uncovered. In the camp park, if a woman comes in unveiled, she is forced to leave.’\n\nWould they be a danger if released? ‘For sure,’ she says. ‘Not just to their home countries, but to the world. They want revenge.’\n\nNext door I meet a fully veiled Londoner in her 30s who is said by the authorities to be the wife of an ISIS fighter. She insists she is not an ISIS bride. She says she and her husband were aid workers in Syria, where they’d moved with their four children, and were stranded by chance in ISIS-controlled land. I try to keep my face neutral, but who takes four children into a war zone to deliver aid?\n\nWhen ISIS fell, the Kurds arrested them. She has been in Roj since 2021. Her husband, she believes, is in prison somewhere.\n\nOne of her children was killed in fighting as the Caliphate collapsed. The others have grown up behind the wire. She survives on handouts and tries to keep the children busy as they endure the bullying of families contemptuous of her hopes of taking them to Britain.\n\n‘It is not popular to say you want to go home,’ she says. ‘They consider it apostasy. Their kids have been told it’s OK to steal from us as we are “not Muslim any more”.’\n\nShe pleads for repatriation: ‘I’ll cooperate with the British Government. I just want to bring my children home,’ she says.\n\nFor a moment, I feel sympathy. She is pleasant and clearly struggling after years in this place.\n\nAnd then I see a flicker of tension in her eyes. The British Government, she admits, offered to take her children from her to repatriate them. ‘We talked about it. But they didn’t want to leave without me, they were crying,’ she says.\n\nThe scales fall from my eyes. She had a chance to save her children from this hell – and she refused. What mother would do that?\n\nA coordinator leads me to Shamima Begum’s tent, which is grey and zipped down the middle, but she’s not there. I’m told: ‘She must have known you were coming and is hiding elsewhere.’\n\nMy eyes are drawn to the red padlock securing it. ‘Ah yes,’ our guide explains, ‘Shamima is the only inmate here who is allowed to lock her tent.’\n\nI turn a corner and four boys surround me, grinning. One, in a dark-blue polo shirt, says his name is Adam and he’s from Leeds.\n\nHe has spent his whole life in this camp. I ask him if he wants to go to the UK. ‘Yes,’ he replies. ‘I miss my granny and grandpa.’\n\nAdam has obviously never met nor had any contact with his grandparents. These are words, I realise, fed to him by adults hoping to manipulate journalists.\n\nI look at the boys raised behind barbed wire, growing harder, angrier, more dangerous with every year. I feel the weight of it as I walk: every dusty tent could be incubating another Paris, another Manchester.\n\nThe war against ISIS was never truly over. Its ideology thrives still in these camps. Its families are ready, dreaming of resurrection.\n\nAnd the Kurds – under-funded, under-armed and under pressure from old enemies – are all that stands between us and an ISIS resurgence.\n\nUnless the world wakes up, the Caliphate will rise again. Its armies are growing here in the dust, waiting for their moment.","summary":"His voice is gentle, his eyes calm, his smile polite; he looks harmless. But this man is not ordinary.

The encounter is expected to be contentious, given the ongoing trade war between the U.S. and China.\n\nTrump has set lofty goals for this Asian tour, confidently stating he aims to secure a “really fair and really great trade deal” with Xi in South Korea.\n\nThis trip follows a challenging week for Trump’s foreign policy efforts.\n\nPeace in the Middle East remains fragile, highlighted by the Israeli Knesset’s symbolic vote to support West Bank annexation after Trump brokered a deal with Hamas earlier this month. His second meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin collapsed, resulting in new oil sanctions, while tensions with China have reached a peak.\n\nSteve Bannon, Trump’s former White House chief strategist, has labeled this Asian tour as one of the president’s “riskiest” ventures yet.\n\n‘The Chinese Communist Party has declared open economic warfare against America, so this is what they call a throw of the ‘iron dice.’ This is as high stakes as it gets,’ he claimed.\n\nFor a successful trip Trump will likely want to get Xi to back off some of escalatory actions including restrictions on products with trace amounts of Chinese rare earth minerals in them and halting of its purchase of American soybeans.\n\nSome fear that in an effort to reverse these actions, Trump might make sweeping concessions like removing export controls on semiconductor chips and manufacturing equipment. \n\n‘The worst case scenario for the United States is Trump concedes a whole lot,’ Liza Tobin, who served as National Security Council director for China during the first Trump term and the start of the Biden administration, told Politico.\n\nTrump is leaving Washington, D.C.

Then he will head to South Korea where Trump will deliver remarks at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum (APEC) before concluding his trip with the consequential bilateral meeting with Xi.\n\nDuring a White House event on Thursday Trump repeated his claim that tariffs are what stops the U.S. from being a ‘third world nation.’\n\nEarly in his second term, Trump imposed broad tariffs on Canada, Mexico and China before also imposing taxes on nearly every other country on earth.\n\nIn February, the president issued a 25 percent tariff on all imports from America’s northern and southern neighbors and then an additional 10 percent on Chinese imports, which he doubled to 20 percent by March.\n\nThe tariffs, Trump said, were punishment for Mexico, Canada and China emboldening fentanyl to flow into the U.S. and for allowing proliferation of the migration and drug trafficking crisis over American borders.\n\nTrump has negotiated with all three nations to alter tariffs after retaliatory taxes were placed on U.S. imports to those nations.\n\nBut on Thursday, Trump reignited the fight with Canada after Ontario Premier Doug Ford released a $53.5 million ad campaign using late President Ronald Reagan’s words to push back against U.S. tariffs.\n\nA furious Trump slammed the ad as ‘fake’ and immediately announced on Truth Social that he was ‘terminating’ trade negotiations with Canada.\n\nThe 60-second ad pulls from a 1987 radio address made by Reagan who was explaining at the time why he was placing tariffs on Japanese electronics.\n\n‘Let’s take Ronald Reagan’s words and let’s blast it to the American people,’ Ford said upon launching the campaign. ‘We’re going to repeat that message to every Republican district there is right across the entire country.’\n\nThe Ronald Reagan Presidential Foundation & Institute the ad takes the former U.S. president’s words out of context and says they are ‘reviewing its legal options in this matter.’","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nDonald Trump is set to embark on an Asian tour starting Friday,&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Trump Undertakes High-Stakes Visit to China Amid Intensifying Trade Tensions first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/politics/trump-undertakes-high-stakes-visit-to-china-amid-intensifying-trade-tensions/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Trump-embarks-on-Asia-trip-amid-trade-tensions.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-10-26 00:52:33","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.033},{"id":372598024,"title":"Russian envoy to continue meetings with Trump administration — source","text":"MIAMI, October 26. /TASS/.

after Trump deal","text":"The framework the Prime Minister signed this week with Donald Trump promised an immediate pipeline of critical minerals and rare earth elements – materials vital to modern technology – worth some $13bn.\n\nFigures vary, but China mines up to 70 per cent of the world’s supply and controls more than 90 per cent of refining.\n\nAsked on Sunday if he was concerned the move might rub the Chinese government up the wrong way, Mr Albanese said “no”, and vowed to “stand up for Australia’s national interests”.\n\n“And of course, the critical minerals deal is in Australia’s national interest,” Mr Albanese told Nine’s Weekend Today.\n\n“We want to make sure that we make more things in Australia and that if we can do so in partnership with the United States, then that’s a great thing.”\n\nHe went on to say critical minerals and rare earths “will power the world in this century”.\n\n“This is a program that could set Australia up - just as iron ore and our resources have been so important in the last century and will continue to be - so this is absolutely critical,” Mr Albanese said.\n\nHe signed the agreement with the US President at the White House after China slapped export restrictions on some materials with crucial defence applications – a move Western strategists have long-warned Beijing could pull in a bid to flex its control of the sector.\n\nNewsWire understands it was finalised mere hours before.\n\nIn a lengthy exchange with the press at the signing, both leaders were hesitant to point to any particular reason why the deal had been concluded, with Mr Trump saying it was “negotiated over a period of four or five months”.\n\n“And it was sort of good timing that we got it done just in time for the visit,” he said, looking to Mr Albanese, who remarked the timing was “perfect”.\n\n“We’ve been working on that for quite a while.\n\n“In about a year from now, we’ll have so much critical mineral and rare earths that you won’t know what to do with them.”\n\nAgainst a backdrop of Chinese attacks targeting Australian critical mineral miners, Mr Trump was asked what would “happen to China if they don’t play fair”.\n\nHe said he thought “we’re going to have a very good relationship with China”, but cautioned consequences if it meddled with the Australia deal.\n\n“We have a tremendous power, and that’s the power of tariff,” he said.\n\nElaborating, Mr Trump said that “if they pay enough tariffs” it would cut-off China’s ability to do business with the US.\n\n“And if they don’t do business with us, I think China’s in big trouble, I’ll be honest with you,” he said.\n\n“I don’t know that they even make it.\n\n“I believe that they’re in big trouble, and I don’t want them to be in big trouble.\n\n“I want them to do great, I want them to thrive, but we have to thrive together. It’s a two-way street.”\n\nMore to come.","summary":"Anthony Albanese has responded to concerns about China as Australia challenges the powerful nation’s dominance in a critical

lagi","text":"QATAR: Presiden Amerika Syarikat (AS), Donald Trump, semalam berkata, beliau akan menaikkan tarif ke atas barangan Kanada sebanyak tambahan 10 peratus.\n\nLangkah itu diambil susulan kekecewaan berhubung iklan anti-tarif Kanada yang memaparkan mendiang bekas pemimpin AS, Ronald Reagan.\n\nPengumuman itu dibuat dua hari selepas Trump berkata, beliau telah menamatkan semua rundingan perdagangan dengan Kanada kerana kempen iklan yang disifatkannya sebagai palsu.\n\n\"Iklan mereka sepatutnya telah diturunkan, serta merta, tetapi mereka membiarkannya disiarkan malam tadi semasa perlawanan (Baseball World Series), walaupun mengetahui ia adalah penipuan,\" kata Trump di platform Truth Social ketika beliau dalam penerbangan ke Asia untuk pertemuan dengan pemimpin serantau utama.\n\n\"Oleh kerana salah nyata fakta yang serius dan tindakan bermusuhan mereka, saya akan menaikkan tarif ke atas Kanada sebanyak 10 peratus melebihi apa yang mereka bayar sekarang,\" tegasnya.\n\nIklan dari wilayah Ontario di Kanada itu menggunakan petikan daripada ucapan radio mengenai perdagangan yang disampaikan oleh Reagan pada tahun 1987. \n\nDalam ucapan itu, Reagan memberi amaran mengenai kesan yang boleh dibawa oleh tarif tinggi ke atas import asing terhadap ekonomi AS.\n\nIklan itu memetik ikon Republikan itu sebagai berkata, bahawa tarif tinggi tidak dapat dielakkan akan membawa kepada tindakan balas oleh negara asing dan mencetuskan perang perdagangan yang sengit, petikan yang sepadan dengan transkrip ucapan beliau di laman web Perpustakaan Presiden Ronald Reagan.\n\nYayasan Ronald Reagan pada Khamis lalu menulis di platform X bahawa kerajaan Ontario telah menggunakan audio dan video terpilih dan sedang meneliti pilihan undang-undang mereka.\n\nOntario berkata, ia akan menarik balik iklan antitarif yang menimbulkan masalah itu pada Isnin supaya rundingan dapat dimulakan semula.\n\nTarif sektor global Trump, terutamanya ke atas keluli, aluminium, dan kenderaan telah menjejaskan Kanada dengan teruk, menyebabkan kehilangan pekerjaan dan menekan perniagaan.\n\nBuat masa ini, AS dan Kanada mematuhi perjanjian perdagangan Amerika Utara sedia ada yang dipanggil USMCA, yang memastikan kira-kira 85 peratus perdagangan rentas sempadan dalam kedua-dua arah kekal bebas tarif.\n\nNamun, dalam ucapan pada Rabu, Perdana Menteri Kanada, Mark Carney, berkata AS telah menaikkan taraf tarifnya ke paras yang terakhir dilihat semasa Kemelesetan Besar.\n\n\"Strategi ekonomi kita perlu berubah secara mendadak,\" tambah Carney, sambil menyatakan proses itu akan memerlukan beberapa pengorbanan dan sedikit masa.\n\nTrump dan Carney kedua-duanya dijadualkan menghadiri majlis makan malam di luar Sidang Kemuncak Kerjasama Ekonomi Asia Pasifik (APEC) di Korea Selatan pada Rabu. \n\nBagaimanapun, Trump berkata beliau tidak mempunyai rancangan untuk bertemu Carney.\n\nMenambah ketegangan kepada pertikaian rentas sempadan itu, Siri Dunia besbol menampilkan pasukan Kanada, Toronto Blue Jays, menentang pasukan AS, Los Angeles Dodgers. \n\nBlue Jays menewaskan Dodgers 11-4 dalam perlawanan pertama pada Jumaat.\n\nTrump says increasing tariffs on Canada by 10 percent\n\nAboard Air Force One, Oct 25, 2025 (AFP) -\n\nUS President Donald Trump said Saturday he was hiking tariffs on Canadian goods by an additional 10 percent, as fallout continued over a Canadian anti-tariff ad that featured late US leader Ronald Reagan.\n\nThe announcement came two days after Trump said he had terminated all trade talks with Canada over what he called the \"fake\" ad campaign.\n\n\"Their Advertisement was to be taken down, IMMEDIATELY, but they let it run last night during the World Series, knowing that it was a FRAUD,\" Trump said on his Truth Social platform, posting the message as he flew to Asia for meetings with key regional leaders.\n\n\"Because of their serious misrepresentation of the facts, and hostile act, I am increasing the Tariff on Canada by 10% over and above what they are paying now,\" he said.\n\nThe ad from the Canadian province of Ontario used quotes from a radio address on trade that Reagan delivered in 1987, in which he warned against ramifications that he said high tariffs on foreign imports could have on the US economy.\n\nIt cited the Republican icon as saying that \"high tariffs inevitably lead to retaliation by foreign countries and the triggering of fierce trade wars,\" a quote that matches a transcript of his speech on the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library's website.\n\nThe Ronald Reagan foundation wrote on X on Thursday that the Ontario government had used \"selective audio and video\" and that it was reviewing its legal options. \n\nOntario said it would pull the offending anti-tariff ad on Monday so that negotiations could restart.\n\nTrump's global sectoral tariffs – particularly on steel, aluminum, and autos – have hit Canada hard, forcing job losses and squeezing businesses.\n\nFor now, the United States and Canada adhere to an existing North American trade deal called the USMCA, which ensures that roughly 85 percent of cross-border trade in both directions remains tariff-free.\n\nBut in a speech on Wednesday, Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney said the United States has raised \"its tariffs to levels last seen during the Great Depression.\"\n\n\"Our economic strategy needs to change dramatically,\" Carney added, saying the process \"will take some sacrifices and some time.\"\n\nTrump and Carney are both set to be at a dinner on the sidelines of an Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) in South Korea on Wednesday. But Trump has said he had no plans to meet Carney.\n\nAdding extra spice to the cross-border row, baseball's World Series features a Canadian team, the Toronto Blue Jays, facing a US team, the Los Angeles Dodgers. The Blue Jays thrashed the Dodgers 11-4 in the first game on Friday.","summary":"QATAR: Presiden Amerika Syarikat (AS), Donald Trump, semalam berkata, beliau akan menaikkan tarif ke atas barangan Kanada sebanyak tambahan 10 peratus.","url":"https://www.bharian.com.my/dunia/amerika/2025/10/1463414/trump-naikkan-tarif-kanada-10-peratus-lagi","image":"https://assets.bharian.com.my/images/articles/BH26taeif-o_BHfield_image_listing_featured.var_1761439554.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-10-26 00:46:00","author":"AFP","authors":["AFP"],"language":"en","source_country":"my","sentiment":0.318},{"id":372594756,"title":"Trump puji peranan Malaysia dalam rundingan gencatan senjata Thailand-Kemboja","text":"KUALA LUMPUR: Presiden Amerika Syarikat (AS), Donald Trump memuji peranan penting Malaysia dalam memudahkan rundingan gencatan senjata antara Thailand dan Kemboja bagi memulihkan keamanan di sepanjang kawasan sempadan yang menjadi pertikaian.\n\n Trump berkata beliau memutuskan untuk memasukkan Malaysia dalam lawatan serantau beliau sebagai pengiktirafan kepada diplomasi aktif Malaysia dalam membantu menguruskan gencatan senjata itu.\n\n \"Saya memberitahu pemimpin Malaysia (Perdana Menteri, Datuk Seri Anwar Ibrahim), yang merupakan seorang yang sangat baik, saya berkata, 'Saya rasa saya wajar membuat lawatan ke sini,' dan sebab itulah kami singgah di Malaysia.

Jon Jones and Alex Pereira Want To Make History","text":"The heavyweight division’s supposed marquee moment at UFC 321 turned into a farce Saturday night, and now two of the sport’s biggest names want to clean up the mess with a super fight that would make history.\n\nTom Aspinall retained his heavyweight title against Ciryl Gane, but not in any way anyone wanted to see. An accidental eye poke turned what should’ve been a defining moment into a frustrating no-contest, leaving fans furious and the division in limbo. Within hours, former champion Jon Jones seized the moment—trolling Aspinall on social media with an eyepatch added to his duck avatar before throwing down a challenge that has the MMA world buzzing.\n\nJones Emerges From Retirement Talk\n\nJones, who walked away from the sport earlier in 2025 rather than face Aspinall, suddenly seems interested in fighting again. But not against the guy holding the belt. Instead, he’s targeting light heavyweight king Alex Pereira for a potential showdown at the UFC’s planned White House event in June 2026.\n\n“Alex, I’d be down to bring the highest skill level to the White House,” Jones posted on X Saturday. “I appreciate the respect you showed, let’s dance.”\n\nIt’s classic Jones—equal parts promotional genius and strategic calculation. He’s essentially saying he’ll return to the octagon, just not for the fight everyone actually wants to see. The timing feels deliberate, capitalizing on the disappointment from UFC 321 while offering fans something they didn’t know they needed.\n\nPereira Ready to Move Up\n\nPereira isn’t just talking. The Brazilian knockout artist defended his light heavyweight crown against Magomed Ankalaev at UFC 320, and immediately afterward, he made his intentions clear. He wants Jones, and he wants to “make the heavyweight division great again”—a not-so-subtle nod to the political setting of their proposed venue.\n\nWhat makes this callout legitimate is that Pereira actually considered challenging Jones at UFC 320 but held back out of respect. Jones’s brother, Arthur, had recently passed away, and Pereira instead led a moment of silence after his win. Jones expressed his gratitude for Pereira’s gesture.\n\nDana White caught wind of Pereira’s heavyweight ambitions before UFC 320 and seemed cautiously open to the idea. “I like the guy so much, we’ll see,” White said. “I just don’t see why unless he wants to retire. Why throw him at heavyweight? It doesn’t make any sense other than he just wants to do it so bad, I’ll just say yes.”\n\nThe White House Card Complication\n\nHere’s where things get tricky. President Donald Trump announced plans for a UFC event at the White House on June 14, 2026. It’s an unprecedented opportunity for the promotion, but White has legitimate concerns about booking Jones as the main event.\n\nJones’s history speaks for itself—multiple arrests, failed drug tests, and personal issues that have derailed big moments before. White doesn’t trust him enough to headline what could be the most high-profile card in UFC history. Can you blame him? The last thing anyone wants is for Jones to sabotage an event of this magnitude.\n\nBut if you’re looking at this purely from a fighting perspective, Jones versus Pereira is the kind of super fight that transcends divisions. Jones is widely considered the greatest fighter of all time, even with all the baggage. Pereira has knockout power that can end fights in an instant and the kind of presence that makes casual fans pay attention.\n\nWhat This Means for the Division\n\nThe real casualty here might be Aspinall. The guy’s the actual heavyweight champion, yet he’s being treated like an afterthought. Jones retired rather than fight him, and now he’s calling out a light heavyweight instead. It’s disrespectful, but it’s also business. The UFC has been reluctant to book Jones versus Aspinall for reasons that probably have more to do with money and marketability than anything else.\n\nPereira moving up creates fascinating questions. He’s already conquered two weight classes—middleweight and light heavyweight. Adding heavyweight would put him in rare company. But is he big enough? Can his frame handle the size difference against true heavyweights? Against Jones specifically, the technical chess match would be incredible, but the physical mismatch could be real.\n\nFinal Thoughts\n\nThis entire situation captures everything wild about modern MMA. You’ve got a disappointing title fight ending in controversy, a retired legend trolling the current champion while calling out someone from a different weight class, and the possibility of it all happening at the White House. It’s chaos, but it’s the kind of chaos that makes combat sports compelling.\n\nWhether White actually books this fight remains to be seen. Jones’s unpredictability is a legitimate concern, and Pereira’s willingness to move up in weight might not make long-term sense for his career. But it would be something absolutely special to watch unfold.","summary":"The heavyweight division’s supposed marquee moment at UFC 321 turned into a farce Saturday night, and now two of the sport’s biggest names want to clean up the mess with a super fight that would make history.","url":"https://www.yardbarker.com/mma/articles/a_ufc_super_fight_at_the_white_house_jon_jones_and_alex_pereira_want_to_make_history/s1_17396_42959257","image":"http://res.cloudinary.com/ybmedia/image/upload/c_crop,e_improve,h_1123,w_2000,x_0,y_34/c_fill,f_auto,h_1215,q_auto,w_2160/v1/m/4/0/40633787eb33a2545f01e77671629a39a81da5a3/jul-16-2025-hollywood-ca-usa-jon-jones-poses-on.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-10-26 00:30:48","author":"AJ Nunez,Total Apex Sports","authors":["AJ Nunez","Total Apex Sports"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.335},{"id":372596096,"title":"Bezos’s Washington Post jumps to the defense of Trump’s new ballroom: ‘A shot across the bow at NIMBYs everywhere’","text":"The Washington Post’s editorial board has jumped to the defense of President Donald Trump and his $300 million ballroom in its latest op-ed for the newspaper.\n\nJeff Bezos is the owner of the Post and the CEO of Amazon, one of the tech giants that has contributed funds toward Trump’s ballroom, along with Apple, Google, HP, Microsoft and Meta.\n\nTrump’s new project has prompted widespread criticism this week after crews began demolishing the White House’s historic East Wing, contrary to assurances the president made earlier in the year that the building would not be impacted by the lavish plans. \n\nNow it has been razed to the ground to make way for the ballroom, which will dwarf the 55,000 square-foot White House at 90,000 square feet.\n\nWhile the newspaper’s board noted that Trump has pursued the project “in the most jarring manner possible,” it also stated the move was “a shot across the bow at NIMBYs everywhere” in the op-ed published Saturday evening.\n\nThe acronym stands for “not in my back yard” and is often used to describe opposition from local residents over development and real estate projects.\n\nThe Post’s editorial board agrees with Trump’s team that it is “absurd” tents need to be erected on the South Lawn to accommodate larger state dinners where guests are “forced to use porta-potties.”\n\nUnder Trump’s grand plans, the ballroom will seat 999 guests. “The next Democratic president will be happy to have this,” the op-ed read.\n\nThe board also dismissed concerns that Trump has bypassed the usual process required for major federal renovations.\n\n“The truth is that this project would not have gotten done, certainly not during his term, if the president had gone through the traditional review process,” the op-ed said, adding that it has become “far too difficult to build anything in America.”\n\nParroting the defense Trump officials have given this week, the Post’s board closed its case by arguing other presidents also left their mark on the White House.\n\nThere were nearly 700 comments underneath the op-ed within an hour of publication, with many pointing out the apparent conflict of interest.\n\n“Why didn’t you mention that Amazon is a funder of the ballroom?” the top comment on the op-ed said.\n\n“Looks like Jeff Bezos is now writing OpEds for the Post!” another joked.\n\n“Did Jeff Bezos write this?” said another reader.\n\n“I honestly don’t recognize this version of The Post,” someone else commented.\n\nJournalists at the paper expressed concern earlier this year that Bezos is currying favor with Trump by softening the Post’s coverage of him. The backlash began when the Amazon founder blocked the editorial board’s endorsement of then-vice president Kamala Harris just days before the 2024 election.\n\nA quarter-million readers canceled their subscriptions after Bezos pulled the Harris endorsement.\n\nThen, staffers were enraged in February after Bezos announced a shocking new direction for the paper’s opinion content that resulted in a top editor resigning.\n\n“We are going to be writing every day in support and defense of two pillars: personal liberties and free markets,” he noted. “We’ll cover other topics too, of course, but viewpoints opposing those pillars will be left to be published by others.”\n\nIt later emerged that Bezos dined with Trump just hours after he unveiled the new mandate, the president revealed in an interview.","summary":"The newspaper’s editorial board argued in an op-ed that other presidents have also left their mark on the White House","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/bezos-washington-post-defense-trump-ballroom-b2852309.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/10/24/00/Pictures_of_the_Week_Global_Photo_Gallery_32452.jpg?width=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/uLJJBGgb-OhrQWqOm.mp4","publish_date":"2025-10-26 00:24:30","author":"Rhian Lubin","authors":["Rhian Lubin"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.195},{"id":372596360,"title":"Will White House ballroom be named after Charlie Kirk? — Here's what we know","text":"US President Donald Trump is reportedly considering several names for the new White House ballroom, following days of controversy over his administration’s pricey East Wing project.Earlier in the week, when the president was asked what he’d name the space, he told reporters, “I won’t get into that now.” A senior White House official told Kellie Meyer of NewsNation that they “don’t think a decision has been made” on the name of the ballroom.Is Trump considering naming new White House ballroom after himself?Earlier, ABC news reported that officials involved in the planning of the ballroom project had started to refer to it as \"The President Donald J Trump Ballroom.\"However, speaking to reporters before boarding Marine One on Friday night, Trump said he had considered naming the new structure the Presidential Ballroom \"or something like that,\" but added that \"we haven't really thought about a name yet.\"Trump also revealed that the budget could expand again as he said the White House has around $350 million now for the project.

Two individuals familiar with the transaction identified the donor as Timothy Mellon, heir to the Mellon banking fortune and a major backer of President Donald Trump’s political efforts.\n\nPresident Trump first announced the donation Thursday evening, describing the contributor only as a “patriot” and a “friend” who wished to remain unnamed. Speaking to reporters aboard Air Force One Friday, the president again declined to disclose the donor’s identity, emphasizing that the individual “doesn’t want publicity” and “prefers that his name not be mentioned.”\n\nThe Pentagon confirmed the contribution Friday, with spokesman Sean Parnell stating that “the Department of War accepted an anonymous donation of $130 million under its general gift acceptance authority.” He added that the money was provided “on the condition that it be used to offset the cost of service members’ salaries and benefits.”\n\nMellon, who resides primarily in Wyoming, is the grandson of former Treasury Secretary Andrew W. Mellon and has become one of the nation’s most prolific political donors. While he kept a low profile for decades, Mellon has in recent years emerged as one of Trump’s largest financial supporters, giving tens of millions of dollars to super PACs backing the president’s campaigns. Last year, he contributed $50 million to a pro-Trump committee — one of the largest single political donations on record.\n\nThe Trump administration has taken several steps to ensure military and law enforcement personnel continue receiving pay during the Democrat shutdown, which began October 1 after Senate Democrats rejected a clean continuing resolution to maintain government funding. On October 15, Trump directed Secretary of War Pete Hegseth to coordinate with the Office of Management and Budget to use available appropriations to pay troops, calling missed paychecks for service members “unacceptable.”\n\nAs Breitbart News previously reported, the administration has also arranged to continue payments for Department of Homeland Security officers and Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said earlier this month that “more than 70,000 sworn law enforcement officers” would receive full back pay despite congressional inaction.\n\nThe Pentagon’s acceptance of Mellon’s donation is believed to be the first of its kind in modern history. However, some budget officials have raised questions about whether private contributions to fund military pay could conflict with the Antideficiency Act, which restricts agencies from spending beyond congressional appropriations.\n\nFor now, the donation provides temporary relief to the more than 1.3 million active-duty service members affected by the shutdown. Congressional leaders have yet to reach an agreement to reopen the government, even as financial pressures mount on military families and civilian defense workers.\n\nPresident Trump again praised the donor’s action Friday. “He’s a great American citizen,” Trump said. “A substantial man who loves his country and our troops.”","summary":"Reclusive billionaire and longtime Trump ally Timothy Mellon has been identified as the anonymous donor who contributed $130 million to the federal government to help pay U.S. military personnel during the ongoing Democrat-led government shutdown.\n\n\nThe post Timothy Mellon Identified as $130 Million Donor to Fund U.S. Troops During Shutdown appeared first on Breitbart.","url":"https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2025/10/25/timothy-mellon-identified-as-130-million-donor-to-fund-u-s-troops-during-shutdown/","image":"https://media.breitbart.com/media/2025/10/US-Troops-Stack-of-Money-640x335.jpeg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-10-26 00:10:03","author":"Jasmyn Jordan","authors":["Jasmyn Jordan"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.17},{"id":372594758,"title":"Trump bertemu pemimpin Qatar dalam perjalanan ke Asia","text":"DI ATAS AIR FORCE ONE: Presiden Amerika Syarikat (AS), Donald Trump, semalam merakamkan ucapan terima kasih kepada Emir Qatar dan Perdana Menterinya kerana menjadi faktor utama dalam membantu menjayakan perjanjian gencatan senjata Gaza.\n\nPenghargaan itu disampaikan dalam pertemuan ringkas semasa pesawat Air Force One berhenti mengisi minyak dalam perjalanan ke Asia.\n\nPemimpin Qatar menaiki pesawat Air Force One sebaik sahaja ia mendarat di Pangkalan Udara Al Udeid, yang menempatkan ibu pejabat serantau tentera AS serta ribuan tentera Amerika.\n\nTrump berkata, kedua-dua pemimpin itu memainkan peranan penting dalam proses damai Asia Barat, sambil menambah bahawa Perdana Menteri Qatar, Sheikh Mohammed Abdulrahman Al Thani merupakan sahabatnya kepada dunia.\n\n\"Apa yang telah kita lakukan adalah kedamaian yang luar biasa di Asia Barat, dan mereka adalah faktor yang sangat besar di dalamnya,\" kata Trump.\n\nSetiausaha Negara AS, Marco Rubio, yang baru sahaja pulang dari Israel sebagai sebahagian daripada usaha diplomatik habis-habisan Washington untuk memastikan gencatan senjata Gaza kekal di landasan, turut hadir pada pertemuan dengan pemimpin Qatar itu.\n\nTrump kini dalam perjalanan ke Asia buat kali pertama sejak kembali memegang jawatan pada Januari, dengan dua sidang kemuncak serantau dan pertemuan bersemuka dengan pemimpin China, Xi Jinping, serta pemimpin lain dalam agenda.\n\nQatar memainkan peranan perantara utama dalam rundingan tidak langsung antara Israel dan Hamas sejak tercetusnya perang. \n\nNegara itu adalah antara penjamin perjanjian damai yang rapuh, bersama-sama dengan Mesir, AS dan Turkiye.\n\nEmir Qatar, Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani, sebelum ini menjadi tuan rumah kepada Presiden Turkiye, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, minggu ini untuk membincangkan langkah seterusnya yang sangat sensitif dalam perjanjian itu, termasuk penubuhan pasukan keselamatan di Gaza dan nasib Hamas.\n\nPerdana Menteri Qatar juga telah menjadi perunding utama sejak meletusnya perang berikutan serangan Hamas pada 7 Oktober 2023 ke atas Israel.\n\nRundingan di dalam Air Force One itu berlangsung ketika Israel dilaporkan melancarkan serangan udara yang menyasarkan seorang pejuang Jihad Islam di Gaza.\n\nWalaupun wujud gencatan senjata antara Hamas, sekutu Jihad Islam, dan Israel, pihak Israel menegaskan mereka berhak untuk mempertahankan diri dan tenteranya daripada serangan.\n\n\"Mari kita lihat apa yang mereka lakukan dalam tempoh 48 jam akan datang.

Sadly, the Queen Mother of Thailand has just passed away. I send my condolences to the Great People of Thailand. I will be seeing their wonderful Prime Minister when we land. To accommodate everyone for this major event, we will sign the Peace Deal immediately upon arrival. See you soon! President DJT,” Trump posted on Truth Social.The long-standing border dispute between the two countries escalated in July this year when, over five days, troops clashed, claiming lives and displacing thousands of people on both sides. A ceasefire, mediated by Malaysia, was implemented in late July 2025, and ASEAN observers, coordinated by Malaysia, are monitoring the truce.However, on October 23, Thailand and Cambodia agreed to advance efforts to demarcate their shared boundary following a two-day special meeting of the Joint Commission held in Chanthaburi in Thailand.The joint statement was released after the Cambodia-Thai Joint Commission on Demarcation for the Land Boundary (JBC) was held on October 21-22 and reached several key agreements aimed at advancing and expediting the land demarcation process, according to local media reports from both countries.The two sides have agreed to several immediate actions, confirming that they have assigned the Joint Technical Survey Committee (JTSC) to immediately replace 15 Boundary Pillars at locations and with specifications agreed upon by both sides, the statement read by Bernama news agency. Thailand’s Foreign Minister Sihasak Phuangketkeow has also said both sides are moving closer to finalising the Declaration of Thailand-Cambodia Relations aimed at resolving the border situation. “The ceremony will be witnessed by US President Donald Trump, Malaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim, and other ASEAN leaders,” Sihasak was cited as saying in the Nation.Meanwhile, Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Manet, while releasing the joint statement on the Thai-Cambodia JBC that concluded in Chanthaburi on October 22, said the meeting was conducted “in an atmosphere of friendship and cordiality,” reflecting the two nations’ shared commitment to advancing the ongoing demarcation of their common land boundary through peaceful dialogue and technical cooperation as per Khmer Times.The Cambodian delegation was led by Lam Chea, Minister in charge of the State Secretariat of Border Affairs and Co-Chairman of the Cambodian side, while the Thai delegation was led by Prasas Prasasvinitchai, Advisor to the Minister of Foreign Affairs and Co-Chairman of the Thai side.Cambodia and Thailand have been locked in a decades-long disagreement over the jurisdiction of various non-demarcated areas along their shared land border, which stretches more than 800 kilometres. A central part of the dispute has been competing claims of ownership of the ancient Hindu temples of Prasat Ta Muen Thom and Preah Vihear, which are perched on the Dangrek Mountains that form a natural border between Cambodia and Thailand. In 2011, severe clashes between Cambodian and Thai forces in the vicinity of the Preah Vihear temple resulted in at least 16 deaths. This prompted the UN Security Council to hold a private meeting on February 14, 2011, and to issue a press statement on the same day.

With stricter visa vetting, suspended embassy interviews, and new travel restrictions across 19 countries, the United States has become a far tougher destination for international students.\n\nWhat began as a border-control initiative is now ricocheting through research labs, startup incubators, and classrooms nationwide. The result: America’s long-standing edge in global innovation is showing cracks.\n\nA Record Drop In Global Talent\n\nFall 2025 marks the steepest decline in international student arrivals in modern U.S. history. According to the U.S. Department of Commerce, just over 313,000 student-visa holders entered the country in August 2025 — a 19% decline from nearly 387,000 a year earlier.\n\nThe losses are concentrated in regions that have long supplied top STEM talent: Asia (–24%), Africa (–32%), and the Middle East (–17%), with India alone seeing a 44% plunge, according to The New York Times.\n\nNAFSA: Association of International Educators projects a 15% overall enrollment decline for the 2025–26 academic year — roughly 150,000 fewer students and $7 billion in lost tuition revenue, enough to erase 60,000 U.S. jobs.\n\nVisa Chaos And Revocations\n\nBehind the numbers lies a bureaucratic maze. In May 2025, the U.S. Department of State suspended new student-visa interviews while requiring applicants to make their social-media accounts public for “security screening.” Days later, the administration expanded travel restrictions for nationals from 19 countries, including Iran, Ghana, and Nigeria.\n\nMORE FOR YOU\n\nThe fallout has been particularly severe in China, where Reuters reported widespread panic among students after the U.S. abruptly revoked hundreds of valid visas this summer. Many had already paid deposits or booked flights to American universities. “Helpless” and “anxious,” as Reuters described, they were told only that their visas were void “for security reasons.”\n\nChina represents roughly one in four of all international students in the United States. Each revoked visa isn’t just a disrupted education — it’s a potential lost researcher, engineer, or innovator.\n\nCompetitors Seize The Moment\n\nWhile Washington tightens, rivals are opening their doors. Canada, the U.K., and Australia have moved aggressively to attract displaced talent with faster processing and clear post-graduation pathways.\n\nCanada raised international-student quotas by 20% and cut visa wait times.\n\nThe U.K. reinstated a two-year post-study work visa and eased employment rules.\n\nAustralia extended work rights for STEM graduates to four years and granted full-time work for dependents.\n\nTogether, these countries have positioned themselves as “global education havens” — stable, transparent, and eager to absorb the students America is pushing away.\n\nThe Economic And Innovation Toll\n\nThe U.S. Department of Commerce estimated that international students contributed $43.8 billion to the American economy in 2024. But the economic story runs deeper than tuition. These students are the talent fueling many of America’s labs and startups.\n\nAccording to the National Foundation for American Policy (NFAP), more than half of Silicon Valley startups were founded by immigrants or their children, proof that global talent isn’t a supplement to U.S. innovation; it is the engine.\n\nFrom artificial intelligence and biotechnology to climate research, international students fill the ranks of America’s most critical programs. For technology hubs like Boston, Austin, and San Jose, the policy chill is more than symbolic — it’s a warning.\n\nResearch Labs Feel The Strain\n\nEven elite universities are feeling the tremors.\n\nHarvard University reported that international students made up 15% of this fall’s freshman class, down from 18% last year.\n\nJohns Hopkins and Northwestern University report double-digit drops in international graduate enrollment in STEM, threatening the staffing of key research projects.\n\nUSC, once home to one of the largest international undergraduate populations, has seen steep declines in applications from China and India, forcing a pivot toward domestic recruitment.\n\nBehind each number is a lost contribution — the PhD candidate who might have advanced robotics, the student-founder who could have launched the next billion-dollar company.\n\nA Shrinking Pipeline, A Growing Risk\n\nFor decades, America’s dominance in science and technology has rested on a simple principle: attract the best minds, regardless of where they come from. That model is now breaking.\n\n“Talent mobility is the backbone of the American research economy,” says Dr. Fanta Aw, CEO of NAFSA. “When we make it harder for bright minds to study here, we give our competitors a gift.”\n\nThose competitors are already unwrapping it. Universities abroad are launching joint research programs once anchored in U.S. partnerships. Multinational firms are relocating R&D centers to more immigration-friendly countries. The ripple effects could last a generation.\n\nAmerica’s Innovation Edge — At Risk\n\nThe decline in international students isn’t just an education story; it’s a warning flare for the U.S. innovation ecosystem. As enrollment falls, the country risks hollowing out the very workforce that made it a global technology powerhouse.\n\nShort-term gains — slightly easier admissions for domestic students — mask a long-term threat: a shrinking pool of global talent, slower research progress, and the gradual erosion of America’s reputation as the world’s innovation hub.\n\nIf the United States wants to maintain its lead, it must do more than secure its borders — it must secure its future by keeping its doors open to the minds that drive progress.\n\nEditorial StandardsReprints & Permissions","summary":"President Donald Trump’s second-term immigration crackdown is quietly reshaping American higher education — and, by extension, the foundation of U.S. innovation.","url":"https://www.forbes.com/sites/geekgirlrising/2025/10/25/trumps-student-visa-crackdown-threatens-us-innovation/","image":"https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/68fd5cc4908273810b421183/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-10-25 23:39:14","author":"Contributor,Samantha Walravens","authors":["Contributor","Samantha Walravens"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.119},{"id":372588842,"title":"AAG Dhillon Calms Tensions with Governor Newsom Over DOJ Election Monitoring Plans","text":"The Department of Justice has announced plans to deploy election monitors to California and New Jersey for the 2025 off-year elections, responding to requests from Republican parties in these states. This decision follows reports from the California GOP highlighting alleged irregularities in previous elections.\n\nHowever, California’s Governor, Gavin Newsom, has expressed strong opposition to this initiative. He voiced concerns that the presence of election monitors could lead to voter suppression, describing the move as an overreach. Newsom’s stance has raised eyebrows, particularly given the U.S.’s longstanding practice of sending election monitors to other countries to ensure fair elections. It prompts the question: what might the governor be apprehensive about? If the electoral process is above board, what threat could monitors possibly pose?\nAdding to the debate, Assistant Attorney General Harmeet Dhillon countered Newsom’s argument by pointing out that the use of election monitors within the U.S. is not unprecedented. Her comments served to remind the public that these measures are part of ensuring electoral integrity, not undermining it.\n\nMeanwhile, Newsom’s demeanor, marked by his animated hand gestures, has also captured public attention. Some have noted that these gestures are even more distracting than those of Senate Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries of New York. As the situation unfolds, the dialogue around election transparency and security continues to be a focal point of political discourse.\n\nBut guess who was not happy with this move to help transparency? The slippery California Gov. Gavin Newsom. \n\nDonald Trump’s puppet DOJ has no business screwing around with next month’s election.\nSending the feds into California polling places is a deliberate attempt to scare off voters and undermine a fair election.\nWe will not back down.

The US. even sends election monitors to other countries to secure elections. What is it that Gavin is afraid of? Why would election monitors scare voters? What does he think the monitors are going to find out? If they aren’t doing anything wrong, why is he flipping out? \n\nThen, too, those ridiculous hand motions are so distracting. Frankly, they’re worse than those of Senate Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries (D-NY). \n\nIn a great post, Assistant Attorney General Harmeet Dhillon squashed Newsom’s narrative, reminding him that election monitors in this country aren’t new.\n\nLol calm down bro.

The visit comes as tensions between Washington and Beijing escalate since Trump's threat of fresh US tariffs on China. Speaking to reporters aboard Air Force One, Trump said he may raise the issue of China's import of Russian oil during his talks with Xi. \"I may be discussing it (purchase of Russian oil)... China's cutting back very substantially on the purchase of Russian oil, and India's cutting back completely, and we've imposed sanctions,\" he said. India has, however, consistently rejected Trump's claims that New Delhi would cut down oil imports from Russia, saying that its priority remains \"protecting national interests\".

Trump added that he was optimistic about the discussions, saying he would address agricultural trade and China's role in exporting components used to produce fentanyl. \"I want our farmers to be taken care of, and he wants things also. We're going to be talking about fentanyl. It is killing a lot of people, a lot of people, it comes from China,\" he said. The two leaders are expected to meet on Thursday on the sidelines of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) summit in Gyeongju, South Korea. It will mark their first face-to-face meeting since Trump's return to the White House in January. The two leaders have spoken several times this year, with Trump saying that direct dialogue is the best way to address key issues. This comes day after Trump has threatened to impose new 100% tariffs on Chinese goods and introduce additional trade restrictions starting November 1, in response to Beijing's export curbs on rare earth minerals and related technologies. Meanwhile, with Russia's war in Ukraine entering its fourth year, Washington this week announced its first major sanctions targeting Russia's petroleum sector. The US also warned that foreign financial institutions could face restrictions if they do business with Russian oil giants Rosneft or Lukoil. What's Trump's Schedule in Asia? Trump has hinted he may seek a meeting with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, although the White House has said no such encounter is currently planned. \"You know, they don't have a lot of telephone service,\" Trump told reporters, before urging them to \"put out the word.\" In Malaysia, the President will meet Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim before attending a working dinner with leaders of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN). The White House said Trump will also take part in a signing ceremony for a peace agreement between Cambodia and Thailand, following a deadly border dispute that he has claimed credit for helping to resolve. The President will then travel to Japan — his fourth official visit to the country — for talks with the new prime minister, Sanae Takaichi. In South Korea on Wednesday, Trump is expected to address business leaders at the APEC summit, hold a bilateral meeting with the President, and attend a dinner for attending leaders later that evening.

Together, they have a population of 678 million people and a gross domestic product of $3.9 trillion, according to the Office of the United States Trade Representative.\n\nThis year, ASEAN will induct its 11th member, East Timor. The country gained independence from Indonesia in 2002 and is home to 1.4 million people.\n\nThe summit will bring together leaders from every country in the bloc except for Myanmar’s acting president, Senior General Min Aung Hlaing.\n\nThe ASEAN summit is accompanied annually by the East Asia Summit, a gathering of leaders of the ASEAN nations, the US, China, India, Russia, Japan, South Korea, Australia and New Zealand.\n\nThis year, US President Donald Trump, Chinese Premier Li Qiang, Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese, newly appointed Japanese Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi, South Korean President Lee Jae Myung and New Zealand Prime Minister Christopher Luxon will be attending.\n\nRussian Deputy Prime Minister Alexander Novak will represent Moscow while Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi will take part virtually.\n\nBeyond the leaders of ASEAN and the East Asia Summit nations, Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney and South African President Cyril Ramaphosa will be in Kuala Lumpur too.\n\nThe heads of the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund, the International Labour Organization and the International Federation of Association Football, better known as FIFA, will also attend some sessions, according to Bernama, Malaysia’s state news agency.\n\nWhat events will take place during the summit?\n\nApart from the ASEAN summit and the East Asia Summit, ASEAN will also hold separate conclaves with leaders of key powers in Kuala Lumpur.\n\nThere’s also a peace deal to be signed on Sunday when Cambodia and Thailand ink a pact to end a deadly border dispute. The ceremony will be presided over by Trump and Malaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim, according to Bernama.\n\nThe long-running border conflict rekindled in July when dozens of people were killed and hundreds of thousands displaced along the border. A ceasefire was reached after five days with the help of Malaysia, China and the US.\n\nDespite the high-profile nature of the event, some critics have questioned whether the deal will be more of a photo-op for Trump than a lasting resolution. Ceasefire violations have continued since July while the original issue around border demarcation has also not been resolved, according to Mu Sochua, a former Cambodian opposition leader and president of the Khmer Movement for Democracy.\n\nShe told Al Jazeera the threat of tariffs from Trump helped bring Thailand and Cambodia to the negotiating table in a move that was effective in the short term but also controversial. “Critics in both countries say it amounted to economic blackmail – trading peace for trade benefits rather than addressing justice, sovereignty or local needs,” she said.\n\nWhat will be discussed at the summit? \n\nThe ASEAN summit will discuss pressing issues like US tariffs and access to rare earth minerals, which are essential to high-tech manufacturing and whose production is dominated by China.\n\nTrump launched his “Liberation Day Tariffs” in April against most US trading partners in a bid to lower the US trade deficit. After much negotiation, US tariffs for most ASEAN countries range from 10 to 20 percent while Brunei’s tariff rate is 25 percent. Tariffs for Laos and Myanmar are both 40 percent.\n\nIn response to Trump’s tariffs, China has tightened export restrictions on rare earths, a move that has been felt around the world.\n\nMarco Foster, ASEAN director at the professional services firm Dezan Shira & Associates, told Al Jazeera that most attendees will be vying for a chance to speak to Trump about tariffs. “Pretty much everyone is going to be going after him or trying to get in the room with him or his people to talk about their deal,” he said. “Everyone will want to have a sideline meeting with Trump.”\n\nAttendees are also expected to discuss pressing issues like Myanmar’s civil war and the proliferation of scam centres in Southeast Asia, which have earned criminal networks tens of billions of dollars.\n\nWhy is Myanmar skipping the summit? \n\nMyanmar’s acting president will not attend the ASEAN summit, and Myanmar will not take the helm from Malaysia as next year’s ASEAN chair because it has been embroiled in a civil war since 2021. Instead, the role will fall to the Philippines.\n\nIn 2021, ASEAN issued a Five-Point Consensus, calling for an immediate ceasefire in Myanmar and humanitarian assistance while creating a special ASEAN envoy to help mediate the conflict. Four years later, critics said it has had little impact on the crisis.\n\nCharles Santiago, co-chairman of ASEAN Parliamentarians for Human Rights, told Al Jazeera that he expected Myanmar and the fallout from the civil war to be discussed at the summit.\n\n“Myanmar has become a destabilising factor, both [in terms of] security and social cohesion in the other parts of Southeast Asia,” he said. The civil war has facilitated the spread of the flow of drugs and weapons while creating a refugee crisis, he added.\n\nStill, Santiago said he did not expect much to come from the ASEAN summit. “This will be a major photo opportunity for everybody,” he said, but “nothing much will happen” in terms of policy.\n\nWhat are ASEAN’s limitations?\n\nASEAN has sometimes been criticised for lacking an enforcement mechanism to force members to abide by its rulings. This makes it different from other regional blocs like the European Union, whose members must abide by EU laws and rulings.\n\nIt’s a criticism that has been heard recently around issues like Myanmar as well as the Cambodian-Thai border conflict.\n\nFoster said this feature is a legacy of ASEAN’s unique history. The organisation was founded in 1967 after a major wave of decolonisation around the world. Its structure reflects the norms of the era, he said.\n\n“Because of the narrative that ASEAN was born out of independence, it will never lead to an ASEAN that will limit [member states’] independence by accepting rules from a body that is above the state,” Foster said. “The nation state will always be the number one in ASEAN.”","summary":"The Cambodian-Thai border conflict and the US trade war will feature prominently at Southeast Asian bloc summit.","url":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/10/25/asean-summit-in-malaysia-whos-attending-and-what-to-expect?traffic_source=rss","image":"https://www.aljazeera.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/2025-10-24T084539Z_252615406_RC26IHAQUJ1S_RTRMADP_3_ASEAN-SUMMIT-MALAYSIA-PROTEST-1761297332.jpg?resize=1920%2C1440","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-10-25 23:23:18","author":"Apps Support,Erin Hale","authors":["Apps Support","Erin Hale"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"QA","sentiment":0.174},{"id":372588482,"title":"Irish leaders express concern that more 200,000 spoilt their votes, saying that their unhappiness needs to be understood","text":"It represents 13% of all votes cast on Friday, and a more than tenfold increase on the number of spoilt votes in the last presidential election, when there were 18,438 invalid ballots. In some areas, more than 20% of ballots were spoilt. A number of high-profile campaigners called on people to spoil their ballot papers on the grounds that the final two candidates for the presidency did not give voters a choice on matters such as the scale of immigration into Ireland. The turnout was 46%, up on the 2018 presidential election which had a turnout of 44%. Ireland’s electoral commission has said there “will clearly be a need for deeper and further reflection” about why there were so many spoilt ballots in the presidential election. An Coimisiun Toghchain said the number of spoilt ballots “is significantly higher than normal and it is clear that some people chose to deliberately spoil their votes”. In the Dublin Mid-West constituency, 21% of votes cast were spoilt. Many had an “x” or slash drawn through all three candidates, or the words “spoiled” or “spoilt” written on the slip. There were also a significant number of spoilt votes with anti-Government messages on them, including “no democracy”, “EU puppets” and “no from me”. A number of names were also written on many spoilt ballot papers in the count centre in Adamstown, including Maria Steen, who tried to become a presidential candidate but failed to get enough nominations by the deadline. One ballot paper had a sticker of Mrs Steen on it. Other names seen written on spoilt ballot papers in Adamstown included Enoch Burke, Father Ted, Michael Collins, Bobby Sands, Dustin the Turkey, Donald Duck and Donald Trump. Speaking at Dublin Castle, Irish premier Micheal Martin said: “It’s a worry”. “I think, first of all, people are entitled to vote, people are entitled not to vote, and I suppose people are entitled in our system to spoil their votes,” he said. “You do have to try and interpret and listen to that as best you can. “I think there’s probably an issue with the restrictive nature of how one gets on the ballot, and that’s something that collectively, the Oireachtas can look at, and a lot of parties didn’t nominate candidates this time, so hence, by definition, you’re going to get fewer candidates. “I believe that it’s not fair to say to some parties, and indeed independents, that you must allow someone to get on the ballot even if you disagree fundamentally with their perspectives and their views, I don’t think that makes sense. “But there might be other mechanisms that would allow for a broader representation and to allow people to come through. I think that needs to be looked at.” Irish deputy premier Simon Harris expressed concern about the high number of spoiled ballots and said some voters put “quite a lot of effort in spoiling their ballot”. He said it showed “the number of people in Ireland now who are clearly feeling disaffected or disconnected with politics”. Dublin Mid-West TD for Sinn Fein, Eoin O Broin, said the spoiled votes meant that there are “people out there who are very angry, who are very unhappy”. “Our job in the time ahead is to try and convince more of those people that there is an alternative, there is a message of hope, and we hear the fact that they are not happy. So, there is a job of work to do afterwards.” People Before Profit TD Paul Murphy said he did not think it was a “moral failing” to spoil votes, and that it was a “legitimate choice that people can make”. “There is going to be a challenge for everybody in politics, but I would say for the left in particular, that there is a group of people who are very disaffected, very alienated, very angry at the political system.”","summary":"Ireland’s political leaders have expressed concern at the huge number of 213,738 spoilt votes in the Irish presidential

Reagan during the World Series.\n\nAs the Toronto Blue Jays were on their way to winning the opening game by an 11-4 score over the Los Angeles Dodgers, an anti-tariffs ad featuring edited comments made by Reagan regarding his tariffs on Japanese goods.\n\nThe ad spurred Trump to follow through on an earlier threat to increase the tariff on Canadian goods exported to the United States.\n\n\"Canada was caught red-handed, putting up a fraudulent advertisement on Ronald Reagan's speech on tariffs,\" Trump said Saturday in a Truth Social post.\n\n\"The sole purpose of this fraud was Canada's hope that the United States Supreme Court will come to their 'rescue' on tariffs that they have used for years to hurt the United States,\" the president said.\n\n\"Ronald Reagan loved tariffs for the purpose of national security and the economy, but Canada said he didn't,\" Trump added.\n\nThe president said Canada was supposed to immediately cease airing the ad and remove it, but \"they let it run last night during the World Series, knowing that it was a fraud.\"\n\n\"Because of their serious misrepresentation of the facts and hostile act, I am increasing the tariff on Canada by 10% over and above what they are paying now,\" Trump added.\n\nReagan made the comments during an April 25, 1987, radio address to defend his tariff policy, but the Ontario government used and edited them without permission from the Ronald Reagan Presidential Foundation and Institute.\n\nThe Ontario ad runs for a minute and edits the former president's comments, which Trump and others have called \"misleading.\"\n\nOntario Premier Doug Ford said the ad's intent is to \"initiate a conversation\" with U.S. officials and to reach \"U.S. audiences at the highest levels,\" CBS News reported.\n\nThe U.S. imposes a 10% tariff on Canadian energy, energy resources and potash and 35% for all other products that are not exempted by the United States-Mexico-Canada trade agreement,

And the urgency of transforming Australia from the lucky country that we are into a smart country, starts with the realisation that if we are not able to make something here and find a customer, ideally globally, the country we are living in … will not be the same in 20 years.”\n\nDr Goennemann believes the end of that runway is fast approaching.\n\n“I would think we have maybe 15 years,” he said.\n\n“It sounds long, but in order to build the capability … if you convince young people to take up a role, educate them, have them gain some experience, before we even have the workforce the decade is gone. So we need to do something now.” \n\nOf Australia’s roughly 47,000 manufacturers, 90 per cent employ fewer than 20 people. AMGC blames this missing middle of medium-sized companies on the nation’s lack of focus on commercialisation and scaling of goods and services.\n\nIt’s so difficult in Australia to scale a business from small to medium and then onto large that the country has lost many of its most promising manufacturers abroad.\n\n“We need to focus on the areas of strength, focus on the small companies who are very capable and give the best of them a leg up to help them to scale and build medium-sized companies,” Dr Goennemann said.\n\nPart of the shift will mean changing perception about manufacturing itself – away from politicians in high-vis vests on shop floors during election campaigns.\n\nProduction, which employs less than half of the manufacturing workforce, is “probably the least competitive and least value-adding” step, especially in a high-cost country, Dr Goennemann notes.\n\nAustralia must embrace the entire chain – starting with research and development, design and logistics, and later distribution, sale and services.\n\nIt will also mean less focus on finished goods, which make for nice photo ops when they roll out of the factory, but only account for 30 per cent of global trade.\n\nThe other 70 per cent are intermediate goods – widgets, materials and components that “nobody has ever heard of” but play an essential role in global value chains.\n\nWork smarter\n\nAustralian businesses face many challenges, but number one is high costs – chiefly energy.\n\nMeanwhile, lack of policy certainty stifles investment and long-term planning, red tape strangles productivity, and despite programs like Labor’s $23 billion Future Made in Australia or the $15 billion National Reconstruction Fund, critics argue the money doesn’t go where it could really make a difference.\n\n“If I look at our European friends, the policy blunders they have made in the last number of years where ideology was driving a lot of the policymaking, for example in energy, has really hurt manufacturers and I fear we are making similar mistakes here,” chief executive of Melbourne’s ANCA Group Martin Ripple said.\n\nCheap power, which underpinned decades of Australian manufacturing from cars and tyres to textiles and steel, is now a distant memory.\n\nSince 2000, electricity prices have increased by 206 per cent and gas prices have increased by 334 per cent, far outpacing overall inflation rate.\n\nWhile thousands of businesses have hit the rocks, many have learnt to adapt and thrive.\n\nAnd they all say the same thing – we can’t compete on cost, so we have to build better products.\n\nWatch aficionados may be familiar with Nicholas Hacko Watchmaker (NHW), the family-owned business which has been making high-quality precision timepieces in Sydney since 2016 – the country’s only local manufacturer.\n\nLesser known to the general public is NH Micro, which sprung from the watchmaker’s vertically integrated model, having been forced by a Swiss parts embargo to build its own from scratch Down Under.\n\nToday NH Micro has exploded to become one of the world’s leading precision parts manufacturers.\n\n“Six years ago we started to get approached by parallel precision industries outside the watchmaking sector to manufacture their very complex, precise mechanical components,” Nicholas Hacko’s son Josh, who serves as technical director for both companies, said.\n\n“That then transitioned into a fully fledged business – more than three quarters of our revenue comes from this side hustle.”\n\nNH Micro now supplies “the largest space companies in the world, the largest quantum computing companies in the world, the largest medical device manufacturers”.\n\nNH Micro’s “ultra high-demand” components are found in pacemakers, in Cochlear implants, in satellites for internet communication – and pretty soon, on the moon.\n\nCan’t compete on cost\n\nANCA Group is another Aussie success story – a manufacturer of manufacturing.\n\nThe 50-year-old company is one of the world’s leading makers of CNC grinding machines – exporting 99 per cent of its products to more than 45 countries, with clients including Airbus, Apple and major car manufacturers.\n\n“We like to say that every high precision part in the world is somewhat touched by an ANCA tool,” CEO Mr Ripple said.\n\n“Wherever metal parts are cut, drilled, milled, chamfered, ANCA has been somewhat involved. We believe 1.2 billion tools have been made on our machines over the years. \n\n“Those tools work turbine blades, they are used for iPhones, laptops, they make orthopaedic parts such as knee replacements,” he said.\n\nAt the time ANCA entered the market, for a customer to buy a five-tonne CNC machine out of Australia “would have been a crazy decision”.\n\n“So we had to be several years ahead of our competition by having the best machines, the most reliable, the most precise in the market,” Mr Ripple said. \n\nREDARC chief executive Anthony Kittel purchased the Adelaide business in 1997 when it was a still a small eight-person cottage industry supplier of power products for the local automotive and trucking industry.\n\nToday REDARC employs 400 people and is a global leader in rugged, advanced electronics systems built to withstand harsh conditions, exporting to 38 countries across new sectors including 4x4, off-grid, mining, defence and space.\n\nWhen Mr Kittel took over, the business was bringing in revenue of less than $1 million – today it’s more than $150 million.\n\n“[Our success] comes from solving the customer need and developing a high-quality product people are prepared to pay a premium for,” Mr Kittel said.\n\n“One that doesn’t fail, that’s guaranteed to survive the journey if you’re driving to the Simpson Desert, Cape York or Broome or overlanding in the US – extreme temperatures, vibration, dust, moisture, water.\n\n“The second side of it is by doing smart design and smart manufacturing, making sure we can keep our manufacturing costs as low as possible without impacting on quality – so automation, techniques called design for manufacture where you want smart designs that a robot can assemble.”\n\nMr Kittel said a key driver of REDARC’s success is its heavy investment in research and development. Every year since 2002, the company has invested 15 per cent of total sales revenue back into research and development, growing from one design engineer to around 140 in that time.\n\n‘Adult in the room’\n\nFor Mr Kittel, red tape is one of his biggest headaches. \n\n“The compliance side of things is getting more and more bureaucratic,” he said.\n\n“The red tape around reporting on a whole bunch of different things as a business, we have to almost employ people (just to fill in forms).” \n\nMr Ripple estimates the “never-ending additional regulatory burden” has added 5-6 per cent to ANCA’s costs over the past decade.\n\n“You’re coming to a point where it becomes less and less attractive to do business in Australia,” he said.\n\nFrom REDARC’s perspective, Mr Kittel would also like to see better tax incentives for research and development – and for Prime Minister Anthony Albanese to strike a deal with Donald Trump on tariffs.\n\n“We’ve had really good growth in the US, working hard for so many years,” Mr Kittel said.\n\n“Suddenly there’s 10 per cent and even 25 per cent on automotive parts, or 50 per cent with anything metal in it. It’s just astounding. It’s like putting a pin in the balloon.”\n\nThis article is part of the Back Australia series, which was supported by Australian Made Campaign, Harvey Norman, Westpac, Bunnings, Coles, TechnologyOne, REA Group, Cadbury, R.M.Williams, Qantas, Vodafone and BHP.","summary":"While Australian manufacturing faces a critical 15-year countdown, this tiny Sydney workshop is showing how local businesses can beat the odds in global markets.","url":"https://www.news.com.au/finance/business/manufacturing/we-have-15-years-time-running-out-for-australia-to-turn-its-luck-into-smarts/news-story/90e9df675a86110e00bc000b932a1778?from=rss-basic","image":"https://content.api.news/v3/images/bin/d99ac5b37c154cd9d759ea3e65c44174","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-10-25 23:17:47","author":"Frank Chung","authors":["Frank Chung"],"language":"en","source_country":"au","sentiment":0.278},{"id":372590776,"title":"Prosecutor who declined to charge Letitia James with bank fraud fired after 'mishandling evidence'","text":"A Virginia federal prosecutor who refused to press bank fraud charges against New York Attorney General Letitia James was fired for allegedly mishandling evidence from the case. \n\nAssistant US Attorney Elizabeth Yusi was booted from the Eastern District of Virginia's Norfolk office earlier this month after allegedly sending documents with James' personally identifying information to her non-work email, CNN reported.\n\nSources close to the situation told the outlet that the supposedly botched handling of the case was at least a factor in her dismissal. \n\nYusi had opposed charging James with bank fraud and making false statements to a financial institution in connection with a 2020 property purchase in Norfolk. \n\nThe ex-prosecutor, who had worked with the Department of Justice since 2010, reportedly penned an internal memo explaining why there was insufficient evidence against James. \n\nShe was fired alongside fellow assistant attorney Kristin Bird, who also opposed the Trump administration's pursuit of the criminal case against the Democrat AG, CBS reported. \n\nFollowing Yusi's reluctance, Donald Trump-appointed interim US Attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia, Lindsey Halligan, filed the indictment against James herself. \n\nMargaret Donovan, Yusi's lawyer, has denied any accusations that her client breached any confidential information. \n\nShe said that Yusi 'has never used her personal email account for any portion of any investigation' and has 'no record of any such email.'\n\n'Ms. Yusi is a well-respected prosecutor, a leader among her peers, and a consummate professional with nearly two decades of experience,' Donovan said. \n\nWhile sharing investigative evidence is generally not against the law, it violates the DOJ's policy. \n\nThe criminal case against James had sparked internal controversy within the Virginia federal prosecutor's office. \n\nTrump-loyalist Halligan had even expressed concerns that attorneys in her office were leaking private case information to the press. \n\nBeyond the Virginia office, Democrats have slammed the indictment as politically charged because Trump told Attorney General Pam Bondi to go after James, former FBI director James Comey and Senator Adam Schiff.\n\nOn Friday, James pleaded not guilty to the two felony charges stemming from the case, in which Halligan and other federal prosecutors allege she misled a bank while purchasing the $109,600 Norfolk home to obtain a more favorable loan. \n\nOutside the courthouse after entering her plea, James told supporters that her prosecution was 'weaponizing the DOJ for revenge' by the Trump administration.\n\n'I will not be deterred. I will not be distracted. I will do my job each and every day and that's why I'm heading back to New York because there is work to be done.'\n\nJames has been accused of claiming her three-bedroom Virginia residence as a second residential home rather than an investment property.\n\nIn allegedly doing so, she was able to obtain better terms on her mortgage agreement. The indictment claims she saved nearly $19,000. \n\nJames' lawyers plan to have the case thrown out by arguing that the Justice Department improperly appointed Halligan, according to court filings. \n\nBut if she is found guilty on both counts, she faces up to 60 years in prison and a maximum fine of $2 million. \n\nJames has long been a political adversary of Trump after she successfully sued the president and his Trump Organization for fraud.\n\nA New York judge ordered Trump to pay $500 million penalty in early 2024 before he won the election.

There are others. If you look at India and Pakistan. I could say almost any one of the deals that I’ve already done I thought would have been more difficult than Russia and Ukraine, but it didn’t work out that way,” President Trump said while interacting with presspersons aboard Air Force One. President Trump made these comments when asked about the possibility of resuming a meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin, with plans for an earlier meeting currently suspended indefinitely. He also claimed that the Russian President praised him for his efforts in brokering peace in various other conflicts, including in Azerbaijan and Armenia, while saying that the Russia-Ukraine war is the most challenging thing to solve. “I’m going to have to know that we’re going to have a deal (with Putin). I’m not going to be wasting my time. I’ve always had a very great relationship with Vladimir Putin, but this has been very disappointing. I thought this would have gotten done before peace in the Middle East. We have Azerbaijan, Armenia – that was very tough. In fact, Putin told me on the phone he said, ‘Boy, that was amazing’ because everybody tried to get that done and they couldn’t,” Trump mentioned. Trump is travelling to Malaysia to attend the upcoming ASEAN summit. He stopped at the Al-Udeid Air Base in Doha, Qatar, where he welcomed Emir of Qatar Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani and Qatar’s Prime Minister Mohammed bin Abdulrahman bin Jassim Al Thani aboard the plane.During the press gaggle, the US president expressed confidence in achieving lasting peace in the Middle East, while warning Hamas of serious consequences if the ceasefire agreement with Israel is violated. “I think it (ceasefire) will hold. Well, if it doesn’t hold, it’s Hamas. Hamas will not be hard to deal with very quickly. I hope it holds for Hamas too because they gave us their world on something, so I think it’s going to hold, and if it doesn’t, then they’ll have a very big problem,” he said. The US President is on a three-nation tour, during which, after Malaysia, he is set to visit Japan and South Korea. While in Kuala Lumpur for the summit, President Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping will hold talks to prevent an escalation of their trade war.The threatened tariffs and other trade curbs would take effect on November 1 in retaliation for China’s expanded export controls on rare-earth magnets and minerals. Recent actions include an expanded US export blacklist covering thousands more Chinese firms. Through engagement with Asian leaders, Trump aims to negotiate favourable trade agreements, reduce tariffs, and boost US exports, with his return to Asia potentially redefining regional trade and diplomacy.

They emphasize their ongoing commitment to maintaining the independence of the federal judiciary.\n\nTheir brief cautions that the Trump administration’s stance could undermine the judiciary’s role in the crucial tariffs case currently under consideration by the Supreme Court.\n\nThe judges stress the importance of respecting the separation of powers, ensuring that any legislative power delegated to the President undergoes thorough judicial scrutiny.\n\nThis legal battle encompasses a series of cases initiated by diverse groups challenging Trump’s tariff policies.\n\nIn mid-April, V.O.S. Selections, an alcohol importer, and other businesses filed a lawsuit against the tariffs, citing issues such as pricing chaos, shipping disruptions, limited product selection, inventory challenges, cash flow problems, and reduced purchase orders. By late April, 12 states led by Democratic administrations had similarly contested Trump’s tariffs. These cases have since been consolidated.\n\nIn late May, the consolidated plaintiffs won the argument – securing a formal kibosh on the tariffs by a unanimous three-judge panel on the Court of International Trade. But in real terms, that ruling was immediately stayed by a 10-judge panel on the appellate court. Then, in August, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit ruled against the tariffs again – and also stayed its own ruling until Oct. 14 to give the government time to appeal to the Supreme Court.\n\nIn early September, the Trump administration filed their petition for a writ of certiorari, warning an end to Trump’s claimed tariffs powers would place America on the “brink” of economic “catastrophe.”\n\nThe major question before the court is whether or not the president has the power to unilaterally impose tariffs under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA).\n\nEach court to review the question has answered in the negative.\n\nThe ex-judges, in their amicus brief, phrased the matter slightly differently. First, they say, the IEEPA question is more a matter of whether Congress has ceded such broad authority to the president. And, second, whether the legality of the president’s actions is beyond the scope of judicial review.\n\nAs for the IEEPA issue, the amici say the federal government is arguing “to uphold the transfer of total authority to set tariffs to the President.”\n\n“[F]or a delegation to pass constitutional muster, Congress must ‘lay down by legislative act an intelligible principle to which the person or body to fix such rates is directed to conform,’” the amicus brief argues. “Here by contrast, the IEEPA provides no standards to guide the president in determining the countries on which tariffs should be imposed, the goods that should be subject to a tariff, or the rate of such tariffs.”\n\nPrior delegations of such powers allowed by the law have involved specific and prescriptive details – surpassing even guidelines as to their specificity – and “an intelligible principle” with which the president must “conform,” the judges say. But, they insist, nothing like that is happening here.\n\n“According to President Trump, he can do whatever he wants when it comes to tariffs, imposing them (as he has) even on countries that do not contribute to America’s drug-trafficking problem and have no negative balance of payments with the United States,” the brief goes on. “We respectfully submit that this is not the law. Under our Constitution, and its careful allocation and separation of powers, Congress cannot hand its tariff-setting authority over to the President lock, stock, and barrel, allowing him to aim it whenever, wherever, and however he pleases.”\n\nOn the second issue – of judicial review over tariff-setting – the onetime judges portend an even more dire state of affairs, warning of unmitigated power metastasizing indefinitely into amalgam both familiar and abhorrent to U.S. history, politics, and law.\n\nFrom the amicus brief, at length:\n\n[T]his Court should reject the Solicitor General’s argument that courts lack the power to decide whether there were, in fact, “unusual and extraordinary” threats that justified the President’s use of the powers assertedly conferred by IEEPA. Giving the President the unreviewable authority to decide whether he may exercise emergency powers would be antithetical to the balance of powers that our founders established as the bedrock of the Constitution…it is the province of the judicial branch to determine whether the President has gone beyond what the law allows.\n\n“For this court to rule that the president alone can exercise unlimited legislative powers without judicial review of a determination that a national emergency exists would give the president tyrannical powers,” the brief continues. “Alexander Hamilton observed in The Federalist No. 47: ‘The accumulation of all powers, legislative, executive and judiciary, in the same hands, . . . may justly be pronounced the very definition of tyranny.’”","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nPresident Donald Trump listens to a question from a reporter as he&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Former Judges Invoke Alexander Hamilton in Cautionary Message to Supreme Court Regarding Trump first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/crime/former-judges-invoke-alexander-hamilton-in-cautionary-message-to-supreme-court-regarding-trump/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Ex-judges-use-Alexander-Hamilton-to-warn-SCOTUS-about-Trump.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-10-25 23:08:35","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.031},{"id":372590222,"title":"Trump sends bulldozers in to level a useless wing of the White House - and rich liberals lose their minds, writes TANYA GOLD","text":"Donald Trump has reduced the East Wing of the White House to rubble to build a $300 million ballroom.

It’s true, the East Wing was ancient for America. It was built in 1902.\n\nBesides, for a people who profess to love the White House, they spend a lot of time watching it blow up on screen. Have you seen White House Down? It’s excellent.\n\nI’m not saying Donald Trump hasn’t done terrible things – I was there the day his Chinooks terrorised the reed warblers of Regent’s Park when he stayed at the Ambassador’s residence there in 2018 – but this isn’t one of them.\n\nThere was a reason to demolish the East Wing: it’s not big enough for state dinners. The State Dining Room takes 140 and the East Room 200, and America needs more friends than that. So, they had them in tents in the garden and everyone was sad. \n\nThe lawn was sad – it was ruined. The presidential helicopter Marine One was sad – it couldn’t land. And the dignitaries were sad because on the most gilded day of their lives they had to use portapotties. \n\nEven the kitchen staff were sad – it can’t be easy serving a state dinner in a gazebo. But I doubt rich liberals care about the kitchen staff.\n\nThe ballroom will be vulgar. Of course it will be. Have you seen Trump Tower? Have you seen Las Vegas? Have you seen America? Trump Tower looks like sex Lego. Las Vegas looks like the inside of a Bond villain’s head.\n\nThe ballroom will be vast and white and gold. The drawings look like, well, a tiny bit fell off ‘Germania’ – Hitler’s ideal Berlin – and dropped into a bucket of paint.\n\nBut I have studied the aesthetics of tyranny, and its architecture is the least awful thing about it. Emperor Augustus found Rome in brick and left it in marble, and all that: and rich Liberals should be the first ones to appreciate it.\n\nDo you remember when President Obama teased Trump at the White House Correspondents’ Association Dinner in 2011?\n\nHe presented a garish vision of a Trump White House resort, complete with a giant neon sign and the inscription: ‘Hotel. Casino. Golf Course.’ A joke became a prophecy.\n\nAnd this is why Trump does it. Because it drives his opponents insane and they can’t think of anything else. Least of all beating him. Perhaps the more honest ones will look at the rubble and know – the rubble is me?\n\nIn the UK we are so scared of, ahem, amending public buildings. Just look at the Palace of Westminster – it’s a fire waiting to happen, riddled with asbestos, the stonework is exploding, no one knows what wiring has been stuffed into what crevice and the basement smells like hell.\n\nWhen my local MP asked me if I had any questions for him, I just said: ‘Do you know where your fire exit is?’ If anyone other than our elected representatives and their staff worked there, there would be an outcry. They have been promising to fix it for years. \n\nBut democracy costs money – £22 billion and rising in this case – and they kick it into the long grass. It’s the British way. One day you will turn on News At Ten and it will be there, just on fire.\n\nBuckingham Palace, too, is surprisingly untouchable for an ordinary – very ordinary – eighteenth century aristocratic house with a repulsive 1913 frontage. While it has a nice garden, I give it that, the building’s so horrible even the King doesn’t want to live in it.\n\nShould a future Prime Minister Farage look at the Palace of Westminster or Buckingham Palace and simply say: ‘It isn’t working, I am going to replace it with a building shaped like a pint glass but concrete’ I wouldn’t judge him on that. Or not just on that. \n\nBuildings don’t matter. People do. You can love the past of bricks, badges and flags too much.\n\nIt isn’t always better, and people who loathe Trump being in the White House or the prospect of Farage in Number 10 should know that more than anyone.","summary":"The East Wing isn't big enough for state dinners.

The court is set to decide next month whether the Trump administration can enforce extensive global tariffs without Congressional approval.\n\nThe 60-second ad pulled from a radio address made by Reagan as he explained why he was placing tariffs on Japanese electronics. The substance of his remarks appear to be unaltered.\n\n‘Let’s take Ronald Reagan’s words and let’s blast it to the American people,’ Ford said upon launching the campaign. ‘We’re going to repeat that message to every Republican district there is right across the entire country.’\n\nIn the ad, Reagan explains how tariffs can appear to beneficial to Americans at first, but argued the short term gains do not last.\n\n‘When someone says, “Let’s impose tariffs on foreign imports,” it looks like they’re doing the patriotic thing by protecting American products and jobs,’ Reagan said.\n\n‘And sometimes for a short while it works, but only for a short time. But over the long run, such trade barriers hurt every American, worker and consumer.’\n\nReagan then claimed: ‘High tariffs inevitably lead to retaliation by foreign countries and the triggering of fierce trade wars. Then the worst happens. Markets shrink and collapse, businesses and industries shut down and millions of people lose their jobs.’\n\nOn Thursday, the Ronald Reagan Presidential Foundation & Institute said the 40th president was taken out of context but offered no further explanation.\n\n‘The ad misrepresents the Presidential Radio Address, and the Government of Ontario did not seek nor receive permission to use and edit the remarks,’ the institute wrote on X.\n\nThe institute added that it was ‘reviewing its legal options in this matter’ before linking people to Reagan’s full address.\n\nAfter conservative outrage spread online, Ontario, Canada’s largest province, said it would pull the ad starting Monday.\n\nThat means it will still air Saturday night during Game 2 of the World Series between the Toronto Blue Jays and the Los Angeles Dodgers.\n\n‘They could have pulled it tonight,’ Trump told reporters at the White House as prepared to leave for his trip to Asia.\n\n‘Well, that’s dirty play,’ he added. ‘But I can play dirtier than they can, you know.’\n\nFord said on social media that he pulled the ad after speaking with Prime Minister Mark Carney, who has been trying to negotiate with Trump on trade for months. The two men are members of opposing parties.\n\n‘Our intention was always to initiate a conversation about the kind of economy that Americans want to build and the impact of tariffs on workers and businesses,’ Ford said. ‘We’ve achieved our goal, having reached U.S. audiences at the highest levels.’\n\nFor now, the vast majority of trade between the US and Canada remains protected by the USMCA.\n\nBut the agreement has to be renegotiated in July 2026, and Trump has already called for a revision that would favor US industries.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nPresident Donald Trump has announced a 10 percent tariff increase on Canadian&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Trump Raises Tariffs on Canada Following Controversial Ronald Reagan Ad Claims first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/news/trump-raises-tariffs-on-canada-following-controversial-ronald-reagan-ad-claims/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Trump-hikes-tariffs-on-Canada-over-fraudulent-Ronald-Reagan-ad.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-10-25 22:59:42","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.148},{"id":372589860,"title":"‘I am not done’: Kamala Harris considering a 2028 presidential run","text":"“I have lived … a life of service, and it’s in my bones.

We recognise that policy has fundamentally changed from the policy in the 1980s, 1990s, and 2000s.”\n\nCarney noted that Canada’s negotiators had been making “a lot of progress” in talks with their US counterparts, particularly on key sectors such as steel, aluminium, and energy.\n\n“Our officials have been working with their American colleagues on detailed, constructive negotiations. We stand ready to pick up on that progress and build on that progress when the Americans are ready to have those discussions,” he added.\n\nCarney’s remarks came hours after President Trump said late Thursday that he was ending all trade negotiations with Canada, citing a recent video advertisement produced by Ontario’s provincial government.\n\nThe ad featured archival footage of former US President Ronald Reagan criticising tariffs, footage Trump described as “fake”.\n\n“TARIFFS ARE VERY IMPORTANT TO THE NATIONAL SECURITY, AND ECONOMY, OF THE U.S.A.,” Trump wrote on Truth Social.\n\n“Based on their egregious behaviour, ALL TRADE NEGOTIATIONS WITH CANADA ARE HEREBY TERMINATED.”\n\nWhite House National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett on Friday said the decision reflected the President’s “frustration” with the Canadians over trade negotiations.\n\n“I think the President is very frustrated with Canada, and he has a right to be,” Hassett told Fox News, adding that Canadian negotiators had been “very difficult to negotiate with” and that “frustration has built up over time”.\n\nThe latest dispute adds new uncertainty to one of the world’s largest bilateral trading relationships.\n\nTrump has imposed a 35 per cent tariff on some of Canada’s exports and has repeatedly suggested that Canada should be the 51st US state.","summary":"Washington, Oct 26 (IANS) US President Donald Trump has slapped an additional 10 per cent tariffs on Canada, blaming its northern neighbour of running a &#8220;fraudulent advertisement&#8221; on former President&#8230; Continue reading Trump slaps additional 10 pc tariffs on Canada over ad dispute (Lead)\n\n\nThe post Trump slaps additional 10 pc tariffs on Canada over ad dispute (Lead) first appeared on Australia India News.","url":"https://indianews.com.au/trump-slaps-additional-10-pc-tariffs-on-canada-over-ad-dispute-lead/","image":"https://iansportalimages.s3.amazonaws.com/thumbnails/202510263553150.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-10-25 22:48:32","author":"India News Newsdesk","authors":["India News Newsdesk"],"language":"en","source_country":"AU","sentiment":-0.07},{"id":372582266,"title":"Donald Trump's week in Asia: BBC correspondents on the wins and potential losses","text":"By Jake Kwon, Seoul correspondent \n\nFor South Korean President Lee Jae Myung, the pressing issue is Trump's tariffs.\n\nBut that thunder was briefly stolen by rampant speculation that Trump might visit the border to see North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.\n\nBack in August, Lee dedicated most of his time in the Oval Office to flatter Trump as a \"peacemaker\". Trump responded with enthusiasm to the prospect of sitting down with Kim, who he hasn't seen since 2019.

Talks to lower US duties on South Korean exports from 25% to 15% have stalled, despite multiple trips by Seoul officials to Washington.

Before that, the “Daisy” political ad, created for U.S. President Lyndon B. Johnson’s campaign against Barry Goldwater, was pulled from the air for fear-mongering in 1964 — but also deemed tremendously effective.\n\nAnd late Thursday night, a 60-second spot from Ontario, Canada, based on excerpts from a 1987 radio address by former U.S. President Ronald Reagan, caused President Donald Trump to end all trade talks between the two nations. The move threatens to further damage a bilateral trading relationship worth approximately $900 billion annually.\n\nOntario Premier Doug Ford announced Friday afternoon the province would stop running the ads — but only after they aired during the two opening World Series baseball games this weekend. The move seemed to do little to placate Trump, who told reporters later Friday he was satisfied with the current trade arrangement with Canada and had no plans to meet Prime Minister Mark Carney during summits in Asia over the next week.\n\nWhile it’s too early to gauge the lasting effect of the campaign, its immediate impact was dramatic. Online views of the ad spiked, even as efforts to suppress it grew, a phenomenon sometimes referred to as the “Streisand Effect.”\n\nAs of 7:30 a.m. Friday in Toronto, the original social-media post from Ford containing the ad had been viewed 578,000 times over eight days. Five hours later, that figure was a million. By Saturday morning, it had reached 1.5 million.\n\n“The funny irony here is that in the wake of Trump’s post, now the whole world knows what Reagan said about tariffs as opposed to this just being targeted ads by the Ontario government,” said Bank of Nova Scotia economist Derek Holt.\n\nWhen the province announced the C$75 million ($54 million) ad spend, it said it would air on stations including Fox, NBC, CBS, ABC, ESPN, Newsmax and Bloomberg Television.\n\nSeventy-five million dollars is a “pretty sizable number,” especially for a Canadian advertising budget, said Brian Wieser, a former advertising executive who now works as a Wall Street analyst covering advertising companies. “There’s more money spent on political advertising alone in the United States than spent on all advertising in Canada.”\n\nBut what matters most is having a clear media strategy, including knowing who your target audience is, he said. “What was the goal? The goal is to reverse American policy, I guess,” he said. “Were they intending to needle Trump? I don’t know if that was actually part of the brief.”\n\nFord has said the ad was meant to target Republican-held districts in the U.S., and that he hoped the “Reagan Republicans” would win against “the MAGA group” in the debate over protectionist trade policies.\n\nThe 60-second spot, unveiled by Ford on Oct. 16, is a lesson in simplicity. It opens with the instantly recognizable voice of Reagan, also a famous Hollywood actor, over shots of bucolic American farmland, but then takes a darker tone as he outlines all of the reasons he says protectionism is dangerous.\n\nThe images shift to boarded-up businesses, grocery bills being scrutinized and American families forced to move out of their homes. In a nostalgic tug, Reagan delivers his last sentence on an old-fashioned television screen. “America’s jobs and growth are at stake,” he warns, dressed in an everyman plaid shirt, sitting in a cozy paneled room at Camp David, Maryland.\n\nThe ad ends with the words “Ontario Canada” superimposed over a shot of the Ambassador Bridge connecting Windsor, Ontario, and Detroit, Michigan.\n\nThe Ronald Reagan Presidential Foundation & Institute said the advertisement used selective audio and video clips, and Trump complained it was “fake.” While the Ontario ad left out the context that Reagan was explaining his decision to add tariffs to some Japanese goods, he described it as a “special case,” and overall extolled the benefits of free trade.\n\nIn the coming days and weeks, the validity of the maxim “there is no such thing as bad publicity” is set to be tested, as Canada waits to see if the U.S. will resume trade talks. The two nations had been progressing in negotiations on lowering steel and aluminum tariffs, potentially in exchange for greater U.S. access to Canadian energy.\n\n“Judging the effectiveness of an advertising campaign is an art form,” said Wieser. “It is the story of the hour. It remains to be seen how much durability this story has.”\n\nWith assistance from Mark Bergen.\n\n©2025 Bloomberg L.P. Visit bloomberg.com.

Ontario Premier Doug Ford said he would pull the ad after the weekend, and it ran Friday night during the first game of the World Series.\n\n“Their Advertisement was to be taken down, IMMEDIATELY, but they let it run last night during the World Series, knowing that it was a FRAUD,” Trump said in a post on his Truth Social platform as he flew aboard Air Force One to Malaysia.\n\n“Because of their serious misrepresentation of the facts, and hostile act, I am increasing the Tariff on Canada by 10% over and above what they are paying now.”\n\nIt was unclear what legal authority Trump would use to impose the additional import taxes. The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment on when the 10% hike would come into effect, and whether it would apply to all Canadian goods.\n\nCanada’s economy has been hit hard by Trump’s tariffs, and Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney has been trying to work with Trump to lower them. More than three-quarters of Canadian exports go to the U.S., and nearly $3.6 billion Canadian ($2.7 billion U.S.) worth of goods and services cross the border daily.\n\nA spokesperson for Carney didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nMany Canadian products have been hit with a 35% tariff, while steel and aluminum face rates of 50%. Energy products have a lower rate of 10%, while the vast majority of goods are covered by the U.S.-Canada-Mexico Agreement, and are exempt from tariffs. That trade agreement is slated for review. Trump negotiated the deal in his first term, but has since soured on it.\n\nTrump and Carney will both attend the Association of Southeast Asian Nations summit in Malaysia.

Russia’s War On Ukraine: News And Information From Ukraine","text":"KHARKIV, UKRAINE - OCTOBER 22: Emergency workers rescue children after the Russian drone strike on a kindergarten in Kharkiv, Ukraine on October 22, 2025. (Photo by Ukranian Presidency / Handout/Anadolu via Getty Images)\nAnadolu via Getty Images\n\nDispatches from Ukraine. Day 1,340.\n\nRussian Attacks on Ukraine\n\nWaves of Russian missiles and drones battered Ukraine overnight on October 22, killing six people, including two children, and wounding dozens more. The large-scale bombardment occurred just hours after reports that a planned meeting between Russian President Vladimir Putin and U.S. President Donald Trump in Budapest, Hungary, had been canceled.\n\nRussia’s barrage involved some 400 drones and 28 missiles, of which the Ukrainian Air Force intercepted and electronically jammed 349 projectiles; the rest pounded Kyiv and hit apartment blocks, hospitals and energy infrastructure in other major cities, triggering emergency power outages in most regions of Ukraine.\n\nIn the nation’s second biggest city, Kharkiv, three Russian Shahed drones slammed into a private kindergarten, killing one person and wounding seven others. Footage from the scene showed firefighters carrying children through thick smoke. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy condemned the strike, which destroyed the second floor of the building, writing on X: “There is no justification for a drone strike on a kindergarten, nor can there ever be.”\n\nIn addition, between October 21 and 23, Russian strikes killed at least nine people and wounded 94 others. The attacks occurred in the southern Kherson and eastern Donetsk provinces, and in the southeastern Zaporizhzhia, central Dnipropetrovsk and northeastern Kharkiv regions.\n\nMORE FOR YOU\n\nNew Sanctions against Russia\n\nThe U.S. imposed sanctions on Russia’s two largest oil companies, Rosneft and Lukoil, on October 22. The new measures target Russia-based subsidiaries majority-owned by Rosneft and Lukoil, potentially barring them from conducting transactions in U.S. dollars. The Trump administration’s first direct targeting of Russia’s energy sector, a critical source of revenue for the Kremlin’s coffers, immediately reverberated through global energy markets: Brent crude rose 5% to $65.70 a barrel.\n\nTreasury Secretary Scott Bessent described the sanctioned oil firms as twin engines of “the Kremlin’s war machine” and called for an immediate ceasefire. He stated that the new sanctions were necessary in response to “President Putin’s refusal to end this senseless war” and added that the U.S. is prepared to take further action against Moscow if needed.\n\nThe sanctions will likely translate into revenue losses for Moscow: Rosneft and Lukoil have supplied roughly 60 percent of Russia’s crude sold to India, the largest buyer of discounted Russian seaborne crude oil since Moscow’s 2022 invasion of Ukraine. Now, Indian refiners are poised to reduce imports to comply with the new sanctions. Reliance Industries, India’s top purchaser of Russian crude, plans to cut or halt purchases under its long-term Rosneft deal; meanwhile, other state refiners are reviewing trade documents to ensure that no supply comes directly from the sanctioned companies.\n\nThe timing of the sanctions follows a period of heightened tension between Trump and Putin. When the two leaders spoke on the phone before the summit plan was canceled, Trump expressed frustration over the war’s persistence. “Every time I speak with Vladimir, I have good conversations, and then they don’t go anywhere.” Speaking from the Oval Office, he described the sanctions as “tremendous,\" but added, \"We hope that they won’t be on for long.”\n\nPutin, in turn, said that the canceled meeting with Trump is more likely “postponed” because it would have been a mistake to hold it without proper preparation. He also noted that the proposal to hold the summit in Budapest came from Trump and described the new U.S. sanctions as an attempt to put pressure on Russia.\n\nIn line with Washington, the EU announced its 19th package of sanctions. The measures complement Washington’s blow to Russia’s energy sector. They include a phased ban on Russian LNG, blacklisting more ships from Russia’s “shadow fleet” and blocking transactions with Rosneft and Gazprom Neft. EU officials say that the package shows unity with the U.S. and signals that Russia cannot exploit divisions between Europe and Washington for its gain.\n\nZelenskyy Backs Ceasefire, Freezing Lines\n\nAlthough Trump and Putin now have no fixed plan for a meeting, Zelenskyy has announced that he supports Trump's call for an immediate ceasefire with a freeze of military activity along the current front lines. Zelenskyy also expressed hope that a ceasefire might lead to direct negotiations between himself and Putin. Moscow so far has rejected a ceasefire.\n\nUkraine Action Summit in Washington, D.C.\n\nOn October 25, in Washington, D.C., the Seventh Ukraine Action Summit, hosted by the American Coalition for Ukraine (ACU), brought together policy experts, community leaders, and advocates to strengthen U.S. support for Ukraine.\n\nThe two-day conference, which drew over 700 registrants this year, features panels on security guarantees, the abduction of Ukrainian children by Russia, and other critical topics. With Advocacy Days scheduled this week on Capitol Hill to boost congressional support for Ukraine, the summit serves as a vital platform for mobilizing engagement and shaping U.S. policy toward Ukraine’s future.\n\nCulture Front\n\nUkrainian and Latvian Artists Explore Art in Times of Turmoil in New Tribeca Show\n\nUkrainian-born, New York–based artist Zoya Frolova and Latvian-born artist Janis Jakobsons present an exploration of conflict and transformation through the lens of art at Mriya Gallery in Tribeca.\n\nThe featured works—created between 2012 and 2014 and exhibited together for the first time—resonate with today’s world, marked by turmoil and resilience. Frolova, who was born in Kharkiv and graduated from the Kharkiv State Academy of Art and Design, in some of her paintings replaces warships with paper boats, creating a striking symbolism of fragility and defiance.\n\nA rare painting of Zaporizhstal—an industrial site and one of the largest steel plants in Eastern Europe, currently occupied by Russian forces—by renowned Kharkiv artist Vasyl Myronenko (1910–1964) is featured alongside paintings, installations, photography, and graphic works by Frolova and Jakobsons.\n\nThe exhibition, organized by Rukhart, includes artworks from Arthur K. Mann Sr.’s collection, which includes more than 20 of Myronenko’s color etchings, among others. The show is on view at Mriya Gallery, 101 Read Street, Tribeca, New York City, through November 5.\n\nZhadan’s Poetry Comes Alive in Bilingual Performance at Bowery Poetry Club\n\nOn October 21, the Bowery Poetry Club in New York City hosted a bilingual poetry evening presented by Yara Arts Group. The event spotlighted the work of renowned Ukrainian poet Serhiy Zhadan from Kharkiv, whose verses were performed in both Ukrainian and English.\n\nNew York poets Wanda Phipps, Alvin Eng, Pichchenda Bao, and Bob Holman shared original responses to Zhadan’s poetry, while Ukrainian poet Oksana Lutsyshyna offered her own poetic reflections. Ukrainian actress Svitlana Kosolapova gave voice to Zhadan’s Ukrainian texts.\n\nYara Arts and its founder, Virlyana Tkach, continue to bridge cultures and respond to the urgency of our times, bringing contemporary Ukrainian culture to a diverse audience in New York.\n\nGot a tip?

I'm going to make damn sure that these lawfare Democrats go to prison during the four years of President Trump's second term,\" Davis told conservative commentator Benny Johnson on Friday. \n\nWhile Davis does not hold a government position, court documents confirm that a federal judge last month ordered a grand jury to be empaneled in Fort Pierce, Florida, beginning in January at the request of the Trump administration.\n\nA representative of the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of Florida did not immediately respond to a request for comment about the purpose of the grand jury. \n\nA conservative lawyer who helped shepherd Trump's nominees through the Supreme Court confirmation process, Davis now runs the Article III Project, an organization that describes itself as devoted to helping \"fight leftist lawfare to defend the rule of law.\" \n\nTrump has recently called for the prosecution of some of the same officials accused by Davis of using lawfare to target him.\n\n\"They cheated and rigged the 2020 Presidential Election,\" Trump wrote on social media Saturday. \"These Radical Left Lunatics should be prosecuted for their illegal and highly unethical behavior!\"\n\nTrump has not yet commented on Davis' remarks on the conservative podcasts.\n\nIn an interview on \"The Charlie Kirk Show,\" Davis said his \"buddy\" Jason Quiñones -- the United States Attorney for the Southern District of Florida -- moved to empanel the grand jury after Davis \"pushed very hard\" to investigate what he says is a conspiracy against Trump. \n\nDavis has suggested that top officials, including former Attorney General Merrick Garland, Deputy Attorney General Lisa Monaco, FBI Director Chris Wray and Special Counsel Jack Smith should be compelled to testify before the grand jury to answer questions about what Davis says is the politicized use of the legal system. \n\nQuiñones and representatives from the Southern District of Florida did not immediately respond to ABC News' requests for comment.\n\nDavis has argued that the former Biden administration officials and others violated a section of federal law, known as 18 U.S.C. § 24, by conspiring to interfere with federally protected rights. \n\nCreated in response to a surge in violence during the Reconstruction period after the Civil War, the law has historically been used to protect the civil rights of Black Americans, though prosecutors have expanded it to apply to broader election-related and police-misconduct offenses. \n\nNotably, Trump was accused of violating the statute after he allegedly sought to overturn the results of the 2020 election, though the case was dismissed after he won the 2024 election. \n\nDavis claims that a wide array of actions -- including the FBI's investigations of Russian interference in the 2016 election and the Jan. 6 insurrection -- were coordinated efforts by Democrats to impede and ultimately imprison Trump. \n\nDavis also argues the criminal and civil cases against Trump, purported issues with Trump's Secret Service protection ahead of two assassination attempts last year and the efforts to remove Trump from the ballot in 2024 could also be violations of federal law. \n\n\"They took the country to the break. They tried to bankrupt Trump for non-fraud. They tried to throw him in prison four times for non-crimes. They tried to take him off the ballot in Colorado and made it elsewhere unconstitutionally. They tried to take off his head when Joe Biden underfunded Trump's Secret Service protection, said he was the biggest threat to democracy and to put a bull's eye on Trump,\" Davis said on Friday on the Johnson podcast.\n\nWith some Republican senators now raising concerns over the scope of the federal investigation of the attempt to overturn the results of the 2020 election -- including the subpoenaing of phone records of multiple senators -- Davis has argued he has enough support to carry out a sweeping investigation. \n\n\"There's now a special grand jury that Jason [Quiñones] just motioned the court and the Southern District of Florida to open in Fort Pierce. That's going to be empaneled in January. I think that sounds like a great place to open up this grand jury on Crossfire Hurricane and against these lawfare Democrats,\" Davis said Friday. \n\nThe setting for the grand jury in Fort Pierce's federal courthouse is a familiar one for Trump and his allies -- it's the same courthouse where he attended multiple hearings in his criminal case for allegedly retaining classified documents and obstructing justice. Davis claims the classified documents case, which was dismissed by a federal judge before the 2024 election, is part of the conspiracy against Trump as well. \n\n\"As I promised and as I will deliver, justice is definitely coming,\" Davis said Friday on Johnson's podcast.","summary":"A key Trump ally says a federal grand jury has been empaneled in Florida that will begin meeting in January.","url":"https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/trump-ally-grand-jury-empaneled-florida-investigate-sweeping/story?id=126854433","image":"https://i.abcnewsfe.com/a/d54052ef-feab-496f-802a-9516f8aa25c8/mike_davis_1761364369836_hpMain_16x9.jpg?w=1600","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-10-25 22:35:48","author":"Alexander Mallin,Katherine Faulders,Peter Charalambous","authors":["Alexander Mallin","Katherine Faulders","Peter Charalambous"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.172},{"id":372591762,"title":"Arellano: He's just happy to root for the Dodgers again after almost dying during the last World Series","text":"There was probably no Dodgers fan more grateful to see the Blue Crew lose badly in the opening game of the World Series than Conrado Contreras. See, the 75-year-old was happy to enjoy any Fall Classic at all. A year ago tomorrow, the Zacatecas native suffered a heart attack and mild stroke in the moments after seeing his Dodgers win Game 2 of the World Series against the New York Yankees. He spent three days in a medically induced coma at St. Francis Medical Center in Lynwood and regained consciousness to news from jubilant nurses that the Dodgers had won the championship. The lifelong baseball fan had no idea what they were talking about. His passion for the sport was lost along with his memory. When family members put on highlights from the 2024 championship during his rehabilitation at a clinic in Gardena throughout the end of the year, the former carpenter would shrug and change the channel. When someone told him that legendary Dodgers pitcher Fernando Valenzuela had died, Contreras swore that he had just seen his fellow Mexican pitch at the stadium. It wasn't until the 2025 baseball season came along that Contreras' mind began to truly rebound. He watched games from his longtime home in the unincorporated Florence-Graham neighborhood and learned to love the Dodgers anew. But he didn’t cheer like before. Contreras followed doctor's orders to stay calm when the Dodgers were losing instead of cursing like the past and quietly applaud when the team was winning when he would’ve previously roared. He’s the father-in-law of my sister Alejandrina. And I wanted to hang out with Don Conrado for Game 1 of this year's World Series to experience fandom in all its mortality. Wearing a flat-brimmed fedora and a blue Dodgers 2024 World Series champions T-shirt, I caught Contreras just as he was entering my sister's Norwalk home holding on to his walker with the help of Alejandrina's husband, Conrad. His father talks slower than he used to and can’t drive anymore, but Contreras is once again the same man his family knows: witty, observant and baseball-crazy. A schoolyard pitcher in his hometown of Monte Escobedo, Contreras fell in with the Dodgers almost as soon as he migrated to the United States in 1970 to join a brother in Highland Park. He used to attend games every week “when $10 got two people into the stadium and you could also eat a hot dog,” Contreras told me in Spanish before Game 1 began. His stories from those years were immaculate. Don Sutton throwing a shutout. The Cincinnati Reds always \"ready to play to the death.\" Pittsburgh Pirates slugger Willie Stargell hitting a home run out of Dodger Stadium in 1973 “and all of us just staring above our heads in awe.” Contreras was such a fan that he took his pregnant wife, Mary, to watch Valenzuela pitch on the day in 1983 that Conrad was due because they were giving out “I (Heart) Fernando” T-shirts, an anecdote that left their son flabbergasted. “What happened to the shirt?” Conrad asked his mom in Spanish. “I threw it away,” replied the 61-year-old Mary. “They’d cost a lot of money now!” he groaned. “They were cheap! The color really faded fast.” The family continued to attend games through Conrad’s teenage years but stopped “when even the birds couldn’t afford to attend,” Mary said. Conrad, 42, thinks the last time he went to a game with his dad was \"at least\" 20 years ago. But they regularly watched games on television. It was he who administered the CPR a year ago that saved his dad's life. “He was walking around the house angry all that game,” Conrad said. “No, well, Roberto was making me mad,” Conrado replied, his nickname for Dodgers manager Dave Roberts. “But I can’t get mad anymore.” I asked how he thought this year's series would go. He mentioned Shohei Ohtani, whom he kept calling el japonés in a respectful tone because, well, his memory can be fuzzy. “He strikes out too much, but when he hits it, he hits it. If he plays like that, they win the series. But if Toronto hits, forget it.” One more question before game time, the one too many liberal Latino Dodgers fans are belly-aching over right now: is it ethical to root for the team considering they haven’t been too vocal in opposing Donald Trump’s deportation campaign and owner Mark Walter has investments in companies that are profiting from it? “Sports shouldn’t get into politics, but all sports owners are with Trompas,” he said, using a nickname I’ve heard more than a few rancho libertarians use for Trump. He shrugged. “So what’s one to do? They kept la migra out of the stadium,” referring to an unsuccessful June attempt by federal agents to enter the stadium parking lot. “If the team had allowed that, then there’d be a huge problem.” Mary wasn't as sympathetic. \"Latinos shouldn't let the Dodgers off so easy. But when Latinos surrender, they surrender.\" It was game time. Conrad slipped into a gray Dodgers away jersey to match his black team cap. My sister, an Angels follower for some reason, wore a Kiké Hernández T-shirt “because he stands with immigrants.” “The only good thing about the Dodgers is that they aren’t winning with a gringo,” said Mary, who actually doesn’t care much about baseball because she finds it boring. “It’s someone [Ohtani] who doesn’t want to speak English who’s winning it for them.” Her husband smiled. “Let’s see if Mary gets into baseball.” “That’ll be the real miracle,” she snapped back. Contreras rubbed his hands in glee as the Dodgers went up 2-0 in the top of the third and merely frowned when the Blue Jays tied it in the bottom of the fourth while we were enjoying takeout from Taco Nazo. \"His anger comes in waves, it's a trip,\" Conrad said. \"He's calmer but se enoja.\" “Who?” Conrado deadpanned. When Dodger starting pitcher Blake Snell left the game with the bases loaded and no one out in the bottom of the sixth, Contreras shook his head in disgust but kept his voice calm. “This is what gets me mad. They should’ve taken him out long ago, but Roberto didn’t. This is what I was afraid of. When Toronto get on, they get on. They won’t stop until they destroy.” Sure enough, the Blue Jays erupted for nine runs that inning, including a two-run blast by catcher Alejandro Kirk, who had sparked the Jays' initial rally a few innings earlier. Earlier in the game, Alejandrina had told Conrado that Kirk was a Tijuana native. The pride in shared roots, albeit generations apart, took a little bit of sting off his home run, which made the score a humiliating 11-2. “Thank goodness he’s Mexican,” Conrado told his son, patting his knee. \"That’s what’s left for us” to be happy about the game. An inning later, Contreras began to feel woozy. His sugar level was elevated. Mary took off his jacket to fix his insulin device. My sister’s corgi, Penny, jumped onto the couch and lay on his lap. “They do know when someone someone’s ill, right?” he said to no one before scratching Penny's tummy and cooing, “You know I’m ill, right? I’m ill!” When the \"massacre\" finally ended, Contreras remained philosophical. “It’s incredible that I'm able to see this. But I’m still malo. My feet hurt, my memory isn’t what it used to be, my sense of balance isn’t there. But there’s the Dodgers. But they need to win.” Conrad went to the bedroom to grab his father's walker. “Do you want a Toronto shirt now?” he joked. His dad stared silently. “No, that would give me another heart attack.”","summary":"There was probably no Dodgers fan more grateful to see the Blue Crew lose badly in the opening game of the World Series than Conrado Contreras.","url":"https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2025-10-25/conrado-contreras-dodgers-fan","image":"https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/2818699/2147483647/strip/false/crop/6000x4000+0+0/resize/1486x991!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Ff9%2F57%2F872eeda043d6949dc534f3ac6673%2F2h6a2382-5820742.JPG","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-10-25 22:34:56","author":"Gustavo Arellano","authors":["Gustavo Arellano"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.235},{"id":372581088,"title":"Trump hikes tariffs on Canada over 'fraudulent' Ronald Reagan ad","text":"President Donald Trump said he is raising tariffs on Canada by 10 percent after Ontario ran a TV ad that featured Ronald Reagan slamming tariffs in a 1987 speech.\n\nTrump had already terminated all trade negotiations with Canada on Thursday over the ad, which was seen by millions of Americans on channels such as Fox News, Fox Sports, NBC, CBS, CNBC, ESPN, ABC and local affiliates.\n\n'Canada was caught, red handed, putting up a fraudulent advertisement on Ronald Reagan's Speech on Tariffs,' Trump wrote Saturday afternoon on Truth Social. \n\n'Because of their serious misrepresentation of the facts, and hostile act, I am increasing the Tariff on Canada by 10% over and above what they are paying now.'\n\nThere is currently a 35 percent tariff on Canadian goods sold in the US that are not exempted under the US-Mexico-Canada Agreement. Steel and aluminum are tariffed at 50 percent. \n\nTrump also reiterated his theory that the Ontario government, led by Premier Doug Ford, ran the ad to illegally sway the opinions of the Supreme Court, which will decide next month if the Trump administration has the legal authority to implement sweeping global tariffs without the input of Congress.\n\nThe 60-second ad pulled from a radio address made by Reagan as he explained why he was placing tariffs on Japanese electronics. The substance of his remarks appear to be unaltered.\n\n'Let's take Ronald Reagan's words and let's blast it to the American people,' Ford said upon launching the campaign. 'We're going to repeat that message to every Republican district there is right across the entire country.'\n\nIn the ad, Reagan explains how tariffs can appear to beneficial to Americans at first, but argued the short term gains do not last.\n\n'When someone says, \"Let's impose tariffs on foreign imports,\" it looks like they're doing the patriotic thing by protecting American products and jobs,' Reagan said.\n\n'And sometimes for a short while it works, but only for a short time. But over the long run, such trade barriers hurt every American, worker and consumer.'\n\nReagan then claimed: 'High tariffs inevitably lead to retaliation by foreign countries and the triggering of fierce trade wars. Then the worst happens. Markets shrink and collapse, businesses and industries shut down and millions of people lose their jobs.'\n\nOn Thursday, the Ronald Reagan Presidential Foundation & Institute said the 40th president was taken out of context but offered no further explanation.\n\n'The ad misrepresents the Presidential Radio Address, and the Government of Ontario did not seek nor receive permission to use and edit the remarks,' the institute wrote on X.\n\nThe institute added that it was 'reviewing its legal options in this matter' before linking people to Reagan's full address.\n\nAfter conservative outrage spread online, Ontario, Canada's largest province, said it would pull the ad starting Monday.\n\nThat means it will still air Saturday night during Game 2 of the World Series between the Toronto Blue Jays and the Los Angeles Dodgers.\n\n'They could have pulled it tonight,' Trump told reporters at the White House as prepared to leave for his trip to Asia.\n\n'Well, that's dirty play,' he added. 'But I can play dirtier than they can, you know.'\n\nFord said on social media that he pulled the ad after speaking with Prime Minister Mark Carney, who has been trying to negotiate with Trump on trade for months. The two men are members of opposing parties.\n\n'Our intention was always to initiate a conversation about the kind of economy that Americans want to build and the impact of tariffs on workers and businesses,' Ford said. 'We've achieved our goal, having reached U.S. audiences at the highest levels.'\n\nFor now, the vast majority of trade between the US and Canada remains protected by the USMCA.\n\nBut the agreement has to be renegotiated in July 2026, and Trump has already called for a revision that would favor US industries.","summary":"President Donald Trump announced he is raising tariffs on Canada by 10 percent.
