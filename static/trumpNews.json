Colorado Republicans raised more than US$10,000 through a GoFundMe account to commission the oil painting, which was unveiled in 2019.\nSenate Minority Leader Paul Lundeen, a Republican, said that he requested for Trump’s portrait to be taken down and replaced by one “that depicts his contemporary likeness”.\n“If the GOP wants to spend time and money on which portrait of Trump hangs in the Capitol, then that’s up to them,” the Democrats said.\nThe portrait was installed alongside other paintings of US presidents. Before the installation, a prankster placed a picture of Russian President Vladimir Putin near the spot intended for Trump.\nInitially, people objected to artist Sarah Boardman’s depiction of Trump as “nonconfrontational” and “thoughtful” in the portrait, according to an interview with Colorado Times Recorder from the time.\n\nBut in a Sunday night post on his Truth Social platform, Trump said he would prefer no picture at all over the one that hangs in the Colorado Capitol. The Republican lauded a nearby portrait of former president Barack Obama – also by Boardman – saying “he looks wonderful”.\n“Nobody likes a bad picture or painting of themselves, but the one in Colorado, in the state Capitol, put up by the Governor, along with all other Presidents, was purposefully distorted to a level that even I, perhaps, have never seen before,” Trump wrote.\n“I would much prefer not having a picture than having this one,” Trump wrote, asking that Governor Jared Polis “take it down”.\nThe portraits are not the purview of the Colorado governor’s office but the Colorado Building Advisory Committee. The ones up to and including President Jimmy Carter were donated as a collection. The others were donated by political parties or, more recently, paid for by outside fundraising.\nThe Legislature’s executive committee, made up of both Democratic and Republican leadership, signed a letter directing the removal of Trump’s portrait. Lundeen, the Republican senator who requested it, noted that Grover Cleveland, whose presidential terms were separated like Trump’s, had a portrait from his second term.\nBoardman did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Associated Press. In interviews from the time with The Denver Post, Boardman said it was important that her depictions of both Obama and Trump looked apolitical.\n\n“There will always be dissent, so pleasing one group will always inflame another. I consider a neutrally thoughtful, and nonconfrontational, portrait allows everyone to reach their own conclusions in their own time,” Boardman told the Colorado Times Recorder in 2019.\nTrump’s Sunday night comments had prompted a steady stream of visitors to pose for photos with the painting before the announcement that it would be taken down.\nAaron Howe, visiting from Wyoming on Monday, stood in front of Trump’s portrait, looking down at photos of the president on his phone, then back up at the portrait.\n“Honestly he looks a little chubby,” said Howe of the portrait, but “better than I could do”.\n“I don’t know anything about the artist,” said Howe, who voted for Trump. “It could be taken one way or the other.”\nKaylee Williamson, an 18-year-old Trump supporter from Arkansas, got a photo with the portrait.\n“I think it looks like him. I guess he’s smoother than all the other ones,” she said. “I think it’s fine.”","summary":"Trump took to social media to call on governor to take down painting at Colorado state

re-election\n\nPODCAST: All the latest headlines, including Trump’s bold move to void Biden’s pardons and Gavin Newsom’s unexpected statue plans\n\nBy STEPHEN JOHNSON, ECONOMICS REPORTER FOR DAILY MAIL AUSTRALIA\n\nPublished: 00:59 GMT, 25 March 2025 | Updated: 00:59 GMT, 25 March 2025\n\nAnthony Albanese is now considered an even-money chance of being re-elected with even bookmakers unable to split Labor and Opposition's hopes of winning\n\nSportsbet on Monday had Labor at $1.90 odds, identical to the Coalition, after Australia's trade war with Donald Trump and the US gave Albo an unexpected boost.\n\nLabor began attracting more money in its favour after a Roy Morgan poll had Labor leading the Coalition 54.5 per cent to 45.5 per cent.\n\nThe result contradicted polls from earlier this year by Newspoll and Resolve which showed the Coalition in front.\n\nThis was after Trump's 25 per cent tariffs on steel and aluminium ironically won over voter support for Labor.\n\nRoy Morgan chief executive Michele Levine said this had cost Opposition Leader Peter Dutton, despite Labor being unable to secure any US tariff exemptions.\n\n'The Albanese government has consistently attempted to associate Dutton with President Trump and Trump's more controversial policies and rhetoric,' Ms Levine said.\n\nAnthony Albanese is now considered an even-money chance of being re-elected with betting markets putting Labor on equal pegging with the Opposition thanks to Donald Trump\n\n'This campaign may be starting to have an impact, as Trump's actions, including imposing tariffs, begin to directly impact Australians.'\n\nA similar phenomenon is playing out in Canada where the governing centre-left Liberal Party leads the Opposition, after new Prime Minister Mark Carney replaced Justin Trudeau.\n\nUntil recently, polls had predicted the Conservative Party of Canada would win a landslide victory at this year's election after a decade in Opposition, but Trump's tariffs on Canadian imports have changed voting intentions.\n\nIn Australia, Sportsbet has Labor as the most likely to form a minority government, with its odds at $2.37 compared with $3 for the Coalition.\n\nA Labor majority is long odds at $6, compared with $4.50 for the Coalition, given the government goes into the election with a two-seat majority. \n\nThe Liberal and National parties need to pick up 13 seats, with a four per cent swing, to be in the best position to form a minority government with conservative crossbench MPs, like Bob Katter. \n\nMr Dutton's Coalition would need to beat Labor 52 per cent to 48 per cent, after preferences, to pick up the necessary number of seats from the government, given his side lost safe seats to teal candidates in 2022. \n\nNewspoll has put the Coalition in front, 51 to 49 per cent on a two-party preferred basis, in polls taken since January. \n\nAn election must be held by May 17, with Parliament set to be dissolved soon after Tuesday night's Budget. \n\nNo federal government has been thrown out of office after just one term since 1931.\n\nLabor's support rose after the Trump Administration imposed 25 per cent tariffs on steel and aluminium (pictured is President Donald Trump in Philadelphia)\n\nSportsbet on Monday afternoon had Labor at $1.90 odds, identical to the Coalition\n\nAnthony AlbaneseDonald Trump\n\nShare

Any such case would likely include an assessment about whether Tayeh’s language itself “went so far beyond robust political debate as to warrant punishment”.\n\nThe argument hits a sore nerve in Victoria, where new hate speech laws are marooned in the upper house. Jewish groups approve of the government’s proposed legislation to protect a number of groups, but the Greens, Muslim groups and others want a defence of “public interest” speech to protect political protests, while the Opposition wants the laws to go further.\n\nTayeh said he was willing to take his fight “as high as necessary to ensure no one, regardless of their political stance” is targeted with “frivolous and baseless charges”. His legal team has confirmed they are examining the constitutional issues.\n\n“I am against the Israeli government,” Tayeh says, “because they’re committing war crimes and acts of terrorism … it’s not even hidden.

Vance. \n\nThose officials may have violated the Presidential Records Act, which requires presidential records to be preserved. \n\nSignal automatically deletes messages after a period of time. \n\nClinton's 2016 presidential campaign was derailed in part due to her decision to use a private email server while serving as President Barack Obama's Secretary of State.\n\nHer rival, the current President Donald Trump, consistently attacked Clinton over using the unsecured server, with his crowds chanting, 'lock her up!' \n\nNow nine years later and just a month and four days into Trump's second term, there are calls for firings of some of these officials from Democrats in disbelief that classified information was being discussed on the app. \n\n'Really dumb and epically irresponsible. People need to lose their jobs over this. Preferably Hegseth,' commented Democratic New Jersey Sen. Andy Kim. \n\nGoldberg didn't quote one of Hegseth's longer messages to the group, fearing the information contained could hurt U.S. troops. \n\n'What I will say, in order to illustrate the shocking recklessness of this Signal conversation, is that the Hegseth post contained operational details of forthcoming strikes on Yemen, including information about targets, weapons the U.S. would be deploying, and attack sequencing,' the journalist instead wrote.\n\nSen. Ruben Gallego, an Arizona Democrat, also took aim at Hegseth. \n\nDuring an appearance on CNN Monday night, Gallego pointed out that in any other administration the president would have made the Pentagon chief resign. \n\n'The Secretary of Defense was unqualified to begin with and now he's actually proven himself,' Gallego said. \n\nSen. Tammy Duckworth reposted Fox News' Brit Hume's reaction to Hegseth arriving in Hawaii and calling Goldberg 'deceitful and highly discredited.' \n\n'Oh for God's sake, the administration has already confirmed the authenticity of the message,' Hume wrote. \n\nPolitico reported Monday night that Waltz, who created the group chat and invited Goldberg to join, was currently the most endangered Trump official involved in the brewing scandal. \n\n'Everyone in the White House can agree on one thing: Mike Waltz is a f***ing idiot,' one 'person close to the White House' was quoted as saying. \n\nWaltz, who previously worked for former Vice President Dick Cheney, a Republican, has been viewed skeptically by MAGA diehards for his former neo-conservative ties. \n\nPolitico reported that Waltz had spoken to Trump - who denied knowing about the story when asked about it Monday afternoon at an event featuring Lousiana's governor. \n\nIf Waltz is let go, he will have made it more than a month longer than the first national security adviser Trump selected for his first term - Michael Flynn. \n\nFlynn resigned on February 13, 2017 after it came out that he misled then Vice President Mike Pence on conversations he had with the Russians.","summary":"Hillary Clinton trolled the Trump administration after The Atlantic's editor-in-chief revealed he was added to a group chat of Trump administration figures discussing Huthi war plans.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-14532811/hillary-clinton-troll-trump-atlantic-huthi-war-plan.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/03/25/00/96530159-0-image-m-25_1742861872159.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-03-25 00:53:30","author":"Editor,Nikki Schwab","authors":["Editor","Nikki Schwab"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.275},{"id":303752330,"title":"US Trade Official to Visit India for Key Discussions On Tariffs","text":"Christopher Lynch, the US Assistant Trade Representative for South and Central Asia, is set to visit India from March 25-29, leading a delegation for crucial trade discussions with Indian officials. The visit underscores the commitment of both nations to strengthening economic ties and working towards a balanced trade relationship.\n“This visit reflects the United States’ continued commitment to advancing a productive and balanced trade relationship with India,” said a spokesperson from the US embassy. “We value our ongoing engagement with the government of India on trade and investment matters and look forward to continuing these discussions in a constructive, equitable, and forward-looking manner.”\nA representative from India’s commerce ministry also confirmed the visit, reiterating India’s dedication to fostering economic growth through bilateral collaboration. “As directed by the leaders of the two countries, India remains committed to working with the US side in the trade and economic domains to enhance prosperity and innovation in both India and the US and deepen supply chain integration between the two countries,” he stated. “We look forward to productive and constructive discussions with the incoming US delegation to expand and deepen our bilateral trade and economic ties in a mutually beneficial manner.”\nIndia and US Look to Bypass WTO Barriers\nA major topic on the agenda is finalizing a framework for a bilateral trade agreement. Sources familiar with the discussions highlighted that reducing Most-Favoured Nation (MFN) tariffs could inadvertently benefit China under global trade regulations. To avoid this, both India and the US are focusing on negotiating an exclusive trade agreement rather than extending trade benefits broadly under WTO rules.\n“The goal is to create a structure where both partners reduce tariff and non-tariff barriers for each other while ensuring that these benefits remain exclusive,” a source explained. “This requires a legal framework to prevent MFN provisions from automatically extending to all WTO members.”\nA full-fledged Free Trade Agreement (FTA) is not immediately on the table. Instead, the two sides may opt for an “early harvest” deal—an initial trade agreement that could eventually lead to a comprehensive FTA. “If India simply lowers MFN tariffs, it will open the floodgates for Chinese goods. Therefore, a step-by-step bilateral trade framework is essential to ensure economic gains for both India and the US while protecting their industries from external competition,” the source added.\nThe Path to a $500 Billion Trade Target\nThe upcoming discussions build upon commitments made during Prime Minister Narendra Modi and former US President Donald Trump’s meeting in Washington last month. At that meeting, both leaders agreed to finalize the first phase of a trade deal by the fall of 2025, setting the stage for more extensive trade cooperation.\n“The two countries are looking at more than doubling bilateral trade to $500 billion by 2030,” said a person familiar with the negotiations. “Both leaders have agreed on reducing barriers to trade and investment, but the framework must be legally sound to ensure that only the two countries benefit from this arrangement.”\nManaging Trade Deficits with China\nBoth India and the US face significant trade deficits with China, a concern that is shaping the structure of the proposed trade agreement. The latest UNCTAD Global Trade Update for March 2025 highlighted global trade imbalances, noting that the US continues to hold the world’s largest trade deficit, while China maintains the highest surplus.\nAccording to the US Trade Representative’s (USTR) office, the US goods trade deficit with China reached $295.4 billion in 2024, reflecting a 5.8% increase from the previous year. In comparison, the US trade deficit with India stood at $45.7 billion in 2024, a 5.4% rise from 2023.\nIndia’s trade deficit with China has also been widening, touching $83.52 billion in the first 10 months of the 2024-25 fiscal year, nearly matching the full-year deficit of $85.06 billion recorded in 2023-24.\nBilateral Trade Agreement vs. Free Trade Agreement\nUnder WTO rules, MFN treatment ensures that any tariff reductions must be extended to all 166 member nations unless they fall within an established free trade agreement. While India and the US are not yet labeling their proposed trade pact as an FTA, they may formally notify the WTO once a deal is reached, categorizing it as a precursor to a future FTA.\nAt their February 13 meeting, Modi and Trump laid the groundwork for a bilateral trade agreement, focusing on expanding market access, reducing tariffs, and strengthening supply chain integration.\nFollowing this, India’s Commerce Minister Piyush Goyal met with US Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick and US Trade Representative Jamieson Greer in early March to create a roadmap for the agreement.\nLynch is well-versed in India-US trade talks, having played a key role in previous negotiations under Trump’s first presidential term.

Democratic lawmakers swiftly blasted the misstep, saying it was a breach of U.S. national security and a violation of law that must be investigated by Congress. The Atlantic's editor-in-chief Jeffrey Goldberg said in a report on Monday that he was unexpectedly invited on March 13 to an encrypted chat group on the Signal messaging app called the Houthi PC small group. In the group, national security adviser Mike Waltz tasked his deputy Alex Wong with setting up a tiger team to coordinate U.S. action against the Houthis. National Security Council spokesperson Brian Hughes said the chat group appeared to be authentic. U.S. President Donald Trump launched an ongoing campaign of large-scale military strikes against Yemen's Houthis on March 15 over the group's attacks against Red Sea shipping, and he warned Iran, the Houthis' main backer, that it needed to immediately halt support for the group. Hours before those attacks started, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth posted operational details about the plan in the messaging group, including information about targets, weapons the U.S. would be deploying, and attack sequencing, Goldberg said. His report omitted the details but Goldberg termed it a shockingly reckless use of a Signal chat. Accounts that appeared to represent Vice President JD Vance, U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio, CIA Director John Ratcliffe, Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, White House chief of staff Susie Wiles, and senior National Security Council officials were assembled in the chat group, Goldberg wrote. Joe Kent, Trump's nominee for National Counterterrorism Center director, was apparently on the Signal chain despite not yet being Senate-confirmed. Trump told reporters at the White House that he was unaware of the incident. I don't know anything about it. I'm not a big fan of The Atlantic, Trump said. A White House official said later that an investigation was under way and Trump had been briefed on it. The NSC's Hughes said in a statement: At this time, the message thread that was reported appears to be authentic, and we are reviewing how an inadvertent number was added to the chain. The thread is a demonstration of the deep and thoughtful policy coordination between senior officials. The ongoing success of the Houthi operation demonstrates that there were no threats to our servicemembers or our national security. Hegseth denied sharing war plans in the group chat. Nobody was texting war plans, and that's all I have to say about that, he told reporters while on an official trip to Hawaii on Monday. 'EUROPEAN FREE-LOADING' According to screenshots of the chat reported by The Atlantic, officials in the group debated whether the U.S. should carry out the strikes, and at one point Vance appeared to question whether U.S. allies in Europe, more exposed to shipping disruption in the region, deserved U.S. help. @PeteHegseth if you think we should do it let's go, a person identified as Vance wrote. I just hate bailing Europe out again, the person wrote, adding: Let's just make sure our messaging is tight here. A person identified as Hegseth replied: VP: I fully share your loathing of European free-loading. It's PATHETIC. The Atlantic reported that the person identified as Vance also raised concerns about the timing of the strikes, and said there was a strong argument in favor of delaying them by a month. I am not sure the president is aware how inconsistent this is with his message on Europe right now. There's a further risk that we see a moderate to severe spike in oil prices, the account wrote, before saying he was willing to support the group's consensus. Yemen, Houthi-ally Iran and the European Union's diplomatic service did not immediately respond to requests for comment from Reuters. Under U.S. law, it can be a crime to mishandle, misuse or abuse classified information, though it is unclear whether those provisions might have been breached in this case. Messages that The Atlantic report said were set by Waltz to disappear from the Signal app after a period of time also raise questions about possible violations of federal record-keeping laws. As part of a Trump administration effort to chase down leaks by officials to journalists unrelated to the Signal group, Gabbard posted on X on March 14 that any unauthorized release of classified information is a violation of the law and will be treated as such. On Tuesday, Gabbard is due to testify before the Senate Intelligence Committee on worldwide threats to the United States. Created by the entrepreneur Moxie Marlinspike, Signal has gone from an exotic messaging app used by privacy-conscious dissidents to the unofficial whisper network of Washington officialdom. Democratic lawmakers called the use of the Signal group illegal and demanded an investigation. This is one of the most stunning breaches of military intelligence that I have read about in a very, very long time, Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer said, adding that he would ask Majority Leader John Thune to investigate. We're just finding out about it. But obviously, we've got to run it to ground and figure out what went on there. We'll have a plan, said Thune, a Republican from South Dakota. There was no immediate suggestion from the White House that the breach would lead to any staffing changes. President Trump continues to have the utmost confidence in his national security team, including national security adviser Mike Waltz, White House spokeswoman Karoline Leavitt told Reuters. Democratic Senator Elizabeth Warren said on X the use of Signal to discuss highly sensitive national security issues was blatantly illegal and dangerous beyond belief. Every single one of the government officials on this text chain have now committed a crime - even if accidentally - that would normally involve a jail sentence, Democratic Senator Chris Coons said on X.","summary":"White House officials accidentally revealed war plans involving Yemen's Houthi rebels in a message group including a journalist, according to a White House statement on Monday.

dispute","text":"A flight carrying 199 Venezuelans deported from the US to their homeland has landed at Simón Bolívar airport near Caracas.\n\nUS repatriation flights to Venezuela had ground to a halt weeks ago after the Trump administration revoked a licence allowing Venezuela to export some of its oil to the US despite sanctions.\n\nBut on Saturday the two governments, which have no diplomatic relations, reached an agreement on resuming the flights, as part of the Trump administration’s plan to remove undocumented migrants.\n\nVenezuelan President Nicolás Maduro described the flights as a chance to “rescue and free migrants from prisons in the US”.\n\nAs they disembarked from the plane early on Monday, some of the deportees raised their arms and waved.\n\nThey had earlier been transferred from the US state of Texas to Honduras, in Central America, from where they were flown by Venezuelan flag carrier Conviasa to Maiquetía, north of Caracas.\n\nThe US Bureau of Western Hemisphere Affairs described them as “illegal aliens” who “had no basis to remain in the United States”.\n\nThe head of Venezuela’s National Assembly, Jorge Rodríguez, on the other hand stressed on Saturday that migration was “not a crime”.\n\nVenezuela had originally agreed to take in Venezuelan deportees from the US in a deal struck by President Donald Trump’s special envoy, Richard Grenell, in Caracas in January.\n\nIt was widely seen as a victory for Trump, who has made deporting undocumented migrants a priority.\n\nHowever, Maduro said on 8 March that the US administration’s decision to revoke the licence of oil giant Chevron to operate in Venezuela had created “a little problem”.\n\n“They damaged the line of communication we had opened, and I was interested in those lines of communication… because I wanted to bring home all the Venezuelans they have in custody they have unjustly persecuted,” he said.\n\nA week later, the Trump administration deported 238 Venezuelans to a mega-prison in El Salvador, arguing that they were members of the Tren de Aragua criminal gang.\n\nIt caused an outcry in Venezuela, where several relatives of those deported to El Salvador insisted their loved ones had no criminal connections.\n\nOn Monday, Trump said on Truth Social that Venezuela “has been very hostile to the United States”.\n\nHe said its government “purposefully and deceitfully sent to the United States, undercover, tens of thousands of high level, and other, criminals, many of whom are murderers and people of a very violent nature.”\n\nHe also announced a “secondary tariff” on Venezuela, meaning that any country purchasing oil and gas from Venezuela would be hit with a 25% tariff when trading with the United States.\n\nThe deportation of Venezuelans to El Salvador’s feared Cecot prison was followed by a warning posted on X by US Secretary of State Marco Rubio last week that Venezuela would face “severe and escalating” sanctions if it refused to accept its citizens deported from the US.\n\nThe following day, Maduro ordered his government to “step up the action needed to guarantee return flights for detained migrants”.\n\nTariffs are a tax on imports. They are paid by the company that is buying the goods as opposed to the overseas business that is selling the product.\n\nSince taking office in January, Trump has repeatedly used tariffs – or the threat of them – in an attempt to gain leverage in a range of disputes, only some of which are related to trade.\n\nHe said on Monday he still planned to impose tariffs on specific products, including cars, lumber and computer chips, claiming the possibility of such measures were already helping to spur investment in the US.\n\nHis latest threat against Venezuela is expected raise pressure on current buyers of oil – which include China, India and Spain – to reduce their dealings in the country, which have provided a critical financial lifeline to the Venezuelan government.\n\nTrump has already raised tariffs on Chinese imports to at least 20% since February. He told reporters he intended to the latest announcement to be added on top of existing levies.\n\nFor Venezuela, China is a major buyer of its oil. But Venezuela is not a big source of crude for China, which imported more than 11 million barrels per day last year.\n\nThe US is a major buyer of Venezuelan oil, as a result of exemptions from economic sanctions granted to US oil firm Chevron.\n\nThe Trump administration has previously signalled its intention to end those exemptions.\n\nOn Monday, the administration updated its order, giving Chevron until 27 May to wind down its operations in Venezuela, extending the deadline by two months.\n\nChevron declined to comment.\n\nOil prices rose more than 1% after the announcement.\n\nDISCLAIMER: The Views, Comments, Opinions, Contributions and Statements made by Readers and Contributors on this platform do not necessarily represent the views or policy of Multimedia Group Limited.","summary":"A flight carrying 199 Venezuelans deported from the US to their homeland has landed at Simón Bolívar airport near Caracas.

This is what he does,' Hegseth added.\n\nHe praised American troops fighting the Houthis in Yemen and criticized the Biden administration for their own performance. \n\nA reporter asked Hegseth: 'Why were those details shared on signal?'\n\nHegseth replied: 'I've heard how it was characterized. Nobody was texting war plans and that's all I have to say about that.'\n\nWhen reached for comment, a spokesman for the Pentagon told DailyMail.com: 'We do not have anything to offer beyond the Secretary’s remarks.' \n\nDailyMail.com has reached out to the White House and the National Security Agency for comment. \n\nThe National Security Council confirmed the chat that included Goldberg appeared to be authentic. \n\nTrump said he didn't know 'anything' about an extraordinary security breach where a magazine editor was inadvertently included on a group chat with his entire security team strategizing about an upcoming military attack.\n\n'I don’t know anything about it,' Trump said when asked about it at a White House event with Louisiana Gov. Jeff Landry nearly three hours after the story posted, sending shockwaves through the security establishment.\n\nThen Trump, like Hegseth, quickly pivoted to attacking the magazine. \n\n'I’m not a big fan of the Atlantic, to me it’s a magazine that is going out of business. I think it's not much of a magazine,' Trump said of the publication, which was founded in 1857. \n\nSome of the material was so sensitive that the magazine decided not to publish it, but the article from the group chat did feature Vice President JD Vance raising arguments against the decision to strike the targets. \n\n'Pete Hegseth, the secretary of defense, had texted me the war plan at 11:44 a.m.' – about two hours before it happened on March 15th, wrote Goldberg.\n\nThe Signal app is unclassified, although it is often used in the private sector as a form of more secure communications. Usually internal conversations about a looming military operation must be held using secure facilities.\n\nThe bizarre saga began when Goldberg got a request to connect on Signal from Michael Waltz, the name of the White House national security advisor.\n\n'I accepted the connection request, hoping that this was the actual national security adviser, and that he wanted to chat about Ukraine, or Iran, or some other important matter,' Goldberg wrote.\n\n'Two days later—Thursday—at 4:28 p.m., I received a notice that I was to be included in a Signal chat group. It was called the “Houthi PC small group.”' Some of the most revelatory information came from Trump's Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, 44, a former Fox News host. \n\nSo began Goldberg's inclusion in the ultra high level chat. Some of the contents he would only summarize. What he would say, 'to illustrate the shocking recklessness of this Signal conversation, is that the Hegseth post contained operational details of forthcoming strikes on Yemen, including information about targets, weapons the U.S. would be deploying, and attack sequencing.'\n\nWhen it was over, according to Goldberg, Waltz called the operation an 'amazing job' and Director fo National Intelligence John Ratcliff caleld it 'a good start.'\n\nIt was unclear Monday if there would be any fallout from the disclosure. As a candidate Donald Trump tore into Hillary Clinton for her use of a private email server when she was Secretary of State.\n\n'If true, this story represents one of the most egregious failures of operational security and common sense I have ever seen,' said Sen. Jack Reed (D-R.I.), the top Democrat on the Senate Armed Services Committee. \n\n'Military operations need to be handled with utmost discretion, using approved, secure lines of communication, because American lives are on the line. The carelessness shown by President Trump’s cabinet is stunning and dangerous. I will be seeking answers from the Administration immediately.","summary":"Pete Hegseth appeared to deny that he was 'texting war plans' to a group chat about military strikes in Yemen that a journalist was accidentally added on to.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-14532899/pete-hegseth-atlantic-journalist-group-text-war-plans.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/03/25/00/96530663-0-Pete_Hegseth_appeared_to_deny_that_he_was_texting_war_plans_to_a-a-10_1742861434442.jpg","video":"https://videos.dailymail.co.uk/video/mol/2025/03/24/8139566770898778782/1024x576_MP4_8139566770898778782.mp4","publish_date":"2025-03-25 00:31:41","author":"Editor,Stephen M.

However, The Lancet medical journal has said the actual death toll may be up to 41 per cent higher. According to a UN report, the majority of verified victims were women and children.\n\nThe latest conflict started when Hamas gunmen launched a surprise attack on Israel on October 7, 2023, killing at least 1,139 people and taking around 250 hostages to Gaza. In retaliation, Israel vowed it would destroy Hamas and carried out a bombardment campaign on the Gaza Strip for more than a year. \n\nLast Tuesday, a ceasefire – in place since January 19 – was shattered as Israel began a fresh assault on Gaza. Israel has urged the release of dozens of hostages still remaining in the war-torn enclave.\n\nOutside the US consulate on Sunday, the activists held placards saying: “The West is complicit in Israel’s genocide” and “Make fascists afraid.” \n\nTheir statement added: “Western governments, led by the United States, have ignored the voices of their citizens and become complicit in the genocide of Palestinians, furthering Israel’s racist and colonialist aims.”\n\nPolice search\n\nThe group said they were not surprised that police had been called in on Sunday. “The US government is suppressing [the] pro-Palestine movement because the US is aligning with Israel to conduct the genocide against Palestinians,” it said.\n\nThey said that the police “reminded us not to violate the national security law, not to contain any sedition content in our slogans, and not to cover our face under [the] face-covering regulation,” as they searched and took down the identity card details of the activists.\n\nIn response, the US consulate told HKFP on Monday that the five were blocking their driveway and it had to ensure the safety of its staff and facilities. \n\n“The protesters were in front of the consulate vehicle gate, posing a safety and security risk for themselves and consulate staff,” it said. “We fully support the rights of citizens to protest peacefully and safely. Protests near the consulate are a common occurrence.”\n\nA year ago, US Consul General Gregory May said on Facebook that he supported the rights of protesters outside the diplomatic mission. \n\n“[W]e stand up for fundamental freedoms and human rights. While I respectfully disagree with these visitors’ views, I fully support their right to protest peacefully,” he said.\n\nIn an emailed response on Monday, police told HKFP that they “received a report at about 2pm on March 23 that there were five people conducting a public meeting outside 26 Garden Road, Central. Upon Police arrival, the five people were reminded to ensure that the public meeting should be conducted in accordance with the law.”\n\nMahmoud Khalil detention\n\nThe five demonstrators were also calling on the US to release student activist Mahmoud Khalil.\n\nKhalil, a permanent resident of the United States and a lead negotiator for Columbia University’s pro-Palestine campus occupation, was detained by US immigration enforcement on March 8 upon orders by the State Department to revoke his visa.\n\n“The unjust detention of Khalil showed that the US doesn’t care about justice and freedom at all,” HK Anti-war Mobilization said. \n\n“The US government is cracking down on the pro-Palestinian movement on all fronts, fearing that the people will tell the truth about the genocide,” the group also said. \n\n“Ironically, the legislation used to arrest Khalil was the same one used by the US government in the 1950s to block Holocaust survivors in Eastern Europe from entering the US,” the protest group said.\n\nSee also: Hongkongers show solidarity with Palestine amid Israel-Hamas war, but keep efforts low-key\n\nUS President Donald Trump has threatened to punish students that he claims support Hamas or promote antisemitism, though critics say Khalil’s detention is an unconstitutional attack on free speech.\n\nLast year, the International Court of Justice – the principal judicial body of the United Nations – ruled that Israel’s acts in Gaza could amount to genocide. Israel has denied the claims.\n\nThe UN-backed International Criminal Court issued arrest warrants last November for Israeli leader Benjamin Netanyahu and ex-defence chief Yoav Gallant, together with a former Hamas commander, over allegations of war crimes and crimes against humanity.\n\nSupport HKFP | Policies & Ethics | Error/typo? | Contact Us | Newsletter | Transparency & Annual Report | Apps\n\nHelp safeguard press freedom & keep HKFP free for all readers by supporting our team","summary":"Anti-war protesters gathered outside the US consulate in Admiralty on Sunday, calling on Washington to stop suppressing the pro-Palestinian movement amid Israel&#8217;s US-backed war in Gaza.

The people weren't given notice. They weren't told where they were going.'\n\nMillett was referring to the rights and pathways available to people to challenge their removal from the United States.\n\nThe Trump administration maintains the 260 people it deported were members of the feared Tren de Aragua gang.\n\nWashington judge James Boasberg had placed a temporary halt on the deportations and demanded flights already in the air turn around, but the administration did not follow the verbal order.\n\nEnsign said: 'We certainly dispute the Nazi analogy.' \n\nThe administration is hopeful the appeals court will reverse Boasberg's decision to ban the use of the Alien Enemies Act for two weeks amid ongoing legal action.\n\nIf the appeals court does so, Trump will once again have the authority to remove suspected members of the gang without final removal orders from an immigration judge. \n\nMillett, an appointee of Democratic President Barack Obama, is one of three judges on a panel which will make the final decision.\n\nShe is joined by Judge Justin Walker, who was appointed by Republican Donald Trump during his first term as president, and Judge Karen Henderson, appointed by Republican President George Bush.\n\nWalker appeared more supportive of the government's arguments, but the court did not say when it would rule.\n\nBoasberg said people must be able to challenge the government's stance that they are indeed members of Tren de Aragua before being deported.\n\nMillett addressed this during the appeals hearing, noting: 'If the government says, we don't have to give process for that, then y'all could've picked me up on Saturday and thrown me on a plane.'\n\nShe said the administration could very easily claim she was 'a member of [Tren De Aragua] and give me no chance to protest it.' \n\nBoasberg is also weighing whether the Trump administration violated his order by failing to return deportation flights after his order was issued.\n\nThe judge wrote that the administration appeared to have 'hustled people onto those planes' to avoid a potential court order blocking the deportations.\n\nPrior to the Trump administration's invocation of the 1798 act, the law had been used three times in US history, most recently to intern and remove Japanese, German and Italian immigrants during World War Two.\n\nFamily members of many of the deported Venezuelan migrants deny the alleged gang ties. \n\nLawyers for one of the deportees, a Venezuelan professional soccer player and youth coach, said US officials had wrongly labeled him a gang member based on a tattoo of a crown meant to reference his favorite team, Real Madrid.\n\nThe case has emerged as a major test of Trump's sweeping assertion of executive power.\n\nWith Republicans holding a majority in both the House of Representatives and Senate and largely falling in line behind the president's agenda, federal judges have emerged as the final line of defense questioning the legality of Trump's wave of executive actions.\n\nAnd Trump has responded with fury to some of the court-imposed decisions against his administration. \n\nHe called for Boasberg to be impeached , sparking a rare statement from US Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts, who sternly noted that appeals, not impeachments, are the proper response to disagree with a judicial decision.\n\nStill, Trump maintains that the judiciary is overreaching in efforts to slow down and hinder his administration.","summary":"Judge Patricia Millett was scathing in her assessment of the administration's decision to send planeloads of migrants to

Trump’s almost daily attacks on Canada’s sovereignty have left Canadians feeling betrayed. \n\n\"In this crisis caused by the U.S. president and those who are enabling him, we lament a friendship lost,\" Carney said. “In Gander Canadians did extraordinary things for Americans when they needed it. Now, we need to do extraordinary things for ourselves.”\n\nGander opened its arms to nearly 6,600 airline passengers diverted there when the U.S. government shut down airspace during 9/11. \n\nIn a matter of a few hours, the town population of 10,000 in 2001 was overwhelmed by 38 planeloads of travelers, yet locals went to work in their kitchens and cleaned up spare rooms to offer space and food to the newcomers. \n\nWhen more than 200 flights were diverted to Canada following the attacks on the United States, the Canadians shunted the traffic away from Toronto and Montreal to the eastern seaboard.\n\nObscure, little-used Gander got to relive its glory days as a stopover point for trans-Atlantic aviation before long-distance flights became possible. Built in 1938 in anticipation of the coming world war, it had the world’s longest runway, and on 9/11 it was the second busiest, taking in 38 flights to Halifax, Nova Scotia’s 47.\n\nFlight crews quickly filled Gander’s hotels, so passengers were taken to schools, fire stations and church halls. The Canadian military flew in 5,000 cots. Stores donated blankets, coffee machines, barbecue grills. Unable to retrieve their luggage, passengers became dependent on the kindness of strangers, and it came in the shape of clothes, showers, toys, banks of phones to call home free of charge, an arena that became a giant walk-in fridge full of donated food.\n\nOnce all the planes had landed or turned back to Europe, Gander’s air traffic controllers switched to cooking meals in the building nonstop for three days.\n\n“More than 6,000 passengers. Overnight, the town’s population almost doubled,” Carney said during a speech to residents. “You showed friendship to people who were fearful. In a crisis, you showed your character. When people needed help, you gave it.”\n\nOn Monday, Carney visited the home of Beulah Cooper, who opened her home and comforted many, including Dennis and Hannah O’Rourke, an elderly couple whose New York firefighter son, Kevin, went missing at the World Trade Center and was later confirmed to have died there. \n\nThe O’Rourkes remained friends with Cooper long after and went back to Gander, saying they felt eternally indebted. \n\nNow, Cooper says she feels betrayed by America, though she remains friends with Hannah O'Rourke, whose husband passed away. She also feels bad for her American friends.\n\n“There’s too many bad words for me to say on the phone about what I think of Trump,” Cooper said. “Canada was the best ally they had.\"\n\nCarney noted the Gander story of that day became legend, immortalized in the Canadian-made Broadway hit musical “Come from Away.”\n\nCarney said Canadians have always been by Americans' side whether it was during the Iran hostage crisis, or more recently during the California wildfires or in Afghanistan, where Canada lost 158 members of the armed forces and seven civilians. \n\nTrump has declared a trade war on his northern neighbor and continues to call for Canada to become the 51st state, a position that has infuriated Canadians. The American president has threatened economic coercion in his annexation threats and suggested the border is a fictional line.\n\nTrump put 25% tariffs on Canada’s steel and aluminum and is threatening sweeping tariffs on all Canadian products — as well as all of America’s trading partners — on April 2. \n\nCarney said Canadians are over the shock of the betrayal but now have to look out for themselves. He said Canadians and Americans have traditionally been like brothers. \n\n\"But that’s changed. And it wasn’t us who did the changing. Unfortunately, President Trump’s actions have put that kinship under greater strain today than at any point in our storied history,” Carney said. \n\nCarney, at the start of a five-week election campaign before the vote on April 28, said he's not looking for friendship from the Americans. “I am just looking for respect at this point,” he said. \n\nThe new prime minister, sworn in March 14, still hasn’t had a phone call with Trump and suggested that might not happen until after the election. “I’m available for a call. But you know we are going to talk on our terms as a sovereign country, not as what he pretends we are,” Carney said.\n\nHe said the Americans are making a “fundamental mistake\" in the trade war. \n\n“They think they will weaken us. They think that they can own us quite frankly, that’s what they think,” he said. “We are going to get stronger. We are going to wait this out.

Renfroe, the union’s president.\nControversy Over Budget Cuts and Privatization\nEarlier this month, DeJoy outlined plans to cut 10,000 jobs and reduce USPS spending by billions of dollars, working closely with DOGE to implement these measures.\nThe announcement sparked protests among postal workers, who fear that such cuts could dismantle essential services.\nUSPS employs approximately 640,000 workers, serving communities ranging from bustling urban centers to remote rural areas and distant islands.\nCritics argue that these reductions could have widespread negative consequences.\nDemocratic U.S. Rep. Gerald Connolly of Virginia warned that shifting control of the Postal Service to DOGE could lead to its privatization, undermining its core mission of providing universal mail service.\nAs USPS stands at a crossroads, the choice of DeJoy’s successor will play a crucial role in shaping the future of one of the country’s most vital institutions.\nALSO READ: Columbia Student Protester Who Arrived In US At Age 7 Fights Deportation Order In Court","summary":"U.S. Postmaster General Louis DeJoy announced his resignation on Monday, ending a nearly five-year tenure that saw major reforms, controversies, and debates over the future of the U.S. Postal Service (USPS).","url":"https://www.newsx.com/world/us-postmaster-general-louis-dejoy-steps-down-after-5-year-tenure-amid-postal-service-reforms/","image":"https://www.newsx.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Louis-DeJoy.webp","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-03-25 00:20:27","author":"Ashish Rana","authors":["Ashish Rana"],"language":"en","source_country":"in","sentiment":0.098},{"id":303752756,"title":"Prime Minister Keir Starmer is holding fresh trade talks with US amid last-ditch bid to avoid tariffs on UK exports","text":"Prime Minister Keir Starmer is holding fresh trade talks with US amid last-ditch bid to avoid tariffs on UK exports\n\nPODCAST: All the latest headlines, including Trump’s bold move to void Biden’s pardons and Gavin Newsom’s unexpected statue plans\n\nFind the best Amazon Spring Sale deals on tech, home and beauty\n\nLISTEN: Trump, Zelensky, the rise of Europe’s Far Right and what’s next for NATO – listen to Alas Vine & Hitchens wherever you get your podcasts..\n\nBy JASON GROVES POLITICAL EDITOR\n\nPublished: 23:41 GMT, 24 March 2025 | Updated: 00:19 GMT, 25 March 2025\n\nKeir Starmer has held fresh talks with Donald Trump on a US trade deal amid mounting speculation Britain could scrap a tax on American tech firms in a bid to avoid tariffs on UK exports.\n\nDowning Street yesterday revealed that the Prime Minister spoke with the US President by phone on Sunday night to 'discuss progress' on a possible deal.\n\nMinisters are scrambling to secure an exemption from swingeing American tariffs which are due to come into force on April 2.\n\nWhitehall sources have confirmed that dropping the £800million Digital Services Tax, which is levied mainly on US tech firms, has formed part of the discussions.\n\nAt the weekend, Chancellor Rachel Reeves refused to rule out ditching the 2 per cent levy on the UK revenues of social media, search engines and online shopping platforms like Google, Amazon and Meta.\n\nBut yesterday she indicated she will resist the move, describing the tax as 'hugely important'. \n\nThe Chancellor added: 'We will continue to make sure that businesses pay their fair share of tax, including businesses in the digital sector.'\n\nThe levy was introduced in 2020 to help ensure tech firms pay more tax and counter criticism that they enjoy an unfair tax advantage compared with high street retailers.

Members of Congress on both sides of the aisle criticized the security breach, though Democrats took a harsher stance about how it should be addressed, with many demanding an immediate investigation. Sen. Jack Reed of Rhode Island, the top Democrat on the Armed Services Committee, said the breach represents \"one of the most egregious failures of operational security and common sense\" he has ever seen. \"Military operations need to be handled with utmost discretion, using approved, secure lines of communication, because American lives are on the line. The carelessness shown by President Trump's cabinet is stunning and dangerous. I will be seeking answers from the Administration immediately,\" Reed's statement said. Sen. Roger Wicker of Mississippi, the Republican chair of the Armed Services Committee, said, \"It's definitely a concern, and it appears that mistakes were made.\"\"There are likely to be classified briefings about this soon,\" Wicker said, adding that his committee will \"absolutely\" look into it. In a piece published Monday, Jeffrey Goldberg, The Atlantic's editor in chief, recounted how he says he was inadvertently added to a group chat that included national security adviser Mike Waltz, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, Vice President JD Vance and others on the encrypted messaging app Signal earlier this month. In the chat, Hegseth detailed the plans to bomb Houthi targets in Yemen shortly before the strikes took place, and other top officials weighed in, according to Goldberg. The Atlantic said it did not publish all of the messages because some of the details were too sensitive.The National Security Council acknowledged in a statement to CBS News that the group chat Goldberg reported \"appears to be authentic.\"\"At this time, the message thread that was reported appears to be authentic, and we are reviewing how an inadvertent number was added to the chain,\" a National Security Council spokesman said. \"The thread is a demonstration of the deep and thoughtful policy coordination between senior officials. The ongoing success of the Houthi operation demonstrates that there were no threats to our service members or our national security.\"Hegseth said Monday evening that \"nobody was texting war plans,\" and he slammed Goldberg as \"a deceitful and highly discredited so-called journalist\" who \"peddles hoaxes.\"Asked about the report, President Trump said, \"I don't know anything about it. I'm not a big fan of The Atlantic. It's going out of business. It's not much of a magazine.\" White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said in a statement, \"President Trump continues to have the utmost confidence in his national security team, including National Security Advisor Mike Waltz.\"Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, a New York Democrat, said on the Senate floor, \"This debacle requires a full investigation into how this happened, damage it created, and how we can avoid it in the future. If our nation's military secrets are being peddled around over unsecure text chains, we need to know that at once. We need to put a stop to it immediately.\"He added, \"When Pete Hegseth came before the Senate as a nominee, Democrats warned that something like this might happen. These people are clearly not up for the job. We warned confirming them was dangerous, that they'd behave recklessly. Unfortunately, we were right.\"Democratic Sen. Jacky Rosen of Nevada, who serves on the Armed Services Committee and Foreign Relations Committee, slammed the incident as \"a dangerous level of incompetence\" and \"an inexcusable failure.\" Sen. Chris Coons, a Democrat from Delaware, called it \"a shocking breach\" and urged a \"prompt and thorough investigation\" into the matter. House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries told CBS News that there should \"absolutely\" be a congressional investigation \"so that we can understand what happened, why did it happen, and how do we prevent this type of national security breach from ever happening again.\"\"This is reckless, irresponsible, and dangerous,\" the New York Democrat said. \"Who are some of these people that Donald Trump has put into the most sensitive national security positions in America? We were promised that Donald Trump was going to hire the very best. It's all phony.\"House Armed Services Committee Ranking Member Adam Smith called the incident \"deeply troubling.\" \"You're discussing war plans over the signal app. I mean, that's just unimaginable. There are secure lines of communication to do this, and anybody with just a rudimentary understanding of how national security works knows this. but apparently, Secretary Hegseth and Mike Waltz and the gang don't know,\" he said.House Intelligence Committee Ranking Member Jim Himes raised concern that the phones could have been vulnerable to hacking. \"Let's assume that the people on the Signal chat were probably the top targets for some of our global enemies. It is by the grace of God that one of those enemies didn't alert the Houthis in advance so that they could reconfigure their anti aircraft assets, and had they done that, we would be looking at dead pilots right now. That's how serious what this administration did is.\"Rep. Betty McCollum, a Democrat from Minnesota, raised the question of whether the officials violated the Espionage Act. Republican Reps. Don Bacon of Nebraska and Mike Lawler of New York criticized the use of an encrypted messaging app to discuss the war plans. \"This can get our troops killed. Secure phones are mandatory for these kinds of communications. Russia and China are definitely monitoring their unclassified phones hoping they share info like this,\" Bacon said. \"Classified information should not be transmitted on unsecured channels — and certainly not to those without security clearances, including reporters. Period,\" Lawler wrote. \"Safeguards must be put in place to ensure this never happens again.\" House Speaker Mike Johnson, however, offered a defense of the conduct and said the reporting showed \"top level officials doing their job, doing it well, and executing on a plan with precision.\" \"That mission was a success. No one was jeopardized because of it. We're grateful for that, but they will certainly, I'm sure, make sure that that doesn't happen again,\" the Louisiana Republican told reporters. Johnson added that he didn't think Waltz, who apparently started the group chat and included the journalist, according to Goldberg's report, should be disciplined.","summary":"The editor of The Atlantic reported that he was accidentally included in a Trump administration group chat about the U.S. plans to bomb Yemen.","url":"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/group-chat-trump-war-plans-yemen-lawmakers-react/","image":"https://assets2.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2025/03/24/3615083a-0904-446b-910d-002f2baa6392/thumbnail/1200x630g2/7b639e270c77f5b7b175ceea2ed1fda3/gettyimages-2198907321.jpg?v=9e5c48f1b04ac2a564e8a4c51250ac89","video":"https://prod.vodvideo.cbsnews.com/cbsnews/vr/hls/3630379_hls/master.m3u8","publish_date":"2025-03-25 00:18:20","author":"Caitlin Yilek","authors":["Caitlin Yilek"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.042},{"id":303748146,"title":"World News | Ex-village Peace Committee Member Gunned Down in Pakistan's Khyber Pakhtunkhwa","text":"Peshawar, Mar 25 (AP) In an apparent targeted killing, unknown gunmen shot dead a former member of a village peace committee in northwest Pakistan, police said.

The case gained attention after a video of the crime surfaced on social media, leading to public outcry. Authorities exhumed her body for autopsy on March 28. Faisal, the primary accused, confessed to the killing on camera while in police custody on March 31. He initially claimed that he had raped and strangled his sister to conceal an incestuous relationship. However, a forensic examination later confirmed that she was neither raped nor pregnant, contrary to earlier allegations.\nAlso Read | Donald Trump Administration in US Asks Supreme Court To Halt Judge's Order To Rehire Probationary Federal Workers.\nFollowing the investigation, police amended the charges in the case. Initially registered under Sections 34 (common intention), 201 (causing disappearance of evidence), and 302 (murder) of the Pakistan Penal Code (PPC), the case was later updated to include Section 311 (honour killing) after police concluded that Maria was killed by her father and brother in the name of honour.\nFaisal's brother, Shahbaz, and his wife, Sumaira, were also arrested separately for allegedly concealing the murder. According to police statements, Maria had confided in Shahbaz a day before her death that she had been raped by Faisal and their father.

In case of non-payment, they would serve six months of simple imprisonment. The order directed that they remain in district jail until execution warrants are issued, and the case record be forwarded to the LHC for confirmation of the sentence.

Stein said it was also funny “how objectively bad the portrait is”.\n\nFormer Republican attorney Ron Filipkowski, editor-in-chief of the liberal news website MeidasTouch Network, wrote on X that Trump was “the most fragile, sensitive snowflake in history” while sharing a screenshot of the president’s Truth Social post.\n\nAnother social media account named Republicans Against Trump also shared the president’s post while calling him “a petty, insecure baby”.\n\nTrump alleged without evidence that his portrait had been “purposefully distorted”. The president then complained that his Democratic presidential predecessor Barack Obama “looks wonderful” in his portrait at the Colorado capitol.\n\nDespite Trump’s criticism of Polis for the painting, it was actually unveiled by a Republican group in 2019. A former Republican state senator had crowdfunded nearly $10,000 to commission the painting, according to Colorado news station KUSA.\n\nTrump did not have a portrait hanging in the Colorado state capitol for his first presidency, which began in 2017. In 2018, a liberal political activist placed a large portrait of Vladimir Putin – whom Trump openly admires – in the empty space, but it was quickly removed by capitol staff.\n\nThat prompted then Republican state senator Kevin Grantham to raise money through a GoFundMe campaign to hang Trump’s portrait in the state capitol.\n\nA Polis spokesperson told KUSA that the governor was “surprised to learn the President of the United States is an aficionado of our Colorado state capitol and its artwork”.\n\n“We appreciate the president and everyone’s interest in our capitol building and are always looking for any opportunity to improve our visitor experience,” the Polis spokesperson added.\n\nTrump’s Sunday night comments had prompted a steady stream of visitors to pose for photos with the painting before the announcement that it would be taken down.\n\nAaron Howe, visiting from Wyoming on Monday, stood in front of Trump’s portrait, looking down at photos of the president on his phone, then back up at the portrait.\n\n“Honestly he looks a little chubby,” said Howe of the portrait, but “better than I could do”.\n\n“I don’t know anything about the artist,” said Howe, who voted for Trump. “It could be taken one way or the other.”\n\nKaylee Williamson, an 18-year-old Trump supporter from Arkansas, got a photo with the portrait.\n\n“I think it looks like him.

plus legal fees and $500,000 in damages.\n\nThe complaint was filed at the Manhattan Supreme Court by Michael Madaio, Habba's partner at their law firm based in Bedminster, New Jersey.\n\nIt is unclear if Reuben, a millionaire who runs a parking lot company in Manhattan, ever gave the ring to Habba before his suspicions were aroused about its authenticity.\n\nBut his complaint, filed in 2021, makes clear that he believes he was the victim of 'fraudulent and deceptive business practices and false advertising'.\n\nHe cites the Allurez website which states that its jewels are often appraised for 'double' their value.\n\nThe website states: 'We have been told by our customers that they were able to get the jewelry they purchased from us appraised for at least double the price they paid. \n\n'Our prices are low, and the quality of our jewelry is so high, that they can be easily appraised for at least double.'\n\nIn reality, Allurez offers 'inferior quality' diamonds, court papers claimed.\n\nReuben alleged that when he bought Habba's ring, he was given a certificate from a company called 'EGL Canada' proving its worth.\n\nBut that is not the same as the respected EGL USA, a US-based certification company.\n\nEGL Canada frequently overstates the value of jewels and is not in business any longer, the lawsuit states, adding that its producers were not supposed to be sold in America.\n\nThe EGL report stated that it was a '7.61-carat diamond with a G color grade', an 'excellent' cut and an SI2 clarity grade.\n\nIn the lawsuit, Reuben included the analysis by GIA, another diamond grading company, which he commissioned himself after the purchase.\n\nit said that the cut was only 'good' and that the color was I2 and the clarity was L, both of which are inferior to the EGL report.\n\nThe lawsuit states: 'The color, cut, and clarity of a diamond significantly affect the diamond's value.\n\n'The difference in a single color or clarity grade can affect a diamond's per carat value by thousands of dollars'.\n\nThe GIA valuation put the diamond's worth at just $15,240 which Reuben called a 'far cry' from the $93,250 he says he paid for the gem.\n\nThe lawsuit alleges that the jewel wasn't even supposed to be on sale in the US and had Reuben known its real value, he would never have bought it.\n\n'Were it not for Defendants' false, deceptive and misleading representations as to the size/weight and color of the diamond, the legitimacy of the certification and the overall quality of Allurez's products (Reuben) would not have purchased the ring.'\n\nIn their response, lawyers for Allurez said that Reuben's allegations were 'mere puffery'.\n\nThey denied false advertising and said that they could not vouch for the assessment of the jewel by EGL Canada.\n\nAllurez's lawyers asked for the case to be dismissed in a May 2021 filing, one of the latest in the case.\n\nThe most recent document in the lawsuit - which is still listed as active on the New York state court website - is from Reuben's lawyers asking for an update from the court.\n\nHabba and Reuben were married in 2020 in a private ceremony.\n\nShe has two children from her first marriage to Matthew Eyet - they were together from 2011 to 2019 - while Reuben has one child from his previous marriage.\n\nReuben is a Harvard Business School graduate and runs numerous car parking sites in Manhattan which have made him a millionaire.\n\nDespite the drama surrounding the $93,000 diamond ring, Habba is moving up the ladder under President Trump's administration. \n\nTrump announced on Monday to his Truth Social account that Habba, who had been working in the White House as his counselor, would serve as interim US Attorney in her home state of New Jersey - replacing John Giordano who is taking up the role as ambassador to Namibia. \n\nHabba first met Trump at his Bedminster club in New Jersey in 2019. Soon after, she was brought in for an interview to join his legal team.\n\nWhen she took a role with the administration years later, she left her husband and two children and stepson back in New Jersey, traveling between D.C. and her home state frequently for the two months of her tenure.\n\nBut Habba's high-profile job doesn't appear to interfere with her personal life, as the lawyer does not post about her husband or her family life on her social media platforms as frequently as she does about Trump-related matters.\n\nIn November 2022, she shared a picture of a bouquet of flowers on her Instagram page and wrote: 'Marry someone who buys you flowers to celebrate your first date'.\n\nIn March last year she posted a photo of her and Reuben with the President and First Lady Melania Trump.\n\nAnother rare photo of Reuben followed on Instagram in January this year in a series of photos showing her first week in the White House.\n\nIn a podcast interview last year, she gave a rare insight into her marriage and said: 'I'm not a feminist, I believe in strong women, but I want my door opened. I'm very much an... old school woman.\n\n'When I'm at home, I cook, I have a husband I respect, I know how to turn it on'.\n\nDailyMail.com contacted lawyers for Reuben and Allurez for comment.\n\nReached by phone, Allurez chief executive Raphi Mahgerefteh said he would look into the case but didn't call back.","summary":"The millionaire husband of one of Donald Trump's most trusted lawyers, Alina Habba, is claiming he was overcharged for an engagement ring and has been battling for his money back for five years.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-14532207/trump-alina-habba-husband-gregg-reuben-fraud-diamond-ring-allurez.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/03/24/21/96526535-0-image-m-82_1742851227702.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-03-25 00:11:24","author":"Daniel Bates,Editor","authors":["Daniel Bates","Editor"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.668},{"id":303750074,"title":"Hegseth Says ‘Nobody Was Texting War Plans’ After The Atlantic Editor Claims He Was Part Of Signal Chat","text":"Share to Facebook\n\nShare to Twitter\n\nShare to Linkedin\n\nDefense Secretary Pete Hegseth claimed Monday that “nobody was texting war plans” after The Atlantic editor-in-chief Jeffrey Goldberg published an article saying he was accidentally added to a Signal group where Hegseth and other top Trump administration officials discussed highly sensitive plans to attack Houthi targets in Yemen, which has drawn heavy backlash and scrutiny of Trump’s Pentagon head pick.\n\nHegseth made the comments to journalists Monday afternoon.

Alaska State Troopers said the body of 16-year-old Tucker Challan of Soldotna was recovered from the avalanche on Sunday by the Alaska Mountain Rescue Group. Also Read | Donald Trump Administration in US Asks Supreme Court To Halt Judge's Order To Rehire Probationary Federal Workers. Troopers said a group of snowmachiners were riding on Saturday on the backside of Seattle Ridge in Turnagain Pass, a popular winter recreation area about 97 km southeast of Anchorage. “Witnesses said a juvenile male triggered an avalanche and died after being buried,” troopers said in a statement. Also Read | How India’s Market Slump Impacts Small Investors. Challan was buried about 10-feet deep in the slide that measured about 500-feet wide, said Wendy Wagner, director of the Chugach National Forest Avalanche Center. Conditions are worrisome because a weak layer is located about 3-feet beneath the snow surface, with newer snow falling on top of the weak layer. Challan rode over a weak layer of snow that was buried under newer snow, about mid-slope, Wagner said. When the slide happened, the centre's staff was conducting an avalanche awareness day in a parking lot on the other side of Seattle Ridge, she said. “These types of avalanches, they can be triggered when you're on this slope. They can be triggered when you're on the bottom of the slope and even the side or the top of a slope, because all you have to do is break that weak layer, and then that weak layer shoots out like dominoes and breaks into the slopes,\" she said. The weak layer can be broken on a flat track, but that wouldn't cause an avalanche because there is no slope for the snow to come down. “When we have avalanche conditions like this, as avalanche professionals, we recommend people just stay on slopes that aren't steep enough to slide, and then they don't have to worry about triggering an avalanche, and sadly, this person was not in that scenario,\" Wagner said. “They were on the edge of the slope and ended up being caught.” The avalanche centre has been warning people of this weak layer for weeks, and there were similar conditions on March 4, when three heli-skiers were killed. That accident happened when they were caught in an avalanche near Girdwood, about 64 km south of Anchorage.

Two such stocks are Palantir Technologies (PLTR 6.43%) and Reddit (RDDT 8.03%).\n\nPalantir shares surged more than 250% over the past 12 months through March 20. Reddit stock skyrocketed from a 52-week low of $37.35 last April to a jaw-dropping high of $230.41 in February.\n\nAnd now may be the time to pick up shares in one of these businesses. Uncertainty around the U.S. economy and Donald Trump's tariffs has caused volatility in the stock market over recent weeks, pushing down the price of many stocks, including Palantir and Reddit.\n\nBoth are down substantially from their 52-week highs reached in February. \n\nPLTR data by YCharts\n\nWhich is the better buy now?\n\nPalantir's AI strength\n\nPalantir is well positioned to capitalize on the rapidly expanding artificial intelligence industry. The company spent years building digital tools that allows its software to understand relationships between all kinds of data. The ontology is the heart of its AI Platform (AIP), and why AIP enables organizations to implement AI in as little as a few days.\n\nAIP's a hit with customers, causing Palantir's sales to soar. It ended 2024 with $2.9 billion in revenue, a 29% increase from 2023's $2.2 billion.\n\nNot only is Palantir's revenue rising, but it also runs a profitable business. It reported a strong gross margin of 80% in 2024. This led to net income of $468 million last year, an increase from 2023's $217 million.\n\nNext, Palantir is expanding its business into the multitrillion-dollar manufacturing industry with a new product, Warp Speed. Launched in 2024, Warp Speed aims to boost manufacturing with AIP-fueled software to manage elements such as supply chains and resource planning.\n\nReddit's social media success\n\nReddit shares exploded over the past year (up 165%) as the company delivered outstanding business performance. For starters, the social media giant exhibited strong user growth in 2024, nearly 20 years in to its existence. \n\nReddit exited 2024 with \"daily active unique uniques\" (DAUq) of 101.7 million, a 39% year-over-year increase. A DAUq is a person visiting Reddit's website or mobile app at least once in a 24-hour period.\n\nAs a social media company, Reddit relies on users to keep its virtual communities thriving. It's essentially a giant online forum where people can participate in discussions about a vast range of topics and interests.\n\nThe DAUq numbers is also important because the company depends on advertising for revenue, and the more users who see ads on Reddit, the more money the company can generate. That showed in the company's 2024 performance.\n\nReddit crossed the $1 billion revenue mark as it exited 2024 with $1.3 billion in sales. This result represented amazing 62% growth over 2023's $804 million.\n\nNot only is Reddit attracting users, and thereby growing revenue, but the company also runs a highly profitable business. Its gross margin hit an eye-popping 90.5% in 2024, which was a significant increase from the prior year's 86.2%.\n\nConsequently, Reddit ended the fourth quarter with net income of $71 million, up from $18.5 million in 2023. For the full year, however, Reddit had a net loss of $484.3 million due to costs associated with last year's IPO.\n\nBut with 2024 behind it, and a high gross margin, Reddit is well positioned to extend its Q4 profitability into subsequent quarters.\n\nChoosing between Palantir and Reddit\n\nThe strong performance Palantir and Reddit delivered in 2024 explains why both saw share prices soar. In 2025, they anticipate sales to continue growing.\n\nPalantir forecasts Q1 revenue to reach at least $858 million, a 35% jump from the prior year's $634 million. Meanwhile, Reddit expects Q1 sales to range between $360 million and $370 million. That would represent a minimum 48% increase from 2024's Q1 sales of $243 million.\n\nGiven their strong business performance, choosing between these tech stocks -- if you want to only buy one -- is a challenge. As a tie-breaker, here's a look at both companies' valuations using their forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratios. This metric tells you how much investors are willing to pay for a dollar's worth of earnings based on earnings estimates for the next 12 months.\n\nData by YCharts.\n\nWith recent stock market volatility causing Palantir and Reddit shares to take a hit, both saw forward P/E multiples decline from February to March. Even so, Reddit's 36 times forward P/E is substantially lower than Palantir's 156. This indicates Reddit stock is the better value.\n\nYou could own shares in both given they are both well-run businesses delivering outstanding results. But if you have to choose one, Reddit's superior valuation gives it the edge over Palantir as the tech stock to buy now.","url":"https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/03/24/better-tech-stock-palantir-vs-reddit/?source=askdougpancakes&utm_source=chromefollow&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=news&referring_guid=320e8c58-7862-49ef-a196-0a0408e54406","image":"https://g.foolcdn.com/image/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fg.foolcdn.com%2Feditorial%2Fimages%2F811821%2Foffice_workers_look_at_laptop-gettyimages-1633189672-1201x633-30e6268.png&amp;op=resize&amp;w=1200&amp;h=630","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-03-25 00:08:00","author":"Robert Izquierdo","authors":["Robert Izquierdo"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.023},{"id":303748166,"title":"World News | Chilean President Gabriel Boric to Visit India, Focus on Trade and Investment","text":"Santiago [Chile], March 25 (ANI): Chilean President Gabriel Boric Font will make a state visit to India from March 30 to April 6, marking the first visit by a Chilean head of state to the country in 16 years.

The artwork, which hangs alongside portraits of other presidents at Colorado state Capitol, was unveiled in 2019 at the cost of $10,000 (£7,700), sourced through crowdfunding. Mr Trump, though, branded it \"unflattering\" in a furious tirade on his social media platform Truth Social, and demanded it to be taken down. Within hours, House Democrats said in a statement the oil painting will be removed and will be replaced by one \"which depicts his contemporary likeness.\" The Democrats said: \"If the GOP (Grand Old Party - the Republican Party) wants to spend time and money on which portrait of Trump hangs in the Capitol, then that’s up to them. Mr Trump's comments prompted a steady stream of visitors to pose for photos with the painting before the announcement that it would be taken down. Aaron Howe, visiting the Colorado state Capitol in Denver from Wyoming, stood in front of Mr Trump’s portrait, looking down at photos of the president on his phone, then back up at the portrait. Mr Howe, who voted for Mr Trump, said: \"Honestly he looks a little chubby, but it's better than I could do... I don't know anything about the artist. It could be taken one way or the other.\" However, Kaylee Williamson, an 18-year-old Trump supporter from Arkansas, got a photo with the portrait. She said: \"I think it looks like him. I guess he's smoother than all the other ones. I think it's fine.\" While Mr Trump took umbrage at his painting, he praised that of former President Barack Obama – also by the same artist Sarah Boardman - saying \"he looks wonderful.\" However, referring to his own image, Mr Trump said online: \"Nobody likes a bad picture or painting of themselves, but the one in Colorado, in the state Capitol, put up by the Governor, along with all other Presidents, was purposefully distorted to a level that even I, perhaps, have never seen before.\" The portraits are not the purview of the Colorado governor’s office but the Colorado Building Advisory Committee. The ones up to and including President Jimmy Carter were donated as a collection. The others were donated by political parties or, more recently, paid for by outside fundraising, like in Mr Trump's case. The Legislature's executive committee, made up of both Democratic and Republican leadership, signed a letter directing the removal of Trump's portrait. Lundeen, the Republican senator who requested it, noted that Grover Cleveland, whose presidential terms were separated like Trump's, had a portrait from his second term. Ms Boardman did not immediately respond to a request for comment from The Associated Press. In interviews from the time with The Denver Post, Boardman said it was important that her depictions of both Mr Obama and Mr Trump looked apolitical. \"There will always be dissent, so pleasing one group will always inflame another. I consider a neutrally thoughtful, and nonconfrontational, portrait allows everyone to reach their own conclusions in their own time,\" the gifted artist told the Colorado Times Recorder in 2019.","summary":"Colorado state Capitol has caved into Donald Trump's demand the presidential portrait to be removed, which was followed by bizarre comments from guests at the Denver building","url":"https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/us-news/donald-trump-sparks-major-change-34924861","image":"https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/article34924876.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200b/1_President-Trump-And-Defense-Secretary-Hegseth-Speak-In-The-Oval-Office.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-03-25 00:04:49","author":"Bradley Jolly","authors":["Bradley Jolly"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.267},{"id":303746922,"title":"Atlantic editor says he was added to chat where US officials discussed strikes on Houthis","text":"WASHINGTON, March 25. /TASS/.

Vance\" (the name of the Vice President of the United States).\n\nFor several days, the chat hosted what Goldberg described as a fascinating political discussion. The editor claims that on March 15, a user named \"Pete Hegseth\" (the name of the Pentagon chief) posted a message allegedly containing details of upcoming strikes against the Houthis, including a list of targets, the weaponry to be used, and the estimated start time of the strikes. Goldberg noted that this timing coincided with the first reports of bombings appearing on social media.\n\nAccording to the journalist, White House National Security Council Spokesman Brian Hughes confirmed to him the authenticity of the group chat on Signal.\n\nOn Monday, US President Donald Trump, when asked by journalists to comment on The Atlantic editor’s article, stated that he was unaware of the situation.\n\nOn March 15, following Donald Trump’s orders, the United States launched massive strikes on Houthi targets in Yemen, where the group controls approximately one-third of the country’s territory. According to the US Central Command, the operation was aimed at protecting US interests and ensuring the freedom of navigation. In response, the Ansar Allah movement carried out a series of attacks on the US aircraft carrier USS Harry Truman in the northern Red Sea, using missiles and drones. No reports of damage to the vessel have been received as a result of the strikes.","summary":"He stated that the chat included approximately 18 participants, among them a user going by the name \"J.D.

Yunseo Chung, a 21-year-old lawful permanent resident, said the US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) moved to deport her after she was arrested on March 5 while protesting the Ivy League school's disciplinary actions against student protesters.

News reports at the time identified her as being among a group of protesters arrested after a sit-in at a library on the adjacent Barnard College campus. Within days of her arrest, Chung said in the lawsuit, ICE officials signed an administrative arrest warrant and went to her parents' residence seeking to detain her. Also Read | How India’s Market Slump Impacts Small Investors. On March 10, Chung said, a federal law enforcement official told her lawyer that her lawful permanent resident status was being \"revoked\". Three days later, Chung said, law enforcement agents executed search warrants at two Columbia-owned residences, including her dormitory, seeking travel and immigration records, and other documents. Chung has lived in the US since emigrating from South Korea with her parents at age 7, according to her lawsuit. The Columbia junior is seeking a court order to block the Trump administration's efforts to deport non-citizens who participated in campus protests against Israel's military actions in Gaza. She is asking a judge to prevent the administration from detaining her, moving her out of New York City or removing her from the country while her lawsuit plays out. “ICE's shocking actions against Ms Chung form part of a larger pattern of attempted US government repression of constitutionally protected protest activity and other forms of speech,\" Chung's lawsuit, which was filed in federal court in Manhattan, said. Officials at the highest echelons of government, the lawsuit said, \"are attempting to use immigration enforcement as a bludgeon to suppress speech that they dislike, including Ms Chung's speech\". Messages seeking comment were left for ICE and the US Department of Homeland Security. Chung's lawsuit cited the administration's efforts to deport five other students who've spoken out, including Khalil and Momodou Taal, of Cornell University, who received a notice last week to surrender to immigration authorities after he sued on March 15 to preempt deportation efforts. Taal, 31, a PhD student in Africana studies, is a citizen of the United Kingdom and Gambia. In a court filing, the justice department said Taal's student visa was revoked before he filed his lawsuit for his alleged involvement in “disruptive protests” that \"disregarded\" university policies and created a \"hostile environment\" for Jewish students. But, the justice department said, ICE agents had trouble locating him. Taal's lawyer, Eric Lee, said on Monday that his client is not being required to surrender before a hearing in the lawsuit Tuesday in Syracuse. Cornell suspended Taal for a second time last fall after a group of pro-Palestinian activists disrupted a campus career fair. He has limited access to the upstate New York campus as he continues his studies remotely. In his lawsuit, Taal and co-plaintiffs argue President Trump's executive orders spurring the crackdown violate the free speech rights of international students and scholars. Taal claimed he was at the career fair protest for five minutes and had faced no criminal charges. “If the First Amendment does not protect the right to attend a demonstration, what's left? Not much,\" Lee said. Other students and faculty have had visas revoked or were blocked from entering the US because they attended demonstrations or publicly expressed support for Palestinians. The administration has been citing a seldom-invoked legal statute that authorises the secretary of state to revoke visas of non-citizens who could be considered a threat to US foreign-policy interests. In one of the most high-profile cases, immigration officials detained Khalil, a Columbia graduate student, and told him his green card was being revoked because he participated in protests. Khalil, who received a master's degree last semester, served as a negotiator for students as they bargained with Columbia officials over an end to their campus tent encampment last spring. The Trump administration has argued that his prominent role in the protests amounted to antisemitic support for Hamas, a U.S.-designated terrorist group. In newly filed papers, government lawyers said Khalil also failed to disclose his past work with the United Nations agency for Palestinian refugees, his continued employment with the British embassy for Syria, based in Beirut, nor his involvement with Columbia University Apartheid Divest, a coalition group of anti-Israel student organizations. A lawyer for Khalil called the allegations “plainly thin\" and said the government would have to prove any omission was willful and materially important. The government has also detained a scholar at Georgetown University and refused to let a professor at Brown University's medical school enter the US.

In the 2021 federal election, the province broke three ways with the Liberals claiming 15 seats and the NDP and Conservatives claiming 13 each.\n\nBut with the NDP struggling in the polls, UBC political scientist Max Cameron said the other two parties will be looking to make gains.\n\n“British Columbia is important for both parties,” he said. “If you look at the electoral map, there is a lot of support for the Liberals and the NDP in Metro Vancouver and the Island, but as soon as you get out of the Lower Mainland into the interior of the province, it’s really an ocean of blue.”\n\nWith the snap election call the parties are also scrambling to flesh out their rosters in B.C., and some so-called star candidates have already been announced, while others who were rumoured to be seeking a nomination have pulled out.\n\nFormer Vancouver Mayor Gregor Robertson will run for the Liberals in Vancouver Fraserview-South Burnaby.\n\nRetiring Vancouver Police Chief Adam Palmer, meanwhile, has now confirmed he will not run for the Conservatives.\n\nFormer B.C. premier Christy Clark also revealed Monday that she would not run after sources say she lobbied for a Liberal nomination in the Surrey area.\n\n“I’ve received lots of encouragement and good wishes from Liberals and many other friends from across the country,” Clark wrote on social media.\n\n“Many thanks to all of you, but I won’t be running as a candidate in this election. Good luck to all those who are running for office. Thank you for stepping up for Canada at a critical moment for us all.”\n\nAs the local scene continues to shake out, the federal leaders have been making their pitches.\n\nLiberal Leader Mark Carney was in Gander, N.L., where Canadians welcomed dozens of flights after the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks and called the city a great representation of Canada.\n\n“The important thing in a crisis is to know the difference between what you can change and what you can’t,” Carney said.\n\n“We can’t change Donald Trump, and a person who worships Donald Trump like Pierre Poilievre will kneel before him, not stand up against him.”\n\nConservative Leader Pierre Poilievre was in Brampton, Ont., where he pledged a 15-per cent income tax cut if elected.\n\n“Because we are cutting the lowest bracket, every single Canadian who pays income tax will pay less,” Poilievre said. “Modest income will pay less in overall terms and less in their shared income.”\n\nNDP Leader Jagmeet Singh was in Montreal, making a housing pledge and calling out Alberta Premier Danielle Smith over an interview with Brietbart where she appeared to suggest she’d asked the Trump administration to pause tariffs because they were helping the Liberals.\n\n“I think we should denounce it and call it out for being shameful, and really the focus should be doing everything we can to stop these tariffs,” he said.\n\nThe shadow of U.S. President Donald Trump and his tariff and annexation threats looms large over the campaign and turned what once appeared to be a sure Conservative blowout into a tight Liberal-Conservative race, according to recent polls.\n\nCameron said he expects the candidates to battle hard to show how they are the best candidates to protect Canada from tariffs and attract investment to ward off an economic shock.\n\n“That is going to lead to discussion I think around projects, unlocking and starting projects quickly, and that could include things like pipelines which of course are highly controversial in British Columbia,” he said.\n\nBack on the streets of New Westminster, NDP candidate Julian had one overriding message, all partisan politics aside: vote.\n\n“We’re seeing that democratic right eroded in many countries, including in our American neighbours, so Canadians need to stand up, stand up for Canada,” he said.\n\n“And the best way to stand up for Canada is voting on April 28.”","summary":"British Columbia gained one additional riding this election, and with its 43 seats is again shaping up to be a battleground.","url":"https://globalnews.ca/news/11095565/bc-federal-election-1st-full-day/","image":"https://globalnews.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/advancevote10122019.jpg?quality=85&#038;strip=all","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-03-24 23:56:41","author":"Simon Little","authors":["Simon Little"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"ca","sentiment":0.271},{"id":303743392,"title":"Postmaster General Louis DeJoy resigns","text":"The head of the beleaguered U.S. Postal Service, Louis DeJoy, resigned Monday after nearly five years in the position, leaving as President Donald Trump and Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency have floated the idea of privatizing mail service.\n\nDeJoy had said last month he planned to step down but hadn’t set a date.

Witkoff said he believed the heart of the conflict was Russia's desire to control four regions of Ukraine it partially occupied and has claimed annexed since 2022: Donetsk, Luhansk, Zaporizhzhia and Kherson.\n\nTalking about Putin's claims to the regions in eastern and southern Ukraine, Witkoff suggested Russia had a right to them because they were majority Russian-speaking and repeated a false Kremlin claim that fair referenda there showed residents wanted to be absorbed by Russia.\n\n\"They are Russian-speaking, and there have been referendums where the overwhelming majority of the people have indicated that they want to be under Russian rule,\" Witkoff told Carlson.\n\nHowever, Witkoff did not acknowledge that the supposed referenda held in those territories -- whether in 2014 in the case of Crimea or 2022 in the other regions -- were widely dismissed by Western powers, human rights organizations and international bodies as fraudulent and illegitimate.\n\nRussia conducted referenda in the areas it occupied in Ukraine's Donetsk, Luhansk, Zaporizhzhia and Kherson regions in the fall of 2022, several months after seizing them with its full-scale invasion launched in February that year. Putin used the referenda to justify Russia's subsequent annexation of the regions. Russia also held a similar referendum in Crimea in 2014 following its occupation of the Ukrainian peninsula.\n\nThe referenda were staged after Russia's invasion had already forced hundreds of thousands of Ukrainians to flee, and while Russian security forces were abducting and torturing anyone expressing opposition to its takeover. In some areas, Russian soldiers were filmed accompanying vote collectors as they went from house to house.\n\nNo legitimate independent international observers monitored the referenda and they were widely dismissed as shams, including by the United States. The United Nations General Assembly rejected the referenda as illegal and violating the U.N. Charter.\n\nIn September 2022, then-Secretary of State Antony Blinken said the U.S. \"does not, and will never, recognize any of the Kremlin's claims to sovereignty over parts of Ukraine that it's seized by force and now purports to incorporate into Russia.\"\n\nWitkoff made the remarks on the Russian referenda a day before a new round of talks between the U.S. and Russia in Saudi Arabia aimed at trying to make progress toward ending the war. His portrayal of the referenda as legitimate triggered some fierce criticism in Europe.\n\n\"Witkoff's repeating of Kremlin lies about 'russian-speakers' [sic] wanting to 'join Russia' is truly chilling,\" Lithuania's former foreign minister, Gabrielius Landsbergis, wrote on X. \"Hearing Americans talk like this should be an electric shock for Europe, not a wakeup call.\"\n\nSome Ukrainian members of parliament also condemned Witkoff's comments. \n\nOleksandr Merezhko, head of the parliamentary foreign affairs committee, told Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty that the statements were \"shocking.\"\n\n\"I don't understand what this is about -- ignorance, naivety, unprofessionalism?\" said Merezhko, who suggested Witkoff should be removed from his negotiating role. \"Because we are talking about a representative of the president, who should professionally understand this issue and know some basic things. And he doesn't know this. He is relaying Russian propaganda.\"\n\nIn the interview with Carlson, Witkoff appeared to struggle to remember the names of the Ukrainian regions. \"Donbas, Crimea. You know the names,\" he told the conservative media personality, who prompted him to say \"Lugansk\" -- the Russian transliteration for Luhansk. \"Lugansk, and there's two others,\" Witkoff replied.\n\nAlthough Putin declared he had annexed the four regions, his troops still do not fully control most of the area. Much of Kherson and Zaporizhzhia, including their regional capitals, remain unoccupied.\n\nA wealthy real estate developer, Witkoff has emerged as the lead negotiator for Trump's effort to end the war, twice now traveling to Moscow, where he has said he spent several hours talking with Putin.\n\nIn his interview on Carlson, Witkoff was effusive in his praise for Putin, calling him a \"very smart guy\" and noting Putin told him he had prayed for Trump after the assassination attempt against him during last year’s presidential campaign. Witkoff added that Putin had given him a portrait of Trump which he says the Russian leader had commissioned from a famous Russian artist.\n\n\"This is the kind of connection that we've been able to reestablish through a simple word called communication, which many people would say I shouldn't have had because Putin is a bad guy. I don't regard Putin as a bad guy,\" Witkoff said.\n\nWitkoff also told Carlson he believed Russia \"does not need to absorb Ukraine,\" saying, \"They've gotten what they want. So why do they need more?\" He also said he \"100%\" believes Russia does not want to invade Europe, saying he took Putin \"at his word\" on that. \n\nWitkoff also repeated an unsupported claim made by Putin that Russian forces have surrounded a significant number of Ukrainian troops in Russia's Kursk region. Although Ukraine was forced to retreat from Kursk earlier this month, no evidence has emerged to suggest many Ukrainian soldiers are encircled, and both independent researchers and Ukrainian officials have said it is false.\n\n\"Witkoff uncritically amplified a number of Russian demands, claims and justifications,\" the Washington D.C.-based Institute for the Study of War (ISW) wrote.\n\nWitkoff's comments could feed deep unease in Europe that the Trump administration, which is moving fast to restore relations with Russia, is more aligned with the Kremlin than NATO allies over the war in Ukraine. European officials and observers have also warned the administration, in its hurry to reach a deal, is vulnerable to manipulation by Putin.\n\nThe White House has argued its reengagement with Russia brings peace closer, but critics point out that the Kremlin has, so far, yet to make any significant concessions. Trump has claimed he isn't \"aligned\" with Putin. \"I'm not aligned with Putin. I'm not aligned with anybody. I'm aligned with the United States of America, and for the good of the world,\" Trump said last month.\n\nVice President JD Vance on Monday defended Witkoff, writing on X he was doing an \"incredible job.\"","summary":"Steve Witkoff, President Donald Trump's special envoy and lead negotiator tasked with ending the war in Ukraine, sat down for an interview with Tucker Carlson.","url":"https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/trump-envoy-witkoff-sparks-outcry-after-backing-kremlin/story?id=120113827","image":"https://i.abcnewsfe.com/a/2187c57a-d250-46df-b74e-252c896b296f/Steve-Witkoff-rt-gmh-250313_1741870866056_hpMain_16x9.jpg?w=1600","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-03-24 23:55:11","author":"Patrick Reevell","authors":["Patrick Reevell"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.474},{"id":303747046,"title":"Trump bemoans a portrait of him – but gets a new one from Putin","text":"US President Donald Trump has been gifted a new portrait from his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin - while trashing an existing painting of him as \"truly the worst\".\n\nThe new portrait has not been shown publicly. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov described it as a \"personal gift\", adding that only Putin himself could disclose further details.\n\nMeanwhile, Trump took to Truth Social to criticise an earlier picture of him that hung in the Colorado State Capitol building until it was removed on Monday.\n\nThe US president has paid close attention to cultivating his image, and made headlines in January by unveiling an official portrait that was variously described by critics as serious or ominous.\n\nTrump's envoy Steve Witkoff confirmed receipt of the new work from Moscow, saying he had been asked to transport it back to Washington.\n\nHe described the work as a painting - a \"beautiful portrait\" by a \"leading Russian artist\" - but gave no further critique. Trump was \"clearly touched by it\", he added.\n\nThe gift was confirmed by Peskov, as American and Russian negotiators again sat down for talks in Saudi Arabia as part of Trump's drive to end the war in Ukraine.\n\nThe gift highlights the diplomatic thaw between the two nations after Trump returned to the White House in January.\n\nIn an interview, Witkoff - who met Putin 10 days ago - said the Russian president had been \"gracious\". Putin told him, he added, that he had prayed for Trump after an assassination attempt against him last year.\n\nThat attempt on Trump's life - which took place during a rally in Pennsylvania - gave rise to perhaps the most iconic image of him ever produced.\n\nAP photographer Evan Vucci caught the moment that Trump, with a bloody ear, held up a defiant fist and told supporters to \"fight, fight, fight\". That image was further mythologised by Trump, who used it to adorn the cover of a book.\n\n'Purposefully distorted'\n\nTrump is yet to publicly comment on the image that was sent by Putin - but he left no doubt of the kind of portraiture he liked and disliked when delivering his views on the Colorado image.\n\nThe painting, which was presented to the building in 2019, was \"purposefully distorted to a level that even I, perhaps, have never seen before\", he wrote on Truth Social on Monday morning.\n\nThat was unlike the same artist's depiction of Barack Obama, Trump wrote. Offering rare praise for his predecessor, Trump said Obama looked \"wonderful\" in his own portrait by the same artist, English-born Sarah Boardman.\n\nTrump reportedly lost up to 30lb (13.6kg) during last year's presidential campaign. He told reporters he had been \"so busy\" he had not \"been able to eat very much\".\n\nThe Republican also used the portrait to make a political point - describing Colorado Governor Jared Polis, a Democrat, as \"radical\" and \"extremely weak on crime\".\n\nBut the portrait had nothing to do with Polis, US media pointed out. It was instead the result of a crowdfunding campaign that was launched by a Republican. The portrait was reportedly commissioned to fill an empty space that had briefly been filled with an image of Vladimir Putin by a prankster.\n\nFollowing the backlash, Colorado House leadership ordered the painting removed on Monday afternoon, according to a spokesman for Colorado's House Democrats. It will be kept in a secure location \"until further notice\".\n\nThe BBC has contacted Ms Boardman for comment. Discussing her work with the Colorado Times Recorder in 2019, she acknowledged that there would \"always be anger at a president from one side or the other. It is human nature.\"\n\nAnother portrait artist told the BBC he \"would have painted things slightly differently\", but that presidential portraits were nuanced, and he had sympathy for the artist.\n\nRobert Anderson, who created the official portrait of President George W Bush which hangs in the US National Portrait Gallery, said viewers tended to bring \"baggage\" depending on their feelings about the painting's subject.\n\nFor that reason, the reaction to an artwork often had \"very little to do with the quality of art\", he said.\n\nOf Trump, Mr Anderson said: \"I think it would be very difficult to paint him because he has a particular impression of himself which might be very different to that of many others – probably at least half of the country.\"\n\nA spokesman for Polis told 9News said the governor was \"surprised to learn the president of the United States is an aficionado of our Colorado State Capitol and its artwork\".\n\nThe statement continued: \"We appreciate the president and everyone's interest in our capitol building and are always looking for any opportunity to improve our visitor experience.\"","summary":"US President Donald Trump has been gifted a new portrait from his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin - while trashing an existing painting of him as \"truly the worst\".","url":"https://www.myjoyonline.com/trump-bemoans-a-portrait-of-him-but-gets-a-new-one-from-putin/","image":"https://www.myjoyonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/image-995.png","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-03-24 23:55:00","author":"Abubakar Ibrahim,Bbc 55pm","authors":["Abubakar Ibrahim","Bbc 55pm"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gh","sentiment":-0.012}]}
