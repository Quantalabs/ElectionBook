Immigration advocates confirmed at least 45 people were arrested without warrants across seven locations, including two Home Depots, a store in the fashion district and a doughnut shop, said Angelica Salas, executive director for the Coalition of Humane Immigrant Rights, or CHIRLA, at an afternoon press conference denouncing the activity.

Federal immigration authorities have been ramping up arrests across the country to fulfil President Donald Trump's promise of mass deportations. Todd Lyons, the head of US Immigration and Customs Enforcement, defended his tactics earlier this week against criticism that authorities are being too heavy-handed. He has said ICE is averaging about 1,600 arrests per day and that the agency has arrested “dangerous criminals.” Protests recently broke out after an immigration action at a restaurant in San Diego and in Minneapolis when federal officials in tactical gear showed up in a Latino neighbourhood for an operation they said was about a criminal case, not immigration.

In Los Angeles, Mayor Karen Bass said the activity was meant to “sow terror.” “As Mayor of a proud city of immigrants, who contribute to our city in so many ways, I am deeply angered by what has taken place. These tactics sow terror in our communities and disrupt basic principles of safety in our city,” Bass said. Salas, of CHIRLA, echoed that language. “Our community is under attack and is being terrorized. These are workers, these are fathers, these are mothers, and this has to stop. Immigration enforcement that is terrorizing our families throughout this country and picking up our people that we love must stop now,” Salas said, surrounded by a crowd holding signs protesting Immigration and Customs Enforcement. ICE declined to discuss the details of its operations. The agency said it routinely makes arrests of noncitizens “who commit crimes and other individuals who have violated our nation's immigration laws,\" said an emailed statement from an unnamed spokesperson. Yasmeen Pitts O'Keefe, a spokesperson for Homeland Security Investigations, a branch of ICE, told the Los Angeles Times that federal agents were executing search warrants related to the harbouring of people illegally in the country. In Los Angeles, videos from bystanders and television news crews captured people being walked across a Home Depot parking lot by federal agents as well as clashes that broke out at other detention sites. KTLA showed aerial footage of agents outside a clothing store in the fashion district leading detainees out of a building and toward two large white vans waiting just outside in a parking lot. The hands of the detained individuals were tied behind their backs. The agents patted them down before loading them into the vans. The agents wore vests with the agency acronyms FBI, ICE and HSI for Homeland Security Investigations. Armed agents used yellow police tape to keep crowds on the street and sidewalk away from the operations. Aerial footage of the same location broadcast by KABC-TV showed officers throwing smoke bombs or flash bangs on the street to disperse the people so they could drive away in SUVs, vans and military-style vehicles. The station showed one person running backward with their hands on the hood of a moving white SUV in an apparent attempt to block the vehicle. The person fell backward, landing flat on the ground. The SUV backed up, drove around the individual and sped off as others on the street threw objects at it. Immigrant-rights advocates used megaphones to speak to the workers, reminding them of their constitutional rights and instructing them not to sign anything or say anything to federal agents, the Los Angeles Times reported. Katia Garcia, 18, left school when she learned her father, 37-year-old Marco Garcia, may have been targeted. Katia Garcia, a U.S. citizen, said her father is undocumented and has been in the U.S. for 20 years. “We never thought this would happen to us,” she told the Los Angeles Times. Eleven of the LA City Council's 15 members issued a statement accusing federal immigration agencies of “an egregious escalation.” “This indiscriminate targeting of children and families not only harms the individuals who are directly impacted, but destroys our communities' sense of trust and safety in their own homes,” the statement said.

The Administration will now have to make its case in the court of law, as it should have all along.'\n\nThe Trump administration initially accepted it had made a mistake in deporting Abrego Garcia, a father-of-three who arrived in the US illegally more than a decade ago. \n\nWhite House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt also championed his return, saying it proved the 'unhinged Democrat Party' was wrong about Abrego Garcia, who liberals had dubbed a 'Maryland father-of-three'.\n\nAbrego Garcia was deported to El Salvador after being accused of being an MS-13 gang member. The deportation went ahead despite a court order forbidding his return which claimed he was at risk of persecution by the gang.\n\nPrior to this he had several brushes with the law in the US over the years, although none resulted in arrest or conviction.\n\nAfter initially ignoring a court order to facilitate his repatriation to the US, Bondi announced that Abrego Garcia has been hauled back to America to face charges stemming from one of these encounters.\n\nA federal grand jury indicted Abrego Garcia over claims he participated in a years- long operation trafficking people through the Texas border.\n\nSources told ABC News that amongst those allegedly transported were members of the infamous Salvadoran gang MS-13.\n\nThe conspiracy is said to have spanned nearly ten years and involved the transportation of thousands of migrants from Mexico and Central America. \n\nHe is expected to be prosecuted and, if convicted, will be returned to his home country at the conclusion of the case, officials said. \n\nThe investigation into the charges started after federal authorities started probing a 2022 traffic stop of Abrego Garcia by the Tennessee Highway Patrol, source said.\n\nHe was stopped with eight people in his car and told officers he was driving them from Texas to Maryland for a construction job. \n\nThe exchange led the officer to, 'suspect this was a human trafficking incident', according to a report produced at the time.\n\nBut Abrego Garcia was let go with out any arrest or charge, despite having an expired license, per the document.\n\nAbrego Garcia was deported in March to El Salvador's CECOT mega-prison after the administration claimed he was a member of MS-13. Something he and his family have denied. \n\nPresident Donald Trump had repeatedly maintained in an interview with ABC's Terry Moran that Abrego Garcia has M-S-1-3 tattooed on his hand.\n\nTrump had posted multiple times showing knuckle tattoos, but Moran told him the actual M-S-1-3 letters and numbers had simply been photoshopped onto the image above Abrego Garcia's actual tattoos as a code to decipher them. \n\nHis deportation saga began when he was pulled over by immigration officers on March 12 and was told his immigration status had changed.\n\nWithin days he was on a plane to El Salvador and his family recognized him in CECOT from media images which showed off distinctive tattoos on his arm.\n\nAbrego Garcia was granted 'withholding of removal' status in 2019 after a judge determined his claims that he would be persecuted if he returned to El Salvador were legitimate.\n\nPresident Trump had said that he could retrieve Abrego Garcia with one phone call to El Salvador's president, but refused to do it.\n\nAbrego Garcia´s American wife sued over his deportation, and U.S. District Judge Paula Xinis ordered his return on April 4. \n\nThe Supreme Court ruled on April 10 that the administration must work to bring him back. \n\nLate last month the administration asked a judge to throw out the lawsuit, arguing the court lacked jurisdiction because he was no longer in the US.\n\nAttorneys for the administration have also argued that information about returning Abrego Garcia is protected under state secrets privilege. \n\nU.S. attorneys said releasing such details in open court - or even to the judge in private - would jeopardize national security by revealing sensitive diplomatic negotiations. Many filings in the case have been sealed. \n\nThe case has raised questions about whether due process was followed and highlighted the extent to which the White House is trying to exert control over the courts to bolster its immigration policy. \n\nIn a statement about his return, Abrego Garcia's attorney Simon Sandoval-Moshenberg said: 'From the beginning, this case has made one thing painfully clear: The government had the power to bring him back at any time. \n\n'Instead, they chose to play games with the court and with a man's life. We're not just fighting for Kilmar - we're fighting to ensure due process rights are protected for everyone. \n\n'Because tomorrow, this could be any one of us -- if we let power go unchecked, if we ignore our Constitution.'\n\nAbrego Garcia's wife has stood by him throughout the saga, despite previously filing a report of domestic abuse against her husband.\n\nThe Salvadoran was never charged over the report which was later retracted.","summary":"Maryland Senator Chris Van Hollen, who infamously met with alleged gang member Kilmar Abrego Garcia in El Salvador, celebrated his return to the United States to face criminal charges.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-14789203/Margarita-Maryland-Senator-gloats-prematurely-return-deported-migrant-charged-sick-child-sex-crimes.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/06/07/01/99128715-0-image-a-8_1749254869036.jpg","video":"https://videos.dailymail.co.uk/video/mol/2025/04/16/1734277532721528733/1024x576_MP4_1734277532721528733.mp4","publish_date":"2025-06-07 01:04:14","author":"Editor,Stephen M.

He imposed tariffs on imported goods from countries considered close allies, including Canada and Mexico – America’s partners in long-standing economic agreements – as well as from Western European nations.The most significant tariffs, however, targeted goods from China, the largest exporter to the US. These tariffs were framed as tools to boost US government revenue, narrow the trade deficit, increase domestic manufacturing, and create jobs.

(credit: Hatem Khaled/Reuters)The result was a profound shock to the global economy, the likes of which had not been seen in recent memory. Uncertainty spread rapidly, investments dried up, and the financial markets – especially in the US – suffered, marked by volatile swings in stocks, bonds, currencies, oil, gold, and other commodities. The American economy slipped into recession during the first quarter of the year. A question now dominates discussions among citizens, analysts, and policy-makers both inside and outside the US: Why did Trump enact such measures, and why did he do so in such unusually blunt, confrontational language, rarely seen in American diplomacy?Some observers attribute this to Trump’s personality – an approach shaped by years in real estate, where asking for the moon is a tactic to secure what one truly wants. Others argue that he is acting strategically, with a small group of conservative Republicans, to pursue clearly defined short- and long-term objectives. Still others warn that Trump and his loyalist faction are seeking to reshape America into a quasi-authoritarian state – one that maintains democratic appearances, such as elections, a legislature, and courts, but is guided by centralized power.The slogan that fueled Trump’s campaign – “Make America Great Again” – continues to guide his administration’s rhetoric and priorities.There is no denying that America remains the world’s dominant superpower. Its economy accounts for roughly a quarter of global GDP, and the dollar serves as the backbone of international financial transactions. Wall Street is the central node of the global financial system. American universities, research institutions, and technological leadership in fields like artificial intelligence remain unrivaled.Militarily, the US has no true peer. It possesses the most advanced offensive and defensive systems, operates around 800 military installations worldwide, and maintains a constant global presence with its fleets of warships and aircraft carriers.Yet despite this, Trump and much of the Republican Party continue to frame their mission as one of restoring lost greatness. Anyone familiar with America four decades ago can attest to the changes it has undergone – shifts that are relative in nature but undeniable. America’s infrastructure, in many areas, has deteriorated compared to both its own past and other nations’ present. Homelessness is on the rise. But perhaps more striking is the cultural shift: a diminishing work ethic and a waning appetite for skilled trades and manual labor.Internationally, the US now faces growing industrial and technological competition from countries once considered peripheral – China, India, Indonesia, Mexico, and Brazil. For now, the challenge remains economic rather than military or political, but it could evolve.The US once contained Japan’s rise in the 1980s, but China and India present a very different scale of threat. The most pressing question is whether Trump can truly reverse these domestic and global tides. Or is the task too vast, too complex, too deeply embedded in broader structural forces?Evidence suggests the latter. Consider, for example, the delicate balance between military spending and civilian investment. A nation cannot endlessly expand its defense budget without undermining infrastructure, education, healthcare, and innovation. Likewise, bringing manufacturing back to American soil would require a robust labor force – particularly in skilled and semiskilled sectors – which the US currently lacks. Labor in America costs roughly twice as much as in many other countries, and as growth accelerates, so will demand and, with it, wages.The logical solution is to increase immigration, but not from the European sources some conservatives idealize. In reality, the labor will have to come from Latin America, Africa, and Asia – regions that Trump’s base is often vocally hostile toward. Immigration policy, therefore, stands at the heart of the contradiction.If domestic opposition to Trump’s agenda gains traction, it could erode the coalition that brought him to power. His political alliance, which includes Evangelical Christians, hardline nationalists, and economic conservatives, is already strained. Take energy, for example: Trump promises to cut gas prices by 40% while simultaneously ramping up domestic production, including from costly oil and gas sources – two goals at odds with each other.Still, Trump has shown a knack for pragmatism and political agility. We saw this in his handling of China trade policy, where he pivoted multiple times to secure perceived wins. May brought several achievements he could claim – domestically, a reduction in drug prices, a critical issue for many Americans; internationally, preliminary efforts to end the Russia-Ukraine conflict. His trip to Saudi Arabia and the Gulf states, along with the agreements signed, further elevated his status at home and abroad.Yet from what I observed of America’s infrastructure during my visit, it seems unlikely the country can regain its former domestic stature – at least not without sacrificing part of its expansive military footprint. Trying to rewind the clock on multiple fronts at once is an almost impossible endeavor. – Ibrahim Abdulaziz Al-MuhannaGaza is gasping Its final breathsAl-Masry Al-Youm, Egypt, May 30The situation in Gaza and the condition of its people have descended into the unimaginable. Destruction blankets the landscape; the dead, wounded, starving, and dehydrated are everywhere, while the political world looks on in silence and the humanitarian world cries out in anguish alongside those trapped in this catastrophe.The Israeli occupation forces continue their campaign of devastation with impunity, unfazed by the growing chorus of condemnation from within Israeli society and from Jewish communities around the world which reject these violations of human rights.As the Israeli military escalates its assault on Gaza, more than 100,000 Palestinians have been forcibly displaced into central Gaza City, fleeing the bombardment in the northern parts of the strip. Once the cultural and economic heart of Palestinian life, Gaza City has been reduced to a chaotic sprawl of rubble and makeshift tents, where people now live without access to even the most basic necessities, surrounded by mountains of debris and despair.In the midst of cries of hunger, thirst, and sickness, the specter of death looms over tens of thousands – especially children – as Israel’s relentless bombing campaign continues unabated. In recent days alone, more than 1,000 Palestinians, the majority of them women and children, have been killed by airstrikes and artillery barrages. The overall death toll, not counting the thousands still buried beneath the rubble, now exceeds 53,000 in what has become a 20-month campaign of extermination.Reports from non-Arab media outlets have documented harrowing scenes of this ongoing tragedy, as Israel’s intensified aggression has coincided with an ongoing blockade of desperately needed humanitarian aid. According to these accounts, every street is crowded with displaced people living among garbage heaps and pools of sewage, swarming with flies and mosquitoes.There is no clean water. No food. Nothing. Hunger gnaws at the population, and still, no meaningful assistance is reaching them. UN experts had long warned of an imminent famine engulfing the entire Gaza Strip, with UN food warehouses nearly depleted. Despite the dire circumstances, humanitarian organizations have managed to keep some community kitchens running, producing around 300,000 meals a day. Under mounting international pressure, Israel has recently permitted limited aid to trickle into Gaza following a total blockade imposed in March. But the United Nations continues to report that Israel is obstructing the entry of aid and that airstrikes persist even as supplies are being distributed. In the words of Secretary-General António Guterres, what has entered Gaza so far is “only a teaspoon,” when what is needed is a deluge.The suffering is especially acute for the sick and wounded, with most hospitals in northern Gaza bombed out of operation, and the few remaining ones overwhelmed and unable to cope.This cannot be described as war; it is, by every measure, a genocide of civilians, carried out under the justification that Hamas is embedded among the population.Gaza is gasping its final breaths, and its people – joined by those of us who stand in solidarity – are left to say what the world’s silence has made clear: “No one cares if we all die. This is a world built on deception and hypocrisy, one that calls itself civilized and humane but chooses to see with only one eye.”– The Rev. Rafic Greiche, head, Egyptian Coptic Church press officeIsrael: A conflict between politicians and military personnelAl-Ittihad, UAE, May 31Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s decision to appoint Maj.-Gen. David Zini as the new head of the Shin Bet (Israel Security Agency), in direct defiance of the state-attorney’s ruling barring him from the role, signals a looming confrontation between Israel’s political-military establishment and its judiciary.This marks a new escalation in the ongoing power struggle among Israel’s key institutions – revolving around Netanyahu himself, who seeks to consolidate power and impose a singular national direction under his leadership.The clash between the judiciary, the government, and Netanyahu remains unresolved, largely due to the prime minister’s combative style and long-standing expertise in maneuvering around institutional restraints, blocking legislation that might limit his authority, and reshuffling priorities within his own cabinet.In response, ministers loyal to Netanyahu have adopted a clear, unified stance to neutralize any effort by the attorney-general to intervene – not only in matters of military appointments, particularly in the intelligence services, but also in the broader push by Netanyahu to politicize the judiciary.The prime minister has now escalated the confrontation to the military level, where he has already managed to suppress dissent within the defense establishment. Those who oppose his directives are either removed or pushed to resign, forcing key figures in the military to capitulate. This capitulation, however, has stirred significant unease among senior Israeli commanders, many of whom have aligned with broader protest and resistance movements in society, reinforcing speculation that the political and military balance of power may soon shift.At the center of this turmoil is Gaza – its devastation, and how the war might end. Former military officials warn that Netanyahu’s style of governance is not only unsustainable but dangerously destabilizing and could drive Israel toward catastrophe. Against this backdrop, the notion of ousting Netanyahu or reshaping the government has become increasingly central, particularly with parliamentary elections approaching.Netanyahu, however, sees this as an opportunity to intensify his efforts, projecting strength to demonstrate his control over Israel’s direction. He argues that his trial should not proceed amid such volatility and maintains that unresolved security and political decisions – many of which remain flash points of disagreement – should be handled exclusively under his authority.Netanyahu is working to block alternative strategies from emerging at both the political and security levels, having successfully positioned himself as the indispensable figure in Israeli governance. He refuses to compromise his methods or present a conciliatory vision, claiming unapologetically that he alone is fit to lead.Meanwhile, President Isaac Herzog has failed to offer meaningful guidance or foster consensus for a national dialogue, underscoring the depth of Israel’s internal divisions.These tensions are unlikely to ease before the elections, especially as Netanyahu cements his hold over the current ruling coalition. After capitulating to nearly all demands from Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich and National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir, Netanyahu has ensured the coalition’s continued stability.The opposition, led by Yair Lapid, remains fragmented and weak, lacking a unified platform. Neither Lapid nor Benny Gantz, both contenders for leadership, currently enjoys significant public support. Netanyahu continues to outmaneuver them all, sidelining rivals and consolidating control.For now, no credible challenge has emerged to his war management, even though deep questions persist over Israel’s long-term objectives in Gaza.Military operations will soon give way to a more politically sensitive phase: who will govern Gaza, how Hamas will be dismantled, and what political or security framework Israel intends to impose. These unresolved issues have exposed friction within the IDF general staff over priorities and roles, fueling a sustained but quiet power struggle between the military and political echelons.Until these matters are clarified, Netanyahu remains the primary political beneficiary, with opinion polls continuing to favor him.One development that should not be overlooked is the US administration’s recent reengagement with Israel’s domestic political scene.Washington has begun establishing lines of communication not only with former prime minister Naftali Bennett but also with Lapid and Gantz, signaling a readiness to reassess its options should a coalition realignment become necessary.Netanyahu is acutely aware of these moves and remains determined to maintain a firm grip on power, adapting his tactics while working relentlessly to bring all internal factions under his control. – Tarek FahmyHas the world come to terms with the Gaza genocide?Al-Watan, Saudi Arabia, May 27The world is seething – angry, enraged, oppressed, provoked, and helpless – in the face of the horrors unfolding in the Gaza Strip. And yet, it seems resigned to a fate authored by the minds of brutal extremists and enabled by the Israeli war machine.Resigned, perhaps, because the US and other Western powers have not objected to Israel’s warfare. This warfare uses advanced weaponry, deep-penetration bombs, and artificial intelligence not to fight terrorism, but to uproot Palestinians from their homes, level Gaza’s buildings, hospitals, schools, and mosques, reduce its heritage to rubble, and erase any trace of its people’s history, presence, or rights to the land.Nearly 20 months into the war, Israel articulates its objectives openly and carries them out with daily massacres – many targeting women and children. On Saturday, May 24, pediatrician Alaa Al-Najjar arrived at work at the Nasser Medical Complex in Khan Yunis. Minutes later, the bodies of nine of her children were delivered to the same facility, killed by an Israeli missile. Her husband and 10th child were injured. This is but one example of how entire families have been erased.Nearly two million Gazans are now corralled into a tiny enclave in the Strip’s southwest corner – effectively a concentration camp – before being killed or deported. Israeli officials do not shy away from invoking the term “Final Solution,” echoing the Nazi terminology once used to exterminate Jews. It is no longer a secret: The plan is to annihilate the people of Gaza, to erase it from the map of Palestine.Major world powers have failed to act despite mounting evidence of a campaign that bears the hallmarks of genocide – signs they refuse to acknowledge even now.Washington and its allies have endorsed Israel’s “right to self-defense,” armed it with the world’s deadliest weapons, and watched them rain down on civilians under the familiar justification that Hamas and other militants were hiding among the population.These same allies have shielded Israel at the UN Security Council and the International Court of Justice. When South Africa brought a genocide case against Israel, the US responded with hostility. President Donald Trump even orchestrated a smear campaign against South African President Cyril Ramaphosa, promoting a doctored video that falsely accused South Africa of committing atrocities against white farmers. When the footage was later traced to the Congo, the White House offered no correction, let alone an apology. What mattered was silencing the South African leader – truth be damned.Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his inner circle ran circles around the previous American administration, exploiting its loyalty and sabotaging every proposal for postwar planning. Israel could not imagine an end to this war, with Gazans still inhabiting Gaza. Days into his presidency, Trump eagerly adopted a plan to displace Gaza’s population, hailing it as a natural outcome of Israel’s gains. Though he tempered his rhetoric after pushback from Arab allies, he never truly let the idea go.To bolster Trump’s real estate vision for Gaza, Israeli forces are now methodically demolishing every standing structure. In his latest statements, Netanyahu emphasized his intention to continue controlling the entire Strip “until the displacement of its residents in accordance with Trump’s plan,” which, in truth, is wholly Israeli in origin.Netanyahu has also dismissed European criticism with characteristic disdain – criticism over both military conduct and Israel’s blockade of humanitarian aid as famine begins to claim children and the elderly.While Germany continues to support Israel unflinchingly, other allies – Britain, France, Canada, and to a lesser extent Belgium – have begun to break their silence. London suspended trade talks and sanctioned settler-linked individuals. Paris called for revisiting the EU-Israel partnership, and all three floated recognition of a Palestinian state. But while these gestures mark a rhetorical shift, they fall far short of halting military support, and thus remain toothless in the face of a bloodthirsty war machine.After two Israeli Embassy staffers were killed in Washington, DC, by a man shouting “Free Palestine,” Israel’s propaganda apparatus seized the moment, accusing Europe of fueling antisemitism. Netanyahu equated the phrase “Free Palestine” with the Nazi chant “Heil Hitler.”Despite reports of friction between Netanyahu and Trump, and rumors of US pressure to secure a ceasefire and prisoner deal, the Israeli delegation walked away from Doha negotiations with nothing to show. No sign of American pressure followed. Instead, after a Trump-Netanyahu phone call, the Prime Minister’s Office reported that the US president reaffirmed his support for “securing the release of all hostages and the elimination of Hamas” – a clear signal that he rejected European objections and was doing nothing to restrain Israel. – Abdulwahab BadrakhanTranslated by Asaf Zilberfarb.

Subscribe to our YouTube channel to see more of his videos.\n\nThe Trump budget is making its way through the Senate. And people on both sides of the issue of fiscal sobriety are arguing because the Biden deficit, which is somewhere between $1.9 trillion and $2.1 trillion, doesn’t seem to be radically reduced, given the DOGE cuts are offset by not cutting other programs that came in under Biden.\n\nThe Build Back Better and New Green Deal—all of that stuff is not radically cut. And more importantly, there are some tax cuts—things like taxes on tips, the SALT state tax deductions—that suggest that either there won’t be this sizable budget deficit reduction, as promised by the Trump administration, or it won’t occur until later on, or it could get bigger.\n\nBut there is a wild card here. And consider that in March through April, all the way into May, we had some monthly data. And income—real income—is substantially up. So is the savings rate. Energy prices are down. The inflation rate came in at April at 2.1%. The economy, according to the Federal Reserve Bank in Atlanta, will not grow at 3.8%, but it could, they think, at an annualized rate of 4.6%.\n\nThat’s critical, because in a $33 billion-plus economy, if you get two or three points of additional economic growth, then obviously, you’re going to have more federal revenue. It could be $200 or $300 billion more.\n\nAlso, people discounted the Trump tariffs. They said, either one of two things would happen. They would either, and believe it or not, they said the trade deficit might increase because of retaliatory tariffs that would increase faster than ours or decrease trade. But we might be in a recession.\n\nAnd yet, when you look at the April data, the $160 billion monthly trade deficit has been halved. It’s incredible. It’s almost like the story on the border: That we went from 10,000 people a day to virtually nobody.\n\nSo, what does all this mean? We saw these gyrations in the stock market. We read The Wall Street Journal every day: recession, slow growth, market uncertainty, trade wars, recession, but if you actually look at the data, two things pop out at you.\n\nThe economy is doing very, very well. And a lot of it is the expectation of the things that are in process. The $10 trillion of foreign investment. The extensions of the tax cuts. Incentives for investment in the new budget. And so, this is completely unknown territory. If Donald Trump were to get—as Ronald Reagan did in the first half of 1984, he got up to an annualized rate of 7%. Especially in the latter part. If he were to get 4.6% or 5%, then this mythical idea that we all discounted, that you can grow your way out of deficits, it wouldn’t quite be realized but it would really help. And that $1.9 to $2.1 trillion deficit could go down substantially.\n\nAll of us never believed supply side will solve the problem. It won’t solve the problem without physical cuts and discipline. But it will do a lot for the economy.\n\nAnd this is emblematic of this first mysterious four months of Donald Trump, when people said that Donald Trump could shut the border down, nobody believed him.\n\nWhen people said that he could deal with the universities, and then Harvard had a lot of exposure, violating the Supreme Court’s rulings, not reporting Chinese and Middle East money, overcharging the government. And yet, all of this exposure that’s happening on the campus is enlightening the American people about issues they didn’t think was possible, just in the first 120 or 130 days of this administration.\n\nSo, what’s the bottom line? What am I getting at? There are revolutionary—maybe counter-revolutionary—developments going on at the border, going on with the universities. But especially with the economy. It’s being rebooted. It’s being redirected in ways that economists are not even able to figure out because we haven’t done this before. And the net result might be that we’re going to make progress, both in the expansion of the economy and through growth in federal revenues and cut down these deficits.\n\nWe publish a variety of perspectives.

U.S. District Judge Richard Leon had previously agreed to temporarily block the Republican administration, saying that plaintiffs were likely to show that Trump doesn't have the legal authority to unilaterally shutter the Institute of Museum and Library Services, which was created by Congress.

The institute has roughly 75 employees and issued more than $266 million in grants last year. However, a Rhode Island judge's order prohibiting the government from shutting down the museum and library services institute in a separate case brought by several states remains in place.

A federal appeals court refused to put the order on hold while the administration appealed.\n\nThe judge wrote that the layoffs \"will likely cripple the department.\"\n\nBut Solicitor General D. John Sauer wrote on Friday that Joun was substituting his policy preferences for those of the Trump administration.\n\nThe layoffs help put in the place the \"policy of streamlining the department and eliminating discretionary functions that, in the administration's view, are better left to the states,\" Sauer wrote.\n\nHe also pointed out that the Supreme Court in April voted 5-4 to block Joun's earlier order seeking to keep in place Education Department teacher-training grants.\n\nThe current case involves two consolidated lawsuits that said Trump's plan amounted to an illegal closure of the Education Department.\n\nOne suit was filed by the Somerville and Easthampton school districts in Massachusetts along with the American Federation of Teachers and other education groups. The other suit was filed by a coalition of 21 Democratic attorneys general.\n\nThe suits argued that layoffs left the department unable to carry out responsibilities required by Congress, including duties to support special education, distribute financial aid and enforce civil rights laws.\n\nEducation Department employees who were targeted by the layoffs have been on paid leave since March, according to a union that represents some of the agency's staff. Joun's order prevents the department from fully terminating them, but none have been allowed to return to work, according to the American Federation of Government Employees Local 252. Without Joun's order, the workers were scheduled to be terminated Monday.\n\nTrump has made it a priority to shut down the Education Department, though he has acknowledged that only Congress has the authority to do that. In the meantime, Trump issued a March order directing Education Secretary Linda McMahon to wind it down \"to the maximum extent appropriate and permitted by law.\"\n\nTrump later said the department's functions will be parceled to other agencies, suggesting that federal student loans should be managed by the Small Business Administration and programs involving students with disabilities would be absorbed by the Department of Health and Human Services. Those changes have not yet happened.\n\nThe president argues that the Education Department has been overtaken by liberals and has failed to spur improvements to the nation's lagging academic scores. He has promised to \"return education to the states.\"\n\nOpponents note that K-12 education is already mostly overseen by states and cities.\n\nDemocrats have blasted the Trump administration's Education Department budget, which seeks a 15% budget cut including a $4.5 billion cut in K-12 funding as part of the agency's downsizing.\n\nAssociated Press writer Collin Binkley contributed to this report.","summary":"President Donald Trump's administration on Friday asked the Supreme Court to pause a court order to reinstate Education Department employees who were fired in mass layoffs.","url":"https://abc7.com/post/president-donald-trump-administration-asks-supreme-court-leave-mass-layoffs-us-department-education-place/16681057/","image":"https://cdn.abcotvs.com/dip/images/16681074_060625-wls-trump-doe-layoffs-4pvo-vid.jpg?w=1600","video":"https://vcl.abcotv.net/video/wls/060625-wls-trump-doe-layoffs-4pvo-vid.mp4","publish_date":"2025-06-07 00:43:38","author":"Mark Sherman","authors":["Mark Sherman"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.357},{"id":328931640,"title":"Mass deportations from Trump’s Big, Beautiful Bill could quietly cost U.S. over $1.4 trillion","text":"Mass deportations enabled by the Trump administration’s Big, Beautiful Bill spending and tax package could cost the U.S. over $1 trillion in the coming years, as the administration is already reportedly struggling to fund its rapidly expanding immigration crackdown. \n\nThe package, which the House of Representatives passed last month, directs $168 billion towards immigration and border law enforcement agencies. \n\nThat spending, combined with the economic impact of removing scores of immigrants and more granular changes, like a potential decline in revenues thanks to the possible deterrent effect of new fees on migrants, could cost the U.S. over $1.4 trillion over the next decade, according to an analysis from the libertarian Cato Institute. \n\nDavid Bier, director of immigration studies at the Institute, argued on X on Friday that the bill is an “absolute explosion of cash unparalleled in American history,” spending that could be better used on other public safety investments.\n\n“The fiscal cost of mass deportation will equal the cost of all federal law enforcement spending over the next decade,” Bier wrote. “Imagine how many rapes, murders, thefts, etc. could be solved with this money.

It all depends on Trump’s appetite for revenge and how the dispute unfolds.\n\nElon Musk and Donald Trump have had a nasty falling out. (AP)\n\nTelemetry Insight auto analyst Sam Abuelsamid joked, “Considering Trump has no track record of retaliating against those he perceives as adversaries, he’ll likely just overlook this situation.”\n\nTurning serious, he sees trouble ahead for Musk.\n\n“Despite frequently criticizing government subsidies, all of Elon’s ventures significantly rely on government support, which leaves him exposed.”\n\nTrump and the US federal government also stand to lose from a long-running dispute, but not as much as Musk.\n\nThe dispute comes just a week before a planned test of Tesla’s driverless taxis in Austin, Texas, a major event for the company because sales of its EVs are lagging in many markets, and Musk needs a win.\n\nTrump can mess things up for Tesla by encouraging federal safety regulators to step in at any sign of trouble for the robotaxis.\n\nEven before the war of words broke out on Thursday, the National Highway Transportation Safety Administration requested data on how Musk’s driverless, autonomous taxis will perform in low-visibility conditions. That request follows an investigation last year into 2.4 million Teslas equipped with full self-driving software after several accidents, including one that killed a pedestrian.\n\nA spokesman for NHTSA said the probe was ongoing and that the agency “will take any necessary actions to protect road safety.”\n\nThe Department of Justice has also probed the safety of Tesla cars, but the status of that investigation is unclear. The DOJ did not respond immediately to requests for comment.\n\nThe promise of a self-driving future led by Tesla inspired shareholders to boost the stock by 50 per cent in the weeks after Musk confirmed the Austin rollout. But on Thursday, the stock plunged more than 14 per cent amid the Trump-Musk standoff. On Friday, it recovered a bit, bouncing back nearly 4 per cent.\n\n“Tesla’s recent rise was almost entirely driven by robotaxi enthusiasm,” said Morningstar analyst Seth Goldstein. “Elon’s feud with Trump could be a negative.”\n\nDonald Trump has been trading barbs with Elon Musk. (AP)\n\nOne often-overlooked but important part of Tesla’s business that could take a hit is its sales of carbon credits.\n\nAs Musk and Trump were slugging it out Thursday, Republican politicians inserted new language into Trump’s budget bill that would eliminate fines for gas-powered cars that fall short of fuel economy standards. Tesla has a thriving side business selling “regulatory credits” to other automakers to make up for their shortfalls.\n\nMusk has downplayed the importance of the credits business, but the changes would hurt Tesla as it reels from boycotts of its cars tied to Musk’s time working for Trump.\n\nCredit sales jumped by a third to A$892.5 million in the first three months of the year even as total revenue slumped.\n\nMusk’s foray into right-wing politics cost Tesla sales among the environmentally minded consumers who embraced electric cars and led to boycotts of Tesla showrooms.\n\nIf Musk has indeed ended his close association with Trump, those buyers could come back, but that’s far from certain.\n\nMeanwhile, one analyst speculated earlier this year that Trump voters in so-called red counties could buy Teslas “in a meaningful way.” But he’s now less hopeful.\n\n“There are more questions than answers following Thursday developments,” TD Cowen’s Itay Michaeli wrote in his latest report, “and it’s still too early to determine any lasting impacts.”\n\nMichaeli’s stock target for Tesla earlier this year was A$582. He has since lowered it to A$495. Tesla was trading Friday at A$450.\n\nTesla did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nTesla Cybertrucks are displayed at the AutoMobility LA Auto Show. (AP)\n\nTrump said Thursday that he could cut government contracts to Musk’s rocket company, SpaceX, a massive threat to a company that has received billions of federal dollars.\n\nThe privately held company that is reportedly worth A$525 billion provides launches, sends astronauts into space for NASA and has a contract to send a team from the space agency to the moon next year.Â \n\nBut if Musk has a lot to lose, so does the US.\n\nSpaceX is the only US company capable of transporting crews to and from the space station, using its four-person Dragon capsules. The other alternative is politically dicey: depending wholly on Russia’s Soyuz capsules.\n\nMusk knew all this when he shot back at Trump that SpaceX would begin decommissioning its Dragon spacecraft. But it is unclear how serious his threat was. Several hours later â in a reply to another X user â he said he wouldn’t do it.\n\nA subsidiary of SpaceX, the satellite internet company Starlink, appears to also have benefited from Musk’s once-close relationship with the president.\n\nMusk announced that Saudi Arabia had approved Starlink for some services during a trip with Trump in the Middle East last month. The company has also won a string of other recent deals in Bangladesh, Pakistan, India and elsewhere as Trump has threatened tariffs.\n\nElon Musk accused Donald Trump of being in the Epstein files. (AP)\n\nIt’s not clear how much politics played a role, and how much is pure business.\n\nOn Friday, The Associated Press confirmed that India had approved a key license to Starlink. At least 40 per cent of India’s more than 1.4 billion people have no access to the internet.\n\nBig advertisers that fled X after Musk welcomed all manner of conspiracy theories to the social media platform have started to trickle back in recent months, possibly out of fear of a conservative backlash.\n\nMusk has called their decision to leave an “illegal boycott” and sued them, and the Trump administration recently weighed in with a Federal Trade Commission probe into possible coordination among them.\n\nNow advertisers may have to worry about a different danger.\n\nIf Trump sours on X, “there’s a risk that it could again become politically radioactive for major brands,” said Sarah Kreps, a political scientist at Cornell University.

It all depends on Trump’s appetite for revenge and how the dispute unfolds.\n\nJoked Telemetry Insight auto analyst Sam Abuelsamid, “Since Trump has no history of retaliating against perceived adversaries, he’ll probably just let this pass.”\n\nTurning serious, he sees trouble ahead for Musk.\n\n“For someone that rants so much about government pork, all of Elon’s businesses are extremely dependent on government largesse, which makes him vulnerable.”\n\nTrump and the federal government also stand to lose from a long-running dispute, but not as much as Musk.\n\nTesla robotaxis\n\nThe dispute comes just a week before a planned test of Tesla’s driverless taxis in Austin, Texas, a major event for the company because sales of its EVs are lagging in many markets, and Musk needs a win.\n\nTrump can mess things up for Tesla by encouraging federal safety regulators to step in at any sign of trouble for the robotaxis.\n\nEven before the war of words broke out on Thursday, the National Highway Transportation Safety Administration requested data on how Musk’s driverless, autonomous taxis will perform in low-visibility conditions. That request follows an investigation last year into 2.4 million Teslas equipped with full self-driving software after several accidents, including one that killed a pedestrian.\n\nA spokesman for NHTSA said the probe was ongoing and that the agency \"will take any necessary actions to protect road safety.”\n\nThe Department of Justice has also probed the safety of Tesla cars, but the status of that investigation is unclear. The DOJ did not respond immediately to requests for comment.\n\nThe promise of a self-driving future led by Tesla inspired shareholders to boost the stock by 50% in the weeks after Musk confirmed the Austin rollout. But on Thursday, the stock plunged more than 14% amid the Trump-Musk standoff. On Friday, it recovered a bit, bouncing back nearly 4%.\n\n“Tesla’s recent rise was almost entirely driven by robotaxi enthusiasm,\" said Morningstar analyst Seth Goldstein. “Elon’s feud with Trump could be a negative.”\n\nCarbon credits business\n\nOne often-overlooked but important part of Tesla’s business that could take a hit is its sales of carbon credits.\n\nAs Musk and Trump were slugging it out Thursday, Republican senators inserted new language into Trump’s budget bill that would eliminate fines for gas-powered cars that fall short of fuel economy standards. Tesla has a thriving side business selling “regulatory credits” to other automakers to make up for their shortfalls.\n\nMusk has downplayed the importance of the credits business, but the changes would hurt Tesla as it reels from boycotts of its cars tied to Musk’s time working for Trump.\n\nCredit sales jumped by a third to $595 million in the first three months of the year even as total revenue slumped.\n\nReviving sales\n\nMusk’s foray into right-wing politics cost Tesla sales among the environmentally minded consumers who embraced electric cars and led to boycotts of Tesla showrooms.\n\nIf Musk has indeed ended his close association with Trump, those buyers could come back, but that’s far from certain.\n\nMeanwhile, one analyst speculated earlier this year that Trump voters in so-called red counties could buy Teslas “in a meaningful way.” But he’s now less hopeful.\n\n“There are more questions than answers following Thursday developments,” TD Cowen’s Itay Michaeli wrote in his latest report, “and it’s still too early to determine any lasting impacts.”\n\nMichaeli’s stock target for Tesla earlier this year was $388. He has since lowered it to $330. Tesla was trading Friday at $300.\n\nTesla did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nMoonshot mess\n\nTrump said Thursday that he could cut government contracts to Musk’s rocket company, SpaceX, a massive threat to a company that has received billions of federal dollars.\n\nThe privately held company that is reportedly worth $350 billion provides launches, sends astronauts into space for NASA and has a contract to send a team from the space agency to the moon next year.\n\nBut if Musk has a lot to lose, so does the U.S.\n\nSpaceX is the only U.S. company capable of transporting crews to and from the space station, using its four-person Dragon capsules. The other alternative is politically dicey: depending wholly on Russia's Soyuz capsules.\n\nMusk knew all this when he shot back at Trump that SpaceX would begin decommissioning its Dragon spacecraft. But it is unclear how serious his threat was. Several hours later — in a reply to another X user — he said he wouldn’t do it.\n\nStarlink impact?\n\nA subsidiary of SpaceX, the satellite internet company Starlink, appears to also have benefited from Musk’s once-close relationship with the president.\n\nMusk announced that Saudi Arabia had approved Starlink for some services during a trip with Trump in the Middle East last month. The company has also won a string of other recent deals in Bangladesh, Pakistan, India and elsewhere as Trump has threatened tariffs.\n\nIt’s not clear how much politics played a role, and how much is pure business.\n\nOn Friday, The Associated Press confirmed that India had approved a key license to Starlink. At least 40% of India’s more than 1.4 billion people have no access to the internet.\n\nAd revival interrupted?\n\nBig advertisers that fled X after Musk welcomed all manner of conspiracy theories to the social media platform have started to trickle back in recent months, possibly out of fear of a conservative backlash.\n\nMusk has called their decision to leave an “illegal boycott” and sued them, and the Trump administration recently weighed in with a Federal Trade Commission probe into possible coordination among them.\n\nNow advertisers may have to worry about a different danger.\n\nIf Trump sours on X, \"there’s a risk that it could again become politically radioactive for major brands,” said Sarah Kreps, a political scientist at Cornell University. She added, though, that an “exodus isn’t obvious, and it would depend heavily on how the conflict escalates, how long it lasts and how it ends.”","summary":"The world&rsquo;s richest man could lose billions in his fight with world&rsquo;s most powerful politician.\n\nThe feud between Elon Musk and Donald Trump could mean Tesla&rsquo;s plans for self-driving cars hit a roadblock, SpaceX flies fewer missions for NASA, Starlink gets fewer overseas satellit...","url":"https://www.castanet.net/news/Business/554879/Musk-could-lose-billions-of-dollars-depending-on-how-spat-with-Trump-unfolds","image":"https://www.castanet.net/content/2025/6/d0d23db3f741ce49b4f00857d72df0c9714bf1719a0cc5234446f87e9feb6b1b_p4211429.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-06-07 00:34:00","author":"Bernard Condon","authors":["Bernard Condon"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"ca","sentiment":-0.126},{"id":328929906,"title":"Prez-pardon problems go far beyond Joe Biden’s fishy signatures","text":"Autopen abuse is only the latest wrinkle in the now decades-old problems surrounding the presidential pardon power. \n\nThe Justice Department is now looking into whether President Joe Biden was sufficiently competent when he issued a handful of pardons in his final days in office; some even suggest that misuse of the infamous autopen allowed for others to slip through clemencies without involving Joe at all. \n\nBiden in all “signed” over 4,000 pardons of some kind, many of them utterly rancid: from hundreds of commutations for vile bribe-takers, con artists and other sleazoids to letting literal child murderers dodge the death penalty.\n\nWhat if anything did the president know about what “he” was doing?\n\nNo one doubts he chose to pardon son Hunter, and in fact all signs are that he truly signed that one himself; and he likely also intended to hand those get-out-jail-free cards to other family: siblings and in-laws James and his wife, Sara; his sister, Valerie, and her husband, John Owens; and his brother Francis — even if those got the autopen treatment.\n\nBut did he really opt to issue preemptive pardons to Dr. Anthony Fauci and Gen. Mark Milley? \n\nIndeed, it’s not actually clear that the constitutional power extends to such “blank check” clemencies, rather than the traditional pardons for specific crimes or at least specific actions not yet charged. \n\nOn the autopen front, House Oversight Committee Chairman James Comer is forcing the “politboro,” the inner circle of advisers who ran the White House as Joe slipped ever further, to testify under oath about decision-making in the final months, at least. \n\nAll this is separate from kosher-but-outrageous pardons, such as President Bill Clinton shameless clemencies, with hours left in his presidency, for his former business partner Susan McDougal, who was charged with contempt of court after refusing to testify against him, and for Marc Rich, an international fugitive whose wife had donated handsomely to the Clinton campaign and the Clinton Presidential Library. \n\nThat sleeze-fest was so notorious it was labeled “Pardongate.”\n\nAnd, yes, some of President Donald Trump’s pardons are controversial, too, including the blanket forgiveness of all Jan. 6 Capitol Riot offenses. \n\nWhich points to why probing the Biden pardons really should be bipartisan: Whichever party holds the White House when a power is first abused, the other party will get a chance to catch up — and the rule of law deteriorates that much more. \n\nIf the Biden crew crossed any constitutional lines, the public needs to know so the practice can be quashed before it becomes a trend.","summary":"The probes into whether the Biden White House misused autopen are more than warranted, but the problem with President Joe Biden's last-minute pardons goes far beyond whether they were actually signed by him.","url":"https://nypost.com/2025/06/06/opinion/probe-joe-bidens-fishy-signatures-but-dont-ignore-pardon-abuse-trend/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/06/DMDMDE.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-06-07 00:29:25","author":"Post Editorial Board","authors":["Post Editorial Board"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.125},{"id":328927722,"title":"ANDREW NEIL: Like a clown running into a minefield, Musk threw caution to the wind, but he's right - Trump's 'big beautiful bill' IS a 'disgusting abomination'","text":"Well, that didn’t take long. When I boarded a flight for New York on Thursday, Donald Trump and Elon Musk were still sticking to the script: though the dizzy days of their bromance might be over, the separation was amicable.\n\nThe most powerful man in the world and the richest even staged a chummy farewell in the Oval Office last week to underline the point. Yet by the time I’d landed at JFK just over seven hours later, Washington’s version of Krakatoa had erupted.\n\nRight from the start of the Trump-Musk love-in I predicted it would end in tears, much to the chagrin of the President’s cult, which rounded on me with its default social media smear: ‘Trump derangement syndrome’.\n\nBut there was no way these two men with narcissistic egos the size of Saturn and their very own destructive pathologies would stay best mates for long. So it has proved. But even I didn’t foresee the speed and ferocity with which it would all unravel.\n\nThursday started routinely enough. Trump sat down around noon in the Oval Office with Germany’s new Chancellor, Friedrich Merz, in front of the assembled Washington Press corps to discuss trade, defence spending, Ukraine.\n\nBut within minutes, after a reporter asked the President about Musk’s attack on Trump’s signature legislation – his ‘big, beautiful bill’ to roll over existing tax cuts, add new ones and increase spending on the military and border security – hostilities broke out with a vengeance.\n\nThis was Merz’s lucky day. Instead of the German Chancellor getting the Oval Office hair-dryer treatment (as inflicted on the presidents of Ukraine and South Africa during their sit-downs), all Trump’s bile was reserved for Musk. Merz had the sense to stay schtum, relieved to be a mere spectator, albeit with a ringside seat.\n\n‘I’ve always liked Elon,’ said Trump, unconvincingly. ‘Elon and I had a great relationship. I don’t know if we will any more,’ he added, before saying he would have won last November without Musk’s help and that the multi-billionaire was miffed because the ‘big, beautiful bill’ ended various green subsidies on which some of Musk’s businesses had thrived.\n\nTalk about ‘light blue touch paper and retire’, as they advise on all good fireworks.\n\nIn a series of rapid machine-gun posts on X (formerly known as Twitter, which he owns), Musk threw caution to the wind, like a clown running into a minefield.\n\nHe wanted Trump impeached, claimed his tariffs would induce a recession, insisted Trump would not have been elected but for his support, threatened to dismantle a vital piece of space equipment on which the US government depends and, just for good measure, alleged that Trump’s name was on key documents related to convicted sex-trafficker Jeffrey Epstein, which is why they have not been published.\n\nBy Thursday night, as I was landing in New York, Trump was toying with cutting off government contracts to Musk’s companies and had gone to Trump Defcon One (full caps mode on his social media platform, Truth Social), saying Musk was ‘CRAZY’ and suffering from ‘Trump derangement syndrome’ (I guess I’m in good company – or not). Yesterday aides of both men tried to de-escalate the situation. I suspect there’s more chance of peace in Ukraine.\n\nThis very public spat has been devoured by folks in America and beyond as a welcome source of entertainment in grim times. I understand stocks of popcorn are already running low in some US supermarkets.\n\nBut the high-powered pyrotechnics have obscured what sparked it all off — Musk’s attack on Trump’s ‘big, beautiful bill’ as a ‘disgusting abomination… a massive, outrageous, pork-filled Congressional spending bill’ that would significantly increase the federal budget deficit and the US national debt. And on this, putting aside the hyperbole, Musk is absolutely right.\n\nAmerica’s debt and deficit are already bad enough. Trump will make them worse. US national debt is now over $36trillion (£27trillion), around 125 per cent of America’s massive GDP (by far the biggest in the world). The federal budget deficit is now over $2 trillion a year and rising.\n\nThere is no will on either side of the political divide in Washington – where fiscal conservatism is a dead duck – to do anything about this. Or to stop Trump from fanning the flames of a fiscal position already on fire. It is Liz Truss on steroids.\n\nTrump’s ‘tax-cuts-and-more-spending’ proclivities will add another $2.5-$3trillion to deficits over the next decade, taking them to over 7 per cent of GDP for as far as the eye can see. The national debt is projected to move into Italian territory – around 135 per cent of GDP or more – some time in the next decade.\n\nUnlike the Japanese, Americans don’t save anything like enough to finance their debt and deficit from their own resources. There was a time, in the aftermath of the Second World War, when net savings accounted for 11 per cent of GDP. Today it’s a mere 0.6 per cent. So the US must borrow from the global debt markets, where it is already gobbling up a huge chunk of available lending.\n\nThis is where the rest of us – especially Britain – are adversely impacted. The more voracious the US appetite for debt, the less lending is available for the rest of the world, which pushes up the cost of borrowing for everybody else.\n\nBritain is already paying more to borrow than any other major market economy because our fiscal position is also precarious. As America’s need for even more borrowing rises, so the cost of British borrowing will rise too.\n\nChancellor Rachel Reeves is awash in problems of her own making. But her plight is all the worse because of this grim global backdrop. It would be prudent to call a halt to any further tax, spending or borrowing initiatives until we can see more clearly the global impact of Trump’s reckless fiscal policy. But, of course, that sort of prudence is not in Labour’s DNA.\n\nThis year, not even counting what Trump will have to borrow to pay for the tax cuts and extra spending, the US will need to refinance $7trillion of its existing debt. That’s over twice Britain’s GDP.\n\nThis was debt incurred when interest rates were abnormally low. Now America will have to pay at least the 4.4 per cent the markets are demanding for ten-year US Treasury bonds. No wonder the cost of servicing US debt is soaring.\n\nThe annual interest on US debt is now over $1trillion. It is already the second-highest federal outlay after pensions (called social security here) and destined to rise much higher as America borrows even more at higher rates. Britain is going the same way.\n\nOur annual interest bill for debt service is over £100billion, almost twice what we spend on defence. Last weekend, Reeves was boasting that Labour would spend £300billion more overall than the Tories planned before the end of the decade. She did not mention it meant extra borrowing on a massive scale at a time when the bond markets are skittish and the cost of borrowing for governments is rising. Like Trump, Reeves is also playing with fire.\n\nIt is scary that America is so hooked on debt despite a healthy economy. It’s usually okay to borrow big in a recession to pump-prime the economy. But not when you’ve had years of growth and full employment, which America has. It explains why all the major ratings agencies have downgraded America’s triple-A credit rating.\n\nThe biggest economic risk now to the global economy is that the US tilts into recession, which would add hugely to its already ballooning debt and deficit as tax revenues dried up. A sudden, sustained rise in real interest rates would follow, exporting a deep US recession to the rest of us.\n\nYou go bankrupt gradually, then suddenly, to paraphrase a character in one of Ernest Hemingway’s novels. The same has turned out to be true for the demise of the Trump-Musk bromance – and it is even more true for the trajectory of most fiscal crises.\n\nWe are in the gradual phase for now, allowing politicians to look the other way and tell us there’s no cause for concern. But fasten your seatbelts. That sudden deterioration could be just round the corner.","summary":"When I boarded a flight for New York on Thursday, Donald Trump and Elon Musk were still sticking to the script: though the dizzy days of their bromance might be over, the separation was amicable.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/debate/article-14788335/ANDREW-NEIL-musk-trump-beautiful-bill.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/06/06/18/99120381-0-image-a-29_1749229961947.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-06-07 00:28:52","author":"Andrew Neil,Editor","authors":["Andrew Neil","Editor"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.153},{"id":328931594,"title":"Elite-Backed Street Activists Harass ICE in New York Court Buildings","text":"ICE officers faced chaotic scuffles on June 6 from elite-backed activists in New York City’s major courthouse as they picked up migrants for deportation.\n\nThe opposition to law enforcement is just one part of the elite-backed massive resistance to President Donald Trump’s popular policy of enforcing Congress’s immigration laws. The opposition seeks to minimize deportations by harassing ICE officials and by portraying peaceful, orderly arrests as frightful “chaos.”\n\nThere was no chaos when the left-wing activists were absent, allowing ICE deputies to calmly escort illegal migrants out of the building:\n\nICE officials are increasingly arresting migrants at their scheduled court hearings, partly because it minimizes manpower and coordination demands, and also maximizes safety amid the risk of violence from street protests or dangerous migrants.\n\nTrump’s enforcement policy is already paying big dividends to the many ordinary Americans who are seeing their wages rise, their housing prices decline, and their local crime rates drop.\n\nBut the activist groups are so influential in the Democratic Party that top party leaders are joining their courthouse resistance. MSN.com reported on June 5 that the pro-migration City Comptroller, Brad Lander, joined the actions:\n\n“The last few weeks have been terrifying for New York City’s immigrant communities, for the city itself, this place that has been the greatest immigrant city the world has ever known with an immigrant tradition going back 400 years, and really for the rule of law itself,” Lander said on June 5.\nLander, who is running for mayor [against incumbent Mayor Eric Adams] attended hearings Thursday morning as part of the “Friend of the Court” program—an initiative by immigration coalition Immigrant ARC that designates individuals who can observe proceedings and assist respondents in navigating their immigration processes.\nHe encouraged other New Yorkers to participate in hearings as Friends of the Court in “solidarity” with immigrants undergoing proceedings. “I’ve felt more useful for the last hour than I have felt almost any time since Donald Trump was elected,” Lander said.\n\nImmigrant ARC is an elite-led pro-migration group in New York City.

It sets a timeline for regulators to propose new rules that will allow commercial operators to make more drone flights that extend beyond the line of sight of their operator, potentially opening up more applications for infrastructure, deliveries and public safety drones.\"The time has come to accelerate testing and to enable routine drone operations, scale up domestic production, and expand the export of trusted, American-manufactured drone technologies to global markets,\" the order reads.RELATED STORY | Scripps News gets inside look at growing effort to counter drone threatsThe second order is meant to help secure large public gatherings, law enforcement operations and military installations from unauthorized drones.The order will establish a new drone threat task force, as well as direct existing counterterrorism agencies to evaluate the threats from drones.

Until then, he will remain in federal custody.\n\nIf he is convicted, he would be deported to El Salvador after serving his sentence, Bondi said.\n\nThe Trump administration has said Abrego Garcia was a member of the MS-13 gang, an accusation that his lawyers deny.\n\nOfficials on Friday portrayed the indictment of Abrego Garcia by a grand jury in Tennessee as vindication of their approach to immigration enforcement.\n\n\"The man has a horrible past and I could see a decision being made, bring him back, show everybody how horrible this guy is,\" Trump told reporters aboard Air Force One, adding that it was the US Justice Department that decided to bring Abrego Garcia back.\n\nAccording to the indictment, Abrego Garcia worked with at least five co-conspirators as part of a smuggling ring to bring immigrants to the US illegally, and then transport them from the US-Mexico border to other destinations in the country.\n\nAbrego Garcia often picked up migrants in Houston, and made more than 100 trips between Texas and Maryland between 2016 and 2025, the indictment said. The indictment also alleges Abrego Garcia transported firearms and drugs.\n\nAccording to the indictment, one of Abrego Garcia's co-conspirators belonging to the same ring was involved in the transportation of migrants whose tractor trailer overturned in Mexico in 2021, resulting in 50 deaths.\n\nAbrego Garcia's lawyer, Simon Sandoval-Moshenberg, called the criminal charges \"fantastical\" and a \"kitchen sink\" of allegations.\n\n\"This is all based on the statements of individuals who are currently either facing prosecution or in federal prison,\" he said. \"I want to know what they offered those people.\"\n\nAbrego Garcia was deported on Mar 15, more than two months before the charges were filed.

Ảnh: REUTERS/TTXVN \n\n Theo kênh CNBC ngày 5/6, Tổng thống Trump và ông Elon Musk từng có mối quan hệ thân thiết, cùng tham dự các sự kiện, trả lời phỏng vấn chung và dành cho nhau những lời ca ngợi. Tuy nhiên, tất cả đã thay đổi chóng vánh. \n\n Hai nhân vật này công khai khẩu chiến, trong đó Tổng thống Trump cảnh báo rút lại hàng tỷ USD hợp đồng chính phủ dành cho các công ty của ông Musk, còn Giám đốc điều hành Tesla ám chỉ ông Trump không thể đắc cử nếu không có sự hậu thuẫn từ ông. \n\n Căng thẳng bắt đầu khi ông Trump ch.ỉ tríc.h ông Musk vì tỷ phú này đã phản đối dự luật cắt giảm thuế và chi tiêu của đảng Cộng hòa. \n\n Cuộc tranh cãi nhanh chóng leo thang thành một trận chiến dữ dội trên mạng xã hội Truth Social của ông Trump và mạng X của ông Musk, thu hút sự quan tâm từ các doanh nhân, nhà phân tích và chính trị gia nổi tiếng. \n\n Giới công nghệ và chính trị phản ứng \n\n Ngày 5/6, tỷ phú Bill Ackman kêu gọi ông Trump và ông Musk ngừng đối đầu. Ông viết trên X: “Hai người nên hòa giải vì lợi ích của đất nước”. Ông Ackman là nhà sáng lập kiêm giám đốc điều hành quỹ đầu cơ Pershing Square Capital Management – người từng ủng hộ ông Trump vài tháng trước cuộc bầu cử tháng 11/2024. Ông nói: “Chúng ta mạnh hơn khi đoàn kết hơn là chia rẽ”. Ông Musk đã đáp lại: “Anh không hề sai”. \n\n Cùng ngày, Hạ nghị sĩ Mỹ Jim Jordan trả lời trên kênh Fox News rằng ông hy vọng ông Elon Musk và ông Trump sẽ hòa giải, đồng thời bảo vệ dự luật ngân sách. \n\n Một số người thân cận với ông Trump lại không mang tinh thần hòa giải như vậy. Cựu cố vấn cấp cao của ông Trump là Steve Bannon, vốn đã có xung đột với ông Musk trong những tháng gần đây, đã kêu gọi các biện pháp mạnh tay. Trên chương trình “War Room Live” ngày 5/6, ông Bannon nói rằng ông Trump nên ký sắc lệnh hành pháp để tiếp quản SpaceX theo luật huy động an ninh quốc gia được gọi là Đạo luật Sản xuất Quốc phòng. Ông Bannon nói: “Chính phủ Mỹ nên tịch thu công ty này”, đồng thời kêu gọi chính quyền tước bỏ quyền tiếp cận thông tin mật của ông Musk và đình chỉ toàn bộ hợp đồng liên bang với các công ty của ông Musk trong thời gian chờ điều tra. \n\n Trong khi đó, tỷ phú đầu tư Mark Cuban dường như ủng hộ đề xuất của ông Musk khi ông thăm dò người theo dõi về việc thành lập một đảng chính trị mới ở Mỹ đại diện cho 80% cử tri trung dung. \n\n Video đang HOT \n\n Cựu ứng viên Tổng thống Andrew Yang chia sẻ lại bài viết của ông Cuban, sau đó đề xuất tổ chức một cuộc bầu cử sơ bộ độc lập cho kỳ bầu cử tổng thống năm 2028 với các ứng viên như ông Mark Cuban, Jamie Dimon và diễn viên Matthew McConaughey. \n\n Giới phân tích lo ngại \n\n Các nhà đầu tư Phố Wall đã bán tháo cổ phiếu Tesla khiến giá trị cổ phiếu lao dốc hơn 14%. \n\n Ông Dan Ives, Giám đốc điều hành và nhà phân tích cao cấp về cổ phiếu tại Wedbush, nhận định trong một bản ghi chú rằng cuộc xung đột giữa ông Musk và ông Trump là gâ.y số.c và làm rúng động thị trường, tạo ra nỗi lo lớn cho nhà đầu tư của Tesla. Ông nói: “Cổ phiếu Tesla đang chịu áp lực lớn, giảm gần 15% do giới đầu tư lo ngại cuộc chiến giữa ông Musk và ông Trump sẽ chấm dứt tình bạn giữa họ và thay đổi môi trường pháp lý đối với xe tự hành của Tesla trong những năm tới dưới thời chính quyền ông Trump”. \n\n Tuy nhiên, ông Ives cho rằng cuộc xung đột này không làm thay đổi nhận định lạc quan của Wedbush đối với Tesla, dù rõ ràng cuộc xung đột khiến khung pháp lý của ông Trump trở nên phức tạp hơn. \n\n Một người ủng hộ Tesla khác là Ross Gerber – Giám đốc công ty Quản lý Đầu tư và Tài sản Gerber Kawasaki – đã ch.ỉ tríc.h nặng nề ông Musk trong loạt bài đăng trên X, nói rằng ông Elon đang tấ.n côn.g tất cả những người mà chính ông từng giúp đắc cử. Ông bình luận rằng cuộc tranh cãi giữa hai nhân vật này không có lợi cho cổ đông. \n\n Ông Gary Black, Giám đốc Điều hành Future Fund, cho rằng cuộc chiến giữa ông Trump và ông Elon sẽ tiếp tục gây áp lực lên giá cổ phiếu, đồng thời ch.ỉ tríc.h những người ủng hộ Tesla. Ông viết trên X: “Chính những người ủng hộ này từng khẳng định suốt nhiều tháng rằng liên minh Musk – Trump sẽ giúp đơn giản hóa quá trình cấp phép liên bang, cho phép Tesla triển khai công nghệ tự hành toàn quốc mà không cần giám sát. Giờ thì khả năng đó gần như không còn nữa”. \n\n Ông David Rosenberg – Chủ tịch kiêm người sáng lập công ty Rosenberg Research – cho rằng SpaceX của ông Musk giúp Mỹ dẫn đầu trong công nghệ không gian và cuộc tranh cãi hiện tại có thể làm xói mòn sự ủng hộ đối với công ty này. \n\n Diễn biến cuộc đấu khẩu \n\n Các phản ứng và nhận định trên xuất hiện sau khi cuộc khẩu chiến bùng phát giữa ông Musk và ông Trump. \n\n Theo tờ Business Insider ngày 6/6, mâu thuẫn bắt đầu khi tỷ phú Musk đăng bài trên mạng xã hội X ch.ỉ tríc.h dự luật chi tiêu của đảng Cộng hòa. Ông liên tục côn.g kíc.h dự luật chi tiêu “Big Beautiful Bill” của đảng Cộng hòa trên nền tảng X suốt ngày 4/6, chỉ vài ngày sau khi ông chính thức rút khỏi Văn phòng Ban Hiệu quả Chính phủ của Nhà Trắng. Ông Musk tiếp tục chuỗi bài đăng ch.ỉ tríc.h vào ngày 5/6. \n\n Về phần mình, phát biểu tại Phòng Bầu dục, Tổng thống Trump nói với báo giới rằng ông và Elon Musk từng có mối quan hệ rất tốt, nhưng không chắc điều đó còn đúng hay không. \n\n Sau đó, Tổng thống Trump đã lên nền tảng mạng xã hội Truth Social để cáo buộc rằng ông Musk ch.ỉ tríc.h dự luật chủ yếu vì dự luật này sẽ loại bỏ các khoản tín dụng thuế có lợi cho Tesla. \n\n Cuộc đấu khẩu trên mạng xã hội tiếp tục leo thang khi ông Musk không chỉ bác bỏ cáo buộc của ông Trump mà còn đào lại các bài đăng cũ mà Tổng thống dường như ủng hộ quan điểm của mình, rồi cáo buộc ông Trump có liên hệ với nhà tài chính quá cố và tội phạm tìn.h dụ.c Jeffrey Epstein, đồng thời nhận công trong việc giúp ông Trump giành chiến thắng trong cuộc bầu cử năm 2024. \n\n Thư ký báo chí Nhà Trắng Karoline Leavitt trả lời phỏng vấn của Business Insider về bài đăng liên quan đến Epstein: “Đây là một hành động đáng tiếc từ phía ông Elon Musk, người đang không hài lòng với dự luật Big Beautiful Bill vì không bao gồm các chính sách mà ông ấy mong muốn. Tổng thống đang tập trung vào thông qua dự luật lịch sử này để đưa đất nước chúng ta vĩ đại trở lại”. \n\n Ông Trump tiếp tục đáp trả bằng cách cảnh báo hủy các hợp đồng liên bang với những công ty của ông Musk. \n\n Đáp lại, ông Musk tuyên bố sẽ ngừng vận hành tàu vũ trụ Dragon của SpaceX ngay lập tức. \n\n Thậm chí, ông Musk còn đồng ý với nhận định rằng nên luận tội Tổng thống Trump và để Phó tổng thống JD Vance thay thế. \n\n Tác động từ việc tỷ phú Elon Musk tuyên bố sẽ chi 'ít hơn rất nhiều' cho chính trị Mỹ Tỷ phú Elon Musk cho biết ông dự định sẽ chi \"ít hơn rất nhiều\" cho các chiến dịch chính trị trong tương lai. Tuyên bố được nhận định là cú giáng mạnh vào những người trung thành với Tổng thống Donald Trump trước thềm cuộc bầu cử giữa kỳ vào năm tới. Tỷ phú Elon Musk. Ảnh: AFP/TTXVN.

I'm not thinking about Elon Musk, I just wish him well,\" Trump told reporters aboard Air Force One en route to his New Jersey golf club late Friday.Earlier, Trump told US broadcasters that he now wanted to focus instead on passing his \"big, beautiful\" mega-bill before Congress -- Musk's harsh criticism of which had sparked their break-up.But the 78-year-old Republican could not stop himself from taking aim at his South African-born friend-turned-enemy.\"You mean the man who has lost his mind?\" Trump said in a call with ABC when asked about Musk, adding that he was \"not particularly\" interested in talking to the tycoon.Trump later told Fox News that Musk had \"lost it.\"Just a week ago Trump gave Musk a glowing send-off as he left his cost-cutting role at the so-called Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) after four months working there. 'Very disappointed' While there had been reports of tensions, the sheer speed at which their relationship imploded stunned Washington.After Musk called Trump's spending bill an \"abomination\" on Tuesday, Trump hit back in an Oval Office diatribe on Thursday in which he said he was \"very disappointed\" by the entrepreneur.Trump's spending bill faces a difficult path through Congress as it will raise the US deficit, while critics say it will cut health care for millions of the poorest Americans. The row then went nuclear, with Musk slinging insults at Trump and accusing him without evidence of being in government files on disgraced financier and sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.Trump hit back with the power of the US government behind him, saying he could cancel the Space X boss's multi-billion-dollar rocket and satellite contracts.Trump struck a milder tone late Friday when asked how seriously he is considering cutting Musk's contracts. \"It's a lot of money, it's a lot of subsidy, so we'll take a look -- only if it's fair. Only if it's to be fair for him and the country,\" he said.Musk apparently also tried to de-escalate social media hostilities.The right-wing tech baron rowed back on a threat to scrap his company's Dragon spacecraft -- vital for ferrying NASA astronauts to and from the International Space Station.And on Friday the usually garrulous poster kept a low social media profile on his X social network.But the White House denied reports that they would talk.\"The president does not intend to speak to Musk today,\" a senior White House official told AFP. A second official said Musk had requested a call. Tesla giveaway? Tesla stocks tanked more than 14 percent on Thursday amid the row, losing some $100 billion of the company's market value, but recovering partly Friday.Trump is now considering either selling or giving away the cherry red Tesla S that he announced he had bought from Musk's firm in March.The electric vehicle was still parked on the White House grounds on Friday. \"He's thinking about it, yes,\" a senior White House official told AFP when asked if Trump would sell or give it away.Trump and Musk had posed inside the car at a bizarre event in March, when the president turned the White House into a pop-up Tesla showroom after viral protests against Musk's DOGE role.But while Trump appeared to hold many of the cards, Musk also has some to play.His wealth allowed him to be the biggest donor to Trump's 2024 campaign, to the tune of nearly $300 million. Any further support for the 2026 midterm election now appears in doubt -- while Musk could also use his money to undermine Trump's support on the right.","summary":"","url":"https://tribune.net.ph/2025/06/07/trump-says-musk-has-lost-his-mind","image":"https://media.assettype.com/tribune/2025-06-06/6xzkji7a/donald-trump-and-elon-musk.jpg?w=1200&h=675&auto=format%2Ccompress&fit=max&enlarge=true","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-06-07 00:20:41","author":"Agence France-Presse","authors":["Agence France-Presse"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"ph","sentiment":-0.367},{"id":328925008,"title":"Inside father-of-14 billionaire Elon Musk's $45,000 3-bed home in Texas","text":"Elon Musk is one of the richest men in the world but did you know his primary residence is a $45,000 three-bed in the south of Texas?\n\n\"My primary home is literally a ~$50k house in Boca Chica / Starbase that I rent from SpaceX.

He was arrested two days before dozens of Proud Boys members stormed the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021. Tarrio wasn't at the Capitol that day, but a jury convicted him of orchestrating a violent plot to keep President Donald Trump in the White House after he lost the 2020 election.\n\nLamond testified at his bench trial that he never provided Tarrio with sensitive police information. Tarrio, who testified as a witness for Lamond’s defense, said he did not confess to Lamond about burning the banner and did not receive any confidential information from him.\n\nBut the judge did not find either man’s testimony to be credible. Jackson said the evidence indicated that Lamond was not using Tarrio as a source after the Dec. 12, 2020, banner burning.\n\n“It was the other way around,” she said.\n\nLamond, of Colonial Beach, Virginia, retired in May 2023 after 23 years of service to the police department.\n\nLamond, who met Tarrio in 2019, had supervised the intelligence branch of the police department’s Homeland Security Bureau. He was responsible for monitoring groups like the Proud Boys when they came to Washington.\n\nProsecutors said Lamond tipped off Tarrio that a warrant for his arrest had been signed. They pointed to messages that suggest Lamond provided Tarrio with real-time updates on the police investigation.\n\nLamond’s indictment says he and Tarrio exchanged messages about the Jan. 6 riot and discussed whether Proud Boys members were in danger of being charged in the attack.\n\n“Of course I can’t say it officially, but personally I support you all and don’t want to see your group’s name and reputation dragged through the mud,” Lamond wrote.\n\nLamond said he was upset that a prosecutor labeled him as a Proud Boys “sympathizer” who acted as a “double agent” for the group after Tarrio burned a stolen Black Lives Matter banner in December 2020.\n\n“I don’t support the Proud Boys, and I’m not a Proud Boys sympathizer,” Lamond testified.\n\nLamond said he considered Tarrio to be a source, not a friend. But he said he tried to build a friendly rapport with the group leader to gain his trust.","summary":"A retired police officer was sentenced on Friday to serve 18 months behind bars for lying to authorities about leaking confidential information to the Proud Boys extremist group's former top leader, who was under investigation for burning a Black Lives Matter banner in the nation's capital.

Fiscal tightening involves either raising taxes or cutting government spending.\n\nEarlier this week, Paul Johnson, the director of the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS), also warned the only way to pay for the increased defence budget would be through “chunky tax rises” as the government grapples with other key areas of public spending.\n\nHe told Times Radio: “You really do have to ask that question, what are the choices that you're going to make? Bluntly, it really does seem to me that the only choice that is available, is some really quite chunky tax increases to pay for it.”\n\nAccording to the IFS, hitting the 3 per cent target by 2030 would require an extra £17bn pounds between now and then which is yet to be accounted for.\n\nSir Keir has previously said that increasing defence spending to 2.5 per cent would mean “spending £13.4bn more on defence every year from 2027”.\n\nThe Office for Budget Responsibility has also estimated that reaching 3 per cent by the next parliament would cost an additional £17.3bn in 2029-30.\n\nSpeaking in parliament as the defence review was unveiled this week, Lib Dem defence spokesperson Helen Maguire said: “It is staggering that we still don’t have an answer to the vital question: ‘Where is the money coming from?’ The government has flip-flopped a number of times on 3 per cent.”\n\nOn Tuesday, defence secretary John Healey failed to rule out tax rises to make Britain “war ready” and insisted he was “100 per cent confident” the 3 per cent target would be met – but struggled to say how it would be paid for.\n\nIt came as defence sources were reported to expect that Britain will be forced to sign up to a target to hike defence spending to 3.5 per cent by 2035 at a Nato summit later this month in a bid to appease the US president.","url":"https://uk.news.yahoo.com/uk-could-face-30bn-tax-223713569.html","image":"https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_independent_577/3c43fef2a00e66ae626c0a2252e0de35","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-06-07 00:11:59","author":"Andy Gregory","authors":["Andy Gregory"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.283},{"id":328927954,"title":"Trump says Musk has 'lost his mind' as feud fallout mounts","text":"US President Donald Trump said Friday that Elon Musk had \"lost his mind\" but insisted he wanted to move on from the fiery split with his billionaire former ally.\n\nThe blistering public break-up between the world's richest person and the world's most powerful is fraught with political and economic risks all round.\n\nTrump had scrapped the idea of a call with Musk and was even thinking of ditching the red Tesla he bought at the height of their bromance, White House officials told AFP.\n\n\"Honestly I've been so busy working on China, working on Russia, working on Iran... I'm not thinking about Elon Musk, I just wish him well,\" Trump told reporters aboard Air Force One en route to his New Jersey golf club late Friday.\n\nEarlier, Trump told US broadcasters that he now wanted to focus instead on passing his \"big, beautiful\" mega-bill before Congress -- Musk's harsh criticism of which had sparked their break-up.\n\nBut the 78-year-old Republican could not stop himself from taking aim at his South African-born friend-turned-enemy.\n\n\"You mean the man who has lost his mind?\" Trump said in a call with ABC when asked about Musk, adding that he was \"not particularly\" interested in talking to the tycoon.\n\nTrump later told Fox News that Musk had \"lost it.\"\n\nJust a week ago Trump gave Musk a glowing send-off as he left his cost-cutting role at the so-called Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) after four months working there.\n\n- 'Very disappointed' -\n\nWhile there had been reports of tensions, the sheer speed at which their relationship imploded stunned Washington.\n\nAfter Musk called Trump's spending bill an \"abomination\" on Tuesday, Trump hit back in an Oval Office diatribe on Thursday in which he said he was \"very disappointed\" by the entrepreneur.\n\nTrump's spending bill faces a difficult path through Congress as it will raise the US deficit, while critics say it will cut health care for millions of the poorest Americans.\n\nThe row then went nuclear, with Musk slinging insults at Trump and accusing him without evidence of being in government files on disgraced financier and sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.\n\nTrump hit back with the power of the US government behind him, saying he could cancel the Space X boss's multi-billion-dollar rocket and satellite contracts.\n\nTrump struck a milder tone late Friday when asked how seriously he is considering cutting Musk's contracts.\n\n\"It's a lot of money, it's a lot of subsidy, so we'll take a look -- only if it's fair. Only if it's to be fair for him and the country,\" he said.\n\nMusk apparently also tried to de-escalate social media hostilities.\n\nThe right-wing tech baron rowed back on a threat to scrap his company's Dragon spacecraft -- vital for ferrying NASA astronauts to and from the International Space Station.\n\nAnd on Friday the usually garrulous poster kept a low social media profile on his X social network.\n\nBut the White House denied reports that they would talk.\n\n\"The president does not intend to speak to Musk today,\" a senior White House official told AFP. A second official said Musk had requested a call.\n\n- Tesla giveaway? -\n\nTesla stocks tanked more than 14 percent on Thursday amid the row, losing some $100 billion of the company's market value, but recovering partly Friday.\n\nTrump is now considering either selling or giving away the cherry red Tesla S that he announced he had bought from Musk's firm in March.\n\nThe electric vehicle was still parked on the White House grounds on Friday. \"He's thinking about it, yes,\" a senior White House official told AFP when asked if Trump would sell or give it away.\n\nTrump and Musk had posed inside the car at a bizarre event in March, when the president turned the White House into a pop-up Tesla showroom after viral protests against Musk's DOGE role.\n\nBut while Trump appeared to hold many of the cards, Musk also has some to play.\n\nHis wealth allowed him to be the biggest donor to Trump's 2024 campaign, to the tune of nearly $300 million. Any further support for the 2026 midterm election now appears in doubt -- while Musk could also use his money to undermine Trump's support on the right.\n\ndk/dw/sla/acb","url":"https://uk.news.yahoo.com/trump-no-plans-call-musk-141356075.html","image":"https://media.zenfs.com/en/afp.co.uk/fdb8237eaeaeeb6fb9fb2a5e46f3dd58","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-06-07 00:09:48","author":"Danny Kemp","authors":["Danny Kemp"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.343},{"id":328929456,"title":"Ukraine gives Russia grounds to launch massive strike, says Trump","text":"WASHINGTON, June 7. /TASS/.

They own several luxury properties across the United States — including a second one in New York City, a triplex unit in the West Village — as well as England and Australia\n\nTheir aforementioned, not-so-humble Manhattan abode was designed by Jean Nouvel — a Pritzker Prize winner and the renowned architect behind the Louvre Abu Dhabi. \nThe penthouse features a private elevator entrance, a stunning views of the Hudson River and the Manhattan skyline as well as 14-foot-high floor-to-ceiling windows in the property spanning just over 4,675 square feet. \nThe now-exes once enjoyed the rooftop terrace with an outdoor kitchen as well as a library room that could be converted into a fourth living space.\nJackman and Furness's plans for their other New York City property has not yet been revealed.\nThey purchased that Perry Street triplex unit in 2010 and put it up for sale for $38.9 million in 2022. \nAfter about two years, however, they appear to have taken the 11,000-square-foot property off the market after a number of price cuts failed to land a buyer. \nThe property remains in the hands of their shell company Lackawanna LLC. \nJackman and Furness, who have been married since 1996, announced their separation back in 2023 after 27 years of marriage. \n\nTheir aforementioned, not-so-humble Manhattan abode was designed by Jean Nouvel — a Pritzker Prize winner and the renowned architect behind the Louvre Abu Dhabi\n\nThe penthouse features a private elevator entrance, a stunning views of the Hudson River and the Manhattan skyline\n\nThere are 14-foot-high floor-to-ceiling windows in the property spanning just over 4,675 square feet\n\nThere are multiple kitchens in the penthouse and 360-degree views of the River Hudson and the stunning skyline\n\nThe spacious penthouse has a minimalist design and is one of 57 units across 23 floors designed by French architect Nouvel\n\nThe multi-level penthouse sits in an asymmetrically gridded building. There are two fireplaces and multiple dining areas\n\nThere is lots of lush entertaining space and also features a library room that could be converted into a fourth bedroom\nAt the time, they cited a desire to pursue 'individual growth.' \nThough the pair have not publicly revealed the reasons behind their separation, rumors have run rampant as fans speculate Jackman growing close to his fellow Broadway co-star Sutton Foster in The Music Man play was a factor in their split. \nLast month, Furness alluded to Jackman's alleged affair with his now-girlfriend as she broke her silence about his 'betrayal' since legally filing for divorce. \n'My heart and compassion goes out to everyone who has traversed the traumatic journey of betrayal,' she wrote in a statement shared exclusively with DailyMail.com.\n'It's a profound wound that cuts deep, however I believe in a higher power and that God/the universe, whatever you relate to as your guidance, is always working FOR us.' \nShe continued: 'This belief has helped me navigate the breakdown of an almost three-decade marriage. \n\nTheir plans for their other New York City property has not yet been revealed.

Even when we are presented with apparent adversity, it is leading us to our greatest good, our true purpose,' she wrote.\n'It can hurt, but in the long run, returning to yourself and living within your own integrity, values and boundaries is liberation and freedom.'\nShe concluded her statement with the 'one thing' that she has learned, which is 'that none of this is personal.'\nShe added: 'We are all on our individual journeys and I believe that the relationships in our lives are not random. We are drawn to people, we invite them in, in order to learn our lessons and to recognize and heal the broken parts of ourselves...I remain grateful.'\nHugh Jackman\n\nShare or comment on this article: \nHugh Jackman and Deborra-Lee Furness SPLIT their $24M NYC penthouse amid ugly divorce\n\nAdd comment\n\n Share what you think\n\nWorst rated\n\nThe comments below have not been moderated.\n\nThe views expressed in the contents above are those of our users and do not necessarily reflect the views of MailOnline.\n\nAdd your comment\n\nEnter your comment\n\nBy posting your comment you agree to our house rules.\n\nSubmit Comment\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual.\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual\n\nWe will automatically post your comment and a link to the news story to your Facebook timeline at the same time it is posted on MailOnline.

Her campaigning has won praise from Donald Trump, who welcomed her to the White House before he signed the 'Keeping Men out of Women's Sports' executive order.\n\nOn Friday, she retweeted a picture of Minnesota team Champlin Park celebrating their state high school title that they won with transgender pitcher Marissa Rothenberger on the team.\n\n'Comments off lol,' Gaines wrote in response to the post. 'To be expected when your star player is a boy.'\n\nIt sparked a blistering response from Biles, 28, who first criticized Gaines' view and then compared her appearance to a man. Biles wrote: 'You’re truly sick, all of this campaigning because you lost a race. Straight up sore loser. \n\n'You should be uplifting the trans community and perhaps finding a way to make sports inclusive OR creating a new avenue where trans feel safe in sports. Maybe a transgender category IN ALL sports!! \n\n'But instead… You bully them… One things for sure is no one in sports is safe with you around!!!!!'\n\nShe then tweeted at Gaines again, saying: 'Bully someone your own size, which would ironically be a male.'\n\nGaines replied: 'This is actually so disappointing. It's not my job or the job of any woman to figure out how to include men in our spaces. \n\n'You can uplift men stealing championships in women's sports with YOUR platform. Men don't belong in women's sports and I say that with my full chest.'\n\nShe continued: 'My take is the least controversial take on the planet. Simone Biles being a male-apologist at the expense of young girls’ dreams? Didn’t have that on my bingo card. Maybe she could compete in pommel horse and rings in 2028.'\n\nGaines then addressed Biles mocking her appearance, saying: 'And the subtle hint at \"body-shaming\" ???? Plzzzz I'm 5'5\".'\n\nBiles also gave a savage reply to a Trump voter that wrote back to her: 'Simone, there is a reason they have rings in men’s gymnastics, and not women’s. Male athletes have a biological advantage over female athletes. That will never changes.'\n\nBiles wrote back: 'Can you even read? I see we are lacking comprehension skills as well…..'\n\nThe issue of trans athletes in sports has been a bigger talking point in the US this week with the Minnesota high school team reaching the state championships. \n\nRothenberger is biologically male. At nine, Rothenberger's mother applied in district court to alter her child's birth certificate after their ninth birthday, with the petition being approved, per Reduxx. \n\nRothenberger was issued a new birth certificate showing to be born female, switching their name from 'Charlie Dean' to Marissa.\n\nMORE TO FOLLOW","summary":"Simone Biles has launched a withering attack on Riley Gaines, after the she criticized a Minnesota high school softball team for competing with a trans player.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/othersports/article-14789219/Simone-Biles-attacks-Riley-Gaines-criticizing-trans-athletes.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/06/07/00/99128497-0-image-m-17_1749253212238.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-06-07 00:01:39","author":"Editor,Jack Bezants","authors":["Editor","Jack Bezants"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":0.134},{"id":328927902,"title":"Trump has 'no plans' to speak to Musk as feud persists","text":"Camera IconUS President Donald Trump says he hasn't been thinking about Elon Musk since their feud exploded.

He replied \"exactly\" to a post by another X user that said Musk had criticised Congress and Trump had responded by criticising Musk personally.\n\nMusk also declared it was time for a new political party in the United States \"to represent the 80 per cent in the middle!\"\n\nPeople who have spoken to Musk said his anger has begun to recede and they think he will want to repair his relationship with Trump, according to one person who has spoken to Musk's entourage.\n\nThe White House statements came one day after the two men battled openly in an extraordinary display of hostilities that marked a stark end to a close alliance.\n\nTesla stock rose on Friday, clawing back some losses from Thursday's session, when it dropped 14 per cent and lost $US150 billion ($A231 billion) in value, the largest single-day decline in the company's history.\n\nMusk, the world's richest person, bankrolled a large part of Trump's 2024 presidential campaign. Trump named Musk to head a controversial effort to downsize the federal workforce and slash spending.\n\nTrump feted Musk at the White House a week ago as he wrapped up his role as head of the Department of Government Efficiency. Musk cut only about half of one per cent of total spending, far short of his brash plans to axe $US2 trillion ($A3.1 trillion) from the federal budget.\n\nSince then, Musk has denounced Trump's tax-cut and spending bill as a \"disgusting abomination\". His opposition is complicating efforts to pass the bill in Congress where Republicans hold a slim majority.\n\nTrump had initially stayed quiet while Musk campaigned to torpedo the bill, but broke his silence on Thursday, telling reporters he was \"very disappointed\" in Musk.\n\nMusk, who spent nearly $US300 million ($A462 million) in the 2024 elections, said Trump would have lost without his support and suggested he should be impeached.\n\nTrump suggested he would terminate government contracts with Musk's businesses, which include rocket company SpaceX and its satellite unit Starlink.\n\nThe billionaire then threatened to decommission SpaceX's Dragon spacecraft, the only US spacecraft capable of sending astronauts to the International Space Station. Musk later backed off that threat.\n\nA prolonged feud could make it harder for Republicans to keep control of Congress in the 2026 midterm elections if Musk withholds financial support or other major Silicon Valley business leaders distance themselves from Trump.\n\nMusk had already said he planned to curtail his political spending, and on Tuesday called for \"all politicians who betrayed the American people\" to be fired in 2026.\n\nHis involvement with the Trump administration has provoked widespread protests at Tesla sites, driving down sales while investors fretted that Musk's attention was too divided.","summary":"A day after Donald Trump and Elon Musk battled in an extraordinary display of hostilities, the US president says he isn't thinking about the Tesla billionaire.","url":"https://thewest.com.au/politics/trump-has-no-plans-to-speak-to-musk-as-feud-persists-c-18953235","image":"https://images.thewest.com.au/publication/C-18953235/0ed317bfc994c1a7594df905c986b32a45780325-16x9-x0y0w1280h720.jpg?imwidth=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-06-07 00:01:00","author":"Nandita Bose","authors":["Nandita Bose"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"au","sentiment":-0.175},{"id":328925152,"title":"Zelensky refutes Trump’s take on war and calls Putin ‘murderer who came to kill the kids’","text":"Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky (center) said that US President Donald Trump (right) ‘could not feel fully and understand this pain’ amid the ongoing war with Russia and President Vladimir Putin (left) (Pictures: Getty Images/AP)\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky rejected US President Donald Trump’s comparison of his war with Russia to kids fighting – but labeled Russian President Vladimir Putin a child ‘murderer’. \n\nZelensky strongly refuted Trump’s new analogy involving him and Putin in the ongoing Russia-Ukraine war.\n\n‘Sometimes you see two young children fighting like crazy,’ Trump said during an Oval Office meeting on Thursday.\n\n‘They hate each other, and they’re fighting in a park, and you try and pull them apart. \n\n‘They don’t want to be pulled.

But on Tuesday, its citizens elected Lee Jae-myung – a symbol of resilience and reform – as their new president, in a vote seen as a rebuke of his predecessor’s failed martial law decree that plunged the nation into a political crisis.\nThe liberal Democratic Party of Korea (DPK) candidate secured a decisive victory over conservative rival Kim Moon-soo of the People Power Party (PPP), capturing 49.42 per cent of the vote to Kim’s 41.15 per cent in Tuesday’s snap election.\nThe vote – triggered by the impeachment of former president Yoon Suk-yeol – left no room for a transition period. Lee was sworn in immediately, ushering in a new chapter in South Korean politics.\nWith nearly 17.3 million votes, Lee achieved the largest vote count for a presidential candidate in the country’s electoral history on a voter turnout of 79.4 per cent – the highest in nearly three decades. For many, the election served as a referendum on the PPP, the former party of Yoon, whose unconstitutional martial law bid late last year stunned the nation.\n“I will do my utmost to overcome the aftermath of the rebellion and ensure that never again will arms entrusted by the people be turned against them,” South Korea’s new president declared to a crowd gathered near the National Assembly in the early hours of Wednesday morning.\n\nStanding beside his wife, Kim Hye-kyung, the 61-year-old Lee laid out a vision anchored in democratic restoration and national unity.\n“We will restore democracy in this country and build a society where our citizens are respected as sovereigns, living together in cooperation – not with hatred or hostility,” he said. “I will immediately get to work to revive our struggling economy and improve the livelihoods of our people.”\nFor many voters, Lee’s life story embodies the resilience and progressive values he champions. Born into poverty, he worked in a factory as a teenager before becoming a human rights lawyer and eventually a prominent political figure. He served as mayor of Seongnam City from 2010 to 2018 and later as governor of Gyeonggi province, the most populous in South Korea.\nThough narrowly defeated by Yoon in the 2022 presidential race, Lee’s political comeback has been swift – and emphatic.\nIn his inaugural address, Lee pledged to lead a “market-oriented” and “flexible pragmatist government”, committed to easing regulations, supporting businesses and bridging the ideological rifts that have fractured the nation.\n\nOn foreign policy, he reiterated his support for a strong alliance with the United States, vowed to strengthen trilateral cooperation with the US and Japan, and promised to seek balance in the region.\n“We will engage with neighbouring countries from the perspective of national interest and pragmatism,” he said.\n“No matter how costly peace may be, it is better than war. It is better to win without fighting than to win through fighting. The most reliable security is peace that makes fighting unnecessary.”\nBut Lee’s remarks were not entirely dovish. Citing the South’s superior military capabilities – it regularly ranks as the fifth most powerful in the world and boasts a defence budget twice the size of North Korea’s entire economy – he stressed the importance of continuing to deter a nuclear-armed North, while also keeping communication channels open.\n“We will … work to build peace on the Korean peninsula through dialogue and cooperation,” he said.\n\nWhat Lee’s victory means\nBy electing Lee, political observers say South Koreans have emphatically turned the page on the authoritarian impulses of the Yoon era.\n“Lee’s election as its new president will help put South Korea on its normal track following months of political turbulence,” Yoon Sung-suk, a political-science professor at Chonnam National University, told This Week in Asia.\nWith a National Assembly dominated by the DPK and its allies, South Korea’s new liberal president is expected to wield considerable consolidated power.\n“The president’s grip on power will be strong,” Yoon said. “He will also be able to keep a firm hand on state affairs, backed by the National Assembly.”\nLeif-Eric Easley, a political scientist and international studies professor at Ewha Womans University agreed with this assessment, calling the outcome of Tuesday’s election a “watershed moment” for South Korean politics.\nBut Lee’s ambitions for pragmatic diplomacy could yet come undone in a world increasingly defined by the rivalry between South Korea’s main security guarantor, the US, and its largest trading partner, China.\n\nWith the threat of punitive US tariffs still looming and Russia–North Korea military ties deepening amid the ongoing war in Ukraine, Lee’s government will find itself walking a geopolitical tightrope.\nWhile the new president would doubtless aim to put daylight between his own foreign policy and that of his predecessor, Easley cautioned that Lee should not “throw the baby out with the bathwater”.\nCertain elements, such as enhanced trilateral cooperation with the US and Japan, were well worth retaining, he said.\nLee should also prioritise cultivating personal ties with US President Donald Trump and stabilising the alliance by refocusing on military deterrence, economic security and coordinated diplomacy, according to Easley.\nHowever, Jung Suk-koo, a former executive editor of centre-left liberal Korean newspaper The Hankyoreh, warned that pressure from Washington to join efforts aimed at containing China could severely limit Lee’s diplomatic manoeuvrability.\n\n“As the rivalry between China and the United States intensifies, and as North Korea and Russia deepen their military alliance amid the war in Ukraine, Lee will find little room to manoeuvre,” Jung said.\nDuring the campaign, Lee promised to restore US ties that were tarnished by the martial law debacle and leverage South Korea’s strengths in shipbuilding, defence production and hi-tech industries to negotiate an easing of Trump’s tariffs.\nHe also vowed to reinforce the South Korea–US–Japan trilateral framework, which US Secretary of State Marco Rubio said in a congratulatory message to Lee had helped “bolster regional security, enhance economic resilience and defend our shared democratic principles”.\nWashington was not Lee’s only foreign-policy concern on the campaign trail, however. He also pledged to repair strained relations with Beijing.\n“China is an important trading partner and also influences the security of the Korean peninsula,” he said. “I will stably manage the Korea–China relationship, which reached its worst state under the previous government.”\n‘Friend or foe’ rejected\nAccording to the seasoned diplomat Lee appointed on Wednesday as his foreign affairs and security adviser, ties with Beijing are currently at their “lowest ebb” since diplomatic relations were established in 1992.\n“Yoon applied a ‘friend-or-foe’ framework not just to domestic politics, but to international relations as well,” Wi Sung-lac said in response to a question from This Week in Asia.\n“He claimed to be pursuing value-based diplomacy that emphasised freedom and democracy, but undermined both by declaring an illegal martial law.”\nWi stressed that the Lee administration would avoid such ideological binaries.\n“We’ll steer clear of black-or-white approaches and instead pursue a pragmatic path grounded in national interests,” he said.\n\nTo that end, the new government aimed to establish a “strategic cooperative partnership” with China while stabilising relations with Russia, Wi said. But that, too, may cause a domestic backlash.\nAnti-China sentiment, stoked by Yoon, remains widespread among South Koreans, according to Choi Jin, head of the Institute of Presidential Leadership, a Seoul-based research foundation.\nComplicating matters are growing maritime tensions in the Yellow Sea. In February, China blocked South Korean inspectors from accessing a steel structure it says is a commercial fish farm. Seoul suspects the structure may have military implications.\n“Tensions, confrontations, or restrictions on navigation are not desirable,” Wi said. “Both countries should prioritise stability in the Yellow Sea.”\nLast month, China reportedly imposed a “no-sail zone” in parts of the waterway located between the two countries, prompting Seoul to raise concerns through diplomatic channels.\n\nOn Japan, Wi indicated that Lee’s government would pursue a “two-track approach” – deepening cooperation in security, trade and culture while continuing to address unresolved historical grievances, including wartime forced labour, sexual slavery and the dispute over the Dokdo or Takeshima Islands.\nSasae Kenichiro, president of the Japan Institute of International Affairs, noted in a recent seminar that both nations face pressure from Washington to shoulder more defence costs.\n“It’s time for both countries to cooperate so the United States can play its proper role – and to move forward together,” the the retired Japanese diplomat said.\nLee’s room for foreign policy manoeuvre may also shrink as global tensions rise.\n“Superpower rivalry is intensifying. China and the US are increasingly at odds, while North Korea is aligning more closely with Russia,” Lee Jun-han, a political-science professor at Incheon National University, told This Week in Asia. “In this climate, Lee won’t have much wiggle room.”\nIn this climate, Lee won’t have much wiggle room\nLee Jun-han, political scientist\nStill, South Korea’s new president is determined to thaw frozen relations with Pyongyang. He has vowed to restore an inter-Korean military hotline, halt provocative leaflet campaigns and propaganda broadcasts, and resume dialogue.\n“To make meaningful progress toward peace on the Korean peninsula and resolve the North Korean nuclear issue, we will work closely with our ally, the United States, and seek broader cooperation with the international community,” he said.\nNorth Korean state media acknowledged Lee’s election victory in a short report published on Thursday that went into few details.\nEchoing Lee’s vision, Wi called for a return to multilateral engagement.\n“There’s no reason the United States, Japan and China can’t cooperate on denuclearisation and peace,” he told reporters last week. “They’ve done so in the past – and we should do the same now. Unfortunately, things have been moving in the opposite direction.”","summary":"Six months ago, South Korea teetered on the brink of authoritarian regression.

Their qualifications are irrelevant, just as they’ve been irrelevant for men. The same standard will apply to the general staff of all militaries. \n\nI understand there will be considerable pushback to this idea from all sides. From the feminists, who might argue that I am appropriating the legacy trauma of women everywhere.\n\nFrom the Andrew Tate acolytes, who will argue treachery to a non-existent brotherhood.\n\nFrom the centrists, who will accuse me of flagrant populism and suggesting I have hopped aboard a bandwagon — or a fallopian flotilla — all in the name of ingratiating myself to the sisterhood.\n\n To all of them, I simply say: This isn’t working\n\nThe manscaping of society has gone on for far too long and the results of the masculine monopoly have proven to be much too disastrous for humankind, for the planet, for the arts, culture, and academia.\n\nThe only thing men have not ruined all by themselves is sport — both the watching of it and the playing of it. That, and drinking silently in pubs.\n\nLiterally every other thing has been tainted to some degree by an inglorious arms race between men intent on one thing: Winning a big micky contest.\n\nThe cost of that megalomaniac pursuit has been catastrophic. War. Famine. Drought. Climate change. Kanye. And now, in the case of Donald Trump and Elon Musk, a break-up so unedifying they make Kim Kardashian look like Grace Kelly.\n\nWomen themselves are not entirely blameless. Maggie Thatcher didn’t exactly woo the working class with a mother’s touch.\n\nKamala Harris may have proven slightly less duplicitous a president than Donald Trump, but she was too incompetent to defeat him.\n\nLiz Truss, Suella Braverman, and Priti Patel were nearly as bad as Boris Johnson, which is a quite the reach.\n\nUrsula von der Leyen displays all the empathy of a data centre, and I wouldn’t trust Giorgia Meloni as far as I could throw her.\n\n Closer to home, the nuns — as a collective — did considerable damage, especially to women\n\nDespite all of this, I still think men have had the reins for long enough. All its brought us is disaster.\n\nAs of this year, only 13% of the world’s nations are led by women. Historically, only about one third of United Nations member states have ever had a woman serve as head of government.\n\nAccording to UN figures, women hold just 23% of ministerial positions globally in 2025. The same study notes women are more often assigned portfolios related to social affairs, while defence, foreign affairs, and finance remain predominantly the purview of men.\n\nIn terms of wealth, women constitute approximately 13.3% of the world’s billionaires. According to Forbes’ rich list published this year, out of 3,028 billionaires globally, only 406 are women.\n\nLet’s put the diversity, equity and inclusion argument to one side for a moment. Clearly, that was beyond our abilities to properly implement, probably because it was men responsible for it.\n\nPerhaps we don’t even need to try that hard. Perhaps we should just seek to put the best people in the jobs with the most power. Perhaps, after many millennia of evidence, men are not those people. Perhaps the best people to be in power are those who do not seek it out.\n\n“Unhappy that I am, I cannot heave my heart into my mouth. I love your majesty according to my bond; no more nor less.” So said Cordelia, the youngest of King Lear’s daughters, when the narcissistic monarch sought some sycophancy before dividing up his kingdom.\n\nCordelia the character was, of course, a work of Shakespeare’s imagination. However, she endures in my mind as the antithesis of what we have come to expect from Trump, Putin, Biden, Boris Johnson, Churchill, Blair, Kennedy, Clinton, Netanyahu, Musk, Bezos et al.\n\n If we flipped it entirely, we should really let the children be in charge.\n\nWe’d eat nothing but Nutella with every meal, but you’d be guaranteed wars would quickly end, the hungry would be fed, and there’d be no such thing as genocide.\n\nWhat is absolutely certain is that they could not do any worse.","summary":"Perhaps the best people to be in power are those who do not seek it out, writes

China","text":"WASHINGTON: The US in recent days suspended licenses for nuclear equipment suppliers to sell to China’s power plants, according to four people familiar with the matter, as the two countries engage in a damaging trade war. \n\nThe suspensions were issued by the US Department of Commerce, the people said, and affect export licenses for parts and equipment used with nuclear power plants. \n\nNuclear equipment suppliers are among a wide range of companies whose sales have been restricted over the past two weeks as the US-China trade war shifted from negotiating tariffs to throttling each other’s supply chains. It is unclear whether a Thursday call between US President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping would affect the suspensions. \n\nThe US and China agreed on May 12 to roll back triple digit, tit-for-tat tariffs for 90 days, but the truce between the two biggest economies quickly went south, with the US claiming China reneged on terms related to rare earth elements, and China accusing the US of “abusing export control measures” by warning that using Huawei Ascend AI chips anywhere in the world violated US export controls. After Thursday’s call, further talks on key issues were expected. \n\nThe US Department of Commerce did not respond to a request for comment on the nuclear equipment restrictions. On May 28, a spokesperson said the department was reviewing exports of strategic significance to China. \n\n“In some cases, Commerce has suspended existing export licenses or imposed additional license requirements while the review is pending,” the spokesperson said in a statement. The Chinese Embassy in Washington did not immediately respond to a request for comment. \n\nUS nuclear equipment suppliers include Westinghouse and Emerson. \n\nWestinghouse, whose technology is used in over 400 nuclear reactors around the world, and Emerson, which provides measurement and other tools for the nuclear industry, did not respond to requests for comment. \n\nThe suspensions affect business worth hundreds of millions of dollars, two of the sources said. \n\nThey also coincide with Chinese restrictions on critical metals threatening supply chains for manufacturers worldwide, especially America’s Big Three automakers. \n\nReuters could not determine whether the new restrictions were tied to the trade war, or if and how quickly they might be reinstated.

Bondi described him as a full-time smuggler who made more than 100 trips, transporting women, children, and MS-13 gang-affiliated persons throughout the United States.

TRUMP'S BORDER WALL EXPANSION MOVES FORWARD IN SEVERAL CRITICAL AREAS: 'CRISIS IS NOT YET OVER' Overall, ICE has arrested over 100,000 illegal immigrants since Trump took office. Over the weekend, ICE officials and local authorities in South Carolina raided a \"cartel after-party\" where 80 illegal aliens were arrested, including two alleged \"high-level cartel members\" of the Mexican cartel Los Zetas and the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua, according to The Post and Courier. According to the outlet, one of the individuals arrested, a Honduran national, has been named in an international murder case. The New York Times also reported that deportation flights rose to the highest level yet under the Trump administration. This comes as ICE announced this week that it had deported 142 criminal aliens to Mexico from the Houston area, including child predators, gang members, human traffickers and one individual convicted of making terroristic threats. On Monday, ICE announced that, working with U.S. Customs and Border Protection, it had made a \"game-changing\" seizure of 50,000 kilograms of meth ingredients destined for the Sinaloa Cartel.

Following Musk’s exit from the administration last week as a “special government employee,” the tech mogul had grown increasingly outspoken against the president’s signature legislation, claiming it would “bankrupt” the country.\n\n“Time to drop the really big bomb,” Musk tweeted on Thursday afternoon. “@realDonaldTrump is in the Epstein files. That is the real reason they have not been made public. Have a nice day, DJT!”\n\nHe followed up that tweet by adding: “Mark this post for the future. The truth will come out.”\n\nMoments before Musk dropped his bombshell post, Patel had spent a significant portion of his Rogan interview attempting to convince the conspiracy-peddling podcast host that Epstein did indeed commit suicide. Patel and his deputy director Dan Bongino – both of whom had previously supported the theory that Epstein was murdered in jail – have taken heavy criticism from right-wing influencers for now insisting that all evidence suggests Epstein killed himself.\n\nWhile Rogan began wondering if Patel and the FBI had footage of Epstein’s island residence, the show’s producer jumped in to let them both know that Musk had just flung out his allegation about Trump.\n\n“Jesus Christ,” Rogan gasped in shock.\n\n“I’m not participating in any of that conversation between Elon and Trump,” Patel muttered.\n\nReading from the tweets, Rogan then said “someone should take his phone away” and that it was “crazy” for Musk to accuse the president of being on the supposed client list of the deceased sex offender.\n\n“How does he know? Does he know that Donald Trump’s in the Epstein files? Does he have access to the Epstein files?” Rogan then asked Patel directly.\n\n“I don’t know how he would, but I’m just staying out of the Trump-Elon thing,” the FBI director shot back. “That’s way outside my lane.”\n\nAs a shocked Rogan wondered “what the f**k are they doing,” Patel reiterated that he knows his “lane and this ain’t it.” Rogan, meanwhile, expressed concern over the amount of time that Musk spends posting to the social media platform he owns.\n\n“I understand he owns Twitter, I think it’s bad for your mental health,” the podcaster concluded. “I think posting things publicly all day and arguing with people all day is bad for you.”\n\nBeginning in the 1980s, Epstein and Trump began hanging out in the same social circles and soon became friends, partying and dining together at their palatial estates. They posed together for photographs and were “each other’s wingmen” at one point in time. “He’s a lot of fun to be with,” Trump said about Epstein in a 2002 interview. “It is even said that he likes beautiful women as much as I do, and many of them are on the younger side.”\n\nThe pair would have a falling out in 2004. According to one Trump aide, Trump banned Epstein from Mar-a-Lago after he asked a young female worker for a massage. Following Epstein’s 2019 arrest on sex trafficking charges, Trump said he was “not a fan of his” while one of the president’s lawyers insisted they had “no relationship.”","url":"https://uk.news.yahoo.com/kash-patel-live-wtf-moment-211547471.html","image":"https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_independent_577/3fdba0065331ded3ded67d2a159d0081","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-06-06 23:51:14","author":"Justin Baragona","authors":["Justin Baragona"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.284},{"id":328924972,"title":"The Story w/ Martha MacCallum - Friday, June 6","text":"to top close Video This video is playing in picture-in-picture.\n\n Your Preview Pass expires in 00:00 Don't have a TV subscription?\n\nFull Episode June 06, 2025 38:16 \n FULL EPISODE\n\n EXP 7 DAYS\n The Story w/ Martha MacCallum - Friday, June 6 \n Donald Trump, Elon Musk, China\n Tags MOST RECENT EPISODES | VIDEOSTHE STORY WITH MARTHA MACCALLUM | FULL EPISODES","summary":"Donald Trump, Elon Musk, China","url":"https://www.foxnews.com/video/6373970163112","image":"https://a57.foxnews.com/cf-images.us-east-1.prod.boltdns.net/v1/static/990505083001/6cca1bc9-1c68-4e48-9a98-caac7b866896/1bf320ae-a103-4d47-aa15-a07f87deccfc/1280x720/match/1024/512/image.jpg?pubId=694940094001?ve=1&tl=1","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-06-06 23:49:22","author":null,"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.154},{"id":328921656,"title":"Russia's large-scale attacks on Ukrainian cities leave trail of destruction","text":"A barrage of Russian strikes on Ukraine early Friday left a trail of destruction visible across several cities in the country, where many buildings and properties were destroyed.Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said Friday's strikes killed at least four people and injured dozens. The attacks targeted the capital, Kyiv, the Ternopil region in the northwest of the country, and the city of Lutsk. One person was killed in Lutsk, and several were injured following a Russian missile and drone strike on the northwestern city in the Volyn region.According to the Ukrainian authorities, 15 attack drones and six cruise missiles were directed at the city in the early hours of Friday, triggering explosions and structural collapses in several neighbourhoods. Many residents reported three powerful blasts, likely due to direct hits or the work of air defence systems. \"It started around 4:30 a.m. I saw with my own eyes how things were flying there and exploding. I was standing right here, and the blast wave pushed us into the hallway. Most people ran to the shelter.\" Yevheniia Kamienieva, a resident of Lutsk, said.\"According to eyewitnesses who were outside, since unfortunately we don't have functional shelters here, it was a missile strike,\" Alisa Yerofieieva, head of the condominium association in the city, said.Rescuers in the city said at least 16 people sustained various injuries from the attacks, which sparked numerous fires. Ukraine's State Emergency Service (SES) reported that the latest Russian strikes had targeted regions across Ukraine, including Kyiv, where three of those killed were rescuers.With the explosions lasting for several hours overnight, many people in the Ukrainian capital took shelter in metro stations. The SES said several administrative buildings, industrial facilities, and vehicles were also damaged. Strikes were also reported in the city of Sloviansk, according to Donetsk region police. The police said Russian drones hit Sloviansk, damaging buildings, over a dozen vehicles and a service station. Fortunately, no casualties were reported, the police said.The strikes, according to Russia's defense ministry, were in retaliation for \"terrorist acts by the Kyiv regime.\" Russia claimed it targeted only military installations, something Kyiv disputes with evidence of mounting civilian casualties on Ukraine's side. Moscow's attacks came just days after US President Donald Trump said Russian President Vladimir Putin had said \"he will have to respond\" following Ukraine's Operation Spider's Web, which targeted Russian warplanes at military airbases last weekend. The covert operation was described as one for the “history books” by Ukraine’s president, who blamed Russia's refusal of a proposed ceasefire in May for the latest escalation in the three-and-a-half-year-old war.","summary":"Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said Friday's strikes killed at least four people and injured dozens.
