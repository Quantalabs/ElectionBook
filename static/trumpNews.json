{"offset":0,"number":50,"available":12605,"news":[{"id":280430224,"title":"Europe needs shared defense capabilities","text":"By Lars Frolund and Fiona Murray\n\nCOPENHAGEN/BOSTON – Following Donald Trump’s victory in the US presidential election, Europe has recognized the need to strengthen its security and bolster its economic resilience. European defense industry leaders have called for more investment in the sector, and defense ministries are spending more on science and technology to ensure their countries’ readiness for the wars of today and tomorrow.\n\nBut it is not enough for each country to act alone. The European Union and the United Kingdom must approach technological innovation with the goal of building shared defense capabilities. Recent moves in this direction are promising: the German defense company Rheinmetall announced that it would open a new factory in the UK in 2027, as part of a landmark defense agreement between the two countries. The UK’s BAE Systems, Italy’s Leonardo, and Japan’s Mitsubishi Heavy Industries are collaborating to develop a next-generation fighter aircraft. Germany’s Helsing, which specializes in AI-based defense software, is working closely with Swedish defense giant Saab and plans to expanded its presence in the UK.\n\nFocusing on collective, rather than national, interests would enable large economies of scale. Each country could build on its comparative advantages – both in technological innovation and military capabilities – and thus strengthen European resilience for decades to come. This would also ensure that Europe serves as a strong partner to the US, contributing its unique defense expertise and industrial base.\n\nAdvanced European technological capabilities also form the foundation of economic prosperity, as reflected in Mario Draghi’s recent report on the future of European competitiveness and the European Commission’s policy agenda. But national policies continue to focus on technological sovereignty, with the goal of strengthening and protecting domestic industry, at the expense of sharing resources and information with allies.\n\nThis is the wrong approach. The proliferation of critical technologies means that even the strongest European economies cannot build an advantage on their own. Moreover, each country going it alone would stifle growth opportunities by inadvertently limiting exports and reducing market size below what is economically efficient or desirable.\n\nGaining a technological edge requires building European alliances that promote and protect shared capabilities. This collective statecraft would allow smaller economies such as Denmark, Norway, and Estonia, which are home to innovative entrepreneurs working in quantum, space, and cyber technologies, to contribute to Europe’s sovereignty. These countries are too small to support a broad-based tech sector, and working more closely with European allies would help them build their industrial base and boost domestic economic growth.\n\nThe idea is far from new. During World War II, the British shared extraordinary advances in radar with the United States under the auspices of the Tizard Mission. Today, NATO allies are developing drones with Ukraine. But to adopt a more consistent approach to pursuing collective sovereignty over tech outside of wartime, European governments must consider two factors: dependency and vulnerability.\n\nBecoming a leader in critical technologies requires mutual dependence in terms of expertise, geographic advantage, and cumulative production. For example, quantum-computing systems rely on expertise in a wide range of areas, from superconducting materials to cryogenic engineering, which is usually spread across countries, highlighting the importance of alliances. Other innovations, such as space-launch technology, are largely dependent on geography: Norway’s Andøya spaceport, inside the Arctic Circle, will be essential for European space sovereignty. Lastly, some countries, after years of investment, have a cumulative advantage in production, such as Taiwan with semiconductors. Here, well-established manufacturing operations in Germany and the UK could be complementary.\n\nEqually important is the question of vulnerability, which can stem from dependence. The war in Ukraine, for example, has highlighted Europe’s vulnerability to Russia’s control over natural gas (as well as supply-chain vulnerabilities in drone components). As the energy transition accelerates, the region will need to ensure that it can access critical material inputs and technology – which requires a shared effort.\n\nMultilateral institutions can facilitate such collaboration. For example, the AUKUS security alliance, established in 2021 by Australia, the UK, and the U.S., is committed to delivering advanced capabilities and ensuring license-free defense trade. Likewise, NATO should enable the sharing of non-military technologies.\n\nFortunately, some progress is already being made on this front. Last year, NATO established an innovation fund to invest in technologies that advance security goals. More recently, the European Commission launched a Trusted Investors Network to remove barriers to co-investing in breakthrough technologies with the European Innovation Council Fund.\n\nAt its core, collective economic statecraft means recognizing that one country might be better served by supporting industry in another. Only by developing a collaborative framework that enables capital from across Europe (and the US) to be channeled to the most promising ventures can Europe gain the technological advantages that will help it meet important military challenges.\n\nSuch bold action would resolve a fundamental tension that has beset discussions of national security and economic competitiveness in Europe. Shifting the conversation from defending the homeland or strengthening its competitiveness to a discussion of how to advance collective interests would lead to measures that both promote and protect Europe’s sovereignty and economy. But first, each European country must be clear about its technological, geographic, and production advantages, and how it can best contribute to collective peace and prosperity.\n\nLars Frolund, a board member of the European Innovation Council, is a lecturer at MIT and a strategic adviser to the NATO Innovation Fund.

The suit alleges Musk violated federal securities laws, enabling him to purchase shares of Twitter at artificially low prices before his $44 billion takeover of the social media site. Musk has called the SEC \"just another weaponized institution doing political dirty work.\"Musk started buying shares of Twitter, which he later renamed X, in early 2022. By mid-March, he'd acquired ownership of more than 5% of the company's outstanding stock, according to the SEC filing. He was required to file a report with the SEC disclosing his purchases, but the lawsuit alleges he failed to do so in a \"timely\" manner, allowing him to underpay other investors by at least $150 million for shares they bought during that period. Musk waited until April 4, 2022, 11 days after the report was due, to publicly disclose his beneficial ownership in an SEC report, the commission says.\"Investors who sold Twitter common stock during this period did so at artificially low prices and thus suffered substantial economic harm,\" the SEC alleges in its suit.The SEC says it wants the court to order Musk to pay \"disgorgement of unjust enrichment as a result of his violation.\" The SEC is also seeking civil penalties.Musk responded to news of the suit on X on Tuesday night, calling the SEC a \"totally broken organization.\"\"They spend their time on s--- like this when there are so many actual crimes that go unpunished,\" Musk wrote.In July 2022, Musk tried to pull out of the deal to buy Twitter, but the company sued to hold him to their agreement, and he completed the takeover in October of that year.Musk has tangled with the SEC before. The SEC in 2018 filed a complaint alleging that Musk had misled Tesla investors. In 2023, the SEC said it was seeking a court order to compel Musk to testify as part of its investigation into his purchase of X. He later testified for the investigation. The SEC lawsuit comes shortly before chairman Gary Gensler's planned resignation from the commission. It's not clear if the new administration will continue the suit. President-elect Donald Trump has selected Paul Atkins as the new SEC head. Musk is a prominent Trump backer and Republican donor, and has been selected by Trump to lead the Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE.","summary":"The SEC has sued billionaire X owner Elon

of terrorism","text":"US President Joe Biden has announced plans to lift America's designation of Cuba as a state sponsor of terrorism as part of a deal facilitated by the Catholic Church to free political prisoners on the island.\n\nThe move, which he has notified congress of, will leave just North Korea, Syria and Iran on the list.\n\nSenior US administration officials, who previewed the announcement on the condition of anonymity, said \"many dozens\" of political prisoners and others considered by the US to be unjustly detained would be released by the end of the Biden administration — at noon on January 20, local time.\n\nUnder the deal, the US would also ease some economic pressure on Cuba, as well as a 2017 memorandum issued by then-president Donald Trump toughening the US posture toward Cuba.\n\n\"In taking these steps to bolster the ongoing dialogue between the government of Cuba and the Catholic Church, President Biden is also honouring the wisdom and counsel that has been provided to him by many world leaders, especially in Latin America, who have encouraged him to take these actions, on how best to advance the human rights of the Cuban people,\" White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said in a statement.\n\nTrump likely to reverse decision\n\nThe determination by the outgoing one-term Democrat is likely to be reversed as early as next week after Trump takes office and secretary of state-designate Marco Rubio assumes the position of America's top diplomat.\n\nMr Rubio, whose family left Cuba in the 1950s before the communist revolution that brought Fidel Castro to power, has long been a proponent of sanctions against the communist island.\n\nMr Rubio will appear before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee on Wednesday for his confirmation hearing and is expected to address his Cuban roots in his testimony.\n\nTrump has also appointed Mauricio Claver-Carone, a former White House National Security Council aide and strong supporter of sanctions against Cuba, as his special envoy to Latin America.\n\nIn the final days of Trump's first administration, on January 11, 2021, the White House reinstated the designation, which had been reversed during the period of rapprochement between Cuba and the United States during Barack Obama's second term in office.\n\nIn doing so, the Trump administration cited Cuba's support for Venezuela's leader Nicolas Maduro and its refusal to extradite Colombian rebels to Colombia, among other issues, including its continued harbouring of wanted Americans.\n\nThe move to designate Cuba was one of several foreign policy moves Trump made in the final days of his first term.\n\nAbout six months after Trump designated Cuba as a terror sponsor, the Biden administration imposed new sanctions on island officials and the national revolutionary police after hundreds of Cubans were arrested during demonstrations in Havana and other cities to protest shortages, power outages and government policies.\n\nThey were the first such protests since the 1990s.\n\nHuman rights groups and activists, including the US Conference of Catholic Bishops, have been pressing the Biden administration to lift the designation to ease the suffering of Cuban people who feel the impact of Cuba's economic isolation.\n\nCuba expresses gratitude\n\nCuba's government recognised Mr Biden's announcement and expressed its gratitude.\n\n\"Despite its limited scope, this is a decision that points to the right direction and is in line with the sustained and firm demand by the government and the people of Cuba,\" the country's foreign ministry said in a press release.\n\n\"The decision announced today by the United States, rectifies, in a very limited way, some aspects of a cruel and unjust policy.\"\n\nMr Biden, in a national security memorandum issued on Tuesday, certified that Cuba had not provided any support for international terrorism during the past six months and had provided the administration with assurances that it would not support acts of terrorism in the future.\n\nThe move comes after the Biden administration in May removed Cuba from the State Department's short list of countries that it deems less than fully cooperative against violent groups.\n\nThe Cuban foreign ministry said the government was conscious the incoming US government could reverse the decision, but that it would remain \"ready to develop a respectful relation with that country, based on dialogue and non-interference in the internal affairs of both countries, despite the differences\".\n\nRepublicans denounce move\n\nTexas Republican senator Ted Cruz quickly denounced Mr Biden's move.\n\n\"Today's decision is unacceptable on its merits,\" Mr Cruz said in a statement.\n\n\"The terrorism advanced by the Cuban regime has not ceased. I will work with President Trump and my colleagues to immediately reverse and limit the damage from the decision.\"\n\nRepresentative Carlos Gimenez, a Florida Republican, criticised the move and predicted that Trump would quickly reverse Mr Biden's decision.\n\n\"President Biden is a pathetic coward,\" Mr Gimenez posted on X.\n\n\"Come January 20th, there will be a NEW SHERIFF in town & President Trump alongside Secretary of State @SenMarcoRubio will not only put #Cuba BACK on the list but PULVERIZE the regime once & for all!\"","summary":"In a move expected to be reversed by Donald Trump, US President Joe Biden is moving to lift the United States's designation of Cuba as a state sponsor of terrorism as part of a deal designed to free political prisoners on the island.","url":"https://www.abc.net.au/news/2025-01-15/biden-to-lift-cuba-state-sponsor-of-terrorism-designation/104819102","image":"https://live-production.wcms.abc-cdn.net.au/d14d8d5f8ff9d98a9a9943d3a7d9abb5?impolicy=wcms_crop_resize&cropH=2810&cropW=4996&xPos=4&yPos=84&width=862&height=485","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-01-15 00:54:35","author":"ABC News","authors":["ABC News"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"AU","sentiment":-0.015},{"id":280429604,"title":"Musk sued over buying Twitter shares at artificially low prices by US finance regulator","text":"Elon Musk is being sued for failing to disclose his purchase of more than 5% of Twitter stock in a timely fashion.\n\nThe world’s richest man bought the stock in March 2022 and the complaint by the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) said the delay allowed him to continue buying Twitter stock at artificially low prices.\n\nIn papers filed in Washington DC federal court, the SEC said the move allowed Mr Musk to underpay by at least $150m (£123m).\n\nThe commission wants Mr Musk to pay a civil fine and give up profits he was not entitled to.\n\nIn response to the lawsuit a lawyer for the multi-billionaire said: “Mr Musk has done nothing wrong and everyone sees this sham for what it is.”\n\nAn SEC rule requires investors to disclose within 10 calendar days when they cross a 5% ownership threshold.\n\nThe SEC said Mr Musk did not disclose his state until 4 April 2022, 11 days after the deadline – by which point he owned more than 9% of Twitter’s shares.\n\nTwitter’s share price rose by more than 27% following Mr Musk’s disclosure, the SEC added.\n\nMr Musk later purchased Twitter for $44bn (£36bn) in October 2022 and renamed the social media site X.\n\nSince the election of Donald Trump, Mr Musk has been put in charge of leading a newly created Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) alongside former Republican presidential candidate Vivek Ramaswamy.\n\nThe president-elect said the department would work to reduce government bureaucracy, slash excess regulations, cut wasteful expenditures and restructure federal agencies.","summary":"Elon Musk is being sued for failing to disclose his purchase of more than 5% of Twitter stock in a timely fashion.

However, investor sentiment often reflects policy expectations, with current optimism centered around potential tax cuts (or at least not increases) and deregulation, while the threat of tariffs and trade wars casts a pessimistic shadow.\n\nNeedless to say, there is plenty of uncertainty These measures could have a big impact on corporate profits, economic growth and market performance. Thus far, the Financials sector has emerged as a top performer since Election Day, benefiting from the likelihood of reduced regulation moving forward.\n\nEconomic Growth and Resilient Corporate Earnings\n\nThe U.S. economy continues to show resilience. Q4 GDP growth is projected at a healthy 2.7%, while job creation remains strong, with factory activity also improving. Companies like Eaton PLC (ETN), a leading power equipment manufacturer, and Caterpillar (CAT), a global construction equipment giant benefiting from excellent results and investor enthusiasm. Both firms are well-positioned for long-term growth, bolstered by infrastructure spending and a regulatory environment favorable to industrial demand.\n\nPotential Risks: Tariffs and Inflation\n\nDespite the optimism, uncertainties loom. President-elect Trump’s proposal for a 25% tariff on imports from Mexico and Canada has raised concerns about supply chain disruptions and rising inflation. While these tariffs could negatively impact some manufacturers, many view them as negotiation tactics designed to bolster American production and competitiveness. Companies with U.S.-centric operations are better positioned to navigate these challenges, presenting opportunities for strategic investments, while we think both Eaton and Caterpillar have seasoned management teams capable of maneuvering through any trade turbulence.\n\nMORE FOR YOU\n\nApple Brings Back iPhone 15 Pro For First Time—At Lower Price\n\nNew Amazon Ransomware Attack—‘Recovery Impossible’ Without Payment\n\nSamsung Confirms Galaxy S25 Ultra Pre-Order, Release Dates And Special Offers\n\nValue Investing: A Proven Strategy for Long-Term Success\n\nNavigating post-election market dynamics requires a disciplined, value-focused investment strategy.

It depends whom you ask.\n\nThe 66 members of the Democratic–Farmer–Labor Party (DFL), Minnesota’s affiliate of the national Democratic Party, elected to its lower chamber did not show up; these Democrats argue that work can’t begin until after a January 28 special election takes place to fill an open seat in a blue district.\n\nWith that seat unfilled, the Republicans lead the chamber 67-66. It’s a temporary advantage the party has vowed to use to try unseating Democratic state representative Rep. Brad Tabke, which could help them cement the GOP’s interim edge for the remainder of the term. Perhaps more importantly, Republicans used the Democrats’ absence on Tuesday to vote in a Republican House speaker.\n\nWhether that stealth vote for House speaker was legal is an open question: Minnesota’s secretary of state, the state legislature’s presiding officer, had already concluded legislative business for the day on account of the DFL absences—which prevented Republicans from meeting the quorum threshold of 68 members. Republicans ignored the secretary and held the speaker vote anyway. On Tuesday evening, the secretary of state said he intended to challenge the speaker vote in court.\n\nMinnesota Democrats’ dilemma is much broader than control over one seat or a brief period in the minority. If the Republicans’ speaker vote is deemed lawful, they’ll have control over committee leadership and the speakership—and thus legislative priorities—for the next two years, even if the chamber becomes tied after the blue district’s special election in two weeks. On a broader scale, Democrats say that Republicans’ proceeding without a quorum is a continuation of the national party’s efforts to disenfranchise voters, such as through Donald Trump’s 2020 election denialism, as well as recent efforts by North Carolina’s conservative state Supreme Court majority to unseat a Democrat elected to the bench.\n\n“A little over a week ago our nation marked the four-year anniversary of January 6th, when Donald Trump inspired a violent mob to storm the US Capitol and overturn a free and fair election. As we’ve seen in the start of 2025, Republican attempts to disenfranchise voters don’t stop there,” Democratic National Committee Chair Jaime Harrison said in a statement to Mother Jones. “Minnesota Republicans are now attempting to subvert the will of the people and ram through Republican leadership in the state House when they did not win a majority of seats.”\n\nRepublicans did not win a majority of Minnesota’s state House seats in November. Instead, each party won 67 of 134 seats, which was expected to result in the DFL and Republican parties governing through a power-sharing agreement. (The Minnesota state Senate, which is evenly split 33-33 due to a recent death, is using a similar governing structure until their own January 28 special election.)\n\nBut over the last three months, two Democrats’ state House seats have come under scrutiny. Democrats (temporarily) lost the first seat due to their own unforced error. In one liberal district, Democrats elected a representative who had not met a requirement to live in the district for at least six months prior to the general election. After a December court ruling, that representative resigned. Though the party is likely to regain the seat after the special election, bringing the House split back to 67 legislators per party, insiders say it would take a true majority of 68 or more members to retake leadership.\n\nThe other seat at issue is that of incumbent Rep. Tabke, a Democrat who won by 14 votes. After the election, officials discovered they’d accidentally discarded about 20 absentee ballots before counting them, putting Tabke’s win on hold. But on Tuesday morning, a court upheld his win, after hearing testimonies from multiple Tabke voters whose ballots were thrown out. “Brad Tabke remains the candidate with the most votes legally cast,” the judge wrote. “This election is not invalid.”\n\nStill, state Republicans say they do not yet recognize Tabke’s win, and may try to force another special election, this one in a competitive district that could net them another seat. Rep. Lisa Demuth, the GOP lawmaker ostensibly voted House speaker, said in a statement that the state’s constitution empowers each legislative chamber to judge election returns, and that the party will “evaluate this lengthy ruling and consider options in the coming days.”\n\nRepublicans also argue that they did have quorum on Tuesday afternoon. While legislative work typically requires a quorum of at least 68 of 134 members present, Republicans say that until the open seat is filled in late January, 67 members fulfills the quorum requirement. With that purported majority, they can try to make an even bigger one.\n\n“Everyone hoped it wouldn’t come to this,” says Minnesota Democratic-Farmer-Labor spokesperson Darwin Forsyth, “but denying quorum is the only tool that we have to prevent Republicans from expelling a duly-elected Democrat from the legislature.”","summary":"Legislative business in Minnesota&#8217;s 2025-2026 state House session began Tuesday at noon Central Time; or perhaps it hasn&#8217;t begun at all.

It was a stark reminder that, even as Biden uses the last days of his administration to attempt to safeguard the environment, climate change is already helping to exacerbate natural disasters.\n\nInstead, Biden spoke next to screens featuring towering peaks, desert vistas and an array of plant and animal life.\n\n“I was hoping we were going to do this in place,” the president said. “This is as close as we could get.”\n\nBiden formally created the Chuckwalla National Monument, in Southern California near Joshua Tree National Park, and the Sáttítla Highlands National Monument, in Northern California.\n\nThe declarations bar oil and natural gas drilling, as well as mining and other exploration and production initiatives, on the 624,000-acre (2,400-square-kilometer) Chuckwalla site, and roughly 225,000 acres (800 square kilometers) near the California-Oregon border.\n\nThe protected area encompasses natural wonders including the Painted Canyon of Mecca Hills and Alligator Rock, and is home to 50-plus rare species of plants and animals like the desert bighorn sheep and the Chuckwalla lizard — which the monument is named for, the White House said in a statement.\n\nAt the event, Biden talked about taking his children to national monuments around the country yearly when they were young to “witness the majesty, the beauty.”\n\n“Our national wonders are the heart and soul of this nation,” he said. “It’s a birthright we pass on from generation to generation. ”\n\nThe monuments becoming realities honor past tribal requests. Many Native American tribes and environmental groups have pushed for designation of the Chuckwalla National Monument, while the Pit River Tribe has worked to get the federal government to designate the Sáttítla Highlands National Monument.\n\nBiden joked about being careful not to mispronounce Sáttítla, then still struggled to pronounce it. When he sat down to sign the formal acts, he simply referred to it as the “highlands” monument — meaning he didn’t have to give it another try.\n\nThe designations are part of a larger Biden administration effort to conserve at least 30% of U.S. lands and waters by 2030. They follow Biden’s recent move banning new offshore oil and gas drilling in most U.S. coastal waters, including in California.\n\nThat was an attempt to thwart possible efforts by the incoming Republican administration to expand offshore drilling, but is also an order President-elect Donald Trump has vowed to quickly reverse.","summary":"President Joe Biden designated two sites in California as national monuments that will honor Native American tribes while shielding picturesque mountains and deserts from mining and energy development.","url":"https://www.twincities.com/2025/01/14/new-national-monuments-california/","image":"https://www.twincities.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Biden_19692.jpg?w=1024&h=684","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-01-15 00:37:14","author":"Associated Press","authors":["Associated Press"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.391},{"id":280428914,"title":"Special counsel report on Trump election interference case released","text":"Special counsel report on Trump election interference case released\n Former special counsel Jack Smith's report has been released on his investigation into then-President Donald Trump's alleged efforts to overturn the results of the 2020 election.

Bennie Thompson of Mississippi says if President Biden offered him a preemptive pardon for his role in leading the investigation into then-President Donald Trump's role in the 2021 Capitol riot, he'd accept it. Thompson, who was the chair of the House select committee investigating Jan. 6, embraced the idea of a pardon in an interview with CBS News, saying Tuesday, \"I'm from a part of the country where speaking your opinion used to cost you your life.\"\"When I hear someone about to be sworn into the presidency of the United States say he wants to lock you up for doing your job, I believe it,\" he said of Trump, now the president-elect.\"And so, if for Bennie Thompson, that is something that's offered to me, I will accept it,\" the Democrat added, \"because there are a lot of people who take this person at his word, and I don't want him to weaponize (the) government against people for doing their job.\"President Biden has said he's continuing to weigh possible blanket preemptive pardons for prominent critics and political enemies of Trump, a move that could shield them from prosecution by the incoming administration. The president has not said who might receive such a pardon.The president-elect has openly threatened members of the now-defunct House committee.In an interview with NBC News' \"Meet the Press\" last month, the incoming president accused members of the panel of destroying evidence and committing \"a major crime\" during their investigation. He said that \"everybody\" who served on the committee \"should go to jail.\"Asked Tuesday about Trump's claim that the committee had destroyed evidence, Thompson noted that House Republicans have been conducting their own investigation of the select committee's work for two years. \"They've not come up with anything,\" Thompson said.But Thompson appears to be the only member of the select committee who would welcome a pardon ahead of Trump's inauguration on Jan. 20. Several of the panel's members have rejected the idea, arguing they don't need a pardon because they committed no wrongdoing in the course of their work.Rep. Pete Aguilar, a California Democrat, told reporters on Tuesday, \"I stand by the work that we did. We didn't do anything wrong. I don't think a pardon is necessary.\"Democratic Rep. Jamie Raskin of Maryland said he didn't know what the right answer was when asked at a Politico Live event about the possibility Mr. Biden could pardon members of the select committee. He argued that \"in any just world,\" they wouldn't need a pardon because they hadn't committed any crimes.He also noted that the Constitution's \"speech and debate\" clause protects members against criminal prosecution and civil lawsuits related to their legislative work.Some of the panel's other former members have discouraged pardons.Sen. Adam Schiff, Democrat of California, told CBS News in December that he did not think the idea of a blanket pardon \"of any kind\" was a good idea, and would recommend against it.Former Rep. Adam Kinzinger, one of two Republicans who served on the panel, said on CNN this month that he did not want a pardon. \"I understand the theory behind it because Donald Trump has clearly said he's going to go after everybody,\" he said. \"...But the second you take a pardon, it looks like you're guilty of something. I'm guilty of nothing besides bringing the truth to the American people and in the process, embarrassing Donald Trump.\"Mr. Biden awarded Thompson and the select committee's vice chair, former GOP Rep. Liz Cheney, a Presidential Citizens Medal, the second-highest civilian award, at a ceremony at the White House this month.","summary":"Rep.

-\n\nOnce Trump takes office, the law's implementation will fall to his attorney general, who could choose not to enforce it, or stall, defying Congress's overwhelming support for the legislation.\n\nThe Trump administration might also approach the Republican majority in Congress to modify the law, potentially giving ByteDance more time to find a buyer or devise alternative solutions.\n\n- Alternatives -\n\nOnce banned, the assumption is that TikTok users will move to other apps, like Instagram Reels and YouTube shorts, TikTok copycats that have grown and will directly benefit from their rival's demise.\n\nElon Musk's X could also benefit and the tycoon has made it known that he wants his platform, formerly Twitter, to more closely resemble TikTok, with video content and shopping features.\n\nTrump has expressed concern that a ban would primarily advantage Meta-owned Instagram, which may explain Mark Zuckerberg's recent public support for Trump.\n\nSome American content creators have already migrated to Xiaohongshu (Red Note), another Chinese social media app that recently topped the Apple App Store downloads.\n\n- Investor rescue? -\n\nSeveral potential buyers have emerged, including a group led by Frank McCourt, former owner of the Los Angeles Dodgers, even if ByteDance has ruled out a sale for now.\n\nHis partner in the bid, Canadian businessman Kevin O'Leary, recently golfed with Trump and reported the president-elect's desire to use the TikTok saga as leverage in US-China relations.\n\nA report that the Chinese authorities would be open to a buyout by Musk was denied by TikTok.\n\nFormer Activision Blizzard CEO Bobby Kotick also remains interested in buying TikTok, according to the Information.\n\nFor now, TikTok's fate rests with the Supreme Court, with the company lawyers asking the nine justices for a delay to any ban to provide \"breathing space\" for a solution.\n\n\"Nobody knows what they can do and who's going to do it until they hear from the Supreme Court,\" Trump told Newsmax on Monday.\n\n(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)","summary":"TikTok faces an imminent shutdown in the United States after Congress passed a law last year forcing its Chinses owner ByteDance to either sell the platform or close it by this Sunday.","url":"https://nation.lk/online/from-ban-to-buyout-what-next-for-tiktok-in-us-291726.html","image":"https://c.ndtvimg.com/2024-05/4sivso_tiktok_625x300_17_May_24.jpeg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-01-15 00:30:09","author":null,"language":"en","source_country":"lk","sentiment":-0.299},{"id":280429766,"title":"Biden admin’s cap on GPU exports may hit India's AI ambitions","text":"The outgoing US administration’s proposed rule to restrict import of graphics processing units (GPUs)—needed for running heavy artificial intelligence models and applications—may hit India’s ambitions in this area in the long term, officials and experts told ET. Restricted access to advanced AI chips may slow innovation and development, while licensing needs could raise costs and introduce delays, they added. The rule released January 13 may increase compliance complexities for companies like RIL, which recently placed an order for Nvidia GPUs. It could put data centre providers such as Tata Communications, Yotta Data Services, E2E Networks and Ctrl S, which are expanding to offer AI cloud computing, at a disadvantage relative to US rivals.The framework became effective from the date of release while still inviting public comments for potential adjustments, experts said.Government officials have called the move harsh since the India AI Mission will now come under the total country compute power applicable for India, requiring the country to apply for a licence.117245440“It may cause some near-term hiccups on the compliance side,” a senior government official told ET. The AI consumption is well within the cap as of now, the person said.The country cap imposed under the new rule is 50,000 GPUs or equivalent capacity. The government is currently sourcing close to 10,000 GPUs under the India AI Mission. The number may go up in the future.Also Read: Nvidia dominates GPU offerings in government’s Rs 10,000-crore AI mission“Large-scale AI data centres, requiring several hundred thousand GPUs, may be delayed or scaled down, putting global companies at a competitive advantage over Indian enterprises,” said Ashok Chandak, president, India Electronics and Semiconductor Association. “However, small-scale setups could still enable experimentation, innovation, and restricted model development.”Uncertainty over licences and trade negotiations could challenge India’s ambitions for large-scale AI hardware deployment, he said.Mukesh Ambani-led Reliance aims to build India's largest AI data centre, powered by Nvidia’s most advanced GB200 GPUs, in a record 24 months. The GB200 GPU is six times more powerful than its predecessor, the H100.“Even if (Reliance-owned) Jio can secure GPUs, the quantity may be limited, potentially delaying or hindering their ability to scale their project,” said Sajai Singh, partner, JSA Advocates & Solicitors. “The mandatory licensing process would also likely introduce additional bureaucratic hurdles and costs, which could further slow the development of their GPU clusters.”There is also uncertainty over how countries will oversee equitable distribution and competition among large and small native companies, experts said.Reliance, Tata Communications, Yotta and Ctrl S didn’t respond to queries.Also Read: Vendors offer top GPUs as MeitY decides on Rs 10,000-crore AI mission tenderThe regulations divide the world into three groups—the first comprising 20 countries such as Australia, UK, France, Germany, Sweden, Switzerland have unrestricted access to AI chips, while 20 others including China, Russia, North Korea and Iran will have no access. For the remaining 140 nations, including US allies such as India, Saudi Arabia, and the UAE, there will be a country-specific cap on computing power equivalent to 50,000 advanced GPUs (worth about $1 billion). This cap can be doubled if these countries sign a pact with the US to uphold strict security standards, the rule said.“India’s GPU consumption is well within the 50,000 cap as of now,” said the chief executive of an Indian data centre company. “Currently, the combined compute power in India would be equivalent to 25,000 advanced GPUs. However, India being a vast market for AI use will require much more capacity in future, especially if the US continues to restrict model usage.”He explained that this may create a sovereign requirement for India to build its own AI models.Global tech bodies and companies like Nvidia and Oracle have criticised US President Joe Biden’s directive as the “most destructive to ever hit the US technology industry”. The world's largest cloud providers, data centres, model developers and even nations will now need a licence from the US to use their AI chips as per the rule, they said.The move, which comes days before Donald Trump takes over the US presidency, is set to revise the existing export controls on advanced computing hardware.“Indian companies will face new licensing requirements to obtain advanced computing ICs and AI model weights from the US,” said the spokesperson of a US-based tech policy body. “They will be subject to country-specific Total Processing Performance (TPP) allocations for imports of advanced ICs, limiting the total compute power available. Indian firms will not be eligible for the more permissive licence exceptions.”Even the Indian government’s AI Mission to procure large GPU clusters through public-private partnerships could get disrupted. “This may limit the scale or increase the costs,” the person said.Moreover, if the country cap of 50,000 GPUs is reached, American hyperscalers such as Microsoft, Amazon and Google would still be able to deploy 7% of their global capacity in India even as their local counterparts won’t be able to.“This could result in supply shortages, delays, and potentially higher costs for Indian firms that rely on cutting-edge GPU technology to remain competitive in the AI space,” said Singh of JSA Advocates & Solicitors. “Companies like Nvidia, which dominate the AI GPU market, would be constrained in their ability to supply these products to Indian companies, thereby hindering their capacity to innovate and scale AI solutions.”","summary":"The outgoing US administration’s proposed rule to curb the import of graphics processing units (GPUs) by certain countries may hit India's ambitions.

January 20, 2025, will be the birth date of the External Revenue Service. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!— TrumpDailyPosts (@TrumpDailyPosts) The creation of the new agency would require an act of Congress. Republicans currently hold the majority in both the House and Senate.Tariffs, with potential levies of 25% on goods from allies like Canada and Mexico and 60% on goods from China, are a key part of Trump's economic agenda. Trump asserted earlier this month that the nation's substantial prosperity during the Second Industrial Revolution was solely attributed to tariffs. He emphasised that implementing tariffs could eliminate national debt and restore America's financial prosperity.However. economists have expressed skepticism about the tariffs, stating that the costs will be passed on to consumers and considering them an inefficient way for governments to raise money.Democratic politicians opposed the External Revenue Service proposal. Oregon Senator Ron Wyden, leading Democrat on the Senate Finance Committee, said, \"No amount of silly rebranding will hide the fact that Trump is planning a multi-trillion-dollar tax hike on American families and small businesses to pay for another round of tax handouts to the rich.\"Trump, who openly talked about reducing the size of government, plans to establish a new agency to take on tasks already managed by existing bodies, such as the commerce department and customs and border protection, which oversee duties and revenue collection from other nations. The president-elect has selected two prominent business leaders to spearhead his department of government efficiency (DOGE), a nongovernmental task force dedicated to identifying ways to dismiss federal employees, eliminate programs, and streamline federal regulations. This initiative forms a core part of his \"Save America\" agenda for his second term in the White House. Billionaire Elon Musk and entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy are at the helm of DOGE's mission to scale back the size and reach of the federal government.","summary":"President-elect Donald Trump plans to create the External Revenue Service to collect tariffs and revenues from foreign countries, aiming to reduce national debt and boost financial prosperity.

Prior to the acquisition, he’d built up a position in the company of greater than 5 per cent, which would’ve required disclosing his holdings to the public within 10 calendar days of reaching that threshold.\n\nAccording to the SEC’s civil complaint, filed in US District Court in Washington, DC, Musk was more than 10 days late in reporting that material information, “allowing him to underpay by at least $150 million for shares he purchased after his financial beneficial ownership report was due.”\n\nThe SEC had been investigating whether Musk, or anyone else working with him, committed securities fraud in 2022 as the Tesla CEO sold shares in his car company and shored up his stake in Twitter ahead of his leveraged buyout.\n\nMusk said in a post on X last month that the SEC issued a “settlement demand,” pressuring him to agree to a deal including a fine within 48 hours or “face charges on numerous counts” regarding the purchase of shares.\n\nMusk’s lawyer, Alex Spiro, said in an emailed statement on Tuesday that the SEC’s action is an admission that “they cannot bring an actual case.”\n\nHe added that Musk “has done nothing wrong” and called the suit a “sham” and the result of a “multi-year campaign of harassment,” culminating in a “single-count ticky tak complaint.”\n\nMusk is just a week away from having a potentially influential role in government, as President-elect Donald Trump’s second term begins on January 20.\n\nMusk, who was a major financial backer of Trump in the latter stages of the campaign, is poised to lead an advisory group that will focus in part on reducing regulations, including those that affect Musk’s various companies.\n\nIn July, Trump vowed to fire SEC chairman Gary Gensler. After Trump’s election victory, Gensler announced that he would be resigning from his post instead.\n\nIn a separate civil lawsuit concerning the Twitter deal, the Oklahoma Firefighters Pension and Retirement System sued Musk, accusing him of deliberately concealing his progressive investments in the social network and intent to buy the company. The pension fund’s attorneys argued that Musk, by failing to clearly disclose his investments, had influenced other shareholders’ decisions and put them at a disadvantage.\n\nThe SEC said that Musk crossed the 5% ownership mark in March 2022 and would have been required to disclose his holdings by March 24.\n\n“On April 4, 2022, eleven days after a report was due, Musk finally publicly disclosed his beneficial ownership in a report with the SEC, disclosing that he had acquired over nine percent of Twitter’s outstanding stock,” the complaint says. “That day, Twitter’s stock price increased more than 27% over its previous day’s closing price.”\n\nThe SEC alleges that Musk spent over $500 million purchasing more Twitter shares during the time between the required disclosure and the day of his actual filing. That enabled him to buy stock from the “unsuspecting public at artificially low prices,” the complaint says. He “underpaid” Twitter shareholders by over $150 million during that period, according to the SEC.\n\nIn the complaint, the SEC is seeking a jury trial and asks that Musk be forced to “pay disgorgement of his unjust enrichment” as well as a civil penalty.\n\nFor a brief period in April 2022, after his ownership had been made public and it was known that he was the biggest shareholder, Musk was set to join Twitter’s board. However, he quickly abandoned that plan, telling the board he would not take a seat.\n\nWhat followed was a six-month drama that began with Musk submitting an unsolicited bid in mid-April that was opposed by the board. Twitter’s board eventually accepted Musk’s offer later that month. Soon thereafter, Musk tried to back out, alleging that Twitter was misstating the number of “bots” on its service\n\nMusk ultimately closed the deal in October 2022, famously walking into the company’s office in San Francisco with a sink in his hands.\n\n“Entering Twitter HQ – let that sink in!” Musk wrote, attaching a video of his entrance.","summary":"The SEC is suing Elon Musk, alleging he committed securities fraud by failing to disclose he had amassed an active stake in Twitter, a move that allowed him to buy shares at ‘artificially low prices’.","url":"https://thewest.com.au/business/sec-sues-elon-musk-alleging-failure-to-properly-disclose-twitter-ownership-c-17392486","image":"https://images.thewest.com.au/publication/C-17392486/2d58ea9fb720c99ff2958685dc046768b796b537-16x9-x0y235w4500h2531.jpg?imwidth=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-01-15 00:28:34","author":"Lora Kolodny","authors":["Lora Kolodny"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"au","sentiment":-0.091},{"id":280430040,"title":"Trump announces new External Revenue Service to collect foreign money","text":"President-elect Donald Trump announced on Tuesday plans to establish a new agency called the \"External Revenue Service\" to collect money from foreign countries owed to the United States.\"For far too long, we have relied on taxing our Great People using the Internal Revenue Service (IRS),\" Trump wrote on TRUTH Social. \"Through soft and pathetically weak Trade agreements, the American Economy has delivered growth and prosperity to the World, while taxing ourselves,\" the president-elect continued. \"It is time for that to change.

MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!\" CANADA READIES TRUMP TARIFFS RESPONSE: &apos;IN A TRADE WAR, THERE ARE NO WINNERS&apos; At a press conference at his Mar-a-Lago estate last week, Trump promised to levy \"substantial tariffs\" against Mexico and Canada if they don&apos;t adequately curb the flow of drugs and migrants across their borders with the U.S. The president-elect vowed to usher in \"a golden age for America,\" adding that the United States has access to natural resources \"no one else has.\" On the campaign trail, Trump had suggested levying minimum tariffs of 10% to 20% on all imported goods, and 60% or more on imports from China. Last month, he threatened that he would impose a 25% across-the-board tariff on all imports from Canada and Mexico, effective his first day in office, but it&apos;s unclear how the incoming administration&apos;s plans will actualize. TRUMP TELLS EU TO BUY MORE AMERICAN-MADE OIL AND GAS OR FACE &apos;TARIFFS ALL THE WAY Bloomberg reported on Tuesday that Trump&apos;s transition team was studying how to gradually increase tariffs month-to-month by drawing on executive authority granted under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act. One option reportedly considered is to raise tariffs gradually by about 2% to 5% a month on trade partners with the goal of offsetting any inflation fallout. Scott Bessent, Kevin Hassett and Stephen Miran are leading development of the tariffs strategy, Bloomberg reported, citing sources familiar with the matter. Trump tapped them to become Treasury Secretary, director of the National Economic Council, and leader of the Council of Economic Advisers, respectively. CBS News, meanwhile, noted that federal agencies that collect revenue from tariffs already exist. Tariffs are established by the Department of Commerce and the Office of the United States Trade Representative, but collection and enforcement is primarily carried out by U.S. Customs and Border Protection. Those collections are then deposited into the General Fund of the United States.

Prior to the acquisition, he’d built up a position in the company of greater than 5%, which would’ve required disclosing his holdings to the public within 10 calendar days of reaching that threshold. \n\nAccording to the SEC’s civil complaint, filed in U.S. District Court in Washington, D.C., Musk was more than 10 days late in reporting that material information, “allowing him to underpay by at least $150 million for shares he purchased after his financial beneficial ownership report was due.”\n\nThe SEC had been investigating whether Musk, or anyone else working with him, committed securities fraud in 2022 as the Tesla CEO sold shares in his car company and shored up his stake in Twitter ahead of his leveraged buyout. Musk said in a post on X last month that the SEC issued a “settlement demand,” pressuring him to agree to a deal including a fine within 48 hours or “face charges on numerous counts” regarding the purchase of shares.\n\nMusk’s lawyer, Alex Spiro, said in an emailed statement on Tuesday that the SEC’s action is an admission that “they cannot bring an actual case.” He added that Musk “has done nothing wrong” and called the suit a “sham” and the result of a “multi-year campaign of harassment,” culminating in a “single-count ticky tak complaint.”\n\nMusk is just a week away from having a potentially influential role in government, as President-elect Donald Trump’s second term begins on Jan. 20. Musk, who was a major financial backer of Trump in the latter stages of the campaign, is poised to lead an advisory group that will focus in part on reducing regulations, including those that affect Musk’s various companies.\n\nIn July, Trump vowed to fire SEC chairman Gary Gensler. After Trump’s election victory, Gensler announced that he would be resigning from his post instead.\n\nIn a separate civil lawsuit concerning the Twitter deal, the Oklahoma Firefighters Pension and Retirement System sued Musk, accusing him of deliberately concealing his progressive investments in the social network and intent to buy the company. The pension fund’s attorneys argued that Musk, by failing to clearly disclose his investments, had influenced other shareholders’ decisions and put them at a disadvantage.\n\nThe SEC said that Musk crossed the 5% ownership mark in March 2022 and would have been required to disclose his holdings by March 24.\n\n“On April 4, 2022, eleven days after a report was due, Musk finally publicly disclosed his beneficial ownership in a report with the SEC, disclosing that he had acquired over nine percent of Twitter’s outstanding stock,” the complaint says. “That day, Twitter’s stock price increased more than 27% over its previous day’s closing price.”\n\nThe SEC alleges that Musk spent over $500 million purchasing more Twitter shares during the time between the required disclosure and the day of his actual filing. That enabled him to buy stock from the “unsuspecting public at artificially low prices,” the complaint says. He “underpaid” Twitter shareholders by over $150 million during that period, according to the SEC.\n\nIn the complaint, the SEC is seeking a jury trial and asks that Musk be forced to “pay disgorgement of his unjust enrichment” as well as a civil penalty.\n\nFor a brief period in April 2022, after his ownership had been made public and it was known that he was the biggest shareholder, Musk was set to join Twitter’s board. However, he quickly abandoned that plan, telling the board he would not take a seat.\n\nWhat followed was a six-month drama that began with Musk submitting an unsolicited bid in mid-April that was opposed by the board. Twitter’s board eventually accepted Musk’s offer later that month. Soon thereafter, Musk tried to back out, alleging that Twitter was misstating the number of “bots” on its service\n\nMusk ultimately closed the deal in October 2022, famously walking into the company’s office in San Francisco with a sink in his hands.\n\n“Entering Twitter HQ – let that sink in!” Musk wrote, attaching a video of his entrance.","summary":"The SEC filed a lawsuit against Elon Musk on Tuesday, alleging the billionaire committed securities fraud in 2022 by failing to disclose he had amassed an active stake in Twitter, a secrecy that allowed him to buy shares at &#8220;artificially low prices.&#8221; Musk, who is also CEO of Tesla and SpaceX, purchased Twitter for $44 &#8230;\n\n\nThe post SEC sues Elon Musk, alleging failure to properly disclose Twitter ownership appeared first on WorldNewsEra.","url":"https://worldnewsera.com/news/sec-sues-elon-musk-alleging-failure-to-properly-disclose-twitter-ownership/","image":"https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/108083511-1736337396638-gettyimages-2180240111-zawrzel-elonmusk241025_npOIM.jpeg?v=1736896955&w=1920&h=1080","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-01-15 00:18:07","author":"Evelyn Blackwell","authors":["Evelyn Blackwell"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.079},{"id":280429048,"title":"From Ban To Buyout: What Next For TikTok In US?","text":"TikTok faces an imminent shutdown in the United States after Congress passed a law last year forcing its Chinses owner ByteDance to either sell the platform or close it by this Sunday.The US Supreme Court is expected to rule this week on TikTok's challenge to the law.Following a hearing last Friday, expectations are high that the law will stand.Here is a review of what could happen next for TikTok in the United States.- App store ban -Under a ban, the US government would first direct Apple and Google to remove TikTok from their app stores, preventing new downloads as early as Sunday, a day before President-elect Donald Trump takes office.However, the app would remain on the phones of the existing 170 million US users unless TikTok directly blocks their access.Although TikTok lawyer Noel Francisco stated the site would \"go dark\" on Sunday if the justices failed to block the ban, many observers doubt ByteDance would unilaterally hit the off switch for American users.(function(v,d,o,ai){ai=d.createElement(\"script\");ai.defer=true;ai.async=true;ai.src=v.location.protocol+o;d.head.appendChild(ai);})(window, document, \"//a.vdo.ai/core/v-ndtv/vdo.ai.js\");- Workarounds -Even if TikTok keeps its app accessible, US users would stop receiving security and software updates, leading to gradual deterioration in quality and increased vulnerabilities.As a workaround, users might turn to VPNs (virtual private networks) to mask their location by routing through countries where TikTok remains available.Another possibility is that TikTok could update from non-US servers through partnerships with foreign, non-Chinese companies -- though this would constitute direct defiance of US authorities and likely intensify scrutiny of ByteDance's US operations.- Defiance? -Once Trump takes office, the law's implementation will fall to his attorney general, who could choose not to enforce it, or stall, defying Congress's overwhelming support for the legislation.The Trump administration might also approach the Republican majority in Congress to modify the law, potentially giving ByteDance more time to find a buyer or devise alternative solutions.- Alternatives -Once banned, the assumption is that TikTok users will move to other apps, like Instagram Reels and YouTube shorts, TikTok copycats that have grown and will directly benefit from their rival's demise.Elon Musk's X could also benefit and the tycoon has made it known that he wants his platform, formerly Twitter, to more closely resemble TikTok, with video content and shopping features.Trump has expressed concern that a ban would primarily advantage Meta-owned Instagram, which may explain Mark Zuckerberg's recent public support for Trump.Some American content creators have already migrated to Xiaohongshu (Red Note), another Chinese social media app that recently topped the Apple App Store downloads.- Investor rescue? -Several potential buyers have emerged, including a group led by Frank McCourt, former owner of the Los Angeles Dodgers, even if ByteDance has ruled out a sale for now.His partner in the bid, Canadian businessman Kevin O'Leary, recently golfed with Trump and reported the president-elect's desire to use the TikTok saga as leverage in US-China relations.A report that the Chinese authorities would be open to a buyout by Musk was denied by TikTok.Former Activision Blizzard CEO Bobby Kotick also remains interested in buying TikTok, according to the Information.For now, TikTok's fate rests with the Supreme Court, with the company lawyers asking the nine justices for a delay to any ban to provide \"breathing space\" for a solution.\"Nobody knows what they can do and who's going to do it until they hear from the Supreme Court,\" Trump told Newsmax on Monday.(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)","summary":"TikTok faces an imminent shutdown in the United States after Congress passed a law last year forcing its Chinses owner ByteDance to either sell the platform or close it by this Sunday.","url":"https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/from-ban-to-buyout-what-next-for-tiktok-in-us-7475575","image":"https://c.ndtvimg.com/2024-05/4sivso_tiktok_625x300_17_May_24.jpeg?im=FeatureCrop,algorithm=dnn,width=1200,height=738","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-01-15 00:14:53","author":"Agence France-Presse","authors":["Agence France-Presse"],"language":"en","source_country":"in","sentiment":-0.411},{"id":280428050,"title":"Liberal fortunes in Quebec may be troubled as third minister ends leadership bid","text":"OTTAWA — The decision Tuesday by a third Liberal cabinet minister from Quebec not to seek the Liberal leadership is casting a spotlight on the party's ability to organize support in a province that has long been crucial to its electoral success.\n\nIndustry Minister François-Philippe Champagne announced at a luncheon discussion in Toronto that he won't be on the ballot when the Liberals choose their new leader on March 9. \n\nChampagne, long seen as a potential successor to Trudeau, said instead of running he will focus on ensuring the government is ready to protect Canadian industry from the trade threats posed by incoming U.S. president Donald Trump.\n\n\"It was probably the most difficult decision of my life, but I think it was the right one at the right time,\" Champagne said. \"There are many ways to fight for Canada.\"\n\nThat decision came four days after Foreign Affairs Minister Mélanie Joly decided not to enter the race, and three days after Labour Minister Steven MacKinnon said the same thing.\n\nStéphanie Chouinard, an associate professor of political science at Queen’s University, said the absence of a strong, bilingual Quebec candidate could make the election a harder slog on the ground for the Liberals in the province, and in other regions of the country with large francophone populations.\n\n“For the few who have said officially that they're joining the race or who are strongly expected to join, they will have to prove that they understand the province of Quebec and that they can at least minimally convey their message in the language of the majority of that province,” she said.\n\nShe said many Liberal supporters see fluency in both languages as an important quality in a leader and a mark of statesmanship.\n\n\"It’s not just francophones who will be paying attention to this issue.\"\n\nThe race is starting to become more defined, though none of the perceived front-runners have officially declared they are running. The party gave them until Jan. 23 to do so, with the leadership vote set for March 9.\n\nFormer Bank of Canada governor Mark Carney is expected to formally announce his candidacy later this week. Former finance minister Chrystia Freeland is planning to publicly announce before Jan. 20, and on Tuesday, government House leader Karina Gould hinted an announcement is coming from her as well.\n\nGould played coy at a news conference in Burlington, Ont., saying she would have more to say in the coming days. The 37-year-old Gould said she thinks it will be \"extremely important to have a younger voice in the race who can relate to people where they are and the struggles they're facing today.\"\n\nFormer B.C. premier Christy Clark withdrew herself from contention Tuesday, days after her team had signalled she was very close to declaring publicly she was running. \n\n\"I have made the difficult decision to step back,\" she said. \"While we have come a long way, in a short time, there is simply not enough time to mount a successful campaign and for me to effectively connect with francophone Canadians in their language. I have worked hard at improving my French but it’s not where it needs to be today.\"\n\nClark's decision not to run also came days after she was forced to backtrack from her claim that she was never a member of the Conservative party.\n\nIn an interview on CBC Radio's Saturday politics show \"The House,\" Clark denied she became a party member and voted for former Quebec premier Jean Charest in the 2022 Conservative leadership race that elected Pierre Poilievre.\n\nClark said in the interview she never joined the party or received a ballot for the race. But the Conservative party provided a screenshot of their electronic records showing Clark was an active party member from June 2, 2022, to June 30, 2023.\n\nClark later posted a facepalm emoji on social media, said she misspoke in the interview and acknowledged that she had backed Charest to stop Poilievre from winning.\n\nOttawa MP Chandra Arya and former Montreal MP Frank Baylis both announced last week they will run. Cape Breton MP Jaime Battiste says he will run and would become the first Indigenous candidate for prime minister.\n\nArya raised eyebrows in Ottawa political circles when he said it's not important for the next leader to be able to speak French.\n\n\"I can't imagine either the leader of our party or the next prime minister not being fluent in French,\" Heritage Minister Pascale St-Onge said in an interview, when asked about the importance of having bilingual leadership candidates. \"I don't see the Liberal party or the country moving backwards on this. It's something that makes Canada what it is.\"\n\nQuebec has always been vital to the Liberals in elections and they currently hold 33 of the province's 78 seats, equal to the seats held by the Bloc Québécois. The Conservatives now have nine seats in that province.\n\nJonathan Kalles, a consultant at McMillan Vantage and a former Quebec adviser in the Prime Minister's Office, said leadership candidates will have to quickly denounce Arya’s “outrageous statements or they will have no credibility.”\n\n“It needs to be clear that while there is no francophone Quebecer running in this race, that they understand the priorities, needs and interests of Quebecers, that they have strong Quebec teams ... that understand and respect Quebec,” he said. “Otherwise, it will come back to bite them in the next election.”\n\nBoth Champagne and Joly are well connected to the party machinery in Quebec and the remaining candidates can be expected to seek their endorsements. Joly has a decent political organization built up, Kalles said, while Champagne is Quebec co-chair for the Liberal campaign.\n\nProspective candidates will be hunting for votes from all 78 ridings in Quebec. Each electoral district is allocated 100 points in the leadership contest, according to the party's constitution.\n\n— With files from Rob Drinkwater in Edmonton and Anja Karadeglija in Ottawa.\n\nThis report by The Canadian Press was first published Jan. 14, 2025.\n\nKyle Duggan, The Canadian Press","summary":"OTTAWA — The decision Tuesday by a third Liberal cabinet minister from Quebec not to seek the Liberal leadership is casting a spotlight on the party's ability to organize support in a province that has long been crucial to its electoral success.","url":"https://www.biv.com/news/liberal-fortunes-in-quebec-may-be-troubled-as-third-minister-ends-leadership-bid-10072059","image":"https://www.vmcdn.ca/f/files/shared/feeds/cp/2025/01/6e3a09f817d83b54cccfe58ebe6c12f5a382cfae5e889d1ef122a4dbb2414b5d.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-01-15 00:14:25","author":"Kyle Duggan,The Canadian Press","authors":["Kyle Duggan","The Canadian Press"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"ca","sentiment":-0.037},{"id":280426452,"title":"Republican Uses Misspelled Sign During Pete Hegseth Confirmation Hearing","text":"Republican Senator Eric Schmitt of Missouri attacked Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) policies during Defense secretary nominee Pete Hegseth's confirmation hearing while using a misspelled sign.Newsweek called Schmitt's D.C. office for comment on Tuesday evening.Why It MattersHegseth's selection by President-elect Donald Trump to lead the Department of Defense was met with backlash as concerns of alleged misconduct, including intoxication in the workplace and sexual assault.

The fact they have been bullied by Mauritius into surrendering sovereignty of the Chagos Islands is the most shameful failure of British diplomacy this century.\n\n'Billions of pounds of British taxpayers' money is being thrown away and our national security and defence is being put at risk unnecessarily because Keir Starmer and David Lammy are unwilling or unable to defend Britain. This will also undermine our relationship with the USA and the incoming Trump administration who have signalled their opposition to this deal.'\n\nShe went on: 'For months Labour have been negotiating in secret and hiding from the public and Parliament the details and costs of the surrender of sovereignty. Just today Labour Ministers were asked by six MPs in the House of Commons for details on the Chagos surrender and now we know why they failed to answer and come clean. It looks like they are going to pay more and give up what limited control they claimed to have breaking what little guarantees they previously gave.'\n\nTory peer Lord Kempsell vowed to try all means to block the deal including in court as well as in Parliament, as the treaty has to be ratified by MPs and peers.\n\nHe said: 'This is a sellout of British sovereign territory and is against our national interests. British Indian Ocean Territory is a significant element of our security offer to the US and provides the UK with important power projection capabilities.\n\n'It is absurd that the UK taxpayer will be forced to give billions of pounds to Mauritius for the privilege of ceding our own sovereignty. We cannot afford this bill and all legal and parliamentary means to stop this deal will be used.'\n\nSenior opposition politicians including Nigel Farage and Suella Braverman also signed an open letter to Labour ministers urging them to 'stop the rushed Chagos Islands deal'.\n\nIt accused them of carrying out negotiations in secret without consulting the Chagossian people, many of whom now live in the UK.\n\nMinisters came under pressure over the deal in the Commons yesterday [tues] but Foreign Secretary David Lammy pointed out that the Tories had begun the negotiations to give away the Chagos Islands, which have been a British overseas territory since 1814.\n\nHe added: 'The White House, the State Department and the Pentagon believe that it is a good deal, as do the Indian Government.'\n\nMr Trump has not commented on the deal, nor his ally Elon Musk despite his persistent attacks on the Labour government.\n\nBut last night Republican Senator John Kennedy wrote on social media: 'This week, left wingers in Britain are rushing to give away a strategic U.S. military base in the Indian Ocean before Pres.

What about bad luck? It’s the opposite.\n\nBad luck is what happens when lack of preparation meets an ongoing threat.\n\nWe’re watching this play out now as fires tragically turn large swaths of Los Angeles’ most valuable real estate to ashes, with a massive price paid, including human lives.\n\nWe’re just starting to read about dry fire hydrants caused by water shortages resulting from dumping water into the ocean to protect smelt fish. Operations budget cuts at the Los Angeles Fire Department, approval of a bloated union contract and L.A. Fire Chief Kristin Crowley announcing DEI as a top priority. Stopping work to upgrade power lines adjacent to where fires now rage to make them fire- and wind-resistant because the work threatened an endangered plant species. And, in addition, dangers caused by fires ignited by the sprawling presence of L.A.’s homeless.\n\nMost of us know about this phenomenon. Something bad happens and after the fact we wonder why we ignored taking care of a problem that should have been obvious.\n\nIt is this sense of foreboding that played a major factor in the 2024 election, reelecting Donald Trump and making him the second president in U.S. history to return to the White House for a second non-consecutive term.\n\nThe most powerful message people send is voting with their feet. This we see in the annual one-way rental survey issued by U-Haul. U-Haul lists the top states that people have left and the top states to which they have moved.\n\nNumber one in the country in departures was California. People started leaving California even before L.A. started burning. The next four in departures were Massachusetts, New Jersey, New York and Pennsylvania. Four of these five states voted for Kamala Harris in 2024. Top states as destinations were South Carolina, Texas, North Carolina, Florida and Tennessee. All five went for President Trump in 2024.\n\nIn 2024 Donald Trump captured 49.8% of the popular vote compared to 46.9% in 2020 and 45.9% in 2016.\n\nTrump succeeded in a historic recapture of the White House riding on a pervading sense among the American people that things are not right. And a pervading sense that without attention to the problems staring us in the face, we’re in for trouble. And that the way to ignore it all is to leave Democrats in charge.\n\nWe know what these problems are. We just endured four years of a Biden administration that has been looking right through them.\n\nThis should be time for fastening seat belts. Donald Trump’s return to the White House will not be like his first election. There is no learning curve. Trump hits the ground now knowing how Washington works and how to get things done. And no one doubts that Donald Trump wants to get things done. \n\nWe are facing a bloated government, a nation filled with illegal immigrants, a military that cannot meet recruitment quotas, a Navy short of ships, government agencies strapped by DEI policies, our kids across the nation forced to attend public schools controlled by left-wing teachers unions peddling moral relativism and secular humanism, and a dangerous world where we have clear enemies – Russia, China, Iran – that want to undermine American values and influence.\n\nFor sure our 47th president enters office with an acute sense that there is no time to waste. And that is a good thing. There is no time to waste.\n\nAs Republicans go right to work to extend the expiring provisions of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act enacted in Trump’s first term, and deal with the border and energy, the American people should step up 100% behind them. \n\nThose that think there is time to waste might re-focus on the horror sweeping Los Angeles. \n\nBad luck is what happens when lack of preparation meets an ongoing threat.","summary":"'Trump hits the ground now knowing how Washington works and how to get things done'","url":"https://www.wnd.com/2025/01/for-republicans-lots-of-work-little-time-to-waste/","image":"https://www.wnd.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/mike-johnson-steve-scalise-house-republicans-jpg.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-01-14 23:59:26","author":"Star Parker","authors":["Star Parker"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.205},{"id":280428640,"title":"Jim Cramer says he supports healthcare stocks for their long-term value","text":"CNBC's Jim Cramer on Tuesday addressed the importance of investing for the long term, telling investors it's wise to evaluate certain pharmaceutical stocks for their growth prospects.\n\n\"Ask yourself what happens if things get better, please.

I was just on today with him. He’s also been for years the co-host of Fox and Friends Weekend. That’s all changing. Pretty soon, as we told you yesterday, he will be taking over the 4 p.m. Eastern Time slot on Fox News Channel on weekdays with a new version of the Will Cain show. Well, congratulations. Huge, huge deal for you.\n\nWill Cain: Thank you. It’s a huge deal for me, guy. We all go throughout this life with a certain level of ambition and professional hopes. And this achieves for me many of the things I set out to do. But if I’m being really honest with you, your audience, and and, you know, anybody that watches me, it’s also just huge for me personally, meaning my family. I travel a lot. I have been for nine years. Guy, I’ve said this, I haven’t unpacked my dopp kit for nine years. When I was at ESPN or Fox, I’ve traveled half a week pretty much for most of the last decade. And now I get to be home. Now that’s not the main thing, but it’s a big thing for for me and my family.\n\nGuy Benson: So is are you guys going to be doing the show from Texas or are you going to be coming to New York and the family moving here or up there? Have you made that decision yet or it sounds like this is a big family move, as you just said.\n\nWill Cain: This will be the Will Cain show live, 4:00 on Fox News from Dallas, Texas. We are in touch with Middle America. We are in touch not just with the values, but with the people. So, man, I’m just I’m thrilled. Man, I was born and raised a Texan. That’s who I am and that’s who I will die. And the show, which man I’m so grateful to Fox is is trusted me and give me this honor to do this. And I will do my best to make sure it pays off for everyone who ever gave this trust to me.\n\nGuy Benson: I mean, it’s so exciting because, you know, as you know, basically the shows this network, especially on weekdays, they’re all out in New York and D.C. to have in the late afternoon in between Martha and the five a show emanating from the Lone Star State. Hey, awesome for you and your family, obviously. Just be cool and cool and different, right? For the audience. Not something that is a show originating from the northeastern part of the country. Before we move on to other topics and news of the day, I just want to ask you, I’m sure there are still plans afoot and negotiations or discussions underway about exactly what this show is going to look like. But when it hits the air and remind us when it starts, what can people expect in the 4:00 hour on the Will Cain show?\n\nWill Cain: Thank you for asking that. So it starts next Tuesday, January 21st, the day after the inauguration of Donald Trump as president. Used a word about just where we’re located in Dallas, Texas, being different, that word is going to be an adjective. Used a lot to describe the Will Cain show. It will be different than what has historically been there at four, but it will also probably be different than everything else that is on the network. Guy, You and I come from a similar background and we both love radio. We both have done radio. I did that at ESPN. I do a digital show here at Fox. It’s on YouTube and Facebook, and we’re embracing that. We’re embracing the the breathy, casual, laid back, sincere, deep, fun vibe of what we’ve all done and and now will bring to the news channel. I’ll still be serious. There’s going to be breaking news. This will be immediate, but it’s also going to be room for depth and debate and and being real. That’s my currency guy. My my currency in life is authenticity. I just don’t feel good even when it’s to my detriment unless I’m being 100% me. And that’s what this show will reflect me.\n\nGuy Benson: Well, we look forward to that starting next week. The Will Cain show 4 p.m. Eastern time. Fox News Channel, huge deal. Again, major kudos. Looking forward to maybe joining some of those conversations. We can work some things out because people can watch your show and listen to this show all sorts of different ways to to get all of the content all at once. And I just so happy for you and for your family. Well, let’s talk about your very, very dear friend, Pete Hegseth, who shared the couch with you for years at Fox and Friends Weekend. Now, he’s been tapped by President Trump, President elect Trump to be defense secretary. And a high stakes hearing earlier today. Spanning hours. You and I talked about it on your show earlier. Now that it’s over, looking back, some of your reflections in terms of how he performed are what you thought of the senators at the hearing and the upshot. Does this change anything?\n\nWill Cain: So, you know, it’s interesting word you chose. It’s not a wrong word, but it’s interesting word. How did he perform? I think he performed perfectly. Now I know the guy and I actually think most people listening or watching know him as well because it’s not performance. He’s not fake. He’s the same guy. He’s the guy on the couch who’s the guy that I hang out with after the show. And you saw that guy in the hearing today? I told you this today, guy. This is what I believe should be the revelation. If anyone wasn’t familiar with Pete. This is a guy that understands priorities. He understands the priorities personally. He said, look, it basically goes God, family, country for me. And and when it comes to the United States military, he understands the priority, which is lethality. It’s representing the warrior class. It is making the United States military the most lethal fighting force on the planet and then being judicious about how you deploy that force. And no matter what was asked, no matter how it pivoted, he won’t lose focus. He’s not going to be distracted by the job he’s nominated for and those priorities. I’ll just say this quickly and, you know, I can dig into it. You asked about senators. I thought it was appalling that a lot of Democratic senators behaved and performed the way they did. I thought Mazie Hirono was embarrassing. I thought Tim Kaine.\n\nGuy Benson: She always.\n\nWill Cain: Is. And you pointed that out. Well, I mean, I’m not as familiar with her. Was that me? I wasn’t. I’m sorry. I wasn’t familiar with your work. I wasn’t familiar with her work. It was quite a performance by one.\n\nGuy Benson: Lucky you. Lucky you to not be familiar with her work, because, unfortunately, I have been more acquainted with it. I mean, go back and watch some of the Kavanaugh stuff, but I digress.\n\nWill Cain: Yeah. Same thing with Senator Kaine from Virginia. Same thing with Senator Gillibrand. From New York to lesser degrees. Same thing with Senator Blumenthal from Connecticut. You did really well on my show. You’ve probably done it here today. How dare Blumenthal, who’s lied about the wars that he’s been in? Question A 20 year war fighter.\n\nGuy Benson: Yeah. Have a seat. And the thing is, I’m not I’m not at all objecting to tough questions or even some hostile questions from the opposition party. That is part of what happens. Right. It’s part of the vetting process. I think that it can be frustrating. It is what it is. But Blumenthal in particular, if your lies about your service mean anything to you, if there’s any sense of shame in your bones at all. Right. Any contrition whatsoever. This is the type of hearing where you take a seat, maybe mute your microphone and let other people take the shots. But he couldn’t resist performance. Again, there’s that word.\n\nWill Cain: And you’re right. And again, you did this today on the Will Cain show. Go check it out on Spotify or Apple. You said this. There are legitimate questions to be asked. I am biased. I believe in Pete Hegseth. This is my friend. But that doesn’t mean I don’t think there are fair questions to ask, like, hey, have you ever managed anything this big? What in your resume suggests that you’re capable of managing something this big? That’s a fair question, which he can adeptly answer. And, you know, Tim Kaine asked questions that are tough and it was tough to watch. And most of them were completely inappropriate, but not all of them. But the way that he did it revealed he’s not interested in an earnest answer or a vetting process. He was interested in the performance in dragging Pete through the mud. And there was Tim Kaine in the middle of the pigsty, just wallowing and hurling mud in every direction. And that’s the image we should have of that senator, that he is in the middle of a pig sty, squatted, wallowing.\n\nGuy Benson: You know, there was an interesting back and forth. Tim Sheehy is a brand new senator, freshly minted Montana Republican. He replaced Jon Tester, won that election out there just in November. Tim Sheehy is part of is a younger guy, kind of like a peer, if you will, and ABC in a lot of ways, right? Navy Seal, he is part of the war fighter class that you were talking about. And there were an awful lot of them packed into that hearing room. Pete had a lot of supporters. He talked in his opening statement. We actually played on this show well, the entire opening statement, 4.5 minutes start to finish in our first segment. I wanted people to hear that without any color commentary on the side. No other noise, just Pete making the case for himself in his own voice. There’s own history. And he. Talked about people having his back figuratively and literally. And the literally was in reference to all those people sitting behind him there to support him and others out in the streets on his behalf. Today here in Washington, DC, Tim Sheehy is one of those war fighters, one of those warriors. There had been a bit of a pop quiz from Blumenthal on some of the numbers and stats and statistics that Pete, I think, aced or at least got a solid B on. He did well. Then Tim Sheehy asked a very Siri, a very different series of questions. And I think it actually reveals something about Hegseth and his approach to the job if he gets it. I want you to listen and react. Cut. 36.\n\n(SOUNDBITE PLAYS)\n\nWill Cain: Wow.\n\nGuy Benson: Well, I think what’s interesting about that I’d love for you to just to go off on this a little bit. I’m not saying that every little piece of information that Pete knew there in response to the questions from Senator Sheehy is going to be relevant to the day to day work of managing a gigantic institution like the Pentagon. There are different skill sets involved, but in terms of authenticity, there’s a word that you used authenticity and life experience about what our war fighters go through. I would doubt if any of the senators on that stage, on on that podium, aside maybe from Sheehy, could have answered those questions in rapid succession, the way that he accepted.\n\nWill Cain: They couldn’t have answered any of those questions and they couldn’t have answered whether or not a rifle was semi-automatic or automatic. They couldn’t distinguish. I think the vast majority of them couldn’t distinguish between a rifle and a shotgun. And here’s what you should take away from that. That’s not fake. That’s a man that’s used those tools in war. And the reason for his familiarity is in part also because he he continues to be familiar with guns in his post-military career. But he knows about war fighters. Guy. And you talked about she I know the guys here in the gallery. I swam the Hudson with them as his Pete and I’ve got to know them through Pete. He has their support. Like I’m telling you, Green Berets, Navy SEALs, Marines. I can’t speak to 100% because I don’t know, 100% of them. But the ones that I do know, overwhelming support from the trigger pullers, the war fighters. And you know what? I do think the secretary of defense should be able to answer those questions. He should be able to answer more and know more. But you know what? It makes me pretty proud. The second defense answers that pop quiz so competently.\n\nGuy Benson: And I would also say to the point of the people in that hearing room today, all the supporters, people who have put on the uniform, put themselves in harm’s way, who were there on his behalf, then some communist streakers of Code Pink on the other side. It’s quite a juxtaposition. Will Cain is host of the upcoming forthcoming Will Cain Show on Fox News Channel 4 p.m. Eastern every weekday starting January 21st next week. Well, again, congrats.

He emphasized that the country’s armed forces face acute shortages of essential equipment, including armored vehicles and artillery, rather than personnel, as reported by Ukrainian media \n\n“We have more than 100 brigades on the battlefield, and each of them needs to be fully staffed every day. But we are constantly facing shortages – especially in armored vehicles, artillery, and other necessary equipment,” he said, highlighting that many units are struggling due to frequent equipment failures and ongoing maintenance issues.\n\n“Therefore, when we talk about increasing the number of our troops, we must understand that there are no adequate supplies… Our partners have all these requests,” he added.\n\nZelensky’s comments come amid growing pressure from Kiev’s sponsors, particularly the United States, to lower Ukraine’s conscription age to 18 to bolster troop numbers.\n\nThe Russian Foreign Intelligence Service (SVR) suggested last week that Kiev could soon comply with Western pressure to draft younger soldiers over concerns that the country’s defenses could collapse. Several Ukrainian outlets, as well as some Russian diplomats, have speculated that Zelensky is keeping that move as a last-ditch bargaining chip.\n\nUS President-elect Donald Trump repeatedly promised to achieve a negotiated settlement of the Ukraine conflict in one day after taking office but has since admitted it could take up to six months. His national security adviser, Mike Waltz, recently said that Kiev must acknowledge territorial “reality” and stressed that the issue is not “just about munitions, ammunition, or writing more checks” but about “seeing the front lines stabilize so that we can enter into some type of deal.”\n\n“If Ukrainians have asked the whole world to be all in for democracy, we need them to be all in for democracy,” Waltz told ABC News on Sunday. “And they certainly have fought bravely, and they certainly have taken a very noble and tough stand. But we need to see those manpower shortages addressed.”\n\nFormer UK Defense Secretary Ben Wallace also recently criticized Zelensky for trying to “preserve” the youths, instead of adopting a full-scale “mass conscription.”\n\nUkraine’s mobilization drive continues to face challenges due to widespread draft evasion and desertions. According to the Ukrainian military, approximately 500,000 men are suspected of evading conscription since February 2022, despite toughened penalties and stricter enforcement measures. At the same time, nearly 96,000 criminal cases have been opened against servicemen who abandoned their positions, most of them in 2023, according to Bloomberg.\n\nMoscow believes the conflict is a Western-led proxy war against Russia, which the West intends to wage “to the last Ukrainian.” Last month, Russian Defense Minister Andrey Belousov said that Ukraine has lost 1 million servicemembers to death and injury, with more than half of that number occurring in 2024 alone.","summary":"Ukraine’s Vladimir Zelensky has indicated that Kiev could lower the conscription age, if its sponsors send more military equipment \nRead Full Article at RT.com","url":"https://www.rt.com/russia/610887-zelensky-weapons-conscription-age/","image":"https://mf.b37mrtl.ru/files/2025.01/article/6786f83b85f54061915f2caf.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-01-14 23:55:12","author":null,"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"ru","sentiment":0.113},{"id":280427952,"title":"US SEC sues Elon Musk over Twitter purchase disclosures","text":"The Securities and Exchange Commission on Tuesday filed a lawsuit against Elon Musk over the billionaire’s alleged failure to properly disclose his purchase of Twitter stock in 2022.\n\nFor 11 days, Musk — the world’s richest man and a major backer of President-elect Donald Trump — allegedly failed to properly file notice that he had acquired a major stake in Twitter, the SEC said in a court filing in Washington.

I live in Manhattan. Feel for me.\n\nYes, Trump says wild things, like riffing about “terminating” parts of the U.S. Constitution.\n\nBut I don’t think he means it. As Joe Rogan said to Trump when candidate Trump came on his show, “You say a lot of wild s–t!”\n\nIn any case, podcaster Michael Malice, in my new video, says not to worry, “We have so much further to go before we’re lost as a country.”\n\nMalice knows the damage real tyrants do. He’s spent time in North Korea, and he was born in the Soviet Union. He detests political “leaders,” saying the best political system is anarchism: self-government without a central authority, or, as the AI on my computer defines it: “a self-managed, stateless society based on voluntary cooperation and mutual aid.”\n\nMalice and I debate that. I’m no anarchist. I’m a libertarian. I believe we should be allowed to act as we wish, so long as we don’t hurt others. I accept the need for limited government, one that adjudicates disputes, enforces pollution control, and funds police and a military to keep us safe.\n\nMalice says it’s wrong to think that way, because all central government is a problem.\n\n“Security is like anything else,” he argues. “Should the government be producing books? … No. Producing helicopters? … No … a government monopoly makes no sense. But somehow when it comes to security, you’re OK with this. And then you live in New York and wonder why it ends up being the way it is.”\n\nI’m not convinced that security is “like anything else.” A government monopoly on force at least means that we rarely have different security forces fighting each other.\n\n“How about pollution?” I ask, because I don’t see how my beloved free market will effectively address it. “My smoke goes into other people’s lungs. Under anarchy, there’s no preventative mechanism that would deter me from letting that smoke travel.”\n\n“That’s an aggression,” replies Malice. “You are violating my space. That would be adjudicated under private arbitration, which would be faster and more efficient.”\n\nPrivate lawsuits and arbitration are efficient? Not that I’ve seen.\n\nIt’s hard for everyone who breathes my fumes to sue me.\n\n“There would be some John Stossels out there who make those polluting cars or they don’t really care. But the point is, all the pressures on cars and all these other mechanisms are far more a function of people getting informed and involved than it is the function of government laws.”\n\nHe points out that pollution is worst in countries with big governments, “like China, where under communism … you drain every bit of resource that you can. … people getting cancer, dying, you don’t care. Under free markets, people are more invested and have more of a space to say something, to clean up the environment.”\n\n“But our air and water were filthy before we had government’s pollution laws,” I point out.\n\n“How did they get cleaned up? Because you had organizations saying ‘pollution is bad.’ … And these companies did something about it. Government laws came as a consequence.”\n\nMalice calls anarchism “libertarianism with principles.” He also published “The Anarchist Handbook,” featuring essays by thinkers who say that a society without government could work well.\n\nI’m skeptical.\n\nI hate our big intrusive government, hate that it grabs almost half our money and micromanages our lives. I hate the politicians who act like good things come from them, rather than from millions of free people pursuing our own interests. I hate that government constantly grows more intrusive and takes more of our money (under both Democrat and Republican administrations).\n\nBut I do think we need some of it.","summary":"'I hate our big intrusive government ... but I do think we need some of it'","url":"https://www.wnd.com/2025/01/anarchists-vs-libertarians/","image":"https://www.wnd.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/national-guard-capitol-masks-1.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-01-14 23:51:48","author":"John Stossel","authors":["John Stossel"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.243},{"id":280429836,"title":"Aussies demand recall of $8 treat that landed two dogs in ICU","text":"Exclusive: Two families from Western Australia are demanding a popular dog treat brand recall one of their products after it landed their dogs in the ICU.\n\nSasha Wadham and Graham Torpy live just 15 minutes apart in Perth, Western Australia, but didn't meet until tragedy struck.\n\nOn January 4, Wadham's sister gave pet dog Tucker a Bow Wow Dog Treats Prosciutto Bone.

This is Victor Davis Hanson for the Daily Signal.\n\nI want to talk today very briefly about the matter of Trump trolling. I’m kind of smiling, because a lot of people don’t know what to make of it.\n\nIt concerns four topics: Renaming the Gulf of Mexico to the Gulf of America; assuming control of Greenland, or buying it, I should say; renegotiating the Panama Canal Treaty, with the idea that either they reform, the Panamanians, or we take acquisition of it; and then, of course, making Canada a particular state.\n\nThe traditional exegesis of all of these is that he’s trolling, and in reference to that, go back to “The Art of the Deal,” a ghostwritten book; “The Art of the Comeback,” etc. “The Art of the Deal 2”; and in that Trump exegesis, he says, when you go into a room to negotiate, you just seem wild and demand 100%, and then through the negotiation, the other party starts to make demands on you reciprocally.\n\nAnd then, finally, you feel like you’ve been put upon, and you walk out of the room with a 55% or 60% advantage, and then you never make fun of the person. You praise them.\n\nWe’ve seen it with North Korea in the first Trump term. And under that logic, Donald Trump is telling Canada, well, you don’t spend any money to defend yourself, so to speak. You’re under the American nuclear umbrella, and the trade imbalance is not fair, because you have tariffs on our goods that we don’t have on yours.\n\nAnd yet, you won’t patrol the border when you know the drugs and people are coming illegally into the United States. Blah, blah, blah. So, we are going to demand something from you—make you the next state. And there are—it’s very effective, because provinces like Ontario are very energy-rich and very conservative, and maybe some would like to join the United States.\n\nSo, it causes a lot of dissension. It may have led to [Canadian Prime Minister Justin] Trudeau finally throwing in the towel. The next example is, of course, Greenland, this huge country, a semiautonomous province of Denmark, three or four times the size of Texas. Key to American security in World War II.\n\nTrump says he wants to buy it. He said it before. They said, what are you doing? And in “Art of the Deal” fashion, of course, now Denmark is spending an extra billion-plus dollars of investment in this huge colony. And on their royal coat of arms are including Greenland imagery.\n\nAnd so, according to this logic, they are now pushing back, and Trump is going to be better off than when he started, as in the case of Canada, when they started to patrol the border, and they clamped down on drugs, and they said they renegotiate any asymmetrical tariffs.\n\nIn the case of renaming the Gulf of Mexico, the Mexican president showed a map recently of the southwest of the United States being part of Mexico. That was her counter.\n\nThat’s kind of a bad troll, because they rely on $63 billion of remittances. That’s their, remember, it’s their largest source of foreign exchange. So, I don’t think she should troll Trump. But the idea was that it was a message to Mexico that you have an imbalance. You’re sending people here illegally, 12 million in the last four years. You get remittances, $63 billion. 80,000 Americans have died per year, fentanyl. You won’t control it. So, we’re going to start to reexamine our entire message.\n\nSo, in the case of the Panama Canal: It’s similar to Greenland and Canada and the Gulf of Mexico controversies. The Chinese have intruded into an American domain. We built the canal. We operated it effectively for one century. And Panama is now flirting with Chinese capital in a way that hurts our national interest because China’s interest in the Panama Canal in times of crisis would be to shut it down and prevent our fleets from redeploying, either east or west. We, we all know that.\n\nAnd so, under “Art of the Deal” with all of these controversies—Panama, Greenland, Canada, the Gulf of Mexico—you get boisterous, you get excessive, you seem unstable, and then the other party negotiates down in reasonable fashion, and you end up better [off.]\n\nI’d just like to finish, though, there is one key element missing: Irony. Irony.\n\nSo, Donald Trump is saying to the Mexican government: If you look at the coastline of the Gulf of Mexico, 1,700 miles are U. S. coastline; 1,700 miles are Mexican coastline. Why is it called the Gulf of Mexico? But here’s the key, and we are in an age of left-wing renaming things.\n\nWe topple statues. We rename iconic buildings. We take away Woodrow Wilson. We do everything. And according to your logic, it’s time that you had the Gulf of Mexico for centuries, but we have the exact amount of coastline that you do. And we now are a convert for your idea of renaming things. In the case of Greenland, you Europeans are anti-colonialists.\n\nYou’re always giving us lectures. This is a colony. New York City is closer to Greenland than is Copenhagen. And we defend it. And it’s a North American territory. So, do you still want to play the imperial colonialist because you only react to your colonial people when you’re pressured, and you’re endangering them.\n\nHe’s trying to tip the left-wing argument from Denmark: Oh, the United States is a bully, upside-down. That you’re the bully, you’re the colonialist. In the case of Canada, it’s the same thing. You don’t want us to intrude, but you want freebies. You want us to defend you while you pose as you’re an anti-militaristic, left-wing, pacifistic, utopian society.\n\nBut if you examine things, you would be scared to death about Chinese and Russian intrusion into your airspace or sea space, if it wasn’t for the United States. So, when you look at this, what Trump is saying is, I am using left-wing arguments—colonialism, changing names, imperialism, inviting in communist, autocratic governments that don’t reflect the will of people in the case of China, and I’m flipping them and putting them in your face.\n\nAnd the whole point is to reexamine the status quo across the board. It’s kind of an anti-woke argument, isn’t it? Everything is up for grabs, and if the woke people think they can rewrite the history and traditions of the United States, maybe don’t. Trump can, too.\n\nThank you so much for tuning in today. Please subscribe to The Daily Signal for our next episode.\n\nWe publish a variety of perspectives.

Prisoners After Removal From US Terror List","text":"Cuba said Tuesday it would release 553 prisoners in response to an announcement from Washington that it will remove the communist country from its list of state sponsors of terrorism.The White House said earlier that President Joe Biden was removing Cuba from the list in a deal that will see protesters imprisoned in the country released.The move will likely be overturned after the return to office next week of Republican Donald Trump, who reinstated Cuba's terror designation in the final days of his first term of office in 2021.\"An assessment has been completed, and we do not have information that supports Cuba's designation as being a state sponsor of terrorism,\" a senior Biden administration official told reporters.Cuba welcomed the move as a step in the \"right direction,\" but lamented it was still under US sanctions in place since 1962.(function(v,d,o,ai){ai=d.createElement(\"script\");ai.defer=true;ai.async=true;ai.src=v.location.protocol+o;d.head.appendChild(ai);})(window, document, \"//a.vdo.ai/core/v-ndtv/vdo.ai.js\");The foreign ministry later announced that 553 people imprisoned for \"diverse crimes\" will be released.Cuba blames the US blockade for its worst economic crisis in decades, marked by shortages of fuel, food, medicines and electricity.Driven by blackouts and soaring food prices, thousands of Cubans took to the streets nationwide in July 2021, shouting: \"We are hungry\" and \"Freedom!\" in what was the biggest challenge to the government in years.According to the Mexico-based Justicia 11J NGO, which focuses on human rights in Cuba, more than 1,500 people were arrested after those protests, of whom 600 were still in prison last December.One person was killed and dozens injured in the protests, which Havana accused Washington of orchestrating.- 'Genocidal' -Analysts say the Covid-19 pandemic, which tanked tourism, and economic mismanagement by the government have contributed greatly to the poor state of the economy.But Cuba's President Miguel Diaz-Canel has described US sanctions as \"genocidal\" and said his country was prepared for \"more difficult circumstances\" after Trump's election.Cuba was ready for \"dialogue\" with the new administration, Diaz-Canel said weeks after Trump was reelected.The 78-year-old's first presidential term from 2017 to 2021 saw a tightening of sanctions against Cuba that were loosened during a period of detente under his predecessor Barack Obama.The incoming president's allies immediately criticized Biden over Tuesday's announcement, with Ted Cruz -- a Cuban-American member of the US Senate's Foreign Relations Committee -- calling it a \"rank appeasement of the Cuban regime.\"\"These moves do incredible damage to American national security and send a message to our adversaries that they can rely on outgoing Democrat administrations -- and wait out pressure from Republican administrations -- to continue engaging in terrorism and other aggression against Americans,\" Cruz said in a statement.Trump has nominated Senator Marco Rubio, a Cuban-American highly critical of communism and the left at large, to serve as his secretary of state.A White House statement said Biden would also be waiving part of the so-called Libertad

out of $2 billion, CFPB says","text":"Capital One was sued by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau for allegedly misleading consumers about its offerings for high-interest savings accounts. As a result, customers lost more than $2 billion in potential interest payments, the lawsuit claims.In a complaint filed Tuesday, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau took aim at Capital One's promises and handling of its \"360 Savings\" accounts, which were promoted as accounts providing one of the highest interest rates in the nation. But instead, the CFPB alleges, Capital One froze its rate at a low level for at least several years, even as rates rose nationally.At the same time, the CFPB adds, the bank created \"360 Performance Savings,\" which had a much higher rate â at one point, more than 14 times higher than the original \"360 Savings\" accounts. The lawsuit comes at a time when savers have benefitted from the Federal Reserve's decision to ratchet interest rates, part of its effort to fight soaring inflation. As a result, some banks have rolled out high-interest savings accounts to attract savers.But at the same time, some banks haven't boosted rates on their savings accounts, creating a gap between low-and top-paying accounts, similar to that of Capital One's two offerings. According to the CFPB, Capital One marketed the products similarly to obscure their distinction and forbade employees \"from proactively telling\" those with 360 Savings accounts about the higher-paying 360 Performance Savings, the agency said.\"Capital One did not specifically notify 360 Savings account holders about the new product, and instead worked to keep them in the dark about these better-paying accounts,\" the CFPB said in a statement. The lawsuit comes at a time when savers have benefitted from the Federal Reserve's decision to ratchet interest rates to fight soaring inflation, which allowed banks to roll out high-interest savings accounts after years of meager rates.In response, Capital One said that it strongly disagreed with the CFPB's allegations and plans to \"vigorously defend\" itself in court. The banking giant added that it was \"deeply disappointed to see the CFPB continue its recent pattern of filing eleventh-hour lawsuits ahead of a change in administration.\"Capital One also maintained that all of its 360 banking products \"offer great rates\" â and have \"always been available in just minutes to all new and existing customers without any of the usual industry restrictions.\"Billions in lost interestThese actions mean Capital One \"illegally avoided paying billions in interest to millions of consumers,\" the CFPB wrote in its Tuesday complaint. The agency says it's seeking to impose civil penalties and provide financial relief to those impacted.\"Banks should not be baiting people with promises they can't live up to,\" CFPB Director Rohit Chopra said in a prepared statement.According to disclosures on the Capital One's website, 360 Savings accounts currently carry an interest rate of just under 0.50%. 360 Performance Savings accounts have an interest rate of about 3.74%.That means the rate for 360 Performance Savings is nearly 7.5 times higher than that of 360 Savings today. But the CFPB says they've been farther apart in the past. In July 2024, the agency notes in Tuesday's complaint, the 360 Performance Savings rate was more than 14 times that of 360 Savings.The CFPB alleges that Capital One kept the rate for its 360 Savings accounts at 0.30% between December 2020 through at least August 2024. The rate for 360 Performance Savings, by contrast, climbed from 0.40% in April 2022 to as high as 4.35% at the start of 2024 â falling slightly to 4.25% by August, the agency noted Tuesday.The CFPB's complaint against Capital One comes less than one week before the Jan. 20 inauguration of President-elect Donald Trump. Despite the change in administration, some say this litigation could still survive.Analyst commentary from TD Cowen on Tuesday noted that the CFPB still brought enforcement actions under Trump's first term, for example, although such litigation may also be easier to settle under the incoming administration.","summary":"The CFPB is suing Capital One for allegedly misleading consumers about its offerings for high-interest savings accounts.","url":"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/capital-one-cfpb-lawsuit-savings-account-rates/","image":"https://assets2.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/07/31/44326ad1-6987-4489-a189-a1c0e70a66de/thumbnail/1200x630/198ca4fdce305f292b511f6177fee69c/GettyImages-1158652309.jpg?v=b96653698c03046ba0de2764525fc2d3","video":"https://prod.vodvideo.cbsnews.com/cbsnews/vr/hls/2024/02/16/2309663299823/2688454_hls/master.m3u8","publish_date":"2025-01-14 23:45:42","author":null,"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.535},{"id":280429228,"title":"California pulls back EPA requests for approval to phase out diesel-powered trains and big rigs - The Associated Press","text":"SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) — California withdrew requests Tuesday for the federal government to allow the state to enforce rules limiting emissions from diesel-powered trains and big rigs in anticipation of the Trump administration rejecting them.\n\nThe move comes days before President-elect Donald Trump’s inauguration. One of the rules, which the California Air Resources Board approved in 2023, would have banned new diesel-powered semi-trucks that transport goods through ports from being sold in the state starting in 2036. Another rule, which the agency approved the same month, would have banned locomotive engines more than 23 years old by 2030 and increased the use of zero-emissions technology to transport freight from ports and throughout railyards.\n\nAir Resources Board Chair Liane Randolph said the agency is assessing its options to continue its efforts to curb planet-warming emissions and improve air quality but did not offer specifics on what comes next for the rules.\n\n“While we are disappointed that U.S. EPA was unable to act on all the requests in time, the withdrawal is an important step given the uncertainty presented by the incoming administration that previously attacked California’s programs to protect public health and the climate and has said will continue to oppose those programs,” Randolph said in a statement.\n\nDuring Trump’s first term, his administration challenged the state’s authority to set its own emissions standards that are stricter than federal rules. But a federal court last year upheld California’s ability to set nation-leading vehicle emissions regulations.\n\nThe EPA granted California the authority last month to enforce a rule banning the sale of new gas-powered cars in the state by 2035.\n\nThe EPA did not immediately respond to a request for comment on California withdrawing its waiver requests.\n\nAustin is a corps member for the Associated Press/Report for America Statehouse News Initiative.

Prior to the acquisition he’d built up a position in the company of greater than 5%, which would’ve required disclosing his holding to the public. According to the SEC complaint, filed in U.S. District Court in Washington, D.C., Musk withheld that material information, “allowing him to underpay by at least $150 million for shares he purchased after his financial beneficial ownership report was due.” The SEC had been investigating whether Musk, or anyone else working with him, committed securities fraud in 2022 as the Tesla CEO sold shares in his car company and shored up his stake in Twitter ahead of his leveraged buyout. Musk said in a post on X last month that the SEC issued a “settlement demand,” pressuring him to agree to a deal including a fine within 48 hours or “face charges on numerous counts” regarding the purchase of shares. Musk’s lawyer, Alex Spiro, said in an emailed statement that the action is an admission by the SEC that “they cannot bring an actual case.” He added that Musk “has done nothing wrong” and called the suit a “sham” and the result of a “multi-year campaign of harassment,” culminating in a “single-count ticky tak complaint.” Musk is just a week away from having a potentially influential role in government, as President-elect Donald Trump’s second term begins on Jan. 20. Musk, who was a major financial backer of Trump in the latter stages of the campaign, is poised to lead an advisory group that will focus in part on reducing regulations, including those that affect Musk’s various companies. In July, Trump vowed to fire SEC chairman Gary Gensler. After Trump’s election victory, Gensler announced that he would be resigning from his post instead. In a separate civil lawsuit concerning the Twitter deal, the Oklahoma Firefighters Pension and Retirement System sued Musk, accusing him of deliberately concealing his progressive investments in the social network and intent to buy the company. The pension fund’s attorneys argued that Musk, by failing to clearly disclose his investments, had influenced other shareholders’ decisions and put them at a disadvantage. The SEC said that Musk crossed the 5% ownership threshold in March 2022 and would have been required to disclose his holdings by March 24. “On April 4, 2022, eleven days after a report was due, Musk finally publicly disclosed his beneficial ownership in a report with the SEC, disclosing that he had acquired over nine percent of Twitter’s outstanding stock,” the complaint says. “That day, Twitter’s stock price increased more than 27% over its previous day’s closing price.” The SEC alleges that Musk spent over $500 million purchasing more Twitter shares during the time between the required disclosure and the day of his actual filing. That enabled him to buy stock from the “unsuspecting public at artificially low prices,” the complaint says. He “underpaid” Twitter shareholders by over $150 million during that period, according to the SEC. This is a developing story.

That’s it. That is my job.”\n\nSeveral sources close to the process told The Post after the hearing that Hegseth was “absolutely” a shoo-in for confirmation after Trump returns to the White House on Jan. 20.\n\nAt least one person was assured that the Pentagon nom had “improved his standing and did very well today,” despite seeming unanimous disapproval from Democrats — with Sen. Tammy Duckworth (D-Ill.), an Army vet herself, branding Hegseth a “no-go.”\n\nHegseth repeatedly pledged to rid the Pentagon of “woke” Biden administration policies, such as climate change and diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) initiatives.\n\nAsked by Sen. Dan Sullivan (R-Alaska) how he believed US service members would react to such a move, the nominee answered “the troops will rejoice.”\n\n“They will love it. They will love it,” Hegseth said. “And we’ve already seen it in recruiting numbers. There’s already been a surge, since President Trump won the election, of recruiting the Army’s interests.”\n\nThe defense secretary-designate had been ousted from his own Army National Guard unit and unable to serve at President Biden’s inauguration in 2021, he noted, for having a “Christian tattoo” — the Jerusalem Cross — branded as an “extremist” symbol by a fellow soldier.\n\nHegseth said his Defense Department would “focus on lethality and warfighting,” while also being ready to “deter and prevent wars” if necessary.\n\nA retired US Army major, the former Fox News personality has never been appointed to a political position, but served for more than a decade and deployed on combat tours to Iraq and Afghanistan.\n\nHegseth told senators that Trump chose him because the president-elect believed it was time to appoint a defense secretary “with dust on his boots.”\n\n“As President Trump also told me, we’ve repeatedly placed people atop the Pentagon with supposedly ‘the right credentials’ — whether they are retired generals, academics or defense contractor executives — and where has it gotten us?” he asked.\n\n“He believes, and I humbly agree, that it’s time to give someone with dust on his boots the helm. A change agent. Someone with no vested interest in certain companies or specific programs or approved narratives.”\n\nOnly one Republican defection could deadlock a vote on Hegseth’s nomination in the Armed Services committee before it heads to the Senate floor, though no GOPer expressed reservations in Tuesday’s hearing.\n\nThe nominee can then afford to lose just four votes in the upper chamber, which Republicans control 53-47.\n\nIn an effort to derail the confirmation, Senate Democrats homed in on allegations of sexual impropriety — including a sexual assault accusation in October 2017 that resulted in a non-disclosure agreement — drinking on the job, and financial mismanagement at Concerned Vets for America, one of the advocacy groups.\n\nThey also pulled out previous comments by Hegseth disparaging the service of women and LGBTQ troops in the military as part of his crusade against DEI in the ranks. Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) likened Hegseth’s public reversal on female troops in the past month to a “deathbed conversion.”\n\n“Women will have access to ground combat roles, given combat standards remain high,” the nominee pledged to Sen. Joni Ernst (R-Iowa), another veteran on the panel.\n\nWith the exception of a handful of CodePink hecklers who interrupted his opening statement — one of whom denounced Hegseth as a “misogynist” — the nominee was given time to respond to what he called a “coordinated smear campaign” against him.\n\nThe Pentagon nom’s lawyer previously said Hegseth was effectively blackmailed during the #MeToo movement into paying off his accuser and that the sex was consensual.\n\n“I was falsely accused in October of 2017; it was fully investigated; and I was completely cleared,” Hegseth said during his testimony, dismissing all “anonymous” accusations.\n\n“They’re not anonymous,” Sen. Tim Kaine (D-Va.) retorted at one point. “We have seen records with names attached to all of these, including the name of your own mother,” referring to an email Hegseth’s parent sent her son distraught over his infidelity that she later said she apologized to him for.\n\n“If it had been a sexual assault, that would be disqualifying to be secretary of defense,” the Virginia Democrat said.\n\n“You and I have both seen the FBI background investigation,” added Sen. Jack Reed (D-RI), the ranking member on the panel who graduated from West Point and served 20 for years in the Army. “I want to say for the record, I believe the investigation was insufficient.”\n\nTrump’s nominee responded flatly that he was “not in charge of FBI background checks,” which all cabinet appointees must undergo.\n\nReed also emphasized that “the secretary is responsible for leading a department of three and a half million service members and civilians, an annual budget of nearly $900 billion and hundreds of thousands of aircraft, ships, submarines, combat vehicles, satellites and the nuclear arsenal.”\n\n“Mr. Hegseth, I do not believe that you are qualified to meet the demands of this job,” he assessed. “You lack the character, composure and competence to hold the position of secretary of defense.”\n\n“You admittedly had issues with heavy drinking,” Sen. Mark Kelly (D-Ariz.), a retired Navy captain who flew combat missions during Operation Desert Storm, also said, later asking: “Have you overcome personal issues or are you the target of a smear campaign? It can’t be both.”\n\n“It’s clear to me that you’re not being honest with us or the American people because you know the truth would disqualify you from getting the job,” Kelly concluded. Hegseth had previously committed to not drink alcohol if confirmed.\n\nSen. Markwayne Mullin (R-Okla.) tore into his Democratic colleagues during questioning for being hypocrites about Hegseth’s flaws.\n\n”How many senators have showed up drunk to vote at night? Have any of you guys asked them to step down and resign from their job?” Mullin said. “And don’t tell me you haven’t seen it, because I know you have.”\n\nCommittee Chairman Roger Wicker (R-Miss.) in his opening statement proclaimed that Hegseth’s confirmation comes at “a moment of consequence.”\n\n“The United States faces the most dangerous security environment since World War II,” Wicker said, pointing to an “axis of aggressors” — including “China, Russia, Iran and North Korea.”\n\nIn opening statements introducing Hegseth, Rep. Mike Waltz (R-Fla.) commended Trump on his choice, arguing that it was a benefit — not a drawback — that the nominee would bring the experience of having been on the front lines in a lower rank.\n\n”He will bring the perspective of being the first secretary of defense to have served as a junior officer on the front lines — not in the headquarters, on the front lines — in the War on Terror,” said Waltz, President-elect Donald Trump’s national security adviser pick.\n\n“[He] recognizes the human costs, the financial costs and the policy drift, that was discussed often in this very room, that led us to decades and decades of war.”\n\nWaltz further commended Hegseth’s media experience, arguing that as an experienced communicator, he would be able to adeptly explain the nation’s national security risks to the public.\n\nThat quality would be a stark contrast to President Biden’s reclusive Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin, who only took questions at the Pentagon podium a handful of times during his four-year tenure.\n\nHegseth also committed to providing “accountability” for the Biden administration’s failures — including the chaotic withdrawal from Afghanistan and forced COVID-19 vaccinations, vowing to reinstate the 8,000 troops kicked out of their service branches for refusing to take the COVID jab.\n\n“Not only will they be reinstated,” he promised. “They will receive an apology, back pay and rank that they lost because they were forced out due to an experimental vaccine.”\n\n“People see me as someone who hosts a morning show on television — but people that really know me know where my heart is at,” Hegseth pointed out, recalling his days on deployment with friends in the “darkest and most difficult places you could ever be in.”\n\n“I’m doing this job for them.”","summary":"Defense Secretary-designate Pete Hegseth confidently asserted his fitness for the job Tuesday while being grilled by Senate Democrats about allegations of mismanagement, binge drinking and sexual misconduct.

I was a female in the military. We want to make sure that our military is getting back to lethality and really providing a fighting machine. And so, Pete can bring that. He can dewokify,” Rep.

Roger Wicker, R-Miss., said after Sen. Gary Peters, D-Mich., questioned Hegseth on his lack of experience leading larger organizations of more than 100 people. \n\nSen. Eric Schmitt, R-Mo., thanked Hegseth for his military service. He then said, \n\nI also want to thank you for your clarity in articulating the vision you have for the Department of Defense in restoring an ethos, a warrior ethos. Which is in stark contrast to the ethos we’ve seen the last four years, which is of weakness and wokeness.\n\n“Today, we start taking our military back. We can’t listen to all this woke crowd on the Left. All they want to do is block everything we’re going to do, slow President Trump down, slow the military down. We’ve got to take it back, and it starts today,” Sen. Tommy Tuberville, R-Ala., told The Daily Signal. \n\n“We can’t wait. We can’t stall getting him to the Pentagon, to get him on the job, and do what he has to do,” said Sen. Jim Banks, R-Ind.\n\nSen. John Cornyn, R-Texas, said in a press release:\n\nI’ve known Pete Hegseth for more than 10 years, and he’s been a leader in fighting for his fellow veterans here in the halls of Congress. He would reprioritize the Pentagon not on social engineering or woke policies, but rather on war fighting, lethality, and deterrence. The ultimate goal of the Department of Defense is to prevent wars, and the only way you do that is by peace through strength.\n\nSean Parnell, a longtime friend of Hegseth, told ThIfe Daily Signal after the hearing that he thought the confirmation went as well as it could have gone. He pointed out that Hegseth was mindful about reforming the Defense Department. “The policy stuff really matters to him, not just the top line stuff. And you know, sometimes in a hearing, you get seven minutes to reply, and there’s a lot of filibustering and grandstanding. But you know, he really gets this stuff at a deep, substantive level. And you know, his commitment to the war fighter really is unwavering, because he’s not far removed from being a war fighter.”\n\nAs the contentious hearing concluded, the mood was bright, seemingly undeterred from the tough questioning. Before he left, the nominee shook hands and smiled with his friends and the military veterans who had come out to support him.","summary":"Lawmakers and allies weighed in on Tuesday as the Senate Armed Services Committee held its confirmation hearing for Pete Hegseth, the former Army National Guard...

It said that they will be gradually released, as the authorities analyze the legal and humanitarian ways to make it happen.\n\nThe foreign ministry didn’t link the release of the prisoners to the US decision of lifting the designation as a state sponsor of terrorism, but “in the spirit of the Ordinary Jubilee of the year 2025 declared by His Holiness.”\n\nThe Cuban authorities didn’t say who is among the 553 people who will be released.\n\nThe determination by the outgoing one-term Democrat is likely to be reversed as early as next week after Trump, the Republican who is now president-elect, takes office and Secretary of State-designate Marco Rubio assumes the position of America’s top diplomat.\n\nRubio, whose family left Cuba in the 1950s before the communist revolution that brought Fidel Castro to power, has long been a proponent of sanctions on the communist island. Rubio will appear before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee on Wednesday for his confirmation hearing and is expected to address his Cuban roots in his testimony.\n\nTrump has also appointed Mauricio Claver-Carone, a former White House National Security Council aide and strong supporter of sanctions against Cuba, to be his special envoy to Latin America.\n\nIn the final days of Trump’s first administration, on Jan. 11, 2021, the White House reinstated the designation, which had been reversed during the period of rapprochement between Cuba and the United States during President Barack Obama’s second term in office. In doing so, the Trump administration cited Cuba’s support for Venezuela’s leader, Nicolas Maduro, and its refusal to extradite Colombian rebels to Colombia, among other issues, including its continued harboring of wanted Americans.\n\nThe move to designate Cuba by Trump was one of several foreign policy moves he made in the final days of his first term.\n\nAbout six months after Trump designated Cuba as a terror sponsor, the Biden administration levied new sanctions on island officials and the national revolutionary police after hundreds of Cubans were arrested during demonstrations in Havana and other cities to protest shortages, power outages and government policies. They were the first such protests since the 1990s.\n\nHuman rights groups and activists, including the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops, have been pressing the Biden administration to lift the designation to ease the suffering of Cuban people who feel the impact of Cuba’s economic isolation.\n\nCuba’s government recognized the announcement and expressed its gratitude, although it deemed it as “limited.”\n\n“Despite its limited scope, this is a decision that points to the right direction and is in line with the sustained and firm demand by the government and the people of Cuba,” the country’s foreign ministry said in a press release.\n\n“The decision announced today by the United States, rectifies, in a very limited way, some aspects of a cruel and unjust policy,” it added.\n\nCongress and the incoming Trump administration will have the opportunity to review and potentially reverse Biden’s actions, though the senior U.S. administration officials said the Biden administration had determined there was “no credible evidence” that Cuba was currently engaged in supporting international terrorism.\n\nThe Cuban foreign ministry said that the government is conscious that the incoming government in the U.S. could reverse the decision, but that it will remain “ready to develop a respectful relation with that country, based on dialogue and non-interference in the internal affairs of both countries, despite the differences.”\n\nThere was no immediate comment from the Trump transition team or from Rubio or his office, but one of his Republican colleagues on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, quickly denounced the Biden administration move.\n\n“Today’s decision is unacceptable on its merits,” Cruz said in a statement. “The terrorism advanced by the Cuban regime has not ceased. I will work with President Trump and my colleagues to immediately reverse and limit the damage from the decision.”\n\nRep. Carlos Gimenez, a Florida Republican, criticized the move and predicted that Trump would quickly reverse Biden’s decision.\n\n“President Biden is a pathetic coward,” Gimenez posted on X. “Come January 20th, there will be a NEW SHERIFF in town & President Trump alongside Secretary of State @SenMarcoRubio will not only put #Cuba BACK on the list but PULVERIZE the regime once & for all!”\n\nBiden in a national security memorandum issued Tuesday certified that Cuba hasn’t provided any support for international terrorism during the last six months and had provided the administration with assurances that it wouldn’t support acts of terrorism in the future.\n\nThe move comes after the administration in May removed Cuba from the State Department’s short list of countries that it deems less than fully cooperative against violent groups.\n\nAP writer Andrea Rodríguez in Havana, Cuba, contributed reporting.","summary":"The move would be part of a deal to free political prisoners and ease some economic pressure, though incoming U.S. president Donald Trump is expected to reverse the decision.","url":"https://globalnews.ca/news/10958875/biden-cuba-lifts-terrorism-designation-prisoners/","image":"https://globalnews.ca/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/20250114130140-20250114130140-6786afe6104bd28f7cf73580jpeg_191d15.jpg?quality=85&#038;strip=all","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-01-14 23:34:18","author":"Globalnews Digital,The Associated Press","authors":["Globalnews Digital","The Associated Press"],"language":"en","source_country":"ca","sentiment":-0.078},{"id":280425008,"title":"Podcast: Does the Bond Market Have It In for Donald Trump? - Bloomberg","text":"Why did this happen?\n\nPlease make sure your browser supports JavaScript and cookies and that you are not\n blocking them from loading.\n For more information you can review our Terms of\n Service and Cookie Policy.","summary":"Podcast: Does the Bond Market Have It In for Donald Trump?
