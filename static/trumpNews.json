Kemmelia Guy, a 20 year old clerk of Glen, appeared at the Serious Offences Court before Senior Magistrate, Colin John, on November 11, 2024, where she pleaded guilty to stealing various items of food and beverage from Richardson Motors in Arnos Vale.\n\nShe was charged that on October 21, 2024, she stole two BBQ Lays Chips valued at $6.00; two bottles of Tus-t Flavoured Water valued at $6.50; one Arizona tea valued at $5.00; two Fruta 250ml valued at $6.50; one bottle of Coca-Cola valued at $5.00; one Holiday snack valued at $1.50; two packs of Welch valued at $14.00 ; and one Bickles patty valued at $8.75- a total value of EC$53.75.\n\nOn October 22, 2024 – Guy was charged with the theft of two Caribbean Dreams valued at $9.50; one bottle of Sprite valued at $4.75; one bottle of Tus-t flavoured water valued at $3.25; one Devon biscuit valued at $3.25; one Bickles patty valued at $8.75; and two fruit slices valued at $20.50- a total value of EC$50.00.\n\nOn October 23, 2024 – in a separate incident, Guy stole one Bickles patty valued at $8.75; one bottle of Tus-t flavoured water valued at $3.25; one bottle of Ensure valued at $12.25; one Hyper Malt valued at $4.50; one Caribbean Delight biscuit valued at $4.75; one Devon biscuit valued at $3.25; and one Brownie slice valued at $4.50- a total value of EC$41.25.\n\nOn October 24, 2024 – Guy was further charged with stealing one Arizona drink valued at $5.00; one bottle of Ginger Ale valued at $4.75; one bottle of Coca-Cola valued at $5.00; one Dixie biscuit valued at $2.00; one bake and codfish valued at $6.00; one Bickles patty valued at $8.75; and one slice of lasagna valued at $10.50- total value, EC$42.00.\n\nOn October 29, 2024, Guy stole one box of Supligen Sea Moss valued at $7.75; one bottle of Tus-t water valued at $3.25; one Hyper Malt valued at $4.50; one burger valued at $13.75; one Bickles patty valued at $8.75; and one 1L Fruta box juice valued at $9.00- a total value of EC $47.00. The combined value of the items amounted to EC $234.00.\n\nThe facts are that on October 29, 2024 an employee asked the office manager to review the CCTV cameras because an item had fallen to the ground when a female was in the store earlier, and the employee wanted to know what it was, and what had taken place. The office manager reviewed the cameras and observed that Guy entered the store and removed several items from the shelves, placed them into a bag and exited the store without paying for them.\n\nThe office manager reviewed the cameras and observed Guy stealing similar items from the store on later dates. The matter was reported to the police and Guy was arrested for theft. After the facts were read, Guy told the Senior Magistrate that she left secondary school at form four because she got pregnant.\n\nShe said her son is four years old and his father does not take care of him. Guy also said that it “make no sense” to take the father to Family court as he still would not take care of his son. She said that she has no one to take care of her son and she is not prepared to go to prison. The Senior Magistrate sentenced her to three months imprisonment. However, the Magistrate suspended the sentence for three months. Guy also was ordered to pay compensation in one month. Failure to do so will result in three months imprisonment. The sentences will run concurrently.\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n {\"carousel\":\"Carousel\"} \r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n ALSO IN THE

Former securities and exchange commission chairman, Jay Clayton, is expected to get the post.\n\n With his leaving, doubt hangs over the cases of Mayor Adams and P Diddy as to whether they will proceed under the new US Attorney.\n\n Williams is the first black man to be appointed United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York in its more than 200 years of existence.\n\n A second generation Jamaican, Williams was confirmed by the United States Senate in 2021 to head one of the most powerful US Attorney's offices in the United States.\n\n Follow The Gleaner on X and Instagram @JamaicaGleaner and on Facebook @GleanerJamaica.

In a series of posts on X, the world’s richest man and proponent of driverless cars targeted the tri-service fighter jet program while coming out in favor of uncrewed aircraft. “Manned fighter jets are obsolete in the age of drones,” he wrote on Monday. In another instance, Musk responded with the “100” emoji to another user’s tweet that “Drone superiority is the new air superiority.” He also shared a video of Chinese drones and said “Meanwhile, some idiots are still building manned fighter jets like the F-35.” The comments set up a potential rift between Musk and Trump, who spent the better part of his first presidential term touting his involvement in bringing the cost of the Lockheed Martin program down and then singing the praises of the fifth-generation stealth aircraft, saying in rallies that the plane is “invisible.” Musk’s position as co-leader of a new advisory group meant to combat government inefficiency, however, means that defense producers are now looking to the tech billionaire for cues about government acquisition. The Department of Government Efficiency is tasked with helping the government reduce spending and cut regulations. A spokesperson for Lockheed Martin, which produces the jet in partnership with Northrop Grumman and BAE, defended the F-35 as an advanced aircraft key to many operations, adding that the company looks forward to working with the Trump administration and the new Congress. The F-35 program is the Defense Department’s most expensive program, topping out at a projected cost of $2 trillion, according to the U.S. Government Accountability Office, with more than $183 billion in cost-overruns. While advocates have praised the plane’s capabilities, the rise of drones in Ukraine and elsewhere has prompted debate over whether the United States is investing enough in unmanned systems and other emerging tech that cost orders of magnitude less than typical Pentagon programs. Those within the drone industry, meanwhile, warmed to Musk's focus on autonomous systems. “We're a perfect fit for this new government,” said Jeff Thompson, CEO of Red Cat, whose subsidiary Teal recently won an Army competition to field thousands of small drones for the infantry.","url":"https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2024/11/25/congress/musk-makes-the-case-for-drones-00191606","image":"https://www.politico.com/dims4/default/0dd7472/2147483647/resize/1200x/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.politico.com%2F6f%2F7c%2Ff3f2a0954240b58b79851963c77e%2Ftrump-spacex-27544.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-11-26 01:11:33","author":"Sam Skove","authors":["Sam Skove"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.19},{"id":267417664,"title":"White House Hires 00191601","text":"President-elect Donald Trump has announced three more members of his White House team, including a senior aide to Sen. JD Vance who will work with Congress to push the administration’s agenda. James Braid, Vance’s deputy chief of staff, will serve as director of the Office of Legislative Affairs, Trump said in a statement Monday. His appointment was announced alongside that of Matt Brasseaux to serve as director of the Office of Political Affairs and Alex Latcham as director of the Office of Public Liaison. Trump has filled nearly all of the members of his Cabinet in the three weeks since he won reelection. Braid’s role will be crucial to the extension of tax cuts and other key pieces of the Trump administration’s agenda. He worked for the Office of Management and Budget in the first term.

It holds that a criminal prosecution of a sitting president would violate the US Constitution by undermining the ability of the country's chief executive to function. Courts will still have to approve both requests from prosecutors.\n\nThe prosecutors in a filing in the election subversion case said the department's policy requires the case to be dismissed before Trump returns to the White House.\n\n\"This outcome is not based on the merits or strength of the case against the defendant,\" prosecutors wrote in the filing.\n\nProsecutors in the documents case signaled they will still ask a federal appeals court to bring back the case against two Trump associates who had been accused of obstructing that investigation.\n\nTrump spokesman Steven Cheung hailed what he called \"a major victory for the rule of law.\"\n\nTrump had faced criminal charges in four cases - the two brought by Smith and two in state courts in New York and Georgia. He was convicted in the New York case while the Georgia case, which also relates to his efforts to overturn the 2020 election, is in limbo.\n\nIn a post on social media, Trump railed on Monday against the legal cases as a \"low point in the History of our Country.\"\n\nThe moves by Smith, who was appointed in 2022 by US Attorney General Merrick Garland, represents a remarkable shift from the special prosecutor who obtained indictments against Trump in two separate cases accusing him of crimes that threatened US election integrity and national security. Prosecutors acknowledged that the election of a president who faced ongoing criminal cases created an unprecedented predicament for the Justice Department.\n\nChutkan left open the possibility that prosecutors could seek to charge Trump again after he leaves office, but prosecutors would likely face challenges bringing a case so long after conduct involved in the case happened.\n\nTrump pleaded not guilty in August 2023 to four federal charges accusing him of conspiring to obstruct the collection and certification of votes following his 2020 loss to Democrat Joe Biden.\n\nTrump, who as president will again oversee the Justice Department, was expected to order an end to the federal 2020 election case and to Smith's appeal in the documents case.\n\nFlorida-based Judge Aileen Cannon, who Trump appointed to the federal bench, had dismissed the classified documents case in July, ruling that Smith was improperly appointed to his role as special counsel.\n\nSmith's office had been appealing that ruling and indicated on Monday that the appeal would continue as it relates to Trump personal aide Walt Nauta and Carlos De Oliveira, a manager at his Mar-a-Lago resort, who had been previously charged alongside Trump in the case. Both Nauta and De Oliveria have pleaded not guilty, as did Trump.\n\nIn the 2020 election case, Trump's lawyers had previously said they would seek to dismiss the charges based on a US Supreme Court ruling in July that former presidents have broad immunity from prosecution over official actions taken while in the White House.\n\nTrump denied wrongdoing in all cases and argued that the US legal system had been turned against him to damage his presidential campaign. He vowed during the campaign that he would fire Smith if he returned to the presidency.\n\nTrump in May became the first former president to be convicted of a crime when a jury in New York found him guilty of felony charges relating to hush money paid to a porn star before the 2016 election. His sentencing in that case has been indefinitely postponed.\n\nThe criminal case against Trump in Georgia state court involving the 2020 election is stalled.","url":"https://www.thedailystar.net/news/world/news/judge-tosses-trump-2020-election-case-after-prosecutors-request-3761816","image":"https://tds-images.thedailystar.net/sites/default/files/styles/very_big_201/public/images/2024/11/26/donald_trump_swag.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-11-26 01:08:05","author":"Reuters","authors":["Reuters"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"bd","sentiment":-0.218},{"id":267417680,"title":"Russian State TV Host Threatens Strikes on NATO Countries","text":"Russian state TV propagandist Vladimir Solovyov has warned that Russian President Vladimir Putin may soon order strikes on European NATO members as Moscow's war with Ukraine continues.The Russia-Ukraine war has recently escalated following President Joe Biden's decision authorizing Kyiv to use U.S.-made weapons to strike targets inside Russia.

She did so after U.S. special counsel Jack Smith acknowledged in a court filing that long-standing Justice Department policy precluded prosecution of a sitting president.\n\nIn another court filing, Smith also asked an appellate court in Atlanta to remove Trump from a pending appeal. The prosecutor had originally filed the appeal seeking to reinstate dismissed charges that Trump hoarded hundreds of classified national security documents at his oceanside estate in Florida when he left the presidency in 2021.\n\nThe prosecutor said he stood behind the merits of both indictments against Trump, even as he said the charges should be dropped.\n\nTrump, on the Truth Social media platform, declared, \"These cases, like all of the other cases I have been forced to go through, are empty and lawless, and should never have been brought.\"\n\nHe said that more than $100 million in taxpayer money \"has been wasted in the Democrat Party’s fight against their Political Opponent, ME. It was a political hijacking, and a low point in the History of our Country that such a thing could have happened, and yet, I persevered, against all odds, and WON.\"\n\nDuring his campaign, Trump vowed that if he was elected for a second nonconsecutive term, he would fire Smith \"within two seconds\" of assuming the presidency again. But U.S. news accounts say Smith plans to leave the Justice Department ahead of Trump's taking office.\n\nIn the Washington case, Trump, a Republican, was accused of pressuring state officials after the 2020 election to change election results that showed Democrat Joe Biden had defeated him and of spreading lies that Biden won only because of massive vote fraud and election irregularities.\n\nThe prosecutor asked Chutkan to dismiss the case \"without prejudice,\" leaving open the possibility that the charges could be renewed after Trump leaves office a second time in January 2029.\n\nAs Smith’s lengthy investigations have wound on without the cases going to trial, some U.S. legal analysts have said Trump, when he assumes office again, could try to pardon himself to end his legal jeopardy with certainty, an action no president has ever tried before.\n\nIn Atlanta, Smith asked a federal appellate court to drop Trump as a co-defendant from the special counsel’s appeal of a ruling by U.S. District Judge Aileen Cannon.\n\nCannon, a Trump appointee, had dismissed the classified documents case on the ground that Smith had been illegally appointed as special counsel.\n\nThe decision by Cannon broke with legal precedent, which sanctioned the appointment of special counsels, to agree with Trump’s lawyers that Smith was unlawfully appointed.\n\nTrump was accused in the case overseen by Cannon of hoarding classified documents at Mar-a-Lago, his home and private club alongside the Atlantic coastline in Florida.\n\nTrump and co-defendants Carlos De Oliveira and Waltine (Walt) Nauta were accused of trying to obstruct government efforts to retrieve the documents, which U.S. law mandated be turned over to the National Archives as Trump left office in January 2021.\n\nSmith asked the appeals court to remove Trump from the case but to leave his co-defendants in the case, which could allow the appeal of Cannon’s dismissal to continue after Trump assumes power again.\n\nIn his filing in Washington, Smith said the Justice Department’s prohibition on taking sitting presidents to trial \"is categorical and does not turn on the gravity of the crimes charged, the strength of the Government’s proof, or the merits of the prosecution, which the Government stands fully behind.\"\n\nThe cases being heard by Chutkan in Washington and Cannon in Florida had dragged on for months, with Trump’s lawyers filing numerous legal challenges to the charges.\n\nTrump eventually won a broad ruling from the Supreme Court earlier this year, saying that Trump and all former presidents were immune from prosecution for any official actions they had taken while president but not for unofficial acts.\n\nUntil Trump defeated Vice President Kamala Harris in the November 5 election and foreclosed Smith’s prosecution of the 2020 election interference indictment, the prosecutor was recasting his election interference case against Trump to account for the restrictions imposed by the Supreme Court.\n\nIn a statement after Smith’s two court filings, Trump’s running mate in the election, Vice President-elect JD Vance, cited Trump’s legal peril as he ran for a new four-year term in the White House.\n\n\"If Donald J.

There are not any cases known to be associated with raw milk consumption, but the risks associated with raw milks have been long established.\n\nThe Food and Drug Administration has previously warned of the possible dangers of drinking raw milk.\n\nIn a statement from May 2024, it warned, \"Raw milk can carry dangerous germs such as Salmonella, E. coli, Listeria, Campylobacter, and others that cause foodborne illness, often called 'food poisoning.'\"\n\nRaw milk products do not undergo pasteurization, which is a heating process that kills bacteria and viruses.\n\nPasteurized milk and dairy products, however, are safe to consume because the heating process kills pathogens that can cause illness -- including bird flu.\n\nHowever, raw milk does have its proponents, including Robert F.

Trump, will be inaugurated as President on January 20, 2025,\" Smith's motion said. \"It has long been the position of the Department of Justice that the United States Constitution forbids the federal indictment and subsequent criminal prosecution of a sitting President. But the Department and the country have never faced the circumstance here, where a federal indictment against a private citizen has been returned by a grand jury and a criminal prosecution is already underway when the defendant is elected President.\"\n\n\"Confronted with this unprecedented situation, the Special Counsel's Office consulted with the Department's Office of Legal Counsel (OLC), whose interpretation of constitutional questions such as those raised here is binding on Department prosecutors. After careful consideration, the Department has determined that OLC's prior opinions concerning the Constitution's prohibition on federal indictment and prosecution of a sitting President apply to this situation and that as a result this prosecution must be dismissed before the defendant is inaugurated,\" said the motion.\n\n\"That prohibition is categorical and does not turn on the gravity of the crimes charged, the strength of the Government's proof, or the merits of the prosecution, which the Government stands fully behind,\" the motion said.\n\nEarlier this month, Chutkan canceled the remaining deadlines in the case after Smith requested time to \"assess this unprecedented circumstance and determine the appropriate course going forward consistent with Department of Justice policy\" following Trump's election.\n\nTrump last year pleaded not guilty to federal charges of undertaking a \"criminal scheme\" to overturn the results of the 2020 election by enlisting a slate of so-called \"fake electors,\" using the Justice Department to conduct \"sham election crime investigations,\" trying to enlist the vice president to \"alter the election results,\" and promoting false claims of a stolen election during the Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol, all in an effort to subvert democracy and remain in power.\n\nSmith subsequently charged Trump in a superseding indictment that was adjusted to respect the Supreme Court's July ruling that Trump is entitled to immunity from criminal prosecution for official acts undertaken as president.\n\nJudge Chutkan had been in the process of considering how the case should proceed in light of the Supreme Court's immunity ruling.\n\nSmith had faced filing deadlines of Dec. 2 for both the election interference case and the classified documents case against Trump, after Smith's team requested more time to determine how to face the unprecedented situation of pending federal cases against someone who had just been elected to the presidency.\n\nGetting this filing in a week ahead of schedule now raises the question of whether Smith will be able to beat the clock to officially close his office down and submit his final report to Attorney General Merrick Garland -- as is required of him per the DOJ's special counsel regulations -- before Inauguration Day.\n\nThe final report will have to go through a classification review by the intelligence community, a process that can sometimes take weeks before it is approved for any kind of public release.\n\nThis is a developing story.

In an interview Saturday at the New York Press Club's Journalism Conference, Licht said it was his \"mission\" when he was hired to restore America's \"trust\" in CNN and chalked up his firing as mere \"business.\" He said he even remains friends with the man who fired him, parent company Warner Brother Discovery CEO David Zaslav. Licht was then asked by ESPN's Stephen A. Smith whether he could \"pinpoint\" what exactly led to his firing, citing examples like the CNN Trump town hall and the now-infamous Atlantic profile that painted him in a negative light, both having sparked backlash among staff. \"When you try to change something dramatically, you can't do it alone. You've got to build the trust of the organization. They have to believe in you. And I did not build that trust,\" Licht said. \"I was not able to, in the time that I was there, build trust so that people would tune out the noise and sort of follow me into that.\" CNN CEO CHRIS LICHT'S BIG MESS: INSIDERS SAY HE'S LOST NEWSROOM AFTER TRUMP TOWN HALL, BRUTAL ATLANTIC STORY \"Because of time?

It was a crazy – I think everyone could objectively say it was a crazy time, particularly in that organization, but I'm not letting myself off the hook.\" \"I think when you try to have a bold way of going forward, you have to be confident and you have to show confidence in it so people follow you, but there's a fine line between confidence and arrogance and I still work on dialing that and I think sometimes I was on the wrong side of that.\" \"The Atlantic article I absolutely should not have done,\" he continued. \"Speaking of arrogance, imagine saying yes after, by the way, saying no several times, but at the end, saying yes because you know what, when this comes out in a year, I will have saved everything. This is gonna be an article that's going to be so positive because in a year, I did it. Imagine that arrogance now that I look back. Now, I hadn't failed at anything before.

That was the first time he answered very tough questions in a long time. And the fact that his shtick resonated with voters in New Hampshire, that's part of the story, but people at home had to be told that and that's one thing I would have done differently,\" Licht said. He continued, \"So why was it? I think it's all of that… There are those that didn't want change, and how I reacted to those people, you know, I picked some fights I shouldn't have picked. There's some things I should – some alliances I should have built, or people I should have trusted more. There's people I should have trusted less. But, you know, there's not a leader in any organization that doesn't have those self-reflections.\" A spokesperson for CNN declined to comment. Licht was handpicked by Zaslav in 2022 to help revive CNN's viewership and restore its journalistic credibility after the network spent years building a reputation for being an anti-Trump news organization under Licht's predecessor, Jeff Zucker.

Among his major moves were dismissing prominent liberal on-air figures, including Brian Stelter, Don Lemon and Jeffrey Toobin. However, Licht had completely lost the trust of CNN staff after the network hosted Trump town hall in May 2023, which sparked unprecedented fury from within the newsroom. Licht was fired by Zaslav weeks later. Fast-forward to November 2024 as financial woes and dismal viewership continue to plague the network. Many of Licht's decisions were reversed – Stelter was rehired as a media analyst, Toobin and Lemon have made multiple appearances as guests – and CNN's anti-Trump coverage came back in a roaring fashion through Election Day.

I’ll pay you millions for it.”Earlier, Trump was also seen playing golf with his granddaughter Kai Trump, who has set her sights on surpassing his “club championship” record.When not on the golf course, Trump has been focused on selecting his cabinet members and political appointees for his incoming administration. Over the weekend, he was seen dining with his wife Melania, her father Victor Knavs, and his son Barron Trump, who is on a break from his studies at New York University. Trump also met with key advisers, including Elon Musk, as he continues to shape his leadership team for his next term.Enhanced security following assassination attemptsThe Secret Service has significantly increased security at Trump’s events and properties following two assassination attempts in recent months. In addition to the September 15 incident, Trump narrowly escaped another attack at a July rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, where a gunman fired at him, wounding him in the ear.Mar-a-Lago, Trump’s private residence, has seen security measures tightened considerably.According to The New York Post, the northern entrance to the estate has been closed off, requiring members to detour through West Palm Beach. The resort and its surrounding areas are regularly swept by Secret Service and Department of Homeland Security officers when Trump is on-site, with members subjected to rigorous airline-style security checks.","url":"https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/watch-president-elect-donald-trump-now-makes-his-return-to-golf-greens-after-white-house-comeback/articleshow/115673020.cms","image":"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/resizemode-4,width-1280,height-720,msid-115673036/115673036.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-11-26 00:57:27","author":"Toi World Desk","authors":["Toi World Desk"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"in","sentiment":0.325},{"id":267411842,"title":"Will Us President Joe Biden Attend Donald Trumps Inauguration White House Answers","text":"US President Joe Biden will attend Donald Trump's inauguration in January, the White House said on Monday.

It's true that ultra-processed foods could spell disaster for your health in the long run. Processing usually changes a food's natural state and robs it off its essential nutrients.Many ingredients are added to them in the process be it sugar, salt, fat, and artificial colors or preservatives. Moreover, additives like artificial colours and flavours or stabilisers are added to them. Frozen meals, soft drinks, hot dogs and cold cuts, fast food, packaged cookies, cakes, and salty snacks are examples of ultra-processed foods.Here are 10 health risks of ultra-processed foods.1. Heart diseaseGorging on your favourite ultra-processed food may look harmless at the moment, but in long run, it could have a significant impact on your heart health. A study published in the Lancet journal found that eating more ultra-processed foods (UPFs) is linked to higher risks of cardiovascular disease (CVD) and coronary heart disease (CHD) in US adults. Studies from different countries also suggest a slight increase in stroke risk.2. Type 2 diabetesUltra-processed foods have high amounts of hidden sugar, unhealthy fats, and refined carbohydrates, all of which make for a deadly combination in contributing to the development of insulin resistance and metabolic syndrome. People who add less fibre, vitamins, minerals and unprocessed foods to their diet are likely to increase their chances of Type 2 diabetes.3. Mental health disordersEating junk food regularly can wreak havoc on your mental health. A study published in the journal Nutrients found that higher intake of UPFs was associated with a 53% increase in odds of common mental disorder symptoms, including depression and anxiety.1093723024. CancerProcessed food consumption could do greater damage to your body than you ever imagined. According to The Lancet Planetary Health, increased intake of processed foods can raise your risk of overall cancer, head and neck cancers, oesophageal squamous cell carcinoma, colon cancer, rectal cancer, hepatocellular carcinoma, and postmenopausal breast cancer.5. ObesityEating junk food can make you put on unhealthy amount of weight. Ultra-processed products are energy-dense and high in saturated and trans fat, added sugar, and sodium, which can lead to obesity and its associated health issues.1156683486. Junk food addictionUltra-processed foods are highly addictive and there is a reason why it provides comfort upon eating. Eating these foods activate reward centers of the brain in ways similar to something like nicotine or alcohol. People commonly experience strong cravings for these ultra-processed foods, and this can turn into addiction.7. Digestive issuesJunk foods are low in fibre and essential nutrients and high in unhealthy fats, sugar, and additives. This can affect digestion and cause a variety of gut health problems.8. Nutrient deficiencyUltra-processed foods are low in vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants, the nutrients that nourish the body and perform many important functions. When you are overindulging in these foods, you may develop nutritional deficiencies.1121078259. High cholesterolJunk food or ultra-processed food is prepared using hydrogenated oils, which are high in trans fats. They can raise LDL cholesterol levels.10. MortalityA review, published in the British Medical Journal (BMJ) in 2024, found that eating more ultra-processed foods is linked to a higher risk of dying from any cause and is linked to 32 health conditions, including heart disease, mental health disorders, type 2 diabetes, and other problems.97691217","url":"https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/life-style/health-fitness/health-news/10-health-risks-of-ultra-processed-foods/articleshow/115668305.cms","image":"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/resizemode-4,width-1280,height-720,msid-115668338/115668338.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-11-26 00:57:27","author":"Toi Lifestyle Desk","authors":["Toi Lifestyle Desk"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"in","sentiment":0.409},{"id":267411780,"title":"Karoline Leavitt Family And Love Life All About Her Husband Nick And Their Son Nicholas","text":"President-elect Donald Trump has announced Karoline Leavitt to be his press secretary, in his next administration.

Leavitt studied communications and political science at Saint Anselm College, a Catholic college in her home state. During her school days, Leavitt has interned at Fox News and in Trump's White House press office. In 2020, she told Politico that she gained her ‘first glimpse into the world of the press’ through these experiences. She also added that the same experience prompted her to pursue a career in press relations. The website for her 2022 run for Congress confirms that after graduating in 2019, Leavitt started working for the first Trump White House, as a presidential speechwriter and later as assistant press secretary. After her White House tenure, Leavitt was appointed as communications director for a senior Republican Congresswoman Elise Stefanik.

This includes the renewed use of anti-personnel mines by some of the Parties to the Convention, as well as some Parties falling behind in their commitments to destroy these weapons,' he said in the statement.\n\n NO TO LANDMINES Cambodia Prime Minister Hun Manet looks on as Armida Alisjahbana, UN undersecretary general, speaks to Ly Thuch, first vice president of the Cambodian Mine Action Authority, at the Siem Reap-Angkor Summit on a Mine free World landmine conference on Nov. 25, 2024.

REUTERS PHOTOTwo weeks of acrimonious negotiations in Azerbaijan's capital Baku resulted in a deal for $300 billion in annual climate finance by 2035. Many developing countries said the pledge would not be enough to help them deliver robust national climate plans.While private sector investment was teased throughout the summit — including in a multilateral development bank pledge to mobilize $65 billion of it each year — the devil will be in the details.Some of those details could come up in discussions between countries in the run-up to next year's COP30 summit, where they will be mapping out their next set of emissions-cutting plans.Countries are meant to submit their national climate plans in February, but many have said they will miss the deadline.Businesses have called for those plans to include projects and efforts that are 'investment ready' — and with as much specificity as possible — to help investors gauge their long-term commitments and risks.Money will start flowing only after the shared goals agreed at events like COP29 are translated into 'regulation, legislation and other policy measures,' said Thomas Tayler, head of climate finance at asset manager Aviva Investors.Equally important will be showing commitment to implementing these policies and rules and reporting on their progress, Tayler said.Mixed energy messagesWhile climate negotiations are hard going even at the best of times, the latest round began in Baku only a week after Trump, a climate denier, won the Nov. 5 US presidential election. Few expect Trump to deliver climate finance from the world's biggest economy or to protect US policies friendly for climate investment.While countries at COP29 set the new $300 billion climate finance target, they guaranteed the sum only by 2035, though they pledged to prioritize the most vulnerable nations for those funds.They also have begun discussing new potential revenue streams such as global taxes — on polluting industries such as aviation and cargo shipping, on oil and gas trades, on financial transactions and on super-wealthy people.While these efforts could help to make infrastructure projects more appealing in riskier parts of the world, the work of attracting profit-focused investors is still in progress.The world's green energy transition has already been slowed by war in Ukraine and a resulting energy crisis, with governments slowing green reforms and companies like BP and Unilever rowing back on their efforts.On that point, COP29 did not help. Amid lobbying by countries including Saudi Arabia, according to several country sources at COP29, the summit failed to offer any steps for furthering last year's COP28 pledges to shift away from fossil fuels and to triple their renewable capacity by 2030.'The influence of fossil fuel lobbies remains a significant obstacle that must be addressed ahead of COP30 if it is to deliver meaningful progress,' said David King, chairman of the Climate Crisis Advisory Group.Carbon BoonFor companies involved in carbon removal projects, COP29 offered a rosier outlook by delivering a long-fought agreement to resolve rules for trading national carbon offsets, including establishing a central registry that can also issue those credits and track their sales.The hope is that clarity around the market structure will encourage countries and companies to invest while also addressing their worries about reputational risk. The deal, however, made clear that the UN registry's involvement did not amount to an automatic seal of approval for the quality of credits.'There's a lot more financing to be done on the basis of this agreement,' said Eliot Whittington, chief systems change officer at Cambridge Institute for Sustainability Leadership.","url":"https://www.manilatimes.net/2024/11/26/business/foreign-business/business-seeks-details-on-cop29-climate-message/2010931","image":"https://www.manilatimes.net/manilatimes/uploads/images/2024/11/26/475907.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-11-26 00:56:50","author":"Reuters","authors":["Reuters"],"language":"en","source_country":"ph","sentiment":-0.18},{"id":267410150,"title":"Policy Regularity Urged As Political Row Mounts","text":"THE government should reassure investors of continued policy regularity amid a worsening rift between the country's two top officials, the president of the Management Association of the Philippines (MAP) said.The country's competitiveness, MAP chief Rene Almendras told reporters on Monday, is determined in part by its image and reputation.'[M]ost important to business is consistency and regularity of policy,' he said.\n\n MAP chief Rene Almendras. PHOTOS BY J. GERARD SEGUIA'I am hoping that that will continue to be and will be emphasized as we go through these politically challenging times.'President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. and Vice President Sara Duterte, who allied in 2022 to overwhelmingly win the elections that year, have been increasingly at loggerheads due to differing political agendas.Among others, Marcos has embraced the United States, reversing the pivot to China made by his predecessor, Sara Duterte's father Rodrigo. The former president also faces an international probe over his deadly war on drugs and the current government recently said it could cooperate with investigators.Sara Duterte, widely expected to run for the presidency in 2028, has faced criticism over her use of confidential funds as Education secretary.She quit the post earlier this year and then refused to attend legislative hearings regarding the Office of the Vice President's budget, leading to the House of Representatives slashing the outlay for next year.As the rift widened, the vice president made it to the global news when she claimed over the weekend that she had hired an assassin to kill Marcos, First lady Liza Araneta-Marcos and House Speaker Martin Romualdez — Marcos' cousin who is also said to be eyeing the presidency in 2028 — should a plot to kill her succeed.Marcos on Monday vowed to 'fight back' and the Justice department said that Duterte would have to face the consequences of threatening to have the country's top official assassinated.Almendras also pointed to uncertainties over Donald Trump's return to the White House and said the Philippines would have to prepare for possible protectionist policies that could affect trade with the United States — the country's biggest export market.'We need to exist in the community of nations, one way or the other,' he said.

Key drivers include the growing rivalry between the United States and China, the centrality of multipolar actors like Asean, and challenges like climate change and cybersecurity. The latest geopolitical event with profound consequential implications is the return of Donald Trump to the global stage. Half of America, its allies, and the world's geoeconomic centers are anxious to know what the return of Trump will mean for America and the world.Trump campaigned on a platform that will surely test the stability, strength and integrity of American institutions such as the Supreme Court, Senate, Congress, the intelligence community, homeland security, justice, defense and health. Does he still loathe the NATO alliance and the idea of saving Ukraine? Do his cabinet appointees possess the right stuff to deal with the world Trump is now inheriting, which is far more dangerous today than in 2016-2020? America's democracy, national security and global leadership are on the line.How will he, at the helm of a divided America where two-thirds of the population is fed up with its political polarization, deal with its dangerous adversaries, such as Russia, China, Iran and North Korea, that are strategically aligned and hard at work in changing the world order through their orchestrated moves in the US, Europe, the Middle East, the Indo-Pacific, and even parts of Africa and Latin America? Does he still have the same mindset as when he was the 45th President of the United States? Will he be able to steer America to become a better paradigm?The cases of Vietnam and Afghanistan come to mind. America ended its involvement in those war theaters due to serious erosion of public and bipartisan support, war fatigue, and strategic reorientation to sustain its hold as the world's leader. The consequences were Vietnam's fall to communism and the return of the Taliban in Afghanistan. In both cases, America lost, and its adversaries won, leaving its allies and the Free World badly shaken. The Philippines is aware that it's caught between the US and China, more so when the clash of arms begins.We're tethered to the US as a security ally. Anything that happens to it has dire implications, direct and indirect, to our national well-being. Moreover, the US, China and Japan are our top three trade partners. What will happen to ours when theirs are impacted by war? We're also in catch-up mode in modernizing the Armed Forces, but so far, it's been too little, too late. It's way behind schedule and continually falling below minimum budget requirements, equivalent to 2 percent of GDP. Equally important, civil defense preparations have yet to get underway for the self-reliance, safety, security and survival of our communities.What key risks do we have to attend to?1. Maritime and territorial disputes: China's gray zone tactics in the South China Sea are affecting our national interests, sovereignty and sovereign rights.2. Economic vulnerability: Over-reliance on our geoeconomic partners, who also happen to be geopolitical protagonists.3. Cybersecurity and Critical Infrastructure: Cyberattacks targeting government systems, financial institutions, and infrastructure.4. Energy security: Energy imports are vulnerable to global price volatility and supply disruptions.5. Climate and disaster risks: Intensifying extreme weather events are derailing development plans, impacting food supply, and forcing mass evacuations.As the brushstrokes above suggest, geopolitical risks create interconnected challenges and elevate the importance of preparedness to mitigate the ripple effects of future crises, e.g., infrastructure delays, public safety concerns, and corporate security pressures.As I see it, the US will remain the most powerful nation on earth but will be less dominant in an increasingly multipolar international system. Leadership change is occurring throughout the democratic Free World, such as in the US, the UK, Europe, Japan, Indonesia, Singapore and elsewhere, while dictators remain firmly in place. This is a dangerous time for the US and the free world when democracy is under siege by authoritarian powers. Transition and settling-in periods are at high risk for exploitation. The risks for armed inter-state and intra-state conflicts will grow. International relations will be more competitive and uncertain.I also foresee a high-intensity conflict in the Indo-Pacific region in all domains, including outer space. China is undeterred from its core interest to become a superpower. It could begin with an accidental or a premeditated skirmish that could rapidly escalate into total war, including weapons of mass destruction. WMD terrorism as time goes by. Of concern is how the diffusion of WMD technologies will increase the capacity of non-state actors to acquire and employ them. WMD attacks will precipitate global economic, financial, and social upheavals equivalent to, or worse than, the impacts and consequences of the world wars in the 20th century.A whole-of-nation mindset is crucial to deal effectively with the worsening VUCA situation we're in. Situational awareness and proper messaging are vital. What can be done to attain a modicum of preparedness? Specific suggestions include:– Communications and information strategies to build situational awareness.– Transform the mindsets and behavior of our government, business and civic leaders.– Organize centralized command structures and craft crisis management plans.– Build collaborative frameworks such as public-private partnerships.– Diversify resources and redundancies to optimize overall resilience.– Invest in joint technology and innovation for real-time monitoring and early warning.– Cybersecurity collaboration through Information Sharing and Analysis Centers.– Build capacity and trust through joint training, simulations, and public engagement.– Adapt governance to undertake scenario planning and decentralize decisions.– Engage in many whole-of-government, society, and nation drills to test readiness.What infuriates is the gutter politics practiced by our public officials that we're being subjected to ad nauseam instead of focusing their energies on the needs of the nation. The world's experiencing what seems to be the early stages of an undeclared world war, yet good governance and public service are nowhere to be found. How unlucky could we be?Rafael M.

When people think about US-China mutual interdependence, a typical example could be an affluent Beijing or Shanghai consumer driving a Tesla vehicle, holding a Starbucks cup, and swiping on an iPhone.\nThe chief executives of these companies have become goodwill ambassadors. Tesla founder Elon Musk had the privilege of entering the Zhongnanhai compound, the heavily guarded working and residential area for top Chinese leaders, on almost every one of his China visits in recent years. Apple CEO Tim Cook is the head of an international advisory body for a school at the prestigious Tsinghua University, which provides direct access to Chinese state leaders on a regular basis. In 2021, Chinese President Xi Jinping wrote to Howard Schultz, the chairman emeritus of Starbucks, encouraging his company to play a positive role in advancing economic and trade ties between the two countries.\nThe cosy relationships, however, may see challenges during the second presidential term of Donald Trump due to changing market conditions and the deteriorating state of US-China ties. First of all, the Chinese market has become harder to crack for these brands. Starbucks, after years of expansion in China, is finding that its high-priced lattes and esoteric brews are increasingly out of step with changing consumption patterns. It is seeking a “strategic partnership”, a term that implies it is looking for a buyer for its China operations. In one scenario, Starbucks could become a pure franchise like McDonald’s and Coca-Cola in China – the brand is still a US one but the mainland business is run by Chinese companies.\n\nApple’s iPhone, the only visible foreign smartphone brand in China, is facing fierce competition from local brands from Huawei Technologies to Xiaomi. No one in China would be crazy enough to trade a kidney for an iPhone as a teenager did in 2011. Tesla is facing similarly fierce competition in the electric vehicle sector where local brands are catching up in design and production capabilities.\nSecondly, the fragmentation of data management systems may result in higher costs for US brands in China. The Great Firewall has always been an obstacle for foreign internet firms such as Google and Facebook. Mark Zuckerberg’s well-documented and failed attempts to bring his social media services to China were a clear signal that Beijing was not willing to compromise cybersecurity to entertain US business plans.\nIn the era of artificial intelligence and big data, however, almost every cross-border business will face the same challenges. Apple is still waiting for Beijing’s approval to bring Apple Intelligence to mainland iPhone users, even though Cook has made three visits to China this year, while Tesla is pending Chinese approval for its full self-driving technology.\n\nThe two companies are likely to eventually receive the greenlight. Apple and Tesla are also expected to comply with strict data localisation and protection rules, just as ByteDance’s TikTok had to comply with equally strict data regulations in the US.\nAnother challenge for these US executives will be a potential political backlash at home, given that the climate in Washington is such that even normal business engagement with China is subject to heightened scrutiny. A US lawmaker has already warned that Musk’s ties with Beijing could be exploited, posing a national security risk, a far-fetched allegation that would be hard to imagine only a few years earlier.\nAs strategic rivalry between China and the US intensifies, many US corporations – once considered role models for business success in China – have had to cut their China exposure. It is a destabilising development since business ties have been seen as the “ballast stone” to stabilise the ship of US-China relations. In this regard, the continued success of Apple, Tesla and Starbucks in China is important not only for the companies but also for the broader bilateral relationship.","url":"https://www.scmp.com/opinion/china-opinion/article/3288026/apple-tesla-and-starbucks-face-testing-time-china-under-second-trump-administration","image":"https://cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2024/11/25/35f87d1f-1751-4310-98ca-28aae2fe0374_46eec4bc.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-11-26 00:56:06","author":"Zhou Xin","authors":["Zhou Xin"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"hk","sentiment":-0.013},{"id":267415536,"title":"Feds move to drop Trump prosecutions","text":"WASHINGTON — Special counsel Jack Smith moved to abandon two criminal cases against Donald Trump on Monday, acknowledging that Trump’s return to the White House will preclude attempts to federally prosecute him for retaining classified documents or trying to overturn his 2020 election defeat.\n\nThe decision was inevitable, since longstanding Justice Department policy says sitting presidents cannot face criminal prosecution. Yet it was still a momentous finale to an unprecedented chapter in political and law enforcement history, as federal officials attempted to hold accountable a former president while he was simultaneously running for another term.\n\nTrump emerges indisputably victorious, having successfully delayed the investigations through legal maneuvers and then winning reelection despite indictments that described his actions as a threat to the country’s constitutional foundations.\n\n“I persevered, against all odds, and WON,” Trump exulted in a post on Truth Social, his social media website.\n\nHe also said that “these cases, like all of the other cases I have been forced to go through, are empty and lawless, and should never have been brought.”\n\nThe judge in the election case granted prosecutors’ dismissal request. A decision in the documents case was still pending on Monday evening.\n\nThe outcome makes it clear that, when it comes to a president and criminal accusations, nothing supersedes the voters’ own verdict. In court filings, Smith’s team emphasized that the move to end their prosecutions was not a reflection of the merit of the cases but a recognition of the legal shield that surrounds any commander in chief.\n\n“That prohibition is categorical and does not turn on the gravity of the crimes charged, the strength of the Government’s proof, or the merits of the prosecution, which the Government stands fully behind,” prosecutors said in one of their filings.\n\nThey wrote that Trump’s return to the White House “sets at odds two fundamental and compelling national interests: on the one hand, the Constitution’s requirement that the President must not be unduly encumbered in fulfilling his weighty responsibilities . . . and on the other hand, the Nation’s commitment to the rule of law.”\n\nIn this situation, “the Constitution requires that this case be dismissed before the defendant is inaugurated,” they concluded.\n\nSmith’s team said it was leaving intact charges against two co-defendants in the classified documents case — Trump valet Walt Nauta and Mar-a-Lago property manager Carlos De Oliveira — because “no principle of temporary immunity applies to them.”\n\nSteven Cheung, Trump’s incoming White House communications director, said Americans “want an immediate end to the political weaponization of our justice system and we look forward to uniting our country.”\n\nTrump has long described the investigations as politically motivated, and he has vowed to fire Smith as soon as he takes office in January. Now he will start his second term free from criminal scrutiny by the government that he will lead.\n\nThe election case brought last year was once seen as one of the most serious legal threats facing Trump as he tried to reclaim the White House. He was indicted for plotting to overturn his defeat to Joe Biden in 2020, an effort that climaxed with his supporters’ violent attack on the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021.\n\nBut the case quickly stalled amid legal fighting over Trump’s sweeping claims of immunity from prosecution for acts he took while in the White House.\n\nThe U.S. Supreme Court in July ruled for the first time that former presidents have broad immunity from prosecution, and sent the case back to U.S. District Judge Tanya Chutkan to determine which allegations in the indictment, if any, could proceed to trial.\n\nThe case was just beginning to pick up steam again in the trial court in the weeks leading up to this year’s election. Smith’s team in October filed a lengthy brief laying out new evidence it planned to use against him at trial, accusing him of “resorting to crimes” in an increasingly desperate effort to overturn the will of voters after he lost to Biden.\n\nIn dismissing the case, Chutkan acknowledged prosecutors’ request to do so “without prejudice,” raising the possibility that they could try to bring charges against Trump when his term is over. She wrote that is “consistent with the Government’s understanding that the immunity afforded to a sitting President is temporary, expiring when they leave office.”\n\nBut such a move may be barred by the statute of limitations, and Trump may also try to pardon himself while in office.\n\nThe separate case involving classified documents had been widely seen as legally clear cut, especially because the conduct in question occurred after Trump left the White House and lost the powers of the presidency.\n\nThe indictment included dozens of felony counts accusing him of illegally hoarding classified records from his presidency at his Mar-a-Lago estate in Palm Beach, Florida, and obstructing federal efforts to get them back. He has pleaded not guilty and denied wrongdoing.","summary":"\"I persevered, against all odds, and WON,\" Trump exulted in a post on Truth Social, his social media website.","url":"https://www.bostonherald.com/2024/11/25/feds-move-to-drop-trump-prosecutions/","image":"https://www.bostonherald.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/AP24320070705670-1.jpg?w=1024&h=684","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-11-26 00:54:54","author":"Associated Press","authors":["Associated Press"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.269},{"id":267407604,"title":"Fiscal Especial Pide Se Desestime El Caso Contra Trump Por Intentar Revertir Resultados De Elecciones","text":"El fiscal especial Jack Smith solicitó el lunes a un juez federal que desestime el caso en el que se acusa al actual presidente electo y convicto Donald Trump de elaborar un plan para anular los resultados de las elecciones de 2020, debido a las normas del Departamento de Justicia según las cuales no se puede procesar penalmente a un mandatario en funciones.\n\nLa medida anunciada en documentos judiciales marca el fin de los históricos intentos del Departamento de Justicia por procesar a Trump –declarado culpable en mayo de falsificar los registros de su empresa para disfrazar la verdadera naturaleza de una serie de pagos que proporcionaron 130,000 dólares a la actriz porno Stormy Daniels– quien por lo que la fiscalía aseguró que fue una conspiración criminal para aferrarse al poder antes del asalto al Capitolio que perpetraron sus simpatizantes el 6 de enero de 2021.\n\nLos fiscales del Departamento de Justicia, haciendo mención de las añejas políticas de la agencia que establecen que no se puede procesar a un mandatario en funciones, declararon que la postura del departamento es que “la Constitución requiere que este caso sea desestimado antes de que el acusado sea investido”.\n\n“Dicha restricción es categórica y no depende de la gravedad de los delitos, la solidez del caso del gobierno o los méritos para ser procesado, mismos que el gobierno defiende por completo”, escribieron los fiscales en los documentos que fueron presentados ante el tribunal el lunes.\n\nEl juez del caso electoral concedió la petición de sobreseimiento de los fiscales. El lunes por la tarde todavía estaba pendiente una decisión sobre el caso de los documentos.\n\nLa decisión era de esperarse después de que el equipo de Smith comenzó a evaluar la manera de poner fin tanto el caso de interferencia electoral de 2020 como a otra causa sobre retención de documentos confidenciales después de que Trump ganó las elecciones ante la vicepresidenta Kamala Harris.\n\nTrump ha dicho que ambos casos fueron presentados por motivaciones políticas y había prometido despedir a Smith tan pronto como asumiera el cargo en enero.\n\nEl caso de las elecciones de 2020, presentado el año pasado, fue visto en su momento como una de las amenazas legales más serias que enfrentaba el republicano mientras competía por recuperar la Casa Blanca. Pero no tardó en estancarse en medio de las disputas legales sobre las afirmaciones de Trump de que gozaba de inmunidad a ser procesado por las acciones que tomó mientras estaba en la Casa Blanca.\n\nLa Corte Suprema dictaminó por primera vez en julio pasado que los expresidentes gozan de una amplia inmunidad a ser procesados, y envió el caso de regreso a la jueza federal Tanya Chutkan para determinar cuáles de las acusaciones, de ser el caso, podrían proceder a juicio.\n\nEl caso apenas comenzaba a cobrar impulso nuevamente en el tribunal a falta de unas semanas para las elecciones de este año. El equipo de Smith presentó un extenso informe en octubre en el cual se detallaron nuevas evidencias que planeaban usar contra Trump durante el juicio, acusándolo de “recurrir a delitos” como parte de un intento cada vez más desesperado por revertir la voluntad de los votantes después de su derrota electoral ante el presidente Joe Biden.","url":"https://puertoricotribune.com/fiscal-especial-pide-se-desestime-el-caso-contra-trump-por-intentar-revertir-resultados-de-elecciones/","image":"https://puertoricotribune.com/app/uploads/2024/11/C7B5E323M5CNXMGKORVOPT7XB4-sr04HR.jpeg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-11-26 00:54:34","author":null,"language":"en","source_country":"pr","sentiment":1},{"id":267407606,"title":"Cancelan Evento De Comediante Que Insulto A Puerto Rico","text":"El comediante Tony Hinchcliffe quien realizó comentarios despectivos contra Puerto Rico en un evento de campaña del expresidente de los Estados Unidos, Donald Trump, estaba pautado para participar un evento que se llevaría a cabo en un local de la calle Loíza en San Juan este próximo fin de semana.\n\nSin embargo, el evento fue cancelado luego de lo que describió como un “chiste” en el cual llamó “isla de basura” a Puerto Rico.\n\nSegún publicó el local Gala en la Calle Loíza, lugar donde ser llevaría a cabo el evento, el mismo fue cancelado luego de los comentarios realizados por el comediante.\n\n“Anunciamos la cancelación del evento Techmyschool donde se presentaba el comediante Tony Hinchcliffe debido a comentarios irrespetuosos hacia Puerto Rico.

Lo que ha dicho no es cómico, de la misma manera que fueron rechazadas por el público asistente, se merece el enérgico repudio de todos! No se le pueden dar espacios a expresiones tan infames y racistas como esas. Las mismas no representan los valores del GOP”, expresó González Colón.\n\nMientras que el presidente del Partido Republicano en Puerto Rico, Ángel Cintrón, expresó su opinión en descontento con los insultos que realizó el comediante Tony Hinchcliffe hacia Puerto Rico durante un mitin del expresidente y candidato a la reelección por el Partido Republicano, Donald Trump en el Madison Square Garden en Nueva York.\n\n“Las expresiones del comediante @tonyjinchcliffe son desgraciadas, ignorantes y totalmente repudiables. Un pobre intento de comedia que, al igual que fue contundentemente rechazadas por el público asistente a ese evento, merecen el repudio de todos. No hay espacio para comentarios absurdos y racistas como ese”, comentó Cintrón.\n\n“No representan los valores conservadores del republicanismo en ningún lugar de nuestra Nación, que tiene 3 millones de ciudadanos americanos en nuestra Isla y casi 6 millones viviendo en todos los Estados de la Unión. Seamos republicanos o demócratas, somos Ciudadanos Americanos y Boricuas orgullosos de nuestras raíces y aportaciones incalculables a la democracia americana por más de cien años”, concluyó el licenciado Cintrón, presidente del Partido Republicano en Puerto Rico”, añadió el presidente del comité.\n\nEstas declaraciones se produjeron, tras el comentario realizado por el comediante y que lee en inglés:\n\n“There’s a lot going on. I don’t know if you know this but there’s literally a floating island of garbage in the middle of the ocean right now. I think it’s called Puerto Rico”.\n\nLa reacción del público tras los comentarios del comediante fue mixta, por lo que el comediante continuó diciendo: “Ok, llegaremos ahí, miren normalmente no sigo el himno nacional”.\n\nEl Madison Square Garden estaba atestado, con casi 20 mil seguidores de Trump. Allí, el comediante también hizo chistes de insulto sobre los latinos. “A estos latinos les encanta hacer bebés, no hay forma de sacarlos, se corren adentro, tal como lo hacen en nuestro país:, dijo en otro momento.\n\nPedro Pierluisi también repudia las expresiones\n\nEl gobernador de Puerto Rico, Pedro Pierluisi, también se expresó sobre los comentarios realizados por el comediante y manifestó que los mismos son parte del racismo que aún se vive en los Estados Unidos. Al mismo tiempo aprovechó para pedir un voto por los candidatos del Partido Demócrata.\n\n“Basura es lo que salió de la boca de Tony Hinchcliffe, y todos los que lo aplaudieron deberían sentirse avergonzados por faltarle el respeto a Puerto Rico. Comentarios como esos dejan al descubierto los prejuicios y el racismo que lamentablemente aún existen en nuestra Nación, y nos recuerdan la importancia de escoger líderes que rechacen y luchen contra ese tipo deintolerancia. La nación Americana es mejor que esto y su gente merece más. Los puertorriqueños y el resto de los ciudadanos americanos merecemos líderes que nos traten con respeto.

De no hacerlo, se convertirán en cómplices. Ahora más que nunca necesitamos un comisionado residente que no titubee en decirles que este pueblo se respeta.

The Kuala Lumpur Composite Index now sits just beneath the 1,600-point plateau and it may add to its winnings again on Tuesday.\nThe global forecast for the Asian markets is upbeat on optimism over the global outlook, although weak oil prices limited the upside. The European and U.S. markets were up and the Asian bourses figure to follow that lead.\nThe KLCI finished modestly higher on Monday following gains from the financial shares and mixed performances from the plantations, industrials and telecoms.\nFor the day, the index added 7.67 points or 0.48 percent to finish at 1,597.45 after trading between 1,588.46 and 1,609.29.\nAmong the actives, Axiata rose 0.43 percent, while Celcomdigi lost 0.28 percent, CIMB Group spiked 1.95 percent, Genting climbed 1.32 percent, Genting Malaysia declined 1.41 percent, IHH Healthcare plunged 2.64 percent, IOI Corporation dropped 0.52 percent, Kuala Lumpur Kepong perked 0.28 percent, Maxis strengthened 1.42 percent, Maybank collected 0.98 percent, MISC fell 0.13 percent, MRDIY and Hong Leong Financial both gained 0.54 percent, Nestle Malaysia tanked 2.56 percent, Petronas Chemicals tumbled 2.44 percent, Petronas Dagangan retreated 1.69 percent, PPB Group plummeted 4.55 percent, Press Metal sank 0.43 percent, Public Bank jumped 1.60 percent, QL Resources skidded 1.03 percent, RHB Bank rallied 1.69 percent, Sime Darby slumped1.32 percent, SD Guthrie stumbled 1.85 percent, Sunway advanced 0.60 percent, Telekom Malaysia shed 0.31 percent, Tenaga Nasional gathered 0.29 percent, YTL Corporation soared 4.52 percent and YTL Power surged 5.52 percent.\nThe lead from Wall Street is positive as the major averages opened higher on Monday and remained in the green throughout the trading day.\n\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\nThe Dow rallied 440.0.6 points or 0.99 percent to finish at 44,736.57, while the NASDAQ added 51.19 points or 0.48 percent to close at 20,220.36 and the S&P 500 rose 18.03 points or 0.30 percent to end at 5,987.37.\nStocks added to the strong gains posted last week amid a positive reaction to news President-elect Donald Trump intends to nominate billionaire hedge fund manager Scott Bessent as Treasury Secretary.\nBessent is seen as supportive of the equity markets and an advocate for deficit reduction. He has also called for Trump's planned tariff increases to be implemented gradually, which could reduce the impact on inflation.\nHowever, buying interest waned as the day progressed, as traders seemed reluctant to make more significant moves ahead of the release of several key economic reports in the coming days.\nOil prices fell sharply on Monday, weighed down by reports that Israel and Hezbollah are likely to reach a cease-fire agreement within the next few days. West Texas Intermediate Crude oil futures for January ended down $2.30 or 3.2 percent at $68.94 a barrel. \nFor comments and feedback contact: editorial@rttnews.com\r\n\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nSlide Shows\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\nBiotech Stocks Facing FDA Decision In August 2024\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\nBiotech Stocks Facing FDA Decision In June 2024\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\nBiotech Stocks Facing FDA Decision In April 2024\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\n Previous Story\r\n\nNext Story \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nGlobal Economics Weekly Update - November 18- 22, 2024\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\nNovember 22, 2024 09:20 ET \nJobless claims and survey data on manufacturing in the U.S. were among the main releases in a light week for economics news flow.Claims for jobless benefits partly reflect the state of the U.S. labor market.

With the upward move, the Dow and the S&P 500 have reached new record intraday highs.\nCurrently, the major averages are off their highs of the session but still in positive territory. The Dow is up 404.73 points or 0.9 percent at 44,701.25, the Nasdaq is up 86.12 points or 0.5 percent at 19,089.77 and the S&P 500 is up 22.56 points or 0.4 percent at 5,991.90.\nThe continued strength on Wall Street comes amid a positive reaction to news President-elect Donald Trump intends to nominate billionaire hedge fund manager Scott Bessent as Treasury Secretary.\nBessent is seen as supportive of the equity markets and an advocate for deficit reduction. He has also called for Trump's planned tariff increases to be implemented gradually, which could reduce the impact on inflation.\n\"Hedge fund manager Scott Bessent is perceived as being a relatively conventional and safe pair of hands candidate,\" said AJ Bell investment director Russ Mould. \"Importantly, Bessent is seen as being less aggressive on tariffs than some of the rhetoric espoused by Trump on the campaign trail.\"\nHe added, \"A fall in bond yields in response to his unveiling suggests some of the concern about a new wave of inflationary pressures from import tariffs has eased and that Bessent might be able to do something to bring the U.S. deficit under control.\"\nHowever, traders seem reluctant to make more significant moves ahead of the release of several key economic reports in the coming days.\nA report on personal income and spending the month of October is likely to be in the spotlight, as it includes the Federal Reserve's preferred inflation readings.\nReports on consumer confidence, new home sales and durable goods orders are also likely to attract attention along with the minutes of the Fed's latest monetary policy meeting.\nSector News\n\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\nHousing stocks have moved sharply higher amid a steep drop by treasury yields, resulting in a 4.9 percent spike by the Philadelphia Housing Sector Index.\nSubstantial strength is also visible among computer hardware stocks, with the NYSE Arca Computer Hardware Index soaring by 4.2 percent to a four-month intraday high.\nAirline stocks have also shown a significant move to the upside, driving the NYSE Arca Airline Index up by 3.1 percent. \nBiotechnology, commercial real estate and networking stocks are also seeing notable strength, while gold stocks have plunged along with the price of the precious metal.\nOther Markets\nIn overseas trading, stock markets across the Asia-Pacific region turned in a mixed performance during trading on Monday. Japan's Nikkei 225 Index jumped by 1.3 percent, while China's Shanghai Composite Index edged down by 0.1 percent and Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index fell by 0.4 percent.\nMeanwhile, the major European markets have all moved to the upside on the day. While the U.K.'s FTSE 100 Index is up by 0.5 percent, the German DAX Index is up by 0.4 percent and the French CAC 40 Index is up by 0.1 percent.\nIn the bond market, treasuries have moved sharply higher in reaction to Trump's Treasury Secretary pick. As a result, the yield on the benchmark ten-year note, which moves opposite of its price, is down by 12.1 basis points at 4.289 percent. \nFor comments and feedback contact: editorial@rttnews.com\nBusiness News\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nSlide Shows\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\nBiotech Stocks Facing FDA Decision In August 2024\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\nBiotech Stocks Facing FDA Decision In June 2024\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\nBiotech Stocks Facing FDA Decision In April 2024\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\n Previous Story\r\n\nNext Story \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nGlobal Economics Weekly Update - November 18- 22, 2024\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\nNovember 22, 2024 09:20 ET \nJobless claims and survey data on manufacturing in the U.S. were among the main releases in a light week for economics news flow.Claims for jobless benefits partly reflect the state of the U.S. labor market.

His view that Trump's proposed tariff increases should be implemented gradually is expected to reduce the impact of inflation. \n\"Bessent is seen as being less aggressive on tariffs than some of the rhetoric espoused by Trump on the campaign trail,\" according to AJ Bell Investment director Russ Mould.\nTraders also looked ahead to the upcoming OPEC+ meeting scheduled to take place on December 1. It is very likely that the group will consider keeping production cuts in place from January 1. \nFor comments and feedback contact: editorial@rttnews.com\nMarket Analysis\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nSlide Shows\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\nBiotech Stocks Facing FDA Decision In August 2024\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\nBiotech Stocks Facing FDA Decision In June 2024\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\nBiotech Stocks Facing FDA Decision In April 2024\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\nNext Story \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nGlobal Economics Weekly Update - November 18- 22, 2024\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\nNovember 22, 2024 09:20 ET \nJobless claims and survey data on manufacturing in the U.S. were among the main releases in a light week for economics news flow.Claims for jobless benefits partly reflect the state of the U.S. labor market.

The Taiwan Stock Exchange now rests just beneath the 22,950-point plateau and it may see additional support on Tuesday.\nThe global forecast for the Asian markets is upbeat on optimism over the global outlook, although weak oil prices limited the upside. The European and U.S. markets were up and the Asian bourses figure to follow that lead.\nThe TSE finished slightly higher on Monday following gins from the financial shares and technology stocks.\nFor the day, the index added 44.05 points or 0.19 percent to finish at the daily low of 22,948.37 after trading as high as 23,172.43.\nAmong the actives, Cathay Financial collected 0.75 percent, while Mega Financial and United Microelectronics Corporation both climbed 1.01 percent, First Financial improved 0.72 percent, Fubon Financial strengthened 1.34 percent, E Sun Financial rallied 1.28 percent, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company dropped 0.96 percent, Hon Hai Precision soared 3.69 percent, Largan Precision spiked 2.94 percent, Catcher Technology added 0.50 percent, MediaTek stumbled 2.29 percent, Delta Electronics dipped 0.13 percent, Novatek Microelectronics accelerated 2.29 percent, Nan Ya Plastics advanced 0.87 percent and Asia Cement, CTBC Financial and Formosa Plastics were unchanged.\nThe lead from Wall Street is positive as the major averages opened higher on Monday and remained in the green throughout the trading day.\n\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\nThe Dow rallied 440.0.6 points or 0.99 percent to finish at 44,736.57, while the NASDAQ added 51.19 points or 0.48 percent to close at 20,220.36 and the S&P 500 rose 18.03 points or 0.30 percent to end at 5,987.37.\nStocks added to the strong gains posted last week amid a positive reaction to news President-elect Donald Trump intends to nominate billionaire hedge fund manager Scott Bessent as Treasury Secretary.\nBessent is seen as supportive of the equity markets and an advocate for deficit reduction. He has also called for Trump's planned tariff increases to be implemented gradually, which could reduce the impact on inflation.\nHowever, buying interest waned as the day progressed, as traders seemed reluctant to make more significant moves ahead of the release of several key economic reports in the coming days.\nOil prices fell sharply on Monday, weighed down by reports that Israel and Hezbollah are likely to reach a cease-fire agreement within the next few days.

The Taiwan Stock Exchange now rests just beneath the 22,950-point plateau and it may see additional support on Tuesday.\nThe global forecast for the Asian markets is upbeat on optimism over the global outlook, although weak oil prices limited the upside. The European and U.S. markets were up and the Asian bourses figure to follow that lead.\nThe TSE finished slightly higher on Monday following gins from the financial shares and technology stocks.\nFor the day, the index added 44.05 points or 0.19 percent to finish at the daily low of 22,948.37 after trading as high as 23,172.43.\nAmong the actives, Cathay Financial collected 0.75 percent, while Mega Financial and United Microelectronics Corporation both climbed 1.01 percent, First Financial improved 0.72 percent, Fubon Financial strengthened 1.34 percent, E Sun Financial rallied 1.28 percent, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company dropped 0.96 percent, Hon Hai Precision soared 3.69 percent, Largan Precision spiked 2.94 percent, Catcher Technology added 0.50 percent, MediaTek stumbled 2.29 percent, Delta Electronics dipped 0.13 percent, Novatek Microelectronics accelerated 2.29 percent, Nan Ya Plastics advanced 0.87 percent and Asia Cement, CTBC Financial and Formosa Plastics were unchanged.\nThe lead from Wall Street is positive as the major averages opened higher on Monday and remained in the green throughout the trading day.\n\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\nThe Dow rallied 440.0.6 points or 0.99 percent to finish at 44,736.57, while the NASDAQ added 51.19 points or 0.48 percent to close at 20,220.36 and the S&P 500 rose 18.03 points or 0.30 percent to end at 5,987.37.\nStocks added to the strong gains posted last week amid a positive reaction to news President-elect Donald Trump intends to nominate billionaire hedge fund manager Scott Bessent as Treasury Secretary.\nBessent is seen as supportive of the equity markets and an advocate for deficit reduction. He has also called for Trump's planned tariff increases to be implemented gradually, which could reduce the impact on inflation.\nHowever, buying interest waned as the day progressed, as traders seemed reluctant to make more significant moves ahead of the release of several key economic reports in the coming days.\nOil prices fell sharply on Monday, weighed down by reports that Israel and Hezbollah are likely to reach a cease-fire agreement within the next few days. West Texas Intermediate Crude oil futures for January ended down $2.30 or 3.2 percent at $68.94 a barrel. \nFor comments and feedback contact: editorial@rttnews.com\r\n\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nSlide Shows\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\nBiotech Stocks Facing FDA Decision In August 2024\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\nBiotech Stocks Facing FDA Decision In June 2024\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\nBiotech Stocks Facing FDA Decision In April 2024\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nGlobal Economics Weekly Update - November 18- 22, 2024\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\nNovember 22, 2024 09:20 ET \nJobless claims and survey data on manufacturing in the U.S. were among the main releases in a light week for economics news flow.Claims for jobless benefits partly reflect the state of the U.S. labor market.

Subsequently, the yield on the benchmark ten-year note, which moves opposite of its price, plunged 14.5 basis points to 4.265 percent.\nThe rally by treasuries came following news President-elect Donald Trump intends to nominate billionaire hedge fund manager Scott Bessent as Treasury Secretary.\nBessent is an advocate for deficit reduction and has also called for Trump's planned tariff increases to be implemented gradually, which could reduce the impact on inflation.\n\"Hedge fund manager Scott Bessent is perceived as being a relatively conventional and safe pair of hands candidate,\" said AJ Bell investment director Russ Mould. \"Importantly, Bessent is seen as being less aggressive on tariffs than some of the rhetoric espoused by Trump on the campaign trail.\"\nHe added, \"A fall in bond yields in response to his unveiling suggests some of the concern about a new wave of inflationary pressures from import tariffs has eased and that Bessent might be able to do something to bring the U.S. deficit under control.\"\n\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\nTreasuries saw further upside after the Treasury Department revealed this month's auction of $69 billion worth of two-year notes attracted above average demand.\nThe two-year note auction drew a high yield of 4.274 percent and a bid-to-cover ratio of 2.77, while the ten previous two-year note auctions drew a high yield of 2.61.\nThe bid-to-cover ratio is a measure of demand that indicates the amount of bids for each dollar worth of securities being sold.\nTrading on Tuesday may be impacted by reaction to reports on new home sales and consumer confidence as well as the minutes of the latest Federal Reserve meeting. \nFor comments and feedback contact: editorial@rttnews.com\nMarket Analysis\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nSlide Shows\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\nBiotech Stocks Facing FDA Decision In August 2024\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\nBiotech Stocks Facing FDA Decision In June 2024\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\nBiotech Stocks Facing FDA Decision In April 2024\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\nNext Story \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nGlobal Economics Weekly Update - November 18- 22, 2024\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\nNovember 22, 2024 09:20 ET \nJobless claims and survey data on manufacturing in the U.S. were among the main releases in a light week for economics news flow.Claims for jobless benefits partly reflect the state of the U.S. labor market.

The KOSPI now sits just above the 2,530-point plateau and it's expected to open in the green again on Tuesday.\nThe global forecast for the Asian markets is upbeat on optimism over the global outlook, although weak oil prices limited the upside. The European and U.S. markets were up and the Asian bourses figure to follow that lead.\nThe KOSPI finished sharply higher on Monday following gains from the financial shares, chemicals and technology companies, while the industrials were mixed.\nFor the day, the index jumped 33.10 points or 1.32 percent to finish at 2,534.34 after trading between 2,517.98 and 2,541.76. Volume was 535.26 million shares worth 12.54 trillion won. There were 612 gainers and 279 decliners.\nAmong the actives, Shinhan Financial collected 1.26 percent, while KB Financial shed 0.41 percent, Hana Financial gained 0.64 percent, Samsung Electronics rallied 3.39 percent, Samsung SDI soared 3.16 percent, LG Electronics advanced 0.96 percent, SK Hynix perked 0.17 percent, Naver strengthened 1.68 percent, LG Chem spiked 2.85 percent, Lotte Chemical jumped 1.96 percent, SK Innovation improved 0.78 percent, POSCO lost 0.66 percent, SK Telecom sank 0.70 percent, Hyundai Mobis stumbled 2.95 percent, Hyundai Motor accelerated 0.92 percent, Kia Motors dropped 0.61 percent and KEPCO was unchanged.\nThe lead from Wall Street is positive as the major averages opened higher on Monday and remained in the green throughout the trading day.\n\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\nThe Dow rallied 440.0.6 points or 0.99 percent to finish at 44,736.57, while the NASDAQ added 51.19 points or 0.48 percent to close at 20,220.36 and the S&P 500 rose 18.03 points or 0.30 percent to end at 5,987.37.\nStocks added to the strong gains posted last week amid a positive reaction to news President-elect Donald Trump intends to nominate billionaire hedge fund manager Scott Bessent as Treasury Secretary.\nBessent is seen as supportive of the equity markets and an advocate for deficit reduction. He has also called for Trump's planned tariff increases to be implemented gradually, which could reduce the impact on inflation.\nHowever, buying interest waned as the day progressed, as traders seemed reluctant to make more significant moves ahead of the release of several key economic reports in the coming days.\nOil prices fell sharply on Monday, weighed down by reports that Israel and Hezbollah are likely to reach a cease-fire agreement within the next few days.

The Straits Times Index now sits just above the 3,730-point plateau and it's expected to bounce higher again on Tuesday.\nThe global forecast for the Asian markets is upbeat on optimism over the global outlook, although weak oil prices limited the upside. The European and U.S. markets were up and the Asian bourses figure to follow that lead.\nThe STI finished modestly lower on Monday following mixed performances from the financial shares, property stocks and industrial issues.\nFor the day, the index slumped 14.63 points or 0.39 percent to finish at 3,731.39 after trading between 3,730.96 and 3,764.90.\nAmong the actives, CapitaLand Integrated Commercial Trust spiked 1.55 percent, while CapitaLand Investment rallied 1.08 percent, City Developments soared 2.33 percent, Comfort DelGro gained 0.68 percent, DBS Group fell 0.19 percent, Genting Singapore tumbled 1.29 percent, Hongkong Land lost 0.43 percent, Keppel DC REIT skyrocketed 7.21 percent, Keppel Ltd added 0.75 percent, Mapletree Pan Asia Commercial Trust improved 0.82 percent, Mapletree Industrial Trust advanced 0.88 percent, Mapletree Logistics Trust surged 3.20 percent, Oversea-Chinese Banking Corporation tanked 1.64 percent, SATS gathered 0.52 percent, Seatrium Limited jumped 1.05 percent, SembCorp Industries sank 0.38 percent, Singapore Technologies Engineering plunged 2,14 percent, SingTel slumped 0.65 percent, Thai Beverage and Frasers Centrepoint Trust both climbed 0.95 percent, Wilmar International rose 0.65 percent, Yangzijiang Financial jumped 1.25 percent, Yangzijiang Shipbuilding plummeted 2.23 percent and Emperador and Frasers Logistics & Commercial Trust were unchanged.\nThe lead from Wall Street is positive as the major averages opened higher on Monday and remained in the green throughout the trading day.\nThe Dow rallied 440.0.6 points or 0.99 percent to finish at 44,736.57, while the NASDAQ added 51.19 points or 0.48 percent to close at 20,220.36 and the S&P 500 rose 18.03 points or 0.30 percent to end at 5,987.37.\n\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\nStocks added to the strong gains posted last week amid a positive reaction to news President-elect Donald Trump intends to nominate billionaire hedge fund manager Scott Bessent as Treasury Secretary.\nBessent is seen as supportive of the equity markets and an advocate for deficit reduction. He has also called for Trump's planned tariff increases to be implemented gradually, which could reduce the impact on inflation.\nHowever, buying interest waned as the day progressed, as traders seemed reluctant to make more significant moves ahead of the release of several key economic reports in the coming days.\nOil prices fell sharply on Monday, weighed down by reports that Israel and Hezbollah are likely to reach a cease-fire agreement within the next few days. West Texas Intermediate Crude oil futures for January ended down $2.30 or 3.2 percent at $68.94 a barrel.\nCloser to home, Singapore will provide October figures for industrial production later today; in September, industrial output was flat on month and up 9.8 percent on year. \nFor comments and feedback contact: editorial@rttnews.com\r\n\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nSlide Shows\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\nBiotech Stocks Facing FDA Decision In August 2024\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\nBiotech Stocks Facing FDA Decision In June 2024\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\nBiotech Stocks Facing FDA Decision In April 2024\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\n Previous Story\r\n\nNext Story \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nGlobal Economics Weekly Update - November 18- 22, 2024\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\nNovember 22, 2024 09:20 ET \nJobless claims and survey data on manufacturing in the U.S. were among the main releases in a light week for economics news flow.Claims for jobless benefits partly reflect the state of the U.S. labor market.
