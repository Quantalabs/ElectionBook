{"offset":0,"number":50,"available":18947,"news":[{"id":380287468,"title":"Zelenskyy will visit Turkey in a new bid to jump-start talks to end Russias invasion","text":"KYIV, Ukraine — Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Tuesday that he will travel to Turkey this week in an attempt to jump-start negotiations on ending Russia’s full-scale invasion, which began nearly four years ago.The Kremlin said that Russia would not be sending anyone to Turkey, and it was not immediately clear if there would be U.S. participation in the talks. Zelenskyy told a news conference in Spain that he would meet with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan to discuss “a just peace for Ukraine.”Zelenskyy’s statement came as Ukraine’s military said it had again used American-supplied ATACMS missiles to attack targets inside Russia, although it did not provide further details. Kyiv says that the use of longer-range missiles is vital in preventing strikes against Ukrainian cities, while the Kremlin has warned that the use of American weapons to strike targets inside its territory risks greater pressure on Russian-U.S. relations.A senior Turkish official told The Associated Press that U.S. special envoy Steve Witkoff would join Zelenskyy in Turkey, but backtracked later in the day and said Witkoff wouldn’t be coming.Zelenskyy did not confirm whether U.S. representatives would also take part. “We see some positions and signals from the United States,” he said. \"Well, let’s see tomorrow.”Three U.S. officials said they were not aware of any imminent overseas travel by Witkoff, though they acknowledged he is not a government employee and sometimes travels without U.S. government support.The officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly about the matter, said Witkoff would be in Washington for much of this week to attend events related to a state visit by the Saudi crown prince on Tuesday and Wednesday.A top Turkish spokesman said the talks in Turkey will be held in Ankara and will center on how to establish a ceasefire and a lasting settlement. They also will touch on Ukraine-Turkey relations, Burhanettin Duran, Turkey’s head of presidential communications, said on the social platform X.Turkey provided a setting for low-level talks between Ukraine and Russia earlier this year, though the only significant progress in Istanbul was on exchanging prisoners of war. U.S.-led international peace efforts have brought no breakthrough, either.U.S. President Donald Trump has expressed frustration with Russian President Vladimir Putin’s refusal to budge from his demands for putting an end to the war.Heavy new American sanctions on Russia’s all-important oil industry, devised to push Putin to the negotiating table, are due to take effect on Friday. The sanctions against oil companies Rosneft and Lukoil seek to starve Putin’s war machine of cash and halt its grinding war of attrition, which has claimed tens of thousands of lives in Ukraine.Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Tuesday that “there will be no Russian representative in Turkey\" on Wednesday, although he insisted that Moscow is ready to negotiate.“For now, these contacts are taking place without Russian participation. We will await information on what would actually be discussed in Istanbul,” Peskov said during his daily conference call with reporters.Washington's sanctions also carry the threat of secondary penalties against anyone violating them, raising the stakes for Putin. China and India are major importers of Russian oil.In the meantime, Zelenskyy has been traveling to European capitals to gather support for Ukraine’s war effort, meeting Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez on Tuesday. Madrid said it would provide Ukraine with aid worth $946 million for defense and reconstruction.The Ukrainian leader was in Paris on Monday where he signed a letter of intent to buy up to 100 Rafale warplanes from France, along with drones and ground-to-air systems.On the battlefield, Ukraine launched a surprise aerial attack on energy infrastructure in occupied parts of its eastern Donetsk region.The Russian-appointed head of the partially occupied region, Denis Pushilin, on Tuesday morning reported an “unprecedented” Ukrainian attack that damaged two thermal power stations and left many areas without power. A day earlier, Pushilin also reported Ukrainian drones attacking energy infrastructure in the region, denying power to around 500,000 consumers. The occupied part of the region has also endured water shortages.The commander of Ukraine’s Unmanned Systems Forces, Maj. Robert Brovdi, published footage that he said showed strikes Tuesday on two thermal power plants located in the Russian-controlled parts of Donetsk.Ukrainian forces, despite being heavily outnumbered, are fighting hard to prevent Russia’s army from capturing any more of Donetsk.In Ukraine’s northeastern Kharkiv region, meanwhile, a 17-year-old girl was killed and 10 other people were wounded in a Russian missile strike on the town of Berestyn, located about 110 kilometers from the Russian border, regional head Oleh Syniehubov said.Russian drones sparked multiple fires in the central Ukrainian city of Dnipro last night, injuring two people, said Vladyslav Haivanenko, the head of the regional military administration. The drones damaged six residential buildings, as well as the local offices of Ukraine’s public broadcaster Suspilne, though the company said the building was empty at the time.At home, Zelenskyy remains under political pressure over a $100 million embezzlement and kickback scandal involving top officials and Ukraine’s state nuclear power company. The scandal broke last week and brought the resignations of two members of Zelenskyy's Cabinet.Petro Poroshenko, a former Ukrainian president and the leader of the European Solidarity opposition party, demanded the dismissal of the entire Ukrainian government on Tuesday.A dozen lawmakers from his party stood alongside him in the Verkhovna Rada, Ukraine’s Parliament, holding up placards protesting corruption. Poroshenko and his supporters blocked any other speakers from going up, halting the parliamentary session.Zelenskyy has pledged to weed out entrenched corruption, but has been dogged by graft scandals that have caused public outrage.Zelenskyy said that he would meet with senior officials in his government on Thursday, as well as with the leadership of Ukraine’s Parliament and his political party, called Servant of the People.Associated Press writers Suzan Fraser in Ankara, Turkey, Suman Naishadham in Madrid and Matthew Lee in Washington contributed to this report.Follow ’s coverage of the war in Ukraine at /hub/russia-ukraineThis article was generated from an automated news agency feed without modifications to text.","url":"https://www.livemint.com/news/world/zelenskyy-will-visit-turkey-in-a-new-bid-to-jump-start-talks-to-end-russias-invasion-11763493121202.html","image":"https://www.livemint.com/lm-img/img/2024/12/06/1600x900/logo/news_3_1733464427658_1733464446564.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-11-19 19:12:00","author":"List.metadata.agency","authors":["List.metadata.agency"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"in","sentiment":-0.224},{"id":380265642,"title":"Trump vs ABC: US President says network’s licenses be ‘taken away’ after Epstein scandal question","text":"US President Donald Trump on Tuesday (November 18) threatened that broadcasting licenses used by affiliates of Walt Disney-owned ABC should be “taken away” after he clashed with a reporter from the network during an Oval Office event with Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman.The confrontation occurred when an ABC News reporter asked Trump about the political fallout surrounding the Jeffrey Epstein scandal. The question appeared to irritate the President, who dismissed it as inappropriate for the moment and sharply rebuked the network.“Licenses be taken away”Following the exchange, Trump told reporters that ABC and its affiliates should face consequences for what he described as unfair and hostile coverage. “They should have their licenses taken away,” Trump said, claiming the network had crossed a line with its questioning.The President did not specify what legal grounds he believed would permit the government to revoke broadcast licenses — a process that is controlled by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) and requires evidence of serious violations, not disagreement with editorial content.Tense moment during meeting with MBSThe remarks came during a high-profile White House event with Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, who is on his first visit to Washington since the 2018 killing of journalist Jamal Khashoggi.

Authority over these decisions belongs to state and local governments, which provide more than 85% of public school funding.The department's Republican critics have portrayed the department as a symbol of bureaucratic waste, underlining the need for smaller federal government in favor of greater state power.Add as a Reliable and Trusted News Source Add Now!\n (You can now subscribe to our Economic Times WhatsApp channel)\n\nRead More News onDepartment of EducationTrump administrationdismantle federal educationeducation policystate control over education\n\n(Catch all the Business News, Breaking News and Latest News Updates on The Economic Times.)

Greg Abbott has quickly appealed to the Supreme Court a ruling that the redistricting passed by lawmakers at the urging of President Trump violates the voting rights of minority communities.\n\n\"Any claim that these maps are discriminatory is absurd and unsupported by the testimony offered during ten days of hearings,\" Abbott, a Republican, said in a statement. \"This ruling is clearly erroneous and undermines the authority the U.S. Constitution assigns to the Texas Legislature by imposing a different map by judicial edict.\"\n\nA three-judge panel had earlier Tuesday placed a temporary block on the map that Republican lawmakers passed this summer and ordered the state to use the district maps from the last two elections.\n\nThe map that was overruled had been drawn to give Republicans an advantage in flipping as many as five House seats held by Democrats. Judges determined it intentionally targeted Black and Latino voters in a way that would dilute their voting power, violating the federal Voting Rights Act.\n\n\"To be sure, politics played a role in drawing the 2025 Map. But it was much more than just politics. Substantial evidence shows that Texas racially gerrymandered the 2025 Map,\" wrote the majority from a three-judge panel.\n\nThe panel heard a trial on the case in October.\n\nThe ruling is a blow to Trump and the Republicans in a nationwide redistricting race that began in Texas this summer.\n\nTexas Attorney General Ken Paxton, who has announced his candidacy for the U.S. Senate, also said he would appeal the ruling on the \"Big Beautiful Map\" which he called \"entirely legal\" in a statement.\n\nDemocrats praised the court ruling. \"Race was always a driving factor and a driving factor to make it harder for minority Texans,\" said Texas Congresswoman Lizzie Fletcher in an interview. \"This map was drawn to make it harder for them to have an impact in elections.\"\n\nThe court's decision, in a 2-1 ruling, comes at a pivotal moment. Around the country, Trump is pressing Republican state lawmakers to reshape congressional voting maps to hold the party's slim majority in the House and support his agenda.\n\nUsing their heavy Republican majority in the legislature, Texas lawmakers passed a map in August designed to help their party grow its ranks in the 2026 elections for the U.S. House.\n\nThe process gained national attention when Democrats in the legislature fled the state for over two weeks to delay a vote and Republican leaders threatened to arrest them. Democrats argued the new map weakened the voting power of Latino and Black communities.\n\nThe redistricting in Texas also prompted California Democrats to act. This month California voters passed an initiative allowing redistricting that could help Democrats win five seats in that state.\n\nWas it partisan gerrymandering or racial gerrymandering? \n\nRepublicans in the Texas Legislature passed the map saying it was designed to improve their party's chances of winning five congressional seats. They noted that, unlike in some states, the law in Texas does not prohibit redistricting for partisan advantage and that the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in 2019 that federal courts could not intervene when it's done.\n\nBut partisan gerrymandering can often overlap with racial gerrymandering, which is illegal. Opponents of the map argued in court that it intentionally diminished the voting power of minority communities. That's what the court found here.\n\nThe 160-page opinion was written by District Judge Jeffrey V. Brown, who was appointed by Trump during his first term as president. His ruling drew upon statements and contradictions in what Republican lawmakers said as the maps were passed.\n\nA letter the Department of Justice wrote to encourage the redistricting, ended up being grounds the court used to block the effort.\n\nThe judges noted that when Gov. Abbott originally called lawmakers into session to draw the map, he cited a letter from justice department officials criticizing districts that had majority non-white voting populations as \"racial gerrymanders.\" In other words, the letter implied the districts as they stood gave non-white voters an advantage and that had to be reversed.\n\nEventually, Texas Republicans said the map was not intended to correct for a racial tilt but for partisan gain.\n\nThat letter put lawmakers, who for years had denied their use of race when making maps, in \"a difficult spot\" according to University of Texas at Austin political scientist Josh Blank, because they were \"ultimately saying opposite things.\"\n\nBrown's ruling criticized the construction of the letter itself, which was sent by Harmeet Dhillon, head of the Justice Department's civil rights division. \"It's challenging to unpack the DOJ Letter because it contains so many factual, legal, and typographical errors,\" Brown wrote.\n\n\"This decision is a rebuke of Donald Trump and to some degree a rebuke of lawmakers in Texas,\" said Brandon Rottinghaus, a political scientist with the University of Houston. \"They think the process was flawed and the Department of Justice was not credible in their legal arguments.\"\n\nRep. Gene Wu, Democratic leader in the Texas House, said Tuesday's ruling shows the courts still hold true to American principles.\n\n\"The striking down of the maps is fundamentally a sign that the courts still believe in the core principles of this country: That one man, one vote idea is something that is absolute and must be kept up,\" Wu said.\n\nAround the country, Republicans have more options for redistricting seats their way than Democrats do, in part because the GOP controls more state legislatures. Usually, states redistrict at the start of the decade after the national census.\n\nAt the behest of Trump, lawmakers in Missouri and North Carolina passed new maps that could help the GOP win a seat in each state. Ohio drew a map that analysts say gives Republicans a slight advantage in a few seats.\n\nFor Democrats, in addition to the five seats that could be gained in California, a court-ordered redistricting in Utah could help Democrats win a seat there. And Virginia Democrats have started a process that could yield two seats in that state.\n\nBlaise Gainey covers state politics for The Texas Newsroom.

And it’s painful and it’s a huge mistake,” he said.\n\nTrump, who chided the reporter who asked the Khashoggi question “to embarrass our guest”, also praised the crown prince for doing an “incredible” job on human rights but did not elaborate.\n\nTrump’s treatment of bin Salman prompted a rebuke from Khashoggi’s widow.\n\n“There is no justification to murder my husband. While Jamal was a good transparent and brave man, many people may not have agreed with his opinions and desire for freedom of the press,” Hanan Elatr Khashoggi wrote on X, urging bin Salman to meet her.\n\nBin Salman has been strongly criticised by human rights groups not only for the Khashoggi killing but for his crackdown on dissent at home. But the crown prince has also unleashed major social reforms that have swept away some austere social codes.\n\nAt the start of his visit, with which bin Salman sought to further rehabilitate his global image tarnished by the Kashoggi killing, the crown prince was greeted with a lavish display of pomp and ceremony presided over by Trump on the South Lawn. It came with a military honour guard, a cannon salute and a flyover by US warplanes.\n\nThe meeting underscored a key relationship – between the world’s biggest economy and the top oil exporter – that Trump has made a high priority in his second term as the international uproar around the killing of Khashoggi, a Saudi insider-turned-critic, has gradually faded.\n\nThe warm welcome for bin Salman in Washington marks a high point for the US-Saudi ties, which had suffered because of Khashoggi’s murder.\n\nSitting next to Trump, bin Salman promised to increase his country’s US investment to $US1 trillion ($A1.5 trillion) from a $US600 billion ($A922 billion) pledge he made when Trump visited Saudi Arabia in May. But he offered no details or timetable.\n\nA $US1 trillion investment in the US would be difficult for Saudi Arabia to pull together given its heavy spending on an already-ambitious series of massive projects at home, including futuristic megacities that have gone over budget and faced delays and stadiums for the 2034 World Cup.\n\n‘Quiet piggy’\n\nThe White House meeting came just hours after astonishing footage emerged of Trump calling a journalist “piggy” as she questioned him about the Jeffrey Epstein case.\n\nCNN video of the incident aboard Air Force One on Friday (US time) emerged on Tuesday.\n\nAsked about recently released Epstein emails that mentioned him, Trump again denied any knowledge and said the focus should be on others who were named, including former US president Bill Clinton.\n\nWhen a Bloomberg News journalist tried to ask a follow-up question on Epstein, Trump turned to her and said: “Quiet. Quiet, piggy.”\n\nThe exchange occurred amid growing calls for the US Department of Justice to release files related to its investigation into Epstein, the late financier and convicted sex offender who died in prison in 2019.\n\nAlso on Tuesday, the US House of Representatives overwhelmingly passed a bipartisan bill to compel the release the department’s case files. It followed Trump dropping his long-standing opposition on Sunday, days after a House petition gathered enough support to force a vote.","url":"https://www.thenewdaily.com.au/news/world/us-news/trump-news/2025/11/19/trump-defends-saudi-khashoggi","image":"https://wp.thenewdaily.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/1763508278-edm-TrumpSaudiBinSalmanAAP.jpg?resize=1200%2C630","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-11-19 00:54:25","author":"Trump Defends Saudi Crown Prince In Khashoggi Killingthe New Dailynov 19, 2025, Updated Nov 19, 2025","authors":["Trump Defends Saudi Crown Prince In Khashoggi Killingthe New Dailynov 19, 2025, Updated Nov 19, 2025"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"au","sentiment":-0.02},{"id":380336660,"title":"Jamal Khashoggi, and Trump’s many flippant comments on human rights","text":"In 2018, the CIA under the first Trump administration concluded that Saudi Arabia’s Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman ordered the gruesome murder of a US resident and journalist, Jamal Khashoggi. The GOP-led Senate voted unanimously to condemn the crown prince. One Republican senator remarked at the time that if the matter went before a jury, the crown prince “would be convicted in 30 minutes.” President Donald Trump has made it abundantly clear that he simply doesn’t care about Khashoggi’s killing all that much. But even by his standards, Trump’s comments alongside the crown prince on Tuesday were stunning. Trump went from downplaying Khashoggi’s murder to vouching for the crown prince (who has denied personal involvement). While Trump previously suggested we’d never know for sure whether the crown prince were guilty, this time he said affirmatively that Prince bin Salman “knew nothing about it.” While the president previously gestured suggestively at conservative talking points about Khashoggi’s past associations with Islamist movements (a past that the evidence shows Khashoggi abandoned), this time Trump all but said the journalist had it coming. He called Khashoggi “extremely controversial,” and said, “Whether you liked him or didn’t like him, things happen” — as if dismembering someone with a bone saw were just a fluke. And perhaps most strikingly, Trump rebuked a reporter for even asking about this in the crown prince’s presence. “You don’t have to embarrass our guest by asking a question like that,” Trump said in the Oval Office. Khashoggi’s widow, Hanan Elatr Khashoggi, responded to Trump’s comments by saying the journalist’s past was “not justification to murder him.” “Jamal was a good, transparent and brave man,” she added in comments to CNN. Trump is hardly the first president to bow to the strategic and geopolitical importance of keeping good relations with Saudi Arabia; presidents of both parties have offered tough talk about the Saudis on the campaign trail and then adjusted course once in office. But what sets Trump apart is his almost complete lack of interest in even pretending that he’s factoring human rights into that equation. In fact, he opened his meeting with the crown prince on Tuesday by saying, “What he’s done is incredible, in terms of human rights and everything else.” And this has been a constant throughout Trump’s decade in the national spotlight. Here are some of his more remarkable comments on human rights and alleged human rights abusers, mostly from his first term. 2017: Likening US conduct to Vladimir Putin’s political assassinations Shortly after Trump first took office, then-Fox News host Bill O’Reilly posited to him that Russian President Vladimir Putin was “a killer.” “There are a lot of killers,” Trump said. “You think our country’s so innocent?” When Russia’s war in Ukraine began in 2022, Trump initially praised Putin’s “genius” and “savvy” in launching the unprovoked invasion, even as Western leaders roundly condemned it. (Trump has since said he’s “very disappointed” in the Russian leader amid the ongoing war.) 2018: Making similar comments about North Korea’s Kim Jong Un When another Fox host noted that North Korean leader Kim Jong Un executed lots of people, Trump responded: “He’s a tough guy.” When pressed again on Kim doing “some really bad things,” Trump added: “Yeah, but so have a lot of other people done some really bad things. I mean, I could go through a lot of nations where a lot of bad things were done. Now look, with all of that being said, the answer is yes.” 2016: Praising Saddam Hussein for killing alleged terrorists without due process “He was a bad guy — really bad guy,” Trump, then a presidential candidate, said of late Iraqi President Saddam Hussein. “But you know what he did well? He killed terrorists. He did that so good. They didn’t read them the rights. They didn’t talk. They were terrorists — over.” In fact, Hussein killed lots of people — not just alleged terrorists — without due process. A 2002 State Department report said he did so “because he believes that their political beliefs, faith, ethnic background, family members or acquaintances are a threat to his power.” 2017: Praising Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte for his drug war Former Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte’s drug war featured large numbers of extrajudicial killings and was widely condemned by human rights groups. And not only did Trump not condemn that; he at one point during his first term praised Duterte. “I just wanted to congratulate you because I am hearing of the unbelievable job on the drug problem,” Trump told Duterte during an April 29, 2017, phone call, according to a transcript whose basic contents were confirmed by CNN. Trump added: “Many countries have the problem, we have a problem, but what a great job you are doing, and I just wanted to call and tell you that.” (A senior US official said at the time that Trump was merely acknowledging the US is combating its own drug problem, not condoning violence and human rights violations.) 2019: Allegedly encouraging China’s Uyghur detention camps Former Trump national security adviser John Bolton in his 2020 book recounted a scene from a G20 summit. In it, Trump and Chinese leader Xi Jinping discussed the Chinese government’s detention camps for Uyghur Muslims in western China. “With only interpreters present, Xi had explained to Trump why he was basically building concentration camps in Xinjiang. According to our interpreter, Trump said that Xi should go ahead with building the camps, which Trump thought was exactly the right thing to do,” Bolton wrote. “The National Security Council’s top Asia staffer, Matthew Pottinger, told me that Trump said something very similar during his November 2017 trip to China.” Then-US Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer denied the account, calling it “absolutely untrue” and “completely crazy.” 2025: Praising Belarus’ president Trump in a social media post in August referred to the “highly respected President of Belarus, Aleksandr Lukashenko.” Lukashenko has long been accused of egregious human rights abuses and even crimes against humanity. He has often been called Europe’s last dictator by foreign policy watchers. What’s more, Trump’s own State Department in 2020 declined to recognize Lukashenko as the legitimate president of Belarus, citing a rigged election.","url":"https://edition.cnn.com/2025/11/18/politics/human-rights-trump-khashoggi-analysis","image":"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/gettyimages-2247326496.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-11-19 00:53:16","author":"Aaron Blake","authors":["Aaron Blake"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.18},{"id":380334148,"title":"Trump Loves To Mock Biden For This 1 Thing — But Goes Viral For Doing It Too","text":"President Donald Trump took a swipe at former President Joe Biden for “sleeping all the time” — despite being flamed just weeks ago by his own critics for seemingly nodding off on the job. \n\nImages hit the internet earlier this month of Trump appearing to struggle to stay awake during a Nov. 6 meeting at the White House.

On Tuesday, he called a journalist who asked about it in the Oval Office a “terrible person” and her network, the US’s ABC, should have its licence revoked.\n\n“I have nothing to do with Jeffrey Epstein,” Trump said while hosting a visit by Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman.\n\n“I threw him out of my club many years ago because I thought he was a sick pervert.”\n\nThe White House was caught off-guard by how quickly the measure passed through Congress, having expected it to take longer in the Senate, according to two people with direct knowledge of the matter.\n\nThe fight over the Epstein papers has taken a toll on Trump’s public approval, which fell to its lowest point this year.\n\nA Reuters/Ipsos poll released on Monday found that just one in five voters overall approved of his handling of the issue. Among Republicans, just 44 per cent thought Trump was handling it well.\n\nTrump socialised and partied with Epstein in the 1990s and 2000s before what he calls a rift. But the friendship has become a rare weak spot for Trump with his supporters.\n\n“Please stop making this political, it is not about you, President Trump,” Jena-Lisa Jones, who said Epstein sexually abused her when she was 14, told a press conference outside the Capitol a few hours before the vote.\n\n“I voted for you, but your behaviour on this issue has been a national embarrassment.”\n\nThe family of Virginia Giuffre, one of Epstein’s most prominent accusers, emerged from the vote with tears of gratitude. She died by suicide earlier this year.\n\nHer brother, Sky Roberts, called on Trump not to delay.\n\n“The reality is, right now, he could release the files today if he really wanted to,” he said.\n\nTrump has said he had no connection to Epstein’s crimes and has begun calling the issue a “Democratic hoax”. However, Republicans were among the loudest voices calling for the release of the records from criminal investigations of Epstein.\n\nEpstein pleaded guilty to a Florida state felony prostitution charge in 2008 and served 13 months in jail.\n\nThe US Justice Department charged him with sex trafficking of minors in 2019.

(AP Photo/Evan Vucci)\n\nA jovial President Donald Trump held a warm and friendly meeting with Saudi Crown Prince Mohammad bin Salman at the White House, packed with plenty of handshakes and back pats. He brushed aside questions about Saudi Arabia's human rights record, praised the prince for his statesmanship and announced hundreds of billions of dollars in new Saudi investment in the United States. The White House rolled out plenty of pomp for the Saudi royal on Tuesday, dispatching fighter jets that the two leaders watched from a red carpet, parading out an honor guard on horseback and preparing to give a lavish dinner in the East Room. In a sitdown in the Oval Office that took place just seven years after Prince Mohammad was implicated by U.S. intelligence agencies in the killing of journalist Jamal Khashoggi, Trump and the prince took numerous questions from reporters - one of whom was repeatedly insulted by Trump - on everything from commerce to the sale of advanced F-35 fighter jets to Riyadh. Here is a look at some of the takeaways from the visit: Movement on military cooperation Trump had previewed his decision to sell F-35s on Sunday but formalized it before the prince on Tuesday when he said the approval was complete and that Israel's fears about maintaining its qualitative military edge in the Middle East would be addressed. Live Events Details of the deal were not immediately clear, but some in the Pentagon and other agencies have opposed the sale because of the potential for advanced technology being shared with China, which also has close ties with Saudi Arabia. \"As far as I'm concerned, I think they are both at a level where they should get top of the line,\" Trump said of Saudi Arabia and Israel, which already has F-35s. \"Israel's aware and they're going to be very happy.\" Israeli officials have suggested that they would not be opposed to Saudi Arabia getting F-35s as long as Saudi Arabia normalizes relations with Israel under the Abraham Accords framework. The Saudis have said they would join the Abraham Accords but only after there is a credible and guaranteed path to Palestinian statehood, a position Prince Mohammad repeated in the meeting. \"We want to be part of the Abraham Accords, but we want also to be sure that we secure a clear path of two-state solution,\" he said. \"We're going to work on that to be sure that we come prepared for the situation as soon as possible to have that.\" Trump also said the U.S. and Saudi Arabia would complete a broader agreement on military and security issues during the visit and that the U.S. would proceed with a civilian nuclear agreement with Saudi Arabia, about which Israel also has raised concerns. Khashoggi's killing gets swept aside Tuesday's meeting was the first White House visit for the crown prince since Khashoggi, a U.S. resident and Washington Post columnist, was killed and dismembered at the Saudi consulate in Istanbul, Turkey, in 2018. U.S. intelligence said Prince Mohammad likely approved the slaying. In a remarkable scene in the Oval Office, the prince, nicknamed MBS, faced questions from reporters, something not typical for the de facto head of the absolute monarchy where dissent is criminalized. He was asked about Khashoggi's slaying along with the role that Saudi citizens played in the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks in the United States. Trump, however, lashed out at the reporter for the line of questioning. Trump called Khashoggi, a Saudi pro-democracy activist, \"extremely controversial\" and said \"a lot of people didn't like that gentleman that you're talking about. Whether you like him or didn't like him, things happen, but he (the crown prince) knew nothing about it and we can leave it at that.\" Prince Mohammad, who has denied involvement in Khashoggi's killing, replied that his government had taken action. \"It's been painful for us in Saudi Arabia,\" he said. \"We did all the right steps of investigation, etc., in Saudi Arabia, and we've improved our system to be sure that nothing happens like that again. And it's painful, and it was a huge mistake.\" Trump also commended the Saudi leader for strides made by the kingdom on human rights without providing any specific detail but presumably referring to reforms relating to women's rights. \"What's he done is incredible in terms of human rights and everything else,\" Trump said. Lots of pomp and circumstance Trump greeted Prince Mohammed at the White House's South Lawn entrance with a handshake and arm slung over the prince's shoulder. Trump literally rolled out the red carpet for the Saudi leader, with a military band on hand and a flyover by U.S. military planes, before showing the crown prince his decorations along the White House Colonnade. \"We have a extremely respected man in the Oval Office today,\" Trump said at the top of meeting, calling the prince \"a friend of mine for a very long time.\" Trump also castigated his predecessor, former President Joe Biden, for greeting Prince Mohammed with a fist bump during his 2022 visit to Saudi Arabia. \"When you get out of the plane and you get the future king - and a man who is one of the most respected people in the world - you shake his hand, you don't give him a fist bump, right?\" Trump said. \"Trump doesn't give a fist bump.

Lawson-Remer has said they include county support for nonprofits that deal with seniors, food access, behavioral health, homelessness and other safety-net programs.\n\nIn exchange for support from the foundation, the county will contribute $4 million of the $18 million freed up in its budget to the San Diego Unity Fund, a community grant program created by the foundation in September. Taxpayers will pay an additional $900,000 to the foundation for an administrative fee for the county’s donation.\n\nThe foundation has partnered with two other local philanthropic juggernauts — the Prebys Foundation and Price Philanthropies — to give tens of millions of dollars to local groups that work on access to food, health care and housing.\n\nPhilanthropic leaders see threats to those needs from Republican-led legislation signed by President Donald Trump that cut funding for Medicaid and food stamps, while imposing new eligibility and work requirements for some people who use the programs.\n\nOn Tuesday, Lawson-Remer’s proposed agreement to pair private money with public services got a mostly warm reception from other supervisors.\n\nSupervisor Joel Anderson, who represents much of the county’s unincorporated area, said he was backing it as a way to support communities in his district that lack access to mass transit and have household incomes far below the county median.\n\n“I trust that the foundation will take those people into consideration, and make sure the unincorporated communities are also covered,” Anderson said.\n\nSupervisors Paloma Aguirre and Monica Montgomery Steppe asked that supervisors get informal updates on how the new savings are spent and on the overall progress of the partnership.\n\nSupervisors voted 4-1 in support of the partnership, with Supervisor Jim Desmond voting against it.\n\nDesmond downplayed concerns about new work requirements for recipients of Medicaid and SNAP, the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, pointing to various exemptions.\n\nFor Medicaid, exemptions extend to people with children under 13, disabled veterans, people who are medically frail and Native Americans, among others. SNAP recipients are exempt if they have children or certain disabilities, or are a veteran or homeless.\n\n“These are described as devastating requirements and cuts,” he said. “I think these are good achievable goals. Those who really need the benefits will remain on them.”\n\nCounty estimates indicate it could still cost the county up to $300 million a year to administer the new rules, and to cover potential cost-sharing for food stamps.\n\nEnsuring SNAP recipients are employed could cost the county between $4.6 million and $27.8 million. It’s still unclear how often they’ll have to verify their employment, and therefore how many new staffers the county will need.\n\nThe federal government previously covered the cost of SNAP benefits, but new cost-sharing measures passed by Congress could cost the county $150 million per year if the state doesn’t step in to absorb some of that cost.\n\nWith Medi-Cal, verifying work requirements could cost between $21 million and $63 million to hire new county staff, depending on how frequently employment will need to be reported, county estimates suggest.\n\nCiting those new costs, Democratic supervisors have begun to lay the groundwork for a potential ballot measure next year to raise taxes and bring in more revenue for the county.","summary":"The San Diego Foundation has stepped in to pay county contractors in exchange for taxpayer support for its new community grant program.","url":"https://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/2025/11/18/we-have-to-be-creative-supervisors-ok-partnership-with-philanthropists-to-free-up-13m-in-county-budget/","image":"https://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/SUT-L-County-Corp-Counsel-005.jpg?w=1600&resize=1600,900","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-11-19 00:48:48","author":"Lucas Robinson","authors":["Lucas Robinson"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.016},{"id":380336118,"title":"Judges toss Texas House map","text":"A federal court on Tuesday blocked Texas from using a redrawn U.S. House map that touched off a nationwide redistricting battle and is a major piece of President Donald Trump’s efforts to preserve a slim Republican majority ahead of the 2026 elections.\n\nThe ruling is a blow to Trump’s rush to create a more favorable political landscape for Republicans in next year’s midterms, at least for now. Texas Gov. Greg Abbott vowed a swift appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court and defended the map that was engineered to give Republicans five additional House seats.\n\nBut in a 2-1 ruling, a panel of federal judges in El Paso sided with opponents who argued that Texas’ unusual summer redrawing of congressional districts would harm Black and Hispanic residents. The decision was authored by U.S. District Judge Jeffrey V. Brown, who was nominated to the bench by Trump during his first term.\n\n“The public perception of this case is that it’s about politics. To be sure, politics played a role in drawing the 2025 Map. But it was much more than just politics. Substantial evidence shows that Texas racially gerrymandered the 2025 Map,” the ruling states.\n\nThe decision comes amid an widening national battle over redistricting. Missouri and North Carolina followed Texas with new maps adding an additional Republican seat each. To counter those moves, California voters approved a ballot initiative to give Democrats an additional five seats there.\n\nA coalition of civil rights groups representing Black and Hispanic voters argued the map reduced the influence of minority voters, making it a racial gerrymander that violates the federal Voting Rights Act and the U.S. Constitution.\n\nThey sought an order blocking Texas from using the map while their case proceeded, which would force the state to use the map drawn by the GOP-controlled Legislature in 2021 for next year’s elections.\n\n“The Legislature redrew our congressional maps to better reflect Texans’ conservative voting preferences – and for no other reason,” Abbott said in a statement. “Any claim that these maps are discriminatory is absurd and unsupported by the testimony offered during ten days of hearings.”\n\nThe panel of judges granted the critics’ request, signaling that they think those critics have a substantial chance of winning their case at trial. An appointee of Democratic President Barack Obama joined Brown in the majority, while an appointee of Republican President Ronald Reagan dissented.\n\n“Without an injunction, the racial minorities the Plaintiff Groups represent will be forced to be represented in Congress based on likely unconstitutional racial classifications for at least two years,” the ruling said.","summary":"A federal court on Tuesday blocked Texas from using a redrawn U.S. House map that touched off a nationwide redistricting battle and is a major piece of President Donald Trump's efforts to preserve a slim Republican majority ahead of the 2026 elections.","url":"https://www.bostonherald.com/2025/11/18/judges-toss-texas-house-map/","image":"https://www.bostonherald.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/AP25322660177919_90065e.jpg?w=1600&resize=1600,900","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-11-19 00:48:28","author":"Associated Press","authors":["Associated Press"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.359},{"id":380334286,"title":"US Senate Approves Bill to Release Epstein Files","text":"WASHINGTON: The US Senate on Tuesday approved a House-passed bill ordering the release of federal files on Jeffrey Epstein, the disgraced financier whose extensive alleged sex trafficking network fueled one of the country's most incendiary scandals.

They have the authority to make them public.\n\nBefore the vote on Tuesday, members of Congress who have been leading the bill – Democrat Ro Khanna and Republicans Thomas Massie and Marjorie Taylor Greene – spoke alongside survivors of Epstein’s abuse outside the US Capitol.\n\n“We fought the president, the attorney general, the FBI director, the speaker of the House and the vice president to get this win.

Nov. 17, 2025: Trinidad and Tobago–born rapper Nicki Minaj shocked many more today, publicly praising President Donald Trump and thanking him from the podium of the United Nations Headquarters. Her appearance — the first time a female rapper has addressed the UN — instantly raised eyebrows across the Caribbean, the African Diaspora and the immigrant and music world.\n\nBut Minaj’s sudden embrace of Trump is rooted in one specific issue: what she sees as the “persecution” of Christians in Nigeria.\n\nThe megastar spoke softly but firmly during a four-minute address ahead of a panel titled “Combating Religious Violence and the Killing of Christians in Nigeria.” She thanked Trump “for prioritizing this issue,” claiming Christians in Nigeria are being killed “simply because of how they pray.”\n\nHer comments echoed Trump’s own narrative. And that is precisely where the controversy lies.\n\nAccording to reporting by TIME, Minaj’s participation was arranged by Trump adviser Alex Bruesewitz. Before she took the podium, UN Ambassador Mike Waltz thanked her for being willing to “demand action” on behalf of Christians.\n\nThis follows a recent pattern: Minaj has repeatedly amplified Trump’s messaging online, including:\n\n• reposting a Truth Social message claiming Christianity faces an “existential threat” in Nigeria• sharing a White House pro-MAGA video soundtracked by her own hit “Beez In the Trap”• promoting a xenophobic and anti-trans video praising Trump’s achievements — a move that cost her more than 100,000 followers\n\nIn each instance, Minaj publicly aligned herself with Trump’s framing of Nigeria’s violence as a one-sided religious war.\n\nResearch indicates otherwise.\n\nIndependent data from the Armed Conflict Location & Event Data Project, (ACLED) and the Council on Foreign Relations, shows violence in Nigeria is complex — driven by overlapping factors including:\n\n• extremist activity• criminal banditry• farmer–herder land disputes• economic insecurity• political instability\n\nNot religion alone.\n\nExperts interviewed by ABC, CNN, and Al-Jazeera agree: The violence is indiscriminate and affects both Christians and Muslims.\n\nNigerian officials have repeatedly pushed back on the “Christians only” framing. Gimba Kakanda, Senior Special Assistant to the Nigerian President, wrote in Al-Jazeera that conflicts often “unfold along regional or community lines, not strictly religious ones.”\n\nHuman rights lawyer Bulama Bukarti added that presenting the crisis as Christian persecution alone “distorts reality and inflames tensions.”\n\nBased on the timeline, three factors explain her sudden praise:\n\nMinaj has recently emphasized Christianity as central to her identity and public messaging. Trump’s narrative directly appeals to that shift.\n\nHer UN appearance was facilitated by Trump’s political team — not by the UN itself. This was a platform engineered to validate his claim.\n\nBy repeating Trump’s talking points, she instantly became a megaphone for his Nigeria narrative — even though the data behind it is contested.\n\nLate in her speech, she emphasized she was “not taking sides politically.” But thanking Trump first — and exclusively — contradicted that claim. Her remarks came after Trump threatened to “invade Nigeria guns-a-blazing” to stop supposed “Islamic extremists,” despite no evidence of a religion-only genocide.\n\nNicki Minaj — a Caribbean-born global superstar with massive influence — has now waded into one of Africa’s most misunderstood crises.Her endorsement gives Trump’s Nigeria narrative celebrity amplification, even as researchers and Nigerian leaders warn that such framing can worsen division on the ground.\n\nWhether Minaj intended to or not, she has become part of a geopolitical messaging war — one where data and politics often clash.\n\nFor now, the answer to the question: “Why is Nicki Minaj singing Trump’s praises?” is clear:\n\nBecause she has embraced his narrative on Nigeria – a narrative her team has not independently vetted, but which aligns with Trump’s strategy, messaging and political goals.\n\nWatch The Speech Here","url":"https://trinidadtribune.com/why-is-nicki-minaj-singing-donald-trumps-praises/","image":"https://trinidadtribune.com/app/uploads/2025/11/nicki-minaj-un-speech-1024x683-9xm4HQ.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-11-19 00:47:26","author":"Cb_usr","authors":["Cb_usr"],"language":"en","source_country":"tt","sentiment":0.195},{"id":380336868,"title":"Mexico&#039;s president rejects Trump&#039;s offer of military intervention against cartels","text":"Mexico's president on Tuesday ruled out allowing US strikes against cartels on Mexican soil, a day after US President Donald Trump said he was willing to do whatever it takes to stop drugs entering the US.\"It's not going to happen,\" President Claudia Sheinbaum said.\"He (Trump) has suggested it on various occasions or he has said, 'we offer you a United States military intervention in Mexico, whatever you need to fight the criminal groups,'\" she said. \"But I have told him on every occasion that we can collaborate, that they can help us with information they have, but that we operate in our territory, that we do not accept any intervention by a foreign government.\"Sheinbaum said she had said this to Trump and to US Secretary of State Marco Rubio on previous occasions and that they have understood..preferred-source-banner{ margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom:10px;}\"Would I want strikes in Mexico to stop drugs?

And on Tuesday, Sheinbaum said that the International Boundary and Water Commission, a binational agency that determines the border between the two countries, was getting involved.The signs, driven into the sand near where the Rio Grande empties into the Gulf of Mexico, caused a stir when witnesses said men in a boat arrived at the local beach known as Playa Bagdad and erected them.The signs read in English and Spanish, \"Warning: Restricted Area\" and went on to explain that it was Department of Defense property and had been declared restricted by \"the commander.\" It said there could be no unauthorized access, photography or drawings of the area.The US Embassy in Mexico shared a comment from the Pentagon Tuesday about the incident, confirming that contractors putting up signs to mark the \"National Defense Area III\" had placed signs at the mouth of the Rio Grande.\"Changes in water depth and topography altered the perception of the international boundary's location,\" the statement said. \"Government of Mexico personnel removed 6 signs based on their perception of the international boundary's location.\"The Pentagon said the contractors would \"coordinate with appropriate agencies to avoid confusion in the future.\"Mexico had contacted its consulate in Brownsville, Texas and then the US Embassy in Mexico City. Eventually, it was determined that contractors working for some US government entity had placed the signs, Sheinbaum said.\"But the river changes its course, it breaks loose and according to the treaty you have to clearly demarcate the national border,\" Sheinbaum said during her daily press briefing.The area is close to SpaceX Starbase, which sits adjacent to Boca Chica Beach on the Texas side of the Rio Grande.The facility and launch site for the SpaceX rocket program is under contract with the Department of Defense and NASA, which hopes to send astronauts back to the moon and someday to Mars.In June, Sheinbaum said the government was looking into contamination from the SpaceX facility after pieces of metal, plastic and rocket pieces were reportedly found on the Mexican side of the border following the explosion of a rocket during a test.The area also carries the added sensitivity of Trump's order to rename the Gulf of Mexico as the Gulf of America, which Mexico has also rejected.- EndsPublished By: Satyam SinghPublished On: Nov 19, 2025Trending Reel","url":"https://www.indiatoday.in/world/story/mexico-rejects-us-military-intervention-against-cartels-glbs-2822214-2025-11-19","image":"https://akm-img-a-in.tosshub.com/indiatoday/images/story/202511/claudia-sheinbaum-19461427-16x9_0.png?VersionId=sQCLBOe9aVArNTwZDtKV9FN46hN3wwnz?size=1280:720","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-11-19 00:46:57","author":"Associated Press","authors":["Associated Press"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"in","sentiment":-0.058},{"id":380333466,"title":"Trump and Mike Johnson embrace Epstein ‘transparency’ ...kicking and screaming all the way","text":"After months of delays and the hemming and hawing of all parties involved, Republican resistance to releasing the Epstein files collapsed into dust on Tuesday.\n\nDonald Trump, facing an outright rebellion among his base, caved to pressure and reversed course on Sunday. In a post to Truth Social, Trump called on Republicans to back down and vote “yes” on a resolution compelling the federal government to release the files, which Trump as president, does not need Congress’s permission to do. \n\nImmediately, the GOP flipped a switch and every one of the chamber’s Republican members who’d spent weeks refusing to sign on to the bipartisan discharge petition headed up by Reps. Thomas Massie and Ro Khanna were on board. Rep. Clay Higgins, a Louisiana conservative Republican, was the only “nay” vote in the entire chamber.\n\nTrump may end up the biggest loser in this, especially given the breadth of documents and emails already public about the 2019 investigation of Jeffrey Epstein, a convicted pedophile and child sex trafficker. Many mention Trump himself, including a number of emails released last week wherein Epstein writes that he had dirt on the president and claimed that Trump “knew about the girls”. Trump and the White House furiously denied this and have called the speculation about Trump’s knowledge of the sex trafficking ring a “Democrat hoax”.\n\nBut for now, the biggest loser is undoubtedly Johnson, who was just saved by Trump from a massive rebellion in his own chamber. Four Republican members already had broken ranks to sign on to the discharge petition; dozens more were expected by congressional reporters on Tuesday’s vote, even if Trump hadn’t given them outright permission.\n\nThe speaker of the House spent more than a month swerving the vote. He kept the chamber in recess through the entire month of October and avoided swearing in Rep. Adelita Grijalva, the 218th signature on the discharge petition, in an attempt to stave it off. Johnson frequently criticized the legislation he voted for on Tuesday, calling it a “shiny object” and decrying it as “sad” that Republicans were signing on to the petition.\n\n“We’re working around the clock to ensure that justice is served and also as part of the oversight to figure out why justice has been delayed for so long,” Johnson said in October, as he kept the House out of session.\n\nRecently lauded as one of the most effective Republican speakers and infinitely more so than his predecessor, Kevin McCarthy, Mike Johnson now appears to be on the ropes once again.\n\nTuesday’s vote kicks the issue out of his chamber. The resolution flew through the Senate with unanimous consent, dealing one final blow to the Speaker, who’d requested that the GOP-held chamber make amendments to the bill.\n\nBut Johnson’s own problem isn’t going anywhere. Marjorie Taylor Greene, one of the four Republicans on the discharge petition, remains his most vocal critic in the chamber from the right and this latest episode allowed Greene to find her voice not just against Johnson but Trump as well, vaulting her to new heights of notoriety. She and others, including the chamber’s Democrats, remain focused on pressuring the GOP to put forward a plan for averting a massive health care premium spike set to hit at the end of the year. \n\nConservative Republicans, including Trump, want to scrap the Affordable Care Act (Obamacare) altogether and provide Americans with subsidies directly to purchase health care plans. Democrats and some centrist Republicans want to extend subsidies for Obamacare exchange plans passed under the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA). \n\nJohnson, well aware of what happened the last time his party tried to repeal the Affordable Care Act, is stuck in the middle. He’s also keenly aware of another reality: any health care plan the GOP concocts in the remainder of 2025 or next year will be a near-impossible sell to every member of his caucus simultaneously, which means that making a deal with Democrats is the most likely option to get a bill through that addresses those impending premium spikes.\n\nAmerica is quickly approaching another election year, and Johnson remains the most likely to lose control of his chamber in the midterms next fall. Averting that fate and finding the political strength to push through a fix for jumping health care premiums may hinge entirely on his ability to rein in wayward Republicans who’re now feeling the wrath of a spurned Donald Trump and have more reason than ever before to back away.","summary":"In Congress, Mike Johnson stayed in lockstep with the president on the issue of the Epstein files.

(AP Photo/Evan Vucci)\n\nPresident Donald Trump on Tuesday dismissed U.S. intelligence findings that Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman likely had some culpability in the 2018 killing of Washington Post journalist Jamal Khashoggi as Trump warmly welcomed the de facto ruler of Saudi Arabia on his first White House visit in seven years. The U.S.-Saudi relationship had, for a time, been sent into a tailspin by the operation targeting Khashoggi, a fierce critic of the kingdom. But seven years later, the dark clouds over the relationship have been cleared away. And Trump is tightening his embrace of the 40-year-old crown prince, who he said is an indispensable player in shaping the Middle East in the decades to come. Trump in his defense of the crown prince derided Khashoggi as \"extremely controversial\" and said \"a lot of people didn't like that gentleman.\" Prince Mohammed denies involvement in the killing of Khashoggi, who was a Saudi citizen and Virginia resident. \"Whether you like him or didn't like him, things happen,\" Trump said of the international incident when asked about it by a reporter during an Oval Office appearance with Prince Mohammed. \"But (Prince Mohammed) knew nothing about it. And we can leave it at that. You don't have to embarrass our guest by asking a question like that.\"Live Events But U.S. intelligence officials determined that the Saudi crown prince likely approved the killing by Saudi agents of U.S.-based journalist inside the Saudi consulate in Istanbul , according to U.S. findings declassified in 2021 at the start of the Biden administration. Trump officials, during his first administration, refused to release the report. Prince Mohammed said Saudi Arabia \"did all the right steps\" to investigate Khashoggi's death. \"It's painful and it's a huge mistake,\" he said. Trump, who said the two leaders have become \"good friends,\" even commended the Saudi leader for strides made by the kingdom on human rights without providing any specific detail. \"What's he done is incredible in terms of human rights and everything else,\" Trump said. President Joe Biden labeled the oil-rich kingdom \"pariah\" state in the early days of his successful 2020 White House run. After taking office, his administration made clear the president would avoid direct engagement with the crown prince. But eventually Biden determined that freezing out the Saudis was not tenable as oil prices spiked following Russia's February 2022 invasion of Ukraine. Biden even paid a visit to Prince Mohammed in Jeddah in July 2022 of that year to urge the prince and fellow members of the OPEC+ oil cartel to pump more oil to alleviate high gas prices. New investment from Saudis The crown prince for his part announced Saudi Arabia was increasing its planned investments in the U.S. to $1 trillion, up from $600 billion that the Saudis announced they would pour into the United States when Trump visited the kingdom in May. Echoing rhetoric that Trump likes to use, the crown prince used the moment to flatter the Republican leader by calling the U.S. the \"hottest country on the planet\" for foreign investment. \"What you're creating is not about an opportunity today. It's also about long term opportunity,\" Prince Mohammed said. Trump's family has a strong personal interest in the kingdom. In September, London real estate developer Dar Global announced that it plans to launch Trump Plaza in the Red Sea city of Jeddah. It's Dar Global's second collaboration with the Trump Organization, the collection of companies controlled by the U.S. president's children, in Saudi Arabia. Trump pushed back on suggestions that there could be a conflict of interest in his family's dealings with the Saudis. \"I have nothing to do with the family business,\" Trump said. Trump's comments about Khashoggi's and defense of his family's business in Saudi Arabia were blasted by human rights and government oversight activists. Human rights groups say Saudi authorities continue to harshly repress dissent, including by arresting human rights defenders, journalists, and political dissidents for criticism against the kingdom. They also note a surge in executions in Saudi Arabia that they connect to an effort to suppress internal dissent. \"President Trump has Jamal Khashoggi's blood on his hands,\" said Raed Jarrar, advocacy director for DAWN, a U.S.-based group advocating for democracy and human rights in the Arab world that was founded by Khashoggi. Jarrar added, \"Trump has made himself complicit in every execution and imprisonment MBS has ordered since.\" Rolling out the red carpet Trump warmly received Prince Mohammed when he arrived at the White House Tuesday morning for a pomp-filled arrival ceremony that included a military flyover and a thundering greeting from the U.S. Marine band. Technically, it's not a state visit, because the crown prince is not the head of state. But Prince Mohammed has taken charge of the day-to-day governing for his father, King Salman, 89, who has endured health problems in recent years. Trump showed the prince the newly-installed Presidential Walk of Fame that features gold-framed images of past presidents along the West Wing colonnade and a photo of an autopen signing the name of Biden in place of the Democrat's official portrait. Later, Trump, with the first lady Melania Trump, will welcome the crown prince for formal dinner in the White House East Room. The two nations are also planning an investment summit at the Kennedy Center on Wednesday that will include the heads of Salesforce, Qualcomm, Pfizer, the Cleveland Clinic, Chevron and Aramco, Saudi Arabia's national oil and natural gas company, where even more deals with the Saudis could be announced. Fighter jets and business deals Ahead of Prince Mohammed's arrival, Trump announced he has agreed to sell the Saudis F-35 fighter jets despite some concerns within the administration that the sale could lead to China gaining access to the U.S. technology behind the advanced weapon system. Trump's announcement is also surprising because some in the Republican administration have been wary about upsetting Israel's qualitative military edge over its neighbors, especially at a time when Trump is depending on Israeli support for the success of his Gaza peace plan. Abraham Accord talks The unexpected move comes at a moment when Trump is trying to nudge the Saudis toward normalizing relations with Israel. The president in his first term had helped forge commercial and diplomatic ties between Israel and Bahrain, Morocco and the United Arab Emirates through an effort dubbed the Abraham Accords. Trump sees expansion of the accords as essential to his broader efforts to build stability in the Middle East after the two-year Israel-Hamas war in Gaza. Getting Saudi Arabia - the largest Arab economy and the birthplace of Islam - to sign on would spur a domino effect, he argues. But the Saudis have maintained that a path toward Palestinian statehood must first be established before normalizing relations with Israel can be considered. The Israelis remain steadfastly opposed to the creation of a Palestinian state. \"We want to be part of the Abraham Accords, but we want also to be sure that we secure a clear path of a two-state solution,\" Prince Mohammed said.Add as a Reliable and Trusted News Source Add Now!\n (You can now subscribe to our Economic Times WhatsApp channel)\n\nRead More News ontrumpwhite housepresidential walk of fametrump organizationjamal khashoggi\n\n(Catch all the Business News, Breaking News and Latest News Updates on The Economic Times.)

The planes have been delivered to the US Air Force, Navy and Marines.\n Here are things to know about the F-35: The fighter jet is coveted by many Marines used the F-35 to execute strikes against enemy targets in Afghanistan, while Italian F-35s were part of a NATO response in September to Russian aircraft in Estonian airspace.\nBut the stubby-nosed aircraft with twin tail fins has been criticised since its inception, in part because it was designed to serve the varying needs of three different military branches. For example, the Navy launches them off aircraft carriers, while the Marines Corps’ version can take off and land like a helicopter.\nIt is the most expensive Pentagon spending program ever — they cost up to USD 77 million a piece in 2023, according to the Congressional Research Service — while they have been famously beset with cost overruns and delays.\nMeanwhile, China may have at least some intelligence, albeit several years old, on the planes already. The Defense Science Board, which advises the Pentagon, released a report in 2013 alleging that Chinese cyberattacks accessed data from dozens of Pentagon programs, including the joint strike fighter.\n The most advanced US fighter jet The F-35 is “widely recognised as America’s best and most advanced fighter jet,” according to Bradley Bowman, senior director of the Center on Military and Political Power at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies.\nBowman noted that American military systems are constantly being updated and improved, counteracting any possible stolen secrets years ago.\n“That’s why you have 19 partner nations already and why countries like Saudi Arabia want it,” Bowman said. “If the aircraft was so compromised because of theft from the Chinese, the Saudis wouldn’t want it.” First proposed in the 1990s, the F-35 was meant to replace several aging fighters, including the Air Force’s workhorse F-16. The plane was designed to allow pilots to easily shift from bombing runs to aerial combat on the same mission.\nDescribed as a fifth-generation fighter, its technologies include stealth coatings as well as advanced radar and sensors, according to the Congressional Research Service.\n“What makes the F-35 particularly formidable is the increased difficulty our adversaries have in detecting it,” Bowman said. “So if you can’t see it, you can’t kill it.” Bowman said the plane also has advanced sensors to better detect enemies as well as networking capabilities to communicate with allied planes and ground forces during combat.\nEach plane was supposed to be relatively cheap to build, with each variation constructed on the same assembly line. But as the first F-35 prepared for its inaugural flight in 2006, the program’s cost had grown substantially.\n High costs for the aircraft According to a September report from the Government Accountability Office, a Defense Department estimate said maintaining, operating and modernising the planned 2,470 planes over a 77-year life cycle will exceed USD 2 trillion.\nThe report also found that Lockheed delivered 110 aircraft last year, all of which “were late by an average of 238 days, up from 61 days in 2023.” Meanwhile, there have been concerns about readiness. In 2023, the rate at which the aircraft can perform one of its tasked missions was about 55 per cent, far below program goals, the Government Accountability Office found. Part of the problem was delays in setting up maintenance facilities, inadequate equipment and supply issues.\nDan Grazier, a senior fellow and director of the National Security Reform Program at the Stimson Center, said the F-35 program has ultimately been a failure.\nHe pointed to the aircraft’s stealth coating to evade radar detection, which he said requires a lot of maintenance, while a camera system to provide situational awareness also has had problems.\n“It does not matter what kind of transformational combat capability an aircraft has if it cannot be relied upon,” he said, The F-35 was designed to replace several different older airplanes at once, Grazier said, noting that it does “a lot of things kind of well, but it doesn’t do anything great.” “It also costs a fortune,” he said. “So you pay a fortune for an aircraft that is actually in many cases less capable than what came before it.” Lockheed Martin pushed back on such criticisms.\n“The F-35 is the cornerstone of the battlespace for 20 allied nations, enabling peace through strength,” the company said in a statement. “It is combat proven and offers the most advanced capability and technology. With more than 1 million hours flown and more than 1,255 aircraft in service, the F-35 is an indispensable contributor to global security.” (AP) OZ OZ","summary":"","url":"https://www.news18.com/agency-feeds/what-to-know-about-f-35-fighter-jet-that-trump-is-selling-to-saudi-arabia-9716856.html","image":"https://images.news18.com/ibnlive/uploads/2025/07/News18_World_Section_Default_Image_1600x900-2025-07-4401653589b9d10b46b8abb07f758342.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-11-19 00:41:24","author":"News18","authors":["News18"],"language":"en","source_country":"in","sentiment":-0.085},{"id":380337310,"title":"US Congress passes bill to force release Epstein files, sending bill to Trump","text":"Both the House and Senate acted decisively Tuesday to pass a bill to force the Justice Department to publicly release its files on the convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, a remarkable display of approval for an effort that had struggled for months to overcome opposition from President Donald Trump and Republican leadership.When a small, bipartisan group of House lawmakers introduced a petition in July to maneuver around House Speaker Mike Johnson's control of which bills reach the House floor, it appeared a longshot effort - especially as Trump urged his supporters to dismiss the matter as a \"hoax.\" But both Trump and Johnson failed in their efforts to prevent the vote. Now the president has bowed to the growing momentum behind the bill and even said he will sign it. Just hours after the House passed the bill, the Senate agreed to pass the bill with unanimous consent once it is sent to the Senate.The bill passed the House 427-1, with the only no vote coming from Rep. Clay Higgins, a Louisiana Republican who is a fervent supporter of Trump. He said in a statement that he opposed the bill because it could release information on innocent people mentioned in the federal investigation.The decisive, bipartisan work in Congress Tuesday further showed the pressure mounting on lawmakers and the Trump administration to meet long-held demands that the Justice Department release its case files on Epstein, a well-connected financier who killed himself in a Manhattan jail while awaiting trial in 2019 on charges he sexually abused and trafficked underage girls.Live Events\"These women have fought the most horrific fight that no woman should have to fight. And they did it by banding together and never giving up,\" said Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene as she stood with some of the abuse survivors outside the Capitol Tuesday morning.\"That's what we did by fighting so hard against the most powerful people in the world, even the president of the United States, in order to make this vote happen today,\" added Greene, a Georgia Republican and longtime Trump loyalist.The bill's passage would be a pivotal moment in a yearslong push by the survivors for accountability for Epstein's abuse and reckoning over how law enforcement officials failed to act under multiple presidential administrations.A separate investigation conducted by the House Oversight Committee has released thousands of pages of emails and other documents from Epstein's estate, showing his connections to global leaders, Wall Street powerbrokers, influential political figures and Trump himself. In the United Kingdom, King Charles III stripped his disgraced brother Prince Andrew of his remaining titles and evicted him from his royal residence after pressure to act over his relationship with Epstein.The bill forces the release within 30 days of all files and communications related to Epstein, as well as any information about the investigation into his death in federal prison. It would allow the Justice Department to redact information about Epstein's victims or continuing federal investigations, but not information due to \"embarrassment, reputational harm, or political sensitivity.\"Add as a Reliable and Trusted News Source Add Now!\n (You can now subscribe to our Economic Times WhatsApp channel)\n\nRead More News onJeffrey Epstein filesCongress Epstein billJustice Department EpsteinEpstein investigation releasebipartisan support Epstein bill\n\n(Catch all the Business News, Breaking News and Latest News Updates on The Economic Times.)

In a rare and striking display of bipartisan unity, the House of Representatives approved the “Epstein Files Transparency Act” by an overwhelming margin of 427 to 1, followed almost immediately by a unanimous consent agreement in the Senate to pass the bill once officially transmitted. This action effectively sends the legislation directly to President Donald Trump’s desk, who has indicated he will sign it, bringing an end to months of political wrangling and public pressure.\nThe move marks the culmination of a months-long effort led by a small, bipartisan group of lawmakers who sought to circumvent opposition, which had included the President himself and House leadership who previously dismissed the focus on the files as a “hoax”. The critical turning point came when a discharge petition garnered the necessary signatures to force a vote, leading to a quick reversal of position by Republican leadership and the White House. The legislation’s passage demonstrates the immense pressure from the American public and, critically, from the survivors of Epstein’s horrific abuse, who have consistently lobbied Congress for full transparency and accountability.\nThe Act compels the Justice Department to make public all unclassified records, documents, communications, and investigative materials held by the Department, the FBI, and US Attorneys’ offices relating to the investigations and prosecutions of Epstein and his co-conspirator, Ghislaine Maxwell. The law requires this disclosure within 30 days of its enactment. Critically, while the Justice Department will be permitted to redact information that would compromise ongoing federal investigations or the personal details of victims, the bill explicitly prohibits the withholding of information based on concerns of “embarrassment, reputational harm, or political sensitivity”.\nThe unreleased files, which are reported to contain a massive trove of digital and physical evidence, including communications, bank records, and witness interviews, are highly anticipated by the public. While the Justice Department has previously stated that it found no “incriminating ‘client list'” or credible evidence of blackmail, the disclosure is expected to shed further light on the extent of Epstein’s operations and the identity of powerful individuals with whom he associated, who have thus far remained shielded from public scrutiny. For the survivors, the passing of the bill represents a watershed moment in their years-long quest for justice and a complete accounting of the criminal enterprise.","summary":"The 427-1 vote was

sentence.\n\nThen in 2019, Epstein was charged with ﻿running a network of underage girls for sex.\n\nHe was arrested but died by suicide in prison before going to trial﻿.\n\nOver the years, the US ﻿Justice Department collected countless documents and other pieces of evidence pertaining to these and other investigations into Epstein, including victim interview transcripts, items taken in raids, and photographs.\n\nUntil now, most of these documents have been kept from the public.﻿\n\nSome have been put into the public domain in the years since Epstein's death, either through official releases or leaks.\n\nSeveral of the released documents ﻿have mentioned Trump, including one email released this month in which Epstein wrote \"I know how dirty Donald is\".\n\nTrump has repeatedly downplayed his connection to Epstein.\n\nDOWNLOAD THE 9NEWS APP: Stay across all the latest in breaking news, sport, politics and the weather via our news app and get notifications sent straight to

As far as I’m concerned, he is a criminal. He seems to be taking bribes. His family is getting rich, and the people are getting poor. He’s protecting his friends and going after his enemies.\n\nWe used to have the rule of law. He does not think it applies to him. We have no allies that we had before, and now it seems as if we are friends with all the autocratic countries.\n\nOur judicial branch needs to rein him in, or Congress needs to impeach.\n\nTheresa McCullough\nPhiladelphia, Pennsylvania\n\nTragically, Trump takes\nlaw into his own hands\n\nA journalist recently asked President Trump about the legal authority to blow up Caribbean boats. He answered that authority comes from the fact that illegal drugs kill people in America.\n\nThis shows that Trump does not recognize sources of authority other than his own right hand.\n\nThe president made no mention of statutory law, constitutional law, international law, treaty agreements, the Supreme Court or rules of engagement, just his own peculiar brand of animal instinct. He must do it because “I alone can fix it.”\n\nDoes it matter that innocent people die in this Latin American manhunt? Nope. Does it matter that the American people and their elected representatives have no say in the new system of rule by the king of the jungle? Nope.\n\nIs it sad that nobody else but him is smart enough to get things done? Yes, it is very sad.\n\nKimball Shinkoskey\nWoods Cross, Utah \n\nFounders left clear\nrecord of thinking\n\nRe: “Keep mind reading off the Supreme Court” (Page A6, Oct. 30).\n\nAn Oct. 30 letter asserts that “you cannot read the minds of the dead.”\n\nHowever, we know exactly the thought processes of representatives to the 1787 Constitutional Convention. Their arguments were presented in detail in the contemporaneous pamphlet “The Federalist Papers,” authored by James Madison, Alexander Hamilton and John Jay, the first Chief Justice of the U.S. Supreme Court. The Federalist Papers used to be standard reading in high school U.S. history classes.\n\nFor those who cannot read, the musical “1776” — made into a movie (1972) — accurately presents the delegates’ pro and con arguments. Their astute remarks included:\n\nJohn Dickinson: Mr. Jefferson, are you suggesting we declare that an illegal rebellion is, in reality, a legal one?\n\nBenjamin Franklin: A rebellion is always legal in the first person, such as “our rebellion.” It is only in the third person — “their rebellion” — that it is illegal.\n\nDon’t like a comic strip?\nThen don’t read it.\n\nHere we go again.\n\nEvery few years, liberals get tired of the “Mallard Fillmore” comic strip and try to have it “retired” from the paper. Since I am a conservative living in this liberal state, I accept that I have no voice and no representation, especially in the Bay Area. The only reason I stay here is because of the fabulous weather. But I wish you liberals could be a little more tolerant.\n\nI cannot stand late-night talk show hosts who think they can be funny at the expense of conservatives. So I just do not watch. Why don’t you just let me enjoy this one comic that I think is funny, and so often right on? Simply quit reading it and then whining about it?\n\nOr maybe you enjoy being the schoolyard bully needing to get your way? It sure sounds like it.\n\nDavid Smith\n\nAI is powerful tool; we\nshouldn’t ban it\n\nDuring these recent days, AI has become a controversial topic, whether it is because students can use it for cheating or because it has the potential to substitute humans and replace human workers.\n\nHowever, there is something nobody mentions: AI is not going anywhere any time soon. It is one of those steps in human development where there is no going back. It is a powerful tool, but many schools have strict policies, and some go as far as to ban its use. But why ban it? AI is the future of humanity and a great tool. Instead of banning it, schools should demand more transparent use of it with clearer policies. Why not allow its use more openly for certain tasks?\n\nAt the beginning, teachers advocated for the ban of calculators, and now they are a must-have for math courses. Don’t ban AI.\n\nEduardo Campos","summary":"Also: OK with Trump &#124; Hurting vulnerable &#124; Tragic turn &#124; Clear record &#124; 'Mallard Fillmore' &#124; Don't ban AI.

He said receiving the news on Thursday, Nov. 6, was absolutely devastating for him and his coworkers.\n\n“One week, we were told, ‘Hey, we’re doing really, really well, we have permits for logs.’ Just the way they put it, we thought we were doing really well, that we were going to go from four shifts maybe back to five,” Taylor recalled. “Then, last week, we were all brought into the lunchroom, and I got to see the heartbreak on everyone’s faces. It was a devastating bombshell that came right out of the blue; it impacted everyone.\n\n“It’s pretty sad. After we heard the news, I could see the look on some people’s faces, the heartbreak. Some people just bought brand new houses, brand new trucks, broncos, toys, everything, and then we get this dropped on us.”\n\nComing home to his family that night was rough, Taylor said. He noted he called his wife after the news and almost broke down. His daughter, meanwhile, found out about the closure at work before he got a chance to tell her.\n\nAn employee of West Fraser for the last 15 years, Taylor said he’s been a jack of all trades for the company. He’s worked as a lumber grader, supervisor, stack operator and most recently bin attendant. Despite how it’s ending, Taylor said he still looks back on his time with West Fraser fondly.\n\nFor Taylor, the best part of working at the mill was the number of opportunities it provided him. He noted that 12 years in, he got the chance to become a supervisor, which had been a long-time goal of his. Traylor said the experience of learning how to lead a team was a rewarding one.\n\n“I would like to personally thank West Fraser for believing in me, giving me the opportunities I dreamt of. They’re a great company to work for,” Taylor remarked. “I love these guys, I love the people I work with, but it’s just a sad way to end it like this.”\n\nNow that he knows the mill is closing, Taylor said he and many of his co-workers are trying to figure out what’s next. Taylor said he’s considering trying to get a job at a mine or hibernating through the winter and trying to get a job on Enbridge’s upcoming Sunrise Expansion Project.\n\n“As for relocating, it’s probably last on my list, but if I can’t find anything around here, I’ll probably sit down with the wife and maybe talk about a potential relocation. I’ve spent three-quarters of my life here. I’m 42 years old, this is the place I thought I would retire,” Taylor said. “But, in a situation like this, I have to do what’s best for my family.”\n\nTaylor said he has talked with his coworkers about their plans in the past to get a sense of where their mentality was and what their Plan B was. For those who have been there for more than 40 years, he predicts they’ll just retire early. People like him, who still have families, will struggle with this change.\n\n“If I were 22, there are opportunities elsewhere. They always say the grass is greener on the other side. When I went through job to job like this before at a young age, it was no biggie, but 42 years old, it’s tough because we envisioned our careers at West Fraser,” Taylor remarked. “We’re trying to lift each other’s spirits up, but I can see deep down inside, I sense heartbreak and fear.”\n\nHe did note that West Fraser is working to come up with a list of jobs at other mills they could potentially transfer to. Taylor noted that some people are afraid that if they pack up and move to a new mill, this might just happen all over again.\n\n“There’s a lot of uncertainty,” Taylor summarized.\n\nBC Minister of Forests Ravi Parmar told the 100 Mile Free Press that the news of West Fraser’s closure was heartbreaking. He asserted that it is the result of United States President Donald Trump’s attack on B.C. Forestry Sector. In its statement announcing the closure, West Fraser alluded to tariffs and called the fibre available to their 100 Mile operations “uneconomical.”\n\n“Forest workers pay the price, pay cheques get impacted, and livelihoods get impacted. This is a big deal for the 160 workers, but this impacts not only those workers, but also the workers and people living in 100 Mile,” Parmar said.\n\nWhen asked how his ministry will be supporting workers on the ground in 100 Mile House, Parmar said they’ll have people on the ground who will connect with workers like Taylor about next steps. Parmar pledged the government would not “allow 100 Mile to go through this alone.” He also indicated he plans to visit the community himself in the future.\n\n“The Province of British Columbia will be there every step of the way to not only help during these challenging times, but also help restore confidence in the forest sector in 100 Mile House and the Cariboo,” Parmar remarked. “We’ll have more to share on that in the days and weeks ahead.”\n\nMayor Maureen Pinkney said the District of 100 Mile House is also ready to support workers in any way they can. She noted that the WorkBC Centre is a good place to start and that the district is updating its Path Forward booklet, originally written following the closure of the Norbord OSB Plant. She said they also plan to meet with ministers like Parmar and send letters to other levels of government.\n\nIn the short term, she said, members of the Jobs and Economic Development Group from the Ministry of Jobs and Economic Growth. They’ll be sitting down with workers to provide counselling and job training.\n\n“We’ve definitely been talking to the agencies that are going to be talking to the workers, and we’re happy to see there is a lot of support for the workers who are directly impacted,” Pinkney said. Hopefully, some of the contractors who didn’t work at the mill but worked very closely with them are also able to get into that assistance. Our main focus is on our community, the loss of taxation and getting replacement jobs for all those jobs.”","url":"https://campbellrivermirror.com/2025/11/18/millworkers-heartbroken-over-west-fraser-100-mile-lumber-closure/","image":"https://campbellrivermirror.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/11/40898772_web1_251113-OMH-West-Fraser_3.jpg?w=1024","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-11-19 00:30:00","author":"None","authors":["None"],"language":"en","source_country":"ca","sentiment":-0.043}]}
