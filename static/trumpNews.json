A smaller fighter with superior inner balance and core strength can overcome a larger opponent. As China faces an escalating economic war with the United States, this ancient wisdom also applies.\nBeijing is not eager to negotiate and is not under any illusion that the tariff war with Donald Trump’s America will end soon. The Chinese leadership now recognises that unlike the trade disputes of Trump’s first term, America’s strategic goal now is not merely trade rebalancing but the systematic strangling of China’s economic rise.\nIf narrowing the trade deficit were the US objective, the solution would be easy. The United States does have products that China is eager to buy. Semiconductors, cars and machinery have long been key American exports to China.\nIn 2022, semiconductor sales reached US$12.1 billion, making China the biggest buyer of US chips, accounting for a quarter of America’s total exports in that sector. But rather than capitalising on this demand, the US has moved in the opposite direction – imposing increasingly strict export controls, particularly on advanced technology. By 2023, semiconductor exports to China had already dropped to US$10.2 billion, a direct consequence of Washington’s restrictions.\nChina is digging in for a long fight. In the near term, it could use fiscal stimulus to mitigate the impact and buy time. But the real key is for it to resolve its own economic weaknesses. Chief among them, I believe, is the fragmentation of China’s domestic market.\n\nTo understand this, let’s go back some 16 years ago.\nIn 2009, China was hit by the global financial crisis as export demand nosedived. In Gongan county in Hubei province, authorities were desperate to prop up the area’s tobacco industry so they mandated that all public employees must smoke local cigarettes or face fines. Teachers and civil servants were assigned monthly quotas, while shops were barred from selling rival brands. Inspectors even sifted through ashtrays in public buildings, penalising the person in charge if non-local cigarette butts were found. The policy, though swiftly revoked after public outrage, epitomised the extremes of local protectionism.\nGongan was not an outlier. In 2006, nearby Hanchuan county ordered bureaucrats to consume locally produced liquor to support its economy. The target was so absurd that one office found they had to down three bottles a day to meet the target. These cases, reported by People’s Daily and others, reveal a systemic flaw: despite China’s highly centralised governance, its internal market is Balkanised by provincial barriers. Local officials, incentivised to prioritise GDP growth, erected an invisible trade wall by imposing surcharges, blocking outside competitors, and distorting the market. It was a form of domestic tariff.\nThe costs of such action are staggering. Domestic logistics costs are about 14 per cent of China’s GDP, nearly double the global average, according to the China Federation of Logistics and Purchasing. Agricultural shipments crossing provincial borders face up to five clearance checks, with spoilage rates reaching 30 per cent – six times higher than in the US, according to the World Bank. The State Council’s Development Research Centre estimates that these internal barriers cost China 3-5 per cent of GDP annually. By comparison, Trump’s tariffs, while aggressive, are estimated to shave at most 2.4 per cent off China’s GDP, according to Goldman Sachs.\n\nRecognising this vulnerability, Beijing launched the “National Unified Market Initiative” in 2022, explicitly framing it as a defence against external shocks. The goal is audacious: dismantle local fiefdoms, streamline regulations, and fuse China’s 31 provinces into a seamless economic bloc. Progress has been uneven, with entrenched interests resisting reforms. But the US trade offensive may ironically give the impetus needed to break the deadlock.\nFor China, the path forward hinges on two fronts. First, fiscal stimulus can cushion short-term blows. Second, the unified market, if fully realised, could unleash productivity gains dwarfing the impact of overseas tariffs. Imagine the competitive edge if logistics costs halved, or if start-ups could scale nationwide without having to navigate a labyrinth of local rules.\nHistory shows that China often reforms fastest when backed into a corner. The trade war, while painful, may accelerate the demise of inefficiencies that have long plagued its economy. As Friedrich Nietzsche said: “What does not kill me makes me stronger.” For Beijing, the ultimate victory lies not in out-tariffing Washington but in emerging leaner, more self-sufficient, and resilient – a lesson as old as Chinese martial arts itself.\nThe road ahead is fraught, but if local protectionism falls, Trump’s tariffs may inadvertently achieve what decades of internal lobbying could not: a truly unified Chinese market, capable of turning external pressure into unshakeable strength.","summary":"The trade war may be painful but it could be just what the country needs to bring down domestic barriers to growth.","url":"https://www.scmp.com/news/china/diplomacy/article/3307226/could-trumps-tariffs-make-china-faster-leaner-and-stronger","image":"https://cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2025/04/20/20448deb-538b-489d-a458-a9607ecec742_9777a87c.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-21 01:00:15","author":"Chow Chung-yan","authors":["Chow Chung-yan"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"cn","sentiment":-0.207},{"id":313096484,"title":"New York City ignores federal deadline to end congestion pricing","text":"April 20 (UPI) -- New York City's $9 congestion pricing fee for people driving in certain parts of the city will remain, passing a federal deadline Sunday to end it.\n\n\"The program is working,\" N.Y.

Hochul and the Metropolitan Transit Authority have both said the cameras will stay on and the toll program in place until a judge rules otherwise.\n\nPricing congestion has already sidestepped a number of federal mandates and deadlines. The plan went into effect on Jan. 5.

Yemen attack details with family","text":"US Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth reportedly shared details of a March attack on Yemen's Iran-aligned Houthis with his wife, brother and personal lawyers, a month after revelations a US magazine editor was accidentally added to defence group chats. \n\nThe New York Times, which broke the story, cited four sources familiar with the message group who said that second chat included details of the schedule of the air strikes.\n\nAccording to the report, the trio received the same details that were revealed last month by a US magazine editor who was accidentally included in a group chat that contained US President Donald Trump's national security team. \n\nMr Hegseth's brother Phil and his lawyer Tim Parlatore both have jobs in the Pentagon though their titles vary. \n\nMr Hegseth's brother is a senior adviser to the secretary for the Department of Homeland Security and a liaison officer in the Defense Department while Mr Parlatore's Linkedin's account says he is a US Navy Reserve commander at the Secretary of Defense office. \n\nThe reports about the second chat were separately confirmed by CNN, which said the leaks had created concern about the secretary's judgement — including from his former press secretary John Ullyot. \n\n“It’s been a month of total chaos at the Pentagon,\" Mr Ullyot said in a statement obtained by CNN.\n\n\"From leaks of sensitive operational plans to mass firings, the dysfunction is now a major distraction for the president — who deserves better from his senior leadership.\" \n\nThe Atlantic's editor-in-chief, Jeffrey Goldberg, said he was added to a chat on the Signal messaging app on March 13.\n\nA day after Goldberg was added, the group began sharing information about plans for a military operation against the Iran-aligned Houthi rebel group.\n\nMeanwhile, Mr Hegseth's wife Jennifer, a former Fox News producer, has attended sensitive meetings with foreign military counterparts, the Wall Street Journal has reported. \n\nSenate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer responded to the revelations, saying Mr Hegseth \"must be fired\". \n\n\"The details keep coming out,\" he wrote on X. \n\nThe news came after one of Mr Hegseth's leading advisers, Dan Caldwell, was escorted from the Pentagon after being identified during an investigation into leaks at the US Department of Defense.\n\nMr Caldwell was placed on administrative leave for \"an unauthorised disclosure\", a US official told Reuters last week. \n\nFollowing Mr Caldwell's departure, Mr Hegseth's deputy chief of staff Darin Selnick was also put on administrative leave, officials said.\n\nThe Pentagon was not immediately available for comment for Reuters. \n\nReuters/ABC","summary":"A month after sharing

Hegseth said to have been included on Signal chat about Yemen attack?","text":"Defense secretary Pete Hegseth’s “Signalgate” has reared its head again after a new bombshell report that he shared details of a U.S. military strike on Yemen in a second group chat.\n\nThis time, Hegseth is in hot water for reportedly adding his wife Jennifer Rauchet, brother Phil, and personal attorney Tim Parlatore, to a second Signal group where details about upcoming military strikes aimed at the Houthis were discussed, according to the New York Times.\n\nDetails, including flight schedules for the warplanes involved, were shared by Hegseth in the group chat on March 15, the newspaper reports. \n\nWhile a U.S. official told the Times that Hegseth did not share any classified information in the second group chat, reportedly accessed by the defense secretary on his private phone, he is already facing calls to resign from the Democrats. \n\nThe Independent has contacted the Pentagon for comment.\n\nIt is not clear why Hegseth’s wife, who has also accompanied him on meetings with foreign military officials, would need to know about upcoming military strikes. \n\nHegseth often refers to Rauchet as his “rock” and the pair often gush about one another on their social media accounts. \n\n“I’ve missed him, but great to watch my husband visiting friends on the other side of the world,” Rauchet wrote about Hegseth in an Instagram post three weeks ago. “He loves this country and all the men and women who serve it everywhere.”\n\n“Grateful to have my incredible wife @jennycdot by my side for our first international trip,” Hegseth wrote about his wife ahead of his first overseas trip since being sworn into office.\n\nThe couple met while they both worked at Fox News where he was a co-host of Fox & Friends Weekend and she was working for the network as a producer.\n\nThey wed in 2019 at Trump National Golf Club in Colts Neck, New Jersey. Before their wedding, they were both pictured at the club wearing red “Make Weddings Great Again” hats, resembling President Donald Trump’s signature MAGA baseball cap.\n\nRauchet is Hegseth’s third wife and he has a 7-year-old daughter with her. They both have three children each from previous relationships. \n\nIn a recent appreciation post, Hegseth also referred to Rauchet as his “valentine.” \n\nBefore Rauchet, Hegseth split from his first wife, Meredith Schwarz, in 2009, and divorced his second wife, Samantha Deering, in 2017. \n\nRauchet recently raised eyebrows after it emerged she accompanied Hegseth at two meetings with foreign military officials where sensitive information was discussed, the Wall Street Journal reported. \n\nShe was said to have been present at a March 6 meeting at the Pentagon with Britain’s Secretary of Defence John Healy and Admiral Tony Radakin, head of the U.K. armed forces.\n\nThe meeting came at an especially sensitive moment — the day after the U.S. said it had cut off military intelligence sharing with Ukraine — and discussions included the rationale for the decision and future military collaboration.\n\nThe defense secretary’s wife was also at a meeting in February at the headquarters of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization in Brussels, the Journal reports, citing two people who attended.\n\nIt is not known if her presence had an impact on what was discussed at either meeting.\n\nRauchet stood by Hegseth ahead of his turbulent Senate confirmation process, where he was grilled over allegations of a sexual assault dating back to 2017. He denies the allegation and insists the encounter was consensual.\n\nA woman filed a police report alleging that Hegseth sexually assaulted her during a Republican women’s conference in Monterey, California in 2017, where he was the keynote speaker. The woman said she believed that she had possibly been drugged and raped.\n\nCharges were never filed in the case. Hegseth paid a nondisclosure settlement with her.\n\n“They won’t stop with Pete. It’s not him they’re after. It’s your values. We won’t back down,” Rauchet wrote in a social media post in early December, when reports of Hegseth’s alleged past were dominating headlines. \n\n“We have only just begun to fight,” Rauchet also wrote in a post at the end of November last year after Trump named Hegseth as his choice to lead the Pentagon.\n\nAdditional reporting by Oliver O’Connell","summary":"Hegseth often refers to Rauchet as his ‘rock’ and recently raised eyebrows when he brought her along to two meetings with foreign military officials","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/pete-hegseth-wife-jennifer-rauchet-b2736509.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/04/21/0/03/U-S--Vice-President-J-D--Vance-and-Jennifer-Rauchet.jpeg?width=1200&height=800&crop=1200:800","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/2lJT4n8B-4VHSaSK0.mp4","publish_date":"2025-04-21 00:57:53","author":"Rhian Lubin","authors":["Rhian Lubin"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":0.214},{"id":313097118,"title":"Nepo baby reveals incredible weight loss in rare outing with his famous family","text":"Black Friday\n\nKim Kardashian\n\nVictoria Beckham\n\nHarry Styles\n\nAmanda Holden\n\nBritain's Got Talent\n\nPrivacy Policy\n\nMonday, Apr 21st 2025\n\n5-Day Forecast\n\nAdvertisement\n\n'I will cause you misery': Jail for stalker who styled herself on horror film obsessive and targeted male nurse with whom she was infatuated\n\nElizabeth Hurley and Billy Ray Cyrus debut SHOCK new romance with sweet PDA picture\n\nSir Keir Starmer under mounting pressure to publicly back Supreme Court gender ruling on what a woman is after five days of silence - amid growing concerns about plotting by his own ministers to defy the landmark judgement\n\nI was a CIA agent.

He tweeted about Mueller seven times within three hours, addressing the special counsel’s report on Russian interference in the 2016 elections.\n\n“Despite No Collusion, No Obstruction, The Radical Left Democrats do not want to go on to Legislate for the good of the people, but only to Investigate and waste time. This is costing our Country greatly, and will cost the Dems big time in 2020!” Trump said at the time.","summary":"AFP via Getty ImagesPresident Donald Trump had a lot to get off his chest on Easter Sunday.\n\nTrump went on another spiteful Truth Social posting spree as he skipped church to spend Sunday at his Virginia golf club after attending an Easter service at the White House.\n\nThe president posted over 20 times in the span of nine hours, taking aim at “radical left lunatics,” China, critics of his chaotic tariffs, and a federal judge who stopped his deportations of Venezuelan migrants.\n\nRead more at The Daily Beast.","url":"https://www.thedailybeast.com/trump-skips-church-and-goes-on-unhinged-easter-posting-spree-instead/","image":"https://www.thedailybeast.com/resizer/v2/5Q6LDBDOVRBOLKGWFZFSJVOS4A.jpg?smart=true&auth=7f609a16d205fd53680ffff11f498045960e53fa15a436d2567607c70224e41d&width=1440&height=1080","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-21 00:50:19","author":"Julia Ornedo","authors":["Julia Ornedo"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.055},{"id":313095024,"title":"Trump’s global trade war hangs over Vance’s India visit","text":"U.S. Vice President JD Vance’s visit to India beginning Monday takes place against the backdrop of a global trade war that President Donald Trump sparked, but the cross-country tour also offers both political and personal significance for the vice president.Vance arrives Monday as the U.S. is threatening to increase the 10% tariffs on Indian exports to 26% if no deal is reached by the end of the 90-day pause Trump put in place earlier this month.Prime Minister Narendra Modi is slated to host Vance for a bilateral meeting, the White House said.

Or were you SILENCED?' which originally was featured in her interview of Meghan Markle\n\nHowever, one fan noted that, although her microphone was definitely on, she still needed the cushioning of the backing track due to how much dancing she was doing. \nBut after averting one crisis, Megan's show ended on a sour note. \nAfter she had finished her popular song Bil Ole Freak, Megan appeared to be about to launch into another tune, Mamushi. \n\n Sober Cara Delevingne unveils dramatic transformation at Coachella after overcoming addiction \nThe massive LED screens were reportedly cued up for the song, and viewers at home could hear the start of the backing track for the song. \nHowever, people in the audience at Coachella heard none of that, as the speakers were turned off around 9:27 p.m., around two minutes after her scheduled end time, according to SFGate. \nMegan's microphone also appeared to have cut off, and the visuals for Mamushi were replaced on the screens by a camera feed of the stage. \nMegan reportedly vented her frustrations into her microphone, which went unheard at the festival but did make it through to livestream viewers. \n'Don't y'all do the hotties like that,' she reportedly cried out, adding, 'Run Mamushi back for the motherf***ing hotties.' Megan finally gave up, declaring, 'B****, they said we gotta go!' \nBut Megan still silently ran through the choreography for the song for around a minute, before she took a bow and said farewell to the audience, which was also not heard. \n'The sound out. Damn, they turned off Megan Thee Stallion mic out! Damn, she didn't even do an hour&it got AWKWARD throwing us off silencing her,' one furious fan wrote on X. \nOn Reddit, a user posted a meme of Oprah Winfrey asking 'Were you silent? Or were you SILENCED?' which originally was featured in her interview of Meghan Markle.\nMegan Thee Stallion was followed by closing headliner Post Malone, who reportedly took the stage around 10:25 p.m. \nMegan Thee StallionCaliforniaJustin Bieber\n\nShare or comment on this article: \nMegan Thee Stallion parties with Justin Bieber as she shows off her assets in sizzling Coachella week two look\n\nAdd comment\n\n Share what you think\n\nWorst rated\n\nThe comments below have not been moderated.\n\nThe views expressed in the contents above are those of our users and do not necessarily reflect the views of MailOnline.\n\nAdd your comment\n\nEnter your comment\n\nBy posting your comment you agree to our house rules.\n\nSubmit Comment\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual.\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual\n\nWe will automatically post your comment and a link to the news story to your Facebook timeline at the same time it is posted on MailOnline.

But, on the face of it, Lucy Connolly appears very far removed from anybody’s idea of a thuggish jailbird.\n\nUntil recently, the 42-year-old childminder lived a pretty unremarkable life. Each morning, toddlers would be dropped off at her pleasant 1930s semi on a tree-lined Northampton avenue and she would watch over them as they played in the garden.\n\nMarried to Ray, a Conservative member of West Northamptonshire Council, the couple have a 12-year-old daughter – a keen golfer – and enjoy walks with their dog, Harley, a German pointer.\n\nNeighbours last week sung their praises while a friend of Connolly’s told the Mail that she was ‘loved’ by the children in her charge.\n\nThey were also known to have had their comfortable suburban life pierced by scarcely imaginable tragedy.\n\nIn 2011, they lost their 19-month-old son, Harry. He was found lifeless in bed after they were sent home from Northampton General Hospital, later prompting a fulsome apology after a coroner identified failings in his care. He died of dehydration and acute kidney failure after suffering from an inflammation of the colon, which had not been detected. \n\nConnolly was left with PTSD. Not wishing for his death to be in vain, she helped to set up a charity, Mother’s Instinct, which campaigned for clinicians to listen more carefully to parents’ fears over the health of their children.\n\nAgainst this backdrop, it is difficult to believe just how different Connolly’s life is today to what it was just a few months ago.\n\nNow, she is a prisoner.\n\nAs you may already know, in October, Connolly was sentenced to two years and seven months in prison for a post on X (formerly known as Twitter), hastily written in the aftermath of the sickening murders of children in Southport, Merseyside, at a Taylor Swift-themed dance class.\n\nThe undoubtedly vile missive, targeted at illegal migrants after false information spread in the wake of the murders claimed killer Axel Rudukabana was in the country illegally – he was in fact born in Cardiff to parents from Rwanda – said that people should ‘set fire to all the f*****g hotels full of the bastards for all I care.’\n\nAn abhorrent sentiment? Clearly. Racist? Definitely. Indeed, Connolly pleaded guilty to publishing threatening or abusive material intending to stir up racial hatred.\n\nBut the length of her sentence, which has seen her locked up alongside murderers, drug dealers and thieves, has in recent days been criticised by former prime ministers, the leader of the Conservative Party and a former home secretary for being unduly harsh. Even Elon Musk, who is advising President Donald Trump, has waded in.\n\nIt has been held up as an example of so-called ‘two-tier policing’, with theories abounding, particularly on social media, that the white working-class and those on the right-wing are dealt with more harshly than others.\n\nSo how did this suburban childminder find herself serving a 31-month prison sentence? And does the punishment fit the crime?\n\nBy July of last year, it was clear that there were two sides to Connolly. One was the outwardly pleasant brunette; the ‘councillor’s wife’.\n\nThe other was ‘Lucie’. Using a slightly alternated spelling of her real name, Mrs Connolly was posting regularly to more than 9,000 followers on X. In fact, it would appear that she had become somewhat obsessed with the dopamine-inducing buzz which can be garnered from popularity on social media.\n\nAnalysis by the Mail found that between December 2023 and August last year she was posting an average of 3,000 tweets each month – around 100 every day.\n\nSeemingly enjoying her self-appointed role as a right-wing rabble rouser, Connolly would post regular diatribes attacking immigrants, the Labour government, Islam or ‘thick’ people she referred to by a word unprintable in a family newspaper.\n\nShe hit out against Channel migrants, who she called ‘illegal boat invaders’, saying they were ‘mostly criminals from third world countries.’\n\nAnd after a pleasant holiday in Romania she told her followers that one of the main benefits was that it was ‘not full of illegals.’\n\nHer thoughts were seemingly backed and even encouraged by her followers on X, which – particularly since it was purchased by billionaire Tesla boss Musk and sacked moderators – has become a worrying echo chamber for such rage-filled sentiments.\n\nHer behaviour begged the question: while one might have legitimate concerns about illegal immigration – with Connolly particularly angered about people ‘arriving in Britain with no background checks’, according to a friend – why feel it necessary to share such thoughts to a public platform in distinctly unprofessional language? At best, it is ill-advised. With hindsight, it appears stupid and, often, deliberately nasty.\n\nShe is being supported in her appeal against her sentence – to be heard next month – by the Free Speech Union. But as Frank Ferguson, of the Crown Prosecution Service, said when she was sentenced: ‘It is not an offence to have strong or differing political views, but it is an offence to incite racial hatred.’\n\nIt was into this dangerous online world she was inhabiting, on July 29 last year, that Connolly made one post which would change her life forever.\n\nThat day, Rudakubana stabbed 13 people in Southport, including eight children. Elsie Dot Stancombe, seven, Bebe King, six, and Alice Da Silva Aguiar, nine, died following the attack.\n\nFalse rumours swirled that Rudukabana was an illegal migrant.\n\nInto this maelstrom, ‘Lucie’ posted: ‘Mass deportation now, set fire to all the f*****g hotels full of the bastards for all I care, while you’re at it take the treacherous government and politicians with them.\n\n‘I feel physically sick knowing what these families will now have to endure. If that makes me racist so be it.’\n\nAs we now know – but unbeknown to Connolly at the time of her post – angry men from across the country would indeed attempt to take the law into their own hands.\n\nRealising her hot-headedness after she calmed down while out walking the family dog that evening, Connolly deleted her post within four hours. But by that time it had already been viewed 310,000 times.\n\nIn the ensuing riots which followed the Southport murders, hotels housing asylum seekers were indeed targeted by arsonists. Police were attacked. Migrants were vilified in the streets.\n\nAnd as the government attempted to crack down on the protests, harsh, deterrent sentences were handed down to anybody seen to be inciting the violence.\n\nRealising that she may face punishment for her comments, Connolly told friends that she would 'play the mental health card' if arrested. \n\nOn August 12 last year – two weeks after her original post – Connolly appeared at Northampton Crown Court. Despite having no previous convictions, she was denied bail and remanded in custody.\n\nIn October, she received that lengthy prison sentence.\n\nIn an interview with The Daily Telegraph, Mr Connolly revealed that his wife had been denied release on temporary licence, possibly over concerns about public and media interest in her case.\n\nLast week, former Prime Minister Boris Johnson waded into the debate, telling the Mail that Connolly’s 31-month sentence does ‘huge damage to this country’s global reputation as a haven for free expression’.\n\nShe has been eligible for release on temporary licence since November, which allows for up to two overnight home stays each month.\n\nMr Connolly is suffering from bone marrow failure and their daughter’s behaviour is said to have deteriorated at school – points raised by Connolly in her request for temporary release.\n\nHowever the Prison Service has indicated that a risk assessment still needs to be carried out to assess Connolly’s suitability for temporary release the program. She is eligible for release from prison after serving 40 per cent of her sentence in custody.\n\nIan Acheson, a former prison governor and government advisor on extremism in prisons told the Mail it was ‘inexplicable’ her release on temporary licence had been delayed.\n\n‘In my opinion, the tweet was racist,’ he said. ‘It was malignant and dangerous. However, I think she has been exceptionally hard done by.’\n\nHe added: ‘She has complied with her sentence so why is she being delayed for temporary release?\n\n‘There is no evidence she poses further risk. It isn’t her fault [that there is media interest in the case] and shouldn’t be relevant anyway.\n\n‘It feels to me a little bit like someone has their thumb on the scales here.’\n\nMr Acheson said such treatment does little to dispel allegations of ‘two-tier justice’.\n\n‘People will draw conclusions, not unreasonable conclusions, that we have a justice system that will hit low-hanging fruit but will shy away from the more difficult identity-connected offences,’ he said.\n\n‘If you look at far-Right and neo-Fascist groups, that narrative is being talked up and we are providing more ammunition for that.\n\n‘White working-class Britain is being radicalised by what they perceive is behind decision-making in the criminal justice system. This is truly dangerous for community cohesion. The government must address this trust deficit, not simply traduce it as ignorance or bigotry.’\n\nThe most obvious criticism levelled at the length of Connolly’s sentence is the apparent disparity between her punitive treatment and lesser sentences handed to, on the face of it, more serious offenders.\n\nSentencing her, Judge Melbourne Inman KC drew a direct link between her post and the mindless violence which engulfed Britain last summer.\n\n‘As everyone is aware, some people used that tragedy [Southport] as an opportunity to sow division and hatred, often using social media, leading to a number of towns and cities being disfigured by mindless and racist violence, intimidation and damage,’ he said.\n\nBut conversely, a month before Connolly’s sentence, the same judge sentenced a teenager who attempted to storm a pub he wrongly believed to contain members of a far-Right group to 20 months – significantly less than Connolly’s sentence.\n\nTerrified customers barricaded themselves inside the Clumsy Swan pub in the Yardley area of Birmingham as Haris Ghaffar, 19, and others wearing balaclavas and carrying knives, tried to get inside, believing that it was housing members of the English Defence League [EDL]. Ghaffar pleaded guilty to violent disorder.\n\nCrucially, Connolly’s sentence was aggravated by the racial element to which she pleaded guilty – with her husband claiming she only did so to speed up the process, believing she could be held on remand in prison for months awaiting trial if she pleaded not guilty and she wanted to get home quickly for her daughter.\n\nSimilarly, in August, David Engleby, 29, was jailed for two years and four months for taking part in a riot close to Southport’s mosque the day after the murders of the little girls. Video footage played at Liverpool Crown Court showed Engleby and two others, who also received lesser sentences than Mrs Connolly, throwing missiles at police and chanting anti-Islamic slogans.\n\nAway from the riots, in August, 26-year-old Bradley Kynaston, of Wakefield, Yorks, avoided an immediate jail term despite breaking his ex-partner’s arm in an assault.\n\nKynaston was sentenced to 16 months in prison, suspended for two years. Even for sexual assaults, suspended sentences are relatively commonplace.\n\nBut the severe sentences handed down to Connolly and others like her – Julie Sweeney, who called for a mosque to be ‘blown up with the adults inside, was jailed for 15 months in August – undoubtedly succeeded as deterrents.\n\nAs the jail sentences stacked up and Sir Keir Starmer talked tough, the rioting eventually stopped. It was plain to even mindless thugs that such mindless thuggery was not worth a lengthy prison stretch.\n\nIndeed, legal experts have claimed her sentence was just in the circumstances.\n\nOne eminent professional said: ‘It is at the top end of what she might have expected but if you send out tweets calling for hotels to be burned down that is quite serious incitement [to violence].’\n\nAnother troubling issue about Connolly’s case is that, last year, the government released thousands of prisoners early to ease overcrowding. Lags convicted of offences including grievous bodily harm and kidnap lauded Sir Keir Starmer for the early-release scheme and were pictured celebrating and clambering into waiting Bentleys and BMWs.\n\nAt their home in Northampton last week, Mr Connolly refused to go into detail about his wife’s current situation, telling the Mail: ‘There’s so much misinformation out there related to Lucy.\n\n‘She’s been vilified and she’s still in prison, that’s all I’ve got to say.’\n\nBut friends and neighbours rallied round the childminder, claiming her sentence was completely disproportionate and that her mindset was affected when she heard of murdered children having lost her own son in tragic circumstances.\n\nAdelle Healy, 42, who has been friends with Connolly for nine years, said: ‘Lucy was horrified and heartbroken that three little girls had been murdered.\n\n‘She let her emotions take over and wrote something that she definitely shouldn’t have done but she has paid a very dear price.\n\n‘She should not be behind bars for a Tweet. I think it’s ludicrous that it’s got to this point. ‘\n\nMs Healy, who works in admin for a car insurance company added: ‘Lucy has forthright opinions and sometimes they can upset people but a lot of her anger is aimed at the government, particularly with unvetted immigration.\n\n‘She was worried about the large number of people arriving in Britain without any background checks. She believes they could pose a threat to national security and a risk to children.\n\n‘As a childminder… all the kids loved her - no matter their background - because she was just so caring and gave a lot back.’\n\nNeighbour Lisa Pitcher, 53, said: ‘Lucy should never have been put inside - not when you have rapists out on bail - and the fact she’s been denied temporary leave is disgusting.\n\n‘She should never have tweeted what she did. She knew that, which is why she deleted it four hours later.\n\n‘I think she reacted with uncontrolled anger when those three little girls were murdered because it brought back awful memories. She knows the pain and heartache of losing a child.’\n\nMs Pitcher added that Connolly has ‘has forthright views on things’ and is ‘not shy about speaking her mind and sometimes these strong opinions upset people.’\n\nShe added: ‘The tweet she was jailed for was wrong and sent in the heat of the moment. She didn’t stop and think. I think her case shames the British judicial system and I think it is political.’\n\nMaking her point, she referenced the recent case of former Labour MP Mike Amesbury, who received a 10-week prison sentence for assault after he punched a constituent, later downgraded to a suspended sentence following an appeal.\n\n‘He actually physically assaulted someone - he did real harm. But it’s one rule for one and one for another,’ she claimed.\n\nFollowing the backlash to her offending post, Connolly hastily typed up an apology where she said she was ‘overwhelmed’ by the ‘similarity between those beautiful children who were brutally attacked and my own daughter’.\n\nShe said she had mistakenly acted on information about the attacker’s identity that she ‘now knows to be false and malicious’.\n\nShe added that she ‘should not have expressed that horror in the way I did.’\n\n‘This has been a valuable lesson for me, in realising how wrong and inaccurate things appearing on social media can be, and I will never react in this way again,’ she said.\n\nConnolly had little time to learn the lesson from her mistake, as she was swiftly arrested and her X account was deleted. For at least a little while longer, she will continue to contemplate her mistakes from the confines of a prison cell.","summary":"The jail term imposed on a childminder has been held up as an example of so-called 'two-tier policing'.

Kate Osborne, a Labour MP and former member of the women and equalities select committee, asked Hoyle to mirror John Bercow's previous decision to block Trump.\n\nIn a letter seen by The Times, she wrote: 'I am asking you as the Speaker to agree it would be inappropriate and mirror the previous Speaker's recommendation.\n\n'It is up to our government to decide if they use the state visit to engage with Trump on a wide range of issues as above but that does not translate to giving him the honour of addressing parliament. The risk of low attendance could also have negative or unintended consequences.'\n\nAnother Labour MP said: 'Parliament has nothing to learn from a serial liar, cheat, womaniser and bankrupt. We don't need Trump to lecture and dictate his unilateral terms to our elected representatives.'\n\nThis campaign comes days after Trump told reporters in the Oval Office he 'was invited by the King and the great country' who are doing a 'second fest' which will be 'beautiful'.\n\nHe said: 'It is the second time is has happened to one person. The reason is we have two separate terms and it's an honour to be a friend of King Charles and the family, William.'\n\nMr Trump added: 'I think they are setting a date for September. I don't know how it can be bigger than the last one. The last one was incredible but they say the next one will be even more important.'\n\nLabour MPs have sought to avoid criticising the US president openly to avoid making Starmer's job harder as he seeks to keep Trump on side in trade negotiations.\n\nGovernment sources said the UK was pressing to get a deal as soon as possible, and was 'desperate' to do so before May 19.\n\nThe date has been pencilled in as a big moment in Starmer's 'EU reset', when he will host Ursula von der Leyen, president of the European Commission.\n\nA government insider said: 'Trump hates the EU, so we're desperate to get a deal with him locked in before what will inevitably be a love-in with Brussels.'\n\nSome 75 Labour MPs backed a campaign to block the US president from addressing parliament during his first term.\n\nAn early day motion in 2019 was signed by several foreign office ministers, as well as those now in the cabinet.\n\nThey include Wes Streeting, the health secretary; Jo Stevens, the Welsh secretary; Lucy Powell, leader of the Commons; and Ellie Reeves, chairwoman of the Labour party.\n\nIn 2011, both houses of parliament invited Obama to address an audience of hundreds in Westminster Hall. Standing at a lectern in front of a red carpet, he was watched on by then prime minister David Cameron, and his predecessors Tony Blair, Gordon Brown and Sir John Major.\n\nThe three 'keyholders' of Westminster Hall, where foreign leaders usually address Parliament, are the Commons Speaker, the Lord Speaker and the Lord Great Chamberlain, who is represented by Black Rod.\n\nAll three have to agree for a visit to take place, after a request is made by the Government.\n\nSenior sources confirmed to The Mail on Sunday in February that this time both the Lord Speaker and Commons Speaker would welcome a visit. \n\nIn 2023, President Zelensky of Ukraine gave a speech in Westminster Hall about the Russian invasion.\n\nThere have been 80 addresses to members of both Houses of Parliament since 1935.\n\nEleven of these were from the monarch but most have been foreign leaders.

Pakistan has enough deposits of critical minerals to be a big economic player in its own right, says analyst Asim Sajjad Akhtar.\n\nThe optimism is further strengthened by the government’s emphasis on exporting semi-finished and finished mineral products rather than shipping raw materials abroad. No less than 16 memorandums of understanding and strategic agreements were stated to have been signed with national and international public and private sector partners. Worldwide experience, however, shows that it takes years of project development before cash starts flowing in the mining sector.\n\nA Dawn editorial cautions that the agreements should be transparent and based on assessing the true value of the deposits. If the country is to truly benefit from its mineral wealth, it is also crucial to ensure that the policy and subsequent contracts under it cover the entire mineral value chain: the extraction of minerals to local processing and refining for production of the finished products for export.\n\n The real challenge in transforming the mineral sector into a cornerstone of economic self-reliance lies in the business environment\n\nThe mineral sector currently contributes only about 3.2 per cent to Pakistan’s GDP. The real challenge in transforming it into a cornerstone of economic self-reliance lies in the business environment, says analyst Durdana Najam.\n\nFurthermore, analysts at Dawn emphasise that it must be ensured that the people of Balochistan and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa are given first priority in jobs and that the proceeds from the subsequent projects are spent on the welfare of the people. Unless the financial benefits accruing from the mineral projects are directed for the development of the province and its population, the perception, partly creating Baloch unrest, that the province’s resources are being used for the rest of the country rather than for Balochistan’s economic development, will not go away.\n\nOn April 10, Muzzammil Aslam, adviser to the KP chief minister, ruled out the possibility of giving control of mines and minerals to the federal government.\n\nWhile pursuing a realistic mineral mine and policy framework, Pakistan must also keep in mind that US President Donald Trump’s tariff policy, to quote development policy thought leader Haroon Sharif, has only served to accelerate moves to a new economic order that will shape the contours of the global order and politics.\n\nPakistan will soon have a comprehensive, robust industrial policy that fosters export-led industrialisation, reduces import dependence and builds foreign exchange reserves, says Haroon Akhtar Khan, the prime minister’s special assistant for industries and production. \n\nMoreover, the government accords the highest priority to increasing water storage and adding clean, green, and economically affordable hydel electricity to the national grid for providing cheaper electricity to the consumers and stabilising the national economy, Federal Minister for Water Resources Muha-mmad Moeen Wattoo told Water and Power Development Aut-h-ority (Wa-p-da) officials in a recent meeting.\n\nMr Wattoo expected Wapda to complete its projects on time. The Dasu Hydropower Project’s (Stage-1) estimated cost has ballooned from Rs479 billion in 2014 — with an original completion target of December 2019 — to Rs1.74 trillion, with the new completion date pushed to November 2028. Despite years of planning for this project, land acquisition and resettlement remain incomplete, according to the Public Accounts Committee (PAC), which on April 15 also highlighted the glaring inefficiencies and massive financial mismanagement in key national hydropower projects. PAC also expressed concern over changes in the scope of the Dasu Project that had led to a significant increase in contract cost.\n\nThe Wapda officials informed the meeting that the projects under construction scheduled for completion in a phased manner from 2026 to 2030 will double the hydel generation from 9,500 MW to 19,500 MW with the addition of about 10,000 MW of clean, green and low-cost hydel electricity to the national grid.\n\nHowever, there is also a strong need and opportunity to step up the building of small dams that have proven effective for poverty alleviation and can be completed in a much shorter time with much smaller investments.\n\nA statement by the KP government said in July 2024 that 30 more small dams would be completed soon at a cost of Rs43.6bn. Chief Minister Ali Amin Gandapur has directed relevant officials to accelerate work on small dams and directed the treasury department to release the required funds. He also ordered the appointment of two more directors and other staff to enhance the capabilities of small dams’ directorate for timely project completion.\n\nIn October 2024, the Sindh government announced that it had constructed 22 small dams in various parts of Sindh which are not only supplying water to irrigate barren land but also recharging underground water and supplying drinking water to remote areas.\n\nOf the 100 dams planned by the Federation across Balochistan, 64 have been built. Unfortunately, some 25-30 of these dams were reportedly destroyed in the floods of 2022, and delays in construction of remaining dams have also occurred since then. \n\nPublished in Dawn, The Business and Finance Weekly, April 21st, 2025","summary":"The 300 local and foreign delegates participating in a two-day mineral summit in Islamabad have renewed hopes of growing foreign interest in Pakistan’s mineral sector, which remains unexplored for want of financing and access to technology.\n\n\n\nAddressing the Pakistan Minerals Investment Forum, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif said the country’s mineral wealth, “worth trillions of dollars”, could free its economy from perpetual dependency on frequent bailouts from global lenders.

A United Launch Alliance rocket is on the launchpad in Florida, carrying the first batch of 27 satellites for Amazon’s new “Kuiper” satellite-internet system. The mighty e-commerce firm hopes to deliver “high-speed, low-latency internet to virtually any location on the planet”. If the sales pitch sounds familiar, that is because it is. Kuiper is just the latest competitor in a fast-growing market for satellite broadband that is dominated by SpaceX’s Starlink. Such services are increasingly attracting the interest not just of private firms, but of governments too. Amazon’s $20bn push into orbit targets SpaceX and China.

Lately, however, it has been a cause of fear. A currency is only as good as the government that backs it. As markets doubt whether Donald Trump can govern competently or consistently, the dollar is taking a hit. Since its peak in mid-January the greenback has fallen by over 9pc against a basket of major currencies. Two-fifths of that fall has happened since April 1, even as the yield on ten-year Treasuries has crept up by 0.2 percentage points. That mix of rising yields and a falling currency is a warning sign: if investors are fleeing even though returns are up, it must be because they think America has become more risky. Rumours are rife that big foreign asset managers are dumping greenbacks.\n\n(Adapted from “How A Dollar Crisis Would Unfold,” published on April 16, 2025, by The Economist)\n\nGold’s allure\n\nGold was already on a tear when President Donald Trump unveiled sweeping tariffs on much of the world earlier this month, briefly sending the price of the metal to an all-time high of $3,166 per troy ounce, up 17.4pc from the day of his inauguration. On April 11 it surged past $3,200. In one part of the world, however, that has hardly curbed consumers’ enthusiasm. Asian countries in particular are voracious buyers of the yellow metal. They accounted for 64.5pc of global demand for gold jewellery and bullion last year, not including central-bank purchases. “Rising gold prices stopping your wedding jewellery purchase?” asks a sign outside the downtown Mumbai branch of Tanishq, India’s biggest jewellery retailer. “Pay nothing for your dream,” it declares, advertising a “festival of exchange” to trade in old jewellery for new.

Though the violent market reaction forced the hand of President Donald Trump to temporarily suspend most tariffs on all, barring China, until July to reset new terms of trade with countries facing his higher reciprocal tariffs, it has triggered a new climate of uncertainty.\n\nWith uncertainty escalating into a global trade war, the financial markets continue to roil as worries over an uncertain global business environment seem to have overtaken countries and investors more than tariffs themselves. And countries like Pakistan, which do not have much to offer Washington in exchange for a reprieve or lower tariffs, continue to wonder what sort of deal, if any, they are going to get from the US administration to maintain their market share in the world’s largest consumer market.\n\nWhat does this tariff war mean for the global economy? The World Trade Organisation’s (WTO) Global Trade Outlook and Statistics report, published on April 16, warned that Trump’s tariffs would send international trade into reverse this year, depressing global economic growth. Goods trade, previously forecast to expand by 2.7 per cent this year, is now expected to decline to 2.5pc. And if Trump’s far larger tariffs are reimposed after the 90-day hiatus, it would have a much greater impact, causing a 0.8pc decline in global goods trade. \n\nIt also expects global GDP growth to weaken to 2.2pc from the previous forecast of 2.8pc. In case of a surge in “trade policy uncertainty” worldwide as other countries readjust their policies in response, the WTO believes that the impact would be an even greater 1.5pc fall in trade. And in this worst-case scenario, the WTO predicts an even weaker global GDP growth of just 1.7pc.\n\n ‘Trump’s gamble to revive manufacturing via tariffs now risks accelerating the very decline it sought to reverse, as globalisation’s unwinding leaves the US isolated, not strengthened’\n\nWTO director general Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala said the enduring uncertainty threatens to act as a brake on global growth, with severe negative consequences for the world and its most vulnerable economies in particular. She was particularly concerned about the “decoupling” of the US and China, calling it a phenomenon that would have far-reaching consequences. Additionally, the reactivation of higher tariffs could have severe repercussions for economies like Pakistan, which are particularly sensitive to external economic shocks due to their trade concentrated on a small number of products as well as their limited resources to deal with setbacks.\n\nTrump’s tariffs completely disregard the “most favoured nation” rule, requiring a country to extend a trade advantage offered to one member country to the others as well. China has called upon the WTO to investigate the impact of the tariffs. “Reciprocal tariffs are not — and will never be — a cure for trade imbalances. Instead, they will backfire, harming the US itself,” Beijing said.\n\nBesides the WTO, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and World Bank have also warned about the potential shock to trade from a tariff war. Ajay Banga, head of the World Bank, said growing uncertainty would lead to slower global growth than expected. The IMF, however, stopped short of predicting a worldwide recession, saying, “Our new growth projections will include notable markdowns, but not recession.” But it did warn about an “erosion of trust” between countries.\n\nWith a temporary reprieve in higher tariffs for the rest of the world in place, Trump has zeroed in on China. When facing US tariff bullying, many believe that the US, as the largest global consumer market, is in a dominant position, and other countries, as suppliers, must accept changes to the rules or risk being outmanoeuvred, argues Robin Xing, Chief China Economist at Morgan Stanley. \n\nHowever, he says, this view is outdated. “With China’s increasing income levels, changes in development concepts, demographic shifts, and technological advancements, China could accelerate its transition to a domestic demand-driven economy, rather than merely positioning itself as a supplier,” he told an online conference organised by the China Macroeconomy Forum on April 9.\n\nTrump’s tariff policy, he said, has left a lasting wound on the US itself — one that’s playing out in two key ways. Businesses are holding back on investment, while consumers are getting hit with higher prices. The stock market is down, pushing the economy closer to a potential recession this year.\n\nThe Morgan Stanley economist maintained that Trump’s latest tariff push represents a 30-year inflection point in global economics. Unlike past trade disputes, today’s policies have created structural scars: multinational corporations now view US policy as erratic, undermining decades of trust in America’s role as a stable anchor of globalisation.\n\n“This permanent wound to confidence is driving capital away from the US and its allies, fracturing the post-Cold War economic order that once recycled global trade surpluses into Wall Street. Meanwhile, the US lacks tools to respond: high inflation and deficits limit Fed rate cuts, while Trump’s fiscal plans remain gridlocked.\n\n“The stakes mirror 2008’s systemic crisis — but unlike then, America enters this battle weakened, its policy credibility shattered and economic tools depleted. Trump’s gamble to revive manufacturing via tariffs now risks accelerating the very decline it sought to reverse, as globalisation’s unwinding leaves the US isolated, not strengthened,” Mr Xing concluded.\n\nThe world is witnessing a seismic shift, with the US now facing recession risks and China likely seizing this opportunity to open itself to exports from countries affected by Trump’s import taxes, a major Lahore-based textiles exporter said on the condition of anonymity. “These new global economic order realities present economies like Pakistan, having deep economic relations with the two economic giants, with challenges and opportunities. If the US market shuts out Pakistan, China’s movement towards a domestic demand-driven economy and opening up its market for others could make up for more than its potential US losses.” \n\nPublished in Dawn, The Business and Finance Weekly, April 21st, 2025","summary":"The US tariffs have upended the global economic order in just weeks.

The group contended that immigration authorities appeared to be moving to restart such removals under the Alien Enemies Act of 1798.\n\nThe majority did not provide a detailed explanation in the order early Saturday, as is typical, but the court previously said deportations could proceed only after those about to be removed had a chance to argue their case in court and were given “a reasonable time” to contest their pending removals.\n\n“Both the Executive and the Judiciary have an obligation to follow the law,” Alito said in the dissent released hours after the court’s intervention against Republican President Donald Trump’s administration.\n\nThe justices’ brief order directed the administration not to remove Venezuelans held in the Bluebonnet Detention Center “until further order of this court.”\n\nAlito said that “unprecedented” relief was “hastily and prematurely granted.”\n\nHe wrote that it was not clear whether the Supreme Court had jurisdiction at this stage of the case, saying that not all legal avenues had been played out in lower courts and the justices had not had the chance to hear the government’s side.\n\n“The only papers before this Court were those submitted by the applicants. The Court had not ordered or received a response by the Government regarding either the applicants’ factual allegations or any of the legal issues presented by the application. And the Court did not have the benefit of a Government response filed in any of the lower courts either,” Alito said.\n\nAlito said the legal filings, “while alleging that the applicants were in imminent danger of removal, provided little concrete support for that allegation.” He noted that while the court did not hear directly from the government regarding any planned deportations under the Alien Enemies Act in this case, a government lawyer in a different matter had told a U.S. District Court in a hearing Friday evening that no such deportations were then planned to occur either Friday or Saturday.\n\n“In sum, literally in the middle of the night, the Court issued unprecedented and legally questionable relief without giving the lower courts a chance to rule, without hearing from the opposing party, within eight hours of receiving the application, with dubious factual support for its order, and without providing any explanation for its order,” Alito wrote. “I refused to join the Court’s order because we had no good reason to think that, under the circumstances, issuing an order at midnight was necessary or appropriate. Both the Executive and the Judiciary have an obligation to follow the law.”\n\nThe administration has filed paperwork urging the high court to reconsider its hold.\n\nOn Friday, two federal judges refused to step in as lawyers for the men launched a desperate legal campaign to prevent their deportation. Early Saturday, the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals also refused to issue an order protecting the detainees from being deported.\n\nThe ACLU had already sued to block deportations of two Venezuelans held in the Bluebonnet facility and sought an order barring removals of any immigrants in the region under the Alien Enemies Act.\n\nIn the emergency filing early Friday, the ACLU warned that immigration authorities were accusing other Venezuelan men held there of being members of the Tren de Aragua gang, which would make them subject to Trump’s use of the law.\n\nIt has only been invoked three previous times in U.S. history, most recently during World War II to hold Japanese-American civilians in internment camps. The administration contends it gives them the power to swiftly remove immigrants they identified as members of the gang, regardless of their immigration status.\n\nFollowing the unanimous high court order on April 9, federal judges in Colorado, New York and southern Texas promptly issued orders barring removal of detainees under the law until the administration provides a process for them to make claims in court.\n\nBut there had been no such order issued in the area of Texas that covers Bluebonnet, which is 24 miles north of Abilene in the far northern end of the state.\n\nSome Venezuelans subject to Trump’s use of the law have been sent to El Salvador and housed in its notorious main prison.\n\nCopyright 2025 The Associated Press.

In the report which became the basis for the increase in import tariffs by US President Donald Trump, the USTR highlights the Mangga Dua Market as a center for counterfeit goods.Although the Mangga Dua Market is located in Jakarta, Indonesia, Pramono considers trade with the US to be under the authority of the central government. \"It is the central government's affair,\" said Pramono in Penjaringan, North Jakarta on Sunday, April 20, 2025.Meanwhile, Trade Minister Budi Santoso stated that the government continues to regularly monitor illegal goods circulating in the community, including at the Mangga Dua Market. \"Actually, we have regular monitoring, it is continuously done. Yesterday, two days ago, we also confiscated those illegal goods, so we are constantly moving,\" said Budi in Jakarta on Sunday, April 20, 2025 as reported by Antara.Budi stated that the government needs to enforce Intellectual Property Rights (IPR) amidst the rampant circulation of counterfeit goods in Indonesia. \"In principle, indeed the United States also wants all kinds of IPR to be enforced. We will check on that matter first,\" said Budi.According to him, the enforcement of IPR needs to be carried out in cooperation with any country. \"In principle, with the US or with any country, it must be enforced,\" he said.A Indonesian government delegation led by Coordinating Minister of Economic Affairs Airlangga Hartarto is currently negotiating with the United States government in Washington DC in response to the imposition of tariffs by President Donald Trump.Previously, the USTR claimed that US trade with Indonesia experienced a deficit of up to US$17.9 billion in 2024. This figure rose by 5.4 percent or US$923 million from 2023. Indonesia was then levied with a reciprocal tariff of 32 percent.In the National Trade Estimate Report on Foreign Trade Barriers 2025 published on March 31, 2025, the USTR noted various tariff and nontariff barriers faced by the country's trading partners, including Indonesia.One of the issues highlighted by the US government is the circulation of illegal goods in Indonesia. The USTR points out the Indonesian government's lack of protection for intellectual property, as shown by the rampant cases of piracy and copyright infringements.

China dominates trade and infrastructure development on the continent, leaving other players on the periphery, analysts say.\nYet some see opportunity in the shifting global landscape. With the United States scaling back aid and development efforts in the Global South under Donald Trump, and Europe and Russia preoccupied with the war in Ukraine, Southeast Asia and Africa could seize the moment to assert greater control over their development trajectories.\n“This means investing in South-South trade, digital and physical infrastructure, institutional linkages, and sustainable growth partnerships to shape a more resilient and autonomous Global South future,” said Joanne Lin, a senior fellow at the ISEAS – Yusof Ishak Institute’s Asean Studies Centre in Singapore.\nKnowledge gaps\nFor Al Busyra Basnur, Indonesia’s former ambassador to Ethiopia and Djibouti, more collaboration and exchanges are key.\n“We need more people-to-people contact, more economic cooperation, more cultural exchange, education ties and so on,” he said.\nMisconceptions persist in Indonesia about Africa, Al told This Week in Asia. “In my experience, the vast majority of Indonesians do not know about the current development in African countries,” he said. “They still associate it with poverty and economic problems … there is a gap in knowledge about Africa.”\nEconomic collaboration would be a logical starting point, he argued, citing initiatives like the Indonesia-Africa Forum, first held in 2018 and reconvened in September last year, when 32 new business partnerships were signed.\n\nThe latest forum, with its focus on energy, food resilience, health and mining, aimed to “strengthen concrete relations”, Indonesia’s government said. But Indonesia-based analyst Allan told This Week in Asia that the forum’s impact has been limited, especially when compared to other regional players like China and Japan.\nHe pointed to dwindling African participation as proof. Only 28 African states attended the 2024 forum, a sharp decline from the 47 who took part in 2018, and last year’s event was not endorsed by the African Union.\nBy contrast, platforms like the Forum on China-Africa Cooperation and the Tokyo International Conference on African Development continue to solidify their roles as key avenues for African partnerships.\nTrade figures reveal the disparity, Allan said. In 2023, Indonesia’s trade with Africa amounted to US$13.7 billion – less than 3 per cent of the country’s total trade. Meanwhile, Africa’s trade with China reached US$282 billion that year, while trade with India was US$103 billion and with Japan was around US$20 billion.\n“China now dominates African trade and infrastructure. India follows. Southeast Asia, Indonesia included, remains peripheral. Engagement exists, but it’s piecemeal,” Allan said, citing “scattered bilateral deals and ad hoc forums” that lack any cohesive strategy.\n\nGrowth potential\nDespite the challenges – weak connectivity, regulatory divergence, and limited private sector familiarity among them – analysts like Lin believe that the Association of Southeast Asian Nations and Africa have much to offer each other. Both regions share dynamic, youthful populations and aligned development priorities, creating fertile ground for deeper collaboration.\n“Africa’s demographic and resource potential” combined with “Asean’s integration into global value chains” provides “a foundation for mutually beneficial collaboration, particularly in infrastructure, renewable energy and agrotechnology,” she said.\nInstitutional frameworks are already in place to aid this process. The African Continental Free Trade Area and the Asean-led Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership are two platforms that could help foster stronger economic ties.\nAsean’s decision in recent years to grant South Africa and Morocco “sectoral dialogue partner” status also signals its intent to formalise inter-regional cooperation.\nUltimately, according to Lin, these pathways for economic and political engagement will become increasingly important as Global South nations navigate trade uncertainties and seek stronger partnerships.","summary":"Despite President Prabowo’s heartfelt words and promises of partnership, analysts question Indonesia’s commitment to the continent.","url":"https://www.scmp.com/week-asia/economics/article/3307101/indonesia-destined-be-footnote-africas-growth-story","image":"https://cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2025/04/18/3f8636ac-f56b-4159-99ac-cfe5733c7b9e_af3b6013.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-21 00:00:20","author":"Amy Sood","authors":["Amy Sood"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"cn","sentiment":0.228},{"id":313095610,"title":"Irish Examiner view: Gender identity moving into the spotlight","text":"The hasty volte-face by Sinn Féin’s health spokesman David Cullinane, who went from welcoming the unanimous decision as a “common sense” ruling that needs to be “fully examined” in Ireland to apologising for “hurt and offence... caused to the trans community”, was swift confirmation that this is now a volatile subject for politicians.\n\nAgainst a background of threats to exclude Sinn Féin from Dublin’s Pride march, Mr Cullinane added: “This is a complex issue for many, but we need to approach it with compassion, understanding, and dignity for all.”\n\nThe British Supreme Court ruled that the terms “woman” and “sex” in the Equality Act 2010 “refer to a biological woman and biological sex”.\n\nThis means transgender women with a gender recognition certificate can be excluded from single-sex spaces, such as changing rooms and homeless hostels, if “proportionate”.\n\nThere are widespread implications for public provision of facilities and participation in activities. One obvious area of conflict involves cross-border competition and organisations, such as the GAA.\n\nEquality minister Norma Foley moved to reaffirm that transgender people have a range of protections against discrimination under Irish law which embodies EU legislation.\n\nAt the heart of this matter is the provision of gender recognition certificates, which allow people to be recognised as whatever sex they say they are from the age of 18.\n\nIreland has its own procedures governed by the Gender Recognition Act 2015, although these do not differ widely from those which prevailed in Britain.\n\nAdvice on government.ie says: “Accordingly, if the preferred gender is the male gender, the person’s sex becomes that of a man. If it is the female gender, the person’s sex becomes that of a woman.”\n\nThe most recent figures available for Ireland cover the period from 2015 to 2023. 1,582 certificates have been issued, 21 of them to teenagers aged 16 or 17. Only a small percentage of applications, which have consistently been increasing in number, were refused. By comparison, Britain had granted 8,464 full certificates by the end of March 2024. Some 1,088 were approved in 2023/24, up from 871 in 2022/23, and 495 in 2021/22.\n\nThe subject of young people and gender dysphoria is particularly sensitive and, until 2022, Ireland availed of the services of the Tavistock Clinic and its “gender identity development service” programme, which became the subject of a highly critical review by Hilary Cass. In 2024, the HSE said a new model of gender healthcare would be developed by 2026.\n\nUntil then, it added: “Service users will continue to receive healthcare in the community and under the endocrinology service in the adult and paediatric centres in Ireland East Hospital Group and Children’s Health Ireland.”\n\nThat subject is about to return to the public domain with an application by two senior clinicians for a judicial review of the HSE, Hiqa, and the practice of referring young people abroad for treatment.\n\nWe previously warned that we had not heard the end of the legal and political ramifications of this subject. Given that the US will now only accept an acknowledgement of “biological sex at birth” on visa and Esta applications, this topic is moving centre stage. Our politicians will have to get ahead of it.\n\nSpace probe\n\nIn the Chinese sci-fi thriller which suggests that the Earth can only be saved from environmental disaster by handing it over to a race of hostile aliens, humankind devises a novel solution. Yun Tianming, a character from the novel The Three Body Problem (the particle physicist Will Downing in the Netflix series), has his brain cryogenically frozen and placed on a probe headed towards Trisolaris and a rendezvous which could save the world.\n\nGiven the interest in space flight of Donald Trump’s tech bros, perhaps there is a new career opportunity for Elon Musk to head a mission to K2-18b, the giant planet 124 light years away, which scientists have identified as yielding the strongest evidence to date of the possibility of extraterrestrial life.

Once a paradise of safety, security, and prosperity, entire neighborhoods are occupied and controlled by foreign gangs,' he told Newsmax.\n\n'Where do all the residents who’ve been displaced, who’ve been forced from Los Angeles – where do they go to get their reparations?'\n\nMiller expressed concern for school-aged children, noting: 'We used to have a functioning public school system in this country.\n\n'Then we had open borders. Now our schools are in chaos and disarray. We need hundreds of translators,' he said.\n\n'Nobody’s learning how to read or write. We had an entire generation of Americans - multiple generations, in fact - robbed of educational opportunities.'\n\nMiller went on, asking whether the 'victims of fentanyl poisoning brought in by Democrats’ open border,' deserve reparations.\n\n'Hundreds of thousands of moms and dads whose kids are dead and buried in the ground. Where do they go to get their reparations from the government?,' he asked.\n\n'And then all the women who have been raped, who have been beaten, who have been murdered, all the dads who have been shot dead and aren’t home, all the police officers who have been slain by illegal aliens in ambush attacks in the line of duty. \n\n'Where do any of these people go? Where do any of their families go to get reparations?'\n\nMiller said Americans could 'spend the rest of our lives trying to document the harms' caused by illegal migration into the nation. \n\n'There aren’t enough volumes that could fit into a library to calculate the carnage that has been inflicted by the Democrat party’s policy of open borders,' he said.\n\n'Where does our whole country go to get repaid for all of the wealth, all of the prosperity and security that has been stolen from us by decades of uncontrolled, illegal mass migration, because we all deserve reparations for what has been stolen from us. \n\n'It is a tragedy that defies our ability to even describe it.'\n\nMiller's impassioned speech has attracted support from MAGA loyalists who praised him for shining a light on matters directly impacting them.\n\n'Thank you Stephen Miller for highlighting the truth about mass migrations impact. Our lives change drastically and we are still owed for the damages,' one supporter wrote. \n\nOthers told him he is a 'national treasure.'\n\nThere are several examples of the United States paying reparations in the past, including to Native American tribes for land taken by the government.\n\nTrump also floated the possibility of creating a compensation fund for January 6 rioters who were convicted - and later pardoned by the president - for their roles in the attack on the Capitol.\n\nBut the Trump administration has focused on reversing the 'migrant crisis' by embarking on the largest mass deportation agenda in the nation's history.\n\nSince March, El Salvador has accepted from the United States more than 200 Venezuelan immigrants whom Trump administration officials have accused of gang activity and violent crimes.\n\nThe case which got Miller so riled up centers upon Abrego Garcia, who was reportedly deported in 'error' but has not been allowed to return to the United States.\n\nThe case has become a focal point in the national immigration debate. Democrats insist that President Donald Trump is overstepping his executive authority and disrespecting the courts, but Republicans are criticizing Democrats for defending a man Trump and White House officials claim is an MS-13 gang member, despite the fact that he has not been charged with any gang-related crimes.","summary":"Miller was incensed by a suggestion that  Kilmar Abrego Garcia, an illegal migrant with suspected dies to the MS-13 gang, was entitled to reparations.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-14630377/stephen-miller-americans-reparations-illegal-migration.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/04/20/23/97496067-0-image-m-100_1745188026819.jpg","video":"https://videos.dailymail.co.uk/video/mol/2025/04/14/6895408866630022937/1024x576_MP4_6895408866630022937.mp4","publish_date":"2025-04-20 23:18:33","author":"Brittany Chain,Editor","authors":["Brittany Chain","Editor"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.224},{"id":313087902,"title":"Elizabeth Hurley debuts new relationship with Billy Ray Cyrus","text":"Elizabeth Hurley hard-launched her new relationship with Billy Ray Cyrus on Sunday. \n\n“Happy Easter,” the 59-year-old model wrote on Instagram alongside a picture of the 63-year-old country music artist kissing her on the cheek. \n\nThe post was met with hundreds of shocked commenters praising the new couple. Actress Melissa Gilbert couldn’t believe the news, writing, “Wait….what?” \n\n“The couple we didn’t know we needed,” another viewer commented. \n\nThe duo’s relationship debut comes months after Cyrus officially settled his divorce with his ex-wife, Firerose, in August 2024.\n\nCyrus’ marriage to Firerose, 36, was short-lived, lasting only eight months after they said “I do” before they parted ways. And the end wasn’t pretty. \n\nThe “Butterfly Fly Away” artist requested an annulment on the grounds of fraud. According to court documents obtained by E! News, Cyrus said, “he gave consent to marriage based on Fraud by the Wife, that had he known he would not have entered into the bonds of matrimony.”\n\nHe also cited “irreconcilable differences” and “inappropriate marital conduct” as the reasons for their split.\n\nIn January, the Hannah Montana actor took the stage at the inauguration of Donald Trump, a performance which many viewers later branded “an epic disaster” due to technical issues. \n\nAt one point during the show, he asked the sound crew if he should just “get the hell off the stage.” \n\nAfter the concert, his adopted son and fellow musician Trace, 35, shared a lengthy statement about his dad out of “a place of love and also fear that the world may lose you far too soon.” \n\n“I love you Dad,” Trace wrote. “We haven’t talked in a while but I’m over a year and half clean from alcohol. Guess what? I feel amazing.\n\n“I don’t know what you’re struggling with exactly but I think I have a pretty good idea and I’d love to help you if you would open up and receive the help. You know how to reach me. Till that day comes I will continue to pray for you.” \n\nFirerose also spoke out amid Cyrus’ concert controversy. “What’s being seen in public now reflects much of what I experienced in private during our relationship,” she argued in a statement sent to People. \n\n“It’s very sad to see those same struggles continue for him, but I’m glad the truth is coming to light — for his potential good because healing is only possible when you confront the truth and accept there’s a problem,” she continued. \n\nBefore Firerose, Cyrus was married to Cindy Smith from 1986 to 1991. He also tied the knot with Tish Cyrus, the mother of his three kids — Miley Cyrus, Noah Cyrus, and Braison Cyrus. \n\nHurley was married to businessman Arun Nayar for four years from 2007 to 2011. She also had a relationship with the actor Hugh Grant, between 1987 and 2000, and with the late Australian cricket legend Shane Warne, between 2011 and 2013. She has a son, actor and model Damien Hurley, with the late American businessman Steve Bing.","summary":"The relationship news comes months after the country artist settled his divorce with Firerose","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/elizabeth-hurley-billy-ray-cyrus-relationship-b2736475.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/04/20/21/41/MixCollage-20-Apr-2025-05-28-PM-7561.jpg?width=1200&height=800&crop=1200:800","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/dmCNO3Yc-OhrQWqOm.mp4","publish_date":"2025-04-20 23:14:53","author":"Kaleigh Werner","authors":["Kaleigh Werner"],"language":"en","category":"entertainment","source_country":"gb","sentiment":0.028},{"id":313086136,"title":"Trump's Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth embroiled in ANOTHER astonishing war plan group chat leak","text":"Pete Hegseth has again been accused of sharing details of a US foreign military attack in a Signal group chat, this time including his wife, brother and personal lawyer.\n\nThe chat contained details of a March attack on Yemen's Iran-aligned Houthis, The New York Times reported. \n\nIt raises more questions about his use of an unclassified messaging system to share highly sensitive security details.\n\nThe information shared 'included the flight schedules for the F/A-18 Hornets targeting the Houthis in Yemen,' the newspaper reported.\n\nThe outlet said that unlike the accidental leak where journalist Jeffrey Goldberg was mistakenly included in the group, this group chat was created by Hegseth. \n\nHegseth's wife Jennifer, a former producer at the Defense Secretary's ex-employer Fox News, is not an employee of the Defense Department. \n\nHis brother Phil and attorney Tim Parlatore do have jobs at the Pentagon but it is not clear if they are on a need-to-know basis regarding attacks. \n\nJennifer Hegseth has also reportedly attended sensitive meetings with foreign military counterparts, the Wall Street Journal has separately reported. \n\nDailyMail.com has reached out to the Defense Department and Parlatore for comment. \n\nThe story came out following a week after three top staffers under Hegseth at the Pentagon were forced to resign amid a probe into leaks at the Department of Defense. \n\nFour sources familiar with the message group, said that second chat included details of the schedule of the air strikes. \n\nHegseth allegedly shared the same details of the attack that were revealed last month by The Atlantic magazine after its editor-in-chief, Jeffrey Goldberg, was included in a separate chat on the Signal app by mistake, in an embarrassing incident involving all of President Donald Trump's most senior national security officials. \n\nGoldberg revealed in a March story that a 'Michael Waltz' had added him to a group chat on the encrypted app Signal, where top White House officials discussed plans for attacking the Iranian-backed Houthis earlier this month. \n\nThe initial group chat included a number of Cabinet members and came to light because Jeffrey Goldberg, editor-in-chief of The Atlantic, was accidentally added to the group. \n\nWaltz started the conversation on Signal, an encrypted messaging app, that included users identified as Vice President JD Vance, Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth and Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard. \n\nA CIA representative, Trump adviser Stephen Miller and White House Chief of Staff Susie Wiles were also listed in the group.\n\n'The statements by Hegseth, Gabbard, Ratcliffe, and Trump - combined with the assertions made by numerous administration officials that we are lying about the content of the Signal texts - have led us to believe that people should see the texts in order to reach their own conclusions,' wrote Goldberg and The Atlantic's Shane Harris. \n\n'There is a clear public interest in disclosing the sort of information that Trump advisers included in non-secure communications channels, especially because senior administration figures are attempting to downplay the significance of the messages that were shared,' the journalists added. \n\nRevelations of another use of Signal for classified information come as one of Hegseth's leading advisers, Dan Caldwell, was escorted from the Pentagon last week after being identified during an investigation into leaks at the Department of Defense.\n\nFollowing Caldwell's departure, less senior officials Darin Selnick, who recently became Hegseth's deputy chief of staff, and Colin Carroll, who was chief of staff to Deputy Defense Secretary Steve Feinberg, were put on administrative leave, officials said.\n\nThe Trump administration has aggressively pursued leaks, an effort that has been enthusiastically embraced by Hegseth at the Pentagon.\n\nThe initial leak investigation at the Pentagon began on March 21 when Hegseth's chief of staff Joe Kasper - who is also rumored to be on the outs - ordered the probe.\n\nThe probe included military operational plans for the Panama canal, a second carrier headed to the Red Sea, the pausing the collection of intelligence to Ukraine, and the leak that Elon Musk's would meet with Hegseth about the U.S. war plans for China, an official told Politico.\n\nKasper said the probe would examine 'recent unauthorized disclosures of national security information' and said polygraphs would be used.\n\n'The use of polygraphs in the execution of this investigation will be in accordance with applicable law and policy,' he wrote. 'This investigation will commence immediately and culminate in a report to the Secretary of Defense.' \n\nHe noted that 'information identifying a party responsible for an unauthorized disclosure' would be referred for criminal prosecution.'\n\nKasper ordered the probe one day after the New York Times reported the Pentagon set up a briefing with Elon Musk on a potential war with China.\n\nCaldwell played a critical role as an adviser to Hegseth. \n\nHe was the staff member designated as Hegseth's point person in the Signal messaging chat that top Trump administration national security officials, including the defense secretary, used to convey plans for a military strike against Houthi militants in Yemen.\n\nCaldwell and Hegseth have a longtime friendship, going back to Hegseth's time as the head of Concerned Veterans for America, a nonprofit. Caldwell worked at CVA beginning in 2013 as policy director and later as executive director. \n\nAdditionally, Caldwell was by Hegseth's side on Capitol Hill as the former Fox News host fought to keep his nomination alive during questions about his treatment of women. \n\nSelnick also performed the duties of the under secretary of Defense for personnel and readiness. He served in the White House and the Department of Veterans Affairs in the first Trump administration. \n\nAnd he also has ties to Concerned Veterans for America, where he served as a senior adviser. \n\nAll three suspended aides are close in age and share the same isolationist view of foreign policy. That view is also shared by Vice President J.D. Vance and Don Trump Jr., the president's oldest son.\n\nCaldwell, once one of U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth's most senior advisors, issued a joint statement on Saturday along with two other Pentagon officials casting doubt on an internal leak investigation that led to their ouster this week.\n\n'We are incredibly disappointed by the manner in which our service at the Department of Defense ended,' Caldwell posted on X. \n\n'Unnamed Pentagon officials have slandered our character with baseless attacks on our way out the door.'\n\nCaldwell and the others added: 'We still have not been told what exactly we were investigated for, if there is still an active investigation, or if there was even a real investigation of 'leaks' to begin with.'\n\nThe comments were the first by Caldwell since it was first disclosed that he was escorted out of the Pentagon building on Tuesday.","summary":"Pete Hegseth has again been accused of sharing details of a US foreign military attack in a Signal group chat, this time including his wife, brother and personal lawyer.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-14630469/Pete-Hegseth-second-group-chat-leak-Trump.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/04/20/23/97496671-0-image-a-17_1745188154453.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-20 23:06:28","author":"Editor,Stephen M.

green cards are also ‘feeling afraid’.\n\n12.06am, 21 Apr 2025\n\nShare options\n\nTHE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION’S crackdown on illegal and undocumented immigrants is creating ‘fear across the board’ for Irish migrants in the US, a leading lawyer has said. \n\nSince he came into office, Donald Trump has been pouring resources into arresting and deporting undocumented immigrants as he aims to carry out the immigration purge that was promised during the presidential campaign.\n\nTrump vowed to undertake the largest number of mass deportations in US history as president.\n\nBut while the Trump White House said deportations would prioritise immigrants with criminal records, his “border czar” Tom Homan said there would be “collateral arrests,” meaning some immigrants without criminal records could also be detained.\n\n“The fear is across the board, and it’s not just undocumented people that are feeling afraid,” Irish immigration lawyer Fiona McEntee told The Journal.\n\nFiona McEnteeErin Stefanik Photography\n\nErin Stefanik Photography\n\nShe founded the Chicago-based McEntee Law Group, which focuses on immigration law.\n\nMcEntee noted that people who have “green cards, visas, and even naturalised US citizens” are also feeling this fear.\n\nA naturalised US citizen is someone who was not born in the United States but has legally acquired citizenship.\n\nA green card allows a person to live and work in the US and start the process to become a naturalised citizen – but there have been recent high-profile cases of people who hold green cards being deported for taking part in pro-Palestine protests.\n\nStudents gather inside the campus of Columbia University to protest the university's stance on Israel on 19 April, 2024 in New York City.Alamy Stock Photo\n\nAlamy Stock Photo\n\n“The green card is a significant milestone in immigration and it takes a lot of work to get to that point,” said McEntee.\n\n“We would have viewed that as something that could not really be taken away, absent some very specific circumstances, such as committing a serious crime.”\n\nIrish in America\n\nThere is a perception that “Irish privilege” can prevent the undocumented Irish in the US from being fearful of Trump’s deportations.\n\nBut McEntee noted that Irish people have been deported under previous administrations.\n\n“If you’re an English-speaking white immigrant, there is a certain privilege,” said McEntee.\n\n“There is a lot of racial profiling here and people are being targeted based on looking like an immigrant, which is just ridiculous.\n\n“But it’s not accurate to say that Irish people have not been subject to immigration enforcement in the past.”\n\nIt’s estimated there are around 10,000 undocumented Irish immigrants across the US but exact figures are understandably difficult to come by. \n\nAdvertisement\n\nBetween 2022 and 2024, 158 Irish people were detained by ICE’s Enforcement and Removal Operations and 131 were removed from the US for immigration violations.\n\n“And now, this administration seems to be trying to meet some kind of quota and they’re doing all these raids and sweeps and casting a massively wide net,” said McEntee.\n\nThere have been reports that the Trump administration is requiring at least 1,500 arrests per day by ICE, the US Immigration and Customs Enforcement.\n\nRally to protest arrest of Mahmoud

[enforcement measures] we’re seeing are targeting certain groups like Venezuelan immigrants, but others are getting caught up in that as well.”\n\nMcEntee also noted the tough tone struck by Trump’s border czar, who was once an acting director of ICE.\n\nLast year, Homan said: “As a guy who spent 34 years deporting illegal aliens, I got a message to the millions of illegal aliens… you better start packing now, because you’re going home.”\n\nMeanwhile, McEntee noted that pathways to citizenship are complex and there is “often no place in the immigration system for them to go”.\n\nAnd while working without authorisation or overstaying your welcome may be forgiven in certain circumstances, a criminal background, no matter how minor, won’t.\n\nJ1 visas and social media\n\nMeanwhile, McEntee re-iterated a warning that was issued last week to students going to the US on a J1 visa.\n\nThe Union of Students in Ireland warned of the “potential risks” of being involved in activism amid recent cases of students without US citizenship being arrested and threatened with deportation after taking part in pro-Palestine protests at universities.\n\n“People need to be extremely careful about any type of political activism, including on social media, because this administration is taking a different stance to the Biden administration in relation to what they consider to be antisemitic and anti-American,” said McEntee.\n\n“I appreciate the value of free speech, it’s a constitutional right here in the US, but the way we’re seeing this play out is extremely troubling and concerning.”\n\nFile photo of protest by pro-Palestinian students who walked out of classAlamy\n\nShe added that visitors to the US should consider their social media history when going before Customs officials.\n\nLast month, a French scientist was reportedly refused entry to the US when customs officials found WhatApp messages on his phone expressing criticism of the Trump administration.\n\n“Customs officials don’t necessarily have to tell you exactly why you’re not getting it,” said McEntee.\n\n“They have a huge amount of power and discretion, and they have said they’re going to start looking at people’s social media in relation to conduct that they deem to be antisemitic.\n\n“If you’re a potential visitor to the US, they have all the cards, you don’t really have any, so it can be a tricky position to be in.”\n\nReaders like you are keeping these stories free for everyone...\n\nA mix of advertising and supporting contributions helps keep paywalls away

Philomena Jovanovic, 11, collapsed near the resolute desk Friday shortly after her grandfather, Dr. Mehmet Oz was sworn in as administrator of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services by Health and Human Services Secretary, Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. Pholimena’s health episode brought Trump’s press conference — in which he was discussing the threat of Iran obtaining a nuclear weapon — to an abrupt end. GOP SENATOR SAYS DR OZ IGNORED HIS QUESTIONS ON TRANSGENDER ISSUES, ABORTION \"Philo fainted, Philo fainted. Dad, go!\" presumably one of Oz’s daughter’s shouted. The media personnel scrambled as White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt ordered them out of the Oval Office. Daphne Oz could be seen walking Philomena past the Resolute Desk and cradling her jaw before the cameras were ordered to be turned off. Daphne, a food writer who co-hosted the cooking talk show \"The Chew\" on ABC from 2011-2017, thanked the White House medical team for caring for her daughter, and also extended thanks to Trump for lavishing her children with attention. \"Most of all, thank you to President Trump who went out of his way to make both our children feel comfortable in a stressful situation. He was exceedingly warm, caring and generous as he spent personal time with each of them at the Resolute Desk and gifted them treasures to take home,\" Daphne wrote. TRUMP APPOINTS DR.

Oz lost his Senate race to Democrat John Fetterman, but was nominated to run the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services by Trump. He was confirmed 53-45 in the Senate on April 3.

Plus, Americans are waking up to climate change threat","text":"Survey Says is a weekly column rounding up three of the most important polling trends or data points you need to know about. You’ll also find data-based updates on past Daily Kos reporting, plus a vibe check on a trend that’s driving politics.\n\n2028 favorites: Harris slips, Booker booms, but what about AOC?\n\nIt’s April 2025, five months after an enormously depressing presidential election, so you know what that means: It’s time to talk about the 2028 presidential race.\n\nSince last year’s election, Echelon Insights has conducted four polls asking voters who they’d support if their party’s 2028 presidential primaries were held today. And in its first poll, fielded mere days after the 2024 election, 41% of Democratic voters and Democratic-leaning independents supported Kamala Harris to be their next presidential nominee. \n\nBut now, three months into President Donald Trump’s fresh hell, only 28% would back Harris if the 2028 Democratic primary were held today, according to new data from the same pollster. \n\nWhile Harris still leads the survey’s field of 20 potential candidates, her support has fallen in each survey the pollster has run.\n\nWho else are Democrats eyeing, then?\n\nNew Jersey Sen. Cory Booker has leapt into second place. In March, only 2% of Democratic voters wanted him to be the next nominee, but now, coming off his fiery, marathon anti-Trump speech on the Senate floor, his support has jumped to 11%.\n\nAfter him are New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (7%), former Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg (7%), and Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz (5%). No other name got more than 5% support. (Buttigieg, Booker, and Ocasio-Cortez also lead another poll that excludes Harris from the list of options.) \n\nHowever, Ocasio-Cortez’s prospects could be underrated. For one, she’s currently on a cross-country tour with Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders and drawing tens of thousands of people, even in some dark red areas of the country. And with a certain endorsement from Sanders, she’d likely have the progressive lane to herself, all while other candidates probably try to out-moderate each other.\n\nMore importantly, though, Yale University’s new poll shows her a close second behind Harris when it comes to 2028. Among Democratic voters and Democratic-leaning independents, Harris pulls 27.5% support and Ocasio-Cortez scores 21.3%. No other named option received more than 15% support. \n\nThe poll also finds that she’s the most liked among potential 2028 Democratic candidates, with a net favorability of +62. Harris is in second place, at +59.\n\nHarris’ 2028-related support is likely to keep falling as well. After all, she did lose last year’s election, and Democrats will likely get even more wary about backing her for a second go at the White House. Also, Harris is currently weighing a run for governor of California and has set a self-imposed summer deadline to decide. She’d be an obvious favorite in that race, with 31% of California’s overall likely-voter electorate already backing her for the job, according to new polling from Emerson College. \n\nIf Ocasio-Cortez enters the 2028 Democratic primary, she would need to prove she can win general-election voters, who might be less keen on a candidate who sells “Abolish ICE” dad hats. Democrats will surely be hesitant to take an electability risk after being burned last year.\n\nThat said, an idealistic, fresh-faced, anti-establishment Democrat of color beloved by young voters, known for delivering powerful speeches, and with one parent who was born outside the U.S. does ring a few bells. \n\nGlobal warming, personal threat\n\nGood news for people who love bad news: More Americans than ever before are worried about how much climate change will harm them personally.\n\nForty-eight percent of Americans say that global warming will pose “a serious threat” to them and their way of life in their lifetime, according to new data from Gallup. That’s up from a previous high of 46% in 2023 and well above the 39% average of Gallup’s polling since 1997.\n\nThat said, 51% of Americans say it won’t pose a personal threat to them. \n\nThe odd thing is, more Americans than ever before also say the effects of climate change are currently playing out. According to Gallup, 63% say global warming’s effects have already begun, with another 23% saying they will begin in the future. Just a scant 12% say those effects will never happen.\n\nThe burning-hot silver lining in these numbers is that Americans are taking climate change more seriously than ever before. The downside, though, is that the issue still ranks at the bottom of their biggest environmental worries, with problems like drinking-water safety and river pollution ranking much higher.\n\nStill, 63% of Americans worrying a great deal or a fair amount about global warming ain’t terrible. But for the worry to become big enough that U.S. politicians are forced to meet the moment, it’ll no doubt take things getting even worse.\n\nThe “good” news here is that things very much are.\n\nRepublicans soften on China—wait, what?\n\nAs infamous sinophobe Trump slaps heavy tariffs on China, fewer Americans see the world’s most populous country in a negative light, but more curiously, it’s Trump’s base that is softening.\n\nAccording to new data from Pew Research Center, 33% of U.S. adults overall have a “very” unfavorable opinion of China, down from 43% last year, making for a drop of 10 percentage points. Another 44% have a “somewhat” unfavorable view of China. That marks the first time in five years that the percentage of Americans with an unfavorable view has declined from the year prior.\n\nLargely responsible for that drop are Republicans, whose very unfavorable view of China has fallen 16 points since last year. And the percentage of those with an unfavorable view (“very” or “somewhat”) has fallen 8 points. \n\nThe reason for this may be that Republicans see China as less of a threat, with fewer considering the nation to be the world’s leading economic and military power, according to Pew.\n\nFor Democrats, the survey finds a 5-point drop from 2024. Democrats have also long been less critical than Republicans when it comes to China.\n\nThe survey was fielded before Trump’s “Liberation Day” tariffs, though, so it’s possible that his 145% tariff on China (or is it 245%?) has reminded Republicans to start hating the nation again.\n\nAny updates?\n\n Maine’s perennially concerned Republican Sen. Susan Collins holds a seat Democrats must win to have a real shot of retaking the chamber in the near future, and a new poll brings welcome news: Collins is much more unpopular than she was at this point six years ago, ahead of her 2020 reelection, according to Morning Consult. In 2019, 52% of Maine voters approved of the job she was doing, while 39% disapproved. Now only 42% approve, and 51% disapprove. \n\n As the Trump administration illegally deports Maryland fathers and student activists without due process, it does so with very little public support. A new poll from Data for Progress finds that even most Republicans support giving common due process rights, such as the right to a fair trial, to legal immigrants. Additionally, 57% of likely voters think the government should be able to deport undocumented migrants only if it provides evidence for their deportation and offers them a hearing.\n\nDemocratic voters’ view of Harris has soured slightly since the 2024 election, according to Civiqs. The day before last year’s election, 93% of Democratic voters had a favorable view of her, while only 5% had a negative view. \n\nHowever, as of this past Monday, only 87% have a favorable view of her, and 8% have an unfavorable view. \n\nAlso notable is that Civiqs has been tracking her favorability since November 2017, and she has never once had a net-positive rating among all registered voters.","summary":"Survey Says is a weekly column rounding up three of the most important polling trends or data points you need to know about.

warning he is “serious” about his plan to rebuild America’s wealth.\n\nMr Trump said “many world leaders and business executives” had come to him personally to ask for relief from tariff after his controversial “Liberation Day” announcements.\n\nFollowing Mr Trump’s announcements, global markets fell before Mr Trump initiated a 90-day pause on tariffs for all countries except China.\n\n“Since our announcement of LIBERATION DAY, many world leaders and business executives have come to me asking for relief from tariffs,” Mr Trump wrote on Truth Social.\n\n“It’s good to see that the world knows we are serious, because WE ARE!\n\n“They must right the wrongs of decades of abuse, but it won’t be easy for them.\n\n“We must rebuild the wealth of our great country, and create true reciprocity.\n\n“But for those who want the easiest path: Come to America, and build in America!”\n\nThe post was one of many in a social media flurry from the US president, quickly swapping between sending Easter messages, discussing tariffs and Kilmar Armando Abrego Garcia, a man recently deported by the Trump Administration to a notorious El Salvador prison.\n\nMr Trump shared his “golden rule of negotiating” with other countries, saying: He who has the gold makes the rules.”\n\nThe US president also shared his hope that Russia and Ukraine would make a deal “this week”.\n\n“Both (countries) will then start to do big business with the United States of America, which is thriving, and make a fortune,” Mr Trump wrote on Truth Social.\n\nThe flurry of tweets come as DHL confirmed it will suspend business-to-customer shipping for goods to the US values at over $US800 ($1,250), over customs red tape that had created additional delays for clearance times.","summary":"Donald Trump has

top secret war plans’ in ANOTHER group chat with wife and brother in major security breach","text":"DONALD TRUMP'S defence chief \"shared top secret war plans\" in another Signal group chat with his wife and brother in a major security breach.\n\nDefence Secretary Pete Hegseth is said to have shared bombshell information on impending US airstrikes on Yemen in the private group, reports claim.\n\nIt would mark the second time Hegseth has faced accusations of sharing top-secret military information on the messaging app with unofficial individuals.\n\nLast month, Jeffrey Goldberg, editor in chief of the Atlantic magazine, revealed he was included in a messaging chain alongside Trump's vice president JD Vance in the incredible security blunder.\n\nSeveral other senior members of the Trump administration were also included such as Hegseth and national security adviser Mike Waltz.\n\nThe messages were said to have discussed the strikes against the Houthi terror group in Yemen, with further bombshell claims that Hegseth ripped into America's European allies, calling them \"pathetic free-loaders\".\n\nNow, on Sunday, the New York Times reported that the Defence Sec discussed top-secret information on the same March 15 strikes with the second Signal chat.\n\nThe bombshell intel shared \"included the flight schedules for the F/A-18 Hornets targeting the Houthis in Yemen,\" the newspaper reported.\n\nIt added that, compared to the accidental leak where journalist Goldberg was mistakenly included in the group, the chat was actually created by Hegseth. \n\nCiting unnamed sources, the newspaper said: \"It included his wife and about a dozen other people from his personal and professional inner circle in January, before his confirmation as defense secretary.\"\n\nHegseth's wife, Jennifer, is a former Fox News producer and journalist.\n\nThe group also included his brother Phil and Tim Parlatore, both of who work different roles at the Pentagon.\n\nOn March 15, Trump ordered the massive attack on Houthi rebels in a stark warning to the militants and their Iranian backers.\n\nThe US president ordered the series of airstrikes on capital Sanaa in response to the terror group’s attacks on Red Sea shipping.\n\nWAR PLANS LEAKED\n\nJeffrey Goldberg revealed he was aware of the plans as he published an article today headlined: \"The Trump Administration Accidentally Texted Me Its War Plans.”\n\nIn the story, Goldberg claimed he spoke with Waltz on the Signal messaging app on March 11.\n\nDays later he was invited to join a chain called the \"Houthi PC small group\".\n\nSignal is a private messaging app which is often used to keep texts private and untraceable.\n\nGoldberg claimed that when he was added into the chat he was given the callsign \"JG\".\n\nHe believes this may have been down to Waltz mistaking his number for Jamieson Greer, the US Trade Representative, due to the initials.\n\nOn March 13, Waltz messaged those in the chat and asked them to provide him with the best point of contact from their team who would be able to help with the coming weekend. \n\nGoldberg then revealed a text from Waltz at 8:05am a day later which read: \"Team, you should have a statement of conclusions with tasking per the Presidents [sic] guidance this morning in your high side inboxes.\"\n\nHigh side refers to the US government's classified computer systems.\n\nJD Vance is then said to have messaged the group saying: \"I think we are making a mistake.\"\n\nHe added: \"[Three] percent of US trade runs through the [Suez Canal]. 40 percent of European trade does.\n\n\"There is a real risk that the public doesn’t understand this or why it’s necessary. The strongest reason to do this is, as POTUS said, to send a message.\"\n\nHegseth replied: \"I understand your concerns.\"\n\nBefore arguing “messaging is going to be tough no matter what - nobody knows who the Houthis are\".\n\nVance then appeared to accept the Pentagon chief's argument as he wrote: \"If you think we should do it let’s go. I just hate bailing Europe out again.\"\n\nThen an account believed to belong to Stephen Miller said: \"As I heard it, the president was clear: green light, but we soon make clear to Egypt and Europe what we expect in return.\"\n\nFollowing the strikes, an account said the operation was an “amazing job”.\n\nOthers messages congratulated Hegseth for the good work as another said it was a “good start\", according to screenshots.\n\nGoldberg left the group after the strikes had taken place before reaching out to officials including Waltz and Hegseth.","summary":"","url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/34564058/trump-aides-leak-war-plans/","image":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/image_18cb90.jpe?strip=all&quality=100&w=959&h=640&crop=1","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-20 22:51:59","author":"Annabel Bate","authors":["Annabel Bate"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.163},{"id":313088102,"title":"El Salvador proposes sending US deportees to Venezuela","text":"El Salvador's president has proposed a deal to send hundreds of Venezuelans deported from the US and imprisoned in his country to Venezuela, in exchange for taking \"political prisoners\" being held in Venezuela.\n\nIn a post on X on Sunday, President Nayib Bukele asked that Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro hand over 252 \"of the thousands of the political prisoners you are holding\", under his proposed deal.\n\nThe Salvadoran leader did not say whether the prisoners would be incarcerated again upon the exchange.\n\nVenezuela's Ministry of Communication did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nAmong those Bukele proposed for release from Venezuela are journalist Roland Carreno, human rights lawyer Rocio San Miguel and Corina Parisca de Machado, mother of Venezuelan opposition leader Maria Corina Machado.\n\nHe also mentioned nearly 50 detainees of other nationalities including US, German and French citizens, as part of the proposed exchange.\n\nIn March, the administration of President Donald Trump deported at least 200 Venezuelans from the United States to El Salvador, accusing them of being members of the Tren de Aragua criminal gang.\n\nThe US is paying El Salvador $US6 million ($A9.4 million) to detain the migrants.\n\nThe Venezuelan government has said it has no political prisoners and that imprisoned people have been convicted of crimes.

Tammy Duckworth, who sits on the Senate Armed Services Committee, called for Hegseth’s resignation.\n\n“How many times does Pete Hegseth need to leak classified intelligence before Donald Trump and Republicans understand that he isn’t only a f***ing liar, he is a threat to our national security?” Duckworth wrote in a post on X. “Every day he stays in his job is another day our troops’ lives are endangered by his singular stupidity,” Duckworth added. “He must resign in disgrace.”\n\nThe Defense Department’s acting inspector general is currently investigating the Signal chat that accidentally included Goldberg.\n\nIn a letter to Hegseth earlier this month, Steven Stebbins said he will review whether the defense secretary broke any rules regarding the sharing of classified information.\n\nIt is unclear whether Stebbins had already uncovered the reported second Signal chat before the Times published its report.\n\nLast month reports emerged that Hegseth brought his wife to two meetings with foreign military officials.\n\nThe Wall Street Journal reported that sensitive information was discussed in both meetings, one with U.K. officials and another with NATO defense ministers, according to multiple people who were either present or had knowledge of the discussions.\n\nHis wife was said to have been present at a March 6 meeting at the Pentagon with Britain’s Secretary of Defence John Healy and Admiral Tony Radakin, head of the U.K. armed forces.","url":"https://uk.news.yahoo.com/hegseth-shared-yemen-attack-details-214659309.html","image":"https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_independent_577/010c1caae8d1e36ca62171a2cc01837e","video":"","publish_date":"2025-04-20 22:32:47","author":"Phil Thomas And Rhian Lubin","authors":["Phil Thomas And Rhian Lubin"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":0.094},{"id":313091916,"title":"Joe Rogan Paints A Picture Of Trump: In Between Golf Swings, He's On The Phone With Other Presidents: 'We're Going To Need More Money!'","text":"It seems that Joe Rogan isn’t buying the idea that there’s some hidden genius behind President Donald Trump’s actions, especially not when it comes to the economy.

Experts say the tariffs are likely to drive up prices for American consumers and strain global trade relationships even further.\n\nWhile the markets reacted negatively, Trump spent the weekend at his Mar-a-Lago estate and nearby golf club.

The vain hope is that a down-weapons agreement can be parlayed into a longer-term peace deal.\n\nBut Putin has amassed close to 70,000 troops on Ukraine’s northern border, and may soon launch a renewed assault to carve away (at least) the chunks of Donetsk and Luhansk provinces that Russia has already captured. He might equally use those forces to have a go at Kharkiv, Ukraine’s second city, a half-hour drive from the border with Russia.\n\nAny ceasefire now gives Russian forces time to resupply and reposition. Meanwhile, Putin has tried to sucker America, where secretary of state Marco Rubio has said the US might “walk away” in a matter of days from Donald Trump’s efforts to secure peace.\n\nPerformative frustrations on the part of Trump and his administration over Russia’s real-world rejection of ceasefire terms can be bent into a new narrative, after the Easter “ceasefire”, that Ukraine has also been intransigent.\n\nThe Trump administration is firmly on Russia’s side when it comes to the peace talks. So a sudden offer from the Kremlin of a unilateral ceasefire will have been welcomed by the White House, and is part of the duet Putin and Trump are playing. Trump pretends to be frustrated with Putin, Putin strokes away the irritation with a gesture that has no material effect on the war he started, but which Trump blames on Joe Biden, Nato, Europe, Zelensky – anyone and anything other than Putin.\n\nTrump and Putin are holding the discussions in the space they have created – where they centre on how much of Ukraine Russia will get, and how much of Ukraine’s resources America will extract.\n\nUkraine wants future talks about ending the war to focus on how to get Russia out of its territory. Europe’s main concerns are protecting Ukraine and developing the military capacity to scare Putin away from his oft-spoken desire to force former Soviet-sphere nations in Eastern Europe back into Russia’s portfolio.\n\nThat’s much harder to focus on if, as Putin and Trump want, diplomatic and political effort is diverted into quibbles over fake ceasefires rather than winning the war against Russia.","url":"https://uk.news.yahoo.com/why-putin-easter-ceasefire-dangerous-114841497.html","image":"https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_independent_577/e04575625ff3aa8fdd463bb56c11612a","video":"","publish_date":"2025-04-20 22:16:19","author":"Sam Kiley","authors":["Sam Kiley"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.165},{"id":313087062,"title":"1 Growth Stock Down 20% to Buy Right Now","text":"The current market turmoil has hurt many stocks, but growth players have had a particularly difficult time. This is because these companies rely on a solid economic environment to expand their businesses and lift earnings -- and these days, investors are uncertain about what lies ahead.\n\nThe reason for the market instability? Investors earlier in the year hoped for an improving economy and ongoing interest rate cuts, but President Donald Trump's announcement of tariffs on imports threatened such a scenario. The concern is that the tariffs will increase prices, weighing on both corporate earnings and the overall economy. This past week, Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell said the duties could push inflation higher and might \"move us further away from our goals.\"\n\nAll of this has driven investors away from stocks that are most sensitive to economic growth, with the idea that they might suffer the most in the months to come. But this has also left many of these players trading at bargain levels -- and that signals buying opportunities for long-term investors. Let's check out one growth stock down 20% so far this year that should be on your buy list.\n\nGrowth in return on invested capital\n\nThis particular company operates in both the consumer goods and the technology markets. I'm talking about Amazon (AMZN -1.01%), a leader in e-commerce and cloud computing. Over time, the company has built a strong track record of growth, with earnings and return on invested capital (ROIC) steadily climbing -- with just one exception.\n\nDuring the most recent period of high inflation, Amazon suffered, even shifting to an annual loss in 2022. But the company did something extremely important: It revamped its cost structure to accelerate recovery, and this move also put it in a better position to excel in the future, through any market environment. Amazon returned to profitability a year later and has since seen earnings advance quarter after quarter. I also would like to note that ROIC is once again on the rise, showing that Amazon is benefiting from its investments.\n\nAMZN Return on Invested Capital (Annual) data by YCharts.\n\nAll of this is positive, and combined with Amazon's strong e-commerce business -- offering everything from essentials to general merchandise and entertainment -- positions the company well for long-term growth.\n\nThe potential impact of Trump's tariffs\n\nBut what about the near term? Trump's final tariff plan hasn't yet been established -- the president earlier this month launched tariffs on countries worldwide, then put them on pause for 90 days to allow for negotiations. Tariffs of 145% remain in effect on China, however, and this brings me to the subject of the potential impact on Amazon.\n\nTo some degree, Amazon will face headwinds because it imports certain products from China. This could result in higher prices that Amazon has to absorb or pass on to the consumer. And some third-party sellers on Amazon are based in China; they might decide to no longer sell on the platform if demand for their products drops. This could weigh on Amazon's revenue since the company collects various fees from sellers on its platform.\n\nAt the same time, though, Amazon could see some benefit from tariffs on China as the company also faces competition from e-commerce businesses there, such as Shein, that offer low-cost products. If consumers view these rivals as too expensive due to the tariffs, they could turn to Amazon to purchase alternative items. This could limit some of the negative impact on the e-commerce giant.\n\nIt's also important to remember that Amazon Web Services (AWS), the cloud computing unit, drives the company's overall profit. Though Amazon may face some higher costs here, potentially for hardware, for example, the artificial intelligence (AI) market is booming. So, AWS could still be a significant revenue driver in the coming quarters and years.\n\nSo, yes, Amazon may feel some pressure from the import tariffs, but the company has what it takes to manage challenges -- as it showed us during the recent higher-inflation period -- and long-term prospects remain bright. That's why today, trading for only 27 times forward earnings estimates, Amazon looks very reasonably priced and makes a great stock to buy on the dip.","url":"https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/04/20/1-growth-stock-down-20-to-buy-right-now/?source=askdougpancakes&utm_source=chromefollow&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=news&referring_guid=c350326d-38db-413f-a6e5-738bda041880","image":"https://g.foolcdn.com/image/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fg.foolcdn.com%2Feditorial%2Fimages%2F815138%2Fgettyimages-1147525564.jpg&amp;op=resize&amp;w=1200&amp;h=630","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-20 22:15:00","author":"Adria Cimino","authors":["Adria Cimino"],"language":"en","category":"business","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.049}]}
