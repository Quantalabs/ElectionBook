{"offset":0,"number":50,"available":10451,"news":[{"id":324283930,"title":"Trump signs executive orders to boost nuclear energy","text":"By Kit Maher, CNN\n\n(CNN) — President Donald Trump signed four nuclear energy-related executive orders on Friday that will speed up reactor testing, allow the Departments of Energy and Defense to build nuclear reactors on federally owned land, overhaul the Nuclear Regulatory Commission and boost the United States’ mining and enrichment of uranium, a senior White House official said.\n\nThe president also signed an order to restore what the White House called “gold-standard science,” which comes as the administration has cut billions in federal grants that fund scientific research and slashed staffing at several science-focused agencies.\n\nThe actions come as Trump’s proposed budget calls for cutting over $400 million from the Energy Department’s Office of Nuclear Energy.\n\nInterior Secretary Doug Burgum — who, along with nuclear energy company executives, joined Trump in the Oval Office — lamented what he said has been “over regulation” and heralded venture capital investment in the industry. He went on to praise Trump for committing to “energy dominance” that he said would allow the US to “win the AI arms race with China.”\n\n“What we do in the next five years related to electricity is going to determine the next 50,” he added.\n\nOne nuclear-related executive order speeds up reactor testing at Department of Energy national laboratories, expediting applications and review processes and enabling a pilot program for construction over the next two years, the official told reporters ahead of the Oval Office signing. A second order aims to reduce regulations for the Departments of Energy and Defense to build nuclear reactors on federal land, which the official said would allow “for safe and reliable nuclear energy to power and operate critical defense facilities and AI data centers.”\n\nDefense Secretary Pete Hegseth pointed to what he said is a national security imperative.\n\nA spokesperson for the White House Office of Science and Technology said the new reactors would be “small and advanced.”\n\nTrump will also require the Nuclear Regulatory Commission – the federal body that licenses nuclear reactors – to make decisions on nuclear reactor licenses within 18 months through a third executive order.\n\nA fourth order “is focused on reinvigorating the US nuclear industrial base,” which the official said will allow the US to “start mining and enriching uranium and expanding domestic uranium conversion and enrichment capacities.”\n\nHowever, the US is years away from getting its enrichment capabilities up and running at full capacity. As CNN has reported, until 2023, the US got the vast majority of its enriched uranium from Russia. A bipartisan law passed after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine put a stop to that, and scientists and companies are racing to produce it at home.\n\nTrump wrote that the the administration seeks to “facilitate increased deployment of new nuclear reactor technologies, such as Generation III+ and IV reactors, modular reactors, and microreactors, including by lowering regulatory and cost barriers to entry,” and it also plans to increase US nuclear energy capacity from around 100 gigawatts to 400 gigawatts by 2050.\n\nThe executive orders do not include removing or replacing NRC commission members, the official said. But pressed on if the actions would result in any reduction in staff, the official said, “Reduction in staff is undetermined at this point, but the executive orders do call for a substantial reorganization of the organization.”\n\nThe text of the order reforming the NRC, released later Friday, said that “the current structure and staffing of the NRC are misaligned with the Congress’s directive that the NRC shall not unduly restrict the benefits of nuclear power,” directing them to consult with the Department of Government Efficiency to “reorganize the NRC to promote the expeditious processing of license applications and the adoption of innovative technology.”\n\nDOGE has been synonymous with sweeping cuts across the federal government.\n\nThe order aimed at reforming the NRC also said the organization “has failed to license new reactors even as technological advances promise to make nuclear power safer, cheaper, more adaptable, and more abundant than ever,” and calls for them to “adopt science-based radiation limits.”\n\n“Instead of efficiently promoting safe, abundant nuclear energy, the NRC has instead tried to insulate Americans from the most remote risks without appropriate regard for the severe domestic and geopolitical costs of such risk aversion,” the order stated.\n\nAsked about the timeline of getting new reactors online, the official said that the administration is looking to test and deploy nuclear reactors within the remainder of Trump’s term.\n\nCNN’s Ella Nilsen contributed to this report.\n\nThe-CNN-Wire™ & © 2025 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros.

Mary Trump, 60, is desperate to stop her uncle from \"destroying [her] country\" and says it \"fills [her] with horror\" he remains in power. She even fears the former businessman, who is her father Fred Jr's younger brother, is determined to secure a third spell - at least - in charge of the US, even if it breaches the constitution . But Mary, who is a clinical psychologist, said the Democrats need to step up their game, insisting the party \"fail to understand the moment\" right now. Her uncle, after all, was voted in by the majority of the US public last November , and now the markets even suggest he'd win another election - constitutional limit aside - if one was called today . Yet Mary, talking to journalists during her first visit to the UK since the 1990s, remains critical of Mr Trump. She said: \"I mean, as we say in America, he's always been an a--hole. Right?... We can laugh at him, sure. And mock him and say that he doesn't know what he's doing or that he's in some kind of cognitive decline. I'm not disputing any of those claims. I make them myself. But the point of the matter is he still is the president of the United States of America, which fills me with horror.\" In her podcast this week with The Telegraph , Mary refers to her book, published in 2020, specifically about Mr Trump, Too Much and Never Enough. It sold 1.4million copies in its first week. The opinions shared in this remain some five years on. Mary, who lists Hillary Clinton as one of her political heroes, continued: \"I can't let him destroy my country... I'm very clear-eyed about this. There is no pulling punches here, we are way past the point of being polite or playing by the old rules. \"The old rules don't exist because the Republican party doused them in gasoline and set them on fire. Democrats haven't caught up with that yet. We cannot continue to extend the benefit of the doubt to somebody who has proven time and time again he's unworthy of it. So this continues to matter to me because he continues to have power.\" But Mary, who is a writer, concedes defating The Donald won't be an easy feat. Describing her uncle as \"a very troubled man\", Mary added: \"He is an instinctual creature who does what he does to get what he needs or wants. It's really that simple, understanding what drives him and why understanding his psychological make-up matters because that's how we figure out how to deal with him.\"","summary":"Donald Trump's enemies are hungry to open the eyes of all who support him, but his fans say the US President is the antidote to the &quot;established way&quot; which they say failed","url":"https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/politics/donald-trump-branded-ahole-niece-35280721","image":"https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/article35280725.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200b/1_President-Trump-Signs-Executive-Orders-At-The-White-House.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-05-24 00:58:36","author":"Bradley Jolly","authors":["Bradley Jolly"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"GB","sentiment":-0.227},{"id":324281588,"title":"Trump announces Nippon Steel-U.S. Steel ‘partnership’ deal","text":"U.S. President Donald Trump has announced a “partnership” between Nippon Steel and U.S. Steel, with press reports indicating that this signals the approval of a takeover of the iconic American company by the Japanese steelmaker. “I am proud to announce that, after much consideration and negotiation, U.S. Steel will REMAIN in America, and keep its Headquarters in the Great City of Pittsburgh,” Trump wrote in a Truth Social post Friday. “This will be a planned partnership between United States Steel and Nippon Steel, which will create at least 70,000 jobs, and add $$14 Billion to the U.S. Economy,” Trump continued, while adding the investment will occur in the next 14 months.","summary":"Media reports said the agreement signaled the approval of a takeover of the iconic American company by the Japanese steelmaker.","url":"https://www.japantimes.co.jp/business/2025/05/24/companies/trump-us-steel-nippon-steel-partnership/","image":"https://www.japantimes.co.jp/japantimes/uploads/images/2025/05/24/471079.JPG?v=3.1","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-05-24 00:56:00","author":"Francis Tang,Web Master","authors":["Francis Tang","Web Master"],"language":"en","source_country":"jp","sentiment":0.352},{"id":324283394,"title":"Donald Trump threatens Apple and other smartphone makers with 25% tariff unless they build devices in US","text":"US President Donald Trump on Friday threatened Apple and other smartphone manufacturers with a 25 percent tariff unless their devices are built in the United States.Trump initially said the tariff would apply only to Apple -- an unusual move to single out a specific company in trade policy. However, he later expanded the threat to include all smartphone makers. It would be also Samsung and anybody that makes that product, otherwise it wouldn't be fair, Trump told reporters in Washington, adding that the new tariffs would take effect by the end of June. While Apple designs its products in the United States, most iPhone assembly occurs in China, which remains embroiled in a trade war with the United States. Apple has announced plans to shift some production to other countries, including India, but Trump said this would not satisfy his demands.In a post on Truth Social, Trump wrote that he had long ago informed Tim Cook of Apple that I expect their iPhones that will be sold in the United States of America will be manufactured and built in the United States, not India, or anyplace else. If that is not the case, a Tariff of at least 25 percent must be paid by Apple to the US, he added.Trump's comments echoed statements he made during a trip to Qatar last week, when he urged Apple to bring iPhone production stateside. I had a little problem with Tim Cook, Trump said on May 15.He recounted how he told Apple's CEO: We're not interested in you building in India... we want you to build here and they're going to be upping their production in the United States. Apple's main rival, South Korea's Samsung, finds itself in a similar situation, with most of its production in Vietnam, China and India.Apple and Samsung account for about 80 percent of smartphone sales in the United States. Smaller players including Google, Xiaomi and Motorola also have most of their handsets made abroad.'Fairy tale'Analysts widely agree that shifting iPhone manufacturing to the United States is unrealistic and would require a fundamental overhaul of Apple's business model -- a process that could take years, if it's possible at all. According to Wedbush Securities estimates, about 90 percent of Apple's iPhone production and assembly remains based in China despite some production shifts.Reshoring iPhone production to the United States is a fairy tale that is not feasible, Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives said in a research note.The constant pressure from the White House has taken a toll on Apple's stock price, which has fallen more than 20 percent since Trump took office in January with his protectionist agenda. Apple shares closed down 3.0 percent in New York on Friday. Unlike during Trump's first term, when Apple received exceptions from China-focused trade measures, the company has become a regular presidential target this time around.Cook warned last month about the uncertain impact of threatened US tariffs on Chinese products, which at one point were hiked to 145 percent, despite temporary relief for high-end tech goods like smartphones. He said Apple expects US tariffs to cost it $900 million in the current quarter. Prices of handsets look set to rise, given iPhones will end up being more expensive, if the threats turn into concrete trade policy, said Susannah Streeter, an analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown. While die-hard fans will still be prepared to pay big bucks for Apple's kit, it'll be much harder for the middle-class masses who are already dealing with price hikes on other goods, from Nike trainers to toys sold in Walmart. Last week, the United States and China agreed to suspend sweeping tariffs on each other's goods for 90 days, marking a temporary de-escalation in the trade war.","summary":"US President Donald Trump on Friday threatened Apple and other smartphone manufacturers with a 25 percent tariff unless their devices are built in the United States.

We want to clarify what the truth was and what actually happened. India wants to specifically give the message that India refuses to be blackmailed by the threat of nuclear weapons. We will fight for our integrity. We will stand as one against terror attacks. So this is the message we wanted to reach to the world, and of course we've worked with Russia for many years, and we would seek the understanding of Russia and we would hope that they will be in a position to be able to support us very strongly because I think they know beyond doubt that India stands for peace.\"\nDuring the event, AAP MP Ashok Kumar Mittal slammed Pakistan and said that Pakistan is not only nourishing terrorism but is also nurturing, supporting and promoting terrorism throughout the world.\nHe added, \"Whole world is suffering because of the terrorism being nurtured by Pakistan.

We take their agriculture — it’s like a one way street with them. \n\n“The European Union is very, very nasty.”\n\nHe went on to complain that the EU sues American companies, citing cases against west coast tech giants Apple, Google and Facebook.\n\nTrump has previously also branded the EU “an atrocity” for not importing enough American cars, food and goods.\n\nUS Treasury Secretary Scott Bessen said on Friday that Trump does not believe the EU’s trade offers to the US are good enough, and that he hopes the threat of 50 percent tariffs will “light a fire under the EU”.\n\nRepresentatives from the 27 EU countries are due to meet to discuss trade in Brussels later in the day.\n\nTrump’s stop-and-start global trade war, which kicked off on his much trumpeted “Liberation Day”, has rattled markets over the past few weeks.\n\nOn April 2 he announced a barrage of sky-high tariffs for countries around the world – with a baseline 10 percent applied to every nation.\n\nAt that time, the EU was hit with a 20-percent rate.\n\nShortly afterwards, the White House paused most of the tariffs for 90 days – except for those against China – to allow for trade talks.\n\nHowever, the 10-percent base rate widely remained, and is what currently applies to the EU.\n\nChina and the US locked horns in an escalating trade war before Trump called time and dramatically slashed the tax to 30 percent.\n\nLindsay James, an investment strategist at Quilter, said: “What is somewhat of a surprise is the fact that the EU will now face a considerably higher tariff rate than China, an almost unthinkable scenario just a matter of weeks ago.\n\n“It is highlighting that much of this policy is designed to be punitive, rather than having any economic credibility to it.”\n\nBritain became the first country in the world carve out a trade deal with the US after Trump’s tariff blitz.\n\nThe US President hailed the agreement as “historic”, and claimed it was possible only because of Brexit.\n\nThere was welcome relief for British carmakers who no longer pay 25 per cent tariffs, and steelmakers who have been spared duties.\n\nBut most UK goods heading to the US still face ten per cent tariffs — meaning we remain worse off than before the President began his onslaught.\n\nThe US President has called on the UK to copy his “drill, baby drill” policy” to reap the benefits of 100 years of supplies left to bring down energy costs.\n\nIn an attack on green policies, Trump said that Britain must “stop with the costly and unsightly windmills” and focus on the drilling.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nFormer President Donald Trump has sparked the trade conflict between the United&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Trump Re-initiates Trade War with EU, Threatens 50% Tariffs After Striking Deal with Post-Brexit UK first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/news/us/trump-re-initiates-trade-war-with-eu-threatens-50-tariffs-after-striking-deal-with-post-brexit-uk/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Trump-reignites-trade-war-with-hated-EU-as-he-issues.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-05-24 00:32:47","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.159},{"id":324279456,"title":"'Beautiful Bill' moots decade-long pause on AI-related state laws","text":"US president Donald Trump's One Big Beautiful Bill , passed by the House of Representatives on Thursday, brought in a whole host of changes, from tax breaks and immigration crackdowns to tweaking welfare programmes. But it also had a significant AI-related provision snuck in - a 10-year moratorium on AI-related state legislations. If the bill is now passed by the Senate and approved by the president, it would enact one of the most consequential federal tech policy actions in years. The provision has sparked a debate between those opposing a patchwork of state laws and those calling to address harms in the absence of a federal AI law. The bill talks about how the commerce department may use funds to leverage AI for operational efficiency and cybersecurity. It then adds that no state or political subdivision may enforce any regulations on AI models or automated decision systems for a 10-year period after enactment of the bill. This does not apply to regulations that are aimed at removing legal impediments to AI deployment and enabling adoption and procurement of the technology, it says. It also does not curb regulations that don't impose any substantive design, performance, data-handling, documentation, civil liabilities, taxation or other requirements on AI systems. The moratorium is seen as benefiting the technology industry, many of whom have called for a regulatory environment that fosters freedom to innovate. The industry appreciates the government's recognition that a patchwork of state laws on AI could jeopardise national AI priorities, said Jason Oxman, president and CEO of tech industry body ITI Council, in a letter to a subcommittee involved in the legislation on Wednesday. The technology industry is increasingly concerned about the growing number of state legislative proposals to regulate AI, Oxman wrote, adding that competing state regulations could hamper efficiency gains possible from greater government adoption of AI. There is a risk that a tidal wave of state legislative activity could undermine our shared goals of American technological preeminence. ITI, which counts Microsoft, Google, IBM, Accenture, Adobe, Meta and OpenAI among its members, advocated for a unified, risk-based standard for AI development and deployment that avoids conflicting state-level regulation. Tech giant Google in a March submission regarding the US government's AI Action Plan which aims to strengthen US leadership in AI, said that it should preempt a chaotic patchwork of state-level rules on frontier AI development. ChatGPT-maker OpenAI proposed a holistic approach that enables voluntary partnership between the federal government and the private sector, without American AI companies having to comply with overly burdensome state laws . Analysts say that the bill reflects the administration's deregulatory approach. On the other hand, in the run up to this bill being introduced, a group of 40 attorney generals of states like California, Colorado, Washington, New Jersey, and others wrote to US Congress officials opposing the moratorium. Such a broad moratorium would be sweeping and wholly destructive of reasonable state efforts to prevent known harms associated with AI, they said. In contrast to the EU, which has an overarching AI law, the US which has no federal AI law was seen as having a light-touch approach. But in reality, AI-related bills in US states have been ballooning. A report by tech industry body BSA, the Software Alliance, showed that in 2024, nearly 700 AI-related bills were introduced across 45 US states. About 113 have been enacted. In 2023, there were under 200 such bills in states. The momentum was expected to carry into 2025 as well. Colorado was the first to pass comprehensive legislation to address high-risk uses of AI. States like California and Tennessee have enacted targeted reforms to address specific issues such as data provenance and digital replicas. Forty-three states considered legislation to address issues around AI and deepfakes. Of over 300 such pieces of legislation introduced, 71 were enacted into law. In India, neither central nor state governments have introduced AI legislation. The government expects existing laws and sectoral regulations to be sufficient in tackling harms. Officials have said that AI legislation may be introduced in future if the need arises.","summary":"A bill passed by the House proposes a 10-year moratorium on state AI regulations, sparking debate over innovation versus addressing potential harms.

Long arm of Trump law may not pluck Apple off India","text":"US President Donald Trump on Friday threatened to impose “at least” 25% tariff on iPhones sold in the country unless they are made in America, and “not in India, or anyplace else”. The development, which came a week after he said he had told Apple CEO Tim Cook not to build in India, could dampen the fast-paced growth of India’s electronics manufacturing services, said experts.Apple shares plunged more than 4% to a low of $193.46 on the Nasdaq after Trump’s statement.“I have long ago informed Tim Cook of Apple that I expect their iPhones that will be sold in the United States of America will be manufactured and built in the United States, not India, or anyplace else. If that is not the case, a tariff of at least 25% must be paid by Apple to the US,” Trump said in a post on Truth Social.The move, if implemented, would hit the Cupertino-based firm, which has been seeking to diversify its production base beyond China, as well as India’s electronics manufacturing services ecosystem, which has been supporting not only phone manufacturers but also hundreds of ancillary and downstream component makers beginning to set up shop in the country, according to experts.Shifting Apple’s manufacturing to the US would not be a feasible solution, though, they said, since that would increase the cost of the iPhone to $3,000 on average from the current price of around $1000 owing to the high cost of labour in the US.Most of the iPhones sold in the US currently are made in India. Apple’s assembly lines in India churned out smartphones worth $22 billion in 2024-25, with a 60% year-on-year increase in output.Some experts also said that Trump’s statement appeared to be a negotiation tactic to secure a more favourable trade deal with India.“Trump’s posturing of a potential 25% tariff on ‘Made in India’ Apple phones will certainly be a dampener on Apple’s India plans,” said Jaijit Bhattacharya, president, Centre for Digital Economy Policy Research. “It brings in regulatory uncertainty for Apple, which in itself is extremely detrimental. Apple was signalled to move out of China into trusted supply chain locations such as India. As it started ramping up in India, conflicting signals have emerged from the US administration.”He said the outcome would be significant uncertainty for Apple, impacting the company’s ability to build a resilient supply chain and serve the market.Anurag Agrawal, founder of Techaisle, said, “Trump's past actions indicate a willingness to impose tariffs to push for domestic production, and his recent comments suggest he is not pleased with Apple’s move to diversify manufacturing to India. Therefore, some form of targeted tariffs remains a possibility. While Trump can impose tariffs, previous threats have often been used as negotiating tactics, and exemptions for electronics (including iPhones) have been granted before.”A section of industry executives, however, said the US administration’s move to slap tariffs on Apple would not halt India’s strides in electronics manufacturing services. India is primarily involved in assembly and even within that India's piece of the pie is under $40,” said Raja Manickam, founder of the fabless chip startup iVP Semiconductor and the former CEO of Tata Electronics. “Finally, I do see that sense will prevail and that Apple will reason with the US government that at least 50% or more of their value addition comes in from chips, IP and software by American companies.”ET’s queries sent to Apple remained unanswered till press time. The notion of Apple moving iPhone assembly to the US is less a concrete strategy and more of a negotiating tool, especially in the context of US-India trade dynamics, Sanyam Chaurasia, technology market analyst at Canalys Research said. Realistically, even if Apple were to shift assembly stateside, it would take several years and involve significant cost implications. He said Trump appears to be using Apple as a 'bargaining chip' in tariff negotiations with India. It’s more a political gesture than a realistic plan. I expect to see more of this as pressure builds to secure favorable terms in the bilateral trade agreement, he said. Apple has increasingly chosen India as an alternative to China, where it has massive operations, especially after the Covid-19 pandemic, realising that over-reliance on a single production base could put its supply chain in jeopardy. In line with growing demand, the company’s suppliers such as Foxconn and Tata Electronics have been expanding their India manufacturing footprint.","summary":"Donald Trump may impose tariffs on iPhones not manufactured in America.

I cannot imagine how surreal – and frightening – it must be for many who live in a country where the people in power do not even pretend that truth matters.\nFrom alleging that trade talks with China had taken place last month, which Beijing denied, to taking credit for brokering the recent ceasefire between India and Pakistan, a claim that India has rejected, we do not know who or what to believe any more.\nWhereas the US was once the “city upon a hill” that many countries looked up to, its global reputation is now in tatters, stained by the countless lies that the US president has fed Americans and the rest of the world. The Washington Post counted 30,573 falsehoods, and that was only during Trump’s first presidential term from 2017 to 2021.\nHow does Trump get away with it? How is it possible that tens of millions of the Maga faithful continue to buy into his bellicose and cruel vision for the country and believe in his lies, some of which are so hilariously ludicrous that they would not fool anyone with the barest modicum of intelligence?\nPart of this absurd state of affairs has to do with Trump’s enablers. Unlike his first term, when at least some of his political appointees had expertise in their portfolios, Trump has surrounded himself with sycophants whose only quality is their personal loyalty to him.\nInstead of calling out the blatant, at times bizarre, falsehoods spewed by their boss-patron, Trump’s obsequious acolytes and the entire Republican Party apparatus choose to toe the line, however ridiculous that line often is.\n\nZhao Gao (258–207BC) was a politician of considerable cunning and ambition in ancient China. When he was young he was punished by being physically maimed, some say castrated, for a crime his mother had committed.\nHowever, he managed to win the favour of the first emperor of the Qin dynasty, who entrusted him with the tutelage of his son Huhai.\nWhen the emperor died in 210BC, Zhao seized his moment. He and a co-conspirator forged a decree that ordered the death of the emperor’s eldest son and heir, Fusu, and installed the younger son, Huhai, on the throne as the second emperor. Zhao appointed himself counsellor-in-chief, a position akin to a prime minister.\nThe second emperor, being young and rather pliable, gave Zhao free rein in the running of the empire. Not content with his high position in the imperial court, Zhao began to entertain thoughts of taking the throne himself. The only snag was that the other ministers might not be entirely on board with his move. So Zhao devised a test of loyalty.\nOne day, he brought a deer along on an outing with the imperial entourage. When the young emperor saw it, he asked: “Is that a deer?” Zhao replied, with a perfectly straight face: “That is not a deer, Your Majesty. It is a horse.”\nThe emperor blinked. “That is clearly a deer,” he said. Zhao insisted: “If Your Majesty doubts what I say, ask the others.”\n\nSome ministers, for whom facts and personal integrity did matter, said: “It is a deer.” Others, smelling danger and opportunity, said: “That is surely a horse.”\nSubsequently, Zhao punished all those who called a deer a deer, and elevated the ministers who “referred to a deer as a horse”, an idiom now used to describe someone who deliberately distorts the truth for personal gain.\nRight now, there are too many people in America who see a horse, or share in the mass delusion of seeing one.\n\nIt is exasperating that many of them try to explain away the lies by insisting that there is method in Trump’s madness, when the rest of us only see the actions and rants of a 78-year-old man with the intelligence and temperament of a spoiled teenager, if that.","summary":"Donald Trump’s lies are so ludicrous only idiots or lapdogs could believe them.

It's not taking place here at the White House.\"\n\nThe White House did not immediately respond on Friday to a request for comment from ABC News.\n\nCherry Hsu, an executive at MemeCore, a Singapore-based blockchain startup, said the firm's founder, known publicly as \"Ice,\" had also been invited to the White House on Friday afternoon. MemeCore, according to the contest leaderboard, finished second in the competition with $TRUMP coin holdings in excess of $1 million.\n\nAnd late Friday, Justin Sun, a Chinese crupto mogul and the top investor in Trump’s meme coin, posted a highly produced video of his White House tour, writing on X, “Was an honor to be invited to tour the @WhiteHouse. Such a privilege to see it in person.”\n\nIn addition to his multimillion-dollar investment in $TRUMP, Sun has also invested $75 million in World Liberty Financial, another Trump-backed crypto venture. One month after that investment, SEC lawyers under the Trump administration moved to halt an alleged fraud case against Sun.\n\nThe Trump meme coin's website at one point earlier this month advertised a \"Special VIP White House tour\" for the top 25 meme coin holders as part of the contest -- but as of last week, the site said only that a \"Special VIP tour\" would be arranged, without mentioning the White House.\n\nThe site also included a disclaimer saying the tour was being arranged by the Fight Fight Fight LLC, and that the president himself would be appearing as a \"guest.\"","summary":"Some investors in President Trump's meme coin were expected to visit the White House Friday, despite officials saying a gala for them was outside Trump's official duties.","url":"https://abcnews.go.com/US/trumps-top-meme-coin-investors-invited-white-house/story?id=122128541","image":"https://i.abcnewsfe.com/a/2c697f28-8439-48f3-a4ae-62ee5151c35e/donald-trump-25-gty-gmh-250523_1748026207790_hpMain_16x9.jpg?w=1600","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-05-24 00:05:39","author":"Lucien Bruggeman,Olivia Rubin","authors":["Lucien Bruggeman","Olivia Rubin"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.063},{"id":324275198,"title":"Deportation effort escalates, with agents making arrests outside San Diego immigration courtrooms","text":"The moment a 38-year-old man from Venezuela walked out of the San Diego immigration courtroom Thursday, immigration agents were waiting in the hallway to take him into custody in handcuffs.\n\nThe man, an asylum seeker, still had an open case before the court. But that didn’t seem to matter.\n\nHe was among about 11 people arrested on Thursday following their immigration hearings at the Edward J. Schwartz Federal Building in downtown San Diego, part of a nationwide rollout of the Trump administration’s latest tactic to increase deportations.\n\n“I was in complete shock,” his immigration attorney Leslie Santos said of the sudden arrest.\n\nImmigration and Customs Enforcement has begun detaining people in federal courthouses around the country, according to multiple news reports. The arrests continued Friday, with nine taken into custody, immigrant advocates said.\n\nPresident Donald Trump signed an executive order in January that expands expedited removal. The American Civil Liberties Union has challenged the plan in court, and the government has filed a motion to dismiss the case.\n\nUnder the policy, undocumented immigrants unable to prove that they have lived in the United States for at least two years are subject to expedited removal proceedings. Because of this process, in certain cases, people could be removed from the country without a hearing before an immigration judge.\n\n“Most aliens who illegally entered the United States within the past two years are subject to expedited removals,” the Department of Homeland Security said in a statement Friday when asked about the courthouse arrests. “(President Joe) Biden ignored this legal fact and chose to release millions of illegal aliens, including violent criminals, into the country with a notice to appear before an immigration judge. ICE is now following the law and placing these illegal aliens in expedited removal, as they always should have been.”\n\nDHS said “credible” asylum cases would continue to go forward.\n\n“If they have a valid credible fear claim, they will continue in immigration proceedings,” the agency said, “but if no valid claim is found, aliens will be subject to a swift deportation.\n\nWhile many of the people arrested outside the courtroom in San Diego had their immigration cases dismissed by a judge in the moments leading to their detentions, according to the San Diego Immigrant Rights Consortium, Santos’ client did not.\n\nThe Venezuelan, whom Santos did not fully identify because she had not been able to ask his permission, fled his country to escape persecution as an LGBTQ man, the attorney said. Since entering the United States, he has lived in San Diego without any criminal issues, she said.\n\nHe arrived in the U.S. in June 2024 using the CBP One mobile application, which was required under the Biden administration for asylum seekers to legally present themselves at a port of entry for screening.\n\nAs the ICE agents handcuffed Santos’ client in the hallway, she asked them why he was being detained if his case had not yet been terminated. Even though government attorneys had requested a dismissal of the case, Santos opposed it, so the judge granted a 10-day extension to respond to the motion, she said.\n\n“These actions are a deliberate attempt to crush the human spirit and undermine the very principle that our asylum laws are meant to uphold,” Crystal Felix, legal representative for the Immigrant Rights Consortium and an American Immigration Lawyers Association San Diego Chapter member, said in a statement. “It’s also a staggering waste of court resources — cases are scheduled, prepared, and then gutted at the last minute, showing blatant disregard for due process and efficiency.”\n\nWord of arrests started coming in Wednesday, when a 22-year-old man from Venezuela was arrested as he exited the courtroom where his case had been dismissed by a judge, said his attorney, Michael Hirman. The man was only identified as José due to safety concerns.\n\nHe said José was a former military officer in Venezuela who was ordered to go against those who opposed the government. He refused, and he was tortured, Hirman said. He arrived at the U.S.-Mexico border in January and asked for asylum.\n\nHirman said he was surprised that the government moved to dismiss the case. He thought it was good news, as it would allow them to file a petition for him to remain in the country with U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, since there was no longer a case in immigration court.\n\nBut as José hugged his extended family after the hearing, immigration officers approached him in the hallway. “It went from that to seeing them putting him into handcuffs and taking him away,” Hirman said.\n\nHe said that his client had a credible fear interview after his arrest, and he is hopeful that he will get another hearing.\n\nWith that arrest, immigrant advocates and attorneys were on notice.\n\nOn Thursday morning, Ruth, a volunteer who asked not to be fully identified for fear of retaliation, accompanied an asylum seeker from Colombia to his court hearing — something volunteers have been doing for a long time to support migrants without legal representation. Eventually, she and other volunteers noticed immigration officers arriving in the hallway to detain people.\n\nThe Colombian man, who arrived in the U.S. about a year ago and did not have an attorney, was among at least three people whom immigration advocates said were arrested during Thursday morning. Like Santos, his case had not yet been terminated by a judge before being detained, Ruth said.\n\n“He did his part and came here in good faith,” she said of the migrant.\n\nThe advocates then suspected that ICE was targeting individuals without legal representation, so they contacted immigration attorneys.\n\n“This level, this show of force is very unusual,” Ginger Jacobs, an immigration attorney who showed up to provide assistance and pro bono representation to immigrants, said of the ICE presence. She said that in her 23 years as an immigration attorney, she had never seen anything like the scene that was unfolding outside the courtrooms.\n\nBy afternoon, attorneys and advocates had pointed out that it didn’t seem to matter if the immigrant had legal representation or not to the dozen ICE agents in the hallway. What the migrants did appear to have in common was that they arrived in the country less than two years ago.\n\n“My biggest concern is due process,” Jacobs said. “Are these people going to get a fair hearing? If they were already in immigration court proceedings, are these proceedings going to continue?”\n\nDozens of people watched and some recorded on their cellphones as immigration agents, with what appeared to be some kind of list in hand, handcuffed about a dozen immigrants as they exited different courtrooms inside the building throughout the day. Agents warned that they would be arrested if they interfered with an arrest.\n\nOne man began to hyperventilate while handcuffed on the ground after being detained. His attorney repeatedly asked the officers to show him a warrant. While the man was on the ground surrounded by officers, it became clear that he was not the person they were looking for, and they released him.\n\n“Today was messy, it was ugly,” Michelle Celleri, legal rights director with the nonprofit Alliance San Diego, said Thursday.\n\nCelleri praised the quick intervention of lawyers and volunteers who monitored the situation. But now, she believes the threat of detention in court could change migrants’ habits, forcing them further into the shadows.\n\n“There will most certainly be fear in the community to show up,” she said. “However, people do need to show up to their hearings. If they do not show up, there will be an order of removal in their absence.”","summary":"The Trump administration is focusing on immigrants in the U.S. less than two years","url":"https://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/2025/05/23/deportation-effort-escalates-with-agents-making-arrests-outside-san-diego-immigration-courtrooms/","image":"https://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/SUT-L-COURT-ARRESTS-02.jpg?w=1024&h=768","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-05-24 00:05:12","author":"Alexandra Mendoza","authors":["Alexandra Mendoza"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.603},{"id":324274970,"title":"Chilling Emails Reveal Unexpected Side of Gunman Who Targeted Trump","text":"Haunting new emails show the gunman who tried to murder Donald Trump at a rally in Pennsylvania was also designing a bomb.\n\nThomas Matthew Crooks, 20, killed two and shot the then-GOP presidential candidate in the ear at the event in Butler on July 13, 2024.\n\nThe FBI investigation into Crooks, who authorities have confirmed was not linked to any foreign conspiracy, has unveiled additional details about his assassination attempt.\n\nAt the time, he was working on applications to a four-year engineering course at community college.\n\nMeanwhile, using an encrypted email, he had ordered over two gallons of nitromethane from Hyperfuels.\n\nTwelve days post-ordering, Crooks sent a follow-up message inquiring about the shipment’s status. ‘Hello, my name is Thomas. I made a purchase on your website on January 19.\n\nI haven’t received any updates regarding the order’s dispatch and was curious if it is still pending and when I might anticipate its arrival,’ he mentioned on January 31 at 7:44 a.m.\n\nThe feds were able to access his email because he sent it from an account tied to Community College of Allegheny County where he attended. \n\nMuch was made of what Crooks, an apparent registered Republican who also donated to Joe Biden, thought politically.\n\nThe emails show a young man deeply critical of federal government, including an essay blaming NASA administrators for the 1986 Challenger disaster and praise of a George Orwell essay that warned ‘against adopting imperialistic policies.’\n\nThe one known mention of Trump comes in an essay praising nuclear energy and criticizing Trump pulling out of the Iran nuclear agreement during his first term.\n\nHe briefly mentioned Biden in reviewing a 2021 Washington Post op-ed that argued against the then-president’s proposal to make community college tuition free. \n\nWally Zimolong, who chased down the records on behalf of Trump aide Stephen Miller’s America First Legal, said ‘a year later we still don’t know enough’ about Crooks. \n\n‘I think it raises a lot of important questions. Were they investigating anyone else? Are they still investigating?’ Zimolong asked.\n\nHowever, of the hundreds of emails from his college account that have been viewed, very little else reveals much about the shooting but does give a look at the life Crooks was living. \n\nOne missive shows Crooks emailing his professor asking if he can only bring two or three adults to a presentation that asked him to bring five.\n\n‘I do not have access to any other adults’ aside from his parents and his sister, he writes. \n\nOtherwise, Crooks is painted as an A-level student who professes his enjoyment for the fall season and stayed in contact with his professors. \n\n‘It’s sad that he had so much promise and he chose to do this. It’s just very difficult to understand where it came from,’ Patricia Thompson, one of his professors, said. \n\nOnline theories swirled that Crooks was part of a large foreign-influenced plot to take out the Republican before the 2024 presidential election, which he went on to win. \n\nCrooks was on top of a nearby building a few hundred feet from where Trump was speaking that day, crouched down with an AR-15 rifle. \n\nHe was able to fire eight rounds in Trump’s direction less than 150 yards from where the former president was speaking. \n\nCrooks was killed by counter snipers who took him out before he was able to reap more damage at the Trump rally.\n\nA series of failures by the U.S. Secret Service ultimately allowed would-be assassin Thomas Matthew Crooks to successfully land a shot in Donald Trump’s right ear, a new report reveals. \n\nAgents found him in their sights and one pulled the trigger seconds after the 20-year-old shot dead Pennsylvania fire chief Corey Comperatore and hit Trump in the right ear from his vantage point 147 yards away.\n\n‘They were looking at him while he was looking at them,’ a senior federal law enforcement official told CNN.\n\nVideo shows Crooks peering intently through the sights of his father’s AR-style weapon and firing towards the rally as onlookers scream from the base of the building.\n\nInstantly a second volley of shots is heard and Crooks is pictured lying dead on the roof as those on the ground gasp in horror.\n\n‘The Secret Service don’t f*** around man,’ one exclaims. ‘Holy s***.’\n\nHe had clambered up building’s air conditioning system and hoisted himself onto the roof where MAGA fans saw him ‘bear-crawling’ across the sloping surface with his rifle, and warned law enforcement of the danger.\n\n‘I’m thinking to myself ‘Why is Trump still speaking, why have they not pulled him off the stage?,’ one witness told the BBC. ‘The next thing you know, five shots ring out.’\n\nCrooks was a dietary aide at Bethel Park Skilled Nursing and Rehabilitation Center – where he provided food and care for post-hospital elderly and sick people.\n\n‘We are shocked and saddened to learn of his involvement as Thomas Matthew Crooks performed his job without concern and his background check was clean,’ administrator Marcie Grimm said in a statement.\n\nA colleague at the facility said Crooks never expressed political views at work and wasn’t a ‘radical’.\n\n‘It’s hard seeing everything that’s going on online because he was a really, really good person that did a really bad thing, and I just wish I knew why,’ he added.\n\nThe would-be assassin was a registered Republican and 2022 high school graduate. Records show he donated on the day of the 2020 inauguration to a progressive group backing Biden.\n\nHe graduated from the Community College of Allegheny County in May with an associate degree in engineering science, according to school officials who said they were ‘shocked and saddened by the horrific turn of events’.\n\nCrooks’ father Matthew was seen on Tuesday morning for the first time since the shooting as he opened the door of the family home to FBI agents.\n\nA neighbor of Crooks’ sister Katie said her brother helped her move into her nearby apartment three years ago, describing her as a ‘hardworking’ woman who worked as a janitor at a local high school and as a server at a restaurant.\n\nBoth of Crooks’ parents are behavioral therapists and Crooks’ father said he was baffled by his son’s actions.\n\nOne troubling finding from the bipartisan Senate investigation was how technical issues downed Secret Service drones during the July 13 rally in Butler, Pennsylvania.\n\nThe agent responsible for overseeing the Counter Unmanned Aircraft Systems (C-UAS) called a toll free 888 tech support hotline ‘to start troubleshooting with the company.’ There were no backups.\n\nIt took several hours to get the drones back up and running – and the agent responsible for the drone operations only had three months of experience with the equipment.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nHaunting new emails show the gunman who tried to murder Donald Trump&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Chilling Emails Reveal Unexpected Side of Gunman Who Targeted Trump first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/news/chilling-emails-reveal-unexpected-side-of-gunman-who-targeted-trump/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Haunting-new-emails-show-very-different-side-to-gunman-who.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-05-24 00:02:44","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.251},{"id":324283804,"title":"Jake Tapper calls out Trump, says he 'has not been transparent about his health records'","text":"CNN's Jake Tapper, co-author of the new book on the alleged cover-up of former President Joe Biden’s health decline, says President Donald Trump is not forthcoming with his health information. \"I just think in general, not Trump specific, but in general, I think that the press corps, and I‘m certainly including myself, needs to worry less about politeness when it comes to these health issues and needs to be even more aggressive when it comes to demanding transparency on health issues,\" Tapper said Thursday on \"The Situation Room with Wolf Blitzer.\" On Tuesday, Tapper’s book, \"Original Sin,\" co-authored with Axios journalist Alex Thompson, was published. BIDEN INSIDER WAS REPORTEDLY 'AMAZED' AT THE MEDIA COVERAGE THEY WERE ABLE TO SPIN The book looks in part at the efforts made by top Biden aides and allies to hide the truth about Biden’s mental and physical health, providing a depiction of a president who was routinely addled during his term. During his discussion with co-author Thompson and Blitzer, Tapper said he doesn’t think Trump, 78, is being fully open about his own health. \"When it comes to the president, President Trump, while he appears healthy, he has not been transparent about his health records,\" Tapper said. \"And I think that that‘s something that the American people have a right to.\" Tapper has received mounting criticism from observers who believe he was part of the alleged cover-up by dismissing and underreporting clear signs of Biden's decline, like the rest of the liberal media. The CNN anchor has been on multiple shows admitting to failures in how the reporting on Biden’s health was done, and critics have said he is now profiting off that failure. On April 13, 2025, the White House released the results of Trump’s physical exam conducted on April 11. RESULTS OF PRESIDENT TRUMP'S PHYSICAL RELEASED, HERE'S WHAT THEY SAY \"President Donald J. Trump underwent his annual physical examination at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center,\" Navy Capt. Sean P. Barbabella, the physician to the president, said in a statement released by the White House. \"I performed and supervised the comprehensive exam, which included diagnostic and laboratory testing, as well as consultations with fourteen specialty consultants, all in accordance with U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommendations,\" Barbabella added. \"The President has consented to release the physical exam findings to the public.\" The summary of the examination noted that Trump \"remains in excellent health, exhibiting robust cardiac, pulmonary, neurological, and general physical function,\" and that his \"active lifestyle continues to contribute significantly to his well-being.\" In June 2024, the Wall Street Journal published its explosive story about how some lawmakers began questioning Biden's health, and the debate surrounding the issue became increasingly heated, with staff and lawmakers insisting that Biden was in good health, although some have since come out and shared stories that made them doubt that he was healthy. Rep. Mike Quigley, D-Ill., told Tapper of his trip with Biden to the Emerald Isle in April 2023 that reminded him of his own ailing father, who had Parkinson’s. On Sunday, Biden’s prostate cancer diagnosis was announced, with his spokesperson telling Fox News days later that the last time he received a blood test that screens for prostate cancer was in 2014.

Click here to watch\n\nThe pastors gathered at the historic Quinn Chapel to rally to Johnson’s defense in a coordinated event designed to present a unified message.\n\nIt was a carefully controlled gathering of dozens of Black pastors from across the city.\n\n“We have all of this lined up; we have all of this already prepared,” said Pastor Walter Turner, with New Spiritual Light MB Church.\n\nThe aim of the gathering was to back Johnson and his hiring methods, which are currently being examined by President Donald Trump’s DOJ to determine if they show a bias towards hiring Black individuals.\n\n“We stand today as a collective group of faith leaders to say, ‘enough is enough.’ The harassment has to stop,” said Pastor Torrey Barrett, with Life Center Church.\n\nIt all started last Sunday, when Johnson bragged in another church about all the Blacks he had hired, drawing the attention of the White House.\n\nThe mayor’s office responded that his staff is diverse, with 36% of them Black, 32% white and 25% Hispanic.\n\n“This is not the mathematics of discrimination. This is the arithmetic of democracy, finally functioning,” said Pastor Stephan Thurston, with New Covenant Baptist Church.\n\nThe mayor had a ribbon cutting, and was not at the pastors’ press conference, but his political director was, and speakers frequently offered messaging very similar to what the mayor said on Tuesday.\n\n“Whereas my administration reflects the country, reflects the city, his administration reflects the country club,” Johnson said.\n\n“This appears to more represent the country, not a country club,” said Pastor Michael Eaddy, with People’s Church of the Harvest.\n\nThis gathering appeared to be an attempt to help shore up the mayor’s political base, but it could be a risky strategy.\n\n“So he’s focusing very heavily on getting the message out to African American voters that he’s there for them. The message, though, is backfiring because it’s making it appear as though he is taking racial sides, that he is supporting African Americans and not supporting the entire city,” ABC7 Chicago political analyst Laura Washington said.\n\nThe pastors defended their message.\n\n“This is not about Black Chicago; this is about Chicago being inclusive,” Turner said.\n\nThe pastors made it clear that this is just the beginning of a mobilization effort to stand up not just for Mayor Johnson, but for Black leaders everywhere.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nCHICAGO (WLS) &#8212; On Friday, numerous Black pastors came together to express&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Chicago Ministers Support Mayor Brandon Johnson During DOJ Hiring Probe first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/news/us/chicago-ministers-support-mayor-brandon-johnson-during-doj-hiring-probe/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Chicago-Black-pastors-gather-in-solidarity-with-Mayor-Brandon-Johnson.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-05-23 23:56:40","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.054},{"id":324273664,"title":"King's big moment in Canada after Trump row","text":"Mel Cappe, a former Canadian minister and senior civil servant, has been involved in preparing such speeches from the throne, usually delivered by a governor general.\n\nHe expects the King to add a \"few paragraphs of his own at the beginning\" to \"give his own personal view\", but the overall text of the speech will be approved by Canada's prime minister and his officials.\n\n\"He's not going to poke President Trump in the eye.

On the same day of last month's proclamation allowing commercial fishing in the monument, Trump issued an order to boost the US commercial fishing industry by peeling back regulations and opening up harvesting in previously protected areas.

The monument was created by President George W. Bush in 2009 and consists of about 1.3 million square km in the central Pacific Ocean. President Barack Obama expanded the monument in 2014. A week after the April 17 proclamation, the US National Marine Fisheries Service sent a letter to fishing permit holders giving them a green light to fish commercially within the monument's boundaries, even though a long-standing fishing ban remains on the books, according to a lawsuit filed Thursday in federal court in Honolulu.

The first longline fisher started fishing in the monument just three days after that letter, according to Earthjustice, which has been tracking vessel activity within the monument using Global Fishing Watch. The Department of Justice declined to comment Friday. The lawsuit noted that commercial longline fishing, an industrial method involving baited hooks from lines over 96 km or longer, will snag turtles, marine mammals or seabirds that are attracted to the bait or swim through the curtain of hooks. “We will not stand by as the Trump administration unleashes highly destructive commercial fishing on some of the planet's most pristine, biodiverse marine environments,” David Henkin, an Earthjustice attorney, said in a statement. “Piling lawlessness on top of lawlessness, the National Marine Fisheries Service chose to carry out President Trump's illegal proclamation by issuing its own illegal directive, with no public input.” Designating the area in the Pacific Ocean to the south and west of the Hawaiian Islands as a monument provided “needed protection to a wide variety of scientific and historical treasures in one of the most spectacular and unique ocean ecosystems on earth,” the lawsuit said. The lawsuit added that allowing commercial fishing in the monument expansion harms the “cultural, spiritual, religious, subsistence, educational, recreational, and aesthetic interests” of a group of Native Hawaiian plaintiffs who are connected genealogically to the Indigenous peoples of the Pacific.

Burial sites, over a thousand, of white farmers, and those cars are lined up to pay love on a Sunday morning.”\n\nMchunu said the crosses did not mark graves or burial sites, but were a temporary memorial put up in 2020 to protest the killings of all farmers across South Africa. They were put up during a funeral procession for a white couple who were killed in a robbery on their farm, Mchunu said.\n\nA son of the couple who were killed and a local community member who took part in the procession also said the crosses do not represent burial sites and were taken down after the protest.\n\nSouth Africa struggles with extremely high levels of violent crime, although farm killings make up a small percentage of the country’s overall homicides.

Several Pentagon aides were placed on administrative leave last month following a probe into the “turf war“ that prompted the leaks and threw the Pentagon into chaos.\n\nUnder the new rules, journalists will also be issued “clearer” credential badges with a “PRESS” identifier.

Last year, an embrace between Xi and his Russian counterpart, Vladimir Putin, seemed to sum up the cosy – if at times slightly awkward – relationship between China and Russia.\n\nNow Brazil’s president, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, can count himself among the hallowed few to have broken the handshake barrier with Chinese leader. Stepping off the stage after giving a speech in Beijing earlier this month, Lula shook Xi’s hand, but the moment swiftly melted into something more affectionate.\n\nXi had good reason to be feeling warm towards the Brazilian leader. In Lula’s address to the China-CELAC forum, a dialogue between China and Latin American and Caribbean countries, he condemned US tariffs and said the Latin American region wanted to be “the axis of a multipolar order where the Global South is duly represented.” Such words echo the case that China has been trying to make to the world – particularly countries in the global south – about the dangers of the tariffs unleashed by US president Donald Trump since he entered the White House in January.\n\nChina’s argument stands in contrast to the stance taken by the G7, a group of the world’s wealthiest nations, which on Thursday issued a joint communique in which they agreed to counter global “economic imbalances”, a veiled swipe at China.\n\nLula’s presence at the forum was itself a coup for China as it seeks to expand its global influence in Latin America. Lula was one of three heads of states to attend the conference, along with the presidents of Chile and Colombia. That was no accident. China had specifically courted the leaders of countries seen as being influential in the region and closer to the US, rather than those from the countries more naturally aligned with the Chinese Communist party, such as Venezuela and Cuba, who lack regional clout. Lula in particular got a full bells-and-whistles welcome to Beijing, with a military performance in Tiananmen Square including a 21 gun salute.\n\nIn a keynote speech at the forum, Xi identified China as a fellow member of the global south.\n\n“Independence and autonomy are our glorious tradition. Development and revitalisation are our inherent right,” Xi said. China and the Latin American and Caribbean community have a “shared future”, he added.\n\nSince Trump’s first term in office, Brazil has been at the forefront of deepening ties between China and Latin America. One key domain has been trade, which hit a record $157.5bn in 2023. Last year, China imported more than 70% of its soya beans from Brazil, while imports from US farmers have plummeted. Luckin Coffee, China’s largest coffee chain, has pledged to buy 240,000 tonnes of Brazilian coffee beans over a five year period, worth $1.38bn.\n\n“If it’s up to my government, our relationship with China will be indestructible,” Lula told business leaders in Beijing, as the two countries announced $4.5bn of upcoming Chinese investments in Brazil. In total, Brazil and China signed 20 agreements on agricultural trade, as well as deals on mining, nuclear energy, and currency swaps.\n\n“From a commercial point of view, the current US-China trade war has brought some export opportunities for Brazil, especially in the agricultural sector,” said Victoria Chonn-Ching, a non-resident fellow at the Atlantic Council.\n\nBut with a trade policy landscape that can change overnight, Beijing is also trying to win the ideological argument on the global stage. Brazil, which China sees as a fellow leader in the global south, is an important player in that strategy.\n\n“From a geostrategic and diplomatic perspective, the US-China trade war places Brazil in a challenging position,” Chonn-Ching said.\n\nWhile Brazil has maintained strong ties with the US, on the other hand its relationship with China is significant, said Chonn-Ching, as “both countries promote multilateralism as part of their foreign policy and see themselves as having leading roles in their respective regions and in the Global South.”\n\nUnlike many other countries in Latin America, however, Brazil has not signed up to China’s belt and road initiative. Speaking in Beijing, Lula said that Latin America “does not want to be the stage of hegemonic disputes”.\n\nBut while Trump’s vision for the global order is still coming into focus, Beijing has for years trumpeted the importance of a “multipolar” system of international cooperation. It is a sentiment that Lula echoes.\n\nRecent global events have also brought the two countries closer together. After the 7 October attacks in Israel, Brazil, as president of the UN security council, drafted a resolution condemning Hamas and calling for a humanitarian pause in hostilities as well as the release of hostages in Gaza. Many expected China, which had not until this month specifically condemned the attacks, to veto the resolution. But following rounds of back-room diplomacy with Brazil, China voted in favour. The resolution ultimately failed because of a US veto.\n\nSince then, Brazil and China have come closer together in attempts to cast themselves as mediators in global conflicts. The countries have twice released joint statements on the war in Ukraine, neither of which condemn the Russian invasion. And on his flight back from China, Lula’s plane stopped in Moscow, and he spoke to Xi’s “best friend”, Vladimir Putin, on the phone.\n\nAdditional research by Lillian Yang and Jason Lu","summary":"Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva has signed up to Xi Jinping’s vision of a multi-polar world, as Beijing expands its influence in Latin America\n\nFew world leaders can say they’ve been hugged by Xi Jinping, China’s typically reserved president.

By this measure, coyote management in California and nationwide has been crazy for decades, with constant, indiscriminate killing and taxpayer-funded extermination programs — all while coyotes survive and move into new areas.\n\nFortunately, California is poised for change. The state’s Wildlife Resources Committee will consider new rules to limit coyote killing. Science demonstrates that intense persecution of coyotes increases conflicts by encouraging more reproduction and opening territories to inexperienced, juvenile dispersers prone to seek food like garbage and small pets. Non-lethal methods, such as hazing, livestock fencing, and keeping pets on leash and garbage secured, have proven far more effective in reducing human-coyote conflicts.\n\nThe committee’s recommendation must be adopted ASAP so that the state can advance new approaches to coyote coexistence, which in these changing times are both very necessary and very sane.\n\nCamilla Fox\n\nAlzheimer’s centers\nneed more state funding\n\nThe 10 California Alzheimer’s Disease Centers, including the outstanding UC Davis Center in Walnut Creek, are in trouble, with some at risk of closing soon, potentially leaving Californians with Alzheimer’s in the cold.\n\nThe centers are a smart investment that leverages hundreds of millions in federal research spending to expand access to expert diagnosis and treatment for ordinary Californians, and to increase provider training.

The move is expected to significantly reduce the number of staff at the NSC, according to the officials, who requested anonymity to discuss the sensitive personnel matter. Secretary of State Marco Rubio has been serving as national security adviser since early this month following the ouster of Mike Waltz, who was nominated to serve as Trump's ambassador to the United Nations.

The NSC has been in a continual state of tumult for much of the early going of Trump's second go-around in the White House. Waltz was ousted weeks after Trump said that he'd fired several NSC officials, just a day after far-right activist Laura Loomer raised concerns directly to him about staff loyalty.

The White House days into the administration sidelined about 160 NSC aides, sending them home while the administration reviewed staffing and tried to align it with Trump's agenda. The aides were career government employees, commonly referred to as detailees. This latest shakeup amounts to a “liquidation” of NSC staffing with both career government detailees on assignment to the NSC being sent back to their home agencies and several political appointees being fired from their positions, according to the person familiar with the decision. A White House official who spoke on the condition of anonymity confirmed that the overhaul, first reported by Axios, was underway but declined further comment.

If that is not the case, a tariff of at least 25% must be paid by Apple to the US,” Trump said in a post on Truth Social.The move, if implemented, would hit the Cupertino-based firm, which has been seeking to diversify its production base beyond China, as well as India’s electronics manufacturing services ecosystem, which has been supporting not only phone manufacturers but also hundreds of ancillary and downstream component makers beginning to set up shop, according to experts.Some feel it won’t hurt IndiaA section of industry executives, however, said the US administration’s move to slap tariffs on Apple would not halt India’s strides in electronics manufacturing services.“India is primarily involved in assembly, and even within that, India's piece of the pie is under $40,” said Raja Manickam, founder of fabless chip startup iVP Semiconductor and former chief executive of Tata Electronics. “I do see that sense will prevail and that Apple will reason with the US government that at least 50% or more of their value addition comes in from chips, IP and software by American companies.”Most of the iPhones sold in the US currently are made in India. Apple’s assembly lines in India churned out smartphones worth $22 billion in FY25, with a 60% year-on-year increase in output.Shifting Apple’s manufacturing to the US would not be a feasible solution, though, said experts, since that would increase the cost of the iPhone to $3,000 on average, from the current price of around $1,000, owing to the high cost of labour in the US.“Trump’s posturing of a potential 25% tariff on ‘Made in India’ Apple phones will certainly be a dampener on Apple’s India plans,” said Jaijit Bhattacharya, president, Centre for Digital Economy Policy Research. “It brings in regulatory uncertainty for Apple, which in itself is extremely detrimental. Apple was signalled to move out of China into trusted supply chain locations such as India. As it started ramping up in India, conflicting signals have emerged from the US administration.” He said the outcome would be significant uncertainty for Apple, impacting the company’s ability to build a resilient supply chain and serve the market.Some experts also said Trump’s statement as a strategic move amid trade deal discussions with India.Anurag Agrawal, founder of market researcher Techaisle, said, “Trump's past actions indicate a willingness to impose tariffs to push for domestic production, and his recent comments suggest he is not pleased with Apple’s move to diversify manufacturing to India. Therefore, some form of targeted tariffs remains a possibility. While Trump can impose tariffs, previous threats have often been used as negotiating tactics, and exemptions for electronics (including iPhones) have been granted before.”ET’s queries sent to Apple remained unanswered till press time.“The notion of Apple moving iPhone assembly to the US is less a concrete strategy and more of a negotiating tool, especially in the context of US-India trade dynamics, said Sanyam Chaurasia, technology market analyst at Canalys Research.","summary":"US President Donald Trump has threatened to impose a 25% tariff on iPhones sold in the US unless they are manufactured in the country, and not in India or elsewhere. The statement, posted on Truth Social, follows his recent remarks advising Apple CEO Tim Cook against producing in India.

Kyiv agreed. Moscow hasn't.\n\nThe Kremlin leader sidestepped the European ultimatum with his counter proposal of direct talks in Turkey. The idea was greeted with scepticism in Ukraine and across Europe. But it was enough to placate Trump and convince him Russia was serious about wanting peace. He was all for the talks. \"Crushing\" new sanctions were delayed.\n\nAhead of the Istanbul meeting on 16 May, President Trump gave the impression that Vladimir Putin might attend. The Kremlin leader did not, sending instead a comparatively low-level delegation that once more rejected the idea of a long-term ceasefire. But, again, the modest results of the talks were sufficient to persuade the US president that progress was being made.\n\nThen came the Trump-Putin phone call on 19 May. \n\nBy the end of it, Russia had still not agreed to an immediate comprehensive cessation of hostilities. Instead, according to President Trump, \"Russia and Ukraine will immediately start negotiations toward a ceasefire and, more importantly, an END to the War\".\n\nBut Moscow is already casting doubt on whether it would sign any future peace treaty with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. For a year now the Russian authorities have been attempting to delegitimise Ukraine's president since the expiry of his presidential term. However, Ukraine's Constitution prohibits the holding of elections in wartime.\n\nAnd the reason for martial law in Ukraine is Russia's invasion.\n\n\"Would Russia sit down and sign a peace agreement with President Zelensky?\" I asked Russia's foreign minister Sergei Lavrov on Friday.\n\n\"You're putting the cart before the horse,\" Mr Lavrov replied. \"First we need to have a deal.

My view is that the NSC has become slightly too large. It also became a place where decision-making went to die during the Obama and Biden administrations. That said, directives from President Donald Trump and Rubio to establish rapid chains of information and decision-making could have addressed these problems. The advantage of that alternative approach is that it would have allowed national security professionals from different intelligence agencies such as the CIA, NSA, FBI and U.S. military to reach back into the behemoth that is the national security bureaucracy and extract the information and actions required by Rubio, the national security principals, and the president. The key point to emphasize here is that a national security adviser can wrangle the NSC for his or her purposes without simply gutting it.\n\nRubio’s decision means fewer of the most important information points will get up to the top of the executive branch in a timely fashion. It will risk less informed decision-making. It will risk things being missed. It will miss expertise on specific issues being delivered directly to Rubio and his political deputies.\n\nIndeed, contrary to Rubio’s claim, his action is a step against the “deep state.” His action will defer bureaucratic control down to individual agencies. This risks small cliques taking advantage of their own bureaucratic interests against those of the president. Sharing between various elements of government will be hampered. Again, if Rubio and Trump simply wanted a speedier NSC process, they could have demanded that of the NSC. It would then have been up to those assigned to the NSC to implement the president’s directives expediently. If not, bye-bye.\n\nRegardless, the timing of these firings on Friday afternoon has far less justification. As CNN notes, “An email from NSC chief of staff Brian McCormack went out around 4:20 p.m. informing those being dismissed they’d have 30 minutes to clean out their desks. … If they weren’t on campus, the email read, they could email an address and arrange a time to retrieve their stuff later and turn in devices.”\n\nOn what planet does Rubio think this sends a good message to career national security public servants that the Trump administration values their service? Again, we are not talking about paper-pushers here. NSC service involves very long hours and high stress. We’re not talking about customer service representatives at the U.S. Postal Service. We’re talking about highly trained intelligence analysts, military officers, and law enforcement professionals. Many of these people are veterans. Many of them could be making a lot more in the private sector than they make in government service. But they serve in the NSC because they love their country.\n\nUS PLAYS BAD COP, EUROPE PLAYS BAD COP WITH RUSSIA AND ISRAEL\n\nThey now go home for Memorial Day weekend being treated as if they are little more than worthless numbers on a Trump administration worksheet.

He praised Gap CEO Richard Dickson's efforts to reinvent the apparel maker, telling investors they can buy the stock if it comes down before the quarter.

Weissmann played a key role in the Muller investigation, which Trump has repeatedly derided as a “hoax.” \n\n“My administration is committed to addressing the significant risks associated with law firms... that engage in conduct detrimental to critical American interests,“ the order read. ”Jenner & Block LLP (Jenner) is yet another law firm that has abandoned the profession’s highest ideals, condoned partisan ‘lawfare,’ and abused its pro bono practice to engage in activities that undermine justice and the interests of the United States.”\n\nThe order was designed to “chill legal representation the administration doesn’t like, thereby insulating the Executive Branch from the judicial check fundamental to the separation of powers,” Bates argued.\n\nThe Friday ruling mirrors an earlier May 2 decision that struck down similar orders against the international law firm Perkins Coie. Jenner sued to block the order, arguing it limited free speech and due process rights by punishing legal advocacy the administration dislikes. \n\nThe move speaks to a wider fracturing of the legal profession as firms pick sides amid the Trump administration’s attacks. At least four firms—Jenner, Perkins, WilmerHale, and Susan Godfrey—have filed suits to block Trump’s executive orders. At the same time, several others, including Skadden Arps and Simpson Thatcher, have pledged free legal support for causes endorsed by the White House in an effort to avoid being targeted. \n\nThe Justice Department, helmed by Pam Bondi, which has defended the orders as legitimate exercises of presidential authority, has not yet publicly commented on the ruling and has been contacted for response. The White House has also so far remained silent on the ruling.\n\nThe Trump administration is expected to appeal to the D.C.

It's currently above 4.5 per cent.\n\nBut when the passage of Trump's bill hit trading terminals across the globe, the 30-year Treasury bond yield touched a level not seen since 2007, of 5.13 per cent.\n\nThe catalyst for the latest round of selling was Moody's downgrade of US debt from Aaa to Aa1.\n\nMoody's downgrade said, ever-so-subtly, US debt had become riskier for the lender.\n\nIt clearly has.\n\nGlobal increase in yields hurts economic activity\n\nBut how does it affect you?\n\nThe problem is that many assets and securities across the globe use US Treasury bonds as a reference rate.\n\nPut simply, the more yields rise for US bonds, the higher the borrowing costs for US businesses and households.\n\nThis makes it increasingly difficult for big US corporations to raise funds and grow their profits and may lead to US consumers pulling back on their spending.\n\n\"So, if we think about the global cost of capital, the 10-year US Treasury is the benchmark,\" James Wilson said.\n\n\"It gets used for corporate lending, it gets used for sovereign lending — so where the government can borrow money, and it gets used for mortgages.\"\n\nIn short, if US government bond yields continue to rise, it risks pushing the US into recession.\n\nThis would affect both Chinese and Australian economic growth, and therefore employment.\n\nThis would be compounded if both bond and share markets fell together. Given that shares are valued, in part, against the \"risk-free\" return that can be obtained from US Treasuries, rising yields tend to put downward pressure on share prices because investors demand a higher return.\n\n\"So, especially when both bonds and equities are both falling in price, this is tightening funding conditions,\" Barrenjoey's interest rate strategist Andrew Lilley said.\n\n\"And also [it's going to cost more] if you then go to the debt market while you're paying more.\n\n\"That's the way in which this kind of reinforces itself.\"\n\nHe says, \"at the margin\", higher US bond yields \"could push the Reserve Bank to cut the cash rate, if long-dated yields keep climbing.\"\n\nThis would be to support Australian businesses borrowing from the US, and the economy more broadly.\n\n\"Basically, the higher long-term funding costs are the lower the RBA needs to make [the cash rate].\n\n\"That's the simplest way of putting it.\"\n\nRBA 'paid to worry' about 'cataclysmic' events\n\nThe Reserve Bank is known for its understated commentary.\n\nNot so this week.\n\nIt made it clear to everyone that the Monetary Policy Board's decision to cut the cash rate from 4.1 per cent to 3.85 per cent was due in some part to the small but rising risk of a \"severe downside scenario\".\n\nGovernor Michele Bullock was asked if that included a \"cataclysmic\" financial markets event, and a recession.\n\n\"Well, yes,\" she responded, \"we are on the alert for that, and we're paid to worry about that sort of thing.\"\n\n\"And we have been watching that very closely as have other central banks all around the world.\n\n\"I'm not putting a strong possibility on a really, really bad outcome, but I think we have to be alert that there might be [one].\n\n\"[And] if you look at our scenario analysis, it does suggest that in a really bad outcome there could possibly be an [Australian] recession, yes, but that's in the very extreme,\" Governor Bullock said.\n\nThe Reserve Bank has already shifted its unemployment rate forecast up slightly to peak at 4.3 per cent. It's currently 4.1 per cent.\n\n\"Look, without a doubt that the Reserve Bank is quite worried about the global growth story,\" James Wilson said.\n\nIt all comes back to Trump, how his tariff policy will play out, the future credibility of US sovereign debt, and how financial markets ultimately respond to ongoing confusion about the global economic outlook.\n\n\"If we are in the middle of a government debt crisis, it's something that's been brewing for 25 years,\" Barrenjoey's Andrew Lilley said.\n\n\"And nothing in the last week has really accelerated that.\n\n\"But the attention [on ballooning US government debt] just becomes salient to everybody at the same time and everybody starts saying well these government bond yields need to be higher and it's not because of the news, but it's because of the new attention.\"\n\nThe suggestion is that US government borrowing has been on an unsustainable path now for decades.\n\nEnter Donald Trump, and the true scale of the fiscal crisis is being realised.","summary":"US 10-year Treasury bonds have long been considered \"risk-free\" — until now.
