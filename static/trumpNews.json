Sarah Huckabee Sanders, his former White House press secretary, at the Dort Financial Center in Flint, Michigan. \"It's a little bit dangerous. It's, you know, they think race car driving is dangerous? No. They think bull riding, that's pretty scary, right? No. This is a dangerous business, and we have to keep it safe.\" Trump later told the crowd he received a phone call Tuesday from Vice President Kamala Harris, calling it \"very, very nice, we appreciate that.\" Speaking earlier Tuesday during a panel interview with the National Association of Black Journalists in Philadelphia, Harris also acknowledged that she had spoken to Trump, saying that she \"checked on him to see if he was OK.\" Previously Trump was blaming the rhetoric of Democrats and Harris, telling Fox News digital, \"their rhetoric is causing me to be shot at, when I am the one who is going to save the country and they are the ones that are destroying the country — both from the inside and out.\" Joseph Guajardo, a licensed counselor from Battle Creek, Michigan, said at Trump's town hall in Flint that he hopes the former president will focus on policy, \"instead of all the name-calling.\" \"I think America is above all of this horrible rhetoric that's been spoken of about President Trump and the other side, the other side being the Democratic party,\" Guajardo said. On Sunday, members of the former president's Secret Service detail spotted an AK-47-style rifle poking through the bushes at Trump National Golf Course while Trump was golfing there. An agent fired at the suspect, later identified as Ryan Routh, who fled the scene. Routh was later apprehended and charged with two firearms offenses. An investigation is underway. Despite Sunday's events and the assassination attempt in Butler, Pennsylvania on July 13, Jim Jones, an Army veteran from Davison, Michigan and Trump supporter, said he's not worried about his safety at Trump's campaign events. \"I think when the good Lord wants you, he'll take you,\" Jones said, adding that he thinks \"the good Lord has a job for Trump to do.\" Virginia Williamson, a nurse and Trump supporter in Flint, Michigan, said she wasn't planning to attend Trump's town hall Tuesday until she heard about the apparent attempt on Trump's life. \"That's why my husband and I are here today to show support,\" Williamson said. Trump campaign officials say that they are not planning changes to his schedule after Sunday's events. A senior campaign official told CBS News that acting Secret Service Director Ronald Rowe told Trump that it isn't safe for him to golf without additional security measures.

Highly publicized security weaknesses, which surfaced after the first assassination attempt against the 45th president on July 13, could embolden “copycats”—especially amid the heated 2024 presidential campaign, Billy Ray Hunter, a former SWAT officer in Alachua County, Florida, said. “I pray that this is the last one [but] I’m really concerned because I don’t believe it’s over,” he said in a Sept. 17 interview, two days after the second incident. “Enemies have seen the inability to protect him.” Both Hunter and James Tignanelli, president of the Police Officers Association of Michigan, told The Epoch Times that it’s apparent that agents failed to take some basic steps to secure the golf course and ensure Trump’s safety. They also discussed concerns about circumstances surrounding the July 13 assassination attempt that killed a spectator and wounded three others, including Trump, at a rally in Butler, Pennsylvania. The U.S. Secret Service’s countersniper team returned fire and killed the suspected gunman. Tignanelli’s biggest concern about both incidents was the lack of communication and coordination between federal agents and local officers—a problem that he sees “time and time again,” despite it being laid bare during the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks on the United States. That was a major impetus for creating the Department of Homeland Security, he noted, yet it remains an unresolved issue. Secret Service Acting Director Ronald Rowe on Sept. 16 defended his agency’s actions to protect Trump at the golf course, saying the measures deployed were effective. He noted that President Joe Biden directed increased resources for Trump’s protection following the Butler shooting, including countersnipers, countersurveillance agents, counterassault teams, and drones, which were deployed at the golf course, Rowe said. The security footprint outside Trump’s golf course was “not much” different from when he was in office, Rowe said. Vice President Kamala Harris on Sept. 17 said she has full confidence in the Secret Service. Rowe said he considered it a success that Trump was unharmed after an agent spotted the suspect’s weapon at the Trump International Golf Club in West Palm Beach, Florida, and fired at him. The suspect fled. Authorities said suspect Ryan Wesley Routh didn’t have a line of sight on Trump, who was several hundred yards away. “That’s basic, to do a perimeter check ... I’d say that’s ‘Protective Service 101,’” he said, adding that officers must prioritize the security of any area that could pose a security risk, such as a building—as was the case in Butler—or a wooded area, such as the one at the golf course. Rowe said that Trump’s visit to the golf course was an “off-the-record movement,” meaning that it wasn’t on his official schedule, implying that the agents didn’t have much time to prepare for his outing. But Tignanelli and Hunter contend that it wouldn’t have taken much time to survey the perimeter, and to ask local police to help with that. Tignanelli said, in his experience, “the federal agencies don’t want to tell you what they’re doing.” “It’s absurd on their part,” he said, adding that the situation hasn’t changed during his four decades in law enforcement. Local police usually are the ones who “catch the bad guys,” Tignanelli said, pointing out that that’s what happened after the suspect fled the Florida golf course. Hunter said it’s his understanding that the suspect may have gotten away if not for an observant person who spotted him fleeing from the golf course and took pictures of the vehicle, including the license plate, for police. Federal agents and local police “weren’t communicating on the same radio frequency,” Tignanelli said. “We knew better than that 40 years ago.” Radio systems can be set up “so that we could share information ... we could be private or listen,” he said. Rep. Mike Kelly (R-Pa.), chairman of a congressional task force that is investigating the Butler assassination attempt, told The Epoch Times on Sept. 16 that the incidents both seem to have been plagued by apparent deficiencies in security preparations prior to Trump’s arrival. He said that the bipartisan task force is now likely to broaden its current probe to include the Florida incident. Biden on Sept. 16 said the Secret Service “needs more help,” before suggesting that Congress should respond to the agency’s needs. Both Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) and House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.) have said they’re considering pushing through additional funding for the agency. Rowe said he was speaking with Congress about getting more funding for training and hiring more personnel. In the wake of the incident, Trump has pinned some of the blame on Democrats’ rhetoric, citing ongoing remarks that he’s a “threat to democracy.” The White House on Sept. 17 pushed back on the accusation. “The president and the vice president have always forcefully, forcefully condemned violence in all forms, including political violence,” White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said. “And we certainly have never encouraged any violence in any way.” Both Biden and Harris condemned the apparent assassination attempt and political violence following the Florida incident. Kelly said he wants to figure out what can be done to stop people from taking extreme actions, to ensure that “we are safe and secure.” “Not just our presidential candidates, but also with America’s position to the world,” Kelly said. “I think we are way too vulnerable. ... These are very dangerous times for America.” The Epoch Times has reached out to the Secret Service for comment.","summary":"Law enforcement experts raise questions about the Secret Service's protective measures as lawmakers consider extra funding.","url":"https://www.theepochtimes.com/us/2nd-trump-assassination-attempt-raises-new-security-questions-5725877","image":"https://img.theepochtimes.com/assets/uploads/2024/09/15/id5724703-GettyImages-2171582602-300x180.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-18 00:52:39","author":"Janice Hisle","authors":["Janice Hisle"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.167},{"id":256652034,"title":"Russian Election Interference Efforts Targeting Harris Campaign: Microsoft","text":"Russian state-backed efforts to interfere in the U.S. presidential elections have begun to focus on targeting the campaigns of Kamala Harris and Tim Walz, according to a new report by Microsoft. The shift is notable, according to the report, as up until now Russian cyber actors had appeared slow to shift their efforts away from targeting President Joe Biden. “The shift to focusing on the Harris-Walz campaign reflects a strategic move by Russian actors aimed at exploiting any perceived vulnerabilities in the new candidates,” the report reads. “As we inch closer to the election, we should expect Russian actors to continue to use cyber proxies and hacktivist groups to amplify their messages … to spread divisive political content, staged videos, and AI-enhanced propaganda.” The new report focuses on three Russian threat actors which have been known and tracked closely for several years, known as Storm-1516, Storm-1679, and Ruza Flood. The three groups have successfully generated hundreds of thousands of views and engagements on social media through proxy accounts claiming to be Americans. The content shared by the groups includes videos that claim to depict Harris supporters attacking a supporter of former President Donald Trump and evidence that Harris paralyzed a young girl in a hit-and-run accident. Both videos were fake and laundered through websites claiming to be American news sites but which appear to have been established to spread foreign influence. Most of the personas established on social media by Storm-1852 claim to be conservative U.S. voters who support Trump, but there are also accounts that spread anti-Trump content and use political slogans and hashtags associated with the American left. Speaking earlier in the day at the Politico AI and Tech Summit in Washington, Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency senior adviser Cait Conley said the use of artificial intelligence was exacerbating “existing risks” to U.S. elections, allowing threat actors to more quickly and convincingly create misleading videos, text, and images. She added that the United States was investing in appropriate measures to maintain the security of the electoral process, and that she remained “confident in the security and resilience in our democratic process.” Still, she said, there may be some “disruptions” to the forthcoming presidential election in November. “You may see disruptions this fall. That does not mean that the security or the integrity of the process has been undermined,” Conley said. “These risks are not new. These threats are not new.”","summary":"The Moscow-backed attempts have shifted their focus from the current president to Democratic Party presidential nominee Kamala Harris, a new report says.","url":"https://www.theepochtimes.com/us/russian-election-interference-efforts-targeting-harris-campaign-microsoft-5725981","image":"https://img.theepochtimes.com/assets/uploads/2024/08/23/id5712047-GettyImages-1244584327_1KO-300x180.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-18 00:51:27","author":"Andrew Thornebrooke","authors":["Andrew Thornebrooke"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.157},{"id":256651922,"title":"House Freedom Caucus picks Andy Harris  to replace Good as new chairman","text":"Caucus members voted to elect Harris in a voice vote on Tuesday evening, a lawmaker confirmed to the Washington Examiner.

Trump asked Ronald Rowe, the Secret Service's acting director, in a meeting on Monday whether it was safe for him to continue playing, the newspaper said. Rowe said the Secret Service views the golf course at Joint Base Andrews in Maryland as easier to secure because it is a military course. That meeting occurred a day after the Secret Service thwarted a second apparent assassination attempt on Trump in less than two months. On Sunday, Secret Service agents fired on Ryan Wesley Routh, the apparent would-be assassin, when they saw the barrel of his gun poking through the fenceline at Trump's golf course in West Palm Beach, Florida, and local police officers later arrested him. The incident has raised questions within Trump's orbit and among lawmakers about whether Trump's protection is sufficient. \"Former President Trump is receiving the highest level of protection that the U.S. Secret Service can provide, and we will continue to evaluate and adjust our specific protective measures and methodology based on each location and situation,\" Secret Service spokesperson Melissa McKenzie said on Tuesday. Still, at least one local official suggested otherwise. On Sunday, West Palm Beach Sheriff Ric Bradshaw told reporters that Trump's security detail was not as tight as that of a sitting president. Since the incident, both Democrats and Republicans have accused each other of using overheated rhetoric that is inspiring political violence. White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said in a press briefing on Tuesday that Republican vice presidential candidate JD Vance's comments about Vice President Kamala Harris not having faced an assassination attempt are dangerous. \"The big difference between conservatives and liberals is that ... no one has tried to kill Kamala Harris in the last couple of months,\" Vance said on Monday. Jean-Pierre said that language could put Harris in danger. \"When you make comments like that, all it does is ... opens an opportunity for people to listen to you and potentially take you very seriously, and so it's dangerous to have that type of rhetoric out there,\" she said. Trump was due to speak at a campaign event in Michigan on Tuesday evening in his first public political event since the apparent assassination attempt over the weekend.

I’ll add in the cautionary parenthetical here — no, we don’t agree on everything, including some key issues, like, for instance, abortion. But I’m not convinced she won’t come around on that, given her passion for children’s health. I was in my thirties when I left the pro-choice camp for pro-life.

Shanahan continued to show her mettle on Tuesday as she challenged Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren (D) over her claims in a tweet on X that women suffering miscarriages were unable to obtain adequate medical care due to the Supreme Court’s overturning Roe v. Wade with the Dobbs decision in 2022. What state is denying miscarriage D&C surgery? Why are so many women having deadly miscarriages?

In response, Shanahan asked: What state is denying miscarriage D&C surgery? Why are so many women having deadly miscarriages? This is a massive assertion from a U.S. senator and Hillary Clinton just called for criminal charges against misinformation purveyors. Let’s make sure you are careful with your information Ms. Warren. As Shanahan alludes, Hillary Clinton was just on MSNBC Monday night, seemingly advocating for criminal charges for Americans who “engage in propaganda.” Warren appears to be referring to the case of Amber Nicole Thurman, whose story is widely being circulated by abortion advocates as an example of how abortion bans are killing women. Jennifer Oliver O’Connell shares more about the case in her article detailing Vice President Kamala Harris’ “conversation” with the National Association of Black Journalists Tuesday afternoon. Harris brought in a tragic death story that recently happened in Georgia, a state that has a heartbeat law. The woman bought mifepristone in North Carolina, ingested the drug, and then when she returned to Georgia she started having complications resulting from the abortion pill. The woman was hospitalized and was scheduled to receive a D&C to remove the fetal body parts that had been left behind, but she died from infection before the procedure could be performed. But Harris is riding her reproductive rights train, conveniently claiming it was because of the abortion bans in Georgia that this poor woman did not receive access to proper “.” In the accounts blaming Thurman’s death on Trump and the Supreme Court (and, more specifically, Georgia’s heartbeat law), there don’t appear to be specifics from the hospital or medical care providers as to why the D&C procedure was delayed — particularly given the circumstances of Thurman’s case. It certainly would be helpful to know more of those details before assigning blame for her death to Georgia’s law (or Trump or Republicans). Given that even the states with the most restrictive abortion laws have “life of the mother” exceptions, the broad-brush account of what happened doesn’t really seem to square. But that isn’t stopping Harris, Warren, and other Democrats from definitively (and conveniently) placing the blame squarely at the feet of their political opponents. So, like Shanahan, I’d like Warren to specify: What states are denying miscarriage D&C surgery? And where are women hemorrhaging in parking lots? And in what way is that connected to restrictions on abortion? Specifically. And if Warren doesn’t have the specifics, then perhaps she should reconsider spouting her propaganda. I’m sure she wouldn’t want Kamala Harris — or, Heaven forfend, Donald Trump — to take Hillary Clinton’s advice and sic the law on her for being a purveyor of misinformation.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nI keep finding myself saying this, but Nicole Shanahan is really growing&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Nicole Shanahan Objects to Liz Warren&#8217;s Miscarriage Claims &#8211; cautions against spreading misinformation first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/news/us/nicole-shanahan-objects-to-liz-warrens-miscarriage-claims-cautions-against-spreading-misinformation/","image":"https://media.townhall.com/cdn/hodl/rs/images/up/2024/261/0f008c5e-8379-4691-baa4-19fa0b41b3b0-650x0.png","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-18 00:28:56","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.391},{"id":256651884,"title":"A records flaw could block thousands in Arizona from voting in state and local races","text":"Election officials in Arizona have discovered a flaw in the state’s voter registration system that could disqualify nearly 100,000 people from voting in state and local races just weeks before early ballots will hit mailboxes. A state law that went into effect in 2004 requires Arizona voters to provide proof of citizenship to register to vote in state and local elections, though individuals that do not provide proof can still register to vote for federal offices like president and U.S. Senate using a federal only form. Arizona’s voter registration system pulls information from the state’s driver's license database as a method of proving citizenship, but the Maricopa County Recorder’s office found a flaw with the database, which incorrectly showed that some people provided proof of citizenship when they applied for a driver’s license. The issue affects just a tiny fraction of the roughly 4.1 million people registered to vote in Arizona — roughly 98,000 voters who got a license before Oct. 1, 1996, said Arizona Secretary of State Adrian Fontes on Tuesday. “That's the day when Arizona started requiring proof of legal presence in the United States to get a driver's license,” Fontes said. Maricopa County Recorder Stephen Richer, who oversees early voting and voter registration in the nation’s fourth largest county, said his office discovered a glitch in that system while verifying the citizenship of a person with a pre-1996 license. The office found that the person was a lawful permanent resident but not a citizen eligible to vote. Fontes said there is no evidence that person voted or attempted to cast a ballot. But the discovery sent election officials in Arizona down a rabbit hole that revealed tens of thousands of voters in every county in the state have not provided the documentation required to vote a full ballot under Arizona law. That doesn’t mean those people aren’t eligible to vote, though, Fontes said. “This was discovered not because somebody was voting illegally and not because somebody was attempting to vote illegally,” he said. “As far as we can tell, this was basic voter roll maintenance.” Now, Richer and Fontes are asking the Arizona Supreme Court to decide how to deal with the voters affected by the revelation. In an emergency petition filed with the court, Richer, a Republican who has defended the county’s election systems from critics like former President Donald Trump, argues the 98,000 voters should only be allowed to vote in federal elections unless they provide proof of citizenship by Election Day. “It is my position that these registrants have not satisfied Arizona's documented proof of citizenship law, and therefore can only vote a ‘federal-only’ ballot,” said Richer, who was defeated in this year’s Republican primary by a Trump ally. That \"federal only\" status would allow them to vote in races like the presidential contest between Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris, but would prevent those voters from weighing in on a lengthy list of proposed laws going before Arizona voters this year, including a measure to put abortion rights into the state Constitution. Fontes, a Democrat, called Richer’s filing a “friendly litigation,” saying their offices coordinated the legal effort in order to obtain a firm legal ruling about how to proceed. But Fontes is taking a different position than his Republican counterpart. He said his office plans to file a reply with the court, asking it to allow the 98,000 impacted voters to vote a full ballot this year. He said it is too close to an election to make these types of changes to the voter rolls and he doesn’t believe there is evidence that a significant number of the affected individuals are not eligible to vote. “By the way, every single one of these voters has met the minimum criteria in swearing an affirmation under penalty of perjury that they would have to do to vote in every election across the rest of the United States of America,” he said, adding that only Arizona requires additional proof of citizenship to vote. He said he hopes to have a ruling by the end of the week as the state begins sending ballots to overseas citizens and military personnel. If that isn’t possible, he hopes for a ruling before the state begins sending out early mail-in ballots on Oct. 9. Fontes acknowledged that publicly disclosing the problems with the voter registration system is likely to inflame already high tensions in Arizona and Maricopa County, hotbeds of unproven allegations of voter fraud following Trump’s loss to President Biden in 2020. “This has already spurred new conspiracy theories about this election, but those conspiracy theories are just as good as all of the other conspiracy theories are,” Fontes said. “We have the facts. We are bringing them forward in a very transparent way.” But Fontes said election officials had no choice other than to go public. “We are being open and transparent in bringing this issue forward,” he said. “We are making absolutely certain that folks understand that good, bad or indifferent, we are going to keep the public informed.” Arizona Gov. Katie Hobbs, a Democrat and former secretary of state, said the Arizona Department of Transportation’s motor vehicle division fixed the problem with the driver’s license database. “After Recorder Richer brought an erroneous voter registration record to my attention, my team identified and fixed an administrative error that originated in 2004, and affects longtime residents who received a driver’s license before 1996,” Hobbs said in a statement. Fontes said the fix will solve the problem moving forward.","summary":"Arizona officials say the flaw could disqualify nearly 100,000 people from voting in non-federal races.

Luckily, Trump will help her","text":"Donald Trump might claim he won his debate with Kamala Harris. Right-wing buffoons like Greg Sheridan might insist it was a draw. But investors know who won, who was able to provoke and rattle whom, whose temperament was displayed to better effect. Look at what happened to the share price for Trump Media. It had slowly been recovering from record lows in the days leading up to the debate. But the day after the evening debate: ouch. The debate was timely for Harris: her average lead in national polls, which had reached 3.7 percentage points around August 23, had shrunk back to 2.6 points on the eve of the debate. She’s now hitting battleground states, trying to coax Republicans disgusted with Trump, and those with fresh doubts about his temperament in the wake of the debate (what took them so long). A particular target will be the smoking ruins of the pre-Trump Republican Party, after Harris received the backing of long-time Trump critic Liz Cheney and her father Dick. The latter, the Darth Vader of the GOP, savaged Trump, saying “in our nation’s 248-year history, there has never been an individual who is a greater threat to our republic than Donald Trump.” He was backed by another Dubya-era veteran, torture fan and former attorney-general Alberto Gonzales, who labelled Trump “perhaps the most serious threat to the rule of law in a generation.” Many might say torturing people is worse, Al, but hey, there was a War on Terror to win, right? Problem is, Cheney and Gonzales aren’t just yesterday’s men, but represent a wing of the Republicans that was once dominant but is now desiccated. The Trump-era GOP is as if the Birchers of the 1960s somehow combined with the isolationists of the 1930s and the southern Democrats of the pre-LBJ era. The free trade, neocon, globalist, imperialist Republicans — for whom racism was only ever a strategy, not a core belief — have been ground underfoot by conspiracy theorists, America-Firsters and white supremacists whose goals are less about transforming Middle Eastern states into pro-American markets for US capital and more about transforming the United States into Margaret Atwood’s Gilead — if possible located in the Antebellum South. Forget the party of Lincoln — in this GOP, Jefferson Davis is the guiding star. Still, if Harris can lure a segment of disgruntled traditional Republicans to her column in battleground states, it will give her a real chance of besting Trump not merely in the national vote tally, but in the electoral college. Trump is doing nothing to attract unhappy Republicans — if anything, he has doubled down on the personal attacks and racist invective since the debate. But to attract that floating support, Harris needs to continue the relatively flawless campaign she’s produced so far. An important dimension to bear in mind about Harris’ campaign — especially compared to what Joe Biden would have managed — is that, even if she doesn’t win, she might well make a difference to the composition of the Senate and House in a second Trump administration. The Democrats are up against it in the Senate — nearly twice as many Democrat seats are being contested in November as Republican ones, and CNN reckons nearly all of the top 10 Senate seats most likely to change are currently Democrat. Even a Harris win could still see her facing an obstructionist Republican-controlled Senate. But given how much difficulty Trump had with his legislative agenda even with the GOP controlling both houses after 2016, every spot a Harris-Walz ticket can save will be precious. Harris just received one of her best polls of the year (conducted before Sunday’s apparent assassination attempt on Trump), but this far out, the most likely outcome is probably Harris winning the popular vote and Trump winning in the electoral college. Happy to be wrong, of course, very much so, but of all the bullshit and offensive drivel that has poured from Trump’s mouth over the past nine years, his statement “I could stand in the middle of 5th Avenue and shoot somebody and I wouldn’t lose voters” remains the truest thing he has uttered. He may not have killed anyone, but he’s an insurrectionist and rapist, and neither have harmed him. It’s almost impossible to imagine Trump doing something that would turn off more than a small part of his base — even dissolving into complete incoherence in public is unlikely to alienate too many of his voters, because he is the avatar of white resentment and grievance, regardless of what he does or what he says. He might be a vicious, babbling dotard, but he’s their vicious, babbling dotard. You might want Harris to win, even if you’re a conservative.

As authorities treat the episode as a second apparent assassination attempt, the former president has argued that President Biden and Vice President Harris’ \"rhetoric\" is what is causing him to be \"shot at.\" The day after the assassination attempt, CNN host Abby Phillip hosted a panel of commentators debating the relationship between heated rhetoric about the election and the recent attempts on Trump’s life. \"I have to say, when I see what Democratic politicians say about Donald Trump, when I see what Democratic commentators say about Donald Trump, and their platform is built on a bunch of lies, frankly, that are designed to radicalize a political base, it makes me wonder… How much do they really care about the violence that you and I both agree is terrible?\" Jennings asked. WHO IS RYAN WESLEY ROUTH: ALLEGED GUNMAN AT TRUMP GOLF CLUB He called out the Harris campaign for fearmongering about what the country would look like if Trump becomes president again. \"The underpinning of her campaign, I mean, she repeats it herself, ‘Trump will be a dictator on day one.’ I mean, this country fights dictators. That‘s what our history — we fight dictators,\" he said while the panel erupted to protest that it was true. Trump joked during a town hall with Sean Hannity in December that he would not be a dictator \"except for day one.\" He added, \"Other than day one - we’re closing the border, and we’re drilling, drilling, drilling. After that, I’m not a dictator.’\" \"'There‘ll be a bloodbath,’\" Jennings said as another example of Trump being taken out of context when he predicted an economic \"bloodbath\" for the automotive industry should President Biden win. During last week's presidential debate, Harris said, \"Donald Trump, the candidate, has said, in this election, there will be a bloodbath if the outcome of this election is not to his liking.\" \"It is said by every Democrat working for or around [Harris’] campaign every day on this network and every other one,\" Jennings said. \"The bloodbath thing is stated every single day.\" \"Use of the word ‘bloodbath’ when he was talking about vehicle manufacturing jobs in the United States, Vice President Harris improperly and unfairly mischaracterized that as him saying there would be a bloodbath if he were elected,\" Phillip confirmed, but clarified, \"However, she did not say that if Trump were elected, there would be a bloodbath.\" PELOSI SUGGESTS TRUMP MEANT HE WILL ‘EXACT A BLOODBATH’ IF HE DOESN’T WIN AFTER RALLY STATEMENTS Jennings argued that these kinds of false narratives are part of the Democratic Party’s strategy. \"I know you have interviewed and had people out here and have watched the same coverage I have.

They didn’t bother offering condolences to Hanan Shaheen, the mother of Wadee Alfayoumi, the 6-year-old Plainfield boy stabbed to death in what authorities called an anti-Muslim, anti-Palestinian hate crime. They didn’t offer any concern at all about the rise of anti-Muslim and ant-Palestinian hate crimes. They had a lot to say about antisemitism on college campuses, pro-Palestinian demonstrations and the safety of Jewish students. Don’t get me wrong. That’s a problem. But what spoke volumes was the way the Republicans did it — to the exclusion of anything else — and in the context of a presidential election where the GOP nominee Donald Trump is a top purveyor of hate speech (making the false claim Haitian immigrants in Ohio are eating people’s pets), a candidate who castigates Jews who vote for Democrats. To be specific, I’m talking about Senators Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, Ted Cruz and John Cornyn of Texas, Chuck Grassley of Iowa, Josh Hawley of Missouri, John Kennedy of Louisiana and Marsha Blackburn of Tennessee. They knew or should have known about Wadee’s horrific murder even if they got to the hearing after it started. Wadee’s death, coming a week after the Hamas attack in Israel, was a giant national story, reverberating far outside of the Chicago suburb where he was killed. The hearing’s focus was on “how the federal government can better protect the civil rights and safety of all Americans, including Jewish, Arab, and Muslim Americans” in “response to the ongoing and persistent rise in antisemitism, Islamophobia, anti-Arab hate, and other forms of bigotry across the country.” Hate crimes have spiked since the Oct. 7 Hamas attack that triggered the Israel-Hamas war in Gaza, a conflict soon to hit the one year mark. At the start of the hearing, the committee chair, Sen. Dick Durbin, D-Ill., said, “The FBI’s most recent national hate crime statistics document (cites) 11,634 hate crimes — the highest number since the FBI began reporting data. And, since the horrific Oct. 7th Hamas attack on Israel, we have seen an increase in attacks on Jewish Americans, Palestinian Americans, Arab Americans, and Muslim Americans.” Durbin, when he spoke, was flanked by two big pictures — of Wadee and Rose Mallinger. “I’d like to acknowledge that my constituent Hanan Shaheen, Wadee Alfayoumi’s mother, is in the audience,” Durbin said. Wadee, a Palestinian-American, was stabbed 26 times. Shaheen was also stabbed several times. Their landlord, Joseph Czuba, has been charged with Wadee’s murder and with the attack on Shaheen. Mallinger was one of the 11 members of the Tree of Life synagogue congregation killed on Oct. 27, 2018 in Pittsburgh — the biggest attack against Jews in U.S. history — and three of her relatives were in the audience. Graham, the top Republican on the panel, said there should have been a separate hearing on antisemitism and “radical” Islamism on college campuses — just like House Republicans had. end Durbin said he was trying to identify problems in America “that extend beyond the Jewish population.” In my analysis, Durbin wanted a hearing on hate crimes that would not pit Jewish Americans against Arab Americans, specifically Palestinian-Americans, as the war in Gaza continues. We are living in extremely difficult, complex times. Hamas continues to hold hostages taken in Israel, the number of civilian deaths in Gaza continues to soar, and a negotiated cease-fire seems out of reach. Each day brings awful developments. The Chicago area is home to the nation’s largest Palestinian-American and Palestinian population, and one of the biggest Jewish communities in the U.S. The low point in the hearing came when Kennedy repeatedly asked one of the witnesses, Maya Berry, the executive director of the Arab American Institute — and a Muslim — if she supported Hamas and Hezbollah. “You support Hamas, don’t you,” Kennedy said, raising his voice. “I think it is exceptionally disappointing that you are looking at an Arab-American witness before you and saying, ‘you support Hamas,’” Berry said, making it clear that she did not “support Hamas.” But Kennedy would not let go. “You should hide your head in a bag,” Kennedy told Berry, to groans in the audience. Durbin, at the end of the hearing, said, “I regret some of the things that were said today.” Hanan Shaheen didn’t want to be interviewed. She was with a contingent from the Muslim Civic Coalition, a national organization based in Chicago, and was with them at a press conference in front of the Capitol after the hearing. Dr. Dilara Sayeed, president of the coalition, said the upside of the hearing was that it “was the first of its kind to actually name a six-year-old Palestinian American child as the first victim on American soil of a hate crime. This hearing is just the beginning.”","url":"https://chicago.suntimes.com/columnists/2024/09/17/senate-republicans-judiciary-committee-hate-crime-hearing-slain-chicago-palestinian-american-youth","image":"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/cbb990c/2147483647/strip/true/crop/4032x2302+0+361/resize/1461x834!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F4d%2Fd2%2F632e56f74af38dbbde8088985405%2Fimg-","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-18 00:05:16","author":"Lynn Sweet","authors":["Lynn Sweet"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.303},{"id":256651544,"title":"New Security Arrangements Needed If...: Head Of Secret Service To Trump","text":"The head of the Secret Service told Donald Trump in a private meeting that significant new security arrangements will be needed if he wants to keep playing golf, The New York Times reported on Tuesday. Trump asked Ronald Rowe, the Secret Service's acting director, in a meeting on Monday whether it was safe for him to continue playing, the newspaper said. Rowe said the Secret Service views the golf course at Joint Base Andrews in Maryland as easier to secure because it is a military course. That meeting occurred a day after the Secret Service thwarted a second apparent assassination attempt on Trump in less than two months. On Sunday, Secret Service agents fired on Ryan Wesley Routh, the apparent would-be assassin, when they saw the barrel of his gun poking through the fenceline at Trump's golf course in West Palm Beach, Florida, and local police officers later arrested him. The incident has raised questions within Trump's orbit and among lawmakers about whether Trump's protection is sufficient. \"Former President Trump is receiving the highest level of protection that the U.S. Secret Service can provide, and we will continue to evaluate and adjust our specific protective measures and methodology based on each location and situation,\" Secret Service spokesperson Melissa McKenzie said on Tuesday. Still, at least one local official suggested otherwise. On Sunday, West Palm Beach Sheriff Ric Bradshaw told reporters that Trump's security detail was not as tight as that of a sitting president. Since the incident, both Democrats and Republicans have accused each other of using overheated rhetoric that is inspiring political violence. White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said in a press briefing on Tuesday that Republican vice presidential candidate JD Vance's comments about Vice President Kamala Harris not having faced an assassination attempt are dangerous. \"The big difference between conservatives and liberals is that ... no one has tried to kill Kamala Harris in the last couple of months,\" Vance said on Monday. Jean-Pierre said that language could put Harris in danger. \"When you make comments like that, all it does is ... opens an opportunity for people to listen to you and potentially take you very seriously, and so it's dangerous to have that type of rhetoric out there,\" she said. Trump was due to speak at a campaign event in Michigan on Tuesday evening in his first public political event since the apparent assassination attempt over the weekend.

ARC Global, led by Patrick Orlando, was an early investor in Digital World Acquisition Corp. (DWAC), a special-purpose acquisition company that later merged with TMTG, making the company public. Former President Donald Trump owns about 57 percent of TMTG, commonly known as Trump Media. In her ruling, Will found that ARC Global is entitled to receive 8.19 million shares of TMTG, more than the 7.04 million shares previously allocated to it, noting that ARC had “prevailed on aspects of its breach of contract claim.” The case revolved around a contract dispute related to DWAC’s certificate of incorporation. The certificate set the rules for how Class B shares would convert into Class A shares upon a business combination. Orlando, who initially served as DWAC’s CEO, was involved in negotiating the merger with TMTG but was ousted from his role before the transaction was finalized. In its lawsuit against the Trump-controlled company, ARC Global said that TMTG’s board deliberately set a share conversion ratio that was unfavorable to it, reducing ARC’s expected stake. Trump Media had accused Orlando of mismanagement and raised concerns about his handling of the deal. By contrast, ARC Global had argued that personal animus toward Orlando led to the shortfall in shares, a claim Will partly supported by correcting the stock allocation. However, the judge awarded ARC Global far fewer shares than the 10 million it had originally sought, rejecting ARC’s allegations of breach of fiduciary duty against TMTG’s board. The judge concluded that the board’s actions were not driven by bad faith, while criticizing both parties for complicating what should have been a simple process. “What should have been a straightforward exercise in contract interpretation and math was obscured by the parties’ injection of other issues,” Will wrote in the opinion. “ARC claims that the members of DWAC’s board of directors calculated the conversion ratio and made related disclosures in bad faith out of personal animus for ARC’s founder Patrick Orlando.” “In response, the defendants raise a series of affirmative defenses concerning unrelated and purported misconduct by Orlando,” she continued. “I reject these diversions as meritless, irrelevant, or untimely.” The judge noted that, in light of the evidence, she was entering a judgment partly in favor of ARC and partly in favor of Trump Media. After dismissing ARC’s breach of fiduciary duty claims, she determined that the proper conversion ratio should be a value roughly in the middle of what the DWAC had calculated after Orlando’s ouster and what ARC was demanding. “I agree with ARC on some inputs, with the defendants on others, and set the conversion ratio at 1.4911:1,” Will wrote. The contract prevents ARC and Trump Media from selling their stock until the lock-up period expires on Sept. 19, according to Will’s opinion. An implementing order that was filed at the same time as Will’s memorandum opinion requires the parties to “immediately” work to release the additional shares to ARC so that it can freely sell or transfer them after the contractual lock-up period expires in a matter of days. Neither ARC Global nor Trump Media responded to a request for comment on the ruling. Trump told reporters last week that he does not plan to sell his shares in TMTG, a stake that’s now worth around $1.84 billion. Trump Media, which currently has a market cap of around $3.23 billion, saw its value balloon to nearly $10 billion following its Wall Street debut.","summary":"A Delaware judge ruled that Trump Media breached its agreement with ARC Global, but determined that its actions were not driven by bad faith.","url":"https://www.theepochtimes.com/business/judge-orders-trump-media-to-award-early-investor-more-shares-after-contract-dispute-5725920","image":"https://img.theepochtimes.com/assets/uploads/2024/04/05/id5622637-ppapspdasd-LSedit-300x180.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-17 23:59:50","author":"Tom Ozimek","authors":["Tom Ozimek"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.269},{"id":256651614,"title":"Joe Rogan applauds Harris ‘puppet master’ for ‘nailing’ campaign performance: ‘Amazing job’","text":"In Rogan’s latest episode of The Joe Rogan Experience, the podcast host said Harris is “nailing it” while referencing her recent speeches and last week’s debate with former President Donald Trump. “Whoever is helping her, whoever is coaching her, whoever is the puppet master running the strings, you did a f***ing amazing job,” Rogan said. “They did an amazing job from the moment Biden drops out — forcing Biden to drop out, whatever they’re doing, whoever is writing those speeches, getting her to deliver them, coaching her, she’s nailing it.” Rogan continued touting Harris’s debate performance as having baited Trump, likening her comments about Trump’s rallies being boring to jujitsu. “The difference in that debate was not, like, who’s gonna have better policies, who’s gonna be better for the country. The difference in the debate, in my opinion, was who was better prepared. She was way better prepared,” Rogan said. “And even when it came to answering tough questions, instead of answering, she would just say things that she believed. And they sounded real good.” Joining Rogan as his show guest was comedian Tom Segura, who suggested Harris needed to only not “laugh like a stripper” as the means of a cover. He also noted that Trump started out strong but “couldn’t help but get in [his] own way.” Both Rogan and Segura acknowledged Trump’s humor and praised his ability to “just riff.” “He can go out there and have a crowd of people and just — and he’s funny,” Rogan said. “If you don’t like the guy, you still have to acknowledge that he’s funny,” Segura interjected. “He’s funny. He’s funny like a comic,” Rogan then added. ”We don’t necessarily want that as the guy with his finger on the button. … Everyone’s saying he’s going to be a dictator. Well, he wasn’t a dictator.

And the high-power rifle Routh had with him may have been purchased overseas. The new details emerged in the document filed Monday charging Routh, 58, with gun crimes in connection with the incident. Sunday’s incident is the second such attempt on Trump’s life in the past three months. Officials found that the loaded SKS-style 7.62×39 caliber rifle had a serial number that ‘was obliterated and unreadable to the naked eye.’ The agent who wrote the complaint said that such rifles are not manufactured in Florida, and it’s likely the rifle had ‘traveled in interstate or foreign commerce.’ Meanwhile, cell phone location data obtained by the FBI indicates that Routh ‘was located in the vicinity of the area of the tree line’ at the Trump International Golf Course in West Palm Beach from just before 2:00 a.m. Sunday until about 1:30 p.m. That is about when a Secret Service agent, who was checking the course ahead of Trump, spotted a gun muzzle protruding from a nearby fence and fired at Routh. Trump was quickly evacuated. The details suggest some level of advance planning by Routh. Additionally, the fact he spent about 12 hours around the golf course without discovery has raised questions about the Secret Service’s protective procedures. Officials said Routh was on the public side of the Trump golf course’s perimeter fence when the agent spotted the rifle’s muzzle. Law enforcement is still investigating all the details, including where the suspect got the AK-style rifle, his movements ahead of the incident and if anyone else was involved. It’s unclear where Routh may have parked and waited for the former president, who is known to play golf regularly at his West Palm Beach club when at his Mar-a-Lago home nearby. Local police have increased security around the golf club, including closing down the road that leads to it to all but local traffic. At the time the agent spotted the gun on Sunday, Trump was on the fifth hole of his Palm Beach golf club. The agent was on the sixth hole, doing a visual sweep ahead of the former president, when he spotted the muzzle of the rifle. Routh was less than 500 yards from Trump when he was captured. Secret Service Acting Director Ron Rowe said on Monday that Routh was not able to get off a single shot and never had Trump in his ‘line of sight.’ ‘As former President Trump was moving through the fifth fairway, across the course and out of sight of the sixth green, the agent, who was visually sweeping the area of the sixth green, saw the subject armed with what he perceived to be a rifle and immediately discharged his firearm,’ he noted. The Secret Service came under criticism for not securing a wide enough perimeter around Trump at his July 13th rally in Butler, Pa., where Thomas Matthew Crooks attempted to assassinate the former president. But, Rowe noted, the agency had a security plan in place for Trump’s golf game, which he said was unscheduled. ‘We put together a security plan, and that security plan worked,’ he said Monday at a press conference. In the area of the tree line where Routh fled, agents found a digital camera, two bags, a loaded SKS-style 7.62×39 caliber rifle with a scope, and a black plastic bag containing food. On Sunday, after the Secret Service fired and Routh fled, the Martin County Sheriff’s Office began a vehicle stop and Routh was detained at 2:14 p.m. Officers said the license plate of the Nissan he was in was registered to a 2012 white Ford truck that has been reported stolen. Ryan was charged with possession of a firearm by a convicted felon and possession of a firearm with an obliterated serial number. Investigators are trying to restore the serial number so they could trace its origins. He did not appear to fire the gun, law enforcement noted. Apparently the only shots fired were from Secret Service. Even if Routh did not fire the weapon, he could still face an attempted assassination charge. ‘We are investigating this matter as an apparent assassination attempt of Former President Trump,’ FBI special agent Jeffrey Veltri of the Miami field office said Monday afternoon at a press conference. The Secret Service later discovered a rifle, a backpack and a GoPro video camera attached to the fence near where Routh was spotted. Routh appeared in federal court in West Palm Beach for a brief hearing Monday morning wearing a blue jail jumpsuit. U.S. Magistrate Judge Ryon McCabe ordered Routh held without bond until a detention hearing scheduled for Sept. 23. Routh has a lengthy criminal record in North Carolina, including a felony conviction for possession of a weapon of mass destruction and multiple felony counts of possession of stolen goods. He also has ties to Hawaii. where he worked in construction and ran a group building housing for the homeless. He was deeply involved in efforts to recruit soldiers for the fight against Russia in the Ukraine. He traveled to Ukraine in 2022 and later wrote a book: ‘Ukraine’s Unwinnable War.’ Video shot by the AP showed Routh at a small demonstration in Kyiv’s Independence Square in April 2022, two months after Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered an invasion of the country. In the self-published book, which is available on Amazon, Routh was highly critical of Trump and even encouraged Iran to assassinate him. ‘You are free to assassinate Trump,’ Routh wrote of Iran. Routh, who was active on social media, said he voted for Trump in 2016 but, in a post from June 2020, was critical of him. ‘I and the world hoped that president Trump would be different and better than the candidate,’ he wrote. ‘I will be glad when you [sic] gone.’ He also seemed to be no fan of President Joe Biden. ‘Sleepy Joe stands for nothing, no plans, no ideas,’ he wrote in one X post from March 5, 2020.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nTrump stalker Ryan Routh may have been lying in wait for the former&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Ryan Routh, suspected of being connected to Trump, spied on golf course for 12 hours from a hidden spot and possibly used a rifle bought abroad first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/politics/ryan-routh-suspected-of-being-connected-to-trump-spied-on-golf-course-for-12-hours-from-a-hidden-spot-and-possibly-used-a-rifle-bought-abroad/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/rewrite-this-title-Trump-suspect-Ryan-Routh-stalked-golf-course.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-17 23:55:13","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.828},{"id":256650344,"title":"US decision on Nippon's bid for US Steel pushed back until after election","text":"A national security committee reviewing Nippon Steel's bid for U.S. Steel granted a request by the companies to refile their bid for approval of the deal, a person familiar with the matter said on Tuesday, giving the Biden administration until after the U.S. presidential election to make a decision about whether to block the deal.

Trump came close to violence on Sunday when a man allegedly staked out his West Palm Beach golf course and waited with a gun in the bushes near the sixth hole for the former president’s arrival. The news broke dramatically Sunday and generated further reporting on Monday as the suspect, Ryan Routh, made his first appearance in court. But according to Trump’s team it wasn’t covered enough. “Main stream media downplays Trump assassination – again,” Trump’s team wrote to title a release. According to Trump’s team, USA Today “made zero mention of the assassination attempt on their front page following the second assassination attempt on President Trump,” which appears to be true of their Monday paper. They weren’t the only ones. “The Cleveland Plain-Dealer made zero mention of the assassination attempt on the 45th President and the Republican 2024 Nominee,” Trump’s team wrote. “Get your magnifying glass out to find the mention of the assassination attempt on President Trump in the Portland Press-Herald,” they said. Trump’s campaign then blasted Democrats and Vice President Kamala Harris over their political rhetoric. “This culture of extreme and reckless, unchecked statements by Kamala Harris and the Democrat party has stoked unprecedented fear and division in our nation that has gone unchecked by the mainstream media,” they wrote. “Bottom line: extreme rhetoric leads to extreme behavior – and this is evident by the would-be assassin’s social media footprint who posted to X, ‘DEMOCRACY is on the ballot and we cannot lose.’ Sound familiar?” Their assertions come as others point the finger at Trump over recent threats of violence toward immigrant communities. Just this week, schools and government buildings in Springfield, Ohio, were closed due to dozens of bomb threats after Trump repeated falsehoods about Haitian migrants living there. The state’s governor and the city’s mayor — both Republicans — lay the blame for those threats of violence at Trump’s feet. According to Vanessa Cárdenas, executive director at the immigration rights group America’s Voice, Trump’s campaign too often indulges an impulse “to degrade and disparage all immigrants and to continue to spread lies and stoke division is flat-out dangerous.” “They don’t seem to care about the downstream consequences, which are already leading to threats against Haitians and the rest of Springfield and could – like those in El Paso and Pittsburgh and Buffalo and elsewhere – again lead to more real violence. More Republicans should join with Gov. DeWine and Mayor Rue to denounce the ongoing lies and conspiracies being purposely spread by the Trump campaign,” she said.","summary":"According to Trump’s campaign staff, the press needs to call out the Vice President over her language.","url":"https://www.bostonherald.com/2024/09/17/trumps-campaign-thinks-the-media-is-ignoring-an-apparent-attempt-on-his-life/","image":"https://www.bostonherald.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/AP24261843281080.jpg?w=1024","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-17 23:47:13","author":"Matthew Medsger","authors":["Matthew Medsger"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.461},{"id":256649938,"title":"Republican allies boost longshot candidate Jill Stein as Democrats try to remove her from ballots in battleground states","text":"Jill Stein, now on her third run for president with the Green Party, is seen as a longshot for the White House and often called a spoiler candidate who pulls votes from the Democratic side. Though Stein claims her candidacy has a legitimate path to victory without relying on what she calls “war machine” dollars, her campaign has accepted support from Republican allies as she works to secure ballot access in multiple states, including key battleground states like Nevada and Wisconsin, where CBS News polling shows a close race between Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump. In Nevada, where the Green Party was removed from the ballot earlier this month because of incorrect petition forms, according to the Nevada Supreme Court, the party is seeking reinstatement and is being represented by Jay Sekulow, an attorney who represented Trump during his impeachment trials. “In case you missed it, the @NVSOS gave the campaign the wrong forms to use to get on the ballot. Then the dirty Dems used that technicality to sue us off the ballot – we won in lower courts, only to lose in the NV Supreme Court,” Stein wrote on X last week. “Our lawyers have said that we have a case that the US Supreme Court may take which will make ripples nationwide.” On Friday, the Nevada Green Party asked for emergency intervention from the U.S. Supreme Court to review the Nevada Supreme Court’s ruling under the pro bono guidance of Sekulow, the Stein campaign told CBS News. In Wisconsin, where the state Supreme Court ruled to keep Stein on the ballot after declining to hear a Democratic National Committee challenge, Stein accepted legal representation from Michael D. Dean, a Wisconsin lawyer involved in lawsuits attempting to overturn the 2020 election results on behalf of Trump, according to an ethics complaint filed by the bipartisan group The 65 Project. While Democratic allies claim that Stein’s collaboration with Trump-affiliated lawyers is disqualifying, her campaign argues that it’s simply responding to efforts to keep them off the ballot, leaving them no choice but to accept support wherever it comes from — even if it’s from Trump allies. “When the Democrats put us in a position of having to respond to a legal challenge, we’re going to take the help that’s available to us,” said Jason Call, Jill Stein’s campaign manager. “And so the fault begins and ends with the Democratic Party on this. We understand that Republicans are going to want to help us for their own reasons, but our reasons are for democracy.” The Stein campaign learned over the weekend that yet another lawsuit had been filed against the third-party candidate in New Hampshire. In response, the campaign stated it is ready to accept assistance from partisan lawyers if it has to in order to secure ballot access. While there are no laws barring a third-party candidate from accepting pro bono support from another major party in any state, Democratic allies are pushing back on Stein’s ballot access efforts. “These third-party candidates are being presented to voters without a full picture of their views, their financial backers, and the impact they would have on the election,” said Joel Payne, chief communications officer for MoveOn, a left-leaning political action committee. “They also need to be held accountable in good faith or within the bounds of the law—no differently than major party candidates.” The tug-of-war between Republican and Democratic Party allies to influence the outcome of the election extends to other third-party candidates as well. Recent Associated Press reporting shows that Cornel West has a network of GOP operatives supporting his campaign, while Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who suspended his presidential bid last month and endorsed Trump, is now working to remove himself from ballots in states where he believes his candidacy could siphon votes away from Trump. “It seems unity is only convenient for some people when it aligns perfectly with their agenda,” said Edwin DeJesus, spokesperson for the West campaign. “Yet, when lawyers with certain political leanings support Dr. Cornel West, who has consistently spoken out about genocide, it’s suddenly a problem.” Both Stein and West have faced numerous legal challenges from Democratic Party allies aimed at removing them from ballots in various states. “Jill Stein has no path to win the presidency, but just like she did in 2016, she can help Trump win,” said Democratic National Committee spokesperson Matt Corridoni. “That’s why the GOP is doing everything in their power to get third-party candidates on the ballot as spoilers in key swing states. Voters should see this cynical effort for what it is. The fact remains: only two candidates have a path to 270 and the only way to stop Donald Trump is by voting for VP Harris.” Both parties working to influence the ballot outcome in multiple states through third-party candidates isn’t new, experts say. “It’s smart politics, on the Trump end, to try to siphon votes off from Harris,” said John Geer, political science professor at Vanderbilt University. “Politics is not for the faint of heart, and you’ve got to be ready for a lot of ‘unfair’ things to happen because it’s war, it’s a winner takes all contest, and finishing second place is no consolation.” Trump, who has embraced Kennedy as an ally, has previously spoken fondly of both Stein and West. “Cornel West, he’s one of my favorite candidates,” Trump said during a campaign rally in Philadelphia in June. “I like her also, Jill Stein, I like her very much. You know why? She takes 100% from them. He takes 100%.”","summary":"Jill Stein, now on her third run for president with the Green Party, is seen as a longshot for the White House and often called a spoiler candidate who pulls votes from the Democratic side.

The session with the National Association of Black Journalists was one of the few extensive sit-down interviews Harris has done since replacing President Biden atop the Democratic ticket in July. She repeatedly criticized Trump on issues including his handling of the COVID-19 pandemic and opposition to abortion access, but was careful to refer to him as the former president and in other ways that avoided naming him directly. Trump was ramping up his campaigning, too, after the presidential race was roiled by Sunday’s second apparent assassination attempt against him. The former president was holding an evening town hall in Flint, Michigan, and has appearances later in the week in New York, Washington and North Carolina. Trump re-upped his past retaliation threats against election workers, donors and others as he tries to stoke fears about the integrity of the upcoming 2024 election. He posted Tuesday on his social media site, “Those involved in unscrupulous behavior will be sought out, caught, and prosecuted at levels, unfortunately, never seen before.” Harris has her own stops in Washington, as well as Michigan and Wisconsin in coming days, with the two candidates overlapping in concentrating on the industrial Midwest and Pennsylvania and North Carolina – all swing areas that could decide an election expected to be exceedingly close. Harris answered questions from three association journalists at a small, relatively quiet venue at the Philadelphia studios of public radio station WHYY. That was very different from Trump’s addressing the NABJ conference in Chicago in July, when he was antagonistic to the moderators and sparked an uproar by questioning the vice president’s racial identity. Her manner was a departure from her campaign rallies, where Harris often receives some of her loudest applause by declaring that her professional background as a prosecutor means, “I know Donald Trump’s type.” Pressed about reports of eroding support among Black male voters, Harris said she wasn’t “assuming I’m gonna have it because I’m Black.” She ducked a question about whether she’d support efforts by some congressional Democrats for reparations from the government to compensate descendants of slaves for years of unpaid labor by their ancestors. Biden has backed the idea of at least studying reparations. As for Sunday’s arrest at Trump’s Florida golf course, she said she reached him by phone, checking in “to see if he’s OK.” “I told him what I have said publicly, there’s no place for political violence in our country,” the vice president said. The White House described the conversation as cordial and brief. The former president has claimed, without evidence, that months of criticism against him by Harris and Biden, who call him a threat to American democracy, inspired the latest attack. That’s despite Trump’s own long history of inflammatory campaign rhetoric and advocacy for jailing or prosecuting his political enemies. “I really believe that the rhetoric from the Democrats is making the bullets fly, and it’s very dangerous. Dangerous for them. It’s dangerous for both sides,” Trump said in an interview with The Washington Post. So far, Biden and Harris have tried to avoid politics in their responses to Sunday’s incident, instead condemning political violence of all kinds. The president also urged Congress to increase funding to the Secret Service. Authorities say Ryan Wesley Routh camped outside the golf course in West Palm Beach, where Trump was playing on Sunday, for nearly 12 hours with food and a rifle but fled without firing shots when a Secret Service agent spotted and shot at him. Subsequently arrested, Routh’s past online posts suggest he has not been consistent about his politics in terms of supporting Democrats or Republicans. The attack came barely two months after Trump was wounded during a rally in Pennsylvania. Trump’s running mate, Ohio Sen. JD Vance, said at a Georgia Faith & Freedom Coalition event that “it’s popular on a lot of corners of the left to say that we have a both sides problem.” But “no one has tried to kill Kamala Harris in the last couple of months, and two people now have tried to kill Donald Trump.” White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said during her briefing with reporters Tuesday that there should be zero tolerance for violence-inciting rhetoric. She bristled at the suggestion that Biden and Harris have stoked division by calling Trump a threat to democracy, saying that there were concrete examples of the former president being that – such as when he helped incite an attack on the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021. In response to Vance’s comments, Jean-Pierre said, “When you have that type of language out there it’s dangerous. It’s dangerous because people look up to that particular national leader, and they listen to you.” She said such comments open the door for “people to take you very seriously.”","summary":"Meanwhile, the former president held a town hall in Michigan, stoking fear about the upcoming election's integrity.","url":"https://www.centralmaine.com/2024/09/17/harris-strikes-measured-contrast-with-trumps-contentious-appearance-before-black-journalists/","image":"https://w2pcms.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2024/09/AP24261709557658.jpg?w=1024","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-17 23:44:23","author":"Will Weissert,WILL WEISSERT - Associated Press","authors":["Will Weissert","WILL WEISSERT - Associated Press"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.043},{"id":256649452,"title":"Understanding the dangers in Springfield, Ohio following inaccurate statements regarding Haitian immigrants","text":"SPRINGFIELD, Ohio (AP) — A small Ohio city has been inundated with hoax bomb threats since last week’s presidential debate, when former President Donald Trump falsely accused members of Springfield’s Haitian community of abducting and eating cats and dogs.

More than 30 bomb threats have been made against schools, government buildings and city officials’ homes since last week, forcing evacuations and closures. Springfield also canceled its annual celebration of diversity, arts and culture in response to the threats, and on Tuesday, state police were deployed to city schools. Here are some things to know about the situation in Springfield: Who’s behind the hoax threats? Foreign actors, primarily. That’s according to Ohio’s governor, Republican Mike DeWine, who revealed that most of the threats are coming from overseas. The governor’s office says a criminal investigation by multiple law enforcement agencies determined the “vast majority” of the threats were international in origin. Officials did not provide more information on how investigators determined they came from a foreign country, nor would DeWine reveal the name of the country. What’s being done? DeWine sent dozens of members of the Ohio State Highway Patrol to all 18 city schools, where sweeps will be conducted twice a day to prevent further disruption and help reassure parents and students the buildings are safe. Even with the increased police presence, though, many parents still kept their kids home from school on Tuesday. Meanwhile, security cameras have been stationed at strategic spots in the city, and a bomb-sniffing dog was sent to Springfield and will be available round-the-clock. And DeWine pledged $2.5 million over two years to increase support for primary health care. The state highway patrol is also helping local law enforcement with traffic enforcement. DeWine said many Haitians are inexperienced drivers and are unfamiliar with U.S. traffic laws. How is the city responding? Springfield never wanted the spotlight — not in this way. On Tuesday, city officials said that misinformation and falsehoods about Haitian immigrants have sowed fear and division, disrupted learning and cost taxpayer dollars. In a statement, they begged public figures, community members and the media to “move beyond divisive rhetoric and instead work toward fostering unity, understanding and respect.” The statement did not mention Trump or Vance by name. Springfield Mayor Rob Rue has said the immigrant influx is straining police, hospitals and schools. He has also criticized the federal government, saying the city asked for help months ago. But he called on national leaders Tuesday to “temper their words and speak truth.” Why did so many Haitians move to Springfield? Jobs and word of mouth. Springfield shed manufacturing jobs and its population decreased significantly as a result toward the end of the last century. But the city has made a concerted effort to lure employers and Haitians immigrants have helped meet rising demand for labor in factories and warehouses. Word spread, and Haitians began arriving in greater numbers over the last few years. Haitians in Springfield and elsewhere came to the U.S. to flee violence in their home country. Many Haitians are here under a federal program called Temporary Protected Status, which allows them to temporarily live and work in the U.S. because conditions are considered too dangerous for them to return to Haiti. What are Haitian immigrants saying? Members of the Haitian community say they felt uneasy even before Trump and Vance picked up and amplified the lies about pet-eating, as longtime residents chafed at the new arrivals’ impact on jobs, housing and traffic. “Some of them are talking about living in fear. Some of them are scared for their life,” Rose-Thamar Joseph said last week at Springfield’s Haitian Community Help and Support Center. At a church service on Sunday, Mia Perez said her daughter was evacuated from school twice last week. “Kids in school are being asked by other kids: ’How does the dog taste? How does the cat taste?’” Perez said. “She’s asking, ‘Are we the kind of Haitians who eat this kind of stuff? Is it true? What’s happening?’” “This is a conversation that I was not ready to have with my daughter,” Perez said. “I felt disrespected of our culture.” ___ Rubinkam reported from northeastern Pennsylvania.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nSPRINGFIELD, Ohio (AP) — A small Ohio city has been inundated with&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Understanding the dangers in Springfield, Ohio following inaccurate statements regarding Haitian immigrants first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/news/us/understanding-the-dangers-in-springfield-ohio-following-inaccurate-statements-regarding-haitian-immigrants/","image":"https://www.cbs42.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/81/2024/09/66ea1023a239c6.77504779.jpeg?w=900","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-17 23:30:48","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.118},{"id":256649544,"title":"Trump says ‘only consequential presidents get shot at’ after he’s targeted in second assassination attempt","text":"Former President Donald Trump suggested Tuesday that he’s been the subject of multiple assassination attempts because his presidency was “consequential.” “You know, only consequential presidents get shot at,” Trump declared at a town hall in Flint, Mich., two days after the Secret Service foiled the second assassination attempt against him in as many months.

A diversity of Dublin residents support Jean Josey. Kimberly Jong Dublin Trump’s past a good predicter of his future There are lies, damned lies and Trump talk. One key takeaway from the presidential debate is Trump’s use of lies to manipulate voters through fear and to justify his politics of grievance and retribution. During the debate, Trump made baseless claims about Haitians eating dogs and babies being murdered after birth. While his lies elicited giggles, they are extremely dangerous. His lies about Haitians were followed by bomb threats against municipal facilities and schools in Springfield. In 2020, Trump lied about the election and attempted to overturn its results. His falsehoods fueled the Jan. 6 Capitol riot, and he falsely blamed out-of-control Capitol police and Nancy Pelosi. Looking ahead, Trump’s past behavior is a strong predictor of future actions. He has threatened to prosecute politicians, judges and media personnel. Essentially, this overrides the Constitution. Trump’s use of lies to justify self-serving ends will continue if he is elected. Larry Bieber Castro Valley Trump’s Swift post is typically hateful, small Re: “Donald Trump ‘hates’ Taylor Swift after her endorsement of Kamala Harris” (Sept. 16). It seems logical that any serious candidate for president should be morally, if not legally, required to refrain from expressing overt hatred for any individual or group. Yet Donald Trump posted “I HATE TAYLOR SWIFT” on his site, in all caps. This expression of hatred is repulsive when directed at anyone — but Taylor Swift? He has never expressed hatred toward Vladimir Putin or Hitler — indeed, only admiration — but hatred for Taylor Swift, the most beloved artist on the planet at the moment. I believe that Trump secretly does not want to be president again. Jim Hogan El Sobrante Trump’s vitriol at play in assassination attempts Re: “Agents fire at suspect near Trump” (Page A1, Sept. 16). Political violence and hate can never be managed or contained. During the presidential debate, the Republican nominee for president falsely accused migrants from Haiti of kidnapping and eating pets of citizens in Ohio. This false claim resulted in bomb threats and the closure of local schools. Subsequently, the Republican nominee posted a direct message of hate toward one of the most inspiring and beloved musical artists in the world. On the same day the Republican nominee posted that message, a violent attack against him was (thankfully) thwarted by the Secret Service. Propagating hatred and violence results in hatred and violence. Barry Gardin Hayward Undecideds should throw support to Harris It amazes me that there are still undecided voters in this year’s presidential election. The differences between the candidates could not be more stark. It’s living in freedom in a democracy or living in a police state under a dictator. It’s being led by a lawyer who knows and respects the law or a convicted felon who thinks the law doesn’t apply to him. It’s having affordable health care or being uninsurable because of pre-existing conditions. It’s having hope for the future or living in fear that the Proud Boys will roll into town and start breaking heads. Their respective records speak for themselves. What more do undecided voters want? I’m not sure at this point if they even know what else they want. Vote for democracy and not dictatorship. After the second debate and the vitriol coming out of Donald Trump and JD Vance, it’s a no-brainer. Ramona Krausnick Dublin Letter gets its civics lesson backward Re: “Electoral College guards against majority tyranny” (Page A8, Sept 15). The Electoral College weighs some people’s votes more than others, four times more for Wyoming’s voters compared to California’s. That’s not fair. It resulted in two presidential candidates with fewer votes becoming president in this modern century. While the letter-writer says it would not be fair if “New York and California elect a president,” he should realize that, absent the Electoral College, people elect the president, not states. With the Electoral College, seven so-called swing states get all the campaign attention because only those states matter in the current election. The rest of us have no voice. That just ain’t right.

It’s a form of freedom of speech,” White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said in response to a press-briefing question from reporter Raquel Krähenbühl of Brazil’s TV Globo. Brazil blocked the country’s more than 200 million residents from using X on Aug. 30 after Alexandre de Moraes, a powerful member of the country’s supreme court, demanded the censorship of a large number of accounts featuring alleged hate speech or misinformation. Musk refused, describing the diktat as anti-democratic and calling the judge a repressive “dictator” and “Brazil’s Darth Vader.” X pulled the company’s reps out of Brazil when de Moraes threatened to arrest them for not censoring the list of users ahead of the blanket ban. “Social media is not a no man’s land!” de Moraes wrote in an April ruling as his fight with Musk escalated. Ordinary Brazilians can still access X using VPN providers, but they can be fined for doing so under de Moraes’ policies. Musk, 53, purchased Twitter in 2022 with a goal of restoring the platform’s pro-free speech principles — after prior management engaged in rampant political censorship, including of accurate information, such as The Post’s reporting in late 2020 on documents from first son Hunter Biden’s laptop that showed his father, President Biden, was involved in foreign business relationships in China and Ukraine. Jean-Pierre urged unrestricted access to social media despite President Biden signing bipartisan legislation requiring the sale or closure of Chinese-owned social network TikTok by January 19, the last full day of Biden’s term. Former President Donald Trump, the Republican presidential nominee, whom Musk supports in the Nov. 5 election against Vice President Kamala Harris, opposes the ban on TikTok. “Just so everyone knows, especially the young people, Crooked Joe Biden is responsible for banning TikTok,” Trump wrote on Truth Social in April after Biden signed the law. “He is the one pushing it to close, and doing it to help his friends over at Facebook become richer and more dominant, and able to continue to fight, perhaps illegally, the Republican Party.”","summary":"Brazil blocked the country's more than 200 million residents from using X on Aug. 30.","url":"https://nypost.com/2024/09/17/us-news/white-house-condemns-brazil-for-banning-x-in-free-speech-fight-with-elon-musk/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/09/027B6E3E000003E8.t.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/feKHuybG-RyIcpnTz.mp4","publish_date":"2024-09-17 23:28:48","author":"Steven Nelson","authors":["Steven Nelson"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.267},{"id":256650988,"title":"Democrats Tee Up ‘Catholics for Harris-Walz’ Coalition","text":"A virtual campaign event designed to organize Catholic support for Vice President Kamala Harris’ 2024 presidential candidacy is set to take place on the evening of Wednesday, Sept. 18. The “Catholics for Harris-Walz National Organizing Call,” which is open to the public, will be held Wednesday evening from 8 p.m. until 9 p.m. The campaign originally planned to hold the event prior to last month’s Democratic National Convention, but it was abruptly canceled. Organizers at the time cited a scheduling conflict as the reason for its cancellation. “The call will be an opportunity to hear directly from the campaign about our vision, next steps, and how you can get involved and take part in this historic moment,” the event’s description reads. “We will be joined by special guests and community leaders to discuss the deciding role the Catholic vote will play in the upcoming election.” A coalition of advocacy groups, including Catholics Vote Common Good, is organizing the call in tandem with the campaign. The group is part of the broader Vote Common Good nonprofit, which mobilizes various faith groups in support of progressive candidates. Catholics Vote Common Good has already been organizing weekly phone banking on behalf of Harris’ presidential campaign. The nonprofit, along with Catholic Democrats, has also relaunched the “Catholics4Kamala” website, which briefly went offline after the original event was canceled. The website does not directly address Harris’ strong support for abortion but instead states that “even on the life issue, there is an eerie silence among conservatives about the rise in abortion numbers nationally since the Dobbs decision reversing Roe v. Wade” on its “About” page. Harris supports codifying the abortion standards set in Roe v. Wade, which would prevent states from passing laws that protect unborn life prior to fetal viability. In the Sept. 12 debate with former president Donald Trump, Harris refused to say whether she supports late-term abortion in the seventh, eighth and ninth months of pregnancy. More than 9,000 late-term abortions are performed in the United States annually after the 21st week of pregnancy. The website states that a Harris presidency “looks forward to the promise of an America that embraces and celebrates our diversity among people of many races, beliefs, and genders — an America that is caring and uplifting for all, seeks to provide the opportunity for everyone to achieve their God-given potential, and brings joy back to our politics.” “Catholics are coming together to support the Harris-Walz ticket because of the threat that a second Trump presidency poses to reverse the progress against global warming, to explode the deficit with more tax cuts, to transform the Justice Department into an instrument for vindictiveness, to abandon Ukraine in its fight for sovereignty, and to hamstring our economy through a massive race-centered deportation operation,” the website adds. Harris has advocated other positions that are contrary to Catholic teaching, such as gender ideology. As a senator, Harris also pointedly scrutinized judicial nominees for their membership in the Knights of Columbus, a Catholic fraternal organization. The Trump-Vance campaign launched its Catholics for Trump coalition earlier this month, which emphasizes the defense of religious liberty, traditional values, and the sanctity of human life as priorities. A Pew poll released last week showed that a slim majority of Catholics supported Trump over Harris, with the former president receiving 52% support and the vice president getting 47%. An EWTN News/RealClear poll earlier this month showed Harris with a slight lead among Catholics at 50% of the vote compared with Trump’s 43%.","summary":"cna","url":"https://www.ncregister.com/cna/democrats-tee-up-catholics-for-harris-walz-coalition","image":"https://publisher-ncreg.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/pb-ncregister/swp/hv9hms/media/20240917170916_e154aa7f93dd1cf117f7031f90bd67e31e85f78b44d4fcd2bcb5412da707019d.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-17 23:26:18","author":"Tyler Arnold/cna","authors":["Tyler Arnold/cna"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.188},{"id":256649308,"title":"Kamala Harris Tells Reporter 'Let Me Finish' Amid Exchange About Israel","text":"Vice President Kamala Harris was pressed on her policies surrounding the war in Gaza while speaking to members of the National Association of Black Journalists (NABJ) on Tuesday.The Democratic presidential nominee reestablished during the interview in Philadelphia that she stands for a ceasefire deal between Israel and the Palestinian militant group Hamas, as well as for a two-state solution after the conflict is settled. Harris has said that she supports Israel's right to defend itself after the October 7 attacks but that \"how it does so matters.\"An NABJ interviewer specifically asked Harris to define \"the line between aggression and defense\" in terms of Israel's military action, which, according to the Gaza health ministry, has killed over 40,000 Palestinians, per the Associated Press. In Hamas' attacks in October, 1,200 people were killed and approximately 250 others were taken hostage.Harris responded to the question by stating that she \"absolutely\" believes \"this war has to end\" and acknowledged the lives lost on October 7, adding that Israel \"has the right to defend itself. We would.\" An NABJ panelist interrupted the vice president partly through her answer, stating that her question was regarding \"the difference between aggression and defense.\"\"No no, let me finish—it's important to put it in context, which is what I'm doing,\" Harris said, adding that she'll \"get to\" addressing the journalist's question later.Harris' campaign has faced pressure from large swathes of the Democratic voter base including some progressive lawmakers to take a step back from Washington's support of Israel amid the war in Gaza. The vice president did call for a ceasefire in the conflict more quickly than President Joe Biden, but she has aligned herself with many of the president's policies, including the refusal of calls to adopt an arms embargo against Israel.Harris on Tuesday said that she supported Biden's decision to withhold shipments of bombs to Israel in May as the Israeli military prepared for a ground invasion of the city of Rafah. Biden eventually lifted part of the freeze and sent Israel a shipment of 500-pound bombs in July. The U.S. has continued to hold off on sending shipments of 2,000-pound bombs.When pressed further on if she would make any specific policy changes as president, however, Harris told the NABJ panel, \"We need to get this deal done ... and that is my position, that is my policy.\"\"We are doing the work of putting the pressure on all parties involved to get the deal done,\" Harris added. \"But let me be very clear also, I support Israel's ability to defend itself, and I support the need for Palestinians to have dignity, self-determination and security as we move forward and get a two-state deal done.\"Newsweek reached out to Harris' campaign for additional comment on Tuesday.Republican presidential candidate and former President Donald Trump has accused Harris of opposing the state of Israel.

McCollum said in a statement. Topeka Fire Department crews found several pieces of mail with an unknown substance on them, though a field test found no hazardous materials, spokesperson Rosie Nichols said. Several employees in both offices had been exposed to it and had their health monitored, she said. In Oklahoma, the State Election Board received a suspicious envelope in the mail containing a multi-page document and a white, powdery substance, agency spokesperson Misha Mohr said in an email to The Associated Press. The Oklahoma Highway Patrol, which oversees security for the Capitol, secured the envelope. Testing determined the substance was flour, Mohr said. State workers in an office building next to the Wyoming Capitol in Cheyenne were sent home for the day pending testing of a white substance mailed to the secretary of state's office. Suspicious letters were sent to election offices and government buildings in at least six states last November, including the same building in Kansas that received suspicious mail Monday. While some of the letters contained fentanyl, even the suspicious mail that was not toxic delayed the counting of ballots in some local elections. One of the targeted offices was in Fulton County, Georgia, the largest voting jurisdiction in one of the nation's most important swing states. Four county election offices in Washington state had to be evacuated as election workers were processing ballots cast, delaying vote-counting. The letters caused election workers around the country to stock up the overdose reversal medication naloxone. Election offices across the United States have taken steps to increase the security of their buildings and boost protections for workers amid an onslaught of harassment and threats following the 2020 election and the false claims that it was rigged. ___ LeBlanc reported from Boston.

Wyoming officials have not yet said if the material sent there was hazardous. \"We have specific protocols in place for situations such as this,\" Iowa Secretary of State Paul Pate said in a statement after the evacuation of the six-story Lucas State Office Building in Des Moines. \"We immediately reported the incident per our protocols.\" A state office building in Topeka, Kansas, was evacuated due to suspicious mail sent to both the secretary of state and attorney general, Kansas Highway Patrol spokesperson April M. McCollum said in a statement. Topeka Fire Department crews found several pieces of mail with an unknown substance on them, though a field test found no hazardous materials, spokesperson Rosie Nichols said. Several employees in both offices had been exposed to it and had their health monitored, she said. In Oklahoma, the State Election Board received a suspicious envelope in the mail containing a multi-page document and a white, powdery substance, agency spokesperson Misha Mohr said in an email to The Associated Press. The Oklahoma Highway Patrol, which oversees security for the Capitol, secured the envelope. Testing determined the substance was flour, Mohr said. State workers in an office building next to the Wyoming Capitol in Cheyenne were sent home for the day pending testing of a white substance mailed to the secretary of state's office. Suspicious letters were sent to election offices and government buildings in at least six states last November, including the same building in Kansas that received suspicious mail Monday. While some of the letters contained fentanyl, even the suspicious mail that was not toxic delayed the counting of ballots in some local elections. One of the targeted offices was in Fulton County, Georgia, the largest voting jurisdiction in one of the nation's most important swing states. Four county election offices in Washington state had to be evacuated as election workers were processing ballots cast, delaying vote-counting. The letters caused election workers around the country to stock up the overdose reversal medication naloxone. Election offices across the United States have taken steps to increase the security of their buildings and boost protections for workers amid an onslaught of harassment and threats following the 2020 election and the false claims that it was rigged. ___ LeBlanc reported from Boston.

But lower down on the ticket, Democrats are struggling to keep their 51–49 lead in the Senate. Senator Joe Manchin’s retirement from his seat in West Virginia is almost certain to go to a Republican next term, which means that Democrats likely need to re-elect all of their vulnerable incumbents in order to control 50 seats and retain the majority (and win the White House, given that the vice president is the tiebreaker). As my colleague Russell Berman, who covers politics, noted to me this morning, the national “Harris effect” may not transform statewide races. As Election Day approaches, he told me, “the polls are starting to tighten and more closely resemble the presidential races in swing states.” Below is a guide to several Senate races that may be decisive—or at least interesting to watch—and what they tell us about where the parties are headed. Montana Montana, which went heavily for Donald Trump in 2020, could determine whether the Democrats hold on to the majority in the Senate. It’s not looking promising. Senator Jon Tester, the well-liked incumbent running against the Republican businessman Tim Sheehy, recently fell behind in the polls. In 2018, Tester won in spite of a personal campaign by Trump to push him out of office—one that involved four visits to the state to rally for his Republican challenger. In the years since Tester was first elected, in 2006, his home state, once known for political independence, has gotten redder. He is now the only statewide Democratic elected official there, and he is slipping: The Cook Political Report had considered the Montana race a toss-up over the summer but deemed it Republican-leaning earlier this month. Ohio In another state that has turned redder in recent years, incumbent Senator Sherrod Brown is in a true toss-up race against Bernie Moreno. Moreno, a businessman who has not held elected office, got an endorsement from Trump with J. D. Vance’s support. Earlier this month, Moreno boosted Vance’s racist lies about Haitian immigrants in Ohio. Democrats have framed him as a rich man who is primarily a friend to the rich. Brown, meanwhile, is a longtime congressman and a self-styled champion of the working class. As my colleague George Packer wrote in a profile of Brown in 2019, “Brown’s whole career … has been a steady, if unspectacular and often losing, fight for the well-being of working people.” Even so, many of the blue-collar voters in his state have backed Trump in recent years. Pennsylvania In Pennsylvania, arguably the most crucial swing state in the presidential race, incumbent Senator Bob Casey is polling just ahead of Republican David McCormick. You may remember McCormick from his close primary loss to Mehmet Oz, a.k.a. Dr. Oz, in the 2022 midterms (Oz ended up losing to then–Lieutenant Governor John Fetterman). Casey, in spite of having held his office for three terms now, has described feeling like the “underdog” in the race because of all the money flowing in from Republican PACs and donors (including McCormick’s own money). The state’s Senate race is one of the most expensive in the country, with major cash flowing in from out of state. And opponents have raised questions about McCormick’s own history in Pennsylvania: Though he owns property in Pittsburgh and says he lives in-state, the Associated Press reported last fall that he appears to maintain a rented $16 million residence in Westport, Connecticut. Arizona After the former television anchor Kari Lake lost her gubernatorial bid in 2022, she sued officials to overturn the results. She lost that case and her appeal. Now she’s running for Senate in a state where the presidential race is currently in a dead heat. Lake is trailing her Democratic opponent, Representative Ruben Gallego, in the polls. Still, she has parlayed her fealty to Trump into a national profile that, at one point, reportedly had her in consideration to be Trump’s vice-presidential pick. Even if Lake loses her race, which seems likely, her transformation from news anchor and onetime Barack Obama donor to loyal emissary of the Trump agenda is a striking case of opportunism in the MAGA era. As Meghan McCain told my colleague Elaine Godfrey in 2022, “She is a savant at imitating Trump.” Michigan In another toss-up race, Democratic Representative Elissa Slotkin is facing off against Mike Rogers, who formerly served in the House. Slotkin, whose résumé includes work as a CIA analyst and as an acting assistant secretary of defense, is running to replace the retiring longtime senator Debbie Stabenow. Rogers, who has criticized Trump in the past, has since embraced the MAGA movement; Trump has in turn embraced him, offering an endorsement earlier this year. Michigan—though it went for Trump in 2016 and is now considered a true swing state—has not elected a Republican Senator since the 1990s. Florida Senator Rick Scott, the wealthiest member of Congress, is running as an incumbent in a tight race against challenger Debbie Mucarsel-Powell. Scott, the former Florida governor who has poured $13 million of his own money into his campaign committee since his election in 2018, has tried to become a player on the national stage, but results have been mixed. Mucarsel-Powell, who was born in Ecuador, became the first South American immigrant elected to the House, where she served from 2019 to 2021. Now she is running in one of the two states, Florida and Texas, where Democrats are mounting bids to flip consistently red states. Her national profile is lower than Scott’s, but she may benefit from national funds: Her campaign was among the states to get an injection of funding from national Democrats’ $25 million push for voter outreach in Senate races. Maryland Republican former Governor Larry Hogan—whose crusade to steer his party from Trumpism back to big-tent, Reagan-style conservatism led my colleague Mark Leibovich to wonder in 2022 whether Hogan was living in a “fantasy world”—is unlikely to win a Senate seat on his home turf, at least according to current polling. His entrance into the race, which apparently had been pushed by national Republican Party members, came as a surprise to many observers: He had publicly insisted in the past that he wouldn’t seek the seat. He is running against Angela Alsobrooks, the Prince George’s County executive, in a reliably blue state that loved him as governor.

Jean-Pierre said it wasn’t possible to address the potential policy because the Republican ex-president pitched the idea as part of his campaign to reclaim the White House — even though Biden, Harris and Jean-Pierre got behind Trump’s “no tax on tips” proposal without acknowledging its source. “The question that you’re asking me — supporting overtime pay, this is something, a proposal in the 2024 election so I’m going to be really, really mindful,” Jean-Pierre said in response to a question from Fox Business journalist Edward Lawrence at her regular briefing. Trump has floated other populist policies that Harris, the Democratic presidential nominee, and Biden, the retiring incumbent, have yet to endorse — including eliminating income taxes on Social Security benefits and making IVF fertility treatments free for would-be parents. The ideas have caused heartburn for some fiscal conservatives concerned about the growing national debt, though Trump has argued that reducing taxes would boost US productivity and tax revenue and that more childbearing would be beneficial for US society. Jean-Pierre argued Tuesday that Trump’s administration actually was detrimental to workers by reducing eligibility for overtime — citing a 2019 regulation that required companies to pay salaried workers overtime if their annual base pay was beneath $35,568. A pending rule from the final year of the Obama-Biden administration had set the figure higher at $47,476. “We also can’t forget what the last administration did,” Jean-Pierre argued. “They eliminated overtime protections for millions of workers. The Biden-Harris administration restored overtime protection to 1 million workers and next year we will extend protections to another 3 million workers. That means our admin is ensuring higher paychecks and more time with families.” In addition to the federal overtime rules, most Americans live in states that have their own OT mandates. About half of states require companies to pay workers 1.5 times their normal hourly wage when they work more than 40 hours per week — with that policy in force in states including New York, Illinois, Pennsylvania, Michigan and North Carolina. In California, workers in some instances are entitled to double-time when exceeding the standard workweek.","summary":"White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre declined to say Tuesday whether President Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris support Donald Trump's call to end federal income taxes on overtime pay.","url":"https://nypost.com/2024/09/17/us-news/white-house-wont-say-if-kamala-harris-biden-back-trumps-call-to-end-taxes-on-overtime/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/09/newspress-collage-k4aqcuyac-1726614679474.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&1726600320&w=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/fVDwlCaa-RyIcpnTz.mp4","publish_date":"2024-09-17 23:20:40","author":"Steven Nelson","authors":["Steven Nelson"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.283},{"id":256649632,"title":"Vance remarks on Harris are dangerous, White House says","text":"WASHINGTON >> The White House said today that Republican vice presidential candidate JD Vance’s comments about Vice President Kamala Harris not having faced an assassination attempt were dangerous. Vance’s Republican running mate, former President Donald Trump, is seeking to best Harris, the Democratic presidential nominee, in the Nov. 5 race for the White House. Trump and Vance have escalated their attacks on Harris and Democrats since the Secret Service foiled what the FBI called an apparent assassination attempt against Trump on Sunday while the former president was golfing in West Palm Beach, Florida. “The big difference between conservatives and liberals is that … no one has tried to kill Kamala Harris in the last couple of months and two people now have tried to kill Donald Trump in the last couple of months,” Vance, a U.S. senator from Ohio, said. He suggested Democrats “tone down” their criticism. White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre suggested Vance’s language could put Harris in danger. “When you make comments like that, all it does is … opens an opportunity for people to listen to you and potentially take you very seriously, and so it’s dangerous to have that type of rhetoric out there,” she told reporters today. So-called stochastic terrorism, in which sometimes unstable individuals are inspired to violence by hate speech, online extremism and public figures, played a role in the violent attack on Paul Pelosi, husband of former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, terror experts believe. Jean-Pierre noted that President Joe Biden has called for political rhetoric in the United States to cool down. “We should not be speaking that way. We should not be saying those things,” she said. “We gotta tone it down.” Harris and Biden have argued that Trump poses a threat to U.S. democracy, citing his refusal to accept the results of the 2020 election and his role in urging supporters to go to the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021. Vance’s comment echoes one made by billionaire Elon Musk, who mused in a post on the X social media platform about a lack of assassination attempts against Biden and Harris. Musk, who supports Trump and owns the platform, formerly known as Twitter, later took the post down. The Secret Service, which is charged with protecting presidents and other U.S. officials, said it was aware that he had written it.

This is the second time the GOP Senate has dodged the widely popular legislation, with Republicans claiming the bid is unnecessary and an effort to boost Vice President Kamala Harris on the presidential campaign trail as she highlights family access to IVF. During last week’s presidential debate, Republican nominee Donald Trump insisted that he was “a leader on IVF, which is fertilization.” However, throughout his campaign, Trump has waffled on reproductive rights in an attempt to win over both moderate Republicans and religious conservatives — a fact that was painfully clear during his first debate against Harris and has drawn backlash from within his own party. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.), who forced the vote Tuesday, called on his GOP counterparts to take a hard stance on the issue. “Here’s what we’re asking our Republican friends,” Schumer said at a press conference. “Do you support American families’ access to in vitro fertilization or not?” Senate Minority Whip John Thune (R-S.D.) called the measure “another show vote” and stated that “Republicans support IVF, full stop.” Trump’s own running mate, Sen. J.D. Vance (R-OH) skipped out on Tuesday’s Senate vote to protect access to IVF. When asked to comment on the blocked legislation, Vance dismissed the bid as a “show vote bill that had no chance of passing.” Following the news, Harris released a statement: “Senate Republicans just blocked a bill to protect access to IVF nationwide. They made clear — again — that they will not protect access to the fertility treatments many couples need to fulfill their dream of having a child.”","summary":"GOP Senators blocked a Democratic bill that would require public and private insurance to provide IVF coverage","url":"https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-news/senate-republicans-block-ivf-protection-bill-trump-1235104863/","image":"https://www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/john-thune-sen-gop-block-ivf-protections.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-17 23:19:25","author":"Charisma Madarang","authors":["Charisma Madarang"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.003},{"id":256650018,"title":"Harris gains in post-debate US national polls, but will her gains be sustained?","text":"The United States presidential election will be held on November 5. In analyst Nate Silver’s aggregate of national polls, Democrat Kamala Harris leads Republican Donald Trump by 48.9–46.0. In my previous US politics article on September 9, Harris led Trump by 48.7–46.2. Joe Biden’s final position before his withdrawal as Democratic candidate on July 21 was a national poll deficit against Trump of 45.2–41.2. By the election, Biden will be almost 82, Trump is now 78 and Harris will be 60. Harris has been boosted by her performance in the September 10 debate between Harris and Trump, and she needed this boost after her national lead dropped below two points in Silver’s aggregate before there were many post-debate polls. In a YouGov poll for Yahoo news that was taken in the three days after the debate, respondents thought Harris won the debate by 56–26 over Trump. Harris may have been further boosted by Trump continuing after the debate with the baseless claims about Haitian immigrants eating pets. We don’t yet have any polls conducted since Sunday’s second assassination attempt against Trump, and this may interrupt Harris’ debate bounce. Before the debate, Harris was dropping slowly from a four-point lead in national polls on August 25 to two points at the debate. It’s unlikely there will be another presidential debate, and Harris’ debate bounce could fade. Harris’ Electoral College problem The US president isn’t elected by the national popular vote, but by the Electoral College, in which each state receives electoral votes equal to its federal House seats (population based) and senators (always two). Almost all states award their electoral votes as winner takes all, and it takes 270 electoral votes to win (out of 538 total). Relative to the national popular vote, the Electoral College is biased to Trump. According to Silver’s model, Harris needs at least a two-point popular vote win to be the Electoral College favourite. She needs at least a four-point popular vote win to be a 94% favourite in the Electoral College. Harris’ Electoral College win probability in Silver’s model has improved from a low of 35% on September 9 to 43.5% today, but Trump is still the favourite with a 56% win probability. The projection of the popular vote is a Harris win by 50.3–48.5, and this 1.8-point margin is lower than Harris’ 2.9-point margin in current polls, implying some debate bounce adjustment. Harris has a 67% chance to win the national popular vote, but there’s a 24% chance in Silver’s model that she wins the popular vote, but loses the Electoral College. There have not yet been many state polls conducted since the debate, and we will need to wait for them to know more. Pennsylvania, with 19 electoral votes, remains the most important state for either Harris or Trump to win. If either wins Pennsylvania, their chance to win is over 90%. The polling average in Pennsylvania gives Harris a 0.5-point lead. The FiveThirtyEight forecast model is far more favourable to Harris than Silver’s model, with Harris now at a 61% Electoral College win probability in this model. This appears to be because its popular vote projection is at Harris by 4.2 points, implying that she will slightly expand her current lead, not have it reduced. US economic data In August US headline inflation rose 0.2%, the same increase as in July. In the last 12 months, it has risen 2.5%, the smallest 12-month increase since 2021. Core inflation rose 0.3% in August, the highest monthly core increase since April; it has risen 3.2% in the last 12 months. In August, real (inflation-adjusted) hourly earnings were up 0.2% and real weekly earnings up 0.5% owing to an increase in hours worked. In the last 12 months, real hourly earnings were up 1.3% and real weekly earnings up 0.9%. In August, the unemployment rate was down 0.1% from July to 4.2%. The July unemployment rate of 4.3% was the highest since October 2021, when the US was recovering from the COVID recession. In July, the personal savings rate was down 0.2% from June to 2.9%, its lowest since June 2022. Silver’s economic index that calculates the average of six indicators is at +0.06, suggesting an economy just above average. Silver wrote last Friday that the Electoral College and the economy are two key reasons to favour Trump in the election. Australian state polls: WA and Victoria The Western Australian state election will be held in March 2025. The Poll Bludger reported on September 11 that a Freshwater poll for The West Australian gave Labor a 55–45 lead, from primary votes of 39% Labor, 38% Liberals and Nationals, 11% Greens and 12% for all Others. This poll agrees with a Wolf + Smith WA poll that also gave Labor a 55–45 lead. The sample size was 1,045. Labor Premier Roger Cook had a +7 net approval, while Liberal leader Libby Mettam had a +4 net approval. Former premier Mark McGowan was at +41. Cook had a 46–34 preferred premier lead over Mettam. A Victorian Resolve poll for The Age, conducted with the August and September federal Resolve polls from a sample of over 1,000, gave the Coalition 37% of the primary vote (steady since July), Labor 27% (steady), the Greens 14% (down one), independents 15% (steady) and others 7% (up one). Resolve doesn’t usually give a two-party figure, but The Poll Bludger estimated “a roughly even split”. Labor’s Jacinta Allan led the Liberals’ John Pesutto by just 30–29 as preferred premier (31–28 previously). By 43–27, voters supported building the Suburban Rail Loop (SRL). But given a choice between the SRL and a rail link connecting the airport and city, 53% chose the airport rail link and just 16% the SRL.","summary":"The Democratic nominee has received a sizeable bounce following her strong performance in the presidential debate.","url":"https://theconversation.com/harris-gains-in-post-debate-us-national-polls-but-will-her-gains-be-sustained-239059","image":"https://images.theconversation.com/files/619989/original/file-20240917-16-dvl3lv.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&rect=0%2C117%2C4888%2C2440&q=45&auto=format&w=1356&h=668&fit=crop","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-17 23:18:59","author":"Adrian Beaumont,Election Analyst Psephologist at The Conversation; and Honorary Associate,School of Mathematics and Statistics,The University of Melbourne","authors":["Adrian Beaumont","Election Analyst Psephologist at The Conversation; and Honorary Associate","School of Mathematics and Statistics","The University of Melbourne"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"au","sentiment":-0.291},{"id":256649538,"title":"Vance Denies ‘Fried Chicken’ Remark Was Aimed at Kamala","text":"JD Vance took his secret weapon with him Tuesday on the campaign trail: his wife, Usha, whose Indian-American heritage may serve to blunt the fallout from racial stereotypes that Republicans have aimed at Kamala Harris. The vice presidential aspirant spent most of his speech at an event in battleground Michigan lambasting critics for stoking political violence, including a second apparent assassination attempt on Donald Trump. What he did not address, however, was something largely lost in the midst of Sunday’s mayhem in West Palm Beach, Florida. Earlier that day on television Vance dodged a question about whether he or his wife were offended by insults aimed at Harris. “I make a mean chicken curry. I don’t think that it’s insulting for anybody to talk about their dietary preferences or what they want to do in the White House,” Vance told NBC’s “Meet the Press.” But he took it a step further, making a remark that was interpreted by some as more race-baiting stereotyping. “Kamala Harris is running for president and whether you’re eating curry at your dinner table or fried chicken, things have gotten more expensive thanks to her policies,” Vance told moderator Kristen Welker. JD and Usha Vance walked out together at Tuesday’s rally and kissed briefly before he took the stage and she found a spot out of sight. Usha Vance, who, like Harris, is Indian-American, didn’t speak at the event. But her presence by her husband’s side served as a reminder that she can be a powerful shield. Vance’s comments got little notice on Sunday when he dodged Welker’s questions about racist tropes promulgated by right-wing provocateur and Trump confidante Laura Loomer, who said if Harris wins the election the White House will become a “call center” and “smell like curry.” Vance, through a spokesperson, denied that his answer about fried chicken was aimed at Harris, who is a biracial Black woman. “Senator Vance was referring to the fact that he prefers fried chicken, and his wife prefers curry chicken,” a spokesman for Vance told the Daily Beast. “Fried chicken was a staple in the Vance household when JD was a kid, as he wrote in Hillbilly Elegy.” The Harris campaign did not respond to requests for comment about whether the Democratic presidential candidate was offended by Vance’s reference to culinary choices. The left-leaning news site Raw Story linked to former FBI agent Asha Rangappa’s post in which she said, “Curry or…fried chicken? Good lord he’s like the KKK whisperer.” Vance and his wife were also accompanied Tuesday by their German Shepherd, Atlas, who has traveled with them before aboard Trump Force Two, the campaign’s nickname for Vance’s plane.

Doocy pressed back by asking whether someone might take her comments literally, and Jean-Pierre responded by repeating \"Jan. 6\" over and over. A second attempt on Trump's life was thwarted by the arrest of an allegedly armed man hiding in the bushes outside of Trump International Golf Course on Sunday.

Bush, said during a Fox News appearance on Tuesday that he did not believe the Trump campaign's internal polling after host Paul Gigot noted that Fabrizio claimed \"movement among undecided voters was towards Trump.\"\"Every other poll that has been conducted since the debate shows that the movement has been towards Harris, albeit very modest,\" Rove said. \"I'm always suspicious of campaigns that issue their own numbers in order to correct a bad day ... Right now, the evidence tends to lean the other way.\"\"But again, modestly,\" he added. \"I mean, we're talking about changes in these polls ... I think of the four polls I've seen, the biggest change is two points.\"Newsweek reached out for comment to the Trump campaign via email on Tuesday.Trump claimed in a pair of Truth Social posts on Saturday that his supposed debate win was \"now reflected in the polls,\" pointing to a Rasmussen Reports poll that showed him up by 6 points on September 12.However, while a scientific poll, the Rasmussen survey was conducted with a relatively small sample size and revealed wildly different results on a day-to-day basis. The next edition of the poll, released on September 15, showed Harris up by 6 points.Most recent national polls have shown Harris continuing to maintain a small but significant lead over Trump following the debate, with races in key battleground states remaining neck-and-neck.An average of recent national polls compiled by FiveThirtyEight showed Harris leading Trump by 3 points as of Tuesday, while an average from RealClearPolitics showed the vice president leading by 2 points.Polls also largely suggest that the Democratic candidate—not the former president—received a post-debate polling \"bump.\" While several polls showed that support for Harris only increased by around 1 percentage point, the vice president did receive a substantial boost in at least one survey.A YouGov/Yahoo News poll conducted in the days following the debate showed Harris leading Trump by 50 percent to 45 percent among registered voters. Trump was only trailing the vice president by 1 point in the previous edition of the poll, which was conducted shortly after the Democratic National Convention.One poll released by Atlas Insights—an outlier that shows Trump leading Harris by 3 points overall—found that support for the ex-president improved by 1 point after the debate.","summary":"The Trump campaign has selectively promoted favorable polls, while ignoring polls that show a lead for Harris.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/karl-rove-suspicious-trumps-claims-about-poll-boosts-1955415","image":"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2473833/donald-trump.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-17 23:08:59","author":"Aila Slisco","authors":["Aila Slisco"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.402},{"id":256648850,"title":"Elon Musk Threatens To Sue FAA For “Regulatory Overreach” After SpaceX Fines","text":"Share to Facebook Share to Twitter Share to Linkedin SpaceX CEO Elon Musk. Getty Images On Tuesday, the Federal Aviation Administration levied proposed fines of hundreds of millions of dollars against SpaceX for violations related to rocket launches last year. Soon after, Elon Musk, the billionaire CEO of the commercial rocket and satellite company, threatened legal action to fight the citations. “SpaceX will be filing suit against the FAA for regulatory overreach,” Musk wrote on X, the social platform he owns. The fines, worth more than $630,000, are related to unapproved plans used during two SpaceX rocket launches last year. The first incident, from last May at Florida’s Cape Canaveral, was over a revised communications plan, in which SpaceX added an unauthorized new launch control room and removed a readiness poll from its procedures. Two months later, SpaceX used an unapproved rocket propellant facility as its fuel supplier at a launch at the Kennedy Space Center, the FAA alleged. SpaceX didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment. “Safety drives everything we do at the FAA, including a legal responsibility for the safety oversight of companies with commercial space transportation licenses,” FAA Chief Counsel Marc Nichols said in a statement about the proposed fines. “Failure of a company to comply with the safety requirements will result in consequences.” The agency, however, didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment about Musk’s legal threat. Musk says a lot of things on X, but in this case, his threat of legal retaliation may not be an empty one. The company has sued the government multiple times in the past. In January, SpaceX filed suit against the National Labor Relations Board, after the board accused the company of illegally firing employees who sent a letter to company executives calling Musk \"a distraction and embarrassment.\" In its suit, SpaceX claimed the NLRB’s structure violated the U.S. Constitution, and sought to block the case against SpaceX. The company used a similar tactic last year, suing the government in an attempt to block a Department of Justice case that claimed SpaceX refused to hire refugees. And back in 2014, the company sued the government after the Air Force awarded a lucrative contract to a competitor, instead of granting it to the highest bidder. Musk’s FAA sparring comes during a week in which he’s also landed in hot water over his posts on X. Earlier this week, after an attempted assassination on Former President Donald Trump, Musk posted that \"no one is even trying\" to assassinate President Joe Biden or Vice President Kamala Harris, along with a thinking emoji. Musk later deleted the tweet and suggested he was joking. The White House condemned the post, calling it “irresponsible.” Musk’s vows to sue, as well as his past legal action, also underscores a potentially more complicated relationship with the government for the billionaire CEO. Trump has said that if he wins a second term, he would enlist Musk to head a “government efficiency commission.” Send me a secure tip.

The story of Amber Nicole Thurman’s death in August 2022—and its connection to the six-week abortion ban enacted in Georgia the month before she died—was first reported by ProPublica‘s Kavitha Surana. While doctors, patients, and reproductive justice advocates have long warned that abortion bans were causing profound disruptions and delays in healthcare for pregnant women, Thurman’s is the first death to come to public attention. “This young mother should be alive, raising her son, and pursuing her dream of attending nursing school,” Harris said in a statement reported by the Associated Press. “Women are bleeding out in parking lots, turned away from emergency rooms, losing their ability to ever have children again. Survivors of rape and incest are being told they cannot make decisions about what happens next to their bodies. And now women are dying.” “These are the consequences of Donald Trump’s actions,” Harris added. Later on Tuesday, during a interview moderated by the National Association of Black Journalists and WHYY public radio station in Philadelphia, Harris once again drew a link between Thurman’s death and Trump. “Over 20 states have passed what I call ‘Trump abortion bans,’ because I understand how we got here,” Harris told an audience of journalism students from historically Black colleges and universities. “The former president handpicked three members of the United States Supreme Court with the intention they would undo the protections of Roe v. Wade. They did as he intended, and in state after state, laws have been passed criminalizing health care providers.” The doctors who delayed Thurman’s care were operating under these laws, Harris pointed out. “It appears the people who should have given her health care were afraid they’d be criminalized after the Dobbs decision came down,” she said. According to ProPublica, Georgia’s ban on abortions after six weeks affected Thurman in multiple ways. When Thurman discovered she was pregnant with twin in July 2022, she was just over the gestational limit. Because the 28-year-old medical assistant could not get an abortion near where she lived, she had to drive four hours with a friend to North Carolina. Then, stuck in traffic, she missed her appointment for a surgical abortion using a technique called dilation and curettage (D&C), so the clinic instead gave her medication to end her pregnancy and sent her home. The distance meant that days later, when Thurman began experiencing a rare complication from the medication abortion—her body hadn’t expelled all the fetal tissue, putting her at risk of a dangerous infection—she couldn’t go back for a free D&C. Only when her condition deteriorated did she end up going to a hospital outside Atlanta. There, her blood pressure falling and organs failing, Thurman was diagnosed with “acute severe sepsis.” But physicians waited 20 hours to operate. The hospital and doctors did not respond to ProPublica‘s requests for comment. But the delays mirror many other stories about abortion bans leading to dangerous disruptions in pregnancy care since the Supreme Court overturned Roe. Physicians afraid of being prosecuted have raised alarms about the laws’ hard-to-interpret exceptions: How close to death does a pregnant patient have to be in order for them to perform emergency abortion? Thurman ultimately died in the operating room. A Georgia state committee tasked with reviewing maternal deaths found that the delay in providing the D&C had a “large” impact on her death, and they deemed it “preventable,” according to ProPublica. Harris’ attention to Thurman’s story is no surprise given her reputation as a forceful defender of abortion rights on the campaign trail and in her debate against Trump. But her attention to pregnancy-related deaths—which are far more common in the United States than in other high-income countries—dates back years. In the Senate, Harris focused on reducing maternal mortality for Black women like Thurman, who are 2.6 times more likely to die of pregnancy-related causes than white women, according to 2022 CDC data. In 2018, she sponsored a resolution recognizing “Black Maternal Health Week” and introduced the Maternal CARE Act to create a grant program to address racial bias in obstetrics and gynecology. As vice president, she pushed efforts to expand postpartum Medicaid coverage from 60 days to 12 months. “For years, I have worked to make sure our country treats maternal mortality as the national crisis it is,” Harris wrote in 2022, prefacing a 50-point plan to use government agencies to lower maternal deaths. “I am proud to lead our Administration’s efforts to address this issue.”","summary":"Vice President Kamala Harris has lost no time blaming former President Donald Trump for the death of a single mother in Georgia after hospital doctors, working under the constraints of an abortion ban, delayed treating her catastrophic infection.

Recently, Trump and his running mate, Ohio Sen. JD Vance, have repeatedly promoted false claims that the migrant community has abducted domestic pets and are “eating” the animals. The claims have prompted bomb threats against schools and government facilities and led to the cancellation of a local cultural festival. In her interview, Harris was asked to give her assessment of the situation. Describing the fallout of the rhetoric as a “crying shame,” Harris said a “whole community” had been “put in fear” because of the Republican ticket’s rhetoric. She noted that during her time in public office, she had learned that leaders had a responsibility to understand the impact of their speech. “When you have these positions—when you have that kind of microphone in front of you, you really ought to understand at a very deep level how much your words have meaning,” Harris said. The vice president said figures like Trump have a “profound responsibility” to understand how their statements can affect people’s lives and the public trust. She said that responsibility had even more weight “especially when you have been—and then seek to be again—president of the United States of America.” Harris also noted that Trump’s frequent claim that he supports law enforcement should also be called into question since law enforcement resources have been required to respond to threats against the Haitian community. Harris connected Trump’s attacks to “age-old” tropes that have been used against Black people. She also said Trump’s comments were part of a pattern of behavior, noting his promotion of the racist birther smear against former President Barack Obama, as well as Trump’s history of denying to rent housing to Black families and his call for the innocent teenagers in the Central Park Five to be executed. “We’ve got to say that you cannot be entrusted with standing behind the seal of the president of the United States of America, engaging in that hateful rhetoric that—as usual—is designed to divide us as a country,” she added. “I think most people in our country, regardless of their race, are starting to see through this nonsense and to say, ‘You know what? Let’s turn the page on this.’ This is exhausting, and it's harmful, and it’s hateful and grounded in some age-old stuff that we should not have the tolerance for. So let’s turn the page and chart a new way forward and say you can’t have that microphone again.” Despite statements from local law enforcement officials that the claims promoted by Trump and Vance are false, Vance defended the campaign’s rhetoric in a Sunday appearance on CNN. “If I have to create stories so that the American media actually pays attention to the suffering of the American people, then that's what I'm going to do,” he told host Dana Bash.","summary":"In an interview on Tuesday before the National Association of Black Journalists, Vice President Kamala Harris condemned Donald Trump for promoting “hateful” lies about Haitian immigrants in Springfield, Ohio.\n\n\n\nRecently, Trump and his running mate, Ohio Sen.
