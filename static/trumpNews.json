Trump and Macron embraced and shook hands several times on the steps of the French presidential palace, with Trump given a full guard of honour despite not yet being in office. “It seems like the world is going a little crazy right now and we will be talking about that,” Trump told reporters as he prepared to sit down for the talks with Macron.\n\nDespite tensions between the two men during his first term, Trump hailed his ties with the centrist French leader, saying: “We had a great relationship as everyone knows. We accomplished a lot.”\n\nMacron told Trump it was “a great honour for French people to welcome you” for the re-opening ceremony at Notre Dame, which was devastated by a blaze in 2019 during Trump’s first term. “You were president at that time and I remember the solidarity and the immediate reaction,” Macron added, speaking in English.\n\nWhen he first took office in 2017, Trump’s ties with Macron -- then also a fresh face on the world stage -- began warmly despite their obvious political differences.\n\nTheir long and muscular handshakes -- which saw each man seek to assert his superiority -- became a light-hearted focus of attention before ties cooled, then soured, following disputes about climate change, trade and defence. They were expected to discuss the wars in Ukraine and the Middle East, as well as trade.\n\nTrump earlier wrote on his Truth Social platform that the United States should “not get involved” in the situation in Syria, where fast-moving rebel forces say they have begun to encircle the capital Damascus.\n\nThe Republican’s return to power has rung alarms in Paris and many European capitals after his promises on the campaign trail to force an end to fighting in Ukraine which could see US military assistance to Kyiv withheld.\n\nZelensky joined the talks around half an hour later, hurrying up the steps of the Elysee and posing for a photo with the two other men.\n\nThe Ukrainian president, writing on social media, called the three-way meeting “good and productive”.\n\n“We all want this war to end as soon as possible and in a just way,” he added.\n\nIn his own reaction to the discussions, Macron wrote on social media: “Let us continue our joint efforts for peace and security.”\n\nZelensky’s spokesman Sergiy Nykyforov told journalists the meeting lasted approximately 35 minutes, with only the three leaders present.\n\nTrump has scoffed at the billions of dollars in US military assistance to Ukraine and has spoken of forcing a quick settlement.","url":"https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1259393-macron-trump-zelensky-discuss-crazy-world-in-paris","image":"https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/uploads/akhbar/2024-12-08/l_1259393_042034_updates.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-12-08 00:52:47","author":null,"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"pk","sentiment":-0.018},{"id":271354046,"title":"Former officials urge closed-door Senate hearings on Tulsi Gabbard, Trump’s pick for intel chief","text":"By Ellen Knickmeyer | Associated Press\n\nWASHINGTON — Nearly 100 former senior U.S. diplomats and intelligence and national security officials have urged Senate leaders to schedule closed-door hearings to allow for a full review of the government’s files on former Rep. Tulsi Gabbard, Donald Trump’s pick to be national intelligence director.\n\nThe former officials, who served in both Democratic and Republican administrations, said they were “alarmed” by the choice of Gabbard to oversee all 18 U.S. intelligence agencies. They said her past actions “call into question her ability to deliver unbiased intelligence briefings to the President, Congress, and to the entire national security apparatus.”\n\nA spokesperson for Gabbard on the Trump transition team on Thursday denounced the appeal as an “unfounded” and “partisan” attack.\n\nAvril Haines, the current director of national intelligence, when asked Thursday whether intelligence sharing with allies could be in jeopardy under the next administration, cited the importance of those relationships and noted the strong bipartisan support for them in Congress.\n\nThe question, at a Council on Foreign Relations talk, focused on the especially close intelligence sharing among the Five Eyes — the U.S., Britain, Canada, Australia and New Zealand. It did not mention Gabbard by name.\n\n“It is hard for me to believe that anybody coming in wouldn’t want to maintain those relationships,” Haines said. “So I wouldn’t think of them as being in significant risk,” she added. “I certainly hope that will continue.”\n\nAmong those who signed the letter to Senate leaders were former Deputy Secretary of State Wendy Sherman, former NATO Deputy Secretary General Rose Gottemoeller, former national security adviser Anthony Lake, and numerous retired ambassadors and high-ranking military officers.\n\nThey wrote to current Democratic Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer and incoming Republican Majority Leader John Thune on Wednesday to urge the closed briefings as part of the Senate’s review of Trump’s top appointments.\n\nThey requested that Senate committees “consider in closed sessions all information available to the U.S. government when considering Ms. Gabbard’s qualifications to manage our country’s intelligence agencies, and more importantly, the protection of our intelligence sources and methods.”\n\nThe letter singles out Gabbard’s 2017 meetings in Syria with President Bashar Assad, who is supported by Russian, Iranian and Iranian-allied forces in a now 13-year war against Syrian opposition forces seeking his overthrow.\n\nThe U.S., which cut relations with Assad’s government and imposed sanctions over his conduct of the war, maintains about 900 troops in opposition-controlled northeast Syria, saying they are needed to block a resurgence of extremist groups.\n\nGabbard, a Democratic member of Congress from Hawaii at the time of her Syria trip, drew heavy criticism for her meetings with a U.S. adversary and brutal leader.\n\nAs the letter notes, her statements on the wars in the Middle East and Ukraine have aligned with Russian talking points, diverging from U.S. positions and policy.\n\nGabbard throughout her political career has urged the U.S. to limit military engagement abroad other than combatting Islamic extremist groups. She has defended the Syria trip by saying it is necessary to engage with U.S. enemies.\n\nIn postings on social media earlier this year she confirmed that the U.S. had for a time placed her “on a secret terror watch list” as a “potential domestic terror threat.” She blamed political retaliation. Neither she nor U.S. authorities have publicly detailed the circumstances involved.\n\nAlexa Henning, a spokesperson for Gabbard with the Trump team, called the letter sent to the Senate leaders “a perfect example” of why Trump chose Gabbard for this position.\n\n“These unfounded attacks are from the same geniuses who have blood on their hands from decades of faulty ‘intelligence,’” and use classified government information as a “partisan weapon to smear and imply things about their political enemy,” Henning said.\n\nA spokesperson for Thune did not immediately respond to questions about the request.\n\nAssociated Press writer Didi Tang contributed.","summary":"The former officials, who served in both Democratic and Republican administrations, said they were “alarmed” by the choice of Gabbard to oversee all 18 U.S. intelligence agencies.","url":"https://www.mercurynews.com/2024/12/07/former-officials-urge-closed-door-senate-hearings-on-tulsi-gabbard-trumps-pick-for-intel-chief/","image":"https://www.mercurynews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Trump_Gabbard_97341.jpg?w=1024&h=682","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-12-08 00:51:18","author":"Associated Press","authors":["Associated Press"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.106},{"id":271351876,"title":"Russia-West escalation: Dangerous game, unpredictable results","text":"Russian-Western escalation: Dangerous game, unpredictable resultsOkaz, Saudi Arabia, November 28For more stories from The Media Line go to themedialine.org Since the election of former US President Donald Trump, the world has experienced significant geopolitical shifts, with each party striving to establish new realities on the ground as leverage in ongoing conflicts. Nowhere is this more evident than in Ukraine, where tensions between Russia and the West have turned the country into a stage for political and military posturing. The involved factions are taking provocative actions, reflecting their desire to alter the balance of power and create conditions favorable for future negotiations. The Russian side perceives the period leading up to January 20, when the new Trump administration officially assumes power, as a strategic window to secure military advantages that may underpin any forthcoming agreement. Russian President Vladimir Putin has not disguised this approach, openly affirming it during a phone call with the German chancellor – the first such communication in over two years. This posture was underscored by a fierce assault launched by Russian forces on eastern Ukraine, amid Western accusations of Moscow bolstering its positions with North Korean troops, particularly in the Kursk region, controlled by Ukrainian forces. The Kursk region holds strategic importance in this conflict; Russian dominance there would weaken the Ukrainian position, depriving it of crucial negotiating leverage.Western powers, acutely aware of the significance of this point, quickly moved to supply Ukraine with advanced weaponry. The US announced its support for targeting deep within Russia, further complicating the situation and heightening tensions. This Western escalation is part of broader efforts to curtail Russian influence in the region and prevent Moscow from achieving a long-term victory.

(credit: Sputnik/Alexander Kazakov/Pool via REUTERS)In response, Russia’s reaction was predictable yet perilous, as Moscow threatened to resort to nuclear weapons if faced with defeat. Additionally, Russia showcased its hypersonic missile, the Oreshnik, which poses a formidable challenge to Western defense systems. These military displays serve as stark warnings aimed at deterring further Western escalation. Europe, not remaining passive, with France and Britain adopting a similar stance to the US, authorized the use of home-produced weapons to target Russia’s interior, further aggravating the crisis and complicating the geopolitical landscape. The American decision to permit strikes deep inside Russia was more than a tactical maneuver; it carried explicit strategic implications. This decision was met with approval in European circles, as it could complicate the Trump administration’s potential attempts to negotiate a settlement with Russia, thwarting a Russian triumph that might prove costly for Europe. Consequently, this development has infused the situation with additional tension, escalating political and military complexities among the disputing parties.The prospect of this conflict escalating into a full-scale confrontation increasingly alarms international observers, particularly given the substantial military capabilities of both sides. With each escalation, the profound mistrust between the parties becomes more apparent.This conflict transcends a mere struggle for regional influence; it is, at its core, a global standoff between two competing political ideologies. The ongoing escalation prompts grave concerns about the future of international peace and security, raising questions about the potential for a return to the negotiating table amid such a volatile atmosphere. Military maneuvers and incendiary rhetoric from both sides suggest a situation spiraling toward uncontrollable escalation. Stay updated with the latest news!

The world cannot afford to slip further into a large-scale conflict that could unleash unimaginable disasters upon humanity. If this aggressive trajectory persists, its consequences might reach beyond Ukraine and Russia to impact the entire global community.Thus, there is an urgent need for vigorous diplomatic initiatives and for wise voices to de-escalate tensions and avert further violence. International actors must recognize their responsibilities and work earnestly to prevent this conflict from escalating into a global catastrophe, considering its potentially catastrophic effects on all. – Rami Al-Khalifa Al-AliSexual violence in Sudan’s civil warAsharq Al-Awsat, London, November 24 Tom Fletcher, the UN undersecretary-general for humanitarian affairs, recently addressed a group of women at a school event in Port Sudan, commemorating the International Day for the Elimination of Violence against Women on November 25. “I feel ashamed that we could not protect you, and I feel ashamed for men like me for what they did,” Fletcher confessed.His comments shed light on the ongoing war in Sudan and the systematic epidemic of sexual violence faced by women, which he unequivocally condemned while warning about the potential escalation of such attacks.Fletcher was not the sole UN official to raise alarm over this disturbing phenomenon. Pramila Patten, special representative of the UN secretary-general on sexual violence in conflict, had already issued a poignant statement titled “A war waged on the bodies of women and girls.” In it, she chronicled testimonies from Sudanese refugee camps along the Chadian border, revealing harrowing accounts of rape, ethnic-targeted sexual violence, and the trafficking of women for sexual exploitation. Many victims recounted being subjected to rape as a tool for humiliation and subjugation, often in the presence of their family members.The UN Human Rights Council’s Fact-Finding Mission on Sudan painted a grim picture of the sexual violence, describing it as “horrific.” Their report, published at the end of last month, highlighted how attacks affected women and girls of all ages, with even children not spared. The document also revealed evidence of women and girls being abducted for sexual slavery, a claim corroborated by numerous reports since the war began. In these narratives and reports, the Rapid Support Forces (RSF) emerged as the primary culprits of such egregious acts, as documented by international human rights organizations, Sudanese civil groups, and the UN itself.Last October a UN report, grounded in thorough investigations, confirmed that the RSF was responsible for most of the sexual assaults. The horror stories from displaced individuals who fled RSF-occupied territories are chilling. Some recount women being gang-raped in front of their families, while others regretfully drowned attempting desperate escapes. Many families went to the lengths of equipping their daughters with knives for self-defense or, tragically, self-harm to prevent rape by armed men. There were also instances of girls resorting to suicide after being violated.The repercussions of these crimes extend deep into psychological and societal realms, demanding immediate attention and a long-term commitment to victims’ recovery. It is imperative to allocate resources to support centers offering medical and psychological care and to enhance community awareness to eradicate social stigma. Such efforts are vital to prevent survivors from suffering in isolation and facing harsh treatment fueled by misplaced shame. Sudanese organizations play a crucial role here, persistently working under challenging conditions since the war’s outbreak to document cases and provide holistic support to victims.The state bears significant responsibility and should draw insights from other nations that have combated similar crimes. Engaging both local and international expertise can aid in establishing judicial bodies with special powers, employing international laws that categorize sexual violence as a war crime and a crime against humanity, with parallels to genocide based on race, sex, or gender.For instance, Rwanda addressed sexual violence cases under its genocide laws as part of its post-conflict measures. The fundamental principle of accountability necessitates integrating sexual violence issues and the pursuit of justice for perpetrators into comprehensive solutions, even post-conflict. These crimes are indefensible, and securing justice for victims demands resolute deterrence to send a clear message to all potential violators.Equally important is the inclusion of women in peace-building and conflict resolution processes. Women and children frequently bear the brunt of wartime atrocities, and their involvement offers a distinctive and empathetic perspective on tackling the complex issue of sexual violence. – Osman MirghaniArab action against regional chaosAl-Masry Al-Youm, Egypt, November 24The Middle East is undergoing a dramatic transformation in terms of geography, politics, economics, society, and national security. These comprehensive strategic changes should urge Arab countries to engage and cooperate more effectively, both individually and regionally, as well as together as a cohesive Arab alliance. The current political apathy mirrors a scenario in which a cancerous growth is allowed to spread unchecked, infiltrating the Arab world without any countermeasures.On an optimistic note, the demographic landscape of the Arab world, characterized by a significant youth population, offers a glimmer of hope for the future. A young populace presents the opportunity to build a forward-thinking national identity – grounded in accountability and transparency – essential for effective governance.However, the picture is not wholly positive. Territorial disputes are prevalent across the region, particularly between Arab and non-Arab states vying for sovereignty or imposing their jurisdictions. Political tensions are mounting within and across these borders, while economic and resource challenges attract diverse actors from both inside and outside the region.Moreover, the areas of energy, maritime access, and security face significant hurdles. Countless state and non-state entities are forcing their ideologies on others, reassessing policies and practices in pursuit of regional geopolitical ambitions through national security measures. The increasingly common resorting to force to resolve disputes is perhaps the most alarming trend, and this has been greeted with a tepid response regionally and internationally, suggesting a tacit acceptance as long as such practices remain confined to the region.It’s time for decisive action. Despite the stark global divisions, UN Secretary-General António Guterres convened a “Summit for the Future” in New York this fall, aiming to reinvigorate multilateralism and collective responsibility in the 21st century. Within this framework, Arab countries must take decisive measures and make deterrent political decisions concerning their aggressive neighbors. They should adopt a proactive geopolitical vision for the Middle East’s future, establishing the necessary conditions to cultivate constructive and advantageous relations between Arab and non-Arab nations. Some might contend that the region cannot withstand further military conflict. Regardless of the veracity of this claim, it misses the point of the discussion. This is not a call for war; rather, it is a call for potent political action with tangible repercussions. Turning a blind eye to injustice and violence will inevitably escalate conflict and war at our doorstep. Others may argue that the Arab world is too unstable to instigate regional transformation, adhering to the saying, “better the devil you know.” This perspective fails to acknowledge the ongoing regional changes, often occurring to their detriment.Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s declaration that Israel was “changing the Middle East” was swiftly followed by Israeli encroachments across the Levant, in countries such as Lebanon and Syria, extending to Yemen.Frankly, I am deeply troubled by these excesses and developments that redefine the Middle East, often at the cost of Arab national interests. Moreover, I foresee no immediate resolution to the prevailing escalation and humanitarian failures. We stand at a pivotal junction, and the forthcoming developments are likely to worsen. This is certainly not a moment for complacency or indifference.Given the blatant violation of international law presented by current actions, Arab UN member states, in conjunction with former members of the Non-Aligned Movement and several Security Council members, must rapidly draft a resolution urging the cessation of Israel’s cross-border operations and enforce a cease-fire, regardless of any dissent from permanent council members.The recommended measures consist of a few things. First, Arab countries should embrace a gradual approach to reform in order to meet the aspirations of their youth. Building solid foundations and robust national security capabilities will shield these nations and their young populations from recurring shocks and disillusionment, exacerbated by increasing injustice and inequality.Second, Arab countries must recalibrate, diversify, and balance their regional and international relations to reduce reliance on any single power. They should then bolster their political and security strengths to forge more balanced and stable regional alliances with their neighbors, fostering mutual benefit. This should be the basis for enhancing Arab nations’ credibility and political leverage. Otherwise, their regional proposals will be disregarded by adversaries and ignored domestically.Third, Arab countries need to proactively craft future-oriented visions for a more equitable and advantageous security framework for the region, preempting efforts by others to reshape and reallocate alliances for their own interests. The most effective path to this goal is to establish a regional framework document featuring two tracks, initially proposed by Arab nations and discussed internally, before being presented to non-Arab regional parties.The first track of this document should reaffirm the UN Charter and emphasize the principles of good neighborly relations among states and principles particularly significant to the region, such as the inadmissibility of acquiring territory through force. The second track should create a regional consultative structure for national security that prioritizes conflict resolution via diplomacy, crisis management, regional threat reduction, and disarmament. Participants respecting and adhering to these proposed principles will be invited to join the more consultative second track.The events currently unfolding in the Middle East and beyond are challenging. Many question whether now is the appropriate time for a forward-thinking regional initiative. I ponder this frequently, always concluding that the staggering costs of inaction – especially for the vulnerable or passive – demand action and positive steps, before it is too late. – Nabil FahmyGaza deal following Lebanon agreement?Al-Ittihad, UAE, November 30The lingering question following the Hezbollah-Israel agreement is whether it will extend its influence to the Gaza Strip. This raises considerations about the political dynamics between Israel and both the Lebanese and Gaza fronts. Prime Minister Netanyahu has used this agreement as a strategy to alleviate domestic pressure and revitalize the Israeli armed forces. However, he faces significant challenges from right-wing opposition, which perceives the agreement as a perilous concession.Netanyahu acknowledges that the ongoing conflict strains the military resources and sends a clear message to the domestic audience that the Israeli army has fulfilled its objectives. The primary aim was to push Hezbollah away from the area south of the Litani River and to cripple its capabilities by dismantling the infrastructure in the southern villages. This would neutralize any threats like those faced on Oct. 7.Through the agreement, Israel has not only achieved this but has also secured a strategic advantage by targeting senior Hezbollah leaders, making the decision to agree preferable to a protracted war, which would expose the home front to ongoing assaults. Hezbollah, on the other side, sees any ceasefire agreement as a way to cement its political and operational gains, ensuring its continued role as a military resistance force in the region.Israel sought an agreement allowing it leeway to respond to future threats, aware that past agreements between these parties have been tenuous. For instance, UN Resolution 1701, which ended the 2006 war, failed to prevent subsequent flare-ups. Without robust international assurances, any new accord could quickly unravel. The recurring confrontations underscore the erosion of mutual deterrence; Israel has not been able to dismantle Hezbollah, and Hezbollah has not achieved significant strategic success.Israel’s goal is to fortify its security by adhering to Security Council resolutions. Netanyahu aimed to capitalize on military achievements secured during the conflict, knowing that prolonged warfare could diminish Israel’s political and military standing. The continuation of hostilities might even provoke Hezbollah to expand its targets deeper into Israeli territory, perpetuating displacement among settlers. Nevertheless, the durability of the ceasefire between Israel and Lebanon hinges on fulfilling critical conditions, especially the disbanding of armed groups as outlined in the agreement – with Hezbollah at the forefront – and establishing comprehensive Lebanese state control.This remains challenging, given Lebanon’s limited military capacity to monitor borders and prevent arms flow from Syria. The primary hurdle is not the agreement’s sustainability but Hezbollah’s potential rearmament, despite its commitment. While Hezbollah may temporarily refrain from deploying arms south of the Litani River, it can augment its arsenal north of the river, launching strikes from any location in Lebanon. This is exacerbated by the lack of oversight on the Lebanese-Syrian border. Internally, Hezbollah grapples with numerous challenges, notably from voices within Lebanon blaming the organization for the devastation and damaged infrastructure due to the war.Amid this backdrop, increased American pressure has been a significant factor, with Parliament Speaker Nabih Berri negotiating with the US on Hezbollah’s behalf. Hezbollah faces mounting pressure to accept the ceasefire initiative, motivated by Lebanon’s losses, which reportedly exceed $5 billion, all while grappling with a preexisting severe economic crisis.Concerning the Gaza Strip, any ongoing or forthcoming endeavors regarding a ceasefire after the Hezbollah-Israel agreement necessitate restructuring approaches concerning prisoner and detainee exchanges. The objective is to reach a consensus among all stakeholders on broad strategies that align with US President-elect Trump’s vision for ending hostilities in the Strip. This requires mediators to engage directly with the Israeli government, especially as Hamas is ready to negotiate a ceasefire and exchange of prisoners.The prevailing conditions are ripe to pressure Netanyahu into accepting such deals, mirroring public opinion in Israel, which favors a similar resolution to the one achieved with Hezbollah. Public opinion surveys depict a divide between supporters and opponents of continuing the conflict in Gaza. Meanwhile, the Israeli government is engaging with President-elect Trump’s administration, in line with his call for a ceasefire on the Lebanon-Gaza fronts and minimizing regional conflicts. – Tarek FahmyTranslated by Asaf Zilberfarb.

Israeli Diaspora Affairs Minister MK Amichai Chikli led the discussions, emphasizing the dangerous overlap between anti-Zionism and antisemitism.Speaking alongside influential figures such as former Canadian prime minister Stephen Harper and Australian ex-leaders Scott Morrison and Tony Abbott, Chikli stressed the need for a unified approach to combat these intertwined phenomena. \"Adopting the IHRA definition directly addresses the dehumanization and double standards often applied to Israel,\" Chikli remarked. He praised the resolution as a significant step in countering antisemitism, particularly in North American and European universities, where hostility has grown markedly.A significant decision by the @idualliance executive meeting in Washington to: 1. Adopt the IHRA Definition to Combat Antisemitism.2. Call for the Replacement of UNRWA. 3. Strongly condemn the ICC Decision against Israel.4.

Delegates urged the replacement of the organization with one that meets the approval of all relevant parties. The resolution also criticized Iran’s destabilizing role in the region, highlighting its support for terror groups.Additionally, participants strongly condemned the International Criminal Court's (ICC) decision to issue arrest warrants against Israel's Prime Minister and Defense Minister. The resolution dismissed the comparison between Israel’s democratic leaders and operatives of terror groups as baseless and rejected any attempts to limit the right of democratic states to defend themselves against terrorism. In a statement reflecting its unified stance, the IDU declared its unwavering support for Israel’s efforts against Iran and its proxies. \"The organization stands unequivocally with Israel in its just war against extremism and totalitarianism in the Middle East,\" the resolution stated.Chikli: \"Critical decisions for Israel\"Chikli, a member of the Likud Party, praised the summit’s resolutions as vital for Israel’s global standing. \"These three resolutions—adopting the IHRA definition, condemning the ICC's baseless comparisons, and advocating for UNRWA's replacement—are critical steps toward justice and fairness for Israel,\" he said.The summit, organized by the International Democrat Union (IDU) and chaired by Harper, brought together representatives from over 110 countries, including prominent figures from Europe, Latin America, and the United States. Participants included the European People's Party (EPP) leaders Manfred Weber and David McAllister, as well as members of the incoming administration of US President Donald Trump, including National Security Advisor-designate Mike Waltz.

Scientists, engineers, doctors, and businessmen made the world richer, healthier, and more long-lived than previously imaginable.” From the 1970s on, Thiel and others have observed, that vanguard has not been as prominent, and technological advance has slowed amid institutionalization and bureaucratization. Thiel argued that this stagnation owes, in part, to the loss of optimism’s “definite” character—the idea that only concerted human effort in pursuit of concrete plans can make the future better than the present—and its replacement with an “indefinite” variant, whereby progress, buttressed by institutions and bureaucracies, is inevitable.\n\nA little more than a decade on from Thiel’s book, however, torchbearers for the older form of optimism have reclaimed the center of gravity in America. At President-elect Donald Trump’s left and right hands stand definite optimists in the form of entrepreneur-cum-Trump evangelist Elon Musk and venture capitalist-cum-Vice President J. D. Vance. And they are but two of the most visible figures in a loose Silicon Valley cadre poised to enact the sorts of concrete plans, in the private and public sectors, that Thiel champions. As Samuel Hammond notes, Trump has paved a lane for “highly capable founders and entrepreneurs to bypass the legacy system.”\n\nThat tech should be swinging rightward politically has understandably caught many Americans by surprise. Through the 1980s, 1990s, and 2000s, tech luminaries were Baby Boomers in the mold of David Brooks’s “bobos” (bourgeois bohemians). Left-liberalism and left-libertarianism were their reigning political philosophies, as exemplified by the countercultural Steve Jobs. Their nemesis was the establishment: William H. Whyte’s “Organization Man,” who dominated corporate life in the early postwar era. While Jobs himself was undoubtedly a definite optimist of the highest order, the Boomer tech bobos created their own establishment—one so self-satisfied that it couldn’t see the negative effects of its egalitarian creed. In politics, where the Atari Democrats were once insurgents, the Clintons eventually became the avatars of stasis.\n\nFollowing Jobs’s death in 2011, the bobo era drew to a close. Musk, born 16 years after Jobs and untouched by the America of the 1960s, soon assumed tech alpha status. By then, it was no longer the postwar conformists smothering creativity with their pieties but the bobos themselves: they preached the necessity of community input, the fragility of Mother Earth, the evils of American imperialism, and the perennial guilt of white males.","url":"https://hotair.com/headlines/2024/12/07/tech-bros-in-control-n3797680","image":null,"video":null,"publish_date":"2024-12-08 00:41:49","author":null,"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.04},{"id":271350494,"title":"Insurgents reach gates of Syria’s capital, threatening to upend decades of Assad rule","text":"BEIRUT (AP) — Insurgents' stunning march across Syria accelerated Saturday with news that they had reached the gates of the capital and that government forces had abandoned the central city of Homs. The government was forced to deny rumors that President Bashar Assad had fled the country.\n\nThe loss of Homs is a potentially crippling blow for Assad. It stands at an important intersection between Damascus, the capital, and Syria’s coastal provinces of Latakia and Tartus — the Syrian leader’s base of support and home to a Russian strategic naval base.\n\nThe pro-government Sham FM news outlet reported that government forces took positions outside Syria’s third-largest city, without elaborating. Rami Abdurrahman who heads the Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, said Syrian troops and members of different security agencies have withdrawn from the city, adding that rebels have entered parts of it.\n\nThe insurgency announced later Saturday that it had taken over Homs. The city's capture is a major victory for the rebels, who have already seized the cities of Aleppo and Hama, as well as large parts of the south, in a lightning offensive that began Nov. 27. Analysts said rebel control of Homs would be a game-changer.\n\nThe rebels' moves around Damascus, reported by the monitor and a rebel commander, came after the Syrian army withdrew from much of southern part of the country, leaving more areas, including several provincial capitals, under the control of opposition fighters.\n\nFor the first time in the country’s long-running civil war, the government now has control of only three of 14 provincial capitals: Damascus, Latakia and Tartus.\n\nThe advances in the past week were among the largest in recent years by opposition factions, led by a group that has its origins in al-Qaida and is considered a terrorist organization by the U.S. and the United Nations. In their push to overthrow Assad's government, the insurgents, led by the Hayat Tahrir al-Sham group, or HTS, have met little resistance from the Syrian army.\n\nThe rapid rebel gains, coupled with the lack of support from Assad's erstwhile allies, posed the most serious threat to his rule since the start of the war.\n\nThe U.N.’s special envoy for Syria, Geir Pedersen, on Saturday called for urgent talks in Geneva to ensure an “orderly political transition.” Speaking to reporters at the annual Doha Forum in Qatar, he said the situation in Syria was changing by the minute. Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov, whose country is Assad's chief international backer, said he feels “sorry for the Syrian people.”\n\nIn Damascus, people rushed to stock up on supplies. Thousands went to Syria's border with Lebanon, trying to leave the country.\n\nMany shops in the capital were shuttered, a resident told The Associated Press, and those still open ran out of staples such as sugar. Some were selling items at three times the normal price.\n\n“The situation is very strange. We are not used to that,” the resident said, insisting on anonymity, fearing retributions.\n\n“People are worried whether there will be a battle (in Damascus) or not.”\n\nIt was the first time that opposition forces reached the outskirts of Damascus since 2018, when Syrian troops recaptured the area following a yearslong siege. The U.N. said it was moving noncritical staff outside the country as a precaution.\n\nAssad's status\n\nSyria’s state media denied social media rumors that Assad left the country, saying he is performing his duties in Damascus.\n\nHe has had little, if any, help from his allies. Russia, is busy with its war in Ukraine. Lebanon’s Hezbollah, which at one point sent thousands of fighters to shore up Assad's forces, has been weakened by a yearlong conflict with Israel. Iran has seen its proxies across the region degraded by regular Israeli airstrikes.\n\nU.S. President-elect Donald Trump on Saturday posted on social media that that the United States should avoid engaging militarily in Syria.\n\nPedersen said a date for talks in Geneva on the implementation a U.N. resolution, adopted in 2015, and calling for a Syrian-led political process, would be announced later. The resolution calls for the establishment of a transitional governing body, followed by the drafting of a new constitution and ending with U.N.-supervised elections.\n\nLater Saturday, foreign ministers and senior diplomats from eight key countries, including Saudi Arabia, Russia, Egypt, Turkey and Iran, along with Pederson, gathered on the sidelines of the Doha Summit to discuss the situation in Syria.\n\nIn a statement issued late Saturday, the participants affirmed their support for a political solution to the Syrian crisis “that would lead to the end of military activity and protect civilians.” They also agreed on the importance of strengthening international efforts to increase aid to the Syrian people.\n\nThe insurgents' march \n\nRami Abdurrahman, who heads the Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, an opposition war monitor, said insurgents were in the Damascus suburbs of Maadamiyah, Jaramana and Daraya. Opposition fighters were marching toward the Damascus suburb of Harasta, he added.\n\nA commander with the insurgents, Hassan Abdul-Ghani, posted on the Telegram messaging app that opposition forces had begun the “final stage” of their offensive by encircling Damascus. \n\nHTS controls much of northwest Syria and in 2017 set up a “salvation government” to run day-to-day affairs in the region. In recent years, HTS leader Abu Mohammed al-Golani has sought to remake the group’s image, cutting ties with al-Qaida, ditching hard-line officials and vowing to embrace pluralism and religious tolerance.\n\nThe shock offensive began Nov. 27, during which gunmen captured the northern city of Aleppo, Syria’s largest, and the central city of Hama, the country’s fourth largest city. \n\nOpposition activists said Saturday that a day earlier, insurgents entered Palmyra, which is home to invaluable archaeological sites had been in government hands since being taken from the Islamic State group in 2017. \n\nTo the south, Syrian troops left much of the province of Quneitra including the main Baath City, activists said.\n\nSyrian Observatory said government troops have withdrawn from much of the two southern provinces.\n\nThe Syrian army said in a statement that it carried out redeployment and repositioning in Sweida and Daraa after its checkpoints came under attack by “terrorists.\" The army said it was setting up a “strong and coherent defensive and security belt in the area,” apparently to defend Damascus from the south.\n\nThe Syrian government has referred to opposition gunmen as terrorists since conflict broke out in March 2011.\n\nDiplomacy in Doha\n\nThe foreign ministers of Iran, Russia and Turkey, meeting in Qatar, called for an end to the hostilities. Turkey is a main backer of the rebels. \n\nQatar's top diplomat, Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani, criticized Assad for failing to take advantage of the lull in fighting in recent years to address the country’s underlying problems. “Assad didn’t seize this opportunity to start engaging and restoring his relationship with his people,” he said.\n\nSheikh Mohammed said he was surprised by how quickly the rebels have advanced and said there is a real threat to Syria’s “territorial integrity.” He said the war could “damage and destroy what is left if there is no sense of urgency” to start a political process.\n\nKaram reported from London.

(AP) — The United States will provide nearly $1 billion more in longer-term weapons support to Ukraine, Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said Saturday as the Biden administration rushes to spend all the congressionally approved money it has left to bolster Kyiv before President-elect Donald Trump takes office next month. \n\nThe latest package will include more drones and munitions for the High Mobility Artillery Rocket Systems, or HIMARS, that the U.S. has provided. While these weapons are critically needed now, they will be funded through the Ukraine Security Assistance Initiative, which pays for longer-term systems to be put on contract. \n\nThe weapon systems purchased are often intended to support Ukraine's future military capabilities, not make an immediate difference on the battlefield. \n\nThe nearly $1 billion package is on top of an additional $725 million in U.S. military assistance, including counter-drone systems and HIMARS munitions, announced Monday that would be drawn from the Pentagon’s stockpiles to more quickly get to the front lines. The U.S. has provided Ukraine with more than $62 billion in military aid since Russia’s invasion in February 2022.\n\nUkraine is facing an intensified onslaught by Russia, which is now using thousands of North Korean troops to augment its fight to take back the Kursk region. Moscow also has launched an intermediate-range ballistic missile and regularly strikes Kyiv's civilian infrastructure. \n\nWith questions about whether Trump will maintain military support to Ukraine, the Biden administration has been trying to spend every dollar remaining from a massive foreign aid bill passed earlier this year to put Ukraine in the strongest position possible.\n\n“This administration has made its choice. So has a bipartisan coalition in Congress. The next administration must make its own choice,” Austin said at an annual gathering of national security officials, defense firms and lawmakers at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library in Simi Valley, California. \n\nTrump had a hastily arranged meeting Saturday with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and France's Emmanuel Macron while in Paris for the reopening of Notre Dame Cathedral. Macron and other European leaders are trying to persuade Trump to maintain support for Ukraine.\n\nTrump, a longtime admirer of Russian President Vladimir Putin, has criticized U.S. aid for Ukraine and called for bringing a quick end to the war, raising concerns in Ukraine about what terms may be laid out for any future negotiations.\n\nAustin said he was “confident that President Reagan would have stood on the side of Ukraine, American security and human freedom.”\n\nIt was one of Austin’s last major speeches as President Joe Biden’s defense secretary and a cap to his more than 41 years serving as a soldier and general.\n\nUnder Austin’s watch, the Pentagon in 2022 launched a regular meeting that now counts more than 50 countries to figure out how to get the tens of millions of rounds of ammunition and billions of dollars in advanced weaponry to Ukraine. Without that flow of support, it's possible the country would have fallen to Russia after it invaded.\n\n“Together, we have helped Ukraine survive an all-out assault by the largest military in Europe,” Austin said.\n\nAustin and Kentucky Sen. Mitch McConnell, the longtime Republican leader, were honored at the conference for their lifetime of service, and they used the opportunity to press for the U.S. to continue to build and support its alliances, a sharp contrast to Trump’s “America First “ policy. \n\nAustin called the Ukraine Defense Contact Group “the most consequential global coalition since the time of President George H.W. Bush and Iraq’s 1990 invasion of Kuwait,” showing that \"America and our friends have become the arsenal of Ukrainian democracy.”\n\nBefore Saturday's announcement, there was roughly $8 billion left to use to pull existing weapons out of U.S. stockpiles and to put additional weapons on contract to help Ukraine.\n\n“We're not going to stop Putin by telling Ukraine we aren't going to give you anything more,” Rep. Adam Smith of Washington state, the top Democrat on the House Armed Services Committee, said at a panel at the Reagan National Defense Forum.\n\nTara Copp, The Associated Press","url":"https://www.oakvillenews.org/world-news/us-announces-nearly-1-billion-more-in-longer-term-weapons-support-for-ukraine-9923018","image":"https://www.vmcdn.ca/f/files/shared/feeds/cp/2024/12/e7cd251a6a75f627ac9d64ecc4f9fab9f6d13fbc0ba610e053f544747952c87a.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-12-08 00:39:48","author":"Tara Copp","authors":["Tara Copp"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"ca","sentiment":0.118},{"id":271350488,"title":"US announces nearly $1 billion more in longer-term weapons support for Ukraine","text":"SIMI VALLEY, Calif.

Macron and other European leaders are trying to persuade Trump to maintain support for Ukraine.\n\nTrump, a longtime admirer of Russian President Vladimir Putin, has criticized U.S. aid for Ukraine and called for bringing a quick end to the war, raising concerns in Ukraine about what terms may be laid out for any future negotiations.\n\nAustin said he was “confident that President Reagan would have stood on the side of Ukraine, American security and human freedom.”\n\nIt was one of Austin’s last major speeches as President Joe Biden’s defense secretary and a cap to his more than 41 years serving as a soldier and general.\n\nUnder Austin’s watch, the Pentagon in 2022 launched a regular meeting that now counts more than 50 countries to figure out how to get the tens of millions of rounds of ammunition and billions of dollars in advanced weaponry to Ukraine. Without that flow of support, it's possible the country would have fallen to Russia after it invaded in February 2022.\n\n“Together, we have helped Ukraine survive an all-out assault by the largest military in Europe,” Austin said.\n\nBefore Saturday's announcement, there was roughly $8 billion left to use to pull existing weapons out of U.S. stockpiles and to put additional weapons on contract to help Ukraine.\n\n“We're not going to stop Putin by telling Ukraine we aren't going to give you anything more,” Rep. Adam Smith of Washington state, the top Democrat on the House Armed Services Committee, said at a panel at the Reagan National Defense Forum.\n\nTara Copp, The Associated Press","url":"https://www.oakvillenews.org/world-news/us-announces-nearly-1-billion-more-in-longer-term-weapons-support-for-ukraine-9923019","image":"https://www.vmcdn.ca/f/files/shared/feeds/cp/2024/12/48f46bb8095e34aa50f7a777865be71c5312bb027ec028ff76e08192e27586a0.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-12-08 00:39:48","author":"Tara Copp","authors":["Tara Copp"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"ca","sentiment":0.029},{"id":271349990,"title":"Melania Trump: Barron Brought Success To The Campaign, He Knew Who His Father Needed To Talk To","text":"Back to Videos\n\n Melania Trump: Barron Brought Success To The Campaign, He Knew Who His Father Needed To Talk To\n\n | \n\n Posted By Ian Schwartz\n On Date December 7, 2024\n \n\n \n \n Melania Trump: Barron Brought Success To The Campaign, He Knew Who His Father Needed To Talk To0 seconds of 3 minutes, 19 secondsVolume 90%Press shift question mark to access a list of keyboard shortcutsKeyboard ShortcutsShortcuts Open/Close/ or ?Play/PauseSPACEIncrease Volume�Decrease Volume�Seek Forward�Seek Backward�Captions On/OffcFullscreen/Exit FullscreenfMute/UnmutemDecrease Caption Size-Increase Caption Size+ or =Seek %0-9\n\n Next UpMary Katharine Ham on Hegseth: Media's Use Of Unnamed Sources, Going After His Bronze Medal Is Weak Sauce00:42http://www.realclearpolitics.com/video/2024/12/07/melania_trump_barron_brought_success_to_the_campaign_he_knew_who_his_father_needed_to_talk_to.htmlCopied\n\n Live00:0003:1903:19More Videos00:42Mary Katharine Ham on Hegseth: Media's Use Of Unnamed Sources, Going After His Bronze Medal Is Weak Sauce02:41Byron York: Trump Was Shot In July And We Still Do Not Know A Lot About The Would-Be Assassin And His Motives00:51Dem Rep.

Because nowadays, the young generation they don't sit in front of TV anymore. They are all on the tablets. They're on the phones and all of these podcasts and streamers, he was very vocal and he gave an advice to his father and was incredible how he brought in a success because he knew exactly who his father needs to contact and to talk to.\n\nDOOCY: Isn't it shocking how fast he went from that little boy to big man?\n\nTRUMP: Yes, it is.\n\nEARHARDT: What advice do you have for other moms that are -- because I'll go back and I'll look at videos --\n\nTRUMP: Yes.\n\nEARHARDT: -- of my daughter when she was that age and there's -- there's like a pain in my heart because I missed those years. When you -- what's your advice for all of us that your son's in college now, you've seen him grow up, how do you handle each stage?\n\nTRUMP: I think you need to be present and to be with them as much as you can, to be there as -- as a teacher and a guide and give them guidance. I think it's the most important. Because years goes by so fast. We -- we just don't imagine it's like you -- I see the clip that you just showed I feel like it was like a few months ago.\n\nKILMEADE: Right.\n\nTRUMP: But time goes so fast.\n\nKILMEADE: But here's your challenge that we don't have nobody watching us, he's trying to adapt to college as a freshman always tough, he's got Secret Service everywhere in New York City where even not being six nine and famous you could be targeted for a random crime, how has he managed to navigate him? What advice do you give him to try to be -- is it possible for him to be a normal student?\n\nTRUMP: I don't think it's possible for him to be a normal student, his experience at college, it's very different than any other kid. And I'm very proud how he's handling. He's very strong. And he knows that he's in different position than other children. And I -- you know, I just say make your dreams come true. This is your road. This is your life and make sure that you listen yourself and your likes and dislikes.\n\nKILMEADE: Right. You want to go over my tower for lunch, you don't really hear that from other people. But he does -- but evidently he likes it, right, the Stern School?\n\nTRUMP: Yes, he does.

It's the middle of a presidential campaign. He was the candidate for president, didn't want to be viewed as interfering. He's no longer the candidate. His vice president is the presidential nominee.\n\nI am almost, 99 percent certain, that President Biden was hoping that Vice President Harris would win and that this would not be an issue. But when the person who won the race won the race by vowing a campaign \u0014 through a campaign of retribution, revenge, naming the Biden family in general and Hunter Biden, in particular, as someone or people, groups of people, he wanted to go after if he won election, of course, the president looks at the facts, says, that I cannot allow that to happen to my son.\n\nAnd for the \u0014 and I understand the criticisms and the brickbats that the president is taking. But for some Democrats to be complaining about how you have ruined norms and you have given him an avenue, have they not been paying attention to who Donald Trump is either during the campaign or during his four years as president the first go-round?\n\nAnd these are the same people who would be yelling at Biden had he not done something and then-President Trump took action against Hunter Biden, why didn't you save your son?

Did the intervening events, the reelection of Donald Trump, the fact that Hunter Biden would have been at the mercy of a Trump Justice Department, and that Donald Trump was very clear about seeking revenge against his perceived enemies, the Bidens chief among them, does any of that change the calculus in your opinion?\n\nBROOKS: Not to me.\n\nHunter Biden has already been convicted. He was about to get sentenced. This is not going to be a Trump thing. That was already happening. I think what happened for Joe Biden, it became less politically painful to do it. So he did it.\n\nI have learned that Democrats have been running against corruption, against nepotism, against all the bad things Donald Trump has done. And to run against those things, you have to have a place to stand. I have to have a place to stand on legitimacy.\n\nAnd I do care about norms. I think our society, our democracy, the Constitution is built on laws. But within the way the government functions, there are norms of behavior upon which our democracy depends. And one of those norms is that we have a pardon. The president gets presidential pardon power, but he cannot abuse it by just taking his family out of the picture.\n\nIn my view, he cannot abuse it by giving pre-pardons to people how haven't been convicted of anything. The way democracies fall is that the practices that make the democracy work get slowly abandoned step by step. And, obviously, Donald Trump is the guy abandoning those norms leap by leap. But it's important to me that we have one party that actually does defend those norms, defends legitimacy, and just doesn't go in for a freewheeling nepotism.\n\nBENNETT: There's the defense of norms. And, Jonathan, we have heard Republicans already say that this pardon proves that it's Joe Biden who has politicized the Justice Department, not Donald Trump.\n\nWhether that's accurate or not, I mean, it certainly could be politically effective, especially if Donald Trump does what he says he intends to do, and that's issue pardons for the folks who were convicted in connection to the attack on the Capitol on January 6.\n\nCAPEHART: Yes, he said he was going to do it. He said he intended to do it. He's going to do it.\n\nWhether President Biden pardoned his son or not, Trump is going to do it. No one's going to be surprised.

They’re now on the outskirts of Homs, less than 100 miles to the north.\n\nAs his remaining troops dig in, Syria’s longtime ruler is signaling his willingness to reach a deal that would allow him to hold on to the rump territory his army controls, or guarantee his safe passage into exile if needed, said the people. They spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss secret meetings.\r\n\nOne offer Assad made to the U.S. via the United Arab Emirates is for Syria to cut all involvement with Iran-backed militant groups, such as Hezbollah, if Western powers wield influence to stem the fighting, the people said.\r\n\nAnother initiative saw Assad dispatch a senior Christian leader to meet Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban to relay what he sees as an existential threat to Syria’s Christian minority if Islamist rebels prevail, according to other people familiar with the plan. The intention was that Orban, a Trump ally, would convey this danger to the incoming U.S. president, they said.\r\n\nIt’s a dramatic turn of events for a dynasty that’s ruled Syria with an iron fist for half a century, crushed peaceful protests in 2011 and clung to power through years of civil war that spurred one of the worst humanitarian crises of modern times. Iranian and Russian military support was crucial to the survival of the 59-year-old president, but both are now distracted and stretched thin by other conflicts.\r\n\n“Assad is in huge danger — it’s almost like in 2015 when the insurgents were at the gates of Damascus,” said Sergei Markov, a political consultant close to the Kremlin, referring to the year Russia intervened to save him.\r\n\nWestern nations were equally surprised, including the U.S., which had largely relinquished much of its influence in Syria to Iran, Russia and Turkey but has reacted to protect its interests, according to senior officials.\r\n\nMultiple Western officials said it was difficult to see Assad remaining in power.\r\n\nThe fall of Homs, Syria’s third-largest city, could cut the highway linking Damascus and the country’s west and Mediterranean coast — the stronghold of the Assads and loyalists from their Alawite sect.\r\n\nThe president’s whereabouts are unclear, although he’s believed to be in Damascus or his hometown of Qardaha, close to Russia’s Khmeimim air base. It’s also possible he’s in the Iranian capital, Tehran, a person familiar with U.S. policy said Saturday.\r\n\nAssad’s office issued a statement condemning “rumors and fake news,” saying the the president remains in the capital.\r\n\nAssad has ordered the bulk of Syria’s remaining army — estimated at between 30,000 to 40,000 fighters — to rush to defend Damascus, according to two people familiar with the matter. An army spokesman said in a TV address on Saturday that it was strengthening its defenses around the city and in southern Syria.\r\n\nThe main rebel offensive has been led by Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, or HTS, a former al-Qaida affiliate, and various armed groups backed by Turkey. Other fighters have joined in, including army defectors who’d fought the regime and laid down arms in previous ceasefires, said the people.\r\n\nAs rebels converge on Damascus from the north and south, Iran had drawn back its presence in Syria, leaving its military advisers concentrated around the capital, according to the people. Some Tehran-backed Iraqi militia have also returned their country after the government ceded the eastern city of Deir Ezzor to U.S.-backed Kurdish fighters, they said.\r\n\nRussian personnel now remain mainly around the capital and at the Khmeimim air base and Tartous naval base, they said.\r\n\nAfter a meeting with his Iranian and Turkish counterparts in Doha on Saturday, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said Moscow is “trying to do everything not to allow terrorists to prevail.”\r\n\n“We don’t want them to follow the fate of Iraqis, Libyans and other nations who were disturbed by the people desiring to keep their domination,” he said.\r\n\nTrump said Saturday a withdrawal from Syria might “be the best thing that can happen” to Russia and that troops shouldn’t get involved in the fighting.\r\n\nBack channels\n\nRussia has launched airstrikes around Homs to try and stall the rebel advance. But with signs the Kremlin’s help may not be enough, Assad is pressing on with back-channel negotiations.\r\n\nA key goal would be retaining control of a portion of the country and addressing Turkey’s demands for a political transition and the potential return of millions of Syrian refugees, a major issue for Ankara.\r\n\nAssad is also proposing a new constitution and talks with the mostly exiled political opposition, according to the people familiar with the outreach.\r\n\nIt’s unclear if the efforts will bear fruit. Events on the battlefield have their own momentum, and even countries such as Turkey that have influence over the rebels may not be able to fully control events.\r\n\n“I don’t think any of these outside powers have the leverage over their proxies to change the course of what is happening on the ground,” said Andreas Krieg, director of London-based MENA Analytica Ltd. “At this moment most bets are that the Assad regime may not be able to hold out.”\r\n\nPatriarch visit\n\nIt was against that backdrop that Assad sent Syriac Orthodox Patriarch Ignatius Aphrem II to Hungary on Monday to relay his fears. Syria’s Christian community makes up about 10% of the country’s 24 million population.\r\n\nThe plan to have Orban relate this message to Trump was described by an aide to the patriarch and another person with knowledge of the encounter.\r\n\nPeople close to Trump couldn’t immediately comment, but said he had dispatched his in-law and Middle East adviser, Massad Boulos, to the UAE on Saturday to discuss the situation in the region.\r\n\nAssad has pursued similar tactics before. HTS leader Abu Mohammad al-Golani and other rebels have in recent days attempted to allay the fears of Christians and Syria’s other minorities that they envision a form of Islamic rule.\r\n\nAssad’s own Alawite community, which has stuck by him since 2011 and paid a heavy price to defend the regime, also appears to sense the end may be near.\r\n\nNariman, an Alawite woman reached by phone in Damascus on Friday said she, her husband who’s in the security forces and their 23-year-old son were fleeing to their ancestral village near Jableh in western Syria. She said there were many families like hers.\r\n\nNobody is going to fight for Assad this time, she said, asking not to be identified by her last name for reasons of safety.\r\n\n©2024 Bloomberg L.P. \n\nVisit bloomberg.com. \n\nDistributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.","url":"https://www.stripes.com/theaters/middle_east/2024-12-07/assad-overture-us-diplomacy-biden-trump-16091360.html","image":"https://www.stripes.com/incoming/5rkp3c-syria_control-areas.jpg/alternates/LANDSCAPE_480/Syria_control%20areas.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-12-08 00:33:47","author":"Sam Dagher","authors":["Sam Dagher"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.154},{"id":271353012,"title":"French first lady helps keep Trump, Bidens apart at Notre Dame","text":"Paris, France — French officials solved an awkward seating dilemma at the Notre Dame cathedral re-opening on Saturday by placing First Lady Brigitte Macron between US President-elect Donald Trump and Joe Biden's wife and daughter in the front row at the ceremony.The presence of Trump and the outgoing president's family presented protocol planners with a headache so soon after one of the most bitter election campaigns in US history.Trump ridiculed Biden as \"Sleepy Joe\" throughout, while Biden called Trump a \"threat to democracy\" and let it be known that he considered him a \"fascist\" on the eve of the November 5 vote.

Instead of planting a continental kiss on her cheek – as Mr Trump did – the future King limited their exchange to a fleeting handclasp.\n\nHe did the same with president Macron, whose own handshake with Mr Trump was, in contrast, far more vigorous, almost awkwardly so.\n\nThe prince and Mr Trump met later for private discussions at the UK ambassador’s residence, the imposing Hôtel de Charost.\n\nThe King has signalled that he is ready to use the Royal Family’s much vaunted soft power to help smooth relations between the UK and Mr Trump’s incoming US administration, so there was a lot riding on William’s mission.\n\nAll the more so as Sir Keir Starmer has vowed to move Britain closer to the EU, despite warnings this could alienate Mr Trump, whose promise to shake up the world order presents a serious challenge to the “special relationship” between the two countries.\n\nPotentially there were plenty of other issues for William to smooth over – including doubts raised by Mr Trump’s team over Prince Harry’s US visa.\n\nThen again, with relations between the brothers at an all-time low, he most likely thought it better to let sleeping dogs lie.\n\nThe prince was also due to speak to America’s outgoing first lady Jill Biden and her daughter Ashley, 43, for another discussion about the UK-US special relationship.\n\nWilliam and Mr Trump, 78, had originally been scheduled to meet before the cathedral event, but the prince’s journey to Paris had been delayed by Storm Darragh.\n\nThe Prince of Wales last met Mr Trump in 2019 when the then-president made a state visit to the UK. Laurent Ulbrich, the Archbishop of Paris, began the ceremony by tapping three times on Notre Dame’s giant doors of with a staff crafted from charred wood salvaged during the fire.\n\nThe ensuing ceremony included the reawakening of the cathedral’s thunderous 8,000-pipe organ and the celebration of the first Mass.\n\nApplause erupted when Ukraine’s president Volodymyr Zelensky entered the building, from the gathered crowd.\n\nIt included 40 world leaders as well as several celebrities, including Mr Trump’s billionaire cheerleader Elon Musk and actress Salma Hayek, whose husband, Francois-Henri Pinault, the chief executive of Gucci and Yves St Laurent owner Kering, had pledged £82million towards the restoration.\n\nThe beginning of the ceremony was marked with the ringing of the cathedral’s largest bell, built in 1683 and named Emmanuel by its ‘godfather’ Louis XIV.\n\nIt weighs 13 tons and was the only bell in Notre-Dame to evade destruction during the French Revolution. Mr Macron thanked the global ‘brotherhood’ of craftsmen and donors for their help in what he described as the ‘leap of faith’ required to rebuild Notre-Dame in just five years.\n\nThe same message “merci” was projected on to the building’s facade.\n\nConcluding his speech to a standing ovation, Mr Macron said: “Notre-Dame de Paris has been returned to you, you have made this possible. Long live Notre- Dame de Paris, long live the Republic, long live France.”","summary":"Greeting the Prince of Wales at the ceremonial reopening of Notre-Dame cathedral, Donald Trump was sending a message.  ","url":"https://thewest.com.au/news/royal-family/donald-trumps-handshake-with-prince-william-at-notre-dame-opening-sends-message--c-17012711","image":"https://images.thewest.com.au/publication/C-17012711/bf02ed4cddf6b6556a27e2b1cbbc358565ac24ef-16x9-x0y91w5616h3159.jpg?imwidth=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-12-08 00:30:45","author":"Mr Trump,Natasha Livingstone","authors":["Mr Trump","Natasha Livingstone"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"au","sentiment":-0.185},{"id":271350244,"title":"Donald Trump’s handshake with Prince William at Notre Dame opening sends message","text":"Camera IconPresident-elect Donald Trump couldn’t resist his famous “clasp and yank” handshake.

The two spoke about a month after former President Donald Trump’s win over Vice President Kamala Harris in the presidential election.\n\n“We’re just passing through, and we all need to just calm down and do something that builds people up instead of tears them down,” Bill Clinton said.\n\nHillary Clinton, the former secretary of state who was defeated by Trump in the 2016 election, said she understands the next couple of years are going to be challenging for voters who don’t agree with the decisions being made.\n\n“In addition to staying involved and staying aware, it’s important to find something that makes you feel good about the day because if you’re in a constant state of agitation about our political situation, it is really going to shorten your life,” she said.\n\nThe Clintons spoke during a panel discussion with journalist Laura Ling, who the former president helped free in 2009 when she was detained in North Korea with another journalist. The event was held as part of a weekend of activities marking the 20th anniversary of the Clinton Presidential Library’s opening in Little Rock. The library is preparing to undergo an update of its exhibits and an expansion that will include Hillary Clinton’s personal archives.\n\nHillary Clinton said part of the goal is to modernize the facility and expand it to make it a more open, inviting place for people for convene and make connections.\n\nWhen asked about advice he would give for people disappointed by the election results, Bill Clinton said people need to continue working toward bringing people together and improving others’ lives.\n\n“If that’s the way you keep score, then you ought to be trying to run up the score,” he said. “Not lamenting the fact that somebody else is winning a different game because they keep score a different way.”\n\n“And in addition, figure out what we can do to win again,” Hillary Clinton added, eliciting cheers.\n\nThe program featured a panel discussion with cast members of the hit NBC show “The West Wing” and former Clinton White House staffers.\n\nThe weekend amounted to a reunion of former Clinton White House staffers, supporters and close friends, including former Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe and adviser James Carville.\n\nMcAuliffe said he and Carville ate Friday at Doe’s Eat Place, a downtown restaurant that was popular with Clinton aides and reporters during Clinton’s 1992 White House run. He said he viewed the library and its planned expansion as important for the future.\n\n“This is not only about the past, but it’s more importantly about the future,” McAuliffe said. “We just went through a very tough election, and people are all saying we’ve got to get back to the Clinton model.”","summary":"The remarks were made at the 20th anniversary of the Clinton presidential library.","url":"https://www.mercurynews.com/2024/12/07/clintons-urge-voters-agitated-by-todays-politics-to-remain-involved-in-public-service/","image":"https://www.mercurynews.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/chelseahillarybillfamily.jpg?w=1024&h=700","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-12-08 00:26:06","author":"Associated Press","authors":["Associated Press"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.05},{"id":271347322,"title":"Trump’s Crypto-AI Czar Sacks Is Longtime Critic of Tech Regulation","text":"David Sacks, President-elect Donald Trump’s surprise pick to guide policy on artificial intelligence and cryptocurrency, doesn’t have deep ties to either industry or an extensive track record of investing in them. What he does have, though, is even more important in the eyes of technology investors — a tech-friendly worldview and a long history of skepticism about government regulation. “He will ensure the United States is at the cutting edge of innovation,” said Keith Rabois, who celebrated with Sacks at a private home in Miami Thursday night. Sacks will keep the country from falling behind China, and will protect “newly emerging tech from left-wing censorship and bias,” Rabois said. The appointment of Sacks, a major Trump fundraiser, was not widely anticipated in Silicon Valley. The VC has only made a handful of crypto investments, and isn’t seen as a key player in the industry. He’s also made relatively few AI bets, though he’s a backer of xAI, the startup helmed by Elon Musk that has raised more than $10 billion this year. But Sacks has long been critical of too much government involvement in the affairs of private companies. The 52-year-old founder of VC firm Craft Ventures and member of the so-called PayPal Mafia has been one of the loudest right-leaning voices in the industry for years. The pick is seen as a boon to the startup world, where AI and crypto executives view government intervention as a potential existential threat. US action against crypto companies has driven many startups overseas. And AI leaders have worried that overly burdensome regulations could stifle the fledgling industry in the name of safety. Crypto supporters celebrated the selection, which Trump said would give startups regulatory clarity. “Crypto and AI are two of the United States’ most pressing strategic priorities right now, and David Sacks is one of the only people in the world that is uniquely qualified to lead in this pivotal role,” said Kyle Samani, a managing partner at Multicoin Capital, where Sacks is an investor. Sacks will be an “invaluable asset in shaping the nation’s future,” Samani said. Startup competition Trump has signaled that he’ll take a friendly approach to both crypto and AI. Bitcoin has hit all-time highs since his election, and he has vowed to repeal President Biden’s 2023 AI executive order that requires developers to safety-test new models. AI is also a focus for Musk, a key Trump ally and a longtime friend of Sacks. Investor Marc Andreessen, whose firm invests heavily in both industries, was ebullient at Sacks’ pick. “From the Wright Brothers to Starship With Chopsticks, in just a single election,” Andreessen wrote on X on Thursday night, referencing SpaceX’s latest achievement of landing re-usable starships. OpenAI Chief Executive Officer Sam Altman also struck a celebratory note, writing on X, “congrats to czar @DavidSacks!” But there’s been some trepidation over Sacks’ allegiances in the AI world. Sacks’ Craft Ventures is an investor in Musk’s xAI, and Sacks’ ties to Musk have raised questions about how he would treat rival companies in the fiercely competitive industry. Sacks has previously spoken critically of OpenAI, a key xAI competitor. In a now-deleted post on X, Sacks said, “I’m all in favor of accelerating technological progress, but there is something unsettling about the way OpenAI explicitly declares its mission to be the creation of AGI.” AGI, or artificial general intelligence, refers to AI technology that can perform most tasks better than humans. Sacks did not respond to a request for comment on the post. Sacks and Trump allies say that involvement in the industry is a prerequisite for understanding it, and that some perceptions of conflict of interest will be inevitable. “I think we should take people at their word,” said Shaun Maguire, an investor at the prestigious Sequoia Capital, which has backed both xAI and OpenAI. Sacks “won’t harm any competitors,” he said. Sacks’ other bets include BitGo and Bitwise in the crypto world. In AI, Sacks co-founded a startup called Glue that makes chat software for companies, and he’s invested in developer startup Replit Inc. and AI writing tool CopyAI Inc. Sacks will not leave Craft, a spokeswoman said, and the new czar position will function as an advisory role, rather than a full-time government job. The appointment won’t require Sacks to divest or publicly disclose his assets. Like Musk, Sacks will be a special government employee. He can serve a maximum of 130 days per year, with or without compensation. However, conflict of interest rules apply to special government employees, and Sacks would be required to recuse himself from matters that could impact his holdings. Tech-Friendly There’s a long history of technology officials taking advisory roles to the government, said Silicon Valley historian Margaret O’Mara. But the roles don’t always have a clear mandate. “You can have a title, but if you don’t actually have a budget or people reporting to you, it’s something more ambiguous,” O’Mara said, pointing out that Sacks would not be a White House staff member. “Sometimes it does morph into something that has some power to it.” Some industry observers would have preferred the crypto and AI czar positions to be separate — a move that might have telegraphed the importance of each, and reflected the different risks and rewards of both technologies. “While I am very encouraged by the new administration’s crypto-friendly focus, I would have preferred separate crypto and AI czars,” said Campbell Harvey, finance professor at Duke University. “Both need urgent, dedicated attention,” he said. Sacks has forged a more wide-ranging career, rather than focusing on just AI or crypto. He first made a name for himself at PayPal, the payments company whose founders in the late 1990s included Musk and billionaire investor Peter Thiel. During a stint in Hollywood, he produced the 2005 satire Thank You for Smoking. At Craft, his venture firm with stakes in Musk-owned businesses including SpaceX, he has invested widely as well as serving as a host of the All-In podcast. His comments about crypto on the podcast have not been universally positive, but he has discouraged attempts to penalize or control industry players. “The fact of the matter is you’ve got a lot of brilliant young entrepreneurs, computer scientists building this financial infrastructure of the future with crypto,” he said in a podcast episode in 2021. “We don’t necessarily want to interfere with that to the point where we break it.” He’s also made significant money on crypto. Craft Ventures invested in Samani’s Multicoin Capital in 2018, which in turn was an early investor in the Solana cryptocurrency. The token was worth less than a dollar when it launched in 2020, but notched a peak price of around $250 in late 2021. “It will end up being about $1 billion of Solana for us in terms of returns,” Sacks said at the time. More recently, in a November episode of the podcast after Trump’s election, Sacks took aim at the Securities and Exchange Commission’s aggressive positions on crypto under its chair, Gary Gensler. “The days of Gensler terrifying crypto companies — those days are about to be over.” With assistance from Shirin Ghaffary, Olga Kharif, Katie Roof and Jackie Davalos.

According to the Associated Press, Harrison insisted that abandoning these priorities would undermine the party’s commitment to its core values.\n\n“When I wake up in the morning, when I look in the mirror, when I step out the door, I can’t rub this off,” he said of his skin color. “This is who I am. This is how the world perceives me.”\n\n“That is my identity,” Harrison continued. “And it is not politics. It is my life. And the people that I need in the party, that I need to stand up for me, have to recognize that. You cannot run away from that.”\n\nHarrison’s term will conclude early next year, and he has hinted at revealing more grievances with his party once his replacement is elected on Feb. 1, stating, “the muzzle comes off.” He also teased plans for a book where he will “name names.”\n\n[Harrison] twice suggested he has more grievances he’s itching to get off his chest, saying “the muzzle comes off” the day after his replacement is elected on Feb. 1. He has no plans to endorse a replacement.“That’s it for you all,” Harrison said later as he wrapped up his speech. “Because I’m saving the rest for my book. And I am naming names.”Democrats are having a fierce debate over the reasons Vice President Kamala Harris lost decisively to President-elect Donald Trump and the path forward for a party that will be locked out of the White House and Congressional majorities. Some have argued the party has become too politically correct and overly focused on appealing to voters based on their identity.\n\nIt’s rare for a Democratic Party leader to openly plan to air grievances, but Jaime Harrison seems poised to reveal some serious dirt. With that in mind, his hint about naming names and exposing issues in his forthcoming book suggests he may be ready to pull back the curtain on internal party conflicts. Remember, Donald Trump’s first term was plagued by opportunists working from the inside with the entire purpose of writing a tell-all book. As chairman of the DNC, Harrison likely knows quite a bit about the sausage is made in the DNC, and wants to protect his own legacy as DNC chair at a time that the party lost the House, Senate, and the Oval Office. He may actually go nuclear on his own party. \n\nRecommended: Let's Laugh At Tim Walz Before Everyone Forgets Who He Is\n\nThere’s plenty of reason to believe that Harrison is dead serious, too. Think about it. In recent weeks, tensions within the Democratic Party have come to the surface, with some members even turning their criticism toward Joe Biden. This internal strife, coupled with Harrison’s impending revelations, underscores the growing divisions as the party grapples with its identity and strategy for its devastating defeat.","url":"https://pjmedia.com/matt-margolis/2024/12/07/democrats-are-gonna-eat-each-other-alive-enjoy-the-show-n4934933","image":"https://media.townhall.com/cdn/hodl/2024/191/e74350dd-ec6d-475b-bb55-bc1cbb389061.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-12-08 00:08:47","author":"Matt Margolis","authors":["Matt Margolis"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.173},{"id":271346030,"title":"Will TikTok Really Be Banned in the U.S.?","text":"TikTok, which is owned by the Chinese tech company ByteDance, is a little closer to being banned in the United States. Because of the social media platform's ties to China, many in the U.S. see it as a threat to national security, concerned that its ownership could hand over user data to the Chinese government. In April of this year, Joe Biden signed a law stating that if ByteDance didn't sell the platform, it would have to shut down its presence in the U.S. \n\nEarlier this year, Mao Ning, a spokesperson for China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs, said \"that China’s government has never and will not ask companies to 'collect or provide data, information or intelligence' held in foreign countries, adding the U.S. 'has not provided any evidence so far to prove that TikTok threatens U.S. national security,'\" according to the Associated Press. \n\nBut despite a petition from TikTok to overturn Biden's law, a federal appeals court in Washington, D.C. unanimously denied the request. Judge Douglas Ginsburg wrote the court's opinion, which stated, \"The First Amendment exists to protect free speech in the United States. Here the Government acted solely to protect that freedom from a foreign adversary nation and to limit that adversary’s ability to gather data on people in the United States.\" It's possible the Supreme Court will hear the case at some point in the future. \n\nIt's also possible that Donald Trump will take action when he retakes office on Jan. 20 next year. The former president attempted to ban TikTok himself during his first term, but he has since apparently changed his mind. While on the campaign trail this year, he said he now opposes a ban. In September, he posted on Truth Social, \"FOR ALL OF THOSE THAT WANT TO SAVE TIK TOK IN AMERICA, VOTE TRUMP!\" The post included a video in which he said the \"other side\" was \"closing it up,\" but he's a \"big star\" on the platform who is \"setting records.\" \n\nElon Musk, who owns the social media platform X and who has become a big part of Trump's inner circle, could have something to do with Trump's change of heart. He's opposed the TikTok ban from the beginning, citing that it would be \"contrary to freedom of speech and expression,\" and that is not what the United States stands for. \n\nByteDance has said that it does not plan to sell the social media platform, and even if it did, a Chinese law could block the sale. Michael Hughes, a TikTok spokesperson, said of the court's ruling, \"Unfortunately, the TikTok ban was conceived and pushed through based upon inaccurate, flawed and hypothetical information, resulting in outright censorship of the American people. The TikTok ban, unless stopped, will silence the voices of over 170 million Americans here in the US and around the world on January 19th, 2025.\"","url":"https://pjmedia.com/sarah-anderson/2024/12/07/will-tiktok-really-be-banned-in-the-us-n4934925","image":"https://media.townhall.com/cdn/hodl/2020/189/6e167bef-240b-4761-ab25-d9295a2217ea.png","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-12-08 00:08:47","author":"Sarah Anderson","authors":["Sarah Anderson"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.012},{"id":271345982,"title":"Trump Doubles Down On His Support for Pete Hegseth","text":"President-elect Donald Trump is doubling down on his support for his defense secretary pick, Pete Hegseth, as the media relentlessly attacks him to knock him off the nomination. \n\nDuring an interview with “Meet the Press\" Moderator Kristen Welker, Trump reaffirmed his decision to appoint Hegseth to serve as his defense secretary under his second administration, saying that “Pete is doing well.”\n\n“I mean, people were a little bit concerned. He’s a young guy with a tremendous track record, actually. He went to Princeton and went to Harvard. He was a good student at both. But he loves the military, and I think people are starting to see it, so we’ll be working on his nomination along with a lot of others,” Trump said. \n\nThe former Fox News host is facing scrutiny over his alleged drinking “problem” and sexual misconduct from an unnamed, unverifiable woman who claims Hegseth “raped” her without providing evidence. \n\nFollowing the interview, Trump posted to his Truth Social account, calling Hegseth a “winner” and saying that “there is nothing that can be done to change that!!!”\n\n“He will be a fantastic, high-energy Secretary of Defense Defense, one who leads with charisma and skill,” he wrote. \n\nThis comes as news outlets confirmed Trump had discussed replacing Hegseth with Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis (R-FL). \n\nHowever, Trump told Welker that he had several senators who assured him that Hegseth would be confirmed. \n\nPointing out that Trump does not drink, Welker asked if she had concerns about Hegseth’s excessive drinking, despite him vowing not to drink if he got confirmed. Defending Hegseth, Trump said that he has spoken to multiple people who say he does not have a drinking problem.","url":"https://townhall.com/tipsheet/saraharnold/2024/12/07/trump-doubles-down-on-his-support-for-pete-hegseth-n2648746","image":"https://media.townhall.com/cdn/hodl/2024/311/6ae4f4eb-ce11-42d9-855f-d48eeb1aa930.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-12-08 00:08:47","author":"Sarah Arnold","authors":["Sarah Arnold"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.062},{"id":271346450,"title":"Trump’s bizarre power move caught on video","text":"Mr Trump gave the British heir to the throne a pat on the shoulder before the two shook hands and had a brief conversation.\n\nThe pair will meet again later in another location in Paris, according to Kensington Palace.\n\nBut it was Mr Trump’s bizarre encounter with French President Emmanuel Macron that’s got people talking,\n\nDuring a tense photo-op handshake, the President-elect raised Mr Macron’s hand while in the embrace to ensure his hand was on top in a dominating position during the exchange. \n\nMr Trump and Mr Macron met in front of the Elysee Palace, where the pair smiled for photos between a pair of guards as the President-elect gripped the French leader’s hand.\n\nThe move, reminiscent of a white-knuckle, prolonged grip the pair had during Mr Trump’s first term in office, forced Mr Macron to lean into Mr Trump, before the President-elect let go and headed inside the building.\n\n“President Trump just made Macron his b — h with one handshake,” one critic assessed on X.\n\nMr Trump told reporters he and Mr Macron would be discussing a world that’s gone “a little crazy” during their talks. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky joined the pair afterwards in the trilateral sit-down.\n\nPrior to the ceremony, Mr Trump praised the French leader, proclaiming that he had done “a wonderful job ensuring that Notre Dame has been restored to its full level of glory, and even more so. It will be a very special day for all!”\n\nThe trio met inside the Elysee Palace, with photos showing Mr Trump expressionless as Mr Macron placed his hand on the arm of a seated Mr Zelensky. The French president appeared to give Mr Zelensky a reassuring look.\n\nThe trio posed for a picture but made no further public comment before starting the talks.\n\nMr Zelensky later said he had had a “good and productive” meeting with Mr Trump and Mr Macron on Saturday.\n\n“I had a good and productive trilateral meeting with President Donald Trump and President Emmanuel Macron at the Elysee Palace,” Mr Zelensky said on social media. \n\n“We all want this war to end as soon as possible and in a just way.”\n\nThe trilateral meeting is the first face-to-face meeting between Mr Zelensky and Mr Trump since the latter’s presidential election win in November.\n\nMr Trump had vowed to bring an end to the nearly three-year war sparked by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine by forcing a peace agreement, claiming on the campaign trail that he could end the conflict in one day owing to Kyiv’s reliance on US weaponry. \n\nMr Macron scored a major coup by attracting Mr Trump, on his first foreign trip since his re-election, for the ceremony along with some 40 other leaders, including British heir to the throne, Prince William.\n\nIt is “a cathedral like we have never seen before,” Philippe Jost, the head of the restoration project, told Franceinfo radio, saying he was proud to “show the whole world” a “great collective success and a source of pride for all of France”.\n\nIn one last-minute hitch, harsh weather forced officials to move Mr Macron’s planned speech indoors and prerecord a concert planned for after the ceremony, with forecasts for winds of up to 80 kilometres per hour.\n\nThe service will feature prayer, organ music and hymns from the cathedral’s choir, followed by the televised concert - prerecorded Friday night due to the weather - with performances by Chinese piano virtuoso Lang Lang, South African opera singer Pretty Yende and an orchestra conducted by Venezuelan maestro Gustavo Dudamel.\n\nUS singer and fashion designer Pharrell Williams is also believed to have taken part.\n\nOriginally published as World leaders and royals gather in Paris for reopening of Notre Dame","url":"https://www.adelaidenow.com.au/news/world/world-leaders-and-royals-gather-in-paris/news-story/04f1c1541cc8bf0f84797ba32d3b6e61","image":"https://content.api.news/v3/images/bin/d4615c8135ef2d55d63804f8f35a4947","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-12-08 00:07:47","author":"Megan Palin","authors":["Megan Palin"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"au","sentiment":-0.007},{"id":271345062,"title":"Trump is welcomed by Macron to Paris with presidential pomp and joined by Zelenskyy for their talks","text":"PARIS (AP) — French President Emmanuel Macron welcomed Donald Trump to Paris on Saturday with a full dose of presidential pomp as the two held a hastily arranged meeting with Ukraine’s Volodymyr Zelenskyy before celebrating the grand reopening of the Notre Dame Cathedral.\n\nOn a day that mixed pageantry with attention to pressing global problems, the once and future American president was warmly embraced by Macron upon arriving at the Elysee Palace.\n\n“It’s a great honor for French people to welcome you five years later,” Macron told Trump. “Welcome back again.”\n\nTrump said it was a “very great honor” to be there, while hinting at challenges ahead.\n\n“It certainly seems like the world is going a little crazy right now. And we’ll be talking about that,” Trump said.\n\nAn actual red carpet was rolled out for Trump as Macron bestowed the kind of full diplomatic welcome that France offers sitting American presidents, complete with trumpets blaring and members of the Republican Guard in full uniform. It was a clear sign that even though Trump doesn’t take office until Jan. 20, 2025, Macron and other European leaders are already working to win his favor and treating him as America’s representative on the world stage.\n\nPresident Joe Biden declined an invitation to attend the Notre Dame ceremony, five years after a devastating fire, with the White House citing a scheduling conflict. First lady Jill Biden was the official U.S. representative in his place.\n\nMacron and leaders across Europe are trying to persuade the president-elect to maintain support for Ukraine in its defense against Russia’s invasion. Macron’s office said the war, along with conflicts in the Mideast, would be discussed.\n\nAs Trump arrived at the official residence of the French president, Macron went out of his way to project an image of close ties, offering handshakes and plenty of back-patting for the cameras.\n\nIn a video posted later on X, Macron could be heard asking Trump: “You remember?” as both men entered a reception room.\n\n“I remember,” Trump answered.\n\nTrump spent about 90 minutes inside, meeting first with Macron before they were joined by Zelenskyy for about 35 minutes.\n\nMacron had long planned to meet separately with Zelenskyy. The French president’s office said the three-way talks were proposed by Macron and arranged shortly before Trump’s arrival. Trump has pledged to end the war in Ukraine swiftly but has not specified how, raising concerns in Kyiv about what terms may be laid out for any future negotiations.\n\nA person familiar with Trump’s plans had said before the meeting was announced that while Trump and Zelenskyy were attending the cathedral ceremony and surrounding events and probably would interact, Trump’s transition team had not worked with the Ukrainians to schedule formal talks.\n\nAfter the place meeting, a Trump senior transition official did not push back on the idea that it had come together at the last minute, but said it had been “discussed fully and agreed to” and that Trump had been “fully briefed” ahead of time.\n\nThe three leaders spoke in English, and translator was in the room, according to a French official.\n\nAccompanying Trump to Paris was a small contingent of advisers that included incoming chief of staff Susie Wiles, along with Steve Witkoff, a longtime friend and real estate investor whom Trump has tapped as his special envoy to the Middle East, and Massad Boulos, who is the father-in-law of Trump’s daughter Tiffany and will serve as senior adviser on Arab and Middle Eastern affairs.\n\nThe group did not appear to include anyone with expertise on Ukraine.\n\n“United States, Ukraine and France. Together on this historic day. United for Notre-Dame. Let’s continue to work together for peace and security,” Macron wrote on X afterward.\n\nTrump’s victory last month threw into doubt the Biden administration’s flow of money and arms to Ukraine — aid bolstered even more on Saturday by U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin’s announcement of a $988 million package that brings American military support to more than $62 billion since Russia’s invasion in February 2022.\n\nTrump has characterized Zelenskyy as “the greatest salesman on Earth” for winning billions in U.S. aid. Trump also has said he work out a peace deal between Russia and Ukraine within a day of taking office and has promoted his good relationship with Russian President Vladimir Putin.\n\nIn an effort to build trust with the incoming U.S. administration, Zelenskyy’s top aide Andriy Yermak met key members of Trump’s team on a two-day trip to the U.S. earlier this week.\n\nMacron has argued that Ukraine’s defeat or a cease-fire with Russia on unfavorable terms to Ukraine would be viewed as a loss for the U.S. and even Trump himself, according to two European officials familiar with the matter.\n\nAfter arriving at Notre Dame for the ceremony, Trump was greeted by Macron and his wife, Brigitte. He was given prime seating at the service right between them — a better location than Jill Biden, who sat on Brigitte Macron’s other side — and many current heads of government and state.\n\nInside, Trump also greeted Zelenskyy as well as Britain’s Prince William, who Trump met with later at the British ambassador’s residence in Paris. Trump was greeted in the foyer, shook the royal’s hand and said “good man, this one.”\n\nTrump told reporters the Prince of Wales was doing “a fantastic job” before the two went to sit down and talk in a private room reserved for high-profile figures in the residence that once was the Paris town home of Princess Pauline Borghese, the youngest sister French Emperor Napoleon Bonaparte.\n\nPrince William was also scheduled to meet separately with Jill Biden, according to the British royal palace.\n\nElon Musk, the billionaire CEO of Tesla and X who has spent considerable time with Trump since the election and spent millions to elect him, was also in attendance at Notre Dame.\n\nMacron, who has had an up-and-down relationship with Trump, has made a point of cultivating their bond since the Republican defeated Democrat Kamala Harris. But Macron’s office nonetheless played down the significance of the invitation, saying other politicians not now in office had been invited as well.\n\nTrump was invited as president-elect of a “friendly nation,” Macron’s office said, adding, “This is in no way exceptional, we’ve done it before.”\n\nTrump is known to revel in pomp and circumstance. One of his first trips as president his first term was to Paris, where Macron made him the the guest of honor at Bastille Day events. Trump later said he wanted to replicate the grand military parade back in the United States.\n\nRelations between France and the U.S. during Trump’s first term began warmly enough but grew increasingly strained over time.\n\nMacron was the guest of honor at Trump’s first state dinner, and Trump traveled to France several times. But the relationship suffered after Macron criticized Trump for questioning the need for NATO and raising doubts about America’s commitment to the mutual defense pact.\n\nDuring the 2024 presidential campaign, Trump often mocked Macron, imitating his accent and threatening to impose steep tariffs on wine and champagne bottles shipped to the U.S. if France tried to tax American companies.\n\nBut Macron was one of the first global leaders to congratulate Trump last month after the election.\n\nWhen he accepted the invitation to travel to Paris, Trump said Macron had done “a wonderful job ensuring that Notre Dame has been restored to its full level of glory, and even more so. It will be a very special day for all!” Trump was president in 2019, when a fire nearly destroyed the 861-year-old landmark.\n\nGomez Licon reported from Fort Lauderdale, Florida, and Colvin from New York.

The Trump campaign raked in nearly $87 million during that same period and spent $113 million, the president-elect's campaign filings indicated.Harris held large rallies in swing states like Georgia and Pennsylvania throughout her campaign, especially in the immediate weeks leading up to the election. And despite the vice president's financial advantage over Trump, she had to boost her profile to an electorate that had long expected Biden to be the nominee and was uncertain about her positions on various issues — from tackling inflation to her approach to foreign policy.The new FEC report also seemingly puts to rest any talk that the Harris campaign is heavily in debt, a notion that the campaign rejected last month when it told The New York Times that \"there will be no debt\" on the filings.But in the weeks since the general election, Democrats have still received fundraising appeals from the Harris operation. The \"Harris Fight Fund\" is the postelection operation of the general election \"Harris Victory Fund\" and is touted as a way to help provide accountability for the Trump administration.The Democratic National Committee's newest filings revealed that it had over $47 million in cash on hand, while its rival, the Republican National Committee, had nearly $43 million in the bank.Business Insider reached out to the Harris campaign for comment.","summary":"From October 17 through November 25, which included a key stretch of the race, Vice President Harris raised $160 million and spent over $270 million.","url":"https://www.businessinsider.com/harris-leftover-money-campaign-spending-fec-2024-12","image":"https://i.insider.com/6754c6f14adc4cc134353779?width=1200&format=jpeg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-12-07 23:59:06","author":"John L.

Swathes of Homs were destroyed by gruelling siege warfare between the rebels and the army years ago. The fighting ground down the insurgents, who were forced out.\n\nHayat Tahrir al-Sham commander Abu Mohammed al-Golani, the main rebel leader, called the capture of Homs a historic moment and urged fighters not to harm \"those who drop their arms\".\n\nRebels freed thousands of detainees from the city prison. Security forces left in haste after burning their documents.\n\nThe battle for control of the country is likely to turn quickly to the capital. Residents of numerous Damascus districts turned out to protest Assad on Saturday evening, and security forces were either unwilling or unable to clamp down.\n\nSyrian rebel commander Hassan Abdul Ghani said in a statement early Sunday that operations were ongoing to \"completely liberate\" the countryside around Damascus and rebel forces were looking toward the capital.\n\nIn one suburb, a statue of Assad's father, the late President Hafez al-Assad, was toppled and torn apart.\n\nThe Syrian army said it was reinforcing around Damascus, and state television reported on Saturday that Assad remained in the city.\n\nOutside the city, rebels swept across the entire southwest over 24 hours and established control.\n\nEXISTENTIAL THREAT TO ASSAD RULE\n\nThe fall of Homs and threat to the capital pose an immediate existential danger to the Assad dynasty's five-decade reign over Syria and the continued influence there of its main regional backer, Iran.\n\nItem 1 of 5 Rebel fighters, Homs countryside, Syria, December 7, 2024.

One U.S. official put the timeframe at five to 10 days, while another said Assad could be ousted within the coming week.\n\nThe pace of events has stunned Arab capitals and raised fears of a new wave of regional instability.\n\nQatar, Saudi Arabia, Jordan, Egypt, Iraq, Iran, Turkey and Russia issued a joint statement saying the crisis was a dangerous development and calling for a political solution.\n\nBut there was no indication they agreed on any concrete steps, with the situation inside Syria changing by the hour.\n\nSyria's civil war, which erupted in 2011 as an uprising against Assad's rule, dragged in big outside powers, created space for jihadist militants to plot attacks around the world and sent millions of refugees into neighbouring states.\n\nHayat Tahrir al-Sham, the strongest rebel group, is the former al Qaeda affiliate in Syria regarded by the U.S. and others as a terrorist organisation, and many Syrians remain fearful it will impose draconian Islamist rule.\n\nGolani has tried to reassure minorities that he will not interfere with them and the international community that he opposes Islamist attacks abroad. In Aleppo, which the rebels captured a week ago, there have not been reports of reprisals.\n\nWhen asked on Saturday whether he believed Golani, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov replied, \"The proof of the pudding is in the eating\".\n\nLebanon's Iran-backed Hezbollah group withdrew from the Syrian city of Qusayr on the border with Lebanon before rebel forces seized it, Syrian army sources said on Sunday.\n\nAt least 150 armoured vehicles carrying hundreds of Hezbollah fighters left the city, long a point on the route for arms transfers and fighters moving in and out of Syria, the sources said. Israel hit one of the convoys as it was departing, one source said.\n\nALLIES' ROLE IN SUPPORTING ASSAD\n\nAssad long relied on allies to subdue the rebels. Russian warplanes conducted bombing while Iran sent allied forces including Hezbollah and Iraqi militia to reinforce the Syrian military and storm insurgent strongholds.\n\nBut Russia has been focused on the war in Ukraine since 2022 and Hezbollah has suffered big losses in its own gruelling war with Israel, significantly limiting its ability or that of Iran to bolster Assad.\n\nU.S. President-elect Donald Trump has said the U.S. should not be involved in the conflict and should \"let it play out\".\n\nReporting by Suleiman al-Khalidi in Damascus, Timour Azhari in Beirut, Jaidaa Taha in Cairo, Phil Stewart and Idrees Ali in Washington; Writing by Angus McDowall and Matt Spetalnick; Editing by Cynthia Osterman\n\nXFacebookLinkedinEmailLinkPurchase Licensing Rights","summary":"Syria rebels celebrate in captured Homs, set sights on Damascus  Reuters","url":"https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/syria-rebels-celebrate-captured-homs-set-sights-damascus-2024-12-07/","image":"https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/BNWAQLEPU5MS3CKSU2S7OVZDHQ.jpg?auth=373b4ea1fa43dad85eaf3f05bf3ea121447bb745f608be5fcf6f0a0032a0fe51&height=1005&width=1920&quality=80&smart=true","video":"https://ajo.prod.reuters.tv/v3/playlist/679100/master.m3u8","publish_date":"2024-12-07 23:56:42","author":"Suleiman Al-Khalidi,Timour Azhari","authors":["Suleiman Al-Khalidi","Timour Azhari"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.113},{"id":271351978,"title":"Amber Heard takes daughter Oonagh, three, for a stroll in Madrid after announcing she is expecting her second child","text":"Black Friday\n\nKim Kardashian\n\nVictoria Beckham\n\nHarry Styles\n\nAmanda Holden\n\nBritain's Got Talent\n\nPrivacy Policy\n\nSunday, Dec 8th 2024\n\n5-Day Forecast\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPrince William is all smiles as he welcomes Donald Trump to the British Embassy in Paris - as the US President-elect hails him as a 'good one' and shares 'fond' memories of late Queen Elizabeth II\n\nBashar al-Assad is mocked as rebels unearth photo of Syrian president in a tiny pair of Speedos after seizing family palace in Aleppo - as officials say government could fall 'in the next week'\n\nWest Ham star Michail Antonio was trapped in his Ferrari for 45 minutes after it smashed into a tree - as injuries from 'single vehicle crash' are 'revealed'\n\n'Being married to Gregg was utter hell': A horrifying insight into the MasterChef star's repulsive behaviour, infidelity and visits to sex workers as revealed by his second wife Denise\n\nThe horrifying truth about my dad Mohamed Al Fayed that means I wish he'd been brought to justice\n\nRevealed: How Mohamed Al Fayed faked dementia to dodge sex abuse probe, says his son - as police investigate Harrods owner's 'enablers'\n\nCarol Vorderman dropped from TV show after 'raising concerns about behaviour like Gregg Wallace's'\n\nBarry Keoghan breaks his silence amid Sabrina Carpenter split and reveals how he has suffered 'disgusting abuse' - with people even 'sitting outside the home of his young son'\n\nDAN HODGES: 'Pensioners will die freezing and alone', a minister confided to me about the winter fuel axe.

These in turn were further reinforced by the U.S. security contingent deployed for President-elect Donald Trump’s visit as well as the security for Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. Both leaders were in Paris for the celebration and met in the Elysee Palace with French President Emmanuel Macron.\n\nBad weather forced the change of logistical plans. Macron, initially scheduled to speak on Notre Dame’s forecourt, spoke inside the cathedral due to howling winds. But nothing could overshadow the moment Parisians and “tout le monde entier,” the whole world, awaited for the last five years, since the inferno of April 15, 2019, that devastated the cathedral’s interior and collapsed the now-rebuilt spire.\n\n“I stand before you to express the gratitude of the French nation, our gratitude to all those who saved, helped and rebuilt the cathedral,” Macron said, adding that France had “achieved the impossible,” renovating Notre Dame in five years — a feat some experts predicted would take decades.\n\n“Tonight we can together share joy and pride. Long live Notre Dame de Paris, long live the Republic and long live France,” he said.\n\nThe cathedral, which for the last five years was home to hundreds of various trade workers, felt as if all the crowned heads and riches of the planet wanted to witness her resurrection, with Prince William, the heir to the British throne, and billionaire businessman Elon Musk present among many. But it was Archbishop Ulrich that opened the cathedral up for the world.\n\n“Notre Dame, model of faith, open your doors to gather in joy the scattered children of God,” Archbishop Ulrich called out in front of the central door, before striking it three times with the tip of his crosier. The pastoral staff itself was made from a beam from the cathedral’s roof structure that escaped the fire.\n\nThe cathedral then “responded” with the singing of Psalm 121 three times.\n\n“I rejoiced when they said to me, ‘Let us go to the house of the LORD.’ And now our feet are standing within your gates, Jerusalem. Jerusalem, built as a city, walled round about,” the psalm reads.\n\nIt was pitch-dark when the bells of Parisian churches rang out across the capital, announcing the arrival on Notre Dame’s forecourt of the liturgical procession of bishops from the Paris region, their chasubles billowing in the wind — with Cardinal Timothy M. Dolan of New York among them.\n\nThe archbishop of Paris then entered the cathedral, followed by President Macron, his wife Brigitte Macron, the first lady of France, and Mayor of Paris Anne Hidalgo. At the entrance, the archbishop paused for a long moment as La Maîtrise Notre Dame de Paris choir sang the Marian hymn and President Macron took his place next to President-elect Trump.\n\nFirefighters, craftsmen and representatives of the 250 companies and sponsors involved in the restoration then paraded through the nave of the cathedral to prolonged applause. Outside, illuminated “Thank you” messages in several languages appeared at the same time on the facade of the cathedral.\n\n“I salute all those, especially the firefighters, who worked so courageously to save this historic monument from catastrophe,” Pope Francis wrote in his message, which was released as he was at the Vatican for the consistory in which he created 21 new cardinals.\n\n“I salute the determined commitment of the public authorities, as well as the great outpouring of international generosity that contributed to the restoration. This moment is a sign not only to art and history, but even more — and how encouraging! — the sign that the symbolic and sacred value of such a building is still widely perceived by many, from those youngest to those oldest,” the pope said.\n\n“We return it to Catholics, to Paris, to France, to the whole world,” Macron said of Notre Dame, which is a state-owned building under French law on the separation of state and church from 1905. He evoked the sound of the cathedral’s bells ringing again, like “a music of hope, familiar to Parisians, to France, to the world,” which have “accompanied our history.”\n\nHe spoke of “an unprecedented fraternity” that has “brought together so many people who have contributed to its rebirth.”\n\n“Transmission and hope, that is the meaning of our presence this evening,” he stressed.\n\nPope Francis also praised those whose work of hands made the cathedral rise again so quickly.\n\n“It is beautiful and reassuring that the skills of yesteryear have been wisely preserved and enhanced,” he wrote, emphasizing that many of the workers and craftsmen “testify to having lived this restoration adventure as part of an authentic spiritual process. They followed in the footsteps of their fathers whose faith, lived out in their work, was the only way to build such a masterpiece.”\n\nThe ceremony itself was an example of a masterpiece in moments such as the archbishop blessing the organ and addressing the massive instrument eight times, singing himself, with the organ responding each time in more and more powerful tones, as part of awakening the organ that had to undergo cleaning and restoration after the 2019 fire.\n\nAmong those gathered inside the cathedral were disadvantaged people specially invited through the charitable associations of the archdiocese, along with representatives of Paris’ 113 parishes.\n\n“We were able to walk around the cathedral before the ceremony began, with the other guests, ministers, bishops, famous artists, in a smiling atmosphere,” Xavier de Noblet, 50, told OSV News. He represented the parish with the oldest church in Paris, Saint-Pierre de Montmartre, which is located on the famous hill just a few meters from the landmark hilltop Basilica of Sacré Cœur de Montmartre.\n\n“This new Notre Dame is a jewel,” he said. “It is hard to imagine that this was done in five years, and not in 107 years, as in the Middle Ages!” de Noblet said, particularly looking forward to the organ’s revival. “It really is the voice of the cathedral,” he explained. “It is going to be a great thrill to hear it again, as if the cathedral were starting to speak anew.”\n\nFather Gaëtan de Bodard, new chaplain of the iconic Paris fire brigade that saved Notre Dame — and successor to Father Jean-Marc Fournier, who courageously ran into the burning cathedral to first preserve the Blessed Sacrament, bless the burning church and then save the crown of thorns — was also full of admiration Dec. 7.\n\n“The cross at the back of the choir shines brightly! What a contrast to the desolate photos of the day after the fire,” he told OSV News. “The simple style of the medieval frescoes that have been restored is touching and prayerful,” he added.\n\nOutside the cathedral, chilling December rain had not prevented crowds from gathering in the famous Latin Quarter just across the Seine River. Giant screens had been set up to allow some 40,000 people to follow the ceremony.\n\n“It is cold, and it is raining, but it is really worth being here,” student Agnès Boüan told OSV News. “Everyone here cheered when they heard the bells, then when they saw on the big screens the firemen and craftsmen marching,” she said. “And for me, as a Catholic, it is also a bit of a symbol of the rebirth of France as the eldest daughter of the church.”\n\nAmong the large number of French people who watched the event on television, one of them, Alain de Layre, was particularly pleased. In 2020, he donated six oak trees from his family forest, located two hours west of Paris, for the renovation of Notre Dame’s roof structure, after having them blessed by his parish priest.\n\n“I am very moved by this resurrection of Notre Dame, and very happy to have supplied some beams,” he told OSV News. “It is a great pride for me to have contributed to this fabulous undertaking. I hope that this extraordinary undertaking will be a symbol of a new stage in the life of our church!”\n\nFor his part, Pope Francis invited “all the baptized who will joyfully enter this Cathedral” to feel “justifiably proud,” and to “reclaim their faith heritage,” when Notre Dame is back for Paris and the world, ahead of the inaugural Mass Dec. 8.\n\nCaroline de Sury writes for OSV News from Paris.","summary":"PARIS (OSV News) &#8212; The solemn reopening of Notre Dame Cathedral put Paris in the center of the Catholic world on the evening of Dec. 7 as the archbishop of France&#8217;s capital struck the magnificent door with his pastoral staff, marking the moment of the iconic Catholic church&#8217;s rebirth.

One US official put the potential time frame at five to 10 days while another said Assad could be ousted in the coming week. A Western official agreed with the latter assessment.\nSeizing Homs, an important crossroads between the capital and the Mediterranean, effectively cuts off Damascus from the coastal stronghold of Assad’s minority Alawite sect, and from Russia’s air and naval base.\nThe Syrian army and security commanders left Homs on Saturday by helicopter for the coast while a large military convoy withdrew by land, a senior army officer said. Rebels said they were entering the city centre.\nThousands poured onto the streets there to celebrate, residents said.\nHoms residents and rebels said the insurgents had captured the central prison and were freeing thousands of detainees. Residents said state security and intelligence personnel had evacuated their offices after burning papers.\nInsurgents have seized almost the entire southwest within 24 hours, and they have advanced to within 30km (20 miles) of Damascus as government forces fell back, rebels said.\nUnderscoring the possibility of an uprising in the capital, protesters took to the streets in several Damascus suburbs, ripping up Assad posters and tearing down a statue of his father, former president Hafez al-Assad, uncontested by army or police. Some were joined by soldiers who had changed into civilian clothes and deserted, residents said.\nHowever, the state news agency reported that Assad remained in Damascus, and the military said it was reinforcing around the capital and south.\n\nThe pace of events has stunned Arab capitals and raised fears of a new wave of regional instability.\nQatar, Saudi Arabia, Jordan, Egypt, Iraq, Iran, Turkey and Russia issued a joint statement saying the crisis was a dangerous development and calling for a political solution.\nBut there was no indication they agreed on any concrete steps, with the situation inside Syria changing by the hour.\nSyria’s civil war, which erupted in 2011 as an uprising against Assad’s rule, dragged in big outside powers, created space for jihadist militants to plot attacks around the world and sent millions of refugees into neighbouring states.\nIn the south, the rapid collapse of government control could allow a concerted assault on the capital, the seat of Assad’s power, where residents said electricity cut out on Saturday.\nThe Syrian military pulled back as far as Saasa, 30km (20 miles), from Damascus to regroup, a Syrian army officer said.\nIn the city’s southern suburb of Jarmana, protesters pulled down a statue of Hafez al-Assad, the president’s father. Soldiers were deserting in the former rebel stronghold of Daraya and in Mezzeh, near a major airbase, residents said.\nHayat Tahrir al-Sham said it had a duty to protect governmental, international and UN offices in Syria.\n\nAssad long relied on allies to subdue the rebels. Russian warplanes conducted bombing while Iran sent allied forces including Lebanon’s Hezbollah and Iraqi militia to reinforce the Syrian military and storm insurgent strongholds.\nBut Russia has been focused on the war in Ukraine since 2022 and Hezbollah has suffered big losses in its own gruelling war with Israel, significantly limiting its ability or that of Iran to bolster Assad.\nUS president-elect Donald Trump has said the US should not be involved in the conflict and should “let it play out”.\nRussia has a naval base and airbase in Syria that have not only been important for its support of Assad, but also for its ability to project influence in the Mediterranean and Africa.\nMoscow has been supporting government forces with intense air strikes but it was not clear if it could easily step up this campaign.\nIran has said it would consider sending forces to Syria, but any immediate extra help is likely to depend on Hezbollah and Iraqi militias. The Lebanese group sent some “supervising forces” to Homs on Friday but any significant deployment would risk exposure to Israeli air strikes, Western officials said.\nIran-backed Iraqi militias are on high alert, with thousands of heavily armed fighters ready to deploy to Syria, many of them amassed near the border. Iraq does not seek military intervention in Syria, a government spokesman said on Friday.\nBritain warned Assad that any chemical weapons use was a red line and would be met with “appropriate action”.","summary":"President Assad’s 24-year rule is dangling by a thread, with one US official saying he could be ousted in the coming week.","url":"https://www.scmp.com/news/world/middle-east/article/3289844/syria-rebels-say-they-control-homs-are-advancing-capital-damascus","image":"https://cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2024/12/08/adf1785c-4aa0-41b3-b626-d77e49c732b4_2c5c5b57.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-12-07 23:52:06","author":"Reuters","authors":["Reuters"],"language":"en","source_country":"cn","sentiment":0.01},{"id":271342932,"title":"Notre Dame reopens in Paris after 5 years of restoration, firefighters honoured","text":"The Archbishop of Paris, Laurent Ulrich, struck the doors of Notre Dame Cathedral three times with his crozier on Saturday, reopening the restored building.

As the 13-ton Emmanuel bell rang out across Paris, Macron began his address. “Tonight the bells of Notre Dame ring again,” he said, calling them “the bells that have accompanied our history”. He expressed the “gratitude” of the French nation to those who saved and rebuilt the cathedral.Macron emphasised the “fraternity” required for the restoration. “Every bit of it was necessary,” he said. “We have rediscovered what great nations could do: achieve the impossible.” He added that the cathedral is a reminder of a history that can vanish at any moment.He concluded his speech with: “Long live Notre-Dame de Paris, long live the French Republic, long live France.”Trump, who sat next to Macron, greeted British Prince William and other heads of state and government as he made his way to the front of the cathedral.Earlier, guests stood and applauded as Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy entered.

One of the bells used during the Paris 2024 Olympic Games at the Stade de France athletics venue has also been installed inside the cathedral with two smaller ones to join the bigger bells already in place.Restoring the historic monument has cost an estimated $737 million, according to Rebuilding Notre Dame de Paris, the public body concerned.

French President Emmanuel Macron was the first to catch a glimpse of the restored historic masterpiece.The re-opening will be a high-security event since around 50 Heads of State and the Government are expected to attend.

Some countries may be in for an unpleasant surprise:\n\nThe incoming Trump administration is preparing a list of countries to which it may deport migrants when their home countries refuse to accept them, according to three sources familiar with the plans. The countries on the list have included but may not be limited to Turks and Caicos, the Bahamas, Panama and Grenada, the sources said. \n\nSince the report comes from NBC News, they go out of their way to imply that the tactic would be unusually cruel:\n\nThe plans could mean that thousands, if not hundreds of thousands, of migrants would be permanently displaced in countries where they do not know any of the people or the language and have no connection to the culture. \n\nOf course, many of these folks already went to a place where they did not know the people or the language—the United States of America when they unlawfully came across our border. NBC neglects to mention that.\n\nRelated: Border Patrol Chief 'Excited' About Incoming Trump Administration\n\nHow would this work, though? There are a lot of details to be worked out:\n\nIt is not clear if the migrants would be allowed to legally remain to work and live in the countries to which they are deported. It is also not known what kind of pressure — either economic or diplomatic — the Trump transition is applying to countries to get them to agree, or might apply once President-elect Donald Trump is inaugurated in January.\n\nAmericans’ increasing displeasure with illegal immigration played a huge part in Trump’s victory in November, as the Biden-Harris regime virtually invited illegals to come into our country unfettered. Many polls showed it was a top concern, especially among Republicans, and Trump has vowed he will stop the influx and deport millions who are living here against the law.\n\nCountries that refuse to take back their citizens have long been a thorn in our side:\n\nForeign governments that refuse to take back deportees have long frustrated federal immigration authorities in multiple administrations. In lieu of remaining in detention indefinitely, many of these individuals may simply be released back into the U.S., even if an immigration judge has ordered them to be removed.Under the Biden administration, federal immigration authorities and major cities across the country experienced an unprecedented illegal immigration crisis. Management of this crisis was made more difficult when Venezuela, the second-highest source of illegal immigration into the U.S., stopped accepting deportation flights in February.\n\nVenezuela—where nearly 8 million citizens have fled the country under President Nicolas Maduro—Cuba and China have shown themselves to be resistant to accepting deportees in the past. \n\nWe’ll just have to see if Trump does end up pursuing this plan or if instead he’s able to \"convince \" (i.e., give them a \"deal they can't refuse\") countries like Venezuela to take back their own people. One thing is certain: he’s not planning on sitting idle like Biden-Harris and just watching the whole thing explode.","url":"https://redstate.com/bobhoge/2024/12/07/report-heres-how-trump-might-deal-with-countries-that-refuse-to-take-their-illegal-immigrants-back-n2182940","image":"https://media.townhall.com/cdn/hodl/2024/235/728dec4f-e936-4ef8-9903-2926c4bbf249.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-12-07 23:43:48","author":"Bob Hoge","authors":["Bob Hoge"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.329},{"id":271342104,"title":"Syria&#039;s Assad Regime May Be Falling as Rebels Reach Damascus Suburbs; Trump Calls for No US Involvement","text":"JERUSALEM, Israel – Syrian rebels reached the suburbs of Damascus, Syria's capital, on Saturday as the government of President Bashar al-Assad appeared to be on the verge of collapse. \n\nThe opposition forces' surprising march through Syria picked up speed as people stocked up on food and many fled to the Lebanese border.

And I hope that they will build on the strength that we have forged over the past four years.”\n\nThe package, valued at $988m, comes on the heels of a separate $725m in military assistance announced on December 2.\n\nThe latest announcement includes drones and munitions for the High Mobility Artillery Rocket Systems (HIMARs) that the US has previously provided.\n\nIn total, the US has given $62bn in military aid to Ukraine since Russia launched its full-scale invasion of the country in February 2022.\n\nBut the latest rush of funds and supplies to Ukraine arrives in the waning days of President Joe Biden’s administration.

Donald Trump to bring peace to the Middle East.Prince Turki Al Faisal, who was Saudi Arabia's intelligence chief for more than two decades, also said he hoped Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu would be brought before the International Criminal Court (ICC).His comments at the Manama Dialogue conference in Bahrain follow increasingly tough statements from Saudi officials since talks were paused on a potential normalisation of ties with Israel after the start of the Gaza war.\"Israel today, according to international human rights groups, is not only an apartheid colonial state, but it is also a genocidal one,\" Prince Turki said.\"It is committing genocide on the people of Gaza.\"He added: \"It's about time for the world to... take the necessary steps to bring those who are charged by the International Criminal Court to justice.\"The ICC issued warrants for Netanyahu and former defence minister Yoav Gallant last month on suspicion of crimes against humanity and war crimes.Saudi's de facto ruler, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, also accused Israel of genocide at a joint Arab League and Organisation of Islamic Cooperation summit in Riyadh last month.Amnesty International levelled the same charge this week in a new report that was dismissed by Israel as \"fabricated\" and \"based on lies\".The war in Gaza was sparked by Hamas's October 7, 2023 attack on southern Israel, which resulted in the deaths of 1,208 people, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally based on official figures.Israel's retaliatory military campaign has killed at least 44,612 people in Gaza, mostly civilians, according to figures from the territory's Hamas-run health ministry that the United Nations considers reliable.Prince Turki, also a former Saudi ambassador to the US, said Trump's \"strong mandate\" from American voters \"can enable him to provide the statesmanship that is highly needed in the world.\"Friendly countries in the region are hoping that Mr. Trump pursues what he started before, to bring peace with capital letters to the Middle East,\" he said.\"It is time for America, under your presidency, to change the course of this troubled region,\" he added.During Trump's first administration, the UAE, Bahrain and Morocco signed the Abraham Accords recognising Israel, a break with the long-held Arab consensus that there should be no ties without the creation of a Palestinian

Korea descends into political chaos, its equity market risks falling further behind major tech rival Taiwan, which is basking in the glory of the global artificial intelligence boom.A near 30% surge in Taiwan’s stock benchmark this year, set to be the best since 2009, has already helped spur a historic divergence between Asia’s two tech-dominated markets. The island’s market capitalization now exceeds South Korea’s by about $950 billion as the world’s AI frontrunners from Nvidia Corp. and Microsoft Corp. to OpenAI all increasingly turn to Taiwanese firms for supply.Looking ahead to next year, while both export-oriented economies face the risk of higher tariffs by incoming US President Donald Trump, many investors see Taiwan as less vulnerable given the reliance of American firms on its technology as well as its relatively better economic prospects.Such optimism, and a recent pickup in inflows into local stocks, also augur well for the Taiwanese dollar, which has fared better than the Korean won in 2024.“The structural theme of AI is likely to only get extended further, and this means we could see another year of Taiwan outperformance,” said Charu Chanana, chief investment strategist at Saxo Markets in Singapore. “The Korea discount may linger for longer given the recent political debacle, and the corporate governance reforms will have to be prioritized to get any closer to erasing this discount.”South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol is fighting for his political life after his attempt to break an impasse in parliament by briefly imposing martial law backfired. The turmoil has cast a pall over the nation’s outlook and it also may impact the Corporate Value-Up program much touted by Yoon as a way to boost shareholder returns and eradicate the so-called Korea Discount, a term referring to the long depressed valuations of the country’s equities.Down more than 8% this year, the Kospi is one of the world’s worst-performing major equity indexes. Its underperformance versus Taiwan’s Taiex has deepened further this month.TSMC rulesTaiwan’s equity-market outperformance has a lot to do with this year’s 80% surge in the shares of Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co., the world’s top advanced chipmaker that accounts for 37% of the benchmark’s weighting. The company is the major supplier of Nvidia and Apple Inc.’s most advanced chips.In contrast, shares of Samsung Electronics Co. — South Korea’s most-valued company — have been the biggest drag on its local market. Samsung’s stock has slumped 31% in Seoul this year on concerns that the firm is missing out on the AI boom due to slow progress on technological breakthroughs and lingering management woes.Overall, Taiwan’s exposure to AI goes far beyond TSMC: over 40 AI-related firms constitute about 73% of MSCI Taiwan’s index weighting, according to Goldman Sachs Group analysts. At 33%, Korea is a distant second in Asia and features SK Hynix Inc. and Samsung Electronics only.Analysts’ average earnings per share estimate for MSCI Taiwan has risen more than 33% this year to a record high, while that for MSCI Korea has declined 5% since a peak in August, Bloomberg compiled data shows. “If you think of Nvidia’s AI server market and so on, Taiwan is heavily involved in that value chain,” said Yan Taw Boon, portfolio manager at Neuberger Berman. “Conversely, Korea has not performed as strongly as they have very little involvement in this new booming environment.”Trump tariffs While the higher tariffs threatened by Trump are a universal challenge, there are reasons some investors believe that Taiwan’s treatment may be more nuanced and less punishing.“One will recall that many Taiwanese exports were exempt from tariffs last time around as they were key components of US tech supply chains,” JPMorgan Chase & Co. analysts including Rajiv Batra wrote in a note. “This time is likely to be the same with TSMC seen as a major part of the Global AI trade.”The Wall Street bank sees Taiwan relatively better positioned than Korea in a trade war with the US.Another buffer for Taiwanese equities is the growing presence of local investors, especially when the global investment climate turns more capricious. “Taiwan retail investors’ home bias and the still interesting AI ramp-up theme should continue to drive participation in the stock market,” said Vivian Pai, fund manager at Fidelity International. Their increased awareness of long-term investing can help form strong consistent inflows into local stocks, she added.The Taiwan dollar has weakened about 5% against the US currency this year while the Korean won has fallen around 9%.“Both Taiwan and Korea are exposed to tariffs but Taiwan’s underlying economic fundamentals are more solid,” said Eddie Cheung, a strategist at Credit Agricole CIB. “This should persist in 2025.”","url":"https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/trillion-dollar-gap-in-taiwan-korea-stock-fortunes/articleshow/116090706.cms","image":"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/resizemode-4,width-1280,height-720,msid-116090685/116090685.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-12-07 23:30:47","author":"Bloomberg","authors":["Bloomberg"],"language":"en","source_country":"in","sentiment":-0.446},{"id":271342060,"title":"Trump is welcomed by Macron to Paris with presidential pomp and joined by Zelenskyy for their talks","text":"PARIS (AP) — French President Emmanuel Macron welcomed Donald Trump to Paris on Saturday with a full dose of presidential pomp as the two held a hastily arranged meeting with Ukraine’s Volodymyr Zelenskyy before celebrating the grand reopening of the Notre Dame Cathedral.\n\nOn a day that mixed pageantry with attention to pressing global problems, the once and future American president was warmly embraced by Macron upon arriving at the Elysee Palace.\n\n“It’s a great honor for French people to welcome you five years later,” Macron told Trump. “Welcome back again.”\n\nTrump said it was a “very great honor” to be there, while hinting at challenges ahead.\n\n“It certainly seems like the world is going a little crazy right now. And we’ll be talking about that,” Trump said.\n\nAn actual red carpet was rolled out for Trump as Macron bestowed the kind of full diplomatic welcome that France offers sitting American presidents, complete with trumpets blaring and members of the Republican Guard in full uniform. It was a clear sign that even though Trump doesn’t take office until Jan. 20, 2025, Macron and other European leaders are already working to win his favor and treating him as America’s representative on the world stage.\n\nPresident Joe Biden declined an invitation to attend the Notre Dame ceremony, five years after a devastating fire, with the White House citing a scheduling conflict. First lady Jill Biden was the official U.S. representative in his place.\n\nMacron and leaders across Europe are trying to persuade the president-elect to maintain support for Ukraine in its defense against Russia’s invasion. Macron’s office said the war, along with conflicts in the Mideast, would be discussed.\n\nAs Trump arrived at the official residence of the French president, Macron went out of his way to project an image of close ties, offering handshakes and plenty of back-patting for the cameras.\n\nIn a video posted later on X, Macron could be heard asking Trump: “You remember?” as both men entered a reception room.\n\n“I remember,” Trump answered.\n\nTrump spent about 90 minutes inside, meeting first with Macron before they were joined by Zelenskyy for about 35 minutes.\n\nMacron had long planned to meet separately with Zelenskyy. The French president’s office said the three-way talks were proposed by Macron and arranged shortly before Trump’s arrival. Trump has pledged to end the war in Ukraine swiftly but has not specified how, raising concerns in Kyiv about what terms may be laid out for any future negotiations.\n\nA person familiar with Trump’s plans had said before the meeting was announced that while Trump and Zelenskyy were attending the cathedral ceremony and surrounding events and probably would interact, Trump’s transition team had not worked with the Ukrainians to schedule formal talks.\n\nAfter the place meeting, a Trump senior transition official did not push back on the idea that it had come together at the last minute, but said it had been “discussed fully and agreed to” and that Trump had been “fully briefed” ahead of time.\n\nThe three leaders spoke in English, and translator was in the room, according to a French official.\n\nAccompanying Trump to Paris was a small contingent of advisers that included incoming chief of staff Susie Wiles, along with Steve Witkoff, a longtime friend and real estate investor whom Trump has tapped as his special envoy to the Middle East, and Massad Boulos, who is the father-in-law of Trump’s daughter Tiffany and will serve as senior adviser on Arab and Middle Eastern affairs.\n\nThe group did not appear to include anyone with expertise on Ukraine.\n\n“United States, Ukraine and France. Together on this historic day. United for Notre-Dame. Let’s continue to work together for peace and security,” Macron wrote on X afterward.\n\nTrump’s victory last month threw into doubt the Biden administration’s flow of money and arms to Ukraine — aid bolstered even more on Saturday by U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin’s announcement of a $988 million package that brings American military support to more than $62 billion since Russia’s invasion in February 2022.\n\nTrump has characterized Zelenskyy as “the greatest salesman on Earth” for winning billions in U.S. aid. Trump also has said he work out a peace deal between Russia and Ukraine within a day of taking office and has promoted his good relationship with Russian President Vladimir Putin.\n\nIn an effort to build trust with the incoming U.S. administration, Zelenskyy’s top aide Andriy Yermak met key members of Trump’s team on a two-day trip to the U.S. earlier this week.\n\nMacron has argued that Ukraine’s defeat or a cease-fire with Russia on unfavorable terms to Ukraine would be viewed as a loss for the U.S. and even Trump himself, according to two European officials familiar with the matter.\n\nAfter arriving at Notre Dame for the ceremony, Trump was greeted by Macron and his wife, Brigitte. He was given prime seating at the service right between them — a better location than Jill Biden, who sat on Brigitte Macron’s other side — and many current heads of government and state.\n\nInside, Trump also greeted Zelenskyy as well as Britain’s Prince William, who Trump met with later at the British ambassador’s residence in Paris. Trump was greeted in the foyer, shook the royal’s hand and said “good man, this one.”\n\nTrump told reporters the Prince of Wales was doing “a fantastic job” before the two went to sit down and talk in a private room reserved for high-profile figures in the residence that once was the Paris town home of Princess Pauline Borghese, the youngest sister French Emperor Napoleon Bonaparte.\n\nPrince William was also scheduled to meet separately with Jill Biden, according to the British royal palace.\n\nElon Musk, the billionaire CEO of Tesla and X who has spent considerable time with Trump since the election and spent millions to elect him, was also in attendance at Notre Dame.\n\nMacron, who has had an up-and-down relationship with Trump, has made a point of cultivating their bond since the Republican defeated Democrat Kamala Harris. But Macron’s office nonetheless played down the significance of the invitation, saying other politicians not now in office had been invited as well.\n\nTrump was invited as president-elect of a “friendly nation,” Macron’s office said, adding, “This is in no way exceptional, we’ve done it before.”\n\nTrump is known to revel in pomp and circumstance. One of his first trips as president his first term was to Paris, where Macron made him the the guest of honor at Bastille Day events. Trump later said he wanted to replicate the grand military parade back in the United States.\n\nRelations between France and the U.S. during Trump’s first term began warmly enough but grew increasingly strained over time.\n\nMacron was the guest of honor at Trump’s first state dinner, and Trump traveled to France several times. But the relationship suffered after Macron criticized Trump for questioning the need for NATO and raising doubts about America’s commitment to the mutual defense pact.\n\nDuring the 2024 presidential campaign, Trump often mocked Macron, imitating his accent and threatening to impose steep tariffs on wine and champagne bottles shipped to the U.S. if France tried to tax American companies.\n\nBut Macron was one of the first global leaders to congratulate Trump last month after the election.\n\nWhen he accepted the invitation to travel to Paris, Trump said Macron had done “a wonderful job ensuring that Notre Dame has been restored to its full level of glory, and even more so. It will be a very special day for all!” Trump was president in 2019, when a fire nearly destroyed the 861-year-old landmark.\n\nGomez Licon reported from Fort Lauderdale, Florida, and Colvin from New York.

Nuk janë realiste. Ato duhet ta lejojnë industrinë të marrë frymë”, thotë analistja Beatrix Keim nga Qendra për Hulumtim të Industrisë Automobilistike.\n\nKthimi i Presidentit të zgjedhur amerikan Donald Trump në Shtëpinë e Bardhë dhe kërcënimet e tij se do të vendosë tarifa ndaj makinave të importuara po shqetëson prodhuesit gjermanë.\n\nPor ‘Volkswagen’, krahas kompanive ‘Mercedes’ dhe ‘BMW’, kanë fabrika prodhimi në Shtetet e Bashkuara dhe kompanitë shpresojnë që ky fakt do të forcojë pozicionin e tyre në negociatat me administratën e re amerikane.\n\n“Industria gjermane e automobilave është shumë aktive në tregun amerikan. Duke patur këtë parasysh, mendoj që tarifat mund të jenë joproduktive si masë”, thotë përfaqësuesi i konglomeratit ‘VDA’, që përfaqëson markat më të rëndësishme gjermane të veturave.\n\nProblemet në kompaninë Volkswagen janë vetëm njëra nga simptomat e një krize më të gjerë që ka shpërthyer në skenën politike gjermane.

Rusia po e shton trysninë. Rusia ka armë më të sofistikuara, krahasuar edhe me gjysmë viti [më parë]. Ushtarët ukrainas janë të lodhur sepse disa kanë shërbyer për më shumë se dy vite e gjysmë, por vazhdojnë të mos i lejojnë rusët të çajnë pozicionet ukrainase.\n\nPër momentin, nuk duhet të mendojmë për operacione sulmuese, por [se si] të forcojmë fortifikimet. E vlerësoj vendimin e qeverisë së Shteteve të Bashkuara për të na dhënë mina kundër këmbësorisë. Të kesh tre, katër, pesë kilometra fushë të minuar është një përgjigje e shkëlqyer ndaj taktikës së re të Rusisë, e cila po depërton në pozicionet ukrainase me grupe të vogla prej pesë deri në 12 personash, me mbështetjen e artilerisë ruse, e cila ka një numër të pakufizuar predhash artilerie.\n\nNëse kemi fortifikime, fusha të minuara dhe dronë zbulimi, përfshirë dronët që veprojnë natën dhe [një] numër të pakufizuar dronësh FPV për t’i shkatërruar këto grupe të vogla, [një] sistem efektiv të luftës radio-elektronike, përfshirë paisjet kundër dronëve zbulues rusë, kam besim se mund t’i mbajmë vijat e mbrojtjes.\n\nZëri i Amerikës: Ukraina është nën trysni për të filluar negociatat. A është kjo një kohë e mirë për këtë?\n\nPetro Poroshenko: Asnjë vend tjetër në botë nuk dëshiron paqe më shumë se ukrainasit, sepse ne po paguajmë një çmim të madh. Megjithatë, negociatat duhet të fillojnë kur të dyja palët të jenë gati. Të gjithë pyesin nëse Ukraina është gati, dhe askush nuk pyet nëse Putini është gati për këto negociata. Putini nuk është gati. Ne duhet të bëjmë përpjekje të mëdha për ta përgatitur Putinin për këto negociata. Çfarë gjuhe duhet të flasim me Putinin? Gjuhën e forcës, përfshirë armë të sofistikuara dhe moderne për Ukrainën. Putini duhet të ndjejë se po paguan një çmim të lartë. Kemi nevojë për sanksione më të forta për të shkatërruar flotën në hije. Sanksionet duhet të ulin eksportet ruse nga 600 [miliardë] dollarë në 200 miliardë dollarë për të ulur aftësinë e Putinit për të financuar luftën.\n\nZëri i Amerikës: A mendoni se administrata e re e Trump do të mbështesë vizionin tuaj?\n\nPetro Poroshenko: Unë besoj fuqishëm në udhëheqjen globale të Shteteve të Bashkuara. Kam punuar me [Presidentin Donald] Trump në vitet 2016-2019. Takimi me të ishte një nga takimet e mia të para si president i Ukrainës. Takimi ynë ishte planifikuar për pesë minuta - vetëm për të shtrënguar duart dhe për të bërë një foto - dhe zgjati dy orë e gjysmë. Si rezultat, ai i dha Ukrainës armët e para vdekjeprurëse pas tre viteve të luftës, [raketat antitank] legjendaret Javelin. Ato shpëtuan shumë jetë në rajonin e Donbasit. Edhe pa konsultime shtesë me partnerët tanë evropianë, ne ramë dakord që Shtetet e Bashkuara të vendosnin sanksione ndaj kontraktorit të kompanisë për tubacionin Nord Stream 2, gjë që ishte jetike. Në prani të Presidentit Trump, ne diskutuam me [ish-drejtorin e tij të CIA-s, Mike] Pompeo për koordinimin e përpjekjeve për të njohur kishën e pavarur të Ukrainës. Trump-i është një person i rezultateve, jo i procesit. Ai është mjaftueshëm i vendosur, për të marrë vendime të vështira.\n\nZëri i Amerikës: Presidenti i zgjedhur Trump emëroi gjeneralin Keith Kellogg si përfaqësuesin special amerikan për Ukrainën dhe Rusinë. Çfarë mendoni për të dhe idetë e tij?\n\nPetro Poroshenko: E kam takuar disa herë kur ishte anëtar i ekipit të Nënpresidentit [Mike] Pence. E mirëpres qasjen e Presidentit Trump për të emëruar një të dërguar special presidencial për Ukrainën. Kur Presidenti Trump emëroi Kurt Volkerin [si përfaqësues special të Shteteve të Bashkuara për negociatat për Ukrainën], kjo ishte jashtëzakonisht efikase. Dhe tani, niveli i profesionalizmit të gjeneralit Kellogg na jep një optimizëm të kujdesshëm.\n\nNe mund ta ndalim luftën në 24 orë, siç premtoi Presidenti Trump, dhe pa asnjë të shtënë, apo ndonjë dollar të shpenzuar. Na duhet vetëm një nënshkrim për një traktat - Traktati i Uashingtonit [traktati i prillit 1949 që themelon Aleancën e Traktatit të Atlantikut të Veriut]. Ftesa për Ukrainën për t'u anëtarësuar në NATO do të ishte një demonstrim i fuqishëm për Putinin se ne nuk kemi frikë nga shantazhi i tij. Ne jemi mjaftueshëm të vendosur dhe duam të kemi siguri të qëndrueshme në kontinent.\n\nUnë propozoj planin tim - \"Planin Poroshenko\". Brenda një viti, partnerët garantojnë se Ukraina do të marrë një anëtarësim të plotë [në NATO] nëse plotëson kritere specifike dhe plotëson disa kushte. Gjatë atij viti, ndërkohë që nuk jemi në NATO, do të marrim të njëjtat garanci sigurie si Finlanda dhe Suedia përpara anëtarësimit të tyre të plotë në NATO. Gjatë atij viti, unë sugjeroj gjithashtu që të ketë paqeruajtës me mandatin e Këshillit të Sigurimit të Kombeve të Bashkuara, për të garantuar një armëpushim. Kështu mund të ndalet lufta në 24 orë./ VOA","url":"https://www.cna.al/kosova-bota/ish-presidenti-ukrainas-poroshenko-lufta-mund-te-ndalet-brenda-24-or-i417373","image":"https://media.cna.al/cna.al/media3/-1200-630-eba7f1f3db715f1bd1533acdd3e27d4e.png","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-12-07 23:23:47","author":null,"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"al","sentiment":-0.644}]}
