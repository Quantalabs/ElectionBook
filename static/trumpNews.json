{"offset":0,"number":50,"available":16475,"news":[{"id":385423664,"title":"Trump Hails Mexico, Canada Cooperation at World Cup Draw","text":"President Donald Trump praised cooperation between the US, Canada and Mexico at Friday’s World Cup draw, even as divisions over North American trade and immigration policy threaten to overshadow next year’s global soccer tournament hosted by the three neighboring countries.“We’ve worked closely with those two countries, and the coordination and friendship and relationship has been outstanding,” Trump told attendees. “I think you’re going to have an event the likes of which maybe the world has never seen.”Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum and Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney also attended the draw at the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts in Washington, and the trio appeared on stage to conduct the draw. They were expected to meet privately with Trump briefly on Friday, and the US leader told reporters before the event he planned to raise trade and immigration in the talks.Trump was largely laudatory of his fellow leaders, despite in recent weeks criticizing Canada over its opposition to his tariff regime and Mexico over immigration and counternarcotics policies.“We’ve had a tremendous relationship,” Trump said.The glitzy showcase assigns matchups of participating countries to be played in host cities in all three countries. While teams will learn what opponents they’ll face in the first round on Friday, FIFA will announce on Saturday where the games will take place. The event doubled as another chance for Trump to put his mark on the tournament, as international governing body FIFA has gone to lengths to curry favor with the president. Trump was given a speaking slot in order to receive a newly created FIFA peace prize, awarded to the president after he lost out on his coveted Nobel Peace Prize. Trump called it “truly one of the great honors of my life.”Even some of the musical acts selected to perform at the draw — Andrea Bocelli and the Village People — are Trump favorites. The World Cup promises to draw vast numbers of spectators and international fans to North America, and organizers have said they expect windfalls for the 16 host cities, 11 of which are in the US.“Nobody’s ever sold as many tickets, and you’re still a long way from that ball being kicked down the field,” Trump said.Yet organizers’ plans to roll out the welcome mat for fans around the world have run headlong into the Trump administration’s immigration crackdown, which has featured high-profile raids conducted by masked agents, restrictions on travel to the US and heated rhetoric against migrants.Trump’s team has expressed confidence that steps including an expedited visa process for fans will ease concerns about coming to the US. But critics have said that the administration’s actions and message on immigration have already shattered the spirit of global unity the World Cup is supposed to embody.The US in June restricted entry for travelers from 19 countries, and this week moved to further tighten immigration curbs after the shooting of two National Guard members by an Afghan national. Trump has also threatened to move World Cup games out of the Boston area if he thought the Democrat-run city was unsafe, though told reporters on Friday he did not want to do so and believed he could address any issues. The games are being held in the suburb of Foxborough.While the event will require close coordination among the three host countries, Trump is battling with Canada and Mexico over trade, immigration and national security. The president has openly mused about launching strikes on drug cartels in Mexico and turning Canada into the 51st US state. Most recently, he’s threatened to pull out of the North American trade pact he negotiated during his first term.Trump’s PresenceThe president has been heavily involved in planning and promotion for the upcoming tournament, frequently hosting FIFA President Gianni Infantino at the White House. The organization opened an office in Trump Tower in June.Trump stood up a World Cup task force to handle the logistical and security challenges surrounding the premier showcase for international soccer, and made himself the chair. Andrew Giuliani, son of Trump ally Rudy Giuliani, serves as the panel’s executive director.Forty-two of the 48 qualifying countries have been finalized for the World Cup, and playoffs in March will determine the final six berths. During the draw, FIFA is dividing the 42 teams and six placeholders into 12 pots of four teams each. The US, as a host nation, is gaining a significant advantage as the first seed in its pot, as are the other two hosts, Canada and Mexico. The other nine top seeds are the top-ranked nations in the world: Spain, Argentina, France, England, Brazil, Portugal, Belgium, Germany and the Netherlands.The US men’s national team, ranked 14th in the world, has never won a World Cup. Its best-ever finish was a third-place result at the first tournament in 1930. The US women’s national team, by contrast, is the most successful in history with four World Cup wins. Sports PlatformThe draw at the Kennedy Center came months after Trump ousted the cultural hub’s bipartisan leadership over criticism of what he called “woke” programming and installed allies in their place — as well as himself as board chair.The event was co-hosted by comedian Kevin Hart, supermodel and television personality Heidi Klum and actor and producer Danny Ramirez. It featured live performances by musicians including Robbie Williams and Nicole Scherzinger, as well as the other acts.The president has frequently used sports as a platform to promote his own profile and policies. He attended the 2025 Club World Cup final and stood on stage for the trophy ceremony with the winners. Trump invited Portuguese star Cristiano Ronaldo to a gala dinner with Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, and hosted Italian powerhouse club Juventus at the White House earlier this year.Trump has also appeared at the Super Bowl, Ryder Cup, Daytona 500, US Open Tennis Championships, as well as multiple UFC fights, a New York Yankees game and the NCAA wrestling championships.©2025 Bloomberg L.P.This article was generated from an automated news agency feed without modifications to text.","url":"https://www.livemint.com/news/us-news/trump-hails-mexico-canada-cooperation-at-world-cup-draw-11764959533190.html","image":"https://www.livemint.com/lm-img/img/2024/12/06/1600x900/logo/news4_1733464472752_1733464484649.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-06 18:32:12","author":"List.metadata.agency","authors":["List.metadata.agency"],"language":"en","category":"sports","source_country":"in","sentiment":0.345},{"id":385491596,"title":"Libra-Don offers encouragement with Don’t Lose Faith","text":"Latest News\n\nInternational News\n\nNorth & East\n\nEnvironment\n\nSocial Love\n\nHorse Racing\n\nWorld Champs\n\nCommonwealth Games\n\nFIFA World Cup 2022\n\nEntertainment\n\nArt & Culture\n\nTuesday Style\n\nFood Awards\n\nJOL Takes Style Out\n\nDesign Week JA\n\nBlack Friday\n\nRelationships\n\nClassifieds\n\nMotor Vehicles\n\nPlace an Ad\n\nJobs & Careers\n\nStudy Centre\n\nJnr Study Centre\n\nAdvertorial\n\nSupplements\n\n\n\nLatest News\n\nInternational News\n\nNorth & East\n\nEnvironment\n\nSocial Love\n\nHorse Racing\n\nWorld Champs\n\nCommonwealth Games\n\nFIFA World Cup 2022\n\nEntertainment\n\nArt & Culture\n\nTuesday Style\n\nFood Awards\n\nJOL Takes Style Out\n\nDesign Week JA\n\nBlack Friday\n\nRelationships\n\nClassifieds\n\nMotor Vehicles\n\nPlace an Ad\n\nJobs & Careers\n\nStudy Centre\n\nJnr Study Centre\n\nAdvertorial\n\nSupplements\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInternational News\n\nFood Awards\n\nEntertainment\n\nWorld Champs\n\nCareer & Education\n\nEnvironment\n\nAdvertorial\n\nSupplements\n\nClassifieds\n\nDesign Week\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLibra-Don \n\n Entertainment, Latest News \n\nBY KEVIN JACKSON Observer Writer \n December 5, 2025\n\n\n\n\n Libra-Don offers encouragement with Don’t Lose Faith \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDancehall artiste Libra-Don is offering encouragement to people who have been affected by the passage of Hurricane Melissa, with his latest single Don’t Lose Faith.\n\nThe song, produced by Maddmoni Empire, was released on November 4.\n\n“Without a doubt Hurricane Melissa is one of the most devastating hurricanes that has ever hit Jamaica and has caused so much damage and pain, thousands of people have lost their homes, and some didn’t survive. It’s going to take time and a lot of work to rebuild Jamaica, but we can do it if we all unite and work for the greater good of the country,” Libra-Don told Observer Online on Friday.\n\n“Despite all the devastation caused by the hurricane I believe that Jamaica will bounce back and enter a new era of growth and prosperity. We are strong and resilient people and although it might sound cliche we will rise again.”\n\nLibra-Don said he wrote the song after watching news reports about Melissa’s devastating impact on Jamaica.\n\n“Don’t Lose Faith was written in the midst of fear, uncertainty, and a quiet desperation to hold on to hope as Hurricane Melissa raged on. I recorded a rough demo in my home studio, using that moment’s raw emotion to capture the essence before it could fade. Once the vision was clear, the entire process from creation to production took about five days,” he said.\n\nThe Connecticut-based deejay is also playing his part in the recovery process.\n\n“My family is originally from Jamaica, and we have relatives in various parts of Westmoreland including Belmont, White House, Bluefields and Grange Hill. So, shortly after the hurricane we sent several barrels of supplies for my relatives and other community members in those areas. Me and my management team MaddMoni Empire plan to do as much as we can, in assisting with the recovery process,” said Libra-Don.\n\nLibra-Don, given name Devon Maddan Jr, was born in the United States to Jamaican parents. He launched his recording in 2022 with the release of a song titled Honest.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTags: Don’t Lose Faith Hurricane Melissa Libra-Don \n\n\n\n\n\n\n {\"jamaica-observer\":\"Jamaica Observer\"} \n\n\n\n\n\n0 Comments · Make a comment\n\n\n\n\n ALSO ON JAMAICA OBSERVER\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLatest News, News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Market Bag: Hot pepper price heats up to $5k, sweet pepper cools to $600 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDecember 5, 2025 \n\n\n KINGSTON, Jamaica – This week at the Coronation Market in downtown Kingston sees Scotch bonnet prices continue to surge, with some vendors selling the... \n\n\n\n\n {\"jamaica-observer\":\"Jamaica Observer\"} \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLatest News, News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Jarrett urges stronger support for children as Jamaica rebuilds after Hurricane Melissa \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDecember 5, 2025 \n\n\n KINGSTON, Jamaica — Chief executive officer (CEO) and deputy chair of The Jamaica National Group, Earl Jarrett stressed that the positive return on in... \n\n\n\n\n {\"jamaica-observer\":\"Jamaica Observer\"} \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLatest News, News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Senate pays tribute to late consul-general to New York \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDecember 5, 2025 \n\n\n KINGSTON, Jamaica — Members of the Senate paid tribute to the late Consul-General of Jamaica to New York, Alsion Roach Wilson, during the sitting of t... \n\n\n\n\n {\"jamaica-observer\":\"Jamaica Observer\"} \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment, Latest News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Why Jimmy Cliff did little acting after iconic big screen debut? \n\n\n\n\n Howard CampbellObserver senior writer \n\n\n\nDecember 5, 2025 \n\n\n Observer Online presents the fifth story in ‘Jimmy Cliff: Stories Of A Bongo Man’, in tribute to the reggae legend who died on November 24 at age 81. ... \n\n\n\n\n {\"jamaica-observer\":\"Jamaica Observer\"} \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLatest News, News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n NHT introduces more flexible verification measures for Hurricane Melissa relief \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDecember 5, 2025 \n\n\n KINGSTON, Jamaica — The National Housing Trust (NHT) has expanded the range of documents it will accept to verify identity and property ownership for ... \n\n\n\n\n {\"jamaica-observer\":\"Jamaica Observer\"} \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLatest News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Forex: $161.07 to one US dollar \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDecember 5, 2025 \n\n\n KINGSTON, Jamaica — The United States (US) dollar on Friday, December 5, ended trading at $161.07, down by 13 cents, according to the Bank of Jamaica’... \n\n\n\n\n {\"jamaica-observer\":\"Jamaica Observer\"} \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInternational News, Latest News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Trump wins FIFA’s new peace prize \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDecember 5, 2025 \n\n\n WASHINGTON, United States (AFP)—US President Donald Trump became the first ever recipient of FIFA's new peace prize at the 2026 World Cup draw Friday ... \n\n\n\n\n {\"jamaica-observer\":\"Jamaica Observer\"} \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHOUSE RULES\n\n\n\nWe welcome reader comments on the top stories of the day.

The late educator’s philosophy, emphasising play-based learning and the creative use of low-cost materials, continues to shape teaching methods today.\n\nJarrett highlighted Grant’s “trashables to teachables” approach, his partnerships with the business community and academia, and his influence on policy and international practice.\n\n“He was like an apostle who gathered like-minded persons around him,” he said. “He was a true father of the movement.”\n\nThe colloquium saw participants exploring strategies to strengthen early childhood systems across the region. Topics include the development of an effective early childhood policy, the impact of technology on young minds, and ways to build resilience in the sector.\n\n“The outcome of these discussions should help to reaffirm or reframe thoughts and attitudes toward our young children,” Jarrett said.\n\n“Providing an enduring early childhood educational framework will lay the foundation for building a strong literate and caring society.”\n\nHe said as Jamaica faces one of its most challenging periods in recent history, the protection and preparation of young children who are the present value of the future wealth of a nation, must remain at the heart of national recovery.\n\n“Jamaica will need the necessary human capacity for the next 30 years,” he stressed. “We must begin by safeguarding the youngest among us today.”\n\nMeanwhile, Minister of Education, Skills, Youth and Information, Senator Dr Dana Morris Dixon, urged early childhood educators and sector partners to adopt a culture of preparedness and resilience, stressing that the lessons from Hurricane Melissa must reshape how Jamaica protects its youngest learners.\n\nSenator Morris Dixon revealed that the ministry is working closely with the Office of Disaster Preparedness Emergency Management (ODPEM) and partners to develop updated emergency preparedness guidelines tailored specifically for early childhood institutions.\n\n“We’re going to have to prepare better than we did,” she said. “There were so many schools that I’ve been to, and we had just put in computer labs, all the computers were wet, damaged, and destroyed. Even how we prepare for hurricanes or any disaster is really very important.”\n\nShe announced that the ministry is exploring changes to teacher- training programmes to integrate disaster risk reduction content, including making crisis management a compulsory course for pre-service teachers.\n\nThe minister stressed that preparedness should not be confined to annual workshops or drills.\n\n“We need to live and breathe preparedness… It must become a way of thinking and operating,” she emphasised.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTags: children Hurricane Melissa maternal health \n\n\n\n\n\n\n {\"jamaica-observer\":\"Jamaica Observer\"} \n\n\n\n\n\n0 Comments · Make a comment\n\n\n\n\n ALSO ON JAMAICA OBSERVER\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLatest News, News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Senate pays tribute to late consul-general to New York \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDecember 5, 2025 \n\n\n KINGSTON, Jamaica — Members of the Senate paid tribute to the late Consul-General of Jamaica to New York, Alsion Roach Wilson, during the sitting of t... \n\n\n\n\n {\"jamaica-observer\":\"Jamaica Observer\"} \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment, Latest News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Why Jimmy Cliff did little acting after iconic big screen debut? \n\n\n\n\n Howard CampbellObserver senior writer \n\n\n\nDecember 5, 2025 \n\n\n Observer Online presents the fifth story in ‘Jimmy Cliff: Stories Of A Bongo Man’, in tribute to the reggae legend who died on November 24 at age 81. ... \n\n\n\n\n {\"jamaica-observer\":\"Jamaica Observer\"} \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLatest News, News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n NHT introduces more flexible verification measures for Hurricane Melissa relief \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDecember 5, 2025 \n\n\n KINGSTON, Jamaica — The National Housing Trust (NHT) has expanded the range of documents it will accept to verify identity and property ownership for ... \n\n\n\n\n {\"jamaica-observer\":\"Jamaica Observer\"} \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLatest News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Forex: $161.07 to one US dollar \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDecember 5, 2025 \n\n\n KINGSTON, Jamaica — The United States (US) dollar on Friday, December 5, ended trading at $161.07, down by 13 cents, according to the Bank of Jamaica’... \n\n\n\n\n {\"jamaica-observer\":\"Jamaica Observer\"} \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInternational News, Latest News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Trump wins FIFA’s new peace prize \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDecember 5, 2025 \n\n\n WASHINGTON, United States (AFP)—US President Donald Trump became the first ever recipient of FIFA's new peace prize at the 2026 World Cup draw Friday ... \n\n\n\n\n {\"jamaica-observer\":\"Jamaica Observer\"} \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLatest News, News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 10 gift ideas for a post-Melissa Christmas \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDecember 5, 2025 \n\n\n Christmas is a time for giving and, with so many individuals losing all their possessions in Hurricane Melissa, the smallest of gifts can be so meanin... \n\n\n\n\n {\"jamaica-observer\":\"Jamaica Observer\"} \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLatest News, News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Man freed of indecent assault charges in St Catherine Parish Court \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDecember 5, 2025 \n\n\n ST CATHERINE, Jamaica — A 39-year-old steel worker was on Thursday acquitted of two counts of indecent assault following a trial in the St Catherine P... \n\n\n\n\n {\"jamaica-observer\":\"Jamaica Observer\"} \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHOUSE RULES\n\n\n\nWe welcome reader comments on the top stories of the day.

She was laid to rest on December 5 at the Community Baptist Church in Englewood, New Jersey.\n\nLeading the tributes, President of the Senate, Tom Tavares-Finson, said the late Consul General did a remarkable job in representing the country and the Jamaican community in New York.\n\n“A cursory glance at her achievements suggests that she was somebody who was closely engaged with the Jamaican community and was able to direct resources from New York into Jamaica,” he said.\n\n“During COVID, for example, she managed to raise [over US$150,000] for tablets and laptops for the kids and recently after Beryl, I think she was in a position to raise over $600,000,” he said.\n\nFor his part, Minister of Industry, Investment and Commerce, Senator Aubyn Hill said Wilson redefined the scope and impact of Jamaica’s diplomatic presence in New York and across the 33 states under her jurisdiction.\n\nHe said her tenure was marked by visionary leadership, dynamic partnership, and an unwavering commitment to nation-building and diaspora empowerment.\n\nA consummate connector, he said Consul General Wilson forged powerful institutional partnerships with leading entities such as Hartford HealthCare, University of the West Indies, Borough of Manhattan Community College, Monroe University, Alpha School of Music, and others.\n\nConsul General Wilson’s relaunch of the Jamaica Independence Gala stands as a hallmark of her tenure, transforming it into a premier New York celebration of national pride and philanthropy.\n\nThrough her foresight, warmth, and relentless dedication, Consul General Wilson has elevated the image of Jamaica abroad, bridging hearts, building partnerships, and transforming goodwill into tangible national building impact.\n\nOpposition Senator, Maziki Thame, recognised Wilson for giving of herself in service to advance the lives of Jamaicans.\n\nConsul General Wilson was recently conferred with the Order of Distinction in the rank of Commander by the Government of Jamaica.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTags: Alsion Roach Wilson New York Upper House \n\n\n\n\n\n\n {\"jamaica-observer\":\"Jamaica Observer\"} \n\n\n\n\n\n0 Comments · Make a comment\n\n\n\n\n ALSO ON JAMAICA OBSERVER\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment, Latest News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Why Jimmy Cliff did little acting after iconic big screen debut?

He was 81. \n\n Entertainment, Latest News \n\nHoward CampbellObserver senior writer \n December 5, 2025\n\n\n\n\n Why Jimmy Cliff did little acting after iconic big screen debut? \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nObserver Online presents the fifth story in ‘Jimmy Cliff: Stories Of A Bongo Man’, in tribute to the reggae legend who died on November 24 at age 81. This seven-part series looks at different aspects of the singer-songwriter’s life.\n\nThe Harder They Come defined Jimmy Cliff’s career. His starring role as Ivan made that 1972 movie, directed by Perry Henzell, a classic and earned him lasting international fame.\n\nOn the other hand, Club Paradise, a 1986 comedy in which he co-starred with Robin Williams, has been widely panned and is considered an embarrassment.\n\nMany wondered how Cliff — who died on November 24 at age 81 — never did more acting after his stunning debut in The Harder They Come. His cousin, filmmaker Lennie Little-White, said the answer is simple.\n\n“I know he refused a lot of offers…either because he did not want to be stereotyped only doing roles like The Harder They Come or the money was not right,” Little-White told Observer Online.\n\nDuring the 1970s, Cliff released several critically-acclaimed albums and toured the world. He was always identified with Henzell’s movie about a country boy who travels to Kingston looking for a break in the music business.\n\nIt would not be until 1986 that he returned to the silver screen, as Ernest Reed, a musician who lives on the fictional Caribbean island, Saint Nicholas. He is befriended by Jack Moniker (played by Williams), an American, and they open a club on the island.\n\nClub Paradise was directed and written by Harold Ramis, who was riding high as one of the stars in Ghostbusters, a mega hit in 1984. He assembled a strong cast that included Peter O’Toole, 1960s hit girl Twiggy, Rick Moranis, Eugene Levy and Adolph Caesar.\n\nWith a production budget of US$19 million, Club Paradise held high expectations, but it made only US$12.3 million at the box office. The reviews were brutal.\n\n“Ramis’s cast includes a convention of Second City (television comedy) graduates: Eugene Levy, Brian Doyle-Murray, Joe Flaherty, Mary Gross and Bill Curry.They have their moments, especially Levy as an uncle who has brought his nephew along to the island and teaches him the fine points of lechery and voyeurism. But the movie never really comes together, and I think the fault for that begins with Williams. When the star of a movie seems desperate enough to depend on one-liners, can the rest of the cast be blamed for losing confidence in the script?” wrote respected critic Roger Ebert.\n\nLittle-White, writer-director of the 1980 movie Children Of Babylon, agrees.\n\n“I think Club Paradise had a weak script in the sense it was half comedy and half farce. It had a lot of brand-name actors, but the director could not make up his mind about where the greatest emphasis should be,” he said.\n\nFour years after Club Paradise, Cliff played himself in Marked For Death, a movie starring Steven Segal.

That movie, based on the Jamaican bobsleigh team to the 1988 Winter Olympics in Calgary, Canada, was an international smash. I Can See Clearly Now peaked at number 18 on the Billboard Hot 100, and went number one in France, Iceland and New Zealand.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTags: Jimmy Cliff Lennie Little-White Robin Williams Steven Segal The Harder They Come \n\n\n\n\n\n\n {\"jamaica-observer\":\"Jamaica Observer\"} \n\n\n\n\n\n0 Comments · Make a comment\n\n\n\n\n ALSO ON JAMAICA OBSERVER\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLatest News, News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n NHT introduces more flexible verification measures for Hurricane Melissa relief \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDecember 5, 2025 \n\n\n KINGSTON, Jamaica — The National Housing Trust (NHT) has expanded the range of documents it will accept to verify identity and property ownership for ... \n\n\n\n\n {\"jamaica-observer\":\"Jamaica Observer\"} \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLatest News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Forex: $161.07 to one US dollar \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDecember 5, 2025 \n\n\n KINGSTON, Jamaica — The United States (US) dollar on Friday, December 5, ended trading at $161.07, down by 13 cents, according to the Bank of Jamaica’... \n\n\n\n\n {\"jamaica-observer\":\"Jamaica Observer\"} \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInternational News, Latest News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Trump wins FIFA’s new peace prize \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDecember 5, 2025 \n\n\n WASHINGTON, United States (AFP)—US President Donald Trump became the first ever recipient of FIFA's new peace prize at the 2026 World Cup draw Friday ... \n\n\n\n\n {\"jamaica-observer\":\"Jamaica Observer\"} \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLatest News, News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 10 gift ideas for a post-Melissa Christmas \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDecember 5, 2025 \n\n\n Christmas is a time for giving and, with so many individuals losing all their possessions in Hurricane Melissa, the smallest of gifts can be so meanin... \n\n\n\n\n {\"jamaica-observer\":\"Jamaica Observer\"} \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLatest News, News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Man freed of indecent assault charges in St Catherine Parish Court \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDecember 5, 2025 \n\n\n ST CATHERINE, Jamaica — A 39-year-old steel worker was on Thursday acquitted of two counts of indecent assault following a trial in the St Catherine P... \n\n\n\n\n {\"jamaica-observer\":\"Jamaica Observer\"} \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLatest News, Sports \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Jamaica could face Ronaldo’s Portugal \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDecember 5, 2025 \n\n\n KINGSTON, Jamaica — Jamaica could face Portugal, one of the favourites to win the Fédération Internationale de Football Association (FIFA) senior men’... \n\n\n\n\n {\"jamaica-observer\":\"Jamaica Observer\"} \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment, Latest News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n CMU student finishes 3rd at Mr Teen Universe International \n\n\n\n\n BY KEVIN JACKSON Observer Writer \n\n\n\nDecember 5, 2025 \n\n\n Bradley Clarke, a 21-year-old final year Cruise Shipping & Marine Tourism student at the Caribbean Maritime University, finished in third place at the... \n\n\n\n\n {\"jamaica-observer\":\"Jamaica Observer\"} \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHOUSE RULES\n\n\n\nWe welcome reader comments on the top stories of the day.

Individuals who suffered damage may also file peril insurance claims.\n\nMeanwhile, Berbick advised that the NHT is in discussions with other government entities to facilitate access to replacement documents. He noted that agencies, such as the Electoral Office of Jamaica (EOJ), have already waived fees for ID card replacements.\n\nHe emphasised that NHT teams islandwide have been directed to apply this flexible framework when assisting contributors and mortgagors.\n\n“The aim is to ensure a smoother process and provide the most responsive support possible at this time,” he said.\n\nThe enhanced verification measures form part of the NHT’s ongoing commitment to supporting Jamaicans rebuilding after Hurricane Melissa.\n\nIndividuals are urged to visit the NHT’s website at www.nht.gov.jm/recover to access application resources and guidance on the disaster‑relief initiatives.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTags: Hurricane Melissa property ownership The National Housing Trust (NHT) \n\n\n\n\n\n\n {\"jamaica-observer\":\"Jamaica Observer\"} \n\n\n\n\n\n0 Comments · Make a comment\n\n\n\n\n ALSO ON JAMAICA OBSERVER\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLatest News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Forex: $161.07 to one US dollar \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDecember 5, 2025 \n\n\n KINGSTON, Jamaica — The United States (US) dollar on Friday, December 5, ended trading at $161.07, down by 13 cents, according to the Bank of Jamaica’... \n\n\n\n\n {\"jamaica-observer\":\"Jamaica Observer\"} \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInternational News, Latest News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Trump wins FIFA’s new peace prize \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDecember 5, 2025 \n\n\n WASHINGTON, United States (AFP)—US President Donald Trump became the first ever recipient of FIFA's new peace prize at the 2026 World Cup draw Friday ... \n\n\n\n\n {\"jamaica-observer\":\"Jamaica Observer\"} \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLatest News, News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 10 gift ideas for a post-Melissa Christmas \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDecember 5, 2025 \n\n\n Christmas is a time for giving and, with so many individuals losing all their possessions in Hurricane Melissa, the smallest of gifts can be so meanin... \n\n\n\n\n {\"jamaica-observer\":\"Jamaica Observer\"} \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLatest News, News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Man freed of indecent assault charges in St Catherine Parish Court \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDecember 5, 2025 \n\n\n ST CATHERINE, Jamaica — A 39-year-old steel worker was on Thursday acquitted of two counts of indecent assault following a trial in the St Catherine P... \n\n\n\n\n {\"jamaica-observer\":\"Jamaica Observer\"} \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLatest News, Sports \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Jamaica could face Ronaldo’s Portugal \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDecember 5, 2025 \n\n\n KINGSTON, Jamaica — Jamaica could face Portugal, one of the favourites to win the Fédération Internationale de Football Association (FIFA) senior men’... \n\n\n\n\n {\"jamaica-observer\":\"Jamaica Observer\"} \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment, Latest News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n CMU student finishes 3rd at Mr Teen Universe International \n\n\n\n\n BY KEVIN JACKSON Observer Writer \n\n\n\nDecember 5, 2025 \n\n\n Bradley Clarke, a 21-year-old final year Cruise Shipping & Marine Tourism student at the Caribbean Maritime University, finished in third place at the... \n\n\n\n\n {\"jamaica-observer\":\"Jamaica Observer\"} \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLatest News, Sports \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Herbert Morrison crush Muschett 108 – 2 in ISSA basketball \n\n\n\n\n PAUL A REID Observer writer reidp@jamaicaobserver.com \n\n\n\nDecember 5, 2025 \n\n\n MONTEGO BAY, St James -- Former champions Herbert Morrison Technical recorded a lopsided 108-2 win over Muschett High at the school's compound on Thur... \n\n\n\n\n {\"jamaica-observer\":\"Jamaica Observer\"} \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLatest News, Regional \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n IDB approves US$80-m in funding to prevent flooding in key areas of the Bahamas \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDecember 5, 2025 \n\n\n WASHINGTON, (CMC) – The Inter-American Development Bank (IDB) says it has approved an US$80 million loan to enhance the resilience and sustainability ... \n\n\n\n\n {\"jamaica-observer\":\"Jamaica Observer\"} \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHOUSE RULES\n\n\n\nWe welcome reader comments on the top stories of the day.

(Photo by SAUL LOEB / AFP) \n\n International News, Latest News \n\nDecember 5, 2025\n\n\n\n\n Trump wins FIFA’s new peace prize \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWASHINGTON, United States (AFP)—US President Donald Trump became the first ever recipient of FIFA’s new peace prize at the 2026 World Cup draw Friday — a compensation gift for a leader who still dreams of winning the Nobel.\n\nGianni Infantino, the head of world football’s governing body and a close ally of Trump, presented the 79-year-old with the award during the ceremony at the Kennedy Center in Washington.\n\n“Thank you very much. This is truly one of the great honors of my life. And beyond awards, Gianni and I were discussing this, we saved millions and millions of lives,” Trump said.\n\n“The world is a safer place now.”\n\nInfantino said Trump won for “exceptional and extraordinary” actions to promote peace and unity around the world and presented him with a golden trophy and a certificate.\n\n“There is also a beautiful medal for you that you can wear everywhere you want to go,” Infantino said.\n\nTrump immediately put it around his neck, saying: “I’m going to wear it right now.”\n\nFIFA announced the annual prize in November, saying it would recognize people who bring “hope for future generations.”\n\nBut its inaugural recipient was hardly a surprise.\n\nInfantino, 55, has developed a tight relationship with Trump, visiting the White House more than any world leader since Trump’s return to office in January.\n\nThe US president often insists that he deserves the Nobel Peace Prize for his role in ending what he says are eight conflicts this year. These include a fragile ceasefire in Gaza, although an end to Russia’s war in Ukraine eludes him.\n\nInfantino has traveled as far afield as Egypt and Malaysia to attend three ceremonies for Trump-brokered peace deals in recent months.\n\nTrump has put himself at the head of a “board of peace” for war-torn Gaza, while his administration this week renamed a Washington peace institute after him.\n\nBut Trump was overlooked by the Norwegian Nobel Committee last month as it awarded the peace prize to Venezuelan opposition leader Maria Corina Machado.\n\n– ‘Backdrop of violent detentions’ –\n\nThe US leader has meanwhile made the World Cup a centerpiece of his second presidency, and of the celebrations for the 250th anniversary of US independence next year.\n\nYet it was an extraordinary gesture for FIFA, a sporting organization that trumpets its political neutrality.\n\nThere has been little transparency around the prize. Human Rights Watch says it has written to FIFA to request a list of the nominees, the judges, the criteria and the selection process — and has received no response.\n\nThe prize came as Trump faces criticism from Democrats and rights groups on a host of issues.\n\nThe self-proclaimed “president of peace” has launched a huge US military build-up around Venezuela and ordered deadly airstrikes against alleged drug-smuggling boats.\n\nHe has also ordered a hardline migration crackdown, threatening to move World Cup games from cities where he has sent troops and freezing asylum decisions from 19 countries — including World Cup participants Haiti and Iran.\n\nAnd he has cracked down on political opponents, rival ideologies and those who challenge his false claim he won the 2020 election.\n\nThe venue for the draw, the Kennedy Center, was where Trump installed himself this year as chairman in what he called a war on “woke” culture.\n\n“FIFA’s so-called peace prize is being awarded against a backdrop of violent detentions of immigrants, national guard deployments in US cities, and the obsequious cancellation of FIFA’s own anti-racism and anti-discrimination campaigns,” Minky Worden, who oversees sport for Human Rights Watch, said in a statement.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTags: Donald Trump FIFA's new peace prize \n\n\n\n\n\n\n {\"jamaica-observer\":\"Jamaica Observer\"} \n\n\n\n\n\n0 Comments · Make a comment\n\n\n\n\n ALSO ON JAMAICA OBSERVER\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLatest News, News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 10 gift ideas for a post-Melissa Christmas \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDecember 5, 2025 \n\n\n Christmas is a time for giving and, with so many individuals losing all their possessions in Hurricane Melissa, the smallest of gifts can be so meanin... \n\n\n\n\n {\"jamaica-observer\":\"Jamaica Observer\"} \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLatest News, News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Man freed of indecent assault charges in St Catherine Parish Court \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDecember 5, 2025 \n\n\n ST CATHERINE, Jamaica — A 39-year-old steel worker was on Thursday acquitted of two counts of indecent assault following a trial in the St Catherine P... \n\n\n\n\n {\"jamaica-observer\":\"Jamaica Observer\"} \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLatest News, Sports \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Jamaica could face Ronaldo’s Portugal \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDecember 5, 2025 \n\n\n KINGSTON, Jamaica — Jamaica could face Portugal, one of the favourites to win the Fédération Internationale de Football Association (FIFA) senior men’... \n\n\n\n\n {\"jamaica-observer\":\"Jamaica Observer\"} \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment, Latest News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n CMU student finishes 3rd at Mr Teen Universe International \n\n\n\n\n BY KEVIN JACKSON Observer Writer \n\n\n\nDecember 5, 2025 \n\n\n Bradley Clarke, a 21-year-old final year Cruise Shipping & Marine Tourism student at the Caribbean Maritime University, finished in third place at the... \n\n\n\n\n {\"jamaica-observer\":\"Jamaica Observer\"} \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLatest News, Sports \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Herbert Morrison crush Muschett 108 – 2 in ISSA basketball \n\n\n\n\n PAUL A REID Observer writer reidp@jamaicaobserver.com \n\n\n\nDecember 5, 2025 \n\n\n MONTEGO BAY, St James -- Former champions Herbert Morrison Technical recorded a lopsided 108-2 win over Muschett High at the school's compound on Thur... \n\n\n\n\n {\"jamaica-observer\":\"Jamaica Observer\"} \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLatest News, Regional \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n IDB approves US$80-m in funding to prevent flooding in key areas of the Bahamas \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDecember 5, 2025 \n\n\n WASHINGTON, (CMC) – The Inter-American Development Bank (IDB) says it has approved an US$80 million loan to enhance the resilience and sustainability ... \n\n\n\n\n {\"jamaica-observer\":\"Jamaica Observer\"} \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLatest News, News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Romeich criticises corporate companies for ‘not holding strong’ and cancelling Christmas events \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDecember 5, 2025 \n\n\n KINGSTON, Jamaica—Event promoter and artiste manager Romeich Major is criticising corporate companies for \"not holding strong\" by postponing Christmas... \n\n\n\n\n {\"jamaica-observer\":\"Jamaica Observer\"} \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHOUSE RULES\n\n\n\nWe welcome reader comments on the top stories of the day.

But the San Jose native and U.S. national team legend gave it her best shot Friday morning, in a sports bar outside Chase Center.\n\nChastain, now 57, gathered with a handful of other local sports figures and a hundred or so soccer fans at a watch party for the 2026 World Cup draw, where onlookers learned the group-stage assignments for the 48 countries participating in the tournament, which comes to Levi’s Stadium in June.\n\n“Yes! Let’s go USA!” Chastain exclaimed from her perch on the second floor surrounded by more Bay Area soccer royalty, Chris Wondolowski and Leslie Osborne.\n\nThe source of her excitement was the slip of paper that Shaquille O’Neal was unfurling ahead on a panel of television screens, signifying arguably the most-favorable draw for the Americans. The toughest competition the U.S. will have to overcome to advance to the knockout round — and a potential match in Santa Clara — are the Australians.\n\nRanked 26th in the world by FIFA, Australia was considered to be the worst team of the 12 potential opponents in Pot 2. The U.S., ranked 14th by FIFA, was automatically seeded from Pot 1, comprised of the three host countries and the next top-nine teams, into Group D. The Americans will also face 39th-ranked Paraguay and the winner of a March qualifying tournament between Türkiye, Romania, Slovakia and Kosovo.\n\n“You never know how it’s going to go, what you think is a favorable draw may not be,” said Wondolowski, the former San Jose Earthquakes star who suited up for the USMNT during the 2014 World Cup. “But I think, as of today, it was a favorable draw.”\n\nIf the U.S. wins its group, it would advance to play a win-or-go home match in the Round of 32 on July 1 at Levi’s Stadium. Before then, the home of the 49ers will also host five group-stage matches from June 13-26 — but the full scope of which teams will visit the Bay Area won’t be revealed until Saturday morning, when FIFA announces the schedule (set for 9 a.m.).\n\nFor now, Friday’s draw provided enough information to suggest that Switzerland will be the highest-profile team to play locally. Other potential visitors include the three non-U.S. teams in Group D, as well as Jordan, Qatar, Austria and Algeria. There is a chance Lionel Messi and Argentina could be assigned to play in the Bay Area, but it would deviate from FIFA’s past scheduling patterns.\n\n“I think I’m as excited about who’s coming here as I am about who (is) in the U.S.’s bracket, because I want the U.S. to win their bracket so that they can come here,” Chastain said, noting that two in five U.S. women’s national team players have come from or through the Bay Area. “So our community is one that understands this game. It understands the players. It has historically supported big matches like this.”\n\nThe scheduling uncertainty is another new twist in a tournament that expanded to 48 teams for the first time. FIFA has typically announced when and where the games will take place when teams are drawn into their groups, rather than 24 hours later.\n\nThat information didn’t matter so much to Marcelio Ramos, who intends to travel wherever Brazil ends up. The Brazilian-born Berkeley resident donned a Batman mask, draped the national flag over his back like a cape and beat a snare drum in the plaza outside the arena Friday morning.\n\n“I’m the only one who dressed up,” Ramos said, surveying the sparse crowd that seemed to be more focused on keeping warm outside on a chilly December morning. He had more company in 1994, when he was one of the thousands of Brazilians who flocked to the Bay Area the last time it hosted World Cup matches.\n\nThose games featured the U.S., Brazil, Russia and Cameroon and took place in front of sellout crowds at Stanford Stadium. Wondolowski, who was 10 at the time, remembers attending Brazil’s practices at Santa Clara University and called the tournament “a catalyst in my love for the game.” He has friends in Los Gatos, where the Brazilians were based, who more than three decades later still vividly recall a “Carnaval-like mentality” taking over the town.\n\n“What happened to Los Gatos in 1994, it was literally taken over by Brazil,” said Chastain, who by then had begun her international career but returned to her alma mater to catch Ronaldo on the practice field. “The people who didn’t even know anything about soccer, all of a sudden, they became lifelong fans.”\n\nThe international flair also comes with a new wrinkle in this year’s tournament: the influence of President Donald Trump, who helped bring the draw to the nation’s capital and delivered remarks at the event, though he served only as background footage to San Francisco Mayor Daniel Lurie’s opportunistically timed drop-in to the Bay Area festivities.\n\nIn Washington, D.C., O’Neal, Aaron Judge and Tom Brady joined Trump and FIFA president Gianni Infantino on stage at the Kennedy Center for a proceeding that took nearly two hours, included the presentation of the inaugural “Peace Prize” and was bookended by musical performances from Andrea Bocelli and the Village People.\n\nTrump has made denigrating comments toward multiple countries in the tournament, and Iran threatened to boycott the draw before switching course a day in advance. The president’s presence reminded Chastain of one of her last international experiences, at the 2004 Olympics in Athens. The U.S. players were cordoned off and instructed not to interact with any players from Iran, when all of a sudden Chastain came across one Irani in the courtyard.\n\n“Of course, in my head, I’m going, ‘What do I do? What do I do?'” Chastain remembered. “Then I said, ‘Brandi, what you do is you act the same way as you would just engaging anybody on the street. … Even though we’re competitors, we’re also humans.\n\n“We will bring people from around the world together. We will have some differences amongst us, but sitting next to each other and sharing a hello and the game, we know that it cures a lot of things,” Chastain continued. “So I think this is a great time to host a World Cup.”\n\nChastain, a co-owner of Bay FC, the professional women’s team that just completed its second season, is hopeful the U.S. can take advantage of playing on its home soil to inspire the next generation of players. While the American women have dominated on the international stage, the men have failed to make it out of the group stage three times in seven tournaments since 1994, including a failure to even qualify in 2018.\n\nThe good news is that the docket appears less daunting than the “Group of Death” that Wondolowski faced in 2014, when the Americans surprised by finishing second to Germany in a group that also included Ghana and Cristiano Ronaldo’s Portugal. The distinction this year goes to Group C, which is home to Canada and Switzerland and is likely to also include Italy pending the results of one of the FIFA qualifiers in March.\n\nSo, any predictions?\n\n“Uh, USA?” Wondolowski said, letting out a hearty laugh. “Is it wrong to say anything else?

They were unarmed, incommunicado, and adrift as they repeatedly attempted to right what remained of their boat. At one point, the men raised their arms and seemed to signal to the U.S. aircraft above, a gesture some who watched a video of the incident interpreted as a sign of surrender. Then a second explosion finished the men off, leaving only a bloody stain on the surface of the sea. Footage of the two men’s desperate final moments made some viewers nauseated, leading one to nearly vomit. “It was worse than we had been led to believe,” one person told us.\n\nThe video was part of a briefing that Admiral Frank “Mitch” Bradley, the head of U.S. Special Operations Command, gave lawmakers yesterday about the September 2 attack. Bradley told legislators that, after consulting military lawyers, he authorized the follow-on strike, judging that the men still posed a threat because of what they could have done: radioed for help or been picked up with what remained of their cargo of suspected cocaine. The video suggested they didn’t actually do any of that, but Bradley defended his decisions in the first episode of the Trump administration’s newly militarized counternarcotics campaign.\n\nRepublicans and Democrats who watched the grainy footage drew different conclusions about whether Bradley’s actions were justified. But many also sounded exasperated that once again they were dealing with controversy sparked by Bradley’s boss, Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth. And after 10 months of turbulence under Hegseth’s leadership, the Republican-led Congress is now showing signs of exercising its oversight powers.\n\nHegseth has denied reports that he issued a verbal “no quarter” order—that is, an order to kill, not capture—in the September 2 attack, an assertion backed by Bradley. Hegseth also defended Bradley’s decision to launch a second strike—while insisting he wasn’t a part of it. But the congressional scrutiny is likely to continue, deepening the former Fox News host’s reliance on the one person responsible for his political rise: President Donald Trump.\n\nSo far, Trump continues to profess support. But he, too, is starting to tire of the scandals surrounding Hegseth and does not push back when others suggest Hegseth is not up for the job, an outside adviser to the White House and a former senior administration official told us. Trump has not been happy that a number of Republicans on Capitol Hill are using Hegseth’s record as a reason to stand up to the White House, a further sign of cracks in what had until recently been unwavering GOP fealty to Trump. Senator Thom Tillis of North Carolina publicly rejected Hegseth’s claim that he had been “exonerated” in Signalgate, and Senate Majority Leader John Thune of South Dakota declined, when asked, to offer his endorsement of Hegseth’s performance.\n\nAs one senior administration official summed it up: “Rough week for Pete.”\n\nSince taking office, Hegseth has had few defenders in internal White House deliberations, even as Trump has backed him publicly. But the past week has been rocky even by Hegsethian standards, a point that was made clear in our interviews with roughly two dozen people in recent days.\n\nIn 10 months on the job, Hegseth has proved himself one of the president’s most loyal aides. A pugilistic former National Guardsman turned TV star, Hegseth narrowly secured confirmation in January after a nomination process marred by allegations of heavy drinking and sexual assault, which he denied. He and Trump had grown close during Trump’s first term, when Hegseth defended military officers accused of war crimes. “He’ll really fight for me,” Trump told one outside adviser at the time.\n\nHegseth has generated widespread concern over his judgment and lack of restraint. His leadership has been defined by the summary firing of senior officers without cause, upheaval among his top advisers, giving his wife an outsize role in Pentagon affairs, juvenile social-media habits, and his obsession with military fitness and appearance. At the Pentagon these days, more and more there are two kinds of personnel—those fully on board with Hegseth and those afraid to say they are not. “It’s easier to stay out of the way than to be questioned about loyalty or willingness to do the job,” one defense official, who is in the latter camp, told us.\n\nThe maritime campaign, called “Operation Southern Spear,” is ostensibly aimed at curbing the flow of drugs from Venezuela to the United States, though the rationale is viewed by many as a thin veneer for Trump’s professed desire for the ouster of President Nicolás Maduro. The boat strikes, now totaling 22 with a death toll of more than 80, are viewed by many military-law experts as likely illegal. On Tuesday, the family of a Colombian man killed in a September 15 strike filed a complaint at the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights, alleging that Hegseth violated international law. The Pentagon declined to provide a comment but pointed to the chief department spokesperson’s denial that the September 2 strike ran afoul of proper military tactics and his assertion that the maritime operations “have been a resounding success.”\n\nThroughout this debate, Hegseth has used social media to taunt critics, posting videos of boats being incinerated and promising to kill traffickers en masse. This week, he posted on X a doctored cover of a Franklin the Turtle children’s book, with a mock Franklin Targets Narco Terrorists illustration that shows Franklin hanging from a military helicopter, weapon in hand.\n\nAlso this week, the Pentagon’s inspector general released long-awaited findings of its investigation into Hegseth’s decision to post details of a pending strike on Houthi rebels in Yemen in a group chat on Signal, a commercial messaging app, that included the editor in chief of this magazine. (Mike Waltz, then the national security adviser, had inadvertently added Jeffrey Goldberg to the group.) The inspector general concluded that Hegseth could have put U.S. personnel and the mission at risk by his actions, even though the mission was completed. The report also found that Hegseth, as the Pentagon’s senior official, had the authority to declassify the sensitive information as he transmitted it—in effect declassifying it in his own head—but noted that the attack details had been classified when they were relayed to him by U.S. Central Command. The report also faulted Hegseth for violating his own department’s policies by using Signal for Pentagon business.\n\nAs Hegseth was busy attempting to declare exoneration from a report that clearly suggested otherwise, he was sued by The New York Times over his October decision to bar reporters from working inside the Pentagon unless they agreed to restrictions that could prevent reporters from publishing information not approved by the administration, conditions that journalists and First Amendment lawyers broadly agree represent an ostentatious attack on Americans’ basic constitutional protections.\n\nIt’s not as though Hegseth was widely adored until this week. He alienated many in Trump’s orbit all the way back in the presidential transition, when they believed he was being misleading about parts of his professional and personal history that later came to light in the media and in his contentious confirmation hearings. Susie Wiles, now the president’s chief of staff, groused to aides that she could never tell if Hegseth was telling the truth.\n\nWhen Signalgate broke, in March, Trump called a number of his close allies to take their temperature on whether he should dismiss Hegseth. Some suggested he be fired but Trump opted against it. He and his inner circle wanted to avoid the constant staff turnover of Trump’s first term. They have largely stuck to that \"no scalps\" policy so as not to give the Democrats a win—or the media a major story—by appearing to bow to pressure. (Waltz lost his post as national security adviser but was given a soft landing as ambassador to the United Nations). Hegseth never regained the trust of some in the West Wing.\n\nIn the past week, Trump has been far more focused on immigration—a crackdown on migrants from Afghanistan after the shooting of two National Guard members and the dangers Trump claims Somalis pose in Minnesota—than the controversies around Hegseth, one of the outside advisers and a White House official told us. But some have begun to urge the president, whose poll numbers are slumping, to do a staff shakeup after hitting the one-year mark next month, which could include firing Hegseth. Others point to the need to protect the president from Hegseth.\n\n“At the end of the day, people may forget who Pete Hegseth is,” Tillis told CNN. “People will not forget who Donald Trump is. And when they make decisions that are below the standards that I think President Trump wants, I’m going to hold them accountable because I care about his legacy.”\n\nMany other Republicans believe the Pentagon is operating decently enough. After Admiral Bradley’s briefing, senior Republican lawmakers indicated they would continue their oversight around the strikes and Hegseth's conduct. Some Republican members who attended the briefings appeared moved by the footage of the two survivors being killed, but have so far remained silent. Hegseth has had his defenders, too: GOP Senator Tom Cotton of Arkansas came out in favor of the military’s judgment after Bradley’s appearance, saying the admiral had made the right combat call.\n\nBesides, Trump can’t afford to lose a secretary of defense and wade into another confirmation battle with Congress, the senior administration official told us. “The people around the president have always sensed that Hegseth isn't really qualified for the job,” this person added. “But he’s redeemed himself in the eyes of the president because he is truly devoted to Trump. That goes a long way.” Karoline Leavitt, White House press secretary, released a statement of support for Hegseth over the Signalgate report’s findings.\n\n“Taking Pete, with all his baggage, is just how it’s gonna be,” the official added.\n\nPowerful GOP senators can’t agree on what to consider the Pentagon’s biggest problem. Senators Cotton and Dan Sullivan of Alaska have voiced unhappiness with the Pentagon’s policy unit and what they say is its failure to consult with Congress. Mitch McConnell of Kentucky is dissatisfied by what he sees as an inadequate military budget. Roger Wicker of Mississippi, the chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, has complained about potential troop reductions in Europe and surprised others on Capitol HIll when he teamed up with the committee’s top Democrat to demand the Bradley briefing.\n\n“There isn’t a clear through line yet,” one Republican staff member told us. “We’re not yet in a scenario where a Republican senator is going to call the president and ask him to fire Hegseth.”\n\nStill, “the pressure is building,” one Republican told us, because of the unpredictability of Hegseth’s leadership and the potential for policy or political victories to be overshadowed by Pentagon drama. Many Republicans have been reflecting on their initial reluctance to confirm Hegseth, though they set aside those concerns at the time after White House pressure. One Democratic lawmaker told us that a fissure in GOP solidarity had appeared midweek, although for now the White House seems to have tamped it down.\n\nHegseth and his closest allies, meanwhile, are projecting confidence and concentrating on his audience of one in the White House. “Hegseth is doing what he believes Trump wants—to be unapologetic, to push back and push forward,” one person close to Hegseth told us yesterday. This person dismissed reports of softening Republican support on Capitol Hill and insisted Hegseth is secure in his job, adding, “People are scared of Pete.”","summary":"Lawmakers are finally waking up to the problems the defense secretary has created.","url":"https://www.theatlantic.com/national-security/2025/12/pete-hegseth-strikes-venezuela-congress/685156/","image":"https://cdn.theatlantic.com/thumbor/kCDNDFZzMrz9bM5A4T-QYCiHLNc=/0x0:4000x2250/720x405/media/img/mt/2025/12/2025_12_05_Hegseth_Very_Bad_Week/original.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-06 00:43:00","author":"Jonathan Lemire,Missy Ryan,Sarah Fitzpatrick,Vivian Salama","authors":["Jonathan Lemire","Missy Ryan","Sarah Fitzpatrick","Vivian Salama"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.667},{"id":385487210,"title":"What I learned spending a month chasing Poilievre","text":"Over the course of April, I followed Poilievre’s campaign, reporting from across six provinces and over a dozen cities.

That's the way it works.\"\n\nHe pressed an attorney for the government for any evidence that state authorities were either unable or unwilling to help keep federal personnel and property in the area safe and noted President Donald Trump had access to tens of thousands of active duty troops in California.\n\nCalifornia officials have asked Breyer to issue a preliminary injunction returning control of remaining California National Guard troops in Los Angeles to the state. Breyer did not immediately rule. He has previously found the administration's deployment of the California National Guard illegal.\n\n\"The National Guard is not the president's traveling private army to deploy where he wants, when he wants, for as long as he wants, for any reason he wants, or no reason at all,\" California Attorney General Rob Bonta said after the hearing.\n\nTrump initially called up more than 4,000 California National Guard troops in response to the protests over his stepped-up enforcement of immigration laws, but that number had dropped to several hundred by late October, with only a 100 or so troops remaining in the Los Angeles area.\n\nThe Republican president, however, has also tried to use California Guard members in Portland, Oregon, and Chicago, as part of his effort to send the military into Democratic-run cities despite fierce resistance from mayors and governors.\n\nRELATED: National Guard deployment in LA cost nearly $120 million, Newsom says\n\nJustice Department Attorney Eric Hamilton said federal law gives the president the power to extend control of state Guard troops as long as he deems that necessary.\n\nThe remaining troops in Los Angeles were allowing immigration agents to continue their mission and protecting federal property, he said, noting someone threw two incendiary devices into a federal building on Monday.\n\nThe court did not have the authority to review how the president manages a Guard mission that is in progress, but even if it could, it had to consider the violence this summer, Hamilton said.\n\n\"We cannot turn a blind eye to what happened in Los Angeles in June of this year,\" he said.\n\nTrump's call up of the California National Guard was the first time in decades that a state's national guard was activated without a request from its governor and marked a significant escalation in the administration's efforts to carry out its mass deportation policy. They were stationed outside a federal detention center downtown where protesters gathered, and later sent on the streets to protect immigration officers as they made arrests.\n\nCalifornia sued, and Breyer issued a temporary restraining order that required the administration to return control of the Guard troops to California. An appeals court panel, however, put that decision on hold. Breyer was nominated to the bench by President Bill Clinton, a Democrat.\n\nCalifornia argued that the president was using Guard members in violation of a law limiting the use of the military in domestic affairs.\n\nThe administration said courts could not second-guess the president's decision that violence during the protests made it impossible for him to execute U.S. laws with regular forces and reflected a rebellion, or danger of rebellion.\n\nIn September, Breyer ruled after a trial that the deployment violated the law. Other judges have blocked the administration from deploying National Guard troops to Portland, Oregon, and Chicago.\n\nThanawala reported from Atlanta.","summary":"At a hearing in San Francisco, U.S. District Judge Charles Breyer suggested conditions in Los Angeles had changed since the initial deployment, and he questioned whether the administration could control state Guard troops \"forever\" under its interpretation of federal law.","url":"https://abc7news.com/post/ca-national-guard-donald-trump-gavin-newsom-charles-breyer/18255520/","image":"https://cdn.abcotvs.com/dip/images/17503262_081125-kgo-ap-ca-national-guard-img.jpg?w=1600","video":"https://vcl.abcotv.net/video/kgo/120525-kgo-4p-ca-vs-trump-vid.mp4","publish_date":"2025-12-06 00:40:38","author":"The Associated Press","authors":["The Associated Press"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.274},{"id":385487646,"title":"AS dapat laluan mudah, Trump terima anugerah","text":"WASHINGTON: Amerika Syarikat (AS) diundi dalam kumpulan yang dianggap mudah bagi Piala Dunia 2026 - namun sebahagian penyokong merasakan 'tuah' itu bukan sekadar kebetulan.\n\nSkuad bimbingan Mauricio Pochettino bersama 47 negara lain mengetahui nasib masing-masing dalam majlis undian yang turut dihadiri Presiden Donald Trump, penerima Anugerah Keamanan FIFA yang pertama, di Kennedy Center.\n\nSebagai tuan rumah bersama Kanada dan Mexico, Amerika Syarikat menerima berita baik apabila diundi dalam Kumpulan D bersama Australia, Paraguay serta pemenang antara Turkiye, Romania, Slovakia atau Kosovo.\n\nSekilas pandang, undian itu memberi peluang besar kepada AS untuk mara ke pusingan kalah mati - sesuatu yang membuatkan peminat segera menuduh FIFA 'mengatur' keputusan undian bagi menguntungkan tuan rumah.\n\nAda yang mendakwa hubungan rapat Presiden FIFA Gianni Infantino dengan Trump - yang jelas ketika pengumuman Anugerah Keamanan - mempengaruhi proses undian.\n\n\"Bukan nak percaya teori konspirasi, tapi undian AS nampak terlalu mudah.

With the groups and matchups set, it's time to break down the biggest winners and losers from the glitzy event.\n\nGet the biggest stories from across the soccer world by visiting our Top Soccer News section and subscribing to push notifications.\n\nWinners - The hosts\n\nThe United States got Australia and Paraguay. Canada will face Switzerland and Qatar. In front of fervent home support, those should be winnable matches for both nations, especially since the U.S. defeated Australia and Paraguay in recent friendlies. However, both groups have open spots that'll be determined once the European playoffs are completed next March. The possible additions of Italy and Turkey, for example, could suddenly make each quartet look a lot tougher.\n\nPotential extra team: Italy (ranked 12th), Wales (32nd), Northern Ireland (69th), or Bosnia and Herzegovina (71st)\n\nPotential extra team: Turkey (ranked 25th), Slovakia (45th), Romania (47th), Kosovo (80th)\n\nYou could argue that Mexico is the biggest winner from the 2026 World Cup co-hosts. Securing first place in Group A offers a huge incentive, positioning Mexico in a favorable part of the knockout bracket with back-to-back games in Mexico City. The team enjoys its home comforts. Its best World Cup finishes (quarterfinals in 1970 and 1986) came when it hosted the tournament, and it can always call upon a mass of passionate fans when it plays in the United States.\n\nPotential extra team: Denmark (ranked 21st), Czechia (44th), Republic of Ireland (59th), North Macedonia (65th)\n\nAlthough Mexico was outplayed by South Korea in a 2-2 friendly draw in September, Taegeuk Warriors boss Hong Myung-bo has produced mixed results with his preferred 3-4-3 setup. El Tri can also take inspiration from its 2018 World Cup win over the East Asian nation. South Africa, meanwhile, shouldn't intimidate Mexico.\n\nLosers - Defenders in Group I\n\nErling Haaland and Kylian Mbappe have combined for 114 goals for club and country in 2025. Haaland-inspired Norway was irresistible in its World Cup qualification cycle, plundering a remarkable 37 goals while conceding just five in eight straight victories. France predictably eased through its group, with Mbappe scoring in each of his six appearances.\n\nSenegal and a yet-to-be-determined qualifier from Bolivia, Iraq, and Suriname face the unenviable task of trying to hinder Haaland's and Mbappe's pursuits of the World Cup Golden Boot. Expect defenders to attempt to turn their duels with the free-scoring forwards into gritty, physical affairs. One notable center-back potentially tasked with marking Haaland and Mbappe is former Napoli star Kalidou Koulibaly, who will turn 35 during the group stage and now plays for Saudi Arabia's Al-Hilal.\n\nWinner - Argentina\n\nLionel Messi's Argentina received a gift in Friday's draw. Though the team should easily brush aside Austria, Algeria, and Jordan, head coach Lionel Scaloni will undoubtedly use La Albiceleste's 2-1 reverse to Saudi Arabia in 2022 - one of the most surprising results in World Cup history - as a warning to his star-studded team. \n\nOf course, Argentina followed that Saudi shock with a victorious run at the World Cup, beating France on penalties in the final after a 3-3 thriller.\n\nScaloni's side impressively breezed through South America's notoriously tricky World Cup qualifiers, outscoring all of its rivals as it finished with a nine-point cushion in first place. Argentina celebrated a resounding 4-1 win over its great rival, Brazil, on the same day it secured World Cup qualification in March.\n\nLosers - England and Croatia\n\nPanama and Ghana are ranked 30th and 72nd in FIFA's rankings. Croatia and England must've had no issues being drawn alongside that pair in Group L - but facing one another is a different matter entirely.\n\nEngland and Croatia locking horns on the first day of Group L means there's no time to mull over last-minute selection decisions or tactical fine-tuning. Any lingering questions will need to be resolved before facing such high-quality opposition; otherwise, flaws will inevitably be exposed, and the pressure will skyrocket before the other group games. That means England boss Thomas Tuchel has only four friendlies to solve numerous conundrums, including determining who will start in his four-man defense and whether there's room for either or both of Jude Bellingham and Phil Foden in his lineup.\n\nThe Three Lions should enter this demanding group opener with the greatest trepidation. England has lost six of its last eight World Cup matches against fellow European nations, including its eliminations by Croatia in 2018 and France in 2022.\n\nWinner - Cristiano Ronaldo\n\nCristiano Ronaldo is on course to play at a record sixth World Cup, but he's also got an opportunity to rid himself of some painful memories from the last tournament.\n\nManchester United released Ronaldo from his contract two days before Portugal's opener at Qatar 2022 after his relationship with the club deteriorated. Ronaldo subsequently scored a penalty in a thrilling 3-2 win over Ghana, but his contributions to the team were soon questioned over the next two matches. He was quiet in a scrappy victory over Uruguay, and his underwhelming performance against South Korea was further marred when the ball deflected off his back, teeing up Kim Young-gwon for the equalizer in a disappointing 2-1 defeat for Portugal.\n\nFernando Santos bravely dropped Ronaldo for the knockout rounds, preferring greater mobility from Goncalo Ramos up front. The move paid off immediately, with Ramos scoring a hat-trick in a 6-1 thumping over Switzerland in the last 16. Portugal brought Ronaldo on as a substitute in the 50th minute in the quarterfinal, but he could muster only a single shot and 11 touches of the ball as Morocco eliminated the team in a 1-0 loss.\n\nUnlike his predecessor, Roberto Martinez doesn't seem inclined to drop Ronaldo, giving the legendary forward a chance at redemption in North America. Turning 41 at the tournament, Ronaldo could add to his tally of eight World Cup goals and secure Portugal's passage into the knockout rounds through Group K clashes with Colombia, Uzbekistan, and one playoff team from DR Congo, Jamaica, or New Caledonia.\n\nLoser - Gianni Infantino\n\nGianni Infantino clearly believes he's a showman. If you can somehow cloud out the shadier elements of his FIFA reign, there can be some cheap entertainment found in his antics at high-profile events.\n\nThe FIFA president's stilted attempt at a comedy routine with Rio Ferdinand, who struggled greatly in a presenter role at the Kennedy Center, inadvertently provided a level of cringe-humor befitting of the British version of \"The Office.\" Infantino seemed to appear onstage every few minutes to produce another grandiose yet ultimately empty speech, all while wearing a wide, self-satisfied grin. When he engineered a selfie with Donald Trump, Claudia Sheinbaum, and Mark Carney - the respective leaders of the United States, Mexico, and Canada - during the overblown ceremony, the voiceover of the BBC's coverage, Jonathan Pearce, almost sounded impressed as he remarked on the extent of Infantino's shamelessness.\n\nWinners - Nostalgia lovers\n\nAny writers fond of producing retrospective features won't be short of stories to explore ahead of the World Cup.\n\nFrance's opening fixture is against Senegal, a matchup that likely evokes painful memories for many French fans of the 2002 World Cup - a campaign plagued by infighting and wretched performances. That tournament opened with the reigning 1998 champions losing to Senegal and ultimately finishing at the bottom of its group.\n\nThe 2026 World Cup opener will see Mexico take on South Africa, a repeat of the first match of the 2010 edition. In Group C, Scotland will face Brazil and Morocco - two of the three teams it faced during its last World Cup appearance in 1998.\n\nLoser - Scotland\n\nSpeaking of which, Group C is underwhelming and problematic for Scotland. Many fans would've wanted some variety to celebrate their country's overdue return to sports' greatest stage, but they got Brazil and Morocco again. Not only does the pair remind Scottish supporters of the team's failings in 1998, it sets up games against the most successful squad in World Cup history - managed by Carlo Ancelotti, the most successful coach in Champions League history - and an emerging force in Morocco, which reached the 2022 World Cup semifinals and remains unbeaten in its last 20 outings, with 19 wins and one draw.\n\nAt least Haiti, ranked 84th in the world and making its first appearance at the tournament since 1974, offers Scotland a chance to win its first World Cup match in 36 years.\n\nWinner - Variety in Groups E and H\n\nOne of the most unique selling points of World Cups is the unfamiliar culture clashes, and Germany and Spain will enjoy some variety when they compete in North America.\n\nIn Group E, Germany will face Curacao for the first time, the Ivory Coast for the second time following a 2009 friendly in Gelsenkirchen, and Ecuador for the third time after their meetings at the 2006 World Cup and in a 2013 friendly.\n\nSpain and Uruguay will share some familiarity due to the La Liga-based players in the South American nation's squad, but the pair's Group H scuffle will be just their third World Cup meeting. Spain will also have its second World Cup match against Saudi Arabia and its first against Cape Verde.\n\nBonus winner - Andrea Bocelli\n\nIt's hard to imagine an instance where Italian tenor Andrea Bocelli wouldn't upstage any performer that followed him - but this event was especially easy in that regard. Opening the draw coverage by singing the iconic \"Nessun Dorma,\" Bocelli sang a bona fide soccer anthem - evoking memories of the 1990 World Cup and Leicester City's Premier League title win. At 67, Bocelli left no doubt that he's still one of the finest performers on the globe.\n\nAnd after the Michelin star dish of Bocelli, FIFA ladled out some sugary, sloppy servings. Robbie Williams, showbiz's equivalent of lumpy custard, teamed up with Nicole Scherzinger - remember her? - to sing the forgettable official World Cup song. Lauryn Hill plated up tinny, tatty versions of some of her old tunes. Once the draw was over, the Village People performed the diabetes-drawing ditty \"Y.M.C.A.\" President Donald Trump adopted the sickly-sweet 1978 pop song for his re-election campaign rallies.\n\nGet the biggest stories from across the soccer world by visiting our Top Soccer News section and subscribing to push notifications.","url":"https://www.thescore.com/topsn/news/3409537/biggest-winners-and-losers-from-2026-world-cup-draw","image":"https://assets-cms.thescore.com/uploads/image/file/812692/w768xh576_World_Cup_draw_analysis.jpg?ts=1764964988","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-06 00:30:24","author":"Daniel Rouse","authors":["Daniel Rouse"],"language":"en","source_country":"ca","sentiment":0.458},{"id":385491148,"title":"Netflix casts new spell to take over Warner Bros. Discovery in $83 billion deal","text":"Streamer Netflix’s acquisition of the iconic Hollywood Studio Warner Bros. Discovery (WBD) will add muscle and sinews to its content offering, but experts said locking cricket rights that will be up for grabs in 2027 might be a gamechanger on the Indian subcontinent.Netflix has agreed to acquire WBD in a landmark deal valuing the company at an enterprise value of $82.7 billion and an equity value of $72 billion, after WBD spins off its global television networks into a new listed entity, Discovery Global, giving the streaming giant control over one of Hollywood’s most well-known studios and creating a global entertainment behemoth.Once the spin-off is completed in the third quarter of 2026, Netflix will take over the Warner Bros. film and TV studios, along with HBO and streaming platform HBO Max. Netflix expects $2-$3 billion in annual cost savings by year three and says the deal will be accretive to GAAP earnings per share by year two. The transaction is targeted to close in 12-18 months.The deal has also drawn comparisons with Disney’s $71 billion acquisition of 21st Century Fox in 2019, with analysts noting that while the two transactions differ in scope, the Netflix–WBD combination moves Netflix closer to the studio scale Disney reached after the Fox merger.Analysts say it remains unclear how the deal would affect India, though some note that a larger consolidated content catalogue could shape future licensing decisions.A few industry observers cautiously add that the strengthened portfolio may, over time, prompt Netflix to reassess broader growth opportunities in the market, including whether to evaluate cricket rights when they come up for renewal in 2027, although there is no indication that the company is considering such a move at this stage. “The Netflix-WBD acquisition is a watershed moment for global streaming and its ripple effects in India will be profound. Content consolidation will bring HBO’s prestige series and WBD’s blockbuster franchises under Netflix, reducing fragmentation and creating Netflix a premium destination for global hits. Licensing disruption is inevitable as existing deals with other platforms expire, paving the way for Netflix exclusivity. This will drive industry to recalibrate their strategies, focusing on sports rights, regional originals and ad-supported models. Competitive pressures will intensify, driving innovation in pricing, bundling and localised storytelling. hThis deal definitely accelerates India’s OTT evolution towards a more consolidated and consumer-centric ecosystem,” said PwC India partner and leader for media and entertainment Rajesh Sethi.“This acquisition gives Netflix access to franchises it has historically lacked, reflecting a strategy similar to Disney’s past content acquisitions such as Marvel and Star Wars. The price is significant, and its impact in India may be limited because the audience for premium HBO content remains relatively narrow. In this market, meaningful scale is unlikely unless Netflix eventually pursues cricket,” said NV Capital managing partner Nitin MenonNetflix will pay $27.75 per WBD share, including $23.25 in cash and $4.50 in stock. The sale followed a competitive process involving Paramount Skydance and Comcast.Reuters reported that preliminary bids in November valued WBD at close to $24 per share for the full group in Paramount’s case, while Netflix and Comcast bid only for the studios and streaming assets. Netflix later raised its offer to about $28 per share for the restructured perimeter.WBD then enters exclusive talks with Netflix. Discovery Global will house CNN, Discovery, TNT Sports, free-to-air European channels and Discovery Plus, all of which remain outside the deal.Netflix says the acquisition will provide more choice and greater value by combining complementary strengths. Warner Bros.’ studios and HBO’s premium programming will deepen Netflix’s catalogue, and Netflix plans to preserve the studio’s existing operations, including theatrical releases. The combined slate is expected to boost engagement and revenue, expand Netflix’s production capacity and create more opportunities for creators.Netflix enters the deal in a position of financial strength.It reported about $39 billion in 2024 and has projected $45 billion in revenue in 2025, has a market capitalisation of about $437 billion and trades near $103 a share. Its gross debt is about $14.5 billion, and has cash and equivalents of $9.3 billion. WBD posted about $39 billion in revenue, has a market cap of around $60.8 billion, trades near $24.50 a share and carries gross debt of about $34.5 billion with $4.3 billion in cash, equivalents and restricted cash. Netflix co-CEO Ted Sarandos said the combined libraries would strengthen its mission to entertain the world, citing classics such as Casablanca, Citizen Kane, Harry Potter and Friends.“This acquisition brings together two pioneering entertainment businesses, combining Netflix’s innovation, global reach and best-in-class streaming service with Warner Bros.’ century-long legacy of world-class storytelling,” he noted.“This acquisition will improve our offering and accelerate our business for decades to come,” added Greg Peters, co-CEO of Netflix.WBD CEO David Zaslav said the merger would extend Warner Bros.’ century-long storytelling legacy. “By coming together with Netflix, we will ensure people everywhere will continue to enjoy the world’s most resonant stories for generations to come,” he said.The deal will face regulatory review in the United States and Europe.Analysts say the combination of two major streaming services could draw scrutiny. Some have suggested earlier that a Paramount Skydance bid for the entire WBD group might have had a smoother path because it did not merge two large global streamers.Netflix has about 302 million subscribers globally and HBO Max has about 128 million (including discovery+), giving the combined services roughly 430 million users.Larry Ellison, co-founder of Oracle, is a key financial backer of Paramount Skydance through his son David Ellison, who took control of Paramount after Skydance’s 2024 merger.Analysts said Ellison’s longstanding ties to Donald Trump and his political donations could have eased regulatory prospects, although there is no public indication of any official preference.The restructuring will affect WBD’s India operations. Linear TV channels will move to Discovery Global. WBD had delayed an HBO Max launch in India and instead licensed HBO and Warner Bros. content.HBO content exited Disney Hotstar in 2023 and moved to JioCinema, now part of the JioStar-led JioHotstar platform. JioStar pays $20 million per year for WBD content. Analysts expect HBO titles to return to Netflix once the multi-year deal ends.India is not expected to see a major immediate impact from the deal. Netflix has over 20 million subscribers in the market, but HBO and Warner Bros. titles alone are unlikely to shift the competitive landscape because cricket remains the key driver of streaming growth in India and is controlled by JioHotstar, not Netflix.While HBO series such as Game of Thrones, Succession and The Last of Us and Warner Bros. films like Oppenheimer and Barbie have strong followings, their return to Netflix will not materially alter market dynamics. Netflix could make a bid for cricket in India when it comes up for renewal in 2027.","summary":"Netflix is acquiring Warner Bros. Discovery in a massive deal. This move will bring popular HBO and Warner Bros. content to Netflix. Experts believe this could change the Indian streaming landscape. The biggest potential gamechanger is Netflix eyeing cricket rights in India when they become available in 2027.

We want to unite, and that’s what we do here today, and that’s what we want to do at the World Cup,” Infantino said as he presented the award.\n\n“Mr President, you definitely deserve the first FIFA Peace Prize for your action, for what you have obtained in your way, but you have obtained in an incredible way.”\n\nTrump has openly campaigned for the Nobel Peace Prize but missed out on the award earlier this year.\n\nHe said the new FIFA recognition is one of the “great honours” he has received, and he repeated his claim that his presidency has saved millions of lives and ended eight wars.\n\nThe US president’s remarks were brief, but he still could not help but take a shot at the record of his Democratic predecessor, Joe Biden.\n\n“The United States, one year ago, was not doing too well, and now I have to say we’re the hottest country anywhere in the world,” Trump said.\n\nA departure from past statements\n\nInfantino has previously warned against using football to stoke division. “There’s no more powerful tool than sport to unite the people,” he said in 2023. “Now we have to protect the autonomy of sport: the political neutrality of sport and to protect the values of sport.”\n\nTwo years later, critics point out that Infantino has created a prize to celebrate peace and unity, and then handed it to a president who called people from Somalia “garbage” just days prior.\n\n“Giving Donald Trump a prize for peace is like giving Luis Suarez a prize for not biting people’s ears off,” football journalist Zach Lowy wrote on social media, referring to the Uruguayan forward who has been caught up in at least three biting incidents on the pitch throughout his career.\n\nInfantino appears to have forged strong ties with Trump as the US prepares to co-host the World Cup with Mexico and Canada next year.\n\nThe FIFA president has been a regular guest at the White House, and in October, he attended a ceremony with Trump to formalise the Gaza truce in Egypt.\n\nFIFA did not respond to Al Jazeera’s request for comment by the time of publication.\n\nThe Democratic Party was among the critics taking aim at the new FIFA award. “Trump couldn’t win a Nobel Peace Prize so FIFA made one up for him,” it said in a social media post.\n\nBut rights advocates levelled more serious criticism at the US president, invoking his rights record and foreign policy.\n\nTrump’s record\n\nWhile Trump has helped broker some peace deals between warring parties, most recently between Rwanda and the Democratic Republic of the Congo, he has been an advocate for increased military spending across the Western world.\n\nTrump also ordered the bombing of Iran’s nuclear facilities in June, and he has continued to arm Israel despite its well-documented abuses against Palestinians.\n\nIn the Western Hemisphere, Trump’s administration has also carried out 22 air strikes against vessels that it says are carrying drugs, killing at least 86 people. Legal experts have widely condemned the attacks as unlawful acts of extrajudicial killing.\n\nMoreover, Trump has been amassing military assets near Venezuela, raising speculation that the US may go to war with the country to topple left-wing President Nicolas Maduro.\n\nAt home, Trump has intensified an anti-immigration crackdown that has led to the detention and attempted deportation of non-citizens. Some advocates have been targeted for their criticism of Israel, an act of free speech protected under the First Amendment of the Constitution.\n\n“US President Donald Trump was just awarded the newly created ‘FIFA Peace Prize,'” Human Rights Watch said on the social media platform X.\n\n“But his administration’s appalling human rights record certainly does not display ‘exceptional actions for peace and unity.'”\n\nFor his part, Mokhiber, the former UN official, said the “vulgar” prize to Trump must be rescinded.\n\n“FIFA rules do not allow play on a muddy pitch. They certainly shouldn’t play on a bloody pitch. But that’s precisely where Infantino is leading FIFA,” he said.","summary":"FIFA President Gianni Infantino heaps praise on Donald Trump as critics ridicule newly established award as &#039;vulgar&#039;.","url":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/12/6/infantinos-peace-prize-to-trump-raises-questions-about-fifas-neutrality?traffic_source=rss","image":"https://www.aljazeera.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/AP25339723845515-1764979008.jpg?resize=1200%2C675","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-06 00:29:48","author":"Ali Harb,Apps Support","authors":["Ali Harb","Apps Support"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"QA","sentiment":-0.076},{"id":385489326,"title":"US Supreme Court to decide legality of Trump's controversial policy on birthright citizenship: The case so far","text":"The United States Supreme Court agreed on Friday to decide the legality of US President Donald Trump's controversial policy to limit birthright citizenship in the country.The justices are expected to hear arguments during their current term and issue a ruling by the end of June, news agency Reuters reported. They did not set a date for the arguments.What's the case?The justices took up a Justice Department appeal of a lower court's ruling that blocked Trump's executive order on restricting birthright citizenship.The lower court had earlier ruled that Trump's policy violated the US Constitution's 14th Amendment and a federal law codifying birthright citizenship rights in a class-action lawsuit by parents and children whose citizenship is threatened by the directive, Reuters reported.What's the controversial birthright US citizenship policy?Trump's policy allowed US agencies not to recognise the citizenship of children born in the US if neither parent is an American citizen or legal permanent resident, also called a \"green card\" holder.Trump signed the order on his first day back in office on January 20 as part of a suite of initiatives he has pursued during his second term as president to crack down on legal and illegal immigration.Debate over 14th AmendmentAs per the report, the 14th Amendment has long been interpreted as guaranteeing citizenship for babies born in the US.The 14th Amendment's Citizenship Clause states that all \"persons born or naturalised in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the state wherein they reside.\"The 14th Amendment was ratified in 1868 in the aftermath of the Civil War of 1861-1865 that ended slavery in the United States.But, the Trump administration argued that the provision does not grant citizenship to the babies of immigrants who are in the country illegally or whose presence is lawful but temporary, such as university students or those on work visas.\"This case will have enormous consequences for the security of all Americans, and the sanctity of American citizenship. The Trump administration looks forward to making its case on the issue of birthright citizenship on behalf of the American people,\" White House spokesperson Abigail Jackson was quoted by Reuters as saying.\"No president can change the 14th Amendment's fundamental promise of citizenship,\" said Cecillia Wang, national legal director of the American Civil Liberties Union, which is representing the plaintiffs.The administration asserted that the phrase \"subject to the jurisdiction thereof\" means that being born in the United States is not enough for citizenship.Citizenship is granted only to the children of those whose \"primary allegiance\" is to the United States, including citizens and permanent residents, it has argued.Such allegiance is established only through \"lawful domicile,\" which government attorneys define as \"lawful, permanent residence within a nation, with intent to remain.\"The Trump administration said that granting citizenship to virtually anyone born on US soil has created incentives for illegal immigration and led to \"birth tourism,\" by which foreigners travel to the United States to give birth and secure citizenship for their children.What did the challengers say?The challengers said the Supreme Court already settled the question of birthright citizenship in an 1898 case called United States v. Wong Kim Ark, which long has been interpreted as guaranteeing that children born in the US to non-citizen parents are entitled to American citizenship under the 14th Amendment.The challengers also point out that Trump's order violates a law Congress passed in 1940 that was subsequently included in the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952. That measure codified the Citizenship Clause's language and also adopted what was by then the well-settled understanding that the 14th Amendment promised automatic birthright citizenship.The cases so farThe legal challenges appealed by the Justice Department concerned one lawsuit filed by the states of Washington, Arizona, Illinois and Oregon, and another filed in federal court in New Hampshire by plaintiffs who sued on behalf of a nationwide class of people affected by Trump's order.In July, the San Francisco-based 9th US Circuit Court of Appeals sided with the states. Also in July, Concord, New Hampshire-based US District Judge Joseph Laplante let the plaintiffs in that case proceed as a class, allowing Trump's order to be blocked nationally. The Supreme Court on Friday decided to hear the class action case only, not the one brought by the states.The Supreme Court took up the case before a Boston-based federal appeals court had a chance to review it, a signal of the gravity of the legal divide and the need for the Supreme Court to definitively settle the matter on a national basis.The birthright citizenship fight had landed at the Supreme Court already once this year. After lower courts halted Trump's order, the administration took the matter to the Supreme Court to challenge the power of federal judges to issue so-called \"universal\" injunctions preventing presidential policies from applying against anyone, anywhere.In a 6-3 ruling powered by its conservative majority, the Supreme Court issued a ruling in June blunting the power of federal judges but did not resolve the legality of Trump's directive.The ruling left open the possibility for courts to grant broad relief to states or to individual plaintiffs through class action lawsuits.(With inputs from Reuters)","url":"https://www.livemint.com/news/us-news/us-supreme-court-to-decide-legality-of-trumps-controversial-policy-on-birthright-citizenship-the-case-so-far-11764980578664.html","image":"https://www.livemint.com/lm-img/img/2025/12/06/1600x900/logo/USA-COURT-PASSPORT-GENDER-0_1764980814193_1764980838163.JPG","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-06 00:29:05","author":"Akriti Anand","authors":["Akriti Anand"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"in","sentiment":-0.235},{"id":385487512,"title":"Trump Administration Warns About Europe Becoming Less White","text":"President Donald Trump’s administration released a document in the wee hours of Friday morning bemoaning “civilizational erasure” in Europe, and much of it could be read as a dog whistle to white nationalists. \n\nThe document, a national security plan about maintaining American dominance in the Western world, raises concerns that European nations aren’t strong allies in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and blames a diversifying Europe.\n\nIt’s plausible, the document argues without evidence, that “within a few decades at the latest, certain NATO members will become majority non-European,” adding again without any citation, “Should present trends continue, the continent will be unrecognizable in 20 years or less.”\n\nIt’s fair to question “whether they will view their place in the world, or their alliance with the United States, in the same way as those who signed the NATO charter,” Trump’s administration warned.\n\nThe document was full of more dire warnings about Europe’s “loss of national identities,” and the need for American diplomacy to uphold European countries’ “individual character and history.”\n\n“We want Europe to remain European,” the document states, parroting language from racist “Identitarian” groups and Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán, who has rebuked the existence of mixed-race people and called for “ethnic homogeneity.”\n\nIt also warns about “migration policies that are transforming the continent and creating strife” ― an apparent reference to the rise in immigration to Europe. \n\nThe document celebrates the rise of “the growing influence of patriotic European parties,” saying they’re “cause for great optimism.”\n\nThe comment comes amid the rise of the far-right group Patriots for Europe, which Orbán formed last year ahead of the European Parliament elections.

To reach this target, reports are claiming that she has given the green light to tap individuals who do not meet the current set of recruitment standards.Internal documents cited by media outlets suggest that in the rush to expand the workforce, Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) has processed candidates with a history of criminal convictions, failed drug tests, and medical disqualifications.Allegations of UnfitnessAccording to The Daily Mail, the ongoing recruitment for ICE agents is becoming a cause for concern because even candidates with previous convictions and those who have failed physical examinations have started undergoing training.Worse, a man whose doctor declared him unfit to participate in the training was still included in the program. Others also failed their drug tests but are still in training, according to multiple reports.Furthermore, internal sources claim that some recruits are even failing their open-book tests, and some cannot even speak or write in English.Dismantling the Training CurriculumTo facilitate the surge, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has reportedly altered the structural requirements for entry. The age limit for applicants has been removed, allowing individuals aged 18 and above to apply.Most critically, the training duration has been reduced drastically. Instead of 16 weeks of the standard course, the programme is compressed into six weeks.As such, there is a growing concern among critics who believe that such speed and scale come at the expense of basic competence. Worse, it could undermine public safety and the integrity of the agency.Spokesperson Defends Noem's DecisionDHS spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin defended the strategy, arguing that the recruits are not necessarily novices.'The vast majority of new officers brought on during the hiring surge are experienced law enforcement officers who have already successfully completed a law enforcement academy. This population is expected to account for greater than 85 percent of new hires. Prior-service hires follow streamlined validation but remain subject to medical, fitness, and background requirements,' she stated.Individuals React to ReportsOn TikTok, a user by the handle realtalkus posted a video weighing in on Noem's recent decision to allow just about anyone into the ICE training program. They said that the public should absolutely be scared of this decision.'Yes, you heard that right. The agency with the power to detain, deport, and physically remove people from this country is hiring recruits who can't pass open-book tests. Why? Because Noem wants 10,000 new deportation officers hired by the end of this year. And the department is cutting corners everywhere to make it happen,' the user said in the video.Commenters echoed these fears, questioning the accountability of the leadership.'Noem should be accountable. That's her dept. She's in charge,' one person wrote.'And they are talking about adults, not children. And they said that DEI was the problem,' another person wrote.'So, basically mini Donald Trumps...' a third person commented.'Trump signing up?' someone joked.'The incompetence of this regime is astounding,' another person commented.As the deadline for the hiring target approaches, the administration faces increasing pressure to clarify its vetting protocols.","url":"https://www.ibtimes.co.uk/kristi-noem-allegedly-allows-unfit-underqualified-recruits-ice-due-hiring-surge-1760667","image":"https://d.ibtimes.co.uk/en/full/1742808/kristi-noem.jpg?w=1600&h=900&q=88&f=093458d250bccf61bf706882890d2252","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-06 00:27:10","author":"Mimi Heimbrod","authors":["Mimi Heimbrod"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.071},{"id":385489382,"title":"What to know about the air traffic control overhaul and the company FAA hired to manage it","text":"By JOSH FUNK and RIO YAMAT\n\nThe government picked a company with little experience working with the Federal Aviation Administration called Peraton to oversee the roughly $31.5 billion overhaul of the outdated air traffic control system.\n\nTransportation Secretary Sean Duffy said Thursday evening that Peraton was chosen in the hope that its innovative approach will make it possible to complete the upgrades within the next three years before the end of President Donald Trump’s term in office ends. Peraton was chosen over Parsons Corp., which does have extensive experience with FAA contracts.\n\n“Working together, we are going to build on the incredible progress we’ve already made and deliver a state-of-the-art air traffic control system that the American traveling public — and our hard-working air traffic controllers — deserve,” Duffy said in the announcement.\n\nHere’s what to know about the modernization project and the company hired to oversee it:\n\nA $12.5 billion down payment on the project\n\nEarlier this year, Congress approved $12.5 billion as a down payment on the project after technical problems twice knocked out the radar for air traffic controllers managing planes around Newark Liberty International Airport. This year began with the worst American aviation disaster in years when an airliner collided with an Army helicopter over Washington D.C., killing 67 people.\n\nDuffy has said he’ll need roughly $20 billion more to complete the upgrade.\n\nThis effort to upgrade the technology controllers use is on a much more aggressive timeline than the previous NextGen effort that began shortly after the turn of the century and failed to deliver all the benefits it promised even after an investment of $36 billion. The Biden administration had estimated that upgrading the system might take more than a decade.\n\nThe FAA hasn’t yet released the details of how much Peraton will be paid for this contract, but the agency said it includes incentives to reward good performance and penalties for shortcomings.\n\nUpgrades needed to avoid delays and prepare for drones and flying taxis\n\nThe technical problems that disrupted flights at the Newark airport in the spring demonstrated just how fragile the nation’s aging air traffic control system is. And Duffy has said those kind of technical failures in a system that too often still relies on copper wires and floppy discs could happen anywhere unless the system is upgraded.\n\nHundreds of flights were canceled or delayed in Newark. After the radar outages, the facility in Philadelphia that controls the flights in and out of Newark had a half dozen controllers go on leave, which forced the reductions in flights.\n\nThe number of flights across the country each day that the FAA has to safely manage is expected to continue growing in the years ahead. And drones will continue to proliferate across the country as flying taxis start to take to the air.\n\nEveryone agrees that the air traffic control system must be modernized to be able to handle those future demands.\n\nAmbitious timeline for the upgrades\n\nJohn Rose, chief risk adviser for global travel management company ALTOUR, said the three-year timeline is “extremely aggressive” but partially realistic. He said it’s plausible for the FAA to build the foundation for a modern air traffic control network in its tight timeline, with more advanced capabilities layered on later.\n\n“You need to build the base before you can have all the bells and whistles,” he said. “If the project gets to the core structure in three years, I think we’ve accomplished the mission.”\n\nHe likened it to an iPhone where once you have a robust base system you can upgrade the software like when the phone gets an iOS update. “If they build the infrastructure, then as things change from a technology capability, it’s almost like a plug and play,” he said.\n\nAir Traffic Control Association President and CEO Stephen Creamer represents the companies that make the gear that Peraton and the FAA will use to complete the upgrades. He said it helps that the new system won’t have to be built from scratch.\n\n“The technology that’s needed in the system is not cutting edge technology. It’s been tested and trialed all over the world in various places. We know what the capabilities of it are. We know what the risks of those installations are in a way that we wouldn’t know if we were trying to do it and be the first one out of the gate,” Creamer said.\n\nWhy is this contract needed?\n\nDuffy said that putting a private company in charge should help this project get done more quickly, and Peraton’s expertise with complex technical systems and artificial intelligence will help.\n\nPeraton has said the fact that it doesn’t have a history of work at the FAA might actually help because it won’t be biased to working with the same companies that have failed in the past.\n\nAnd after all the cuts to the federal workforce Trump made this year and the early retirements. Creamer said that FAA needs the help to complete this project because it no longer has the staff to do it.\n\nThe expectation is that Peraton will be able to award contracts to other companies more quickly than FAA would be able to because it won’t be limited by the same process. That does introduce the possibility that mistakes could be made, but Creamer said “I think there’s plenty of checks and balances in the administrative system to ensure that there’s not gonna be substantial waste or fraud or abuse.”\n\nPeraton has worked on other government tech upgrades\n\nPeraton has worked on multibillion-dollar technology contracts for the Department of Homeland Security, the U.S. Special Operations Command and the National Park Service along with the military and other agencies.\n\nThe company is owned by Veritas Capital private equity firm, so it doesn’t have shareholders. Its board of advisers is full of an assortment of former military and intelligence officials. A Peraton spokesman said the company was too busy getting started on the contract to do any interviews Friday, but its CEO Steve Schorer promised in a statement that his team is committed to completing this project.\n\n“Our highly-skilled, dedicated, and talented team of engineers, technologists, and mission experts stands ready to hit the ground running to deliver a system Americans can count on — one that is more secure, more reliable, and a model for the world to follow,” Schorer said.\n\nThe company’s political action committee donated a quarter-million dollars to politicians last year with a little over half of that going to Republicans, according to www.opensecrets.org.\n\nImprovements already underway\n\nDuffy said that the FAA has already been working on making improvements and more than one-third of the old copper wires that air traffic controllers were relying on have been replaced with fiber optic lines or other modern connections.\n\nBut some of the advancements like installing new systems to help controllers keep track of planes on the ground at 44 airports began during the last administration.\n\nAnd significant work remains ahead to install more than 27,600 new radios and 612 new radar systems. The old connections still need to upgraded at thousands of additional facilities, and six new air traffic control centers are scheduled to be built.","url":"https://www.orlandosentinel.com/2025/12/05/peraton-faa-air-traffic-control-overhaul/","image":"https://www.orlandosentinel.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Government_Shutdown-Aviation_29012-1.jpg?w=1024&h=682","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-06 00:26:49","author":"Associated Press","authors":["Associated Press"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.687},{"id":385487936,"title":"What to know about the air traffic control overhaul and the company FAA hired to manage it","text":"By JOSH FUNK and RIO YAMAT\n\nThe government picked a company with little experience working with the Federal Aviation Administration called Peraton to oversee the roughly $31.5 billion overhaul of the outdated air traffic control system.\n\nTransportation Secretary Sean Duffy said Thursday evening that Peraton was chosen in the hope that its innovative approach will make it possible to complete the upgrades within the next three years before the end of President Donald Trump’s term in office ends.

Peraton was chosen over Parsons Corp., which does have extensive experience with FAA contracts.\n\n“Working together, we are going to build on the incredible progress we’ve already made and deliver a state-of-the-art air traffic control system that the American traveling public — and our hard-working air traffic controllers — deserve,” Duffy said in the announcement.\n\nHere’s what to know about the modernization project and the company hired to oversee it:\n\nA $12.5 billion down payment on the project\n\nEarlier this year, Congress approved $12.5 billion as a down payment on the project after technical problems twice knocked out the radar for air traffic controllers managing planes around Newark Liberty International Airport. This year began with the worst American aviation disaster in years when an airliner collided with an Army helicopter over Washington D.C., killing 67 people.\n\nDuffy has said he’ll need roughly $20 billion more to complete the upgrade.\n\nThis effort to upgrade the technology controllers use is on a much more aggressive timeline than the previous NextGen effort that began shortly after the turn of the century and failed to deliver all the benefits it promised even after an investment of $36 billion. The Biden administration had estimated that upgrading the system might take more than a decade.\n\nThe FAA hasn’t yet released the details of how much Peraton will be paid for this contract, but the agency said it includes incentives to reward good performance and penalties for shortcomings.\n\nUpgrades needed to avoid delays and prepare for drones and flying taxis\n\nThe technical problems that disrupted flights at the Newark airport in the spring demonstrated just how fragile the nation’s aging air traffic control system is. And Duffy has said those kind of technical failures in a system that too often still relies on copper wires and floppy discs could happen anywhere unless the system is upgraded.\n\nHundreds of flights were canceled or delayed in Newark. After the radar outages, the facility in Philadelphia that controls the flights in and out of Newark had a half dozen controllers go on leave, which forced the reductions in flights.\n\nThe number of flights across the country each day that the FAA has to safely manage is expected to continue growing in the years ahead.

Though at less than $6 billion in assets and slightly more than $1 billion in capital, according to state records, the institution would be considered a very small, community bank.\n\nThe Texas lender opened in 1988 as Beal Savings Bank and earlier this year changed its name to XD Bank before changing again two months later to Monet Bank. The state-chartered institution is regulated by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. and has six offices, according to federal data.\n\nOwner Andy Beal, who founded Beal Financial Corp., is known as a high-level poker player and a major 2016 backer of Trump's successful presidential campaign, having funded his own political action committee. The Information first reported on Monet Bank's shift to focus on digital assets earlier Friday.\n\nIt joins a slowly growing field of banks aiming to serve the crypto industry. In October, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) granted a conditional charter to Erebor Bank, a new tech-focused firm backed by Founders Fund's Peter Thiel (who is also invested in CoinDesk parent Bullish. And earlier this week, former Signature Bank executives launched N3XT, a narrow bank chartered as a Wyoming Special Purpose Depository Institution that says it will settle payments instantaneously through a private blockchain.\n\nThe shift comes amid a broader change in how federal bank regulators are approaching crypto.

Gavin Newsom, considered by some to be the frontrunner to be the next Democratic presidential nominee, said during a panel on Wednesday that he wants his party to be a “big tent” that welcomes large numbers of people into the fold. But he’s “adamantly against” one of the most popular proposals Democrats have to offer: a wealth tax.\n\nIn October, progressive economists Emmanuel Saez and Robert Reich joined forces with one of California’s most powerful unions, the Service Employees International Union’s (SEIU) United Healthcare Workers West, to propose that California put the nation’s first-ever wealth tax on the ballot in November 2026.\n\nThey described the measure as an “emergency billionaires tax” aimed at recouping the tens of billions of dollars that will be stripped from California’s 15 million Medicaid recipients over the next five years, after Republicans enacted historic cuts to the program in July with President Donald Trump’s One Big Beautiful Bill Act, which dramatically reduced taxes for the wealthiest Americans.\n\nAmong those beneficiaries were the approximately 200 billionaires living in California, whose average annual income, Saez pointed out, has risen by 7.5% per year, compared with 1.5% for median-income residents.\n\nUnder the proposal, they would pay a one-time 5% tax on their total net worth, which is estimated to raise $100 billion. The vast majority of the funds, about 90%, would be used to restore Medicaid funding, while the rest would go towards funding K-12 education, which the GOP has also slashed.\n\nThe proposal in California has strong support from unions and healthcare groups. But Newsom has called it “bad policy” and “another attempt to grab money for special purposes.”\n\nMeanwhile, several of his longtime consultants, including Dan Newman and Brian Brokaw, have launched a campaign alongside “business and tech leaders” to kill the measure, which they’ve dubbed “Stop the Squeeze.” They’ve issued familiar warnings that pinching the wealthy too hard will drive them from the state, along with the critical tax base they provide.\n\nAt Wednesday’s New York Times DealBook Summit, Andrew Ross Sorkin asked Newsom about his opposition to the wealth tax idea, comparing it to a proposal by recent New York City Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani, who pledged to increase the income taxes of New Yorkers who earn more than $1 million per year by 2% in order to fund his city-wide free buses, universal childcare, and city-owned grocery store programs.\n\nMamdani’s proposal was met with a litany of similar warnings from Big Apple bigwigs who threatened to flee the city and others around the country who said they’d never move in.\n\nBut as Robin Kaiser-Schatzlein explained in October for the American Prospect: “The evidence for this is thin: mostly memes shared by tech and finance people... Research shows that the truth of the matter is closer to the opposite. Wealthy individuals and their income move at lower rates than other income brackets, even in response to an increase of personal income tax.” Many of those who sulked about Mamdani’s victory have notably begun making amends with the incoming mayor.\n\nMoreover, the comparison between Mamdani’s plan and the one proposed in California is faulty to begin with. As Harold Meyerson explained, also for the Prospect: “It is a one-time-only tax, to be levied exclusively on billionaires’ current (i.e., 2025) net worth. Even if they move to Tasmania, they will still be liable for 5% of this year’s net worth.”\n\n“Crucially, the tax won’t crimp the fortunes of any billionaire who moves into the state next year or any later year, as it only applies to the billionaires living in the state this year,” he added. “Therefore... the horrific specter of billionaire flight can’t be levied against the California proposal.”\n\nNevertheless, Sorkin framed Newsom as being in an existential battle of ideas with Mamdani, asking how the two could both represent the Democratic Party when they are so “diametrically opposed.”\n\n“Well, I want to be a big-tent party,” Newsom replied. “It’s about addition, not subtraction.”\n\nPushed on the question of whether there should be a “unifying theory of the case,” Newsom responded that “we all want to be protected, we all want to be respected, we all want to be connected to something bigger than ourselves. We have fundamental values that I think define our party, about social justice, economic justice.”\n\n“We have pre-distribution Democrats, and we have re-distribution Democrats,” he continued. “Therein lies the dialectic and therein lies the debate.”\n\nPolling is scarce so far on the likelihood of such a measure passing in California. But nationally, polls suggest that the vast majority of Democrats fall on the “re-distribution” side of Newsom’s “dialectic.” In fact, the majority of all Americans do, regardless of party affiliation.\n\nLast year, Inequality.org examined 55 national and state polls about a number of different taxation policies and found:\n\nA billionaire income tax garnered the most support across party identification. On average, two out of three (67%) of Americans supported the tax including 84% of Democrats, 64% of Independents, and 51% of Republicans.In national polls, a wealth tax had similarly high levels of support. More than three out of five Americans supported the tax including 78% of Democrats, 62% of Independents, and 51% of Republicans.\n\nThat sentiment only seems to have grown since the return of President Donald Trump. An Economist/YouGov poll released in early November found that 72% of Americans said that taxes on billionaires should be raised—including 95% of Democrats, 75% of independents, and 48% of Republicans. Across the board, just 15% said they should not be raised.\n\nSupport remains high when the proposal is more specific as well. On the eve of Mamdani’s election, despitre months of fearmongering, 64% of New Yorkers said they backed his proposal, including a slight plurality of self-identified conservatives, according to a Siena College poll.\n\nMany observers were perplexed by how Newsom proposes to maintain a “big tent” while opposing policies supported by most of the people inside it.\n\n“A wealth tax is a big tent policy unless the only people you care about are billionaires,” wrote Jonathan Cohn, the political director for Progressive Mass, a grassroots organization in Massachusetts, on social media.\n\n“Gavin Newsom—estimated net worth between $20 and $30 million—says he’s opposed to a billionaire wealth tax.

But he’s “adamantly against” one of the most popular proposals Democrats have to offer: a wealth tax.\n\nIn October, progressive economists Emmanuel Saez and Robert Reich joined forces with one of California’s most powerful unions, the Service Employees International Union’s (SEIU) United Healthcare Workers West, to propose that California put the nation’s first-ever wealth tax on the ballot in November 2026.\n\nThey described the measure as an “emergency billionaires tax” aimed at recouping the tens of billions of dollars that will be stripped from California’s 15 million Medicaid recipients over the next five years, after Republicans enacted historic cuts to the program in July with President Donald Trump’s One Big Beautiful Bill Act, which dramatically reduced taxes ","url":"https://www.rawstory.com/gavin-newsom-2674374542/","image":"https://www.rawstory.com/media-library/help-people-instead-of-score-political-points-trump-feud-with-newsom-hits-boiling-point.jpg?id=55561048&width=1200&height=1200&coordinates=178%2C0%2C178%2C0","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-06 00:21:07","author":"Common Dreams,Stephen Prager","authors":["Common Dreams","Stephen Prager"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.2},{"id":385491612,"title":"Trump advisers and Ukrainian officials will meet for third day amid progress on peace plan","text":"Donald Trump’s advisers and Ukrainian officials said Friday they’ll meet for a third day of talks after making progress on creating a security framework for postwar Ukraine and are urging Russia to commit to peace.\n\nThe officials, who met for a second day in Florida on Friday, issued a joint statement that offered broad brushstrokes about the progress they say that’s been made as Trump pushes Kyiv and Moscow to agree to a US-mediated proposal to end nearly four years of war.\n\n“Both parties agreed that real progress toward any agreement depends on Russia’s readiness to show serious commitment to long-term peace, including steps toward de-escalation and cessation of killings,” the statement said. “Parties also separately reviewed the future prosperity agenda which aims to support Ukraine’s post-war reconstruction, joint US–Ukraine economic initiatives, and long-term recovery projects.”\n\nUS special envoy Steve Witkoff and Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner’s talks in Florida with Rustem Umerov, Ukraine’s lead negotiator, follow discussions between Vladimir Putin and the US envoys at the Kremlin on Tuesday.\n\nFriday’s session took place at the Shell Bay Club in Hallandale Beach, Florida, a high-end private golf and lifestyle destination owned by Witkoff’s real estate development company.\n\nPrevious diplomatic attempts to break the deadlock have come to nothing and the nearly four-year war has continued unabated. Officials largely have kept a lid on how the latest talks are going, though Trump’s initial 28-point plan was leaked.\n\nVolodymyr Zelenskyy, the Ukrainian president, said his country’s delegation in Florida wanted to hear from the US side about the talks at the Kremlin.\n\nZelenskyy, as well as European leaders backing him, have repeatedly accused Putin of stalling in peace talks while the Russian army tries to press forward with its invasion. Zelenskyy said in a video address late Thursday that officials wanted to know “what other pretexts Putin has come up with to drag out the war and to pressure Ukraine”.\n\nSpeaking to Russian journalist Pavel Zarubin on Friday, Kremlin foreign affairs adviser Yuri Ushakov praised Kushner as potentially playing an important role in ending Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Ushakov also took part in Tuesday’s talks at the Kremlin.\n\n“If any plan leading to a settlement is put on paper, it will be the pen of Mr Kushner that will lead the way,” Ushakov said.\n\nThe flattering comments about Kushner by the senior Russian official come as Putin has sought to sow division between Trump and Ukraine and Europe at a moment when Trump’s impatience with the conflict is mounting. Putin said his five-hour talks this week with Witkoff and Kushner were “necessary” and “useful” but that some proposals were unacceptable.\n\nKushner, who is married to Trump’s daughter Ivanka, was a senior adviser to Trump during his first term and the president’s point person on developing the Abraham Accords, which formalized commercial and diplomatic ties among Israel and a trio of Arab nations.\n\nKushner has played a more informal role in Trump’s second go-around, but he helped Witkoff close out ceasefire and hostage negotiations between Israel and Hamas this fall. Trump tapped Kushner again to pair up with Witkoff to try to find an endgame to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.\n\nUshakov, who accompanied Putin on a visit to India on Friday, repeated the Russian president’s recent criticism of Europe’s stance on the peace talks. Kyiv’s European allies are concerned about possible Russian aggression beyond Ukraine and want a prospective peace deal to include strong security guarantees.\n\nKyiv’s allies in Europe are “constantly putting forward demands that are unacceptable to Moscow”, Ushakov told Russia’s state-owned Zvezda TV. “Putting it mildly, the Europeans don’t help Washington and Moscow reach a settlement on the Ukrainian issues.”\n\nFrench president Emmanuel Macron said Friday that he made progress during a visit to Beijing on getting Chinese leader Xi Jinping’s support for peace efforts.\n\n“We exchanged deeply and truthfully on all points, and I saw a willingness from the [Chinese] president to contribute to stability and peace,” Macron said.\n\nThe French president said he stressed that Ukraine needs guarantees that Russia won’t attack it again if a settlement is reached and that Europe must have a voice in negotiations.\n\n“The unity between Americans and Europeans on the Ukrainian issue is essential. And I say it, repeat it, emphasize it. We need to work together,” Macron said.\n\nRussian drones struck a house in central Ukraine on Thursday night, killing a 12-year-old boy, officials said, while long-range Ukrainian strikes reportedly targeted a Russian port and an oil refinery.\n\nThe Russian attack in Ukraine’s central Dnipropetrovsk region destroyed the house where the boy was killed and also injured two women, according to the head of the regional military administration, Vladyslav Haivanenko.\n\nThe Ukrainian air force said Russia fired 137 drones of various types during the night.\n\nUkrainian drones attacked a port and an oil refinery inside Russia overnight as part of Kyiv’s campaign to disrupt Russian logistics, Ukraine’s general staff said.\n\nThe drones struck the Temryuk sea port in Russia’s Krasnodar region and the Syzran oil refinery in the Samara region, starting blazes, a statement said. Syzran is about 500 miles (800km) east of the border with Ukraine.\n\nThe Russian defense ministry said only that its air defenses intercepted 85 Ukrainian drones over Russian regions and Crimea, which Russia illegally annexed in 2014.","summary":"Joint statement comes as Trump pushes Kyiv and Moscow on US-mediated proposal to end nearly four years of war\n\nDonald Trump’s advisers and Ukrainian officials said Friday they’ll meet for a third day of talks after making progress on creating a security framework for postwar Ukraine and are urging Russia to commit to peace.\n\nThe officials, who met for a second day in Florida on Friday, issued a joint statement that offered broad brushstrokes about the progress they say that’s been made as Trump pushes Kyiv and Moscow to agree to a US-mediated proposal to end nearly four years of war.\n\n Continue reading...","url":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/dec/05/ukraine-russia-trump-peace-plan","image":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c7a6f4c27ac642ab9d0e8773456ce1fb9db532d4/917_0_4583_3668/master/4583.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-06 00:20:53","author":"Associated Press","authors":["Associated Press"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.054},{"id":385490980,"title":"World News | Trump Awarded Inaugural FIFA Peace Prize at 2026 World Cup Draw Ceremony","text":"Washington DC [US], December 6 (ANI): US President Donald Trump has been given the inaugural FIFA Peace Prize at the 2026 World Cup draw in Washington.

It was going to be late, but we got them done,\" he added.\nFIFA President Infantino, presenting the honour to Trump, said it is \"a beautiful medal for you that you can wear everywhere you want to go\" and a certificate recognising POTUS's \"exceptional and extraordinary actions to promote peace.\"\nThe FIFA Peace Prize comes as a consolation to President Donald Trump, who missed out on the Nobel Peace Prize earlier this year, despite his repeated push for the award, emphasising his foreign policy achievements.\nTrump's repeated claim for credit for the ceasefire came months after India carried out Operation Sindoor in May 2025, in retaliation for the Pahalgam terror attack in April that killed 26 people. India, however, has consistently denied any third-party involvement, while Pakistan has publicly credited Trump for helping to broker the ceasefire during the May conflict. The award to Trump has irked football fans worldwide, who see the honour as \"politically motivated,\" arguing that sports shouldn't be involved in politics.

A greater share of poll respondents blamed the president’s handling of the economy. At the same time, the share of respondents who disapprove of the president rose to new heights. A New York Times analysis of polls found the president’s approval rating had fallen to 42%; his disapproval rating rose 55%.\n\nIn a statement, the White House blamed Trump’s predecessor for ongoing issues in the economy. \n\n\"Putting Joe Biden’s economic disaster behind us has been a Day One priority for President Trump.

Republicans’ rating is the lowest of Trump’s second term (84%) down from 91%. With Independents, Trump's approval rating fell to 25%, down from 33% in October.

But in a Friday letter, department officials ordered the workers back to duty starting Dec. 15 to help clear civil rights cases.\n\nA department spokesperson confirmed the move, saying the government still hoped to lay off the staffers to shrink the size of the department.\n\n“The Department will continue to appeal the persistent and unceasing litigation disputes concerning the Reductions in Force, but in the meantime, it will utilize all employees currently being compensated by American taxpayers,” Julie Hartman said in a statement.\n\nIn the letter to employees, obtained by The Associated Press, officials said the department needs “all OCR staff to prioritize OCR’s existing complaint caseload.” The office handles everything from complaints about possible violations of disability rights to racial discrimination.\n\nMore than 200 workers from the Office for Civil Rights were targeted in mass layoffs at the department, but the firings have been tied up in legal battles since March. An appeals court cleared the way for the cuts in September, but they’re again on hold because of a separate lawsuit. In all, the Education Department workforce has shrunk from 4,100 when President Donald Trump took office to roughly half that size now, as the president vows to wind down the agency. \n\nThe department did not say how many workers are returning to duty. Some who have been on administrative leave for months have since left.\n\nThe Office for Civil Rights had a backlog of about 20,000 discrimination cases when Trump took office in January. Since then, with a significantly reduced workforce, the backlog has grown to more than 25,000, AP reporting has shown using department data.\n\nTrump officials have defended the layoffs even as complaints pile up, saying the office wasn’t operating efficiently, even at full staff.\n\nThe Office for Civil Rights enforces many of the nation’s laws about civil rights in education, including those barring discrimination based on disability, sex, race and religion. It investigates complaints from students across the country and has the power to cut funding to schools and colleges that violate the law, though most cases are resolved in voluntary agreements.\n\nSome former staffers have said there’s no way the office can address the current backlog under the staffing levels left after the layoffs. Families who have filed discrimination complaints against their schools say they have noticed the department’s staffing shortages, with some waiting months and hearing nothing.\n\nThe Associated Press’ education coverage receives financial support from multiple private foundations.

The U.S. leader hasn’t been shy about his desire to receive the honor.\n\n“It’s a great day for Africa, a great day for the world,” Mr. Trump said shortly before the leaders signed the pact. He added, “Today, we’re succeeding where so many others have failed.”\n\nMr. Trump welcomed Presidents Felix Tshisekedi of Congo and Paul Kagame of Rwanda, as well as several officials from other African nations who travelled to Washington to witness the signing, in the same week he contemptuously derided the war-torn country of Somalia and said he did he did not want immigrants from the East African nation in the U.S.\n\nLauded by the White House as a “historic” agreement brokered by Mr. Trump, the pact between Mr. Tshisekedi and Mr. Kagame follows monthslong peace efforts by the U.S. and partners, including the African Union and Qatar, and finalises an earlier deal signed in June.\n\nBut the Trump-brokered peace is precarious.\n\nThe Central African nation of Congo has been battered by decadeslong fighting with more than 100 armed groups, the most potent being the Rwanda-backed M23 rebels. The conflict escalated this year, with M23 seizing the region’s main cities of Goma and Bukavu in an unprecedented advance, worsening a humanitarian crisis that was already one of the world’s largest, with millions of people displaced.\n\nFighting, meanwhile, continued this week in the conflict-battered region with pockets of clashes reported between the rebels and Congolese soldiers, together with their allied forces. Mr. Trump, a Republican, has often said that his mediation has ended the conflict, which some people in Congo say isn’t true.\n\nStill, Mr. Kagame and Mr. Tshisekedi offered a hopeful tone as they signed on to the agreement.\n\n“No one was asking President Trump to take up this task. Our region is far from the headlines,” Mr. Kagame said. “But when the president saw the opportunity to contribute to peace, he immediately took it.”\n\n“I do believe this day is the beginning of a new path, a demanding path, yes. Indeed, quite difficult,” Mr. Tshisekedi said. “But this is a path where peace will not just be a wish, an aspiration, but a turning point.”\n\nIndeed, analysts say Thursday’s (December 4) deal also isn’t expected to quickly result in peace. A separate peace deal has been signed between Congo and the M23.\n\n“We are still at war,” said Amani Chibalonza Edith, a 32-year-old resident of Goma, eastern Congo’s key city seized by rebels early this year. “There can be no peace as long as the front lines remain active.”\n\nBut Mr. Trump predicted with the signing the countries would leave behind “decades of violence and bloodshed” and “begin a new year of harmony and cooperation.”\n\n“They spent a lot of time killing each other,” Mr. Trump said. “And now they’re going to spend a lot of time hugging, holding hands and taking advantage of the United States of America economically like every other country does.”\n\nMr. Tshisekedi and Mr. Kagame did not shake hands and barely looked at each other during the roughly 50-minute signing ceremony.\n\nThursday’s (December 4) pact will also build on a Regional Economic Integration Framework previously agreed upon that officials have said will define the terms of economic partnerships involving the three countries.\n\nMr. Trump also announced the United States was signing bilateral agreements with the Congo and Rwanda that will unlock new opportunities for the United States to access critical minerals -- deals that will benefit all three nations’ economies.\n\n“And we’ll be involved with sending some of our biggest and greatest U.S. companies over to the two countries,” Mr. Trump said. He added, “Everybody’s going to make a lot of money.”\n\nThe region, rich in critical minerals, has been of interest to Mr. Trump as Washington looks for ways to circumvent China to acquire rare earths, essential to manufacturing fighter jets, cell phones and more. China accounts for nearly 70% of the world’s rare earth mining and controls roughly 90% of global rare earths processing.\n\nMr. Trump hosted the leaders on Thursday (December 4) morning for one-on-one meetings at the White House as well as a three-way conversation before the signing ceremony at the Institute of Peace in Washington, which the State Department announced on Wednesday (December 3) has been rebranded “the Donald J. Trump Institute of Peace.”\n\nIn eastern Congo, meanwhile, residents reported pockets of clashes and rebel advances in various localities. Both the M23 and Congolese forces have accused each other of violating the terms of the ceasefire agreed earlier this year. Fighting has also continued in the central plateaus across South Kivu province.\n\nThe hardship in the aftermath of the conflict has worsened following U.S. funding cuts that were crucial for aid support in the conflict.\n\nIn rebel-held Goma, which was a regional hub for security and humanitarian efforts before this year’s escalation of fighting, the international airport is closed. Government services such as bank operations have yet to resume and residents have reported a surge in crimes and in the prices of goods.\n\nThe conflict can be traced to the aftermath of the 1994 genocide in Rwanda, where Hutu militias killed between 500,000 and 1 million ethnic Tutsi, as well as moderate Hutus and Twa, Indigenous people. When Tutsi-led forces fought back, nearly 2 million Hutus crossed into Congo, fearing reprisals.\n\nRwandan authorities have accused the Hutus who fled of participating in the genocide and alleged that elements of the Congolese army protected them. They have argued that the militias formed by a small fraction of the Hutus are a threat to Rwanda’s Tutsi population.\n\nCongo’s government has said there can’t be permanent peace if Rwanda doesn’t withdraw its support troops and other support for the M23 in the region. Rwanda, on the other hand, has conditioned a permanent ceasefire on Congo dissolving a local militia that it said is made up of the Hutus and is fighting with the Congolese military.\n\nU.N. experts have said that between 3,000 and 4,000 Rwandan government forces are deployed in eastern Congo, operating alongside the M23. Rwanda denies such support, but says any action taken in the conflict is to protect its territory.","url":"https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/trump-praises-congo-and-rwanda-as-they-sign-us-mediated-peace-deal/article70363727.ece","image":"https://th-i.thgim.com/public/incoming/jspcqd/article70347928.ece/alternates/LANDSCAPE_1200/2025-12-01T192528Z_1598517527_RC259HAGHJOB_RTRMADP_3_USA-TRUMP-MRI.JPG","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-06 00:16:00","author":"Donald Trump","authors":["Donald Trump"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"in","sentiment":0.038},{"id":385487776,"title":"Trump talks North American free trade deal with leaders of Canada & Mexico at World Cup draw","text":"US President Donald Trump met on Friday with Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney and Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum, with the talks partly focused on the future of a North American free trade deal.\nThe leaders met in Washington on the sidelines of the draw for the 2026 World Cup, co-hosted by Canada, Mexico and the United States.\n“The three leaders met for approximately 45 minutes,” Carney spokesperson Audrey Champoux said in an email.\nSTORY CONTINUES BELOW THIS AD “They’ve agreed to keep working together on CUSMA,” she added, using the Canadian acronym for the existing free trade deal between the three countries, which Americans call the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA).\nMore from World From intelligence to missiles: US sets 2027 deadline for Europe to take lead on Nato conventional defence Boycotts over Israel’s entry cast shadow on 2026 Eurovision Song Contest The USMCA deal was struck during Trump’s first term.\nTrump has slapped steep tariffs on exports from Canada and Mexico that do not fall under the USMCA, which Washington is seeking to renegotiate next year.\nFriday’s talks were the first between Trump and Sheinbaum.\nCarney has visited the White House twice since Trump’s return to power, but it will be his first encounter with Trump – except for a brief meeting at a summit in South Korea – since the US leader suspended trade talks in a bizarre row over an anti-tariff ad.\nTrump has also threatened further punishment if they fail to curb cross-border migration and drug trafficking – and irked Sheinbaum by saying he would be “OK” with air strikes on Mexico to tackle traffickers.\nQuick Reads View All Nepali PM Karki holds talks with political parties, Election Commission & Gen-Z about elections 2 boat survivors killed by US strike on Sept 2 didn’t have weapon or means to escape She has vowed the strikes will never happen.\nCanada also was outraged by Trump’s calls earlier this year for it to become the 51st US state.\nCarney drew criticism at recent G20 meetings in South Africa when, asked by a reporter when he last spoke to Trump, answered, “Who cares?”\nThe three countries launched their joint World Cup bid in 2017 during Trump’s first term in the White House.\nSTORY CONTINUES BELOW THIS AD Trump said Friday that the United States had worked closely with Mexico and Canada over the tournament, adding “the coordination and friendship and relationship has been outstanding.”","url":"https://www.firstpost.com/world/trump-talks-north-american-free-trade-deal-with-leaders-of-canada-mexico-at-world-cup-draw-13957081.html","image":"https://images.firstpost.com/uploads/2025/12/AFP__20251205__879B3AW__v1__HighRes__UsPresidentDonaldTrumpAttendsFifaS2026WorldCupD-1-2025-12-c01ec97e49f4d1f4c05be03fd966e880.jpg?im=FitAndFill=(1200,675)","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-06 00:11:44","author":"Agence France-Presse","authors":["Agence France-Presse"],"language":"en","source_country":"in","sentiment":0.125},{"id":385488810,"title":"ICE arrests Azerbaijan national with multiple criminal convictions including animal cruelty, arson","text":"U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) announced on Friday agents arrested an illegal immigrant from Azerbaijan, who had multiple convictions for crimes including cruelty to animals.

It also warned that Europe faces “civilizational erasure” and must change course.\n\nThe document is the latest – and clearest – expression of Trump’s desire to shake up the post-World War Two order led by the United States and built on a network of alliances and multilateral groups, and redefine it through his “America First” lens.\n\n“President Trump’s foreign policy is pragmatic without being ‘pragmatist,’ realistic without being ‘realist,’ principled without being “idealistic,” muscular without being ‘hawkish,’ and restrained without being ‘dovish,'” the 29-page document says.\n\n“It is motivated above all by what works for America.”\n\nThe paper, which is released by every new administration and guides the work of many government agencies, said Trump would “restore American preeminence” in the Western Hemisphere and puts the region at the top of the administration’s foreign policy priorities.\n\n“This ‘Trump Corollary’ to the Monroe Doctrine is a common-sense and potent restoration of American power and priorities, consistent with American security interests,” the document says, suggesting that the large U.S. military build-up in the region is not temporary.\n\nSince taking office in January, critics have said Trump’s rhetoric evokes modern-day imperialism in the Western Hemisphere. He spoke early on, in vague terms, of retaking the Panama Canal and annexing Greenland and Canada.\n\nMore recently, the growing U.S. military presence in the Caribbean and threats of land strikes in Venezuela and in other countries where drug cartels operate have added to concerns in a region where Washington has a troubled history of military interventions.\n\nThe United States has sent more than 10,000 troops to the Caribbean, along with an aircraft carrier, warships and fighter jets.\n\n“The new National Security Strategy points out pretty clearly that we’re not going to go back to the way things were,” said Jason Marczak, a senior Latin America analyst with the Atlantic Council think-tank in Washington.\n\nThe document also alludes to China’s growing economic clout in Latin America, which has been of concern to successive U.S. administrations, and the goal of countering that.\n\nIn Asia, the document said, Trump aims to deter conflict with China over Taiwan and the South China Sea by building up U.S. and allies’ military power.\n\n“Deterring a conflict over Taiwan, ideally by preserving military overmatch, is a priority,” according to the document.\n\nThe issue has been an irritant in U.S.-China relations for years.\n\nBut Trump has a history of unconventional foreign policy moves, making it hard to predict how this formalization of national security themes could translate into concrete actions.\n\nIn the document, the administration took a dour view of its traditional allies in Europe, warning that the continent faces “civilizational erasure” and must change course if it is to remain a reliable ally for the United States.\n\nThe document is the latest in a series of statements by U.S. officials that have upended postwar assumptions about Europe’s close relationship with its strongest ally, the United States.\n\n“Over the long term, it is more than plausible that within a few decades at the latest, certain NATO members will become majority non-European,” the document said.\n\nSome European commentators said the document echoed talking points of far-right European political parties, which have grown to become the main opposition to governments in Germany, France and other traditional U.S. allies.\n\nThe Trump administration, the document said, wanted to restore “Western identity” in Europe. It comes as Trump has used increasingly racist rhetoric against immigrants of color in the United States.\n\nEuropean politicians and officials have bridled at Washington’s tone but as they hurry to rebuild their neglected militaries to meet a perceived threat from Russia, they still rely heavily on U.S. military support.\n\nThe document said it was in the United States’ strategic interest to negotiate a quick resolution in Ukraine and to re-establish “strategic stability” with Russia.\n\nTrump has a history of making positive and admiring comments about Russian President Vladimir Putin that have long prompted criticism that he is “soft on Russia.”\n\nReuters reported on Friday that Washington wants Europe to take over the majority of NATO’s conventional defense capabilities, from intelligence to missiles, a tight deadline that struck some European officials as unrealistic.\n\nAssessing how regions of the world rank under Trump’s agenda, Brad Bowman, an expert at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies think-tank in Washington, wrote on X: “Winners in the time, resource, and attention contest?: Western Hemisphere and maybe the Pacific.
