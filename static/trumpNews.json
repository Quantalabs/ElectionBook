(EPA Images pic)\nWASHINGTON: The number of US federal worker layoffs as a result of the government shutdown was revised downward on Tuesday, suggesting the Trump administration's initial statement about sweeping job cuts was too ambitious.\nThe Trump administration has dismissed 4,108 employees since Oct 1, the day the US government shutdown began, according to a statement filed Tuesday in court by the US department of justice.\nThe justice department last week, in a separate court filing, estimated the figure was at least 4,278.\nThe cuts amount to a fraction of the US government's workforce. US agencies employed some 2 million civilians at the start of the Trump administration.\nPresident Donald Trump blamed the cuts on the US government shutdown. The government is closed because Trump and lawmakers have failed to agree on a spending plan for federal agencies.\nTrump is trying to pressure Democrats into accepting his spending plan by firing federal workers and cutting programs he says Democrats favour.\nSince 1981, the US has had 15 federal government shutdowns that furloughed hundreds of thousands of workers. No president has sought to use a shutdown as the basis for large-scale firings.\nThe dismissals are expected to disrupt government operations, including disease outbreak investigations and college preparation.\nFederal worker unions are suing to overturn the firings. The law prohibits US agencies from carrying out functions without approved funding from Congress. There are certain exceptions, including for national security purposes and essential services to protect life and property.\nThe unions said that implementing layoffs is not an essential service that can be performed during a government closure. The shutdown does not justify mass job cuts because most federal workers have been furloughed without pay, they said.\nA federal judge is due to hear the case on Oct 15.\nLawmakers from Maryland and Virginia blasted the firings at a rally near the White House on Tuesday morning, arguing that the cuts are hurting the families they represent.\nRoughly 20% of the federal workforce lives in Washington DC, Maryland and Virginia, according to federal statistics.\n\"We will not be defined by small people who have not a drop of empathy in their soul,\" Representative Don Beyer, a Virginia Democrat, said at the rally.","summary":"The layoffs represent a small portion of the US government’s 2 million civilian employees at the start of Donald Trump’s term.","url":"https://www.freemalaysiatoday.com/category/world/2025/10/15/trump-administration-says-4108-workers-fired-since-shutdown-began","image":"https://www.freemalaysiatoday.com/cdn-cgi/image/quality=75,format=auto,fit=scale-down,dpr=1,width=1600,height=1000/https://media.freemalaysiatoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/3d10a27e-us-capitol-building-21122024.webp","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-10-15 00:49:42","author":"Reuters","authors":["Reuters"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"my","sentiment":-0.576},{"id":369293670,"title":"Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni says she can't quit smoking... she might 'kill somebody'","text":"Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni has said she would probably kill someone if she had to give up cigarettes.\n\nThe Italian leader made the quip during a light-hearted exchange at the Gaza summit in Egypt, after Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, who has pledged to make Turkey smoke-free, challenged her over her smoking habit.\n\n'You look great.

(EPA Images pic)\nJERUSALEM: Hamas handed over more bodies of deceased hostages to Israel on Tuesday, one sign of progress after a number of apparent setbacks in the day since US President Donald Trump touted his plan to end the Gaza war.\nThe bodies were returned after Israel announced it would cut in half the number of humanitarian aid trucks allowed into Gaza in a move to punish Hamas for what Israel called the militant group's violation of its agreement to transfer remains under the ceasefire deal reached last week.\nMeanwhile, re-emergent Hamas fighters demonstrated they were reasserting control in Gaza by deploying hundreds of security forces in the streets and executing several people they accused of collaborating with Israel.\nThe outlook for Trump's peace plan darkened further when the president threatened Hamas with military strikes unless the militant group disarmed.\n\"If they don't disarm, we will disarm them. And it will happen quickly and perhaps violently,\" Trump said at the White House, one day after he spoke before the Knesset in Jerusalem.\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has maintained the war cannot end until Hamas surrenders its weapons and cedes control of Gaza, a demand the fighters have rejected.\nOn Monday, Trump proclaimed the \"historic dawn of a new Middle East\" to Israel's parliament, as Israel and Hamas were exchanging the last 20 living Israeli hostages in Gaza for nearly 2,000 Palestinian detainees and prisoners.\nBut the return of 28 dead hostages has remained one of the final details to be worked out in the deal to end more than two years of hostilities that began with Hamas attacks on Israel on Oct 7, 2023.\nHamas has now handed over eight coffins of dead hostages, leaving at least 19 presumed dead and one unaccounted for still in the Gaza Strip.\nOn Tuesday, the Israeli military said it received four coffins from the Red Cross at a meeting point in northern Gaza Strip. Those coffins, escorted by Israeli forces, crossed the border into Israel shortly before midnight (2100 GMT) and were being taken for forensic identification, the Israeli military said.\nHamas also confirmed the transfer was under way.\n“At this moment, the men are continuing to oversee the implementation of what was agreed upon regarding the handover of bodies as part of the agreement to end the war in Gaza,” Hamas spokesperson in Gaza Hazem Qassem on Facebook.\nIt was not immediately clear if the handing over of bodies was sufficient for Israel to restore a full complement of aid deliveries.\nIsraeli officials said they had decided to restrict aid, allowing only half the agreed number of aid trucks into Gaza starting Wednesday, and to delay plans to open the southern border crossing to Egypt because Hamas had violated the ceasefire deal by failing to turn over bodies of hostages.\nIsrael's two-year assault has left much of the enclave in ruins and Gaza City and surrounding areas are suffering from a famine that has afflicted more than half a million Palestinians, creating great need for an expected 600 aid trucks to enter Gaza daily during the ceasefire.\nPlans have yet to be implemented to open the crossing to Egypt to let some Gazans out, initially to evacuate the wounded for medical treatment.\nHamas asserts control\nHamas, which seized Gaza in a brief 2007 civil war, has swiftly reclaimed the streets of Gaza's urban areas following the partial withdrawal of Israeli troops last week. Gaza residents said Hamas fighters were increasingly visible on Tuesday, deploying along routes needed for aid deliveries.\nIn a video circulated late on Monday, Hamas fighters dragged seven men with hands tied behind their backs into a Gaza City square, forced them to their knees and shot them from behind, as dozens of onlookers watched from nearby storefronts.\nA Hamas source confirmed that the video was taken on Monday and that Hamas fighters participated in the executions. Reuters was able to confirm the location by visible geographic features.\nTrump has previously given his blessing to Hamas to reassert some control of Gaza, at least temporarily. Israeli officials have so far refrained from commenting publicly on the re-emergence of the group's fighters.\nPalestinian security officials said dozens of people had been killed in clashes between Hamas fighters and rivals in recent days.\nIn addition Israel, using aerial drones, killed five Palestinians as they went to check on houses in a suburb east of Gaza City, and an Israeli airstrike killed one person and injured another near Khan Younis, Gaza health authorities said.\nHamas accused Israel of violating the ceasefire. The Israeli military said it had fired on people who crossed truce lines and approached its forces after ignoring calls to turn back.\nHamas sources told Reuters on Tuesday the group would tolerate no more violations of order in Gaza and would target collaborators, armed looters and drug dealers.\nThe ceasefire has stopped two years of devastating warfare in Gaza triggered by the Oct 7, 2023 attack in which Hamas-led gunmen killed around 1,200 people and took 251 hostages back to Gaza, according to Israeli tallies.\nIsrael's military has killed at least 67,000 people in Gaza according to local health authorities, with thousands more feared dead under the rubble. Gaza's Civil Defence Service said 250 bodies had been recovered since the truce began.","summary":"Eight coffins of dead hostages have been handed over, leaving at least 19 presumed dead and one still unaccounted for in Gaza.","url":"https://www.freemalaysiatoday.com/category/world/2025/10/15/hamas-hands-over-hostage-bodies-after-israel-threatens-aid-cut","image":"https://www.freemalaysiatoday.com/cdn-cgi/image/quality=80,format=auto,fit=scale-down,dpr=1,width=1600,height=1000/https://media.freemalaysiatoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/10fe7eaa-hamas-israel-hostages.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-10-15 00:32:13","author":"Reuters","authors":["Reuters"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"my","sentiment":-0.312},{"id":369297520,"title":"Trump says US will not 'waste our time' helping Argentina if Milei loses","text":"President Donald Trump has acknowledged that a $20bn (£15bn) US lifeline to help calm Argentina's currency crisis is an attempt to sway elections this month in the South American nation.\n\nWelcoming Argentina's libertarian leader Javier Milei to the White House, Trump warned that the US would not \"waste our time\" with helping Argentina if Milei's party did not prevail.\n\nMilei praised Trump for his peacemaking efforts and said the US president's policies would lead to \"prosperity\".\n\nArgentina's financial turmoil comes ahead of national midterm elections on 26 October, seen as a test of voters' desire to continue backing Milei's cost-cutting, free-market reform agenda.\n\nAs Trump sat across the table from his Argentine counterpart on Tuesday, he said the not-so-quiet bit out loud.\n\n\"The election is coming up very soon,\" he said. \"It's a very big election.\"\n\nTrump added: \"Victory [for Milei] is very important. Your poll numbers I hear are pretty good. I think they will be better after this.\n\n\"And, you know, our approvals are somewhat subject to who wins the election.\"\n\nA presidential election is not due in Argentina until 2027.

On the other hand, there is a widespread suspicion that Mr Trump’s ambition owes little to a passion for peace and much to resentment of the fact that Barack Obama got one.\n\nStudents of the history of international relations will no doubt have noticed already that standards drooped when the professional diplomats were elbowed aside by national leaders, whether elected or hereditary. But this is surely a new low.\n\nI may be biased. It is true that English culture traditionally sets a high value on modesty and self-deprecation. One may hope for honours, but one does not ask. \n\nThere is a character in one of CP Snow’s novels who is a senior civil servant and thinks he is due for a knighthood. So instead of signing with an initial, he starts signing with his full Christian name – John Smith, instead of J. Smith – in the hope that his seniors will see fit to put a “Sir” in front of it.\n\nThis is regarded as a serious, if amusing, character defect, and the knighthood does not materialise.\n\nThe press pioneer Alfred Harmsworth had better luck. To the suggestion that he should agitate politely for a peerage, he famously replied, “When I want a peerage, I shall buy one like an honest man.” He did later, without paying, become Lord Northcliffe. \n\nWhen I worked for the Derby Evening Telegraph, we still had a rather poor portrait of him in the hall.\n\nThe presentation of honours in Hong Kong has never caused much controversy. The colonial ones were not taken very seriously because they were … well … colonial. Their post-handover replacements have not established themselves as a big deal.\n\nI once did a rough study of the arrival of honours in the Legislative Council. It appeared that if you were a loyal supporter of the regime, there was a fairly predictable timeline along which, as long as you survived re-election, you would travel from Justice of the Peace through bauhinias of various colours. \n\nOne member of the Democratic Alliance for the Betterment and Progress of Hong Kong (DAB) party seemed to be stuck on the launch pad, as it were. I suspect he had refused to participate.\n\nI am not aware of any similar study of how life treats those who go “seeking the bubble reputation” through the consultative apparatus.\n\nThere were some misgivings a few years ago when some people with qualifications in engineering adopted the pretitle “Ir”, which works like “Dr”. The “I” is because the title originated in French. Lawyers suggested that they should perhaps put in a bid for “Lr” before the librarians grabbed it.\n\nSome people disapprove of this sort of thing. One of the idols of my youth was Charles Carter, who was the first vice chancellor of Lancaster University. Mr Carter was a devout Quaker and spurned titles of any kind. \n\nHe always signed and described himself as plain Charles Carter, and I only discovered that he was entitled to both titles “Dr” and “Prof” when I got a look at correspondence from polite outsiders.\n\nHe did tell me – a point lost on holders of honorary degrees in Hong Kong – that such honours should only be worn in the premises of the university awarding them. So if you have an Hon Doc, whether or not you earned it or “bought one like an honest man,” it should not be on your business card.\n\nAnyway, all this suggests that there may be an easy way to propitiate the unpredictable Trump. Countries which wish to bow before the president should look into the possibilities of honorary degrees, orders, knighthoods, perhaps, in lucky old England, even a lordship.Alternatively, at the risk of punishment, they could refer him to the work of poet Thomas Gray:\n\nThe boast of heraldry, the pomp of pow’r,\n\n And all that beauty, all that wealth e’er gave,\n\nAwaits alike th’ inevitable hour.\n\n The paths of glory lead but to the grave.","summary":"Quite the mind-boggling headline of the week announced &#8211; with wording varied in different places, of course &#8211; that the government of Norway was bracing itself for some retaliation from the USA if President Donald Trump was not awarded the Nobel Peace Prize.

Many bodies are buried beneath the rubble of buildings destroyed after two years of bombing, and separating the corpses of hostages from other people’s remains will not be easy.\n\nHowever, if all the bodies are not handed over for a proper burial, the suspicion will remain that Hamas and other hostage-holding jihadi groups are keeping them back because they fear they will reveal that the victims were tortured to death or executed rather than being ‘collateral damage’ of bombing raids.\n\n2) Failure to disarm\n\nDisarming Hamas was one of Israel’s key demands but, within hours of the declaration of the ceasefire deal, the Palestinian terrorists had summoned 7,000 fighters onto the streets to act as an armed police force. Donald Trump hinted he could accept a temporary law-and-order role for Hamas to fill the power vacuum in Gaza – but the Israelis view any Hamas militants with guns as a threat.\n\n3) Gazan civil war\n\nBrutal infighting plagues Gaza to this day. While Hamas may have been the dominant force for years, its authority is undermined by other armed groups such as the Doghmush clan – believed to have hundreds of fighters.\n\nThis group and other warlord-led gangs are denounced as criminals and Israeli agents by Hamas but remain formidable foes. In a bid to impose its authority last weekend, Hamas deployed as many as 2,000 of its fighters against the Doghmush clan, which it sees as one of its main rivals in the Strip, reportedly killing 32 and arresting and injuring dozens more.\n\n4) Hamas return\n\nEven if the scheduled withdrawal of the Israeli army under the Trump plan goes ahead, it is by no means certain that Hamas will keep its promises. The last time the Israelis withdrew from the Strip, in 2005, Hamas staged an armed takeover. After suppressing local Palestinian rivals, such as The Palestine Liberation Organisation (PLO), with brutal efficiency, they began a wave of rocket attacks on southern Israel.\n\n5) Toothless peacekeepers\n\nThe plan is for international peacekeepers to prevent Hamas rearming and provide security for the people of Gaza. But will they and their governments be willing to take casualties, especially as the Americans insist they won’t put any of their boots on the ground? Past UN detachments of ‘blue helmets’ have been brushed aside by Israeli and Arab forces alike.\n\n6) West Bank violence\n\nGaza isn’t the only Palestinian territory in which violence is at risk of reigniting.\n\nThe Israeli-occupied West Bank, which stretches from Jerusalem east to the River Jordan, has seen more than 1,400 violent deaths in the past two years.\n\nInterspersed among its population of roughly five million Arabs are hundreds of thousands of Jewish settlers.\n\nSecurity responsibilities are shared between Israel and the Palestinian authority. A clash around the settlements and along the roads connecting them could easily spiral out of control.\n\nThe October 7 attacks on kibbutzim bordering Gaza could well be the model for a similar atrocity on the West Bank.\n\n7) Historic divisions\n\nDeep historical rivalries underlie the current Arab-Israel dispute – specifically over the question of who owns the land by right?\n\nIsraelis look back to Ancient Israel as their national heritage. From King David’s city of Jerusalem – the site of Solomon’s temple – to Arab majority cities like Hebron, where Abraham, the founder of the religion is buried, countless key Jewish sites are in this territory.\n\nMeanwhile, Muslim shrines such as the Al Aqsa mosque and the Dome Of The Rock are in east Jerusalem, a city which Israel – and Donald Trump – regards as its territory but which many European and Arab states prefer to see as Palestinian.\n\nThere is no obvious way to reconcile these incompatible and deeply felt claims.\n\n8) Return of missiles\n\nExternal agents such as Iran and its proxies in the region – Yemen’s Houthis and Lebanon’s Hezbollah – could stir up trouble by renewing the missile attacks they started in 2023. Would Israel be willing to tolerate this? It seems highly unlikely.\n\n9) Frontline friction\n\nNot every potentially explosive event could be a planned provocation. Just yesterday morning, Israeli Army soldiers shot five Palestinians dead as they crossed the ceasefire line, showing how spontaneous actions can lead to violence and potential escalation.\n\n10) Territorial disputes\n\nTime is often regarded as a great healer but the lesson of the Palestinian-Israeli conflict is that the passage of time can also deepen the bitterness between peoples.\n\nMany Palestinians in both Gaza and the West Bank still live only a few miles from homes their families occupied before 1948 when they were driven out by the Israelis.\n\nDistance in space as well as time might make refugees put past sufferings and grievances behind them, but Palestinians have had eight decades to nurse their resentments against Israel and it is not obvious that a pause in the fighting will see them look to the future.\n\n11) International divisions\n\nPrime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu says Israel won’t accept any kind of independent Palestinian state but some of America’s key European allies, including Keir Starmer’s government here and President Macron’s in France, have already recognised ‘Palestine’ as an independent country. This means Trump’s major international friends could unravel his peace efforts. Trump may be right to leave some details of the future vague to get on with rebuilding but his squabbling allies could trip up his approach and he will need to stay committed as other world crises such as Ukraine grab his attention.\n\n12) Peace Board rows\n\nFighting over the composition of Trump’s ‘Peace Board’, the body he envisages overseeing Gaza and an ambitious reconstruction programme, could also spell trouble.\n\nAbout the only thing all parties agree on is that Trump should preside over it but the President has many other things on his plate. An unwieldy supervising body could become factionalised and paralyse rebuilding efforts, leaving ordinary Palestinians – denied their peace dividend – turning back to extremist leaders.\n\n13) Gas field revenues\n\nWill the Palestinians be given rights to territorial waters? If so, there are bound to be disputes over the natural gas fields off the coast of Gaza.\n\nThe Israelis will want them for their revenue as they seek to recover some of the costs of the war, while the Palestinians need every penny they can get to rebuild their shattered cities.\n\n14) Right-wing backlash\n\nFoot-dragging by Hamas over giving up its weapons could lead Right-wing elements of Netanyahu’s coalition to pressure him to resume military operations in Gaza, effectively scuttling Trump’s deal. As one ultra-Right member of Netanyahu’s governing coalition said this week: ‘We are not happy with any deal that is not total surrender of Hamas... We will not accept any partial victory.’\n\nMark Almond is director of the Crisis Research Institute in Oxford","summary":"One of the conditions of the peace deal is that Hamas hand over the remains of all the hostages who died - or were murdered - during the fighting.

The criminal complaint alleges Pokorny “did willingly, unlawfully and knowingly threaten the life of, and threaten serious bodily harm” to Lee.\n\nHe is scheduled to have a pre-trial hearing Wednesday and was being held in lieu of $70,000 bail at Santa Rita Jail.\n\nThe alleged threats were made via emails to the mayor between Sept. 7 and Sept. 21, according to court documents.\n\nPokorny’s first email sent Sept. 7 used a slur to refer to Black Oakland residents and threatened widespread violence against Lee and the Black community, claiming he had a “legal right” to commit those acts, according to court records.\n\n“I think we should kill all of the government officials in Oakland and all of the police officers and judges in Oakland as well,” the email said, according to court records. “I would like to play a video game about killing the police officer, judges and (expletive) in Oakland.”\n\nAnother email to the mayor, sent on Sept. 21, stated: “You are a psychopath, and I’m going to torture and murder you.”\n\nLee and her staff deemed the threats credible and reported them to police.\n\n“Violence has no place in our city or our democracy,” the mayor said in a statement through her spokesperson on Tuesday. “Intimidation and hate will not silence Oakland public servants or the communities we represent.”\n\nIf the suspect posts bail, the conditions of his release forbid any contact with the mayor, including “personal, electronic, telephonic and written” communication. He must also stay 100 yards away from the mayor and Oakland City Hall, according to the out-of-custody conditions.\n\nThe emails were sent from an unnamed Google subscriber, but police were able to determine the account was Pokorny’s and a warrant was issued for his arrest, according to court records. He was arrested Oct. 7 by U.S. Marshals in Southern California.\n\nHe has refused to talk to investigators and pleaded not guilty at his Oct. 10 arraignment.\n\nElected in April, Lee took office in a year that has seen both a rise in political violence across the country and a high-profile campaign of retribution by President Donald Trump against his enemies.\n\nLee, a longtime progressive East Bay political icon, has not been shy in her criticisms of Trump, who in August named Oakland among the cities where he would consider deploying the National Guard to combat crime — though he has not actually ordered troops here.\n\nA former longtime congresswoman, Lee was on the floor of the House of Representatives on Jan. 6, 2021, when a mob of protesters attempted to break into the legislative chamber.\n\n“We will continue to do the people’s work,” her office said Tuesday, “regardless of circumstances.”","summary":"A man suspected of making death threats against Oakland Mayor Barbara Lee

drug boat off Venezuela kills six, Trump says","text":"A US strike on a boat off the coast of Venezuela has killed six suspected drug traffickers, US President Donald Trump says.\n\nThose who died in the strike were aboard the vessel and no US forces were harmed, Mr Trump said in a social media post on Tuesday, local time.\n\nIt is the fifth deadly strike in the Caribbean since the Trump administration began treating alleged drug traffickers as unlawful combatants who must be met with military force.\n\nDefense Secretary Pete Hegseth ordered the strike on Tuesday morning, Mr Trump said, as he released a video of the operation.\n\nMr Hegseth later shared the video in a post on X.\n\nMr Trump said the strike was conducted in international waters and \"intelligence\" had confirmed the vessel was trafficking narcotics.\n\nHe said the vessel was associated with \"narcoterrorist networks\" and was on a known drug-trafficking route.\n\nThe Pentagon did not immediately respond to an email from the Associated Press seeking more information on the latest boat strike, but a defence official confirmed the details in the social media post were accurate.\n\nCalls for legal justification of strikes\n\nFrustration with the Trump administration has been growing on Capitol Hill among members of both major political parties.\n\nSome Republicans are seeking more information from the White House on the legal justification and details of the strikes, while Democrats claim the strikes violate US and international law.\n\nThe Senate last week voted on a war powers resolution barring the Trump administration from conducting the strikes unless Congress specifically authorised them, but it failed to pass.\n\nIn a memo to Congress obtained by the Associated Press, the Trump administration said it had determined that the US was \"in a non-international armed conflict with these designated terrorist organisations\" and that Mr Trump directed the Pentagon to \"conduct operations against them pursuant to the law of armed conflict\".\n\nThe Trump administration had yet to provide underlying evidence to lawmakers proving the boats targeted by the US military were in fact carrying narcotics, according to two US officials familiar with the matter.\n\nThe strikes followed a build-up of US maritime forces in the Caribbean, unlike any seen in recent times.\n\nFollowing Tuesday's strike, Jorge Rodríguez, president of Venezuela's National Assembly and a close ally of President Nicolás Maduro, called on the press to combat US \"lies\" that were being used to justify a possible invasion.\n\n\"The objective is not the search for the truth and much less fighting drug trafficking,\" Mr Rodríguez said, adding it was about \"looking for the way to have an excuse for aggression\".","summary":"It is the fifth deadly strike in the Caribbean amid the Trump administration's crackdown on alleged drug

(AP pic)\nWASHINGTON: Decisions by most countries to not retaliate against US President Donald Trump's tariffs are among the top factors bolstering the global economy's resilience, IMF managing director Kristalina Georgieva said on Tuesday.\n\"The world, so far, and I cannot stress enough, so far, has opted not to retaliate and to continue to trade pretty much on the rules that have existed,\" Georgieva said during an event at the IMF and World Bank annual meetings in Washington, noting that this avoided debilitating tariff escalation.\nEarlier on Tuesday, the fund had edged up its 2025 global GDP growth forecast in its World Economic Outlook to 3.2% from a 3.0% forecast in July but warned that a renewed US-China trade war threatened by Trump could slow output significantly.\nAlso supporting global growth is that the effective US tariff rate has come down from prior estimates, Georgieva told the Bretton Woods Committee event.\nAfter calculating that Trump's tariffs announced in April would average 23%, the rate was reduced by US trade deals with the EU, Japan and other major partners to about 17.5%, she said.\n\"The effective tariff, though, what is being collected when you get exceptions to accommodate the need for the economy to function well, we calculate them somewhere between 9% and 10%, so the burden is more than twice less than we thought it would be,\" she added.\nOther factors propping up the global economy have been better policies by countries to boost private sector development and more efficient allocation of resources, as well as agility by companies to avoid the worst effects of the tariffs by front-loading imports and quickly rearranging supply chains.\nHowever, she said the resilience could also be tested by the stretched valuations in global markets – especially the tech sector, which has fuelled a stellar market rally this year.\n\"This is a bet, a very big bet,\" she said. \"If it pays back, fantastic, then our problem with low growth is gone, because we will see an increase in productivity and we will see an increase in growth.

Experts say political violence is bipartisan, with historically more attacks inspired by right-wing ideology.\nOfficials have found no evidence that the suspect in Kirk's shooting acted in concert with any group.\nThe ceremony drew a mix of top Republican lawmakers, media personalities and Trump allies, including vice president JD Vance, secretary of state Marco Rubio and US senators Ted Cruz, Mike Lee, and Rick Scott, as well as House of Representatives speaker Mike Johnson.\nA key figure in conservative politics, Kirk mobilised young voters for Trump's 2024 campaign.

Supporters hailed him as a champion of free speech, while critics argue he helped mainstream extremist views.\nSince his death, Trump has called Kirk a \"martyr for American freedom\" and vowed at his memorial service to carry on his work. In September, both the US House of Representatives and Senate approved resolutions declaring Oct 14 a \"National Day of Remembrance for Charlie Kirk.\"\nTrump also signed a proclamation on Tuesday declaring Oct 14, 2025 - on what would have been Kirk's 32nd birthday - as a \"National Day of Remembrance for Charlie Kirk.\"","summary":"Since his death, the US leader has called the slain activist a ‘martyr for American freedom’ and vowed to continue his work.","url":"https://www.freemalaysiatoday.com/category/world/2025/10/15/trump-awards-charlie-kirk-top-honour-amid-crackdown-on-left-wing-groups","image":"https://www.freemalaysiatoday.com/cdn-cgi/image/quality=80,format=auto,fit=scale-down,dpr=1,width=1600,height=1000/https://media.freemalaysiatoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/d69f10d9-charlie-kirk.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-10-15 00:22:28","author":"AFP","authors":["AFP"],"language":"en","source_country":"my","sentiment":0.111},{"id":369293706,"title":"Our dream retirement turned into a nightmare: British expats Christine and Eric Thompson were lured to Bulgaria by a slower pace of life and cheap cost of living....now they are desperate to leave","text":"Home and Garden\n\nLatest Headlines\n\nUniversity Guide\n\nPrivacy Policy\n\nWednesday, Oct 15th 2025\n\n5-Day Forecast\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHow Reform would crush all before them if election was held tomorrow: Explosive megapoll shows Nigel Farage set for the biggest Commons majority EVER with Tories reduced to just SEVEN MPs and Labour ministers culled\n\nReturn our dead!

The couple plan to leave Bulgaria as soon as their home sells \n'We walked into a restaurant, gave the waiters our order, waited half an hour with nothing and in the end we stood up and walked out again.'\nChristine said: 'When you move here you have a honeymoon period but then it changes, people have rose-tinted glasses and enjoy the slower pace of life but that quickly disappears.\n'The whole place seems to have a lack of direction. After taking an interest in what was happening in the country it became obvious that there is a lot of corruption which still exists.\n'In the nine years we have been here there have been frequent elections for parliament. All the governments that have been formed have been coalitions. As we all know any organisation takes on the traits of the people in charge.\n'It feels like a ship without a rudder, meandering along. In one year there were three elections for government. The country has no direction.'\nBut the couple say their biggest issue has been with the country's archaic healthcare system which has caused Christine lifelong health problems.\nWhen they first arrived in Bulgaria in 2016, Christine was taking Cordaron medication for an irregular heartbeat having had strict instructions to stop after six months - but three years later doctors were still insisting she take it.\nNow her prolonged use of the medication has caused damage to her heart and thyroid.\nThen in 2020 doctors switched her onto Xulthophy medication for type-2 diabetes, and four years later her body was 'shutting down'.\nChristine eventually paid to see a specialist doctor privately who finally prescribed her the correct medication but she continues to suffer from health problems including painful joints, inflammation of the bones and poor kidney function.\nShe said: 'We are getting out because the health care falls far short of the standards found in the west of Europe - twice now they have nearly killed me and I fear the third time they will.\n'I tried bitterly to get them to take me off the medication but when I flatly refused to take it they threw me out of the hospital.\n'It scarred my heart and the iodine in the Cordaron obliterated my thyroid and caused Hyperthyroidism, massive weight gain and metabolic issues.\n'Leaving the UK is fantastic but when things go wrong those rose tinted glasses come off pretty quickly.\n'People say how wonderful the healthcare is here but it's not - I spoke to a woman who told me the healthcare here has killed her husband through misdiagnosis.'\nShe continues to receive homeopathic treatment to deal with her high levels of Uric acid from the Cordaron.\nShe said: 'If I hadn't done this myself my kidneys would have failed now\n'It's completely wiped out my trust in doctors here.'\n\nSpeaking to The Daily Mail, Eric, 70, said: 'It's certainly a slower pace of life and the weather is well over 30 C. 'But the people are a different story, even in the beautiful weather they have faces like it's a wet Sunday'\n\n After becoming disillusioned with life in the UK and concerned about the falling job market Eric took early retirement from his job as a chartered mining engineer and self-employed Christine quit her hospitality business\n\nThey sold their home in Doncaster in 2005 and initially moved to Turkey after falling in love with the country during a two-week holiday. After a decade the horse-loving couple decided to move to find a permanent sanctuary for their animals and after discussing with friends they decided on Bulgaria\n\nChristine says she is far from alone; many other expats also have healthcare horror stories\nEric added: 'Their system is fully paper based and if you don't have all your paperwork with you they don't believe you.\n'You're hitting brick walls everywhere - all consultants do is look at your notes, they don't converse with one another.\n'It's soul destroying to deal with the archaic system.'\nChristine says she is far from alone; many other expats also have healthcare horror stories.\nShe added: 'A friend of ours has had a skin condition for 20 years that needed a specific cream.\n'When they first arrived they were able to get the right cream and everything was wonderful.

There's also research suggesting statins can cause swelling in the ankles.'\n\nDr Malhotra, who now serves as chief medical and scientific adviser to the new Make Europe Healthy Again movement, said he raised his concerns with two unnamed Trump cabinet ministers, both of whom were 'very concerned'.\n\nHe said they were now considering taking the concerns to the president directly. He also said that, should the president stop taking the statins, it was possible that his supposed issues could clear up within two to three weeks.\n\nTrump, the oldest president ever inaugurated, was declared in 'exceptional overall health' by his physician, Dr Sean Barbabella, last week after an impromptu health exam. He also received a flu and Covid booster shot and was told his 'cardiac age' was about 14 years younger than his real age.\n\nAt his physical in April, he was prescribed Rosuvastatin and Ezetimibe to lower cholesterol and reduce the risk of a heart attack or stroke. Both are taken once daily.\n\nIn July, the White House also disclosed that he suffers from chronic venous insufficiency, a condition affecting more than 25million Americans, which can cause ankle swelling.\n\nTrump has been gaffe-prone in recent months, and just this week called Canada's prime minister Mark Carney a 'president' and misstated that his presidency began in 2016. Some observers have pointed to his meandering speeches as signs of cognitive decline, though others note the immense stress and information load of the office.\n\nIn response to Dr Malhotra's comments, White House spokesman Kush Desai said: 'President Trump is a champion-level golfer with the mental acuity and energy levels that most young people could not fathom having. \n\n'So-called medical 'experts', especially foreign ones with no relevance or involvement in the administration, should stop beclowning themselves and marring their credibility by pitching their idiotic hot takes with Fake News outlets that have nothing better to cover.'\n\nDr Malhotra, who is set to present his argument at the European Parliament tomorrow during a MEHA launch event, has long argued against the use of statins, the most commonly prescribed drug in the US and taken by about 92million Americans daily.\n\nThe stance has drawn him criticism from numerous health bodies, including the British Heart Foundation, which has called his statements 'misleading and wrong'. \n\nDr Malhotra continued: 'I think Donald Trump is a remarkable man, and he is brilliant at what he does. But as a doctor, I want to make sure that he is being treated correctly and that his health is being optimized, including the medications that he is taking.\n\n'For me, President Trump is almost certainly going to get more harm than good from these statins.' \n\nHe continued: 'The statin benefit is that they have slightly anti-inflammatory and anti-clotting properties. And I'm not saying don't take statins.\n\n'They have a role to play, especially in people who have already established significant heart disease or have had a heart attack already. \n\n'But basically, most, almost everybody else, gets almost zero benefit and is subject to potential side effects which interfere with their quality of life.'\n\nMainstream physicians says guidance on whether to take statins should come from patients' doctors. People are urged not to stop taking statin medications without consulting their doctor.\n\nCommon side effects of resuvastatin, suffered by more than one in 100 users, include headaches, nausea and feeling weak or dizzy. But in 2012, the FDA added memory loss to the label as a possible side effect. In the update at the time, it said reports of memory problems in addition to someone taking the statin were 'rare' and 'reversible' once someone came off the drug.\n\nA 2015 study on 500,000 people prescribed a statin or other cholesterol-lowering drug found that those who took the drugs were nearly four times more likely to report memory loss right after starting the drug compared to those who did not take any kind of medication.\n\nFor ezetimibe, common side effects suffered by more than one in 100 people include feeling more tired than usual and stomach or abdominal pain. The drug has not been linked to memory loss or swelling except in allergic reactions. \n\nStatins slash the production of cholesterol in the body, which doctors say helps to slow the build-up of plaque on the walls of arteries or veins, which can become dislodged and block blood vessels, causing a heart attack or stroke.\n\nDr Malhotra questioned whether Trump was getting any benefit from statins, pointing to a 2016 peer-reviewed study in the British Medical Journal, where he is named as one of the authors, which found that people who had high levels of 'bad' cholesterol live as long as those with lower levels of the substance.\n\nHe also mentioned a second study from 2019, which found that among those aged 75 years or older, such as the president, 446 people in the age group had to take a statin routinely for one to have a benefit.\n\nAnd a third study, where he was one of the three authors in 2020, which reviewed 35 trials and concluded that statins 'did not confer any additional benefit' to patients. \n\nDr Malhotra also questioned Trump's use of aspirin, a medication taken by about one in four older adults at least three times a week to prevent a heart attack, saying this also would not benefit the president.\n\n'With someone like Trump,' said Dr Malhotra, 'he is much more likely to suffer a serious bleed, a life-threatening bleed, from being on aspirin than the chances of it preventing him suffering from a heart attack or stroke'.\n\nDr Malhotra, who has railed against the Covid mRNA vaccines, also said it was not necessary for Trump to receive the shot at his next appointment.","summary":"An adviser to RFK Jnr has broken cover to reveal a chilling theory about the state of Donald Trump's health.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-15191945/RFK-Jnr-adviser-chilling-theory-Trumps-health.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/10/14/22/102989203-0-image-m-22_1760476305501.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-10-15 00:17:47","author":"Editor,Luke Andrews Senior","authors":["Editor","Luke Andrews Senior"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.142},{"id":369294500,"title":"The next global economic earthquake is set to strike and Britain is completely unprepared. I fear for all of us - and Labour's Budget plans are going to make things worse: ALEX BRUMMER","text":"When Rachel Reeves swept into Washington to attend her first meeting of the International Monetary Fund one year ago, she was in a bright, confident mood.\n\nThe Tories had been banished after 14 years in power, the economy was growing once again, inflation was in retreat and the Labour Chancellor had a plan to fix the public finances in her first Budget.\n\nWhen Reeves returned to Washington yesterday, she was wearing the mask of bravado. There was even a spurious claim from the Labour spin machine that she was coming ‘to fly the flag for the UK as a beacon of stability and growth’.\n\nYet nothing could be further from the truth. Reeves’ early pledges to ‘fix the foundations’ of the British economy have subsided – and badly.\n\nLast year’s £40 billion tax-raising Budget destroyed confidence and jobs, increased inflation and left a ‘black hole’ in our finances even greater than the one the Government claimed to have inherited from the Tories.\n\nThe Chancellor’s refrain that she would never take the risks the Conservatives took with the economy has proved hollow. The bond markets – where governments borrow the money they need to keep going day to day – are on red alert.\n\nLabour seeks to convince us that it has made Britain a great place to invest. But our own leading-edge pharmaceutical companies, AstraZeneca and GlaxoSmithKline, are pouring tens of billions of pounds into America instead, thanks not least to the harmful levies placed by British governments on their products.\n\nThe latest economic projections from the IMF show a British economy that is now misfiring badly.\n\nLabour’s vainglorious goal to make the United Kingdom the fastest-growing among the Group of Seven rich Western states has not been achieved. Growth is stalling. Britain’s stuttering output will lag well behind that of Donald Trump’s America this year and in 2026 it will fall behind Canada, too.\n\nAll that mumbo-jumbo about helping working people is backfiring. The latest Labour market data from the Office for National Statistics show that Labour is not working. On the contrary, unemployment is rising.\n\nThe number of people on British payrolls has plummeted by 276,000 since Reeves’ output-crushing Budget last October. Ten thousand jobs have been lost in the course of the past three gruelling months alone.\n\nThe unemployment rate has shot up from 4.4 per cent when Labour took office to 4.9 per cent now.\n\nIt’s one of Labour’s favourite boasts that disposable income – the amount of cash ordinary Britons have to spend – has risen by £800 per household since it took over.\n\nBut this is hardly surprising given the way Labour gave in to union demands for inflation-busting pay increases, particularly in the public sector, without any call for productivity gains in return.\n\nAnd now the chickens are coming home to roost. Inflation in the UK remains stubbornly high. Britain and Mexico are cited by the IMF as the two major economies which stand out for failing to get a grip on consumer prices.\n\nWe must also face the consequences of Labour’s actions since it came to power, most notably the Chancellor’s hike in employers’ National Insurance. This additional cost – and the inflation it helped create – means that hopes for a much-needed fall in interest rates are fading fast. That, in turn, is an enormous blow both to a stuttering housing market and to business investment in general – two key drivers of growth.\n\nWith Labour’s manifesto plans in chaos – and as Britain awaits further debilitating tax increases in next month’s Budget – the party’s brightest star, Health Secretary Wes Streeting, has had the temerity to blame Brexit for our economic woes.\n\nYet there has never been a better moment for Britain to be disconnected from a trading bloc which is not only moribund but faces insurmountable economic, financial and political challenges.\n\nThe Brussels bureaucracy is smothering much-needed efforts to reform Europe’s financial markets. The German economy, long viewed as Europe’s locomotive, is stalling badly. The political impossibility of making budget cuts has plunged France into the worst constitutional crisis of the Fifth Republic, a mess which makes Liz Truss’s short-lived sojourn in Downing Street look like a vicarage tea party.\n\nBritain, despite all its problems, has been free to sign trade deals with some of the fastest-growing regions in the world.\n\nWhen she was Business Secretary in the last government, Kemi Badenoch – now Tory leader – signed us up to the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP). This vast agreement covers five continents and 600 million people, stretching from Singapore to Peru.\n\nThanks to Brexit, Labour has concluded the first trade deal with the United States and has recently secured another with India. Such wide-ranging agreements would have been far harder to secure had we remained part of the EU.\n\nBy waiting until November 26 to hold her second Budget, Reeves is clearly hoping, like Charles Dickens’ Wilkins Micawber, that ‘something will turn up’. Yet the long run-up created by the Chancellor has been deeply destabilising.\n\nLabour’s threat to impose a levy on pension pots – by limiting the size of the sums which can be withdrawn tax-free – has already seen money flow out of the investment market at record-breaking rates.\n\nAnd the looming possibility that Reeves will impose a wealth tax is already encouraging rich entrepreneurs and bankers to move to jurisdictions with more lenient rules. Milan is proving popular.\n\nToday, as she arrives in Washington, a Chancellor once so confident that she had all the answers has been found out.\n\nShe must know that another round of tax increases can only be a self-defeating exercise in shattering confidence and shredding jobs. It would add to the nation’s burgeoning welfare bill and trap us in a ‘doom loop’ – an ever-diminishing economy demanding ever-rising taxation to keep it alive.\n\nThere is something rotten at the heart of Labour’s budgetary incontinence. And when the next global earthquake strikes, we will be ill-equipped to withstand the forces of destruction.","summary":"Reeves' pledges to 'fix the foundations' of the British economy have subsided.

including Donald Trump - have voiced support for taking tougher action against Russia aircraft violating alliance airspace.\n\nHowever, several member states remain wary that such a move could risk direct confrontation with the Kremlin.\n\nGeneral Alexus Grynkewich, NATO's Supreme Allied Commander Europe, has privately pushed for a 'unified, single air and missile defence system' to streamline the alliance's response to potential Russian provocations, sources say.\n\nThe proposal would strip away so-called 'national caveats' - the differing national rules that currently govern how each country's pilots can engage threats - and hand NATO's top general greater freedom to respond decisively.\n\nAt present, member states operate under widely varying rules of engagement.\n\nSome require pilots to visually confirm targets before opening fire, while others permit action based purely on radar data.\n\nThe inconsistencies have prompted behind-the-scenes debate about what conditions would justify shooting down a Russian jet over NATO territory.\n\nLast month, the alliance was forced to hold two emergency Article 4 meetings following Russian incursions in Estonia and Poland.\n\nIn one incident, three Russian MG fighter jets entered Estonian airspace, prompting Italian F-35s to scramble in response.\n\nThe Russian planes were ordered to leave and escorted to international airspace in what insiders describes as a 'textbook' response. \n\nGeneral Grynkewich decided against authorising weapons fire after intelligence reports showed the MiGs were armed only with air-to-air missiles and had made no attempt to target NATO fighters. \n\nHowever, NATO officials have discussed scenarios in which such aircraft could be shot down - for instance, if they carried air-to-surface weapons or followed an aggressive flight path.\n\nAnother challenge facing General Grynkewich is the patchwork of overlapping air-defence operations currently active on NATO's eastern flank. \n\nThree separate missions - Eastern Sentry, launched after Russian drone violations over Poland, Baltic Sentry, operating since January, and the alliance's Ukraine training mission - all have their own air-defence components. \n\nDozens of NATO countries contribute to these missions, each with its own rules of engagement.\n\nA senior diplomat described the arrangement as a bureaucratic 'headache' for the Supreme Commander.\n\nGermany, Spain, and Italy are said to be among the more cautious nations in the alliance, despite playing significant roles in these operations.\n\n'Trying to create a more unified, single, integrated air and missile defence system makes sense, and in order for him to do that, he needs to get rid of as many national caveats as possible,' one senior NATO diplomat told The Telegraph. \n\n'We all have to look sharply and critically at whether those caveats still make sense.' \n\nDefence ministers will also consider merging the three air-defence mission to give General Grynkewich more operational flexibility.\n\nNATO Secretary General Mark Rutte said the plans would 'further strengthen our deterrence and defence posture, including in light of recent incidents'.\n\nEstonia - backed by other Baltic nations - is leading calls for NATO's existing air-policing missions to be upgraded to full air-defence operations.\n\nBu several countries are pushing back, arguing that such a move should be reserved for wartime conditions since it would involve closing civilian airspace and authorising the downing of any Russian jet that enters without warning.\n\nRaimond Kaljulaid, who chairs Estonia's delegation to NATO's parliamentary assembly, dismissed that cautious approach.\n\nHe said that if force is only used when there is a direct military threat, then this is a sign of weakness, as 'you are in effect saying that under certain conditions violations of our airspace will have no consequences'.\n\n'Instead, our public position should be that we have the right to respond in a manner that we see fit and Russia should know that perhaps next time our reaction will be something else,' he added.\n\n'This idea that our reaction is dependent on the way the Russians are acting – threatening or not – could basically imply that you can also drive a tank across the border if it poses no immediate threat. Of course that is ridiculous. We either have borders or we don't.'\n\nIn June alone, NATO aircraft including F-35s and F-16s were deployed 29 times to intercept Russian activity over the Baltic Sea, according to Denmark's military.\n\nMeanwhile, Moscow appears to be escalating its war preparations.\n\nA new Russian law expected to pass parliament this week will allow up to two million military reservists to be mobilised for combat in Ukraine - even during peacetime.\n\nThe amendment sidesteps the need to declare martial law, potentially sparing the Kremlin another unpopular mobilisation drive like the one in September 2022, which sent tens of thousands of men fleeing the country. \n\nBritain, meanwhile, is ramping up support for Ukraine. \n\nDefence Secretary John Healey will tell NATO allies in Brussels that the UK has already delivered 85,000 drones this year - and expects to exceed its target of 100,000.\n\nHe will reveal that London has invested £600million to speed up drone production and delivery to Kyiv, urging allies to 'ramp up drone production to outmatch Putin's escalation.'\n\nMr Healey will also confirm that RAF Typhoons will continue flying under NATO's Eastern Sentry mission for the remainder of the year, at minimum.","summary":"According to a source briefed on the close-door discussions, the 'weaponry and trajectory' of an aircraft would determine whether it poses a threat.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-15192905/Nato-talks-new-rules-make-easier-shoot-Russian-drones.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/10/15/00/102032713-0-Up_to_four_of_the_19_Russian_drones_were_shot_down_by_Polish_and-a-58_1760485891874.jpg","video":"https://videos.dailymail.co.uk/video/mol/2025/09/10/5787069326748596548/1024x576_MP4_5787069326748596548.mp4","publish_date":"2025-10-15 00:15:12","author":"Editor,Taryn Pedler","authors":["Editor","Taryn Pedler"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":0.068},{"id":369294276,"title":"Republican lawmakers demand Treasury probe CAIR over alleged Hamas ties and terrorism concerns","text":"Rep. Elise Stefanik, R-N.Y., and Sen. Tom Cotton, R-Ark., are pressing Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent to investigate the Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR), claiming that it may be funded or directed by Hamas or other terrorist groups. CAIR describes itself as a Muslim civil rights and advocacy organization founded in 1994 with chapters across the U.S. The request comes as President Donald Trump led a ceasefire in Gaza between Hamas and Israel. Stefanik and Cotton allege CAIR’s historic ties, public rhetoric and activism raise questions about whether the group’s support for Hamas amounts to material support for terrorism. STEFANIK ASKS AG BONDI TO PROBE MEDICAL CHARITY OVER HAMAS PROPAGANDA CLAIMS The Treasury Department’s Office of Foreign Assets Control, which enforces U.S. sanctions on terrorist groups and their affiliates, has the authority to investigate whether CAIR’s activities violate federal law, the lawmakers said. CAIR has long denied accusations of supporting Hamas, saying it \"does not support any foreign organization or government\" and calling such claims \"false and Islamophobic,\" according to a statement on its website. The group says its mission is to advocate for Muslim civil rights in the U.S. Stefanik chairs the House Republican Conference, and Cotton sits on the Senate Armed Services Committee. Both have pressed for stricter enforcement of anti-terror finance laws in past oversight efforts. DHS PULLS FUNDING FROM GROUPS WITH ‘ALLEGED TERRORIST TIES’ AFTER WATCHDOG REPORT In July, Stefanik criticized the City University of New York for hiring a former CAIR employee.

Email tips@dailymail.co.uk\nBy MARTIN ROBINSON, CHIEF REPORTER \n Published:01:07 BST, 15 October 2025 |Updated:01:11 BST, 15 October 2025 \n\nKaty Perry's romance with Justin Trudeau is 'genuine' but could be a poor decision for her career because he is so 'polarising'.\nThe Daily Mail revealed the unlikely relationship with pictures showing the new couple kissing and cuddling on the deck of her 24-meter yacht, the Caravelle, off the coast of Santa Barbara, California.\nAnd on Monday night Katy, hours after a brutal dig from Trudeau's ex-wife, said she used to go for British men but 'not anymore' in tacit confirmation that she and Canada's former prime minister are lovers.\n'No one saw this coming but I think it's genuine', a source said of the new A-list couple, adding: 'But she isn't the best judge of character, from an optics point of view'.\nThe Daily Mail's insider, who has links to both camps, warned that while her new man is making her happy it could be the wrong move for her career.\nIn the past year, following a stellar career that began with global hit 'I Kissed a Girl' in 2008, she has suffered disappointing ticket sales for her ongoing Lifetimes Tour. Katy's decision to take part in Blue Origin's all-female space flight in April 2025, was also written off by many as a 'tone deaf' and expensive PR stunt.\nHer shows at the 02 in London were not sold out and there were spaces in every area of the arena for her gig on Tuesday. At some venues during the US leg of the tour earlier this year up to 70% of seats remained unsold.\n\nKaty Perry and Justin Trudeau in a clinch while on her yacht off the coast of California\n\nKaty Perry broke her silence on her romance with Justin Trudeau as she made a cheeky onstage comment during her London concert at The O2 Arena on Monday\n The Mail's source said: 'She has received negative publicity in the past year from her album and association with Dr Luke'.\nThe writer and producer was sued by US singer Kesha who accused him of drugging and raping her. He's counter-sued and called the allegations 'completely untrue and deeply hurtful.' They settled out of court in 2023.\nJustin Trudeau stepped down as Canada's PM in January this year having been the longest serving leader in the G7.\nBut his handling of the pandemic and Donald Trump, a series of ethics scandals as well as liberal policies on benefits and gender meant his days were numbered after nine years in power.\nWhen he finally quit his disapproval rating amongst voters had reached almost 75 per cent. \n'Justin has become a polarising character and his popularity has diminished a lot', the Mail's insider said.\n'Katy is wowing fans around the world with her show and is beginning to win back public favour - but her association with Justin is taking away from her positive pr and she's up again being negatively spoken about'.\nJustin split from his wife Sophie in August 2023 after 18 years of marriage. They have two sons, Xavier, 18, and Hadrien, 11, and a daughter, Ella-Grace, 16. \nKaty, who has a five-year-old daughter, Daisy Dove Bloom, split from Pirates of the Caribbean star Orlando Bloom earlier this year. \nShe was previously married to comedian Russell Brand from 2010 until 2012. \nThe singer broke her silence on her romance with Justin Trudeau as she made a cheeky onstage comment during her London concert at The O2 Arena last night.\nThe Daily Mail revealed how she was seen kissing and cuddling Justin on her 24-meter yacht, the Caravelle, off the coast of Santa Barbara, California\nLast night on stage in front of thousands of fans \nSpeaking on stage Katy, 40, said: 'London, England, you're like this on a Monday night after a whole day at work and a whole day at school?\n'No wonder I fall for Englishmen all the time… but not anymore.'\nThe singer also received a surprise marriage proposal from a fan during the show but had to turn it down.\nShe laughed: 'I wish you'd asked me 48 hours ago.'\n\n@charl_robbins \na live proposal at @Katy Perry the lifetimes tour, london night 1. sorry darren, you’re just the one who got away ❤️‍🩹 #katyperry #lifetimestour #lifetimestourlondon @The O2♬ original sound - charlotte \n\nThe pop star, who over the weekend was seen kissing Justin on her 24-meter yacht, in California, took to the stage on her Lifetimes world tour when she addressed the crowd\n\nKaty and hunky former Canadian Prime Minister Trudeau, 53, kicked off speculation about a budding romance in July when they were spotted having an intimate dinner at Le Violon restaurant in Montreal, just weeks after she announced her split from fiancé Orlando Bloom, 48. \nAll fell silent… at least until this weekend when exclusive pictures obtained by the Daily Mail showed the couple kissing and cuddling aboard Katy's yacht. \nA witness who took the snaps last month, said: 'She pulled up her boat next to a small public whale-watching boat, then they started making out. I didn't realize who she was with until I saw the tattoo on the guy's arm and I immediately realized it was Justin Trudeau.'\nFollowing the steamy moment, Justin's ex-wife Sophie shared a mysterious message about 'letting go' of love in a new social media post.\nTelevision host Sophie, 50, spoke about the art of not holding on to love in a new Instagram post uploaded on Monday.\n'Sometimes we forget that nothing we love is ever meant to be kept,' she said.\n'The people, the places, even the moments that once felt infinite, right?\n'Time asks us not to cling to them, but yet we do.

I lost my dad in the past year, and I feel that with grief also comes grace.\n'So maybe, love's deepest teaching is this: to stand open hearted in the face of impermanence. We honor what has been and to trust that letting go is also a form of keeping inside us where no loss can erase it in a way.'\nJustin TrudeauCanadaCaliforniaLondon\n\nShare or comment on this article: \nKaty Perry 'isn't the best judge of character': Why popstar's relationship with Justin Trudeau is the wrong move for her career as pair finally go public with their romance\n\nAdd comment\n\n Share what you think\n\nWorst rated\n\nThe comments below have not been moderated.\n\nThe views expressed in the contents above are those of our users and do not necessarily reflect the views of MailOnline.\n\nAdd your comment\n\nEnter your comment\n\nBy posting your comment you agree to our house rules.\n\nSubmit Comment\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual.\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual\n\nWe will automatically post your comment and a link to the news story to your Facebook timeline at the same time it is posted on MailOnline.

Email tips@dailymail.co.uk\nBy CODIE BULLEN, SENIOR SHOWBUSINESS REPORTER \n Published:01:05 BST, 15 October 2025 |Updated:01:07 BST, 15 October 2025 \n\nProfessor Green has admitted that he 'very nearly' called off his wedding to Millie Mackintosh.\nThe musician, 41, has rarely spoken about his two-year marriage to The Made In Chelsea star, 35, which ended in divorce in 2016. \nBut during an appearance on Jamie Laing's Great Company podcast, he shared that they both felt 'pressured' to get married, and he almost called off the wedding. \nThe rapper revealed he's now back in touch with his 'beautiful' ex-wife and reflects on their 'trauma bond' over undiagnosed ADHD.\nHe told the host: 'If there wasn't that pressure, we may have never got married. It very nearly didn't happen. \n'I remember having a conversation with my two best mates, Lewis and Phoenix. Am I getting cold feet? What's going on here? And one of them said yes. One of them said, No. I won't put him in it, because it's not their responsibility. \n\nProfessor Green has admitted that he 'very nearly' called off his wedding to Millie Mackintosh\n'I made my own decision. We made our decision, and we didn't get married for the wrong reasons. We loved each other.\n'It was probably an element of trauma bonding. And it takes a lot to get to a place of going, \"I had a significant part in that, 50% at least, because there were two of us in the situation, and it didn't work out.\"\n'But hopefully we can both go forward and find happiness and belonging.'\nMillie previously admitted that she knew before her lavish 2013 nuptials at Babington House in Somerset that the relationship 'wasn't right but I was too scared to call it off because of the shame of letting everyone down.'\nMillie and Green finalised their divorce in May 2016, the same week that Millie chose to go public with Hugo Taylor, her former Made In Chelsea co-star boyfriend.\nThey got engaged on the Greek island of Mykonos the following year, and tied the knot in Sussex in June 2018. They welcomed daughter Sienna in 2020 and daughter Aurelia the following year.\nProfessor Green went on to explain that they have recently got back in touch to support each other and reflect on their undiagnosed ADHD.\nHe said: 'There was undiagnosed neurodivergence between both of us. We had a conversation about this recently, and it makes sense.'\n\nThe musician, 41, has rarely spoken about his two-year marriage to The Made In Chelsea star, 35, which ended in divorce in 2016\n\nDuring an appearance on Jamie Laing's Great Company podcast, he shared that they both felt 'pressured' to get married, and he almost called off the wedding\n\n Millie Mackintosh speaks out on her 'toxic' marriage to Professor Green \nBeing open about his ADHD diagnosis, he added: 'I don't feel uncomfortable about these things anymore, but I felt uncomfortable for a huge part of my life.'\n Pro Green has made no secret of his health battles. Earlier this year he revealed he was born with Pyloric Stenosis.\nThe condition affects babies between birth and six months of age when the passage between the stomach and small bowel becomes narrower.\nIt very rarely occurs in adults and may develop due to an attributable cause.\nThe musician revealed that his recurring dysbiosis - unbalanced bacteria that irritates the stomach - had worsened the condition.\nJust two months he revealed he caught roseola from his baby boy Slimane - after managing to avoid the virus throughout his own childhood.\nSharing a snap of himself in bed recovering from the common viral infection, he told his followers: 'The one adult who didn't get Roseola as a kid obviously had to have a son who did and now...'\nRoseola - also known as exanthem subitum or sixth disease - is a common viral infection that primarily affects young children.\n\nPro Green has made no secret of his health battles - earlier this year he revealed he was born with Pyloric Stenosis and shared a snap feeling under weather after he caught roseola from his baby boy, Slimane - after managing to avoid the virus throughout his own childhood\n\nSymptoms typically include a sudden high fever, followed by a rash as the fever subsides. Though uncomfortable, the illness is usually mild and resolves within a week.\nIn March 2021, the rapper welcomed his first child with girlfriend Karima McAdams.\nAnnouncing the news on Instagram, he shared that his partner, 40, had given birth to their son, Slimane Ray Manderson, two weeks early.\nIn a lengthy caption alongside the shot of his newborn son's head, he also detailed their difficult pregnancy, which he branded 'a rollercoaster' and confessed during 'scare after scare' they feared their baby 'would not make it'.\nFollowing his post, he was swiftly congratulated by his 865,000 Instagram followers, with many of his celebrity pals sending well-wishes.\n\nWHAT IS ADHD?\n\nAttention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is a behavioural condition defined by inattentiveness, hyperactivity and impulsiveness.\nIt affects around five per cent of children in the US. Some 3.6 per cent of boys and 0.85 per cent of girls suffer in the UK. \nSymptoms typically appear at an early age and become more noticeable as a child grows. These can also include:\n\nConstant fidgeting \nPoor concentration\nExcessive movement or talking\nActing without thinking\nInability to deal with stress \nLittle or no sense of danger \nCareless mistakes\nMood swings\nForgetfulness \nDifficulty organising tasks\nContinually starting new tasks before finishing old ones\nInability to listen or carry out instructions \nMost cases are diagnosed between six and 12 years old. Adults can also suffer, but there is less research into this.\nADHD's exact cause is unclear but is thought to involve genetic mutations that affect a person's brain function and structure.\nPremature babies and those with epilepsy or brain damage are more at risk. \nADHD is also linked to anxiety, depression, insomnia, Tourette's and epilepsy. \nThere is no cure. \nA combination of medication and therapy is usually recommended to relieve symptoms and make day-to-day life easier. \nSource: NHS Choices \n\nShare or comment on this article: \nProfessor Green admits he 'very nearly' called off his wedding to Millie Mackintosh - as he reveals he's now back in touch with his 'beautiful' ex-wife and reflects on their 'trauma bond' over undiagnosed ADHD\n\nAdd comment\n\n Share what you think\n\nNo comments have so far been submitted.

Trump stressed that the upcoming elections were “very important” and “being watched by the world.”\n\n“Victory is very important; it is very important to know who is going to win the election, whether it will be a socialist or not,” Trump said.\n\nIf a “socialist or a communist” were to win the upcoming Oct. 26 elections (or in 2027), the US would “feel differently about making an investment” and “will not be generous with Argentina,” he added during a working meeting with the Argentine head of State and both leaders' teams at the White House.\n\nHowever, the one-on-one sit-down at the Oval Office announced by Argentine diplomatic sources never took place. In Buenos Aires circles, Foreign Minister Gerardo Werthein's future could hang in the balance.\n\nTrump explicitly warned that US financial support for Argentina was conditional on the country's political direction. He also expressed strong disapproval of any potential military agreement with China, particularly regarding military bases in Patagonia.\n\n“If Milei does not win the election, I know that the person who would be running in 2027 is a far-left communist responsible for leading the country into this problem in the first place. If that happens, then we will not be generous with Argentina,” Trump forecast.\n\n“Great meeting today with Javier Milei! He is doing the right things for his Country. I hope the people of Argentina understand how good a job he is doing, and will support his work during the upcoming Midterms, so we can continue to help him achieve Argentina’s incredible potential. Javier Milei has my Complete and Total Endorsement — He will not let you down. MAKE ARGENTINA GREAT AGAIN!” he also posted on social media.\n\nMilei thanked Trump for his support for the “free world” against the “threat of 21st-century socialism.” He was also grateful to Secretary of the Treasury Scott Bessent for helping to overcome Argentina's liquidity problem, which he attributed to “political attacks... from our opponents.”\n\n”I want to thank Secretary (Scott) Bessent for his tremendous work in helping to overcome Argentina's liquidity problem as a result of the political attacks we received from our opponents, who do not want Argentina to embrace the ideas of freedom but rather outdated ideas that lead to socialism,“ Milei pointed out.\n\n”Honored to participate in @POTUS meeting with President @JMilei to discuss how Argentina can be Great Again by embracing economic freedom. President Milei has given Argentina a chance to end a decades-long decline under Peronism, and we hope Argentina seizes the opportunity under his leadership,” Bessent wrote on X.\n\nThe Argentine president was also scheduled to participate in the ceremony honoring Charlie Kirk, the activist who was murdered on September 10 in Utah, and then fly back to Buenos Aires, where he is due on Wednesday morning.","summary":"US President Donald Trump said on Tuesday that his country's help to Argentina hinged on Javier Milei's La Libertad Avanza (LLA) winning the upcoming midterms, followed by reelection in 2027.

'I love the people of Boston and I know the games are sold out. But your mayor is not good.'\n\nHe suggested 'they're taking over parts of Boston' without offering details, but added 'we could get them back in about two seconds.'\n\nThe Trump administration has already deployed National Guard troops to Washington and Memphis, and efforts to do so in Chicago and Portland, Oregon, have sparked legal fights.\n\nWu's office did not immediately respond to a message from the Associated Press seeking comment.\n\nTrump's comments came during his meeting with Argentina President Javier Milei and it wasn't immediately clear what he was referring to by parts of Boston having been seized.\n\nEarlier this month, however, there were multiple arrests in connection with a pro-Palestinian protest that turned violent on Boston Common. Four police officers were injured.\n\nTrump has previously suggested he could declare cities 'not safe' for the 104-game soccer tournament and alter a detailed hosting plan that FIFA confirmed in 2022.\n\nIt includes games at NFL stadiums near New York, Los Angeles and San Francisco.\n\nWorld Cup host sites aren't up to Trump, however.

Trump said Infantino 'wouldn't love to do it, but he'd do it very easily.","summary":"Trump has threatened to relocate World Cup matches set to be played in the city's suburbs next year, after suggesting that parts of the city had been 'taken over' by unrest.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-15193007/Trump-Boston-World-Cup-Michelle-Wu.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/10/15/00/102993459-0-image-m-12_1760485809180.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-10-15 00:00:53","author":"Editor,Max Winters","authors":["Editor","Max Winters"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.277},{"id":369292758,"title":"Trump honors Charlie Kirk with Presidential Medal of Freedom on what would be his 32nd birthday (World)","text":"President Donald Trump on Tuesday posthumously awarded America's highest civilian honor to Charlie Kirk, the assassinated activist who inspired a generation of young conservatives and helped push the nation's politics further to the right.\n\nReceiving the award on Kirk's behalf was his widow, Erika. Her voice cracking and often falling to a whisper as she wiped away tears, Erika Kirk talked about her late husband's life, political beliefs and legacy.\n\n“Thank you, Mr. President, for honoring my husband, in such a profound and meaningful way. And thank you for making this event a priority,\" she said. “Your support of our family and the work that Charlie devoted his life to will be something I cherish forever.”\n\nThe ceremony coincided with what would have been Kirk’s 32nd birthday. It came about a month after the Turning Point USA founder was fatally shot while speaking to a crowd at Utah Valley University.\n\nIn a sign of Kirk's close ties to the administration, he was the first recipient of the Presidential Medal of Freedom in Trump’s second term. The president also spoke at Kirk’s funeral in September, calling him a “great American hero” and “martyr” for freedom, while Vice President JD Vance accompanied his body home to Arizona on Air Force Two along with Erika Kirk.\n\n“We’re here to honor and remember a fearless warrior for liberty, beloved leader who galvanized the next generation like nobody I’ve ever seen before, and an American patriot of the deepest conviction, the finest quality and the highest caliber,\" Trump said during the medal ceremony.\n\nOf Kirk's killing, the president said, “He was assassinated in the prime of his life for boldly speaking the truth, for living his faith and relentless fighting for a better and stronger America.\"\n\nThe Presidential Medal of Freedom was established by President John F. Kennedy in 1963 for individuals making exceptional contributions “to the security or national interests of the United States, world peace, cultural or other significant public or private endeavors.”\n\nTrump returned to the U.S. in the pre-dawn hours Tuesday after a whirlwind trip to Israel and Egypt to celebrate a ceasefire agreement in Israel's war with Hamas in Gaza that his administration was instrumental in brokering. The president joked that he almost requested to reschedule the ceremony because of the trip.\n\n“I raced back halfway around the globe,\" Trump said. “I was going to call Erika and say, ‘Erika, could you maybe move it to Friday?' And I didn’t have the courage to call. But you know why I didn’t call? Because I heard today was Charlie’s birthday.”\n\nArgentine President Javier Milei, who had been visiting with the president at the White House earlier, stayed on to attend the ceremony.\n\nTrump has awarded a string of presidential medals going back to his first term, including to golf legend Tiger Woods, ex-football coach Lou Holtz and conservative economist Arthur Laffer as well as to Yankees Hall of Fame closer Mariano Rivera and conservative radio host Rush Limbaugh, the latter of which came during the 2020 State of the Union. He awarded posthumous medals to Babe Ruth and Elvis Presley.\n\nThis term, Trump has also announced his intentions to award the medals to Rudy Giuliani, the former New York City mayor and a close former adviser, and to Ben Carson, who served as Trump's first-term secretary of Housing and Urban Development.\n\nKirk founded Turning Point USA in 2012 and Trump praised him as one of the key reasons he was reelected last year.\n\nBut Kirk's politics were also often divisive. He sharply criticized gay and transgender rights while inflaming racial tensions. Kirk also repeated Trump’s false claims that former Vice President Kamala Harris was responsible for policies that encouraged immigrants to come to the U.S. illegally and called George Floyd, a Black man whose killing by a Minneapolis police officer sparked a national debate over racial injustice, a “scumbag.”\n\nAs Tuesday's ceremony was underway, the Trump administration said it had revoked the visas of six foreigners who U.S. officials deemed had made derisive or mocking comments about Kirk’s assassination. The six who had their visas revoked were from Argentina, Brazil, Germany, Mexico, Paraguay and South Africa.\n\nThe move comes as the Trump administration and its supporters have zeroed in on people who made critical comments about Kirk, leading to firings and other discipline.\n\nTrump wrote in a social media post hours before it started that he was moving the ceremony from the White House’s East Room to the Rose Garden to accommodate a crowd he said would be “so big and enthusiastic.”\n\nTrump paved over the grass there and put in a patio area, and talked happily about the medal ceremony being one of the first major events in the new space. He noted how the weather had cleared up after it was expected to be raining, saying: “I was telling Erika, God was watching. And he didn’t want that for Charlie.”\n\nKirk’s widow said she asked their 3-year-old daughter what she might have given her father for his birthday, and she responded a stuffed animal and a cupcake while saying he hoped he'd get a birthday surprise. Erika Kirk said her husband was sometimes hard to buy presents for, but the medal was the perfect gift.\n\nErika Kirk said her husband might one day have run for president \"but not out of ambition. He would only have done it if that was something that he believed that his country needed from his servant’s heart.”\n\nShe said God began a “mighty work” through her husband, and she intends to see it through. She finished her remarks by saying Charlie’s story reminds us that “to live free is the greatest gift but to die free is the greatest victory.”","summary":"President Donald Trump on Tuesday posthumously awarded America's highest civilian honor to Charlie Kirk, the assassinated activist who inspired a generation of young conservatives and helped push the nation's politics further to the right.

The graphic scene unfolded just hours after President Donald Trump declared an “end of an age of terror and death” and signed a 20-point peace plan aimed at stabilizing the region. The terror group claimed the victims were “criminals and collaborators with Israel,” though no evidence was provided. Among those executed was Ahmad Zidan al-Tarabin, reportedly involved in recruiting agents for a rival, non-Hamas militia, according to Israeli outlet ynet News. Following the withdrawal of Israeli Defense Forces (IDF), Hamas has aggressively moved to reassert control over Gaza. The group is targeting powerful family-based armed clans such as the Doghmoush, Popular Force, Al-Majayda, and Hellis, which gained strength during the recent conflict. Tensions erupted violently over the weekend when Hamas security forces clashed with the Doghmoush clan. Reports indicate at least 52 clan members and 12 Hamas fighters, including the son of senior official Bassem Naim, were killed. Hamas militants allegedly used ambulances to storm the clan’s neighborhood, accusing them of collaboration with Israel. One clan member’s daughter described the attacks as a “massacre,” with houses burned and people dragged away amidst screams. President Trump, while traveling to the Middle East, indicated he had given Hamas temporary approval to manage internal security in Gaza “as it sees fit,” aiming to facilitate the return of remaining Israeli hostages. “They do want to stop the problems, and they’ve been open about it,” Trump said, adding, “You have close to 2 million people going back to buildings that have been demolished, and a lot of bad things can happen. So we want it to be safe.” Despite these remarks, Trump also warned on Tuesday that the US “will disarm” Hamas if it refuses to lay down arms in accordance with his peace plan, which offers amnesty to members who commit to peaceful coexistence and decommission their weapons. Meanwhile, the executions and ongoing clan clashes underscore a violent power struggle within Gaza, as Hamas seeks to consolidate authority amid a fragile ceasefire. The Palestinian Authority condemned the killings as “heinous crimes” and warned that Hamas bears full responsibility. Israel’s Foreign Ministry shared the execution video widely, condemning Hamas’s tactics as “tyranny” that rules through fear and brutality rather than resistance.","summary":"Hamas publicly executed eight men in Gaza amid violent clashes with rival clans as it moves to tighten control after Israel’s withdrawal.

They’re not interested in politics,” Smith said. “I get very concerned when I see how easy it is to demonize these people for political ends when these are the very sort of people I think we should be celebrating.”\n\nMeanwhile, House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jim Jordan is requesting an interview with Smith as Republicans look to portray former President Joe Biden’s Justice Department as retaliatory against Trump.\n\nThe request sent Tuesday comes one week after Senate Republicans announced that the FBI, as part of Smith’s January 6 investigation, used court orders in 2023 to obtain the phone records of nine GOP lawmakers, a move the senators called “political weaponization.\n\nComey prosecution ‘reeks of lack of process’\n\nAt one point, Smith, who worked for years as a federal prosecutor, ripped into the Justice Department over how it’s operated under Trump, skewering it for allowing what he views as an unprecedented amount of politicization into the country’s justice system.\n\n“Nothing like what we see now has ever gone on,” Smith said. “Process shouldn’t be a political issue, right? Like if there’s rules in the department about how to bring a case, follow those rules. You can’t say, ‘I want this outcome, let me throw the rules out.’”\n\nSmith pointed to the federal charges brought last month against former FBI Director James Comey and the decision to drop the federal criminal case against New York Mayor Eric Adams, a Democrat, as two examples of how the department was operating out of the norm in Trump’s second term.\n\nFederal prosecutors dropped the case against Adams, which was brought last year, after the mayor agreed to work with Trump in his effort to crack down on illegal immigration.\n\n“Nothing like it has ever happened that I’ve ever heard of,” Smith said of the Adams case.\n\nComey, meanwhile, pleaded not guilty last week to two charges stemming from alleged false statements he made to Congress during testimony in 2020. A Trump-installed prosecutor in Virginia, Lindsey Halligan, secured an indictment against the former FBI director after Trump publicly complained the Justice Department wasn’t moving aggressively enough.\n\n“This latest prosecution of the former director of the FBI. You know, there’s a process to secure an indictment,” Smith said. “There’s a process of predication, having some evidence before you do that … The career prosecutors, the apolitical prosecutors who analyzed this said there wasn’t a case and so they brought somebody in who had never been a criminal prosecutor on days’ notice to secure an indictment a day before the statute of limitations ended.”\n\n“That just reeks of lack of process,” he said.\n\nPeople are leaving because of politics\n\nSmith, who has served under both Democratic and Republican presidents, said he believes the political appointees atop the Justice Department are acting differently than in previous administrations.\n\nCareer prosecutors are “being asked to do things that they think are wrong and because they’re not political people, they’re not going to do them,” Smith said.\n\n“And I think that explains why you’ve seen the resignations, you’ve seen people leave the department,” Smith said. “It’s not because they’re enemies of one administration or the next. They’ve worked through decades for different administrations. It’s just they’ve been doing things apolitically forever. And when they’re told, ‘No, you got to get this outcome no matter what,’ that is so contrary to how we were all raised as prosecutors.”\n\nCriticizes the Supreme Court’s immunity decision\n\nThe cases Smith brought against Trump were slowed down and eventually complicated by the Supreme Court’s consideration of whether Trump enjoyed broad immunity from criminal prosecution for his actions in office.\n\nBut Smith, who, when Trump was reelected, was in the process of trying to salvage the cases after the high court decided he had substantial presidential immunity, said Wednesday that there was a wide interpretation of immunity as the question made its way through lower courts and eventually up to the justices.\n\n“The district court, the appellate court, and the dissent (at the Supreme Court) strongly weighted the rule of law considerations,” Smith said. “The majority opinion strongly weighted the other considerations, and to your point, and brought up your point of, ‘Well if you do this, there’s going to be this response.’”\n\nThough Smith doesn’t agree with the Supreme Court’s ruling, he told Weissmann that his office never questioned whether they would follow the decision.\n\n“I think a really important thing to understand here is, while I didn’t agree … we followed it. There was never a question that we were going to follow the law as the Supreme Court said the law now was,” Smith said.\n\nBut he said he was concerned that the court’s ruling was “tantamount to saying you can never prosecute powerful, high officials.”\n\n“The problem is not prosecuting high officials who did something wrong when you do it according to the processes of law in your country,” he added. “It’s the retaliation. That’s the problem and that’s the thing that we should preventing.”\n\n‘Tons of evidence’ that Trump kept classified documents willingly\n\nWhile Smith was investigating Trump for his retention of classified documents, Attorney General Merrick Garland also appointed another special counsel, Robert Hur, to investigate Biden possibly having possession of classified documents as well.\n\nSmith and Hur ultimately came to different conclusions, and Hur decided not to bring charges against Biden. Smith pointed out that the main difference between the two cases was the facts that were presented to prosecutors investigating the case.\n\n“The difference is the facts. The rule of law allows for different outcomes when the facts are different. One of the major differences between the two cases is the obstructive conduct in the case that I investigated,” Smith said.\n\nSmith explained to his audience that as a prosecutor trying to prove that someone retained classified documents, the prosecutor needs evidence that the defendant “willingly” kept possession of the information.\n\n“To prove an illegal possession of classified documents, you need to show that you possessed the documents, or the defendant possessed the documents, willfully. And that means that he knew what he was doing was wrong.”\n\nSmith said he had “tons of evidence” that Trump had willingly retained the classified documents, and that the investigation into Biden did not have the same kind of evidence.\n\n“The evidence to not give the documents back when the government even tried to get them back before there was a criminal investigation … and then after the investigation started, still refusing to give them back, and then trying to obstruct the investigation, that helps prove willfulness,” Smith said. “That sort of evidence didn’t exist in the other case.”\n\nFor more CNN news and newsletters create an account at CNN.com","url":"https://www.yahoo.com/news/articles/takeaways-former-special-counsel-jack-235635429.html","image":"https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/rXKSTivv_k6nd_ePieZkgw--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTE5MjA7aD0xMDgwO2NmPXdlYnA-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/cnn_articles_875/273a9399e598fe20614f5f2ebae80a0e","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-10-14 23:56:35","author":"Casey Gannon, Devan Cole, Cnn","authors":["Casey Gannon, Devan Cole, Cnn"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.171},{"id":369287942,"title":"Return our dead! Israeli fury grows and Hamas stalls on returning hostages as Trump 'violently' threatens Hamas amid fears of ceasefire","text":"Israel refused to increase aid that was due to flood into Gaza today after Hamas had released just eight bodies of hostages by last night.\n\nPrime minister Benjamin Netanyahu ruled out doubling the number of trucks to deliver the much-needed supplies amid mounting anger at the terror group’s violation of the peace plan.\n\nUS President Donald Trump last night raged on Truth Social that the job ‘IS NOT DONE’, adding: ‘THE DEAD HAVE NOT BEEN RETURNED, AS PROMISED!’\n\nAs well as maintaining deliveries at 300 lorries per day, Israel also refused to reopen the Rafah Crossing into Egypt as planned to let Palestinians come and go from the Strip.\n\nHamas was supposed to return all 28 dead alongside the 20 living hostages by midday on Monday. But while the world rejoiced that all those alive came home, just four bodies were delivered, with a further four last night.\n\nIt provoked fury across Israel with calls for the government to react severely to the violation of the deal, as burying your dead is a sacred ritual in the Jewish religion.\n\nMr Netanyahu set a deadline for progress by the end of yesterday, prompting Hamas to announce it would hand back another quartet. And last night the Israeli military said four more ‘coffins of deceased hostages’ were collected by the Red Cross in Gaza.\n\nHamas has been accused of intentionally withholding dead hostages, putting the fragile peace under immense strain just days into the historic 20-point plan. It came as forensics yesterday confirmed that Yossi Sharabi’s body was among those returned on Monday, having previously identified two others as Guy Illouz and Bipin Joshi.\n\nMr Sharabi, 53, died in captivity while his British sister-in-law Lianne Sharabi, 48, was killed along with daughters Noiya, 16, and Yahel, 13, at Kibbutz Be’eri on October 7.\n\nHis brother, Eli Sharabi, 52, survived captivity and was released last January.\n\nMr Sharabi’s wife Nira, 55, said last night: ‘Now we can end the nightmare that began more than two years ago and allow Yossi a respectful and loving burial in the land of Be’eri that he loved so much.’\n\nForensics also confirmed the fourth body returned on Monday was that of Captain Daniel Peretz, 22. The South African-Israeli was captured when fighting Hamas at the Nahal Oz base and died from wounds which went untreated.\n\nMediators and aid agencies have insisted that the terror group is simply having trouble locating that bodies given the level of destruction across the territory after two years of war and tens of thousands dead.\n\nBut local broadcaster Kan reported that the Israeli government believes Hamas is holding some back intentionally amid fears they are trying to extort more out of Israel.\n\nAn Arab diplomat involved in talks, however, told Israeli paper Haaretz that they are working on the issue and do not believe the deal is in jeopardy.\n\nBut the Hostage Forum, which represents families of the victims, was holding an emergency meeting last night and wrote to Mr Trump’s special envoy Steve Witkoff. Urging him to intervene, they said: ‘We cannot rest, and we know you will not rest, until every last hostage is returned. We ask you to pull out every stop and leave no stone unturned in demanding Hamas fulfil their end of the agreement and bring all the remaining hostages home.’\n\nFamilies said Mr Witkoff’s pledge that he would dig with his ‘own fingers to find our loved ones’ was ‘forever etched in our memory’ and would ‘sustain us through the darkest moments’.\n\nUdi Goren, who is still waiting for the return of the body of his cousin Tal Haimi, told the Daily Mail that until they are all returned, his family is left in agony. ‘We cannot move on, have closure, and be able to recover until Tal and all the dead are back home,’ he said.\n\n‘I was actually hopeful that we would get my cousin back for the first time... I was desperately disappointed. We thought our personal struggle would be over and we could move forward, but now it carries on.’\n\nOther families were upset by a letter sent from the prime minister’s office expressing sadness at the ‘heavy price’ they had to pay for ‘the end of the war and the return of all the hostages’.\n\nMerav Svirsky, sister of Itay Svirsky, who was murdered in captivity and whose body was recovered last December, wrote on Facebook, ‘Sometimes one word is preferable: Sorry.’\n\nChristian Cardon, spokesman for the International Committee of the Red Cross, warned some remains may never be found yesterday. He said: ‘I think there is clearly a risk that that will take much more time. What we are telling the parties is that should be their top priority.’\n\nEgyptian teams are inside Gaza assisting efforts to locate and extract the bodies in consultation with Israel, according to Qatari Al Araby news outlet.\n\nGal Hirsch, Israel’s pointman on hostages, insisted ‘the mission is not complete’ and told families he will ‘intensify pressure’ on Hamas until all the hostages have been returned.\n\nIsrael also holds dead Palestinians, including many Hamas terrorists such as the October 7 mastermind Yahya Sinwar. They released the first batch of 45 bodies back to Gaza yesterday.\n\nKeir Starmer said Hamas must ‘honour the terms of the ceasefire’ as the Prime Minister paid tribute to families who have ‘endured terrible and protracted pain’.","summary":"Prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu ruled out doubling the number of trucks to deliver the much-needed supplies amid mounting anger at the terror group's violation of the peace plan.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-15192827/Return-dead-Israeli-fury-grows-Hamas-stalls-returning-hostages-Trump-violently-threatens-Hamas-amid-fears-ceasefire.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/10/14/23/102956477-0-image-m-44_1760480668452.jpg","video":"https://videos.dailymail.co.uk/video/mol/2025/10/14/8198864067390520063/1024x576_MP4_8198864067390520063.mp4","publish_date":"2025-10-14 23:54:48","author":"Andy Jehring,Editor,Natalia Lisbona","authors":["Andy Jehring","Editor","Natalia Lisbona"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"GB","sentiment":-0.067},{"id":369290996,"title":"Erika Kirk accepts the Medal of Freedom for slain husband Charlie Kirk","text":"Oct. 14 (UPI) -- President Donald Trump posthumously awarded the Medal of Freedom to slain conservative activist Charlie Kirk on Tuesday afternoon at the White House.\n\nThe event was held at the newly remodeled Rose Garden, and the president was accompanied by Erika Kirk, hand in hand, as they exited the White House and Trump approached the lectern for the ceremonial event.\n\n\"Today, we are here to honor and remember a fearless warrior for liberty, a beloved leader who galvanized the next generation like nobody I've ever seen before,\" the president said.\n\nHe described Charlie Kirk, 31, as \"an American patriot of the deepest conviction, the finest quality and the highest caliber.\"\n\n\"Five weeks ago, our nation was robbed of this extraordinary champion,\" Trump said.\n\n\"It was a horrible, heinous, demonic act of murder,\" the president continued. \"He was assassinated in the prime of his life for boldly speaking the truth, for living his faith and relentlessly fighting for a better, stronger America.\"\n\nHe said Charlie loved the country and is deserving of posthumously being awarded the nation's highest honor for a civilian, the Presidential Medal of Freedom.\n\nTrump spoke of Charlie Kirk's love for his wife and their two children and said Erika has served as an inspiration for the nation following her husband's assassination during a Turning Point USA event at Utah Valley University in Orem, Utah, on Sept. 10.\n\nThe president also said Charlie Kirk was very wise for being such a young man and that he supported his election effort in 2016 when many others thought he had no chance of becoming president.\n\nHe called the Presidential Medal of Freedom a \"really big deal\" and presented the award to Erika, 36, on what would have been her husband's 32nd birthday.\n\nTrump said the event was the first to be held at the \"new and improved Rose Garden,\" in which a hardened surface was placed to support outdoor events.\n\nErika struggled to hold back tears as she joined Trump at the podium to accept the Medal of Freedom on her husband's behalf.\n\nA military aide recited the wording of the award certificate, saying: \"Charlie Kirk was one of the most influential American political figures of his generation.\n\n\"At just 18 years old, he founded Turning Point USA and grew it into one of the largest conservative youth organizations in the nation. For over a decade, he tirelessly traveled the country, leading a movement to restore respect for our founding principles, reawaken our national identity and inspire a new spirit of religious devotion.\n\n\"He was one of the great debaters and communicators of his time.

It lives through you.\n\n\"Charlie always said the next generation will decide whether freedom endures,\" she added. \"And because of you, I know that freedom will endure.\"\n\nShe said Charlie Kirk gave his \"entire life\" to freedom and the award affirms that the \"national interest of the United States has always been freedom.\"\n\nErika Kirk succeeds her husband as the leader of Turning Point USA, which has received tens of thousands of requests to found new chapters and schools, colleges and universities across the nation since Charlie Kirk's assassination.\n\nAccused killer Tyler Robinson is being tried for a capital murder offense in Utah and related charges for allegedly targeting Charlie Kirk last month.","summary":"President Donald Trump posthumously awarded the Medal of Freedom to slain conservative activist Charlie Kirk on Tuesday afternoon at a White House event.","url":"https://www.upi.com/Top_News/US/2025/10/14/charlie-kirk-medal-of-freedom/1041760484123/","image":"https://cdnph.upi.com/sv/ph/og/upi/1041760484123/2025/1/b9ff64b7a3a136bcec6b4c5fe32ee3f4/v1.5/Erika-Kirk-accepts-Medal-of-Freedom-for-slain-husband-Charlie-Kirk.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-10-14 23:54:07","author":"Mike Heuer","authors":["Mike Heuer"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.55},{"id":369288024,"title":"We owe President Trump one thing after Gaza peace deal — our gratitude","text":"Thank you, Mr. President\n\nNot everyone’s going to like this column.

I knew him when, assistant to the Miss Universe president, I booked the celebrity judges. I knew him when I attended his Ivana wedding, Marla wedding, when he married Melania. I’ve flown with him on his plane to California. He’s been there when things were bad for me. He brought his team over to ensure my apartment’s safety. He took care of my husband’s ashes.\n\nThings went bad for him and it was tuna fish sandwich lunch at my home.

He is not laying down for us. He is fighting the whole world for us.\n\nOK, you don’t favor him? You prefer the paid insects creeping around DC? The ones trying to unseat him? Want to kill the United States of America? Turn us into Syria, Venezuela, Iran.\n\nNobody’s ever seen the likes of Donald. You still don’t like him? OK, mazel tov. March. Burn flags. Start fires.

I did not even feel out of sorts, or like something was very wrong. If fact, I had no idea that anything was off at all,' the actor wrote.\nWhile the masseur wasn't certain of the medical emergency, he noticed some alarming changes in the actor's body that alerted him something was wrong.\nWhen he stated his intention to call 911, Curry initially told him not to, and thought he was 'overreacting.'\n\nTim Curry, 79, has credited his masseur for saving his life when he suffered a stroke in 2012; Curry pictured in 2016 in West Hollywood\n\nThe legendary Rocky Horror Picture Show star (pictured in a still) had a stroke at his home in 2012, leaving him partially paralyzed on one side of his body and affecting his speech\n'I probably owe my life to the fact that he ignored me, went with his instinct, and called an ambulance.'\n'Even as they were loading me in, I still thought my masseur had overreacted, and that we were going through a ridiculous and unnecessary exercise.'\n\n Rocky Horror star Tim Curry gives rare health update 13 years after suffering life-changing stroke \nAfter his evaluation, doctors determined the actor would need a craniectomy.\nHe did not learn the true severity of his condition until the procedure was already done.\n'Only after the surgery was completed was I informed that I had suffered a serious stroke, which sent blood clots to my brain, two of which had been removed.'\n'Biologically, such clots really clog up the works — in other words, you're not getting sufficient blood flow, so your brain isn't receiving the oxygen and such that it needs,' he shared.\n'If there was anything impressed upon me in the aftermath, it was just how remarkable it was that I was still alive,' he went on.\n'I don't know whether I was able to respond aloud at that stage; all I can truly remember thinking was \"But I didn't feel...anything.\"'\nThe actor shared that because the stroke was 'a paralytic one' he still suffers ongoing physical effects.\n\nHe opened up about the experience in his new memoir, Vagabond, revealing that he was getting a massage when it happened and 'had no idea that anything was off at all'\n\nWhen the masseur stated his intention to call 911, Curry initially told him not to, and thought he was 'overreacting'; The actor pictured in September in Los Angeles\n\n'I probably owe my life to the fact that he ignored me, went with his instinct, and called an ambulance,' the actor added; Pictured in 2005\n\nHe added that he's 'very grateful that it was not a speech stroke' and that if he had lost his verbal ability it would have been 'devastating.'\nHe said that the several weeks of not being able to speak during recovery were 'hell' but that he was 'assured that language would come back with time.' \nSince his stroke, Curry's life has 'changed dramatically' as he has shifted to voice acting, playing Emperor Palpatine in the animated Star Wars series Clone Wars, as well as Terrence the Toucan in the animated movie Ribbit. \nHis memoir, Vagabond, is now available at bookstores.\nIn September, he opened up about his wellbeing during a special screening in honor of the musical film's 50th anniversary.\nSpeaking to the audience at LA's Academy Museum, Tim said: 'I still can't walk, which is why I'm in this silly chair, and that's very limiting.\n'So, I won't be singing and I won't be dancing very soon. I still have real problems with my left leg.'\nSince the stroke, which he suffered aged 66, the legendary actor has remained largely out of the public eye and has been rarely sighted.\nAccording to Mayo Clinic, an ischemic stroke occurs when the blood supply to part of the brain is blocked or reduced.\nThis prevents brain tissue from getting oxygen and nutrients. Brain cells begin to die in minutes.\nAnother type of stroke is a hemorrhagic stroke. It occurs when a blood vessel in the brain leaks or bursts and causes bleeding in the brain. The blood increases pressure on brain cells and damages them.\nTim is best known for his role as the brilliantly mad scientist Dr Frank N Furter in The Rocky Horror Picture Show.\nHe first starred in the original 1973 London production and continued to play the part on Broadway before reviving the character in the 1975 film.\n\nTim shot to fame as Dr Frank-N-Furter in the musical comedy The Rocky Horror Picture Show (seen in a still)\n\nHe has enjoyed an illustrious career on the stage and screen having appeared in the likes of Annie (1982), Home Alone 2 (1992 - seen in a still), and Charlie's Angels (2000)\n\nSpeaking on the film's lasting impact, he said as per The Hollywood Reporter: 'I'm so excited by this and very honored by the Academy to do this presentation of our movie, which has dragged on for 50 years.'\nTim enjoyed an illustrious acting career prior to the health scare having shot to fame through The Rocky Picture Show in 1975.\nOn the role that catapulted him to stardom, he told Los Angeles magazine that he looks at the film's success 'with a sort of bemused tolerance.'\nHe continued: 'It's neither a blessing nor a curse. I was lucky to get it.'\nTim has enjoyed an illustrious career on the stage and screen having appeared in the likes of Annie (1982), Home Alone 2 (1992), and Charlie's Angels (2000). \n\nShare or comment on this article: \nRocky Horror star Tim Curry says he 'owes his life' to masseur who defied him and called 911 during 2012 stroke\n\nAdd comment\n\n Share what you think\n\nWorst rated\n\nThe comments below have not been moderated.\n\nThe views expressed in the contents above are those of our users and do not necessarily reflect the views of MailOnline.\n\nAdd your comment\n\nEnter your comment\n\nBy posting your comment you agree to our house rules.\n\nSubmit Comment\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual.\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual\n\nWe will automatically post your comment and a link to the news story to your Facebook timeline at the same time it is posted on MailOnline.

The president calls budget chief Russ Vought the “grim reaper,” and Vought has seized on the opportunity to fund Trump's priorities, paying the military while slashing jobs in health, education, the sciences and other areas with actions that have been criticized as illegal and are facing court challenges.\n\nTrump said programs favored by Democrats are being targeted and “they’re never going to come back, in many cases.”\n\nSpeaking during an event at the White House, Trump added, “We’re being able to do things that we were unable to do before.\"\n\nWith Congress at a standstill — the Republican-led House refusing to return to session and the Senate stuck in a loop of failed votes to reopen government as Democrats demand health care funding — the budget office quickly filled the void.\n\nFrom Project 2025 to the White House\n\nVought, a chief architect of the conservative Project 2025 policy book, is reshaping the size and scope of federal government in ways similar to those envisioned in the blueprint. It is exactly what certain lawmakers, particularly Democrats, feared if Congress failed to fund the government.\n\nTrump's priorities — supporting the military and pursuing his mass deportation agenda — have been largely uninterrupted, despite the closures. The administration found leftover tariff revenues to ensure the Women, Infants and Children food aid program did not shutter.\n\nBut the Trump administration is shuttering scores of other programs, firing workers handling special education and after-school programs and those guarding the nation's infrastructure from cyber attacks. More than 4,100 federal workers received layoff notices over the weekend.\n\n“This shutdown is different from earlier ones because Donald Trump and Russ Vought and all of their cronies are using this moment to terrorize these patriotic federal employees,” said Sen. Chris Van Hollen, D-Md., standing with federal workers Tuesday outside the White House budget office.\n\nVan Hollen said it's \"a big fat lie” when Trump and his budget director say the shutdown is making them fire federal workers. “It is also illegal and we will see them in court,” he said.\n\nShutdown grinds into a third week\n\nNow on its 14th day, the federal closure is quickly becoming one of the longest government shutdowns. Congress failed to meet the Oct. 1 deadline to pass the annual appropriations bills needed to fund the government as the Democrats demanded a deal to preserve expiring health care funds that provide subsidies for people to purchase insurance through the Affordable Care Act.\n\nHouse Speaker Mike Johnson said Tuesday he has nothing to negotiate with the Democrats until they vote to reopen the government. But there are no signs so far of that happening as Senate Democrats have rejected a GOP bill to reopen the government eight times, most recently on Monday evening.\n\nThe Republican speaker welcomed OMB’s latest actions to pay some workers and fire others.\n\n“They have every right to move the funds around,” Johnson said at a press conference at the Capitol. If the Democrats want to challenge the Trump administration in court, Johnson said, “bring it.\"\n\nTypically, federal workers are furloughed during a lapse in funding, traditionally with back pay once government funding is restored. But Vought's budget office announced late last week that the reductions in forces had begun. Some 750,000 employees are being furloughed.\n\nMilitary pay, deportations on track\n\nAt the same time, Trump instructed the military to find money to ensure service personnel wouldn't miss paychecks this week. The Pentagon said over the weekend it was able to tap $8 billion in unused research and development funds to make payroll.\n\nOn Tuesday, Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said her agency was relying on Trump's big tax cuts law for funding to make sure members of the Coast Guard are also paid.\n\n“We at DHS worked out an innovative solution,” Noem said in a statement. Thanks to Trump's “One Big Beautiful Bill,” she said, \"the brave men and women of the US Coast Guard will not miss a paycheck this week.”\n\nIn past shutdowns, the OMB has overseen agency plans during the lapse in federal fundings, ensuring which workers are essential and remain on the job. Vought, however, has taken his role further by speaking openly about his plans to go after the federal workforce.\n\nAs agencies started making their shutdown plans, Vought's OMB encouraged department heads to consider reductions in force, an unheard-of action. The budget office's general counsel, Mark Paoletta, suggested in a draft memo that the workforce may not be automatically eligible for back pay once government reopens.\n\n‘Grim reaper’ replaces Elon Musk's chainsaw\n\nTrump posted an AI-generated video last week that portrayed Vought wearing a cloak and carrying a scythe, against the backdrop of the classic rock staple “(Don't Fear) The Reaper.”\n\n“Every authoritarian leader has had his grim reaper. Russell Vought is Donald Trump’s,\" said Rep. Steny Hoyer, the senior Democrat from Maryland.\n\nHoyer compared the budget chief to billionaire Elon Musk wielding a chainsaw earlier this year during the Department of Government Efficiency's slashing of the workforce. “Vought swings his scythe through the federal government as thoughtlessly,\" he said.\n\nIn many ways, Trump’s tax cuts law gave the White House a vast new allotment of federal funding for its priority projects, separate from the regular appropriations process in Congress.\n\nThe package unleashed some $175 billion for the Pentagon, including for the “Golden Dome” missile shield and other priority projects, and another $175 million for Homeland Security, largely for Trump's mass deportation agenda. It also included extra funds for Vought's work at OMB.\n\nCertain funds from the bill are available to be used during the shutdown, according to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office.\n\n“The Administration also could decide to use mandatory funding provided in the 2025 reconciliation act or other sources of mandatory funding to continue activities financed by those direct appropriations at various agencies,” according to CBO.\n\nThe CBO cited the departments of Defense, Treasury and Homeland Security and the Office of Management and Budget as among those that received funds under the law.","summary":"President Donald Trump is making this government shutdown unlike any the nation has ever seen, giving his budget office rare authority to pick winners and losers - who gets paid or fired, which programs are cut or survive - in an unprecedented restructuring across the federal workforce.

I, I honestly thought that would go in a different direction.' This prompted laughter from the audience.\n'But don't worry, it's fine, we can try again, we can try again. Guys, f*****g hit it.'\nSam was seen on his hands and knees, jokingly cowering in embarrassment.\nElsewhere during the show, Sam opened up about having had a rough year since his split from Zara and credited Pete with being there for him. \n'You probably know, and there are a select few people you can really on those moments, and Pete is the epitome of tough exterior, gooey center, like an onion with many, many, many, many, many f*****g layers of pin,' he said.\n'Caring, loyal, gentle, angry, but he's the most supportive, best friend I could ever ask for.' \nZara and Louis have taken things up a notch, with Zara moving into multi-millionaire Louis' north London mansion, having moved back into her parents' house after leaving the Fulham home she shared with Sam.\nInsiders told The Sun: 'They're smitten and she has been spending all of her time at his place, she's pretty much moved in. Zara has even started making her social media videos from there instead of her parents' [home]. \n\n'She had been back at her family home after her split from her ex...\n'But Louis's home and her parents' house are nowhere near each other, so it made sense that she is spending more time at his.\n'They're in the honeymoon stage and want to be with each other as much as possible when they're not working. Zara spent loads of time travelling with Louis this summer and now they're back in the UK she's using his place as a base a lot of the time.'\nThe Daily Mail has approached Zara and Louis' representatives for comment.\nZara's first Instagram post with Louis saw the couple kissing, under which Louis commented 'I love you'. Their relationship is clearly supported by their siblings, as Zara's brother wrote 'beautiful couple', while Louis' sister wrote 'love love'.\nOne DirectionSamie Elishi\n\nShare or comment on this article: \nSam Thompson's new girlfriend Talitha Balinska attempts to avoid awkward run-in with his ex Samie Elishi at beauty event\n\nAdd comment\n\n Share what you think\n\nWorst rated\n\nThe comments below have not been moderated.\n\nThe views expressed in the contents above are those of our users and do not necessarily reflect the views of MailOnline.\n\nAdd your comment\n\nEnter your comment\n\nBy posting your comment you agree to our house rules.\n\nSubmit Comment\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual.\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual\n\nWe will automatically post your comment and a link to the news story to your Facebook timeline at the same time it is posted on MailOnline.

The former said 'when fascists die, democrats don't complain' and the latter called Kirk a 'son of a b**** [who] he died by his own rules.' \n\nThe revelation came after Donald Trump posthumously awarded Kirk America's highest civilian honor, the Presidential Medal of Freedom. \n\nKirk's widow Erika fought back tears as she thanked Trump for giving him the 'best birthday gift ever.'\n\nThe president, who returned from a whirlwind Middle East peace mission late last night, said: 'I raced back halfway around the globe. I was going to call Erika and ask, 'Could you maybe move it to Friday?' but I didn't have the courage to call.'\n\n'But you know why I didn't call? Because I heard today was Charlie's birthday.'\n\nKirk's parents were also in attendance for the ceremony despite remaining out of the public spotlight after their son's death.\n\nAt Kirk's funeral in September, Trump called him a 'great American hero' and 'martyr' for freedom.\n\nThe administration and its supporters have targeted people for their comments about Kirk, leading to firings or other discipline of journalists, teachers and others, and raising free speech concerns.\n\nTrump and Secretary of State Marco Rubio 'will defend our borders, our culture, and our citizens by enforcing our immigration laws,' the State Department said. \n\n'Aliens who take advantage of America's hospitality while celebrating the assassination of our citizens will be removed.'\n\nThe move has sparked fury and condemnation from freedom of speech advocates.\n\nConor Fitzpatrick, an attorney at the Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression (FIRE) told Daily Mail: 'You can’t defend “our culture” by eroding the very cornerstone of what America stands for: freedom of speech and thought. \n\n'The Trump administration must stop punishing people for their opinions alone. The Supreme Court has been clear that noncitizens have a right to freedom of speech. \n\n'In America, no one should fear a midnight knock at the door because of their political views.'\n\nFIRE is suing the administration to challenge the provisions that Rubio is using to deport individuals for their speech. \n\nMeanwhile Vice President JD Vance and other top US officials have encouraged people to call out offensive language about Kirk that they see online.\n\nIn an unusual post to X last month, Deputy Secretary of State Christopher Landau asked social media users to copy him on any relevant posts, saying he was personally 'disgusted to see some on social media praising, rationalizing, or making light of the event, and have directed our consular officials to undertake appropriate action.'\n\nThe administration has expelled South Africa's ambassador to the United States for comments critical of Trump, revoked a visa for Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas to attend the U.N. General Assembly and yanked the visas for British punk-rap duo Bob Vylan. \n\nIt said it is reviewing the status of the more than 55 million current U.S. visa holders for potential violations of its standards.\n\nThose actions have been criticized by civil rights groups as violations of constitutional protections for freedom of speech, which apply to anyone in the United States and not just to American citizens.","summary":"The State Department on Tuesday revealed it has reviewed online social media posts and clips of Kirk following his death at a Utah college campus on September 10.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-15192843/trump-revokes-foreign-visas-charlie-kirk-social-media.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/10/14/23/102991807-0-image-a-210_1760481302851.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-10-14 23:44:17","author":"Brittany Chain,Editor","authors":["Brittany Chain","Editor"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"GB","sentiment":0.087},{"id":369298604,"title":"Trump says Spain should be ‘punished’ over Nato funding, considering tariffs","text":"Donald Trump suggested Spain be expelled from Nato for failing to meet the higher defence spending requirement.

In fact, I was thinking about giving them trade punishment through tariffs because of what they did, and I may do that,\" Trump told reporters at the White House.\nTrump suggested last week that Spain be expelled from Nato over its failure to match the higher defence spending requirement.\nIn June, the military alliance of 32 member states agreed to boost defence spending to 5% of annual economic output over the next decade under pressure from Trump.\nBut Spain, which was Nato's lowest defence spender in relative terms last year, insisted it would not need to hit the headline figure.\nSocialist Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez has argued that Spain should meet its capacity objectives rather than fixed spending targets, including cybersecurity and the environment in his calculations.\nAfter Trump's expulsion threat, government sources in Madrid said on Friday that \"Spain is a committed and full member of Nato.

The program was subsisting on just $150 million in contingency funding, which the Office of Management and Budget had previously said was set to run out in October.\n\nAdditionally, amid layoffs in sectors he deemed nonessential, Trump has ordered that troops remain paid, directing “Secretary of War Pete Hegseth, to use all available funds to get our troops paid on October 15th.”\n\nThe next major payday after Oct. 15 will be Oct. 29, so Trump’s decision staves off one of the most painful consequences of a shutdown. If the shutdown continues at that point, it would be the second-longest ever, only beaten by a 35-day shutdown that lasted from Dec. 22, 2018, to Jan. 25, 2019, during Trump’s first term.\n\nSpeaker of the House Mike Johnson, R-La., backed the president to the hilt for his management of the shutdown in a Tuesday press conference.\n\n“I’m grateful for a commander in chief who understands the priorities of the country, the necessity of national defense, and the urgency that we all feel and have voted for eight times … to fund the troops and pay federal workers and all these essential jobs and agencies,” said Johnson. \n\nBut not everyone in Congress has approved of Trump’s redirecting of funds. Rep. Jim Himes, D-Conn., has said that it is “probably not” legal and that the White House’s “understanding of United States law” is “pretty tentative, to say the best.”\n\n“My understanding of this is, they have every right to move the funds around, duly appropriated dollars from Congress to the Department of Defense,” Johnson said of Trump’s actions. “There was some [research and development] accounts that had not been spent, and that’s my understanding, is that’s the money that’s being used to pay the troops right now.”\n\nAnd Johnson says that if Democrats wish to make paying the troops a political issue, he’d welcome it.\n\n“If the Democrats want to go to court and challenge troops being paid, bring it,” he said.\n\nHouse Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., who continues to reject the idea of funding the government until Democrats’ demands are acceded to, appeared to find no issue with the president’s allocation of funds to WIC.\n\n“In previous shutdowns, funding has always been identified to make sure that the women’s infant nutrition program has been funded. And we expect that that should happen during this moment in time as well,” he said.\n\nBut another facet of the current shutdown is layoffs, with the White House implementing “reductions in force” in programs it doesn’t want.\n\nJeffries told reporters that that tactic would not work to pressure Democrats, since the president has been attempting to downsize government agencies since the beginning of his term.\n\n“In terms of the mass firings, the violations of the law, the bullying of hard-working federal employees—that’s been going on since Jan. 20, the first day of this presidency. The focus of the Trump administration has been on visiting chaos and confusion and cruelty on the American people,” he said.\n\nHowever, Trump’s contingency measures cannot go on forever, as funds continue to be depleted amid the now two-week government shutdown.\n\nHouse Republican Conference Chair Lisa McClain, R-Mich., addressed that concern Tuesday, telling reporters, “Listen, I’m grateful to President Trump for finding a way to keep milk flowing to moms and babies through the WIC, and paychecks going to our troops. Yes, I’m happy, but that’s not going to last forever.”\n\nMcClain suggested that, despite the Band-Aids being put on the shutdown, the political reality remains the same: The government will continue to see its resources depleted until Democrats join with Republicans in voting to reopen the government.\n\n“These emergency measures can’t fully fix the Democrats’ damage. He can try, but at some point in time, they’re going to end,” said McClain.","summary":"President Donald Trump is taking an extremely active role in redirecting resources in order to blunt the painful effects of the federal government shutdown.

Vance and other top US officials have encouraged people to call out offensive language about Kirk that they see online.\nIn an unusual social media post last month, Deputy Secretary of State Christopher Landau asked social media users to copy him on any relevant posts, saying he was personally “disgusted to see some on social media praising, rationalising, or making light of the event, and have directed our consular officials to undertake appropriate action”.\nIn addition to Tuesday’s action, the administration has ramped up efforts to identify and potentially expel thousands of foreigners in the United States, notably students, who it says have either fomented or participated in unrest or publicly supported protests against Israel’s military operations in Gaza.\nThe administration has also denied visas to applicants whose social media histories have been critical of its policies.\nAmong the higher-profile cases, the administration has expelled South Africa’s ambassador to the United States for comments critical of Trump, revoked a visa for Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas to attend the UN General Assembly and yanked the visas for British punk-rap duo Bob Vylan.\nIt said it is reviewing the status of the more than 55 million current US visa holders for potential violations of its standards.\nThose actions have been criticised by civil rights groups as violations of constitutional protections for freedom of speech, which apply to anyone in the United States and not just to American citizens.","summary":"The Trump administration has revoked the visas of six foreigners deemed by US officials to have made derisive comments or made light of the assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk last month.\nThe US State Department said on Tuesday it had determined they should lose their visas after reviewing their online social media posts and clips about Kirk, who was killed while speaking at a Utah college campus on September 10.\nThe announcement came as US President Donald Trump was posthumously...","url":"https://www.scmp.com/news/world/united-states-canada/article/3329038/us-revokes-visas-6-foreigners-over-charlie-kirk-related-speech","image":"https://cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2025/10/15/0d47db4e-76d3-40ff-934c-3647e92a6b12_58c2aaac.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-10-14 23:39:17","author":"Associated Press","authors":["Associated Press"],"language":"en","source_country":"cn","sentiment":-0.06},{"id":369290596,"title":"The Latest: Trump awards Charlie Kirk the Presidential Medal of Freedom","text":"President Donald Trump awarded the nation’s highest civilian honor, the Presidential Medal of Freedom, posthumously to Charlie Kirk on Tuesday.\n\nKirk was an activist who inspired a generation of young conservatives and helped push the nation’s politics further to the right; he was killed last month during an event at a university in Utah. His politics were often divisive, and Trump has cited Kirk as a major reason he was reelected, calling Kirk a “great American hero” while speaking at his funeral in September.\n\nThe government shutdown also entered its 14th day Tuesday, with the Senate returning from its holiday break, Republican House Speaker Mike Johnson refusing to call lawmakers back to Washington and Trump’s budget director vowing to keep firing federal workers.\n\nDemocrats have focused on trying to keep Affordable Care Act subsidies from expiring for millions of Americans who purchase insurance on “Obamacare” exchanges. Without this federal support, costs are expected to soar across the health care economy. Johnson said he “won’t negotiate” unless Democrats first agree to reopen the government, losing their leverage for any deal.\n\nThe Latest:\n\n Florida judge temporarily blocks transfer of downtown Miami land for Trump’s presidential library \n\nThe move came after a Miami activist alleged that officials at a local college violated Florida’s open government law when they gifted the sizable plot of real estate to the state, which then voted to transfer it to the foundation for the planned presidential library.\n\nThe nearly 3-acre (1.2-hectare) property is valued at more than $67 million, according to a 2025 assessment by the Miami-Dade County property appraiser. One of the last undeveloped lots on an iconic stretch of palm tree-lined Biscayne Boulevard, one real estate expert wagered that the parcel could sell for hundreds of millions of dollars more.\n\nMarvin Dunn, an activist and chronicler of local Black history, filed a lawsuit this month in a Miami-Dade County court against the Board of Trustees for Miami Dade College, a state-run school that owned the property. He alleges that the board violated Florida’s Government in the Sunshine law by not providing sufficient notice for its special meeting on Sept. 23, when it voted to give up the land, and he’s seeking to block the land transfer.\n\n Hegseth letter last month says up to 1,000 Guard members to be in Memphis through September 2026 \n\nIn Memphis, Tennessee, it remains unclear how many National Guard troops are or will be in the city, where some armed Guard soldiers were spotted late last week beginning their patrol at the Bass Pro Shops located at the iconic Pyramid. A slew of officers from other federal agencies have already been sent to Memphis through a Trump-created task force aimed at crime.\n\nAccording to a Sept. 23 letter from Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth to Gov. Bill Lee, the Department of Defense is prepared to authorize and fund up to 1,000 Guard personnel in Memphis through September 2026. The Associated Press obtained the letter through a public records request. The Daily Memphian previously reported on it.\n\nLee, a Republican, had said he didn’t expect many more than 150 Guard members in Memphis, but he has been loath to repeat the number, instead lately saying there is no estimate.\n\nU.S. Marshals Service Director Gadyaces S. Serralta said Tuesday that between 1,500 and 2,000 federal law enforcement agents who are part of the task force are in Memphis daily.\n\n State Department adviser charged with illegally retaining classified records \n\nAshley Tellis is accused by the Justice Department of printing out classified documents and storing more than 1,000 pages of highly sensitive government records in filing cabinets and trash bags at home.\n\nTellis was charged with the unlawful retention of national defense information after FBI agent searched his home over the weekend.\n\nHe was ordered detained Tuesday pending a detention hearing next week. One of his lawyers said they “look forward to the hearing, where we’ll be able to present evidence.”\n\nAn FBI affidavit alleges Tellis over the last month printed classified documents on topics including U.S. military aircraft capabilities. Surveillance video shows him on several occasions exiting the State Department and a Defense Department facility with a briefcase in which he was believed to have stashed the printed-out papers, according to court documents.\n\n▶ Read more about the charges against Tellis\n\n US revokes 6 visas over Charlie Kirk-related speech \n\nThe Trump administration has revoked the visas of six foreigners deemed by U.S. officials to have made derisive comments or made light of the assassination of Charlie Kirk.\n\nThe State Department says it had determined they should lose their visas after reviewing their social media posts and online clips about Kirk.\n\nThe announcement came as Trump was posthumously awarding him the Presidential Medal of Freedom.\n\nThe administration and its supporters have targeted people for their comments about Kirk, leading to firings or other discipline of journalists, teachers and others, and raising free speech concerns.\n\nThe six people who had their visas revoked were from Argentina, Brazil, Germany, Mexico, Paraguay and South Africa. They were not identified.\n\n Erika Kirk says she intends to see her husband’s work through \n\nErika Kirk says God began a “mighty work” through her husband, Charlie, and she intends to see it through.\n\nIt’s a nod to her new role as head of Turning Point USA, the conservative youth voting advocacy group he started in 2012.\n\nShe finished her remarks by saying that Charlie Kirk’s story reminds us that “to live free is the greatest gift but to die free is the greatest victory.”\n\n“Happy birthday, my Charlie,” she said. “Happy freedom day.”\n\n Erika Kirk says her husband may have made a bid for the White House if he had lived \n\n“And if the moment had come, he probably would have run for president, but not out of ambition,” she said as she wrapped up her tribute to Charlie Kirk. “He would only have done it if that was something that he believed that his country needed.\n\n Venezuelan leader calls on press to combat US ‘lies’ \n\nFollowing the latest U.S. strike on a small boat accused of carrying drugs in international waters off Venezuela, Jorge Rodríguez, president of Venezuela’s National Assembly and a close ally of President Nicolás Maduro, called on the press to combat U.S. “lies” that are being used to justify a possible invasion.\n\nThe government had convened foreign media and dozens of leaders of local media outlets for Rodríguez’s message Tuesday.\n\n“The objective is not the search for the truth and much less fighting drug trafficking,” Rodríguez said. It’s about “looking for the way to have an excuse for aggression.”\n\n“We’re not asking you to make up anything, but rather to defend the truth,” he said.\n\n Nation’s highest civilian honor is the best birthday gift, Erika Kirk says \n\nErika Kirk says the Presidential Medal of Freedom is the perfect birthday gift for Charlie.\n\nShe said after receiving the award on her husband’s behalf that she had spent years trying to find the best birthday gift for him. Charlie Kirk would have turned 32 on Tuesday.\n\nShe says he preferred quiet birthdays, but she can say with confidence that Trump has given him the best birthday present with the nation’s highest civilian honor.\n\n Trump presents award to Kirk’s widow \n\nAfter describing it as a “really big deal,” the president asked a military aide to read the citation. Erika Kirk wiped her eyes and Trump handed the medal to her.\n\n“Thank you, Mr. President, for honoring my husband in such a profound and meaningful way,” she said.\n\n Trump detours to appreciate the sound of sirens \n\nDuring remarks about public safety, Trump could hear sirens from somewhere nearby.\n\n“What a beautiful sound,” he said. “They’re stopping crime. That’s what they’re doing.”\n\nHe went on to describe them as “real deal sirens” and “not politically correct sirens.”\n\n Senate Democrats’ bill to halt US assistance for Argentina fails to quickly advance \n\nSenate Democrats were trying to quickly advance a bill that would prohibit $20 billion in assistance that Trump has promised to Argentina, but it failed to get the unanimous consent needed after a Republican objected to the legislation.\n\nSen. Elizabeth Warren, the top Democrat on the Senate committee that overseas banking, argued that Trump was only promising the assistance to help Argentine President Javier Milei.\n\n“That’s Argentina First, not America First,” she said.\n\nThe chair of the Senate committee on banking, Sen. Tim Scott, objected to Warren’s attempt, saying that it would “impair Treasury’s ability to help an ally in South America.”\n\n CDC has lost nearly a quarter of its workforce this year, union estimates \n\nPublic health experts and others are still trying to determine the exact impact of the latest government layoffs at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. But one union estimates that the Atlanta-based agency has lost roughly a quarter of its workforce so far this year.\n\nThe American Federation of Government Employees held a call with reporters Tuesday, in which it estimated that of the more than 13,000 CDC employees at the beginning of this year, more than 3,000 have left through layoffs, buyouts, retirements or other ways.\n\nAFGE officials were reacting to questions about more than 1,300 CDC received reduction-in-force notices that went out Friday — of which about 700 were late revoked in follow-up notices.\n\nGovernment officials attributed to chaos to a coding error, but have not responded to questions about how a mistake of that magnitude happened, and what CDC programs and staff are being eliminated in this latest round.\n\n Trump credits Kirk with boosting his comeback campaign \n\n“He helped make it happen,” the Republican president said. Without Kirk, “maybe you would have Kamala standing here today,” referring to former Vice President Kamala Harris who was his Democratic opponent last year. “That would not be good.”\n\n Trump attributes nice weather for Charlie Kirk event to God’s blessing \n\nTrump opened the ceremony for Charlie Kirk’s posthumous Presidential Medal of Freedom by noting how beautiful the day was out in the Rose Garden.\n\nHe said that the weather was supposed to be terrible and rainy but instead it was sunny, allowing the event to be moved from indoors to outdoors.\n\n“I was telling Erika, God was watching,” Trump said of Kirk’s widow. “And he didn’t want that for Charlie.”\n\n Feds deploy tear gas in Chicago street after high-speed chase leads to crash \n\nA high-speed chase involving Border Patrol agents pursuing a suspect led to a crash Tuesday afternoon in a residential street on Chicago’s East Side, authorities said. Footage from the scene shows bystanders gathering before agents deployed a tear gas to disperse them.\n\nWhile Border Patrol agents conducted an immigration enforcement operation, DHS officials said a person suspected of being in the country illegally used a vehicle to ram into a Border Patrol vehicle before fleeing. The agents chased the suspect’s vehicle until the suspect stopped and attempted to run away on foot, according to DHS.\n\nAs agents arrested the suspect, a crowd began to form and “crowd control methods were used,” DHS officials said.\n\nThe Chicago Police Department confirmed that federal agents deployed tear gas into the street.\n\nFootage from ABC shows dozens of protesters waving flags as several federal agents and local police officers hold them back from the street. Border Patrol agents can be seen throwing tear gas cannisters into the crowd, enveloping the street in a white gas as protesters cough and run from the area.\n\n Trump says US may stop buying cooking oil from China as ‘retribution’ for soybean boycott \n\nIn a Truth Social post, he called Beijing’s decision not to buy U.S. soybeans “an Economically Hostile Act.”\n\nHe wrote that the U.S. can “easily produce Cooking Oil ourselves” and doesn’t need to buy it from China. China has been the biggest foreign buyer of American soybeans for many years but hasn’t bought any since May.\n\nThe post is the latest escalatory rhetoric after trade tensions flared up last week when Beijing imposed extra export rules on rare earths products. However, both sides also have made off-ramp remarks, with Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent telling Fox News on Monday that the leaders still plan to meet at the end of the month in South Korea.\n\n More Education Department workers laid off \n\nMore than 200 civil rights workers at the U.S. Education Department are being laid off after an appeals court cleared the way for their dismissal.\n\nAn appeals court last month reversed a lower court decision that blocked the March firings. Department officials cited the ruling in a layoff notice that was sent to Office for Civil Rights workers on Monday and obtained by The Associated Press.\n\nIt adds to more than 400 other layoffs the department announced last week as the Trump administration pressures Democratic lawmakers over the federal shutdown.\n\nA department spokesperson did not immediately comment.\n\nMass layoffs in March nearly halved the Education Department, but a federal judge halted the firing of about 260 Office for Civil Rights workers. Many were being brought back to the agency when an appeals court reversed the decision.\n\n Trump says some Democrat-backed programs won’t return after shutdown \n\nThe president says his administration is using the government shutdown to target federal programs that Democrats like and “they’re never going to come back, in many cases.”\n\n“We are closing up Democrat programs that we disagree with and they’re never going to open again,” he said.\n\nTrump added: “We’re being able to do things that we were unable to do before” during the shutdown, which he blames on Democrats. Democrats blame Republicans, who control both chambers of Congress and the White House.\n\nTrump said officials will present a list of targeted programs on Friday.\n\nHe didn’t provide further details except to say his administration is seeking to terminate “some of the most egregious socialist – semi-communist” programs.\n\n Trump and Hegseth defend Pentagon’s news press policy \n\nDefense Secretary Pete Hegseth said the Pentagon press corps that has objected to the policy should have been “front and center across the board on wanting to give credit to the president” for his ceasefire deal in Gaza, but “Instead, what they want to talk about is a policy about them.”\n\nOutlets including The Associated Press, New York Times and Newsmax have refused to agree to the policy, saying it threatens to punish them for routine news gathering protected by the First Amendment.\n\nTrump said he thought the press is “very dishonest” and said he could see why Hegseth is “bothered” by the press access to the Pentagon.\n\n“It bothers me to have soldiers and, you know, even high-ranking generals walking around with you guys on their sleeve,” Trump said.\n\nTrump suggested he might move the White House press corps out of the building and said, “You’re lucky I’m president because we could move them very easily across the street.”\n\n Trump threatens to revoke Boston’s World Cup matches if authorities don’t get tougher on crime \n\n“We could take them away,” the president said of games in the city that he said were already sold out.\n\n“If somebody is doing a bad job, and if I feel there’s unsafe conditions, I would call Gianni – the head of FIFA who’s phenomenal -- and I would say, “Let’s move into another location” and they would do that.”\n\nTrump meant FIFA head Gianni Infantino. He said Infantino “wouldn’t love to do it, but he’d do it very easily.”\n\nThe president didn’t offer specifics, but suggested that crime threats were hurting Boston and that his administration could solve those.\n\nHe’s already deployed National Guard troops to Washington and Memphis, and Trump’s efforts to increase military presence in Chicago and Portland, Oregon, have sparked legal fights.\n\n Police protecting U.S. Capitol, Congress miss first full paycheck \n\nAs the government shutdown leaves many federal workers furloughed or working without pay, its impact is increasingly being felt in missed paychecks.\n\nThe union representing members of the U.S. Capitol Police — who protect the Capitol, members of Congress and their staff — said that on Friday, officers did not receive a full paycheck.\n\n“The longer the shutdown drags on, the harder it becomes for my officers,” said Gus Papathanasiou, chairman of the union. “Banks and landlords do not give my officers a pass because we are in shutdown – they still expect to be paid.”\n\n Trump threatens to pull aid to Argentina based on election results \n\nTrump, seeming to refer to Argentina’s crucial midterm elections later this month that will be a referendum on Milei’s policies, said that “If he loses, we are not going to be generous with Argentina.”\n\nIt’s not the first time this year Trump has sought to insert himself in the domestic affairs of another country to protect a leader seen as an ally.\n\nThe comments came a day after Trump, while speaking at the Knessett, called for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to be pardoned in the corruption trial he faces. Trump branded the trial a “witch hunt,” a term he used for his own court cases while he was running for president last year.\n\nThe president also called the prosecution against former Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro, for attempting to overturn his 2022 election, a “witch hunt.” Trump then imposed 50% tariffs on the Latin American country and sanctioned its main justice in retaliation.\n\n Treasury secretary meets with Ukranian prime minister \n\nScott Bessent met with Ukrainian Prime Minister Yulia Svyrydenko to reaffirm the U.S.’ “unwavering support for Ukrainian sovereignty.”\n\nA Treasury readout of the meeting states that Bessent stressed the need for European allies to ratchet up pressure on Russia, and any country that purchases Russian oil.\n\n Trump says he’s considering imposing tariffs on Spain \n\nHe said the move could come in retaliation for Spain now following other NATO members and increasing its military spending.\n\nTrump added that Spain is “doing very well off our backs.” He was referring to Spain being the sole member of the 32-nation alliance not to commit to increasing military spending to 5% of GDP.\n\nTrump said that geography ensures that Spain gets NATO protection “automatically” but that what the country had done was “very disrespectful to NATO.”\n\nTrump has previously suggested Spain should be expelled from NATO. He didn’t say that this time, but said of imposing possible tariffs, “I may do that” and that, “I think they should be punished.”\n\nThat’s despite Trump’s administration already having negotiated tariff rates with the European Union, which includes Spain.\n\n Trump tells Hamas to disarm and return dead hostages \n\nTrump says he wants dead hostages held in Gaza back and warns Hamas if “they don’t disarm, we will disarm them.”\n\nThe U.S. president made the comment while speaking at the White House during Argentinian President Javier Milei’s visit.\n\nIt comes after an Israeli military agency declared a “violation” of the truce agreement that it would respond to by halving the number of trucks allowed to bring humanitarian aid into the devastated territory.\n\n Milei gives Trump gold-framed letter nominating him for Nobel Peace Prize \n\nThe glowing letter that the Argentine leader wrote expressed his “deepest admiration” for Trump and his “commitment to peace.”\n\nTrump has long sought a Nobel Peace Prize but suggested he may never be awarded it.\n\nTrump received nominations for the prize this year but many of them occurred after the February deadline for the 2025 award. That fell just a week and a half into his second term.\n\nForeign leaders who’ve sought close relations with the White House have suggested Trump should win the award or said they will nominate him.\n\n Trump explains why U.S. is helping out Argentina \n\nThe U.S. is establishing a $20 billion currency swap line to prop up the Argentine peso — and that assistance is to help a “great philosophy take over a great country,” Trump says.\n\n“Argentina is one of the most beautiful countries that I’ve ever seen,” Trump said.\n\nThe president also stressed that it was helping “our neighbors.”\n\nSecretary of State Marco Rubio added that Argentina was “foremost” among Latin American countries that have “aligned with the United States on issue after issue.”\n\n“I think this is important,” Trump said. “This is our hemisphere.”\n\n Trump and Milei begin their meeting \n\nThe two leaders are holding a working lunch in the Cabinet Room at the White House.\n\n“He’s MAGA all the way,” Trump said of the Argentine leader. It usually refers to Trump’s campaign slogan, “Make America Great Again,” but in this instance, Trump was also using it to say “Make Argentina Great Again.”\n\nMilei, speaking in Spanish, said he was “very honored, especially in this moment when we are giving thanks for Trump’s great leadership.”\n\n“We can follow a peaceful route and make Argentina a strong example for freedom and prosperity,” Milei said.\n\n Trump confirms another US strike against boat in Caribbean \n\nHe said in a post on social media that six people were killed in the strike on the vessel suspected of carrying drugs off the waters of Venezuela. No U.S. forces were harmed.\n\nIt’s the fifth deadly strike in the Caribbean as the Trump administration has asserted that it is treating alleged drug traffickers as unlawful combatants who must be met with military force.\n\nFrustration with the administration has been growing on Capitol Hill among members of both major political parties. Some Republicans are seeking more information from the White House on the legal justification and details of the strikes. Democrats contend the strikes violate U.S. and international law.\n\n▶ Read more about the latest strike.\n\n House Judiciary Committee seeks testimony from Jack Smith \n\nRepublicans on the House Judiciary Committee want the Justice Department special counsel who prosecuted Trump to appear for an interview.\n\nRep. Jim Jordan, the committee chair, charged in a letter to Smith that his team’s prosecutions of Trump were “partisan and politically motivated.” Jordan’s move shows how Republicans are escalating their tactics to go after Trump’s perceived enemies.\n\nSmith pursued two criminal cases against Trump -- for illegally holding classified documents and for interfering in the 2020 election -- but abandoned them after Trump won election last year.\n\nThe House Judiciary Committee has also conducted interviews with other members of Smith’s team, Jordan said, but they declined to answer many questions, citing the Fifth Amendment.\n\n Milei arrives at the White House \n\nThe Argentine leader was greeted warmly by Trump in the West Wing driveway shortly after 1:30 p.m.\n\nThe two men posed for photos, both giving a thumbs-up.\n\nWhen asked by a reporter for his message to Argentina, the U.S. president said: “We love them. We will be there for them.”\n\nTrump added, “and they have a great leader. They have a very great leader.”\n\n Argentina’s leader praises Trump before White House meeting \n\n“Your commitment to life, freedom and peace has restored hope to the world,” President Javier Milei wrote on social media, congratulating the U.S. president on securing a ceasefire deal in Gaza, where a truce is holding after a devastating, two-year Israel-Hamas war.\n\nThe Trump-Milei bromance has already paid off for Argentina — most recently, to the tune of a $20 billion bailout.\n\nExperts say Milei comes to the White House with two clear objectives. One is to negotiate U.S. tariff exemptions or reductions for Argentine products.\n\n▶ Read more about the White House meeting.\n\n Trump takes note of slow return of dead hostages to Israel \n\n“ALL TWENTY HOSTAGES ARE BACK AND FEELING AS GOOD AS CAN BE EXPECTED. A big burden has been lifted, but the job IS NOT DONE,” Trump wrote in a posting on his Truth Social platform. “THE DEAD HAVE NOT BEEN RETURNED, AS PROMISED! Phase Two begins right NOW!!”\n\nHe made no mention in his post of Israel announcing earlier Tuesday that it would halve the flow of aid into the territory as a result of the slow return of the dead.\n\n Trump moves Kirk Medal of Freedom ceremony to Rose Garden \n\nThe president said in a post on social media that he’s moving the ceremony to posthumously honor Charlie Kirk outside at the White House, where he paved over the Rose Garden grass, because the crowd will be “so big and enthusiastic.”\n\nTrump said the new location will allow people to see the changes he’s made, such as the Presidential Walk of Fame where he hung portraits of the previous commanders-in-chief, along with renovations to the Palm Court.\n\nTrump’s post to the entire world also included instructions on how to enter the White House for the event: “Enter through Main South Entrance.”\n\n Some airports decline to show Noem’s video message on government shutdown \n\nAirports in Las Vegas, Charlotte, Phoenix and Westchester County say the Homeland Security secretary’s video goes against their policy or regulations because of its political content.\n\nIn the video, Noem blames Democrats for the federal government shutdown and its impacts on operations to screen travelers. The shutdown has left airports scrambling with flight disruptions.\n\n US rejects bid to buy 167 million tons of coal for less than a penny per ton \n\nThe bid’s price for the coal on public lands in Montana reflected the low appetite for coal among utilities turning to cheaper natural gas and renewables such as wind and solar.\n\nIt would have been the biggest U.S. government coal sale in more than a decade. But coal emissions are a leading driver of climate change, which scientists say is making weather more extreme. Trump has made reviving the coal industry a centerpiece of his energy agenda, but economists say he’s unlikely to reverse its decline.\n\nA Department of Interior statement Tuesday said the $186,000 bid from the Navajo Transitional Energy Co. didn’t meet the requirements of the Mineral Leasing Act. Agency representatives did not provide further details, and it’s unclear if they will attempt another sale.\n\n Maine Gov. Mills to confront Trump again with US Senate campaign \n\nThe New England governor who told Trump to his face that she would see him in court now plans to challenge Maine’s Republican U.S. senator at the ballot box.\n\nDemocratic Gov. Janet Mills cited her White House confrontation in her Tuesday launch video. She told The Associated Press: “I’ll stand up to Trump, just as I did in February.”\n\nMills says she’s running for a broader resistance to Trump and to oust five-term Sen. Susan Collins, who voted for the tax breaks and spending cuts law that reduced food and health care aid for children and low-income Americans.\n\nOther challengers for the Democratic nomination include oyster farmer Graham Platner, who has the backing of Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders.\n\nRead more about the Maine senate race\n\n Advocacy group sues Social Security Administration over access to records \n\nDemocracy Forward filed a lawsuit against the SSA Tuesday, asking a court to compel the release of public records related to policy changes at the agency.\n\nThe plaintiffs allege that SSA’s changes during Trump’s second term — which include mass firings and changes to how benefits are administered — have left millions of retirees and people with disabilities struggling to access the benefits they rely on.\n\nThey seek internal memos, communications, and data about the impact of SSA’s policies.\n\n“Transparency isn’t optional — it’s essential,” Democracy Forward President and CEO Skye Perryman said in a statement. “We’re taking action to demand accountability and ensure the public knows what’s happening behind closed doors.”\n\n Democrats rally in front of White House budget office \n\nCongressional Democrats and laid-off workers are gathering outside the White House’s budget office to decry the Trump administration’s moves to fire federal employees during the shutdown.\n\nSen. Chris Van Hollen, a Maryland Democrat, called it “a lie” and illegal for the White House to use the shutdown to impose mass layoffs.\n\nThe Democrats stood behind people that held signs printed with budget director Russ Vought’s face and his quote about wanting to put federal workers “in trauma.”\n\n“When they viciously attack our federal employees, they are viciously attacking the American people,” Van Hollen said.\n\n GOP House Speaker backs funding transfers to pay troops \n\nMike Johnson says the Trump administration “has every right” to move congressionally-mandated funds around to pay the nation’s troops.\n\n“If the Democrats want to go to court and challenge troops being paid, bring it,” Johnson said at a Capitol press conference.\n\nMoving the funds removes a major pressure point that might have encouraged negotiations over the shutdown. Members of the military were projected to miss their first paycheck on Wednesday.\n\nThe Trump administration is exercising vast leeway both to fire workers — drawing complaints from fellow Republicans and lawsuits from employee unions — and to determine who is paid. Military troops and federal law enforcement agents don’t necessarily have to go without pay thanks to other funding sources as well as the billions made available in Trump’s One Big Beautiful Bill Act, which is now law.\n\n▶ Read more about the latest shutdown related developments\n\n House speaker rallying global support to nominate Trump for the next Nobel Peace Prize \n\nMike Johnson says he and the speaker of the Israeli Knesset are starting a project to rally global leaders to support Trump’s nomination for next year’s Nobel Peace Prize.\n\nConservatives have hailed Trump’s effort to broker a ceasefire deal between Israel and Hamas and say he deserves the annual award.\n\n“Under his leadership, we are witnessing the dawn of a new golden age, not just for America but for the entire free world,” the Louisiana Republican, said at a news conference.\n\n ICE using full-body restraints during deportations, raising concerns over inhumane treatment \n\nU.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers have been using a full-body restraint device called the WRAP during deportations. The Associated Press spoke to a number of people who said they were placed in the device after they had already been shackled.\n\nThe manufacturer says the device is intended for violent individuals, but detainees claim it is used to intimidate or punish them.\n\nICE’s use of the WRAP has continued despite safety concerns expressed two years ago by a watchdog division of its parent agency, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security.\n\nA DHS spokesperson says ICE’s use of the restraints is “fully in line with established legal standards.”\n\n▶ Read more from the AP’s investigation into ICE’s use of full-body restraints\n\n Trump’s ‘big bill’ helps pay Coast Guard salaries in shutdown \n\nThe administration has begun tapping funds from Trump’s tax breaks and budget law to start paying for priorities during the shutdown — in this case, ensuring the Coast Guard doesn’t go without paychecks.\n\nHomeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said in a statement that thanks to “the One Big Beautiful Bill, the brave men and women of the US Coast Guard will not miss a paycheck this week.”\n\nTrump had already instructed the Department of Defense to make sure military service members are paid. The Pentagon announced it would do so with $8 billion in unused research and development funds.\n\nThe law includes more than $300 billion in new funds for the military as well as for DHS and Trump’s mass deportation agenda.\n\n White House budget office prepared for long shutdown standoff \n\nThe office led by budget director Russ Vought also said in a social media post that it will continue implementing reduction-in-force plans to fire federal workers.\n\nThe post said the office would “pay the troops, pay law enforcement, continue the RIFs, and wait.”\n\nMany in Washington are digging in for a prolonged government funding fight. The shutdown is already well into its second week.\n\n Pennsylvania man pleads guilty in arson at governor’s mansion while Shapiro’s family slept \n\nA man who scaled an iron security fence, eluded police and used beer bottles filled with gasoline to ignite the occupied Pennsylvania governor’s mansion pleaded guilty Tuesday to attempted murder.\n\nCody Balmer, 38, was sentenced to 25 to 50 years in prison after he also entered pleas to terrorism, 22 counts of arson, aggravated arson, burglary, aggravated assault of Gov. Josh Shapiro, 21 counts of reckless endangerment and loitering in the April 13 attack that did millions of dollars in damage to the state-owned brick building.\n\nShapiro and his family were awakened and evacuated hours after celebrating the Jewish holiday of Passover. Balmer told police after turning himself in that he had planned to beat Shapiro with a sledgehammer, according to court documents.\n\n▶ Read more about the attack on the Pennsylvania governor’s mansion\n\n Supreme Court rejects Jones’ appeal of $1.4 billion Sandy Hook judgment \n\nThe Supreme Court on Tuesday rejected an appeal from conspiracy theorist Alex Jones and left in place the $1.4 billion judgment against him over his description of the 2012 Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting as a hoax staged by crisis actors.\n\nThe Infowars host had argued that a judge was wrong to find him liable for defamation and infliction of emotional distress without holding a trial on the merits of allegations lodged by relatives of victims of the shooting, which killed 20 first graders and six educators in Newtown, Connecticut.\n\nThe justices did not comment on their order, which they issued without even asking the families of the Sandy Hook victims to respond to Jones’ appeal.\n\n▶ Read more about Jones’ rejection by the Supreme Court\n\n Barack Obama appears in ad urging California voters to counter Trump \n\nBarack Obama is entering the fight for U.S. House control by appearing in a 30-second ad urging California voters to approve a ballot proposal that could add as many as five Democrat-held House seats from California.\n\n“Republicans want to steal enough seats in Congress to rig the next election and wield unchecked power for two more years,” Obama says, looking directly into the camera. “You can stop Republicans in their tracks.”\n\nProposition 50 is aimed at offsetting Trump’s moves in Texas and elsewhere to help win more Republican seats in the 2026 midterm election. Voting is underway and concludes Nov. 4. Republicans hold a 219-213 House majority, with three vacancies.\n\nDemocratic Gov. Gavin Newsom has framed the election as a referendum on all things Trump, who is unpopular in liberal-leaning California outside of his conservative base. Republicans call it a Democratic power grab that would override an independent commission created by voters.\n\n News outlets face Pentagon ouster for refusing to sign defense secretary’s pre-approval rules \n\nMajor news organizations say they won’t sign a Defense Department document about its new press rules, making it likely the Trump administration will evict their reporters from the Pentagon.\n\nPete Hegseth reacted to their refusal by posting a hand-waving emoji on X. His team has said that reporters who don’t acknowledge the policy in writing by Tuesday must turn in badges admitting them to the Pentagon and clear out their workspaces the next day.\n\nThe new rules bar journalist access to large swaths of the Pentagon without an escort and say Hegseth can revoke press access to reporters who ask anyone in the Defense Department for information — classified or otherwise — that he has not approved for release.\n\nThe New York Times, The Associated Press, the conservative Newsmax television network, The Washington Post, The Atlantic and Reuters, among other outlets, say the policy threatens to punish routine news gathering protected by the First Amendment.\n\n▶ Read more about the Pentagon and the media\n\n Trump complains that the photo of him on Time Magazine is ‘the Worst of All Time’ \n\nThe president posted a lament on social media early Tuesday morning about a signature subject: his hair.\n\nTrump has long been known for his swoopy blonde hair, but on the latest issue of Time recognizing his ceasefire deal in Gaza, he feels his locks are lacking.\n\n“They ‘disappeared’ my hair, and then had something floating on top of my head that looked like a floating crown, but an extremely small one. Really weird!” the president wrote.\n\nThe president also complained that the shot is taken facing up, showing more neck and chin than he seemed to prefer.\n\n“This is a super bad picture, and deserves to be called out,” he wrote. “What are they doing, and why?”","summary":"President Donald Trump has awarded the nation’s highest civilian honor, the Presidential Medal of Freedom, posthumously to Charlie Kirk on Tuesday","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/trump-charlie-kirk-javier-milei-argentina-state-department-b2845531.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/10/15/00/Trump_Argentina_58213.jpg?width=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-10-14 23:37:02","author":"The Associated Press","authors":["The Associated Press"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.111},{"id":369298876,"title":"Van Hollen: We Won't Vote to Open Government Because Trump's Firing Government Employees","text":"On Tuesday’s broadcast of CNN’s “The Arena,” Sen. Chris Van Hollen (D-MD) responded to a question on why Senate Democrats won’t vote for a clean continuing resolution, by saying it’s “because we’ve seen what’s happened since day one of the administration,” “They have fired federal employees in the absence of a shutdown. In fact, they have less legal authority to fire federal employees in a shutdown than in the absence of a shutdown.” And federal workers “want some kind of assurance that this kind of illegal activity won’t continue. But Trump’s unwilling to do that.”\n\nVan Hollen said, “I’ve now voted seven times in the Senate, and will vote an eighth time this evening, to keep the federal government open, but to do so without giving Donald Trump a total blank check to continue his illegal activities, which, from day one, have harmed federal employees, and to deal with the healthcare crisis that is about to be triggered because Republicans left a ticking time bomb on health care. And we would like to have a discussion with the president of the United States. He’s been working to try to bring an end to the conflict in the Middle East. But he is unwilling to address the situation right here at home and talk to Democrats about ending the Trump shutdown. And you mentioned the earlier record shutdown, remember, that was during Trump’s first administration. We’re now in the second Trump shutdown.”\n\nHost Kasie Hunt then asked, “But let’s be realistic, Democrats could decide, Sen. Chuck Schumer (D-NY) could decide to vote to pass the CR, again. Why not do that?”\n\nVan Hollen responded, “Well, because we’ve seen what’s happened since day one of the administration, right? They have fired federal employees in the absence of a shutdown. In fact, they have less legal authority to fire federal employees in a shutdown than in the absence of a shutdown. The judge will decide a preliminary motion in that case tomorrow. But they’ve had Elon Musk and his chainsaw since day one. I just met today, Kasie, with fired federal employees from much earlier in the administration. So, what I’m hearing from federal employees is they want some kind of assurance that this kind of illegal activity won’t continue. But Trump’s unwilling to do that. He’s willing to give the president of Argentina $20 billion of taxpayer money, but he’s not willing to work to end this shutdown.”\n\nFollow Ian Hanchett on Twitter @IanHanchett","summary":"On Tuesday&#8217;s broadcast of CNN&#8217;s &#8220;The Arena,&#8221; Sen.
