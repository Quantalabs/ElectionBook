You know it,\" he wrote on X earlier this month.In another post, the wealthy GOP donor who recently forecasted that he'd step back from political donations threatened to fire lawmakers who \"betrayed the American people\".When Trump clapped back to say he was disappointed with Musk, back-and-forth fighting erupted and quickly escalated. Musk suggested without evidence that Trump, who spent the first part of the year as one of his closest allies, was mentioned in files related to sex abuser Jeffrey Epstein.Musk ultimately tried to make nice with the administration, saying he regretted some of his posts that \"went too far\".Trump responded in kind in an interview with The New York Post, saying, \"Things like that happen. I don't blame him for anything.\" It's unclear how Musk's latest broadsides will influence the fragile peace he and the president had enjoyed in recent weeks. The White House didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.Musk has spent recent weeks focused on his businesses, and his political influence has waned since he left the administration.Still, the wealthy businessman poured hundreds of millions of dollars into Trump's campaign in 2024, demonstrating the impact his money can have if he's passionate enough about an issue or candidate to restart his political spending.(You can now subscribe to our Economic Times WhatsApp channel)\n\nRead More News onElon Musk criticism Trump billjobs impact Trump tax billRepublican Party political futureSenate vote Trump tax billTrump Fourth of July deadlinetax spending cuts legislationMusk SpaceX Tesla commentsMusk government efficiencyTeslatrump\n\n(Catch all the Business News, Breaking News, Budget 2025 Events and Latest News Updates on The Economic Times.)

He credited Netanyahu with playing a key role in what he called a \"Great Success\" in curbing Iran's nuclear threat. “It is terrible what they are doing in Israel to Bibi Netanyahu. He is a War Hero, and a Prime Minister who did a fabulous job working with the United States to bring Great Success in getting rid of the dangerous Nuclear threat in Iran.”, Trump wrote.Highlighting the Israeli leader’s current diplomatic efforts, Trump emphasized that Netanyahu is in the middle of crucial negotiations with Hamas aimed at securing the release of hostages.

The two remaining cases claim he sought to secure more favorable media coverage from prominent Israeli news outlets.If convicted, he could face up to 10 years in prison.

An executive order that the Republican president signed on his first day back in office in January would restrict birthright citizenship - a far-reaching plan that three federal judges, questioning its constitutionality, quickly halted nationwide through so-called \"universal\" injunctions. But the Supreme Court's ruling on Friday, while announcing a dramatic shift in how judges have operated for years deploying such relief, left enough room for the challengers to Trump's directive to try to prevent it from taking effect while litigation over its legality plays out. \"I do not expect the president's executive order on birthright citizenship will ever go into effect,\" said Samuel Bray, a Notre Dame Law School professor and a prominent critic of universal injunctions whose work the court's majority cited extensively in Friday's ruling. Trump's executive order directs federal agencies to refuse to recognize the citizenship of children born in the United States who do not have at least one parent who is an American citizen or lawful permanent resident, also called a \"green card\" holder.Live Events The three judges found that the order likely violates citizenship language in the U.S. Constitution's 14th Amendment. The directive remains blocked while lower courts reconsider the scope of their injunctions, and the Supreme Court said it cannot take effect for 30 days, a window that gives the challengers time to seek further protection from those courts. The court's six conservative justices delivered the majority ruling, granting Trump's request to narrow the injunctions issued by the judges in Maryland, Washington and Massachusetts. Its three liberal members dissented. The ruling by Justice Amy Coney Barrett, who Trump appointed to the court in 2020, emphasized the need to hem in the power of judges, warning against an \"imperial\" judiciary. Judges can provide \"complete relief\" only to the plaintiffs before them, Barrett wrote. A HOST OF POLICIES That outcome was a major victory for Trump and his allies, who have repeatedly denounced judges who have impeded his agenda. It could make it easier for the administration to implement his policies, including to accelerate deportations of migrants, restrict transgender rights, curtail diversity and inclusion efforts, and downsize the federal government - many of which have tested the limits of executive power. In the birthright citizenship dispute, the ruling left open the potential for individual plaintiffs to seek relief beyond themselves through class action lawsuits targeting a policy that would upend the long-held understanding that the Constitution confers citizenship on virtually anyone born on U.S. soil. Bray said he expects a surge of new class action cases, resulting in \"class-protective\" injunctions. \"Given that the birthright-citizenship executive order is unconstitutional, I expect courts will grant those preliminary injunctions, and they will be affirmed on appeal,\" Bray said. Some of the challengers have already taken that path. Plaintiffs in the Maryland case, including expectant mothers and immigrant advocacy groups, asked the presiding judge who had issued a universal injunction to treat the case as a class action to protect all children who would be ineligible for birthright citizenship if the executive order takes effect. \"I think in terms of the scope of the relief that we'll ultimately get, there is no difference,\" said William Powell, one of the lawyers for the Maryland plaintiffs. \"We're going to be able to get protection through the class action for everyone in the country whose baby could potentially be covered by the executive order, assuming we succeed.\" The ruling also sidestepped a key question over whether states that bring lawsuits might need an injunction that applies beyond their borders to address their alleged harms, directing lower courts to answer it first. STATES CHALLENGE DIRECTIVE The challenge to Trump's directive also included 22 states, most of them Democratic-governed, who argued that the financial and administrative burdens they would face required a nationwide block on Trump's order. George Mason University constitutional law expert Ilya Somin said the practical consequences of the ruling will depend on various issues not decided so far by the Supreme Court. \"As the majority recognizes, states may be entitled to much broader relief than individuals or private groups,\" Somin said. New Jersey Attorney General Matthew Platkin, a Democrat who helped lead the case brought in Massachusetts, disagreed with the ruling but sketched out a path forward on Friday. The ruling, Platkin said in a statement, \"recognized that nationwide orders can be appropriate to protect the plaintiffs themselves from harm - which is true, and has always been true, in our case.\" Platkin committed to \"keep challenging President Trump's flagrantly unlawful order, which strips American babies of citizenship for the first time since the Civil War\" of 1861-1865. Legal experts said they expect a lot of legal maneuvering in lower courts in the weeks ahead, and the challengers still face an uphill battle. Compared to injunctions in individual cases, class actions are often harder to successfully mount. States, too, still do not know whether they have the requisite legal entitlement to sue. Trump's administration said they do not, but the court left that debate unresolved. Meanwhile, the 30-day clock is ticking. If the challengers are unsuccessful going forward, Trump's order could apply in some parts of the country, but not others. \"The ruling is set to go into effect 30 days from now and leaves families in states across the country in deep uncertainty about whether their children will be born as U.S. citizens,\" said Elora Mukherjee, director of Columbia Law School's immigrants' rights clinic.(You can now subscribe to our Economic Times WhatsApp channel)\n\nRead More News ontrumpsupreme courtcolumbia law schooldonald trumpbirthright citizenshipTrump birthright citizenshipTrump newsgeorge mason universityUS newsUS trump news\n\n(Catch all the Business News, Breaking News, Budget 2025 Events and Latest News Updates on The Economic Times.)

The conti-nent was already reeling from the war in Ukraine and increasingly worried about the specter of Russian aggression. Now, new leadership in Washington is casting doubt on its commitment to the defense of Europe-an allies.\n\nIn the eyes of Europeans, even the U.S. nuclear umbrella, which for de-cades has shielded the continent from outside threats, no longer seems fully dependable. “I want to believe that the United States will stay by our side,” French President Emmanuel Macron said in March. “But we have to be pre-pared for that not to be the case.”\n\nThe way forward, Macron has ar-gued, is to protect the continent from attack without relying on the deterrent power of American nuclear weapons. France’s contribution, he has suggest-ed, might be to put its own nuclear arsenal in the service of its European neighbors.\n\nIt is too early to tell what will come of the French president’s offer. A simi-lar proposal Macron made in 2020 was ignored in other European capitals. But the continent’s geopolitical predic-ament has grown much direr in the years since, and the probability of an attack on European NATO members is now at a level not seen since the late 1970s. Given that reality and the seem-ing indifference of the Trump admin-istration to it, the continent needs to rethink its own deterrence strategies. If the American nuclear umbrella is no longer open, Europe might need one of its own. Ironically, this would run counter to U.S. President Donald Trump’s ambition, stated in 2017, to “de-nuke” the world.\n\nThe credibility of any nuclear de-terrent rests on two pillars: having the right capabilities and having the resolve to use them. Judged by those criteria, neither Macron’s proposal nor any other option for an independent Eu-ropean nuclear deterrent currently passes muster. But even if the moment for Europe to decouple its security from that of the United States has not yet arrived, the continent’s leaders must prepare for the possibility that it may before long. And that means beginning to take serious stock of their nuclear options. In the short term, doing so will signal that Washington needs to take Europe’s deterrence concerns seriously. But it would also lay a foundation on which Europe could build should its fears of abandonment by the United States really come true.\n\nFROM PROTEST TO PROLIFERATION?\n\nHistorically, most European coun-tries have viewed nuclear weapons with skepticism and, in some cases, outright hostility. Antinuclear sentiment peaked in the 1980s, when NATO’s “dual track” decision, which included plans to sta-tion American intermediate-range nuclear weapons in Western Europe, set off massive protests in cities across the region. Popular opposition was fueled in part by the belief that U.S. nuclear weapons were not a deterrent against Soviet aggression, as NATO leaders argued, but a vehicle for reck-less provocation and warmongering. The 1983 film The Day After offered a fictionalized preview of what might lie in store: a U.S.- Soviet confrontation in Berlin spiraling into a small-scale nu-clear war and, eventually, a global nucle-ar wipeout. Among the record number of dystopian nuclear-themed works of science fiction to have come out of the 1980s, many played on such fears.\n\nIn reality, what followed was not Ar-mageddon but détente. The Americans and the Soviets agreed to limit their ar-senals, and those agreements held after the Soviet Union fell and Russia took its place. As the Cold War receded into history, fears of nuclear war abated.\n\nBut in European policymaking cir-cles, resistance to the logic of nuclear deterrence persisted. Outside Europe’s two nuclear powers, France and the United Kingdom, European officials and thinkers still tend to associate all things nuclear with destruction more than with deterrence.\n\nEven so, the war in Ukraine has brought the nuclear issue back into focus, mainly in light of a renewed and growing nuclear threat from Russia. Part of the problem is the sheer size and potency of Russia’s arsenal of around 5,580 nuclear warheads. It is unclear how many of those warheads are meant to target central or western Europe. But the dozens of nuclear war-heads Russia has stationed in Belarus are cause for concern, as they could easily strike NATO countries such as Latvia, Lithuania, and Poland.\n\nMore worrying than the arsenal it-self, however, is Russia’s potential will-ingness to use it, including as a means of coercion and blackmail. Russian President Vladimir Putin’s repeated nuclear threats against Ukraine and its European supporters portend trouble for the rest of the continent, particu-larly in conjunction with the ongoing reorganization and modernization of Russia’s armed forces. Russia appears to be reorienting its military capabili-ties and strategy toward the possibility of protracted conflict with Europe. It also aims to increase active military per-sonnel from 1.3 million to 1.5 million by 2027, raising the possibility of a return to Soviet-style mass mobilization.\n\nEven as the geopolitical danger from the East has increased, the protection afforded by the American nuclear um-brella no longer seems guaranteed, at least not since Trump took office for the second time in January. Of course the United States still has the ability to provide Europe with a credible nu-clear deterrent. What is increasingly uncertain is whether, under Trump, it still wants to do so. Trump and those around him have repeatedly suggested that the United States might not come to its allies’ rescue if they were attacked, musing about pulling U.S. troops out of Europe and implying that Washington might not defend NATO members that do not spend sufficiently on their own defense.\n\nTo be sure, such rhetoric may just be an attempt to pressure European allies into higher defense spending. To actu-ally push those allies out from under-neath the American nuclear umbrella would undermine the United States’ status as a superpower, alienate some of the most important partners in its geo-political competition with China and Russia, reduce its leverage over Europe, and perhaps open the door to nuclear proliferation on the continent. But se-curity experts could find themselves in a similar position to that of economists: despite near-total expert consensus that tariffs will spark a trade war and hurt the U.S. economy, Trump plowed ahead. In the economic realm, such missteps are harmful. In the domain of nation-al security, the ramifications could be existential.\n\nAs the former U.S. diplomat and po-litical scientist Ivo Daalder wrote in For-eign Affairs earlier this year, the prin-ciple of collective defense enshrined in NATO’s founding treaty “derives its credibility less from the formal treaty than from a belief among the members that they are all prepared to come to one another’s defense.” Potential aggressors must believe the same thing. Europe’s entire post–Cold War security architec-ture rests on this belief. To throw it into doubt risks undermining the entire sys-tem from within and without.\n\nSo far, European debates on how to establish deterrence without U.S. assis-tance have centered on conventional, nonnuclear military capabilities, and understandably so. The limited conven-tional military capabilities of European NATO members could tempt Russia into carrying out a limited attack—seiz-ing a small piece of territory from one of its Baltic neighbors, say, or engaging a European military vessel—with the expectation that it would not suffer any serious consequences. If such an attack took place and Europe lacked the means for an appropriate military response, NATO’s credibility would be shattered. Recognizing that danger, most Europe-an countries have pledged significant increases in defense spending. It will likely take several years for those in-vestments to fill the gaps, but at least the necessary political decisions have been made and there is broad public support for them.\n\nA potential European nuclear de-terrent is a different matter. European politicians have sporadically expressed concern about the nuclear threat from Russia, and defense experts have begun discussing Europe’s nuclear options more seriously. What is lacking, howev-er, is an informed public debate, despite Macron’s recent proposal.\n\nThe conditions for such a debate are better than they have been in years. Before Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, polling indicated that in four European countries that hosted U.S. nuclear weapons—Belgium, Ger-many, Italy, and the Netherlands—a plurality of respondents opposed such hosting arrangements. By contrast, in a March poll of nine European coun-tries, 61 percent of respondents said they would welcome a French nuclear umbrella covering the entire continent.\n\nAn extended nuclear deterrent of this type, provided by France but ide-ally also supplemented by the United Kingdom, would certainly merit clos-er scrutiny if the United States further diluted or even disavowed its security guarantees. Two other options, which seem less pertinent because they are even more controversial, also deserve attention. One is a collective nuclear de-terrent: that is, an arsenal that would be controlled by a pan-European in-stitution. The other is the acquisition of nuclear weapons by additional Eu-ropean states. If Europe chose any of these paths, it would need to meet two criteria to make its nuclear deterrent credible. First, its arsenal would have to be sufficiently large, technically so-phisticated, and capable of surviving a first strike. Second, whoever controlled the arsenal would have to demonstrate a willingness to use it.\n\nSOVEREIGNTY VS. SOLIDARITY\n\nOf the three options, only one has been seriously discussed so far: an extended nuclear deterrent provided primarily by France, with complemen-tary support from the United Kingdom. The new German chancellor, Friedrich Merz, has indicated interest in such an arrangement, even if he has said it would serve only to supplement Amer-ican nuclear guarantees, not to replace them. And in May, France and Poland signed a treaty to deepen their security ties, a step that Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk described as a step toward a potential French nuclear umbrella for his country.\n\nAs of today, however, French and British nuclear capabilities raise se-rious credibility concerns. Some 290 French nuclear warheads are ready for deployment; the United Kingdom can provide another 225. Taken togeth-er, that is a mere ten percent of what Russia can field.\n\nDeterrence is no simple numbers game, but a gap this wide is a clear lia-bility, for reasons of both objective and perceived weakness. For one thing, it effectively restricts European allies to what nuclear experts call “deterrence by punishment.” Such deterrence rests on the threat of overwhelming retali-ation—attack us, and we will respond by laying waste to your cities. For that threat to work, one’s own nuclear assets must be able to survive the enemy’s ini-tial attack. France certainly has that ca-pability, since most of its warheads are deployed on submarines, which are no-toriously hard to detect and destroy. But what if the aggressor used low-yield tac-tical weapons, and what if the target lay on the far edges of the Franco-British nuclear umbrella? Would France and the United Kingdom, which lack tacti-cal nuclear warheads of their own, be willing to use their high-yield strategic arsenal in response—and risk total annihilation if the enemy responded in kind?\n\nContinues in FOREIGN AFFAIRS (https:// www.foreignaffairs.com), June 24, 2025.","summary":"&#8230; And Why They May Be The Only Path To Security The early months of the second Trump administration have left Europe adrift.

But the tally was tight and voting came to a standstill as Vice-President J D Vance arrived at the Capitol to break a potential tie. Several Republican senators were registering their opposition to proceeding to open debate on the bill.

Republicans are using their majorities in Congress to push aside Democratic opposition, but they have run into a series of political and policy setbacks. Not all GOP lawmakers are on board with proposals to reduce spending on Medicaid, food stamps and other programs as a way to help cover the cost of extending some USD 3.8 trillion in Trump tax breaks. Also Read | US Senate Reduces Remittance Tax to 1% From 3.5% in Relief for NRIs. Ahead of the expected roll call, the White House released a statement of administrative policy saying it “strongly supports passage” of the bill that “implements critical aspects” of the president's agenda. Trump himself was at his golf course in Virginia on Saturday with GOP senators posting about it on social media. \"It's time to get this legislation across the finish line,\" Senate Majority Leader John Thune said. But as the day dragged, billionaire Elon Musk lashed out, calling the package “utterly insane and destructive.” “The latest Senate draft bill will destroy millions of jobs in America and cause immense strategic harm to our country!” the former top Trump aide said in a post. The 940-page bill was released shortly before midnight Friday, and senators are expected to grind through the days ahead with hours of potentially all-night debate and countless amendments. Senate passage could be days away, and the bill would need to return to the House for a final round of votes before it could reach the White House. With the narrow Republican majorities in the House and Senate, leaders need almost every lawmaker on board in the face of essentially unified opposition from Democrats. Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer said Republicans dropped the bill “in the dead of night” and are rushing to finish the bill before the public fully knows what's in it. He is expected to call for a full reading of the text in the Senate, which would take hours. Make-or-break moment for GOP The weekend session could be a make-or-break moment for Trump's party, which has invested much of its political capital on his signature domestic policy plan. Trump is pushing Congress to wrap it up, even as he sometimes gives mixed signals, allowing for more time. At recent events at the White House, including Friday, Trump has admonished the “grandstanders” among GOP holdouts to fall in line. The legislation is an ambitious but complicated series of GOP priorities. At its core, it would make permanent many of the tax breaks from Trump's first term that would otherwise expire by year's end if Congress fails to act, resulting in a potential tax increase on Americans. The bill would add new breaks, including no taxes on tips, and commit USD 350 billion to national security, including for Trump's mass deportation agenda. But the cutbacks to Medicaid, food stamps and green energy investments, which a top Democrat, Senator Ron Wyden of Oregon, said would be a “death sentence” for America's wind and solar industries, are also causing dissent within GOP ranks. The Republicans are relying on the reductions to offset the lost tax revenues but some lawmakers say the cuts go too far, particularly for people receiving health care through Medicaid. Meanwhile, conservatives, worried about the nation's debt, are pushing for steeper cuts. Senator Thom Tillis, who said he spoke with Trump late Friday explaining his concerns, announced Saturday that he cannot support the package as is, largely because of the changes to health care that he said would force his state to “make painful decisions like eliminating Medicaid coverage for hundreds of thousands.” Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky has been opposed to the bill's provision to raise the nation's debt limit by USD 5 trillion. And GOP Senator Tim Sheehy of Montana said he would agree to proceeding only after being assured a provision for public lands sales he opposes would be taken out with an amendment. After setbacks, Republicans revise some proposals The release of that draft had been delayed as the Senate parliamentarian reviewed the bill to ensure it complied with the chamber's strict “Byrd Rule\", named for the late Senator Robert C. Byrd. It largely bars policy matters from inclusion in budget bills unless a provision can get 60 votes to overcome objections. That would be a tall order in a Senate with a 53-47 GOP edge and Democrats unified against Trump's bill. Republicans suffered a series of setbacks after several proposals, including shifting food stamp costs from the federal government to the states or gutting the funding structure of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, were deemed out of compliance with the rules. But over the past days, Republicans have quickly revised those proposals and reinstated them.

It would result in tens of billions of dollars in lost funding for North Carolina, including our hospitals and rural communities. This will force the state to make painful decisions like eliminating Medicaid coverage for hundreds of thousands in the expansion population, and even reducing critical services for those in the traditional Medicaid population.”\n\nTillis urged Senate leaders to return to the House’s Medicaid reforms, which include work requirements for some able-bodied adults and anti-fraud measures. He praised the rest of the bill, including the extension of the Trump Tax Cuts, expansion of the child tax credit, historic border security investments, and efforts to end wasteful spending. “We can and must accomplish this without hurting our rural communities and hospitals,” he said.\n\nTillis has played a central role in shaping the legislation up to this point. One provision he inserted has sparked fierce backlash from conservatives and consumer advocates. That provision would impose a new tax on profits earned by third-party entities that finance civil litigation. Consumers’ Research launched a campaign targeting Tillis, accusing him of doing the bidding of the Chamber of Commerce and major corporations. The group warned that the measure would make it harder for everyday Americans to fight back against powerful companies. Executive Director Will Hild contended that the provision is “needlessly broad” and undermines “one of the few tools the average American consumer has to fight back against corporate political activists.” A mobile billboard condemning Tillis circled the Capitol on Thursday as pressure builds on Senate leaders to strike the language before a vote.\n\nDemocrats have seized on the Medicaid debate to amplify talking points from left-wing groups and industry-paid advocates. Their claims that the bill would lead to mass rural hospital closures rely on questionable studies and deeply partisan sources. One often-cited report comes from the University of North Carolina’s Sheps Center, whose leadership promotes radical gender ideologies and has a long track record of support for Democrat priorities. Other studies funded by Manatt Health Strategies include projections about cuts to coverage for illegal aliens and able-bodied adults who refuse to work. Critics note that only 4.9 percent of Medicaid inpatient hospital spending currently goes to rural hospitals. They argue that the bill would actually strengthen Medicaid by focusing resources on the most vulnerable and ending funding for illegal immigrants and fraudulent programs.\n\nTillis’s opposition comes as the Senate parliamentarian struck several major Medicaid provisions from the bill, including the provider tax used to pay for the Trump Tax Cuts. The ruling also removed language that would block Medicaid coverage for transgender procedures and benefits for illegal aliens. These decisions complicate how Republicans plan to offset the cost of the bill and limit what can be included under reconciliation rules. Senate Majority Leader John Thune told – News Saturday that Republicans expected many of the challenges and have prepared backup plans. He emphasized the goal remains to pass a final version that reflects the House’s priorities while advancing Trump’s agenda.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nSenator Thom Tillis (R-NC) says he will vote against moving forward with&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Thom Tillis Opposes Trump Bill Due to Medicaid Cuts: &#8216;I Cannot Support It&#8217; first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/news/thom-tillis-opposes-trump-bill-due-to-medicaid-cuts-i-cannot-support-it/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/rewrite-this-title-Thom-Tillis-Turns-on-Trump-Bill-Over.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-06-29 00:47:29","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.022},{"id":336272350,"title":"World News | 'Never Heard of This Ridiculous Idea': Trump Rejects Reports of US Considering USD 30 Billion Deal with Iran to Build Non-military Nuclear Facilities","text":"Washington DC [US], June 29 (ANI): US President Donald Trump dismissed reports suggesting his administration is considering a USD 30 billion deal with Iran to develop civilian nuclear facilities.\nIn a post on Truth Social, Trump wrote, \"Who in the Fake News Media is the SleazeBag saying that \"President Trump wants to give Iran $30 Billion to build non-military Nuclear facilities.\" Never heard of this ridiculous idea.

Also Read | US Senate Reduces Remittance Tax to 1% From 3.5% in Relief for NRIs. The criticisms reopen a recent fiery conflict between the former head of the Department of Government Efficiency and the administration he recently left. They also represent yet another headache for Republican Senate leaders who have spent the weekend working overtime to get the legislation through their chamber so it can pass by Trump's Fourth of July deadline. Musk previously made his opinions about Trump's “big, beautiful bill” clear. Days after he left the federal government last month with a laudatory celebration in the Oval Office, he blasted the bill as “pork-filled” and a “disgusting abomination\". “Shame on those who voted for it: you know you did wrong. You know it,” he wrote on X earlier this month. In another post, the wealthy GOP donor who recently forecasted that he'd step back from political donations threatened to fire lawmakers who “betrayed the American people\". When Trump clapped back to say he was disappointed with Musk, back-and-forth fighting erupted and quickly escalated. Musk suggested without evidence that Trump, who spent the first part of the year as one of his closest allies, was mentioned in files related to sex abuser Jeffrey Epstein. Musk ultimately tried to make nice with the administration, saying he regretted some of his posts that “went too far\". Trump responded in kind in an interview with The New York Post, saying, “Things like that happen. I don't blame him for anything.” It's unclear how Musk's latest broadsides will influence the fragile peace he and the president had enjoyed in recent weeks. The White House didn't immediately respond to a request for comment. Musk has spent recent weeks focused on his businesses, and his political influence has waned since he left the administration. Still, the wealthy businessman poured hundreds of millions of dollars into Trump's campaign in 2024, demonstrating the impact his money can have if he's passionate enough about an issue or candidate to restart his political spending.

The students were a driving force behind nationwide demonstrations, which had started nearly eight months earlier, after the collapse of a renovated concrete rail station roof in Novi Sad, which killed 16 people.\nAlso Read | US Senate Reduces Remittance Tax to 1% From 3.5% in Relief for NRIs.\nThe deadly collapse last November became a turning point for frustrations with the government.

Under pressure, Prime Minister Milos Vucevic resigned at the start of this year; however, President Vucic remains in power.\nAl Jazeera reported that hours before the rally at Slavija Square and Nemanjina Avenue, Vucic's party sent in buses of its own supporters from other parts of the country, many wearing T-shirts reading: \"We won't give up Serbia\". They were joining supporters who have been camping near Vucic's office in central Belgrade since mid-March.\nAl Jazeera reported that President Vucic, whose Progressive Party-led coalition holds 156 of 250 parliamentary seats, told reporters on Saturday that unspecified \"foreign powers\" were behind the protest and said that police should be restrained, but warned that \"thugs will face justice\".\nAccording to Al Jazeera, President Vucic had previously refused snap elections and has been intent on continuing his second term, which will end in 2027, when the parliamentary elections are also scheduled.

Also Read | Donald Trump Warns of Fresh Strikes on Iran, Slams Ayatollah Khamenei Over 'Victory' Claims in Recent War With Israel. Singapore increased its security levels after the recent Israeli attacks on Iran and the counterattacks, with police and other agencies stepping up patrols and checks, Shanmugam said at a community function, adding that while there is a ceasefire between the two countries, \"we don't know exactly what will happen after this\". \"Singapore, as I have said many times, if we get attacked, you will get international headlines. So, on both sides -- the far right, attacking Muslims, or representatives of Muslim countries including Iran, is a possibility; and likewise, you could get attacks on Western assets -- American, European, Israeli,\" he said. Also Read | US Senate Reduces Remittance Tax to 1% From 3.5% in Relief for NRIs. He added that Singapore is working off different scenarios because you can \"never be absolutely sure\". Security is a joint responsibility, and the government has been trying to increase awareness through the SGSecure (Singapore security) programme, the minister added. \"We have been trying for years, it goes up and it comes down -- because it's safe, people leave their items around,\" Shanmugam said. \"I have asked the security agencies to try with what I call a 'cold start' and leave things in places, see how many people actually pick them up; pick them up meaning they notice them and notify the agencies. I think the results tell us that the awareness is not very high,\" he added. Asked if \"more suspicious activities or extreme activities\" are being detected, Shanmugam said, \"Not that we have picked up here yet. But they need to succeed only once.\" Since 2015, the Internal Security Department of the police has dealt with 17 youths aged 20 and below under the stringent Internal Security Act, the Ministry of Home Affairs said in a statement on April 2. At least one case has been identified as an “East Asian Supremacist”, believing that Han Chinese, Korean and Japanese ethnicities were superior to Malays and Indians, according to the MHA statement. The home affairs minister also spoke about Thailand's move to recriminalise cannabis. On Tuesday, Thailand's health ministry issued an order prohibiting the sale of cannabis for recreational use, making it mandatory for any retail purchase to require a doctor's prescription. Singapore is looking out for possible outflows (of drugs) to the country, Shanmugam said. \"The nexus between drugs and crime, and terrorism, also needs to be looked at. Many different issues. We try to maintain our openness and our connectivity, and our business-friendly environment. \"Our security agencies have looked at it and upped the posture. It is a bit early to say what is going to happen, but we have to be more careful,\" he added. When Thailand decriminalised cannabis a few years ago, he said some people on \"the more liberal side\" asked when Singapore was going to change. The Singapore government does not decide on such matters based on what other countries do, he added. \"We take a hard look, we look at the science, we look at the social impact, and the actual impact and we run the government of Singapore and the policies in the best interests of Singaporeans,” he stressed. \"I am absolutely convinced, the Cabinet is absolutely convinced that the right policy is to be strict on drugs, and you can see, the people who asked for liberalisation, are shutting their eyes deliberately to what is happening around the world and the immense harm,\" the minister said. He noted an incident at a Moscow airport where a man, who was reportedly drug-traced, picked up an 18-month-old child and flung the child onto the ground. The child is in a critical condition. For countries that have decriminalised cannabis, including Thailand previously, there are \"young children who are high (on drugs)\", he said. \"Why would we want it? And 85 per cent of our population supports the tough stand that we take -- keep it criminal, no decriminalisation, in fact they support the penalties too,\" he added. The Singapore government cannot be \"zig-zagging\" on its laws, he added. \"Different countries have their own policies. We work in the best interests of Singaporeans, and it was the right policy to keep it criminalised, not soften our stance, and that remains the right policy,\" the Channel News Asia quoted Shanmugam as saying. A 46-year-old Malaysian woman was arrested on the morning of June 23 for allegedly attempting to smuggle drugs worth more than SGD 142,000 into Singapore. The Immigration and Checkpoints Authority (ICA) and Central Narcotics Bureau (CNB) said in a joint statement on June 25 that about 1,057g of cannabis and 973g of methamphetamine, more commonly known as Ice, were found in a Malaysian-registered motorcycle arriving at Woodlands Checkpoint, which is a causeway link with Peninsular Malaysia and the city state. Singapore has a tough law on drug trafficking and a maximum penalty of mandatory death sentence.

Seen here in 1964\nTeased by classmates, they'd swipe his Yankees cap until he finally went after them with fisticuffs, always getting his hat back. \nSilencing the self-abuse was harder when he barely grew an inch while his classmates stretched upwards.\nOn a spring afternoon in 1952 when school buses were late and a teacher ushered all the students into the auditorium to hear fourth-grader Art sing, something was awakened inside Simon.\nWhen Garfunkel sang Nat King Cole's hit, They Try to Tell Us We're Too Young, Simon knew he, too, wanted to perform – outside of his bedroom behind closed doors, in search of the same applause and cheers.\nSo Simon sought out the company of Garfunkel, and they became pals talking about songs they heard on the radio.\nGarfunkel tracked the weekly Hit Parade with his mathematical graphs while Simon listened to Latin dance band music.\nEventually Simon and Garfunkel broke out of Queens with their music and became American sensations. \nPaul and Art were inspired by the music of the Everly Brothers and in the early days, called themselves the Urban Everly Brothers. \n\nView gallery\n\nHowever, we are hopeful after this minor surgical procedure which has been scheduled in the next few days, Paul will be able to complete the tour as well as look into returning to make up these dates,' the statement continued. Seen here in 1967\nAs they became more and more successful they seemed to argue more over artistic discrepancies that began to splinter their bond.\nIn the end, Simon and Garfunkel's increasing troubled relationship, as friends and working colleagues, led to their breakup in 1970.\nPaul, who composed nearly all of their original songs, enjoyed a successful career following their split.\nWhile they never got back together to record a new album, the duo did reunite for the first time to play a free concert in New York's Central Park in September 1981, attracting some 500,000 people, that at the time was the largest concert ever.\nWarner Bros. Records released a live album of the show, The Concert In Central Park, which went on to go double platinum in the US.\n\nShare or comment on this article: \nPaul Simon, 83, cancels concerts due to 'unmanageable' chronic condition\n\nAdd comment\n\nComments (0)\n\nComments are subject to our House rules and Terms\n\nLog in to comment\n\nWorst rated\n\nNo one seems to have shared their thoughts on this topic yet\nLeave a comment so your voice will be heard first.\nTerms | Privacy | Feedback\n\nEnter search term:\n\nJeff Bezos and Lauren Sanchez are 72 hours into their wedding celebrations, but the party keeps on going for the £177billion man and his new bride \n\nNeil Young performs his headline set at Glastonbury to a 'sparse' crowd after making major U-turn and allowing performance to be broadcast on BBC\n\nCharli XCX puts on a VERY racy display in tiny black hot pants and mesh top as she performs to HUGE crowd at Glastonbury\n\nX Factor star 'splits from husband of eight years' after meeting on the show as she makes her Glastonbury Festival debut\n\nJeff Bezos' three-word response after new bride Lauren Sanchez is cornered by mob of Italian journalists: Live updates\n\nCould millennials turn to tech to help save for retirement?\n\nTommy Fury shares hug with Molly-Mae Hague lookalike during wild night out as he parties until the early hours\n\nAs Meghan's new rosé hits the shelves next week, we reveal the secrets of the Californian winery where it was made... which also produces bespoke tipples for celebrities\n\nBradley Cooper and girlfriend Gigi Hadid look happier than ever as they're greeted by fans after romantic date night in Paris\n\nThe inspirational football club helping everyone enjoy the beautiful game -

They were struck while sleeping, relatives said.\n\n“What did these children do to them? What is their fault?” said the children’s grandmother, Suad Abu Teima, as others knelt to kiss their bloodied faces and wept. Some placed red flowers into the body bags.\n\nAlso among the dead were 12 people near the Palestine Stadium in Gaza City, which was sheltering displaced people, and eight more in apartments, according to staff at Shifa Hospital. More than 20 bodies were taken to Nasser Hospital, according to health officials.\n\nA midday strike killed 11 people on a street in eastern Gaza City, and their bodies were taken to Al-Ahli Hospital. Another strike on a gathering in eastern Gaza City killed eight including five children, the hospital said. A strike on a gathering at the entrance to the Bureij refugee camp in central Gaza killed two, according to Al-Awda Hospital.\n\nHopes for a ceasefire agreement in the coming week\n\nU.S. President Donald Trump says there could be a ceasefire agreement within the next week. Taking questions from reporters on Friday, he said, “We’re working on Gaza and trying to get it taken care of.”\n\nAn official with knowledge of the situation told The Associated Press that Israeli Minister for Strategic Affairs Ron Dermer will arrive in Washington next week for talks on a Gaza ceasefire, Iran and other subjects. The official spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak to the media.\n\nIndirect talks between Israel and Hamas have been on again, off again since Israel broke the latest ceasefire in March, continuing its military campaign in Gaza and furthering the territory’s dire humanitarian crisis. Some 50 hostages remain in Gaza, fewer than half believed to still be alive. They were among 251 hostages taken when Hamas attacked Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, sparking the war.\n\n“What more is left to do in Gaza that has not already been done? Who else is left to eliminate?” Yotam Cohen, brother of hostage Nimrod Cohen, said Saturday evening as weekly rallies by families and supporters resumed following Israel’s ceasefire with Iran.\n\nOver 6,000 killed since latest ceasefire ended\n\nThe war has killed over 56,000 Palestinians, according to the Health Ministry, which does not distinguish between civilians and combatants. It says more than half of the dead were women and children. It said the dead include 6,089 killed since the end of the latest ceasefire.\n\nIsrael says it only targets militants and blames civilian deaths on Hamas, accusing the militants of hiding among civilians because they operate in populated areas.\n\nThere is hope among families of hostages that Trump’s involvement in securing the recent ceasefire between Israel and Iran might lead to more pressure for a deal in Gaza. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is riding a wave of public support for the Iran war and its achievements, and he could feel he has more space to move toward ending the war in Gaza, something his far-right governing partners oppose.\n\nHamas has repeatedly said it is prepared to free all the hostages in exchange for an end to the war in Gaza. Netanyahu says he will end the war only once Hamas is disarmed and exiled, something the group has rejected.\n\nHundreds have been killed while seeking food\n\nMeanwhile, hungry Palestinians are enduring a catastrophic situation in Gaza. After blocking all food for 2 1/2 months, Israel has allowed only a trickle of supplies into the territory since mid-May.\n\nMore than 500 Palestinians have been killed and hundreds more wounded while seeking food since the newly formed Gaza Humanitarian Foundation began distributing aid in the territory about a month ago, according to Gaza’s Health Ministry.\n\nPalestinian witnesses say Israeli troops have opened fire at crowds on roads heading toward the sites. The Israeli military says it has only fired warning shots and that it was investigating incidents in which civilians had been harmed while approaching the sites.\n\nThousands of Palestinians walk for hours to reach the sites, moving through Israeli military zones.\n\nSeparate efforts by the United Nations to distribute limited food have been plagued by armed gangs looting trucks and by crowds of desperate people offloading supplies from convoys.\n\nSaturday’s death toll included two people killed by Israeli gunfire while waiting to receive aid near the Netzarim corridor, a road that separates northern and southern Gaza, according to Al-Shifa and Al-Awda hospitals, which each received one body.\n\nThere was no immediate Israeli military comment.\n\nCopyright 2025 The Associated Press.

The protest by tens of thousands of demonstrators was held after nearly eight months of persistent dissent led by Serbia's university students that have rattled Vucic's firm grip on power in the Balkan country. Also Read | Donald Trump Warns of Fresh Strikes on Iran, Slams Ayatollah Khamenei Over 'Victory' Claims in Recent War With Israel. The huge crowd chanted: “We want elections!” as they filled the capital's central Slavija Square and several blocks around it, with many unable to reach the venue. Also Read | US Senate Reduces Remittance Tax to 1% From 3.5% in Relief for NRIs. Dozens of detained protesters handcuffed Police handcuffed detained protesters, and an officer was seen injured on the ground during street battles in central Belgrade that lasted several hours. Six police officers and an unknown number of citizens were injured, police said. “Serbia always wins in the end,” President Vucic said in an Instagram post. Vucic, a former extreme nationalist, has become increasingly authoritarian since coming to power more than a decade ago. Though he formally says he wants Serbia to join the European Union, critics say Vucic has stifled democratic freedoms as he strengthened ties with Russia and China. As the protest formally ended, the demonstrators threw eggs, plastic bottles and other objects at riot police who were preventing the crowd from approaching a downtown park. At the park, hundreds of Vucic's loyalists have been camping for months to form a human shield in front of his headquarters in the capital. Serbia's Interior Minister Ivica Dacic said participants in the protest attacked the police. He said police used their powers to restore public order and “arrest all those who attacked the police\". Police later said dozens of “hooligans” were detained but did not provide the exact number. Some demonstrators wore scarfs and masks over their faces as they clashed with law enforcement, using garbage cans as protection against baton wielding police. Police used pepper spray before pushing protesters with their shields. Tensions were high before and during the gathering as riot police deployed around government buildings. “Elections are a clear way out of the social crisis caused by the deeds of the government, which is undoubtedly against the interests of their own people,” said a student who didn't give her name while addressing the crowd from a stage. “Today, on June 28, 2025, we declare the current authorities illegitimate.” University students playing a key role At the end of the official part of the rally, students told the crowd to “take freedom into your own hands.” University students have been a key force behind nationwide anti-corruption demonstrations that started after a renovated rail station canopy collapsed, killing 16 people on November 1. Many blamed the concrete roof crash on rampant government corruption and negligence in state infrastructure projects, leading to recurring mass protests. “We are here today because we cannot take it any more,” student Darko Kovacevic said. “This has been going on for too long. We are mired in corruption.\" Vucic and his right-wing Serbian Progressive Party have repeatedly refused the demand for an early vote and accused protesters of planning to spur violence on orders from abroad, which they didn't specify or provide evidence of. Vucic's authorities have launched a crackdown on Serbia's striking universities and other opponents, while increasing pressure on independent media as they tried to curb the demonstrations. While numbers have shrunk in recent weeks, the massive showing for Saturday's anti-Vucic rally suggested that the resolve persists, despite relentless pressure and after nearly eight months of almost daily protests. Serbian police, who are firmly controlled by Vucic's government, said 36,000 people were present at the start of the protest Saturday. An independent monitoring group that records public gatherings said around 140,000 people attended the student-led rally. Saturday marked St. Vitus Day, a religious holiday and the date when Serbs mark a 14th-century battle against Ottoman Turks in Kosovo that was the start of hundreds of years of Turkish rule, holding symbolic importance. In their speeches, some of the speakers at the student rally Saturday evoked the theme, which was also used to fuel Serbian nationalism in the 1990s that later led to the incitement of ethnic wars following the breakup of the former Yugoslavia. Vucic supporters bused in to Belgrade Hours before the student-led rally, Vucic's party bused in scores of its own supporters to Belgrade from other parts of the country, many wearing T-shirts reading: “We won't give up Serbia.” They were joining a camp of Vucic's loyalists in central Belgrade where they have been staying in tents since mid-March. In a show of business as usual, Vucic handed out presidential awards in the capital to people he deemed worthy, including artists and journalists. “People need not worry — the state will be defended and thugs brought to justice,\" he told reporters Saturday. Serbian presidential and parliamentary elections are due in 2027.

The report’s lead reporter was Natasha Bertrand. In 2020, Bertrand played a lead role in attempting to discredit reports of Hunter Biden’s laptop. One cannot understand the new report without understanding that.\n\nAt Politico in 2020, Bertrand broke the news that “(m)ore than 50 former intelligence officials signed a letter casting doubt on the provenance of a New York Post story on the former vice president’s son.” It turned out, of course, that Hunter Biden’s laptop actually belonged to him, and there was no Russian disinformation, as Democrats claimed, which was helpfully amplified by Bertrand.\n\nNow, in 2025, Bertrand rushed out this salacious report. Notably, the leak came after congressional committees on intelligence were briefed. Bertrand and then the New York Times, which subsequently reported the same news, failed to note that the American intelligence was considered low confidence. After all, Americans had not been on site at the bombing locations.\n\nMeanwhile, in Israel, intelligence officials built their own review of the bombings. Israel has much better intelligence inside Iran. At one point, the head of the Iranian secret police division in charge of rooting out Israeli spies was actually an Israeli spy. Israeli intelligence has concluded that Iran’s military leadership is telling Iran’s political leadership the bombings only set them back a few months. But Iran’s military actually believes they have been set back years.\n\nReconciling the two reports, it seems likely the American intelligence community intercepted what Iran’s military told Iran’s politicians, but Israel knows what Iran’s military leadership really thinks and probably has spies on the ground too. Israel believes Iran’s uranium is buried beyond reach. Israel does not know that Fordow has completely collapsed underground, but does believe it is inaccessible. Israel also believes key parts of Iran’s equipment to process uranium have been destroyed. Israel has also eliminated the top scientists involved in Iran’s nuclear program.\n\nWe have entered a bizarro realm where those who did not want to bomb Iran insisted that intelligence reports that stated Iran was close to a weapon could not be believed, and they now insist the after-action initial intelligence reports show the bombing was unsuccessful. But they also do not want to bomb more.\n\nUnfortunately, the American press corps has totally discredited itself. It is not just that President Donald Trump pushed back against the initial intelligence assessment. The Israelis and much of the American intelligence community did too, so much so that within 24 hours of CNN breaking the story, the American press corps was treating it far more skeptically. Putting the Hunter Biden laptop reporter in charge of this story only further casts doubt on the story. Adding in the assessment of the Israelis, who actually have an existential reason to get their intelligence right, further casts doubt on the veracity and accuracy of the American press.\n\nWhen former President Joe Biden was in office, American reporters often treated reports about him skeptically. When someone from Congress or the intelligence community, which itself has a history of trying to undermine Trump, leaks something negative about Trump, the media pounces, seizes it, and does all the other adverbs and adjectives usually used in headlines to attack Republicans.\n\nThis was a brilliantly staged and executed operation by the Pentagon that the press attempted to discredit to attack Trump. We have been starved of competence for some time in government. But the Pentagon successfully got B2 bombers in the air while distracting everyone with additional B2 bombers, then dropped 14 bunker buster bombs—the first time they have ever been used—just two days after the president threw everyone off with his two-week timeline to assess the situation. Democrats, bureaucrats in the intelligence community and the press corps seemingly could not tolerate Trump getting any political benefit from a successful bombing run.\n\nIn the end, the press further hurt its credibility by trying to undermine Trump. Even Wile E. Coyote would be impressed by the own goal.\n\nCOPYRIGHT 2025 CREATORS.COM\n\nWe publish a variety of perspectives.

More than 56,400 Palestinians have been killed in Israeli attacks in the sealed-off territory, according to figures from the Hamas-run health ministry.\n\nAccording to the Israeli military, al-Issa was one of the last remaining high-ranking Hamas commanders in Gaza.\n\nHe most recently served as chief of staff for the group’s “combat and administrative support division”.\n\nMeanwhile, Israeli strikes killed at least 72 people across Gaza overnight into Saturday local time, health workers said, as ceasefire prospects were said to be improving after 21 months of war.\n\nThree children and their parents were killed in an Israeli strike on a tent camp in Muwasi near the southern city of Khan Younis. They were struck while sleeping, relatives said.\n\n“What did these children do to them? What is their fault?” said the children’s grandmother, Suad Abu Teima, as others knelt to kiss their bloodied faces and wept. Some placed red flowers into the body bags.\n\nAlso among the dead were 12 people near the Palestine Stadium in Gaza City, which was sheltering displaced people, and eight more in apartments, according to staff at Shifa Hospital. More than 20 bodies were taken to Nasser Hospital, according to health officials.\n\nA midday strike killed 11 people on a street in eastern Gaza City, and their bodies were taken to Al-Ahli Hospital.\n\nUS President Donald Trump says there could be a ceasefire agreement within the next week. Taking questions from reporters, he said, “We’re working on Gaza and trying to get it taken care of.”\n\nAn official with knowledge of the situation told The Associated Press that Israeli Minister for Strategic Affairs Ron Dermer will arrive in Washington next week for talks on a Gaza ceasefire, Iran and other subjects.\n\nIndirect talks between Israel and Hamas have been on again, off again since Israel broke the latest ceasefire in March, continuing its military campaign in Gaza and furthering the territory’s dire humanitarian crisis.\n\nSome 50 hostages remain in Gaza, fewer than half believed to still be alive. They were among 251 hostages taken when Hamas attacked Israel on October 7, 2023, killing more than 1200 people, according to Israeli authorities.\n\nMeanwhile, hungry Palestinians are enduring a catastrophic situation in Gaza. After blocking all food for two-and-a-half months, Israel has allowed only a trickle of supplies into the territory since mid-May.\n\nMore than 500 Palestinians have been killed and hundreds more wounded while seeking food since the newly formed Gaza Humanitarian Foundation began distributing aid in the territory about a month ago, according to Gaza’s Health Ministry.\n\nPalestinian witnesses say Israeli troops have opened fire at crowds on roads heading toward the sites.

It would result in tens of billions of dollars in lost funding for North Carolina, including our hospitals and rural communities. This will force the state to make painful decisions like eliminating Medicaid coverage for hundreds of thousands in the expansion population, and even reducing critical services for those in the traditional Medicaid population.”\n\nTillis urged Senate leaders to return to the House’s Medicaid reforms, which include work requirements for some able-bodied adults and anti-fraud measures. He praised the rest of the bill, including the extension of the Trump Tax Cuts, expansion of the child tax credit, historic border security investments, and efforts to end wasteful spending. “We can and must accomplish this without hurting our rural communities and hospitals,” he said.\n\nTillis has played a central role in shaping the legislation up to this point. One provision he inserted has sparked fierce backlash from conservatives and consumer advocates. That provision would impose a new tax on profits earned by third-party entities that finance civil litigation. Consumers’ Research launched a campaign targeting Tillis, accusing him of doing the bidding of the Chamber of Commerce and major corporations. The group warned that the measure would make it harder for everyday Americans to fight back against powerful companies. Executive Director Will Hild contended that the provision is “needlessly broad” and undermines “one of the few tools the average American consumer has to fight back against corporate political activists.” A mobile billboard condemning Tillis circled the Capitol on Thursday as pressure builds on Senate leaders to strike the language before a vote.\n\nDemocrats have seized on the Medicaid debate to amplify talking points from left-wing groups and industry-paid advocates. Their claims that the bill would lead to mass rural hospital closures rely on questionable studies and deeply partisan sources. One often-cited report comes from the University of North Carolina’s Sheps Center, whose leadership promotes radical gender ideologies and has a long track record of support for Democrat priorities. Other studies funded by Manatt Health Strategies include projections about cuts to coverage for illegal aliens and able-bodied adults who refuse to work. Critics note that only 4.9 percent of Medicaid inpatient hospital spending currently goes to rural hospitals. They argue that the bill would actually strengthen Medicaid by focusing resources on the most vulnerable and ending funding for illegal immigrants and fraudulent programs.\n\nTillis’s opposition comes as the Senate parliamentarian struck several major Medicaid provisions from the bill, including the provider tax used to pay for the Trump Tax Cuts. The ruling also removed language that would block Medicaid coverage for transgender procedures and benefits for illegal aliens. These decisions complicate how Republicans plan to offset the cost of the bill and limit what can be included under reconciliation rules. Senate Majority Leader John Thune told Breitbart News Saturday that Republicans expected many of the challenges and have prepared backup plans. He emphasized the goal remains to pass a final version that reflects the House’s priorities while advancing Trump’s agenda.","summary":"Senator Thom Tillis (R-NC) says he will vote against moving forward with President Donald Trump’s One Big Beautiful Bill, warning that the legislation in its current form would gut Medicaid funding for his state.\n\n\nThe post Thom Tillis Turns on Trump Bill Over Medicaid Cuts: ‘I Cannot Support It’ appeared first on Breitbart.","url":"https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2025/06/28/thom-tillis-turns-on-trump-bill-over-medicaid-cuts-i-cannot-support-it/","image":"https://media.breitbart.com/media/2025/06/Thom-Tillis-640x335.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-06-28 23:32:37","author":"Jasmyn Jordan,Manatt Health Strategies","authors":["Jasmyn Jordan","Manatt Health Strategies"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.022},{"id":336268188,"title":"Protests in Venice Cast a Shadow Over Bezos’ Extravagant Wedding Ceremony","text":"Mass tourism, exorbitantly high rents, worker exploitation, inequality, and elitism: Recent protests in Venice, sparked by Jeff Bezos and Lauren Sanchez’s prominent wedding, have highlighted increasing global discontent.\n\nLocal officials downplayed the protesters as a minor fringe group. However, Bezos’s celebrity status and Venice’s breathtaking scenery have provided the protesters with international exposure, which they utilized strategically.\n\n“No Space for Bezos” signs hung over the famous Rialto Bridge, and a large banner on St Mark’s Square calling on the tech giant to contribute more in taxes, have captured global attention.\n\nFears of potential disruptions prompted Bezos and his bride to relocate their grandest celebrity celebration from the center to a more secluded spot in the eastern section of the lagoon city.\n\nA thousand activists from social centers and environmental groups took part in the protest against the city’s exploitation, marching through the streets. Source: SIPA USA / Roberto Brancolini\n\nIn the final protest on Saturday (local time), around 1,000 residents and activists rallied in front of Venice’s train station under a scorching sun, before marching roughly 1.5 kilometres to the Rialto Bridge.\n\n“Bezos, out of the lagoon”, the demonstrators chanted as they wound through the city centre, some brandishing signs that read: “Eat the rich”, “Rejected”, and accusations that Venice’s mayor is “corrupt”.\n\nOne banner proclaimed “Kisses yes, Bezos no”, playing on Venice’s reputation as the city of love, and another one said “No space for Bezos” with a rocket, in a reference to his Blue Origin space technology company.\n\nProtesters demand affordable housing, oppose overtourism\n\nAlice Bazzoli, a 24-year-old university student, called Bezos a “hypocrite” for donating 3 million euros ($5.38 million) to Venice while flooding its fragile ecosystem with high-polluting private jets and yachts.\n\nBezos and Sanchez have given 1 million euros ($1.79 million) each to three Venetian institutions: CORILA, an academic consortium that studies the lagoon, UNESCO’s local office, and Venice International University.\n\nThe ‘Moa’ boat transporting Jeff Bezos and Lauren Sanchez Bezos is escorted on the Grand Canal, on the third day of their wedding festivities.

The consequence is a lack of diversity and social liveliness,” he said.\n\nVenice is rapidly depopulating, largely because of the cost of living crisis.

Reuters news agency reported in February that Italian prosecutors were investigating alleged tax evasion worth 1.2 billion ($2.15 billion) euros.\n\n“I would have protested against Bezos even if he had come on a rowboat with just a handful of people … because he contributed practically, materially and politically to Donald Trump’s re-election,” protest leader Cacciari said.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nMass tourism, exorbitantly high rents, worker exploitation, inequality, and elitism: Recent protests&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Protests in Venice Cast a Shadow Over Bezos&#8217; Extravagant Wedding Ceremony first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/news/au/protests-in-venice-cast-a-shadow-over-bezos-extravagant-wedding-ceremony/","image":"https://images.sbs.com.au/f6/1a/3091504249a3bb070ae954a87a63/jeff-bezos-lauren-sanchez-venice-wedding-3.jpg?imwidth=1280","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-06-28 23:32:20","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.208},{"id":336267530,"title":"Delaying the Inevitable: Spiteful Schumer to Force Floor Reading of Big, Beautiful Bill","text":"Democrats cannot stop President Donald Trump’s Big, Beautiful Bill, but the party whose North Star is opposition to Trump is doing whatever it can to delay his victory.\n\nSenate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) told his caucus he will force the Senate clerk to read the mammoth piece of legislation in its entirety, The Hill reported Saturday. The delay tactic could force the Senate to waste over half a day’s time before moving forward with the bill.\n\nThe reading is expected to begin early Saturday evening after a vote on a motion to proceed to the legislation, delaying a mandatory twelve hours of debate before moving to amendment votes and final passage.\n\nThe Senate, which operates on a volatile mixture of consensus and exhaustion, almost always waives the reading of legislation by unanimous consent – the process that also enables modern Senate leaders to schedule votes and debate and speed through many parliamentary requirements.\n\nSchumer’s stunt will force the Senate to languish as a staff member laboriously reads complicated text referencing statutes and codes unintelligible to even the most skilled attorneys.\n\nAfter weeks of often tense discussions culminating in what seemed like an end-of-week impasse, Republicans unveiled a big, beautiful bill text after midnight Saturday morning, signaling the intent to progress nquickly to move the bill.\n\nIn a world of immediacy, the Senate’s glacial pace appears futile and anachronistic from the outside. But when things come together, they tend to do so quickly.\n\nDespite a handful of potential holdouts, most notably Sen. Thom Tillis (R-NC), Republicans are anxious to get moving and send a product to the House and then to Trump’s desk.\n\nSchumer’s latest gambit delays that plan, and – as may be his true intention – imperils Trump’s July 4 deadline for signing the legislation.\n\nYet that deadline was manufactured by Trump and Senate leaders largely to force often overly-deliberate Senators into action. And whenever Trump’s signature legislation passes – even if later in July, Trump and his supporters will certainly celebrate.\n\nSchumer might be trying to look tough after a disastrous about-face in March, when he backed a Republican-supported government funding bill after previously pledging his opposition. Amid the backlash from his own party, Schumer delayed the start of his book tour.\n\nA poll conducted almost two months later showed Schumer’s approval rating underwater by a whopping 25 percent.\n\nBradley Jaye is Deputy Political Editor for Breitbart News.

It gives subsidies to outdated industries while severely harming future industries.”\n\nThe billionaire and former adviser to Trump highlighted a poll indicating the “big, beautiful bill” is politically unpopular due to its financial impact, a view confirmed by several separate polls this month. An NBC News Decision Desk poll found 40% of Republican respondents said “reducing the national debt” is the top priority as Congress reviews the Trump-backed mega bill. Overall, most respondents prioritized keeping current spending levels for programs like Medicaid.\n\n“Polls show that this bill is political suicide for the Republican Party,” Musk wrote on X.\n\nMusk has long been a critic of Trump’s “big, beautiful bill,” balking at its expected impact on the national deficit and arguing that it would offset government savings brought in by the Department of Government Efficiency, an organization Trump appointed him to lead earlier this year. He maintained that opinion Saturday, expressing it through several posts on his platform, X — including one post that attacked the bill’s expected effect on the deficit “as “putting America in the fast lane to debt slavery!”\n\nTrump previously argued that Musk only opposed the legislation because of provisions aimed at stripping away electric vehicle tax credits. Musk today called a provision in the bill that he framed as targeting clean energy production “incredibly destructive to America.”\n\nThe Tesla chief’s departure from the White House, where he formally served as a special government employee, came a day after he publicly expressed his criticisms of the bill during an interview with “CBS Sunday Morning.”\n\n“I think a bill can be big or it can be beautiful, I don’t know if it can be both,” Musk said at the time. \n\nWhile Musk no longer commands similar levels of influence in Washington, his past opposition to the bill emboldened Republicans lawmakers, some of whom, like Musk, took issue with its expected $4 trillion increase to the national deficit.\n\nThe renewed criticism by Musk comes as Senate Republicans rush to whip enough votes to pass the 940-page megabill amid breaks in the party over certain provisions, including expected cuts to Medicaid that could strip funding from rural hospitals. Sen. Thom Tillis, R-N.C, cited the loss of rural hospital funding in explaining his decision to oppose the bill.\n\nEarlier this month, shortly after the House of Representatives passed its version of the bill, Musk urged his more than 200 million followers on X to tell Congress to “kill the bill.”","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nOn Saturday, Elon Musk launched a series of criticisms against a massive&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: &#8220;Elon Musk Renews Harsh Critique of Trump&#8217;s &#8216;Big, Beautiful Bill&#039;&#8221; first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/local-news/elon-musk-renews-harsh-critique-of-trumps-big-beautiful-bill/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/039Insane-and-destructive039-Elon-Musk-resumes-attacks-on-Trump039s-039Big.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-06-28 23:16:15","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.043},{"id":336264334,"title":"Revealed: Kris Jenner and boyfriend Corey Gamble's tense exchange at Jeff Bezos and Lauren Sanchez's wedding","text":"SHARE SELECTION\n\nBlack Friday\n\nKim Kardashian\n\nVictoria Beckham\n\nHarry Styles\n\nAmanda Holden\n\nBritain's Got Talent\n\nPrivacy Policy\n\nSaturday, Jun 28th 2025\n\n5-Day Forecast\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPolice launch probe after punk duo Bob Vylan lead Glastonbury crowd in chants of 'Death to the IDF!' and 'Free Palestine!' as government condemns scenes aired live on the BBC\n\n'I will never forget the screams': Brits in Essex park 'heaving with families' reveal moment seven-year-old girl was killed and four other children were injured as tree branch came crashing down on top of them\n\nRevealed: The sneaky tactics used by pushy bar and restaurant staff on Greek holiday island to rip off Brit holidaymakers\n\nThe hidden symptoms that reveal whether YOU are one of the millions of adults with undiagnosed dyslexia - and the next steps you must take\n\nPETER HITCHENS: Donald Trump's attack on Iran was lawless and we'll all regret it soon enough.

The annual festival returned for its 44th year, bringing together local musicians, Black-owned businesses and community organizations for an event celebrating Black culture and community.\n\n“Juneteenth is a celebration for African American heritage,” Nadine Grundy, a business vendor at the festival, said, adding that it’s important for people to come out, celebrate “and enjoy their roots and history.”\n\nGrundy owns Creations of Color, which sells items such as stationery, home decor and drinkware decorated with vibrant illustrations of Black women. She said her products reflect her heritage. “I think it’s important that I’m able to come here and share the things that I do,” she said.\n\nDozens of local Black-owned businesses were at the festival, selling products like artisanal skincare, paintings and handmade jewelry. Muhammed Shuaibe, owner of clothing brand Melanin Gang, which he founded with his wife, aims to create clothing that uplifts people and their communities.\n\n“We do have a nonprofit organization where we feed the homeless and we give out free stuff,” he said about his nonprofit, Give Back Gang, which provides meals during Ramadan and hosts workshops around mental health and wellness in Oakland. He said being able to give back reminds people of what they are capable of.\n\nA few hours into the festival, a crowd from the nearby No Kings Day protest against President Donald Trump’s policies and actions marched past. While the atmosphere of the festival stayed calm and celebratory, many attendees said the protests resonated with them.\n\n“Both of these happening at the same time is very reflective of America,” said Camile Creese, a festival participant and student at San Jose State University. “We’re celebrating African American culture while also trying to maintain the inclusiveness that comes with being American, and the freedom that comes with our culture.”\n\nJuneteenth’s legacy of freedom and fighting for African American rights was at the center of one speaker’s talk.\n\n“We are engaged in a great constitutional crisis where, if the unconstitutional voter rights act is followed, we will have lost most of what we gained less than 50 years ago,” said Marjorie Craig, chair of the San Jose NAACP, referring to the Safeguard American Voter Eligibility, or SAVE, Act that is before Congress. The bill, which would require voters to present a birth certificate or passport to register to vote, could impose additional barriers to voters who don’t have access to documentation.\n\n“We stand here, comfortable, being able to eat and drink what we want to drink, being able to communicate, to express our thoughts, but if we don’t feel the same urgency that was felt then, we may lose all of that,” Craig said. The NAACP civil rights organization was founded in 1909.\n\nWhat resonated most significantly for many attendees was the profound feeling of community at the festival. San Jose has a Black population of 3%, far smaller than the national proportion of 12% and of nearby cities such as Oakland and San Francisco.\n\n“Being able to spend time with people who look like me, that’s important,” said attendee Davion Thomas, a San Jose native, adding that there weren’t many other African Americans in his high school. “It’s amazing to see us, especially, come together.”\n\nCreese, the college student, agreed. “It’s very nice to see a physical proof of community. There’s a sense of camaraderie. I feel like these are the types of things that young people in general need — to really feel connected with everybody and to feel more secure during times like this.”\n\nJuneteenth is celebrated annually on June 19 to commemorate the end of slavery. It marks the day in 1865 when slaves in Galveston, Texas, learned that President Abraham Lincoln had freed them. Although San Jose’s Juneteenth in the Streets has been celebrated for more than four decades, Juneteenth became a federal holiday only in 2021.\n\nPadma Balaji is a member of the class of 2026 at Mission San Jose High School in Fremont.","summary":"Speakers, musicians, and vendors celebrate Black heritage and history at downtown San Jose festival.","url":"https://www.mercurynews.com/2025/06/28/black-community-pride-fills-san-jose-juneteenth-festival/","image":"https://www.mercurynews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/SJM-L-JUNETEENTH-MOS-01.jpg?w=1024&h=683","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-06-28 23:12:14","author":"Padma Balaji","authors":["Padma Balaji"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.513},{"id":336262632,"title":"Pete Hegseth reveals name of Navy oil tanker after snubbing gay icon Harvey Milk","text":"Pete Hegseth announced that the USNS Harvey Milk will be renamed after a World War II sailor, stripping the ship of the name of a slain gay rights activist who served during the Korean War.\n\nThe defense secretary said he was 'taking the politics out of ship naming' in a video posted to social media.\n\nThe ship's new name will honor Navy Chief Petty Officer Oscar V. Peterson, who was awarded the Medal of Honor posthumously for his actions during the 1942 Battle of the Coral Sea in the Pacific. \n\nThe decision is the latest move by Hegseth to wipe away names of ships and military bases that were given by President Joe Biden's Democratic administration, which in many cases chose to honor service members who were women, minorities, from the LBGTQ community and more.\n\nIt follows earlier actions by Hegseth and President Donald Trump, a Republican, to purge all programs, policies, books and social media mentions of references to diversity, equity and inclusion in the military and elsewhere. \n\nHegseth's announcement comes during Pride Month - the same timing as the Pentagon's campaign to force transgender troops out of the US military.\n\n'People want to be proud of the ship they're sailing in,' Hegseth said of the change.\n\n'We're not renaming the ship to anything political. This is not about political activists, unlike the previous administration,' insisted Hegseth, who earlier this month ordered Navy Secretary John Phelan to put together a small team to rename the USNS Harvey Milk replenishment oiler.\n\nHe said Peterson's 'spirit of self-sacrifice and concern for his crewmates was in keeping with the finest traditions of the Navy.'\n\nA Defense official said the renaming was an attempt by MAGA to 'reestablish warrior culture' and the timing of the announcement - during Pride Month - was intentional. \n\nLiberal critics, however, called the move a weak attempt to replace US history with empty machismo. \n\nWhen Hegseth announced the decision to rename the ship, officials defended it as an effort to align with Trump and Hegseth's objectives to 're-establish the warrior culture.'\n\nDemocratic congressman Jim Himes said the renaming displayed a deep insecurity among those in President Trump's administration.\n\n'At the core of MAGA is a deep insecurity about one's own manhood and sexuality,' Himes said on X. 'That's why all the muscle displays, military cosplaying and school yard bullying.'\n\nAnother critic called it 'another attempt to erase the LGBTQ+ community by a small minded self-serving administration.' \n\nPeterson, who spent 20 years in the Navy, served on the USS Neosho and was in charge of running the steam engine when it came under Japanese fire in the Philippines in 1942. \n\nThe ship was damaged during the Battle of the Coral Sea, and even though Peterson was injured, he managed to close the bulkhead stop valves to keep the ship operational. He suffered third-degree burns and later died from his wounds.\n\nThe Navy in 1943 named an escort ship after Peterson. The USS Peterson served for more than two decades and was decommissioned in June 1965.\n\nThe USNS Harvey Milk was named in 2016 by then-Navy Secretary Ray Mabus under President Barack Obama, who said at the time that the John Lewis-class of oilers would be named after leaders who fought for civil and human rights.\n\nHarvey Milk, who was portrayed by Sean Penn, 64, in an Oscar-winning 2008 movie, served for four years in the Navy before he was forced out for being gay. \n\nHe was ordered to face a court martial for participating in a 'homosexual act.' \n\nIn January 1954, he resigned and was handed an 'Other Than Honorable' discharge. In 2021, the USNS Harvey Milk was christened in his honor. \n\nMilk later became one of the first openly gay candidates elected to public office, in San Francisco and served on the San Francisco Board of Supervisors after years of activism in the LGBTQ sphere.\n\nHe was assassinated one year into his term in 1978 by disgruntled former San Francisco supervisor Dan White.\n\nHegseth and the broader Trump administration have faced criticism from veterans' groups, high-profile public figures and former DoD Secretary fans, including Newsweek's political editor Carlo Versano, over the controversial renaming effort.\n\n'I've never before seen a Secretary of Defense so aggressively demote himself to the rank of Chief PETTY Officer,' actor Penn, said in a statement to The Hollywood Reporter.\n\nDustin Lance Black, the film's screenwriter, also criticized the move as politically divisive.\n\n'This is yet another move to distract and to fuel the culture wars that create division,' Black, 50, told The Hollywood Reporter.\n\n'It's meant to get us to react in ways that are self-centered so that we are further distanced from our brothers and sisters in equally important civil rights fights in this country. It's divide and conquer.' \n\nThe progressive veterans' group VoteVets also condemned the move.\n\n'At the start of Pride Month, Pete Hegseth ordered the Navy to strip Harvey Milk's name from a ship,' the group wrote on X.\n\n'A man who served with honor - erased to send a message. This is a deliberate insult to LGBTQ troops and Americans that weakens our force and shreds the values we fight for.'\n\nVersano, who was once a cautious supporter of Hegseth's Pentagon appointment, has since turned sharply critical.\n\nIn a column titled 'Now Boarding the USS Idiocracy,' the Newsweek's political editor wrote, 'I cannot believe I once wrote here that I was cautiously optimistic about Hegseth as someone who could shake up the Pentagon. Was I on drugs?'\n\nHe added, 'This guy is such an embarrassment to be leading our military… this is what the Defense Department is sitting around worrying about right now?'\n\nSeveral public officials have also voiced their outrage.\n\nSenate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer posted on X: 'Erasing Harvey Milk's name is disgusting, blatant discrimination - and during Pride Month to boot. He served the U.S. Navy and his country honorably... Hegseth should be ashamed of himself and reverse this immediately.'\n\nFormer House Speaker Nancy Pelosi added, 'The reported decision... is a shameful, vindictive erasure of those who fought to break down barriers for all to chase the American dream.\n\n'Our military is the most powerful in the world – but this spiteful move does not strengthen our national security or the 'warrior' ethos. Instead, it is a surrender of a fundamental American value: to honor the legacy of those who worked to build a better country.\n\n'As the rest of us are celebrating the joy of Pride Month, it is my hope that the Navy will reconsider this egregious decision,' Pelosi said in a statement. \n\nFormer Pentagon official Alex Wagner, who helped lead the department's first Pride event in 2012, said the decision was 'disappointing, but no surprise.'\n\nWagner noted, 'When I served... we prioritized building and resourcing a ready force capable of deterring, denying, and - if necessary - defeating the People's Liberation Army. \n\nWe sought to harness one of our greatest strategic advantages - the diverse experiences and expertise of all Americans.'\n\nIn defense of the renaming initiative, Pentagon spokesperson Sean Parnell stated, 'Secretary Hegseth is committed to ensuring that the names attached to all DOD installations and assets are reflective of the Commander-in-Chief's priorities, our nation's history, and the warrior ethos.'\n\nAccording to CBS News, an internal Navy memo cited the renaming as an effort to ensure 'alignment with president and SECDEF objectives and SECNAV priorities of reestablishing the warrior culture.' \n\nSeveral others have been placed on a 'recommended list' of name changes, the documents reveal.\n\nThe USNS Ruth Bader Ginsburg, which is currently under construction and named after the iconic late Supreme Court justice, has also been flagged.\n\nThe USNS Thurgood Marshall, named after the Supreme Court's first African-American justice, is on the list, as is the USNS Dolores Huerta, honoring the late labor movement leader.\n\nUSNS Cesar Chavez, named after Huerta's close associate and fellow labor leader, and the USNS Medgar Evers, for the African American civil rights activist, are also on the list.\n\nRounding out the recommendations are USNS Harriet Tubman, USNS Lucy Stone, named in honor of the slave-turned-activist Tubman, and suffragist Stone, who was the first woman in Massachusetts to earn a college degree. \n\nThe documents describing these proposed changes were marked with a 'CAUTION' note suggesting they would be publicly sensitive.\n\nSean Parnell, the chief Pentagon spokesman, told CBS Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth 'is committed to ensuring that the names attached to all DOD installations and assets are reflective of the Commander-in-Chief's priorities, our nation's history, and the warrior ethos.","summary":"The Defense Secretary has announced the renaming of a Navy ship previously honoring a trailblazing gay rights activist, sparking fierce political backlash.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-14857139/Pete-Hegseth-reveals-Navy-oil-tanker-snubbing-gay-icon-Harvey-Milk.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/06/28/23/99823155-0-image-m-17_1751148949021.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-06-28 23:09:39","author":"Editor,James Gordon","authors":["Editor","James Gordon"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.078},{"id":336266280,"title":"World News | Longtime State Department Spokesman, Diplomat Richard Boucher Dies at 73","text":"Washington, Jun 29 (AP) Richard Boucher, who served for more than a decade as the spokesman for the US State Department and assistant secretary of state for public affairs, has died at age 73, according to friends and family.

It gives handouts to industries of the past while severely damaging industries of the future.\" The billionaire and former Trump adviser amplified a poll that suggests the \"big, beautiful bill\" is politically unpopular due to its budgetary effects, a notion that was affirmed this month by several separate surveys. Forty percent of Republican respondents to a recent NBC News Decision Desk poll said \"ensuring the national debt is reduced\" is the most important issue as Congress considers the Trump-backed mega bill. Overall, a majority of respondents said maintaining current spending levels on programs like Medicaid is the most important issue. \"Polls show that this bill is political suicide for the Republican Party,\" Musk wrote on X. Musk has long been a critic of Trump's \"big, beautiful bill,\" balking at its expected impact on the national deficit and arguing that it would offset government savings brought in by the Department of Government Efficiency, an organization Trump appointed him to lead earlier this year. He maintained that opinion Saturday, expressing it through several posts on his platform, X — including one post that attacked the bill's expected effect on the deficit \"as \"putting America in the fast lane to debt slavery!\" Trump previously argued that Musk only opposed the legislation because of provisions aimed at stripping away electric vehicle tax credits. Musk today called a provision in the bill that he framed as targeting clean energy production \"incredibly destructive to America.\" The Tesla chief's departure from the White House, where he formally served as a special government employee, came a day after he publicly expressed his criticisms of the bill during an interview with \"CBS Sunday Morning.\" “I think a bill can be big or it can be beautiful, I don’t know if it can be both,” Musk said at the time. While Musk no longer commands similar levels of influence in Washington, his past opposition to the bill emboldened Republicans lawmakers, some of whom, like Musk, took issue with its expected $4 trillion increase to the national deficit. The renewed criticism by Musk comes as Senate Republicans rush to whip enough votes to pass the 940-page megabill amid breaks in the party over certain provisions, including expected cuts to Medicaid that could strip funding from rural hospitals. Sen. Thom Tillis, R-N.C, cited the loss of rural hospital funding in explaining his decision to oppose the bill.

He marches at local anti-Trump protests and doesn’t hesitate to publicly share his opinions. He’s passionate and determined – and he’s only 18.\n\nThe West Valley College student was one of dozens of local teen protesters who took to the streets of downtown San Jose on June 14 as part of a nationwide “No Kings” demonstration against President Donald Trump’s policies and actions.\n\n“The president is doing some very, very dangerous things,” Goldstein said, holding a poster that read “Facism is festering in the land of the free.”\n\nAccording to the group 50501, which organized the San Jose protest, there were more than 12,000 attendees. Most of the demonstrators were adults, a turnout that several youths who showed up said was concerning.\n\n“We are the younger generation,” said Evelyn Nguyen, 19. “We have to worry about our future. It’s great to see all these people, but I would love to see more younger people.”\n\nThe small teen attendance was a stark departure from recent global trends of youth protest involvement. The proportion of youths who participated in protests rose between the 1990s and 2010s. In 2019, at least 25% of protesters at selected demonstrations were youth, according to the United Nations Children’s Fund.\n\nMelanie Ontiveros, a U.S. history teacher at Sierramont Middle School in San Jose, said young people are “just not as active politically as they need to be.”\n\nOntiveros said threats of violence from Trump may have discouraged parents from letting their teens attend the protests. She referred to a comment Trump made ahead of the U.S. Army’s 250th anniversary parade, which was scheduled on the same day as the “No Kings” protests. He said those protesting at the Army parade would be met with “very big force.”\n\nGoldstein said misinformation surrounding the recent Los Angeles protests against Immigration and Customs Enforcement raids has also contributed to the low teen turnout in San Jose.\n\nStill, the young protesters who rallied and marched in San Jose said the act of showing up was a movement in and of itself.\n\n“It’s one thing to see (youth activism) on TikTok or post it on your story,” Nguyen said. “But to see it in person with everyone else around you, you’re like, ‘I have this community. I know I’m not alone in my views.’ I think that’ll make people feel less afraid to speak their mind.”\n\nOthers believe visibility can increase youth protest involvement.\n\nGoldstein said if young people see others their age at rallies, they get the message that protesting “isn’t just a fringe idea.”\n\n“This is real Americans fighting back against a real threat to freedom and to our country,” he said.\n\nBeyond hoping to lead by example and motivate their peers to advocate, many teens who attended the “No Kings” event were compelled to protest by personal experiences related to Trump’s policies.\n\nGabi Vasquez, 18, came out to demonstrate because she’s afraid of Trump cutting funding and programs to slow climate change. She’s also worried about mass deportations, which she said affects “everyone that we know.”\n\nOne 17-year-old said his father chose not to attend the rally out of fear of being targeted by ICE.\n\n“I’m here to represent people like my dad who don’t have the same privilege as me, to speak up for those who can’t,” the youth said.\n\nOntiveros said teen participation in protests are important. She referred to the poem “First They Came” by Pastor Martin Niemöller, about those who stayed silent during the Nazi regime and drew a parallel to the current youth response to government policies.\n\n“If we don’t stand up now, then when the government comes to take away your specific rights, there’s not going to be anybody there to stand up for you, because everybody who stood up before has already been picked up one by one,” Ontiveros said. “So if young people want to have a truly free future, they need to fight for it now.”\n\nA desire to preserve and maintain that freedom is what many of the young protesters said brought them out to the San Jose demonstration.\n\n“We need to build the world that we want,” Goldstein said. “We have that opportunity because we’re still young.”\n\nNaomi Kotani is a member of the class of 2027 at Aragon High School in San Mateo.","summary":"Local teenagers were among those who took to the streets of downtown San Jose on June 14 as part of a nationwide “No Kings” demonstration against President Donald Trump’s agenda and actions.","url":"https://www.mercurynews.com/2025/06/28/teens-made-a-statement-during-no-kings-protest-in-san-jose/","image":"https://www.mercurynews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/SJM-L-PROTEST-MOS-01.jpg?w=1024&h=683","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-06-28 23:00:13","author":"Naomi Kotani","authors":["Naomi Kotani"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.157},{"id":336265394,"title":"Why Republicans desperately want the media to be their cheerleaders","text":"Explaining the Right is a weekly series that looks at what the right wing is currently obsessing over, how it influences politics—and why you need to know.\n\nFollowing the decision to bomb Iranian nuclear targets without first seeking congressional approval, the Trump administration renewed its ongoing war against the media for reporting factual information.\n\nRepublicans want cheerleading, not journalism\n\nPresident Donald Trump, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt, and other Republicans challenged reporting that revealed that the Pentagon did not believe Iran’s nuclear capability had been decimated.

He fumed that the media responded to President Richard Nixon’s “silent majority” speech about the Vietnam War with “querulous criticism,” and he argued that the press was not effusive enough in its praise of Nixon.\n\nBoth Nixon and Agnew would later separately resign from their positions due to scandal.\n\nThe right works the media refs\n\nThe right has spent decades beating up on the media, with Trump repeatedly calling them the “enemy of the people.” The entire conservative movement has dedicated itself to the falsehood that the “liberal media” is an arm of the Democratic Party designed to take down the right.\n\nOrganizations like the Media Research Center have been funded with millions of dollars to hammer at this false narrative, with reports and other media releases purportedly showing media bias.\n\nTrump complains about “fake news” when unflattering facts are reported about him, but he thinks nothing of lying as easily as he breathes.

workers' rights Bill as Tories warn the rule changes could lead to £1billion in tax rises","text":"Sir Keir Starmer was told to rein in Angela Rayner’s new labour laws last night amid claims they could lead to a £1 billion tax hike.\n\nThe Tories have already warned the rules would clobber business and severely damage the economy. \n\nLast night Shadow Business Secretary Andrew Griffith said that would have the knock-on effect of companies paying less tax – with Labour ministers inevitably hiking tax rates to make up the shortfall.\n\nHe urged the Prime Minister to take advantage of a delay to Ms Rayner’s Employment Rights Bill becoming law to rethink the whole plan.\n\nMr Griffith said: ‘I appeal to Sir Keir to realise that his Deputy’s Prime Minister’s madcap plans will have a terrible effect on businesses already struggling with this year’s National Insurances rises. \n\n'The Government’s own impact assessment says Ms Rayner’s plans will cost businesses about £5 billion a year and cost the economy some 50,000 jobs.\n\n‘These are companies who pay a lot of tax and contribute mightily to funding public services and that shortfall could well lead to this Government imposing £1 billion of new tax rises on the rest of us.’\n\nIn a surprise development last week, it emerged the reforms – including repeal of Tory trade union laws which will reduce the threshold for strike action, plus ending zero-hour contracts – will now not become law at the end of this month and instead be delayed until the autumn.\n\nThe delay, partly the result of Tory peers’ opposition in the Lords, came to light just days after an open letter in which the Conservatives urged businesses to rise up and fight Ms Rayner’s plans or be ‘sleepwalked into disaster’.\n\nCritics have warned that the proposals will make it more burdensome to employ workers and make union funding of the Labour Party automatic. \n\nThe Bill also contains strengthened redundancy rights, more flexible working and the power for ministers to take companies to employment tribunals on behalf of employees, even if they do not want to sue.\n\nLast week Lord Karan Bilimoria, founder of Cobra beer and UK chairman of the International Chamber of Commerce, warned: ‘This is like the 1970s and look where that got us.’\n\nBut Labour MPs hailed Ms Rayner for pushing her reforms through.\n\nChancellor Rachel Reeves last night breathed a sigh of relief after Donald Trump decided to drop plans for a ‘revenge tax’ which could have devastated some of Britain’s largest businesses.\n\nHe is removing a clause in his ‘One Big Beautiful Bill’ which would have allowed the US to slap retaliatory levies on foreign firms whose home countries had tax policies that displeased him.\n\nSuch penalties would deal a heavy blow to major UK firms such as drugmaker AstraZeneca and defence giant BAE Systems which rely on the US for a large chunk of their business.","summary":"Sir Keir Starmer was told to rein in Angela

Charlotte Rose Smith, 26, last month before being spotted back on the star-studded dating site.\n\n Lily James joins pal Billie Piper while Holly Willoughby and Margot Robbie let their hair down as they lead the celebrities at day one of Glastonbury Festival \nRaya is so exclusive that it accepts only around eight per cent of applicants, but it has more than 10,000 members, with 100,000 on the waiting list.\nJames' Raya profile is said to feature photos of the Happy Valley star with a shaved head – a dramatic new look he's adopted for his upcoming role in Sunny Dancer, currently being filmed in Scotland with co-star Bella Ramsey.\nThe hunk, who is a strong contender to be the next James Bond, started dating Charlotte late last year and was pictured out with her on several occasions.\nAt the time, an insider told The Sun: 'They have been enjoying dates and seem very happy together.\n'It has been a year since his relationship with [ex Imogen Potts] ended and he appears to get on so well with Charlotte.

He was reportedly listed on the app as being active for at least a month.\nOnce users find a new partner, they usually disable their profiles.\nA source said: 'Lily was looking for women that were on Raya and cross-referencing them with women David follows on Instagram to try to figure out who he was seeing. She was doing her Wagatha thing.\n'Lily only rejoined Raya to try to figure out whether he was seeing someone.\n'Lily has never even looked at anyone since she met David. She is devastated. He broke up with Lily a month ago.\n'He was meant to be on holiday with her in Kenya over Christmas.'\nInstagramHolly WilloughbyLily Allen\n\nShare or comment on this article: \nHolly Willoughby oozes festival chic in a leggy black mini dress and fedora as she leads the celebrities on the second day of sun-soaked Glastonbury\n\nAdd comment\n\nComments (0)\n\nComments are subject to our House rules and Terms\n\nLog in to comment\n\nWorst rated\n\nNo one seems to have shared their thoughts on this topic yet\nLeave a comment so your voice will be heard first.\nTerms | Privacy | Feedback\n\nEnter search term:\n\nTommy Fury shares hug with Molly-Mae Hague lookalike during wild night out as he parties until the early hours\n\nStrictly star mugged in Central London AND in broad daylight as 'traumatic' ordeal leaves them 'scared and helpless'\n\nHolly Willoughby oozes festival chic in a leggy black mini dress and fedora as she leads the celebrities on the second day of sun-soaked Glastonbury\n\nLizzo puts Ozempic results on full display in tiny swimsuit after coming clean about weight loss aid\n\nJeff Bezos' three-word response after new bride Lauren Sanchez is cornered by mob of Italian journalists: Live updates\n\nCould millennials turn to tech to help save for retirement?\n\nInjured David Beckham and son Romeo enjoy a colourful cake with his mum Sandra as they celebrate her 76th birthday \n\nFly-on-the-wall account of what really happened when Anna Wintour told stunned Vogue meeting room she was leaving\n\nGemma Collins left 'terrified' after being sent 'rat poison' in the post as TOWIE star ups security at her mansion following menacing letter earlier this month\n\nThe inspirational football club helping everyone enjoy the beautiful game -

protests on last day of extravaganza","text":"Hundreds of protesters have marched through Venice to protest against billionaire Jeff Bezos and his bride's wedding extravaganza on its third and final day.\n\nThe world's fourth-richest man and Lauren Sánchez Bezos tied the knot on Friday in a private ceremony with about 200 celebrity guests on the secluded island of San Giorgio.\n\nThe wedding angered many Venetians, with some activists arguing the billionaire was exploiting the city while ordinary residents were suffering from overtourism, high housing costs and the constant threat of climate-induced flooding.\n\nAs the two newlyweds prepared for the final party on Saturday evening, hundreds of Venetians and protesters from across Italy filled Venice's tiny streets with colourful banners reading \"Kisses Yes, Bezos No\" and \"No Bezos, no War\".\n\nThe demonstration contrasted with the expensive wedding bonanza, seen by critics as an affront to the lagoon city's fragile environment and its citizens.\n\nMartina Vergnano, one of the demonstrators, said: \"We are here to continue ruining the plans of these rich people who accumulate money by exploiting many other people … while the conditions of this city remain precarious.\"\n\nThe protest organisers claimed a victory after Saturday's wedding party, which was initially to be held in central Venice, was later moved to a former medieval shipyard, the Arsenale.\n\nMr Bezos donated 1 million euros ($1.79 million) each to three environmental research organisations working to preserve Venice, according to Venetian environmental research association Corila.\n\nBut many protesters blasted the move as a clear attempt to appease angry residents.\n\n\"We want a free Venice, which is finally dedicated to its citizens … those donations are just a misery and only aimed at clearing Bezos's conscience,\" Venetian activist Flavio Cogo said.\n\nDetails of the wedding ceremony on Friday night were a closely guarded secret until Ms Sánchez Bezos posted to Instagram a photo of herself beaming in a white gown as she stood alongside a tuxedo-clad Mr Bezos.\n\nThe star-studded guest list included Oprah Winfrey and NFL great Tom Brady, along with Hollywood stars Leonardo Di Caprio and Orlando Bloom, tech entrepreneur and philanthropist Bill Gates and top socialites, including the Kardashian-Jenner clan.\n\nUS President Donald Trump's daughter Ivanka Trump, her husband Jared Kushner, and their three children also joined the celebrations.\n\nThe bride and groom stayed at the Aman Venice hotel on the Grand Canal, where Mr Bezos posed for photos and Ms Sánchez Bezos blew kisses to the press.\n\n\"The planet is burning but don't worry, here's the list of the 27 dresses of Lauren Sánchez,\" read one protest slogan, a reference to the bride's reported wedding weekend wardrobe. \n\nIt featured a mermaid-lined wedding gown by Dolce & Gabbana and other Dolce Vita-inspired looks by Italian designers, including Schiaparelli and Bottega Veneta.\n\nThe city administration has strongly defended the nuptials as being in keeping with Venice's tradition as an open city that has welcomed popes, emperors and ordinary visitors alike for centuries.","summary":"Jeff Bezos and Lauren Sánchez Bezos's wedding in Venice continues to anger

madness'","text":"Elon Musk reignited his feud with Donald Trump as he tore into the president's spending bill in a blistering social media tirade. \n\nThe world's richest man condemned Trump's 'Big Beautiful Bill' as 'utter madness', hours before Senate Republicans are expected to hold an initial vote on the latest version of the bill on Saturday afternoon. \n\n'The latest Senate draft bill will destroy millions of jobs in America and cause immense strategic harm to our country,' Musk wrote in one of his X posts. \n\n'Utterly insane and destructive. It gives handouts to industries of the past while severely damaging industries of the future.' \n\nTrump's massive spending bill was notably the trigger for Musk and the president's dramatic fall out just three weeks ago, with Musk taking issue with the bill's estimated $2.8 trillion spending increases. \n\nMusk - who celebrated his 54th birthday Saturday as he slammed Trump's bill - also criticized the impact the bill will have on the energy industry, with Musk recently pushing for a sharp increase in solar energy in the US. \n\nResponding to a post that noted the Senate vote 'could wipe out 500 (Giga Watts) of potential energy generation' by 2030, Musk wrote: 'This would be incredibly destructive to America!' \n\n'At the same time, this bill raises the debt ceiling by $5 TRILLION, the biggest increase in history, putting America in the fast lane to debt slavery!' he added in another post. \n\nEarlier this month, Musk's opposition to the legislation saw his time in Trump's White House come to an acrimonious end as he tore into the president. \n\nMusk had spent the start of the year slashing the federal government's programs through his Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), but saw the $150 billion he claimed to have saved wiped out by the spending increases in Trump's bill. \n\nIn a shock X post that captured international headlines, Musk vented his fury by writing: '(Trump) is in the Epstein files. That is the real reason they have not been made public. Have a nice day, DJT!' \n\nMusk also claimed that Trump couldn't have won the 2024 presidential election without him, and said in a post that Trump's bill showed 'such ingratitude.' \n\nWhite House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told the Daily Mail at the time: 'This is an unfortunate episode from Elon, who is unhappy with the One Big Beautiful Bill because it does not include the policies he wanted.' \n\nTrump's sweeping Big Beautiful Bill encapsulates much of his domestic agenda, covering everything from tax breaks and immigration to national defense and energy. \n\nDemocrats are united against the bill, with Congressional Republicans - who hold majorities in both the House and Senate - set to decide whether President Trump's signature's domestic policy package will become law.\n\nTrump told Republicans to skip their holiday vacations and deliver the bill by the Fourth of July.\n\nRepublicans say the bill is crucial because there would be a massive tax increase after December when tax breaks from Trump's first term expire. The legislation contains roughly $3.8 trillion in tax cuts.\n\nThe existing tax rates and brackets would become permanent under the bill. It temporarily would add new tax breaks that Trump campaigned on: no taxes on tips, overtime pay or some automotive loans, along with a bigger $6,000 deduction in the Senate draft for older adults who earn no more than $75,000 a year.\n\nIt would boost the $2,000 child tax credit to $2,200 under the Senate proposal. Families at lower income levels would not see the full amount.\n\nThe bill would also fund the hiring of 10,000 new Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers, and would provide Homeland Security with a new $10 billion fund for grants for states that help with federal immigration enforcement and deportation actions. \n\nFor the Pentagon, the bill would provide billions for ship building, munitions systems, and quality of life measures for servicemen and women, as well as $25 billion for the development of the Golden Dome missile defense system. The Defense Department would have $1 billion for border security.\n\nTo help partly offset the lost tax revenue and new spending, Republicans aim to cut back some long-running government programs: Medicaid, food stamps, green energy incentives and others. It's essentially unraveling the accomplishments of the past two Democratic presidents, Biden and Barack Obama.","summary":"Elon Musk reignited his feud with Donald Trump as he tore into the president's spending bill in a blistering social media tirade on Saturday as the legislation hangs in the balance in Congress.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-14857135/Elon-Musk-Trump-Big-Beautiful-Bill-utter-madness-X.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/06/28/23/99823749-0-image-a-8_1751149433825.jpg","video":"https://videos.dailymail.co.uk/video/mol/2025/06/06/5857904361905016685/1024x576_MP4_5857904361905016685.mp4","publish_date":"2025-06-28 22:41:15","author":"Editor,Will Potter","authors":["Editor","Will Potter"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.179},{"id":336260802,"title":"A shadow Fed chief could lead to a ‘revolt’ on the FOMC against Powell’s successor, former vice chair warns","text":"President Donald Trump said earlier this month his pick to replace Powell is coming “very soon,” and on Friday even vowed to tap someone who will do what he has been pressuring the Fed to do for months.\n\n“If I think somebody’s going to keep the rates where they are or whatever, I’m not going to put them in,” Trump said. “I’m going to put somebody that wants to cut rates.”\n\nThat’s after repeated insults and name-calling directed at Powell, who has held off on lowering rates, citing the resilient economy and the risk that Trump’s own tariffs could reaccelerate inflation.\n\nPowell’s term as chair expires in May 2026, and the typical transition to a new one is about three to four months, meaning a replacement pick would be named as soon as January under normal circumstances. \n\nBy naming a new chair well before that, the nominee could in theory jawbone markets into easing financial conditions, such as lowering bond yields, before taking office and undermine Powell’s messaging in his final months.\n\nBut in practice, the result could be chaos. Princeton professor Alan Blinder, who served as the Fed’s vice chair in the 1990s, told CNN that a shadow chair is “an absolutely horrible idea” because markets would have to sort through potentially very different stances at the same time.\n\n“If they’re not singing from the same playbook, which seems likely, this is just going to cause confusion in markets,” he warned.\n\nSimilarly, Michael Brown, senior research strategist at Pepperstone, said in a note that a shadow chair would be self-defeating and create “chaotic policy rhetoric, thus further weakening policy transmission.”\n\nAnd the perception of greater political influence over the Fed is likely to result in accelerated outflows from both the U.S. dollar and Treasury bonds, pushing yields and other borrowing costs higher.\n\n“Lastly, and probably of most annoyance for Trump, is that all of this nonsense actually makes the bar for the Fed to deliver a rate cut even higher, given mounting external pressure, and a desire to preserve policy independence,” Brown added.\n\nFed officials make a point of sticking to central banking and not opining on politics, White House policies, or bills in Congress. On the flip side, they carefully guard the Fed’s reputation for being independent from political pressure. \n\nBlinder flagged the risk that a shadow Fed chair would set up a big showdown in the usually consensus-driven Federal Open Market Committee, which sets rates.\n\n“If he or she contradicts what Powell is saying, that will aggravate the FOMC, almost all of whose members will still be there when the new chair takes over,” he explained. “It opens the door to an open or silent revolt against the chair, which is a rare thing in Fed history.”\n\nA schism is already emerging at the Fed. Trump-appointed governors Christopher Waller and Michelle Bowman have said a rate cut in July could be justified, while Powell and other policymakers have said more months of data are necessary to make such a call.\n\nMeanwhile, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent downplayed the idea of a shadow Fed chair in an interview on CNBC on Friday, but also pointed out that Adriana Kugler’s term as Fed governor expires in early 2026.\n\n“So there is a chance that the person who is going to become the chair could be appointed in January, which would probably mean an October, November nomination,” he said.","summary":"\"If he or she contradicts what Powell is saying, that will aggravate the FOMC, almost all of whose members will still be there when the new chair takes over.\"","url":"https://fortune.com/2025/06/28/shadow-fed-chair-backfire-fomc-revolt-trump-jerome-powell/","image":"https://fortune.com/img-assets/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/GettyImages-2209986280.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-06-28 22:33:16","author":"Jason Ma","authors":["Jason Ma"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.257},{"id":336265934,"title":"Musk condemns latest Senate bill that would 'destroy millions of jobs,' raise taxes on wind, solar projects","text":"Former DOGE head and tech mogul Elon Musk took to X on his 54th birthday Saturday to bash the latest Senate draft of President Donald Trump&apos;s \"big, beautiful bill,\" which would \"destroy millions of jobs\" and raise taxes on all wind and solar projects that have not yet started construction. \"The latest Senate draft bill will destroy millions of jobs in America and cause immense strategic harm to our country!

ELON MUSK POSTS ‘KILL BILL’ MEME IN LATEST PUSH TO NIX TRUMP’S ‘BIG, BEAUTIFUL BILL&apos; In his post about the environmental cuts, Musk said the bill would give \"handouts\" to industries of the past, while severely damaging industries of the future. The American Clean Power Association (ACP) issued a similar statement Saturday, noting the new taxes would freeze energy investments, reduce domestic energy production and drive up household energy bills. \"With no warning, the Senate has proposed new language that would increase taxes on domestic energy production,\" ACP CEO Jason Grumet wrote in a statement. \"In what can only be described as ‘midnight dumping,’ the Senate has proposed a punitive tax hike targeting the fastest-growing sectors of our energy industry.\" DAVID MARCUS: MUSK VS. MAGA ON &apos;BIG, BEAUTIFUL BILL,&apos; BUT GOP NEEDS BOTH Grumet added the new taxes would \"strand hundreds of billions of dollars in current investments, threaten energy security, undermine growth in domestic manufacturing and land hardest on rural communities who would have been the greatest beneficiaries of clean energy investment.\" \"We understand the Senate’s desire to meet the President’s July 4th deadline, but the stakes here are very high,\" he wrote. \"We urge Senate leadership to strike these last-minute tax increases and to take the time to responsibly analyze the impacts of this new tax regime on American businesses and communities.\" Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., on Saturday afternoon said she was helping to hold the Senate \"all night\" to \"FORCE\" a full reading of the nearly 1,000-page bill.
