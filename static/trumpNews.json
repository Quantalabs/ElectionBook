This move is in response to the ongoing ‘witch hunt’ trial against former president Jair Bolsonaro. The tariff is meant to serve as a punitive measure.\n\nTrump fired off a furious letter to Brazilian President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva on Wednesday laying out the details of his new tariff.\n\nTrump expressed in a letter shared on Truth Social that the treatment of Bolsonaro by Brazil is an ‘international disgrace.’ He praised Bolsonaro as a ‘Highly Respected Leader throughout the world’ and criticized the legal proceedings against him.\n\nBolsonaro is currently on trial under allegations of attempting to overturn the 2022 election results. He had already testified in June before Brazil’s Supreme Court regarding accusations of plotting to stay in power after the loss.\n\nBolsonaro has already been barred from from running for office until 2030 by the country’s electoral authorities. \n\n‘This Trial should not be taking place. It is a Witch Hunt that should end IMMEDIATELY!’ \n\nTrump has described Bolsonaro as a friend and hosted the former Brazilian president at his Mar-a-Lago resort when both were in power in 2020.\n\nThe president said his whopping tariff was also in part a response to Brazil’s ‘insidious attacks on Free Elections and the Fundamental Free Speech rights of Americans.’ \n\nHe said a decision by Brazil’s Supreme Court to fine and temporarily block US social media companies last year amounted to ‘SECRET and UNLAWFUL Censorship Orders.’ \n\nTrump said he is launching an investigation as a result under Section 301 of the Trade Act of 1974, which applies to countries with trade practices that are deemed unfair to U.S. companies.\n\n‘Starting August 1, we will charge Brazil a tariff of 50 percent on any and all Brazilian products sent into the United States, separate from all Sectoral tariffs. \n\n‘Goods transshipped to evade this 50 percent tariff will be subject to that higher tariff,’ he warned.\n\nTrump described the current trade relationship between America and Brazil as ‘very unfair’ and ‘far from reciprocal.’\n\n‘Please understand that the 50 percent number is far less than what is needed to have the Level Playing Field we must have with your country.’ \n\nBrazil’s current president Lula responded with a forceful statement warning Trump’s tariffs would trigger the country’s economic reciprocity law, which allows trade, investment and intellectual property agreements to be suspended against countries that harm Brazil’s competitiveness. \n\nHe noted that the US has had a trade surplus of more than $410 billion with Brazil over the past 15 years.\n\n‘Brazil is a sovereign country with independent institutions that will not accept being taken for granted by anyone,’ Lula said.\n\nBrazil’s vice president, Geraldo Alckmin, said he sees ‘no reason’ for the US to hike tariffs on the South American nation.\n\n‘I think he has been misinformed,’ he said. ‘President Lula was jailed for almost two years. No one questioned the judiciary. No one questioned what the country had done. This is a matter for our judiciary branch.’\n\nTrump, too, was indicted in 2023 for his efforts to overturn the results of the 2020 US presidential election. \n\nHe compared their situations in a Tuesday Truth Social post, writing: ‘He is not guilty of anything, except having fought for THE PEOPLE. \n\n‘His Election was very close and now, he is leading in the Polls. This is nothing more, or less, than an attack on a Political Opponent — Something I know much about! It happened to me, times 10, and now our Country is the ‘HOTTEST’ in the World!’\n\nThe tariffs starting August 1 would be a dramatic increase from the 10 percent rate that Trump levied on Brazil as part of his April 2 ‘Liberation Day’ announcement. \n\nBrazil sells oil, orange juice, coffee, iron and steel to the US, among other products. \n\nThe US ran a $6.8 billion trade surplus with Brazil last year, according to the Census Bureau.\n\nTrump initially announced his broad tariffs by declaring an economic emergency, arguing under a 1977 law that the US was at risk because of persistent trade imbalances. \n\nBut that rationale becomes murky in this particular case, as Trump is linking his tariffs to the Bolsonaro trial and the US exports more to Brazil than it imports.\n\nTrump also sent letters Wednesday to the leaders of seven other nations – the Philippines, Brunei, Moldova, Algeria, Libya, Iraq and Sri Lanka.\n\nMost economic analyses say the tariffs will worsen inflationary pressures and subtract from economic growth, but Trump has used the taxes as a way to assert the diplomatic and financial power of the US on both rivals and allies. \n\nHis administration argues the taxes will lower trade imbalances, offset some of the cost of the tax cuts he signed into law on Friday as part of the Big Beautiful Bill and bring factory jobs back to the United States.\n\n‘We really haven’t had too many complaints because I’m keeping them at a very low number, very conservative as you would say,’ Trump said.\n\nOfficials for the European Union, a major trade partner and source of Trump’s ire on trade, said Tuesday that they are not expecting to receive a letter from Trump listing tariff rates. \n\nThe president started the process of announcing tariff rates on Monday by hitting two major US trading partners, Japan and South Korea, with import taxes of 25 percent.\n\nThe letters were posted on Truth Social after the expiration of a 90-day negotiating period with a baseline levy of 10 percent.\n\nTrump is giving countries more time to negotiate with his August 1 deadline, but he has insisted there will be no extensions for the countries that receive letters.\n\nThe president threatened additional tariffs on any country that attempts to retaliate.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nPresident Donald Trump has imposed a 50 percent import tariff on all&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Trump Imposes 50% Tariff on Brazil Amid &#8216;Witch Hunt&#8217; Dispute first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/news/trump-imposes-50-tariff-on-brazil-amid-witch-hunt-dispute/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Trump-slaps-50-tariff-on-Brazil-as-punishment-for-witch.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-07-10 01:16:45","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.222},{"id":340044952,"title":"Trump says 50% tariff on copper will begin Aug. 1","text":"U.S. President Donald Trump said Thursday that the 50% tariff on copper imports, which he announced earlier on Tuesday, will begin on Aug. 1.\n\nThe decision was made after he received a national security assessment, Trump said in a post on Truth Social.\n\n\"I am announcing a 50% TARIFF on Copper, effective August 1, 2025, after receiving a robust NATIONAL SECURITY ASSESSMENT,\" Trump wrote.\n\n\"Copper is necessary for Semiconductors, Aircraft, Ships, Ammunition, Data Centers, Lithium-ion Batteries, Radar Systems, Missile Defense Systems, and even, Hypersonic Weapons, of which we are building many. Copper is the second most used material by the Department of Defense.\"\n\nAdam Whiteley of BNY Investments said on CNBC's \"Squawk Box\" that Trump's latest announcement is indicative of the trade policy that he wants to protect.\n\n\"Copper is probably in a third category of tariffs, which is national security. So we've got negotiating tactics, we've got addressing trade imbalances, and then the copper, or indeed, any of the minerals, maybe semiconductors, maybe pharmaceuticals,\" Whiteley said.\n\nEarlier on Tuesday, U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick told CNBC's \"Power Lunch\" that the Trump administration wants to bring \"copper production home.\" He noted that Trump's move will bring copper tariffs in line with U.S. duties on imports of steel and aluminum, which Trump doubled to 50% in early June.\n\nCopper is the third-most-consumed metal, behind iron and aluminum. The U.S. imports nearly half of the copper it uses, most of which comes from Chile, according to data from the U.S. Geological Survey. Trump in late February ordered a probe into potential new tariffs on copper imports on national security grounds.\n\n— CNBC's Kevin Breuninger contributed to this report.\n\nThis is breaking news.

Experts say it’s an impossible goal — and dangerous","text":"President Donald Trump has signed into law a massive piece of legislation that hands more than $178 billion to immigration enforcement over the next decade, with $30 billion specifically for Immigration and Customs Enforcement.\n\nThat injection of taxpayer cash makes the law enforcement agency one of the most expensive police forces in the world, outpacing most foreign military budgets.\n\nThe White House wants to hire 10,000 more ICE agents, a massive undertaking for an administration that is currently employing roughly half that figure to help remove people from the country.\n\nBut hitting that 10,000 target is going to be a challenge, if not impossible, according to experts. And, without any guardrails to screen how those agents are hired and who exactly is filling those roles, the government may be setting itself up to repeat critical past mistakes.\n\nTrump’s funding surge is “also about building an immigration enforcement system that will sustain a much higher number of deportations, not just in the next two and a half, three years, but in the next 10 years,” former acting ICE director Josh Sandweg told PBS.\n\n“We're going to see an ICE that it is going to be hard for any future administration to shrink … and its capacity to deport will certainly be at the highest level it's ever been in the history of the United States,” he said.\n\nWhen Trump tried to hire 10,000 ICE officers during his first administration, more than 500,000 people would have needed to apply, according to a Homeland Security inspector general report at the time.\n\nThe outlook was even more difficult for Customs and Border Protection. To hire another 5,000 agents, the government would have had to screen another 750,000 people, the report found.\n\n“No healthy law enforcement agency can grow quickly. And ICE is far from a healthy law enforcement agency,” according to journalist Garrett Graff, who spent several years investigating the combustible expansion of Border Patrol into a “green monster” before and during the first Trump administration.\n\nWithin only a few years, Border Patrol doubled in size from roughly 9,200 officers to 18,000. A remarkable spike in corruption and misconduct accompanied a swelling of the ranks.\n\n“Today, we’re creating something even more dangerous to the country,” Graff wrote. “A masked monster of a law enforcement agency, one uniquely unsuited for its new power, authority, reach, and funding levels.”\n\nICE is also competing with other law enforcement agencies who can offer better or similar pay for a less volatile position.\n\nAnnual salaries for open ICE jobs are between $56,623 and $89,528. Starting salaries for rookie officers hired by the New York Police Department, by comparison, begin at $60,000 and increase to $125,000 within six years — and the NYPD still is facing a staffing crisis.\n\nICE and its roughly 6,000 deportation officers are under similarly intense legal and political scrutiny, including nationwide protests, legislation that bans officers from wearing masks, and lawsuits to rein in constitutional abuses.\n\nThe Trump administration has also deployed officers from virtually every federal law enforcement agency — from the FBI and the Drug Enforcement Administration to the Post Office — to hit a goal of 3,000 daily arrests while expanding an already-sprawling footprint of local jails and federal immigration detention centers that hold more than 50,000 immigrants, a figure that grows by the day.\n\nICE could try to get around its hiring problems by expanding the 287(g) program, which effectively deputizes local law enforcement to enforce federal immigration laws. The federal government currently has more than 800 such agreements in place.\n\nBut the program requires local buy-in. Democratic-led cities such as New York City, Chicago and Los Angeles, home to millions of immigrants, are unlikely to participate.\n\n“That could alleviate ICE’s short-run logistical challenge, but it is also the option most vulnerable to local resistance,” according to Fordham Law School professor John Pfaff. “And many states and localities already have either banned such agreements or limited the sorts of cooperation that’s possible, with more joining in.”\n\nThe Trump administration could also end up relying on private contractors to help fill the gaps — which could burn through budgets, make it harder to retain permanent agents who aren’t paid as well, and raise serious accountability and constitutional issues.\n\nAt a Homeland Security hiring expo last month, more than 1,000 people were tentatively offered job offers, out of roughly 3,000 candidates. Homeland Security hailed the event as a success “despite doxing threats, increased assaults and the recent wave of politicians’ anti-cop rhetoric.”\n\nEqually important is who, exactly, is filling those roles.\n\n“Hiring fast doesn’t work in law enforcement, but I think there’s a specific reason we should be wary of the next 10,000 people who want to be ICE officers in the United States,” Graff wrote. “We’ve never seen anything in modern U.S. history like the fast-rising social stigma and politicization of ICE as an agency and brand in terms of recruiting.”\n\nLowering hiring standards for immigration enforcement — which the Border Patrol union has warned against — could also invite even “less competent and potentially more dangerous” recruits into environments that even local cops are complaining about, according to Pfaff.\n\nICE is still a relatively young agency, born in the 9/11 aftermath and George W. Bush-era War on Terror, and has not yet experienced the “pendulum swing” of changing cultural and political climates, Graff wrote.\n\n“That ICE has gone so quickly to masked operations in unmarked vehicles with no clear law enforcement identification makes clear how unhealthy and fundamentally undemocratic its core culture now is,” he wrote. “It’s a resounding indictment of the current leadership at ICE and a warning sign of what’s to come.”","summary":"The administration hopes an historic injection of taxpayer cash can fix hiring challenges for an agency facing intense political and legal scrutiny, Alex Woodward reports","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/trump-deportations-funding-ice-agents-hiring-b2786045.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/07/10/0/09/US-POLITICS-IMMIGRATION-5urjdwyd.jpeg?width=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/fijA3CcV-4VHSaSK0.mp4","publish_date":"2025-07-10 00:32:56","author":"Alex Woodward","authors":["Alex Woodward"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.169},{"id":340040400,"title":"World News | Trump Announces Tariffs on Imports from Sri Lanka, Iraq and Five Other Nations","text":"Washington, DC [US], July 10 (ANI): US President Donald Trump on Wednesday announced a fresh round of tariffs on imports from seven nations - Sri Lanka, Algeria, Iraq, Libya, the Philippines, Moldova and Brunei.

Pretty much they have had their way for many, many decades. It was time that we just wanted fairness. This is not really equitable from our standpoint because this is a small token by comparison to damages been done over the years but we had no other president that was willing to do this, but I did it,\" he said.\nHe added that his second term would outperform his first in terms of tariff collection and economic impact.\n\"Even in my first term with China and others. We took in hundreds and billions of dollars of tariffs. No inflation, the most successful period of time we've ever had financially in the country- the first term, I think this time's going to be much better. Even better than the last time. This is going to be substantially better, and we're on our way doing that. We have already taken in over a hundred billion dollars' worth of tariffs and we haven't even started. All I have to say to other countries- some of them want to make it real and fair. Others got a little bit spoilt. For years, they have taken advantage of the country. So I would say final, but if they call with different alternative, I will do it,\" he said.\nWhen asked if he is firm on his August 1 deadline for US tariffs, Trump said, \"I would say firm but not a 100 per cent firm. If they call up and they say we would like to do something in a different way, we will be open to that.\"\nEarlier, Trump shared letters sent by his administration to 14 countries, informing them of the reciprocal tariffs that will take effect from August 1.\nTrump first shared the letters sent to Japan's Prime Minister Fumio Kishida and South Korea's President Yoon Suk-yeol. Around two hours later, he announced that similar letters had been sent to Malaysia, Kazakhstan, South Africa, Myanmar, and Laos.\nLater, he shared tariff letters sent to leaders of other countries, including Thailand, Bangladesh, Indonesia, Tunisia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Serbia and Cambodia. In the letters written to the South Korean President and the Japanese Prime Minister, Trump stated that Japan and South Korea will face a 25 per cent tariff from August 1.\nMeanwhile, Thailand and Cambodia each will face a tariff of 36 per cent, while Bangladesh and Serbia will each be hit with a tariff of 35 per cent. Trump also mentioned that Malaysia and Kazakhstan will each face 25 per cent tariffs, with Myanmar and Laos facing a 40 per cent tariff on their goods exported to the US.\nIndonesia will face a tariff rate of 32 per cent, and imports from South Africa and Bosnia and Herzegovina will be subject to 30 per cent tariffs on August 1. According to his letters, Tunisia will face a tariff of 25 per cent.

Currently, he is senior vice-president of operations, overseeing the global supply chain and ensuring product quality.His ascension comes at a particularly tumultuous time for the Cupertino-based phonemaker, as it faces Washington’s ire over global expansion of its manufacturing facilities, including in India. US President Donald Trump has threatened steep tariffs on the company’s products if it does not bring production back home.“The Trump tariff black cloud is a big issue with China and India that Sabih will have to tackle,” said Daniel Ives, managing director and senior equity research analyst at Wedbush Securities. “Also, a lot of challenges on the AI front, with Apple way behind. We see acquisitions on the horizon.”But Khan’s primary challenge will remain “rewriting (Apple's supply chain) playbook for a multipolar world,” said Anurag Agarwal, founder of market research firm Techaisle.He said this is because the ‘China+1’ strategy of diversifying into India and Vietnam is not a straightforward process. “While the COO role at any global company is demanding, taking the operational reins of Apple right now is akin to being asked to redesign a spaceship’s engine while it navigates an asteroid field,” said Agarwal. “Khan is not just stepping into a role; he is stepping into the house that Cook built (as the former COO) —a house that now spans the globe and is beset by tremors.”Khan is drawing encomiums as more Indian-origin CEOs join the ranks of top technology executives, including 47-year-old Vaibhav Taneja, who was appointed as Tesla’s Chief financial officer in 2023 but made headlines in May when he surpassed the paychecks of top CEOs like Satya Nadella and Sundar Pichai. Khan will take charge from the current COO, Jeff Williams, later this month as part of what Apple has described as a “long-planned succession.” Williams has long been touted to be Cook’s successor.In a statement on Tuesday, Cook said that “while overseeing Apple’s supply chain, (Khan) has helped pioneer new technologies in advanced manufacturing, overseen the expansion of Apple’s manufacturing footprint in the US, and helped ensure Apple can be nimble in response to global challenges.”The handset maker has significantly expanded its footprint in India in recent times. The country has become an important part of its diversification away from China, with exports going up. ET reported on March 31 that Foxconn is aiming to assemble 25-30 million units in 2025, which is more than double their output last year. Reports also suggested that most of these iPhones are making their way directly to the US. In May, Cook said a majority of iPhones sold in the US this quarter will be sourced from India. Balancing actExperts are of the view that perfecting a balancing act between the US and China, where Apple has most of its operations, will likely be at the top of the new COO’s agenda. Furthermore, he needs to meet the audacious goal of making the entire supply chain carbon neutral by 2030.Techaisle’s Agarwal said the ultimate test for Khan will be to ensure iPhones, MacBooks and Vision Pros are on shelves and at doorsteps on time, at the expected quality, and without sudden price shocks. He called Khan's work the “silent, beating heart of Apple.”Recently, reports of the recall of 300 Chinese engineers from the India facility of Apple contract manufacturer Foxconn’s India facility, at the behest of Beijing, sparked concerns locally. China's powerful place in the supply chain can put the brakes on India's ambitions to become a key part of Apple's global value chain, analysts said.Diaspora cheersPrior to Apple, Sabih worked as an applications development engineer and key account technical leader at GE Plastics. He earned a bachelor’s degree in economics and mechanical engineering from Tufts University and a master’s degree in mechanical engineering from Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute.Apple CFO Kevan Parekh is also of Indian origin. He was the company’s vice president of financial planning and analysis and became CFO on January 1 this year, replacing Luca Maestri.Sanjeev Joshipura, executive director at Indiaspora, said, “At this time of tectonic geopolitical shifts, supply chain disruptions, and the increasing penetration of artificial intelligence into varied realms of life, being elevated to the chief operating officer role at a global mega corporation like Apple is a remarkably impressive accomplishment.\"","summary":"Sabih Khan, Apple's new COO, faces the challenge of reordering the global supply chain amid geopolitical tensions and the company's AI lag. He must balance US-China relations while expanding manufacturing in India and meeting sustainability goals. Khan's success hinges on ensuring timely delivery and quality of Apple products, navigating a complex and evolving global landscape.","url":"https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/tech/technology/new-strategist-coo-at-apple-faces-tariff-test/articleshow/122347627.cms","image":"https://img.etimg.com/thumb/width-1200,height-900,imgsize-12064,resizemode-75,msid-122347627/tech/technology/new-strategist-coo-at-apple-faces-tariff-test.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-07-10 00:30:00","author":"Dia Rekhi","authors":["Dia Rekhi"],"language":"en","source_country":"in","sentiment":-0.244},{"id":340042070,"title":"6 Secret Service agents suspended over conduct during attempted Trump assassination","text":"Six agents have been issued suspensions by the U.S. Secret Service for failures connected to last year's attempted assassination of then-presidential candidate Donald Trump in Butler, Pennsylvania, an official told ABC News.\n\nThe personnel moves were confirmed four days shy of the anniversary of the July 13, 2024, shooting incident that left Trump's ear bloodied.\n\nCorey Comperatore, a firefighter attending Trump's campaign rally that day, died in the attack.\n\nCountersnipers in Trump's Secret Service who were on-site killed the shooter, identified by the FBI as 20-year-old Thomas Matthew Crooks.\n\nIn the aftermath of the shooting, an independent review by the Department of Homeland Security showed a series of law enforcement breakdowns had created an environment that left Trump vulnerable to a would-be assassin.\n\n\"The Secret Service does not perform at the elite levels needed to discharge its critical mission,\" the report found. \"The Secret Service has become bureaucratic, complacent, and static even though risks have multiplied and technology has evolved.\"\n\nThe Secret Service director at the time, Kimberly Cheatle, resigned 10 days after the shooting.\n\nThe discipline against the six agents was issued in recent months, and the agents have the right to appeal.

The review included responses from 70 female Filipino fire survivors and found that 16 percent had engaged in “survival sex in exchange for basic necessities post-disaster,” with “a landlord, an employer, family members, friends and acquaintances.”\n\nOne of the authors of the report, Khara Jabola-Carolus, told Politico that the Trump administration had misinterpreted the findings. \n\n“I’m more concerned about just the gross manipulation of using that statistic to do the opposite of what the report calls for,” she told the outlet. “Like funding FEMA to improve their response for women’s needs.”\n\nIn a May press release, DHS states that the report showed “FEMA’s horrific neglect and mismanagement under the Biden Administration.”\n\nAt the FEMA review meeting Noem said, “This job of remaking this agency is not nearly as simple as it should be.”\n\n“Because we’re up against decades of gross mismanagement and negligence,” she added. “The list of FEMA’s failures is staggering. The scale of those failures is matched only by their longevity. FEMA has been disastrous at times, incompetent at times. And not just in the last few years but for decades.”\n\nPresident Donald Trump has been eyeing the shutdown of the agency for some time. Last month, he said he wants states to stop using the agency. The Trump administration has canceled FEMA grants worth billions intended for local projects to protect communities from natural disasters. \n\nAt the same time, White House officials have praised the agency’s work on responding to the floods in the Texas Hill Country, where more than one hundred people have been killed.","summary":"Noem says administration is ‘up against decades of gross mismanagement and negligence’ in remaking FEMA","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/lahaina-wildfires-kristi-noem-fema-b2786082.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/07/09/23/01/SEI258341595.jpg?width=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/fscweJlV-4VHSaSK0.mp4","publish_date":"2025-07-10 00:27:53","author":"Gustaf Kilander","authors":["Gustaf Kilander"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.458},{"id":340044288,"title":"‘Seen and Unseen’: How is Trump ‘blinging out’ the Oval Office?","text":"‘Seen and Unseen’: How is Trump ‘blinging out’ the Oval Office? | Fox News Video\n\nto top close\n\nThis video is playing in picture-in-picture.\n\nIngraham Angle\n\nJuly 09, 2025\n\n‘Seen and Unseen’: How is Trump ‘blinging out’ the Oval Office?\n\nFox News contributor Raymond Arroyo checks out President Donald Trump's sense of humor on 'The Ingraham Angle.'\n\nTHE INGRAHAM ANGLE\n\nWHAT TO WATCH | VIDEOS\n\nLATEST NEWS | VIDEOS\n\nNOW - 9:00 PM\n\nFox News Channel\n\nJesse Watters Primetime\n\n8:00 PM - 9:00 PM\n\n9:00 PM - 10:00 PM\n\n10:00 PM - 11:00 PM\n\nFox News @ Night\n\n11:00 PM - 11:30 PM\n\nFox Business Channel\n\nLegends & Lies: The Patriots\n\n8:00 PM - 9:00 PM\n\nLegends & Lies: The Patriots\n\n9:00 PM - 10:00 PM\n\nLegends & Lies: The Patriots\n\n10:00 PM - 11:00 PM\n\nLegends & Lies: The Patriots\n\n11:00 PM - 11:30 PM\n\nFox Weather Channel\n\nFox Weather\n\nLive Stream\n\nFox News Radio\n\nFOX News Radio Live Channel Coverage\n\nLive Stream\n\nFox News Channel Live\n\nFox Weather\n\nLive Stream","summary":"Fox News contributor Raymond Arroyo checks out President Donald Trump&apos;s sense of humor on &apos;The Ingraham Angle.&apos;","url":"https://www.foxnews.com/video/6375466416112","image":"https://a57.foxnews.com/cf-images.us-east-1.prod.boltdns.net/v1/static/694940094001/11b17326-ecf5-4f34-9a3c-78fe060a3b8b/cbd0ea58-807c-4b88-a020-ce740a74f207/1280x720/match/1024/512/image.jpg?ve=1&tl=1","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-07-10 00:25:44","author":null,"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.466},{"id":340039638,"title":"Trump Advisor Susie Wiles Explains How Elon Musk’s Obsession with the President Led to Trouble","text":"Donald Trump’s right-hand woman has lifted the lid on Elon Musk’s contentious relationship with the president and why it was doomed from the start.\n\nSusie Wiles, the president’s chief of staff nicknamed the ‘Ice Maiden,’ divulged new details on the tempestuous relationship between the world’s richest man and the world’s most powerful man. \n\nAs chief of staff she is privy to high-level discussions and maintains a seat in Cabinet meetings and even in the Situation Room. \n\nHer access to the White House is practically unparalleled, meaning while Musk sometimes overnighted in the Lincoln Bedroom, she saw everything close up.\n\nPractically attached at the hip for the final stages of the Trump’s 2024 campaign until Musk’s departure from DOGE at the end of May, the duo’s relationship has soured rapidly in their weeks apart.\n\n‘How can people be expected to have faith in Trump if he won’t release the Epstein files?’ Musk wrote on Tuesday putting the administration on blast for not releasing the full trove of documents on the deceased convicted pedophile.\n\nThe X owner has posted on his app about Trump many times since his White House split, even skewering the Republican’s domestic policy plan, the ‘Big, Beautiful Bill,’ claiming it would drive America into ‘debt slavery.’\n\nBut behind the scenes Musk and Trump had a relationship that Wiles said was akin to a father-son connection. \n\n‘The president was very, very kind to him, and Elon had so much to offer us,’ Wiles said. \n\nSpeaking with the New York Post’s Miranda Devine, Wiles agreed with the host’s assessment that Musk had a ‘fatherly fixation’ with Trump. \n\n‘He knew things we didn’t know. He knew people and technologies that we didn’t know. It was a great thing when it was a great thing, and had a very, I think, a very troublesome ending.’\n\nWhen pressed by Devine about why things imploded like one of the SpaceX owner’s test flights the politically astute ‘Ice Maiden’ dodged. \n\n‘I don’t know. I don’t understand it.’\n\nShe described the fracas as ‘very troublesome,’ but downplayed the spat as just a ‘little hiccup’ for the White House. \n\n‘I know that what has been said doesn’t ring accurate to me, but I don’t know, I enjoyed working with Elon,’ Wiles continued while choosing her words carefully about the two trading barbs online.\n\nIn June, Musk posted then deleted a statement claiming the president ‘is in the Epstein files … That is the real reason they have not been made public. Have a nice day, DJT!’\n\nThe billionaire later apologized, saying he regretted some of his posts about the Republican. Musk again revitalized the attack line on Tuesday, claiming, without evidence, that former Trump advisor Steve Bannon is on the Epstein list. \n\nTrump called Musk a ‘train wreck’ after the billionaire’s frenzied posts, often coming in the early morning hours. \n\nThough Musk’s outrage goes beyond just traditional MAGA figures. \n\nAfter Trump’s tax-and-spending bill passed last week the mega-billionaire announced the creation of a new political party, the ‘America Party,’ though it is not yet registered with the Federal Election Commission. \n\nThe father of at least 14 children also claimed he would primary every Republican that voted for the over $3 trillion package, which is all but five, meaning 268 GOP lawmakers can expect challenges to their reelection – if Musk is to be believed. \n\n‘I think he’s a fascinating person and sees the world differently. And I think that’s probably what the President saw too, just a little bit different than the average Joe, but certainly came to not a good ending,’ Wiles said. \n\nThough the chief of staff compared Elon Musk to an average Joe, she did laud him for being the world’s richest person and ‘I think the world’s smartest man, honestly.’\n\nShe also said the billionaire’s intuition and ‘insight into people’ during the transition period was important to the team’s success. \n\n‘He does have a quirky, my word, approach to the way he views virtually everything, but certainly business and organizations and and government and insight into people that were really important, I think, in the very early days, particularly during transition.’ \n\nWiles, 68, is a longtime political consultant and lobbyist who has been in Trump’s inner orbit since February 2021. \n\nShe previously worked for Ronald Reagan’s administration and has gotten praise among Republicans for keeping the energetic and – at times – frenetic president on task and on message.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nDonald Trump&#8217;s right-hand woman has lifted the lid on Elon Musk&#8217;s contentious&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Trump Advisor Susie Wiles Explains How Elon Musk&#8217;s Obsession with the President Led to Trouble first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/celeb/celeb-news/trump-advisor-susie-wiles-explains-how-elon-musks-obsession-with-the-president-led-to-trouble/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/rewrite-this-title-Susie-Wiles-speaks-on-Trump-Musk-relationship.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-07-10 00:24:37","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.036},{"id":340041254,"title":"Trump slaps new tariffs on Sri Lanka, Iraq, 5 other countries with a warning: ‘If you raise your…’","text":"US President Donald Trump on Wednesday announced a fresh round of tariffs targeting seven countries -- Algeria, Brunei, Iraq, Libya, Moldova, Sri Lanka and the Philippines.

The image showed a man wearing a red MAGA hat being submerged under floodwaters in Kerr County, Texas, while holding a \"HELP\" sign. There is also a speech bubble of the man saying, \"Gov’t is the problem not the solution.\" Text at the top of the cartoon read, \"Swept Away...\" CNN PANEL RIPS 'PARTISANS' FOR HIJACKING TEXAS FLOOD TRAGEDY FOR POLITICAL GAIN Buffalo News’ editorial cartoonist Adam Zyglis seemed to clarify that this text was in reference to Trump supporters’ arguments for smaller government being \"swept away\" after the flood in an Instagram post. \"Tomorrow’s lines… that argument’s gone in a flash,\" Zyglis wrote when posting his cartoon on Monday. He also included tags for \"noaa,\" \"national weather service,\" \"doge,\" \"cuts\" and \"maga.\" Several liberal media figures and Democratic Party members have come under fire for similarly politicizing the flash floods and blaming President Donald Trump and DOGE for causing the tragedy, despite reports that the National Weather Service office in the area had extra staff on duty at the time of the flooding. White House spokesperson Abigail Jackson attacked liberals for their comments on Monday and pointed out that their accusations have been repeatedly debunked by experts. \"It’s shameful and disgusting that in the wake of tragedy, the left’s first instinct is to lie and politicize a disaster to target their political opponents,\" she told Fox News Digital. \"False claims about the NWS have been repeatedly debunked by meteorologists, experts, and other public reporting. The NWS did their job, even issuing a flood watch more than 12 hours in advance. The Trump Administration is grateful to the first responders who sprang into action to save hundreds lives during this catastrophe, and will continue to help the great state of Texas in their recovery efforts.\" OBAMA BROS BALK AT FAR-LEFT SAYING TEXANS BROUGHT FLOOD DISASTER ON THEMSELVES BY SUPPORTING TRUMP The cartoon faced backlash on social media. Erie County Republican Committee Chairman Michael Kracker wrote, \"@TheBuffaloNews ran a cartoon mocking Texas families who lost loved ones in a tragedy, just because they might’ve voted Republican. Twisted, vile, and shameful. They owe those families an apology and should pull this filth immediately.\" \"DISGRACE: @TheBuffaloNews runs a VILE cartoon by artist Adam Zyglis, appearing to mock Texas families affected by the floods because they voted for Trump,\" Libs of TikTok wrote.

The source added that the notion of it being a romance is 'ridiculous.'\n\n Night Sofia Vergara and Tom Brady got cozy on the newest elite superyacht: Tickets cost $78,000 \nThe pair are both single following Sofia's divorce from Joe Manganiello in 2024, and Tom's split from supermodel ex Gisele in 2022. \nSofia and the former New England Patriots quarterback enjoyed a star-studded trip on the Luminara superyacht, and were joined by A-list guests including Naomi Campbell, Kendall Jenner, Kate Hudson, Martha Stewart, and Colman Domingo. \nIrina Shayk, who was previously linked to Brady, was also aboard according to the source. \nSetting sail from Rome, the two-night luxury cruise included drone shows and performances from Ellie Goulding, Sting, and Janelle Monáe. \nVergara even shared a photo of her and Brady seated together at a dinner. \nIn the snap, J Balvin was pictured greeting her by giving her a kiss on the forehead. \n\nGisele Bündchen's ex-husband even reportedly asked to switch seats with another guest so he could be next to the Colombian bombshell at one of the dinners aboard the yacht, according to page Six\n\n'He asked to switch seats to sit next to her at dinner,' an insider told the publication; Sofia seen in a photo from the superyacht\n\nThe two have reportedly continued spending time together after the trip, with a source describing their relationship to Page Six as a 'summer romance'\nAnother photo from the trip showed Sofia with Ricky Martin on the 790-foot superyacht, which hosted 450 VIPs. \nFollowing the voyage, the two have reportedly been spending time together in Ibiza. \nThe Luminara comes replete with 226 suites to accommodate a maximum of 452 guests. There are also five restaurants, seven bars, a wine vault, two swimming pools and a spa.\nMore than 700 art pieces decorate the ship, including works by Andy Warhol and David Hockney — and, in those five restaurants, there are menus from two James Beard Award-winning chefs, Fabio Trabocchi and Michael Mina.\nCruise tickets start at $11,900 for seven nights — while guests in the most lavish suites can expect to cough up as much as $78,000.\nVergara has been sharing sexy summer posts including photos of her rocking a bright Walmart bikini and videos of her dancing to Calvin Harris's music. \nOn Wednesday she showed off her booty in a new image shared to her Insta Stories. The star was modeling a multi-colored one-piece swimsuit while enjoying her vacation in Ibiza.\nLast month Sofia gave an insight into what she's looking for in her next relationship, saying she wants her next boyfriend to be as rich as she is.\n\nVergara has been sharing sexy summer bikini posts to her Instagram, including one of her sunbathing topless\nShe admitted that she needs 'fun in [her] life' - but she isn't interested in dating someone who isn't financially independent.\nAsked what she is looking for in her next relationship, Sofia said on the Today show: 'I want to say the basic stuff, like health and somebody that loves me. And somebody tall, handsome.'\n'I want somebody that has as much money as me or more, because if not, it's a nightmare. They end up resenting you.' \nThe Hollywood star - who was married to actor Joe between 2015 and 2024 - shared: 'I've been single now for a year and a half, and I kind of panicked once I got divorced. I was like, \"I'm 52, what's gonna happen? Where am I going to find [someone]?\"'\nDespite this, Sofia is still in no rush to find love. She said: 'I'm not really in a hurry anymore.'\nLast year, Sofia claimed that she can't be too 'picky' about who she dates.\nThe brunette beauty finalized her split from Joe in 2024, but she remains open to the idea of dating another celebrity.\nSofia told People: 'I mean, it's already hard for a 50-something-year-old woman to find someone. I'm not going to be now picky about, \"Oh, he can only be a doctor. Oh, he can only be an astronaut.\" No, I mean, I'm not that picky.'\nMeanwhile Brady recently sparked rumors of a possible romance with Hollywood star Sydney Sweeney, with reports claiming the pair danced together during Jeff Bezos and Lauren Sanchez's wedding festivities in Venice.\nTMZ also claimed that he was 'chatting up' Sweeney at the hotel bar.\nBrady also enjoyed a day out with actors Orlando Bloom and Leonard Di Caprio in Venice, with the three seen sipping on cocktails poolside.\nBrady and Bloom were also pictured wandering the streets of Venice alongside Sweeney, with the White Lotus star described as the 'most sought after person' at the party.\n'Everyone wants to talk to her and every guy that has been in her presence has talked about how stunning she is in real life,' a source said.\nShe and Brady sent social media into meltdown after reports suggested they struck up a possible romance.\n\nTom separated from ex-wife Gisele, 44, with whom he has children Vivian, 12, and Benjamin, 15, in 2022 after 13 years; The exes seen in 2018\nBut a source claimed the former quarterback 'danced with everyone' at the wedding - not just Sweeney but also model Brooks Nader, to whom he was briefly linked last year.\nBrady got an invite to the wedding because the former quarterback and Amazon billionaire Bezos are believed to have grown close over the past few years, having become neighbors at Indian Creek in Miami.\nBrady has three children: 15-year-old Benjamin and 12-year-old Vivian with ex-wife Gisele, and 17-year-old Jack with actress Bridget Moynahan. \nMeanwhile Sofia is mom to son Manolo, 33, whom she shares with ex Joe Gonzalez. \nSofia VergaraTom BradySpain\n\nShare or comment on this article: \nSofia Vergara and Tom Brady enjoying a 'summer romance' in Spain after getting cozy on elite superyacht\n\nAdd comment\n\n Share what you think\n\nWorst rated\n\nThe comments below have not been moderated.\n\nThe views expressed in the contents above are those of our users and do not necessarily reflect the views of MailOnline.\n\nAdd your comment\n\nEnter your comment\n\nBy posting your comment you agree to our house rules.\n\nSubmit Comment\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual.\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual\n\nWe will automatically post your comment and a link to the news story to your Facebook timeline at the same time it is posted on MailOnline.

Email tips@dailymail.com \nBy KATIE HIND FOR MAILONLINE \n Published:01:13 BST, 10 July 2025 |Updated:01:13 BST, 10 July 2025 \n\nIt's the day that has always brought joy to the Beckham family.\nBut when Harper celebrates her birthday tomorrow there will be dark cloud hanging over it because her parents David and Victoria have no idea whether her beloved eldest brother Brooklyn will be in touch to send his best wishes on her big day as she turns 14 amid the rift that has torn the family apart.\nSources close to the family have told MailOnline of their fears that Brooklyn, 26, and his wife Nicola, 30, have also distanced themselves from Harper after they failed to visit her when they flew into London in May to film an advert for French-Italian clothing brand Moncler just over a mile from the family home in Holland Park.\nDavid and Victoria have no idea whether Brooklyn, who Harper has idolised since she was a little girl, will message her privately or publicly on Instagram because they have no communication with him.\nIt comes as tensions have continued to bubble in the past few weeks with a series of digs and jibes from camp Nicola and Brooklyn. \nOn Wednesday aspiring chef Brooklyn shared a cooking video accompanied by a song which referred to not feeling like he has the confidence to speak up and finally feeling empowered - in a seemingly subtle but defiant message. \nAnd on the same day Nicola made a bizarre nod to father-in-law David Beckham as she sported a replica pair of the iconic football shorts he wore for his England debut in the 90s while out on her family's superyacht.\n\nWhen Harper Beckham celebrates her birthday there will be dark cloud hanging over it because her parents David and Victoria have no idea whether her beloved eldest brother Brooklyn will be in touch to send his best wishes \n\nDavid and Victoria have no idea whether Brooklyn will message her privately or publicly on Instagram because they have no communication with him\nShe was also keen to flaunt her close family bonds during the holiday to St Tropez as she shared gushing Instagram posts about her brothers on Monday.\nNicola continued to publicly praise and share admiration for her billionaire family on social media amid her husband's family feud. \nThe actress took to Instagram to share a series of photographs in which she gushed over her billionaire father Nelson Peltz and joked that her Labubu dolls were her family. \nThat came after she and Brooklyn shared photographs of themselves on social media attending Nelson's family birthday celebrations - painfully echoing the very similar celebrations they chose to snub for David's own recent birthday.\nAnd amid the escalating feud last week Romeo stepped in as he shared a very pointed statement about 'appreciating people that love you' and insisted 'life was too short' to not tell people you care about them. \nWhile Nicola revels in her happy life with her family, Brooklyn risks ruining his 'close bond' with sister Harper by overshadowing her birthday.\nShould Brooklyn not message, friends of the Beckhams predict that it will be a 'huge moment' in the feud, which escalated when the couple didn't attend any of David's 50th celebrations which took place between the end of March and the beginning of May.\nOne source said: 'Brooklyn and Harper used to be inseparable. He adored her, he hopefully still does, but the problem is that Brooklyn has a track record for ignoring family birthdays now.\n'It would be devastating for Harper not to hear from him. She hasn't done anything and she's only 13-years-old, she is the innocent party here. \n'Harper's birthday has always been such a happy day, she's the adored little daughter so it's always so joyous but this is a tough situation.\n\nSources close to the family have told MailOnline of their fears that Brooklyn, 26, and his wife Nicola, 30, have also ditched Harper\n\nShould Brooklyn not message, friends of the Beckhams predict that it will be a 'huge moment' in the feud (pictured in 2024) \n\nIt comes as tensions have continued to bubble in the past few weeks with a series of digs and jibes from camp Nicola and Brooklyn \n'Brooklyn was 12 when Harper was born, he was so important in her life and it must be terribly sad that she isn't seeing him since the fall out with David and Victoria happened.\n'David and Victoria very much blame Nicola for all of this but hopefully Brooklyn will see sense.\n'While Harper doesn't have her own Instagram yet, the family thing is to tag her in on their posts as #harperseven.'\nAt the start of her relationship with Brooklyn, Nicola seemed to forge a strong bond with Harper. The actress soon positioned herself as a 'big sister' figure to the little girl, who is aid to have 'adored' her.\nBut now the couple, who married in April 2022 at her family's £76million Florida mansion, no longer speak to Sir David and Lady Beckham, with the couple believing that she controls Brooklyn.\nPosh and Becks were furious when the couple didn't contact Harper when they visited London just weeks after David's birthday. \nAt the time they were also cross that they didn't get in touch with Cruz, 19, either because at that point he and Brooklyn had never had a crossed word. \nSince then the singer has very much come out on his parents' side amid the rift.\nDespite ignoring his father's birthday and his mum Victoria's two weeks before in April, Brooklyn did take to Instagram to wish the footballer's mum Sandra a happy birthday two weeks ago. \nHowever, Victoria was devastated when he didn't do the same for her father Tony back in May.\nLast week, Nicola addressed speculation that she was 'controlling' Brooklyn after posting snaps with her family and Brooklyn celebrating her father Nelson's 83rd birthday on the European getaway.\n\n Who's wearing the shorts now, David? Nicola Peltz brazenly poses in a replica of Beckham's famous 1996 England debut football kit aboard yacht after denying she 'controlled' husband Brooklyn amid family feud \nThe celebratory photos were the latest blow for David and Victoria, after Brooklyn snubbed his own dad's 50th birthday - with many flooding the comment section to accuse Nicola of being to blame.\nYet she hit back by 'liking' a fan's comment that suggested Brooklyn had made his own decision. \nThe comment read: 'The fact people are in this comment section talking bs about someone controlling a GROWN man is absurd. The guy is an adult and can make his own decisions, leave them be and stop blaming women for everything.'\nAmid his escalating feud with his family, the pair failed to publicly acknowledge David's milestone 50th birthday on May 8. \nDavid and Victoria's 26th wedding anniversary also passed without mention, despite the former Manchester United and England footballer referencing Brooklyn in his own post.\nDavid previously thanked wife Victoria for their 'beautiful children' as the couple both acknowledged estranged son Brooklyn while celebrating their anniversary on July 4.\nThe former footballer who also shares sons Romeo, 20, and Cruz, 22 with the ex Spice Girl shared a series of throwback snaps of the family in happier times.\nDeclaring his love for Victoria, who he referred to as Lady Beckham following his Knighthood, he wrote: '26 years today you said YES to me Happy Anniversary and thank you for giving me our beautiful children and building the life that we have together.' \nHe went on to tag his children including estranged son Brooklyn.\nVictoria, 51, also tagged her eldest son, captioning her post: 'Another year, another chapter in our love story. \n'I'm so proud of the beautiful family and life we've built together. You and our four incredible children complete me. I love you so much @davidbeckham. Here's to 26 years!!' \nDespite the apparent olive branch, insiders believe Brooklyn will not be in attendance when Harper turns 14.\nRumours of a rift between the eldest son and his parents began when Brooklyn was noticeably silent on his former Spice Girl mother's birthday, a far cry from his usual sweet posts about her.\nNeither the former photographer nor his wife wished Victoria a happy 51st, while David, Romeo and Cruz posted gushing messages.\nAnd as well as snubbing dad David's birthday online, he also was notably absent from all of his 50th birthday celebrations - including a boys' fishing trip. \n\nDavid and Victoria seen with their children Brooklyn, Romeo, Cruz and Harper last year before family feud\n\nAccording to sources, Nicola was like a 'big sister' to Harper (seen together) before falling out with her parents \n\nIt comes as on Wednesday Nicola made a bizarre nod to father-in-law David Beckham as she sported a pair of his football shorts while out on her family's superyacht\n\nOne source said: 'Brooklyn and Harper used to be inseparable. He adored her, he hopefully still does, but the problem is that Brooklyn has a track record for ignoring family birthdays now'\n\nThe actress also continued to publicly praise and share admiration for her billionaire family on social media amid her husband's family feud\n\nDespite flying to London at the time, Brooklyn and Nicola also didn't attend the big family party at the Beckhams' Cotswolds home or an idyllic trip to France or a meal at Notting Hill restaurant, Core. \nBrooklyn reportedly 'told his famous family that he wants no contact' with them last month in the latest devastating turn of their ongoing feud. \nAccording to reports, the eldest Beckham boy has had no communication with his family following father David's knighthood being announced last month and only learned of the news in the media alongside the rest of the world.\nDenying he'd asked for no contact, a source close to Brooklyn told the publication: 'Everyone's focus should be David Beckham's great honour'.\nMeanwhile a source close to Brooklyn also denied the claims as they told MailOnline, 'this seems to be another deliberate attempt to misrepresent the truth, and it only serves to distract from this honor being bestowed on Brooklyn's father.'\nInstagramLondon\n\nShare or comment on this article: \nThe watershed moment in the explosive Beckham feud: Dark cloud hangs over Harper's 14th birthday amid uncertainty over whether Brooklyn will send his best wishes amid family tensions\n\nAdd comment\n\n Share what you think\n\nNo comments have so far been submitted.

The memo added that no further evidence would be released related to the case.\n\nPresident Donald Trump scoffed at the ongoing interest in Epstein during a Cabinet meeting Tuesday when Attorney General Pam Bondi was asked about the investigation’s findings. Bondi previously said officials were reviewing a “truckload” of evidence that was previously withheld.\n\nTrump said, “Are you still talking about Jeffrey Epstein? This guy’s been talked about for years. I can’t believe you’re asking a question on Epstein at a time like this, where we’re having some of the greatest success and also tragedy with what happened in Texas it just seems like a desecration.”\n\nNonetheless, the conclusion of the Epstein federal investigation has resulted in criticism from the MAGA elite.\n\n“The American people deserve to know truth ref. Epstein, regardless of who it impacts,” Rep. Anna Paulina Luna, R-Fla., said Tuesday in a post on the social media platform X.\n\nMegyn Kelly responded on her podcast to Trump’s remarks, saying, “Good grief! That was no bueno, guys! That was no bueno, OK? President Trump had the same problem there that Karoline Leavitt had yesterday. The dodge should not be obvious. It should be subtle. It should be deftly worked into a more substantive answer.”\n\nElon Musk, who has recently become a vocal critic of the president, wrote on X, “How can people be expected to have faith in Trump if he won’t release the Epstein files?”\n\nTrump’s attorney general under fire after Epstein’s ‘client list’ announcement\n\nThe pressure has been ramped up on Bondi following the DOJ’s memo stating there was no “client list.”\n\nPrior to Monday’s announcement, Bondi had stated such a list was “sitting on her desk” in response to the first phase of the Trump administration’s release of the Epstein files. \n\nConservative host Liz Wheeler, who received a binder labeled “The Epstein Files: Phase 1” from Bondi at the White House, said Tuesday on ’s “CUOMO” that the list was never on the attorney general’s desk. \n\n“Pam Bondi has become a liability to him (Trump) because people care about this story, they care, not so much because they care about the Epstein list itself, but because they care about justice,” Wheeler said. “That’s what they voted for, they voted for justice, they voted for transparency, and they’re not getting either of those things with an unforced error from Pam Bondi.”\n\nThe source close to the White House lamented that the “attorney general should have the courage to address these questions herself, or she will never retain an ounce of credibility again.”\n\nAfter publication, the FBI and DOJ told they stood by the Epstein investigation memo released Monday. \n\n“The DOJ and FBI reviewed the Epstein Files and reached the conclusion set out in the July 6th memo. Nothing in the files warranted further investigation or prosecution,” Bondi and Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche told in a joint statement.\n\n“The memo released on July 6th is consistent with the thorough review conducted by the FBI and DOJ. The criminal leakers and Fake News media tries tirelessly to undermine President Trump with smears and lies, and this story is no different,” FBI Director Kash Patel said in a provided statement to .\n\nHow the DOJ, FBI can hide information from the public: Former special agent\n\nOn Monday, a source close to the White House told that “the DOJ holds the keys to what’s under seal in this case, and so far, they’ve refused to unlock the truth. … If she (Bondi) has nothing to hide, she should explain why she still hasn’t unsealed the documents she’s sitting on at the DOJ.”\n\nJonathan Gilliam, former Navy SEAL and FBI special agent, told there are ways the DOJ and FBI can hide information from the public and the courts. \n\nHe says that typically, the DOJ makes decisions about sealing documents from the public, usually signed off on by a judge, while the FBI can classify intelligence.\n\n“With this structure in mind, there are places that information can be hidden under seal or classification from (the Freedom of Information Act) without anyone outside of a particular investigation ever knowing,” Gilliam said. \n\nWhile most of the time it’s used ethically, there are situations where information could be hidden away from anyone not “read in” on the case, he said. \n\n“Public corruption cases can fall into this black hole, and oddly, be treated like national security intelligence,” Gilliam said. “When that happens, only the people with access to that case will know that information is there, and if someone doesn’t have access, they won’t be able to see it even if they tried.”","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nEditor’s Note: This story contains discussions of rape or sexual assault that&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Source Reveals FBI Director Wanted to Release Epstein Files Months Sooner first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/local-news/source-reveals-fbi-director-wanted-to-release-epstein-files-months-sooner/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/rewrite-this-title-FBI-will-release-video-of-Jeffrey-Epstein039s.jpeg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-07-10 00:11:29","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.609},{"id":340036528,"title":"Trump slaps 50% tariff on Brazil as punishment for 'witch hunt' trial against ex-president Jair Bolsonaro","text":"President Donald Trump has hit Brazil with a 50 percent import tariff on 'any and all' goods sent to the United States as punishment for the 'witch hunt' trial against former president Jair Bolsonaro.\n\nTrump fired off a furious letter to Brazilian President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva on Wednesday laying out the details of his new tariff.\n\n'The way that Brazil has treated former President Bosonaro, a Highly Respected Leader throughout the world... is an international disgrace,' Trump wrote in the letter, which he shared to Truth Social.\n\nBosonaro is on trial accused of trying to overturn his 2022 election loss. He testified in June before the country's Supreme Court over his alleged plot to remain in power despite losing the vote. \n\nBolsonaro has already been barred from from running for office until 2030 by the country's electoral authorities. \n\n'This Trial should not be taking place. It is a Witch Hunt that should end IMMEDIATELY!' \n\nTrump has described Bolsonaro as a friend and hosted the former Brazilian president at his Mar-a-Lago resort when both were in power in 2020.\n\nThe president said his whopping tariff was also in part a response to Brazil's 'insidious attacks on Free Elections and the Fundamental Free Speech rights of Americans.' \n\nHe said a decision by Brazil's Supreme Court to fine and temporarily block US social media companies last year amounted to 'SECRET and UNLAWFUL Censorship Orders.' \n\nTrump said he is launching an investigation as a result under Section 301 of the Trade Act of 1974, which applies to countries with trade practices that are deemed unfair to U.S. companies.\n\n'Starting August 1, we will charge Brazil a tariff of 50 percent on any and all Brazilian products sent into the United States, separate from all Sectoral tariffs. \n\n'Goods transshipped to evade this 50 percent tariff will be subject to that higher tariff,' he warned.\n\nTrump described the current trade relationship between America and Brazil as 'very unfair' and 'far from reciprocal.'\n\n'Please understand that the 50 percent number is far less than what is needed to have the Level Playing Field we must have with your country.' \n\nBrazil's vice president, Geraldo Alckmin, said he sees 'no reason' for the US to hike tariffs on the South American nation.\n\n'I think he has been misinformed,' he said. 'President Lula was jailed for almost two years. No one questioned the judiciary. No one questioned what the country had done. This is a matter for our judiciary branch.'\n\nTrump, too, was indicted in 2023 for his efforts to overturn the results of the 2020 US presidential election. \n\nWhile Trump has said the high tariff rates he's setting are based on trade imbalances, it was unclear by his Wednesday actions how the countries being targeted would help to reindustrialize America.\n\nThe tariffs starting August 1 would be a dramatic increase from the 10 percent rate that Trump levied on Brazil as part of his April 2 'Liberation Day' announcement. \n\nIn addition to oil, Brazil sells orange juice, coffee, iron and steel to the US, among other products. \n\nThe US ran a $6.8 billion trade surplus with Brazil last year, according to the Census Bureau.\n\nTrump initially announced his broad tariffs by declaring an economic emergency, arguing under a 1977 law that the US was at risk because of persistent trade imbalances. \n\nBut that rationale becomes murky in this particular case, as Trump is linking his tariffs to the Bolsonaro trial and the US exports more to Brazil than it imports.\n\nTrump also sent letters Wednesday to the leaders of seven other nations - the Philippines, Brunei, Moldova, Algeria, Libya, Iraq and Sri Lanka.\n\nMost economic analyses say the tariffs will worsen inflationary pressures and subtract from economic growth, but Trump has used the taxes as a way to assert the diplomatic and financial power of the US on both rivals and allies. \n\nHis administration is promising that the taxes on imports will lower trade imbalances, offset some of the cost of the tax cuts he signed into law on Friday as part of the Big Beautiful Bill and cause factory jobs to return to the United States.\n\n'We really haven't had too many complaints because I'm keeping them at a very low number, very conservative as you would say,' Trump said.\n\nOfficials for the European Union, a major trade partner and source of Trump's ire on trade, said Tuesday that they are not expecting to receive a letter from Trump listing tariff rates. \n\nThe president started the process of announcing tariff rates on Monday by hitting two major US trading partners, Japan and South Korea, with import taxes of 25 percent.\n\nThe letters were posted on Truth Social after the expiration of a 90-day negotiating period with a baseline levy of 10 percent.\n\nTrump is giving countries more time to negotiate with his August 1 deadline, but he has insisted there will be no extensions for the countries that receive letters.\n\nThe president threatened additional tariffs on any country that attempts to retaliate.","summary":"Trump fired off a furious letter to Brazilian President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva on Wednesday laying out the details of his new tariff.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-14891561/trump-brazil-tariff-50-percent-witch-hunt-trial-jair-bolsonaro.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/07/10/00/100170011-0-image-a-81_1752105163272.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-07-10 00:09:59","author":"Brittany Chain,Editor","authors":["Brittany Chain","Editor"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.009},{"id":340037550,"title":"That $20 dress direct from China now costs $30 after Trump closed a tariff loophole – and the US will soon end the ‘de minimis’ exemption for the rest of the world, too","text":"Fast fashion got a lot pricier for Americans this spring – and it’ll likely get even more expensive in 2027.\n\nThat’s because the Trump administration has been rolling back a little-known feature of U.S. customs law that for years had allowed retailers to ship packages duty-free to U.S. shoppers – as long as each shipment was valued under US$800. Known as the “de minimis” exception, this rule had helped keep prices low on Chinese e-commerce platforms such as Shein and Temu, boosting their popularity with American shoppers.\n\nBut as of May 2, 2025, that advantage disappeared – at least for China and Hong Kong. That’s when the U.S. officially eliminated the exemption for low-priced imports from those places. Suddenly, cheap fashion wasn’t so cheap anymore – and demand for Shein and Temu plummeted. \n\nBut while bargain hunters might hope for workarounds by ordering from platforms based in Vietnam or elsewhere, that’s a temporary fix. The exemption is set to be eliminated for all countries in 2027, thanks to language in the tax and spending bill just signed into law.\n\nBut hold up – what’s “de minimis,” anyway?\n\nCheap dresses and ‘petty matters’\n\nI’m a professsor of marketing who’s long been interested in this loophole. De minimis is short for de minimis non curat lex, which means, “The law does not concern itself with petty matters.” In trade terms, the de minimis exemption refers to a value threshold below which imports can enter a country without duties. Imagine the government saying, “It’s so cheap we won’t even bother with it.” \n\nThe de minimis exemption was introduced as part of the Tariff Act of 1930 and was initially set at $200. It stayed at that level until 2016, when the U.S. bumped it up to $800. Raising the limit helped small companies as well as individual shoppers, and from 2016 to 2023 de minimis shipments skyrocketed – rising sixfold to more than 1 billion annually.\n\nBut it left large companies, which import items in bulk, at a disadvantage. That’s one reason why, historically, the same dress might cost more money in a U.S. retail store than it would if you bought it online from an e-commerce company.\n\nA case study: Your $20 Shein dress\n\nImagine it’s January 2025. You’re scrolling Shein, and you spot a trendy dress priced at $20. You order the dress to be delivered to your home. The seller packs your dress and exports it to your home address. The package arrives at the U.S. border. Because the package’s “value” – specifically, the price you paid – is below the U.S. “de minimis” threshold of $800, the U.S. Customs and Border Protection exempts the importer – that is, you – from paying any import duty. You pay just $20.\n\nNow imagine you’re trying to order the same dress in mid-July.\n\nExecutive Order 14256, issued on April 2, states that such an item, if shipped via international mail from China or Hong Kong, could be subject to an ad valorem duty of up to 20% of the item’s value, or a specific dollar amount per package, which could be $100 or more. This was increased to 30% on April 8 and 84% the following day. In the most recent modification, dated May 12, the percentage has been revised to 54%. \n\nSo, using the 54% ad valorem duty as an example, the import tariff on your $20 dress would be $10.80 – costing you $30.80 in all. Of course, the May 12 modification comes with the usual disclaimer: It will stay in effect “unless and until otherwise modified by a subsequent executive action.” \n\nFor millions of American shoppers, this is a wake-up call: Formerly tax-free fast fashion is now significantly more expensive. Thrifty shoppers might be tempted to buy from sellers in India or Mexico, where the de minimis exemption is still in effect — at least for now. The One Big Beautiful Bill Act ends the de minimis exemption globally starting July 1, 2027.\n\nTrade policy has been unpredictable under President Donald Trump, and the de minimis rule has been no exception. But with the global end of the exemption now written into law, its future seems a little more certain. Although it’s always wise to watch for new developments from the White House, I suspect the U.S. de minimis exemption may soon be a thing of the past.","summary":"New trade barriers are set to go into effect in July 2027.","url":"https://theconversation.com/that-20-dress-direct-from-china-now-costs-30-after-trump-closed-a-tariff-loophole-and-the-us-will-soon-end-the-de-minimis-exemption-for-the-rest-of-the-world-too-260675","image":"https://images.theconversation.com/files/679224/original/file-20250709-64-lugp42.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&rect=0%2C527%2C5486%2C2743&q=45&auto=format&w=1356&h=668&fit=crop","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-07-10 00:08:36","author":"Associate Professor of Quantitative Marketing and Analytics,McGill University,Vivek Astvansh","authors":["Associate Professor of Quantitative Marketing and Analytics","McGill University","Vivek Astvansh"],"language":"en","source_country":"AU","sentiment":-0.231},{"id":340036532,"title":"Dangerous MS-13 gang kingpin wanted for FIVE murders is caught by ICE hiding out in US city","text":"Federal immigration officers arrested an alleged MS-13 kingpin and his associate on Wednesday in Omaha, Nebraska.\n\nThe alleged kingpin is on El Salvador's 'Top 100 Most Wanted List' but his name is not yet being released by authorities to not jeopardize an ongoing investigation, Fox News first reported.\n\nHe is wanted by the Salvadoran government for the 'aggravated homicide of five victims, attempted aggravated homicide, deprivation of liberty and terrorist organization affiliation,' according to Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE).\n\nICE also said it arrested another 'MS-13 gang member and foreign terrorist' named Rene Saul Escobar Ochoa, 30.\n\nOchoa, who reportedly lived with the alleged kingpin in Omaha, is wanted for allegedly 'giving orders' to other gang members to commit murder and drug trafficking.\n\nTwo separate videos, both obtained by Fox News, show each man getting taken into custody.\n\nThe first video shows the alleged kingpin getting ordered out of his car and slowly backing up towards officers with Homeland Security and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives (ATF). He is then put in handcuffs without incident.\n\nThe second video shows Ochoa wearing ankle shackles and being escorted into a detention facility by two law enforcement officers.\n\nBoth men were living illegally in the US, according to ICE. Further, the agency claimed the arrests were a 'targeted enforcement action' of suspects who posed a 'serious threat' to the Omaha area.\n\n'These illegal aliens didn’t just sneak into our country, they brought with them a legacy of violence, terror, and death,' said Mark Zito, ICE Homeland Security Investigations Special Agent in Charge of Kansas City.\n\n'They thought they could hide in America’s heartland, but they were sadly mistaken, not on our watch,' Zito added.\n\nDaily Mail approached ICE for additional comment. \n\nActing ICE Director Todd M. Lyons also released statement following these arrests, seeking to drive home a point immigration law enforcement officials have been making for months.\n\n'When ICE agents move in to make an arrest, it is extremely important that the public not interfere,' Lyons said.\n\n'The misinformation, and sometimes blatant lies, being spread around the country could result in someone stepping into a federal operation and suddenly finding themselves face-to-face with a killer who has nothing to lose,' he added.\n\n'Our ICE officers and agents are protecting your neighborhoods, even when you don’t know the threat is there, so either support them, or get out of the way,' he concluded.\n\nLyons was likely referring to pockets of the country where residents have been protesting outside areas where ICE officers are trying to make arrests.\n\nThis phenomenon was most pronounced in downtown Los Angeles, which saw about six days of sustaining protesting and rioting starting on June 7.\n\nBy June 9, the city had descended into utter chaos, with a van seen plowing into crowds, protesters torching cars and journalists being shot with rubber bullets by police.\n\nPresident Donald Trump responded with a heavy hand and was criticized by Democrats from California and the nation as a whole. \n\nOn June 7, he federalized the California National Guard and deployed 2,000 members to the city. \n\nOn June 9, he deployed a 2,000 more national guard members and sent 700 Marines, who arrived the next day.\n\nBy June 12, the riots had largely fizzled out, but Los Angeles has seen a number of isolated protests in the weeks since, including one at Dodger Stadium.","summary":"Federal immigration officers arrested an alleged MS-13 kingpin and his potential associate on Wednesday.

Well, it seems many may have buyer’s remorse or ‘Bregret’ over the decision. \n\nSince late July 2022, the share of people who regret Brexit in surveys has consistently been above 50%. As of May 2025, 56% of people in Great Britain believed it was wrong to leave the European Union, compared with 32% who thought it was the right decision. \n\nJust when we thought things could not get any worse, the American electorate and Donald Trump said ‘Hold my beer’. Even the most pessimistic person could not have been ready for the vengeful gutting of scientific and educational standards, contempt for the law and disdain for facts and the truth during the second Trump term.\n\nBut like most right-wingers, Trump seems to hold a special contempt for the environment and any person or body protecting the environment. \n\nHe has launched more attacks on the environment in 100 days than his entire first term — hitting protections for land, oceans, forests, wildlife and climate. \n\nBut lest we get complacent and superior over on this side of the water, it looks like those in charge in Europe and Ireland are just as willing to ignore experts and academics when it suits them, and particularly when it comes to the environment.\n\nRecently, the European Parliament voted to lower the protection status of wolves under the Habitats Directive — with no sound scientific basis. This proposal was a politically motivated U-turn away from science-based conservation. \n\nIreland’s own experts in the National Parks and Wildlife Service (NPWS) advised against supporting it, as the wolf remains in an unfavourable conservation status in six out of seven biogeographical regions in Europe. \n\nA data-driven reassessment of the species conservation status is due later this year, and the NPWS concluded any change to the species protected status before then was premature.\n\nFine Gael MEP Regina Doherty was quoted as saying: “A high wolf population can be a threat to biodiversity conservation, farmers, rural communities and tourism.” \n\nIn fact, wolves play a crucial role in maintaining healthy ecosystems and biodiversity by regulating prey populations, which can lead to a more balanced and diverse ecosystem, the reintroduction of wolves to Yellowstone National Park in 1995 being just one example.\n\nAs for the threat to farmers and rural communities, it seems MEPs could have appraised themselves of some studies before they made their decision.\n\nWolf predation represents a very small fraction of total livestock losses, according to nature strategist Kriton Arsenis. \n\nIn a LinkedIn post, he referenced a peer-reviewed study from Poland which found grey wolves avoid eating farm animals — even when thousands roam unprotected. \n\nIn an area where more than 4,000 cattle and 700 horses graze freely each year, scientists found over a two-year period:\n\n Only three cattle calves were consumed by wolves;\n No horse attacks were recorded;\n Livestock made up just 3% of the wolf diet — and even that was likely scavenged — meaning wolves fed on animals that were already dead;\n Instead, wolves fed mainly on wild prey — roe deer and wild boar made up over 80% of their diet.\n\nAnd then there’s the effect on tourism — but not in the way that Ms Doherty thinks. Nature and wildlife tourism is a growing market. \n\nWildlife tourism centred around wolves is growing across Europe, with organisers highlighting its value for both conservation and rural revitalisation.\n\nAnd it’s more profitable than killing wolves. There are already areas with wolves that make 10 times more money organising sightseeing tours than for shooting them, according to the Wilderness Society. \n\nMany people may not care about wolves. But if we allow these laws to unravel without any evidence or expertise taken into account, what’s next. And we in Ireland are not immune from ignoring or threatening to ignore expert and scientific advice, particularly in relation to the environment.\n\n“About the dumbest thing we can do” from the point of view of climate action were the words of Peter Thorne, a professor of climate change at Maynooth University in response to forestry minister Michael Healy-Rae’s suggestion to allow forestry on peatlands, which would be a reversal of Government policy, which prohibits afforestation on deep peat.\n\nThe Irish Peatland Conservation Council warned such actions would have severe environmental consequences and undermine Ireland’s commitments to biodiversity and climate action. \n\nPeatlands are one of Ireland’s most valuable ecosystems, serving as critical carbon sinks, supporting unique biodiversity, and regulating water quality.\n\nScientific research has repeatedly shown afforestation on peatlands disrupts their natural hydrology, accelerates carbon release, and damages habitats essential for rare and endangered species. \n\nOf course, the minister’s suggestion is cloaked in a faux argument that if you don’t plant forestry in bogs, the only other option is to import them: a Sophie’s Choice of tree planting. You should always be wary when you’re offered a binary choice to a complex problem.\n\nMore recently, concerns have been raised over Government plans which will lower protections for rivers and lakes by labelling them “heavily modified water bodies”. \n\nSustainable Water Network chief executive Sinéad O’Brien said the Government’s plan to lower protections for one in 10 of our rivers, lakes, and coastal waters, without evidence or proper explanation, shows disregard for the public.\n\nThis is all starting to sound familiar.\n\nWe need experts, academics and scientists to help us make decisions based on the best knowledge, information, evidence and science available. \n\nThe laws of science and nature do not really care about your political affiliations, party policy or whether you think the world is flat — they just carry on regardless. \n\nThey can’t just be discarded on a whim or because the political wind has changed direction. And you ignore them at your peril, as we’re finding out with our changing climate.","summary":"When it comes to climate change and biodiversity, we ignore scientists and academics at our peril, writes Ciaran Brennan","url":"https://www.irishexaminer.com/opinion/commentanalysis/arid-41666558.html","image":"https://www.irishexaminer.com/cms_media/module_img/9393/4696919_19_seoimage1x1_DSC_8367.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-07-10 00:05:00","author":"Ciaran Brennan,Irishexaminer.com","authors":["Ciaran Brennan","Irishexaminer.com"],"language":"en","source_country":"ie","sentiment":0.12},{"id":340046790,"title":"RFK Jr. fails to solve yet another MAGA conspiracy","text":"Live by the conspiracy theory, die by the conspiracy theory. \n\nAs the MAGA world implodes over its failed Epstein list obsession—maybe because President Donald Trump is on it—let’s not forget another unhinged conspiracy it promised to solve: chemtrails.\n\nYes, chemtrails.\n\nLast August, Health and Human Services Secretary and full-time conspiracy theorist Robert F.

Editing him out is not an option.\n'Either way it’s a major headache for the BBC, and would be a final crushing blow for Gregg.'\nMailOnline has contacted representatives for the BBC and Gregg Wallace for comment. \nIt comes as the BBC received 50 new claims over the TV presenter, including allegations he pulled his trousers down in front of one worker on the show and groped another.\nSources are also claiming that Gregg is considering taking the BBC, or Masterchef's production company Banijay to a tribunal, and is ready to declare 'war' on bosses over his sacking.\nGregg has also reportedly taken on the 'rottweiler' lawyer Dan Morrison, who represented Nigel Farage in the NatWest/Coutts bank account closure scandal.\nIt's thought that Gregg's lawyers could push for the release of the report's executive summary, which might jeopardise senior MasterChef executives and talent.\nDuring the misconduct probe, in two categories — 'demeaning' nicknames for staff and Wallace being 'direct' with contestants — investigators said Gregg's actions were unintentional. \n\nBefore the probe was launched, Gregg had completed filming new episodes of MasterChef, which have been shelved\n\nA source told The Sun , that bosses need to make a decision on the series as they have 'contributors to consider'\nGregg's autism diagnosis was also reportedly used to explain some behaviour, and some allegations in the probe have been upheld. \nThese include the star opening his dressing room door with a sock over his manhood, before shouting: 'Hooray.'\nDue to the BBC's cost-cutting measures, it's been deemed unlikely that Gregg will receive any or redundancy package, but he could land a six-figure payout from a tribunal in his favour.\nOn Tuesday, Gregg released a statement ahead of the investigation into his misconduct allegations being published later this week.\nWallace denies the claims and has condemned the corporation in a scathing social media post saying he had been cleared of 'the most serious and sensational accusations'.\n\n Shamed Masterchef star Gregg Wallace shares reflective post featuring his rarely seen wife Anna \nBut fresh claims come from people who say they encountered him across a range of shows with the majority alleging he made inappropriate sexual comments towards them, according to BBC News.\nOut of the 50 allegations, 11 women have accused him of inappropriate sexual behaviour, such as groping and touching.\nOne woman described Wallace's behaviour 'disgusting and predatory' saying he pulled his trousers down in front of her in a dressing room.\nWhile another said she was left feeling 'absolutely horrified' when he groped her.\nOne participant on the BBC's Saturday Kitchen claims during filming in 2002, Wallace put his hand under the table and onto her groin, before asking her: 'Do you like that?'\nAnother claim come from a university student who said when she met him at a nightclub, he put his hand under her skirt and pinched her bottom when taking a photo with him.\nOne woman says that at an industry ball in 2014 he groped her under her dress, while a junior worker says in 2012 he dropped his trousers without wearing underwear in front of her.\nSeveral men claim they witnessed Wallace making inappropriate sexual comments.\nAmong the recent claims, a 19-year-old MasterChef worker said in 2022 she tried to raise concerns to the BBC about Wallace's comments about her body.\n\nIt comes as the BBC has received 50 new claims over the TV presenter, including allegations he pulled his trousers down in front of one worker on the show and groped another\n\nWriting on Instagram, Gregg said he had taken the decision to go public before the Silkins report was published as 'he cannot sit in silence while my reputation is further damaged'\nA former policeman said that in 2023 he also tried to complain about Wallace's sexually inappropriate language.\nThe BBC reports that most of the women who have come forward are young freelancers who felt they were unable to complain without negative career repercussions.\nWriting on Instagram, Wallace said he had taken the decision to go public before the Silkins report was published as 'I cannot sit in silence while my reputation is further damaged to protect others'.\nThe former greengrocer had stepped down from MasterChef while complaints from 13 women about historical allegations of misconduct were investigated.\nWallace, who has worked for the BBC for 21 years, said 'the most damaging claims (including allegations from public figures which have not been upheld) were found to be baseless'.\nHe said he had recognised 'that some of my humour and language, at times, was inappropriate'.\n'I was hired by the BBC and MasterChef as the cheeky greengrocer. A real person with warmth, character, rough edges and all,' Wallace said.\n'For over two decades, that authenticity was part of the brand. Now, in a sanitised world, that same personality is seen as a problem.'\nA source reportedly said Wallace had been cleared of the most high profile allegations that had been brought by Penny Lancaster and Kirsty Wark.\n'But the BBC has made it clear there is no way back for him. He is devastated,' they said.\nThe former greengrocer, who was recently diagnosed with autism, accused the BBC of doing nothing to 'investigate my disability or protect me from what I now realise was a dangerous environment for over twenty years'.\nAnd he vowed 'I will not go quietly' as he said the full 200 page report will not be published with the BBC instead going to release an executive summary.\n'What really concerns me about the short summary is others who have been found guilty of serious allegations have been erased from the published version of events. I, and I'm sure the public, would like to know why?,' he said.\nA source told The Sun that Wallace was 'both furious and devastated' by the BBC's decision to axe him.\nThe report is to be officially published on Thursday, but Wallace's legal team have claimed to have seen the report. \n\nA BBC spokesperson told MailOnline: 'Banijay UK instructed the law firm Lewis Silkin to run an investigation into allegations against Gregg Wallace.\n'We are not going to comment until the investigation is complete and the findings are published.'\nIn response to the latest allegations, a spokesperson for Wallace told the BBC: 'Gregg continues to co-operate fully with the ongoing Banijay UK review and as previously stated, denies engaging in behaviour of a sexually harassing nature.'\nWallace was initially bullish in the face of the allegations, taking to Instagram to say they mostly came from 'middle class women of a certain age'.\nHe went on to ask: 'Can you imagine how many women on MasterChef have made sexual remarks or sexual innuendo?'\nSince then, several high-profile names - including TV presenter Ulrika Jonsson as well as Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer - had condemned his remarks in public statements.\nThe former greengrocer later apologised for the controversial comments which caused a PR storm.\nThe under-fire presenter said of his middle class women slur: 'I wasn't in a good headspace when I posted it. I've been under a huge amount of stress, a lot of emotion.'\nHe told the Mail in April had he how he stopped socialising with young people after first being disciplined by the BBC in 2018, because he was 'scared they would complain about him.'\nHe was disciplined for inappropriate behaviour while working on a quiz show when he told a young runner on the final day of filming that he'd 'really enjoyed working with her, she was brilliantly clever, strikingly attractive and was going to do well'.\n\nThe report is to be officially published on Thursday, but Wallace's legal team have claimed to have seen the report\nTalking about the aftermath in a new interview, he explained: 'My behaviours completely and utterly changed from 2018 and that's why there are no complaints in this big investigation after 2018. It changed me completely and I never got into trouble again.\n'But the way I did it was to become a social recluse. I refused to do anything social at work, wouldn't go to the pub with anyone, to the point where when we went out on location everybody else would go out for dinner and I would stay in my hotel room.\n'I wouldn't socialise. I stopped any social conversations with younger people that I didn't know very well.'\nWallace recalled: 'There's some really good young people at work and they'd say 'Gregg we're all going for a drink are you gonna come?'\n'And I'd say no I won't come. You guys make me nervous. The sensibilities of a sixty year old man are different to 25-year-olds and you live in a complaint culture that never existed.\n'If I go out with you and I drink and offer an opinion, political or social, I'm scared you're going to complain about me. The anxiety levels were just extraordinary.'\nBBCGregg Wallace\n\nShare or comment on this article: \nGregg Wallace faces another blow as 'entire final MasterChef series could be scrapped' as sacked BBC presenter faces 50 new misconduct claims\n\nAdd comment\n\n Share what you think\n\nNo comments have so far been submitted.

About two hours after he’d arrived, Bradley arrived and was led down to see Tom.' \n\nTom Holland (pictured on Tuesday) and Bradley Cooper surprised fans dining at Gordon Ramsay 's Lucky Cat restaurant in Bishopsgate, London on Monday\n\nSpiderman actor Tom, 29, headed to the chef's private kitchen for a one-on-one cooking lesson (Gordon pictured in May)\nGordon opened the 120-seat Lucky Cat on level 60 at 22 Bishopsgate which serves dishes like soft shell crab maki and uni toast back in February. \nLucky Cat Bar on the same level has seating for 60 and offers the 'Lucky Negroni' and a martini menu with citrus, floral, and umami options.\nAlso on floor 60 is 12-seat chef's table Restaurant Gordon Ramsay High, an extension of Chelsea flagship Restaurant Gordon Ramsay.\nCompleting the collection just two levels down is The Gordon Ramsay Academy Powered By Hexclad with Bao buns and Beef Wellington.\nThe height of the eateries means they all clinch the title of London's highest restaurant from Duck & Waffle on the 40th floor of the nearby Salesforce Tower, also on Bishopsgate.\nLucky Cat also offers 360-degrees of London through Ramsay's full-height windows as diners are able to watch chefs at the open sushi bar or guest-facing kitchen.\nThe celebrity chef said: 'I've been lucky enough to open restaurants all over the world, but there's something truly unique about London.\n'It's where my journey began, and it's the city I'm proud to call home. Watching it evolve into a global culinary powerhouse has been remarkable.' \n\nAs he wrapped up his class, Bradley later arrived to visit his friend, leaving diners even more shocked (Bradley pictured last month)\n\nOne customer told The Sun: 'Tom was taken down to Gordon’s private kitchen for a one-on-one lesson. About two hours after he’d arrived, Bradley arrived and was led down to see Tom'\n\nGordon added: 'Building this beautiful space has been an ambitious project, but that's exactly what makes Gordon Ramsay Restaurants so special - we never stop pushing boundaries.\n'I couldn't be more excited to open three of our most iconic restaurants, all reimagined, taken to new heights, and built under one roof, it's a dream come true and a major milestone for our business.'\nThe final stages of the project will include the opening of Lucky Cat Terrace and Bread Street Kitchen Bishopsgate later in 2025.\nBishopsgate is notable for its skyscrapers and is also home to the main London offices of several major banks, including National Westminster Bank and the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development.\nBradley CooperGordon RamsayTom Holland\n\nShare or comment on this article: \nTom Holland and Bradley Cooper surprise fans at Gordon Ramsay's London restaurant as Spider-Man actor attends cooking lessons\n\nAdd comment\n\n Share what you think\n\nNo comments have so far been submitted.

On Monday, Trump sent letters to Japan and South Korea, among other countries. On Tuesday, the US president announced a potential 50 percent toll on copper imports, and said he was looking at 200 percent tariffs on pharmaceuticals.The news sent the price of copper — with a wide range of uses including in cars, construction and telecoms — to a record high Tuesday.But Kathleen Brooks, research director at XTB, said Wednesday \"the market is not taking Trump at his word when it comes to tariffs, and the market impact has been limited so far.\"The tech-rich Nasdaq Composite Index vaulted nearly one percent higher to a fresh all-time high, while artificial intelligence giant Nvidia touched $4 trillion in market value before falling back slightly.\"The market is certainly not acting as if it's fearing the tariffs,\" said Briefing.com analyst Patrick O'Hare. \"Obviously, there's been a lot of attention on the tariff letters that have gone out this week, but the market is operating on the assumption that they are just negotiating tools and that, ultimately, better terms will be reached.\"European markets were also shrugging off risks of a trade war. Germany's Dax hit a new high as it posted a 1.4 percent gain, matched by the CAC 40 in Paris. London could only manage a gain of just under 0.2 percent. But Chris Beauchamp, chief market analyst at online trading platform IG, urged caution as \"reports suggesting that Trump relishes the actual dealmaking process more than an actual resolution seem to suggest that a further delay to tariffs will be forthcoming, although this is an approach fraught with risk.\"Earlier in Asia, Tokyo gains were tempered by losses in Hong Kong and Shanghai.

Ben Ray Luján (D-NM) if he'd \"sign off on an inaccurate statement due to political pressure,\" in a potential similar scenario in the future, Jacobs said he would not.The Senate Committee needs to vote on Jacob's nomination before a full senate vote would take place to confirm him.","summary":"President Donald Trump's pick to lead the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration called staffing NOAA weather offices a \"top priority\" — but also supported proposed budget cuts at the agency.","url":"https://www.scrippsnews.com/politics/the-president/president-trumps-pick-to-lead-noaa-commits-to-prioritizing-staffing-at-agency","image":"https://ewscripps.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/261d902/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5828x3060+0+0/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fewscripps-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F07%2Fdd%2Fd817cdbc48238e1d4eb550c3617c%2Fap25035781515172.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-07-09 23:53:11","author":"Simon Kaufman","authors":["Simon Kaufman"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.05},{"id":340041180,"title":"AI giant Nvidia becomes first company to reach $4T in value","text":"Nvidia became the first company to touch $4 trillion in market value on Wednesday, a new milestone in Wall Street's bet that artificial intelligence will transform the economy.Shortly after the stock market opened, Nvidia vaulted as high as $164.42, giving it a valuation above $4 trillion. The stock subsequently edged lower, ending just under the record threshold.\"The market has an incredible certainty that AI is the future,\" said Steve Sosnick of Interactive Brokers. \"Nvidia is certainly the company most positioned to benefit from that gold rush.\"Nvidia, led by electrical engineer Jensen Huang, now has a market value greater than the GDP of France, Britain or India, a testament to investor confidence that AI will spur a new era of robotics and automation.The California chip company's latest surge is helping drive a recovery in the broader stock market, as Nvidia itself outperforms major indices. Part of this is due to relief that President Donald Trump has walked back his most draconian tariffs, which pummeled global markets in early April.Even as Trump announced new tariff actions in recent days, US stocks have stayed at lofty levels, with the tech-centered Nasdaq ending at a fresh record on Wednesday.\"You've seen the markets walk us back from a worst-case scenario in terms of tariffs,\" said Angelo Zino, technology analyst at CFRA Research.While Nvidia still faces US export controls to China as well as broader tariff uncertainty, the company's deal to build AI infrastructure in Saudi Arabia during a Trump state visit in May showed a potential upside in the US president's trade policy.\"We've seen the administration using Nvidia chips as a bargaining chip,\" Zino said. New advances Nvidia's surge to $4 trillion marks a new benchmark in a fairly consistent rise over the last two years as AI enthusiasm has built. In 2025 so far, the company's shares have risen more than 21 percent, whereas the Nasdaq has gained 6.7 percent.Taiwan-born Huang has wowed investors with a series of advances, including its core product: graphics processing units (GPUs), key to many of the generative AI programs behind autonomous driving, robotics and other cutting-edge domains.The company has also unveiled its Blackwell next-generation technology allowing more super processing capacity. One of its advances is \"real-time digital twins,\" significantly speeding production development time in manufacturing, aerospace and myriad other sectors.However, Nvidia's winning streak was challenged early in 2025 when China-based DeepSeek shook up the world of generative AI with a low-cost, high-performance model that challenged the hegemony of OpenAI and other big-spending behemoths.Nvidia's lost some $600 billion in market valuation in a single session during this period.Huang has welcomed DeepSeek's presence, while arguing against US export constraints. AI race In the most recent quarter, Nvidia reported earnings of nearly $19 billion despite a $4.5 billion hit from US export controls limiting sales of cutting-edge technology to China.The first-quarter earnings period also revealed that momentum for AI remained strong. Many of the biggest tech companies -- Microsoft, Google, Amazon and Meta -- are jostling to come out on top in the multi-billion-dollar AI race.A recent UBS survey of technology executives showed Nvidia widening its lead over rivals.Zino said Nvidia's latest surge reflected a fuller understanding of DeepSeek, which has ultimately stimulated investment in complex reasoning models but not threatened Nvidia's business. Nvidia is at the forefront of \"AI agents,\" the current focus in generative AI in which machines are able to reason and infer more than in the past, he said.\"Overall the demand landscape has improved for 2026 for these more complex reasoning models,\" Zino said.But the speedy growth of AI will also be a source of disruption. Executives at Ford, JPMorgan Chase and Amazon are among those who have begun to say the \"quiet part out loud,\" according to a Wall Street Journal report recounting recent public acknowledgment of white-collar job loss due to AI.Shares of Nvidia closed the day at $162.88, up 1.8 percent, finishing at just under $4 trillion in market value. by John Biers","summary":"","url":"https://tribune.net.ph/2025/07/09/ai-giant-nvidia-becomes-first-company-to-reach-4t-in-value","image":"https://media.assettype.com/tribune/2025-01-28/hucosw88/Deep-Seek-6d708161a2a13a60fc690358480722a6.webp?w=1200&h=675&auto=format%2Ccompress&fit=max&enlarge=true","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-07-09 23:52:23","author":"Agence France-Presse","authors":["Agence France-Presse"],"language":"en","source_country":"ph","sentiment":0.142},{"id":340037618,"title":"Rhode Island man charged for allegedly threatening to kill Trump, other administration officials","text":"A Rhode Island man faces serious charges after he allegedly threatened to kill President Donald Trump and multiple members of his administration on Truth Social. The Department of Justice (DOJ) said 37-year-old Carl D. Montague has been charged with threats against the president, interstate threats, threats to assault and kidnap, or murder of a U.S. official, judge or law enforcement officer. Montague is accused of writing a profanity-laced post on Truth Social on June 27, 2025, threatening to shoot and kill Trump, Attorney General Pam Bondi and White House Deputy Chief of Staff Stephen Miller. The FBI wrote in a criminal complaint filed against Montague that it was notified by Trump Media and Technology, the parent company of Truth Social, about the post at 11:30 p.m. on June 27. FEDERAL GRAND JURY INDICTS MAN FOR THREATENING TO ASSASSINATE TRUMP AFTER REELECTION The post read, \"It’s a shame you won’t get to see the end of our f- - - - -g term, because I’m gonna make sure I put a bullet…between your f- - - - -g head you piece of s- -t, you Pam Bondi.

Once agents contacted Montague at his residence in Rhode Island, he allegedly confirmed he had made the post. FORMER COAST GUARD OFFICER ARRESTED AFTER ALLEGEDLY THREATENING TO ASSASSINATE TRUMP: FBI The criminal complaint alleges that Montague said he was smoking a lot of marijuana when he posted the threat. It is also alleged he claimed to delete the Truth Social account after sending the message. Additionally, Montague reportedly said he was upset with the current politics and turned to Truth Social to express his frustrations. FLORIDA MAN INDICTED FOR '86' POSTS THREATENING TO KILL ALINA HABBA The complaint acknowledged that Montague said he did not have a specific reason to direct his threat toward Miller or Bondi, adding that he could not identify Bondi. Ultimately, Montague expressed remorse for his post, the complaint noted. The FBI said in the complaint that Montague does not own or have access to weapons, nor did he have plans, intentions or the means to travel to commit such violence.

Mohn, 33, took the stand in a suburban Philadelphia courtroom on the third day of his trial on murder and other charges stemming from the Jan. 30, 2024, homicide of his father, Michael F. Mohn.\n\nMohn, dressed in a blue sport coat, shirt and tie, with his arms shackled to his waist, spoke clearly without any apparent emotion for more than two hours of direct testimony and cross examination.\n\nResponding to questions from his attorney, Steven Jones, Mohn said he shot his father in the bathroom of the family’s Levittown home after telling him he was going to arrest him. Mohn said his father, who he said was an experienced martial artist, told him he would kill him before he let that happen and reached for the gun.\n\n“Unfortunately, he resisted,” Justin Mohn said, adding: “I was hoping to perform a citizen’s arrest on my father for, ultimately, treason.”\n\nHe described a list from his notebook, shown during the trial, that had the lines “Boom” and “Slice” as his “Plan B,” and said he expected his father to go along with the citizen’s arrest.\n\nHe said he differed politically from his parents, describing them as on the left. He told the court he believed his father wanted to stop him from becoming a politician similar to President Donald Trump and that his father gave false statements in an unrelated civil case Justin Mohn brought in federal court.\n\nAsked why he beheaded his father, he said he wanted to send a message to federal government workers to meet his demands, which included their resignation as well as the cancellation of public debt, among other things. He said he didn’t do it out of hatred for his father or to cause trauma to his family. His mother, Denice Mohn, cried in court at the end of the direct questioning from his attorney.\n\n“I knew something such as a severed head would not only go viral but could lessen the violence,” Justin Mohn said.\n\nProsecutors said Mohn shot his father with a newly purchased pistol, then decapitated him with a kitchen knife and machete. The 14-minute YouTube video he posted was live for several hours before it was removed.\n\nMohn was arrested later that day after scaling a fence at Fort Indiantown Gap, the state’s National Guard headquarters. He said in court he knew it was wrong to jump the fence at the site. Prosecutors said he called for others to join him in attempting to overthrow the U.S. government.\n\nMohn had a USB device containing photos of federal buildings and apparent instructions for making explosives when he was arrested, authorities said.\n\nHe also expressed violent anti-government rhetoric in writings he published online, going back several years. Earlier in the trial, the judge heard from Justin Mohn’s mother, who said police came to the house he shared with his parents and warned him about his online postings before the killing.\n\nEvery morning, the NY POSTcast offers a deep dive into the headlines with the Post’s signature mix of politics, business, pop culture, true crime and everything in between. Subscribe here!\n\nDenice Mohn testified that she and her husband had been offering financial support and guidance as Justin Mohn looked for a job.\n\nProsecutors described the homicide as “something straight out of a horror film.” They said Justin Mohn killed his father — who had been an engineer with the geoenvironmental section of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers’ Philadelphia District — to intimidate federal workers, calling it a “cold, calculated, organized plan.”\n\nThe YouTube video included rants about the government, immigration and the border, fiscal policy, urban crime and the war in Ukraine.\n\nIn court, Michael Mohn was remembered as a good neighbor and supportive father. In the video posted on YouTube, Justin Mohn described his father as a 20-year federal employee and called him a traitor.\n\nDuring a competency hearing last year, a defense expert said Mohn wrote a letter to Russia’s ambassador to the United States seeking to strike a deal to give Mohn refuge and apologizing to President Vladimir Putin for claiming to be the czar of Russia. The judge ruled Mohn was competent to stand trial.\n\nEvidence presented at the trial included graphic photos and the video posted to YouTube. The judge warned members of the public at the trial about the images and said they could leave before the photos were shown. The proceedings are known as a bench trial, with only a judge, not a jury.","summary":"Justin D.

However, the post did defend the state's current handling of the situation, arguing against how President Donald Trump's administration has tried to apply Title IX in practice. \"The California Department of Education (CDE) and CIF are both *independent* from the Newsom admin, and they are following existing state law — a law that was passed in 2013, signed by Governor Jerry Brown, and in line with 21 other states.

The DOJ's lawsuit is asking for an injunction on the state’s policy allowing males to compete against females in sports. California’s policies \"eviscerate equal athletic opportunities for girls… they also require girls to share intimate spaces, such as locker rooms, with boys, causing a hostile educational environment that denies girls educational opportunities,\" the lawsuit said. \"The results of these illegal policies are stark: girls are displaced from podiums, denied awards, and miss out on critical visibility for college scholarships and recognition.\" The state’s current policy allows athletes to participate in sports \"consistent with\" their gender identity. State officials have maintained that this doesn’t violate the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. The CIF told Fox News Digital it doesn't comment on legal matters. The CDE had no comment on pending litigation. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP The U.S. Education Department recently found California in violation of Title IX. However, the CDE and CIF both declined to sign the proposed resolution agreement offered by the department late last month. The CDE and CIF were given until July 7 to meet the demand. They refused, and now a legal battle will ensue. It will be the second legal battle the DOJ is fighting over the issue, having launched a similar one against Maine back in April.

That number has risen gradually since May 2000, when just 48% reported occasional use. With more people online, energy providers have begun preparing for a higher demand for electricity. \"The internet use was overstated, as it turns out, at least in the early going. And then it caught up, and we saw the consumptive use later,\" Constellation President and CEO Joseph Dominguez said. But when it comes to new artificial intelligence, Dominguez says widespread usage happened almost immediately and has expanded faster than the internet boom. White House A.I. and Crypto Czar David Sacks agrees. \"The adoption is faster than any previous technology. It&apos;s faster than the internet, it&apos;s faster than the iPhone. So, it&apos;s being adopted very quickly,\" Sacks said. \"Still, roughly half the public hasn&apos;t tried it yet.\" Fox News Polling shows 57% of registered voters rarely or never use artificial intelligence. Twenty-seven percent said they use the technology daily. Usage could be driven by their opinion of the technology. Those who saw A.I. as bad for society were less familiar with it and said they used it rarely (77%). Those who consider A.I. a good thing used it more regularly (47%). Experts believe A.I. use will only increase. \"OpenAI&apos;s ChatGPT, when they launched, was the fastest-growing adoption of any consumer technology product ever back in November 2022, but that&apos;s a drop in the bucket as to what they have now,\" said senior advisor Gregory Allen with the Wadhwani A.I. center at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. In order to supply the increasing demand and continue advancing A.I. technology, data centers are providing a 24-hour connection. ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE FUELS BIG TECH PARTNERSHIPS WITH NUCLEAR ENERGY PRODUCERS \"Running all of these computational resources that modern A.I. needs requires an awful lot of electricity,\" Allen said. A.I. models are frequently trained to remain relevant. Software requires regular updates and new data centers need large cooling systems to keep everything running. Allen says the largest A.I. algorithms will require between 1 and 5 gigawatts of electricity to operate. \"One gigawatt is about one Hoover Dam&apos;s worth of electricity. So, imagine five Hoover Dams being used to just power one data center full of one company&apos;s A.I.,\" Allen said. The growing complexity and need for updated infrastructure has put a strain on available resources. \"Data centers have become very large. So when you think about it, we need land that needs to be zoned. We need to get permits so that we can build these facilities, and we need to bring more electricity,\" Microsoft President and Vice Chair Brad Smith said. Data centers are often clustered in certain areas. According to the Northern Virginia Regional Commission, the area’s 250 facilities handle around 70% of global internet traffic. In areas with high concentration, tech companies can face delays in connecting to the grid. Overseas, some countries and localities have placed restrictions on how many data centers can be built. Stateside, Dominguez says President Donald Trump has taken some actions to help speed up some of the permitting processes. \"The executive orders are now cutting through a lot of the red tape, and effectively we&apos;re not required to do things that we were required to in the past,\" Dominguez said. ELECTRICITY PRICES SPIKE FOR AMERICAN HOUSEHOLDS: HERE&apos;S WHAT&apos;S DRIVING COSTS HIGHER Before a nuclear site is built, producers are required to obtain an early site permit that checks geology, site conditions and whether a new facility can be built. \"It makes sense if you&apos;ve never built a nuclear reactor in that place before. But in our case, we have existing reactors that have operated in these communities for decades,\" Dominguez said. \"Currently the NRC regulations require us to go through a laborious exercise that costs about $35 million a pop to verify what we already know and that is that nuclear could go there. As a result of the president&apos;s executive orders, that&apos;s no longer gonna be required.\" Once a nuclear site is up and running, future data centers could also plug in directly to the site. Electricity would be in constant supply. \"It runs like a freight train day or night, winter or summer, regardless of weather condition,\" Dominguez said. Nuclear plants operate at full capacity, more so than any other energy source, making it a reliable choice for tech companies.

The 93 nuclear generators create more electricity annually than the more than 8,000 wind, solar and geothermal power plants combined. Dominguez said that 24/7 energy supply may never be necessary and having a mix of sources is important. Constellation also develops solar energy along with nuclear. \"We have to develop 20 times as much solar to get the same impact as one megawatt of nuclear energy,\" Dominguez said.","summary":"Artificial intelligence usage is outpacing internet growth, creating electricity demands that require data centers to consume enormous amounts of power","url":"https://www.foxbusiness.com/technology/artificial-intelligence-drives-demand-electric-grid-update","image":"https://static.foxbusiness.com/foxbusiness.com/content/uploads/2025/07/susquehanna-nuclear-power-plant.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-07-09 23:38:30","author":"Amy Munneke,Bret Baier","authors":["Amy Munneke","Bret Baier"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.357}]}
