Yet he is poised to win after leading the effort to impeach Yoon in a rollercoaster political crisis. \n\nDuring Yoon’s six hours of martial law on December 3, Lee climbed the National Assembly’s walls to avoid security cordons deployed on Yoon’s orders. He livestreamed his exploit, urging viewers to come to parliament and demonstrate to prevent the arrest of lawmakers. \n\nShortly after, he told Reuters the crisis was like a “virus” that had infiltrated the South Korean system, and that he was dedicated to eradicating it. \n\n“We have to focus on removing the virus,” he said. “With proper, rapid treatment, we will recover, and through the process, our nation and democracy will become even stronger.” \n\nBorn to an impoverished farming family in a remote mountain village in the country’s southeast, Lee worked as a child in chemical factories. He says the experience, which left him with impaired hearing and a wrist deformity, explains his focus on economic equality. \n\nAs a human rights and labour lawyer, he entered politics, becoming mayor of Seongnam, south of Seoul, in 2010. Aiming for higher office, he came in third in the 2017 DP presidential primary after the impeachment and removal of conservative Park Geun-hye. The next year Lee was elected governor of Gyeonggi-do, South Korea’s most populous province. \n\nDuring the 2022 presidential campaign, his outsider image was initially considered a liability against establishment competitors. But with many disillusioned by runaway housing prices, poor employment prospects and a string of corruption scandals, Lee’s populist message drove him to the head of the DP pack.","summary":"SEOUL:

almost daily strikes in the past month.\n\nTrump has vowed that military action would continue until the Houthis are no longer a threat to shipping.","summary":"WASHINGTON: US President Donald Trump

lower interest rates as economic activity slows.\n\nFriday’s move in yields - which decline when bond prices rise - consolidated a trend this week of tentative optimism that the market may be

With 500 filling a packed indoor venue and another 500 gathered outside, the former Bank of Canada governor delivered a fiery speech attacking U.S. President Donald Trump and promising a bold vision for Canada’s future.Carney, who also served as governor of the Bank of England, took aim at Trump’s trade policies, accusing the U.S. of economic overreach. He touted Canada’s counter-tariffs, claiming revenue is already supporting affected workers. He vowed to dismantle interprovincial trade barriers by July 1 if elected, ushering in a new era of free trade within Canada. Carney also pledged to transform Canada into an “energy superpower,” a nod to Alberta’s oil and gas sector, which resonated strongly with the crowd.The event was much smaller than the recent Pierre Poilievre event in nearby Leduc, which attracted between 11,000 and 15,000 people..At one point, a supporter shouted “no fascists here” during Carney’s criticism of U.S. policies. Carney leaned into the sentiment, calling for “maximum damage” against American economic pressures and urging Canadians to unite against external threats.The rally wasn’t all about foreign policy. Carney addressed Canada’s mental health and addiction crisis, calling for greater cooperation among provinces and communities.The high point came outside, where Carney climbed into the bed of a pickup truck to address the overflow crowd. Free from his teleprompter, he spoke with authenticity and confidence, connecting with supporters. .A robust security presence, including personal detail and Edmonton Police Service officers, ensured the event ran smoothly both inside and out.Carney’s rally comes as polls show a tight race between the Liberals and Conservatives, with economic concerns and Canada-U.S. relations dominating the campaign.Born in Fort Smith, N.W.T., and raised in Edmonton, Carney’s homecoming event aimed to energize Alberta voters in a province traditionally skeptical of Liberal policies.As Canadians head to the polls Monday, Carney’s message of economic resilience, national unity, and a reimagined energy sector will be put to the test.Whether his bold promises and anti-Trump rhetoric will propel him to victory — or lead to a humbling fall — remains to be seen.","summary":"Liberal Leader Mark Carney fired up supporters in his hometown of Edmonton on Sunday afternoon, drawing about 1,000 people to a campaign rally on the eve of the federal election.","url":"https://www.westernstandard.news/news/carney-mocks-tump-at-small-edmonton-campaign-rally-on-eve-of-federal-election/64344","image":"https://media.assettype.com/westernstandard/2025-04-28/6tbhrdfb/UTF-8202504271731540.jpg?w=1200&h=675&auto=format%2Ccompress&fit=max&enlarge=true","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-28 00:41:56","author":"James Snell","authors":["James Snell"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"ca","sentiment":0.171},{"id":315454696,"title":"Trump Issues Ukraine-Russia Deal Deadline, 'Disappointed' in Putin","text":"President Donald Trump said on Sunday that he's giving \"two weeks\" for Ukraine and Russia to make a deal as Kyiv is losing too many people to continue fighting amid the ongoing war with Russia, adding that he's disappointed in Russian President Vladimir Putin for continuing the conflict after peace negotiation talks.Why It MattersTrump pledged during the 2024 U.S. presidential election that he would end the war in Ukraine in 24 hours if he won, but nearly 100 days into his second administration, a deal has yet to materialize.Tensions boiled over when Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky argued in front of reporters in the Oval Office in late February, leading Zelensky to prematurely depart from the White House without signing a much-touted deal to give the U.S. access to Ukraine's vast reserves of rare earth minerals.Relations continued to worsen, and the lack of progress prompted Trump to say that he would consider walking away from negotiations entirely. However, Trump and Zelensky spoke privately when both attended the funeral of Pope Francis in Rome on Saturday, and a reset of relations appeared to take place.Trump then posted a rare criticism of Putin on Truth Social, writing in part: \"...There was no reason for Putin to be shooting missiles into civilian areas, cities and towns, over the last few days. It makes me think that maybe he doesn't want to stop the war, he's just tapping me along, and has to be dealt with differently, through 'Banking' or 'Secondary Sanctions?' Too many people are dying!!!\"What To KnowTrump stopped to speak to reporters, as he has frequently done since returning to office, and addressed questions about the status of peace talks between Russia and Ukraine.In a rare rebuke of Putin, Trump told reporters: \"I am very disappointed in Russia. Putin needs to stop shooting and reach a deal,\" adding that Putin started shooting missiles at civilian targets despite discussions.When asked whether Trump trusts Putin, the president said he would \"let you know in about two weeks.\"When pressed about what \"two weeks\" would mean, Trump said: \"Two weeks or less, and if it's a little more at the time, I say they're losing a lot of people. We have three, four thousand people dying every week.\"He later described seeing satellite images of \"body parts laying all over the field,\" calling the images \"horrible\" and that \"it can't get any worse.\" He told reporters that he has \"a lot of things\" he can do for punitive measures should Russia continue resisting progress towards a deal.Trump also pushed back against the idea that he and Zelensky had any kind of falling out after their Oval Office blowup, instead saying \"it was never bad\", and they merely had a \"dispute\" but now he sees Zelensky as \"calmer\" and that he \"wants to make a deal.\"\"He's in a tough situation, a very tough situation,\" Trump said. \"He's been fighting a much bigger force, much bigger, and that force has not been very distinguished.\"Trump also said he believes Zelensky is ready to concede on Crimea, which was annexed by Russia in 2014, and blamed former Presidents Barack Obama and Joe Biden for Crimea, saying \"go ask [them]\" about the territory.What People Are SayingSenator John Kennedy, a Louisiana Republican, said during an appearance on Fox News Sunday: \"I think that Putin thinks that America has taken the bullet train to chump town. I think he thinks we're afraid of him. He has jacked around President Trump at every turn. He has disrespected our president. I don't think it's going to get any better until we make it clear to Mr. Putin that we are willing to turn him and his country into fish food - and I'm not talking about nuclear weapons or nuclear war. I would start with oil.Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky on X, formerly Twitter, on Saturday regarding his meeting with Trump: \"Good meeting. We discussed a lot one on one. Hoping for results on everything we covered. Protecting lives of our people. Full and unconditional ceasefire. Reliable and lasting peace that will prevent another war from breaking out. Very symbolic meeting that has potential to become historic, if we achieve joint results. Thank you @POTUS.\"Russian President Vladmir Putin said during a Saturday meeting, according to Russian state media Tass: \"The Kiev regime's venture has failed completely while the huge losses suffered by the enemy, in particular, those among the most combat-fit, best prepared and equipped Ukrainian army units, including the formations provided with Western equipment—and these are assault units and special operations forces—will undoubtedly have their impact along the entire engagement line.\"What Happens Next?Negotiations will continue between Russia and Ukraine, with the U.S. increasing pressure on Moscow to make a deal and end the conflict, but Putin is likely to have an eye on the upcoming May 9 Victory Day celebration, which he has emphasized each year during the conflict.Victory Day in Russia marks the Soviet Union's triumph over Nazi Germany, and Putin has made fresh comments of Ukraine as a \"neo-Nazi\" nation despite Zelensky being Jewish.","summary":"U.S. President Donald Trump spoke with reporters on the tarmac before boarding Air Force One in New Jersey.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/trump-issues-ukraine-russia-deal-deadline-disappointed-putin-2064824","image":"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2634164/president-donald-trump-morristown-reporters.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-28 00:37:59","author":"Peter Aitken","authors":["Peter Aitken"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.783},{"id":315454540,"title":"Trump's tariffs cast shadow over upcoming Asian elections","text":"TOKYO -- Voters across Asia are gearing up for a raft of crucial elections over the next few months.\n\nWhile local issues are dominating the campaigns in Singapore, Australia, the Philippines, South Korea and Japan, U.S. President Donald Trump's tariff policy is casting a heavy shadow across most of the polls.","url":"https://asia.nikkei.com/Economy/Trade-war/Trump-tariffs/Trump-s-tariffs-cast-shadow-over-upcoming-Asian-elections","image":"https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/https%3A%2F%2Fcms-image-bucket-production-ap-northeast-1-a7d2.s3.ap-northeast-1.amazonaws.com%2Fimages%2F4%2F9%2F5%2F8%2F49408594-4-eng-GB%2FCropped-174555960520250424-20250424-SUZ_3219.jpg?width=12","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-28 00:37:39","author":null,"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"jp","sentiment":-0.594},{"id":315454712,"title":"Mollie King announces the death of her beloved dog Alfie as she remembers her 'little companion' who was by her side 'almost half of her life'","text":"Black Friday\n\nKim Kardashian\n\nVictoria Beckham\n\nHarry Styles\n\nAmanda Holden\n\nBritain's Got Talent\n\nPrivacy Policy\n\nMonday, Apr 28th 2025\n\n5-Day Forecast\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMeghan Markle shares adorable unseen photos of her 'little loves' Archie and Lilibet picking flowers - hours after revealing their American accents for the first time\n\nBombshell new report reveals who made fatal mistake that caused Black Hawk to collide with jet and kill 67\n\nGene Hackman's final autopsy reveals shocking medical history after actor was found dead at 95\n\nRevealed: The secret anti-ageing prescription ingredient celebrities use to look years younger.

Hegseth has also come under fire for using the unclassified messaging system Signal to discuss Yemen attack plans.\n\n\"To preserve operational security, we have intentionally limited disclosing details of our ongoing or future operations. We are very deliberate in our operational approach, but will not reveal specifics about what we've done or what we will do,\" the US Central Command said in a statement.\n\nThe military said it has struck over 800 targets since mid-March that it says killed hundreds of Houthi fighters and numerous Houthi leaders as well as destroyed the militant group's facilities.\n\nWashington says the strikes aim to cut off Houthi military and economic capabilities while minimising civilian harm.\n\nIt said on Thursday that an Apr 20 blast near a UNESCO world heritage site in Yemen's capital Sanaa was caused by a Houthi missile and not an American airstrike. The Houthis said a dozen people were killed in that incident and dismissed the US denial.","summary":"","url":"https://www.channelnewsasia.com/world/us-military-says-it-will-limit-disclosing-details-strikes-yemen-5093466","image":"https://dam.mediacorp.sg/image/upload/s--VYuWORQF--/fl_relative,g_south_east,l_mediacorp:cna:watermark:2024-04:reuters_1,w_0.1/f_auto,q_auto/c_fill,g_auto,h_338,w_600/v1/one-cms/core/2025-04-27t220233z_1_lynxmpel3q0c5_rtroptp_3_usa-yemen-strikes.jpg?itok=","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-28 00:27:23","author":null,"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"sg","sentiment":-0.065},{"id":315457364,"title":"Japan denies report citing Bessent's push for strong yen","text":"TOKYO :Japan's top currency diplomat on Monday denied a media report that U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent had told his Japanese counterpart at a bilateral meeting in Washington that a weak dollar and a strong yen are desirable.\n\n\"As we have said, the U.S. side did not touch upon exchange-rate targets in the finance minister talks,\" Atsushi Mimura, Japan's vice finance minister for international affairs, told reporters.\n\nJapanese Finance Minister Katsunobu Kato and Bessent had their first face-to-face talks on Thursday on the sidelines of the International Monetary Fund and World Bank meetings in Washington.\n\nThe Yomiuri newspaper reported on Friday evening that Bessent told Kato his preference for a weak dollar and strong yen, without citing sources.\n\nOn Saturday, Kato also denied the Yomiuri report on the X social media platform, repeating that they did not discuss exchange-rate targets or a framework to manage yen rates.\n\nIn the press conference, Kato was tight-lipped on the details of the 50-minute meeting with Bessent, declining to comment on whether the U.S. made any specific requests to Japan.\n\nPresident Donald Trump's focus on addressing the U.S. trade deficit and his past remarks accusing Japan of intentionally maintaining a weak yen, have fueled market expectations that Tokyo will face pressure to strengthen the yen's value against the dollar and give U.S. manufacturers a competitive advantage.\n\nBessent said in a X post on Saturday that he had \"very constructive talks\" with Kato. \n\n\"I was pleased to follow up on previous reciprocal trade discussions between the United States and Japan, as well as to discuss matters pertaining to exchange rates,\" he said.","summary":"","url":"https://www.channelnewsasia.com/business/japan-denies-report-citing-bessents-push-strong-yen-5093596","image":"https://dam.mediacorp.sg/image/upload/s--BK8lenFI--/fl_relative,g_south_east,l_mediacorp:cna:watermark:2024-04:reuters_1,w_0.1/f_auto,q_auto/c_fill,g_auto,h_338,w_600/v1/one-cms/core/2025-04-28t002250z_1_lynxmpel3r00b_rtroptp_3_imf-worldbank-japan-yen.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-28 00:22:50","author":null,"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"sg","sentiment":0.047},{"id":315457888,"title":"Russia launches major drone attack on Ukraine despite 'productive' Vatican City Meeting","text":"April 27 (UPI) -- On the heels of a private meeting between President Donald Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky while attending the funeral for Pope Francis in Vatican City, Moscow attacked Kyiv with 149 drones, Ukraine reported Sunday.\n\nThe Ukrainian air force claimed that its forces shot down 57 of the drones, 67 were lost in flight, and that six of the country's regions sustained damage in the attack. This is the latest in a series of back and forth drone volleys between the neighbors. Kyiv said it recorded attempted strikes by 48 missiles and 442 drones launched by Moscow in the past week. \n\nTrump pushed back on Moscow's aggression and called on Russian President Vladimir Putin to stand down, questioning whether he is sincerely interested in an end to the fighting.\n\nTrump wrote on social media that there was \"no reason for Putin to be shooting missiles into civilian areas, cities and towns, over the last few days.\"\n\n\"It makes me think that maybe he doesn't want to stop the war, he's just tapping me along, and has to be dealt with differently, through 'Banking' or 'Secondary Sanctions?'

Protecting lives of our people. Full and unconditional ceasefire. Reliable and lasting peace that will prevent another war from breaking out. Very symbolic meeting that has potential to become historic, if we achieve joint results.\"\n\nIt was the first time the two leaders have met in person since February, when discussions devolved into threats and finger pointing in Washington after Zelensky warned Trump and Vice-President JD Vance that Russian aggression was an international problem and that the United States would feel the effects of Russian President Vladimir Putin's tactics.\n\nTrump and Vance fired back in what was seen by many as an apparent effort to intimidate and bully Zelensky on the international stage.\n\nTrump said he presented a \"final offer\" to Moscow and Kyiv last week to end the war. It includes recognizing Crimea as part of Russia and recognition that Russia assumes control areas unoccupied since its 2022 invasion of Ukraine.","summary":"On the heels of a private meeting between President Donald Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky while attending the funeral for Pope Francis in Vatican City, Moscow attacked Kyiv with 149 drones, Ukraine reported Sunday.

The beloved Pope was honoured at Rome's Santa Maria Maggiore basilica this Saturday, with a majestic send-off on the steps of Basilica San Pietro. The Vatican reckons about 250,000 folks and a hefty bunch of world bigwigs turned up for the service. With all eyes on the global broadcast, it didn't take long for eagle-eyed viewers to spot a cheeky few trying to bag a photo of the Pope's casket and the funeral march . Snaps taken towards the tail-end of the ceremony show most dignitaries standing in quiet tribute as the Pope's coffin was carried back into the basilica. But you could spot a handful of them, arms outstretched, phones in hand, snapping away as the procession strutted through the grand entrance. Nearly 10 world leaders were caught in the act, with VIPs like Swiss President Karin Keller-Sutter and Uganda's Deputy Speaker Tomas Tayebwa among them. Tayebwa even chucked a tweet online showing the coffin being hauled down the basilica's steps, plus a cheeky selfie with Joe Biden, reports the Mirror . He expressed his sentiments online, stating: \"I'm glad I had the chance to bid farewell to my spiritual leader who meant a lot to me personally. May His Soul Rest in Eternal Peace.\" Meanwhile, other attendees seated at a distance were seen snapping photos and recording videos of the Pope's procession, their identities partially concealed behind sunglasses. The sight of these dignitaries capturing the moment on camera left social media users stunned, with some arguing that electronic devices should have been prohibited by the Vatican. One viewer voiced their disapproval bluntly: \"Who the hell takes photos of a funeral, never mind world leaders, outrageous. Electronic devices should have been banned.\" Another went even further in their condemnation, labelling the act of photographing the deceased as \"morbid\". They said: \"Taking pictures of the dead is morbid.\" These photo-snapping leaders weren't the only ones catching flak for disrespect; Donald Trump also faced criticism for donning a blue suit that didn't quite match the expected dress code. The former US President was noticeably different in the front row among other dignitaries, wearing a blue suit that was visibly lighter than those worn by others nearby, including his wife, Melania. Guests were instructed to don dark attire, not necessarily black suits, yet Mr Trump was noticeably distinct in the assembly, especially since he was already positioned at the forefront. Observant members of the public didn't miss a beat, with one remarking on social media: \"Why isn't Trump wearing a black suit? Such disrespect.\" Another said: \"Respect? He's not even wearing a black suit. At least Melania is attending the funeral in all black including a modest black veil. Wishing a real bad sunburn on his bald combover.\" For the latest breaking news and stories from across the globe from the Daily Star, sign up for our newsletters .","summary":"Several world leaders were spotted whipping out their phones to take photos of the Pope Francis' coffin at his funeral on Saturday, with social media users left stunned","url":"https://www.dailystar.co.uk/news/uk-news/world-leaders-caught-phone-pope-35128997","image":"https://i2-prod.dailystar.co.uk/article35128993.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200b/0_VATICAN-RELIGION-POPE-FUNERAL.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-28 00:14:50","author":"Jamie Shapiro,Liam Doyle","authors":["Jamie Shapiro","Liam Doyle"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":0.002},{"id":315454714,"title":"Paula Radcliffe shares emotional clip of her daughter, Isla, 18, crossing the London Marathon finishing line after battling ovarian cancer age 13","text":"Black Friday\n\nKim Kardashian\n\nVictoria Beckham\n\nHarry Styles\n\nAmanda Holden\n\nBritain's Got Talent\n\nPrivacy Policy\n\nMonday, Apr 28th 2025\n\n5-Day Forecast\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMeghan Markle shares adorable unseen photos of her 'little loves' Archie and Lilibet picking flowers - hours after revealing their American accents for the first time\n\nBombshell new report reveals who made fatal mistake that caused Black Hawk to collide with jet and kill 67\n\nGene Hackman's final autopsy reveals shocking medical history after actor was found dead at 95\n\nRevealed: The secret anti-ageing prescription ingredient celebrities use to look years younger.

Email tips@dailymail.com\nBy CHLOE LOUISE FOR MAILONLINE\n Published:01:13 BST, 28 April 2025 |Updated:01:35 BST, 28 April 2025 \n\nPaula Radcliffe showed her support for her daughter, Isla, as she crossed the line of the London Marathon on Sunday after recovering from cancer.\nIsla, 18, was diagnosed with germ cell ovarian cancer at the age of 13 in August 2000, which left her needing weeks of gruelling chemotherapy. \nAnd she took part in the 26.2 mile race to raise money for Children with Cancer UK to help families going through the heartache and trauma they experienced. \nAs the brave teenager took her final steps, proud Paula shared a clip to her Instagram Stories and zoomed in on her daughter as she finished the race at 3.02pm. \nPaula can be heard shouting 'go Isla, go Isla, as she wrote alongside her clip: 'when your little girl has had few finish lines - but she has her own. Well done Isla'. \nPaula, who will be commentating for the BBC, said earlier this week: 'It's an extremely emotional place to be anyway, when you see people turn that corner on the Mall and they realise they've done it - but when it's your little girl doing it…'\n\nPaula Radcliffe showed her motherly support for her cancer survivor daughter, Isla, as she crossed the line of the London Marathon on Sunday \n\nIsla, 18, was diagnosed with germ cell ovarian cancer at the age of 13 in August 2000, which left her needing weeks of gruelling chemotherapy\nShe underwent during the Covid pandemic - meaning that Paula was the only member of her family who was allowed to be at her side as she fought the disease.\nPaula's father Peter, who had helped launch her on the road to success, died just weeks earlier aged 73 after falling sick while restrictions were in place.\nPaula - who competed in four Olympic Games and won gold in the World Championships in Helsinki in 2005 - told how her most gruelling marathon was dealing with Isla's diagnosis and its aftermath over a tormenting two-year period.\nShe said: 'I'll never forget the fear when someone tells you something is wrong with your baby. It is the scariest thing in the world.'\nPaula told how she took Isla to the paediatrician after she experienced a number of symptoms including chronic stomach pain, loss of breath and bleeding.\nShe said this week: 'It then moved very quickly. On the Tuesday she visited the doctor, we had a scan on the Wednesday and one week later we were already in the hospital starting the first round of chemo.'\nDescribing how the experience was far more challenging than any Olympic competition, Paula has spoken of her feelings of 'panic and helplessness'.\nShe said: 'It's the hardest thing a parent can go through.\n\nAnd she took part in the 26.2-mile race to raise money for Children with Cancer UK to help families going through the heartache and trauma they experienced\n\nAs the brave teenager took her final steps, proud Paula shared a clip to her Instagram Stories and zoomed in on her daughter as she finished the race at 3.02pm\n\nPaula can be heard shouting 'go Isla, go Isla, as she wrote alongside her clip: 'when your little girl has had few finish lines - but she has her own. Well done Isla'\n\nPaula is pictured with her husband, Gary Lough, son Raphael (right) and daughter Isla (centre)\n\nProud mother Paula is pictured at the Boston Marathon with children Isla and Raphael this year. She confirmed this was the last time she would run the distance\n\nPaula described her anguish after the news was broken her daughter had cancer, aged just 13\n'You can support them and be with them the whole way through, but you can't do that chemo for them.\n'It's horrible to watch your child suffering through that, but at the same time we believed that if it felt bad, it was killing the cancer.'\n\n Why Paula Radcliffe's cancer survivor daughter's London marathon will be mum's most emotional ever \nShe added: 'There are things you're not ready for - either going through it or as a parent.'\nIsla's cancer is said to affect just one in 200,000 women.\nPaula said: 'You have it from birth and then when you hit puberty it starts to reproduce.'\nIsla discussed her cancer diagnosis in an interview with The Times four years ago.\nShe told how she was initially relieved to identify what was wrong with her: I thought if we can solve this then I won't have those problems - having mood swings and being tired all the time were not normal but it meant I could make sense of them.\n'I didn't want to be told they didn't know what it was or that it was normal because I didn't want to carry on with the same pain and tiredness.'\nDescribing her treatment, Isla went on: 'I cried the most when I lost my hair\n'The chemo does not affect you much on the outside but losing my hair was a big thing.'\nTo help her cope, her brother Raphael would allow his sister to blow-dry his hair to compensate for not being able to style her own.\n\nIsla (pictured) said she cried when she lost her hair through chemotherapy. To help her cope, her younger brother would let her blow-dry his hair \n\nIsla is pictured as a youngster before her cancer diagnosis as she rides a scooter \nIsla said she was grateful for the attention her mother gave her: 'Just dealing with me, just taking time and making me the priority…And my brother didn't get as much time as he normally does or my grandma.\n'She was always there for me even if I snapped at her, she would not leave.'\nPaula and husband Gary Lough, a former middle distance runner and athletics coach, moved to the south of France in 2005 and live in a village just outside Monte Carlo with Isla and son Raphael, 14.\n\n Paula Radcliffe's cancer survivor daughter IGNORED her legendary mother's advice \nThe couple met at Loughborough University and Gary helped coach Paula on the road to glory winning a series of major titles and marathons before retiring 10 years ago.\nGary went on to work with Olympic legend Sir Mo Farah while Paula's most memorable victory in London saw her set a world record time of two hours, 15 minutes and 25 seconds.\nNo woman ran faster until Brigid Kosgei of Kenya finally broke the record in 2019.\nJust a year later, Isla received her devastating diagnosis.\nDue to Covid restrictions it was decided Paula would be with Isla in the hospital, while Gary was taking care of their son Raphael.\nPaula said: 'We had to pick one parent to go and we had to stick with the same parent all the way through\n'There was a huge amount of mother's guilt for the fact that you have to focus more on one child for that period of time.'\nIsla was given the all clear but has had to have regular check-ups and underwent a scare in 2023.\nPaula said of concerned medics: 'They saw something on the MRIs. So they called us in and said, 'We're really sorry, we're going to have to go in and look at it because she only has one fallopian tube left and we're pretty sure it's on there'.'\nIsla underwent three-hour surgery before doctors revealed their concerns were unfounded.\nPaula said: 'That was really hard and I think, emotions-wise, that being thrown back into it was something that I struggled with because I think that was at a time where... I guess it's the emotions, isn't it? When you just feel like everything's just getting on top of you.' \n\nDue to Covid restrictions at the time of Isla's diagnosis, it was decided Paula would be with her daughter in the hospital, while Gary was taking care of their son Raphael\nNow Isla has turned her attention to Isla's race on Sunday when she will be running to raise funds and awareness for Children with Cancer UK - a charity Paula has championed since her family went through their ordeal.\nBut Paula told how she had to rein her daughter in when it came to preparing for the race - so she could concentrate on winning a place at university.\nShe told Isla she wanted her to 'concentrate on her exams' and added: 'She's doing her final year of school ready for uni so she's under a whole lot of pressure.\n'I'm OK with her just doing it to finish it and not really pushing hard.'\n\nShare or comment on this article: \nPaula Radcliffe shares emotional clip of her daughter, Isla, 18, crossing the London Marathon finishing line after battling ovarian cancer age 13\n\nAdd comment\n\n Share what you think\n\nNo comments have so far been submitted.

I cannot discern any added value,”\n\nPresident Donald Trump urged Russia on Sunday to stop its attacks in Ukraine while his top diplomat said the US might walk away from peace efforts if it does not see progress. Speaking to reporters in New Jersey, Trump said he was disappointed that Russia has continued to attack Ukraine, and said his one-on-one meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy at the Vatican on Saturday had gone well.\n\nTrump said that his relationship with Zelenskyy had been improved by the face-to-face meeting. “Look, it was never bad. We had a little dispute, because I disagreed with something he said, and the cameras were rolling and that was OK with me.” He added, “I see him as calmer. I think he understands the picture, and I think he wants to make a deal,” Trump said of Zelenskyy.\n\nRussia launched a sweeping drone assault and airstrikes across Ukraine early Sunday, killing at least four people, officials said. Three people died and four were wounded in airstrikes on Kostyantynivka in the Donetsk region of eastern Ukraine, the regional prosecutor’s office said. Another person died and a 14-year-old girl was wounded in a drone attack on the city of Pavlohrad in the Dnipropetrovsk region, which was hit for the third consecutive night, Gov. Serhii Lysak said.\n\nUS secretary of state Marco Rubio said the Trump administration might abandon its attempts to broker a deal if Russia and Ukraine do not make headway. “It needs to happen soon,” Rubio told the NBC programme “Meet the Press.’” “We cannot continue to dedicate time and resources to this effort if it’s not going to come to fruition.”\n\nTrump also said on Sunday said he thought Zelenskyy was ready to give up Crimea, in direct contradiction to the Ukrainian leader’s statements on the peninsula annexed by Russia. “Oh, I think so,” said Trump in response to a question on whether he thought Zelenskyy was ready to “give up” the territory that Russia occupied in 2014.\n\nZelenskyy said on Sunday Ukraine’s army was still fighting in Russia’s Kursk despite Moscow claiming the “liberation” of its western region. Kyiv had hoped it could use land in the Kursk region as a bargaining chip in future peace talks with Russia. “Our military continues to perform tasks in the Kursk and Belgorod regions – we are maintaining our presence on Russian territory,” he said in his evening address Sunday. In a statement earlier Sunday, he conceded that the situation remained difficult in many areas including Kursk.\n\nNorth Korea has confirmed for the first time that it has sent troops to fight for Russia in the war with Ukraine under the orders of leader Kim Jong-un. The end of the battle in Russia’s Kursk region showed the “highest strategic level of the firm militant friendship” between North Korea and Russia, the North’s KCNA state news agency cited the ruling party as saying.\n\nA Moscow court on Sunday ordered remanded in custody a Ukrainian citizen facing terrorism charges over the killing of a senior Russian military officer near Moscow, Russia’s Investigative Committee said. The committee, which deals with serious crimes in Russia, claimed the suspect had pleaded guilty to killing Yaroslav Moskalik in a car bomb attack on Friday and had said he was recruited by Ukraine’s security services.","summary":"Boris Pistorius says Trump suggestion goes too far on territorial concessions; US president calls on Moscow to stop attacks while Rubio warns US could walk away from talks.

And because of hearing that woman speak about her experience instead of shutting down in fear and unfair shame, my mom is alive today. She was saved by a woman whose name she'll never know.'\nShe then called womanhood a 'pact that privately we must show others how to survive, literally or spiritually.'\n'We don't let our daughters know, but one day we break their hearts by letting them in on the secret that we kept from them as they pranced around in princess dresses that they are not and will likely never be safe at work, at home, in a parking lot in a medical office, online — in any space they inhabit physically, emotionally, professionally.'\nBlake called the 'superpower of female triumph' a 'basic human right,' and added, 'Never underestimate a woman's ability to endure pain.'\n\nTheir latest loved-up outing together comes after Lively was hit by widespread backlash for her speech at the Time100 Gala on Thursday night (seen on April 24, 2025)\n\nBut viewers were left unimpressed by the speech, taking to social media to blast Blake for sharing her mother's trauma as an 'obvious PR move' amid her ongoing feud with Baldoni (pictured with her mother) \nWhile she also paid tribute to Ryan, as she thanked 'every man, including my sweet husband, who are kind and good when no one is watching.'\nBut viewers were left unimpressed by the speech, taking to social media to blast Blake for sharing her mother's trauma as an 'obvious PR move' amid her ongoing feud with Baldoni.\nMany fans criticized the star for using her mother's ordeal in the speech, after remaining silent on domestic violence while promoting It Ends With Us — directed by and co-starring Baldoni — which portrayed an abusive relationship.\n'Oh so now she is using her Mother’s SA to be likable??? But in August she didn’t mention DV when promoting a movie about DV. Interesting…' one person wrote.\n'Blake Lively used her Time100 speech to reveal her mother is a rape survivor—an obvious PR move to align with SA victims. Yet, with that personal connection to trauma, she still couldn’t figure out how to market a movie about DV? What’s next for her, a Peace Nobel Prize?' another added.\n'Why wasn’t she having these speeches when she was promoting the movie?? Instead she was promoting alcohol and naming drinks after the characters. don’t understand why they keep giving her a platform.'\n'My mom is a victim so I know suffering too? What is the point in telling mom's story?' another person questioned.\nElsewhere in her speech, Blake discussed being an honouree 'in a time where the most valuable currency seems to be anger, it feels like an act of defiance to commune and celebrate all the good that is alive in the world.'\nAs for being called influential, she said: 'How we use that matters. Who and what we stand up for, and what we stay silent about, what we monetize versus what we actually live, matters.'\nRyan ReynoldsBlake Lively\n\nShare or comment on this article: \nBlake Lively makes bold red carpet statement as beleaguered actress arrives at premiere with Ryan Reynolds\n\nAdd comment\n\nComments 81\n\n Share what you think\n\nWorst rated\n\nThe comments below have not been moderated.\n\nThe views expressed in the contents above are those of our users and do not necessarily reflect the views of MailOnline.\n\nAdd your comment\n\nEnter your comment\n\nBy posting your comment you agree to our house rules.\n\nSubmit Comment\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual.\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual\n\nWe will automatically post your comment and a link to the news story to your Facebook timeline at the same time it is posted on MailOnline.

Nordgold already operates the Bissa and Bouly mines.\n\nThe council of ministers said late Thursday that the Niou mine was expected to yield approximately 20.22 metric tons of gold over its eight-year lifetime.\n\nJilbey Burkina will retain an 85% stake in the project, while the Burkinabe government will hold the remaining 15% without financial contribution, in accordance with the country's new mining regulations.\n\nThe project will contribute 51.5 billion CFA francs ($89 million) to the state's budget over its lifespan and 7.06 billion CFA francs to the state's mineral wealth fund, the council of ministers said.\n\nGold prices have risen by over 25% this year, fuelled by geopolitical instability and U.S. President Donald Trump's trade policies.\n\nBurkina Faso, which has been fighting Islamist militants since 2015, is a major gold producer. According to non-governmental organisation Swissaid, which analyses mining, the country produced over 57 tons in 2023.\n\nMining companies operating there include Canada's IAMGOLD and Endeavour Mining and Australia's West African Resources Ltd.\n\n\"The cooperation with Nordgold and other industrial mines is important (for Burkina's government) as the country faces a budget crunch,\" said Ulf Laessing, head of the Sahel programme at Germany's Konrad Adenauer Foundation.\n\nHowever, the Niou project will be located in a large artisanal mining area and might deprive the people working as artisanal miners of key income, he said.\n\nThe government said the mine could generate 204 jobs, while also helping sustain employment at the nearby Bissa Gold SA mine.","summary":"Burkina Faso has granted an industrial mining licence to Russian miner Nordgold for a gold project, the military-led West African government said.","url":"https://www.myjoyonline.com/burkina-faso-grants-mining-lease-to-russias-nordgold-for-gold-project/","image":"https://www.myjoyonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Burkina-Faso.png","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-28 00:07:00","author":"Abubakar Ibrahim,Jilbey Burkina","authors":["Abubakar Ibrahim","Jilbey Burkina"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gh","sentiment":0.116},{"id":315455606,"title":"Winners And Losers From The Packers’ Memorable Draft Weekend","text":"Green Bay Packers fans had a lot to celebrate during an unforgettable weekend.\nCopyright 2025 The Associated Press. All rights reserved\n\nThe Green Bay Packers threw a three-day party in the NFL’s smallest city over the weekend.\n\nAnd the good times could carry over to the field in 2025.\n\nGreen Bay hosted the NFL Draft for the first time ever, and it was a smashing success.\n\nOn top of it, the Packers appeared to have a highly productive draft, with the wide receiver and offensive line groups benefitting the most.\n\nHere are Green Bay’s winners and losers from draft weekend.\n\nWINNER: JORDAN LOVE\n\nGreen Bay’s wideouts simply weren’t good enough in 2024.\n\nAccording to Pro Football Reference, the Packers had the third-highest number of drops in football last season (33) and the second-highest drop rate (6.9%).\n\n“To be honest with you … we had a ton of drops, and that’s an area that we have to clean up,” head coach Matt LaFleur said.\n\nMORE FOR YOU\n\n‘Major’ U.S. Dollar Fed Warning Braces Bitcoin For A BlackRock ‘Megaforce’ Price Shock\n\nTesla, Looking To Boost Sales, Has A New Killer Model 3 Lease\n\nTrump Approval Rating Tracker: Majority Don’t Approve Of Trump’s Handling Of Inflation, Border And Trade\n\nSo general manager Brian Gutekunst spent a first round draft pick on wideout Matthew Golden and a third rounder of receiver Savion Williams.\n\nGolden will almost certainly play immediately, while the Packers will carve out a role for Williams as the season unfolds.\n\nIn two short days, the talent around Love improved dramatically.\n\nLOSER: DONTAYVION WICKS\n\nWicks, who’s entering his third season in 2025, was an enormous disappointment in 2024.\n\nWicks led the Packers in targets (76), but was just fourth in receptions (39) and fourth in receiving yards (415). His catch rate of 51.3% was the second worst in football among wideouts.\n\nWith the additions of Golden and Williams, someone in the wide receiver room is going to lose snaps. The best guess is the inconsistent Wicks could fade to black.\n\n“It’s going to be really competitive to get on the field and get snaps and get targets and all those things,” Packers general manager Brian Gutekunst said. “But that’s the way you want to want it, right?”\n\nWINNER: LUKAS VAN NESS\n\nMany anticipated the Packers would take a defensive end, or two, early in the draft. Instead, Green Bay didn't address the position until Round 4.\n\nThat means Van Ness will be given every chance to prove he’s not a bust.\n\nVan Ness, a first round draft pick in 2023, had four sacks, 10 quarterback hits and eight tackles for loss as a rookie. Many expected Van Ness to take a major jump in 2024, but he finished with three sacks, six quarterback hits and six tackles for loss.\n\nIn bypassing a defensive end the first three rounds, the Packers largely told Van Ness they believe he can still live up to his first round billing. Now, he must go prove it.\n\n“My expectations are always going to be higher for myself than anybody else and I’ve naturally always been that way,” Van Ness said. “I’m hard on myself, but that ultimately is what pushes me and drives me to be a great player. So, my mindset isn't going to change.\n\nWINNERS: KEISEAN NIXON, NATE HOBBS, CARRINGTON VALENTINE\n\nMany expected the Packers would draft a cornerback in the early rounds to upgrade a solid, but far from spectacular group. Instead, Green Bay didn't draft a corner until it took Micah Robinson in Round 7.\n\nSo for now anyhow, the Packers are all in on the trio of Nixon, Hobbs and Valentine.\n\n“We feel pretty good about our group right now,” Gutekunst said. “The guys that we have in that room, they’ve got some pelts on the wall, so to speak, as far as what they’ve been able to do in the National Football League.”\n\nLOSER: RASHEED WALKER\n\nGreen Bay used its second round draft pick on offensive lineman Anthony Belton, who can play both tackle and guard. After the draft, Packers general manager Brian Gutekunst said they’d like to find out if Belton can play left tackle.\n\n“With his size and length, you certainly want to see if he can do tackle, and he has all the athletic ability to do that,” Gutekunst said.\n\nEarlier this offseason, Gutekunst said Jordan Morgan — Green Bay’s 2024 first round draft pick — would battle for the left tackle job in training camp.\n\nSo where does that leave Walker, who has been Green Bay’s left tackle the last two years?\n\nWalker will certainly get the chance to fight for his job during training camp. But Walker becomes a free agent after this season, and the Packers’ recent moves suggest they’re unlikely to give him a second contract.\n\nWINNER: THE NFL\n\nThe city of Green Bay shined as it hosted the NFL Draft for the first time ever. And the NFL should have been ecstatic with how things unfolded in one of football’s meccas.\n\nApproximately 600,000 people attended the draft over the three days — and that included a rain-soaked afternoon on Friday.\n\nThe first round on Thursday drew a reported 205,000. Friday’s second day drew 175,000, and on a sun-splashed Saturday, the crowd was estimated at a three-day high of 220,000.\n\nFans capped off the weekend with a concert by country star Brad Paisley.\n\n“What an atmosphere, having the draft here,” Gutekunst said. “There’s so many cool things that happened that quite frankly I didn’t expect. Yeah, I thought it might just be a nuisance but it was such a cool environment, such a cool thing.”\n\nDetroit set the attendance record of 775,000 last year. Green Bay’s total of 600,000 fans tied Nashville, Tenn. (2019) for the second-largest total ever.\n\nTraffic in the NFL’s smallest city wasn’t an issue. Crowds were festive — but peaceful. And the three-day party couldn't have gone much better.\n\nGreen Bay showed it could handle an enormous like the draft, and deserves consideration to host again one day.\n\n“I thought as far as the operation, I can't imagine any NFL draft being better than the one we hosted here,” LaFleur said. “What a great experience. Some really cool moments.”\n\nWINNER: CLAY MATTHEWS\n\nFormer Green Bay great Clay Matthews has a flair for the dramatic.\n\nIn Super Bowl XLV, with Green Bay’s lead against Pittsburgh slipping away, Packers’ linebackers coach Kevin Greene went to Matthews before the fourth quarter began and said: “It is time. It is time.”\n\nOn the next play, Matthews forced a fumble by Pittsburgh running back Rashard Mendenhall that Green Bay’s Desmond Bishop recovered.\n\nAs the first night of the draft began, Matthews told a story that left Packer Nation almost as fired up as that play did.\n\n“I just got off the phone with the President, Donald Trump,” Matthews said. “He asked me to pass a message along to all 32 NFL franchises. My fellow Americans … the Bears still suck!”\n\nThe hometown crowd erupted. Matthews flexed.\n\nIt was one of the finest troll jobs in recent memory.\n\nFollow me on Twitter.\nEditorial StandardsForbes Accolades","summary":"The city of Green Bay hosted the NFL Draft for the first time ever, and it was a smashing success.

Not only is growth unevenly distributed, but in so many countries, population is in decline. In some cases, steep, deep decline. Maybe most graphically (and demographically) there's Japan: a country that, since hitting a high of 128 million citizens in 2008, has lost population for 15 years running and is on pace to shrink by half by this century's end, despite government measures to halt the decline. This has huge impacts on the economy, the health care system, education, housing, national defense, immigration, the culture at large. Governments can control interest rates and inflation rates; stimulating birth rates is far harder. We report from the land of the rising sun—now also the land of declining sons (and daughters)...Ichinono, Japan, sits regally, wedged between mountains, an hour and a half west of Kyoto. Its listed population: just shy of 50, but if it seems like more, it's for good reason. The village comes embroidered with 40 lifelike puppets. In the middle of town. On a playground.

But making them cheers us up.This is as good a snapshot as any of Japan's demographic crisis. There are hundreds of communities here, fading like Ichinono.Jon Wertheim: Do you think there might come a day when the-- the puppet population exceeds the human population?Shinichi Murayama: (In Japanese/English translation) So, if things keep going the way they are right now, of course our population will decrease, maybe it'll go down to 40, or maybe 30. But at the same time my ability to continue making puppets is finite. So, yes. I am deeply worried about the future of our village.Modern Japan sounds like a sci-fi premise: the incredible shrinking country. Go-go Tokyo is the world's largest city, and Japan has one of the world's longest national life expectancies—85 years—but it's also losing population at a staggering rate. Last year, more than two people died for every new baby born, a net loss of almost a million. Today, Japanese buy more adult diapers than buy baby diapers. Jon Wertheim: Is there a more urgent issue in Japan right now than this demographic crisis?Taro Kono: There are climate change, government deficit. But, if there's no people living in Japan... Jon Wertheim: It's all – it's all relevant, climate change, and government deficits, and the military, if you don't have people living here.Taro Kono: That's right.A longtime high-ranking minister in Japan's parliament, Taro Kono was nearly elected prime minister in 2021, and says he intends to seek the highest office again. Jon Wertheim: What does Japan look like if it continues to shrink like this?Taro Kono: There are less and less number of a young generation. And, the all the burdens are on the young generation. And they won't be able to sustain. So society is going to be breaking up. Economy is just going to stagnate. Even for Self-Defense Force, last year. we recruited only half of what we need.Jon Wertheim: The Japanese military?Taro Kono: Uh-huh. You feel it.Declining population is hardly unique to Japan. Name a country outside Africa and odds are good it's losing people, or about to. In the U.S, the fertility rate is at an all-time low. Donald Trump has declared the collapse of fertility a crucial threat to the West. Kono wishes his country had been better prepared.Taro Kono: Every sector, even in the government, there's a labor shortage. And we really need to invest in technology to replace the human being. But, we are still slow to do that. The alternative is to open up the country to foreign immigrants. But there's some psychological barrier to open up the country.Jon Wertheim: What do you mean by that?Taro Kono: Well, I mean, the Japanese have been very homogeneous. Many Japanese don't know how to deal with non-Japanese living in the society.Jon Wertheim: Japan is also the world's fourth largest economy. Can it continue to be a power like that if the population keeps declining?Taro Kono: Nope.In part, Japan's declining demographics owes to a spike in the success of women in the workforce. And in Japan, a famously punishing work culture—coupled with a men-first social culture—makes it all the more difficult to balance career and family. Still more so amid a persistently stagnant economy. Roland Kelts: Up through the 1980s, the bubble years, Japan had omiai. They had arranged marriage. You know, the corporate guys would marry the office ladies. And this was all set up. It's gone, now. And the office ladies make more money than the corporate guys. So now, you have this shift in economics that has not been reflected in social norms.Roland Kelts is a Japanese American writer. He's married, but he's well aware that he's the exception. In 2023, fewer than 500,000 Japanese couples married, the lowest number since 1917.Jon Wertheim: I'm not sure other societies in the world have an implosion of marriage. Roland Kelts: Well, Japan's, I think, ahead of the game. Japan's where we're all headed.Jon Wertheim: You think this is-- this is a harbinger. Roland Kelts: I do. I think it's a canary in a coal mine. It doesn't help Japan's marriage rates—and therefore birth rates—that a growing number of businesses now cater to the rise of parties-of-one.We met Kelts at a ramen joint designed specifically for dining in solitude. There's single karaoke. We visited a bar open only to those arriving stag.There are 'solo weddings,' replete with professional photoshoots.But that's not all. Lately, alternative romance is highly in vogue. Just as robots today are helping ease some of the national labor shortages, inanimate objects are also making their way into the bedroom. We met Akihiko Kondo, who told us he sleeps alongside the anime character Miku, whom he married in a formal ceremony in 2018.He's one of thousands of Japanese who, unashamedly, say they are in a monogamous romantic relationship with a fictional character. Staggeringly (or maybe not), almost half of the country's millennial singles (ages, 18-34) self-report as virgins (compared to barely 20% in the U.S.) and, of course, less human copulation, means less human population.Roland Kelts: AI relationships, they're going to get better, and better, and better. And they're going to supersede, in some ways real physical relationships.To foster human relationships, the Tokyo government has taken action. Yuriko Koike is the city's governor.Gov. Yuriko Koike: We are promoting for matchmaking by artificial intelligence. Jon Wertheim: Tokyo government is playing Omiai, playing– playing matchmaker.Gov. Yuriko Koike: That's right.Yes, the Japanese capital city has launched its own dating app.Jon Wertheim: Is it working?Gov. Yuriko Koike: Yes, it's-- it's working. And, number of application is more than we expected, three or four times.Tokyo is also set to introduce a four-day workweek for government employees, designed to help working mothers and, hopefully, boost birth rates. Gov. Yuriko Koike: When the bubble economy was bursting there was a commercial advertisement, \"Work 24 hours.\" But, the longer we work, the–the less children we have. So demography is the one of the biggest national issues that we have to tackle. Jon Wertheim: The Japanese government has rolled out a number of programs to—to address this declining birth rate. Are any of them working?Hanako Okada: (In Japanese/English translation) The total fertility rate for 2024 was reported to hit an all-time low. The continuing slide in the birth rate clearly indicates our current policy isn't working at all.Until last year, Hanako Okada now 44, was a lawyer in Tokyo, and primary caregiver for her two children. Overworked and under-fulfilled, she ran for parliament on a platform of trying to alter the culture for women, even breaking down in tears on the campaign trail, describing her stress.Hanako Okada: (In Japanese/English translation) I remembered how tough it was to raise my child and I burst into tears. It was overwhelming. And viewers probably thought, I'm a politician who gets what ordinary people have to deal with.It was effective. She won unexpectedly, and Hana-san as she's called, is now something of a political change agent. She says confronting the population problem requires not dating apps and shortened workweeks but a sweeping mindset change. In particular: a rethinking of living in urban areas—as 92% of Japanese currently do.She practiced what she preaches, moving back to her rural hometown of Aomori, a northern prefecture known for its apple orchards — but one that is rapidly aging, rapidly losing people. Built for 600 students, this Aomori middle school is now only one-third filled. They still learn the traditional shamisen, but there are too few kids to field a soccer team. And a competitive snowball fight means recruiting a visiting ringer…Jon Wertheim: Why'd you return?Hanako Okada: (In Japanese/English translation) Aomori is my hometown. The precipitous drop in population, and vitality, of this city is deeply troubling not just personally but from a national perspective. If our regions collapse, it imperils our country's strength. I thought, we can't allow this situation to go on.Jon Wertheim: You've seen the math, I'm sure. Do you believe Japan can overcome this population crisis?Hanako Okada: (In Japanese/English translation) We need to stop the over-concentration of people in Tokyo. In the rural areas, we need interesting jobs with decent pay that allow young people to support themselves.Her thinking: once there are more jobs in rural areas, the younger people will come. Once they come—and experience the space, the slower rhythms, the quality of life—they'll be motivated to start families. Hanako Okada: (In Japanese/English translation) The values of our younger generation are gradually shifting. Tokyo is no longer the be-all end-all. One such Japanese family that agrees: the Katos. They recently exchanged city life for this spacious house in Ichinono, land of puppets. Their son Kuranosuke was the first baby born in the village in more than 20 years. Toshiki Kato: (In Japanese/English translation) We've got a mountain and a river to explore. We make our own toys and grow our own vegetables. For a kid, there's plenty of ways to have fun here.Jon Wertheim: You're happy here?Toshiki Kato: (In Japanese/English translation) Yes, I truly enjoy this lifestyle.The Katos hope others will follow, that Kuranosuke will have friends and classmates among all the town's dolls.Toshiki Kato: (In Japanese/English translation) It takes us back to our roots. I want Japanese people to become more aware of this lifestyle, which is closer to our traditional way of living. It might be a traditional Japanese lifestyle. But amid a population decline, it will be in a smaller, lonelier and fundamentally different Japan.Produced by Jacqueline Williams. Associate producer, Elizabeth Germino.

These strikes have killed hundreds of Huthi fighters and numerous Huthi leaders,\" the military command responsible for the Middle East said in a statement.\"The strikes have destroyed multiple command-and-control facilities, air defense systems, advanced weapons manufacturing facilities, and advanced weapons storage locations,\" CENTCOM said.Despite the strikes, the Huthis — who control large swaths of Yemen and have been at war with a Saudi-led coalition backing the internationally recognized government since 2015 — have continued to claim attacks against both US vessels and Israel.CENTCOM said that \"while the Huthis have continued to attack our vessels, our operations have degraded the pace and effectiveness of their attacks. Ballistic missile launches have dropped by 69 percent. Additionally, attacks from one-way attack drones have decreased by 55 percent.\"\"Iran undoubtedly continues to provide support to the Huthis. The Huthis can only continue to attack our forces with the backing of the Iranian regime,\" the military command said.\"We will continue to ratchet up the pressure until the objective is met, which remains the restoration of freedom of navigation and American deterrence in the region,\" it added.The Huthi rebels began targeting shipping in late 2023, claiming solidarity with Palestinians in the Gaza Strip, which has been devastated by a military campaign launched by Israel after a shock Hamas attack in October of that year.Huthi attacks have prevented ships from passing through the Suez Canal — a vital route that normally carries about 12 percent of the world's shipping traffic — forcing many companies into a costly detour around the tip of southern Africa.The United States first began conducting strikes against the Huthis under the Biden administration, and President Donald Trump has vowed that military action against the rebels will continue until they are no longer a threat to shipping.","summary":"","url":"https://tribune.net.ph/2025/04/27/us-struck-800-targets-in-yemen-killed-100s-of-huthis-since-15-march-us-military","image":"https://media.assettype.com/tribune/2025-03-16/o164pzng/000372G9FM.jpg?w=1200&h=675&auto=format%2Ccompress&fit=max&enlarge=true","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-27 23:57:46","author":"Agence France-Presse","authors":["Agence France-Presse"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"ph","sentiment":-0.02},{"id":315452880,"title":"Bezo’s $500m yacht ahoy","text":"Mallorca welcomed a mega-wealthy visitor on April 25 as Jeff Bezos’ $500 million sailing yacht, Koru, anchored off its shores at the end of its latest transatlantic journey.\n\nThe Amazon founder’s 138-metre vessel, with three 70-metre masts, a navy-blue hull, and a custom pool, is en route to Venice for Bezos’ wedding to Lauren Sánchez on June 24.

Email jose.ramos@mailonline.co.uk \nBy JOSE RAMOS \n Published:00:49 BST, 28 April 2025 |Updated:00:53 BST, 28 April 2025 \n\nBeneath the shadow of Michelangelo's dome, a quiet sentinel stands.\nClad in vibrant Renaissance-era stripes of blue, red, and gold, the soldier could be mistaken for a character from a living museum.\nBut don't let the pageantry fool you — this is no costume. This is the Pontifical Swiss Guard: called the world's smallest army, and one of its oldest, elite, and most storied.\nThey have pledged allegiance to the Pope, and have sworn to protect them even if it means laying their life down.\nAs part of their role they guard the buildings in Vatican City such as the Apostolic Palace, the Vatican Museum and St Peter's Basilica.\nAlthough not a police force, they do have the authority to enforce rules and regulations within the Vatican walls. This means they can stop people from entering restricted areas.\nBut for guards, their job is not just to serve the Pontiff with their life, it is a far more meaningful calling, which goes to the heart of their Catholic faith.\nFor Mario Enzler, a Swiss citizen born and raised in a town in northern Italy just outside Milan, who served in the force under Pope John Paul II, from 1989 to 1993, it caused a 'transformation' in his life.\n\nFor Mario Enzler, a Swiss citizen born and raised a town in northern Italy just outside Milan, who served in the force under Pope John Paul II, it caused a 'transformation' in his life\n\nMario was a Swiss Guard and a bodyguard while John Paul II was the Pope between 1989 and 1993\n\nFor Mario, left, during those five year he had a first-hand account of walking alongside the Pope for much of his time which meant the two became very close\nSwitzerland follows a principle which means citizenship is passed down by descent, not by birth place, which means for Mario, he was a Swiss citizen because his father was Swiss.\nDespite being over 30 years since he left, having had a career in banking and now working in the United States, he said: 'My experience with the Swiss Guard—how I ended up joining, the opportunities I embraced, and the benefits I gained—continues to shape me.\n'I still carry those lessons with me and try to share as many stories and insights as I can, because it was truly a transformative experience.'\nHe told MailOnline his time in the service looked different as he went on. Unlike the King's Guards, the Swiss Guard also serve as the Pope's bodyguards and therefore follow him wherever he goes.\nSo for Mario, those five years were not just spent standing guard outside St Peter's Basilica, he had a first-hand account of walking alongside the Pope for much of his time which meant the two became very close.\n'You really establish a relationship with the Supreme Pontiff, that transcends exclusivity of the security scope,' he said.\nThere a number of times which he will remember such as when he came face to face with a man claiming to Jesus Christ himself, when the Pope was ignored by journalists whilst meeting President Bush senior, or when James Bond star Sean Connery asked to take a picture whilst Mario was on his guard shift.\nWhat makes the role of a guard so special for those who join is the history the role carries.\n\nWhile now working at the Heritage Foundation in Washington D.C. as an adviser to President Trump, Mario remains in touch with many of his former Swiss Guard colleagues \n\nAlthough not a police force, the guards have the authority to enforce rules and regulations within the Vatican walls. Pictured: Stock image of Swiss Guard at St Peters' Square\n\nDuring the Middle Ages, Swiss mercenaries were valued for their combat skills and began serving the Church in the 14th and 15th centuries. The Swiss Guard was formally established by Pope Julius II in 1506.\nThe role of the Swiss Guard is steeped in history. During the Middle Ages, Swiss mercenaries were valued for their combat skills and began serving the Church in the 14th and 15th centuries. The Swiss Guard was formally established by Pope Julius II in 1506.\nTo join, recruits must be between 19 and 30, at least 5'8' tall, and have a professional diploma or degree.\nTraining includes weapons handling, tactics, personal defence techniques, and psychological endurance to handle difficult situations.\nAlthough they carry halberds or swords, when it comes to protecting the Pontiff, all soldiers carry guns which they'll use, if forced. \nFor Mario, a Catholic young man, he had just finished school and wanted to become a musician, but he joined the force after a suggestion from his father.\n'While I was in training for 17 weeks, someone mentioned an opening in the Swiss Guard. \n'At first, I said, \"No, thank you.\" I just couldn't picture myself standing still on cobblestones, not moving, not speaking—that's what I thought the Swiss Guards were: rigid, strong men who stood silently on watch.\n'That was the image I had growing up, visiting St. Peter's and seeing the guards up close.\n'But the more I thought about it—the chance to go to Rome, to live in the Vatican, to learn about Church policy, and to witness the deep faith of His Holiness—I became intrigued. \n'So, I said yes. And when I finished my 17 weeks of training, instead of heading back to northern Italy I went straight to Rome.'\n\nMario said: 'But the more I thought about it—the chance to go to Rome, to live in the Vatican, to learn about Church policy, and to witness the deep faith of His Holiness—I became intrigued'\n\n'I didn't know exactly who he was,' Mario said of the Pope, 'but I knew, without a doubt, that whatever he had… I wanted it.\nFrom the first encounter, Mario felt an undeniable pull to the Pope. \n'I didn't know exactly who he was,' Mario recalled, 'but I knew, without a doubt, that whatever he had… I wanted it.'\nHe added: 'But when you're there you understand it's not just an opportunity for a young man to promise to give up his life for the Pope but it's an opportunity to really understand what it means to be Catholic and how Catholic should or must behave.'\nHe added: 'It was an opportunity to strengthen my faith, and to find that God is in pursuit of you, so you can be in pursuit of others. \n'That's what John Paul II showed me—he was authentically following God's plan and will as I am sure Pope Benedict and Pope Francis did.'\nThe job offered countless moments of connection, like when he stood on duty when he came face to face with a man claiming to be Jesus Christ himself.\n\nSwitzerland follows a principle which means citizenship is passed down by descent, not by birth place. Pictured: Stock image of Swiss guard \n\nA Swiss Guard stands by as Pope John Paul II cheers from his popemobile in St Peters' Square. Picture: Stock image\n\n Moment crying nun who knew Pope Francis is allowed to break protocol and stand beside his coffin \nIt happened during a routine shift, a man approached him with quiet intensity and said, 'I'd like to tell your boss that he can go home.'\nMario, unsure of what to make of it replied: 'Which boss? I have several.'\n'No, no,' he said. 'All the way to the top. I am Jesus Christ and I am back. And I need to tell the Pope he can go back to Poland—I don't need him anymore.'\nThere was a pause, the kind that stretches wider than the square itself. Mario, trained in discipline and diplomacy, kept his composure, 'well, the Pope isn't available at the moment. But if you'd like to leave your number, I'll be sure to have him give you a call.'\nMario was in the room when the Pontiff met George H W Bush and after the two met in private and came out to speak to journalists.\n'When the two came out and they came to speak to American journalists and priests I remember they spoke for a little bit and then afterwards the American media wanted to ask the President questions about home affairs. They surrounded the President, to the point where the poor Father was trampled all over. We had to surround the Pope to make sure no one injured him. \n'And it was a moment which really showed his humility because when the President had left and we apologised to him for what had happened, the Pope replied with \"It's understandable. I am just a priest.\"'\nOn another occasion, he was guarding one of the buildings when out of the door accompanied by one of the priests was James Bond actor Sean Connery.\nMario said: 'He came out with one of the priests, I don't know if he had met the Pope, but when he saw me he asked to take a picture of me. \n'I was in my 20s and in duty so at first I thought I recognised him but I realised it was him. It was one of those strange moments, because he was so excited to see me, even though I was just a guard. He didn't say much and quickly went on his way.' \nFor Mario, the magic and importance of the role, also meant he was able to build a friendship with Pope John Paul and get to know him so well, he was able to tell what he was thinking.\n'You get to know him so well that the Pope can give you a look, and you just know he's about to go somewhere unexpected.\n'He realises it's not what you were anticipating—but he goes anyway. Maybe we're in public and you're here and he needs to go over there to meet a group of nuns he wants to visit. And in that moment, you know there's no stopping him.\n\nMario explained: 'You get to know him so well that the Pope can give you a look, and you just know he's about to go somewhere unexpected.' Pictured: Swiss Guards stand in protection of Pope John-Paul II\n\nPope John Paul II meeting the Swiss Guard who have pledged to protect the Pontiff\n\n How Pope Francis's unconventional funeral will draw in world leaders as the Pontiff is laid to rest \n'Unlike say the Secret Service, who can tell the President not to go somewhere because of security, with the Pontiff, if he wants to go somewhere, he will go and all you have to do is follow him.'\nAs men in their twenties, their only escape from the seriousness of their post was often found, as you'd expect, in bars and even had a drink of choice.\n'There was an Irish pub the guards always went, and would go there since it opened in the late seventies. \n'And the people there would always tell us to get a white Guinness and they called it a blonde. \n'They would then get a small shot of, what I think was Jack Daniels, and drop it in the beer.\n'It was always a lot of fun and there was always someone with a guitar and singing and that was how we often spent the free time we had with each other.'\nOver 30 years after leaving the force, now married to his wife Julie, who he met whilst she was studying in Rome, the father-of-five and grandfather-of-four is now thousands of miles away from Rome.\nWhile now working at the Heritage Foundation in Washington D.C. as an adviser to President Trump, Mario remains in touch with many of his former Swiss Guard colleagues.\nEarlier this week, when the news of Pope Francis' death sent waves of sorrow across the globe, Mario reflected on the immediate effects it had on the Vatican. \n'It's crazy because everything is up in the air. You have to understand that when the Pope dies, everyone loses their job, and the chair is now vacant. \n'And now everyone is running around because of the funeral and the preparations which need to be made for it.' \n\nAs the final preparations for the funeral unfold and cardinals descend on the 121 acres of land to prepare for the conclave, one question weighs heavily on everyone's mind: who will succeed Francis, the 'Pope of the People,' as Mario described him?\n\nMario said the responsibility now lies with the cardinals, who, in the coming days, will reflect deeply on the future direction of the Church\n\nMario said: 'The decision is on them. They must listen to the voice of the Lord and decide which way the Church should go. I don't know who it could be'\n\n Fury at 'disrespectful' mourners taking selfies with the Pope's corpse \nAs the final preparations for the funeral unfold and cardinals descend on the 121 acres of land to prepare for the conclave, one question weighs heavily on everyone's mind: who will succeed Francis, the 'Pope of the People,' as Mario described him?\nMario said the responsibility now lies with the cardinals, who, in the coming days, will reflect deeply on the future direction of the Church.\n'The decision is on them. They must listen to the voice of the Lord and decide which way the Church should go. I don't know who it could be. \n'There is a lot of conversations about the possibilities of being this person or that person but no one really knows.'\nWhen asked if the Church is ready for the election of the first Asian or Black Pope, Mario pauses for a moment, his gaze thoughtful. \nThe direct answer is I don't know,' he admits. 'My gut says we might be ready, but not fully. There could be another Pope before that time comes. I could be wrong.'\nHe then shifts the conversation to the modern dynamics influencing the process, pointing out that the rise of social media adds a new layer of complexity to the conclave. \n'This conclave is different from any other,' Mario says. 'It's crazy now because of the overwhelming influence from social media and the media.'\nDespite these modern challenges, Mario urges the cardinals to remain focused as they head into the Sistine Chapel to choose Francis' successor.\n'What I am urging the cardinals, whom I know and speak to, is to concentrate on the task at hand: to silence any interfering voices and simply listen to the voice of the Lord. \n'Spend time in front of the Blessed Sacrament and ask, \"Where do we want the Church to go?\"'\nAs the Church prepares for a pivotal moment in its history, Mario's reflections serve as a poignant reminder of the weight of responsibility resting on the cardinals' shoulders—and the deep faith that must guide their decision. \nAs many of his previous colleagues still serving as guards, he will be looking to them to make the decision of their next Shepherd who will guide them into, what many will say, is a world looking for a leader, a light and hope.\nJames BondItalySean Connery\n\nShare or comment on this article: \nI was in the Swiss Guard... here is what it's REALLY like to be the Pope's bodyguard\n\nAdd comment\n\n Share what you think\n\nNo comments have so far been submitted.

Sam Antar, who kept the books for his cousin, \"Crazy Eddie\" Antar, while he built a New York-area consumer electronics empire, helped his late relative skim cash and inflate the value of their company before leaving investors high and dry in the late 1980s. He says he knows every trick in the fraud book and smells a rat in James' real estate filings. \"I don't know how the wheels of justice will turn and, to be frank, I don't care as long as I'm right,\" said Antar, who has made his findings public. \"If they fail to convict her, it's their humiliation and their embarrassment.\" Antar pleaded guilty to multiple felonies, cooperating with prosecutors to help convict his cousin, whose chain's ads featured a maniacal pitchman pledging, \"Our prices are insane!\" While Eddie Antar fled to Israel, was extradited back to the U.S. and served time before dying in 2016, Sam Antar reinvented himself as a fraud expert for government agencies and law firms. He runs a website where he posts about his various investigations. ‘PLAYING WITH THE COURTS’: TRUMP ADMIN HIT WITH DOZENS OF SUITS AFTER YEARS OF PRESIDENT CONDEMNING ‘LAWFARE’ In an exclusive interview with Fox News Digital, Antar said he worked alone and was the first to unearth documentation of James’ alleged mortgage fraud and posted it to his White Collar Fraud website weeks ago. He said the strength of his findings, backed by his renowned reputation in the field of uncovering white-collar fraud for the government, eventually led to the Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) picking up the case and sending a criminal referral to the Justice Department. \"It's not the Trump administration at war with Tish James, it's me bringing her to accountability and justice,\" Antar told Fox News Digital. \"I'm not the Trump administration. I was investigating Tish James because that is what I do.\" \"I took all kinds of risks doing it, from retaliation, to libel, to reputational risk. But I stand by everything.\" Antar said his findings were all uncovered independently by him and that he is not working for the government by looking into James. Fox News Digital asked the FHFA and the White House to corroborate his claims but did not receive a response. \"Everything that I've done is thoroughly documented,\" said Antar, who said he's a Democrat. \"This is not bullying. This is not the Trump administration at war. Trump has his own agenda. I don't care. I am not Donald Trump. All I did was, I did my forensic accounting and I thoroughly documented everything that I did.\" Antar’s investigations uncovered documents stretching back as far as 1983, which he said indicate James may have been misrepresenting her financial situation for decades in order to nail sweetheart loans from lenders. The FHFA accuses James of falsifying records to meet certain lending requirements and score favorable loan terms. James, 66, denies the allegations and claims Trump is behind the move, calling it a \"revenge tour\" for the $454 million civil fraud lawsuit she successfully spearheaded against him last year. Trump and the Trump Organization are currently appealing. In Trump's civil fraud case, the then-presidential candidate was accused of financial misrepresentation and providing false statements about his real estate, the same types of crimes James is being accused of by the FHFA. Antar told Fox News Digital that he started digging into James’ records months ago after he looked into the costs of her private flight travel as attorney general. Property in Sterling Street, Norfolk, VA In the criminal referral letter sent to the Justice Department, FHFA Director William Pult cited a property in Virginia that James allegedly claimed as her principal residence in 2023 despite being a public office holder in New York at that same time. She bought the property around the time the Trump trial was getting underway. The FHFA said primary residence mortgages receive more favorable loan terms, including lower interest rates, compared to secondary residence mortgages. In her mortgage documents, James reaffirmed this would be her primary residence, Antar said. \"She gave her relative power of attorney and declared, in a notarized document, that she intended to make the property her primary residence,\" Antar said. \"If that’s true, she’d be disqualified from holding office in New York. Neither she nor the relative filed for a homestead exemption, yet the mortgage was issued under the condition that both would live there. That’s how she got favorable terms.\" A building permit issued on James’ New York property on July 15, 2024, lists that property as the \"JAMES RESIDENCE\" and states \"Remain Occupied,\" according to the FHFA letter. James' office told Fox News Digital that she has been clear that she is not using the Virginia home as her primary residence because she lives in New York. In a letter to the Justice Department this week, James' lawyers told Attorney General Pam Bondi that while the power-of-attorney form \"mistakenly stated the property to be Ms. James’ principal residence,\" Pult \"absolutely ignored\" an all-caps statement to the mortgage loan broker two weeks prior that the property \"WILL NOT be my primary residence\" but would rather be the primary residence of her niece. James' attorney, Abbe Lowell, said emails showed the mortgage broker understood this. Property in Brooklyn, NY In 2001, James purchased a property in Brooklyn with its certificate of occupancy listing the property as having five units, but James, the FHFA said, consistently misrepresented the same property as having four units in both building permit applications and numerous mortgage documents and applications. This enabled James to get a lower mortgage interest rate, known as a conforming loan, since conforming loans are only available on four-unit or fewer structures. COURT NAMES NEW JUDGE IN TRUMP CIVIL FRAUD CASE BEFORE REASSIGNING PREVIOUS JUDGE HOURS LATER She also netted mortgage assistance through the Home Affordable Modification Program, a government-run program that provides homeowners at risk of foreclosure with reduced monthly mortgage payments and recipients had to have properties with four dwellings or fewer, the referral states. James' lawyers told Bondi that the residence \"has four floors and, for as long as Ms. James has lived there, the property has always functioned as a four-person residence.\" The certificate of occupancy for the property listed online still shows the 2001 version, listed as five units. The DOB told Fox News Digital that that document is the most recent certificate of occupancy they have on file for that building. James’ office told Fox News that James has been clear in her filings that the property is a four-unit dwelling and that the previous owner listed the property as a five-unit before she purchased it in 2001. WATCH: Letitia James facing fraud accusations: There's some real smoke here Mortgages with father listed as her husband Meanwhile, James, who never married, is also accused of saying her father was her husband to obtain two mortgages in Queens as a married couple. The documents allegedly show that the property James purchased with her father had both parties listed as \"husband and wife\" in 1983 and 2000. \"While this was a long time ago, it raises serious concerns about the validity of Ms. James representations on mortgage applications,\" Pulte wrote. Lowell, who accused the FHFA of \"cherry-picking,\" writes the deed lists her father \"and Letitia James, his daughter.'\" \"As I have set forth, the exhibits Director Pulte included with his letter are notable for the fact that he omitted numerous other records (some of which we have included) which refute the allegations of impropriety, and make clear that a mistake on one line had no significance,\" Lowell wrote. \"If there is anything that you believe I have not addressed in the real facts and documents provided, please let me know. Otherwise, we would expect a quick response confirming that this referral matter has been closed by the Department.\" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Antar, meanwhile, continues to back his findings. \"I documented everything that I did,\" he said. \"And I stand by everything I did.

However, they have found themselves treading a delicate line between firmly dismissing U.S. ambitions of annexing Greenland while also trying to maintain good ties with their traditional ally.\n\n“We are ready for a strong partnership (with the U.S.) and more development, but we want respect … We will never be a piece of property that can be bought by anyone,” Nielsen said.\n\nHe said an ongoing expansion of the U.S. consulate in Nuuk, Greenland’s capital, which was agreed before Trump took office, was causing anxiety among the people of Greenland.\n\nNielsen did not confirm or deny when asked if he had been in contact with the U.S. administration since taking office earlier this month.\n\nThe warmer relations between Nuuk and Copenhagen come after Greenland’s previous prime minister in December blamed Denmark for a historical “genocide” in Greenland and in January stepped up a push for independence from Denmark.\n\nFrederiksen said Denmark was ready to invest more in Greenland and to support Greenland financially as it takes over more responsibility of domestic affairs from Copenhagen as part of what she called a “modernisation” of their relationship.\n\nDenmark has called for increased Arctic defence collaboration with the United States, and both Nielsen and Frederiksen said on Sunday they were committed to strengthening defence in the region.\n\nDenmark’s King Frederik will travel to Greenland on Monday in a further show of solidarity.","summary":"COPENHAGEN >> Greenland and Denmark agreed on Sunday to strengthen their ties in response to President Donald Trump&#8217;s interest in taking control of the strategically located Arctic island, their leaders said after talks in Copenhagen.","url":"https://www.staradvertiser.com/2025/04/27/breaking-news/greenland-denmark-affirm-alliance-amid-trumps-interest-in-u-s-control/","image":"https://www.staradvertiser.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/web1_2025-04-27T212824Z_95892203_RC2F6EA5M8IK_RTRMADP_3_GREENLAND-DENMARK.JPG","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-27 23:52:00","author":"Reuters","authors":["Reuters"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.342},{"id":315452826,"title":"Singapore banks dominate surge in share buybacks","text":"The value of buybacks by DBS Group Holdings Ltd, Singapore’s largest bank, account for nearly half of all the stock repurchases in Singapore from April 1 to April 23, followed by United Overseas Bank Ltd at 25% and Oversea-Chinese Banking Corp at just over 8%, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.\n\nSingapore banks, among the most well capitalised in the region, pledged in recent months to hand over billions of dollars in surplus capital to investors on the back of record-high earnings. Such action came in handy during global stock selloffs triggered by US President Donald Trump’s tariff measures.\n\nLenders make up bulk of buybacks in Singapore\n\nElsewhere, banks emerged as the biggest contributors to buybacks in Europe, while share repurchase plans announced in China this month have reached the most since a stock rout in February 2024.\n\nMaybank analyst Thilan Wickramasinghe said Singapore lenders have been carrying excess capital for some time, despite spending on recent deals and integrating them. However, he noted there may be risks that capital returns could be reassessed given the heightened uncertainty in the operating environment.\n\nShares of DBS, UOB and OCBC fell to multi-month lows earlier this month as they joined a plunge in global equities, before paring losses.\n\nInvestors are still concerned that weak economic growth would lead to interest rate cuts and impact banks’ lending margins. Singapore banks report quarterly results next month.\n\nMorgan Stanley’s Southeast Asian analysts led by Nick Lord slashed earnings estimates of Singapore lenders by up to 11% for 2025, and 8%-11% for 2026. The bank said in a report that the main driver of the changes in estimates for 2025 is a “pre-emptive provision charge based on deteriorating macro economic variables.”\n\nDespite the cut to earnings forecasts, Morgan Stanley left capital return forecasts unchanged as it expects the banks’ “fully loaded” common equity Tier 1 ratios to remain healthy, part due to lower loan growth and still-robust return on equity.\n\nMeanwhile, Goldman Sachs maintained a buy rating on the three banks, saying it favours stocks with “robust and sustainable profitability and the capability to increase capital returns.” It expects excess capital for the trio to build up by 2027, given that the lenders remain capital generative.\n\nJefferies analyst Sam Wong said that given that all three lenders are trading above their book value, buyback is not the most value accretive form of shareholder return.\n\n“That said, a buyback mandate would allow the banks to provide some stability to share price in an uncertain environment, and to develop a more sticky investor base (versus any one-off special div),” Wong said in an email.","summary":"Lenders capitalise on stock price weakness, driving corporate repurchases to the highest level in four years.","url":"https://www.freemalaysiatoday.com/category/business/2025/04/28/singapore-banks-dominate-surge-in-share-buybacks/","image":"https://media.freemalaysiatoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/571b486c-singapore-banks_1600x1000.webp","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-27 23:49:39","author":"Bloomberg,Dbs Group Holdings","authors":["Bloomberg","Dbs Group Holdings"],"language":"en","source_country":"my","sentiment":-0.214},{"id":315457616,"title":"Zelensky Might Be Willing to Give Up Crimea, Trump Hints","text":"US President Donald Trump said Sunday night that his meeting with President Volodymyr Zelensky in the Vatican “went well” and that the next few days would prove whether there was a progress, Kyiv Post’s Washington correspondent reports.\n\n“It was a nice meeting, it was a beautiful meeting,” Trump told reporters at the Morristown airport in New Jersey before departing to the White House.\n\nThe pair met privately in St. Peter’s Basilica on Saturday on the sidelines of Pope Francis’s funeral. It was their first in person interaction since their February Oval Office meeting devolved into a heated argument in front of cameras.\n\nTrump in response to reporters’ questions on Sunday went on to describe the Ukrainian leader as “calmer”. \n\n“I think he understands the picture, and I think he wants to make a deal,” he said.\n\nHe later added that Zelensky “wants to do something good for his country, thinks he’s doing a good job, and he’s working hard. We’ll see what happens.”\n\n“I think what happens over the next few days we’ll learn a lot,” he emphasized immediately. “We have a tough road ahead.”\n\nTrump reviled that Zelensky asked for more weapons: “But he’s been saying that for three years he needs more weapons. And we’re going to see what happens. I want to see what happens with respect to Russia.”\n\nAs for Kremlin leader Vladimir Putin, the US message to him is to stop shooting: “I want him to stop shooting, sit down and sign a deal... We have the confines of a deal I believe. And I want him to sign it,” Trump said.\n\nTrump also added he was “disappointed” with Russia, hinting to last week’s deadly strikes on Kyiv, but has not said if further action might be taken against Moscow.\n\n“I think we’re more respected now as a country, maybe than ever before. There’s no more games. You have somebody that knows what he’s doing, not like the previous person” he said when pressed about potential actions against Russia.

Earlier, he was at The Creative Coalition Right To Bear Arts Gala dinner at The Madison Hotel and at the White House Correspondents Weekend Garden Brunch on Saturday morning before the main event.\n\nThe packed brunch, masterminded by Tammy Haddad, CEO of Haddad Media, and hosts Kevin Sheekey, David Urban, Teresa Carlson and Franco Nuschese was held at the late, legendary Washington Post owner Katherine Graham’s former mansion in Georgetown. It was once owned by George Washington’s great-grandnephew, and by William “Wild Bill” Donovan, who founded the Office of Strategic Services, the agency that preceded the CIA. \n\nThe gorgeous home that once hosted the likes of JFK, Princess Diana and Ronald Reagan is now owned by venture capitalist and Washington Commanders part-owner Mark Ein and his wife Sally, who also co-hosted.\n\nThroughout the weekend, there was a president’s name that was never mentioned, despite being on everyone’s thoughts, not least because of his absence and that of his acolytes. It’s the kind of taboo that Isaacs knows too well. As Lucius Malfoy, Draco Malfoy’s Death Eater father in the Harry Potter movies, Isaacs would have been aware of, “He who must not be named.”\n\nAccording to author J.K. Rowling’s novels, Voldemort’s name represented his terror and his power, so people were afraid to say it out loud.\n\nIsaacs maintained the tradition in not naming Trump in a speech paying tribute to the firefighters and emergency responders called to the deadly Jan. 29 plane crash in D.C. \n\nIsaacs has been twice before to the correspondents’ dinner, and said he heard moving speeches by Barack Obama and Joe Biden.\n\nBut he made no secret of his feelings towards the current U.S. president, referencing “someone who will not be here tonight” as a “scumbag.”\n\nIsaacs’ antipathy towards the president is not entirely new. Appearing on MSNBC’s Morning Joe to promote the latest season of The White Lotus, in which he plays troubled businessman Timothy Ratliff, the actor remarked: “Sorry, we’re talking about a television show, but there is a tie-in. I am playing an enormously wealthy and self-centered person who has really only thought about himself for most of his life.”\n\nEr yes. But then again everything is not always what it seems.

President Donald Trump has said that the U.S. needs to own Greenland to cover a number of global security concerns related to China and Russia and the Arctic Circle.Greenland's Prime Minister Jens-Frederik Nielsen has repeatedly said that \"the United States will not get Greenland,\" stressing: \"We don't belong to anyone else. We decide our own future.\"Vice President JD Vance and his wife Usha recently visited Greenland, which Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen criticized as placing \"unacceptable pressure\" on Greenland and Denmark. Vance during his visit criticized Denmark for not having \"done a good job by the people of Greenland.\"Greenland also has healthy reserves of minerals, making it of great interest to the U.S., along with Ukraine's mineral reserves, which the U.S. has targeted as a precondition to a peace deal with Russia in its ongoing war.What To KnowNielsen spoke Sunday alongside his Danish counterpart to address reporters during his three-day visit to Denmark.Nielsen used the moment to address talks with the U.S., which he said had \"not been respectful,\" explaining: \"The words use have not been respectful. That's why we need in this situation, we need to stand together,\" referring to stronger ties between Greenland and Denmark.\"It is important that we make plans for our future cooperation in these times,\" Nielsen said.The remarks follow a decision from political parties in Greenland to form a broad-based coalition that will resist Trump's ambitions for the territory.\"Denmark has the will to invest in the Greenlandic society, and we don't just have that for historical reasons. We also have that because we are part of (the Danish) commonwealth with each other,\" Frederiksen said. \"We of course have a will to also continue investing in the Greenlandic society.\"Frederiksen told reporters that Denmark will \"always want to meet with the American president,\" but stressed that her country \"have been very, very clear in what is the (Danish commonwealth's) approach to all parts of the Kingdom of Denmark.\"In addition to Greenland, Denmark controls the Faroe Islands, with all three forming the total Kingdom of Denmark.Meanwhile, in a poll conducted between January 22 and 26 by Verian for Danish newspaper Berlingske and Greenlandic newspaper Sermitsiaqt, 85 percent of respondents said they do not support joining the U.S., while only 6 percent said they would back such a move and 9 percent said they were undecided.The poll, which surveyed 497 Greenlanders, revealed 45 percent of respondents said they view Trump's interest in their territory as a threat, while only 8 percent would accept a U.S. passport if given the choice between American and Danish citizenship.However, most Greenlanders are also in favor of independence from Denmark, something Trump seems to be trying to leverage. He said in a speech on March 5: \"We strongly support your right to determine your own future. And if you choose, we welcome you into the United States of America.\"What People Are SayingPresident Donald Trump during a press conference alongside Norwegian Prime Minister Jonas Gahr Støre last week said: \"I think we need that for international peace, and if we don't have that it's a big threat to our world. So I think Greenland is very important for international peace.\"Vice President JD Vance during his visit to Greenland said: \"We know that Russia and China and other nations are taking an extraordinary interest in Arctic passageways and Arctic naval routes and indeed in the minerals of the Arctic territories. We need to ensure that America is leading in the Arctic, because we know that if America doesn't other nations will fill the gap where we fall behind.\"What Happens Next?Nielsen will visit Danish King Frederik X on Monday before returning to Greenland with Frederiksen to tour the territory.This article includes reporting by The Associated Press.","summary":"President Donald Trump has repeatedly stressed that he views obtaining Greenland as a vital piece of American foreign policy.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/greenland-pm-rebukes-trumps-rhetoric-he-presses-closer-denmark-ties-2064818","image":"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2634157/greenland-denmark-prime-minister-conference.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-27 23:40:22","author":"Peter Aitken","authors":["Peter Aitken"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.037},{"id":315455604,"title":"DJT Stock Soars 57% as Trump Media Expands Into Financial Services","text":"Trump Media and Technology Soars 57% in 2 weeks with Support from New Deals with Crypto.com and ... More Yorkville America Digital\nEntrepreneurShares LLC\n\nTrump Media & Technology Group (NASDAQ: DJT) has delivered a stunning stock market performance in recent weeks. Since April 8, DJT shares have rocketed roughly +57%, making it the #1 stock in the Russell 1000 Growth Index over that period and outperforming the second-best performer by about 10 percentage points. The stock jumped from about $16.66 on April 8 to $26.14 by April 25.\n\nSuch a meteoric rise evokes memories of meme-stock short squeezes — and indeed, DJT’s past rallies have featured that dynamic — but this time a different force is at work. Rather than a flash-in-the-pan frenzy, the surge in DJT appears driven by ambitious growth moves and strategic partnerships, not just a short squeeze. The company is leveraging its Trump-brand loyal following and expanding into financial services in ways that could signal significant long-term opportunity.\n\nMarket-Beating Rally Fueled by Fundamentals, Not Frenzy\n\nDJT stock price surged in April 2025, far outpacing the broader market and its peers.\n\nDJT’s recent rally has been nothing short of remarkable. In a span of just over two weeks, the stock price climbed nearly 60%, decisively beating not only the broader market but every other name in the large-cap growth index. Historically, such explosive moves in Trump-linked stocks have often been attributed to technical market mechanics — notably short sellers getting squeezed. Last autumn, for example, Trump Media’s stock saw a triple-digit percentage spike largely due to a classic short squeeze as speculators betting against the company found few shares available to buy back.\n\nDonald Trump owns roughly 57% of the company’s stock, a stake unlikely to trade anytime soon, which severely limited the float and turbocharged that squeeze.\n\nThis time around, however, many analysts agree the primary catalyst isn’t a short squeeze. Yes, there are still skeptics shorting DJT — and with Trump’s large insider ownership, any increase in short interest could quickly become precarious for them. But the current buying pressure is coming from concrete business developments and investor optimism about new revenue streams, rather than a sudden rush of shorts covering positions. In other words, the market is rallying behind DJT’s growth story, not just a trading technicality.\n\nBig Moves: Financial Services Expansion with Yorkville America Digital and Crypto.com\n\nA major catalyst is the recent announcement that Yorkville America Digital has signed a strategic partnership agreement with Trump Media & Technology Group (TMTG) and Crypto.com to launch a series of exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and exchange-traded products (ETPs) through the Truth.Fi brand. The initial ETPs are expected to focus on cryptocurrencies, bringing together powerful brands and marketing reach to a fast-growing financial sector.\n\nMORE FOR YOU\n\n‘Major’ U.S. Dollar Fed Warning Braces Bitcoin For A BlackRock ‘Megaforce’ Price Shock\n\nTesla, Looking To Boost Sales, Has A New Killer Model 3 Lease\n\nTrump Approval Rating Tracker: Majority Don’t Approve Of Trump’s Handling Of Inflation, Border And Trade\n\nAccording to public statements, TMTG CEO Devin Nunes described the agreement as a major step in diversifying TMTG into financial services and digital assets. Yorkville America Digital CEO Troy Rillo also emphasized that the new products would align with America-First investment themes and anticipated strong demand from investors once the ETFs launch later this year.\n\nThis strategic partnership leverages the brand power of TMTG, the financial expertise of Yorkville America Digital, and the technological infrastructure of Crypto.com. It marks a decisive step for TMTG, moving beyond media into the lucrative world of financial products with minimal capital outlay and maximum brand leverage.\n\nIn recent weeks, there has been a flurry of public announcements from Troy Rillo, CEO of Yorkville America Digital, who has announced deals with Crypto.com, SMA partnerships, and other forthcoming ETF offerings. These moves reflect an ambitious and aggressive push into financial services, offering new product lines that could rapidly generate fee-based revenue streams for Trump Media.\n\nFor investors, these moves into fintech represent a dramatic broadening of Trump Media’s business model. The company best known for Truth Social and Truth+ streaming is now positioning itself to capture a slice of the booming ETF and crypto investment market. The global ETF market exceeds $10 trillion in assets, so even a small foothold could translate into significant revenue for TMTG via management fees or partnerships.\n\nLeveraging the Trump Brand’s Loyal Following in a Crowded Market\n\nOne of the strategic aces up TMTG’s sleeve is the Trump brand itself – and the unusually loyal following that comes with it. In the ultra-competitive world of ETFs and crypto offerings, garnering investor attention is half the battle.\n\nMillions of supporters of Donald Trump have a cultural or ideological affinity for his ventures, and that could translate into immediate demand for products like Truth.Fi’s “patriotic” investment funds. This unique audience gives Trump Media a critical distribution and marketing advantage that most new entrants could never replicate.\n\nMoreover, Truth Social already attracts many crypto enthusiasts (drawn by pro-freedom, anti-establishment sentiments), and TMTG can cross-promote Truth.Fi products to those users at minimal cost. In a world where dozens of crypto ETFs and hundreds of altcoins compete for attention, a high-profile name like “Trump” attached to an investment vehicle provides instant differentiation.\n\nHigh-Margin Strategy: Partnerships with Infinite ROI\n\nBeyond the brand cachet, Trump Media’s approach to entering new markets is notable for its capital efficiency. Rather than building an entire financial services arm from scratch, TMTG is partnering with established players to do the heavy lifting — while it provides the brand and audience.\n\nThis kind of model can be extremely high-margin. Essentially, every dollar of revenue generated from, say, an ETF fee or a trading spread on Crypto.com, comes with minimal incremental cost for TMTG. The infrastructure and operational expenses are borne by partners, so Trump Media’s share of the economics is almost pure profit. It’s the concept of an “infinite ROI” — leveraging someone else’s investment to generate returns for your company.\n\nA classic analogy is Dell’s strategy: Dell would bundle third-party peripherals (like monitors, printers, and accessories made by other companies) with its computers and sell them to customers. Dell didn’t spend a dime on developing those peripherals, yet it earned a margin on each sale — an essentially infinite return on that portion of the transaction.\n\nTrump Media is employing a similar playbook. By partnering with Yorkville America Digital and Crypto.com, it can offer financial products under the Truth.Fi brand without bearing the full development cost. Revenues from these products (such as fund management fees or revenue-sharing on trading activity) drop straight to the bottom line for TMTG.\n\nImportantly, this strategy also accelerates time-to-market and reduces execution risk. Instead of spending years and tens of millions of dollars building a crypto trading platform or ETF team, TMTG plugged into partners that already have these capabilities.\n\nBig Upside on the Horizon — And a Short Squeeze Wildcard\n\nWhat does all this mean for DJT’s future? In short, substantial potential upside. The company’s core social media business (Truth Social) has yet to prove it can generate massive revenues, but these new financial ventures could open multiple new income streams.\n\nIf even one of the Truth.Fi ETFs attracts significant assets, it could mean millions in annual fee revenue for TMTG with very little incremental expense. There are virtually endless possibilities for additional financial products (think crypto lending, payments, or co-branded credit cards) that could be introduced leveraging the same partnership-driven model.\n\nIt’s also worth noting that while this rally isn’t primarily a short squeeze, the ingredients for one are still in place. Donald Trump’s large ownership stake (over half the company) means the effective float of tradable shares is limited, so any surge in demand could send shorts scrambling to cover.\n\nBy focusing on fundamentals and executing a solid strategy, TMTG could actually set the stage for another short squeeze — rewarding loyal investors even further.\n\nThe Bottom Line: Don’t Ignore DJT\n\nWith momentum building and a credible growth plan unfolding, DJT is a stock that investors can no longer afford to ignore. Love or hate the politics around it, the company is demonstrating real business initiative — moving aggressively into fintech in a way that monetizes the Trump brand’s unique strengths.\n\nThe recent 57% surge in the stock’s value is a reflection of that newfound optimism. Could the shares be volatile? Certainly. But the upside scenario — where Truth.Fi and other partnerships add meaningful revenue and earnings — suggests this rally may have more room to run.\n\nMoreover, management hints that additional deal announcements are on the way, which could further bolster the bull case.\n\nIn a market full of growth stocks, DJT has set itself apart at the top of the leaderboard, and it could just be getting started.\n\n------------------------------------\n\nDisclosure Note: past performance is no guarantee of future results.

Do you own a suit?' the reporter pressed Zelensky.\n\n'A lot of Americans have problems, with you not respecting the dignity of this office,' he added.\n\nResponding to the criticism, the Ukrainian leader - who is often seen wearing casual combat clothes since Russia invaded Ukraine in February 2022 - said he faced more pressing problems with the war in Europe.\n\nHe added that he 'will wear a kostium (Ukrainian for 'suit') after this war will finish' and it would be 'maybe something like yours, maybe something better, maybe something cheaper'. \n\nIn a sign of support towards Zelensky, before the meeting escalated into a tense war of words, Trump quickly came to his aid and defended the president's clothing. \n\n'I do like your clothing by the way,' Trump said. 'I don't know if you two like each other, but I think he [Zelensky] is dressed beautifully.'\n\nStill, Glenn defended his question.\n\nA few days after the fiery Oval Office exchange, he said on his show that 'sometimes you can judge a book by its cover' and that Zelensky's outfit obviously 'reflected his attitude.'\n\nHe reiterated that notion in his interview with The Sunday Times, saying: 'That question was really meant to see how much respect he had for this country and the American people for funding his war.'\n\nCongresswoman Greene seemed to agree, as she shared her support for her boyfriend following the tense meeting with the Ukrainian leader.\n\n'I'm so proud of @briantv for pointing out that Zelensky ahs so much disrespect for America that he can't even wear a suit in the Oval Office when he comes to beg for money from our President,' she wrote on X at the time.\n\nGlenn and Greene started dating in late October 2022 when DailyMail.com exclusively found them together in Rome, Georgia.\n\nAt the time, they insisted their relationship was professional as he was working on a documentary about her.\n\nBut in an interview with Semafor five months later Greene confessed to the romance and said her new beau had been a 'great resource' for dealing with the media.\n\n 'He's from the industry, so he is a great resource. He's explained a lot, like how things work and yeah, it's great,' she said, before adding: 'So maybe I'm falling in love with the press.","summary":"Marjorie Taylor Greene 's reporter boyfriend Brian Glenn has sparked liberal ire after he shared what his job entails as a conservative journalist in Trump's White House.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-14653689/Marjorie-Taylor-Greene-boyfriend-Brian-Glenn-conservative-journalist.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/04/28/00/97762017-0-image-m-35_1745795772832.jpg","video":"https://videos.dailymail.co.uk/video/mol/2025/04/27/3075243854757317992/1024x576_MP4_3075243854757317992.mp4","publish_date":"2025-04-27 23:38:01","author":"Editor,Melissa Koenig","authors":["Editor","Melissa Koenig"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":0.106},{"id":315451382,"title":"Second illegal migrant arrested in Miami for theft of Kristi Noem's Gucci handbag","text":"Federal authorities have tracked down a second illegal migrant in Miami and charged him as an accomplice in the theft of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem's luxury Gucci handbag.\n\nThe pricey bag stuffed with $3,000 in cash was snatched right out from under her as Noem dined with her family on Easter Sunday at The Capital Burger, just a mile from the White House.\n\nThe primary suspect, Mario Bustamante-Leiva, a 49-year-old Chilean national with a long history of international theft, was taken into custody in the nation's capital on Saturday. \n\nNow law enforcement sources tell DailyMail.com that police have captured his alleged accomplice with a second arrest in Miami.\n\nInvestigators believe the arrest could be connected to an organized East Coast robbery ring - a network of career criminals exploiting America's immigration failures while targeting wealthy and high-profile individuals.\n\nThe brazenness of the theft, carried out in broad daylight stunned politicians and law enforcement alike, not least because the victim was the nation's top Homeland Security official and under 24/7 Secret Service protection.\n\n'Thank you to @SecretService @ICEgov and our law enforcement partners for finding and arresting the criminal who stole my bag on Easter Sunday as I shared a meal with my family at a Washington DC restaurant,' Noem wrote on X. \n\nFederal agents, following leads and surveillance footage, moved swiftly to arrest a second suspect in Miami, believed to be an accomplice of Bustamante-Leiva.\n\nThe pair are also thought to be part of the same network accused of terrorizing patrons of upscale restaurants, hotels, and coffee shops from New York to Florida.\n\nMario Bustamante-Leiva, the alleged ringleader, is no amateur.\n\nA father of three from Santiago, Chile, he has been living illegally in the United States for years, despite a rap sheet that stretches across continents.\n\nBustamante-Leiva made DailyMail.com headlines back in 2015 for being one of London's most prolific robbers waging a five-month robbery spree across the capital's swankiest venues. \n\nHe was jailed for three years after stealing nearly $28,000 worth of laptops, mobile phones, wallets, and passports. \n\nLondon's Metropolitan Police at the time described him as one of the city's 'most prolific' pickpockets, targeting exclusive bars, restaurants, and coffee shops.\n\nOne victim, a family preparing to travel, lost an entire bag containing all their passports and boarding passes - a level of callousness that prosecutors in London called 'cold and calculated.'\n\nHe admitted 22 charges of theft between July and December 2014. CCTV footage from the spree showed Bustamante-Leiva nonchalantly swiping handbags from directly beneath the noses of unsuspecting patrons.\n\nNow, nearly a decade later, Bustamante-Leiva stands accused of pulling the same stunt in the shadow of the US Capitol - but this time, his victim was one of the highest-ranking officials in the federal government.\n\nThe crime unfolded just before dusk on Easter Sunday. \n\nNoem, 53, was enjoying dinner with her family at The Capital Burger, accompanied by her grandchildren - all under the age of four. She no idea anything had even happened until she rose from her table and noticed her purse was gone.\n\nHer handbag, a luxury Gucci shoulder piece, sat at her feet under the table.\n\nDescribing the moment the theft occurred, Noem told The Vince Show podcast exactly what happened.\n\n'He hooked it with his foot and dragged it a few steps away and dropped a coat over it and took it… I think I was a busy grandma with four grandkids under the age of four, and I was taking care of them and feeding them food and enjoying my family, yeah, but certainly had my purse even touching my feet.' \n\nBy the time Noem realized what had happened, the bag was gone. Inside: $3,000 in cash, her makeup bag, passport, driver's license, apartment keys, medication, DHS access badge, and several blank checks.\n\nThe level of skill displayed by the thief led both Noem and federal investigators to the same conclusion: this was the work of someone who knew what they were doing.\n\n'It was professionally done,' Noem said. 'It tells me that this happens all the time to people, and that they live in communities where this is a danger.' \n\nEven with her full Secret Service detail present, the thief managed to slip away unnoticed - at least until the footage was reviewed. \n\nSurveillance video captured a masked suspect, clad in dark pants, a 'fur-type' collar, a ball cap, and a surgical mask, using his foot to slide the handbag away before concealing it beneath his jacket and fleeing.\n\n'It was frankly… a nice-looking purse,' US Attorney Ed Martin told NBC News. \n\n'This was not an amateur. This was a person, a thief, that knew how to do this. You could see how he scouted the room out.'\n\nMartin added that Noem was unlikely to have been targeted specifically because of her political profile. Instead, the flashy Gucci bag made her an appealing mark.\n\nThe case has become yet another flashpoint in the nation's immigration debate, as Noem and allies of President Donald Trump seize on the crime as evidence of systemic border failures.\n\n'This individual is a career criminal who has been in our country illegally for years,' Noem wrote on X. \n\n'Unfortunately, so many families in this country have been made victims by crime, and that's why President Trump is working every single day to make America safe and get these criminal aliens off of our streets.' \n\nUS Attorney Martin echoed those sentiments, stating: 'President Trump's direction to us is we charge these folks that are here illegally and we prosecute them, as well as deport them when need be, you know, as soon as that can happen… What I can tell you is he won't be back on the streets of America.'\n\nWith the arrest in Miami of a second suspect, federal law enforcement now believes Bustamante-Leiva may be just one cog in a far larger machine - an organized ring of migrant thieves.\n\nSources described the group as well-coordinated, targeting high-end establishments where distracted patrons - often tourists or families - are easy prey.\n\nThe identity of the Miami suspect has not yet been released, but ICE officials confirmed that the individual was also in the country illegally and is being held on federal immigration violations in addition to pending charges related to the Noem theft.","summary":"A second illegal migrant has been arrested in Miami in connection with the brazen theft of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem's Gucci handbag.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-14653549/Second-illegal-migrant-arrested-Miami-theft-Kristi-Noems-Gucci-handbag.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/04/27/23/97759943-0-image-m-15_1745792846641.jpg","video":"https://videos.dailymail.co.uk/video/1418450360/2015/03/1418450360_4131395431001_4131384325001.mp4","publish_date":"2025-04-27 23:36:44","author":"Editor,James Gordon","authors":["Editor","James Gordon"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.084},{"id":315455118,"title":"President Trump: Tariffs Will Lead to Income Tax Relief, Even Elimination","text":"President Donald Trump said Sunday that his tariff policy will substantially reduce, even completely eliminate, income taxes for some American workers.\n\n“When Tariffs cut in, many people’s Income Taxes will be substantially reduced, maybe even completely eliminated,” Trump wrote in a 6:06 a.m. post on Truth Social. “Focus will be on people making less than $200,000 a year.”\n\nTrump continued, “Also, massive numbers of jobs are already being created, with new plants and factories currently being built or planned. It will be a BONANZA FOR AMERICA!!! THE EXTERNAL REVENUE SERVICE IS HAPPENING!!!\n\nTrump has promoted an “external revenue service” before but may be citing the attractive idea again in the face of continuing criticism by detractors that he has launched a destructive “trade war” that has rattled the U.S. stock market and will result in higher prices for consumers.\n\nOn April 2, Trump imposed a series of tariffs on nations around the world including a 10 percent tariff on virtually everything coming into the United States. The tariff on India was set at 26 percent, while China has taken the biggest hit with 145 percent levies.\n\nSince, however, the administration has walked back some of the policy. It has put a 90-day pause on reciprocal tariffs, launched negotiations with dozens of countries looking for new trade deals, and focused much of its tariff fire on China.\n\nIn recent weeks Wall Street seems to be hanging on every word by Trump and Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent as the Dow average fluctuates.\n\nThe tariff policies have also rattled the U.S. bond market, which finances the nation’s debt. Some observers have said this prompted Trump to dial back some of the policy.","summary":"President Donald Trump said Sunday that his tariff policy will substantially reduce, even “completely eliminate,” income taxes for some American workers.\n\n\nThe post President Trump: Tariffs Will Lead to Income Tax Relief, Even Elimination appeared first on Breitbart.","url":"https://www.breitbart.com/economy/2025/04/27/president-trump-tariffs-will-lead-to-income-tax-relief-even-elimination/","image":"https://media.breitbart.com/media/2025/04/GettyImages-2208188174-640x335.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-27 23:36:27","author":"Lowell Cauffiel","authors":["Lowell Cauffiel"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.017},{"id":315452038,"title":"Jennifer Garner and John Miller's clue they're the perfect match following Ben Affleck reconciliation rumors","text":"Black Friday\n\nKim Kardashian\n\nVictoria Beckham\n\nHarry Styles\n\nAmanda Holden\n\nBritain's Got Talent\n\nPrivacy Policy\n\nMonday, Apr 28th 2025\n\n5-Day Forecast\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMeghan Markle shares adorable unseen photos of her 'little loves' Archie and Lilibet picking flowers - hours after revealing their American accents for the first time\n\nBombshell new report reveals who made fatal mistake that caused Black Hawk to collide with jet and kill 67\n\nGene Hackman's final autopsy reveals shocking medical history after actor was found dead at 95\n\nRevealed: The secret anti-ageing prescription ingredient celebrities use to look years younger.

'Ben and Jen have a unique relationship, especially for exes.'\nJohn reportedly issued Jennifer with an 'ultimatum' after the video of her and Ben emerged. \nPage Six reported that despite always remaining 'supportive of Ben and Jen’s co-parenting relationship' since he began dating the actress, John feels the Gone Girl star 'crossed the line' in the video. \n'John knows there’s nothing going on between Jen and Ben, but he doesn’t think those photos are a good look and feels it’s disrespectful to their relationship,' an insider said about the photos of Affleck affectionately grabbing Garner by the waist.\nA source told Page Six that Miller 'gave Jen an ultimatum — he doesn’t want to see anything like that again or he has no choice but to walk away.'\n\nGarner remains on good terms with her ex Ben Affleck, whom she shares three children with; pictured 2014\nIn February, it was reported that Miller felt uncomfortable about the close bond between Garner and her ex-husband.\nA source told Page Six that Miller 'isn't thrilled' about how much time the exes spend with each other.\nThe insider explained that Miller 'knows Ben and Jen have been leaning on each other more than ever lately and have a really close relationship.'\nMiller reportedly feels that 'their growing bond is getting to be a bit much when Ben spends all the holidays with them like Christmas and Thanksgiving.'\n\nThe former couple ended their marriage nearly seven years ago; pictured 2007\n'John feels like a third wheel,' the insider claimed.\n'It used to be solely about the kids, but John feels like it could be more than just about their coparenting relationship,' the insider alleged.\nIn March 2016, Garner detailed to Vanity Fair how her heart was 'tender' after her 10-year marriage to Affleck crumbled.\nMeanwhile Miller has two children with violinist Caroline Campbell, from whom he divorced in 2011.\nAffleck has not spoken much about his divorce from Jennifer Lopez but was photographed spending more time with first wife Garner in the months that followed.\nThe Argo actor wed Lopez in 2022 and she filed for divorce last year following months of speculation. The marriage officially ended earlier this year.\nThe actress was said to have played a key role in helping her ex-husband through his split from Lopez, adopting the role of 'marriage counsellor' to the struggling couple, with some friends feared she had been forced to 'play mediator.'\nJennifer GarnerBen AffleckDonald Trump\n\nShare or comment on this article: \nJennifer Garner and John Miller's clue they're the perfect match following Ben Affleck reconciliation rumors\n\nAdd comment\n\n Share what you think\n\nWorst rated\n\nThe comments below have not been moderated.\n\nThe views expressed in the contents above are those of our users and do not necessarily reflect the views of MailOnline.\n\nAdd your comment\n\nEnter your comment\n\nBy posting your comment you agree to our house rules.\n\nSubmit Comment\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual.\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual\n\nWe will automatically post your comment and a link to the news story to your Facebook timeline at the same time it is posted on MailOnline.

The move pits RIL against a consortium that includes Sunil Mittal of the Bharti Group, mirroring their competition in the telecommunications sector. Haier Appliances India, ranked third after LG and Samsung, has been considering a plan to dilute 25% to 51% equity, including an MG Motors-style structure, in which an Indian entity becomes the single largest shareholder. It has been seeking a $2-2.3 billion valuation, which includes a control premium, said the people cited. The company has been working with Citi since late last year to tap large family offices and private equity funds for a stake sale. ET was first to report on December 25 that Mittal had formed a consortium with Warburg Pincus. In this battle of billionaires, the other groupings include TPG and the Burman family of Dabur; Goldman Sachs and the Amit Jatia family; and GIC of Singapore with BK Goenka of Welspun, after initially joining forces with Uday Kotak ( yes GIC) The combine of the family office of Puneet Dalmia of the Dalmia Bharat Group and Bain Capital have opted out. 120674533 Chinese companies are now more amenable to conditions requiring stake dilution in favour of Indian entities if they want to expand in the country following Donald Trump’s tariff blitz. With that threatening to price their products out of the US market, Chinese companies are eager to gain ground in India. Reliance entered the race after non-binding offers were made in the beginning of the year. Its advisors have directly approached Haier’s headquarters in Qingdao, according to people in the know. Mittal too had gone to China a few weeks ago to meet the Haier top management, two industry executives said. It’s understood that the Reliance retail unit will be the vehicle for the potential acquisition, said the people cited. Reliance is keen on going solo, unlike the others, as of now, they said. It’s been building its own-brand business in electronics with licensed labels such as BPL and Kelvinator. Reconnect and Wyzr, brands that Reliance founded, have met with limited success.With most Indian companies and private equity firms making clear they are unlikely to remain junior partners in any alliance, the Chinese company is exploring the dilution of 45-48% equity to a local partner with another 3-6% set aside for Indian employees and local distributors, while retaining the rest. The final structure is expected to evolve in the next few weeks, added the people cited above. “Reliance was nowhere in the initial list of suitors who had placed a non-binding bid for the Haier India stake,” one of them said. “They entered the race recently and have directly reached Haier headquarters. They are very keen since they want a larger play in their own brand space in electronics like they are doing in FMCG with Campa Cola.”Reliance and Haier didn’t respond to queries.Third & Growing Haier, which sells refrigerators, washing machines, televisions and air-conditioners in India, posted sales of Rs 8,900 crore in calendar 2024, up 33% from 2023, when it started local operations. It’s targeting Rs 11,500 crore sales in calendar 2025. Haier has been keen to strike an equity alliance with a prominent Indian business group so that it can receive prompt approvals for its ambitious plans to expand the business in the country. Apart from the South Korean companies, it competes with Whirlpool, Havells-owned Lloyd, Godrej Appliances and Voltas Beko in India. Since tensions rose between the two countries, India has been going slow on most investments from China under Press Note 3 norms, which mandate government clearance instead of automatic approval for countries that share a border with the country. The move has hit several Chinese investments, even though some joint venture proposals, mainly in components, have been cleared in recent months. Haier India had applied for Rs 1,000 crore foreign direct investment (FDI) in 2023 but hasn’t yet received approval. Its plans include expansion of plants in Greater Noida and Pune, and setting up a third greenfield facility in the south, for which it’s seeking land in Andhra Pradesh and Tamil Nadu. Capacities will be saturated at the Pune and Greater Noida plants in another two to three years, going by the current pace of growth. Industry watchers say the Haier transaction got delayed by a few weeks due to the US-China tariff war as well as mixed signals. Prime minister Narendra Modi has been talking about improving bilateral relationship but in a recent interaction commerce minister Piyush Goyal said India does not intend to encourage foreign direct investment (FDI) from China. On the other hand, government officials have recently indicated to industry that joint venture proposals with Chinese minority ownership will be cleared as long as such partnerships involve transfer of critical technology that will help India build its component ecosystem.The recent volatility in global equities has dampened several high-profile listing plans, including the Indian IPO of market leader LG Electronics. Reliance is said to have raised this point to negotiate discounted valuations. The LG Electronics IPO outcome is being studied closely by the Chinese company, said executives in the know. Merger markets was the first to report that Reliance had submitted an initial bid. “There has been a change in Reliance’s thinking about their China engagement,” said a veteran group watcher. “There has been a realisation that without China its new energy business will find it difficult to scale up. The group has also tied up with Shien for fast fashion, a move that was unthinkable some years back.” Reliance Retail chief financial officer Dinesh Taluja told analysts on Friday that its own-brand business in electronics was up 30% on a year-on-year basis in FY25. The company sells these brands not only in its Reliance Digital stores but also through distribution channels. Taluja said the merchant base selling its own brands was up 60% in FY25 from the year before.","summary":"Reliance Industries has emerged as a strong contender for a significant stake in Haier India, potentially competing with a consortium led by Sunil Mittal.

Later, dozens of suspects were shown in handcuffs standing on a pavement waiting to be transported.\nDuring his second stint as US president, Donald Trump’s unprecedented campaign of immigration enforcement has pushed the limits of executive power, and he has clashed with federal judges trying to restrain him.\nThe crackdown has included detaining more than 1,000 international university students, some of whom have seen their legal status restored, at least temporarily. The policies have slowed immigration at the southern border to a relative trickle.\nOn Sunday in Colorado, US Immigration and Customs Enforcement took the club-going immigrants into custody, said Jonathan Pullen, special agent in charge of the DEA’s Rocky Mountain Division.\n“Colorado Springs is waking up to a safer community today,” he said.\n\nMore than 300 police officers and officials from multiple agencies responded to the nightclub, which had been under investigation for several months for alleged activities including drug trafficking, prostitution and “crimes of violence”, Pullen said at a news conference. Cocaine was among the drugs found, he said.\n“When the cops showed up at the door, most of the drugs hit the floor,” Pullen said.\nAn undisclosed number of guns were seized, he said.\n“Nothing good ever happens after 3am,” the DEA’s Rocky Mountain Division posted on social media.\nPullen estimated more than 200 people were inside the nightclub. Also among those detained were a dozen active-duty military members who either were customers or working as armed security. Some patrons were arrested on undisclosed outstanding warrants, Pullen said.\n“As we approach his 100 days in office @POTUS Trump’s directive to make America safe again is achieving results!” US Attorney General Pam Bondi said on social media.\nPullen did not specify which countries the detained immigrants were from.\nEarlier this month a federal judge in Colorado temporarily blocked deportations of immigrants who face possible removal under Trump’s invocation of an 18th-century law known as the Alien Enemies Act.","summary":"Club had been under investigation for alleged activities including drug trafficking, prostitution and ‘crimes of violence’, officials said.","url":"https://www.scmp.com/news/world/united-states-canada/article/3308127/more-100-suspected-illegal-immigrants-detained-nightclub-colorado","image":"https://cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2025/04/28/60623ab1-a9de-475e-9ee8-7cdc7ba459de_bd75e451.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-27 23:29:59","author":"Associated Press","authors":["Associated Press"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"cn","sentiment":-0.254},{"id":315448442,"title":"Greenland’s PM says island can’t be bought, calls Trump’s statements disrespectful","text":"LYNGBY, Denmark — New Greenlandic Prime Minister Jens-Frederik Nielsen said Sunday that US statements about the mineral-rich Arctic island have been disrespectful and that Greenland “will never, ever be a piece of property that can be bought by just anyone.”\n\nNielsen made the remarks in defiance of President Donald Trump’s interest in taking control of the strategic territory as Nielsen stood side by side with Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen on the second day of a three-day official visit. Greenland is a semi-autonomous territory of Denmark.\n\n“The talks from the United States have not been respectful,” Nielsen said at a news conference at the prime minister’s Marienborg official residence in Lyngby, 8 miles north of Copenhagen.\n\n“The words used have not been respectful.

But no wonder he nonetheless has his admirers: he is honest about the scandal of weak western governments losing control of their borders and letting in extremists, criminals and, more generally, people who hate our values. He has stood up to the nonsense of DEI positive discrimination based on race, stood up to women competing in men’s sports, and to European nations freeloading on defence and using the money to have a lavish welfare state which Americans themselves do not enjoy. But it is hard to think of a subject on which he has gone more badly wrong than on Russia-Ukraine, perhaps even worse than his blundering and stupid approach to tariffs. President Trump said that neither the Middle East nor Russian war would have happened if he had been in the White House, an absurd statement. Even more ludicrously, he said he would solve the Ukraine conflict on his first day in office. Instead, he emboldened that rampaging, corrupt thug President Putin into thinking that the conflict would be settled on his invading terms. Four months later, a fair peace seems a distant prospect. At the weekend, Russia launched a sweeping drone assault across Ukraine, targeting multiple regions, leaving several people dead. One of Mr Trump’s qualities is his ability to retreat from error.

These strikes have killed hundreds of Huthi fighters and numerous Huthi leaders,\" the military command responsible for the Middle East said in a statement that provided its most detailed accounting of the operation so far.\"The strikes have destroyed multiple command-and-control facilities, air defense systems, advanced weapons manufacturing facilities, and advanced weapons storage locations,\" CENTCOM said.Despite the strikes, the Huthis -- who control large swaths of Yemen and have been at war with a Saudi-led coalition backing the internationally recognized government since 2015 -- have continued to claim attacks against both US vessels and Israel.CENTCOM said that \"while the Huthis have continued to attack our vessels, our operations have degraded the pace and effectiveness of their attacks. Ballistic missile launches have dropped by 69 percent. Additionally, attacks from one-way attack drones have decreased by 55 percent.\"\"Iran undoubtedly continues to provide support to the Huthis. The Huthis can only continue to attack our forces with the backing of the Iranian regime,\" the military command said.\"We will continue to ratchet up the pressure until the objective is met, which remains the restoration of freedom of navigation and American deterrence in the region,\" it added.As the United States announced details on the latest round of its campaign against the Huthis, the rebel-controlled Al-Masirah TV reported that US strikes on the Yemeni capital Sanaa had killed at least eight people and wounded others.Al-Masirah TV also broadcast footage of the rubble of destroyed homes and cars, as well as blood stains on the ground, while rescuers collected what appeared to be human remains in white cloth.Earlier Sunday, Huthi media said overnight strikes on Sanaa had killed two people and wounded several more.The latest strikes brings the death toll since March 15 to 228, according to an AFP tally based on Huthi announcements.The Huthi rebels began targeting shipping in late 2023, claiming solidarity with Palestinians in the Gaza Strip, which has been devastated by a military campaign launched by Israel after a shock Hamas attack in October of that year.Huthi attacks have prevented ships from passing through the Suez Canal -- a vital route that normally carries about 12 percent of the world's shipping traffic -- forcing many companies into a costly detour around the tip of southern Africa.The United States first began conducting strikes against the Huthis under the Biden administration, and President Donald Trump has vowed that military action against the rebels will continue until they are no longer a threat to shipping.The Trump administration has been forced onto the political defensive during the Yemen campaign by scandals stemming from senior officials' use of commercial messaging app Signal to discuss strikes that took place on March 15.Last month, The Atlantic magazine revealed that its editor-in-chief was mistakenly included in a Signal chat in which officials, including Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth and National Security Advisor Mike Waltz, discussed the strikes.US media outlets then reported earlier this month that Hegseth had shared information on the same strikes in a second Signal group chat with various people who would not normally be involved in such discussions, including his wife.","summary":"The United States has hit more than 800 targets in Yemen since mid-March, killing hundreds of Huthi rebel fighters, including members of the group's leadership, the US military said Sunday.","url":"https://www.ibtimes.com/us-says-it-struck-800-targets-yemen-killed-100s-huthis-since-march-15-3771570","image":"https://d.ibtimes.com/en/full/4597044/us-military-photo-shows-f-18-super-hornet-warplane-taking-off-uss-harry-s-truman-aircraft.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-27 23:03:19","author":"W.g.

Three people died and four were wounded in airstrikes on Kostyantynivka in the Donetsk region of eastern Ukraine, the regional prosecutor's office said. Another person died and a 14-year-old girl was wounded in a drone attack on the city of Pavlohrad in the Dnipropetrovsk region, which was hit for the third consecutive night, Governor Serhii Lysak said.

The attacks came hours after Russia claimed to have regained control over the remaining parts of the Kursk region that Ukrainian forces seized in a surprise incursion in August 2024. Ukrainian officials said the fighting in Kursk was still ongoing. Trump said on Saturday he doubts Putin wants to end the more than three-year-old war, expressing new scepticism a peace deal can be reached soon.

Trump also hinted at further sanctions against Russia. On Sunday evening, as he left his golf club in New Jersey, Trump told reporters he remained \"disappointed\" in Russia's attacks. Trump said of Putin, \"I want him to stop shooting, sit down and make a deal.\" Asked what he would do if Russia does not stop its attacks, Trump replied, \"I have a lot of things that I can do.\" The Vatican Trump-Zelenskyy conversation was the first face-to-face encounter between the two leaders since their heated Oval Office meeting at the White House on February 28. US Secretary of State Marco Rubio said on Sunday the coming week would be \"very critical\", and that the US would need to \"make a determination about whether this is an endeavour that we want to continue to be involved in\". Asked on NBC's \"Meet the Press\" about possible concessions to Russia, Rubio emphasised the need to be \"grownups and realistic\". \"There is no military solution to this war. The only solution to this war is a negotiated settlement where both sides are going to have to give up something they claim to want and are going to have to give the other side something they wish they didn't,\" he said. Russia fired 149 exploding drones and decoys in the latest wave of attacks, the Ukrainian air force said, adding that 57 were intercepted and another 67 jammed. One person was wounded in drone attacks on the Odesa region and one other was hurt in the city of Zhytomyr. Four people were also wounded in a Russian airstrike on the city of Kherson on Sunday, local officials said. Russia's Defence Ministry said air defences shot down five Ukrainian drones in the border region of Bryansk, as well as three drones over the Crimean Peninsula, which was illegally annexed by Russia in 2014. Five people were wounded when Ukrainian forces shelled the city of Horlivka in the partially occupied Donetsk region, said the Russian-installed Mayor Ivan Prikhodko.
