Khelif beat Yang Liu of China 5:0 in the final of the women’s welterweight division, wrapping up the best series of fights of her boxing career with a victory at Roland Garros, where crowds chanted her name, waved Algerian flags and roared every time she landed a punch. After her unanimous win, Khelif jumped into her coaches’ arms, one of them putting her on his shoulders and carrying her around the arena in a victory lap as she pumped her fists and grabbed an Algerian flag from someone in the crowd. “For eight years, this has been my dream, and I’m now the Olympic champion and gold medalist,” Khelif said through an interpreter. “I want to thank all the people who have come to support me. All the people from Algeria and all the people at my base.” Fans have embraced Khelif in Paris even as she faced an extraordinary amount of scrutiny from world leaders, major celebrities and others who have questioned her eligibility or falsely claimed she was a man. It has thrust her into a larger divide over changing attitudes toward gender identity and regulations in sports. Khelif told SNTV, a sports video partner of The Associated Press, last weekend that a gold medal would be “the best response” to the backlash against her. She also said the wave of hateful scrutiny she has received “harms human dignity” and called for an end to bullying athletes. It stems from the Russian-dominated International Boxing Association’s decision to disqualify Khelif and fellow two-time Olympian Li Yu-ting of Taiwan from last year’s world championships, claiming both failed a murky eligibility test for women’s competition. The International Olympic Committee took the unprecedented step last year of permanently banning the IBA from the Olympics following years of concerns about its governance, competitive fairness and financial transparency. The IOC has called the arbitrary sex tests that the sport’s governing body imposed on the two boxers irretrievably flawed. The IOC has repeatedly reaffirmed the two boxers’ right to compete in Paris, with President Thomas Bach personally defending Khelif and Lin while calling the criticism “hate speech.” “We have two boxers who are born as women, who have been raised as women, who have a passport as a woman and have competed for many years as women,” Bach said. That hasn’t stopped the international outcry tied to misconceptions around the fighters that has been amplified by Russian disinformation networks. It also hasn’t slowed two boxers who have performed at the highest levels of their careers while under the spotlight’s glare. Khelif was completely dominant in Paris at a level she had never reached before: She won every round on every judge’s scorecard in each of her three fights that went the distance. Khelif’s gold medal is Algeria’s first in women’s boxing. She is only the nation’s second boxing gold medalist, joining Hocine Soltani (1996) while claiming the seventh gold medal in Algeria’s entire Olympic history. While Khelif drew enthusiastic, flag-draped fans in Paris, she also has become a hero in her North African country. Many have seen the world’s dissection of Khelif as criticism of their nation. Khelif’s fight was dubbed “The Night of Destiny” in local newspapers, with projection screens to watch the bout set up in public squares throughout Algiers and other cities. In the city of Tiaret in the region where Khelif is from, workers braved scorching summer heat to paint a mural of Khelif on the gym where she learned to box. “Imane has managed to turn the criticism and attacks on her femininity into fuel,” said Mustapha Bensaou of the Tiaret gym. “The slander has given her a boost. … It’s a bit of a blessing in disguise.” Khelif won the first round over Yang on all five judges’ cards despite showing a bit less aggression than earlier in the tournament. Khelif then knocked Yang back against the ropes with a combination early in the second, although Yang responded with a flurry of shots and fought gamely. Khelif won the second round and cruised through the third, staying away from Yang just enough to avoid any serious threat. Khelif did a triumphant boxer’s shuffle in the final seconds of the bout before the boxers hugged. When the verdict was announced, Khelif saluted and then pumped her arm with glee. Khelif smiled broadly during the medal ceremony and waved to the crowd. She sang Algeria’s national anthem with passion before kissing her gold medal. The four medalists – boxing gives out two bronze – then posed for a podium selfie, clasping hands and raising them together. The gold medal fight was the culmination of Khelif’s nine-day run through an Olympic tournament that began with a bizarre event. Khelif’s first opponent, Angela Carini of Italy, abandoned their bout after just 46 seconds, saying she was in too much pain from Khelif’s punches. An already brewing story suddenly became major international news, with the likes of former U.S. President Donald Trump and “Harry Potter” author J.K. Rowling weighing in with criticism and false speculation about men competing with women in sports. Carini later said she regretted her actions and wished to apologize to Khelif. Khelif has never done as well in another international tournament as she did in these Olympics. When she was cast as some sort of unstoppable punching machine last week by pundits and provocateurs who had never seen her fight before, opponents and teammates who knew her were shocked by the characterization. Then she lived up to the notion of being one of the best Olympic boxers in the world. Lin also fights for a gold medal Saturday on the final card of the Olympics. She takes on Julia Szeremeta of Poland with a chance to win Taiwan’s first boxing gold.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nPARIS &#8212; Algerian boxer Imane Khelif has won a gold medal Friday&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Imane Khelif: Algerian Boxer Wins Gold at Olympics Amid Controversy surrounding Gender first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/news/us/imane-khelif-algerian-boxer-wins-gold-at-olympics-amid-controversy-surrounding-gender/","image":"https://cdn.abcotvs.com/dip/images/15166317_Imane-Khelif-gold.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-08-10 00:26:30","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.425},{"id":253792162,"title":"Listen: Cops Scramble to Secure Hospital for Biden Health Scare","text":"Officers from the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department rushed to clear roads and secure the perimeter of a hospital that had been placed on standby to treat President Joe Biden for a medical issue last month, according to radio transmission recordings obtained by the Daily Beast. It remains unclear what the undisclosed medical issue was, though the White House announced later that day he had been diagnosed with COVID. “Meet at the Valley Hospital ER parking lot. We’re going to meet behind the ER entrances, where the ambulances go,” an officer says in one of the transmissions, which were sent to the Daily Beast in response to a public records request to the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department. The radio transmissions were broadcast on July 17, after the president abruptly canceled a speaking engagement on a campaign trip in Las Vegas, Nevada, where he was set to speak to Hispanic voters at the UnidosUS event. At 2:15 p.m. local time the same day, the University Medical Center (UMC) hospital was alerted of an unspecified medical emergency involving Biden, which was first reported by KSNV Las Vegas. While details about the emergency were scant, Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department (LVMP) quickly mobilized outside the hospital, securing a perimeter around the facility. Meanwhile, UMC’s staff “stood ready,” UMC’s CEO Mason Van Houweling told KSNV at the time, setting up an incident command center in anticipation of the president’s arrival. “We knew we were dealing with more of a medical issue—definitely trauma and any accidents were off the table. So again, we shifted gears to be able to address a medical need here at UMC,” Houweling said. In one of the radio transmissions shared with the Daily Beast, a police officer warns that “we gotta take this one slow ’cause we don’t have a lot of resources to make it work.” “Everybody just keep in mind safety, safety, safety. If it doesn’t look good, don’t do it… no one gets hurt.” Biden was never admitted to the hospital, however. Instead, the president was taken directly to the airport, where he boarded Air Force One and departed Las Vegas for Delaware. In another set of police radio broadcasts—which appears to feature LVMPD officers assisting the Secret Service as Biden was being driven to the airport—an officer asks: “Do we know if the Secret Service has drones flying over the stratosphere right now?” Towards the end of one recording, an officer thanks his units for how they handled the incident. “All my units at the airport, be advised that the motorcade is at Air Force One,” he says. “I just wanna let everybody know. Great work out there. You know we put that together ad hoc… appreciate all the resources coming over. You guys did a fantastic job that looked like we had planned it for weeks, so great job everybody.” Days later, the LVMPD released a statement saying that they had been informed that the president was sick without further details, adding that they had proactively started clearing roads to the hospital. Hours later, the White House released a statement saying that the president had been diagnosed with COVID. “Earlier today following his first event in Las Vegas, President Biden tested positive for COVID-19. He is vaccinated and boosted and he is experiencing mild symptoms. He will be returning to Delaware where he will self-isolate and will continue to carry out all of his duties fully during that time,” Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said in a statement released later that day. “The White House will provide regular updates on the President’s status as he continues to carry out the full duties of the office while in isolation.” Just four days later, Biden—already plagued with questions about his apparent frailness and cognitive capacities, made worse by his dismal performance in a debate against Trump on June 27—dropped out of the 2024 U.S. presidential race. “While it has been my intention to seek reelection, I believe it is in the best interest of my party and the country for me to stand down and to focus solely on fulfilling my duties as President for the remainder of my term,” the president wrote in a letter posted to X. Biden endorsed Vice President Kamala Harris to run in his stead in a later post that same day. Harris formally secured the Democratic presidential nomination on Aug. 6, and has since selected Minnesota Governor Tim Walz as her running mate. Harris is set to debate former president Donald Trump, the Republican nominee, for the first time on Sept. 10.","summary":"Kent Nishimura/AFP/GettyOfficers from the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department rushed to clear roads and secure the perimeter of a hospital that had been placed on standby to treat President Joe Biden for a medical issue last month, according to radio transmission recordings obtained by the Daily Beast.\n\nIt remains unclear what the undisclosed medical issue was, though the White House announced later that day he had been diagnosed with COVID.\n\n“Meet at the Valley Hospital ER parking lot.

The new advertisement refers to both. “She grew up in a middle-class home. She was the daughter of a working mom, and she worked at McDonald’s while she got her degree,” the ad narrator says. Harris’ late mother, Shyamala Gopalan, was a biomedical scientist at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. Her father, Donald J. Harris, is a professor at Stanford University. They divorced when Harris was 7 years old. Harris has said “building up the middle class” would be a “defining goal” of her presidency should she win. She has backed policies she has framed as easing financial burdens on middle-class people, including increased access to affordable health care and child care. She often refers to Project 2025, which her campaign has sought to tie to Trump, as “a plan to weaken the middle class.” Trump denies having any affiliation with Project 2025. The new ad is one of several the Harris campaign has released over the last two weeks. Yesterday, she released a 60-second biographical spot detailing her rise to the vice presidency, and last month, she released an advertisement attacking Trump for his role blocking a bipartisan border security bill from passing.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nThe Harris-Walz campaign released a new ad this morning touting Harris’ background,&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Harris and Walz embark on swing state tour in Arizona, while Trump to hold rally in Montana first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/news/us/harris-and-walz-embark-on-swing-state-tour-in-arizona-while-trump-to-hold-rally-in-montana/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/rewrite-this-title-Harris-Walz-continue-swing-state-tour-in.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-08-10 00:19:18","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.442},{"id":253792290,"title":"Trump campaign projects confidence and looks to young male voters for an edge on Harris","text":"WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. (AP) — As Donald Trump adjusts to the reality of his new race against Kamala Harris, his campaign is counting on younger male voters to give him the edge in November in a presidential contest they insist is his to lose. Trump and his Republican campaign now face a dramatically different race than the one just three weeks ago, before President Joe Biden abandoned his bid. While they acknowledge polls have tightened with Harris as the Democratic nominee, they maintain that the fundamentals of the race have not changed, with voters deeply sour over the direction of the country, and particularly the economy. “What has happened is we are witnessing a kind of out-of-body experience where we have suspended reality for a couple of weeks,” Trump campaign pollster Tony Fabrizio told reporters during a briefing in West Palm Beach on Thursday of the current state of the race. It was a message echoed by Trump during a press conference at his Mar-a-Lago club. “The honeymoon period’s gonna end,” he insisted while minimizing the size of the crowds Harris has been drawing and lashing out at his new opponent. “Let me tell you: We have the enthusiasm.” Campaign officials acknowledge that Harris had energized the Democratic base and that her team has taken the lead on fundraising. But they insist they have more than enough to do what they need to win. Trump’s campaign and its affiliates reported raising $138.7 million in July — far less than the eye-popping $310 million sum reported by Harris. Her campaign began August with more cash on hand. With less than three months to go, senior campaign officials are focused on a group of persuadable voters that they believe is key to victory. The targets, which they say comprise about 11% of the electorate in key battleground states, skew younger and are disproportionately male and moderate. While more than half are white, they include more nonwhites, especially Asians and Hispanics, than the broader electorate. They are especially frustrated by the economy, including their personal finances, and are pessimistic things will improve. “It’s a very narrow band of people that we are trying to move,” Fabrizio said of the efforts. Since these voters don’t engage with traditional news outlets and have traded cable for streaming services, the campaign has been working to reach them in novel ways. “There is a reason why we’re doing podcasts. There is a reason why we’re doing Adin Ross,” Fabrizio said, referring to the controversial internet personality who ended his interview with the former president earlier this week by giving him a Tesla Cybertruck wrapped in images of Trump raising his fist after his assassination attempt. “There is a reason why we are doing all of those things. You know what these people pay attention to? MMA, Adin Ross,” he said. “MMA” refers to mixed martial arts. Trump campaign officials acknowledge the Democratic base is now motivated in a way it wasn’t when Biden was the nominee. Harris, they say, will likely do better than Biden would have with Black voters, especially women and older men. But they argue Harris is doing little to appeal to swing voters. And they intend to spend the next 80-plus days painting her as a radical liberal and as the incumbent rather than a change, tying her to the most unpopular Biden administration policies. “There’s way more information about her that they don’t know that they’re going to hear. And we’re going to make sure they’re going to get,” Fabrizio said. By the end of the race, they believe, neither candidate will be liked, but voters will choose the candidate they feel will most improve their economic conditions. They pointed to a line Harris has been using to refer to Trump’s presidency — “We are not going back” — as particularly ill conceived, given that some voters say things were better when Trump was in office than they are now. Trump campaign aides said they now have staff on the ground in 18 states, ranging from critical battlegrounds to states like Virginia, where Democrats have been favored, that they hope they can put into play. The campaign says it now has hundreds of paid staff and more than 300 Trump and GOP offices open across battleground states. But much of their effort relies on volunteers and outside groups. They are trying to replicate a model they used successfully during the GOP primary in Iowa this winter, where volunteer “caucus captains” were given a list of 10 neighbors they pledged to get out to the polls. The campaign has credited that model with boosting turnout on a brutally cold and icy caucus night. The “Trump Force 47” program is focused on targeting low- and medium-propensity voters. Volunteers will be canvassing, writing postcards, phone banking and organizing their neighbors. So far, 12,000 captains have been trained and given voter target lists, according to officials. An additional 30,000 have volunteered, with more than 2,000 expected to be trained per week between now and Election Day. A large part of the campaign’s outreach will also rely on outside groups, which will be running paid canvassing and get-out-the-vote efforts thanks to new guidance from the Federal Election Commission that allow campaigns to coordinate with outside groups in ways that were previously not allowed. The campaign said more than 1,000 paid canvassers are on the ground in battleground states, and they’re also working to register about 1.6 million targeted voters in those competitive places.

An unnamed law enforcement source confirmed the mechanical issue to CBS. Details of the mechanical issue have not been disclosed by Trump’s campaign, which posted a video of the former president announcing his arrival in Montana. Trump continued his trip to Bozeman on a private jet, according to the Associated Press. Trump’s rally is slated for 10 p.m. EDT and will likely be used to voice support for Republican Senate nominee Tim Sheehy, who is running against incumbent Democratic Sen. Jon Tester.

Key Background Trump endorsed Sheehy for Senate in February in what has become a crucial race for Republicans as they look to regain control of the Senate. A successful flip of Tester’s seat would mark a significant Republican win and remove Tester from the picture after 18 years as a senator—though his previous races have been tightly contested. Trump, who said earlier this year Sheehy is “the candidate who is currently best-positioned” to defeat Tester, won Montana by 16 points in 2020.

On Friday, Khelif — the Algerian boxer who was accused of being a man after her opponent quit because she hit her hard — earned gold after defeating China’s Yang Liu. “I’m very happy. For eight years, this has been my dream, and I’m now the Olympic champion and gold medalist,” Khelif said, after winning by unanimous decision, per USA Today. “I’ve worked for eight years, no sleep, eight years tired. Now I’m the Olympic champion.” Khelif won the first two rounds of the fight with Liu in the women’s welterweight division. According to the Associated Press, Khelif had previously said that she didn’t “care about that” controversy surrounding her gender and was instead focused on fighting. She won all four of her Olympic bouts. “I want to tell the entire world that I am a female, and I will remain a female,” she said over the weekend. Last week, social media was set ablaze after false allegations that Khelif was secretly a transgender woman who had infiltrated the women’s category of the games. The allegations came about after her Italian opponent Angela Carini withdrew less than a minute after the fight began, saying, “I have never been hit so hard in my life.” Carini later said she “wanted to apologize” to Khelif, adding, “All this controversy makes me sad.” Elon Musk posted multiple times on X about the match between the two women, agreeing that “men don’t belong in women’s sports.” Anti-trans author J.K. Rowling also railed against Khelif as a “male who knows he’s protected by a misogynist sporting establishment,” who was “enjoying the distress of a woman he’s just punched in the head, and whose life’s ambition he’s just shattered.” Even Donald Trump wrote on Truth Social that he would “keep men out of women’s sports.” The accusations made against Khelif were based on a 2023 incident where she and boxer Lin Yu-Ting were suspended from the International Boxing Association (IBA) Women’s World Boxing Championships. At the time, IBA President Umar Kremlev claimed that genetic testing had proven Khelif “had XY chromosomes,” and was therefore ineligible to compete.

Elabed then said the Democratic presidential nominee agreed to meet with the group. “She said yes I will meet with you. And I understand when she agreed to meet with me, she wasn’t agreeing to an arms embargo, she was agreeing to discuss an arms embargo and discuss a policy that will save lives now in Gaza and hopefully get us to a point where we can put our support behind VP Harris,” Elabed explained. Fellow Uncommitted Movement founder Abbas Alawieh seconded Elabed’s account of Harris’ agreement to meet — and also claimed that Democratic Party leaders showed sympathy with their desire for an arms embargo. “While we were backstage, ahead of getting to interface with Vice President Harris, we talked to one party leader after another and said to them, ‘Listen, if it was your family that was living under the bombs, we would expect that you would want our candidate to have a policy of stopping the sending of bombs to kill your family members,'” Alawieh said in the video. He continued, “Party leaders who we spoke to understood this. It was clear that Vice President Harris understood the gravity of the situation, and we found hope in the fact that she expressed an openness to engage.” The eyebrow-raising revelation came after Harris was accused of passing over Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro, who is Jewish, as her pick for vice president because she didn’t want to cross the progressive, anti-Israel left. The claims that she is now open to discussing an arms embargo quickly sparked outrage among Israel supporters, who say it is just more evidence of her kowtowing to the radical, anti-Israel mob. Senator Marsha Blackburn (R-TN) interpreted the news as Harris appeasing a pro-Hamas undercurrent in her party. “Kamala Harris is a Hamas sympathizer. She has made it crystal clear that she will stand with Hamas as the Jewish people are relentlessly attacked by Hamas terrorists,” she told The Post. Sen. Tom Cotton (R-Ark.) also hit out at the Democratic presidential nominee. “Kamala Harris won’t speak with press. But she will speak with pro-Hamas radicals and suggest she’s open to a full arms embargo against Israel,” Cotton lamented on X. “Floating an arms embargo against Israel to pro-Hamas activists is disgraceful,” former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo added to the chorus of fury online. “Kamala Harris’s radical policies will encourage more terror attacks against our ally.” Congressman Ritchie Torres (D-NY), however, shot down the claims. “The Uncommitted movement, delusional as ever, is imagining support where none exists,” Torres told The Post. “The Vice President’s team has made it clear that she opposes an arms embargo. An arms embargo against Israel — at a time when Israel finds itself under threat from Iran and its proxies on seven fronts –would endanger the world’s only Jewish State in a moment of existential self-defense.” Harris’ National Security Advisor, Phil Gordon, also insisted that Harris would “always ensure Israel is able to defend itself against Iran and Iran-backed terrorist groups.” “She does not support an arms embargo on Israel. She will continue to work to protect civilians in Gaza and to uphold international humanitarian law,” Gordon wrote in a statement on X Thursday, without explicitly denying she was open to at least a discussion about an embargo. On Wednesday, Harris spoke to a crowd of around 15,000 attendees who packed the Detroit airplane hangar — where she was interrupted by anti-Israel protestors. “Kamala, Kamala, you can’t hide! We won’t vote for genocide,” the demonstrators from an anti-Israel University of Michigan student group yelled. “You know what, if you want Donald Trump to win, then say that. Otherwise, I’m speaking,” Harris shot back.","summary":"The founders of the Uncommitted National Movement claimed that Kamala Harris \"expressed an openness\" to meeting with them to discuss an arms embargo against the Jewish State.","url":"https://nypost.com/2024/08/09/us-news/anti-israel-uncommitted-voter-group-claims-kamala-harris-agreed-to-discuss-an-arms-embargo-against-israel/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/08/87376492.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-08-09 23:49:29","author":"George Caldwell,Josh Christenson","authors":["George Caldwell","Josh Christenson"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.137},{"id":253791354,"title":"Harris, Walz campaign in Arizona as immigration issue looms large","text":"Harris, Walz campaign in Arizona as immigration issue looms large Vice President Kamala Harris and her running mate, Minnesota Gov.

The contest between Harris and former President Donald Trump remains remarkably close, and she is tied with him in must-win states like Wisconsin and Michigan, according to The New York Times’s polling averages. Trump’s allies are sharpening their attacks. And in a candidacy measured in days not months, she has yet to face the scrutiny of an interview or release a detailed vision for her potential presidency. Every presidential campaign is a series of tests. Can you excite voters? Can you raise money? For Harris, the answer to both of those questions so far is yes. Her party coalesced around her instantly. She has smashed fund-raising records and held overflowing rallies, and she seems to be tugging key swing states her way. But as Harris wraps up a battleground campaign tour with her brand-new running mate this weekend and turns her attention toward the Democratic National Convention this month, fresh challenges are in the offing.

The Republican frontrunner is hit in the ear but stands up and pumps his fist to the crowd. Shooter Thomas Matthew Crooks, 20, is shot dead but the Secret Service is slammed for suspected security blunders. Ex-fire chief Corey Comperatore is killed protecting his family. Sunday, July 14 – President Joe Biden calls on Americans to unite and “cool down” political rhetoric in the wake of Trump’s shooting. The Democrat had faced growing calls since his disastrous performance in June’s CNN debate. Shocking video reveals how close Trump came to being killed after turning his head at the last minute. Monday, July 15 – The Republican National Convention kicks off in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, where Trump is formally nominated as the Republican candidate. An emotional-looking Trump makes his first appearance since surviving the shooting wearing a large ear bandage. It quickly becomes a must-have fashion item at the RNC. Ohio Senator JD Vance is named as Trump’s running mate. Previously anti-Trump, Vance at just 39 is an inexperienced choice, but seen as having a connection with ordinary Americans. In an interview, Biden admits it was a “mistake” to talk about putting Trump in “the bullseye” days before the assassination attempt. Tuesday, July 16 – The FBI warns of more potential violence in the wake of Trump’s shooting. Intelligence claims Iran had a separate plot to assassinate Trump, but there is no proven link to Crooks. Biden returns to the campaign trail for the first time since the assassination attempt and insists he isn’t stepping down. Wednesday, July 17 – Joe Biden tests positive for Covid, just days after saying he would drop out of the presidential race if he was diagnosed with a medical condition. It intensifies the calls for him to step aside with Kamala Harris and Gavin Newsom floated as potential replacements. At the RNC, JD Vance makes his first speech since being selected as Trump’s VP pick, to the delight of the MAGA crowd. Thursday, July 18 – Donald Trump addresses the RNC, his first speech since surviving an attempted assassination. He appears slower and more subdued than usual but gives the longest convention acceptance speech in US history. Just before he goes on, former wrestler Hulk Hogan rips his shirt off and tells cheering crowds “Trumpomania” will sweep America. Former First Lady Melania, who has barely been seen on the campaign trail, makes an appearance but does not speak. Barack Obama joins calls for Biden to step aside. Friday, July 19 – President Biden appears to consider resigning, as a source says he is in a “contemplative stage” while isolating with Covid. Video emerges showing Biden appearing to lean into the wrong woman after mistaking her for his wife Jill. Meanwhile, the world’s biggest tech outage sparks travel chaos for Republicans leaving the RNC in Milwaukee. Saturday, July 20 – Donald Trump holds his first campaign rally since the shooting in Butler. He appears in Michigan without his ear bandage. His former doctor Ronny Jackson describes his injuries. He appears in his first interview alongside his running mate Vance. Senior Democrat Nancy Pelosi speaks for the first time since being linked to growing calls for Biden to resign. Meanwhile, Biden’s reelection campaign continues to insist he is running, as a spokesperson slams Trump’s rally remarks as showing he is “focused only on himself.” Sunday, July 21 – Joe Biden announces he isn’t running in November in a shock letter, just hours after insisting he was staying in the race. He is the first incumbent to step down in their first term since 1968. Biden endorses Kamala Harris for president as senior Dems through their support behind the Vice President. The news appears to throw the Republicans off their stride. Biden vows to continue his term until November’s election. Monday, July 22 – Kamala Harris raises a record $81 million in 24 hours as she secures the Democratic candidacy. She also inherits some $91 million in leftover campaign funds from Biden. Harris gives her first speech since Biden stepped out, and speaks to the president on the phone, although he doesn’t appear in person. Under-pressure Secret Service chief Kimberly Cheatle appears on Capitol Hill and faces increasing calls to resign over the shooting of Trump. She admits the Secret Service “failed” on July 13 and resigns the following day.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nDONALD Trump&#8217;s plane made an emergency landing on Friday afternoon following a&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Donald Trump&#8217;s aircraft had to land unexpectedly in Montana due to a mechanical problem, while a large number of people were assembling for a rally. first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/news/donald-trumps-aircraft-had-to-land-unexpectedly-in-montana-due-to-a-mechanical-problem-while-a-large-number-of-people-were-assembling-for-a-rally/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Donald-Trumps-plane-forced-to-make-emergency-landing-in-Montana.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-08-09 23:45:57","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.36},{"id":253791516,"title":"'Constitution to the side': NC Republican schools nominee called for pro-Trump military coup","text":"A video of Michele Morrow — the far-right conspiracy theorist that North Carolina Republicans nominated to be their general election candidate for public schools superintendent — has resurfaced in which she called on former President Donald Trump to initiate a military coup against the democratically elected government of the United States.

In the video, Morrow insists that Trump is still the president of the United States, and urged him to subvert the rule of law in order to forcibly seize power from Joe Biden and Kamala Harris, who were president-elect and vice president-elect at the time. \"President Trump is still president until the 20th [of January],\" she said. \"And now, he has every player that participated in his sights.

She's also called for Biden to be assassinated in a tweet proclaiming: \"KILL all TRAITORS!!!\" When CNN reporter Shimon Prokupecz confronted Morrow about her past statements, she notably didn't walk back her comments. She then snapped at Prokupecz for continuing to press her after she initially said \"no comment.\" \"I have a question: Do you vote in North Carolina?

The Citrus Marketplace Shopping Center in Walnut Creek needs some new businesses. It’s a great location and has some wonderful businesses, but it needs more. I was looking forward to Chick-fil-A coming into the center, occupying a currently vacant storefront. I think it’s important to support local businesses and am appalled by the response given by Jessica Hunt, who is a small business owner herself but is against this new business. She states that Chick-fil-A “is not reflective of our community’s inclusive and diverse values.” I guess being “inclusive and diverse” only applies if it aligns with your views. Isn’t that the exact opposite of the definition of inclusion and diversity? Linda Thompson Walnut Creek All should commit to keeping cities clean Re: “Livermore man’s volunteer spirit picks up followers” (Page A1, Aug. 5). It’s inspiring to read your article about Andy Wang’s effort to take on illegal dumping and littering in Oakland. Never underestimate the power of individuals to make a difference in their communities. In El Sobrante, volunteers can join Green Team 94803’s regular Third Saturday Cleanups at the library to keep our neighborhoods clean and beautiful. We love our community and don’t want to live in a trashy area. Once we realized that no government entity was going to pick up the litter for us, we all made the commitment to do it ourselves. We encourage other areas to do it, too. We do need the government to step up enforcement and place cameras around to deter dumpers, along with a PR campaign to remind people that littering makes our towns and neighborhoods dirty and harms the environment. It would be great to raise public consciousness by bringing back the old campaign: “Don’t be a litterbug!” Mikki Norris El Sobrante Killing immigration bill shows Trump’s deceit During the National Association of Black Journalists’ interview of Donald Trump, the candidate’s accusations against immigrants became wilder, weirder and more exaggerated. We could see him making up more and more ominous lies as his hands played an invisible accordion. The fact that crime statistics for immigrants are far lower than for the general population didn’t retard his firehose of lies. But one fact should be repeated, over and over, until the public fully realizes how cynical and destructive Trump’s mendacity is. A bipartisan bill to allocate more resources to our borders — for both enforcement and for more judges to determine whose claims for asylum are valid — had passed the Senate and was scheduled to pass the House of Representatives. Then Trump told his Republicans to kill the bill because he didn’t want the problem solved while Joe Biden was president. Bruce Joffe Piedmont Biden’s court talk is election year politicking Re: “Biden drags the high court into politics before election” (Page A9, Aug. 4). In regard to Nolan Finley’s opinion piece, I’d just add this: President Biden recently recommended that the justices of the U.S. Supreme Court have their times in office limited. These sound like odd words when coming from the lips of a man who was in the U.S. Senate for 36 years, during which time he never suggested that senators have their time in office be limited. Rules for thee but not for me? Or perhaps it’s just more election-year politicking. Daniel Mauthe Livermore Readers deserve more than denouncing reform Re: “Biden drags the high court into politics before election” (Page A9, Aug. 4). Nolan Finley’s op-ed was an insult to our intelligence. These unelected extremists seized power as a result of Republican Mitch McConnell’s manipulation and rewriting of Senate rules to steal two Supreme Court openings that should have been filled by Democratic presidents and hand them to Trump. Their financial, legal and personal corruption is unprecedented. So Finley denounces President Biden for trying to reform it? Your readers deserve better.

It’s my dream, I’m very happy,’ the 25-year-old Algerian told BBC through an interpreter. ‘My family is happy. The whole of Algeria is happy today. Eight years of work. Eight years of no sleep… Today I’m very happy to win the gold medal.’ Khelif beat Yang Liu of China 5:0 in the final of the women’s welterweight division, wrapping up the best series of fights of her boxing career with a victory at Roland Garros, where crowds chanted her name, waved Algerian flags and roared every time she landed a punch. After her unanimous win, Khelif jumped into her coaches’ arms, one of them putting her on his shoulders and carrying her around the arena in a victory lap as she pumped her fists and grabbed an Algerian flag from someone in the crowd. Khelif was completely dominant in Paris, winning every round on every judge’s scorecard in each of her three fights that went the distance. But it was the fight that didn’t go the distance – her win over Angela Carini of Italy – that ignited controversy. Carini abandoned their bout after just 46 seconds, saying she was in too much pain from Khelif’s punches. An already brewing story suddenly became major international news, with the likes of former U.S. President Donald Trump and ‘Harry Potter’ author J.K. Rowling weighing in with criticism and false speculation about men competing with women in sports. Carini later said she regretted her actions and wished to apologize to Khelif. That controversy seemed irrelevant on Friday as Khelif was celebrating with her fellow Algerians, many of whom were in attendance in Paris. ‘Yeah I want to thank all the people of Algeria that have come out to Paris,’ said Khelif, who was assigned ‘female’ at birth and has always been listed as a woman on her passport – the International Olympic Committee threshold for eligibility. ‘I want to thank the people of Algeria across the world!’ Khelif has certainly been among the most polarizing people at the Paris Olympics. Fans have embraced Khelif in Paris even as she faced an extraordinary amount of scrutiny from world leaders, major celebrities and others who have questioned her eligibility or falsely claimed she was a man. It has thrust her into a larger divide over changing attitudes toward gender identity and regulations in sports. That continued on Friday night as Riley Gaines, a former NCAA swimmer and critic of trans women in sports, continued to accuse Khelif of a man. (Again, Khelif is not trans and was assigned ‘female’ at birth) ‘Ask yourself what this is teaching the next generation,’ Gaines wrote on X. ‘It’s teaching boys it’s okay (actually, it’s encouraged & rewarded) to beat up on women. It’s teaching girls to ignore their instincts, take the abuse with a smile on their face, & don’t dare question it…or else.’ Previously, Khelif told SNTV, a sports video partner of The Associated Press, last weekend that a gold medal would be ‘the best response’ to the backlash against her. She also said the wave of hateful scrutiny she has received ‘harms human dignity’ and called for an end to bullying athletes. But accounts from Algeria were decidedly more supportive. ‘Algerian women continue to make us proud,’ read a post from one of the country’s soccer X accounts, Algeria FC. ‘Insane mental strength required to compete at a high level after receiving all that hate and overcome it through performance,’ one fan wrote. ‘Well deserved Gold for Imane Khelif.’ Much of the controversy stems from the Russian-dominated International Boxing Association’s decision to disqualify Khelif and fellow two-time Olympian Li Yu-ting of Taiwan from last year’s world championships, claiming both failed a murky eligibility test for women’s competition. The International Olympic Committee took the unprecedented step last year of permanently banning the IBA from the Olympics following years of concerns about its governance, competitive fairness and financial transparency. The IOC has called the arbitrary sex tests that the sport’s governing body imposed on the two boxers irretrievably flawed. The IOC has repeatedly reaffirmed the two boxers’ right to compete in Paris, with President Thomas Bach personally defending Khelif and Lin while calling the criticism ‘hate speech.’ ‘We have two boxers who are born as women, who have been raised as women, who have a passport as a woman and have competed for many years as women,’ Bach said. That hasn’t stopped the international outcry tied to misconceptions around the fighters that has been amplified by Russian disinformation networks. It also hasn’t slowed two boxers who have performed at the highest levels of their careers while under the spotlight’s glare. Khelif’s gold medal is Algeria’s first in women’s boxing. She is only the nation’s second boxing gold medalist, joining Hocine Soltani (1996) while claiming the seventh gold medal in Algeria’s entire Olympic history. While Khelif drew enthusiastic, flag-draped fans in Paris, she also has become a hero in her North African country. Many have seen the world’s dissection of Khelif as criticism of their nation. Khelif’s fight was dubbed ‘The Night of Destiny’ in local newspapers, with projection screens to watch the bout set up in public squares throughout Algiers and other cities. In the city of Tiaret in the region where Khelif is from, workers braved scorching summer heat to paint a mural of Khelif on the gym where she learned to box. ‘Imane has managed to turn the criticism and attacks on her femininity into fuel,’ said Mustapha Bensaou of the Tiaret gym. ‘The slander has given her a boost. … It’s a bit of a blessing in disguise.’ Khelif won the first round over Yang on all five judges’ cards despite showing a bit less aggression than earlier in the tournament. Khelif then knocked Yang back against the ropes with a combination early in the second, although Yang responded with a flurry of shots and fought gamely. Khelif won the second round and cruised through the third, staying away from Yang just enough to avoid any serious threat. Khelif did a triumphant boxer’s shuffle in the final seconds of the bout before the boxers hugged. When the verdict was announced, Khelif saluted and then pumped her arm with glee. Khelif smiled broadly during the medal ceremony and waved to the crowd. She sang Algeria’s national anthem with passion before kissing her gold medal. The four medalists — boxing gives out two bronze — then posed for a podium selfie, clasping hands and raising them together. The gold medal fight was the culmination of Khelif’s nine-day run through an Olympic tournament that began with a bizarre event. Khelif has never done as well in another international tournament as she did in these Olympics. When she was cast as some sort of unstoppable punching machine last week by pundits and provocateurs who had never seen her fight before, opponents and teammates who knew her were shocked by the characterization. Then she lived up to the notion of being one of the best Olympic boxers in the world. Lin also fights for a gold medal Saturday on the final card of the Olympics. She takes on Julia Szeremeta of Poland with a chance to win Taiwan’s first boxing gold.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nImane Khelif credited &#8216;eight years of work&#8217; and &#8216;eight years of no&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Imane Khelif Attributes Olympic Boxing Gold Victory to Dedication and Hard Work Despite Gender Controversy first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/news/us/imane-khelif-attributes-olympic-boxing-gold-victory-to-dedication-and-hard-work-despite-gender-controversy/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/rewrite-this-title-Algerias-Imane-Khelif-credits-eight-years-of.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-08-09 23:22:37","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.318},{"id":253790642,"title":"“Bachelorette” star James Taylor accused of shoving woman to ground, preventing her from leaving his home: Police","text":"More details have emerged surrounding the arrest of Bachelor Nation's James McCoy Taylor.

As she was trying to exit the front door, Taylor allegedly \"pushed the door closed\" and \"started kissing her\" before he \"threw her to the ground\" and groped her, the officer wrote, adding that he observed photos of \"multiple contusions\" on the woman's hips and buttocks. She \"was able to wiggle free and escape through the front door,\" read the report. The officer wrote that when he spoke to Taylor, the reality star maintained that the encounter was \"consensual.\" The officer later added that he did not believe Taylor was \"truthful in this interview,\" and thus requested the warrant.

Taylor was arrested by the College Station Police Department on Aug. 4 and released the same day on two $4,000 surety bonds. Taylor has not responded to EW's requests for comment, but he denied the allegations in a statement to PEOPLE following his arrest. \"I would never hurt anybody,\" he said. \"I’m nice to EVERY person I meet.\" He was previously arrested in his native Texas in 2022 on charges pertaining to driving while intoxicated and unlawfully carrying a weapon. The year prior, Taylor, an outspoken Donald Trump supporter, was declared \"exiled\" from Bachelor Nation by series creator Mike Fleiss after he encouraged people to storm the Capitol on Jan. 6.","summary":"The controversial Bachelor Nation alum appeared on JoJo Fletcher&#39;s season of &#34;The Bachelorette.&#34;","url":"https://ew.com/bachelorette-star-james-taylor-accused-shoving-woman-preventing-leaving-police-8693538","image":"https://ew.com/thmb/l0lUsntb7QWd4CECI03rCgH2S_E=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/James-McCoy-Taylor-080524-74d5af87d1fe4f7588ce010ac597746d.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-08-09 23:22:25","author":"Jessica Wang","authors":["Jessica Wang"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.411},{"id":253790434,"title":"Hochul says NY Dems should tack moderate but they’re still letting lefties drive policies","text":"New York Democrats should “just try to be moderate,” Gov. Hochul pleaded at an Aspen Institute gathering last week. Good luck with that, Kat. She was answering a question about how to win in areas that went for Donald Trump in 2020, and it’s damning that the best she could advise was to try. In fact, even the Dems who know better have largely given up on seeking centrism because the radical lefties are in control: They’d rather defeat you in a primary, even if a Republican winds up winning the odd seat. Hochul herself doesn’t do much more: She talks moderate, especially since her 2022 close call against ex-Rep. Lee Zeldin in 2022 and the loss of several House seats that flipped control to Republicans, but she’s stymied by the extremists who run the Legislature; they wouldn’t even let her install a non-lefty as the new state chief judge. With control of the House at stake again this fall, House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries would love nothing more than to have centrists like Long Island Rep. Tom Suozzi and Westchester County Executive George Latimer (who ousted the Squad’s Rep. Jamal Bowman in a June primary) be the face of the party. But the tide’s still against them. Right after Bowman’s defeat, Working Families Party co-executive director Ana Maria Archila declared: “The left wasn’t defeated. We grew our ranks.” True — Archilla’s WFP is adding three more lefties to a socialist bloc that will make it harder for Assembly Speaker Carl Heastie and upstate moderates to block terrible moves on housing, criminal justice and taxes. Heck, primary night also ousted Albany District Attorney David Soares — a crime-fighting moderate, who has sounded the alarm on the disastrous no-bail, burdensome discovery and Raise the Age criminal-justice reforms — in favor of a “progressive” public defender. Ex-Gov. George Pataki predicts that Republicans can elect the next New York City mayor if Democrats continue their leftward swing, and he may prove right (if the GOP can find a real candidate, anyway). Hochul’s “be moderate” advice may be sound, but she’s whistling past the Democratic moderates graveyard. The left’s not afraid to let Republicans win if they can defeat moderate Dems: Until the centrists start openly taking the same risks to beat back the radicals, they’re headed for extinction.","summary":"New York Democrats should “just try to be moderate,” Gov.

That is, the veep said Thursday that she wants to “get an interview scheduled before the end of the month.” It is the beginning of August… One interview, if she can fit it in, and so can . . . who? Rachel Maddow? Mika Brzezinski? Does she dare try Lester Holt again after she embarrassed herself with him last time? Fine, she’s busy campaigning, but it’s not like she has a real day job: President Biden (or whoever actually runs the country) has that covered. Meanwhile, she hasn’t suffered the examination of serious, potentially adversarial campaign press since she dropped out of the Democratic primaries in 2019. She simply parachuted into the 2024 nomination after Nancy Pelosi & Co. muscled Biden into dropping. Since then, he’s done more interviews than she has: It airs Sunday. She can’t match the pace of an 81-year-old man who’s also technically busy being leader of the free world? You have to think Donald Trump had it right the other day at his take-all-comers press conference: “She won’t even do interviews with friendly people, because she can’t do better than Biden.” Unlike Harris, who has the Dem-allied press eating out of the palm of her hand, Trump would actually have an excuse to avoid live press Q&As: The national media is overwhelmingly, and openly, hostile toward him, his supporters and the rest of the GOP (except, of course, for any Republican willing to dump on Trump). On top of his presser this week, Trump’s sat down for a wide-ranging interview with Time in April and another with Bloomberg Businessweek in July. He took fire from multiple directions at the July 31 National Association for Black Journalists convention. That’s how a democracy is supposed to work: Candidates face tough questions on their policies, record and vision for the country from watchdogs in the press, so come election time, Americans know what they’re getting. Yet Harris won’t even get near a media lapdog. J.D. Vance joined his ticket less than a month before she moved to the top of hers; Vance’s wife has since done more interviews than Harris. The veep won’t even flip-flop in her own voice: All her disclaimers of past radical positions have come via campaign flacks and press releases. Plainly, she’s afraid to try explaining why she held her looniest positions, let alone why she’s switched (at least until November). Let alone having to explain why, now that she’s promised to bring grocery prices down on her first day as prez, she can’t do anything about it now. Is Joe standing in the way? Democrats and their media pals have been talking up “saving democracy” for years now, yet they’re colluding in the least democratic presidential contest our lifetimes, and our parents’, too. Vance has taken to posting a count of how many days since Kamala faced the press; we don’t expect that to shame her into action, but we have some hope our colleagues will wake up and realize how badly they’re damaging their own brands, and the nation. Voters will start to wonder, too: If she can’t face down, say, Britt Hume or Peter Doocy, how will she possibly face Vladimir Putin? Seriously, and sincerely, Kam: You can do this, and you’re going to have to; putting it off too long only risks a disastrous performance too late in the game to recover.","summary":"On Thursday, Vice President Kamala Harris said she wanted to \"get an interview scheduled before the end of the month.\"","url":"https://nypost.com/2024/08/09/opinion/kamalas-vague-promise-of-upcoming-interview-is-an-offensive-joke/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/08/newspress-collage-v39b01f1o-1723242778111.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&1723228430&w=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-08-09 23:18:53","author":"Post Editorial Board","authors":["Post Editorial Board"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.256},{"id":253790298,"title":"Trump's plane diverted in Montana due to mechanical issue","text":"Former President Donald Trump's plane was forced to divert its landing in Montana Friday due to a mechanical issue, a law enforcement source confirmed to CBS News.

Trump's plane was en route to Bozeman, Montana, when it was diverted Friday afternoon to Billings, 142 miles to the east, according to Jenny Mockel, administrative assistant at Billings Logan International Airport. Mockel said the former president was continuing to Bozeman via private jet. The information you need to know, sent directly to you: Download the CTV News App Trump's campaign posted a video of him upon landing in which he said he was glad to be in Montana but did not mention anything about the landing. The former president came to Montana hoping to remedy some unfinished business from 2018, when he campaigned repeatedly in Big Sky Country in a failed bid to oust incumbent Democratic Sen. Jon Tester. Tester has tried to convince voters he's aligned with Trump on many issues, mirroring his successful strategy from six years ago. While that worked in a non-presidential election year, it faces a more critical test this fall with Tester's opponent, former Navy SEAL Tim Sheehy, trying to link the three-term incumbent to Democratic presidential candidate Kamala Harris. Harris has benefitted nationally from a burst of enthusiasm among core Democratic constituencies, who coalesced quickly around her after President Joe Biden withdrew from the campaign last month. She's drawn big crowds in swing states, touring this week with Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, her choice to be her vice-presidential nominee. Trump's only rally this week, meanwhile, will be in a state he won by 16 percentage points four years ago rather than a November battleground. Facing new pressure in the race from a candidate with surging enthusiasm, Trump on Thursday called questions about his lack of swing state stops \"stupid.\" \"I don't have to go there because I'm leading those states,\" he said. \"I'm going because I want to help senators and congressmen get elected.\" He will add on fundraising stops in Wyoming and Colorado. Trump could be decisive in Montana's Senate race Friday's rally at Montana State University, which is scheduled to start at 8 p.m. Mountain time, is expected to draw thousands of GOP supporters. Yet the former president's bigger impact could be simply having his name above Sheehy's on the ballot in November, said University of Montana political analyst Rob Saldin. \"There is a segment of the electorate that will turn out when Trump is on the ticket,\" Saldin said. And that could benefit Sheehy, a Trump supporter and newcomer to politics who made a fortune off an aerial firefighting business. Republicans have been on a roll in Montana for more than a decade and now hold every statewide office except for Tester's. Tester won each of his previous Senate contests by a narrow margin, casting himself as a plainspoken farmer who builds personal connections with people in Montana and is willing to break with his party on issues that matter to them. He's also become a prolific fundraiser. The race has drawn national attention with Democrats clinging to a razor-thin majority in the Senate and defending far more seats than the GOP this year. Tester is considered among the most vulnerable Democratic incumbents. For him to win, large numbers of Trump supporters would have to vote a split ticket and get behind the Democratic senator. Trump's drive to oust Tester traces back to the lawmaker's work in 2018 as chairman of the Senate Committee on Veterans' Affairs. Tester revealed past misconduct by Trump's personal physician, Ronny Jackson, that sank Jackson's nomination to lead the Veterans Affairs Department Then-president Trump took the matter personally and came to Montana four times to campaign for Republican Matt Rosendale, who was then the state auditor. Rosendale lost by three percentage points. Tester has positioned himself apart from national Democrats Before Trump's latest visit, Tester has sought to insulate himself against charges that he's part of the Democratic establishment by rolling out the names of Republicans who support him, including former Montana Gov. Marc Racicot. His campaign highlighted more than 20 pieces of legislation, many dealing with veterans' issues, that Tester sponsored and Trump signed. Tester also was the sole Democratic delegate from Montana to withhold a vote backing Harris as the party's presidential candidate in the wake of Biden's withdrawal. And when the Democratic National Convention takes place later this month in Chicago, Tester will be back in Montana \"farming and meeting face to face with Montanans,\" campaign spokesperson Harry Child said. The last time Tester attended the Democratic National Convention was in 2008. That's also the last time a Democratic presidential candidate came anywhere near winning Montana, with President Barack Obama losing by just over two percentage points. A similar situation is developing in Ohio, where three-term Democratic Sen. Sherrod Brown faces a tough race in a state expected to vote for Trump. Harris visited Ohio when the two were Senate colleagues to raise money for Brown's 2018 campaign, but Brown has said he has no plans to campaign with her this year. Like Tester, Brown has highlighted legislation he worked on that Trump signed into law. Friday's rally takes place in Gallatin County, which Tester has become increasingly reliant on over the course of his political career. He lost the county in his first Senate race, in 2006, but his support has since grown. A substantial margin of victory in Gallatin in 2018 helped push him ahead of Rosendale. Republican Don Seifert, a former Gallatin County commissioner, said he voted for Tester that year and plans to do so again this year. America Votes: Latest U.S. election news and analysis from a Canadian perspective Seifert backed Trump in 2016 and said he has continued to support other Republicans, including Montana Gov. Greg Gianforte and Sen. Steve Daines. \"Montanans tend to vote for the person over the party,\" Seifert said. \"For the state of Montana, Jon is the one that can do what we need.\" But Sheehy says Tester has lost touch with his home state and fallen into step with Democrats in Washington. The Republican said in a message this week to supporters that Tester was \"responsible for the rise of Kamala Harris\" because he served as chairman of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee from 2015 to 2017, when she was elected to the Senate from California. Tester has outraised Sheehy by more than three-to-one in campaign donations reported to the Federal Election Commission. However, outside groups supporting Sheehy have helped the Republican make up much of that gap. Spending in the race is on track to exceed US$200 million as advertisements from the two sides saturate Montana's airwaves. ---- Associated Press reporter Julie Smyth contributed from Columbus, Ohio.","summary":"Former U.S. president Donald Trump headed to Montana for a Friday night rally in hopes of ousting the state's Democratic senator, but his plane first had to divert to an airport on the other side of the Rocky Mountains because of a mechanical issue, according to airport staff.","url":"https://www.ctvnews.ca/world/trump-plane-heading-to-montana-rally-was-diverted-but-landed-safely-nearby-airport-staff-says-1.6995705","image":"https://www.ctvnews.ca/content/dam/ctvnews/en/images/2024/8/9/donald-trump-plane-1-6995719-1723244948395.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-08-09 23:14:35","author":"Matthew Brown And Amy Beth Hanson,The Associated Press","authors":["Matthew Brown And Amy Beth Hanson","The Associated Press"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"ca","sentiment":-0.399},{"id":253790906,"title":"Trump plane heading to Montana rally was diverted but landed safely nearby, airport staff says","text":"BOZEMAN, Mont. — Former President Donald Trump headed to Montana for a Friday night rally in hopes of ousting the state’s Democratic senator, but his plane first had to divert to an airport on the other side of the Rocky Mountains because of a mechanical issue, according to airport staff.

Rosendale lost by 3 percentage points. Before Trump’s latest visit, Tester has sought to insulate himself against charges that he’s part of the Democratic establishment by rolling out the names of Republicans who support him, including former Montana Gov. Marc Racicot. His campaign highlighted more than 20 pieces of legislation, many dealing with veterans’ issues, that Tester sponsored and Trump signed. Tester also was the sole Democratic delegate from Montana to withhold a vote backing Harris as the party’s presidential candidate in the wake of Biden’s withdrawal. And when the Democratic National Convention takes place later this month in Chicago, Tester will be back in Montana ‘farming and meeting face to face with Montanans,’ campaign spokesperson Harry Child said. The last time Tester attended the Democratic National Convention was in 2008. That’s also the last time a Democratic presidential candidate came anywhere near winning Montana, with President Barack Obama losing by just over 2 percentage points. Sheehy says Tester has lost touch with his home state and fallen into step with Democrats in Washington. The Republican said in a message this week to supporters that Tester was ‘responsible for the rise of Kamala Harris’ because he served as chairman of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee from 2015 to 2017, when she was elected to the Senate from California. Tester has outraised Sheehy by more than three-to-one in campaign donations reported to the Federal Election Commission. However, outside groups supporting Sheehy have helped the Republican make up much of that gap. Spending in the race is on track to exceed $200 million as advertisements from the two sides saturate Montana´s airwaves.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nDonald Trump&#8217;s plane has been forced to divert en route to a&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Donald Trump&#8217;s aircraft had to change course and make an unplanned stop because of a mechanical problem. first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/news/us/donald-trumps-aircraft-had-to-change-course-and-make-an-unplanned-stop-because-of-a-mechanical-problem/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/rewrite-this-title-Donald-Trumps-plane-forced-to-divert-and.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-08-09 23:09:27","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.268},{"id":253789998,"title":"Kamala Harris could make history as the first president to work at McDonald’s","text":"The next president of the United States could be a former McDonald’s employee. More than 13 percent of Americans, or roughly 41 million people, have worked at a McDonald’s restaurant at some point in their lives. That includes Kamala Harris, who worked at a restaurant for a summer while she was in college. Harris mentioned her brief stint on the fryer when she joined the picket line with fast food workers in Las Vegas in 2019 and during an appearance on The Drew Barrymore Show in April. (Her order? “Quarter pounder with cheese and fries,” and barbecue sauce for dipping if she gets McNuggets). Now, the Democratic presidential candidate’s campaign is nodding to her summer job to highlight her upbringing and a platform to boost American workers that stands in stark contrast to her Republican rival Donald Trump, who “has no plan to help the middle class — just more tax cuts for billionaires,” according to a recent ad. McDonald’s is all over influential Americans’ resumes (former House Speaker Paul Ryan and Amazon founder Jeff Bezos have also worked in McDonald’s restaurants), but service worker labor unions and fast food employees have been leading nationwide efforts to improve working conditions for lower-wage workers, including calls to boost the federal hourly minimum wage to at least $15. They could soon have a powerful advocate in one of their former coworkers. Harris — who has earned endorsements from several influential unions, including Service Employees International Union, which supported the nationwide Fight for $15 campaign — stood with striking McDonald’s workers and protesters as she was launching her first presidential campaign. “If we want to talk about these golden arches being a symbol of the best of America, well, the arches are falling short,” she said from Las Vegas in June 2019. “We have got to recognize that working people deserve livable wages.” “I did the french fries and I did the ice cream,” she told workers. “There was not a family relying on me to pay the rent, put food on the table and keep the bills paid by the end of the month,” she added. “But the reality of McDonald’s is that a majority of the folk who are working there today are relying on that income to sustain a household and a family.” Fast food jobs are often denigrated as temporary employment for teenagers looking for summer work, echoing Republicans’ “bootstraps” mentality that frequently overlooks the more than 3 million fast food workers across the US; in 2022, the typical fast food worker was a 26-year-old woman making just over $13 an hour, according to federal labor data. McDonald’s corporate-owned restaurants raised their hourly wage up to $17 in 2021, though roughly 95 percent of the company’s 14,000 restaurants are independently owned, with separate wage rates. The company has stated that it recognizes workers’ rights to join a union. When President Joe Biden tapped her as his running mate in 2020, Harris renewed her support for raising the federal minimum hourly wage to $15, which is nearly double the current minimum wage of $7.25 — which has not been raised since 2009. “Raising the minimum wage is about the floor and not the ceiling,” she said during a virtual rally with fast food workers and Senator Bernie Sanders in October 2020. Most states have raised their minimum wages above the federal minimum, but $7.25 an hour remains the minimum wage in 20 others. Georgia and Wyoming have set their minimum to just $5.15, lower than the federal rate, which applies instead. Raising the federally set minimum wage from $7.25 to $15 an hour would lift nearly 1 million people out of poverty and raise wages for more than 30 million Americans, according to the federal government’s nonpartisan budget office. Congress failed to approve a minimum wage hike as part of a larger COVID-19 aid package in 2021. The vice president, who acts as the Senate’s presiding officer, was under pressure from a group of congressional Democrats at the time to ignore nonbinding guidance that the measure could be included in that legislation. Fast food workers in California won a major victory earlier this year with a measure that raises the hourly minimum wage to $20. The state also has the first fast food workers union, through the Service Employees International Union, after more than a decade of labor battles and strikes at 450 restaurants to have a seat at the table. The Raise the Wage Act, which has stalled in a deadlocked Congress, would gradually raise the federal minimum wage to $17 per hour by 2029. The subminimum wage for tipped workers – which is set at $2.13 an hour — would effectively be eliminated by 2030. Harris co-sponsored a version of that legislation when she was a senator. Nearly 30 percent of US workers, roughly 44 million people, make less than $17 per hour, according to the Economic Policy Institute. The “real” value of the federal minimum wage has gradually declined, reaching a 66-year low in 2023, with its buying power worth 42 percent less than it did at its highest point in 1968, according to the think tank. “This significant loss in purchasing power means that the federal minimum wage today is nowhere close to a living wage,” according to a 2023 report. A “real” minimum wage — if it kept pace with inflation and productivity growth — would be $23 an hour by now, according to the Center for Economic and Policy Research. “Vice President Harris is the daughter of a working mother and worked at a McDonald’s to put herself through college,” according to a statement from campaign senior spokesperson Lauren Hitt. “She knows what middle-class families go through,” she added. “Donald Trump, on the other hand, is running to give more handouts to his ultra-wealthy friends at the expense of working Americans. That’s the contrast voters are going to see between now and Election Day.”","summary":"Fast food workers fighting for union recognition, higher minimum wages and better working conditions could have a powerful advocate in a former fellow french fry cook, Alex Woodward reports","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/kamala-harris-mcdonalds-minimum-wage-b2594233.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2024/08/09/19/mc-copy.jpg?width=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-08-09 23:07:39","author":"Alex Woodward","authors":["Alex Woodward"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":0.293},{"id":253789906,"title":"Boxer Imane Khelif wins Olympic gold after facing gender misconceptions","text":"Algerian boxer Imane Khelif has won a gold medal Friday at the Paris Olympics, emerging as a champion from a tumultuous run at the Games where she endured intense scrutiny in the ring and online abuse from around the world over misconceptions about her womanhood. Ms. Khelif beat Yang Liu of China 5:0 in the final of the women’s welterweight division, wrapping up the best series of fights of her boxing career with a victory at Roland Garros, where crowds chanted her name, waved Algerian flags and roared every time she landed a punch. After her unanimous win, Ms. Khelif jumped into her coaches’ arms, one of them putting her on his shoulders and carrying her around the arena in a victory lap as she pumped her fists and grabbed an Algerian flag from someone in the crowd. Those cheering fans have embraced Ms. Khelif throughout her run in Paris even as she faced an extraordinary amount of scrutiny from world leaders, major celebrities, and others who have questioned her eligibility or falsely claimed she was a man. It has thrust her into a larger divide over changing attitudes toward gender identity and regulations in sports. Ms. Khelif told SNTV, a sports video partner of The Associated Press, last weekend that the wave of hateful scrutiny she has received “harms human dignity,” and she called for an end to bullying athletes. She also said a gold medal would be “the best response” to the backlash against her. It stems from the Russian-dominated International Boxing Association’s decision to disqualify Ms. Khelif and fellow two-time Olympian Li Yu-ting of Taiwan from last year’s world championships, claiming both failed a murky eligibility test for women’s competition. The International Olympic Committee took the unprecedented step last year of permanently banning the IBA from the Olympics following years of concerns about its governance, competitive fairness and financial transparency. The IOC has called the arbitrary sex tests that the sport’s governing body imposed on the two boxers irretrievably flawed. The IOC has repeatedly reaffirmed the two boxers’ right to compete in Paris, with President Thomas Bach personally defending Ms. Khelif and Ms. Lin while calling the criticism “hate speech.” “We have two boxers who are born as women, who have been raised as women, who have a passport as a woman and have competed for many years as women,” Mr. Bach said. That hasn’t stopped the international outcry tied to misconceptions around the fighters that has been amplified by Russian disinformation networks. It also hasn’t slowed two boxers who have performed at the highest levels of their careers while under the spotlight’s glare. Ms. Khelif’s gold medal is Algeria’s first in women’s boxing. She is only the nation’s second boxing gold medalist, joining Hocine Soltani (1996). Hundreds of flag-clad, noise-making supporters of Ms. Khelif crowded the paths through the famed Roland Garros tennis complex in Paris and packed the stands, chanting, cheering and waving Algerian flags. Ms. Khelif also has become a hero across her North African country where many fans have seen the world’s dissection of Ms. Khelif as criticism of their nation. Her fight was dubbed “The Night of Destiny” in local newspapers. Projection screens to watch the bout were set up in public squares throughout Algiers and other cities. In the city of Tiaret, in the region where Khelif is from, workers braved scorching summer heat to paint a mural of Ms. Khelif on the gym where she learned to box. “Imane has managed to turn the criticism and attacks on her femininity into fuel,” said Mustapha Bensaou of the Tiaret gym. “The slander has given her a boost. ... It’s a bit of a blessing in disguise.” The gold medal fight is the culmination of Ms. Khelif’s nine-day run through an Olympic tournament that began with a bizarre event. Ms. Khelif’s first opponent, Angela Carini of Italy, abandoned their bout after just 46 seconds, saying she was in too much pain from Ms. Khelif’s punches. An already brewing story suddenly became major international news, with the likes of former U.S. President Donald Trump and “Harry Potter” author J.K. Rowling weighing in with criticism and false speculation about men competing with women in sports. Italian Premier Giorgia Meloni personally visited with Ms. Carini to share her condolences and to cast doubt on Ms. Khelif’s eligibility. Ms. Carini later said she regretted her actions and wished to apologize to Ms. Khelif. The Italian newspaper La Stampa detailed Ms. Carini’s mindset in the days leading up to the bout, describing pressure from both inside and outside her team to avoid the fight amid the growing speculation over Ms. Khelif’s status. Ms. Khelif has never done as well in another international tournament as she did in these Olympics. When she was cast as some sort of unstoppable punching machine last week by pundits and provocateurs who had never seen her fight before, opponents and teammates who know her were shocked by the characterization. Then she lived up to the notion of being one of the best Olympic boxers in the world. The banished governing body for boxing did nothing to help its argument about her disqualification at the world championships last year during a shambolic news conference in which its leadership contradicted itself about the tests and declined to answer basic questions about them, citing privacy concerns from the Olympic committees of Algeria and Taiwan. Ms. Lin also fights for a gold medal Saturday on the final card of the Olympics. She takes on Julia Szeremeta of Poland with a chance to win Taiwan’s first boxing gold. This story was reported by The Associated Press.","summary":"Imane Khelif was cheered to victory by crowds chanting her name in Paris.

Kennedy Jr. for president after his glowing words about the long-shot independent presidential candidate drew scorn from Donald Trump supporters — and even a jab from the Republican nominee. The “Joe Rogan Experience” host posted a clarification on X following remarks he made on a recent episode in which he praised Kennedy for his “civility.” “For the record, this isn’t an endorsement,” the Spotify podcaster wrote on X “This is me saying that I like RFKjr as a person, and I really appreciate the way he discusses things with civility and intelligence. I think we could use more of that in this world.” Rogan also went on to praise Trump for his reaction following the July 13 assassination attempt, but did not endorse the GOP candidate. “I also think Trump raising his fist and saying ‘fight!’ after getting shot is one of the most American f—ing things of all time,” he wrote. “I’m not the guy to get political information from.” Rogan caused consternation in Trump circles Thursday when he sounded like he was throwing his sizable frame and support behind Kennedy. “That’s politics. They do it on the left. They do it on the right. They gaslight you, they manipulate you. They promote narratives,” Rogan said on the podcast. “The only one who’s not doing that is Robert F. Kennedy Jr. I am a fan [of RFK Jr]. He’s the only one that makes sense to me. He doesn’t attack people. He attacks actions and ideas. He’s much more reasonable and intelligent.” Trump posted his own message on his Truth Social platform on Friday: “It will be interesting to see how loudly Joe Rogan gets BOOED the next time he enters the UFC Ring???” “MAGA 2024,” Trump wrote. Rogan moonlights as a commentator for UFC fights. Trump has been a frequent guest at UFC events, where fans shower him with standing ovations. During one event, Trump and Rogan were seen shaking hands. Many Trump-backing social media users tore into Rogan over his support for Kennedy. One X user with the handle “Catturd” said Rogan is “the same f–king idiot who endorsed Bernie Sanders.” “He’s the podcast equivalent of a dumb blonde joke,” the X account’s author wrote. But other pro-Trump voices came to Rogan’s defense, including Matt Walsh of Daily Wire, who wrote: “The right wing accounts attacking him and disowning him today for saying nice things about RFK Jr are acting foolishly at best.” “You don’t turn on a guy who has been, is, and could continue to be a huge asset to you and your movement just because he didn’t endorse Trump.” Rogan, whose audience of millions of listeners tend to be overwhelmingly males who lean toward the political right, has been critical of Trump over the years. Last year, it was reported that he repeatedly turned down requests from Trump for an interview on his podcast. In 2022, Rogan told podcaster Lex Fridman: “I’m not a Trump supporter in any way, shape or form.” “I’ve had the opportunity to have him on my show more than once,” Rogan said. “I’ve said no every time. I don’t want to help him. I’m not interested in helping him.” That same year, Rogan referred to Trump as a “man baby” while speculating that he may be using Adderall. Rogan has courted controversy in the past, questioning the efficacy of the COVID vaccine as well as platforming of guests who have voiced critical views of the transgender movement. Spotify resisted calls to cut ties with Rogan, who makes millions of dollars a year and is the platform’s biggest draw.","summary":"Joe Rogan clarified on social media that he did not endorse Robert F.

Thousands of Algerian fans roared the 25-year-old welterweight to a unanimous decision over China’s reigning world champion Yang Liu, dominating their three-round bout before being carried on a lap of honour around the arena by her jubilant cornermen. Khelif and Chinese Taipei boxer Lin Yu-ting were both cleared to compete by the International Olympic Committee (IOC), despite being banned by the International Boxing Association (IBA) in 2023 for allegedly failing to meet gender eligibility criteria. “I am fully qualified to take part in this competition – I am a woman,” said Khelif at a post-fight press conference. “I was born a woman, I’ve lived as a woman and I’ve competed as a woman. There’s no doubt that there are enemies of success, and that gives my success a special taste because of these attacks.” The IBA had failed to provide any concrete evidence of the testing process or results at a chaotic press conference staged by the discredited governing body in Paris last week. The IBA has been barred from involvement in each of the last two Olympic boxing tournaments by the IOC over financial and corruption concerns and its president Umar Kremlev has repeatedly railed against the governance of IOC president Thomas Bach. Kremlev, or the IBA, has variously alleged the presence of XY chromosomes or elevated testosterone levels in tests supposedly submitted by Khelif and Lin, but the presented evidence has often been contradictory and is as yet unsubstantiated. Khelif added: “Since 2018 I’ve been boxing under the umbrella of the IBA. They know me very well and what I’m capable of. But now they are not recognised anymore and they hate me, and I don’t know why. I sent them a single message with this gold medal. “My message to the whole world is that they should commit to Olympic principles and they should not bully people. I hope that people will stop bullying, and I hope we will not see similar attacks in future Olympics.” The claim by her first opponent, Angela Carini, that she “had never been hit so hard” in the course of her 46-second defeat was seized upon by many public figures, including Donald Trump, Elon Musk and JK Rowling. Prior to her ban, which followed a win over previously unbeaten Russian prospect Azalia Amineva, Khelif had competed as as woman throughout her career. She first contested the World Championships in 2017 and was beaten by Ireland’s Kellie Harrington in the quarter-finals of the Tokyo Olympics. Liu, who won the 2023 world title in Khelif’s absence, was clearly second best in the opening exchanges but rallied in the second, catching her opponent with some sharp counter shots, only to once again lose the round and with it, effectively, the contest. Lin is scheduled to contest the women’s 57kg final against Poland’s Julia Szeremeta on Saturday.","summary":"The Algerian won Olympic gold in Paris.","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/olympics/lin-yuting-international-boxing-association-algerian-paris-international-olympic-committee-b2594274.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2024/08/10/00/583ebc726179f5bb5e2ca1147d55e320Y29udGVudHNlYXJjaGFwaSwxNzIzMzI5ODI3-2.77111692.jpg?width=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-08-09 22:52:15","author":"Mark Staniforth","authors":["Mark Staniforth"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.156},{"id":253789446,"title":"Donald Trump’s plane makes emergency landing ahead of rally","text":"Ex-President Donald Trump’s plane diverted to Billings Logan International Airport ahead of a rally he had scheduled in Bozeman (Picture: Getty Images) Ex-President Donald Trump’s airplane was diverted while heading to a rally that was set to take place in the evening.

Khelif then knocked Yang back against the ropes with a combination early in the second, although Yang responded with a flurry of shots and fought gamely. Khelif won the second round and cruised through the third, staying away from Yang just enough to avoid any serious threat. Khelif did a triumphant boxer's shuffle in the final seconds of the bout before the boxers hugged. When the verdict was announced, Khelif saluted and then pumped her arm with glee. Khelif smiled broadly during the medal ceremony and waved to the crowd. She sang Algeria's national anthem with passion before kissing her gold medal.

It stems from the Russian-dominated International Boxing Association's decision to disqualify Khelif and fellow two-time Olympian Li Yu-ting of Taiwan from last year's world championships, claiming both failed a murky eligibility test for women's competition. The International Olympic Committee took the unprecedented step last year of permanently banning the IBA from the Olympics following years of concerns about its governance, competitive fairness and financial transparency. The IOC has called the arbitrary sex tests that the sport's governing body imposed on the two boxers irretrievably flawed. The IOC has repeatedly reaffirmed the two boxers' right to compete in Paris, with President Thomas Bach personally defending Khelif and Lin while calling the criticism \"hate speech.\" \"We have two boxers who are born as women, who have been raised as women, who have a passport as a woman and have competed for many years as women,\" Bach said. That hasn't stopped the international outcry tied to misconceptions around the fighters that has been amplified by Russian disinformation networks. It also hasn't slowed two boxers who have performed at the highest levels of their careers while under the spotlight's glare. Khelif was completely dominant in Paris at a level she had never reached before: She won every round on every judge's scorecard in each of her three fights that went the distance. Khelif's gold medal is Algeria's first in women's boxing. She is only the nation's second boxing gold medalist, joining Hocine Soltani (1996) while claiming the seventh gold medal in Algeria's entire Olympic history. While Khelif drew enthusiastic, flag-draped fans in Paris, she also has become a hero in her North African country. Many have seen the world's dissection of Khelif as criticism of their nation. Khelif's fight was dubbed \"The Night of Destiny\" in local newspapers, with projection screens to watch the bout set up in public squares throughout Algiers and other cities. In the city of Tiaret in the region where Khelif is from, workers braved scorching summer heat to paint a mural of Khelif on the gym where she learned to box. \"Imane has managed to turn the criticism and attacks on her femininity into fuel,\" said Mustapha Bensaou of the Tiaret gym. \"The slander has given her a boost. ... It's a bit of a blessing in disguise.\" Khelif won the first round over Yang on all five judges' cards despite showing a bit less aggression than earlier in the tournament. Khelif then knocked Yang back against the ropes with a combination early in the second, although Yang responded with a flurry of shots and fought gamely. Khelif won the second round and cruised through the third, staying away from Yang just enough to avoid any serious threat. Khelif did a triumphant boxer's shuffle in the final seconds of the bout before the boxers hugged. When the verdict was announced, Khelif saluted and then pumped her arm with glee. Khelif smiled broadly during the medal ceremony and waved to the crowd. She sang Algeria's national anthem with passion before kissing her gold medal. The four medalists - boxing gives out two bronze - then posed for a podium selfie, clasping hands and raising them together. The gold medal fight was the culmination of Khelif's nine-day run through an Olympic tournament that began with a bizarre event. Khelif's first opponent, Angela Carini of Italy, abandoned their bout after just 46 seconds, saying she was in too much pain from Khelif's punches. An already brewing story suddenly became major international news, with the likes of former U.S. President Donald Trump and \"Harry Potter\" author J.K. Rowling weighing in with criticism and false speculation about men competing with women in sports. Carini later said she regretted her actions and wished to apologize to Khelif. Khelif has never done as well in another international tournament as she did in these Olympics. When she was cast as some sort of unstoppable punching machine last week by pundits and provocateurs who had never seen her fight before, opponents and teammates who knew her were shocked by the characterization. Then she lived up to the notion of being one of the best Olympic boxers in the world. Lin also fights for a gold medal Saturday on the final card of the Olympics. She takes on Julia Szeremeta of Poland with a chance to win Taiwan's first boxing gold.","summary":"Algerian boxer Imane Khelif has been thrust into a larger divide over changing attitudes toward gender identity and regulations in sports.","url":"https://abc13.com/post/imane-khelif-alegerian-boxer-wins-gold-cap-olympics-marked-scrutiny-sex/15166335/","image":"https://cdn.abcotvs.com/dip/images/15166317_Imane-Khelif-gold.jpg?w=1600","video":"https://vcl.abcotv.net/video/ccg/080924-CC-N1-Olympics-Fri-PKG2-vid.mp4","publish_date":"2024-08-09 22:49:18","author":null,"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.425},{"id":253789524,"title":"Dems’ childish obsession with Momala and ‘daddy’ Walz is beyond bizarre","text":"The Harris-Walz ticket has brought up some big feelings for some Democrats. Mostly about their parents. Or the politicians they want to elect as their surrogate Mama and Papa. As soon as Tim Walz was selected by Kamala Harris as her running mate, social media users started casting the progressive in Carhartt and camo as their make-believe father. “Tim Walz is the dad an entire generation wish they had instead of the one they lost to Fox News,” read one viral tweet by the X user coketweet. In the Minnesota guv, many see a perfect parental match for Harris — whom Drew Barrymore, in April, begged to “hug” the country. “I keep thinking in my head that we all need a mom,” Barrymore told Harris on her talk show. “But in our country, we need you to be Momala of the country.” What back then could have been brushed off as Barrymore’s own well-documented mommy issues has now become the overwhelmingly dominant sentiment of the left. Their mission is to elect Ma and Pa America — someone to hug them and soothe them. A pair to gentle-parent Dems to a better, more virtuous life, and maybe quietly slip them a beer if they’re a good boy or girl. As Liz Whitmer Gereghty, the sister of Michigan governor Gretchen Whtimer wrote on X: “So it will be a contest between Dems with serious cool parent vibes who would totally pick you up in the middle of the night to get you home safely vs the people they warned you about.” When did we all become so childish and submissive? We are supposed to be electing leaders who can stare down foreign despots, clean up a crisis at the border, ease inflation and make 15 tough decisions in a day. Not validate our feelings. This universe of neediness and imagined intimacy reveals the deep delusion of our unhealthy political culture. Elected officials — perfect strangers — are not your family. And your family is way more important than some narcissist with a government pension. Yet many newly-minted Walz fans are creating fan fiction about their dream daddy. Tiktok influencer Pamela Wurst Vetrini went viral with a video in which she says Walz “represents the dad that a lot of liberal women lost. A lot of us had moderate to conservative educated, sensible fathers that we lost to Rush Limbaugh, that we lost to Fox News. That we lost to Donald Trump and the cult of conservatism.” Meanwhile romance novel author Emily Rath cranked out her own seven-minute reel about the feelings Walz stirs in her. Through tears, she says that her father is a former fighter pilot with a chemistry degree from the Air Force Academy. Yet he “denounces climate change and basic facts about medicine … He is so smart … And to see what politics has done to him.” In my day, girls with daddy issues became strippers. Now they become insufferable progressive influencers. Maybe it’s time to call your dad instead of bashing him online. I understand that many people have replaced religion with politics and practice it fervently. But imagine having a father who is walking this Earth right now, alive and well, and trashing him over politics. Life is too short, family is too precious. Maybe these dads are difficult, but I guarantee these women — hardened ideologues — are too. Your relationship with your parents was not forged in cable news, so why let it die there? Also, Walz becoming Veep will not heal said relationship. Much of the media is reveling in this Walz “papa” fest. The Washington Post breathlessly tweeted about a $40 camo hat sold by the Harris/Walz campaign, calling it “a send-up of the Minnesota governor’s trademark Midwestern dad fashion, giving MAGA a run for its money.” Meanwhile, a Salon story declared, “Tim Walz’s normal dad energy is causing MAGA to come unglued.” But it’s mostly unglued folks on the left, who are creating familial fantasies about Harris and Walz. Sure, leaders and candidates can have maternal or paternal characteristics that endear them to us. But to form this parental attachment is creepy. It’s infantilizing and smacks of craving authoritarianism. These leaders ultimately work for you, the taxpayer. Personally, I don’t want any politician from the right or left as my parents. Though maybe some of these Dems simply want to recreate their childhood, where Mom and Dad paid for everything — but this time on the government’s dime. After all, as Walz on the recent “White Dudes for Harris” Zoom call said: “One person’s socialism is another person’s neighborliness.”","summary":"Imagine having a father who is walking this Earth right now, alive and well, and trashing him over politics.

Trump’s distinctive Boeing 757, nicknamed Trump Force One, was en route to Bozeman, where the Republican nominee for president will headline a campaign rally Friday night, when it was rerouted to Billings, about two hours to the east, at about 4:30 p.m. “His aircraft had mechanical issues, and he was diverted into the Billings-Logan Airport,” a spokesperson for the airport told The Post. “He’s continuing to Bozeman on a private jet,” they added. The nature of the mechanical issues are unclear. Trump, 78, appeared unfazed by the incident in a video shared on X by his campaign. “I just landed in a really beautiful place, Montana,” he said in the clip, while still aboard his plane. “So beautiful flying over, and you just look down, and that’s the way it’s supposed to be,” he added, noting that he has “a very high rating in Montana.” About an hour and half after landing in Billings, New York Times photographer Doug Mills captured images of Trump walking off his plane and boarding a “smaller” one to continue on to Bozeman for the rally. The Secret Service conducted a “complete sweep of the airport” before Trump was allowed to get on the new aircraft, local outlet KTVH reported. The rally in Bozeman will mark Trump’s first outdoor event since the July 13 assassination attempt in Butler, Pa. Republican Senate candidate Tim Sheehy, who is running to unseat Democratic Sen. Jon Tester, is expected to appear alongside Trump at the rally. The Trump campaign did not respond to The Post’s request for comment.","summary":"Trump’s plane was en route to a rally in Bozeman when it was rerouted to Billings, about two hours to the east, at about 4:30 p.m. ","url":"https://nypost.com/2024/08/09/us-news/trumps-plane-makes-unscheduled-landing-en-route-to-montana-rally-over-mechanical-issues/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/08/plane-former-president-republican-presidential-87497530.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/rpU96F4s-RyIcpnTz.mp4","publish_date":"2024-08-09 22:44:08","author":"Victor Nava","authors":["Victor Nava"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.262},{"id":253789058,"title":"Algeria's Khelif wins women's welterweight gold","text":"PARIS -- Algerian boxer Imane Khelif won a gold medal Friday at the Paris Olympics, emerging a champion from a tumultuous run at the Games where she endured intense scrutiny in the ring and online abuse from around the world over misconceptions about her womanhood. Khelif beat Yang Liu of China 5-0 in the final of the women's welterweight division, wrapping up the best series of fights of her boxing career with a victory at Roland Garros, where crowds chanted her name, waved Algerian flags and roared every time she landed a punch. After her unanimous win, Khelif jumped into her coaches' arms, one of them putting her on his shoulders and carrying her around the arena in a victory lap as she pumped her fists and grabbed an Algerian flag from someone in the crowd. \"For eight years, this has been my dream, and I'm now the Olympic champion and gold medalist,\" Khelif said through an interpreter. \"I want to thank all the people who have come to support me. All the people from Algeria and all the people at my base.\" Fans have embraced Khelif in Paris even as she faced an extraordinary amount of scrutiny from world leaders, major celebrities and others who have questioned her eligibility or falsely claimed she was a man.

Now celebrities are crawling out of the woodwork to join Kamalapalooza—including Uma Thurman, John Legend, Julia Louis-Dreyfus and Kerry Washington. And if the Democratic Party planners’ dreams come true? Beyoncé herself will be there in person to sing “Freedom” live as Kamala Harris formally accepts the nomination that delegates to the convention have already bestowed her. Queen Bey has already granted the Harris campaign permission to make her 2016 hit the theme song for the first ever Black female presidential nominee, and she is widely rumored to be the headliner on Thursday, August 22, the last night of the convention, when Harris will take the stage to give her acceptance speech. That type of star power would have been a big stretch for a Biden-fronted convention. Legend, who is married to the arguably more famous Chrissy Teigen, did not initially commit when asked to perform at the DNC when Joe Biden was still the nominee. That changed when Biden exited the race and Harris became the headliner on the Democratic ticket to take on Donald Trump in November. “They never said ‘no’ with Biden, just didn’t ever give an answer,” one source familiar with the discussions told The Daily Beast. And Louis-Dreyfus, who previously performed a series of comedy bits during Biden’s virtual convention in 2020 and has taken on new significance this time around with the resurgence of her HBO series Veep, seemed even more enthused about showing up for Harris in person this time, telling The Times of London that she will be “extra-involved” in the Harris campaign through to Election Day. It’s safe to say, DNC officials would love to see Beyoncé be part of history. DNC Chair Minyon Moore wrote in an op-ed for the Grio this week, “It’s hard to overstate the significance of this moment, for the first time ever—a Black woman has secured the presidential nomination of a major party. But history doesn’t just happen—it’s made. And it’s important for us to remember how we got here.” Other celebrities and musicians expected to attend this year’s convention, set to begin on August 19 in the Windy City, The Daily Beast hears, include Oscar nominees Jeffrey Wright (American Fiction) and Octavia Spencer (The Help), the vocal harmony group Boyz II Men, and a slew of actors who are members of the Creative Coalition, a nonpartisan arts advocacy organization. The group’s delegation will be led by Tim Daly and includes Thurman, Uzo Aduba, Sheryl Lee Ralph, Yvette Nicole Brown, Anthony Anderson, Jesse Tyler Ferguson, Busy Philipps, Jon Cryer, David Cross, Yolonda Ross, Iain Armitage, Chris Witaske and Danai Gurira. “Four weeks ago, we had a modicum of interest from the 51st State of Hollywood,” Robin Bronk, the CEO of the Creative Coalition, tells the Daily Beast. “Now we have a waiting list.” In fact, Bronk adds, “Everyone wants to get on our list.” The Democratic National Convention did not immediately respond to The Daily Beast’s request for comment about whether Beyoncé or other big-name celebrities would be performing or attending the event. Similar requests for comment to stars like George Clooney and Tom Hanks did not receive a response. Even if the Beyoncé rumors end up being too good to be true for Democrats, this year’s DNC is shaping up to be a repeat of Barack Obama’s first star-studded convention that drew major A-listers to Denver including Sting, Ben Affleck, Jennifer Lopez (back when “Bennifer” meant Jennifer Garner), Spike Lee, Scarlett Johansson, and many other big names. On the final night, leading up to Obama’s nomination speech, Jennifer Hudson belted the national anthem and artists like Steve Wonder and Sheryl Crow wowed the Mile High stadium crowd. So while concerned pundits had been warning that this year’s DNC in Chicago could serve as a bad flashback to the chaos of 1968 that presaged Richard Nixon’s landslide victory, it could end up looking a lot more like the convention that helped American make history in 2008. — Additional reporting by Mini Racker","summary":"Photo Illustration by Erin O'Flynn/The Daily Beast/Getty ImagesA month ago, Hollywood was ho-hum about the Democratic National Convention in Chicago this month.

This gesture is recognized by the Anti-Defamation League as a symbol used within the white power movement. The Department of Justice provided evidence of Dempsey’s violent behavior, including images of him clinging to tunnel frames and attacking officers with different objects. NBC reporter Ryan Reilly said on X that several witnesses observed Dempsey make the gesture Friday. The sentenced was handed down in Washington, D.C., by U.S. District Judge Royce Lamberth, an appointee of former President Ronald Reagan. These actions took place during the chaos at the U.S. Capitol, where Dempsey was captured on camera using a long pole to assault police officers. The severity of his actions led to the significant prison sentence imposed on him. The incident highlighted the extreme violence and aggression exhibited by some of the rioters on that infamous day. “Dempsey’s violence reached such extremes that, at one point, he attacked a fellow rioter who was trying to disarm him,” prosecutors wrote in a 46-page sentencing memorandum entered Aug. 2. According to The Associated Press, at his sentencing hearing on Friday, the former fast food restaurant employee and onetime construction worker addressed some of the officers he assaulted, saying: “You were performing your duties, and I responded with hostility and violence.” The stiff sentence is among the very steepest to emerge in the aftermath of the attack on the U.S. Capitol. Seditious conspirator and imprisoned former Proud Boys leader Henry “Enrique” Tarrio was sentenced to 22 years, as Law&Crime reported in September 2023. “David Dempsey is political violence personified,” Assistant U.S. Attorney Douglas Brasher said in court Friday. Dempsey’s defense attorney sought a sentence of six years and six months. Dempsey was arrested in California in August 2021 and an indictment was unveiled against him in September 2021. He was charged with felony obstruction of an official proceeding, felony assaulting, resisting or impeding certain officers using a dangerous weapon, felony obstruction of law enforcement during civil disorder, felony entering or remaining, disorderly and disruptive conduct and engaging in physical violence in a restricted building or grounds with a deadly or dangerous weapon, misdemeanor disorderly conduct in a Capitol building or grounds and act of physical violence in the Capitol grounds or building. He struck a plea deal with prosecutors in January and pleaded guilty to two assault with a dangerous weapon charges. Court records show that on Jan. 6, Dempsey doused police with a torrent of pepper spray including one officer who, just moments before, had his face mask compromised by a different rioter. Dempsey attacked another police officer ferociously with a metal crutch. He cracked that officer’s protective shield and gas mask, forcing the officer to “collapse in a daze, his ears ringing.” The blow by Dempsey also cut the officer’s head and caused a concussion. Dempsey swung “pole-like weapons more than 20 times” and sprayed chemical agents on at least three distinct occasions. He hurled objects at police at least 10 times and was seen “stomping on the heads of police officers as he perched above them some five times. He attempted to steal a riot shield and police baton while at the Lower West Terrace tunnel and he did it all while screaming threats and insults, prosecutors say. The Van Nuys man had burglary charges and no contest or nolo contendere pleas from 2020 and 2021 including one nolo contendere plea to assault with a caustic chemical in Los Angeles. In 2019 when a peaceful protest against then-President Donald Trump had formed at the Santa Monica Pier, Dempsey used bear spray on anti-Trump protesters at short range. Prosecutors said he also punched a demonstrator and hit him over the head with a skateboard. At another political protest in 2020, he sprayed an individual with pepper spray while holding them to the ground. Dempsey also hit that person with a metal bat. Many years earlier, in 2009 in Los Angeles, Dempsey pleaded no contest to second-degree burglary and was sentenced to 16 months. In 2012, he pleaded no contest to conspiracy and grand theft in Burbank and, in 2014, pleaded no contest to burglary charges again. In 2017 Dempsey pleaded no contest after he broke into a Van Nuys cellphone store, stole property and then fled. When police stopped Dempsey in 2017, prosecutors say he pretended to cooperate before fleeing in his car at speeds of over 100 mph.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nDavid Nicholas Dempsey was sentenced to 20 years in prison for his&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Rioter who rode mob to attack police sentenced to 20 years in prison first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/crime/rioter-who-rode-mob-to-attack-police-sentenced-to-20-years-in-prison/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/20-years-for-Jan-6-rioter-who-surfed-mob-to.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-08-09 22:36:31","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.4},{"id":253789240,"title":"Trump campaigns in Montana, Harris stumps in Arizona","text":"Trump campaigns in Montana, Harris stumps in Arizona Former President Donald Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris were on the campaign trail on Friday in Montana and Arizona, respectively.

They also show police expressing confusion and anger about why no law enforcement had been stationed on the roof. “I wasn’t even concerned about it because I thought someone was on the roof,” one officer says. He asked how “the hell” they could have lost sight of Crooks after spotting him acting suspiciously if law enforcement had been on top of the building. The other officer responded: “They were inside.” Trump was struck in the ear but avoided serious injury. One spectator was killed and two others were injured. Several investigations are underway into the security failures that led to the shooting. Acting Secret Service Director Ronald Rowe Jr., who took over after the resignation of former chief Kimberly Cheatle, has said he “cannot defend why that roof was not better secured.” The Secret Service controls the area after people pass through metal detectors, while local law enforcement is supposed to handle outside the perimeter. Rowe told lawmakers last month that Secret Service had “assumed that the state and locals had it” covered. A Secret Service spokesperson said Friday the agency is reviewing the body camera footage. “The U.S. Secret Service appreciates our local law enforcement partners, who acted courageously as they worked to locate the shooter that day,” spokesperson Anthony Guglielmi said in an email, “The attempted assassination of former President Donald Trump was a U.S. Secret Service failure, and we are reviewing and updating our protective policies and procedures in order to ensure a tragedy like this never occurs again.” Two officers from local county sniper teams were inside the complex of buildings and spotted Crooks acting strangely. One of them ran outside to look for Crooks while the other remained in the building on the second floor, according to Butler County District Attorney Richard Goldinger. But neither officer could see Crooks on top of the adjacent building from their second-floor position, Goldinger has said. Another video shows officers frantically looking for Crooks in the moments before the shooting. The video shows one officer help another climb up to the roof to investigate, spotting Crooks before dropping down and running to his car to grab his gun. There is no audio in the video until the officer is back at his car, grabbing his weapon, so it’s unclear what he said after seeing Crooks on the roof. It was not immediately clear whether the sound was not recorded, or if the audio had been redacted by police. The acting Secret Service director has said local law enforcement did not alert his agency before the shooting that an armed person had been spotted on a nearby roof. After the shooting, officers are seen in one video climbing onto the roof, where Crooks lay dead. Standing near his body, one of the officers says he was “(expletive) pissed” that police “couldn’t find him.” “I hear you bro,” the officer responds. “But for now, I mean, he’s the only one.” Lauer reported from Philadelphia.","summary":"A local police officer told a fellow officer after the attempted assassination of Donald Trump that he warned the Secret Service days earlier that the building where the 20-year-old gunman opened fire needed to be secured.","url":"https://www.ocregister.com/2024/08/09/trump-assassination-attempt-body-camera-footage/","image":"https://www.ocregister.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/AP24195841316454.jpg?w=1024","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-08-09 22:32:46","author":"Alanna Durkin Richer,Claudia Lauer","authors":["Alanna Durkin Richer","Claudia Lauer"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.631},{"id":253790590,"title":"Man who attacked police at the US Capitol with poles gets 20 years prison","text":"A California man with a history of political violence was sentenced on Friday (local time) to 20 years in prison for repeatedly attacking police with flagpoles and other makeshift weapons during the January 6, 2021, riot at the US Capitol. David Nicholas Dempsey's sentence is among the longest among hundreds of Capitol riot prosecutions. Prosecutors described him as one of the most violent members of the mob of Donald Trump supporters that attacked the Capitol as lawmakers met to certify Joe Biden's 2020 presidential election victory.

He swung poles at officers defending a tunnel, struck an officer in the head with a metal crutch and attacked police with pepper spray and broken pieces of furniture, prosecutors said. He climbed atop other rioters, using them like \"human scaffolding\" to reach officers guarding a tunnel entrance. He injured at least two police officers, prosecutors said. \"Your conduct on January 6th was exceptionally egregious,\" US District Judge Royce Lamberth told Dempsey. \"You did not get carried away in the moment.\" Dempsey pleaded guilty in January to two counts of assaulting police officers with a dangerous weapon. Only former Proud Boys leader Enrique Tarrio has received a longer sentence in the Jan. 6 attack. Tarrio was sentenced to 22 years for orchestrating a plot to stop the peaceful transfer of power from Trump to Joe Biden after the 2020 presidential election. Dempsey called his conduct \"reprehensible\" and apologised to the police officers whom he assaulted. \"You were performing your duties, and I responded with hostility and violence,\" he said before learning his sentence.

Dempsey's violence was so extreme that he attacked a fellow rioter who was trying to disarm him, prosecutors wrote. \"David Dempsey is political violence personified,\" Assistant US Attorney Douglas Brasher told the judge. Defence attorney Amy Collins, who sought a sentence of 6 years and six months, described the government's sentencing recommendation as \"ridiculous.\" \"It makes him a statistic,\" she said. \"It doesn't consider the person he is, how much he has grown.\" Dempsey was wearing a tactical vest, a helmet and an American flag gaiter covering his face when he attacked police at a tunnel leading to the Lower West Terrace doors. He shot pepper spray at Metropolitan Police Department Detective Phuson Nguyen just as another rioter yanked at the officer's gas mask, prosecutors wrote. \"The searing spray burned Detective Nguyen's lungs, throat, eyes, and face and left him gasping for breath, fearing he might lose consciousness and be overwhelmed by the mob,\" they wrote.

I was able to stand again and hold the line for a few more minutes until another assault by rioters pushed the police line back away from the threshold of the tunnel,\" Mastony said in a statement submitted to the court. Dempsey has been jailed since his arrest in August 2021. His criminal record in California includes convictions for burglary, theft and assault. The assault conviction stemmed from an October 2019, gathering near the Santa Monica Pier, where Dempsey attacked people peacefully demonstrating against then-President Trump, prosecutors said. \"The peaceful protest turned violent as Dempsey took a canister of bear spray from his pants and dispersed it at close range against several protesters,\" they wrote, noting that Dempsey was sentenced to 200 days of jail time.

By Friday morning, MAGA diehards were coming out in droves to attack the podcaster—leading him to clear the air just hours later. “For the record, this isn’t an endorsement,” Rogan wrote on X. “This is me saying that I like RFK Jr. as a person, and I really appreciate the way he discusses things with civility and intelligence.” Rogan didn’t offer Trump an endorsement either, but sought to appease his supporters by praising the former president’s response to the assassination attempt on his life last month. “I also think Trump raising his fist and saying ‘fight!’ after getting shot is one of the most American fucking things of all time.” Rogan’s U-turn came a little too late for the former Head of State. A few hours before Rogan retracted his pseudo-endorsement, Trump took to Truth Social to troll the podcaster for his failed kickboxing career. “It will be interesting to see how loudly Joe Rogan gets BOOED the next time he enters the UFC Ring???,” Trump wrote. “MAGA2024.” Rogan isn’t the only mega influencer MAGA has shamed into expressing support for Donald Trump recently.

Mockel said the former president was continuing to Bozeman via private jet.Trump’s campaign posted a video of him upon landing in which he said he was glad to be in Montana but did not mention anything about the landing.The former president came to Montana hoping to remedy some unfinished business from 2018, when he campaigned repeatedly in Big Sky Country in a failed bid to oust incumbent Democratic Sen. Jon Tester.Tester has tried to convince voters he’s aligned with Trump on many issues, mirroring his successful strategy from six years ago. While that worked in a non-presidential election year, it faces a more critical test this fall with Tester's opponent, former Navy SEAL Tim Sheehy, trying to link the three-term incumbent to Democratic presidential candidate Kamala Harris.Harris has benefitted nationally from a burst of enthusiasm among core Democratic constituencies, who coalesced quickly around her after President Joe Biden withdrew from the campaign last month. She's drawn big crowds in swing states, touring this week with Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, her choice to be her vice presidential nominee.Trump's only rally this week, meanwhile, will be in a state he won by 16 percentage points four years ago rather than a November battleground. Facing new pressure in the race from a candidate with surging enthusiasm, Trump on Thursday called questions about his lack of swing state stops “stupid.\"“I don’t have to go there because I’m leading those states,” he said. “I’m going because I want to help senators and congressmen get elected.”He will add on fundraising stops in Wyoming and Colorado.Trump could be decisive in Montana's Senate raceFriday's rally at Montana State University, which is scheduled to start at 8 p.m. Mountain time, is expected to draw thousands of GOP supporters. Yet the former president's bigger impact could be simply having his name above Sheehy's on the ballot in November, said University of Montana political analyst Rob Saldin.“There is a segment of the electorate that will turn out when Trump is on the ticket,\" Saldin said. And that could benefit Sheehy, a Trump supporter and newcomer to politics who made a fortune off an aerial firefighting business.Republicans have been on a roll in Montana for more than a decade and now hold every statewide office except for Tester’s.Tester won each of his previous Senate contests by a narrow margin, casting himself as a plainspoken farmer who builds personal connections with people in Montana and is willing to break with his party on issues that matter to them. He's also become a prolific fundraiser.The race has drawn national attention with Democrats clinging to a razor-thin majority in the Senate and defending far more seats than the GOP this year. Tester is considered among the most vulnerable Democratic incumbents.For him to win, large numbers of Trump supporters would have to vote a split ticket and get behind the Democratic senator.Trump’s drive to oust Tester traces back to the lawmaker’s work in 2018 as chairman of the Senate Committee on Veterans' Affairs. Tester revealed past misconduct by Trump’s personal physician, Ronny Jackson, that sank Jackson's nomination to lead the Veterans Affairs DepartmentThen-President Trump took the matter personally and came to Montana four times to campaign for Republican Matt Rosendale, who was then the state auditor. Rosendale lost by 3 percentage points.Tester has positioned himself apart from national DemocratsBefore Trump's latest visit, Tester has sought to insulate himself against charges that he's part of the Democratic establishment by rolling out the names of Republicans who support him, including former Montana Gov. Marc Racicot. His campaign highlighted more than 20 pieces of legislation, many dealing with veterans' issues, that Tester sponsored and Trump signed.Tester also was the sole Democratic delegate from Montana to withhold a vote backing Harris as the party's presidential candidate in the wake of Biden's withdrawal. And when the Democratic National Convention takes place later this month in Chicago, Tester will be back in Montana “farming and meeting face to face with Montanans,” campaign spokesperson Harry Child said.The last time Tester attended the Democratic National Convention was in 2008. That’s also the last time a Democratic presidential candidate came anywhere near winning Montana, with President Barack Obama losing by just over 2 percentage points.A similar situation is developing in Ohio, where three-term Democratic Sen. Sherrod Brown faces a tough race in a state expected to vote for Trump.Harris visited Ohio when the two were Senate colleagues to raise money for Brown's 2018 campaign, but Brown has said he has no plans to campaign with her this year. Like Tester, Brown has highlighted legislation he worked on that Trump signed into law.Friday's rally takes place in Gallatin County, which Tester has become increasingly reliant on over the course of his political career.He lost the county in his first Senate race, in 2006, but his support has since grown. A substantial margin of victory in Gallatin in 2018 helped push him ahead of Rosendale.Republican Don Seifert, a former Gallatin County commissioner, said he voted for Tester that year and plans to do so again this year.Seifert backed Trump in 2016 and said he has continued to support other Republicans, including Montana Gov. Greg Gianforte and Sen. Steve Daines.“Montanans tend to vote for the person over the party,” Seifert said. “For the state of Montana, Jon is the one that can do what we need.”But Sheehy says Tester has lost touch with his home state and fallen into step with Democrats in Washington. The Republican said in a message this week to supporters that Tester was “responsible for the rise of Kamala Harris” because he served as chairman of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee from 2015 to 2017, when she was elected to the Senate from California.Tester has outraised Sheehy by more than three-to-one in campaign donations reported to the Federal Election Commission. However, outside groups supporting Sheehy have helped the Republican make up much of that gap. Spending in the race is on track to exceed $200 million as advertisements from the two sides saturate Montana’s airwaves.","summary":"","url":"https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/trump-plane-heading-to-montana-rally-was-diverted-but-landed-safely-nearby-airport-staff-says/articleshow/112413421.cms","image":"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/resizemode-4,width-1280,height-720,msid-112413526/112413526.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-08-09 22:31:40","author":null,"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"in","sentiment":-0.355},{"id":253789238,"title":"Law enforcement on alert for violence at DNC after Trump shooting","text":"Law enforcement on alert for violence at DNC after Trump shooting A new federal threat assessment from the FBI and Department of Homeland Security is warning about potential attacks at the Democratic National Convention later in August.

The Trump strategy to detract attention from Harris was for Vance to shadow her this week, showing up wherever Harris and Walz went and having his own events—not rallies, because there’s no way he could draw a crowd, but “press appearances.” He was supposed to draw attention away from Harris and Walz with attacks. But he just came across as a weird stalker—even to Republicans. It did nothing to put a dent in Harris’ campaign. Her approval rating continues to surge, as does her polling head-to-head against Trump. Her rallies are huge, much to Trump’s dismay, and her fundraising has been massive. Harris’ headlines reflect all that: Just for comparison: Meanwhile, barring an appearance in Montana on Friday, Trump plans to stay off the campaign trail until at least after the Democratic National Convention ends on Aug. 22. No word yet on what’s planned for Vance. They might have decided to keep his appearances more private, since this week was pretty much a disaster for him. His “awkward” and “bizarre” stunt on the airport tarmac in Wisconsin stands out as the most memorable part of his week on the stump. He was all bluster, telling reporters, “I just wanted to check out my future plane,” and claiming that he “wanted to go say hello to the vice president and ask her why does she refuse to answer questions.” That too was a flop. All Vance got out of it was more bad press—“‘Creepy!’ CNN Morning Crew Torches Trump Pick Vance Over ‘Bizarre’ Kamala Harris Plane Stunt’”—and a roasting on social media. Like getting dragged by Liz Cheney. “Weird” is now baked in when it comes to Vance, and it’s showing. He’s even more unpopular now than just after he was picked, when he entered the race as “the first guy immediately following a convention—a VP pick—who actually had a net negative favorable rating, that is underwater,” according to CNN data analyst Harry Enten.

So far there have been $723 million worth of campaign ad buys for the three states, according to AdImpact data, reported by Axios. The figures include ad reservations made as of Aug. 7 through Election Day. Most of the money is going to the Ohio Senate race where Sen. Sherrod Brown (D-OH) is embroiled in one of the most high-stakes reelection battles against GOP opponent Bernie Moreno. The race has become 2024’s first non-presidential race to exceed $300 million in spending, and it’s also one of the most expensive races that the political ad tracking firm has seen. The only state in which Republicans have been outspending Democrats on campaign ads and reservations is Ohio, where they have spent $158.4 million compared to $152 million from Democrats. The majority of the cash is coming in from outside groups such as the Democratic Duty and Honor group, which invested $28.7 million and represents 51% of Democratic spending, while the Republican group One Nation spent $27.6 million, which represents 82% of Republican spending. Meanwhile, the Brown campaign has spent $27.6 million, compared to Moreno’s $875,000. The races between Sen. Bob Casey (D-PA) and Republican Dave McCormick in Pennsylvania and Sen. Jon Tester (D-MT) and Republican Tim Sheehy in Montana came in second and third place for spending for both parties. In Pennsylvania, Democrats have spent $111.2 million compared to Republicans’ $96.2 million. In Montana, Democrats have invested $110 million compared to Republicans’ $95 million. Nevada comes in fifth place on the list, with Democrats spending $72.2 million compared to Republicans’ $12 million. Michigan, another state with a competitive open Senate race, ranks eighth, with Democrats spending $43.2 million and Republicans are spending $26.9 million.

Khelif beat Yang Liu of China 5:0 in the final of the women’s welterweight division, wrapping up the best series of fights of her boxing career with a victory at Roland Garros, where crowds chanted her name, waved Algerian flags and roared every time she landed a punch. After her unanimous win, Khelif jumped into her coaches’ arms, one of them putting her on his shoulders and carrying her around the arena in a victory lap as she pumped her fists and grabbed an Algerian flag from someone in the crowd. Those cheering fans have embraced Khelif in Paris even as she faced an extraordinary amount of scrutiny from world leaders, major celebrities and others who have questioned her eligibility or falsely claimed she was a man. It has thrust her into a larger divide over changing attitudes toward gender identity and regulations in sports. Khelif told SNTV, a sports video partner of The Associated Press, last weekend that a gold medal would be “the best response” to the backlash against her. She also said the wave of hateful scrutiny she has received “harms human dignity” and called for an end to bullying athletes. It stems from the Russian-dominated International Boxing Association’s decision to disqualify Khelif and fellow two-time Olympian Li Yu-ting of Taiwan from last year’s world championships, claiming both failed a murky eligibility test for women’s competition. The International Olympic Committee took the unprecedented step last year of permanently banning the IBA from the Olympics following years of concerns about its governance, competitive fairness and financial transparency. The IOC has called the arbitrary sex tests that the sport’s governing body imposed on the two boxers irretrievably flawed. The IOC has repeatedly reaffirmed the two boxers’ right to compete in Paris, with President Thomas Bach personally defending Khelif and Lin while calling the criticism “hate speech.” “We have two boxers who are born as women, who have been raised as women, who have a passport as a woman and have competed for many years as women,” Bach said. That hasn’t stopped the international outcry tied to misconceptions around the fighters that has been amplified by Russian disinformation networks. It also hasn’t slowed two boxers who have performed at the highest levels of their careers while under the spotlight’s glare. Khelif was completely dominant in Paris at a level she had never reached before: She won every round on every judge’s scorecard in each of her three fights that went the distance. Khelif’s gold medal is Algeria’s first in women’s boxing. She is only the nation’s second boxing gold medalist, joining Hocine Soltani (1996) while claiming the seventh gold medal in Algeria’s entire Olympic history. While Khelif drew enthusiastic, flag-draped fans in Paris, she also has become a hero in her North African country. Many have seen the world’s dissection of Khelif as criticism of their nation. Khelif’s fight was dubbed “The Night of Destiny” in local newspapers, with projection screens to watch the bout set up in public squares throughout Algiers and other cities. In the city of Tiaret in the region where Khelif is from, workers braved scorching summer heat to paint a mural of Khelif on the gym where she learned to box. “Imane has managed to turn the criticism and attacks on her femininity into fuel,” said Mustapha Bensaou of the Tiaret gym. “The slander has given her a boost. … It’s a bit of a blessing in disguise.” Khelif won the first round over Yang on all five judges’ cards despite showing a bit less aggression than earlier in the tournament. Khelif then knocked Yang back against the ropes with a combination early in the second, although Yang responded with a flurry of shots and fought gamely. Khelif won the second round and cruised through the third, staying away from Yang just enough to avoid any serious threat. Khelif did a triumphant boxer’s shuffle in the final seconds of the bout before the boxers hugged. When the verdict was announced, Khelif saluted and then pumped her arm with glee. Khelif smiled broadly during the medal ceremony and waved to the crowd. She sang Algeria’s national anthem with passion before kissing her gold medal. The four medalists — boxing gives out two bronze — then posed for a podium selfie, clasping hands and raising them together. The gold medal fight was the culmination of Khelif’s nine-day run through an Olympic tournament that began with a bizarre event. Khelif’s first opponent, Angela Carini of Italy, abandoned their bout after just 46 seconds, saying she was in too much pain from Khelif’s punches. An already brewing story suddenly became major international news, with the likes of former U.S. President Donald Trump and “Harry Potter” author J.K. Rowling weighing in with criticism and false speculation about men competing with women in sports. Carini later said she regretted her actions and wished to apologize to Khelif. Khelif has never done as well in another international tournament as she did in these Olympics. When she was cast as some sort of unstoppable punching machine last week by pundits and provocateurs who had never seen her fight before, opponents and teammates who knew her were shocked by the characterization. Then she lived up to the notion of being one of the best Olympic boxers in the world. Lin also fights for a gold medal Saturday on the final card of the Olympics. She takes on Julia Szeremeta of Poland with a chance to win Taiwan’s first boxing gold.","summary":"Khelif beat Yang Liu of China 5:0 in the final of the women’s welterweight division, wrapping up the best series of fights of her boxing career.\n\n\nThe post Boxer Imane Khelif wins gold to cap an Olympics marked by scrutiny over her sex appeared first on Boston.com.","url":"https://www.boston.com/sports/sports/2024/08/09/2024-olympics-imane-khelif-algeria-boxing-gold-scrutiny-over-sex-gender/","image":"https://bdc2020.o0bc.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/YPFYPRXG6T57T3NSPPYT4SLBGQ-66b6953bc36ea-768x432.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-08-09 22:24:01","author":"Associated Press","authors":["Associated Press"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.422},{"id":253789588,"title":"'Georgia can go either way': Expert says Harris is now erasing Trump’s lead in swing states","text":"President Joe Biden's path to 270 electoral votes was very narrow, and depended entirely on the three so-called \"blue wall\" states of Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin.

In a Friday interview with MSNBC, Larry Sabato of the University of Virginia's Center for Politics said that thanks to growing enthusiasm around her candidacy, Harris is positioned well to win not only toss-up states like those in the Midwest, but also in other states that were previously favorable to former President Donald Trump.

He noted that even though former President Barack Obama won the Tar Heel State in 2008, he lost it in 2012, and it's remained in Republican hands since then. Harris winning the state would be a major victory, as North Carolina has voted for Republican presidential candidates in all but two elections dating back to 1976. And according to Sabato, North Carolina Republicans nominating an \"extreme\" candidate in this year's gubernatorial race in the form of Lieutenant Governor Mark Robinson could end up providing additional turnout from the state's more liberal voters who hope to keep the governorship in Democratic hands. \"That's one we're really watching. That is normally a Republican state,\" he said. \"The demographics in North Carolina are changing, and those who have professional degrees of one sort or another are becoming more dominant in certain parts of North Carolina.\" \"Some Republicans get turned off by the gubernatorial candidate, and they may not be excited about Donald Trump, and they may not vote,\" he added. \"So, will that happen? I don't know yet, it's too early to say. But it's certainly worth watching.\" READ MORE: Biden 'heavily' investing in these 3 states that are 'key to the whole election': analysis The Georgia electorate in 2020 not only delivered the Electoral College to Democrats, but also flipped two Republican-held U.S. Senate seats. The 2020 election and the 2021 runoff resulted in the Peach State voting for a Democratic presidential candidate and elected two Democratic senators for the first time in more than three decades. However, Georgia's Republican-dominated state government has since made adjustments to state election law that will make a Democratic victory in 2024 that much more difficult. Earlier this month, Georgia Republican Secretary of State Brad Raffensberger announced the rollout of a new website allowing any Georgian to challenge a voter registration in the Peach State. This is an accordance with a controversial new law passed by the GOP-controlled state legislature and signed into law by Brian Kemp allowing a Georgia resident to challenge an unlimited number of voter registrations.

Trump’s plane was en route to Bozeman, Montana, when it was diverted Friday afternoon to Billings, 142 miles to the east, according to Jenny Mockel, administrative assistant at Billings Logan International Airport. Mockel said the former president was continuing to Bozeman via private jet. Trump’s campaign posted a video of him upon landing in which he said he was glad to be in Montana but did not mention anything about the landing. The former president came to Montana hoping to remedy some unfinished business from 2018, when he campaigned repeatedly in Big Sky Country in a failed bid to oust incumbent Democratic Sen. Jon Tester. Tester has tried to convince voters he’s aligned with Trump on many issues, mirroring his successful strategy from six years ago. While that worked in a non-presidential election year, it faces a more critical test this fall with Tester’s opponent, former Navy SEAL Tim Sheehy, trying to link the three-term incumbent to Democratic presidential candidate Kamala Harris. Harris has benefitted nationally from a burst of enthusiasm among core Democratic constituencies, who coalesced quickly around her after President Joe Biden withdrew from the campaign last month. She’s drawn big crowds in swing states, touring this week with Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, her choice to be her vice presidential nominee. Trump’s only rally this week, meanwhile, will be in a state he won by 16 percentage points four years ago rather than a November battleground. Facing new pressure in the race from a candidate with surging enthusiasm, Trump on Thursday called questions about his lack of swing state stops “stupid.” “I don’t have to go there because I’m leading those states,” he said. “I’m going because I want to help senators and congressmen get elected.” He will add on fundraising stops in Wyoming and Colorado. Trump could be decisive in Montana’s Senate race Friday’s rally at Montana State University, which is scheduled to start at 8 p.m. Mountain time, is expected to draw thousands of GOP supporters. Yet the former president’s bigger impact could be simply having his name above Sheehy’s on the ballot in November, said University of Montana political analyst Rob Saldin. “There is a segment of the electorate that will turn out when Trump is on the ticket,” Saldin said. And that could benefit Sheehy, a Trump supporter and newcomer to politics who made a fortune off an aerial firefighting business. Republicans have been on a roll in Montana for more than a decade and now hold every statewide office except for Tester’s. Tester won each of his previous Senate contests by a narrow margin, casting himself as a plainspoken farmer who builds personal connections with people in Montana and is willing to break with his party on issues that matter to them. He’s also become a prolific fundraiser. The race has drawn national attention with Democrats clinging to a razor-thin majority in the Senate and defending far more seats than the GOP this year. Tester is considered among the most vulnerable Democratic incumbents. For him to win, large numbers of Trump supporters would have to vote a split ticket and get behind the Democratic senator. Trump’s drive to oust Tester traces back to the lawmaker’s work in 2018 as chairman of the Senate Committee on Veterans’ Affairs. Tester revealed past misconduct by Trump’s personal physician, Ronny Jackson, that sank Jackson’s nomination to lead the Veterans Affairs Department Then-President Trump took the matter personally and came to Montana four times to campaign for Republican Matt Rosendale, who was then the state auditor. Rosendale lost by 3 percentage points. Tester has positioned himself apart from national Democrats Before Trump’s latest visit, Tester has sought to insulate himself against charges that he’s part of the Democratic establishment by rolling out the names of Republicans who support him, including former Montana Gov. Marc Racicot. His campaign highlighted more than 20 pieces of legislation, many dealing with veterans’ issues, that Tester sponsored and Trump signed. Tester also was the sole Democratic delegate from Montana to withhold a vote backing Harris as the party’s presidential candidate in the wake of Biden’s withdrawal. And when the Democratic National Convention takes place later this month in Chicago, Tester will be back in Montana “farming and meeting face to face with Montanans,” campaign spokesperson Harry Child said. The last time Tester attended the Democratic National Convention was in 2008. That’s also the last time a Democratic presidential candidate came anywhere near winning Montana, with President Barack Obama losing by just over 2 percentage points. A similar situation is developing in Ohio, where three-term Democratic Sen. Sherrod Brown faces a tough race in a state expected to vote for Trump. Harris visited Ohio when the two were Senate colleagues to raise money for Brown’s 2018 campaign, but Brown has said he has no plans to campaign with her this year. Like Tester, Brown has highlighted legislation he worked on that Trump signed into law. Friday’s rally takes place in Gallatin County, which Tester has become increasingly reliant on over the course of his political career. He lost the county in his first Senate race, in 2006, but his support has since grown. A substantial margin of victory in Gallatin in 2018 helped push him ahead of Rosendale. Republican Don Seifert, a former Gallatin County commissioner, said he voted for Tester that year and plans to do so again this year. Seifert backed Trump in 2016 and said he has continued to support other Republicans, including Montana Gov. Greg Gianforte and Sen. Steve Daines. “Montanans tend to vote for the person over the party,” Seifert said. “For the state of Montana, Jon is the one that can do what we need.” But Sheehy says Tester has lost touch with his home state and fallen into step with Democrats in Washington. The Republican said in a message this week to supporters that Tester was “responsible for the rise of Kamala Harris” because he served as chairman of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee from 2015 to 2017, when she was elected to the Senate from California. Tester has outraised Sheehy by more than three-to-one in campaign donations reported to the Federal Election Commission. However, outside groups supporting Sheehy have helped the Republican make up much of that gap. Spending in the race is on track to exceed $200 million as advertisements from the two sides saturate Montana’s airwaves.

During a meandering press conference Thursday riddled with false and misleading statements, Trump recalled riding as a passenger in the chopper with former San Francisco Mayor Willie Brown when it was forced to make an emergency landing. The comments were in response to a question about a relationship between Brown and Vice President Kamala Harris three decades ago.

Instead, it was former California Gov. Jerry Brown who rode with Trump in a helicopter in 2018 to survey wildfire damage, and no emergency landing was reported. \"I know Willie Brown very well,\" Mr. Trump said about the alleged incident. \"In fact, I went down in a helicopter with him. We thought maybe this was the end.\" He went on: \"We were in a helicopter, going to a certain location together, and there was an emergency landing. This was not a pleasant landing.\" Trump said Brown also told him \"terrible things\" about Harris. \"He was not a fan of hers very much, at that point.\" But Brown told the San Francisco Chronicle that he's never been in a helicopter with Trump. \"You would have known if I had gone down on a helicopter with Trump,\" Brown told the paper. The longtime Democratic politician said he has never disparaged Harris to Trump, either. MORE: Trump says he has agreed to offer from ABC News to debate Harris \"Hell, no,\" Brown said. \"I wouldn't say anything bad about any woman to him.\" Former California Gov. Jerry Brown, a Democrat, and Trump did ride in a helicopter to survey wildfire damage in 2018. But no problems with the flight were reported. Current Gov. Gavin Newsom was also on the aircraft. A spokesperson for the Democrat, Izzy Gardon, said Friday there was no problem with the flight, no emergency landing, and no conversation about Harris. The two Browns each have public-sector careers spanning decades in California. Willie Brown, 90, is Black. Jerry Brown, 86, is white. Willie Brown's long-ago relationship with Harris has resurfaced since she became the Democratic nominee for the White House. Now that Trump faces her in his bid for a second term, he and other Republicans have used the relationship to lob attacks suggesting Harris didn't earn her political positions legitimately. Brown was serving as speaker of the California State Assembly in the 1990s when he and Harris were in a relationship. Brown had separated from his wife in 1982. Harris, 59, spent years as a prosecutor in the Bay Area before her elevation as the state's attorney general in 2010 and then election as U.S. senator in 2016. She has been married to Doug Emhoff since 2014. Trump campaign spokesperson Karoline Leavitt declined to explain the discrepancies in Trump's story when asked about it Friday on Newsmax. \"I would just refer you to President Trump's statement and what he said yesterday,\" Leavitt said. \"The president has a lot of amazing stories from his life.\"","summary":"Former President Donald Trump mixed up former San Francisco Mayor Willie Brown and former California Governor Jerry Brown when he told a harrowing tale of almost crashing in a helicopter... which didn't happen.","url":"https://abc7news.com/post/donald-trump-willie-brown-jerrry-helicopter-emergency-landing-didnt-happen/15166137/","image":"https://cdn.abcotvs.com/dip/images/15166197_080924-kgo-trump-willie-jerry-img.png?w=1600","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-08-09 22:16:57","author":"David Klepper Associated Press","authors":["David Klepper Associated Press"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.33},{"id":253788894,"title":"Trump Says His Campaign Attracts More People Than Harris' and Claims His Crowd is as Big as MLK Jr.’s","text":"Donald Trump, never one to shy away from controversy, recently shot down concerns about Vice President Kamala Harris’ growing crowd sizes during her campaign stops. During a feisty press conference at his Mar-a-Lago resort, Trump expressed agitation at the media’s portrayal of Harris as a rising star and boasted about the turnout at his own rallies instead, claiming they are 30 times larger. When a reporter asked Trump if he was worried about the attendance at Harris’ events, Trump remarked, “Oh, give me a break.” As per the Daily Mail, the press conference comes at a time when the Trump campaign has been increasingly critical of Harris, especially her lack of media engagement since announcing her candidacy. Glibly, Trump said, “What a stupid question. This [is] because I am leading by a lot…I’m doing tremendous amounts of taping here. We have commercials that are at a level I don't think that anybody has ever done before…I see many of you in the room where I’m speaking to you on the phone. I’m speaking on the radio. I’m speaking on television. Television is coming here. Excuse me, what are we doing right now? She is not doing any news conferences...She’s not smart enough to do a news conference.” Trump accusing the media of unfairly propping up Harris by exaggerating her crowd sizes, exclaimed, “Listen, I had 107,000 people in New Jersey, you didn't report it. I'm so glad you asked, what does she have in your city? 2,000 people? If I ever had 2000 people, you'd say my campaign is finished…It's dishonest – the press…And here's a great example. I had in Michigan recently, 25,000 people, and 25,000 people we just couldn't get them in. We had in Harrisburg, 20–25,000 people, and 20,000 people couldn't get in. We had so many – nobody ever mentions that. And when she gets 1,500 people – and I saw it yesterday on ABC, they say, 'Oh the crowd was so big' – I have 10 times, 20 times, 30 times the crowd size…And they never say the crowd was big. That's why I'm always saying, turn around the cameras.” As per NBC News, perhaps the most delusional moment of Trump’s press conference was the comparison of his crowd sizes to those of Civil Rights icon Martin Luther King Jr. Rambling, Trump claimed, “The biggest crowd I've ever spoken to was that day, and I'll tell you, it's very hard to tell. It's the biggest crowd I've ever spoken to and I've spoken to the biggest crowds.\" He continued, \"Nobody spoke to crowds bigger than to me. When we look at Martin Luther King, when he did his speech, his great speech, and you look at ours, the same everything, the same number of people, if not we had more. And they said he had a million people, but I had 25,000 people. My crowd, we actually had more people...They said I had 25,000 and he had a million people, and I'm okay with it because I liked Dr. Martin Luther King.”","summary":"Trump said, “I’m doing tremendous amounts of taping here.
