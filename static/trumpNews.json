And I’ve got nothing to do with that,” Al-Husainy added.\n\n“But there is a biblical meaning of Hezbollah. It is in Judaism and Christianity and Islam meaning people of God and that means yes,” he explained – dodging Hannity’s repeated attempts to pin him down on answering whether the group was a terrorist organization. \n\nThe US State Department designated Hezbollah as a foreign terrorist organization in October 1997.\n\nAl-Husainy, who is Iraqi American, voiced his support for Trump, 78, last October during a Republican media call, according to the Detroit Free Press. \n\n“I am supporting Donald Trump because he opposes gay marriage and he is the most Christian person in the election,” Al-Husainy said of his support for the 45th president. “He will return us to conservative values, and I am a Muslim and I will stand with whoever opposes gay marriage.” \n\nTrump has not called for a federal ban on gay marriage. \n\nThe Post attempted to reach out to Al-Husainy for comment. \n\nThe Trump transition team did not immediately respond to The Post’s request for comment.","summary":"The Middle East Forum, a conservative nonprofit focused on Islamic issues, has described Al-Husainy as “a radical anti-Semitic, pro-Hezbollah Shia imam” with “a significant history of extremism.” ","url":"https://nypost.com/2025/01/13/us-news/imam-who-refused-to-call-hezbollah-a-terrorist-organization-scheduled-to-deliver-a-benediction-at-trumps-inauguration/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/01/96650909.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/MRGKCzdZ-RyIcpnTz.mp4","publish_date":"2025-01-14 01:00:33","author":"Victor Nava","authors":["Victor Nava"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.255},{"id":280241852,"title":"Acting US ambassador expresses optimism in S.

The island’s pro-independence leader said he was “ready to talk,” after Trump refused to rule out military takeover.\n\nThe bill, circulated on Monday by Representative Andy Ogles and backed by ten co-sponsors, would allow Trump to begin talks with Denmark immediately upon his inauguration.\n\n“Congress hereby authorizes the President, beginning at 12:01 p.m. Eastern Standard Time on January 20, 2025, to seek to enter into negotiations with the Kingdom of Denmark for the purchase of Greenland,” the bill states.\n\nThe proposal follows Trump’s renewed interest in making Greenland part of the US, calling it an “absolute necessity” for national security and refusing to rule out the use of military or economic pressure to achieve this goal. “People really don’t even know if Denmark has any legal right to [Greenland], but if they do, they should give it up because we need it,” Trump said last week.\n\nGreenland’s Prime Minister Mute Egede reiterated the island’s ambition to gain independence from Denmark last week, emphasizing that the Greenlandic people do not want to be either Danish or American. At the same time, Egede expressed readiness to “talk” with Trump, acknowledging that his refusal to rule out the use of force to acquire Greenland was “serious.”\n\nGreenland is the world’s largest island, located between the Atlantic and Arctic oceans. From the early 19th century to the 1950s, it was a territory under full control of Denmark. During WWII, it was occupied by the US after Denmark proper was captured by Nazi Germany. Currently, the island hosts a US military base and the infrastructure for an early warning system for ballistic missiles.\n\nThe island has grown increasingly autonomous and was granted home rule in 1979, ultimately gaining the right in 2009 to declare independence if a referendum passes. “The desire for independence, the wish to be in one’s own house, is probably understood by all people in the world,” Egede stressed, adding that an independence vote “will come soon.”\n\nGreenland is home to fewer than 57,000 people and is 80% covered with ice, but it is rich in gold, silver, copper, and uranium deposits and is believed to have vast oil reserves in its territorial waters.\n\nAccording to a recent survey by US research firm Patriot Polling, approximately 57% of Greenland’s population supports Trump’s proposal. The poll involved 416 respondents and was conducted earlier this month while Donald Trump Jr., the president-elect’s son, was visiting the island on a “personal day trip.”","summary":"President-elect Donald Trump’s Republican allies have introduced draft legislation aiming to authorize negotiations with Denmark \nRead Full Article at RT.com","url":"https://www.rt.com/news/610834-make-greenland-great-again/","image":"https://mf.b37mrtl.ru/files/2025.01/article/6785b2b1203027373b70819b.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-01-14 00:44:23","author":null,"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"ru","sentiment":-0.011},{"id":280241206,"title":"Special counsel in Hunter Biden case denounces president for criticism of the probe","text":"The Department of Justice on Monday released special counsel David Weiss' final report after his investigation of criminal allegations against President Biden's son Hunter Biden.\n\nBiden last month signed a full and unconditional pardon for his son, after earlier promising not to do so, after saying \"raw politics has infected this process and it led to a miscarriage of justice.\"\n\nWeiss in the report called such accusations \"gratuitous and wrong.\"\n\n\"Other presidents have pardoned family members, but in doing so, none have taken the occasion as an opportunity to malign the public servants at the Department of Justice based solely on false accusations,\" he wrote.\n\nHunter Biden was convicted in June of federal gun charges for lying about his addiction to crack cocaine when he purchased a gun.

The remaining seven forecast no change.\n\nA November poll following a surprise reduction of the base rate to 3.00 per cent saw a majority of economists predict the bank would next cut rates in February.\n\n\"Against a backdrop of heightened political uncertainty and intensifying growth concerns, we think the Bank of Korea will deliver its third straight 25 bp cut at its upcoming meeting. The case to move sooner rather than later has strengthened,\" said Krystal Tan, economist at ANZ. \n\n\"The main hurdle for successive rate cuts is recent KRW weakness and concerns about financial stability... Prolonged political instability and/or direct U.S. tariffs on South Korea exports would call for more accommodative monetary policy.\"\n\nMedian forecasts showed one cut from the BOK this quarter and the same move in both the second and third quarters taking the rate to 2.25 per cent - considered the neutral rate.

The company had a year-earlier profit of Rs 4,350 crore. Sequentially, net profit rose 8.4% from Rs 4,235 crore in the September quarter.Consolidated revenue in the three months ended December grew 5.1% year-on-year (YoY) and 3.6% quarter-on-quarter (QoQ) to Rs 29,890 crore backed by services revenue growth. HCLTech’s software revenue growth however declined 2.1% YoY in constant currency terms as it failed to close some deal renewals as well as new deals.Noida-headquartered HCLTech meanwhile raised the lower end of its FY25 revenue growth guidance to 4.5-5.0% in constant currency (CC) terms from 3.5-5% earlier. “Looking ahead, in 2025, we believe clients are looking at increasing their IT investments,” said C Vijayakumar, chief executive and managing director at HCLTech. “We do see an improvement in the demand environment, with discretionary spending witnessing some uptick. They're investing to drive innovation and efficiency, and in these initiatives, GenAI and data are at the centre.”117213980He added that while HCLTech remains “confident on the pace of medium-term recovery, bear in mind the Q4 outlook accounts for certain planned contractual reductions.”Last week, IT bellwether Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) posted a 5.5% YoY and 3.9% sequential increase in net profit at Rs 12,380 crore on a revenue of Rs 63,973 crore, which grew 5.59% YoY but declined by 0.44% on a QoQ basis. TCS also cut its headcount by 5,370 employees in the December quarter.For HCLTech, after cutting its workforce by 780 people in the September quarter, the company added 2,134 employees in the October-December period ending calendar 2024 with a total headcount of 220,755. It also added 2,014 freshers in the same period, lower from September quarter’s 2,932 freshers. Fresher hiring and deal wins Billionaire Shiv Nadar-promoted HCLTech also trimmed fresher hiring plans for FY25 from 10,000 at the start of the year to about 7,000, of which 6,000 have already been hired in the first nine months of the fiscal.“Lower attrition, improved productivity results in moderating the fresher numbers for the year…As far as the fresher planning for next year is concerned, we expect to significantly increase the numbers next year,” said Ramachandran Sundararajan, chief people officer. He did not elaborate further.The company said it does not have much insight into the incoming Donald Trump government’s decisions that can impact the spending environment and client priorities. Vijayakumar, however, added he does not expect any impact on immigration to the US given its lesser reliance on H1-B visas which ranges at 500-1000 per year for HCLTech.HCLTech scored 12 deal wins in the third quarter with total contract value (TCV) at $2.10 billion, a marginal drop from Q2’s $2.22 billion but higher than $1.93 billion a year earlier. Annual contract value (ACV) improved 9% QoQ and 23% YoY reflecting higher increase despite smaller deals.Most of the new deals were signed in the key markets of Americas and Europe where the deal pipeline is at a near all-time high, the management highlighted.Operating margin edged down to 19.5% in the December quarter from 19.8% a year ago. Sequentially, margin improved from 18.6% in the September quarter supported by a stronger dollar against the rupee.Analysts expect HCLTech to continue deepening focus on small and mid-sized enterprise clients for sustained revenue growth led by North America and Europe. “Although demand in late 2024 was mixed due to cost-saving priorities, longer sales cycles, and reduced discretionary spending, the 2025 outlook is brighter with key growth drivers—a 10-12% increase in IT spending in India, global IT growth of 6-8%, and GenAI projects moving to production, creating new revenue opportunities,” said Biswajit Maity, senior principal analyst, Gartner. The company announced a total dividend of Rs 18 for the quarter including a special dividend of Rs 6 to celebrate 25 years of public listing. This will lead to Rs 60 dividend for shareholders for the entire year with a record date set as January 17.Shares of HCLTech closed 0.52% lower at Rs 1,985.25 apiece on the BSE, compared to a 1.36% decline in the benchmark Sensex.

It is difficult to scale up capacity without the high-tech machinery, which is not available readily in India.The government has been made aware of the situation by industry and mitigating measures are being considered. But for the near term, this would mean a setback to the large manufacturing operations that have been set up by companies such as Foxconn in the electronics sector and joint ventures in the auto sector, the executives said.“The Chinese government is stopping capital equipment exports from China which are critical to the manufacturing of various products, especially electronics, EVs and solar panels, etc.,” said an executive on the condition of anonymity. “The solar sector has been suffering for quite a while.” 117214239Protectionist MoveThe delay in bringing equipment not only increases costs for the manufacturers here, but also hurts the whole expansion exercise, said another executive. Experts believe that while China is trying to protect its interests amid the geo-political situation and the return of the Donald Trump regime in the US, India is being severely hurt as its booming manufacturing ecosystem depends on Chinese machinery and technical know-how.Over the last few months, the Chinese government has turned its attention to the electronics sector, specifically, stopping large companies such as Foxconn, BYD and Lenovo from exporting capital equipment for setting up or augmenting manufacturing facilities outside China, a third executive said. Foxconn, BYD and Lenovo did not respond to emails seeking comment.China is in a difficult position because as the world gets ready to watch Trump’s tariff regime against Chinese exports, Chinese and Taiwanese companies such as Foxconn, Pegatron and Compal want to partially de-risk from China and set up manufacturing facilities overseas. “This move will stop their expansion plans also within China, in addition to outside China. So, the Chinese government may get considerable opposition from within as well,” said the first executive.New Strategy NeededBut this latest move by the Chinese government is going to hit Indian interests more as other countries like Vietnam and Mexico have developed a substantial local ecosystem by partnering Chinese players in the last 4-7 years. In India, the ecosystem remains under-developed, say industry players. The government is trying to gear up to support the shift of the ecosystem through a component incentive scheme worth nearly $3 billion. It is likely that the government could also consider special provisions and subsidies under the incentive scheme for capital equipment, say industry executives. “Essentially, the government will have to rethink its strategy for supporting domestic manufacturing which is dependent on the Chinese ecosystem, not just for components and sub-assemblies but to a large extent, for capital equipment,” said the first executive.","summary":"India's electronics, solar, and EV sectors are struggling to obtain essential high-tech machinery due to China's recent halt in exports. This move aims to impede manufacturing growth in India for firms like Foxconn and BYD, causing potential setbacks and increased costs.

Day 1,056.\n\nDonetsk region. Russian shelling killed one resident and wounded seven others in Ukraine’s eastern Donetsk oblast, or region, on Jan. 11.\n\nKherson region. A 56-year-old woman died at the hospital on Jan. 11, succumbing to injuries sustained in last week's Russian drone strike on a bus station in the southern city of Kherson.\n\nKharkiv region. In northeastern Ukraine, Russian shelling killed a civilian in Kupiansk, a key logistics hub that was liberated from Russian occupation during Ukraine’s 2022 counteroffensive. Russian forces are slowly advancing on the city, located in the eastern part of the region, and are now less than two miles away.\n\nU.S. President-elect Donald Trump announced that a meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin was being arranged, but no timeline was given, Reuters reported on Jan. 10. While Trump's return to office raises both concerns and hopes for a diplomatic settlement to the war, fears in Kyiv are growing that a quick resolution of the conflict could come at a high cost: Trump's advisers have proposed compromises with Russia, potentially ceding Ukrainian territory. Despite the Biden administration's $175 billion in aid to Ukraine throughout nearly three years of the war, Trump's stance on future assistance remains unclear.\n\nUkraine has received the first $3 billion tranche of a G7-backed $50 billion loan, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen announced on Jan. 10. Funded by revenue from frozen Russian assets, the loan aims to bolster Ukraine's economic stability as it defends its sovereignty. The EU’s total contribution to the G7 loan will reach approximately $20 billion.\n\nMORE FOR YOU\n\nApple Brings Back iPhone 15 Pro For First Time—At Lower Price\n\nApple iPhone USB-C Hacked—What Users Need To Know\n\nSamsung Confirms Galaxy S25 Ultra Offers, Pre-Orders And Release Dates\n\nThe U.S. unveiled some of its toughest sanctions against Russia's energy sector on Jan. 10, in an effort to further erode a cornerstone of the Kremlin's economy powering its war machine. The Biden administration has imposed its most severe sanctions to date, targeting Russia's top energy companies, Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) projects, and over 180 vessels tied to oil exports. Key energy companies Gazprom Neft and Surgutneftegas, which collectively account for nearly 20% of Moscow's crude oil exports (up to 30 million barrels per month), are now blacklisted along with their subsidiaries.\n\nU.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen emphasized that the sanctions will increase risks to shipping and financial services supporting Russia's oil trade, further isolating its energy sector. Analysts predict increased discounts on Moscow's crude oil as transaction costs rise and tanker shortages likely intensify. While short-term disruptions to the global supply are expected, expanded capacity from new LNG projects in the U.S. is set to stabilize the market and reduce dependence on Russian energy. White House advisor John Kirby estimates the sanctions could cost Russia billions in monthly revenue, delivering a sharp economic blow to an already strained economy. The United Kingdom added additional energy sanctions in tandem with the U.S.\n\nThe sanctions expand the scope of existing measures, now penalizing any global entity for engaging with the Kremlin's oil and gas sector, isolating key players, and disrupting supply chains. All dealings with these entities must be cease by Feb. 27, further straining Russia's energy export infrastructure. However, the sanctions package stipulates a grace period until March 12 to wind down unfinished energy-related transactions.\n\nTwo North Korean soldiers captured by Ukrainian forces in Russia's Kursk region on Jan. 9 said during questioning that they believed they were being sent abroad for training, rather than to fight in the war. The soldiers were part of a contingent of as many as 12 thousand North Korean troops sent to fight in Russia’s war against Ukraine, under a Russian-North Korean military collaboration that has raised concerns among Ukraine’s western allies. President Volodymyr Zelenskyy highlighted the strategic significance of the capture as hard evidence of the Kremlin's reliance on North Korea to bolster its depleted military.\n\nAccording to South Korean intelligence, at least 300 North Korean soldiers have died and 2,700 have been wounded during this mobilization. The high casualties are being attributed to the troops being unfamiliar with modern warfare, as well as under orders to commit suicide in order to avoid capture.\n\nBritish intelligence reported a decrease in Russian drone attacks on Ukraine, with about 1,700 strikes in December 2024, down from 2,300 in November—marking the first decline since last spring. Ukrainian forces intercepted 53% of the drones, while others were neutralized by electronic warfare or deviated off course. Despite the reduction, Russia is likely to maintain at least 1,500 drone launches per month. On Jan. 13, Moscow launched 110 drones, 78 of which were shot down by air defense.\n\nMike Waltz, incoming national security advisor to Donald Trump, has called on Ukraine to lower its conscription age from 26 to 18 to stabilize the frontline in a Jan. 12 interview with ABC News. The Republican Florida congressman noted that expanding the draft to include those aged 18-25 could bring in hundreds of thousands of new recruits. Waltz said that Ukraine, asking the world to take risks for democracy, must make bold moves, including revising its mobilization policies, to strengthen its defense and secure a potential resolution to the war.\n\nBy Danylo Nosov, Karina L.

Democratic presidential candidates who’d backed the resolution — John Kerry, Hillary Clinton and Joe Biden — would later tie themselves in knots trying to rationalize votes that were almost certainly motivated by political expediency, and which put their imprimatur on a catastrophe.\n\nAnother shameful episode was the 1996 Defense of Marriage Act, which barred the federal government from recognizing same-sex marriages. It passed at a time when Democrats were on the defensive; Bill Clinton’s attempt to let gay people serve openly in the military had fallen apart, Newt Gingrich’s Republicans took the House in the 1994 midterms, and the Republican Bob Dole seemed poised to make gay marriage an issue in the coming election. In a weirdly apologetic signing statement, Clinton wrote that the law should not be “understood to provide an excuse for discrimination, violence or intimidation against any person on the basis of sexual orientation.” But as Clinton would later acknowledge when calling for its repeal, it did something worse, writing discrimination into law.\n\nA bill called the Laken Riley Act, which overwhelmingly passed the House and could soon pass the Senate, is destined to be another entry in this archive of legislative shame. Given that anger over mass migration contributed to Democrats’ defeat in November, it’s perfectly understandable that some Democrats would tack right on border issues. The Laken Riley Act, however, is the wrong vehicle for proving their moderation. This sweeping bill will upend our immigration system in ways that will outlast Donald Trump’s presidency, ruining lives and handcuffing future Democratic administrations. Democrats who vote for it may dodge right-wing attacks in the next election, but once its true scope becomes clear, they’ll be answering for it for years to come.","summary":"This cruel and sweeping bill could upend our immigration system.","url":"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/13/opinion/democrats-laken-riley-act.html","image":"https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/01/13/multimedia/13goldberg-cjqf/13goldberg-cjqf-facebookJumbo.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-01-14 00:23:18","author":"Michelle Goldberg","authors":["Michelle Goldberg"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.316},{"id":280240164,"title":"Hyundai, Stellantis, Delta each donating $1 million to Trump inaugural fund","text":"WASHINGTON : Hyundai Motor's U.S. unit, Chrysler-parent Stellantis and Delta Air Lines on Monday each announced they are among companies donating $1 million to President-elect Donald Trump's inaugural fund.\n\nOther major companies donating for the Jan. 20 inauguration include Boeing, General Motors, Ford Motor , Microsoft, Amazon.com, Alphabet and Facebook-parent Meta . \n\nHyundai said it \"welcomes the opportunity to work with the new administration on policies that support American manufacturing, protect supply chains, and spur innovation.\"\n\nPotential tariffs and changes to electric vehicle and vehicle emission policies under consideration by the incoming administration could have dramatic impacts on automakers.","summary":"","url":"https://www.channelnewsasia.com/business/hyundai-stellantis-delta-each-donating-1-million-trump-inaugural-fund-4856281","image":"https://dam.mediacorp.sg/image/upload/s--sGU65KQQ--/fl_relative,g_south_east,l_mediacorp:cna:watermark:2024-04:reuters_1,w_0.1/f_auto,q_auto/c_fill,g_auto,h_338,w_600/v1/one-cms/core/2025-01-14t002252z_1_lynxmpel0d00g_rtroptp_3_india-auto.jpg?itok=1WT0QDt","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-01-14 00:22:52","author":null,"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"sg","sentiment":-0.674},{"id":280239924,"title":"California governor Gavin Newsom faces recall for 'woefully unprepared' response to devastating LA fires","text":"Hollywood loves a sequel and Gavin Newsom may be seeing one, as a bipartisan group attempts to make the California governor face a recall for the second time. \n\nThe Democrat, 57, has faced calls to resign for the devastating and incompetent response to the LA wildfires, with everyone from Donald Trump to Hollywood stars slamming his and Mayor Karen Bass' lack of leadership.\n\nSaving California, a group that touts itself as a 'non-partisan coalition of working families, professionals and community advocates' have launched another recall against Newsom.\n\nNewsom faced and won his first recall battle - which was launched for his response to the COVID-19 pandemic - for California in September 2021 in a landslide victory.\n\nRandy Economy, a key spokesperson and senior adviser to the first campaign and a former advisor to RFK Jr., founded the effort late last year. \n\nWhile he acknowledges that he was already done with Newsom because of 'increased costs of living, increased crime, increased drug use and homelessness' among other issues, the wildfires has pushed him into further action. \n\nEconomy calls Newsom 'woefully unprepared and incompetent' as the wildfires continue to rage through the city. \n\n'Leadership is solving problems, not passing the buck and the blame, and Californians can no longer afford to have an empty suit occupying the governorship,' he said in a statement.\n\nHe called the recall a 'last hope' to get rid of Newsom before he is term-limited out of office in 2027.\n\nThey plan to serve the governor with papers in the next two weeks. \n\nA spokesperson for Newsom told Newsweek that the governor is '100 percent focused on the fires, ongoing rescue efforts and the recovery process - not politics.'\n\n'Readers still should have the context that the same group of far-right Trump acolytes have launched six different recall attempts against the governor since he's taken office, each of which have failed spectacularly.\n\n'Even Republican Party leaders have criticized these repeated attempts as a brazen campaign finance 'grift,' and the recall organizers have been sued by their own donors for pocketing funds raised previously.' \n\nThis comes as Newsom faces fury after claiming he does not know how the Los Angeles wildfires happened - while appearing to cast blame on other officials, including LA mayor Karen Bass.\n\nWhen asked for comment, a spokesperson for Saving California that a recall for Bass wasn't being ruled out by the group but for now, Newsom is their focus.\n\nMost recently, Newsom was slammed for trying to draw in donations for the victims through his own Super PAC.\n\nThe governor shared a link to californiafirefacts.com - a website created by his campaign committee - claiming it would combat misinformation about the devastating Los Angeles fires.\n\nHe has been steering donations meant for California wildfire victims through his super PAC's fundraising page, which collects donors' personal information for Democratic databases.\n\nBut critics quickly noticed that while the site encourages donations to the California Fire Foundation, it funnels all contributions through ActBlue, the Democratic Party's fundraising platform, via Newsom's Campaign for Democracy super PAC.\n\nDonors who provide phone numbers are also automatically enrolled to receive text messages from Newsom's political organization.\n\nNewsom has been blasted for his attempt to harvest donor data while victims lose homes. \n\nIt sparked immediate backlash with critics pointing out that the California Fire Foundation already accepts direct donations without requiring Democratic Party middlemen. \n\nNewsom has been accused of 'passing the buck' in his latest attempts to defend his response to the devastating 'Palisade Fire' inferno across the state, as the official death toll today rose to 16.\n\nThe man previously touted as a potential Democrat presidential candidate has also been criticized over $100million cuts to funding earmarked for tackling wildfires\n\nThe controversy comes as Los Angeles residents continue to grapple with devastating wildfires that have destroyed homes and forced widespread evacuations across the region.\n\nAs the official death toll from the fires climbs to 24, anxious residents are preparing for another 72 hours of hellish weather conditions expected to propel the fires in new directions.\n\nThe fatality total is expected to climb, with at least 16 people still missing and 150,000 forced to evacuate their homes.\n\nIn all, four fires have consumed more than 62 square miles across the most affluent neighborhoods of LA, with A-list celebrity homes and restaurant hotspots among the 12,300 structures wiped out.\n\nLocal fire departments have warned that harsher winds and more fire would prevent those under mandatory evacuation orders from returning home to assess the damage.\n\n'Life-threatening winds and dangerously low humidity are forecast for much of Southern California, creating a significant risk of rapid fire spread,' the California fire service (CalFire) said in a statement. 'The winds will cause increased fire activity.'\n\nThe Eaton Fire near Pasadena and the Palisades Fire, in a wealthy enclave along the Pacific Coast, alone accounted for 59 square miles (nearly 153 square kilometers). \n\nNearly 70,000 customers were without power across California as of Sunday, more than half of them in Los Angeles County, according to PowerOutrage.com.\n\nExtreme dry weather conditions due to a prolonged drought, dry vegetation and powerful Santa Ana winds that reached up to 80 mph in some areas this week created the 'perfect storm' for the fires. \n\nTwo people have also been arrested for allegedly lighting fires in the county too, including Ruben Montes, 29, who was detained for arson on Sunday in Irwindale, roughly 16 miles away from Altadena, where the deadly Eaton Fire continues to rage.\n\nMexican national Juan Manuel Sierra-Leyva, was also taken into custody after allegedly being caught on video walking with a yellow blowtorch before he was confronted by residents in Calabasas, west of Beverly Hills.","summary":"Hollywood loves a sequel and Gavin Newsom may be facing one, as a bipartisan group attempts to make the California governor face a recall for the second time.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-14280533/gavin-newsom-california-governor-response-la-fires.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/01/14/00/94056903-0-image-m-18_1736814021673.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-01-14 00:22:11","author":"Editor,Stephen M.

But we in this room said, no, we make the investments in ourselves, we protect our workers and technology. That will not happen now,” Biden said at the US State Department.\nHe also claimed China has become “weaker” thanks to the US efforts with allies in countering Beijing in hi-tech, trade, and the Indo-Pacific during the four years of his tenure.\n“It’s clear my administration is leaving the next administration with a very strong hand to play … We’re leaving them an America with more friends and strong reliance, whose adversaries are weaker and under pressure.”\nBiden’s efforts to encourage US allies to jointly address the challenges that China poses economically and militarily, as its companies gain global market share and its naval presence grows emerged as a central part of the president’s foreign policy, has had broad support from Democrats and from some in Trump’s party.\nSome countries have joined Washington in curbing semiconductor exports to China and imposing tariffs on the country’s leading clean-energy products, including electric vehicles, to counter what they called China’s manufacturing overcapacity.\n\nBiden has also worked with Indo-Pacific nations and with the EU in creating a critical mineral security partnerships, aiming to reduce Beijing’s influence in the global technology supply chain, where China accounts for over 60 per cent of the world’s rare earth production and upwards of 90 per cent of refining.\nOn Monday, Biden urged his successor to continue American efforts in tackling challenges brought by China in this area.\n“Some in the incoming administration are sceptical about the need for clean energy,” he said. “China is trying to dominate the clean energy manufacturing, critical material supply chains. They want to capture the market in the future and create new dependencies. The United States must win that contest.”\n“Chinese used to control the supply chains and these materials, but not for long.”\nTrump, who will be sworn in on January 20, is known for his scepticism over climate change and the need for a clean energy transition, calling efforts on this front a “green new scam”.\nHe vowed, for example, to repeal the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), legislation championed by Biden, which earmarked billions of US dollars in subsidies for companies manufacturing clean energy components in America, among other environmental initiatives launched by Biden.\nHowever, Trump may find that gutting the law may run counter to his campaign trail pledges to boost employment and competitiveness against China.\nSamantha Gross, a fellow specialising in climate and energy at the Brookings Institution, a Washington think tank, said job creation would also be an advantage the Trump team would not overlook.\n\n“If you care about American competitiveness in the world, if you care about job creation and keeping manufacturing going here in the United States, you care about this stuff, don’t kick the IRA out,” Gross said in a Brookings panel discussion on Monday.\n“Don’t focus only on tariffs, focus on making the US globally competitive, not just in fossil but in clean [energy] as well.”\nAccording to a report released in September by E2, a business group committed to “an economically sound approach to environmental issues”, clean energy and clean vehicle companies added nearly 150,000 new jobs in the US in 2023, the first full year that the IRA was in effect.\nOn Chinese manufacturing “overcapacity”, Trump has signalled that he will address the issue through tariffs, a tool that he has threatened to wield broadly as part of his “America first” agenda.\nThe incoming president has long accused Beijing of pursuing unfair trade practices that have led to wide surpluses with the US, a charge that his first presidential administration used to start a trade war in 2018.\nBiden kept those tariffs in place throughout his term and some allies have also put up tariff barriers. But it remains to be seen how committed will Trump be in working with US allies to continue countering China, in the Indo-Pacific, which has increasingly become a flashpoint between the two superpowers amid heightening tensions in the Taiwan Strait.\nTrump has long criticised many of Washington’s allies for what he calls a lack of burden sharing in defence partnerships. During his election campaign, the president-elect even asked Taiwan to pay the US for its defence.\nBeijing sees Taiwan as part of China to be reunited by force if necessary. Most countries, including the United States, do not recognise Taiwan as an independent state, but Washington is opposed to any attempt to take the self-governing island by force and is bound by the Taiwan Relations Act to support Taipei’s defence capability.\nIn his speech on Monday, Biden touted his legacy in the Indo-Pacific and called for continued alignment with allies on China.\n“United States should take full advantage of our diplomatic and geopolitical opportunities we’ve created, keep bringing countries together to deal with challenges posed by China,” he said.\n“We listed our allies and partners that join us, building more convergence among our allies on a shared approach to China than ever existed, and showing that it’s more effective to deal with China alongside of partners, rather than going alone.”\nAdditional reporting by Laura Zhou in Washington","summary":"In a departing message delivered a week before leaving office, Biden claimed the US is in a stronger position in a long-term competition with China.","url":"https://www.scmp.com/news/china/diplomacy/article/3294621/farewell-biden-urges-trump-tackle-chinas-overcapacity-clean-energy-dominance","image":"https://cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2025/01/14/075f9de6-4259-4899-9f5a-c054e6de1d60_cf839957.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-01-14 00:19:34","author":"Kawala Xie","authors":["Kawala Xie"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"cn","sentiment":0.277},{"id":280240314,"title":"Democrats aren’t democracy’s party","text":"When Donald Trump is sworn in next week, America will have a president for the first time in four years.\n\nThe Biden era hasn’t been a presidency but an interregnum, with seemingly no one in charge in Washington.\n\nThe sign on Harry Truman’s desk used to say, “The buck stops here.”\n\nWhere did it stop with Joe Biden in the Oval Office?\n\nVoters never asked for an experiment in leaderless administration, but the party that put Biden in power gave them one anyway. \n\nIn the 21st century, Democrats are misnamed: \n\nThey’re the less democratic of the two great parties, and their insider-dominated politics explains both how Biden wound up in a role for which he was unfit and why the candidate picked to replace him went on to lose every battleground state.\n\nKamala Harris had never won a presidential primary.\n\nBut the party’s mandarins first pushed her for vice president, and then they pushed Biden off the ticket and made her the nominee without giving voters the slightest say.\n\nThis isn’t a people’s party:\n\nBill and Hillary Clinton still believed the party belonged to them even after Barack Obama beat Mrs. Clinton for the 2008 presidential nomination. \n\nThe Clintons and Obama’s coterie subsequently agreed to power-sharing, with Hillary Clinton as President Obama’s secretary of state and all-but-officially-designated successor.\n\nBiden was very much a junior partner in the Obama-Clinton party, and that didn’t change after the party made him its nominee in 2020. \n\nObama and Hillary Clinton kept Biden from running four years earlier. Obama wouldn’t support his own vice president because it was Hillary’s turn – that was the deal.\n\nTrump shattered their corrupt dynastic bargain, just as he broke the hold of the Bush family and its allies on the GOP.\n\nTrump put to the test a much-debated question in political science: Does the party decide – meaning party elites – or can voters pick a winning nominee in defiance of what the political establishment wants?\n\nThanks to Trump, the Republicans became a party of primary voters, while the Democrats remained under elite control.\n\nThe results are now in, and they can be seen in both Biden’s sad job performance and Harris’ humiliation at the polls. \n\nTurning into a party of primary voters wasn’t without cost for the GOP, however, and led to the nomination of some weak candidates in the 2022 midterms and other recent contests.\n\nYet the price not only Democrats but the whole country paid for the anti-democratic politics of the Clintons and Obamas has been much steeper.\n\nDemocrats forfeited their future by selecting Biden and Harris five years ago – the one too senescent to serve as president, the other too unlikeable to win a national election herself.\n\nThe Democratic establishment – which includes Nancy Pelosi – has had a stranglehold on the party since the 1990s, as occasional challengers like Bernie Sanders, Tulsi Gabbard and Robert F. Kennedy Jr. discovered in turn.\n\nThat led Gabbard and Kennedy out of the Democratic Party’s confines and into the freer and more freewheeling coalition of Trump’s GOP.\n\nThe Democrats had actually been the first party to commit fully to the modern presidential primary system, but they were burned by the experience.\n\nRichard Nixon won the 1968 election in part thanks to Democratic disarray: Like Biden, the incumbent president that year, Lyndon Johnson, dropped out of the race, and the party’s eventual replacement, Hubert Humphrey, was, like Harris, a vice president handed the presidential nomination without competing in a single primary.\n\nStung by defeat, in 1972, Democrats tried to embrace democracy by giving primaries more weight – but wound up with a candidate, George McGovern, who lost in a 49-state blowout.\n\nJimmy Carter, whose dismal years as president look a little brighter by contrast with the Biden-Harris interregnum, was actually the Democrats’ savior in 1976 and seemed to vindicate the wisdom of primaries.\n\nBut then the party lost three consecutive presidential elections in the 1980s, and after Bill Clinton restored the Democrats’ fortunes in 1992, he and his wife were determined to remain the power brokers.\n\nObama could have been the Democrats’ Donald Trump, the man who gave the party back to the people.\n\nInstead he gave it back to Hillary Clinton, and after Trump trounced her, Democrats had no leaders left – just a nonfunctional Biden and an unelectable Harris.\n\nNow that the insiders’ political machine has self-destructed, will Democrats dare trust their voters to choose a new generation of leadership – or do they fear that will only land them with the next George McGovern?\n\nPopulism can lead to better leaders, but only if a party’s primary voters aren’t already too far from America’s middle ground.","summary":"'The Biden era hasn't been a presidency but an interregnum, with seemingly no one in charge'","url":"https://www.wnd.com/2025/01/democrats-arent-democracys-party/","image":"https://www.wnd.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/barack-obama-cooper-cnn.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-01-14 00:15:16","author":"Daniel McCarthy","authors":["Daniel McCarthy"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.483},{"id":280240320,"title":"Is the H-1B visa controversy really dividing MAGA?","text":"Conservatives in the Republican Party have been racked by disagreement the past few weeks over H-1B visas, the program that brings in foreigners for primarily lower-skill tech positions. Donald Trump, Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy have come out in favor of the program, while prominent Republicans like Steve Bannon, Stephen Miller and Laura Loomer vociferously disagree, concerned it takes away jobs from Americans.\n\nThe Democrats generally come down in favor of the program, although there have been some prominent exceptions like Sen. Bernie Sanders. Trump spoke critically about the program in 2016 but has since softened his position. Ramaswamy has likewise stated that the program needs major reform, causing many to suspect the MSM is overly hyping up the divide on the right.\n\nThe 1990 Immigration Act launched the program, allowing employers to bring in temporary foreign workers with at least a bachelor’s degree or the equivalent. The workers are granted a three-year stay, which can be extended to six years. If they have an approved petition for a green card, it can be extended further. Each year, up to a cap of 65,000 new H-1B visas are allowed, and another 20,000 for foreigners who have a master’s degree from a U.S. university, but there are five times as many exceptions granted in addition to those, totaling three quarters of a million.\n\nWhile tech is the largest sector that uses the program, falling into professional, scientific and technical services, the visas are also used in smaller amounts for educational services, manufacturing, health care and social assistance. Amazon was the largest employer to use the program in 2024, with 3,871 approvals.\n\nTech companies claim the field is growing so fast that hiring only American workers cannot keep up with the demand. But the Economic Policy Institute (EPI) retorts that companies are shrinking their numbers of American workers at the same time.\n\nMusk, a naturalized citizen originally from South Africa who once held an H-1B visa himself, also admitted the program needs major reform, and said there should be minimum salaries set so companies aren’t incentivized to prefer lower-paid foreign workers over Americans.\n\nA poll from Rasmussen Reports published in November found that 60% of Americans do not want more H-1B visa workers. Among Republicans, that number increases to 72%. Whereas only 47% of Democrats object to more H-1B visas.\n\nMany believe it isn’t a clear right versus left issue. Due to that grayness, who do you trust putting out statistics? The MSM has been hyping up the differences on the right, when perhaps they’re not as polarized as the fake news portrays them. Trump, Ramaswamy and Musk all admit the program needs reform.\n\nI know someone who graduated with a computer science degree from Arizona State University and has been unable to get a job in his field for well over a year. Based on talking to friends in higher ed, I believe much of it is due to being passed over for DEI hires, which aren’t necessarily the same thing as H-1B visa workers.\n\nRamaswamy posted on X last month that American companies often prefer to hire foreign workers because Americans have become so mediocre due to our culture that fails to prioritize ambition and achievement. More than 70% of H-1B visas go to Indian software engineers.\n\nNow that corporations are starting to eliminate their DEI programs, maybe affirmative action and quotas will begin receding. Laws were passed around the country over the past 25 years banning them, but corporations and governments found ways around them. It will be helpful to conduct studies of the demographics of these corporations’ workforces before and after DEI is really eliminated – if they cooperate and provide full and transparent statistics.\n\nIt is not easy to figure out the extent of the H-1B visa program displacing American workers, since there are special interests reporting on the stats. The left-leaning EPI, which the MSM is fond of citing, says in the first sentence on its About Us page that EPI’s vision includes a scenario where “every worker can join a union,” and below that emphasizes its DEI policy: “Our research exposes the forces that seek to exclude and diminish the power of people of color and women – particularly Black, Brown, and indigenous people – to the benefit of white supremacy and wealthy elites.” EPI appears to lump Asians and Indians in with whites, essentially asserting that they are as guilty as whites of taking jobs from other minorities.\n\nSimilarly, the American Immigration Council is frequently cited as an authority by the MSM in this area but sounds like a shill for open borders.\n\nIf the H-1B program is scaled back, employers may get around it by turning to hiring overseas labor instead. A 2024 survey found that 83% of employers hired one or more employees outside of the country for roles initially intended to be based in the United States.\n\nThe Biden administration announced changes to the program in December, which go into effect on Jan. 17. Most of the changes appear pretty minor, involving streamlining the program, including in certain types of hiring that do not have caps.\n\nThere needs to be investigations into the alleged displacement of American workers, which should ideally be conducted by Musk and Ramaswamy due to their expertise, interest, influence and likelihood of obtaining access to this data from tech corporations. They should also study data about unemployed American tech workers. It must be determined whether foreigners are being hired at lower wages through the program, since the data coming out on this is contradictory depending on which group is putting it out. Additionally, the pair needs to figure out that if displacement is occurring, how much of it is due to DEI, not the H-1B visa program.\n\nFears must be put to rest to stop the MSM hyped-up division in MAGA. Since Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy are already demanding reforms, there is a very good chance they will conduct these additional investigations.","summary":"'The data coming out on this is contradictory depending on which group is putting it out'","url":"https://www.wnd.com/2025/01/is-the-h-1b-visa-controversy-really-dividing-maga/","image":"https://www.wnd.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/vivek-ramaswamy-video-screenshot.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-01-14 00:13:23","author":"Rachel Alexander","authors":["Rachel Alexander"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.078},{"id":280240122,"title":"Our border is an 'unmitigated disaster,' says Rep.

That new car might come from George Soros’ wallet, but not from Bill and Hill.\n\nJoe Biden was just walking in the steps of the Nobel Prize guys when he diminished the honor of the Medal of Freedom. Do you remember when Barack Obama was awarded the Peace Prize by the nitwits in Norway after only seven months of being president? That’s because you probably had forgotten when the U.S., Russia, China, North Korea and whoever else had nuclear weapons got together one day and dumped all their nukes into the ocean. That was Obama’s Day of Peace … that never happened. And that was also the day when Donald Trump hugged Whoopi Goldberg after a lovely lunch together. More fictional peace from the Little O.\n\nJoe Biden still has time to award more freedom medals before he leaves office with his pockets full, along with the silverware and drapes. Look around, Joe, there are some more tempting recipients awaiting medals according to your standards of “freedom.”\n\nHow about the former emperor of Rome, Nero. He got rid of those pesky Christians by turning them into live human torches. Nero was obviously a believer in environmental purity. So, to save on electricity, he read by the light of human torches. Obviously, the human torches added to their carbon footprints – but Nero didn’t know about global warming back then, so give the guy a break.\n\nThough the emperor is long gone, Joe Biden could easily send a Medal of Freedom to Nero’s relatives who now operate one of Rome’s finest pizza palaces. Joe could claim that Nero was an early environmental crusader saving on the usage of fossil fuels to create light.\n\nAccording to Biden’s standards of freedom, the former leader of China, Mao Zedong, could qualify for a Medal of Freedom. Since freedom is a rather nebulous term, Mao qualifies by freeing a lot of Chinese people from the burdens of poverty, illness and life. He was also a great environmentalist, having reduced the population of the world by about 45 million people in just a few years with the Great Leap Forward. For 45 million Chinese, the great leap ended up in the grave, but hey, the woke are determined to save the earth from the destruction brought on by human beings, and Mao helped lessen that human burden. Take a bow, Mao.\n\nTwo more suggestions for medals are Alejandro Mayorkas and Adam Schiff. Mr. Mayorkas constantly displayed freedom from the truth every time he declared that the southern border was secure. Adam Schiff qualifies for his freedom medal by being free from the truth every time he said Donald Trump colluded with the Russians to beat the honorable Hillary Clinton.\n\nAnd now thousands of homes in Los Angeles have burned because of the wise leadership of Gov. Gavin Newsom. My staff nominates him for displaying freedom from common sense. In order to save the smelt fish from losing some of its watery habitat in Northern California, Newsom has refused the transfer of excess water from there to Southern California.\n\nAlong with Newsom, we also nominate the geniuses who in 2022 freed L.A. of firefighting equipment and shipped it to Ukraine … to defend democracy, of course.\n\nIs there any doubt that the Apostle Paul was right when he told us, “we wrestle not with flesh and blood but against principalities, against powers, against rulers of darkness of this world, against spiritual wickedness in high places”?\n\nJoe Biden, or whoever his puppet-masters are, has made the truth of that scripture perfectly clear.","summary":"'My staff nominates Gov.

(AP) — Canada’s ambassador to Washington said Monday that Canada is prepared to buy more from the United States, including its next fleet of submarines, to appease President-elect Donald Trump’s concerns about the U.S.-Canada trade deficit. \n\nAmbassador Kirsten Hillman also warned Americans in an interview with The Associated Press that prices will go up for Americans almost immediately if Trump follows through with his plan to impose 25% tariffs on all Canadian products. \n\nThe ambassador also dismissed Trump’s talk of Canada becoming the 51st U.S. state, saying that’s how Trump negotiates. \n\n“He has a negotiating style which involves positioning himself in the best way he can for discussions. I think that is what this is,” Hillman told the AP. \n\nTrump continues to erroneously cast the U.S. trade deficit with Canada — a natural resource-rich nation that provides the U.S. with commodities like oil — as a subsidy.\n\nHillman noted Canada buys more from the United States than any other country but is prepared to buy more. \n\n“We are happy to source what we can from the United States. And we have some big military procurements coming up for example, replacing our entire submarine fleet,” she said. “Maybe those are some purchases that can happen from the U.S.”\n\nHillman said 70% of Canada’s military procurement is American sourced. That includes a plan to purchase 88 F-35 fighter jets. \n\nAlberta’s Premier Danielle Smith said earlier Monday she favors appeasing Trump by trying to narrow the trade gap, saying the solution is that Canada finds ways to buy more American goods. Smith visited Mar-a-Lago, Trump’s home in Florida, over the weekend and spoke to Trump. \n\nHillman has said the U.S. had a $75 billion trade deficit with Canada last year but noted a third of what Canada sells into the U.S. is energy exports. \n\nHillman said trade with Canada supports over 8 million jobs in the United States and Canada is the number one customer to 36 U.S. states. She said Canada provides a lot of primary materials that go into U.S. manufacturing.\n\n“Adding 25% tariffs to those products will raise the price for Americans almost immediately,” Hillman said. “And at a time when the cost of living is challenging, when food prices are high, it seems like the wrong direction to go in.”\n\nHillman also reiterated that Canada will retaliate if tariffs are placed on Canadian goods and that will mean a cost for Americans. \n\n“Canada will respond,” she said. “Therefore your number one customer will make American products more expensive and Canadians will probably look for alternatives to those products.”\n\nHillman said Canada is not interested in a trade war but said it will be hard for the Canadian government to not respond if the U.S. government makes choices that hurt Canadians. \n\nShe said it doesn’t make sense for Trump to reverse what he accomplished in his first term when he renegotiated the free trade deal with Canada and Mexico. \n\n“We are 99% tariff free with the United States, 99% tariff free. And that tariff level is as a result of the USMCA,” Hillman said, referring to the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement. “That was negotiated by President Trump. He achieved that success so why would we backtrack from this success that he achieved in his last administration. It just doesn’t make a lot sense.”\n\nHillman gave Trump credit for accelerating Canada’s plans to increase security at the border. Trump initially threatened to impose 25% tariffs on all Canadian goods if the government does not stem what Trump calls a flow of migrants and drugs in the U.S. — even though far fewer of each crosses into the U.S. from Canada than from Mexico, which Trump has also threatened.\n\nCanada now has a billion plus border security plan. \n\n“We have moved really quickly, I’ll be honest, because President Trump focused the mind to put together a full package of improvements,” Hillman said. \n\nHillman said also said the U.S. and Canada are in a “generational struggle” with China, a powerful adversary. Trump has been clear about the economic and security threat that Beijing poses, she said. The ambassador said Canada has the energy America needs to drive the artificial intelligence revolution.\n\n“That is really not possible, based on our experts and American experts, without greater cooperation with Canada through oil and gas, through nuclear, through hydro electricity,” Hillman said. \n\n“If we are working at odds then frankly China wins. China is trying to drive us apart. That is clear. They look for every opportunity to do so. That’s not good for us, our citizens and Americans.”","summary":"Canada ready to buy more American products to appease Trump's tariff threat, ambassador says  The Associated Press","url":"https://apnews.com/article/canada-ambassador-us-trump-hillman-9ced5ba12cd6526a2bbb4a810fa9af18","image":"https://dims.apnews.com/dims4/default/6927747/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2954x1662+0+669/resize/1440x810!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fassets.apnews.com%2Fb7%2F61%2F4e5e1d50db52a5f8d2ced88c2a1f%2F8d958cacfe7144a58fc4f1578383cb56","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-01-14 00:07:00","author":"Rob Gillies","authors":["Rob Gillies"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.274},{"id":280239626,"title":"Carter & Biden: Foreign policy disasters","text":"Presidents Joe Biden and Jimmy Carter, who are exiting the stage of history together, are accidental presidents whose tenures were marked by foreign policy disasters.\n\nCarter was defeated in a landslide when he ran for a second term in 1980, carrying just six states. Mr. Biden, the most unpopular president in 70 years, was blocked from running for reelection by leaders of his party.\n\nAfter Watergate, almost any Democrat could have won in 1976, even a peanut farmer and one-term governor of Georgia whose hallmark was moralizing.\n\nEven after he left office, Carter couldn’t stop lecturing the world, as in his 2006 book, “Palestine: Peace Not Apartheid,” which suggested that Israel was to blame for turmoil in the region.\n\nMr. Biden was a Democratic hack who was twice in the right place at the right time.\n\nIn 2008, Barack Obama tapped him as his running mate to reassure the party establishment. In 2020, Mr. Biden was the compromise candidate the party united behind to stop Sen. Bernie Sanders. COVID-19 gave him an excuse to hide for most of the campaign.\n\nIran figures prominently in the foreign policy fiascoes of both men. Carter eased the ayatollahs’ path to power. Mr. Biden aided their nuclear program and helped them spread terror throughout the Middle East.\n\nAt the beginning of his presidency, Carter announced that human rights would be the centerpiece of his foreign policy, then helped to bring to power one of the bloodiest regimes on Earth. Iran executed more than 2,000 political prisoners from 2021 to 2023.\n\nAt the start of the Carter years, the Shah of Iran, a longtime U.S. ally, was in power. Ayatollah Khomeini worked Carter like a pitchman at a carnival sideshow. We won’t be hostile to U.S. interests, Khomeini assured Washington. In Farsi, “Great Satan” is a term of endearment.\n\nWhile ostensibly supporting the Shah, we quietly undercut him. After he abdicated, we stopped the Iranian military from staging a coup to block Khomeini’s takeover.\n\nThe aftermath of the Iranian revolution included the 444-day Iran hostage crisis. A botched rescue operation was an embarrassment that foreshadowed Mr. Biden’s Afghanistan withdrawal.\n\nTo lure Iran back to negotiating a nuclear deal, Mr. Biden eased sanctions on its oil exports, which increased 50% during his time in office.\n\nIn the final year of the Trump administration, Iran’s military spending reached its lowest point in decades – about $3 billion. Under Mr. Biden, Tehran’s military budget doubled to $6.8 billion. That meant more support for the regime’s terrorist proxies, leading to Hamas’ attack on Israel on Oct. 7, 2023.\n\nMr. Biden also presided over our humiliating withdrawal from Afghanistan, which signaled weakness to the world and set the stage for years of chaos.\n\nIgnoring the warnings of his military and intelligence advisers, the president closed Bagram Air Base and relied on the Taliban to provide security at the Kabul airport, resulting in the deaths of 13 American service members and more than 100 Afghans.\n\nThe U.S. pulled all support from the Afghan military, which had lost 50,000 fighting the Taliban. Eager to be remembered as the president who ended our 20-year war in Afghanistan, Mr. Biden left behind $7 billion in military equipment and stranded tens of thousands of our allies.\n\nPresident-elect Donald Trump has promised to reassert U.S. sovereignty over the Panama Canal, which Carter fecklessly gave away in 1979.\n\nAt the time, President Ronald Reagan argued that control of the canal was vital to our security. But Carter couldn’t resist another opportunity to prove that in its international dealings, America was guided by “fairness, not force.”\n\nNow China, renowned for its fairness, is in a position to close the waterway. Through a Hong Kong-based company, it controls the ports at both ends of the canal.\n\nCarter normalized relations with China, betraying yet another ally, Taiwan.\n\nBy withdrawing our recognition of the budding democracy and agreeing to Beijing’s claim that Taiwan is part of One China, he planted a land mine that could explode in our faces whenever China decides to take the island by force.\n\nCarter and Mr. Biden came to Washington at about the same time. Mr. Biden was first elected to the Senate in 1972. Carter was elected president four years later.\n\nIt was fitting that President Biden delivered the eulogy at Jimmy Carter’s funeral. They delineated an era of monumental foreign policy failures – blunders with lethal consequences.\n\nThis column was first published at the Washington Times.","summary":"The 2 men exiting the stage of history together were both 'accidental presidents'","url":"https://www.wnd.com/2025/01/carter-biden-foreign-policy-disasters/","image":"https://www.wnd.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Bidens-Visit-the-Carters.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-01-14 00:05:54","author":"Don Feder","authors":["Don Feder"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.162},{"id":280241230,"title":"Governments urged to give ‘full-throated support’ to North Sea oil and gas","text":"Scottish ministers have been told that a presumption against new oil and gas developments in the North Sea “must go” – with business leaders in the north east saying the sector needs “full-throated support” from both Holyrood and Westminster.\n\nTwo years after the Scottish Government announced a presumption against such developments, Aberdeen and Grampian Chamber of Commerce (AGCC) has instead urged ministers to adopt a policy in favour of energy security, alongside a transition to net zero.\n\nChamber chief executive Russell Borthwick made a plea to First Minister John Swinney to switch to a stance of support for domestic oil and gas production – arguing this is preferable to having to import fossil fuels from other nations.\n\nHe made the call after US President-elect Donald Trump criticised the UK’s move away from oil and gas production, urging ministers to instead “open up” the North Sea and get rid of “windmills”.\n\nMr Borthwick said: “Donald Trump’s support for the North Sea is welcome, but it should not fall to the President-elect of America to make the case for jobs and investment here.\n\n“We need full-throated support for our oil and gas sector from both our governments, but particularly here in Scotland where it is such a crucial part of our economy.”\n\nHe insisted: “The presumption against oil and gas must go and be replaced with a policy position which will deliver energy security and transition in tandem.\n\n“If the alternative is importing oil and gas at a greater carbon cost, then we must favour domestic production.”\n\nThere was speculation last year after Mr Swinney took over as First Minister that the Scottish Government could end its presumption against new oil and gas developments, a policy which came in when Nicola Sturgeon was in charge.\n\nMr Swinney however has stressed the importance of ensuring climate compatibility assessments can be met before the government will support new developments.\n\nBut Mr Borthwick said that the “presumption against oil and gas is disconnected from reality” as he noted that last week energy firm Centrica gas warned that gas stores have fallen to “concerningly low” levels during the freezing cold weather.\n\nThe Aberdeen and Grampian Chamber of Commerce chief executive insisted that “even the most optimistic projections” showed hydrocarbons – such as old and gas – will “remain part of the energy mix for decades”, as he accused the Scottish Government of “burying its head in the sand” over this.\n\nMr Borthwick continued: “Oil and gas currently supports around 200,000 jobs across the UK, almost half of them in Scotland.\n\n“These aren’t just numbers – they are livelihoods, communities, and families.\n\n“Accelerating the decline of North Sea oil and gas will destroy this world-class supply chain, and for what? To make a symbolic point while we continue importing oil and gas from nations with far less stringent environmental standards and a much higher global carbon toll?”\n\nHe stressed the importance of using “the expertise of our oil and gas workforce to lead the global energy transition”, with Mr Borthwick stating: “The same engineers who make the North Sea one of the safest and cleanest production basins in the world can pioneer carbon capture, hydrogen production, and offshore wind.”\n\nBut he added: “We can’t get there by demonising the very industry that these workers and companies rely on for work.”\n\nActing Cabinet Secretary for Net Zero and Energy, Gillian Martin, said: “We are clear that any further extraction and use of fossil fuels must be consistent with Scotland’s climate obligations and just transition commitments.\n\n“It is vital that we take an evidence-based approach to the energy transition, which ensures that we support and retain the skills and investment needed for the transition to net zero.\n\n“Decisions on North Sea oil and gas licensing are reserved to the UK Government. We have consistently said that these should be made on a case-by-case basis and include rigorous assessments of both climate compatibility and energy security.”\n\nDavid Whitehouse, chief executive of Offshore Energies UK, said: “Homegrown affordable energy is critical to the success of the UK’s industrial strategy and broader plans for growth.\n\n“Where you get energy from and how much it costs is the cornerstone of the entire economy.\n\n“The UK is now importing more energy than at any time in the last 60 years, but we still have significant oil and gas reserves around in our offshore waters and we should use them responsibly alongside an acceleration of renewable energy.”\n\nTessa Khan, executive director at campaign group Uplift, said: “Oil and gas companies and their cheerleaders are increasingly out of step with the rest of the business community in Scotland.\n\n“According to a recent poll, two-thirds of Scottish business leaders support ending new oil and gas licensing and over 80% are in favour of the UK Government’s wider plans to end the role that fossil fuels play in generating the UK’s energy.\n\n“With our dependence on volatile gas driving energy bills up, it’s little wonder that they see it as benefiting their businesses as well as in the public interest.”\n\nA spokesperson from the UK Department for Energy Security and Net Zero said: “The best way to secure Scotland’s energy economy is to invest in the clean power transition.\n\n“That is why it is at the forefront of our drive towards net zero and clean energy, with Great British Energy’s headquarters to be located in Aberdeen.\n\n“Backed by £2 billion, we are supporting 11 green hydrogen projects across England, Scotland and Wales.\n\n“Our historic carbon capture funding is also the first step to a self-sustaining market and it is our firm ambition to proceed with projects in the Track-2 clusters.\n\n“Our priority is a fair, orderly and prosperous transition in the North Sea in line with our climate and legal obligations, and we will work with the sector to protect current and future generations of good jobs.”","summary":"Aberdeen and Grampian Chamber of Commerce said it wants the Scottish Government to end the presumption against new developments in the North Sea.","url":"https://www.standard.co.uk/business/business-news/governments-urged-to-give-fullthroated-support-to-north-sea-oil-and-gas-b1204600.html","image":"https://static.standard.co.uk/2025/01/14/00/13134201-3e3a855c-917f-4bfe-9626-7bd1de7d362f.jpg?width=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-01-14 00:01:00","author":"Katrine Bussey","authors":["Katrine Bussey"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.432},{"id":280240502,"title":"Chinese tech firms face curbs on overseas expansion under Trump 2.0, UBS analyst says","text":"Chinese tech companies face more risks in expanding their businesses overseas this year after Donald Trump returns to the White House later this month, with more policies expected to curb the expansion of the industry, according to a UBS analyst.\n“As the new US government takes office, we expect that there will be more policies or news that will affect Chinese companies’ overseas businesses, including cross-border e-commerce, video gaming, and artificial intelligence,” Kenneth Fong, head of China internet research at UBS, said in a media briefing in Shanghai on Monday.\nHowever, Chinese companies will continue to invest in overseas markets amid the geopolitical risks, he added.\nFong’s comments came days after the US Department of Defence added Tencent Holdings, China’s most valuable company, to its list of “Chinese military entities”, along with other tech companies including electric vehicle (EV) battery maker CATL and artificial intelligence (AI) champion SenseTime, raising concerns about further bifurcation in the technology spheres of the world’s two largest economies.\nChinese tech companies should worry about three things regarding geopolitical risks, according to Fong: the possibility of US companies being barred from investing in Chinese tech firms, potential additional restrictions on the purchase of AI chips, and the impact of trade tensions on their overseas businesses.\n\nWhile the Pentagon’s designation has no legal ramifications, analysts said it may give the US Treasury a reason to impose further sanctions and trade restrictions, which would make it harder for Tencent to buy certain products from US tech giants such as chip-design company Nvidia.\nMeanwhile, Beijing-based ByteDance is struggling with a looming US ban of its flagship product, the popular short-video platform TikTok.\nThe US Supreme Court last week heard arguments to determine whether the app can continue operating in the country without severing ties to its Chinese parent by January 19. A law passed last year gave ByteDance until that date to sell the US operations of the app, which has 170 million American users, or have it removed from US app stores.\nThe law allows for a single 90-day extension. President Joe Biden has given no indication that he plans to use that extension, but president-elect Trump, who takes office on January 20, asked the court to delay the deadline.\nA ban would have a huge impact on the company’s cross-border e-commerce business, TikTok Shop, which is now competing with Chinese rivals such as PDD Holdings’ Temu and fast fashion retailer Shein.\nA key step for these e-commerce platforms in 2025 is to expand into different countries and build scale, Fong said, adding that they still have a unique advantage in terms of algorithms, logistics and supply chain.\nThe drive by these big tech companies to venture overseas comes as the domestic internet industry, especially the e-commerce sector, faces fierce competition amid a slowing economy and sluggish consumer demand.\nUBS expects overall competition in the industry to decrease this year, while e-commerce platforms continue to fight for their piece of a sector with an expected annual growth rate of just 6 per cent.","summary":"Chinese companies will continue international push amid slowing growth at home, but face greater risks, UBS analyst Kenneth Fong says.","url":"https://www.scmp.com/tech/big-tech/article/3294584/chinese-tech-firms-face-curbs-overseas-expansion-under-trump-20-ubs-analyst-says","image":"https://cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2025/01/13/08fde989-1475-4fad-8466-abfb35c0f81d_54999b6c.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-01-14 00:00:23","author":"Ann Cao","authors":["Ann Cao"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"cn","sentiment":0.005},{"id":280238940,"title":"Latest Jan. 6 report gets the all clear from Trump's favorite judge","text":"On Monday, U.S. District Judge Aileen Cannon announced that she will allow the release of a portion of the Justice Department’s report by former special counsel Jack Smith on President-elect Donald Trump's efforts to overturn the 2020 election results and inciting an insurrection.\n\nWithout any future legal filings by Trump’s lawyer, the report could be released as soon as just after midnight on Tuesday morning. \n\nCannon, a Trump appointee, blocked the release of the report on Tuesday, but nearly a week later, she denied a motion requesting to stop the publication of the report by Smith, who was appointed by Attorney General Merrick Garland.

Trump’s team argued that Smith didn’t have the power to assemble the report and that any publication of his report by Garland would violate DOJ’s policy, practice, and the law.\n\nFor many, the legal drama surrounding Trump shows the flaws in America’s justice system. Despite his alleged involvement in inciting the Jan. 6 insurrection, attempting to subvert the 2020 election results, and mishandling classified documents, the legal system is granting him leeway. \n\nThe Supreme Court’s recent decisions, which shielded Trump from any accountability for his despicable actions by granting him broad immunity during his presidency—and now, for his second term—have deepened this sense of impunity for those in power with connections or resources. Smith himself even indicated that Trump would be \"dropped\" from the investigation now that he has returned to the White House.\n\nSmith quietly resigned from the DOJ on Sunday after bringing two failed cases against Trump.

In a recent interview with NBC News, Tom Homan, who has been tapped to serve as the “border czar” for President-elect Donald Trump’s incoming administration, said he’s considering the use of a hotline that Americans could call to report allegedly undocumented immigrants who they think have committed crimes. From NBC News’ report: This is a ridiculous idea for a number of reasons. There are already several ways that people can report such crimes, including through local and state police, child protective services and FBI field offices. Aside from furthering stereotypes, there’s no demonstrable result from distinguishing alleged suspects according to their perceived immigration status. And then there’s the fact that everyday Americans are not immigration experts who are equipped to determine someone’s status, so there’s ample reason to believe that such a hotline could subject many Americans to bigoted profiling. As an example, Oregon officials recently denounced a letter that circulated in a rural county, calling for residents to track and report “brown folks” suspected of being in the U.S. illegally. Homan’s hotline idea would essentially open the door to similar profiling by any idiot with a phone. Writing for Prism last week, journalist Sarah Prager noted several “bounty laws” that conservatives have introduced across the country — attempts to reward Americans with cash for reporting others who are believed to have run afoul of conservative laws policing abortion, the bathrooms that trans people can use and the books available in school libraries. This is the stuff of Stalinism — as in, these initiatives resemble the “mutual surveillance” promoted during Joseph Stalin’s brutal Soviet regime, in which he called on Russians to be vigilant in reporting others to authorities. And it’s also exposing hypocrisy in the conservative movement. On one hand, Republicans call themselves the party of limited government.

She has attracted a significant number of young followers who have used her videos as a how-to guide on how to navigate a second Donald Trump term. She has 253,800 followers on TikTok, where her videos have amassed 2.4 million likes.As Tim Walz's oldest child, she made several appearances on the campaign trial with her dad. The Montana State University graduate also went viral in the early days of her dad's candidacy when his supporters re-shared a video of the father-daughter duo at the Minnesota State Fair.What To KnowHope Walz began her TikTok video by describing the comments she received after the election, which mocked her father's electoral loss.She said that while she was \"very confused\" at first, after consideration she found it funny because she was \"so glad I'm not Donald Trump and JD Vance and I don't have to live in their skin.\"She said that while she believes those who feel called to make the country a better place should run for office and fill those positions, \"you shouldn't aspire\" to be the president \"for the sake of being president.\"What People Are SayingHope Walz said in the video: \"When people are like, You're never gonna go down as the second family, I'm like, 'OK?

His inaugural committee raised over $53 million, a record at the time.\n\nFormer President Bill Clinton attended a record 14 official balls during his second inauguration in 1997, which reportedly raised less than $24 million.\n\nPresident Joe Biden did not host any balls in 2021 due to the Covid-19 pandemic.","summary":"A member of the U.S. Army Herald Trumpets participates in a rehearsal for inauguration on the West Front of the U.S. Capitol on January 12, 2025 in Washington, DC.  Kevin Dietsch &#124; Getty Images Donald Trump&#8216;s presidential transition team on Monday released a schedule of official parties, gatherings and other events that will surround his &#8230;\n\n\nThe post Trump plans limited inauguration festivities despite massive fundraising haul appeared first on WorldNewsEra.","url":"https://worldnewsera.com/news/us-news/trump-plans-limited-inauguration-festivities-despite-massive-fundraising-haul/","image":"https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/108085558-1736775801285-gettyimages-2193544324-_d3_9646_f0ybhe6j.jpeg?v=1736775967&w=1920&h=1080","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-01-13 23:50:12","author":"Evelyn Blackwell","authors":["Evelyn Blackwell"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.073},{"id":280240642,"title":"Speaker Johnson calls for ‘conditions’ on California wildfire aid","text":"House Speaker Mike Johnson suggested on Monday that lawmakers might attach “conditions” to wildfire aid for California, where blazes in Los Angeles have killed at least 25 and burned hundreds of homes, one of the worst natural disasters in state history.\n\n“I think we’re going to have a serious conversation about that,” Johnson told reporters. “Obviously there has been water resource mismanagement, forest mismanagement, mistakes, all sorts of problems, and it does come down to leadership. It appears to us that state and local leaders were derelict in their duty in many respects. That’s something that has to be factored in.”\n\n“I think there should probably be conditions on that aid,” he added.\n\nJohnson also said the aid could be tied into negotiations around raising the debt ceiling.\n\nRepublican lawmakers reportedly floated the idea during a Sunday meeting with Donald Trump at Mar-a-Lago.\n\nThe proposal couldn’t be more different than what’s currently coming out of the White House.\n\nPresident Biden said last week the federal government would pay for 100 percent of the state’s disaster response costs for the next 180 days.\n\nCalifornia lawmakers have been girding themselves for wildfire aid to become entangled with the politics of the incoming administration.\n\n“Even if we nominally secure some of these things, the money won’t flow until Trump is president. And he’s just such a wild card, there’s reason for worry,” California Rep. Jared Huffman told Politico.\n\nTrump has threatened to withhold aid in the past for partisan reasons, and often speaks inaccurately about wildfires in the state.\n\nLast week, Trump claimed California Gavin Newsom refused to sign a “water restoration declaration” that would’ve freed up millions of additional gallons of water, a claim the governor’s office said was “pure fiction.”\n\nAs The Independent has reported, the state did not lack water supplies when blazes descended on Los Angeles, but rather has a water system built to fight municipal-level fires, not wildfire-scale incidents inside a major city. \n\nOn the campaign trail, Trump threatened to withhold wildfire aid if Newsom didn’t go along with his ideas on water policy.\n\n“We’re going to take care of your water situation and we’ll force it down [Gavin Newsom’s] throat and we’ll say, ‘Gavin if you don’t do it we’re not giving you any of that fire money that we send you all the time for all the forest fires that you have’,” Trump said at a rally in Coachella, California.\n\nRain is needed to improve California’s water system. Downtown Los Angeles has received only a fifth of an in of rain since July, making it the second-driest year in the area in 150 years, Cal Matters has reported\n\nDuring his first term, Trump also threatened to withhold wildfire funding until Newsom would “get his act together.”\n\nCongress made $100 billion of disaster aid available as part of the chaotic funding negotiations at the end of last year, and faces a March 14 deadline to pass a new government funding bill.","summary":"He suggests help could be traded for raising the debt ceiling","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/california-wildfire-aid-debt-ceiling-b2678905.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/01/07/16/2192831325.jpg?quality=75&width=1200&auto=webp","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/6vcUW2C3-4VHSaSK0.mp4","publish_date":"2025-01-13 23:47:26","author":"Josh Marcus","authors":["Josh Marcus"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.213},{"id":280241770,"title":"The race to replace Justin Trudeau: Who's in and who's out","text":"In the days since Prime Minister Justin Trudeau announced he'll be stepping down as leader, the list of potential candidates to replace him has considerably thinned.\n\nThe Liberal Party announced they will choose their next leader — and Canada's next prime minister — on March 9. Hopefuls have until Jan. 23 to declare their candidacy.\n\nHere's a look at who's declared their intentions, who's still thinking it over and who is out.\n\nJaime Battiste\n\nCape Breton, N.S., Liberal MP Jaime Battiste is mounting a campaign to replace Trudeau.\n\nBattiste made history in 2019 when he was elected as the first Mi'kmaw MP. Now he said he wants to make history again as the first Indigenous prime minister.\n\n\"Before there was a Premier Wab Kinew, there had to be an Elijah Harper,\" Battiste wrote in a statement.\n\n\"There must always be people willing to try … even if their journey is one meant to pave the way for future generations.\" \n\nBattiste said he's raised about $40,000 so far, a long way from the $350,000 required to officially enter the race. He said he knows that will be a challenge but said he has a plan.\n\nThe Nova Scotia MP currently serves as parliamentary secretary to the Minister of Crown-Indigenous Relations and chair of the Liberal Indigenous caucus.\n\nThe Conservatives accused the Liberals for being hypocritical for allowing Battiste to run in 2019 after he admitted to racist and sexist posts on social media.\n\nFrank Baylis\n\nHe might not be a household name, but businessman Frank Baylis was the first person to throw his hat in the ring. \n\nBaylis represented Pierrefonds-Dollard in Montreal's West Island during the Trudeau Liberals' first term before stepping down in 2019.\n\nHe serves as executive chair of Baylis Medical Tech, the family company he sold to a larger American firm, Boston Scientific, for $1.75 billion US in 2022.\n\nBaylis has been a staunch opponent of Bill 21, the controversial Quebec legislation that bars some public sector workers in positions of authority from wearing overt religious symbols such as hijabs or yarmulkes at their jobs, for the sake of secularism. \n\nHe is the co-president of Non à la Loi 21 (No to Law 21), one of many organizations hoping to fight the legislation at the Supreme Court of Canada. \n\nChandra Arya\n\nOttawa backbencher Chandra Arya hasn't had a high profile in the Trudeau government, but has made waves ever since announcing his candidacy.\n\nHe told CBC's Power & Politics he does not believe he needs to speak French to become prime minister.\n\n\"How's your French?\" host David Cochrane asked near the end of the interview.\n\n\"Nope,\" Arya immediately replied.\n\nWhen asked if his lack of French could hinder his ability to reach out to French-speaking Canadians and Quebecers, Arya quickly dismissed those concerns. He also said he wants to abolish the monarchy.\n\nLast summer, Arya travelled to India and met with Prime Minister Narendra Modi. A statement from Global Affairs Canada at the time said Arya \"travelled to India on his own initiative and was not representing the Government of Canada.\"\n\nWho's considering \n\nChrystia Freeland\n\nPerceived to be one of the front-runners, former finance minister Chrystia Freeland has been a pillar of the Liberal government since it swept into power in 2015.\n\nSources told Radio-Canada that Freeland is expected to announce she's entering the race before Jan. 20.\n\nBorn in Peace River, Alta., with degrees from Harvard and Oxford, Freeland worked as a journalist and published two books before jumping into politics.\n\nShe first won the riding of Toronto Centre in a 2013 byelection. After the riding's boundaries were redrawn she stood for University-Rosedale in 2015 and has represented it ever since.\n\nShe has held several high-profile cabinet positions including foreign affairs minister during the tense negotiation of the Canada-United States-Mexico Agreement (CUSMA), during Donald Trump's first term as U.S. president. \n\nShe was later promoted to finance minister in 2020, becoming the first woman in Canada to hold the position. She was also given the title as deputy prime minister. \n\nProud of her Ukrainian roots, Freeland has been outspoken against Russian President Vladimir Putin on the world stage.\n\nFreeland resigned from cabinet in mid-December, which sent shock waves through Ottawa and galvanized a caucus to push Trudeau out.\n\nIn a letter to Trudeau that was subsequently posted to social media, Freeland said she had no choice but to resign after Trudeau approached her about moving to another cabinet role. It was later revealed she had been offered a position in charge of Canada-U.S. relations.\n\nIt later came out that Trudeau had planned to replace her at finance with Mark Carney — suspected to be her main opponent in the Liberal leadership race — and put her in charge of Canada-U.S. relations. \n\nFreeland took a jab at Trudeau's handling of the economy, denouncing in the letter what she called the government's \"costly political gimmicks.\" She went on to write that she and Trudeau had been \"at odds\" in recent weeks about how to handle the incoming U.S. administration.\n\nMark Carney\n\nFormer central banker Mark Carney has been orbiting the Liberal Party for years and could finally make it official. \n\nA source close to his team said he's expected to formally announce his campaign to replace Trudeau this week. \n\nCarney served as the governor of the Bank of Canada for seven years starting in 2008 during the global financial crisis. \n\nHe then led the Bank of England in 2013, the first non-Briton to hold the position since the United Kingdom's central bank was established in 1694.\n\nBorn in Fort Smith, N.W.T., and raised in Edmonton, Carney had a 13-year career with Goldman Sachs in its London, Tokyo, New York and Toronto offices.\n\nThe 59-year-old had been tapped as a special adviser to the party in September, becoming chair of a task force on economic growth.\n\nAt the time he sidestepped questions about his leadership ambitions: \"I'm interested in doing something, not being something,\" he said.\n\nAfter Trudeau's resignation announcement, Carney released a statement saying he would \"closely\" consider a decision to run for the leadership.\n\n\"I'm encouraged and honoured by the support that I've already been hearing from Liberal MPs and Liberals across the country who want us to move forward with positive change and a winning economic plan,\" he said in a statement.\n\nChristy Clark\n\nFormer B.C. premier Christy Clark told CBC Radio's The House she is \"seriously thinking about\" running to replace Trudeau.\n\nClark was first elected to the B.C. legislature in 1996 and built her reputation as an opposition critic before becoming a cabinet minister in Gordon Campbell's government.\n\nClark became the first woman in B.C. political history to have a baby while serving in cabinet and later quit politics in 2005 saying she wanted to spend more time with her young son. \n\nShe didn't stray too far from the public spotlight, though, hosting a radio show and writing weekly columns.\n\nWhen Campbell announced he was stepping down, following his government's deeply unpopular decision to introduce a harmonized sales tax, Clark sought and won the B.C. Liberal Party leadership in 2011 — making her the province's 35th premier. \n\nShe was a polarizing two-term premier who led the province through five balanced budgets. Clark also pushed controversial mega-projects, including Site C dam, establishing the LNG industry and the Massey Bridge replacement.\n\nBy 2017 her Liberals were reduced to 43 seats — just short of a majority — and was taken down by an NDP-Green confidence and supply agreement.\n\nWhile she has yet to officially launch her bid, the Clark campaign has already hit a snag after she claimed she'd never been a member of the Conservative Party.\n\nClark publicly endorsed Jean Charest in the Conservative leadership race in 2022 and said she intended to join the party to vote for her preferred candidate.\n\n\"I never got a membership and I never got a ballot,\" Clark told CBC host Catherine Cullenn\n\nA spokesperson for the Conservative Party refuted Clark's claims and provided a screenshot of their records.\n\n\"Well, I misspoke. Sh*t happens. Lesson learned,\" Clark said on social media.\n\nShe added that she has always been clear that she supported Charest to stop Pierre Poilievre.\n\nKarina Gould\n\nGovernment House Leader Karina Gould has been amassing a team of organizers and supporters.\n\nAt 37 years old, the Burlington, Ont., MP would be the youngest candidate in the race. \n\nGould has served in cabinet since 2017, taking the democratic institutions portfolio after Trudeau reneged on his promise to bring in electoral reform. \n\nShe made history becoming the first federal cabinet minister to take a maternity leave after giving birth to her son Oliver in 2018. \n\nGould served as minister for international development before she was shuffled into the families, children and social development portfolio, where she was tasked with dealing with the political mess of backlogged passport applications. \n\nShe also helped usher in one of the government's marquee policies: $10-a-day child care.\n\nAs the government's leader in the House of Commons, Gould routinely squares off against Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre.\n\nJonathan Wilkinson\n\nEnergy and Natural Resources Minister Jonathan Wilkinson has said he's \"actively considering\" a leadership run.\n\nRaised in Saskatchewan before heading further west to British Columbia, Wilkinson spent more than 20 years in the private sector largely focused on developing green technologies.\n\nThe Rhodes scholar turned North Vancouver MP was elected when the Liberals won in 2015 and has been part of Trudeau's cabinet since 2018. He was previously environment minister and fisheries minister before taking on the natural resources portfolio.\n\nWilkinson has been a vocal defender of the Liberals' carbon tax in the face of increasing criticism from Conservatives and premiers who oppose the policy.\n\nFrançois-Philippe Champagne\n\nInnovation Minister François-Philippe Champagne has long been considered a potential successor to Trudeau, who has cited fellow Shawinigan, Que., resident Jean Chrétien as an inspiration.\n\nWith nicknames including \"Franky Bubbles\" and the \"Energezier Bunny,\" Champagne is known for his buoyant and gregarious energy on Parliament Hill.\n\nA lawyer and businessman by trade, Champagne worked as vice-president and senior counsel for the ABB Group, a multinational electrical engineering corporation, before running for the Liberals in 2015.\n\nHe took his seat at the cabinet table in 2017, eventually being given the international trade and foreign affairs portfolios.\n\nHe was later shuffled and made minister of Innovation, Science and Industry, where he has been credited with successfully enticing global giants like Volkswagen, Honda Motor Co. and Stellantis to build factories in Canada. \n\nA source close to Champagne said he's received a high number of calls from Liberals encouraging him to run both provincially and federally, but said he's not looking at Quebec politics at the moment. \n\nAnita Anand\n\nTransport Minister Anita Anand, long believed to have leadership ambitions, announced not only will she not be seeking the job but she's also not going to reoffer as an MP.\n\nThe Oakville, Ont., representative was first named to cabinet in 2019 and has held several portfolios. She quickly rose to prominence as procurement minister during the pandemic when acquiring vaccines and personal protective equipment became a priority for the government.\n\nShe was later promoted to defence minister in 2021, holding the file during Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine the next year.\n\nIn one of her first acts, Anand transferred the investigation and prosecution of sexual misconduct cases within the Canadian forces into the civilian justice system — a move that came as the military reeled from several investigations. \n\nTrudeau's 2023 shuffling of Anand to president of the Treasury Board caused rumours of a demotion. She has since taken over the Transport file.\n\nSteven MacKinnon \n\nAfter suggesting he was open to running, Labour Minister Steven MacKinnon has since said he won't put his name forward.\n\nIn a statement posted to social media, MacKinnon, who represents the riding of Gatineau, said the party is \"at a crossroads, and must make important decisions very quickly.\"\n\n\"The leadership race requires diverse, experienced and pragmatic voices, both in French and in English.

Despite being a political newbie, she finished second. \n\nDominic LeBlanc\n\nThe newly appointed finance minister crushed the hopes of many of his caucus colleagues when he announced on Jan. 8 he won't be seeking the top job.\n\nIn a statement, the New Brunswick MP said he is touched by support he received but said Canada is at \"a critical juncture in its relationship\" with the U.S.\n\n\"The threat these tariffs pose to our nation's economic well-being and to the livelihood of a countless number of Canadian families cannot be understated — and as such, it requires nothing less than my full attention,\" the minister said.\n\nLeBlanc, babysitter turned ally to Trudeau, has served as public safety and intergovernmental affairs minister. \n\nHis ties to the Liberal Party run deep: his father Roméo LeBlanc worked as press secretary to former primer minister Lester Pearson and was a Pierre Elliott Trudeau cabinet minister before serving as Governor General.","summary":"In the days since Prime Minister Justin Trudeau announced he'll be stepping down as leader, the list of potential candidates to replace him has considerably thinned.

El pueblo palestino merece la paz y el derecho a determinar su propio futuro.

Según las últimas predicciones, nunca nos superarán», sostuvo.\n\nSobre la caótica retirada de Afganistán, uno de los episodios más controvertidos de su mandato, el presidente reivindicó que cumplió con su promesa de terminar con las dos décadas de conflicto.\n\n«Poner fin a la guerra fue lo correcto y creo que la historia lo reflejará», apuntó.\n\nEl presidente también advirtió de que la crisis climática es «la mayor amenaza existencial para la humanidad» y lamentó que varios colaboradores de Trump nieguen el cambio climático: «Creo que son de otro siglo.

After Joe Biden became president, he kept Weiss to finish his work, even while replacing almost all other US attorneys, as is common.\n\nAttorney General Merrick Garland elevated Weiss to “special counsel” in 2023, after a proposed Hunter Biden plea deal imploded in court.\n\nWeiss charged two people during the course of his investigation: Hunter Biden and Alexander Smirnov, a former FBI informant who falsely accused Hunter and his father of taking $10 million in bribes from Ukraine. House Republicans used those claims to bolster their failed impeachment push.\n\nSmirnov was sentenced last week to six years in prison.\n\nDuring Weiss’ investigation, he made history by becoming the first prosecutor in American history to file criminal charges against the son of a sitting president. Hunter Biden was convicted by a jury on three counts related to his unlawful purchase and possession of a gun while abusing illicit drugs.\n\nWeiss also brought a nine-count federal tax indictment against Biden, who pleaded guilty on what was supposed to be the first day of his trial in September. He admitted to tax evasion, filing false tax returns, and failing to file and pay his taxes on time.\n\nHunter Biden was never sentenced for those crimes, because he was pardoned by his father after the November election, short-circuiting the court process.\n\nThe Weiss special counsel investigation has been fraught with allegations of politicization from both sides of the aisle. He has previously denied that his work was hampered by any political interference.\n\nThe Biden family and some Democrats have accused Weiss of unfairly targeting Hunter and doing Trump’s bidding, caving to his demands to indict Hunter Biden. But many Republicans argued that Weiss went soft on Hunter and offered him a “sweetheart deal” that would’ve swept his crimes under the rug, if it hadn’t fallen apart.\n\nThis story has been updated with additional developments.\n\n(Copyright (c) 2024 CNN.

No politician’s reputation has been sullied as much as Gov. Gavin Newsom’s.\n\nAs the wildfires in Los Angeles continue to rage, Newsom has sputtered and flailed—sometimes literally. He’s becoming the object of ire for appropriately irate Californians who are rightly asking why he and the mayor of Los Angeles failed to adequately prevent and prepare for these huge fires.\n\nAn angry mother whose neighborhood burned down confronted Newsom about his failed leadership, but Newsom tried to scurry away. He then said that he was “literally” calling President Joe Biden before saying he actually had no reception.\n\nThe fact is that Newsom can’t answer why his state is so unprepared for fire danger. Nobody is really buying the cries of “climate change!” anymore, much to the legacy media’s shock and confusion.\n\nIn fact blaming “climate change” isn’t registering at all with Americans in the wake of the California fires.\n\nNewsom and those who run California really do deserve much of the blame for not just the Los Angeles fires, but the towering infernos that have been ravaging the state for years. They’ve done a poor job of managing state land and a worse job of managing the state’s water resources. They seem uninterested in investing in fire prevention despite the state wasting hundreds of billions of dollars on countless useless projects, like the bullet train to nowhere.\n\nAccording to Fox News, Newsom cut $100 million from the fire budget this year. Yes, spending on the issue is up from six years ago as Newsom angrily insists, but that doesn’t excuse the fact that Newsom deprioritized one of the most important problems the state has faced in the last decade.\n\nNewsom and his allies in Sacramento would rather spend that money on resisting incoming President Donald Trump.\n\nLeft-wing politicians like Newsom insist that they’ve long foreseen the doom of climate change. But if California’s huge fires really are a result of climate change, why have they foreseen this doom and done nothing?\n\nWhere are California’s new reservoirs? The state hasn’t built one since 1979.\n\nCalifornia Democrats, now so used to operating in a one-party state where the media essentially peddles the party line, haven’t been asked to govern in decades. They are totally unprepared for the storm now that their media allies can’t drown out the criticism.\n\nThis is what happens when government leaders only care about ideological pet projects and have no concern with being held accountable for results. California spent $24 billion on combatting homelessness over the last five years, but never bothered tracking the effectiveness of their programs. Is it any wonder this sort of governance extends to other areas too?\n\nThe Left cares a lot less about stopping the effects of climate change and a lot more about funding green initiatives—run by their friends and donors, of course—and transforming Western economies. They’ve used natural disasters to keep this scam going as long as possible.\n\nCalifornia’s obsession with environmentalism is destroying its environment and making it impossible to fix once disaster has struck. Newsom likely knows this, which might explain why he announced that he’ll suspend an onerous environmental law that would impede rebuilding after the fires. That’s nice, but we’ll see if it lasts.\n\nThe last time Newsom committed the state to doing better land management it turned out to be less than a half-measure farce.\n\n“In 2019, Newsom issued an executive order to devote more than $1 billion to wildfire prevention,” City Journal reported. “But a 2021 investigation found that the governor had misled the public about the acreage of fuel-reduction projects completed in the state: just 11,399 acres, versus his claim of 90,000.”\n\nAll show and no substance.\n\nSo, what comes next for Newsom?\n\nIf you recall, during the COVID-19 lockdowns, he was seen dining at a fancy restaurant while his state was almost totally shuttered. Somehow the slick governor wiggled out of that controversy and escaped being recalled.\n\nBut Newsom’s failure and lack of leadership this time is even more apparent, and the media environment is less forgiving. He’s getting a taste of what U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer is facing right now with the explosion of anger over Pakistani rape gangs. After decades of having complete media control, left-wing institutionalists aren’t used to having to defend their failures to an angry public no longer accepting the force-fed Narrative.\n\nNewsom may be in real trouble this time, especially given his larger political ambitions. Is this the kind of leadership that can appeal to the nation on the road to the White House?\n\nThe editors at The Free Press compared Newsom to another young media darling governor of New York whose career cratered because of failure during a natural disaster.\n\n“In 1969, New York [M]ayor John Lindsay—like Newsom, a young and attractive liberal who dreamed of the presidency—saw his political career effectively end when a blizzard dropped 15 inches of snow on the city,” the editors wrote. “Streets went unplowed for days, leaving the city paralyzed. Lindsay’s White House dreams ended then and there, amid heckles from his constituents.”\n\nMaybe Newsom survives this disaster in California, but his tenure in office will now be defined by his failure on the fire issue.\n\nIt’s hard not to see what’s happening in the Golden State, which is looking a lot more charred black these days, and not think that the country should avoid this kind of mismanagement at all costs.","summary":"California’s Democrat Party elites are feeling the burn of their own failures to protect their state from devastating, uncontrolled fires.

The funds will be used to establish a public interest foundation supporting the AT Protocol and build independent infrastructure including a second \"relay\" system. The relay is effectively a backup index of all content on the network that ensures developers and users can access posts even if Bluesky restricts access to its data. The capital will also be used to fund developers to create new applications on the protocol.At the time of publishing, the campaign had raised nearly $18,000 from 273 donors on GoFundMe.According to Syed, one of the Foundation's key goals is to operate the AT Protocol infrastructure independently from Bluesky.\"The greater the number of stakeholders who build on AT Protocol, the more countervailing power they have with regards to Bluesky or any other large company involved in the network,\" she told Business Insider. \"The Foundation will operate AT Protocol infrastructure independently from Bluesky to ensure that there is always an alternative.\"Roger McNamee, an early Facebook investor turned tech critic who is backing the initiative, told BI that the project comes at a time when users are increasingly frustrated with existing platforms.\"We're in a world right now where every new startup is either crypto or AI,\" McNamee said. \"Show me something that might actually make the world a better place. If this works, it's going to make the world a much better place.\"Over the last few months, Bluesky has seen explosive growth. BI reported last week that the company is in the final stages of raising new funding led by Bain Capital Ventures that would value it at around $700 million. The platform reached nearly 26 million users by the end of 2024, with nearly half joining in the last six weeks of the year following Donald Trump's election victory.While Bluesky has positioned itself as an alternative to X, Free Our Feeds' backers argue that even Bluesky's venture capital-backed structure could eventually face similar pressures as other commercial platforms.\"Bluesky is built on values we share, by people we admire. However, founders are not companies,\" the project's FAQ states. \"They will come under the same pressure all businesses face to maximize return to their investors.\"The campaign's nine custodians include executives from Mozilla, the Social Web Foundation, and other nonprofit technology organizations. Development Gateway, a US nonprofit organization, will hold funds raised through the crowdfunding campaign.The timing of the announcement comes just as Meta significantly scaled back its fact-checking program and as X continues to struggle with advertiser exodus under Musk's leadership. The initiative's backers argue that these recent developments highlight the risks of concentrated ownership of social platforms.\"We've gone a really long time since people in Silicon Valley actually solved a problem that existed,\" McNamee noted, arguing that the project represents a rare opportunity to address fundamental issues with how social media platforms are structured and controlled.The foundation aims to be operational by the end of 2025. While ambitious in scope, the project's backers acknowledge the challenges ahead but argue that recent events at major platforms have created an opening for fundamental change in how social media operates.\"Centralized ownership of platforms — our digital public square — leads to a constantly shifting, opaque digital environment in which people can lose their digital public square and livelihoods from a single billionaire's decision,\" Syed said.\"We can do better. The internet doesn't need to be like this, and if we work together, it won't be.\"","summary":"The campaign aims to raise $30 million to build an open source social platform free from \"billionaire control\".","url":"https://www.businessinsider.com/free-our-feeds-takes-on-billionaire-controlled-social-media-platforms-2025-1","image":"https://i.insider.com/675dd83727808b3289cd42dd?width=1200&format=jpeg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-01-13 23:41:54","author":"Pranav Dixit","authors":["Pranav Dixit"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.303},{"id":280239612,"title":"Significant progress made in talks over Israel-Hamas ceasefire and hostage release, officials say","text":"U.S. and Arab mediators made significant progress overnight toward brokering a ceasefire in the Israel-Hamas war and the release of scores of hostages held in the Gaza Strip, but a deal hasn't been reached yet, officials said Monday.Four officials acknowledged that progress has been made and said the coming days would be critical for ending more than 15 months of fighting that has destabilized the Middle East. They spoke on condition of anonymity because they weren't authorized to discuss the talks.A U.S. official briefed on the negotiations said all sides are “closer than we’ve ever been, but it could still fall apart.” The official declined to predict the timing of a potential agreement because he said it is too uncertain, with multiple moving parts still in play.Two other officials, including one associated with Hamas, said there were still a number of hurdles. On several occasions over the past year, U.S. leaders have said they were on the verge of reaching a deal, only to have talks stall.Another person familiar with the talks said there had been a breakthrough overnight and there was a proposed deal on the table. Israeli and Hamas negotiators will take it to their leaders for final approval, the person said.The person said mediators from Qatar had put renewed pressure on Hamas to accept the agreement, while U.S. President-elect Donald Trump's envoy, Steve Witkoff, was pressing the Israelis. Witkoff recently joined the negotiations and has been in the region in recent days.The person said the mediators had handed the draft deal to each side and the next 24 hours would be pivotal.An Egyptian official said there had been good progress overnight, but it would likely take a few more days, and the sides were aiming for a deal before Trump's inauguration on Jan. 20.A Hamas official who spoke anonymously because he wasn't authorized to brief the media said a number of contentious issues still need to be resolved, including an Israeli commitment to ending the war and details about the withdrawal of Israeli troops and the exchange of hostages for Palestinian prisoners.The Qatari palace said the emir of Qatar, Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani, met with Hamas' delegation in Doha as well as with Witkoff and Brett McGurk, President Joe Biden’s top Middle East adviser. Al Thani also spoke by phone with Biden, who stressed the urgent need for a deal.RELATED STORY | White House is reportedly working closely with Trump admin on Gaza ceasefire and hostage dealThe Biden administration, along with Egypt and Qatar, has spent more than a year trying to broker an agreement to end the deadliest war ever fought between Israelis and Palestinians and secure the release of scores of hostages captured in Hamas' attack on southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, which triggered the conflict.But the sides have been divided over the details of the planned exchange of hostages for Palestinian prisoners held by Israel, as well as the nature of the ceasefire itself. Hamas has said it won't release the remaining captives without an end to the war, while Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has vowed to continue the campaign until “total victory” over the militant group.Under discussion now is a phased ceasefire. Netanyahu has repeatedly signaled he is committed only to the first phase, a partial hostage release in exchange for a weekslong halt in fighting. The possibility of a lasting ceasefire and other issues would be negotiated after the first phase begins. Hamas has demanded a full withdrawal and complete end to the war, and is hoping this first phase will lead to that outcome.A deal could weaken Netanyahu’s coalition, which includes two far-right factions that have threatened to leave the government if Israel makes too many concessions. Members of the opposition have promised to give Netanyahu the support he needs to approve a hostage release, but the hardliners' anger could be a source of instability down the road.Ten hardline members of Israel's parliament sent a letter to Netanyahu expressing their opposition to a deal that does not allow Israeli soldiers to maintain a presence in strategic parts of the Gaza Strip, which previously has been a non-starter for Hamas.Netanyahu is hoping the prospect of a Trump administration — which includes allies of the West Bank settler movement — will persuade his partners to remain in the government.Biden, who hopes to wrap up a deal before leaving office next week, spoke with Netanyahu about the talks on Sunday.The head of Israel’s Mossad foreign intelligence agency, David Barnea, and McGurk were both in Doha. Barnea’s presence meant high-level Israeli officials who would need to sign off on any agreement are once again involved in the talks.Just one brief ceasefire has been achieved during the war, and that was in the earliest weeks of fighting.Families of the roughly 100 hostages still held in Gaza have been pressing Netanyahu to reach a deal to bring their loved ones home.In Gaza, Palestinians hope for a stop to Israel’s military campaign, which has devastated much of the territory and driven around 90% of its 2.3 million people from their homes. At least 14 Palestinians, including a family of five, were killed in three separate Israeli airstrikes Monday in northern Gaza, according to Gaza's Health Ministry.Five Israeli soldiers were killed in Beit Hanoun in northern Gaza on Monday, raising the number of Israeli soldiers killed in combat in the north over the past week to 15. The large number of fatalities could lead to more support for a ceasefire among the Israeli public.Israel’s campaign in Gaza has killed more than 46,000 Palestinians, the majority women and children, according to the territory’s Health Ministry, whose count doesn’t give a breakdown between fighters and civilians. Hamas-led militants killed about 1,200 people and abducted around 250 others in the attack that ignited the war.In Jerusalem, around 1,000 people blocked the main entrance to the city and demonstrated against a deal, marching with a sign that read “You have no mandate to surrender to Hamas.”In Tel Aviv, dozens of supporters of the hostages spelled out “HOME!” at the entrance to the city’s main military base.“We’re not getting any guidance yet from the government of Israel, understanding if it is a deal for all the hostages or is it just a partial deal,” said Ruby Chen, whose son, Israeli-American Itay Chen, was taken hostage from his military base. Israel determined that Chen was likely killed on Oct. 7, 2023, and his body is still in Gaza.Ruby Chen said when it seemed that talks were starting to gain momentum 10 days ago, he flew to Qatar with other families to press for a deal to include all of the hostages, including the bodies of those who have died.Inside Gaza, “we hear that there are negotiations every day, but we see nothing,” said Mazen Hammad, a resident of the southern city of Khan Younis. “When we see it on the ground, then we believe that there is a truce.”","summary":"U.S. and Arab mediators made significant progress overnight toward brokering a ceasefire in the Israel-Hamas war and the release of scores of hostages held in the Gaza Strip.","url":"https://www.scrippsnews.com/world/israel-at-war/significant-progress-made-in-talks-over-israel-hamas-ceasefire-and-hostage-release-officials-say","image":"https://ewscripps.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/c715693/2147483647/strip/true/crop/4785x2512+0+273/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fewscripps-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fd2%2F9e%2Fb51e35bb45efadec9b841779f252%2Fap25013540674136.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-01-13 23:40:48","author":"AP via Scripps News","authors":["AP via Scripps News"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.497},{"id":280238812,"title":"China Won't \"Surpass\" US, Says Biden In Farewell Speech","text":"Joe Biden said Monday that America was stronger on the global stage than it had been for decades, in a swansong foreign policy speech one week before Donald Trump's White House comeback.The outgoing US president took aim at Russia, China and Iran, and urged the West to maintain support for Ukraine in an address at the State Department setting out his international legacy.But Biden's unspoken target was Trump as he touted his rebuilding of international alliances over the last four years after his Republican rival's chaotic first term.\"The United States is winning the worldwide competition compared to four years ago,\" said Biden, after diplomats at the State Department gave him a standing ovation.\"America is stronger. Our alliances are stronger, our adversaries and competitors are weaker.\"The Democrat added that America's ties with its allies were the strongest \"in decades,\" and said partners in the NATO military alliance were now \"paying their fair share.\"(function(v,d,o,ai){ai=d.createElement(\"script\");ai.defer=true;ai.async=true;ai.src=v.location.protocol+o;d.head.appendChild(ai);})(window, document, \"//a.vdo.ai/core/v-ndtv/vdo.ai.js\");Trump has repeatedly criticized NATO countries, at one point saying he would encourage Russia to do \"whatever the hell it wants\" to allies that did not pay their way.The incoming president has also previously expressed admiration for Russian President Vladimir Putin -- but Biden mocked Putin over the progress of Moscow's invasion of Ukraine.\"When Putin invaded, he thought he'd conquer Kyiv in a matter of days. The truth is, since that war began I'm the only one that stood in the center of Kyiv, not him,\" said Biden.Biden became the first sitting US president to visit a warzone not controlled by American forces when he made a top secret visit to Ukraine's capital in 2023.He said the United States and its allies \"can't walk away\" from Ukraine, to which Washington has sent billions of dollars in military aid since the war started in 2022.- China won't 'surpass' US -\"There is more to do,\" said Biden.Trump has vowed to get a Russia-Ukraine peace deal \"in 24 hours\" and there are fears in Kyiv he may force a ceasefire that sees Ukraine cede territory to Moscow.Biden meanwhile insisted that China would \"never surpass us\" and that the United States would remain the world's dominant superpower.\"According to the latest predictions, on China's current course they will never surpass us -- period,\" Biden said.He added that Washington managed its complex ties with Beijing and that the relationship \"never tipped over into conflict\" in his four years as president.Biden's speech was more restrained on Israel's war in Gaza, with his administration facing criticism from within his own party for its unstinting support of Israel.But he said a Gaza ceasefire and hostage-release deal was \"on the brink\" of \"finally coming to fruition.\"The Democrat also defended another major foreign policy fiasco -- the fall of Afghanistan's US-backed government to the Taliban and the bloody US withdrawal of 2021.\"Ending the war was the right thing to do. And I believe history will reflect that,\" Biden said.The 82-year-old president finally urged the Trump administration to continue Biden's green energy policies, saying climate deniers under Trump were \"dead wrong\" and \"come from a different century.\"Biden's foreign policy speech will be followed by a farewell address to the nation from the Oval Office in primetime on Wednesday.(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)","summary":"Joe Biden said Monday that America was stronger on the global stage than it had been for decades, in a swansong foreign policy speech one week before Donald Trump's White House comeback.","url":"https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/china-wont-surpass-us-says-joe-biden-in-farewell-speech-7467852","image":"https://c.ndtvimg.com/2025-01/l6ninuqk_joe-biden_625x300_14_January_25.jpeg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-01-13 23:40:34","author":"Agence France-Presse","authors":["Agence France-Presse"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"in","sentiment":0.047},{"id":280237402,"title":"California pastor eviscerates everyone to blame for LA fires in viral three-minute takedown","text":"An irate California pastor has gone viral for his sermon hitting out at the state's Democratic leadership as deadly wildfires continue to spread across Los Angeles.\n\nJack Hibbs, the founding pastor of Calvary Chapel Chino Hills, did not mince words as he spoke out about the failures of Mayor Karen Bass and Governor Gavin Newsom, calling them both 'incompetent' for their handling of the massive blazes.\n\n'This is the most wealthy state in the 50. We pay the most in taxes, the most in gas, we pay the most in electricity, you name it - if it's in California, we pay the most for it,' he began.\n\n'Why? Because of our government.\n\n'Why? Because of things that Sacramento does because they can,' Hibbs said of the seat of California's state government.\n\nHe went on to say that California has been under complete Democratic control, noting that the party has a 'supermajority' in the state government - which he said means 'nobody can oppose their decision making.\n\n'And now you've got it, you got a situation where a catastrophe came and the billions of dollars that you and I gave were diverted to other woke stupid Democratic projects.\n\n'That's not hyperbole, that's a fact,' he said amid uproar over the Los Angeles Fire Department's diversity chief being paid over $300,000 - despite apparently admitting that she cannot pull a man out of a burning building.\n\n'I'm upset and I'm angry, and it's the right kind of anger,' Hibbs told his congregation as he spoke out about Los Angeles' fire hydrants being left without water and hit out at President Joe Biden's explanation.\n\nThe president brazenly claimed that the hydrants were turned off to save electricity.\n\n'In some cases, that might be true. If the hydrants are on top of a mountain, you need a motor to drive the water up,' Hibbs admitted.\n\nBut, he said, 'That's extremely rare, and it wasn't the case in these fires,' which he blamed on 'bad management [and] horrific politicians who took your money and took trips like Karen Bass, the mayor of LA, she decided to go to Africa the week of the fires to go on a little you paid for.\n\n'She was really put out when she was told to come home,' Hibbs claimed, before launching into an attack on Newsom, who he said was caught laughing on tape at one of the command centers 'while he spend nine point, so many millions of your dollars to buy himself a new house.\n\n'It's time to replace the leadership in California,' Hibbs concluded, to raucous applause.\n\n'You don't need any more examples,' he said. 'These fires could have been stopped.'\n\nBut Hibbs was not the only one criticizing the government's handling of the fires, as Elon Musk - who is set to lead incoming President Donald Trump's new Department of Government Efficiency - posting about the state's leadership just two days after the fires broke out. \n\n'The immense loss of homes in LA is primarily due to: 1. Nonsensical overregulation that prevented creating fire breaks and doing brush clearing. 2. Bad governance at the state and local level that resulted in a shortage of water,' he wrote on X. \n\nBusinessman and mayoral candidate Rick Caruso also blasted local officials last week for failing to refill the water supplies despite knowing that strong winds which could whip up wildfires were on the way. \n\n'The (firefighters') hands have been tied. They can't fight a fire without water and the resources that are needed. Everybody knew these winds were coming,' Caruso told Fox 11.\n\n'The other question has to be, were all the things in place to try to mitigate the damage here?\n\n'The real issue to me here is two-fold. We've had decades to remove the brush in these hills that spreads so quickly, and the second is, we've got to have water.\n\n'My understanding is the reservoir was not refilled in time, in a timely manner to keep the hydrants going... this is basic stuff, this isn't high science here. \n\n'It's all about leadership and management that we're seeing a failure of, and all of these residents are paying the ultimate price for that.' \n\nAs of Monday, more than 100,000 people signed a petition calling on Newsom to resign from his position as the fires destroyed more than 62 square miles across the most affluent neighborhoods of LA, with A-list celebrity homes and restaurant hotspots among the 12,300 structures wiped out.\n\nThe blazes have also taken the lives of at least 24 people, though officials have warned that the fatality total is likely to climb, with at least 16 people still missing and 150,000 forced to evacuate from their homes. \n\nLocal fire departments have also warned that harsher winds and more fire would prevent those under mandatory evacuation orders from returning home to assess the damage.\n\n'Life-threatening winds and dangerously low humidity are forecast for much of Southern California, creating a significant risk of rapid fire spread,' the California fire service (CalFire) said in a statement. 'The winds will cause increased fire activity.","summary":"Jack Hibbs, the founding pastor of Calvary Chapel Chino Hills, has gone viral for his sermon hitting out at the state's Democratic leadership as deadly wildfires continue to spread across Los Angeles","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-14280511/California-pastor-Jack-Hibbs-sermon-fires-Gavin-Newsom-Karen-Bass.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/01/13/23/94056461-0-image-a-15_1736811158491.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-01-13 23:36:16","author":"Editor,Melissa Koenig","authors":["Editor","Melissa Koenig"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.869},{"id":280238432,"title":"Jake Sullivan: America Became Safer and Better Off Under Biden","text":"Outgoing National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan lauded the Biden administration’s policies on Sunday, saying the United States is “safer” and “better off” than it was four years ago.\n\nReflecting the administration’s performance days before President-elect Donald Trump’s inauguration, Sullivan said U.S. alliances have become stronger in the past four years while its adversaries grew weaker.\n\nSullivan said the incoming Trump administration will inherit a safer and stronger America.\n\n“The American people are safer, and the country is better off than we were four years ago, and we’re handing all that off to the next team, as well as having the engines of American power humming: our economy, our technology, our defense industrial base, our supply chains,” Sullivan said.\n\n“So the United States is in a stronger, more secure position, and our competitors and adversaries are weaker and under pressure.”\n\nSullivan defended the Afghan withdrawal, saying “Americans would be fighting and dying” if they remained in the Asian country, which is now under Taliban control. “Russia would have more leverage over us; we would be less able to respond to the major strategic challenges we face,” he said.\n\nOn the likelihood of reaching a cease-fire and hostage deal between Israel and Hamas before Trump’s inauguration on Jan. 20, the outgoing national security adviser said, “We are very, very close, and yet being very close still means we’re far because until you actually get across the finish line, we’re not there.”\n\nNegotiators are currently discussing a phased cease-fire, with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu signaling that he is committed only to a first phase, a partial hostage release in exchange for a weeks-long halt in fighting.\n\nHamas has demanded a complete Israeli withdrawal from the Gaza Strip. Netanyahu’s government has insisted on retaining the Philadelphi Corridor, along the Gaza–Egypt border, and the Netzarim Corridor, which cuts the Gaza Strip in two, as a necessary condition in order to prevent arms smuggling and to impede Hamas’s movement throughout Gaza.\n\nSullivan said White House Coordinator for the Middle East and North Africa Brett McGurk is negotiating the “final details” with mediators in Doha, and that the team is “determined to use every day we have in office to get this done.”\n\nHe said it’s possible that a deal can be agreed on before Jan. 20, and it’s also possible that “Hamas in particular” will collapse the deal again.\n\nTrump’s designated Mideast envoy, Steve Witkoff, who recently met with Netanyahu, has said he hopes an agreement can be reached before the inauguration.\n\nThe president-elect has also warned that “all hell will break out” if Hamas doesn’t release the remaining hostages before he returns to the White House.\n\nAlso on Sunday, Rep. Mike Waltz (R-Fla.), Trump’s incoming national security adviser, said the administration will “confront the evolving challenges of today’s world and hold firm against those who would harm our way of life.”\n\n“America’s greatest strength is its booming economy and our energy dominance, and those tools will keep us out of wars and allow us to once again lead from a position of strength,” he said, adding that he “fully believe[s] that America’s best days are still ahead.”","summary":"The outgoing national security adviser said U.S. alliances have grown stronger as its adversaries weakened.","url":"https://www.theepochtimes.com/us/jake-sullivan-america-became-safer-and-better-off-under-biden-5791078","image":"https://img.theepochtimes.com/assets/uploads/2025/01/13/id5791247-Jake-Sullivan-300x180.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-01-13 23:35:59","author":"Lily Zhou","authors":["Lily Zhou"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.184},{"id":280237120,"title":"Federal judge clears way for release of Jack Smith’s report on Trump election interference case | Reporter Replay","text":"New York Post\n\n See All Videos \n\n Recommended \n\n Trump supporters are pumped up for election day \n\n Jewel thieves in terrible disguises walk off with $1.7M in Nashville heist \n\n Huge 7-foot shark leaps onto boat in South Korea \n\n Terrified swimmer attacked by capybara while lounging in lake \n\n Woman burns herself by throwing boiling water into freezing air \n\n Cockpit POV video shows 2 planes colliding — both ‘likely totaled’ \n\n Best Halloween costumes on morning talk shows 2024: ‘Today,’ ‘LIVE with Kelly and Mark’ and more \n\n Big Mac attack — video shows enraged McDonald’s customer destroy checkout kiosk \n\n Toddler ruins gender reveal — it’s girl no. 4 for this dad \n\n Fisherman catches 224-pound grouper — and sells it for $1,760 \n\nFederal judge clears way for release of Jack Smith’s report on Trump election interference case | Reporter Replay\n\nJanuary 13, 2025 | 6:31pm\n\nA federal judge ruled Monday that the Justice Department may release a report by former special counsel Jack Smith detailing his election interference case against President-elect Donald Trump.

Their best known hit, “Y.M.C.A.,” is widely considered a gay anthem — and became a staple of Trump’s rallies in the last election, along with their hit “Macho Man.”\n\nThe American disco group is set to perform at one of Trump’s inaugural balls and a rally he’s holding in Washington the day before he’s sworn in.\n\n“We know this won’t make some of you happy to hear however we believe that music is to be performed without regard to politics,” the band said in a post on its Facebook page Monday. “Our song Y.M.C.A. is a global anthem that hopefully helps bring the country together after a tumultuous and divided campaign where our preferred candidate lost. Therefore, we believe it’s now time to bring the country together with music which is why VILLAGE PEOPLE will be performing at various events as part of the 2025 Inauguration of Donald J. Trump.”\n\nOther inauguration ceremony performers will include two of the president-elect’s musical favorites, country singer Lee Greenwood and opera singer Christopher Macchio.\n\nThe pomp and spectacle that comes with the inauguration of a new president kicks off this weekend in Washington with a fireworks show at Trump’s golf club in Sterling, Virginia, a campaign-style rally in D.C., a visit to Arlington National Cemetery and glitzy dinners before the former president takes the oath to become the next president.\n\nTrump’s second inauguration is expected to be a much different affair than the last time America got a new president. Trump, who refused to accept his 2020 loss, did not attend Democratic President Joe Biden’s swearing-in ceremony at the Capitol, where there were still visible reminders of the violent Jan. 6, 2021 siege on the building by Trump’s supporters.\n\nThe committee planning Trump’s inaugural ceremonies released a schedule Monday of four days of events centered around the Jan. 20th swearing-in ceremony, which Biden is planning to attend.\n\n“President Trump is dedicated to uniting the country through the strength, security, and opportunity of his America First agenda,” Steve Witkoff and Kelly Loeffler, the co-chairs of the inaugural committee, said in a statement.\n\nWitkoff is Trump’s incoming Middle East envoy and Loeffler is a former Georgia senator who is Trump’s pick to run the Small Business Administration.\n\n“The 2025 inaugural celebrations will reflect President-elect Trump’s historic return to the White House and the American people’s decisive vote to Make America Great Again,” Witkoff and Loeffler said.\n\nOn Saturday, Trump is scheduled to attend a reception and fireworks display at his Trump National Golf Club in Sterling, Virginia. Separately, Vice President-elect JD Vance will attend a reception for the incoming Cabinet members and host a dinner. On Sunday, the president-elect is to participate in a wreath-laying ceremony at Arlington National Cemetery and then hold a campaign-style “MAGA Victory” rally at Capital One Arena in downtown Washington. The Village People are scheduled to perform at the rally.\n\nTh Republican’s Inauguration Day plans include tea at the White House, the swearing-in ceremony at the Capitol, a congressional luncheon, a parade on Pennsylvania Avenue and a trio of balls.\n\nThe inaugural balls include a Commander in Chief Ball focused on military service members, a Liberty Inaugural Ball geared toward Trump supporters that will feature a Village People performance, and the Starlight Ball, focused on high-dollar donors. Trump is scheduled to speak at all three balls.\n\nThe presidential parade after Trump is sworn in will include about 7,500 participants including first responders, veterans groups and school marching bands. First responders from Butler County, Pennsylvania, where Trump survived an assassination attempt, will be among the groups participating.\n\nIncoming first lady Melania Trump will join tea with the Bidens. In 2021, the Trumps did not invite the Bidens for a tea before Biden’s inauguration, instead leaving town before the next president was sworn in. In November, when Joe Biden invited President-elect Trump to the White House, Melania Trump chose to skip the visit.\n\nTuesday, Trump’s first full day as the 47th president, will include a National Prayer Service in the morning. Greenwood will perform as Trump walks out to take the oath, according to Trump’s inaugural committee. Macchio is Trump’s choice to perform the National Anthem at the end of the program.\n\nMacchio performed at the Republican National Convention in July, at Trump’s return rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, in October after his first rally there was marred by an assassination attempt, and during his Madison Square Garden rally that drew blowback for crude and racist jokes from some speakers.\n\nThe invocation is scheduled to be delivered by Franklin Graham, son of the late pastor Billy Graham, and New York Cardinal Timothy Dolan.\n\nTrump’s first inauguration in 2017 featured performances from the Rockettes, the Mormon Tabernacle Choir and 16-year-old “America’s Got Talent” singer Jackie Evancho.\n\nBeyond the official events that Trump is scheduled to attend, there are a number of satellite and unofficial events being held in Washington surrounding the inauguration where supporters are expected to celebrate and toast the incoming president. Vance is scheduled to attend a ball hosted by the conservative group Turning Point USA. Other groups have announced plans for a Coronation Ball, the All American Ball, the Crypto Ball, and the Legacy of Freedom Ball, which is hosted by the Black Conservative Federation.\n\nCelebrities expected to attend the Legacy of Freedom Ball on Sunday include rappers Waka Flocka and Fivio Foreign, YouTube personality Anton Daniels, former NFL player Antonio Brown, podcasters and YouTubers The Cartier Family.","summary":"NEW YORK (AP) — Country music star Carrie Underwood will perform “America the Beautiful” at Donald Trump’s inauguration next week and the 1970s hitmakers Village People will perform at two inaugural events.

Greg Abbott has caused outrage after he ordered all U.S. flags in his state to be flown at full-staff on Donald Trump's Inauguration Day, RadarOnline.com has learned.\n\nFlags throughout the country have been at half-staff in honor of former President Jimmy Carter.According to protocol, all U.S. flags must fly at half-staff for 30 days after the death of a president. Carter died Dec. 29.\n\nThe U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs states that the flag must be \"half-staff for 30 days at all federal buildings, grounds, and naval vessels throughout the United States and its territories and possessions after the death of the president or a former president.\"\n\nThat means flags are supposed to be lowered until January 28th - days after Trump's second inauguration.\n\nHowever, Abbot has skirted that order and instead is mandating all flags at the Texas Capitol and at state buildings fly high on Jan. 20.The decision was met with instant wrath online, where many slammed Abbott as being rude and uncaring to the fallen Carter.\n\nOne person tweeted: \"Texas Gov. Greg Abbott's decision to raise flags on Inauguration Day isn't only a sign of disrespect to President Carter's family, but our entire nation.\"\n\nAnother person slammed: \"Not surprising Greg Abbott still continues to prove he is a POS,\" while a third called the governor \"utter trash.\"\n\nOne person cried out: \"Texas Governor Greg Abbott has no respect for former President Jimmy Carter, no respect for the federal government, and definitely no respect for the traditions of this great nation.\"\n\nWhile one angry objector tweeted in all-caps: \"ABBOTT IS THE EPITOME OF DISRESPECT FOR OUR FALLEN PRESIDENT.

Harry Truman's death in December 1972 left flags at half-staff when President Richard Nixon was sworn in for his second term in January 1973.\n\nTrump concluded by seeming to hint that he may try to let the flags fly high: \"Nobody wants to see this, and no American can be happy about it. Let’s see how it plays out. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!\"The timing of Carter's passing, and subsequent flag-lowering, was not lost on Democratic supporters, who flooded X to point out the coincidence.\n\nOne person tweeted: \"I'm so sad for this great man's passing but this is going to p--- off the orange clown so much, and I've convinced myself this was Jimmy's plan the whole time.\"\n\nAnother stated: \"Jimmy Carter left one last parting gift for Trump after his death.\"\n\nWhile a third boasted: \"A nice FU Trump from President Jimmy Carter!\"","summary":"Texas Gov.

Fast-evolving AI technology enables computers to produce novels, make scientific research breakthroughs, automate driving and foster a range of other transformations that could reshape economies and warfare.\n\nRaimondo said the framework “is designed to safeguard the most advanced AI technology and ensure that it stays out of the hands of our foreign adversaries but also enabling the broad diffusion and sharing of the benefits with partner countries.”\n\nWhile the Biden administration had already restricted exports to adversaries such as China and Russia, some of those controls had loopholes and the new rule would set limits on a much broader group of countries. Data centers built in the Middle East and Southeast Asia are of particular concern to U.S. officials, said Ed Mills, an analyst at Raymond James.\n\n“Chinese companies have used those data centers to build AI models with technology that they would not be able to import to China itself,” Mills said.\n\nA tech industry group, the Information Technology Industry Council, warned Raimondo in a letter last week that a hastily implemented new rule from the Democratic administration could fragment global supply chains and put U.S. companies at a disadvantage. Another group, the Semiconductor Industry Association, said Monday it was disappointed that the policy was being “rushed out the door” before a presidential transition.\n\n“The new rule risks causing unintended and lasting damage to America’s economy and global competitiveness in semiconductors and AI by ceding strategic markets to our competitors,” said SIA President and CEO John Neuffer.\n\nOne industry executive, who is familiar with the framework and insisted on anonymity to discuss it, said the proposed restrictions would limit access to chips already used for video games, despite claims made otherwise by the government. The executive said it would also limit which companies could build data centers abroad.\n\nAmong those expected to be affected was the China-based data center developer GDS Holdings. Its stock dropped more than 18% Monday.\n\nBecause the framework includes a 120-day comment period, the incoming Republican administration could ultimately determine the rules for the sales abroad of advanced computer chips designed mostly by California companies like Nvidia and AMD.\n\nGovernment officials said they felt the need to act quickly in hopes of preserving what is perceived to be America’s six- to 18-month advantage on AI over rivals such as China, a head start that could easily erode if competitors were able to stockpile the chips and make further gains.\n\nNed Finkle, vice president of external affairs at Nvidia, said in a statement that the prior Trump administration had helped create the foundation for AI’s development and that the proposed framework would hurt innovation without achieving the stated national security goals.\n\n“While cloaked in the guise of an ‘anti-China’ measure, these rules would do nothing to enhance U.S. security,” he said. “The new rules would control technology worldwide, including technology that is already widely available in mainstream gaming PCs and consumer hardware.”\n\nUnder the framework, roughly 20 key allies and partners would face no restrictions on accessing chips, but other countries would face caps on the chips they could import, according to a fact sheet provided by the White House.\n\nThe allies without restrictions include Australia, Belgium, Canada, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Japan, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, South Korea, Spain, Sweden, Taiwan and the United Kingdom. But the limits to other countries within the European Union raised objections from EU officials Monday who said selling advanced AI chips to EU members represents an economic opportunity for the U.S. and “not a security risk.”\n\nSullivan stressed that the framework would ensure that the most cutting-edge aspects of AI would be developed within the United States and with its closest allies, instead of possibly getting offshored such as the battery and renewable energy sectors.\n\nUsers outside of these close allies could purchase up to 50,000 graphics processing units per country. There would also be government-to-government deals which could bump up the cap to 100,000 if their renewable energy and technological security goals are aligned with the United States.\n\nInstitutions in certain countries could also apply for a legal status that would let them purchase up to 320,000 advanced graphics processing units over two years. Still, there would be limits as to how much AI computational capacity could be placed abroad by companies and other institutions.\n\nAlso, computer chip orders equivalent to 1,700 advanced graphics processing units would not need a license to import or count against the national chip cap, among the other standards set by the framework. The exception for the 1,700 graphics processing units would likely help to meet the orders for universities and medical institutions, as opposed to data centers.\n\nThe new rules are not expected to hinder the AI-driven data center expansion plans of leading cloud computing providers such as Amazon, Google and Microsoft because of exemptions for trusted companies seeking large clusters of advanced AI chips.\n\n“We’re confident we can comply fully with this rule’s high security standards and meet the technology needs of countries and customers around the world that rely on us,” said Brad Smith, Microsoft’s president, in a statement Monday.\n\nMicrosoft drew bipartisan scrutiny last year after it announced a $1.5 billion investment in a technology firm based in the United Arab Emirates and overseen by the country’s powerful national security adviser.\n\nBiden leaving the ultimate decision to Trump will force the incoming administration to clarify how tough it will be in countering China’s AI ambitions.\n\nWhile some Trump allies such as U.S. Sen Ted Cruz have already criticized the Biden approach as heavy-handed, Mills said it fits into a broader U.S.-China trade policy that Trump himself began eight years ago.\n\n“This really started under Trump, continued under Biden, and the Biden team advanced a lot of things, but they weren’t quite done with some stuff,” Mills said. “It seems as if they’ve dropped a hot potato into the Trump administration’s lap and almost dared them to walk it back.”\n\n-- Josh Boak and Matt O’Brien, The Associated Press","summary":"Biden officials made clear it would be up to the incoming Trump administration to follow through with or drop the new rules.","url":"https://www.oregonlive.com/business/2025/01/bidens-administration-proposes-new-restrictions-on-exporting-ai-chips.html","image":"https://www.oregonlive.com/resizer/v2/TXIHIVD3KNBFLO3MAADNB5M7BE.jpg?auth=12584dfa2663083885f812d9d10b32276d0ab3d05ab574442c30b6d7eadfb732&width=1280&quality=90","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-01-13 23:29:17","author":"The Associated Press","authors":["The Associated Press"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.223},{"id":280241954,"title":"Sen. Liz Warren lays out more than 100 questions she wants Pete Hegseth to answer during confirmation hearing","text":"Sen. Elizabeth Warren sent a letter to Pete Hegseth, President-elect Donald Trump's nominee for Defense Secretary, laying out a bevy of accusations and about 100 questions that she expects him to answer at his confirmation hearing on Tuesday. Warren, the top Democrat on the Senate Armed Services Subcommittee on Personnel, penned the 33-page letter last week to Hegseth. It describes why she thinks he is \"unfit\" to serve, referring to him at one point in the letter as \"an insider threat\" due to a tattoo Hegseth has that Warren claims is tied to \"right-wing extremism.\" \"Your confirmation as Secretary of Defense would be detrimental to our national security and disrespect a diverse array of servicemembers who are willing to sacrifice for our country,\" Warren writes in the letter. \"I am deeply concerned by the many ways in which your behavior and rhetoric indicates that you are unfit to lead the Department of Defense.\" ARE PETE HEGSETH'S TATTOOS SYMBOLS OF ‘CHRISTIAN NATIONALISM?’ The letter starts off with accusations against Hegseth that include claims of financial mismanagement during his work operating two nonprofits, and accusations of heavy drinking and sexual assault. The Massachusetts Democrat accused Hegseth of \"gross mismanagement\" in running up debt and using business funds at the nonprofits he ran for personal expenses. She cited past colleagues of Hegseth's who claimed to be privy to what took place. Warren also claimed in her letter that some of Hegseth's past colleagues had shared he may potentially have a drinking problem, citing \"at least 11 separate incidents in which [Hegseth has] been described as drinking excessively or inappropriately in public.\" Warren asks in the letter if Hegseth would resign if he were to be caught drinking again. NEW GOP SENATOR TEARS INTO DEMS ‘SEEKING TO DELAY’ PETE HEGSETH DOD CONFIRMATION Warren also went after Hegseth's policy positions in the letter, several of which were made during media appearances and in books. Warren slammed Hegseth for previous comments about women in the military, including remarks he made that only men should be allowed in combat roles. Warren questioned Hegseth about other aspects of women in the military as well, including whether he thinks single women in the military should have access to birth control. Hegseth, an advocate for getting rid of diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) programs in the military, was slammed by Warren in her letter for calling for the firing of \"any general, admiral, whatever, that was involved in any of the DEI woke s--t,\" during a podcast interview in November. Warren added that in addition to potentially firing Defense Department officials promoting DEI, she also detailed fears about Hegseth's willingness to help aid Trump in going after his political opponents. In one of Warren's questions, she requested that Hegseth share his thoughts on the 2020 election and whether he believes Trump won, or lost fairly. At one point in the letter, Warren highlighted that Hegseth had been removed from President Joe Biden's inauguration in 2021 because of concerns he was \"an insider threat\" following reports that his tattoo with the words \"Deus Vult,\" was allegedly a \"Christian expression associated with right-wing extremism.\" AMERICAN HEROES MAKE POWERFUL MOVE AHEAD OF HEARING FOR TRUMP'S PENTAGON PICK Other sections seek to harp on Hegseth's alleged unwillingness to work with allies, including those within the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, which Warren suggested Hegseth will not adequately support considering his \"skepticism\" over aiding Ukraine in its fight against Russia. Warren devoted an entire line of questioning to whether Hegseth will \"undermine\" veterans' benefits, and questioned what Hegseth might do to the Department of Defense Education Activity, the part of the agency that educates troops' children. In a statement to Fox News Digital, Trump Transition spokesperson Bran Hughes said that Hegseth \"looks forward to answering Senators' questions and detailing his many qualifications at his hearing tomorrow.\" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP \"Senator Warren’s letter to Pete Hegseth is exactly what the American voters rejected on November 5,\" Hughes said. \"Instead of focusing on ‘woke’ policies that have weakened our national defense, the voters gave a mandate to rebuild our military, and that’s exactly what a reform-minded Secretary of Defense like Pete Hegseth will do. Senator Warren’s letter proves why ideologically driven college professors have no place driving their social agenda at the Department of Defense.\" Efforts to reach Warren for comment for purposes of this story were unsuccessful.","summary":"Sen.
