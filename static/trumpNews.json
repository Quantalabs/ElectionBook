CLOiD is programed to work...\nmorelessToggle full description view\n\nFridges that suggest recipes for dinner based on what’s left on the shelves, an “ultrasonic” chef’s knife that cuts through hard potatoes like warm butter, a toothbrush that “smells” diseases, a furry “bag charm” that startles pedestrians and a robot cat that cools down your hot coffee so you don't have too.\nThese are some of the new inventions at CES, the world’s largest technology fair, which has just kicked off in Las Vegas. \nAmazing inventions or utter nonsense no one needs? You decide with your hard earned dollars. \n\nnews.com.au\nLego shows off its biggest update in 50 years\n\nmorelessToggle full description view\n\nCES features huge names from Samsung to LG, Sony to Lego, Hisense to ASUS. \nNews.com.au is on the ground in Sin City and news.com.au has taken a look at some of the great – and maybe some of the questionable – new inventions. \nFridge that tells you what to eat \nWe’ve all opened the fridge door to see the somewhat sparse interior and come up wanting on what to have for dinner. \nBoth Samsung and LG believe they have solved this problem, however, with the latest iterations of their high end fridges: Samsung’s Bespoke AI refrigerator and the LG Signature.\nBoth work on a similar principle. A camera inside the fridge can recognise thousands of different food items and products. Samsung’s can even recognise how many of a particular item are stored inside – remove one of three tomatoes and it will know just two are left. \n\nAI can recognise what items you buy frequently and urge you to pick up or order more in if you are running low. Or it can scan the fridge contents and find a recipe online that it then projects onto a screen on the fridge door. That recipe might only include what you have on the shelves or it could suggest you buy, say milk and cheese, to complete the dinner time creation. \nNeither AI fridge is available in Australia, for now. \n\nLG Signature fridges feature AI which can suggest recipes based on what’s on the shelves. Picture: LG.\nDiabetes sniffing toothbrush\nFrench firm Y-Brush is no stranger to CES, having showed off its curiously shaped brush in previous years which it claims is shaped to clean the mouth better and quicker. \nBut it claims the Y-Brush Halo does a whole lot more. \nUsing AI and gas sensors, it says it can analyse breath and detect over 300 health conditions — including early-stage diabetes, gum disease and liver disorders.\n\nThe Y-Brush Halo claims to be able to sniff out diseases.\nRobot bag charm that stares at passers-by\nMove over Labubu, Mirumi is in town. The makers saying Mirumi is the “charm robot that will steal your heart”.\nWe’ve all seen Labubus, the slightly demonic looking furry monsters that have become attached to bags everywhere. But what about a cuter Labubu that did stuff?\nThe Mirumi attaches to bags (or lamps, or just sits on tables, if you prefer) and reacts to sound or a stroke. Its bushy little head turns in the direction of the noise. And that’s about it. \n\nMirumi – a robot bag charm that \"steals your heart\".\nBut if you were on the train and a small teddy bear suddenly began staring at you it could be a shock. Or, as the company puts it: “its innocent gaze instantly lights up your heart and your day”.\n\nThe Seattle Ultrasonics chef‘s knife. (Photo by Patrick T. Fallon / AFP)\nWorld’s first “ultrasonic” chef knife\nCutting through rock hard potatoes or overripe tomatoes should be as easy as slicing through hot butter with the Seattle Ultrasonics chef‘s knife.\nThe knife itself is made of Japanese steel, so it’s good anyway. But when it’s turned on, the blade vibrates at up to 30,000 times per second. \nWith the pressure from the hand and the vibrations it’s less about chopping the ingredients for dinner and more about just lightly slicing through them. The makers claim it’s 50 per cent easier to chop. \nThe knife is available for preorder from $590. \n\nThe Nekojita FuFu blows on your hot coffee – so you don't have too.\nRobot cat that blows on your soup\nSolving a problem that seemingly no one knew needed to be solved, this cute silicon cat has one use: to cool hot liquids. \nThat’s right, if you can’t be bothered to blow on your own cuppa to cool it down, get a robot cat to do it instead.\nInside Nekojita FuFu – which means “cat’s tongue” – is a tiny fan. You turn it on via a button in its tail. Then attach it by its paws to the side of a mug or bowl of soup. Then, three, minutes later, the liquid should be cool enough to sip. \nOr, you know, you could just blow on it or let it cool down of its own accord. But it is cute.\nIt’s still under development but unlike a lot of very expensive gadgets at CES, the robot cat soup blower would only cost around $35. Which is a small price to pay for what could be the silliest invention at the show.\n\nThe Tombot hyper-realistic autonomous dog robot companion for the elderly and those unable to have a living pet dog. (Photo by Patrick T. Fallon / AFP)\nRobot pet dog for the elderly, vulnerable\nThe makers of Jennie, a robot dog from Tombot, have told news.com.au they had “many customers from Australia” on its waitlist.\nThey’re keen to get their hands on a plush Labrador puppy robot with big eyes and a wagging tail. If it’s petted or called, the robot’s head can move, it can open its mouth and even wag its ears. If it’s left alone Jennie can appear to fall asleep. \nIt’s undoubtedly adorable, but Tombot has a serious side. They call it a “fully interactive, robotic emotional support animal”.\n\nMore Coverage\nBiggest change to Lego in 50 years\nBenedict Brook at CES in Las Vegas\n‘World’s thinnest’ TV coming to Aus\nBenedict Brook at CES in Las Vegas\nTombot claims Jennie can aid people living with dementia, anxiety or loneliness. \nIt’s still under development but can be pre-ordered. \nThe writer travelled to CES with the assistance of LG. \n\nMore related stories\n\nTrump issues ultimatum, military not ready\nUS President Donald Trump has issued an ominous warning to one Middle Eastern nation as protests continue to explode.\n\nBiggest change to Lego in 50 years\nLego has made a huge announcement about its bricks, which the iconic toy maker says is as significant as the launch of the mini figure 50 years ago.\n\n‘Very angry’: Trump duped by Putin hoax\nThe US president was left furious after a call with tyrant Vladimir Putin, who complained that Ukraine had just tried to kill him.\n\nRegistration\n\nIn The Know Quiz\nNewsletters\nCompetitions\n\nWelcome to news.com.au\n\nCode of Conduct\n\nHelp and Support\n\nGeneral Feedback\nAdvertise with us\nStandards of Practice\n\nLicensing & Reprints\n\nOur News Network\n\nThe Daily Telegraph\n\nThe Courier Mail\n\nOur Partners\n\nrealestate.com.au\n\nCODE Sports\n\nA NOTE ABOUT RELEVANT ADVERTISING: We collect information about the content (including ads) you use across this site and use it to make both advertising and content more relevant to you on our network and other sites.

The protests that follow are leaderless and disorganised.\n\nIf they grow large enough, the regime reaches for its repressive toolbox: armed thugs, internet shutdowns, arrests. Order is restored but nothing is fixed, and the cycle repeats itself a few years later.\n\nOn December 28 electronics vendors in Tehran went on strike. Most of their wares are imported, and it is hard to buy and sell such goods with the currency in freefall.\n\nOther businesses joined the walkout, including shops in Tehran’s grand bazaar, a weathervane of politics. Protests spread outside the capital and are continuing. This is the widest unrest since 2022 — but still far smaller, and not yet a nationwide uprising. Most demonstrations draw just a few hundred people, concentrated in provincial cities so obscure that Tehranis might need a map to locate them.\n\nAcross the country factories, shops and government offices remain open.\n\nYet the regime looks more rattled than one might expect. Riot police and water cannons have been deployed on the backstreets of central Tehran. Plain-clothes goons disperse people before they can gather at intersections. Schools and universities have been closed on the pretext of air pollution, a tactic to forestall mass action.\n\nThe latest protests diverge from the old pattern in two ways. One is that the bankruptcy of the regime (literal and figurative) is in full view. Iran has endured a year of economic collapse, war and environmental crisis; its leaders have no solutions for these woes.\n\nThe other difference is the prospect of foreign intervention, either by Israel or America. After the American raid to seize Nicolás Maduro from Venezuela on January 3, many Iranians wondered if their country might be next in Donald Trump’s crosshairs.\n\nThe protests have drawn on anger within a constituency the regime long regarded as its own: jobless young men. The state has no answer to their demands.\n\nIn 2022 it defused months of unrest over social restrictions by loosening enforcement of the mandatory veil for women, withdrawing the morality police from the streets and letting musicians and performers take over public spaces. Iran’s economic and environmental crises offer no such quick fixes.\n\n“I can’t do anything,” admitted the president, Masoud Pezeshkian, on the eve of the protests.\n\nThe rial is crashing, trading at an all-time low near 1.5m to the US dollar. It has lost 45 per cent of its value in the past year and 98 per cent in the past decade. Prices of staples have soared beyond reach.\n\nMr Pezeshkian’s main attempt at economic reform, which began earlier this month, is to scrap a preferential exchange rate for imports of essential goods and use the money to send monthly cash transfers to Iranians worth 10m rials per person.\n\nIn principle this is a fine idea: direct payments to the poor are preferable to supply-side subsidies, which are prone to corruption. But the sum in question is worth less than $US8, barely enough for a bag of rice or a jug of cooking oil.\n\nUnifying the exchange rates will also fuel inflation, already above 40 per cent.\n\nFatemeh Mohajerani, a government spokeswoman, acknowledged that it will lead to “significant” price increases for chicken, eggs and other staples.\n\nIf the government cannot reform its way out of trouble, repression is backfiring too.\n\nFootage of security forces raiding hospitals to arrest wounded protesters has enraged the public. Some demonstrators have torched police stations in attempts to free prisoners. The religious ideology that once underpinned the system looks spent.\n\nMeanwhile, a fractured opposition seems to be coalescing around an unlikely figure: the exiled son of the shah overthrown in 1979. Monarchism still repels many.\n\nBut Iranians who dismissed Reza Pahlavi as a joke are suddenly taking the 65-year-old more seriously.\n\nLooming in the background is the threat of another war. Israel carried out 12 days of air strikes in Iran last summer. Benjamin Netanyahu, its prime minister, seems keen on a second round, in part because the Iranian regime is trying to rebuild its ballistic-missile program.\n\nA possible war was on the agenda when Mr Netanyahu visited Mr Trump at Mar-a-Lago on December 29.\n\nOn January 2 Mr Trump made his own threats, warning Iran not to kill peaceful protesters.\n\n“America will come to their rescue,” he wrote on social media. “We are locked and loaded and ready to go.”\n\nIt was unclear what he had in mind: a symbolic show of force? Or a more sustained campaign against Iran’s security forces?\n\nThe next day another possibility arose, when American commandos swooped into Venezuela. That is not to say America is about to try a similar raid to nab Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, the 86-year-old supreme leader.\n\nThe last time it attempted an incursion into the Iranian capital was in 1980, during the hostage crisis; it ended ignominiously, with helicopters wrecked in the desert and eight American soldiers dead.\n\nBut Mr Maduro’s swift downfall has fuelled a running debate within Iran’s regime.\n\nMany officials who were waiting for Mr Khamenei’s death to bring change now want it to come sooner.\n\n“Things are bad enough for the regime to be looking for scapegoats,” says an Iranian commentator in exile.\n\nSome are considering a Venezuelan-style solution: sacrificing the supreme leader to save the system and stave off chaos. Saeed Laylaz, an economist favoured by the regime, urged the ayatollah to step aside in favour of a “Bonaparte”.\n\nHe even discussed one: Mohammad Bagher Qalibaf, the parliamentary speaker and former commander of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), who observers say briefly took charge when Mr Khamenei went into hiding during the war. Mr Pahlavi’s name has also been floated, perhaps to be installed with the IRGC’s blessing.\n\nMr Khamenei may yet choose a different end.\n\nVast billboards looming over central Tehran show coffins draped with American and Israeli flags. Advisers threaten regional escalation, with strikes on American bases and Israeli cities if foreign attacks resume.\n\nLeaders in the Arab Gulf states are nervous that they may be targeted too.\n\nPerhaps Mr Khamenei’s aides hope to again rally the home front, as they briefly did during the June war. Either way, his 37th year as supreme leader could yet prove as climactic as that of the last shah—toppled after 37 years on the throne.","summary":"Ayatollah Khamenei’s 37th year as supreme leader could yet prove as climactic as that of the last shah — toppled after 37 years on the throne. ","url":"https://thewest.com.au/business/the-economist/the-economist-facing-protests-at-home-and-threats-abroad-the-iranian-regime-looks-rattled-c-21243544","image":"https://images.thewest.com.au/publication/C-21243544/e74127bc8bb0790c4f3635ed2bb32a3b41b897bd-16x9-x0y104w2200h1238.jpg?imwidth=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-08 01:14:40","author":"The Economistth","authors":["The Economistth"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"au","sentiment":-0.256},{"id":391744652,"title":"Trump orders flags to half-staff in honor of ‘true American patriot’ CA Congressman Doug LaMalfa","text":"In honor of a “true American patriot,” President Donald Trump ordered flags be flown at half-staff across the country until Wednesday evening for the late California Congressman Doug LaMalfa. \n\n“Doug will be dearly missed,” Trump wrote on Truth Social. \n\nLaMalfa, who represented the Golden State’s 1st Congressional District since 2013, died suddenly on Tuesday morning. \n\n“Early this morning Congressman Doug LaMalfa returned home to the Lord. He leaves a lasting legacy of servant leadership [and] kindness to the North State,” a statement from LaMalfa’s chief of staff, Mark Spannagel, said.\n\nWhile LaMalfa’s death is under investigation, a friend of the 65-year-old told Action News that the congressman suffered from a local aortic aneurysm and died during surgery at Enloe Health in Chico.\n\nLaMalfa was a fourth generation rice farmer and business owner who focused on addressing rural issues.\n\nSo what happens next? \n\nCalifornia Governor Gavin Newsom must call for a special election within 14 calendar days of the vacancy. The election has to take place on a Tuesday between 126 days and 140 days following the proclamation, according to state law. \n\nPaul Mitchell, a state elections expert who helped draw the Prop 50 redistricting map, noted on social media that the special election for LaMalfa will still use the old map.\n\n“In case of a vacancy after a redistricting, but before those new lines are used, the replacement election is held in the OLD lines,” Mitchell said. \n\nUnder the new map, LaMalfa’s district that covered from the Oregon border down to near the state Capitol in Sacramento, will stretch west and gain more Democratic voters. \n\nThe 2026 midterms will use the voter-approved Prop 50 redistricting map that aims to send more Democrats to Washington.","summary":"In honor of a \"true American patriot,\" President Donald Trump ordered flags be flown at half-staff across the country for the late California Congressman Doug LaMalfa.","url":"https://nypost.com/2026/01/07/us-news/trump-orders-flags-flown-at-half-staff-in-honor-of-doug-lamalfa/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2026/01/118459180.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/P3TrzBRP-RyIcpnTz.mp4","publish_date":"2026-01-08 01:06:09","author":"Benjamin Brown","authors":["Benjamin Brown"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"zm","sentiment":0.074},{"id":391758948,"title":"Abby McCloskey: The GOP’s identity crisis is deepening by the day","text":"This might be Republicans’ last big year to get things done for a while. President Donald Trump is in the second year of his second term — his last before reaching lame duck status. His party is unlikely to hold Congress after the midterms if history is any indication.\n\nWhat do Republicans want? As 2026 begins, I’m not sure they know. Last year was the big push: the DOGE cuts; the reconciliation bill; tax relief; deportations; tariffs; securing the southern border. It was a four-year term shoved into one.\n\nIt almost feels too soon to ask, “What now?” But we are in a moment in history where time is speeding up, not slowing down, as the capture of Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro and his wife underscores. But what about policy on the home front?\n\nI called some Washington insiders for their take. A long-time operative: “They want to win the House again in 2026. They just don’t know how to keep it.” A former Hill chief: “The GOP are excited for a tax season when people get bigger refunds and Trump Accounts start being seeded.”\n\nIn other words, 2026 is about the tailwind from the 2025 whirlwind. But is it blowing in the right direction?\n\nMore than three-quarters of Americans rang in the New Year thinking that the country is going in the wrong direction, according to Gallup. Approval for President Trump is at 36%. Approval for Congress fell to 17%, the lowest in over a decade. (Recall that Trump won the popular vote a mere 14 months back; the party punch didn’t taste as good as it looked.)\n\nTime is ticking for the GOP to pass landmark legislation, and with it, their long-shot dream of preserving their Washington trifecta. Certainly, there’s interest in the MAGA base in advancing an affordability agenda and rightfully so, given that prices for housing, education and healthcare remain high. The tax rebates in April will help. Trump Accounts, too, are something new and fully branded to the GOP’s benefit.\n\nBut food prices have gone up partly because of President Trump’s tariffs. And much of the affordability stress is also around healthcare. Reducing healthcare costs has been a thorn in the GOP’s side ever since the party failed to come up with a convincing alternative to the Affordable Care Act a decade ago.\n\nPerhaps there will be a surge in bipartisanship around supporting working Americans. I am usually bullish on bipartisanship, but that’s because it tends to represent prudence and compromise. If there is bipartisanship in 2026, it seems more likely that it will represent a uniting of extremes — like the photo op of New York City Mayor Zohran Mamdani and Trump in the Oval Office in November. Or the idea floating around policy circles to turn tariff revenue into stimulus checks, which is about as progressive as it gets.\n\nBut it’s my sense that it’s hard to have a sustained agenda in the midst of an identity crisis, which the GOP is most certainly in.\n\nThe transition from free-market orthodoxy and limited government to populism and protectionism has been anything but smooth or complete. Contradictions in the modern GOP include: extolling American patriotism while vilifying the civil service; obsessing over military “lethality” while disparaging allies; claiming to be pro-growth while restricting capital and labor; arguing against the “Deep State” while mandating MAGA loyalty pledges; decrying the deficit while passing unfunded spending bills; embracing social conservatism while distancing itself from pro-life causes. And the latest: military interventionism versus America first and only.\n\nThis all will take years to sort out. In the interim, there are other areas of low-hanging policy fruit that the GOP could advance this year.\n\nFor example, there’s no question that America’s children are not healthy or well. Food dyes and Tylenol are red herrings. The party should create a National Commission on Children and Families that looks at — among other things — how we are going to protect children in the age of social media and artificial intelligence. That would be forward-looking and legacy-building, like President Ronald Reagan’s war on drugs or President Lyndon Johnson’s war on poverty.\n\nChase affordability the conservative way: Declare the Southern border secure (it is) and the world at attention (they are) and relax the erratic restraints on goods and labor that are anything but conservative. Usher in regulatory relief. Get the schools performing again. Take a page out of the second-term Reagan playbook and use this as a chance for some budget control; limit the federal debt to a percentage of GDP. Future generations will say thank you.\n\nAnd it’s worth saying again what has been said many times before: America is a big, diverse country. We are split almost down the middle politically. Popular mandates are slim and short-lived, as polling confirms. Shouting about the radical left or Bidenomics is not a legacy, it’s a reaction.\n\nOver the last decade, no Democrat has held more political power than Trump does now. So please, stop disparaging previous presidents. Stop pitting Americans against each other. The political leaders who have risen above America’s deepest divisions are the ones we honor.\n\n2026 is our exceptional country’s 250th anniversary. There’s no better time for the GOP to make a change in direction.\n\nAbby McCloskey is a columnist, podcast host, and consultant.

Colombia is considered the epicenter of the world’s cocaine trade.\n\nTrump began his monthslong pressure campaign on Maduro by ordering dozens of lethal strikes on alleged drug smuggling boats launched from Venezuela in the Caribbean. He eventually expanded the operations to also target suspected vessels in the eastern Pacific that came from Colombia.\n\nThe U.S. in September added Colombia, the top recipient of American assistance in the region, to a list of nations failing to cooperate in the drug war for the first time in almost 30 years. The designation led to a slashing of U.S. assistance to the country.\n\n“He has cocaine mills and cocaine factories,” Trump said of Prieto on Sunday. “He’s not going to be doing it.”","url":"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/trump-colombia-president-invite_n_695efdf8e4b05f1e1aab8994?origin=home-politics-feed-unit","image":"https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/695efe762500008e044a0d47.jpeg?cache=Li3pxo50Qi&ops=1778_1000","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-08 00:48:01","author":null,"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"ca","sentiment":-0.02},{"id":391749386,"title":"Japan Shares Open Lower After Trump Comments on Venezuelan Crude","text":"Japan Shares Open Lower After Trump Comments on Venezuelan CrudeJapanese shares opened lower on Thursday, tracking Wall Street, amid growing geopolitical tensions and U.S. President Donald Trump's comments on Venezuelan oil.\nThe Nikkei 225 opened 192.15 points,...","url":"https://www.marketscreener.com/news/japan-shares-open-lower-after-trump-comments-on-venezuelan-crude-ce7e59dcd089ff23","image":"https://cdn.zonebourse.com/static/resize/0/0//images/reuters/2016-12-12T062127Z_1_LYNXMPECBB07E_RTROPTP_2_MARKETS-GLOBAL.JPG","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-08 00:47:12","author":null,"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"fr","sentiment":-0.69},{"id":391738836,"title":"Trump and Colombia's Petro hold phone call to discuss 'disagreements'","text":"BOGOTA, Jan 7 - U.S. President Donald Trump and Colombian President Gustavo Petro held a phone call on Wednesday afternoon where they discussed relations between the two countries, both men said, amid heightened tensions between Washington and Bogota.\n\nThis is the first phone call between the two presidents since Trump said on Sunday that a U.S. military operation focused on Colombia's government \"sounds good\" to him.\n\n\"It was a great honor to speak with the President of Colombia, Gustavo Petro, who called to explain the situation of drugs and other disagreements that we have had.

The Trump administration has carried out more than 30 strikes against suspected drug boats since September, in a campaign that has killed at least 110 people.

Her killing quickly drew a crowd of hundreds of angry protesters.\n\nHomeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, while visiting Texas, described the incident as an “act of domestic terrorism” carried out against ICE officers by a woman who “attempted to run them over and rammed them with her vehicle. An officer of ours acted quickly and defensively, shot, to protect himself and the people around him.”\n\nIn a social media post, President Donald Trump made similar accusations against the woman and defended ICE’s work.\n\nHours later, at an evening news conference in Minnesota, Ms., Noem didn’t back down, claiming the woman was part of a “mob of agitators.”\n\n“Any loss of life is a tragedy, and I think all of us can agree that in this situation, it was preventable,” she said, adding that the FBI would investigate.\n\nBut Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey blasted Noem’s characterization as “garbage” and criticized the federal deployment of more than 2,000 officers to the Twin Cities of Minneapolis and St. Paul as part of the immigration crackdown.\n\n“What they are doing is not to provide safety in America. What they are doing is causing chaos and distrust,” Mr. Frey said, calling on the immigration agents to leave. “They’re ripping families apart. They’re sowing chaos on our streets, and in this case, quite literally killing people.”\n\n“They are already trying to spin this as an action of self-defense,” the mayor said. He said that, having seen the video himself, that is false.\n\nMr. Frey said he had a message for ICE: Get out of Minneapolis.\n\nA shooting caught on video\n\nVideos taken by bystanders with different vantage points and posted to social media show an officer approaching an SUV stopped across the middle of the road, demanding the driver open the door and grabbing the handle. The Honda Pilot begins to pull forward and a different ICE officer standing in front of the vehicle pulls his weapon and immediately fires at least two shots into the vehicle at close range.\n\nIt was not clear from the videos if the vehicle made contact with the officer. The SUV then sped into two cars parked on a curb nearby before crashing to a stop. Witnesses screamed obscenities, expressing shock at what they’d seen.\n\nAfter the shooting, emergency medical technicians tried to administer aid to the woman.\n\n“She was driving away and they killed her,” said resident Lynette Reini-Grandell, who was outdoors recording video on her phone.\n\nThe shooting marked a dramatic escalation of the latest in a series of immigration enforcement operations in major cities under the Trump administration. The death of the Minneapolis driver, whose name wasn’t immediately released, was at least the fifth linked to immigration crackdowns.\n\nThe Twin Cities have been on edge since DHS announced Tuesday that it had launched the operation, which is at least partly tied to allegations of fraud involving Somali residents. Noem confirmed Wednesday that DHS had deployed more than 2,000 officers to the area and said they had already made “hundreds and hundreds” of arrests.\n\nA large throng of protesters gathered at the scene after the shooting, where they vented their anger at the local and federal officers who were there, including Gregory Bovino, a senior U.S. Customs and Border Patrol official who has been the face of crackdowns in Los Angeles, Chicago and elsewhere.\n\nIn a scene that hearkened back to the Los Angeles and Chicago crackdowns, bystanders heckled the officers, chanting “Shame! Shame! Shame!” and “ICE out of Minnesota,” and blew whistles that have become ubiquitous during the operations.\n\nGovernor calls for calm\n\nMinnesota Gov. Tim Walz said he’s prepared to deploy the National Guard if necessary. He said a family member of the driver was there to witness the killing, which he described as “predictable” and “avoidable.” He also said like many, he was outraged by the shooting, but he called on people to keep protests peaceful.\n\n“They want a show. We can’t give it to them. We cannot,” the governor said during a news conference. “If you protest and express your First Amendment rights, please do so peacefully, as you always do. We can’t give them what they want.”\n\nMinneapolis Police Chief Brian O’Hara briefly described the shooting to reporters but, unlike federal officials, gave no indication that the driver was trying to harm anyone. He said she had been shot in the head.\n\n“This woman was in her vehicle and was blocking the roadway on Portland Avenue. ... At some point a federal law enforcement officer approached her on foot and the vehicle began to drive off,” the chief said. “At least two shots were fired. The vehicle then crashed on the side of the roadway.”\n\nThere were calls on social media to prosecute the officer who shot the driver. Commissioner Bob Jacobson of the Minnesota Department of Public Safety said state authorities would investigate the shooting with federal authorities.\n\n“Keep in mind that this is an investigation that is also in its infancy. So any speculation about what has happened would be just that,” Jacobson told reporters.\n\nThe shooting happened in the district of Democratic Rep. Ilhan Omar, who called it “state violence,” not law enforcement.\n\nFor nearly a year, migrant rights advocates and neighborhood activists across the Twin Cities have been preparing to mobilize in the event of an immigration enforcement surge. From houses of worship to mobile home parks, they have set up very active online networks, scanned license plates for possible federal vehicles and bought whistles and other noisemaking devices to alert neighborhoods of any enforcement presence.","summary":"An Immigration and Customs Enforcement officer shot and killed a Minneapolis driver on Wednesday, stirring outcries from residents.

Colombia is considered the epicenter of the world’s cocaine trade.\n\nTrump began his monthslong pressure campaign on Maduro by ordering dozens of lethal strikes on alleged drug smuggling boats launched from Venezuela in the Caribbean. He eventually expanded the operations to also target suspected vessels in the eastern Pacific that came from Colombia.\n\nThe U.S. in September added Colombia, the top recipient of American assistance in the region, to a list of nations failing to cooperate in the drug war for the first time in almost 30 years. The designation led to a slashing of U.S. assistance to the country.\n\n“He has cocaine mills and cocaine factories,\" Trump said of Prieto on Sunday. \"He’s not going to be doing it.”\n\nWill Weissert, The Associated Press","url":"https://www.oakvillenews.org/world-news/trump-invites-colombian-president-to-white-house-days-after-threatening-it-with-military-strike-11710946","image":"https://www.vmcdn.ca/f/files/shared/feeds/cp/2026/01/8399f8d82457bc4440cd0a0d1cf20719138f5307b06b7b0eda41b8aadc1dc694.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-08 00:30:38","author":"Will Weissert","authors":["Will Weissert"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"ca","sentiment":-0.06},{"id":391750112,"title":"Tit-for-tat attacks as ceasefire subdues Gaza fighting","text":"An Israeli air strike has killed at least two Palestinians in Gaza, local health authorities say, in what the ‍military said was a retaliatory attack on a Hamas militant that was launched after its ​troops had come under fire.

I’m up for another round of ‘fuck around and find out,’” he said.\n\nFor the woman injured of that non-fatal shooting in October and her attorney, the shooting of another U.S. citizen in Minneapolis on Wednesday came as a bracing reminder of her experience. Once again, a motorist had been shot by a federal agent.\n\n“Minneapolis is the next ‘round,’” said lawyer Christopher Parente, who represents Marimar Martinez, the woman shot in Chicago.\n\nParente said Wednesday he had watched video of the shooting in Minneapolis and spoken with his client about the eerie similarities to her shooting in Chicago, which left Martinez with seven wounds.\n\n“We both said, ‘Of course this happened,’” Parente told The Intercept. “It is no surprise to either Marimar or myself that this happened, and unfortunately, it is going to continue to happen.”\n\nThe shooting in Minneapolis is the latest of a series involving agents from either U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement or U.S. Customs and Border Protection deployed in American cities on the orders of President Donald Trump.\n\nIn September, an ICE officer shot and killed an immigrant, Silverio Villegas-Gonzalez, who was accused of hitting and dragging the officer. The following month in Los Angeles, a federal agent shot a TikTok creator who was accused of hitting law enforcement vehicles that had boxed him in — although video obtained by the Los Angeles Times suggested that his car was not moving. A judge dismissed charges against the TikToker days ago.\n\nAcross the country, police often justify shootings by claiming that motorists have used their vehicles as a deadly weapon, even though police chiefs themselves acknowledge that such shootings are dangerous and ineffective.\n\nPart of the reason that the shootings keep happening is that immigration officials appear to have taken no steps to rein in agents who shoot civilians, Parente said. In the Chicago case, Border Patrol Agent Charles Exum testified in a November 5 court hearing that he had faced no discipline.\n\nFederal prosecutors initially charged Martinez with assaulting federal agents during the October 4 immigration raids undertaken as part of Operation Midway Blitz, the Trump administration’s name for its Chicago crackdown.\n\nExum’s text messages appear to have been so potentially damaging for the government’s case, however, that prosecutors dismissed the charges against Martinez shortly after the messages were made public.\n\nIn one, Exum bragged about the number of times he had hit Martinez.\n\n“I fired 5 shots and she had 7 holes. Put that in your book boys,” he said.\n\nProsecutors dismissed the charges against Martinez despite claims from top-ranking government officials that Martinez was a “domestic terrorist” — the same label that the Department of Homeland Security is using against the Renee Nicole Good, 37-year-old woman identified by her mother as the person shot and killed in Minneapolis.\n\nHomeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem claimed Good was trying to attack federal agents.\n\n“It was an act of domestic terrorism,” Noem said. “These vehicle rammings are domestic acts of terrorism. We are working with the Department of Justice to prosecute them as such.”\n\nParente said that similar claims that his client had tried to ram a federal agent fell apart on the witness stand, when the agent acknowledged that the collision was more akin to a side swipe.\n\n“They labeled Marimar Martinez a ‘domestic terrorist’ from day one,” Parente said. “I would caution anybody reading any press releases or statements about this from the government right now to be very cautious.”","url":"https://theintercept.com/2026/01/07/chicago-shooting-ice-killing-minneapolis/","image":"https://theintercept.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/GettyImages-2255109760_a023dc-e1767813927556.jpg?fit=5660%2C2830","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-08 00:25:58","author":"Matt Sledge","authors":["Matt Sledge"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.419},{"id":391750736,"title":"Treasury implementing Trump’s car loan interest tax break: 'Putting money back in the pockets'","text":"The Treasury Department is implementing President Donald Trump’s No Tax on Car Loan Interest policy, a measure designed to lower costs for American families, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said Wednesday.

DO YOU QUALIFY? Bessent said the Treasury Department and the IRS are rolling out clear guidance so taxpayers \"know exactly how the deduction works.\" \"For millions of Americans, a car isn’t a luxury, it’s how you get to work, school, and childcare,\" Bessent said. \"This deduction helps lower monthly costs and makes car ownership more affordable when families need it most.\" The tax break applies exclusively to vehicles assembled in the U.S., which Bessent said is intended to support American workers. \"The tax cut also supports American workers by applying solely to U.S.-assembled vehicles, strengthening domestic manufacturing,\" he said. AUTO LOAN INTEREST DEDUCTION IN ‘BIG, BEAUTIFUL BILL’ Signed into law July 4, the One Big Beautiful Bill Act includes several requirements for the auto loan interest deduction. It applies only to new cars, SUVs, vans, pickup trucks and motorcycles weighing under 14,000 pounds. Used vehicles are not eligible. To qualify, the vehicle must be purchased for personal use — not business or commercial purposes — and its final assembly must be done in the U.S. Final assembly refers to a process by which the major components of a vehicle — engine, transmission, body and chassis — are fully integrated, and the vehicle is completed at a U.S.-based manufacturing plant, automotive expert Lauren Fix previously told FOX Business. Buyers must also be the vehicle’s first owner, and the loan must be secured by a lien against it, according to Kelley Blue Book. AMERICANS WILL GET ‘GIGANTIC’ TAX REFUND NEXT YEAR, TREASURY SECRETARY SAYS The deduction shrinks for higher earners, phasing out for individuals making more than $100,000 a year and joint filers earning more than $200,000.

By evening, hundreds were there for a vigil to mourn the death and urge the public to resist immigration enforcers.\n\nHomeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, while visiting Texas, described the incident as an “act of domestic terrorism” carried out against ICE officers by a woman who “attempted to run them over and rammed them with her vehicle. An officer of ours acted quickly and defensively, shot, to protect himself and the people around him.”\n\nIn a social media post, President Donald Trump made similar accusations against the woman and defended ICE’s work.\n\nHours later, at an evening news conference in Minnesota, Noem didn't back down, claiming the woman was part of a “mob of agitators.” She said the veteran officer who fired his gun had been rammed and dragged by an anti-ICE motorist in June.\n\n“Any loss of life is a tragedy, and I think all of us can agree that in this situation, it was preventable,” Noem said, adding that the FBI would investigate.\n\nBut Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey blasted Noem's version of what happened as “garbage” and criticized the federal deployment of more than 2,000 officers to the Twin Cities of Minneapolis and St. Paul as part of the immigration crackdown.\n\n“What they are doing is not to provide safety in America. What they are doing is causing chaos and distrust,” Frey said, calling on the immigration agents to leave. “They’re ripping families apart. They’re sowing chaos on our streets, and in this case, quite literally killing people.”\n\n“They are already trying to spin this as an action of self-defense. Having seen the video myself, I wanna tell everybody directly, that is bullshit,” the mayor said.\n\nFrey said he had a message for ICE: \"Get the f--- out of Minneapolis.”\n\nA shooting caught on video \n\nVideos taken by bystanders with different vantage points and posted to social media show an officer approaching an SUV stopped across the middle of the road, demanding the driver open the door and grabbing the handle. The Honda Pilot begins to pull forward and a different ICE officer standing in front of the vehicle pulls his weapon and immediately fires at least two shots into the vehicle at close range, jumping back as the vehicle moves toward him.\n\nIt was not clear from the videos if the vehicle made contact with the officer. The SUV then sped into two cars parked on a curb nearby before crashing to a stop. Witnesses screamed obscenities, expressing shock at what they’d seen. After the shooting, emergency medical technicians tried to administer aid to the woman.\n\n“She was driving away and they killed her,” said resident Lynette Reini-Grandell, who was outdoors recording video on her phone.\n\nThe shooting marked a dramatic escalation of the latest in a series of immigration enforcement operations in major cities under the Trump administration. The death of the Minneapolis driver, whose name wasn't immediately released, was at least the fifth linked to immigration crackdowns.\n\nThe Twin Cities have been on edge since DHS announced Tuesday that it had launched the operation, which is at least partly tied to allegations of fraud involving Somali residents. Noem confirmed Wednesday that DHS had deployed more than 2,000 officers to the area and said they had already made “hundreds and hundreds” of arrests.\n\nA large throng of protesters gathered at the scene after the shooting, where they vented their anger at the local and federal officers who were there, including Gregory Bovino, a senior U.S. Customs and Border Patrol official who has been the face of crackdowns in Los Angeles, Chicago and elsewhere.\n\nIn a scene that hearkened back to the Los Angeles and Chicago crackdowns, bystanders heckled the officers, chanting “Shame! Shame! Shame!” and “ICE out of Minnesota,” and blew whistles that have become ubiquitous during the operations.\n\nGovernor calls for calm\n\nMinnesota Gov. Tim Walz said he's prepared to deploy the National Guard if necessary. He said a family member of the driver was there to witness the killing, which he described as “predictable” and “avoidable.\" He also said like many, he was outraged by the shooting, but he called on people to keep protests peaceful.\n\n“They want a show. We can’t give it to them. We cannot,” the governor said during a news conference. “If you protest and express your First Amendment rights, please do so peacefully, as you always do. We can’t give them what they want.”\n\nMinneapolis Police Chief Brian O'Hara briefly described the shooting to reporters but, unlike federal officials, gave no indication that the driver was trying to harm anyone. \n\n“This woman was in her vehicle and was blocking the roadway on Portland Avenue. ... At some point a federal law enforcement officer approached her on foot and the vehicle began to drive off,\" the chief said. \"At least two shots were fired. The vehicle then crashed on the side of the roadway.”\n\nThere were calls on social media to prosecute the officer who shot the driver. Commissioner Bob Jacobson of the Minnesota Department of Public Safety said state authorities would investigate the shooting with federal authorities.\n\n“Keep in mind that this is an investigation that is also in its infancy. So any speculation about what has happened would be just that,” Jacobson told reporters.\n\nThe shooting happened in the district of Democratic Rep. Ilhan Omar, who called it “state violence,” not law enforcement.\n\nFor nearly a year, migrant rights advocates and neighborhood activists across the Twin Cities have been preparing to mobilize in the event of an immigration enforcement surge. From houses of worship to mobile home parks, they have set up very active online networks, scanned license plates for possible federal vehicles and bought whistles and other noisemaking devices to alert neighborhoods of any enforcement presence.\n\nDell'Orto reported from St. Paul, Minnesota.

They were indicted on charges of alleged \"drug trafficking and narco-terrorism conspiracies\" in the Southern District of New York, and are currently facing trial.Following their capture, Delcy Rodriguez, the Vice President of Venezuela under Maduro, officially assumed the role of the country's acting president, according to CNN.Earlier on Wednesday during a White House press briefing, Leavitt said that the Trump Administration is in \"close correspondence\" with Venezuela's interim leaders and stressed that their decisions continue to be shaped by American engagement and influence.\"The Trump Administration is in close correspondence with the interim authorities in Venezuela.

This has supplanted any discussion of Venezuela, Greenland, or anything else, at least for now.\n\nI’ve spoken to multiple sophisticated people of good faith who have analyzed various footage of the shooting and reached diametrically opposite conclusions.\n\nSelf-defense or murder?\n\nAn act of domestic terrorism or principled protest?\n\nSo far, it appears that where many stand on those questions is untethered from fact, and instead, depends on which political tribe they call their own.\n\nTo Red America, Trump’s deployment of ICE officers into Minneapolis, one of America’s classic liberal places and other deep-blue cities, is the long-delayed arrival of the sheriff to a frontier town overrun by outlaws.\n\nTo them, Trump is restoring order where, in their view, progressive mayors have turned bustling metropolises into theme parks for illegal immigrants - equal parts virtue signaling and chaos.\n\nMinneapolis, of course, stands apart from other places where federal agents have been deployed, because of the recent revelations of a $9 billion fraud scandal linked to the local Somali American community.\n\nIn this telling, the ICE convoys aren’t instruments of intimidation but rescue vehicles, finally enforcing laws that liberal elites would rather pretend don’t exist.\n\nSo, it’s no surprise that the administration is declaring this incident an act of ‘domestic terrorism.’\n\n‘Today, ICE officers in Minneapolis were conducting targeted operations when rioters began blocking ICE officers and one of these violent rioters weaponized her vehicle, attempting to run over our law enforcement officers in an attempt to kill them…’ tweeted Tricia McLaughlin, assistant DHS secretary. There is, of course, no way for the federal government to claim this with any certainty.\n\nMeanwhile, Blue America sees something entirely different: an occupying force rolling across municipal borders with all the subtlety of a drum line in steel boots.\n\nThey see a vivid, unsettling spectacle—federal agents sweeping into immigrant neighborhoods, siren lights strobing across murals and bodegas, the whole scene feeling less like a constitutional government at work and more like a strongman flexing on the skyline.\n\nTo them, Trump isn’t restoring order but staging a televised power play meant to thrill the faithful while rattling families, destroying communities, humiliating local officials and turning city blocks into props in a national-security melodrama.\n\n‘ICE get the f**k out of Minneapolis’ declared city major Jacob Frey on Wednesday as he dismissed any suggestion that ICE officers acted in self-defense.\n\n'I can tell you that is bull****,’ he said.\n\nMinnesota Governor Tim Walz echoed the major on X, writing, 'I've seen the video. Don't believe this propaganda machine.’\n\nThey, too, can’t be so sure. \n\nAnd struck in the middle of these tribes, seemingly locked in perpetual rhetorical warfare, is the rest of America – the majority, in fact.\n\nTheir reaction is a kind of weary squint, a mix of anxiety, resignation and a nagging suspicion that everyone involved is performing for cameras rather than solving problems.\n\nThey see cities grappling with real disorder but also fear the erosion of local control; they crave safety but sound of heavy federal boots on neighborhood pavement.\n\nTo them, both sides seem locked in a color-war pageant with no thought for the aftercare: Red cheering the cavalry charge, Blue decrying the invasion.\n\nIn the coming hours and days, new information will likely raise the temperature higher.\n\nWe’ll learn the identity and background of the victim. Same for the ICE agent.\n\nWhat form will protests take tonight, tomorrow and in the day ahead?\n\nIt remains to be seen whether Mayor Frey will seek to expel ICE from his city.\n\nPerhaps the biggest question of all is: Will the state of Minnesota try to arrest the officer? And, if they do, how will Donald Trump respond?\n\nIf you are one of the tens of millions of Americans who tend to blame Trump for most everything, it is easy to lay all of this at the White House doorstep. After all, the shooting would not have happened if ICE had not been sent in.\n\nIf you are one of the tens of millions of Americans who are grateful that the border has been closed and support the White House’s immigration policies, you likely wonder what kind of person accelerates their car when promoted by law enforcement to exit their vehicle.\n\nOf course, there is a possibility that national leaders find it in themselves to tamp down the wild passions of both sides and America will seek calm and clarity, while an investigation determines the truth.\n\nBased on these early responses, we all need to be prepared for the opposite.","summary":"If you thought the fallout of the death of George Floyd was complex, brace yourself for another law enforcement-related killing about to divide America","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/debate/article-15443583/minneapolis-ice-shooting-minnesota-mark-halperin.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2026/01/07/22/105319587-0-image-a-17_1767824367714.jpg","video":"https://videos.dailymail.co.uk/video/mol/2026/01/07/3370668863542870944/1024x576_MP4_3370668863542870944.mp4","publish_date":"2026-01-08 00:15:48","author":"Editor,Mark Halperin","authors":["Editor","Mark Halperin"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.099},{"id":391752380,"title":"Trump suspends U.S. support for 66 international organizations","text":"The Trump administration will withdraw from dozens of international organizations, including the UN's population agency and the UN treaty that establishes international climate negotiations, as the U.S. further retreats from global co-operation.\n\nU.S. President Donald Trump on Wednesday signed an executive order suspending support for 66 organizations, agencies and commissions following his instructions for his administration to review participation in and funding for all international organizations, including those affiliated with the United Nations, according to a White House statement on social media. \n\nMost of the targets are UN-related agencies, commissions and advisory panels that focus on climate, labour and other issues that the Trump administration has categorized as catering to diversity and \"woke\" initiatives. \n\nOther non-UN organizations on the list include the Partnership for Atlantic Cooperation, the International Institute for Democracy and Electoral Assistance and Global Counterterrorism Forum. \n\n\"The Trump administration has found these institutions to be redundant in their scope, mismanaged, unnecessary, wasteful, poorly run, captured by the interests of actors advancing their own agendas contrary to our own, or a threat to our nation's sovereignty, freedoms, and general prosperity,\" the State Department said in a statement.\n\nTrump's decision to withdraw from organizations that foster co-operation among nations to address global challenges comes as his administration has launched military efforts or issued threats that have rattled allies and adversaries alike, including capturing autocratic Venezuelan leader Nicolás Maduro and indicating an intention to take over Greenland.\n\nLatest U.S. withdrawal from global agencies\n\nThe administration previously suspended support from agencies like the World Health Organization, the UN agency for Palestinian refugees known as UNRWA, the UN Human Rights Council and the UN cultural agency UNESCO. It has taken a different approach to paying its dues to the world body, picking which operations and agencies it believes align with Trump's agenda and those which no longer serve U.S. interests. \n\n\"I think what we're seeing is the crystallization of the U.S. approach to multilateralism, which is ‘my way or the highway,'\" said Daniel Forti, head of UN affairs at the International Crisis Group. \"It's a very clear vision of wanting international co-operation on Washington's own terms.\" \n\nIt has marked a major shift from how previous administrations — both Republican and Democratic — have dealt with the UN, and it has forced the world body, already undergoing its own internal reckoning, to respond with a series of staffing and program cuts. \n\nMany independent nongovernmental agencies — some that work with the United Nations \u0000— have cited many project closures because of the U.S. administration's decision last year to slash foreign assistance through the U.S. Agency for International Development, or USAID.\n\nDespite the massive shift, the U.S. officials, including Trump himself, say they have seen the potential of the UN and want to instead focus taxpayer money on expanding American influence in many of the standard-setting UN initiatives where there is competition with China, like the International Telecommunications Union, the International Maritime Organization and the International Labor Organization.\n\nContinued departure from addressing climate change\n\nThe withdrawal from the U.N. Framework Convention on Climate Change, or UNFCCC, is the latest effort by Trump and his allies to distance the U.S. from international organizations focused on climate and addressing climate change. \n\nUNFCC, the 1992 agreement between 198 countries to financially support climate change activities in developing countries, is the underlying treaty for the landmark Paris climate agreement. Trump, who calls climate change a hoax, withdrew from that agreement soon after reclaiming the White House.\n\nGina McCarthy, former White House national climate adviser, called the move \"shortsighted, embarrassing and a foolish decision.\" \n\n\"As the only country in the world not a part of the UNFCCC treaty, the Trump administration is throwing away decades of U.S. climate change leadership and global collaboration,\" McCarthy, who co-chairs America Is All In, a coalition of climate-concerned U.S. states and cities, said in a statement.\n\nMainstream scientists say climate change is behind increasing instances of deadly and costly extreme weather, including flooding, droughts, wildfires, intense rainfall events and dangerous heat.\n\nThe U.S. withdrawal could hinder global efforts to curb greenhouse gases because it \"gives other nations the excuse to delay their own actions and commitments,\" said Stanford University climate scientist Rob Jackson, who chairs the Global Carbon Project, a group of scientists that tracks countries' carbon dioxide emissions.\n\nIt also will be difficult to achieve meaningful progress on climate change without co-operation from the U.S., one of the world's largest emitters and economies, experts said. \n\nThe UN's population agency, which provides sexual and reproductive health across the world, has long been a lightning rod for Republican opposition and Trump himself cut funding for the agency during his first term in office. He and other GOP officials have accused the agency of participating in \"coercive abortion practices\" in countries like China. \n\nWhen former U.S. president Joe Biden took office in January 2021, he restored funding for the agency. A State Department review conducted the following year found no evidence to support these claims. \n\nOther organizations and agencies that the U.S. will quit include the Carbon Free Energy Compact, the United Nations University, the International Cotton Advisory Committee, the International Tropical Timber Organization, the Partnership for Atlantic Cooperation, the Pan-American Institute for Geography and History, the International Federation of Arts Councils and Culture Agencies and the International Lead and Zinc Study Group.\n\nThe State Department said additional reviews are ongoing.","summary":"U.S. President Donald Trump on Wednesday signed an executive order suspending U.S. support for 66 organizations, agencies and commissions following his instructions for his administration to review participation in and funding for all international organizations, including those affiliated with the United Nations, according to a White House statement on social media.","url":"https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/trump-suspends-us-support-for-international-organizations-9.7037333?cmp=rss","image":"https://i.cbc.ca/ais/0b482d01-f373-447c-b0e7-a55202511b81,1767828180499/full/max/0/default.jpg?im=Crop%2Crect%3D%280%2C421%2C5562%2C3128%29%3B","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-08 00:14:49","author":null,"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"ca","sentiment":-0.112},{"id":391730652,"title":"US seeks long-term control of Venezuelan oil sales","text":"US needs to control Venezuela oil sales, says Energy Sec Wright. Controlling Venezuela’s oil meant controlling country: US VP Vance. Democrats slam Trump admin strategy as akin to stealing oil.\n\nThe US needs to control Venezuela’s oil sales and revenue indefinitely to stabilise that country’s economy, rebuild its oil sector and ensure it acts in America’s interests, top US officials said on Wednesday.\n\nThe comments reflect the importance of crude oil to President Donald Trump’s strategy in Venezuela after US forces ousted the country’s leader, Nicolas Maduro, in a raid on the capital, Caracas, on Saturday.\n\n“We need to have that leverage and that control of those oil sales to drive the changes that simply must happen in Venezuela,” US Energy Secretary Chris Wright said at the Goldman Sachs Energy, CleanTech & Utilities Conference in Miami.\n\nHe said the revenues would be used to stabilise Venezuela’s economy and eventually to repay oil majors Exxon Mobil and ConocoPhillips for losses when their assets were nationalised by former President Hugo Chavez nearly two decades ago.\n\nUS Vice President JD Vance said that controlling Venezuela’s oil meant controlling the country.\n\n“We control the energy resources, and we tell the regime: ‘You’re allowed to sell the oil so long as you serve America’s national interest; you’re not allowed to sell it if you can’t serve America’s national interest,’” he told the Fox News “Jesse Watters Primetime” programme.\n\n“And that’s how we exert incredible pressure on that country without wasting a single American life, without endangering a single American citizen,” he said.\n\nDemocratic lawmakers criticised this approach, which Connecticut Senator Chris Murphy equated to stealing Venezuela’s oil at gunpoint, while industry analysts warned about political instability as the country treads a fine line between denouncing Maduro’s capture and appeasing the US.\n\nThe OPEC member nation sits atop the world’s largest oil reserves but accounts for only about 1% of global supply after decades of underinvestment eroded production.\n\nStored oil moving to market first\n\nEnergy Secretary Wright said the US would market stored Venezuelan oil first and then sell ongoing future production indefinitely, with revenues deposited into accounts controlled by the US government.\n\nSuch sales have already begun and the US has engaged “the world’s leading commodity marketers and key banks” to execute and provide financial support for them, according to a statement from the US Department of Energy.\n\nWright added he was speaking to US oil companies to learn what conditions would enable them to enter Venezuela to help boost the country’s production in the longer term.\n\n“The resources are immense. This should be a wealthy, prosperous, peaceful energy powerhouse,” he said.\n\nOn Tuesday, Washington announced a deal with Caracas to initially export up to $2 billion worth of Venezuelan crude to the United States, a sign the government of interim Venezuelan President Delcy Rodriguez is responding to Trump’s demand that it open up to US oil companies or risk more military intervention.\n\nTrump said on Wednesday in a post on Truth Social that Venezuela has agreed to use the proceeds from the sale of its oil to purchase American-made goods.\n\n“A wise choice, and a very good thing for the people of Venezuela, and the United States,” he wrote.\n\nVenezuela’s state-run oil company PDVSA said it was progressing in negotiations with the United States for oil sales. PDVSA board member Wills Rangel told Reuters the US will need to buy cargoes at fair market prices.\n\nShares of US refiners Marathon Petroleum, Phillips 66 and Valero Energy were up between 2.5% and 5%.\n\nWhite House meetings\n\nTrump is scheduled to meet with the heads of major oil companies at the White House on Friday to discuss ways of raising Venezuela’s oil production.\n\nRepresentatives from Exxon Mobil, ConocoPhillips and Chevron – the top three US oil companies – would be present, according to a source familiar with the planning.\n\nChevron Vice Chairman Mark Nelson will represent the company at the meeting, another source said.\n\nThe companies, all of which have experience in Venezuela, have declined to comment.\n\nWright said in an interview with CNBC on Wednesday afternoon that he spoke with the chief executives of all three companies immediately after Maduro was seized, and expected them to be engaged in rehabilitating Venezuela’s oil sector.\n\n“Are they going to put billions of dollars into building new infrastructure in Venezuela next week? Of course not,” he said. “But they want to be productive advisers and helpers in that process.”\n\nWright also told CNBC that some of the proceeds from Venezuelan oil sales could eventually be used to repay ConocoPhillips and Exxon Mobil for losses when they exited the country, but only after Venezuela’s economy is stabilised.\n\nChevron is the only US oil major still operating in Venezuela’s oil fields.\n\nVenezuela was producing as much as 3.5 million barrels per day in the 1970s. But mismanagement and limited foreign investment have since led to a sharp drop in annual production, which averaged about 1.1 million bpd last year.\n\nWright said he believed Venezuelan production could be increased within a short period with an infusion of equipment and technology, but that a broader recovery to past production levels would take years.","url":"https://www.geo.tv/latest/643861-us-seeks-long-term-control-of-venezuelan-oil-sales","image":"https://www.geo.tv/assets/uploads/updates/2026-01-08/l_643861_052000_updates.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-08 00:13:22","author":"Reuters","authors":["Reuters"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"pk","sentiment":-0.278},{"id":391725164,"title":"House Speaker Mike Johnson proposes Feb. 24 for State of the Union","text":"Jan. 7 (UPI) -- House Speaker Mike Johnson on Wednesday formally invited President Donald Trump to deliver the State of the Union address to a joint session of Congress on Feb. 24.\n\n\"As our nation marks the Semi-quincentennial Anniversary of American Independence, the United States stands stronger, freer and more prosperous under your leadership and bold action,\" Johnson said in a letter inviting the president to deliver the SOU address.\n\n\"Together in 2025, your administration and the 119th Congress delivered one of the most consequential agendas in history, and Americans across this great country will experience the tangible results of commonsense governance,\" Johnson wrote.\n\n\"We look forward to advancing the important work ahead of us in 2026, serving the American people, defending liberty, and preserving this grand experiment in self-governance,\" he continued.\n\n\"To that end, it is my distinct honor and great privilege to invite you to address a Joint Session of Congress on Tuesday, February 24, 2026, in the chamber of the U.S. House of Representatives,\" Johnson said.\n\nThe SOU address would be the first during Trump's second term in the White House, although he delivered a similar address on March 25 that led to heckling by some Democrats in attendance.\n\nRep.

Thom Tillis of North Carolina about President Donald Trump threatening to use military force to take Greenland.\n\nTillis, who is retiring at the end of the year, called it “unproductive and unwise.” \n\nBut shortly thereafter, Tillis took to the Senate floor and let people know what he really thought about the plans. \n\n“Folks, amateur hour is over,” Tillis said in a booming speech. Specifically, he seemed to call out Stephen Miller, the White House deputy chief of staff who promoted the idea in a bombastic interview on CNN Monday. \n\n“It may be the position of the president of the United States that Greenland should be part of the United States, but it’s not the position of this government because we’re a coequal branch,” he said. “If that were to come to pass, there would be a vote on the floor to make it real, not the surreal sort of environment that some deputy chief of staff thinks was cute to say on TV.” \n\nTillis and Trump had a public falling out last year when the North Carolina Republican opposed Trump’s “One Big, Beautiful Bill,” which led to him saying he would not seek re-election. That gives him some latitude. \n\nBut even Republicans who are vocal supporters of the president do not seem sold on the idea of taking Greenland, which is part of the Kingdom of Denmark, by military force. \n\n“I just think we need to work well with the Danes,” Sen. Joni Ernst of Iowa, who is also retiring, told The Independent. \n\nAnd it’s not just retiring Republicans who appear fed up with the president. \n\n“I continue to hope the administration’s rhetoric on Greenland is nothing more than posturing for a new era of cooperation, because any effort to claim or take the territory by force would degrade both our national security and our international relationships,” Sen. Lisa Murkowski said in a statement.\n\nMurkowski, who voted to convict Trump for his actions on January 6 five years ago, has walked a fine line between her critiques of the president and voting for his nominees. But as a senator with close ties to Arctic partners, she is firmly in the camp of opposing military action.\n\nHouse Speaker Mike Johnson also brushed off Trump’s rhetoric around military action in Greenland. \n\n“So all this stuff about military action and all that, I don't even think that's a possibility,” Johnson told The Independent during his weekly press conference. “I don't think anybody's seriously considering that. And in the Congress, we’re certainly not.”\n\nOf course, that’s not true. White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt floated the idea this week. \n\n“The president and his team are discussing a range of options to pursue this important foreign policy goal, and of course, utilizing the US military is always an option at the Commander-in-Chief's disposal,” she said.\n\nUnsurprisingly, Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky, a libertarian with a noninterventionist streak, criticized the idea. \n\n“I think buying Greenland would be a lot different, but I’m not for military action, “ he told The Independent.\n\nThe president is feeling especially emboldened after he ordered a successful operation in Caracas that concluded with the arrest of Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro. \n\nIn response to Trump’s proposal to take Greenland by force, Democratic senators are planning to have a vote on a War Powers Act resolution. Sen. Ruben Gallego of Arizona, a combat veteran of the U.S. Marine Corps, is proposing his own legislation. \n\n“I hope good sense prevails,” Sen. Chris Murphy of Connecticut told The Independent. “But I mean, the decision-making in his national security team is just bananas right now, I think it's going to be continued, continued bananas for the foreseeable future.”\n\nThis comes as Sen. Tim Kaine of Virginia will force a vote on his War Powers Act resolution for military action in Venezuela on Thursday. \n\n“All I will say is, they're talking about it, and people thought Trump was bluffing when he talked about Venezuela, and he wasn't,” Kaine told The Independent. “So you got to take it seriously.”","summary":"Analysis: Mike Johnson says nobody in Congress is talking about military action.

Both are now in New York City, facing charges brought by the U.S. government.\n\n“There’s no process in our foreign policy anymore,” said Luis Moreno, a former ambassador to Jamaica and former foreign policy official with years of experience in the Caribbean. “We’re doing foreign policy, and defense policy to a certain extent, via tweet at 3 o’clock in the morning, and everyone has to respond to that.”\n\nBecause Trump didn’t seek congressional authorization ahead of the military attack, which is required by the Constitution, Republican and Democratic foreign policy leaders on Capitol Hill are in the dark on what the U.S. is doing in Venezuela, a country of 28 million people who have already endured decades of political repression and corruption.\n\nThe Trump administration has yet to lay out a coherent plan for what happens now. Trump has claimed the U.S. will now ”run” Venezuela and be “very much involved” in taking the country’s oil. Secretary of State Marco Rubio tried to walk that back, saying the U.S. is overseeing the “direction” of the country. Vice President JD Vance said the raid was about “narcoterrorists,” while Rubio linked it to Iran and Hezbollah.\n\nBut Trump has also suggested the surprise raid was in part an economic decision, referring to Venezuela’s oil as “stolen American oil” and saying he consulted with U.S. oil companies before and after the raid, something they’ve disputed. This framing comes at a time when Trump’s economic approval hit a new low last month, at 36%.\n\nThe decision to remove Maduro by force is particularly “disturbing” because it underscores how Trump is shifting the U.S. away from the goal of supporting democracy and human rights globally, and toward something dark, said Brian Naranjo, a former senior foreign service officer who spent more than 30 years serving primarily in the Western Hemisphere.\n\n“This is an effort, quite frankly, that looks very neo-imperialist to me, and neo-colonial,” Naranjo said. Other countries in the Western Hemisphere are now reorganizing themselves to better prepare to push back against the United States, he said, which is eroding decades of work by U.S. diplomats to build stronger relations with these nations.\n\n“This jackassery that is being inflicted by the White House is being taken quite seriously downrange in the hemisphere,” he said. “For all intents and purposes, the United States is going alone on this, but for the absence of a plan, resources and manpower.”\n\nDemocrats in Congress have been demanding that lawmakers immediately pass legislation reining in Trump’s war powers on Venezuela, which is precisely the role that Congress is supposed to fulfill under the Constitution. They’ve emphasized that while Maduro is a corrupt dictator, his regime didn’t pose the kind of immediate threat to the U.S. that justifies bypassing congressional approval.\n\n“It is simply unacceptable that Donald Trump continues ignoring that constitutional requirement,” Sen. Tammy Duckworth (D-Ill.), an Iraq War combat veteran and co-sponsor of a war powers resolution on Venezuela, said in a statement.\n\nTrump’s comments suggesting an open-ended military presence in Venezuela have already brought comparisons to the Iraq War disaster.\n\n“While Donald Trump may never understand that the true costs of war are measured not only in dollars and cents, but in the blood, sweat and sacrifices of our troops and our military families, our servicemembers know all too well just how costly it can be when our nation engages in a war for oil without a plan for what comes next,” Duckworth said.\n\nSen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) is the only Republican who signed on to the Venezuela war resolution. Most other GOP senators have shrugged, saying they think Trump already has the authority to unilaterally carry out military raids like the kind he ordered in Venezuela. The line for them, it seems, is when it could involve sending U.S. ground troops into the country.\n\nTo be sure, past U.S. presidents have taken direct military action against foreign leaders. Former President George H. W. Bush, for one, ordered the 1989 invasion of Panama that led to the detention of dictator Manuel Noriega, who surrendered and faced drug trafficking charges in the United States.\n\nBut Steven Nash, a former CIA official and specialist in intelligence operations, said the “constellation of events” surrounding Trump’s military raid in Venezuela makes this incident stand apart from others.\n\n“The lack of any briefing of Congress, the lack of any authorization or even discussion of this, and in fact, multiple reports of affirmative misinformation put into Congress by, among others, Secretary Rubio, I do think is certainly, in the 20th and 21st century, unprecedented,” said Nash, who is currently the executive director of The Steady State, a network of former senior national security officials and the group that organized Tuesday’s press call.\n\nRepublicans on Capitol Hill need to wake up to their role in overseeing the president’s military actions, he said, offering pointed questions for them.\n\n“Are you really giving up the foreign affairs power that is entrusted to Congress under the Constitution? Are you giving up your appropriation powers entrusted in the Constitution?” Nash asked. “Are you concerned that you have a leader now who seems to be acting much more in the mold of authoritarians … than any previous president?”\n\nTrump, of course, ultimately decides the path ahead for the U.S. and Venezuela, and that’s precisely what worries longtime national security experts. He is erratic and impulsive, and at 79, critics are increasingly concerned about his mental state.\n\n“The worry that we all have … is the president, the man himself, who is sinking deeper into a dementia of some sort,” said Bill Piekney, a former CIA executive who served the intelligence agency for 30 years.\n\n“He can’t speak. He can’t think,” Piekney said. “The absence of any Kissingerian-like figure who can sit down and do long-term, strategic planning is absolutely staggering.”\n\nAnd unlike in his first term, Trump has now surrounded himself completely with advisers too afraid to stand up to him. With congressional leaders showing little appetite for reining in his military plans and Trump’s inner circle simply following orders, it’s hard to see what guardrails are even left.\n\n“There is absolutely no one around him who can lasso him and bring him back down from whatever dangerous positions he has chosen,” Piekney added. “In fact, they enable and embolden and empower him.”","url":"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/national-security-experts-trump-venezuela_n_695ecba4e4b07c5009383ec1?origin=home-politics-feed-unit","image":"https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/695edfbc1b000089029ec4fe.jpeg?cache=uGRmWu8cx3&ops=1778_1000","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-08 00:01:24","author":"Jennifer Bendery","authors":["Jennifer Bendery"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"ca","sentiment":0.082},{"id":391749322,"title":"ROI-Trump&#039;s &#039;Donroe Doctrine&#039; targets China, US oil firms could pay the price:  Bousso","text":"ROI-Trump's 'Donroe Doctrine' targets China, US oil firms could pay the price: BoussoPresident Donald Trump plans\nto import previously sanctioned Venezuelan oil into the U.S.,\ntearing up the global energy playbook and underscoring the\nseriousness of the administration’s ambition to...","url":"https://www.marketscreener.com/news/roi-trump-s-donroe-doctrine-targets-china-us-oil-firms-could-pay-the-price-bousso-ce7e59dcd180f424","image":"https://cdn.zonebourse.com/static/resize/1200/675//images/reuters/2025-03-13T172638Z_1_LYNXMPEL2C0VY_RTROPTP_3_BUSINESS-FRANCE.JPG","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-08 00:01:22","author":"Reuters","authors":["Reuters"],"language":"en","source_country":"fr","sentiment":-0.76},{"id":391763708,"title":"Revised global tax pact exempts American firms after G7 talks","text":"WASHINGTON, D.C.: A long-running global effort to curb corporate tax avoidance has taken a new turn, with the world's biggest economies agreeing to shield U.S. multinationals from paying higher taxes overseas under a revised international deal.\n\nThe Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development said on January 5 that nearly 150 countries had signed off on an amended version of its global tax agreement, first crafted in 2021 to prevent large companies from shifting profits to low-tax jurisdictions regardless of where they operate.\n\nUnder the revised framework, large U.S.-based multinational corporations are excluded from the 15 percent global minimum corporate tax, following negotiations between the administration of U.S. President Donald Trump and other members of the Group of Seven wealthy nations.\n\nOECD Secretary-General Mathias Cormann described the outcome as a \"landmark decision in international tax co-operation\" that \"enhances tax certainty, reduces complexity, and protects tax bases,\" according to a statement.\n\nU.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent hailed the agreement as \"a historic victory in preserving U.S. sovereignty and protecting American workers and businesses from extraterritorial overreach.\"\n\nThe latest deal significantly softens the original 2021 agreement, which established a minimum global corporate tax rate of 15 percent. That plan was designed to stop multinational companies — including Apple and Nike — from using accounting structures and legal strategies to shift profits to low- or no-tax jurisdictions.\n\nSuch jurisdictions often include places like Bermuda and the Cayman Islands, where companies typically conduct little or no actual business but benefit from minimal tax rates.\n\nFormer U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen was a central architect of the 2021 OECD deal and made the global minimum tax one of her top policy priorities. At the time, congressional Republicans strongly opposed the plan, arguing it would weaken U.S. competitiveness in the global economy.\n\nThe Trump administration revisited the agreement in June after congressional Republicans rolled back a so-called \"revenge tax\" provision in Trump's sweeping tax and spending legislation. That provision would have allowed the U.S. government to impose taxes on companies with foreign owners and on investors from countries deemed to levy \"unfair foreign taxes\" on U.S. firms.\n\nWhile Republicans applauded the revised deal, tax transparency advocates criticised the changes, arguing they undermine years of progress.\n\n\"This deal risks nearly a decade of global progress on corporate taxation only to allow the largest, most profitable American companies to keep parking profits in tax havens,\" said Zorka Milin, policy director at the FACT Coalition, a tax transparency nonprofit.\n\nTax watchdog groups say the global minimum tax was intended to halt an international \"race to the bottom,\" in which countries compete to attract multinational profits by offering ever-lower corporate tax rates.\n\nRepublican lawmakers, however, welcomed the outcome.

He pointed to the deserted street, a few blocks from Venezuela's presidential palace, which armed civilians and military personnel guarded.\n\nVenezuela has seen political turmoil before, but the U.S. military operation carried out early on January 3 marked an unprecedented moment.\n\nU.S. President Donald Trump initially said the United States would \"run\" the country until stability was restored. However, Secretary of State Marco Rubio appeared to soften that position on January 4.\n\nIn interviews, Rubio said Washington planned to use control over Venezuela's oil industry to pressure policy changes and described the current government as illegitimate. Venezuela holds the world's largest proven crude oil reserves.\n\nRubio said the United States wanted Venezuela to undergo a complete transition but acknowledged that such a change would not happen quickly.\n\nDefense Minister Vladimir Padrino López, standing alongside senior military leaders, told citizens that Nicolás Maduro remained the legitimate president. At the same time, the country's top court ordered Vice President Delcy Rodríguez to take over presidential duties as interim leader.\n\nMaduro's allies demanded his release from U.S. custody in New York, where he made his first court appearance. State-run media did not broadcast images of him in handcuffs, but those images were circulated widely on social media, leaving many Venezuelans stunned.\n\nNely Gutiérrez, a retired woman who spoke tearfully, said she was deeply saddened by what she was witnessing. She described Maduro as a human being and said she feared for his life in U.S. custody. She said she had gone to church to pray for peace and for Maduro, though she did not say whether she had ever voted for him.\n\nOutside Venezuela and in some Latin American countries, Maduro's removal was welcomed. Inside the country, reactions were mixed. Some supporters burned U.S. flags and held signs calling for Americans to leave. Others avoided public celebration. Construction worker Daniel Medalla said people were afraid to show joy because of possible government reprisals, even though many had long hoped for Maduro's departure.\n\nMemories of past repression remain strong. After the disputed 2024 presidential election, which Maduro claimed to have won despite evidence suggesting otherwise, protests were violently suppressed. Official figures said 28 people were killed, 220 were injured, and at least 2,000 were detained.\n\nA day after the raid, police and military presence in Caracas appeared lighter than usual. Soldiers worked to clear parts of an air base that had burned, along with at least three passenger buses, during the U.S. attack. Rubio said no U.S. troops were on the ground but did not rule out additional strikes.\n\nOfficials said civilians and military personnel were killed in the operation, but no official death toll has been released. With visible injuries and his home badly damaged, Wilman González said all that remained were ruins. Latest reports suggested that 80 people, including many elderly civilians, were killed.\n\nHe expressed anger not only over his personal loss but also over years of economic hardship and political failure. He said the government no longer served the people and added that what Venezuelans wanted was a government that worked for everyone, not just a select few.","url":"https://www.beijingbulletin.com/news/278792984/venezuelans-pick-up-the-pieces-a-day-after-us-forces-abduct-maduro","image":"https://image.chitra.live/api/v1/wps/d97b94a/3e2869f9-cac2-42fe-aa89-c7df27b214c3/2/5-Maduro-600x315.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-08 00:00:00","author":null,"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"cn","sentiment":-0.199},{"id":391763698,"title":"Trump slams NATO after European leaders push back on Greenland, reaffirms US primacy in alliance","text":"Washington DC [US], January 7 (ANI): US President Donald Trump on Wednesday launched a sharp attack on the intergovernmental military alliance, the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO), claiming that the alliance depended entirely on Washington for its survival, shortly after European leaders pushed back against his remarks on taking over Greenland and reaffirming NATO unity.\n\nIn a post on Truth Social, Trump said that before his intervention, most NATO members were not meeting their defence spending commitments and were relying on Washington to shoulder the burden.\n\nThe US President stated that he pushed NATO members to raise defence spending to 5 per cent of GDP, asserting that allies now pay 'immediately' because of his personal influence.\n\n'Remember, for all of those big NATO fans, they were at 2% GDP, and most weren't paying their bills, UNTIL I CAME ALONG. The USA was, foolishly, paying for them! I, respectfully, got them to 5% GDP, AND THEY PAY, immediately. Everyone said that couldn't be done, but it could, because, beyond all else, they are all my friends,' Trump said.\n\nHis remarks come a day after European leaders issued a joint statement pushing back against Trump's renewed remarks about Greenland, asserting that Arctic security must be addressed collectively.\n\nIn a letter released by the Danish Prime Minister's Office on X, the leaders reaffirmed Greenland's status within the transatlantic alliance, stating, 'The Kingdom of Denmark - including Greenland - is part of NATO.'\n\nForeign ministers of Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway and Sweden have also jointly reaffirmed their collective commitment to preserving security, stability and cooperation in the Arctic, underscoring their support for a stronger and more vigilant NATO presence in the region.\n\nThe Nordic foreign ministers, in a statement, said that as Nordic countries, Arctic states and NATO allies, they are united in their approach to regional security, particularly amid evolving strategic challenges in the Arctic.\n\nTrump further claimed that without his involvement, Russia would have captured all of Ukraine, claiming that he had 'single-handedly ended eight wars,' arguing that his actions saved millions of lives.\n\nHe also expressed resentment over not receiving the Nobel Peace Prize, specifically criticising Norway, a NATO member, for what he described as a 'foolish' decision not to award him the honour.\n\nTrump further questioned the credibility of NATO without US leadership, stating that Russia and China have 'zero fear of NATO without the United States,' and also cast doubt on whether NATO allies would come to America's aid in a crisis.\n\n'Without my involvement, Russia would have ALL OF UKRAINE right now. Remember, also, I single-handedly ENDED 8 WARS, and Norway, a NATO Member, foolishly chose not to give me the Noble Peace Prize. But that doesn't matter! What does matter is that I saved Millions of Lives. RUSSIA AND CHINA HAVE ZERO FEAR OF NATO WITHOUT THE UNITED STATES, AND I DOUBT NATO WOULD BE THERE FOR US IF WE REALLY NEEDED THEM,' his post read.\n\nHighlighting military spending, Trump credited himself with rebuilding the US armed forces during his first term and said this continued investment underpins global security.\n\nDespite his criticism, Trump said the US would continue to support NATO, even if the alliance did not reciprocate.\n\n'EVERYONE IS LUCKY THAT I REBUILT OUR MILITARY IN MY FIRST TERM, AND CONTINUE TO DO SO. We will always be there for NATO, even if they won't be there for us. The only Nation that China and Russia fear and respect is the DJT REBUILT U.S.A.,' Trump noted in his post.

Some companies negotiated to stay, while others exited and sought arbitration.\n\nChevron was among those that remained in Venezuela through joint ventures with PDVSA. Rivals Exxon Mobil and ConocoPhillips left the country and later filed international arbitration claims.\n\nPresident Donald Trump said that American companies were prepared to return to Venezuela and invest to restart its struggling oil sector, speaking just hours after Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro was captured and removed by U.S. forces.\n\nAccording to the sources, administration officials have made clear that, in a post-Maduro scenario, U.S. oil companies would need to fund the rebuilding of Venezuela's oil industry themselves before any repayment of debts stemming from expropriations could be considered.\n\nThat condition could prove especially costly for companies such as ConocoPhillips. The firm has long sought to recover about US$12 billion from the nationalisation of its Venezuelan assets under Chavez. Exxon Mobil has also pursued arbitration, seeking around $1.65 billion.\n\nTrump began publicly referencing the expropriations last month when he ordered a blockade of sanctioned oil tankers.\n\nConditions for Return\n\nWhether U.S. oil companies ultimately decide to re-enter Venezuela will depend on how executives, boards, and shareholders assess the risks of renewed investment in the country, the sources said.\n\n\"ConocoPhillips is monitoring developments in Venezuela and their potential implications for global energy supply and stability. It would be premature to speculate on any future business activities or investments,\" a company spokesperson said in emailed comments to Reuters on January 3. The company reiterated the statement on January 4 when asked about its discussions with the administration.\n\nExxon Mobil did not immediately respond to questions.\n\nPolitico first reported on the recent discussions between U.S. officials and oil executives.\n\nEven if companies agree to return, analysts say it could take years before Venezuela sees a meaningful increase in oil output. The country holds some of the world's largest estimated oil reserves, but production has collapsed over the past decades because of mismanagement, chronic underinvestment, and U.S. sanctions.\n\nFirms considering a comeback would also face a host of challenges, including uncertainty over contract terms, security risks, dilapidated infrastructure, questions about the legality of the U.S. operation that removed Maduro, and the prospect of prolonged political instability, analysts have told Reuters.\n\nVenezuela, a founding member of OPEC, once produced as much as 3.5 million barrels per day in the 1970s, accounting for more than seven percent of global oil output at the time. Production slipped below two million bpd during the 2010s and averaged about 1.1 million bpd last year, or roughly one percent of global production.","url":"https://www.beijingbulletin.com/news/278792958/washington-links-debt-recovery-to-fresh-investment-in-venezuelan-oil","image":"https://image.chitra.live/api/v1/wps/ace4b84/453e5c0b-8b6b-40d7-976d-109248fe4f24/2/Venuzuela-oil-600x315.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-08 00:00:00","author":null,"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"cn","sentiment":-0.475},{"id":391763724,"title":"China slams US 'bullying' over Venezuela sovereignty, urges protection of lawful rights","text":"Beijing [China], January 7 (ANI): China on Wednesday strongly condemned the United States' actions against Venezuela, branding Washington's demands and use of force over the South American nation as 'bullying' that violates international law, infringes on the country's sovereignty, and undermines the rights of its people.\n\nAddressing a press briefing, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Mao Ning, when asked about the US administration urging Venezuela's acting president to sever economic ties with China, Russia, Iran and Cuba and partner exclusively with the US, said that such demands 'seriously breach international law' and amount to coercion that threatens Venezuela's sovereign rights.\n\nShe emphasised that Venezuela is a sovereign state with permanent control over its natural resources and economic activity, and that the lawful rights and interests of China and other partner nations must be upheld.\n\n'Venezuela is a sovereign state and has full permanent sovereignty over all its natural resources and economic activities.

Everyone said that couldn't be done, but it could, because, beyond all else, they are all my friends,' Trump said.\n\nHis remarks come a day after European leaders issued a joint statement pushing back against Trump's renewed remarks about Greenland, asserting that Arctic security must be addressed collectively.\n\nIn a letter released by the Danish Prime Minister's Office on X, the leaders reaffirmed Greenland's status within the transatlantic alliance, stating, 'The Kingdom of Denmark - including Greenland - is part of NATO.'\n\nForeign ministers of Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway and Sweden have also jointly reaffirmed their collective commitment to preserving security, stability and cooperation in the Arctic, underscoring their support for a stronger and more vigilant NATO presence in the region.\n\nThe Nordic foreign ministers, in a statement, said that as Nordic countries, Arctic states and NATO allies, they are united in their approach to regional security, particularly amid evolving strategic challenges in the Arctic.\n\nTrump further claimed that without his involvement, Russia would have captured all of Ukraine, claiming that he had 'single-handedly ended eight wars,' arguing that his actions saved millions of lives.\n\nHe also expressed resentment over not receiving the Nobel Peace Prize, specifically criticising Norway, a NATO member, for what he described as a 'foolish' decision not to award him the honour.\n\nTrump further questioned the credibility of NATO without US leadership, stating that Russia and China have 'zero fear of NATO without the United States,' and also cast doubt on whether NATO allies would come to America's aid in a crisis.\n\n'Without my involvement, Russia would have ALL OF UKRAINE right now. Remember, also, I single-handedly ENDED 8 WARS, and Norway, a NATO Member, foolishly chose not to give me the Noble Peace Prize. But that doesn't matter! What does matter is that I saved Millions of Lives. RUSSIA AND CHINA HAVE ZERO FEAR OF NATO WITHOUT THE UNITED STATES, AND I DOUBT NATO WOULD BE THERE FOR US IF WE REALLY NEEDED THEM,' his post read.\n\nHighlighting military spending, Trump credited himself with rebuilding the US armed forces during his first term and said this continued investment underpins global security.\n\nDespite his criticism, Trump said the US would continue to support NATO, even if the alliance did not reciprocate.\n\n'EVERYONE IS LUCKY THAT I REBUILT OUR MILITARY IN MY FIRST TERM, AND CONTINUE TO DO SO. We will always be there for NATO, even if they won't be there for us. The only Nation that China and Russia fear and respect is the DJT REBUILT U.S.A.,' Trump noted in his post.

But despite Moscow's warnings to back off, US Coast Guard helicopters descended on the Marinera, recently renamed from Bella 1, and took control of it.\n\nCounting On Carte Blanche: What Maduro's Capture Could Mean For Russia\n\nRussia's Flag Was No Help\n\n\"This individual action threatens to undermine the security and sanctuary that registering or re-registering in Russia might otherwise create,\" John Burgess, senior fellow at the Center for International Law and Governance at Tufts University, told RFE/RL on January 7.\n\nThe Marinera had only adopted the Russian flag on December 30 following an earlier US boarding attempt as it approached Venezuelan waters. Burgess said this made the Marinera's status \"ambiguous,\" meaning its newly adopted Russian flag, which the crew even daubed on the ship's hull, was no help.\n\n\"It was a legal boarding with some questions associated with it. Ships are not supposed to change flags for convenience. There's supposed to be a substantive reason,\" he said.\n\nWashington appeared to take a similar view.\n\n\"The vessel was deemed stateless after flying a false flag,\" White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters, dismissing protests from Russian lawmakers that the seizure was \"a violation of maritime law\" or even \"piracy.\"\n\nWhat Happens To A Shadow Fleet Ship When Its Sanctioned?\n\nEstimates put the size of theshadow fleetsused by Russia, Iran, and Venezuela to evade international sanctions at around 1,000 vessels. Their numbers have swelled in recent years as the three nations have sought to maintain oil sales that are vital to their state budgets.\n\nThe ships are often old, in poor condition, and lacking insurance. Hundreds of them have been blacklisted by the United States, theEuropean Union, and others -- severely restricting their ability to function but not stopping it entirely.\n\n'A Template' For 'More Seizures'\n\nShipping industry analysts have already said US actions against flagless ships, as well as recent Ukrainian drone strikes on sanctioned vessels in the Black Sea, have marked a new era of tougher actions against the shadow fleet.\n\nThe seizing of the Marinera takes it up a notch further.\n\n\"US regulators are watching. More seizures are likely,\" said Michelle Bockmann, senior maritime intelligence analyst at Windward, said during a webinar on January 7.\n\nBockmann added the move on the Marinera offered \"a template\" toBaltic Seanations that have grappled with \"the threat that the dark fleet poses to maritime safety, maritime security, and the environment, especially those that are falsely flagged. The US has shown that it is possible to interdict and to seize and to deal with tankers.\"\n\nHow Will Turmoil In Oil-Rich Venezuela Impact Trade With Far-Flung Partners?\n\nIt was also notable that, in the case of the Marinera, the United States did not act alone. Britain's Defense Ministry said the country's air force had provided extra surveillance and navy refueling in support of the US operation.\n\nDiplomatic Fallout\n\nDefense Secretary John Healey said US forces had been allowed to use their bases in the UK for the mission, adding it was justified under international law because the Marinera was part of \"a Russian-Iranian axis of sanctions evasion which is fueling terrorism, conflict, and misery from the Middle East to Ukraine.\"\n\nThe statement not only offers a different legal case. It also draws attention to the complex geopolitical backdrop to the seizure of the vessel.\n\nWashington has spent months in negotiations with Russia, Ukraine, and European nations over an end to the war in Ukraine. The latest drafts includesecurity guaranteesto Kyiv that were already unacceptable to Moscow.\n\nThese events represent a further blow to Moscow's prestige following the US raid that ended with the detention of a key Kremlin ally, the now ousted Venezuelan leaderNicolas Maduro.\n\nThe fallout will continue.\n\nIt was not immediately clear how many Russian crew were on board the Marinera. Russia's Foreign Ministry has demanded the United States ensure \"humane and proper treatment of Russian citizens aboard the Marinera,\" calling for their rights and interests to be observed. It added that the United States must not hamper their earliest return to Russia.\n\nWashington, however, has raised the prospect that the seafarers will face trial in the United States -- a further source of tension in the days to come.","url":"https://www.unitedkingdomnews.net/news/278796185/us-seizure-of-russian-tanker-puts-shadow-fleet-on-notice","image":"https://image.chitra.live/api/v1/wps/98928ab/17a24ce8-20fb-4461-8a3b-ad78a11223d0/0/NDYxNWZhYWItNTQ-600x315.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-08 00:00:00","author":"Us President Donald","authors":["Us President Donald"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.403}]}
