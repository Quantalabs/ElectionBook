{"offset":0,"number":50,"available":7305,"news":[{"id":276562890,"title":"Celebrating Media Mayhem with the Heckler Awards - Part 4: The Individual Categories","text":"To recognize the breadth of this journalism implosion that we cover daily in the “Riffed From the Headlines” column we are awarding an honorarium dubbed \"The Heckler Awards.\" The flood of media malpractice was so extensive we can deliver the (dis)honors seen in the press in four stages: Industry-wide issues, independent examples of notoriety, and then the final two parts covering the categories seen in the column. \n\nIn this, the third installment we start digging into the categories involving the outlets or named journalists. In each category we have the nominees, with the winner highlighted. Let’s get to handing out the trophies to the degraded news sources or news makers from the past last year. \n\nHOAX & CHANGE - Instances of the press entertaining wild claims\n\nA story brewing in Canada for three years was the claim that government-backed Catholic churches had buried large amounts of indigenous children in a mass grave. The facts now emerge that all that had been found was a community burial plot.Joe Biden repeats the long-debunked “suckers and losers” canard, and Mary Bruce repeats Joe repeating it.After the SCOTUS ruling regarding immunity for a sitting president, Jake Tapper interpreted this to mean a president can now commit murder without punishment.At The Daily Beast the claim was made that Trump is listening to orders from Russia. They arrived at this conclusion by…listening to Russian television broadcasts.\n\nWINNER - VARIOUS OUTLETS\n\nIn the weeks following the election disgruntled media members have grown increasingly angry at Elon Musk. First it had been to blame him for Trump’s reelection, but now it has morphed to saying his involvement in the transition and budget battles means he is now the acting president. This defies the past claims these same fevered brains have made, that Trump is an autonomous tyrant, and also that he is controlled by Putin.\n\nGLOSSARY OVER THINGS - Using creative language to push a narrative\n\n When yet another illegal immigrant was picked up for murder, local station WPRI channel-12 referred to him as someone “unlawfully present” in this country.In a gushing piece after covering a rally for Harris, Michelle Goldberg at the New York Times shamelessly referred to support for the candidate is a “Kamala-nomenon.”A columnist for Newsweek detailed her exploits of foregoing clinical methods to conceive a child and instead taking the unregulated freelance route. Her method of getting pregnant by sleeping around with men is dubbed “Off-The-Grid Insemination”.The court case brought against Donald Trump in New York was nothing less than a circus, with previously discredited witnesses Stormy Daniels and the prior perjurer Michael Cohen taking the stand. Cohen further discredited himself when he accidentally revealed that he had embezzled from Trump. In covering this development, the sympathetic Lawrence O’Donnell explained that Cohen merely was “Trying to rebalance” a bonus he felt he had coming to him.\n\nWINNER - COLUMBIA JOURNALISM REVIEW\n\nThis authority on the media gave the members of the press permission to either avoid reporting objectively on Donald Trump, or to criticize any outlets doing so, by accusing this responsible act of journalism as “sane washing” Trump’s assumed crazed condition.\n\nBy @Jon_Allsop: \"Is the press ‘sanewashing’ @realDonaldTrump?\" https://t.co/irKW1WvJA6 via @cjr— Fred Sternburg (@TooFred) September 9, 2024\n\nGILDED REFRAME - The unsubtle changing of a prior position\n\nIt took the Washington Post 2½ years to get around to admitting its past defense of Dr. Anthony Fauci involved with experiments on beagle puppies had been proven incorrect, as he has now been proven to have backed those studies.On the PBS NewsHour coverage of the Democratic National Convention, Judy Woodruff had to go live to recant her past comments that Donald Trump had brokered a deal with Netanyahu to delay a ceasefire with Hamas in order to hurt the image of Joe Biden.At Axios, media reporter Sarah Fischer had a big story about how the Harris Campaign was running campaign ads with fraudulent headlines from major news outlets. This was significant, especially as the press was flush with reports about misinformation and how it affects elections. Then quickly Fischer came out to almost discredit her piece, saying there was nothing wrong with this act, and Google did not consider it a violation.When the problematic stories of Pete Hegseth drinking while at Fox News had been circulating, Brian Stelter moaned that for his first book on that network he had an anonymous source telling him similar details. He regrets now not having included that nugget he had previously considered unreputable.\n\nWINNER - Caroline Kitchener, WASHINGTON POST\n\nAs staffers at The Washington Post railed against their own publication over the lack of making a presidential endorsement, they failed to look ahead at the reactions from readers. The outbursts had provoked many people to go ahead and cancel subscriptions, with the bleating staff now recognizing they inspired a dire result, with one reporter noting that her own mother cancelled her subscription to her daughter’s paper.\n\nMy mom just told me she cancelled her subscription to The Washington Post. She reads every one of my stories. It was a heartbreaking call.I understand why she did it, but I asked her to reconsider. To anyone who has cancelled or is thinking about cancelling, here’s what I said:— Caroline Kitchener (@CAKitchener) October 26, 2024\n\n1st AMENDMENT STRIKE FORCE - When members of the industry based on free expression look to trample free expression\n\nAfter a former editor at NPR exposed the network’s heavily left-leaning bias, some past comments made by the new network CEO, Katherine Maher began to surface. In one interview she is heard declaring that in the fight against misinformation her biggest obstacle is the 1st Amendment.The Globe And Mail put forth the theory that excessive free speech will only lead to more Donald Trumps to emerge.Cleve Wootson at the Washington Post actually asked Karine Jean-Pierre if Joe Biden had any intention of working to stop misinformation from spreading on social media.Tucker Carlson exposed an effort by the New York Times, working with Media Matters, to pressure Google to limit accounts on YouTube it declares was putting out misinformation. After listing off well over 200 examples the platform responded that none of those constituted a violation of policy.\n\nWINNER - THE BIDEN ADMINISTRATION\n\nAmid all the mewling in the media about the press about how Trump is promised to target journalists and possibly jail those he disagrees with, no one at the same time seemed at all bothered by the fact that Biden’s DOJ arrested journalist Steve Baker, from The Blaze, for recording events during the January 6 riots.\n\nBlaze Media Investigative Journalist @TPC4USA has now been taken into FBI custody for his J6 reportingWatch: pic.twitter.com/OF9WVh26ER— TheBlaze (@theblaze) March 1, 2024\n\nDNC PR FIRM – Sycophantic coverage of the preferred party of the press\n\nOn the NPR program “Left, Right, Center” host David Greene declared that if you did not place a vote for Joe Biden, you were casting a vote against democracy.When Donald Trump was holding a campaign rally in New York City in the spring, the Democratic Party was lobbying local journalists – not to cover the rally in equal fashion, but to compel people to come out and protest against Trump.At CBS News correspondent Weijia Jiang slipped up and admitted that they have been following the lead of the Harris campaign by describing Trump and Vance as “weird” to take away from Trump’s impact.Before stepping down, Joe Biden conducted two interviews with black radio stations, and later it was revealed that the DJs he spoke with had been fed specific questions to ask. In the aftermath one of the reporters lost her job as a result.\n\nWINNER – Kelly O’Donnell, NBC NEWS\n\nIn a gushing report about Joe Biden reprising his visit to the Seth Myers late-night talk show, Ms. O’Donnell - who was at the time the president of the White House Correspondents Association - delivered the White House fluff spin, declaring that Biden’s visit on the show was a complete surprise to the audience. She said this, despite the fact that Biden showing up had already been announced, news of him spending the afternoon with Meyers ordering ice cream had come out, and that actress Amy Pohler was on the show, reprising the previous visit Biden made ahead of the previous election.\n\nPresident Biden made an unannounced stop to surprise the audience at Late Night with Seth Meyers to celebrate the show's 10th anniversary.https://t.co/gDayxinZhA— Kelly O'Donnell (@KellyO) February 26, 2024\n\nDEMO-LITION PROJECT – When outlets drive away their audience\n\nWhen Joe Biden sat for an interview with Jonathan Capehart, MSNBC saw miserable ratings numbers as it landed in third place for that airing.Following the controversy that was the presidential debate, nightly news host David Muir saw his ratings tumble by -12%.After the staff at the Washington Post turned belligerent over the lack of an election endorsement the outlet experienced hundreds of thousands of subscriber cancellations.In the days after the election, the networks of MSNBC and CNN experienced around a drop in audience of -50%. This could not be chalked up to normal post-election lulls, as Fox News over that same period saw double-digit growth.\n\nWINNERS – CNN / MSNBC\n\nThe slide for the two networks only continued, as numbers not seen in decades were experienced. By Thanksgiving both MSNBC and CNN were drawing audiences smaller than the Hallmark Christmas movies. \n\nMSNBC and CNN Get More Coal in Their Stockings As Both Lose In the Ratings... to Christmas Movieshttps://t.co/RpIAHUrjbf— RedState (@RedState) November 25, 2024\n\n DEMOCRATIC CUSTODIAL SERVICES – When the press rides in to clean up messes for their preferred party.\n\nAs it was becoming clear that Tim Walz was suffering bad PR over his tampons-in-boys-restrooms school policies, Monica Hesse of the Washington Post tried to say that any boys providing tampons to female students in need of one would be considered studs in the school.Following a hurricane hitting the state of Georgia, Scott MacFarlane tried to say that Trump visiting the area was not a welcomed presence. Scott had no residents on camera making such a statement, so just take his word on that. Mainly what was happening was Mac deflecting from the fact that Kamala was too busy at a fundraiser to visit the area, and Joe Biden was busy on yet another vacation at his Delaware beach.In light of the story of Venezuelan gangs taking over apartment complexes in Colorado, Martha Raddatz tried to counter J.D. Vance bringing up this detail by saying it was happening in only a handful of locations.After the big dustup made from Joe Biden calling half the country “garbage” in response to a comedian making a joke about Puerto Rico, the press went into overdrive in order to sell the tepid spin from the White House. The claim made was that there was an apostrophe in Biden’s spoken comment, altering his intention to mean he was speaking about either one person, OR Trump supporters who repeated that joke. This was a completely desperate and partisan move in the press.\n\nWINNER - Chuck Todd, NBC NEWS\n\nOn his personal podcast, when speaking with Politico’s Jonathan Martin after the Biden meltdown at the debate, Todd gave a revealing admission he may not have thought all the way through. He stated how he had been in talks with agency officials years ago about Biden’s sliding mental condition, something he never managed to report on in his line of work all that time.\n\nBreaking down what Dems are really thinking behind the scenes with my longtime pal and Hotline alum ⁦@jmart⁩ https://t.co/K9f9aDx2QL— Chuck Todd (@chucktodd) July 10, 2024\n\nCRIMINAL FAMILY ALBUM – When the press tries creating a sympathetic character\n\nFollowing the Daniel Penny not-guilty ruling, Rolling Stone saw fit to describe Jordan Neely, a man with a year- long criminal record with dozens of arrests, as a homeless man who was a Michael Jackson impersonator.Following the deaths of teens in a rollover wreck that occurred during a police chase, the Daily Mail needed to paint the police in a bad light, for being responsible for the deaths of star athletes at the local school. Less focus was placed on the collection of convictions shared by the occupants, that some were wearing home-arrest ankle cuffs, and that the car rolled going 110 mph because they were eluding the police after stealing the SUV.\n\nWINNER – THE WASHINGTON POST\n\nThe clear intent was to paint the police as overzealous in the shooting death of a black driver. The Post gives a highschool graduation photo of the victim, Dexter Reed, but gives less emphasis on how he attempted to hit police with his vehicle before opening fire on the cops. Also deemphasized was that Reed was not in highschool but was 26 years old at the time of the incident.\n\nNewly released body-cam videos show plainclothes Chicago police officers shooting at Dexter Reed, 26. Mayor Brandon Johnson vowed a “transparent” investigation. https://t.co/zJlkDgpm4F— The Washington Post (@washingtonpost) April 10, 2024\n\nBOTH KINDS OF STANDARDS – When the press covers stories based on which party is involved\n\nWhile the press was doing backflips to defend Harvard President Clauding Gay for plagiarizing her thesis papers, the Washington Post tried to make a scandal of former Rep. Mayra Flores allegedly stealing pictures of food from other websites.Politico reported on the Harris campaign tweaking its biography of Tim Walz because of his false war record, but rather than accuse them of deception or stolen valor the problem was said to be a result of Republicans escalating attacks on the campaign – with…facts.On MSNBC, William Cohan came on to complain that millionaires like Elon Musk and Bill Ackman can use their influence to get on major platforms. Cohan is a millionaire. He has his own platform as a founder of Puck News.When Donald Trump dared push back to Judge Merchan in his New York Case, the press loudly declared his criticisms, as well as those from any conservative media, constituted a threat to the norms of the judicial system and threatened our democracy. Of course, the press held no such concern when THEY leveled criticisms at the other judge in Florida with the other court case involving Trump.\n\nWINNER – Jonathan Capehart, MSNBC\n\nIt was rather cute when the Democrats at their convention attempted to appropriate national pride from the Republicans. This was sheer desperation, after lengthy periods of the Dems and the press demonizing the wanton patriotism seen from conservatives. Capehart took it to even more ridiculous levels, saying when the GOP chants “USA-USA” it was exclusionary, but when the Dems did it that was beautiful and had an inclusive ring to it.\n\n\"For far too long, [the GOP] treated the flag, the word patriotism, and chants of USA as their own property...or so they would have everyone believe\" @CapehartJ shares his thoughts after this week's DNC and how Democrats are ready to reclaim patriotism as their own #SaturdayShow pic.twitter.com/I2cpTrsv6y— The Saturday/Sunday Show with Jonathan Capehart (@weekendcapehart) August 24, 2024\n\nDucking The Hard Truth – When fact checkers focus on the trivial instead of the Democrats\n\nPolitiFact saw the need to correct the Babylon Bee joke saying Pete Buttigieg saw the collapse of a bridge in Baltimore as a blow against racism.When J.D. Vance made a joke about the Democratic convention in Chicago meant that Tim Walz will finally visit a war zone, CNN’s Alayna Treene felt the need to correct by showing the site was selected before Walz was picked as Kamala’s running mate.After Trump was attending an NFL game in Pittsburgh, Newsweek saw fit to inform us that despite Trump posting an image of himself in a Steelers uniform, he never did play in the NFL.The New York Times attempted to correct a comment from RFK Jr. on food ingredients, but managed to show he was in fact correct, because the Times got the details about Froot Loops incorrect.\n\nWINNER – Flynn Nicholls, NEWSWEEK\n\nThe manner that Trump causes distemper in the press never disappoints. When a social media post made a clearly gag AI image of the photo from the private jet with Trump and his famous entourage - declaring it to be eerily reflective of a painting from the 1700s - most laughed at the effort. But Mr. Nicholls sprang into action to say the supposed 400-year-old painting does NOT show the men on a plane, and that the artist Dietz Nuutzen does not seem to exist.\n\nA post on social media claimed a work of art painted in 1721 foresaw the President-elect would have dinner on his plane with Elon Musk and RFK 303 years later https://t.co/lqjqsb8gbI— Newsweek (@Newsweek) November 19, 2024\n\nBODY CHECKING THE FACT CHECKERS – When facts elude the viscounts of verité’\n\nWhen Joe Biden sat for an interview with CNN, and told a number of falsehoods, the network fact–checker Daniel Dale leaped into action – to deliver fact-checks on Donald Trump.When Joe Biden was mocked after visiting some blue collar workers and wore one of their hard hats backwards, Snopes did hard work to dispel this claim. It led to the site having to go back and revise things to say he actually was shown wearing the hat wrong.Glenn Kessler tries to dispel the notion that illegals bring in more crime, going so far as to say they have a lower crime rate. He ignores that 100% of them are in fact criminals for being in the country illegally.Daniel Dale came on after Mike Waltz gave a speech at the GOP convention to say the Representative from Florida lied about Biden and electric tanks, and other details. Waltz came on their broadcast later to completely undress Dale - with hard facts. \n\nWINNER - Todd Bensman, ASSOCIATED PRESS\n\nIn the attempt to disprove Donald Trump’s claim that Biden has secretly flown hundreds of thousands of immigrants in the country, the AP seems to forget what debunking entails. While it stated that his comment was called false, the AP showed these flights were happening, confirmed that over 300,000 had been brought in last year. as for the claim the government was hiding these details, Bensman said he “doesn’t consider the program secretive, but finds it ‘enigmatic’ and lacking in transparency.”\n\nFact Focus: Claims Biden administration is secretly flying migrants into the country are unfounded https://t.co/9zTpMregoi— The Associated Press (@AP) March 7, 2024\n\nBLUE-ANON – Press conspiracies, from the press that claims to hate them\n\nRachel Maddow states that J.D. Vance naming his business after a Tolkein character proves that he is a White Supremacist.Alex Wagner spun the odd claim that J.D. Vance having a family plot cemetery on their land somehow is a sign of racism and sexism. Rachel Maddow declares that if he won the election Trump could be installed as president for life.Maddow strained to make a connection to the United Healthcare CEO killer, and Donald Trump. Her effort: Trump appointed Blake Masters to head the ATF. Masters once made comments about Ted Kaczinski. Luigi Mangione once wrote a positive review of a book on the site Goodreads. That book was written by Kaczinski. BOOM - Trump is tied to the killer via the Unabomber! \n\nWINNER – Joy Reid, MSNBC\n\nIn a truly unhinged rant regarding Invitro Fertilization the always logical Reid declares that a ruling in Alabama making fertilized embryos declared human is proof of…we are not sure what. Joy states that this ruling means the GOP says there are too many people here for immigration, but at the same they want more kids, and the reason is to use them as slave labor - despite slavery and child labor being illegal - and this is done to replace the migrant laborers. Which…means that Joy is arguing in favor of slavery, just not if it is child slavery. We guess…\n\n\"The U.S. has a population of 327 million people… why do we need more kids??\"Watch the entire clip. MSNBC's Joy Reid is clinically insane. This might be the most deranged rant I've ever seen. pic.twitter.com/mjd7bU2VCW— End Wokeness (@EndWokeness) February 26, 2024\n\nANTI-SOCIAL MEDIA – Press aggression seen on the social platforms\n\nTaylor Lorenz was shown in a post in a pic from a White House event with Biden in the background and labeling the president a war criminal. After a number of conflicting excuses from the reporter it is believed this led to Lorenz leaving the paper a short while later.After the rollout of Google’s AI generator Gemini was found to lean heavily on portraying historical figures as DEI individuals, Gizmodo described those pointing out the inaccuracies as anti-woke babies. The Disney company was shamed when in a wrongful death lawsuit filed about one of its theme-parks their lawyers stated the company was exonerated because the victim was a subscriber to Disney Plus, and the terms of agreement state the company is cleared of wrongdoing in any of its divisions once you sign up.After the Tom Brady Roast, ESPN producer Sam Bock turned into a male Karen and condemned anyone who might have laughed at any of the jokes. \n\nWINNER – CNN\n\nIn a panel discussion on how Xitter allegedly has become the intolerant hotbed of conservatism, Scott Jennings stated that of the major social platforms, Xitter is the most diverse. When that comment received blowback, he had to inform the members of the CNN panel that the platform was shown to have a near equal balance of liberals and conservatives – as reported on CNN.\n\nThis is amazing obliviousness.Once again Scott Jennings unravels @CNN leftists when he states that Xitter is a balanced forum of ideas. As they try to label him a crackpot he delivers a simple truth - CNN has reported Xitter users are almost perfectly balanced ideologically. pic.twitter.com/ixqZuCauCL— Lie-Able Sources (@LieAbleSources) November 26, 2024\n\nARTISANALLY-CRAFTED NARRATIVES\n\nNBC News says a prehistoric King Kong giant ape was killed off by climate change, at a time that predates the arrival of man. Whoops…Since documentary filmmaker Ken Burns has covered American history, he feels this entitles him to speak on behalf of Abraham Lincoln and declare the 16th president would not approve of the Republican party today.Jen Psaki tried to ridicule Trump for naming the Space Force after the Steve Carrell movie “Space Force”, which was a satirical film based on Trump’s space agency.A Los Angeles Times columnist tries to sell the concept that all of the state’s problems are due to Democrat policies, and the fault for this lies with the Republicans because they are not good enough to defeat the Dems in elections.\n\nWINNER – Shefali Luthra, TIME MAGAZINE\n\nLook, we get that the temptation to demonize Ron DeSantis is strong, and the need to criticize abortion laws is pretty significant for the press. Combine those two realities, and you have a compulsory need to level full blast opposition. But to tell us that the oppressive DeSantis is so mean he is preventing MEN from getting abortions…well, you tend to lose the high ground you thought you had taken over on the issue.\n\nIf Jasper wanted an abortion, he had three weeks to make up his mind, raise the money, and schedule two appointments.

This is not just a one-off. What policy? One by one. Momentum matters a lot at the beginning of an administration,” Halperin continued. “And if they can get some Democrats on board, all Republicans on board, I think unity could be the word of the day going into the fall. If they can’t, I think he’ll retreat back, as presidents do, to the base.”\n\nPersuading Democrats that they are on the wrong side of critical issues is no small task, but I think Halperin is wrong that the onus is on Trump to convince them. The voters sent them the message on Election Day, and if Democrats didn’t get the message, then it’s not Trump’s job to save the Democrats from further electoral humiliation — which is exactly where Democrats are headed if they don’t reassess their radical agenda.\n\nRecommended: You Won't Believe Who Jen Psaki Thinks the Future of the Democratic Party Is\n\nTrump’s transition has been marked so far by what Halperin called an “extraordinarily successful” effort. Trump has the momentum, not the Democrats. And they can either get on board or not. \n\nI don’t doubt that sustaining the momentum of Trump’s transition will require bipartisan cooperation on key policy matters upon taking office, but Trump has majorities in the House and Senate, and if we can get Republicans to be unified, Democrats risk becoming completely irrelevant unless they decide they want to help make America great again or just be part of the resistance.\n\nOf course, Trump’s momentum isn’t assured just because he has those majorities. The recent kerfuffle over the continuing resolution showed that the slim Republican majority in the House isn’t going to be a rubber stamp for him.\n\nWhile it may be practical for Trump to try to convince Democrats to get on board, I think that’s not Trump’s job. But Halperin did get something right. \n\n“What hangs in the balance is whether Donald Trump succeeds in focusing on the things he ran on: Immigration, cutting taxes, cutting regulation, ending the forever wars,” he said. “Those aren’t partisan issues if they’re handled right. Let’s see if he keeps the focus there or moves on to other things.”\n\nIf Trump stays on message about the issues that Americans voted for him to fix, he won’t have to worry about Republican defections, and Democrats can oppose those efforts all they want at their own peril as far as I’m concerned.\n\nIn 2020, Joe Biden ran for president pretending to be a moderate, and upon getting he and the Democrats went all in on the radical agenda in history. The results were catastrophic. So why should Trump have to be the one to extend an olive branch to the party that made a mess of the country they inherited from him?","url":"https://pjmedia.com/matt-margolis/2024/12/27/will-democrats-rise-to-the-challenge-of-working-with-trump-n4935463","image":"https://media.townhall.com/cdn/hodl/2024/347/b2586240-f3bf-4cb3-911c-2ddc77fb0813.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-12-28 01:00:50","author":"Matt Margolis","authors":["Matt Margolis"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.332},{"id":276562350,"title":"Weekend Parting Shot: Have a Coke and a Smile!","text":"Happy Friday, Gentle Readers,\n\nI pray this missive finds you well, having celebrated a blessed Christmas Day and looking forward to a Happy New Year. I've done the New Year's thing before, and at this point in life, Mrs. Brown and I will likely split a bottle of bubbly and turn in around 10. If you've seen one New Year's, you've seen 'em all. \n\nFinger on the button\n\nAll things being equal, Donald Trump is set to make a triumphant return to 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue in January. Although, as I have been warning everyone for the last year, the Democratic Party and its allies are horrified at the idea that the party might be over in more ways than one. The recent shenanigans from Evan Davis and Daniel Schulte illustrate that while their proposition is a long shot, there is nothing these people won't consider, short of unleashing the Bubonic Plague on the nation, to remain in power.\n\nPotential January surprises aside, according to the Post Millennial, the White House staff is getting ready to welcome back the president and first lady, which includes installing The Button on the president's desk. No, not that button. As I understand it, that button is actually a set of codes in a briefcase known as \"The Football.\" The button, in this case, is a Diet Coke button. \n\nApparently, when Trump needs a little refreshment, he presses the button, and voilà, an ice-cold Diet Coke is served up. Number 45/47 is quite the Diet Coke fiend, sometimes enjoying up to 12 cans a day. Hey, you gotta have something to wash down all those Big Macs. If Trump had kept his day job at McDonald's, he could have had all the burgers and cokes he wanted during his shift meal. I guess it's all about priorities. \n\nFun fact I learned today: Once the transfer of power is complete, the White House staff (cooks, housekeepers, maintenance people, etc.) have approximately five hours to turn the residence over to suit the incoming president and family. That's not a lot of time. You would need five hours just to find all of the cocaine left over from the previous first family. \n\nAll in all, it's a pretty fair trade. God only knows what kinds of buttons Biden had on his desk. All things considered, a Diet Coke button is downright wholesome. Now, if you will excuse me, I need to figure out how to install a beer button on my desk. \n\nWine recommendation \n\nBecause I'm installing a wine button next to the beer button this weekend.\n\nI am skipping a sparkling wine/champagne recommendation despite the fact that New Year's Eve is only a few days away. Instead, I offer the 2021 Vicente Faria Vinhos Animus Red Douro.\n\nThis Portuguese red is reasonably priced for what it delivers. Expect to get out of the store with a bottle for between $11 and $14. You would think that, at that price point, you would have to sacrifice taste. However, it consistently scores high marks from reviewers who, unlike your humble correspondent, actually know what they are talking about. \n\nIt is a bolder wine, leaning a little heavy on the tannins, with a good balance in acidity. Expect a healthy dose of red fruits. It is aged for 18 months in oak, so you may detect a little smoke, a hint of tobacco, and even a decent bit of cedar. You may even pick up a little chocolate and vanilla. It starts out strong and finishes nicely. As for pairings, this would go really well with a pizza heavy on peppers. It also works very well as a stand-alone bottle.\n\nThat's it for me. Have a great weekend, and I'll see you next time.","url":"https://pjmedia.com/lincolnbrown/2024/12/27/weekend-parting-shot-have-a-coke-and-a-smile-n4935459","image":"https://media.townhall.com/cdn/hodl/2022/301/cf049be1-eefb-43b3-9283-48feb2bafb7d.png","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-12-28 01:00:50","author":"Lincoln Brown","authors":["Lincoln Brown"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.068},{"id":276562954,"title":"Gareth O'Callaghan: Twixmas is often a time we'd prefer to forget","text":"It’s like a fog that makes us question our whereabouts — a time of reflection, including memories we would prefer to forget. \n\nNo doubt there will have been happier moments on a personal level — God knows, we needed them.

Of that there’s no getting away from.\n\nHumanity comes from the Latin humanitas, meaning human nature, while also incorporating kindness into that nature, or more specifically the kind feelings humans have for each other. It’s a constantly shifting inaccurate measurement of what it means to be both humane and benevolent, and, most importantly, compassionate.\n\nA work colleague of mine — a mother of nine-year-old twin girls — asked me last week how she was meant to explain to her daughters why a doctor is the main suspect in the recent car-ramming attack through the stalls of Magdeburg’s busy Christmas market, in which five people died, including a nine-year-old boy, while hundreds were injured.\n\nHer daughters had watched the news coverage on television. \n\n“I thought doctors were good people,” one of her girls said to her. She had to reassure her most doctors are good people. Invariably, the emphasis here is on the word most.\n\nSusan Sontag, the American writer and human rights activist who died on this day in 2004, once said: 10% of any population is cruel, no matter what, and 10% is merciful, no matter what, and the remaining 80% can be moved in either direction.” \n\nIf 2024 has proved one thing, it’s that brutality is challenging humanity. The biggest danger facing us is the very real probability that a sizeable portion of the 80% that can be moved in either direction is at risk of becoming dehumanised to the shock and awe of what is happening around us.\n\nSo, what if we could see the world through the eyes of a nine-year-old as we say goodbye to the old year and welcome the new? And how is it even possible to answer their questions in relation to truths we can’t fathom ourselves?\n\nAt this age, children are still largely concrete thinkers. They are starting to show they know right from wrong, and that they understand the moral value of rules.\n\nBeing liked and seeking approval is becoming more important, and the ability to think in abstract ways is becoming evident.\n\nNine year olds are cleverer than we perhaps give them credit for. As their cognitive skills develop, their personal beliefs take root. It’s worth remembering here that most young children believe in God. So imagine how 2024 must have impacted the mind of such a child.\n\nDonald Trump\n\nAs a parent, how do you explain that the next US president is a convicted criminal who was found guilty of 34 counts of fraud six months before he was elected by 77 million Americans? \n\nHow do you explain why so many young women voted for a man who has been identified by at least 25 women who have gone on record to accuse him of predatory and inappropriate behaviour towards them, ranging from groping to rape? \n\nWhy is he targeting the poor and the elderly, and the most vulnerable, and those who can’t afford to pay for healthcare?\n\nHow do you explain why a 26-year-old man who is the chief suspect in the shooting dead of a healthcare company boss in New York, who was himself the father of two children, has become a social media folk hero? \n\nThere’s no point even trying to answer this question until you have explained the endemic online culture of prejudice and hate.\n\nWhy are 343 million people in 74 countries around the world on the verge of starvation when we can go to the supermarket every week and buy food and treats? Why doesn’t God provide food and water for all the people who are dying from famine?\n\nWhy have more than 3,000 children under the age of five been killed by bombs and bullets in Gaza over the past 14 months? And why is this territory ranked as the deadliest place in the world for children if the Baby Jesus, the Prince of Peace, was born barely 50 miles away? And if God is Jesus’s father, then why doesn’t he stop Israel’s army from killing the innocent children and their parents?\n\nWhy did an opthalmologist who treated eye diseases and helped people to see again go back to his home country of Syria to become an evil dictator who tortured thousands of innocent men and women? Why would a man who is able to restore sight imprison his own people in underground darkness?\n\nMass shootings\n\nWhy do people in America own guns, and why have there been 488 mass shooting cases there in 2024 alone? \n\nPoliticans vow the most recent will be the last. But it doesn’t work like that. Can it ever make sense to a nine-year-old why a teenager would casually stroll into their school armed with an automatic rifle, which they then use to murder their teachers and friends?\n\nI was first introduced to existentialism when I was 16, during French class in school, and to the writings of Jean-Paul Sartre, his partner Simone de Beauvoir, and later to the German philosopher Martin Heidegger. Existentialism is a philosophy that focuses on the question of what it means to be human. “Hell is other people,” is perhaps my favourite Sartre quote.\n\nWe are up to our necks in an existential crisis right now, and have been for years. Sartre believed being with other people makes us deeply uncomfortable because it reminds us that our existence depends on how they perceive us, or how we want to be perceived by them.\n\nYou’ll know if someone you know is experiencing an existential crisis. They’ll say things like “I’m rethinking my entire life”, or “Eventually we’re all going to die, and everything we’ve ever done in our lives that we think is important will be forgotten forever”, or “What’s the point? No one gives a damn about what I think?” Actually your children do.\n\nAn existential crisis happens when mental pages that once mapped the plot of the story of your life suddenly fall out or go missing. There’s a hole in the script of humanity. It’s when trying to make sense of life proves impossible. Meaning becomes meaningless.\n\nIf we were to step back far enough and take a look at the journey we are on, each of us would see that our lives are composed of a string of existential riddles. These riddles are answered not by words or conversations, but by life choices, decisions, and behaviours which can lead us down the wrong roads — as we have seen above: Man’s inhumanity to man.\n\nWe might think we have years of understanding, but when an existential crisis strikes, our ability to cope with the reality can be as difficult as it is for the nine-year-old who expects her mother or father to have all the answers. Truth is, no matter what age we are, there’s no sense in trying to make sense of barbarity.\n\nAs a new year's resolution, perhaps we should concentrate more on cultivating the humanity in our own lives, rather than becoming hardened to other people's cruelty in an effort to avoid the hard questions. \n\nHappy New Year.","summary":"That state of suspension between Christmas and new year is a time of reflection, including memories we would prefer to forget — there's no getting away from the fact 2024 has been a sad year for humanity","url":"https://www.irishexaminer.com/opinion/columnists/arid-41542492.html","image":"https://www.irishexaminer.com/cms_media/module_img/8873/4436500_7_seoimage1x1_GERMANY_20Market_20135821A.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-12-28 01:00:00","author":"Gareth O'callaghan,Irishexaminer.com","authors":["Gareth O'callaghan","Irishexaminer.com"],"language":"en","source_country":"ie","sentiment":-0.071},{"id":276562948,"title":"Elaine Loughlin: In forming a government, the main parties must not stray towards the parish pump","text":"After a gruelling 12 months which saw politicians campaign across general, local and European elections, not to mention the disastrous care and family referendums, people around Leinster House were tired and just wanted to get to the Christmas break.\n\nThe only sincere pre-Christmas negotiations centred around ensuring Wexford Independent TD Verona Murphy secured the highly coveted chair's position.\n\nThat deal done, TDs have been able to return to their constituencies for some respite before the real haggling begins in January.\n\nBut in hammering out a programme for government with a motley group of non-party TDs of the regional group, the two larger parties must not stray too far towards the parish pump.\n\nThe coming weeks of programme for government talks will be worlds apart from those entered into with the Greens in 2020, a party which placed an emphasis on delivering on reducing carbon emissions, an area that would later cause significant friction within the coalition.\n\nThe 2020 talks, which got under way as covid obliterated any pre-election manifesto promises, came close to the brink of collapse as Eamon Ryan's party demanded a 2:1 split in favour of spending on public transport over roads, a move which was strongly pushed back on by Fine Gael.\n\nWhile the Greens focused on policies that would deliver for the entire country and impact the entire world which is facing a climate crisis, this time around the bartering is likely to be less global, more parochial.\n\nThe people of Galway, Sligo, Tipperary, and Athlone of course deserve to be represented, but coalitions should not be forged on the basis of the number of ministerial jobs that are handed out or commitments given to local projects. This has been the case in the past and has just not been confined to deals hammered out with Independents.\n\nBut as the world enters a very uncertain time, Ireland must remain outward-facing and cannot become consumed by the local issues, especially given Donald Trump's threatened plans to slash corporate tax, incentivise industries to bring production back to the US and impose tariffs, all of which would leave Ireland particularly exposed.\n\nIn its latest quarterly assessment of the economic outlook, the Central Bank said lower Ireland-US trade flows as a result of tariffs or other changes affecting the activities of those companies could reduce net exports, domestic investment, employment, tax revenue and economic activity.\n\nThis in turn could influence future investment decisions by those multinationals, which employ about 11% of Irish workers.\n\nSimon Harris has repeatedly warned of the transatlantic trade shocks that could roll across the Atlantic once Trump officially enters office in January.\n\n“If three US companies left Ireland it could cost us €10bn in corporation tax,” he said while canvassing just days before the general election.\n\n“I’m not pre-empting it, I’m not saying that’s going to happen, I’m not predicting it, but that is the level of risk that our economy is exposed to,” he said.\n\nThe billions of euro earmarked in pre-election manifesto promises could easily disappear if Trump does deliver on his threats.\n\nThe world faces more than just economic uncertainty and negotiations to resolve the world’s most persistent conflicts will no doubt continue in 2025.\n\nIreland has been a leading advocate for the people of Palestine, which has drawn heat from Israel, with the closing of its embassy in Dublin in recent weeks.\n\nBut this country, which has always prided itself on promoting peace and equality must remain resolute in helping to forge a future that provides hope that Palestinians and Israelis can live side by side through a two-state solution.\n\nOccupied Territories Bill\n\nThe passing of the Occupied Territories Bill must be one of the first priorities of a new government.\n\nHowever, there are now concerns the bill may be amended to such an extent that it loses its meaning.\n\nAction Aid chief executive Karol Balfe said the new government must now realise the specific promises regarding trade with the illegal Israeli settlements in passing the Occupied Territories Bill.\n\n\"This has to be a priority, despite the pressure Ireland faces. It’s concerning that we could see some dilution of the essence of the Occupied Territories Bill. This is not what the Irish public wants, or what Palestinians need. The bill must include all trade, goods and services,\" she said.\n\nExternal threats must be juggled alongside the persistent issues within our health service. Abolishing the means test for the carer's allowance is a measure which seems to be one which both the two main parties and Independents will progress. But ensuring people have access to home care services, a commitment which the outgoing government failed to enshrine as a statutory right, as well as guaranteeing respite for those who care for loved ones would bring about real and lasting change.\n\nAccess to services, whether that be patients waiting for procedures or children on long lists for assessment of needs, should also be a core priority, that demands significant investment and structural change.\n\nThe next government will be under pressure to find a solution to the housing and homelessness crisis and addressing the needs of the most vulnerable.\n\nAs the world faces further uncertainty, the number of people who seek asylum in Ireland is unlikely to decline in the coming 12 months, putting pressure on all services.\n\nIt all makes for a lengthy list of commitments that the public deserves to see delivered on before the parochial bartering of local allocations and ministerial positions are discussed.","summary":"From housing to health, there is a lengthy list of issues the public need to see progress on before the parochial bartering of local allocations and ministerial positions in talks with Independent TDs","url":"https://www.irishexaminer.com/opinion/columnists/arid-41542486.html","image":"https://www.irishexaminer.com/cms_media/module_img/8873/4436524_8_seoimage1x1_verona_20high_20res_20142.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-12-28 01:00:00","author":"Elaine Loughlin,Irishexaminer.com","authors":["Elaine Loughlin","Irishexaminer.com"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"ie","sentiment":-0.005},{"id":276562978,"title":"'Live by the spam, die by the spam': Musk claps back at MAGA censorship claims on X","text":"A growing feud between Elon Musk and MAGA supporters unfolded on X, the platform formerly known as Twitter, as several influencers accused the billionaire of silencing them following a clash over immigration and H-1B visas.

He has threatened to impose a new 25 per cent import tariff on Canada and Mexico the same day over concerns about a trade imbalance, as well as illegal drugs and migration issues at the borders.\n\nThe broad strokes of Canada’s plan were made public Dec. 17, including a new aerial intelligence task force to provide round-the-clock surveillance of the border, and improved efforts using technology and canine teams to seek out drugs in shipments leaving Canada\n\nLeBlanc’s spokesman, Jean-Sébastien Comeau, said the ministers will also emphasize the negative impacts of Trump’s threatened tariffs on both Canada and the U.S.\n\nComeau said the ministers will build on the discussions that took place last month when Trudeau and LeBlanc met Trump at Mar-a-Lago just days after Trump first made his tariff threat.\n\nIt was at that dinner on Nov. 29 when Trump first raised the notion of Canada becoming the 51st state, a comment LeBlanc has repeatedly since insisted was just a joke.\n\nBut Trump has continued the quip repeatedly in various social media posts, including in his Christmas Day message when he said Canadians would pay lower taxes and have better military protection if they became Americans.\n\nHe has taken to calling Trudeau “governor” instead of prime minister.\n\nTrudeau had not directly responded to any of the jabs, but on Thursday posted a link to a six-minute long video on YouTube from 2010 in which American journalist Tom Brokaw “explains Canada to Americans.”\n\nThe video, which originally aired during the 2010 Vancouver Olympics, explains similarities between the two countries, including their founding based on immigration, their trading relationship and the actions of the Canadian Army in World War 2 and other modern conflicts.\n\n“In the long history of sovereign neighbours there has never been a relationship as close, productive and peaceful as the U.S. and Canada,” Brokaw says in the video.\n\nTrudeau did not expand about why he posted a link to the video, posting it only with the words “some information about Canada for Americans.”\n\nCarney, who is at the centre of some of Trudeau’s recent domestic political troubles, also called out Trump’s antics on X Thursday, calling it “casual disrespect” and “carrying the ‘joke’ too far.”\n\n“Time to call it out, stand up for Canada, and build a true North American partnership,” said Carney, who Trudeau was courting to join his cabinet before Chrystia Freeland resigned as finance minister last week.\n\nFreeland’s sudden departure, three days after Trudeau informed her he would be firing her as finance minister in favour of Carney, left Trudeau’s leadership even more bruised than it already was.\n\nDespite the expectation Carney would assume the role, he did not and has not made any statements about it. LeBlanc was sworn in as finance minister instead the same day Freeland quit.\n\nMore than two dozen Liberal MPs have publicly called on Trudeau to resign as leader, and Trudeau is said to be taking the holidays to think about his next steps.\n\nHe is currently vacationing in British Columbia.\n\nAlessia Passafiume, The Canadian Press","url":"https://www.saanichnews.com/national-news/trudeau-carney-push-back-over-trumps-ongoing-51st-state-comments-7730920","image":"https://www.bpmcdn.com/f/files/shared/feeds/gps/2024/12/web1_20241227091228-20241227091220-1ffc928a2c627ffaef157c3e89dee3a1cf6c3187bad01a64080d9e59dc5215c0.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-12-28 00:46:50","author":"The Canadian Press","authors":["The Canadian Press"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"ca","sentiment":0.125},{"id":276559742,"title":"Trump asks Supreme Court to delay TikTok ban after meeting CEO","text":"Washington: President-elect Donald Trump has asked the US Supreme Court to pause a potential TikTok ban from going into effect until his administration can pursue a “political resolution” to the issue.\n\nThe request came as TikTok and the Biden administration filed opposing briefs to the court on Friday, in which the company argued the court should strike down a law that could ban the platform by January 19 while the government emphasised its position that it is needed to eliminate a national security risk.\n\n“President Trump takes no position on the underlying merits of this dispute.

If it doesn’t meet the deadline, web-hosting services and mobile app stores would be barred from carrying the app, which amounts to an effective national ban.\n\n Earlier this month, the Supreme Court said it would review the case on Jan. 10 after a federal appeals court sided with the government in upholding the law. Under the streamlined schedule, the justices would have just nine days to issue a ruling deciding the fate of the leading video-sharing app in America with more than 170 million domestic monthly active users.\n\n In Friday’s filing, Trump cautions the court against deciding “unprecedented” and “very significant constitutional questions” on a fast-tracked schedule.\n\n “Staying this deadline would provide breathing space for the Court to consider the questions on a more measured schedule, and it would provide President Trump’s incoming Administration an opportunity to pursue a negotiated resolution of the conflict,” writes D. John Sauer, a lawyer for Trump.\n\n Also at play: the possibility that the disputed law encroaches on Trump’s authority as president to oversee foreign policy. He points to the imposition of a deadline for divestment one day before he takes office.\n\n “As to TikTok alone, the Act makes the determination for the Executive Branch—thus effectively binding the hands of the incoming Trump Administration on a significant point of foreign policy,” Sauer writes. “But the Executive, not Congress, is primarily charged with responsibility for the United States’ national security, its foreign policy, and its strategic relationship with its geopolitical rivals.”\n\n Overall, Trump signals his support for TikTok’s opposition to the law, which he says “exercises an extraordinary power” in effectively shutting down a massively popular platform critical to free speech. He cites the possibility of “inadvertently setting a troubling global precedent” that started when a Brazil court blocked X for failing to deactivate the accounts of supporters of former far-right president Jair Bolsonaro who allegedly spread false information and threats against Supreme Court justices.\n\n Trump argues that the federal appeals court that upheld the law gave limited consideration to the free speech interests of TikTok users. He says the court gave too much deference to national security officials calling for social media censorship. \n\n Government officials and lawmakers have repeatedly said TikTok, which is owned by the Chinese internet company ByteDance, poses a national security threat. Thus far, they’ve offered no evidence that TikTok has provided user data to the Chinese government or that it’s been directed to influence the content users see on the platform. Amid years of congressional infighting to ban the app, lawmakers have failed to pass comprehensive data privacy legislation that would protect all users from companies that indiscriminately amass all kinds of personal information on consumers.","summary":"The filing suggests that Trump may believe that the law infringes on the First Amendment rights of TikTok and its 170 million users.

Roy Barnes, who is representing Willis in the case, told the Associated Press.\n\nWillis slammed the Republican-led probe during a fiery press conference in May, blasting the investigation as “unlawful” and indicating that she would refuse to appear before the committee. \n\nBarnes had argued in a court filing that the panel’s demands are “overbroad and not reasonably tailored to a legitimate legislative need” and that they “seek confidential and privileged information, as well as private and personal information that is not the legitimate target of a legislative subpoena,” according to the AP. \n\nHe also charged that the subpoena should be voided because it was issued after the state’s legislative session was over and violates Georgia’s constitution. \n\n“The law is clear, and the ruling confirms what we knew all along,” Republican state Sen.

The Republican president-elect has already begun negotiating with other countries over his plans to impose tariffs, and he intervened earlier this month in a plan to fund the federal government, calling for a bipartisan plan to be rejected and sending Republicans back to the negotiating table.\n\nTrump has also reversed his position on the popular app, having tried to ban it during his first term in office over national security concerns.

As a result, \"Treasury does not expect that it will be necessary to start taking extraordinary measures on January 2 to prevent the United States from defaulting on its obligations,\" she said.The federal debt currently stands at roughly $36 trillion — which ballooned across both Republican and Democratic administrations.

Warning Nato members he will withdraw US military protection unless they commit to spending 5 per cent of their gross domestic product on defence and start buying more American oil and gas at inflated prices. Insulting Canada by calling it the 51st state of the United States and its prime minister a state governor.\nIs it just Donald Trump being Trump? Previously, the president-elect also threatened to bomb fentanyl labs and deploy special forces to take out cartel bosses in Mexico, which may be construed as a warning to invade another sovereign country and ally.\nHis latest antics even before his return to the White House have galvanised his “Make America Great Again” fans. Others are amused, thinking it’s more sound bites than bullets and bombs, though they can never be sure.\nThe foreign policy establishment in Washington is reportedly aghast. These are the people used to rhapsodising about the US-led rules-based world order and “taking care” of friends and allies.\nMainstream US pundits, both liberal democrats and old-style conservatives, warn Trump is undermining the pillars of American foreign policy, presumably policies and stances they themselves have advocated and now look set to be overturned.\n“Trump’s erratic foreign policy to meet ‘a world on fire’,” runs a Reuters headline.\n“Favouring Foes Over Friends, Trump Threatens to Upend International Order”, says another in The New York Times.\nIt’s too early to say what the yellow-haired one will do. But the cavalier manner in which he threatens allies and challenges some sacred cows of US foreign policy is usually attributed to arrogance and ignorance. That’s true to a large extent; the guy is arrogant and ignorant. On the other hand, foreign policy is not quantum mechanics, even if its practitioners and scholars like to make people think only they have the wisdom and intellect to formulate and pontificate on this sacred art.\nMuch of it is just about rigging the rules and regulations in the international arenas, such as trade and finance, to turn them in your favour, and bullying or dominating others, with wars or subversion if necessary.\nIt’s all done, at least ideally, in the gentler language of diplomacy, so family newspapers may print the stories even if you are committing or enabling the commitment of extreme violence and mass murder abroad.\nAll that comes with the hypocritical pretence that the US alone has legitimate global interests, extending to the two poles of the Earth and deep into the oceans, way up into outer space and across cyberspace. What’s good for America is good for the world, or at least for freedom and democracy, Western values and civilisation.\nIf so, then anything the US does is justified by its own interests and national security, which over time have become ill-defined and arbitrary. However, it’s still necessary to keep up appearances by claiming a nobility of purpose.\nTrump has no time or temperament for all that. He is an amoralist but no hypocrite. He is, in some way, more honest because he is totally transactional.\nIn his business and personal life, he says or does something outrageous because he knows he can get away with it, and by extending the same principle to global politics, because America can get away with it.\nLying and telling the truth are indistinguishable for Trump. He is truly post-truth because the truths and values as ordained by the ruling elites are increasingly being challenged, both domestically and abroad.\nFor many years, critics say the rise and rise of Donald Trump is the product of both a dysfunctional political system and a highly unequal society, not their cause. People turn against the ruling elites and follow someone who openly admits the system is rigged, only to rig it even more once he is in power.\nThe same may be said about the global destructiveness of US foreign policy. Trump is not its cause but its outcome.","url":"https://www.scmp.com/opinion/article/3292493/trump-symptom-pathological-imperialism-us-foreign-policy","image":"https://cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2024/12/27/3605d735-ace7-49ec-b608-7aaaff317514_2c6fccfb.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-12-27 23:32:19","author":"Alex Lo","authors":["Alex Lo"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"hk","sentiment":-0.31},{"id":276549466,"title":"What will China’s new mega dam mean for India ties and fragile Tibetan ecosystem?","text":"Beijing’s approval of a controversial mega dam in the lower reaches of the Yarlung Tsangpo River, which flows from Tibet autonomous region into India, has sparked concerns about the environmental impact of the project, as well as the effect it could have on China-India ties amid signs of a thaw between the two neighbours.\nThe dam is expected to be the world’s largest hydroelectric project and could generate three times the power of the Three Gorges Dam. Its construction will mark a major step in China’s plan to tap the hydropower potential of the Tibetan plateau.\nBut it could also intensify a dam-building competition between the Asian neighbours near their disputed Himalayan border, according to diplomatic and environmental experts.\nState news agency Xinhua said on Wednesday that the Chinese government had recently approved the massive project, which was included in Beijing’s 14th Five-Year Plan for the 2021 – 2025 period.\nThe report did not specify the exact location of the project on Tibet’s longest river, which becomes the Brahmaputra River when it flows into the Indian state of Arunachal Pradesh, viewed by China as part of southern Tibet. The river also flows into Bangladesh, where it is called the Jamuna.\nBut what is known is that the project will be built on a section referred to as the Grand Canyon, or the “Great Bend”, on the lower reaches of the Yarlung Tsangpo.\nAccording to a 2020 estimate by state-owned Power Construction Corporation of China, the dam, located in one of the most hydropower-rich areas of the world, is expected to produce nearly 300 billion kilowatt-hours (kWh) of electricity annually.\nIt would dwarf the Three Gorges Dam on the Yangtze River, now the world’s biggest dam, which was designed to generate 88.2 billion kWh a year.\nXinhua hailed the proposed dam as a “safe project that prioritises ecological protection” and a “green project aimed at promoting low-carbon development” that would help the country meet its carbon peaking and carbon neutrality goals while cutting its coal reliance.\nChinese foreign ministry spokeswoman Mao Ning said on Friday that the project had undergone decades of research, including measures to address risks in project security and environmental impact and prevent negative effects downstream.\n“China will continue to maintain current exchange channels with downstream nations and step up cooperation on disaster prevention and mitigation,” she said.\nBut most experts were far from convinced, expressing concerns about how the project could affect the fragile ecosystem of the Tibetan Plateau, local communities and downstream countries – in addition to its enormous engineering costs and challenges.\n\nFan Xiao, a geologist based in Sichuan province, said the dam’s location was in a rare “biodiversity hotspot” in a geologically unstable area, which could potentially lead to “irreparable damage” to the environment.\nHe noted the area is very seismically active, and building a cascade of mega hydropower stations – involving high dams, large reservoirs and giant tunnels – would increase the risk of landslides and other disasters.\n“The geological instability and the likelihood of geological disasters in the Yarlung Tsangpo Grand Canyon are much higher than those of other rivers in western China, where we’ve seen plenty of instances of negative impacts as a result of cascaded hydropower development,” he said.\n“I’m afraid the construction of the proposed hydropower project would incur unprecedented huge costs and face enormous risks.”\nHe added that a dam-building frenzy in southwest China over the past two decades had resulted in the overdevelopment of hydropower in the region and an oversupply of power due to a lack of market demand, both domestically and internationally.\nFan questioned official claims touting hydropower as “green, renewable and zero-carbon electricity”, noting that mega dam projects were mainly driven by economic considerations and vested interest groups, without proper scientific feasibility studies or adequate public involvement.\n“It remains unclear if the incalculable cost of possible geological disasters, environmental damages, and social and cultural impact has been included in the assessment and decision-making process, or if the ecological and environmental impact on the downstream Brahmaputra River and the plains of the South Asian subcontinent has been fully taken into account,” he said.\nSayanangshu Modak, a researcher on transboundary rivers and water governance at the University of Arizona, said that for India, a major concern was the risk of dam failure during emergencies caused by unprecedented weather or seismic events.\n“This area is highly prone to earthquakes of varying magnitudes due to intense seismic activity from endogenic forces,” he said, noting that a massive glacier collapse in March 2021 near the Great Bend area blocked the river and caused water levels to rise by 10 metres (33 feet).\n“These cascading effects underscore the fragility of the region and the grave risks associated with large-scale hydropower projects,” he said.\n\nThe project has long been a source of friction between China and its downstream neighbours, with India and Bangladesh repeatedly raising concerns about China’s dam construction plan upstream of the Brahmaputra River, a critical source of fresh water for both countries.\nWhile New Delhi may have limited options to prevent China from constructing the proposed dam within its territory, Modak said it would cast fresh uncertainty over bilateral ties, which had been on the mend in recent weeks.\nDays after a meeting between Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Chinese President Xi Jinping in October – their first since a deadly border clash in 2020 – the two sides agreed to de-escalate tensions along their disputed Himalayan frontier.\nChina’s top diplomat Wang Yi and India’s national security adviser Ajit Doval also met in Beijing earlier this month for their first high-level border talks in five years.\nModak said India’s concerns were “both immense and legitimate”, although it was still too early to tell if the colossal dam project would escalate into a new flashpoint between the two countries.\nHe said for China, the hydropower project would showcase “China’s technical prowess and superiority in hydraulic engineering” while “bolstering China’s position as a pre-eminent expert in dam construction – a reputation it has actively sought to export through state-owned enterprises and overseas investments”.\nModak said it was “only a matter of time” before Beijing moved to tap the hydropower potential of the Yarlung Tsangpo basin, where only 0.3 per cent of the total energy potential has been harnessed so far.\n“With the Yarlung Tsangpo River dropping nearly 2,000 metres as it winds around the Namcha Barwa [mountain] and through the Grand Canyon, this area offers one of the world’s most favourable hydraulic gradients for hydropower development,” he said.\n“Its remote location, only connected to the rest of the country by highway in 2013, has delayed such exploitation.”\nModak said India increasingly viewed the water issues surrounding the mega dam through the lens of national security, with Delhi accelerating its own dam construction downstream on the same river.\n“This move appears to be part of India’s strategy to assert its prior appropriation rights, reflecting the competitive and strategic nature of this unfolding scenario,” he said.\nReuters reported in July that India planned to spend US$1 billion to expedite construction of 12 hydropower stations in Arunachal Pradesh in response to China’s planned dam project.\nA 2022 report published by the United States Institute of Peace said China and India were intensifying their competition over Brahmaputra water and dam projects as “a form of territorial demarcation and control along a contested frontier”.\nIt described the so-called Great Bend Dam as the most ambitious and controversial project on the mainstem of the Brahmaputra, where nearly 20 dams have been identified with satellite imagery.\nIndia has planned as many as 150 dams within Arunachal Pradesh since the early 2000s as part of its strategy aimed at “signalling control of not only water but territory”, said the think tank report.\nModak also expressed concerns about the “profound ecological and cultural consequences” as a result of the escalation of the dam-building spree, including the displacement of people in both Tibet and Arunachal Pradesh.\n“Between India and China, one certainty emerges: the region’s unique biodiversity and the heritage of its indigenous peoples will inevitably suffer,” he said.\nIt is ultimately about trust, and it is no secret that China and India still do not trust each other\nLiu Zongyi, foreign policy expert\nNi Lexiong, a Shanghai-based security analyst, said the mega dam project was likely to reignite a war of words between the two countries over whether Beijing was trying to control the flow of the Brahmaputra as strategic leverage over Delhi.\n“There has been a lot of talk about ‘water wars’ in the Indian press. The building of a dam within China may not have been a big deal if the two countries had friendlier ties, but when they treat each other increasingly as a rival, anything could be used as a weapon, including water issues,” he said.\nWhile Beijing insisted that tapping the potential of the Yarlung Tsangpo River was a matter of sovereignty, Ni said a mega dam at the Great Bend may effectively put China in a favourable position in its dealings with India.\n“Intentionally or not, it would effectively create geopolitical leverage vis-a-vis India diplomatically, and it’s not surprising that India sees it as a threat. But it may also deal a blow to bilateral ties, which have just begun to show signs of a thaw,” he said.\nHowever, Liu Zongyi, a senior fellow with the Shanghai Institutes for International Studies’ South Asia and China Centre, said Beijing had taken into account concerns from its downstream neighbours when rolling out the dam project.\nLiu said the impact of China’s dam-building activities on the flow of the Brahmaputra was “not as significant as commonly perceived”.\nHe rejected the notion that Beijing is trying to contain India as the hydropower project is within China’s territory.\nLiu said India’s plan to expedite dam construction in Arunachal Pradesh laid bare its focus on strengthening its control of the area, which China claims as southern Tibet.\n“While India and its Western partners are likely to vent their frustration over the project by smearing China, I don’t think the dam project will have a lasting impact on Sino-Indian ties,” he said.\nLiu added it was possible there would be setbacks in restoring the China-India relationship, especially after the return of former US president Donald Trump to the White House in January.\n“It is ultimately about trust, and it is no secret that China and India still do not trust each other,” he said.","url":"https://www.scmp.com/news/china/diplomacy/article/3292529/what-will-chinas-new-mega-dam-mean-india-ties-and-fragile-tibetan-ecosystem","image":"https://cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2024/12/27/45bc3da1-3aa2-4172-add7-6477e69ff696_bece1c19.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-12-27 23:32:19","author":"Shi Jiangtao","authors":["Shi Jiangtao"],"language":"en","source_country":"hk","sentiment":-0.021},{"id":276549462,"title":"Editorial | US drones hysteria calls for calm heads","text":"Sightings of mysterious drones over New Jersey and other parts of the United States this past month have sparked concern and demands for explanations from the authorities. The sightings stirred such a public frenzy that the Federal Aviation Administration decided to ban drone flying for a month in 22 locations over the northeast US state out of an “abundance of caution”.\nThe ban came after some on the ground were pointing handheld lasers at real aircraft, or threatening to shoot down drones, posing genuine risks. Since the surge in sightings in November, authorities have described the objects as aircraft, helicopters, commercial devices, law enforcement drones, or those flown by hobbyists – and even stars in the night sky.\nThe US has around 1 million registered drones that make 42 million flights annually. The Federal Bureau of Investigation said all large fixed-wing aircraft sightings were found to be manned, not drones.\nA Department of Homeland Security spokesman said it had no evidence of threats to public safety, or of any foreign involvement.\n\nThe official explanations have not stopped the rumour mill. One US congressman said the drones were coming from an Iranian mother ship, a claim the Pentagon rejected as untrue.\nRepublican congressman Mark Green suggested China or Chinese who had entered the US illegally may be tied to the sightings, and mentioned as an example Yinpiao Zhou, a lawful US permanent resident who was arrested this month for flying a drone near Vandenberg Space Force Base in California. President-elect Donald Trump has suggested a government cover-up, an allegation the outgoing administration of President Joe Biden has rejected.\nAll the speculation seems to have provided fodder for active imaginations.\nIt would not be the first time. In 1938, a radio broadcast of The War of the Worlds narrated by director Orson Welles sparked widespread panic when some listeners believed the live-news style reports of Martians landing in America.\nIt is hoped that people heed official explanations and concerns are soon assuaged. Relations between the US and China are complex enough without the weight of unsubstantiated allegations of foreign involvement in incidents that appear to have clear and plausible explanations.","url":"https://www.scmp.com/opinion/article/3292544/us-drones-hysteria-calls-calm-heads","image":"https://cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2024/12/28/b45fb055-0c89-4883-97fa-473b5e1360dc_99e9d5ff.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-12-27 23:32:19","author":"Scmp Editorial","authors":["Scmp Editorial"],"language":"en","source_country":"hk","sentiment":-0.136},{"id":276549242,"title":"LeBlanc, Joly to meet with incoming Trump administration officials in Florida","text":"Finance Minister Dominic LeBlanc and Foreign Affairs Minister Mélanie Joly are in Florida to meet with officials from president-elect Donald Trump’s incoming administration.\n\nA statement from LeBlanc’s office says the duo travelled to Palm Beach, where they planned to use those talks to underscore “Canada’s efforts to combat fentanyl trafficking and illegal migration and the measures outlined in Canada’s Border Plan.”\n\nSpokesman Jean-Sébastien Comeau says they will also emphasize the negative impacts of a potential 25 per cent tariff on Canadian goods, both in Canada and the U.S.","url":"https://www.ipolitics.ca/news/leblanc-joly-to-meet-with-incoming-trump-administration-officials-in-florida","image":"https://old.ipolitics.ca/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/CP173747254-scaled.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-12-27 23:32:08","author":"The Canadian Press","authors":["The Canadian Press"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"ca","sentiment":0.449},{"id":276554096,"title":"What to expect in Ukraine, the Middle East and at the U.S.-Mexico border in 2025","text":"What to expect in Ukraine, the Middle East and at the U.S.-Mexico border in 2025\n President-elect Donald Trump has called for a swift end to the war in Ukraine, which has only intensified in recent weeks.

Related Articles A couple hundred North Korean troops killed, wounded in battles with Ukrainian forces Ukraine claims North Korean troops were killed as they fought alongside Russian forces The intelligence agency, known under its acronym GUR, said Ukrainian strikes near Novoivanovka inflicted heavy casualties on North Korean units. It said North Korean troops also faced supply issues and even shortages of drinking water.Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said earlier this week that 3,000 North Korean troops have been killed and wounded in the fighting in the Kursk region. It marked the first significant estimate by Ukraine of North Korean casualties several weeks after Kyiv announced that North Korea had sent 10,000 to 12,000 troops to Russia to help it in the almost 3-year war. --> --> The casualty disclosure came as the Biden administration was pressing to send as much military aid as possible to Ukraine before President-elect Donald Trump takes over in January.Ukrainian forces launched an incursion into the Kursk region in August, dealing a significant blow to Russia's prestige and forcing it to deploy some of its troops from eastern Ukraine, where they were pressing a slow-moving offensive.The Russian army has been able to reclaim some territory in the Kursk region from Ukrainian forces, but has failed to fully dislodge them.At the same time, Russia has sought to break Ukraine's resistance with waves of strikes with cruise missiles and drones against Ukraine's power grid and other infrastructure.The latest attack on Christmas morning involved 78 missiles and 106 drones, striking power facilities, Ukraine's air force said. It claimed to have intercepted 59 missiles and 54 drones and jammed 52 other drones.On Thursday, Russia attacked Ukraine with 31 exploding drones. Twenty were shot down and another 11 didn't reach their target due to jamming, the Ukrainian air force said.As part of the daily barrage, Russian forces also struck a central market in Nikopol in the Dnipropetrovsk region with a drone, wounding eight people, according to local authorities.Russian President Vladimir Putin threatened Thursday that Russia could again hit Ukraine with the new Oreshnik hypersonic ballistic missile that was first used in a Nov. 21 strike on the Ukrainian city of Dnipro.Speaking to reporters, Putin said Russia has just a few Oreshnik missiles, but added that it wouldn't hesitate to use them on Ukraine.\"We aren't in a rush to use them, because those are powerful weapons intended for certain tasks,\" he said. \"But we wouldn't exclude their use today or tomorrow if necessary.\"Putin said Russia has launched serial production of the new weapon and reaffirmed a plan to deploy some of Oreshnik missiles to Russia's neighbor and ally Belarus. Belarus' authoritarian President Alexander Lukashenko told reporters Thursday that his country could host 10 or more.Ukraine struck back with drone strikes of its own. Ukraine's Center for Strategic Communications said the military struck a plant in Kamensk-Shakhtynsky in Russia's southern Rostov region that produces propellant for ballistic missiles.\"This strike is part of a comprehensive campaign to weaken the capabilities of the Russian armed forces to carry out terrorist attacks against Ukrainian civilians,\" it said in a

Donald Trump’s incoming administration on Friday against resuming nuclear testing, saying Moscow would keep its own options open amid what he said was Washington’s “extremely hostile” stance.\nThe resumption of testing by the world’s two biggest nuclear powers would usher in a new and precarious era nearly 80 years since the US tested the first nuclear bomb at Alamogordo, New Mexico in July 1945.\nRussia, the US and China are all undertaking major modernisations of their nuclear arsenals just as the arms control treaties of the Cold War era between the Soviet Union and the US crumble.\nIn an explicit signal to Washington, deputy foreign minister Sergei Ryabkov, who oversees arms control, said Trump had taken a radical position on the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty (CTBT) during his first term.\n“The international situation is extremely difficult at the moment, the American policy in its various aspects is extremely hostile to us today,” Ryabkov was quoted as saying in an interview with Russia’s Kommersant newspaper.\n“So the options for us to act in the interests of ensuring security and the potential measures and actions we have to do this — and to send politically appropriate signals... does not rule anything out.”\nDuring Trump’s first 2017-2021 term as president, his administration discussed whether to conduct the first US nuclear test since 1992, the Washington Post reported in 2020.\nIn 2023 President Vladimir Putin formally revoked Russia’s ratification of the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty (CTBT), bringing his country into line with the US.\nThe Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty was signed by Russia in 1996 and ratified in 2000. The US signed the treaty in 1996 but has not ratified it.\nThere are fears among some arms control experts that the US is moving towards a return to testing as a way to develop new weapons and at the same time send a signal to rivals such as Russia and China.\nRussia, with 5,580 warheads, and the US, with 5,044, are by far the world’s biggest nuclear powers, holding about 88% of the world’s nuclear weapons, according to the Federation of American Scientists. China has about 500 warheads.\nIn the five decades between 1945 and the 1996 Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty, over 2,000 nuclear tests were carried out, 1,032 of them by the US and 715 of them by the Soviet Union, according to the UN.\nPost-Soviet Russia has not carried out a nuclear test. The Soviet Union last tested in 1990.\nPutin has said Russia would consider testing a nuclear weapon if the US did. Last month,he lowered the threshold for a nuclear strike in response to a broader range of conventional attacks, and after Moscow said Ukraine had struck deep inside Russia with US-made ATACMS missiles.\nSince the Soviet Union collapsed in 1991, only a few countries have tested nuclear weapons, according to the Arms Control Association: the US last tested in 1992, China and France in 1996, India and Pakistan in 1998, and North Korea in 2017.\n\nRussia detains suspect after death of chemical weapons chief Kirillov\nMan shown in broadcast video describing how he carried out killing on Ukraine’s orders\n\nGerman opposition leader vows to boost Ukraine’s firepower\nChancellor chides Friedrich Merz’s willingness to escalate the conflict with Russia\n\n2 weeks ago\n\nSyria’s Assad and family are in Moscow, Russian media reports\nRussia has granted them asylum on humanitarian grounds, reports say\n\n2 weeks ago\n\nRussia wealth fund predicts rise in foreign investments\nInvestors upbeat on end of Ukraine conflict, says Russian Direct Investment Fund head\n\n3 weeks ago \n\nNext Article \n\nSupport our award-winning journalism.The Premium package (digital only) is R30 for the first month and thereafter you pay R129 p/m now ad-free for all subscribers.\nSubscribe now \n\nWould you like to comment on this article?\n Sign up (it's quick and free) or sign in now.\n\nPlease read our Comment Policy before commenting.\n\n Subscribe now for an ad-free experience.Support independent journalism.\nSubscribe now \n\nIran warns US and Israel against retaliation ... \nWorld /Asia\n\nAzerbaijan probe finds Russian missile caused ... \nWorld /Asia\n\nRussia warns the US against possible nuclear ... \n\nSA calls for dialogue as tension rises in ... \nWorld /Africa\n\nWHO head in close shave as Israel hits multiple ... \nWorld /Middle East\n\nRelated Articles \n\nRomanian far-right candidate protests as top court cancels vote\n World /Europe\n\nFrench government falls in no-confidence vote\n World /Europe\n\nRussia wealth fund predicts rise in foreign investments\n World /Europe\n\nTop EU officials visit Ukraine in show of solidarity\n World /Europe\n\nProtests in Georgia spread after state’s move to freeze EU talks\n World /Europe\n\n Published by Arena Holdings and distributed with the Financial Mail on the last Thursday of every month except December and January.\n\n Subscribe now for an ad-free experience.Support independent journalism.\nSubscribe now \n\nIran warns US and Israel against retaliation ... \nWorld /Asia\n\nAzerbaijan probe finds Russian missile caused ... \nWorld /Asia\n\nRussia warns the US against possible nuclear ... \n\nSA calls for dialogue as tension rises in ... \nWorld /Africa\n\nWHO head in close shave as Israel hits multiple ... \nWorld /Middle East\n\nRelated Articles \n\nRomanian far-right candidate protests as top court cancels vote\n World /Europe\n\nFrench government falls in no-confidence vote\n World /Europe\n\nRussia wealth fund predicts rise in foreign investments\n World /Europe\n\nTop EU officials visit Ukraine in show of solidarity\n World /Europe\n\nProtests in Georgia spread after state’s move to freeze EU talks\n World /Europe\n\n Published by Arena Holdings and distributed with the Financial Mail on the last Thursday of every month except December and January.\n\n Science & Environment \n\n Middle East \n\n Other Sport\n\n Companies \n\n Financial Services\n Healthcare\n Industrials\n Innovation\n\n Land & Agriculture\n Management\n\n Retail & Consumer\n Telecoms & Technology\n Trade & Industry\n Transport & Tourism\n Markets Data\n\n Markets Data \n\n Legal Notices \n\n Columnists\n Editorials\n\n Contact us \n Subscribe \n\n Terms & Conditions \n Privacy policy \n\n Careers and Tenders \n\n Contact us \n Subscribe \n\n Terms & Conditions \n Privacy policy \n\n © 2024 Arena Holdings.

He has proposed deregulation, tax cuts, tariff hikes and tighter immigration policies that economists view as both pro-growth and inflationary.\nTraders expect the Bank of Japan to keep its monetary policy settings loose and the European Central Bank to deliver more rate cuts.\nThe yen on Friday hovered at levels last seen in July, at 157.76 per dollar, while the euro traded at $1.042, just above a low of about $1.04 struck on December 18.\nTraders are pricing in 37 bps of US rate cuts in 2025, with no reduction fully priced into money markets until June, by which time the ECB is expected to have lowered its deposit rate a full percentage point to 2% as the eurozone economy slows.\nThe BoJ refrained from a rate hike this month. Governor Kazuo Ueda said he preferred to wait for clarity on Trump policies, underscoring rising angst among central banks worldwide of US tariffs hitting global trade.\nFor now, dominance of US equities in world indices and weaker currencies in Asia and Europe helping to boost exporters have prevented tighter US monetary policy from weighing on global stocks.\nMSCI’s broad global share index traded flat on Friday to remain 1.6% higher for the week, with Wall Street’s S&P 500 on course for a 1.8% weekly gain. MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan was heading for a 1.5% weekly rise. Tokyo’s Nikkei closed the week 2% higher.\nEuropean stocks lagged, with the Stoxx 600 flat on Friday and 0.3% higher this week.\nAnalysts said stock markets could change direction as investors returned from holiday and reassessed the risks of higher US inflation under Trump for pricey Wall Street equities.\n“Credible reasons for excitement [are] balanced by elevated valuations and a host of unknowns. [We] would not be surprised to see (the) Trump rally fade, even if temporarily,” Gabelli Funds portfolio manager John Belton said in a note to clients.\nIn debt markets, higher US rate expectations pulled the 10-year Treasury yield, which rises as the price of the fixed income security falls, to its highest since early May on Friday, at 4.607%.\nThe two-year Treasury yield, which tracks interest rate forecasts, traded at about 4.33%. US debt trends also sent eurozone yields higher. Germany’s benchmark 10-year bund yield rose five basis points (bps) to 2.372% on Friday.\nGold dipped 0.2% to $2,628 an ounce, but was set for a rise of about 28% for the year and the strongest yearly performance since 2011 as geopolitical and inflation concern boosted the haven asset.\nOil prices were little changed, but set for a weekly rise as investors awaited news of economic stimulus efforts in China, the biggest oil importer.

Picture: GETTY IMAGES/TOMOHIRO OHSUMI\n\nTokyo — Honda and Nissan expect big benefits from their potential merger to create the world’s third-largest auto group but intense competition from China raises questions about whether they can make it work in time.\nThe Japanese carmakers said on Monday they had agreed to begin formal talks on a merger. While the outcome is not certain and will depend partly on troubled Nissan making progress in its turnaround, they aim to finalise the deal by August 2026.\nNissan’s junior partner, Mitsubishi, will decide by next month whether it plans to take part.\nThe carmakers are targeting more than 1-trillion yen (R119.7bn) in synergies by leveraging a common platform, shared research & development (R&D) and joint procurement.\nTheir operating profit target of more than 3-trillion yen represents a 54% increase on their combined results last year.\nBut the full effect of synergies is not likely to be felt until after 2030, Honda CEO Toshihiro Mibe told a joint press conference on Monday. The companies need to build up capabilities to take on Chinese rivals by then, he said, or face being “beaten”.\nAnalysts question whether they have that much time.\nThe biggest immediate hurdle for both may be their model line-up. Neither are particularly strong in EVs. Nissan, though an early pioneer with the Leaf, later stumbled. A new EV, the Ariya, was supposed to challenge Tesla’s Model Y but was hampered by production problems.\nHonda has focused more on hybrids and unlike Nissan offers the models in the US, where demand for the cars has surged.\n“Both companies lack compelling EV offerings, and the combined entity would still face the challenge of a new EV model pipeline and R&D in technology,” said Vincent Sun, a senior analyst at Morningstar.\nA standardised vehicle platform would produce cost synergies, but that, too, would take time to develop.\nIt “may take longer than anticipated” to fix the business, Sun said.\nLost ground\nIn China, the shift to electrified cars has seen consumer interest focus on software-driven features and the digital experience inside the car, areas where the Chinese makers excel.\nBYD and other domestic brands have zoomed past legacy carmakers, rolling out EVs and hybrids loaded with innovative software. Both Honda and Nissan have lost ground in China, the world’s biggest car market.\nHonda reported a 15% drop in quarterly profit last month, and has been scaling back its workforce in China. Nissan has already announced plans to cut 9,000 jobs globally and manufacturing capacity by 20% due to slumping sales in both China and the US.\nTurning around their sizeable China operations will entail “significant execution risk”, Dean Enjo, a senior analyst at Moody’s Ratings, wrote in a note to clients.\nBoth carmakers are also focused on the US and Japan. That “significant overlap” means the merger won’t deliver big benefits in terms of geographic diversification, Enjo said.\nHowever, the integration could help them weather any potential impact from import tariffs under incoming US President Donald Trump, Enjo said.\n\nHonda is Japan’s second-largest carmaker, while Nissan is the country's No 3. Combined, they would become the world’s third-largest auto group by vehicle sales after Toyota and Volkswagen.\nThe merger would also be the biggest reshaping in the global auto industry since Fiat Chrysler Automobiles and PSA merged in 2021 to create Stellantis in a $52bn(R972.18bn) deal.\nThe size of the deal highlights the gravity of the threat from Chinese rivals, especially as they have been making inroads in regions like Southeast Asia, where Japanese carmakers were once dominant.\nFor Japan, a threat to the auto industry is a threat to its economic lifeblood, as the country’s influence in once-key industries such as consumer electronics and chips has waned over the years.\nThe technological challenge means that legacy car companies that don’t find new partners risk the prospect of becoming smaller companies with higher capital expenditure and R&D costs per vehicle, analysts at Morgan Stanley said in a note earlier this month, when reports of the potential tie-up first surfaced.\n“Given the industry dynamic, there could be more consolidation to come,” they said.\n\nIt’s official: Nissan, Honda and Mitsubishi to work together\nTrio of Japanese brands sign landmark MOU to explore synergy sharing in a changed market\n\nREVIEW: Mahindra 3XO lifts the Indian brand to new heights\nIt isn’t without foibles but this compact crossover has appealing refinement and a ton of features\n\n2 weeks ago\n\nSix cars that changed into something else in 2024\nThe mutations stand these cars in good stead overall and should be celebrated\n\n2025 SA Car of the Year semifinalists announced\nThe South African Guild of Mobility Journalists has published the semifinalists for the 2025 Car of the Year competition.\n\n2 weeks ago \n\nNext Article \n\nSupport our award-winning journalism.The Premium package (digital only) is R30 for the first month and thereafter you pay R129 p/m now ad-free for all subscribers.\nSubscribe now \n\nWould you like to comment on this article?\n Sign up (it's quick and free) or sign in now.\n\nPlease read our Comment Policy before commenting.\n\n Subscribe now for an ad-free experience.Support independent journalism.\nSubscribe now \n\nBritish car brand MG is back in SA \nLife /Motoring\n\nSix cars that changed into something else in 2024 \nLife /Motoring\n\nMexico to build VW Golf after successful talks ... \nLife /Motoring\n\nJohnnie Walker Blue Label brings the spirit of ... \n\nHonda, Nissan merger decision a race against the ... \nLife /Motoring\n\nRelated Articles \n\nIt’s official: Nissan, Honda and Mitsubishi to work together\n Life /Motoring\n\nHonda Prelude set for US return in 2025\n Life /Motoring\n\nHonda and Nissan in talks on deeper ties, say sources\n Companies /Industrials\n\nNissan boss Uchida in race to save carmaker and his job\n\n Published by Arena Holdings and distributed with the Financial Mail on the last Thursday of every month except December and January.\n\n Subscribe now for an ad-free experience.Support independent journalism.\nSubscribe now \n\nBritish car brand MG is back in SA \nLife /Motoring\n\nSix cars that changed into something else in 2024 \nLife /Motoring\n\nMexico to build VW Golf after successful talks ... \nLife /Motoring\n\nJohnnie Walker Blue Label brings the spirit of ... \n\nHonda, Nissan merger decision a race against the ... \nLife /Motoring\n\nRelated Articles \n\nIt’s official: Nissan, Honda and Mitsubishi to work together\n Life /Motoring\n\nHonda Prelude set for US return in 2025\n Life /Motoring\n\nHonda and Nissan in talks on deeper ties, say sources\n Companies /Industrials\n\nNissan boss Uchida in race to save carmaker and his job\n\n Published by Arena Holdings and distributed with the Financial Mail on the last Thursday of every month except December and January.\n\n Science & Environment \n\n Middle East \n\n Other Sport\n\n Companies \n\n Financial Services\n Healthcare\n Industrials\n Innovation\n\n Land & Agriculture\n Management\n\n Retail & Consumer\n Telecoms & Technology\n Trade & Industry\n Transport & Tourism\n Markets Data\n\n Markets Data \n\n Legal Notices \n\n Columnists\n Editorials\n\n Contact us \n Subscribe \n\n Terms & Conditions \n Privacy policy \n\n Careers and Tenders \n\n Contact us \n Subscribe \n\n Terms & Conditions \n Privacy policy \n\n © 2024 Arena Holdings.

Picture: REUTERS/PRESIDENTIAL OFFICE\n\nSeoul — South Korea’s parliament impeached acting President Han Duck-soo on Friday, less than two weeks after suspending President Yoon Suk Yeol’s powers over his short-lived declaration of martial law, plunging the country deeper into political chaos.\nThe impeachment of Han, the acting president since Yoon was impeached on December 14 for declaring martial law on December 3, has pushed South Korea’s once-vibrant democratic success story into uncharted territory.\nIn a statement after the vote, Han said he was saddened by what the unfolding events meant for the next generation, but accepted the outcome.\n“I respect parliament’s decision and to avoid further chaos and uncertainty I will suspend my duties in accordance with relevant laws,” he said.\nHe added he would await the decision of the Constitutional Court to review the impeachment motion. The ruling People Power Party, which has objected to the opposition-led impeachment of Han, said it had filed a constitutional petition.\nFinance Minister Choi Sang-mok now assumes the role of acting president as the person next in line under the law. He is set to speak to the military chief and consult the foreign minister and acting defence minister, a spokesperson said.\nThe motion led by opposition parties passed with 192 of the 300 votes amid rowdy scenes by People Power Party members who surrounded the speaker’s podium, chanting that the vote was invalid and parliament had engaged in “tyranny”.\nAhead of the parliamentary session, opposition leader Lee Jae-myung of the Democratic Party, which has majority control of parliament, accused Han of “acting for insurrection”.\nThere has been overwhelming public support for Yoon’s removal, opinion polls showed after his martial law attempt.\nThe plan for a vote to impeach Han came after he declined to immediately appoint three justices to fill vacancies at the Constitutional Court, saying it would exceed his acting role.\nUntil just before voting began, it was unclear how many votes were needed to impeach Han. The threshold for a prime minister is a simple majority, while a two-thirds majority is needed for a president.\nSpeaker Woo Won-Shik declared a simple majority would constitute parliamentary approval.\nEarlier, the new acting President Choi pleaded with parliament to withdraw the plan to impeach Han, saying it would do serious damage to the economy.\nThe South Korean won retreated to 1,475.4 a dollar, down 0.53% by 7.07am GMT [7.07am] ahead of the parliamentary vote.\n“Impeaching Han would only mean prolonged political uncertainties,” said Huh Jae-hwan, an analyst at Eugene Investment & Securities.\n“In terms of financial markets, (Choi) taking charge can only be bad news, as it only goes to show that political turmoil is ongoing.”\nThere was a chance the country would plunge into economic troubles comparable to its devastating financial crisis of the late 1990s, said Shin Yul, a political science professor at Myongji University.\nThe vote to determine Han’s fate comes on the day the Constitutional Court held its first hearing to review whether to overturn the impeachment and reinstate Yoon or remove him permanently from office. It has 180 days to reach a decision.\nSpeaking in a preparatory hearing, Justice Cheong Hyung-sik said the court would move swiftly in the case considering its gravity, denying a request by Yoon’s lawyers for a postponement in proceedings to better prepare.\nThe next hearing is due on January 3.\nOne lawyer representing Yoon later told reporters the impeached president planned to appear in person in future.\nThe hearing follows weeks of defiance by Yoon, who ignored court requests to submit documents as well as summons by investigators in a separate criminal case over his martial law declaration.\nYoon was not required to attend Friday’s hearing. If he is ousted, a new presidential election would be held within 60 days.\nEvents since the December 3 martial law declaration have sparked South Korea’s gravest political crisis since 1987, when widespread protests forced the ruling party of former military generals to accept a constitutional amendment bringing in a direct, popular vote to elect the president.\nYoon shocked the country and the world with a late-night announcement on December 3 that he was imposing martial law to overcome political deadlock and root out “anti-state forces”.\nWithin hours, however, 190 legislators had defied the cordons of troops and police and voted against Yoon’s order. About six hours after his initial decree, Yoon rescinded it.\nOn Friday, prosecutors indicted former Defence Minister Kim Yong-hyun in the first move to put on trial an official accused of insurrection, Yonhap news said.\n\nSouth Korean President Yoon vows to ‘fight to the end’ in defying impeachment threat\nYoon hopes allies will rally to support him but this appears less likely after claims about North Korean election hack\n\n2 weeks ago\n\nSouth Korea police try to raid Yoon’s office over martial law\nBanned from leaving the country, the president is subject to an investigation into insurrection allegations\n\n2 weeks ago\n\nWho is South Korea’s ousted defence minister who attempted suicide?\nKim Yong-hyun was one of President Yoon Suk Yeol’s closest confidants\n\n2 weeks ago\n\nSouth Korea’s Yoon ordered army to ‘drag out’ MPs under martial law, officer says\nSouth Korean president is now the subject of criminal investigations on insurrection charges\n\n2 weeks ago \n\nNext Article \n\nSupport our award-winning journalism.The Premium package (digital only) is R30 for the first month and thereafter you pay R129 p/m now ad-free for all subscribers.\nSubscribe now \n\nWould you like to comment on this article?\n Sign up (it's quick and free) or sign in now.\n\nPlease read our Comment Policy before commenting.\n\n Subscribe now for an ad-free experience.Support independent journalism.\nSubscribe now \n\nIran warns US and Israel against retaliation ... \nWorld /Asia\n\nAzerbaijan probe finds Russian missile caused ... \nWorld /Asia\n\nRussia warns the US against possible nuclear ... \n\nSA calls for dialogue as tension rises in ... \nWorld /Africa\n\nWHO head in close shave as Israel hits multiple ... \nWorld /Middle East\n\nRelated Articles \n\nDonald Trump: the comeback kid\n Features /Cover Story\n\nSouth Korea police try to raid Yoon’s office over martial law\n World /Asia\n\nWho is South Korea’s ousted defence minister who attempted suicide?\n World /Asia\n\nSouth Korea’s Yoon ordered army to ‘drag out’ MPs under martial law, officer ...\n World /Asia\n\n Published by Arena Holdings and distributed with the Financial Mail on the last Thursday of every month except December and January.\n\n Subscribe now for an ad-free experience.Support independent journalism.\nSubscribe now \n\nIran warns US and Israel against retaliation ... \nWorld /Asia\n\nAzerbaijan probe finds Russian missile caused ... \nWorld /Asia\n\nRussia warns the US against possible nuclear ... \n\nSA calls for dialogue as tension rises in ... \nWorld /Africa\n\nWHO head in close shave as Israel hits multiple ... \nWorld /Middle East\n\nRelated Articles \n\nDonald Trump: the comeback kid\n Features /Cover Story\n\nSouth Korea police try to raid Yoon’s office over martial law\n World /Asia\n\nWho is South Korea’s ousted defence minister who attempted suicide?\n World /Asia\n\nSouth Korea’s Yoon ordered army to ‘drag out’ MPs under martial law, officer ...\n World /Asia\n\n Published by Arena Holdings and distributed with the Financial Mail on the last Thursday of every month except December and January.\n\n Science & Environment \n\n Middle East \n\n Other Sport\n\n Companies \n\n Financial Services\n Healthcare\n Industrials\n Innovation\n\n Land & Agriculture\n Management\n\n Retail & Consumer\n Telecoms & Technology\n Trade & Industry\n Transport & Tourism\n Markets Data\n\n Markets Data \n\n Legal Notices \n\n Columnists\n Editorials\n\n Contact us \n Subscribe \n\n Terms & Conditions \n Privacy policy \n\n Careers and Tenders \n\n Contact us \n Subscribe \n\n Terms & Conditions \n Privacy policy \n\n © 2024 Arena Holdings.

Bullion gained 0.3% so far this week. US gold futures were down 0.4% to $2,644.50.\n“There remain geopolitical hotspots around the globe, which is keeping gold in play from a safe haven perspective,” said Tim Waterer, chief market analyst at KCM Trade.\n“Between Russia-Ukraine and events in Gaza, investors remain keen on gold in case either situation flares up further.”\nIn the Middle East, Israel struck multiple targets linked to the Iran-aligned Houthi movement in Yemen on Thursday, while in the front line town of Chasiv Yar, in the Donetsk region of Ukraine, Russian drones struck a multistorey apartment building.\nLimiting further gains in gold, the dollar index headed for a fourth straight week of gains. A stronger dollar makes bullion more expensive for other currency holders.\nGold has gained 28% so far this year, reaching a record high of $2,790.15 on October 31 on the back of the Fed’s rate easing and escalated tensions around the globe.\nAfter rate cuts in September and November, the Fed continued with its easing policy in December.

That's not to say he isn't watching this intently -- obviously, he is -- but thus far, President Trump has taken a wait-and-see approach with Congress. I think he is dealing with the same reality that all of us are as we cover this episode, which is that there is grumbling but not outright rebellion. There's frustration with Johnson, but not an alternative.\n\nI think the members of Congress urging Trump to come to Johnson's aid and endorse him again know that if Trump gives a thumbs-up, perhaps a lot of this drama might fizzle. But, if Donald Trump voices his displeasure with the Speaker, we're back to square one as Mr. Pergram reported a moment ago, that puts the House in chaos and paralyzes that body of Congress, perhaps delaying the certification of the election.\n\nMIKE EMANUEL: Part of what makes the job so tough is that if Speaker Johnson embraces his conservative wing, you've got all of these moderates from places like New York, New Jersey, and California, who gave him the majority. So, you risk them potentially losing in two years if you go too far to the right with the conservative base. Is that right?\n\nPHIL WEGMANN: I think that analysis is spot on. Donald Rumsfeld said you go to war with the army you\u0019ve got, and Speaker Mike Johnson has tried to govern with the Republican conference under his control. \n\nCertainly, he is the most conservative Speaker we\u0019ve had in some time. However, if you can only lose a handful of votes and you're negotiating with a Senate under the control of Democrats and President Biden -- who doesn\u0019t want to do them any favors -- this is the type of result you're going to get.\n\nAs we look at this moving forward, I think Johnson was frustrated with some of those topline spending numbers, but the hard reality is that for some of these hard-line fiscal conservatives, Republicans like to talk about fiscal discipline, but they have a hard time putting that into action. A majority of Republicans supported the first CR that failed, and a majority of Republicans also supported a lot of the funding that went to Ukraine earlier in the year. I think the difference now is that you will have unified Republican control and Republicans negotiating among themselves, rather than having to rely on Democrats.\n\nMIKE EMANUEL: And it sounds like Democrats are not going to bail out Speaker Mike Johnson this time if it comes to that. So, he needs 218 \"yeas\" to remain Speaker of the House. Who could get 218 if not him?\n\nPHIL WEGMANN: That\u0019s the million-dollar question here because no alternative has come forward. Like you mentioned a second ago, this is the most difficult job in all of Washington, D.C.\n\nMy question is: does that job get easier when Republicans have a Republican majority leader to deal with in the Senate? What we\u0019ve seen from Johnson is someone with a solid relationship with Donald Trump. Trump endorsed him in November, but he seems to make the Speaker sweat a little bit. Thus far, you know, Johnson was there with the President-elect on election day, and that President hasn\u0019t said one way or the other if he would like to continue supporting him.\n\nRelated Topics: Phil Wegmann, House Speaker , Mike Johnson, House Republicans\n\n Show comments\n Hide Comments \n\n Send Tips\n\n Follow Us\n\n Latest Political Videos","url":"https://www.realclearpolitics.com/video/2024/12/27/wegmann_frustration_with_speaker_johnson_among_house_republicans_but_is_there_an_alternative.html","image":"https://assets.realclear.com/images/67/673645_5_.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-12-27 23:30:27","author":"Tim Hains","authors":["Tim Hains"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.131},{"id":276549340,"title":"RealClearPolitics: Can Anyone Replace Speaker Johnson? Trump's Message to Death Row Inmates, Biden's Final Push for Student Debt Relief","text":"Back to Videos\n\n RealClearPolitics: Can Anyone Replace Speaker Johnson? Trump's Message to Death Row Inmates, Biden's Final Push for Student Debt Relief\n\n | \n\nPosted By RCP RadioOn Date December 26, 2024\n\nThursday on the RealClearPolitics radio show -- weeknights at 6:00 p.m. on SiriusXM's POTUS Channel 124 and then on Apple, Spotify, and here on our website -- Andrew Walworth, Tom Bevan, and RCP White House correspondent Phil Wegmann discuss reports that House Republicans are taking their grievances about Speaker Mike Johnson to President-elect Donald Trump at Mar-a-Lago. What is Johnson doing to keep Trump's support? Is there anyone who could replace him? Do Republicans want to start the new year with yet another leadership battle? \n\nIn the next segment, starting around minute 14, they discuss Teamsters Union President Sean O\u0019Brien giving insider information about how the Harris campaign approached them for an endorsement. O'Brien told Tucker Carlson in an interview this week that the Harris campaign refused to answer most of the questions they gave her, left early, and said: \"I\u0019m going to win with or without you.\"\n\n\"The New York Times has an article out this morning asking 'Will the U.S. Ever Be Ready for a Female President?'\" added Tom Bevan. \"When you look at this Sean O'Brien story, was it really that she was a woman? No, it was that she was arrogant in the way she was treating members of her coalition.\"\n\nPlus, starting around minute 18:30, a look at Donald Trump's message not wishing a merry Christmas to 37 death row inmates given clemency by President Biden and vowing that he will \"direct the Justice Department to vigorously pursue the death penalty.\"\n\n\"He was the law and order candidate, and now he's going to be the law and order president,\" commented Phil Wegmann. \"Biden tries to take a more compassionate position, but he finds himself picking and choosing between monsters. He commuted the sentences of 37 murderers and rapists but didn't commute the sentences of [the South Carolina church shooter], the Boston Marathon terrorist, or [the Tree of Life synagogue shooter]. All of them are bad, but this is sort of a muddled application of principles. Biden has been saying for decades he opposes the death penalty, but as president, he did not make a serious push to try and get Congress to pass a law.\"\n\nAfter that, starting around 23:30, a new poll suggests seven out of 10 Democrats and six in 10 independents are watching less news in the wake of the election. At the same time, FOX News is growing as ratings for CNN and MSNBC decline dramatically.\n\n\"Usually, the people on the losing side are more inclined to turn off their TV and radio and enjoy the holidays,\" noted Tom Bevan. \"What's a little bit different is that after Trump was elected in 2016, there was this immediate cable news frenzy. Trump was very good for cable news as they became part of the resistance. This time around, it's just total depression.\"\n\nFinally, starting around minute 32, Andrew Walworth welcomes RealClearEducation editor Nathan Harden for a conversation about President Biden offering additional student debt relief to public sector employees while giving up on his plan to do the same for millions of Americans in general.\n\n\"I love this statement the White House released. They hoped to expand this further, but they had to eliminate some of the groups they were planning on including, like people experiencing financial hardship or those who had successfully made payments for a number of years, and the reason they gave was 'due to operational challenges in implementing the proposal.' I think what that means is they're only going to be here for 30 more days, and Republicans have rejected these schemes as unfair or even illegal,\" Harden explained. \"They're trying to wipe out as many loans as they legally or logistically can in the time they have left.\"\n\nDon\u0019t miss a single episode of the RealClearPolitics weeknight radio show \u0013 subscribe at Apple, Spotify, or wherever you listen to podcasts.\n\n Recommended\n\n \n\n RCP's Wegmann: Trump Admin Plans To Move Quickly And Then Deal With The Legal Challenges As They Come\n\n December 24, 2024\n\n RealClearPolitics White House correspondent Phil Wegmann on Tuesday's edition of 'Special Report' commented on President Biden's use of executive orders and what Americans can expect with President-elect Donald Trump returning to the White House.\n\nMIKE EMANUEL, FOX NEWS: I seem to remember when I...\n \n Philip WegmannDonald TrumpTom Homan\n \n\n \n\n Teamsters President Sean O'Brien: Kamala Harris Told Us She'd Win With Or Without Us\n\n December 24, 2024\n\n During an interview with Tucker Carlson, Teamsters President Sean O'Brien revealed how each candidate in the 2024 election courted their union for an endorsement.\n\nDonald Trump and Robert F.

Kennedy Jr. as health secretary and Elon Musk co-heading a department of government efficiency, there is concern at what his second term could mean for the United States, and the world.\n\nHe has vowed to Make America Great Again, retreating from multilateralism in favour of power politics.\n\nIn late December the president-elect pledged to “stop the transgender lunacy” on day one of his presidency, and to immediately begin “the largest deportation operation in American history” of illegal migrants.\n\nCould 2025 be the year when our greenhouse gas emissions stop their steady climb around the world?\n\nResearchers are pointing to signs from the world’s biggest polluter China, responsible for 30 percent of global emissions, where fossil fuel carbon dioxide emissions are projected to tick up only marginally this year.\n\nGlen Peters, of the Global Carbon Project, says overall CO2 emitted by burning coal, oil and gas across the world could peak in the next few years.\n\nThis carbon pollution is the main driver of increasingly dangerous climate change.\n\nBut even if there is a peak, Ignacio Arroniz Velasco, of the E3G think tank, said countries cannot afford to “relax”, and should then quickly decrease their emissions to aim for carbon neutrality.\n\nFootball frenzy\n\nIn 2025 the question of football overkill and player burnout will likely dominate amid a supercharged calendar.\n\nThere is the expanded 32-club Club World Cup awaiting players in the summer, when usually they would have had time to recover from national leagues.\n\nAnd this coming after a particularly busy season that sees a much-anticipated extended Champions League — the leading European club competition — in a new format.\n\nAll this is part of a trend in football to ramp up the number of high-profile matches — the next World Cup in 2026 will welcome a whopping 16 more countries, resulting in 104 games rather than 64.\n\nThe spectre of Saudi Arabia will also loom large as the host of the 2034 World Cup pumps more money into the game, with potentially transformative consequences.\n\nOther controversies likely to cause sparks include the continued use of VAR technology, currently locked in a love-hate relationship with players, fans and pundits.\n\nThe largest gathering of humanity on the planet will take place from January 13 to late February when 400 million are expected to attend a spectacular Hindu festival on India’s sacred riverbanks.\n\nHeld every three years, rotating between four different holy places, the Kumbh Mela takes place at the site where the holy Ganges, Yamuna and the mythical Saraswati rivers meet.\n\nClassified by UNESCO as intangible cultural heritage, the mega-festival will involve a makeshift city in the northern city of Prayagraj. The last time the festival took place there, in 2013, it drew 120 million people. 36 people died in a stampede.\n\nHindus believe that taking a dip in Sangam, the confluence of the rivers, will cleanse them of their sins and help them attain “moksha”, setting them free from the cycle of birth and death.\n\nOasis and BTS comebacks\n\nOn the one side, the grisly bad boys of Britpop, on the other the fresh-faced darlings of K-Pop.\n\nBoth Oasis and BTS are set to return in 2025, much to the delight of their fans, after stints off the stage for very different reasons.\n\nLed by the Gallagher brothers Liam and Noel, Oasis will return after a high-profile bust-up in 2009 — one of many — led to a 15-year split.\n\nThe band behind “Wonderwall” and “Champagne Supernova”, songs that achieved anthem-like status in the 1990s, go on a world tour kicking off in Britain and Ireland then heading to North and South America.\n\nIn the initial scramble to buy tickets from official sites, many fans who missed out sought alternative sources — leading to a landslide of ticket scams.\n\nIt will be a very different vibe in South Korea, where wildly popular K-Pop boy band BTS promises to reunite in June after its seven members finish their mandatory military service.\n\nIt is the comeback millions of fans and an entire multibillion dollar industry has been waiting for.\n\nExperts say the megastars’ return to performance and public life could lift South Korea’s cultural exports juggernaut even higher.","url":"https://www.channelstv.com/2024/12/27/five-things-to-watch-in-2025/","image":"//www.channelstv.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/President-elect-Donald-Trump-takes-the-stage__ConservativesGatherInPhoenixForAnnualAmerica.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-12-27 23:29:59","author":"Nebianet Usaini","authors":["Nebianet Usaini"],"language":"en","category":"sports","source_country":"in","sentiment":0.011},{"id":276552596,"title":"Inside Christmas Eve at Mar-a-Lago: Donald Trump DJs $560-per-head celebration","text":"Ivanka Trump celebrated Christmas Eve at Mar-a-Lago while her dad, President-elect Donald Trump, played DJ, according to reports. \n\nIvanka, 43, attended the event at her dad’s private Palm Beach, Florida, club with husband Jared Kushner, 43, and their three children, sources told Page Six. \n\nThe insider added that, “Melania wore a perfectly fitted chic black pants suit with discrete jewellery and her large diamond wedding ring.”\n\nRELATED: Donald Trump Jr, Kimberly Guilfoyle set for bitter $10m battle\n\nAccording to a source, tickets for the Christmas Eve event at the club went for $US350 ($A562)-a-pop.\n\nAn insider said the gathering had “No Elon, no Don Jr and his gf, no Eric and Lara Trump … the family arrived at 7:30pm and left at 9:00pm.”\n\nThe source was of course referring to Tesla mogul and Trump confidante Elon Musk, as well as Donald Trump Jr, and his eldest son’s new girlfriend, Palm Beach socialite Bettina Anderson.\n\nHowever Don Jr and Ms Anderson were spotted the next day at the Trump family Christmas Day celebration. \n\nRELATED: Incredible real estate portfolios of Donald Trump’s children\n\nDonald Trump’s ’starter mansion’ sold for $47m\n\nDonald was said to have DJ’d the Christmas Eve celebration.\n\n“The president played a serious set and was very into the music,” said the source, adding that the presidential playlist included, “Andrea Bocelli [singing the] theme from ‘Phantom of the Opera,’” as well as the 1966 Elvis Presley holiday tune, “If Every Day Was Like Christmas.”\n\n“He closed his set with ‘Y.M.C.A.’ and some of the crowd jumped up and started doing ‘the Trump dance,’” said the source.\n\n“The President-elect [also] started doing his signature dance and the room burst into applause and cheers. \n\n“The ballroom was filled, but not overcrowded, because the size of these holiday events is being limited.”\n\nThe source noted that, “There were no toasts by [Trump], but Ivanka was observed raising her glass and saying something with a smile to her father and Melania.”\n\nTrump has been known to regularly DJ at Mar-a-Lago from his iPad at dinners.\n\nParts of this story first appeared in Page Six were republished with permission.","url":"https://www.heraldsun.com.au/real-estate/national/celebrity/inside-christmas-eve-at-maralago-donald-trump-djs-560perhead-celebration/news-story/a391637b6c0390e448cd4b9a1ff36637","image":"https://www.realestate.com.au/news/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/capi_a391637b6c0390e448cd4b9a1ff36637_f4b108ea84192ede8d97bc873c9603b0.jpeg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-12-27 23:30:00","author":"Belinda Palmada","authors":["Belinda Palmada"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"au","sentiment":0.272},{"id":276544754,"title":"Trump's Canada annexation idea worth exploring -

However, his recent comments can be seen as a shift from the non-aggressive foreign policy that he had preached. Trump set social media on fire with his remarks, such as \"joking\" about Canada being the latest state to be added to the U.S., his threat to take back the Panama Canal and his renewed interest in acquiring Greenland, which is a Danish territory that has time and again made it clear it wants none of it.\r\rDespite such scenarios being highly unlikely, these provocative statements also show a possibility of Trump’s “America First” concept applying to projecting American power across the world to secure the U.S. trade and security agendas. In a post shared on his social media platform on Dec. 22, Donald Trump accused Panama of imposing exorbitant fees for access to the Panama Canal. He warned that unless the fee policy is revised to accommodate the U.S. demands, he would push for the canal’s management to be restored to U.S. control.\n\r\r'United States Canal'\r\rFor various reasons, the canal, a critical trade artery connecting the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans, is highly strategic to the U.S. economy. Any disruption to its operations - unprecedented since Panama assumed control in the 1970s – is expected to trigger significant price hikes on goods imported from China and other Asian nations, drastically affecting supply chains across the entire U.S. coastline. “The fees being charged by Panama are ridiculous. If the principles, both moral and legal, of this magnanimous gesture of giving are not followed, then we will demand that the Panama Canal be returned to us, in full, and without question,” Trump wrote on Truth. In yet another inflammatory move, Donald Trump posted an image on his Truth Social platform depicting a U.S. flag flying over a narrow canal, accompanied by the caption: “Welcome to the U.S. Canal.!” The post further strained relations with Panamanian President Ricardo Martinelli Mulino, who responded forcefully through a video message on his X account, affirming, “Every square foot of the Panama Canal and the land surrounding it will forever belong to Panama.”\r\rThis sharp exchange underscores the growing diplomatic rift sparked by Trump’s rhetoric. His threats to reassert U.S. control over the Panama Canal have sent shockwaves through the global political landscape, intensifying bilateral tensions while signaling deeper geopolitical challenges. The provocative statements – in addition to the Canada and Greenland controversies – have not only negatively affected the U.S.-Panamanian relationship but will also have far-reaching implications for global stability, raising questions about the potential disruptions to the international order and the enduring influence of U.S. foreign policy after Trump’s second entry into the Oval Office.\n\r\rThe Panama Canal, a 51-mile engineering marvel connecting the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans, has been a symbol of American prowess since its completion in 1914. Initially controlled by the U.S., the canal was later handed over to Panama by the end of 1999 following the Torrijos-Carter Treaties. Trump's recent comments have revisited this history, challenging Panama's sovereignty and echoing sentiments of American imperialism in the region.\r\rTrump’s claim of \"ridiculous\" fees and the possibility of Chinese interference in the canal are indicative of high-voltage foreign policy under the Trump 2.0. Trump’s threat to take back the Panama Canal has the potential of having consequences that will affect not only the Americas but also other parts of the world in terms of trade and politics.\r\rThreatening friends and foes\r\rIf Trump attempts to realize his plan, then it will create a strong precedent for how other important waterways should be handled. Trump’s rhetoric is an indication of the possible shift in the U.S. foreign policy to a more assertive and unilateral one. By threatening Panama’s sovereignty and stoking concerns over Chinese expansion in the area, he demonstrates a willingness to go to force to advance the U.S. strategic position. However, such a strategy may have the potential of isolating allies and straining relations with other countries, as well as challenging the norms of sovereignty and territorial integrity that are the cornerstone of the existing world order.\r\rThis episode also shows the increasing rivalry between the U.S. and China for influence networks. Interestingly, China does not have direct ownership of the Panama Canal; a company from Hong Kong manages two of the canal’s ports. However, this is not the first time that Trump has expressed concerns over Beijing’s increasing power in its vicinity. Trump’s statements are in line with the overall discourse on China’s Belt and Road Initiative and its attempts to ensure dominance in the sea lanes.\n\r\rThere are high chances of increased U.S.-China tension over the Panama Canal in the coming days – with a potential impact on the global economy. Countries that currently depend on the canal for their trade relations with other parts of the world, especially those in Europe and Asia, may become mere victims of this geopolitical war. The EU, for instance, has a lot to lose in terms of trade relations, and any disturbance that may occur at the Panama Canal may significantly affect European economies.\r\rJust a populist demagogue?\r\rA more plausible theory, however, is that Trump is just playing the role of a firebrand populist – similar to how he rages and brags against Mexico, China or Canada, for instance – is another way of playing to the domestic audience. Populist demagogues, by the nature of their office and by choice, create the conditions of external threat, whether real or perceived and wrap themselves in the flag as saviors of the nation. From this point of view, Trump’s latest outburst is consistent with his past demeanor. Trump's statement on the Panama Canal has brought back memories of the controversy surrounding the canal and the questions that it raises regarding the ownership of such a critical asset for world trade.\r\rInstead of fabricating conflicts with other nations or targeting immigrants – such as his baseless claim that Haitians are eating cats and dogs in Ohio – Donald Trump should turn his attention to the pressing crises facing the U.S. The nation is grappling with a broken healthcare system, an epidemic of mass shootings, escalating climate disasters decimating entire regions and record levels of income inequality. These issues are far more consequential to Americans than canal fees or outlandish remarks about foreign adversaries. So why isn’t Trump addressing them? Perhaps he’s trying to divert attention from these urgent challenges, or maybe he’s playing to the xenophobic tendencies of his base to maintain political momentum. Either way, this approach does nothing to solve America's real problems and only deepens divisions. It’s a disappointing – and dangerous – display of misplaced priorities.","url":"https://www.dailysabah.com/opinion/op-ed/trumps-canal-conundrum-provocative-rant-or-aggressive-foreign-policy","image":"https://idsb.tmgrup.com.tr/ly/uploads/images/2024/12/27/thumbs/1200x675/361325.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-12-27 23:29:57","author":"Imran Khalid","authors":["Imran Khalid"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"tr","sentiment":0.02},{"id":276544878,"title":"Trudeau, Carney push back over Trump’s ongoing 51st state comments","text":"Two senior members of the federal cabinet were in Florida Friday pushing Canada’s new border plan with Donald Trump’s transition team, a day after Trudeau himself appeared to finally push back at the president-elect over his social media posts about turning Canada into the 51st state.\n\nBoth Trudeau and former Bank of Canada governor Mark Carney, who Trudeau has been courting to become Canada’s next finance minister, shared posts on X Thursday, a day after Trump’s latest jab at Canada in his Christmas Day message.\n\nIt isn’t clear if Finance Minister Dominic LeBlanc, who has repeatedly insisted Trump’s 51st state references are a joke, will raise the issue with Trump’s team when he and Foreign Affairs Minister Mélanie Joly meet with them in Palm Beach.\n\nThe two are there to discuss Canada’s new $1.3 billion border plan with just under four weeks left before Trump is sworn in again as president. He has threatened to impose a new 25 per cent import tariff on Canada and Mexico the same day over concerns about a trade imbalance, as well as illegal drugs and migration issues at the borders.\n\nThe broad strokes of Canada’s plan were made public Dec. 17, including a new aerial intelligence task force to provide round-the-clock surveillance of the border, and improved efforts using technology and canine teams to seek out drugs in shipments leaving Canada\n\nLeBlanc’s spokesman, Jean-Sébastien Comeau, said the ministers will also emphasize the negative impacts of Trump’s threatened tariffs on both Canada and the U.S.\n\nComeau said the ministers will build on the discussions that took place last month when Trudeau and LeBlanc met Trump at Mar-a-Lago just days after Trump first made his tariff threat.\n\nIt was at that dinner on Nov. 29 when Trump first raised the notion of Canada becoming the 51st state, a comment LeBlanc has repeatedly since insisted was just a joke.\n\nBut Trump has continued the quip repeatedly in various social media posts, including in his Christmas Day message when he said Canadians would pay lower taxes and have better military protection if they became Americans.\n\nHe has taken to calling Trudeau “governor” instead of prime minister.\n\nTrudeau had not directly responded to any of the jabs, but on Thursday posted a link to a six-minute long video on YouTube from 2010 in which American journalist Tom Brokaw “explains Canada to Americans.”\n\nThe video, which originally aired during the 2010 Vancouver Olympics, explains similarities between the two countries, including their founding based on immigration, their trading relationship and the actions of the Canadian Army in World War 2 and other modern conflicts.\n\n“In the long history of sovereign neighbours there has never been a relationship as close, productive and peaceful as the U.S. and Canada,” Brokaw says in the video.\n\nTrudeau did not expand about why he posted a link to the video, posting it only with the words “some information about Canada for Americans.”\n\nCarney, who is at the centre of some of Trudeau’s recent domestic political troubles, also called out Trump’s antics on X Thursday, calling it “casual disrespect” and “carrying the ‘joke’ too far.”\n\n“Time to call it out, stand up for Canada, and build a true North American partnership,” said Carney, who Trudeau was courting to join his cabinet before Chrystia Freeland resigned as finance minister last week.\n\nFreeland’s sudden departure, three days after Trudeau informed her he would be firing her as finance minister in favour of Carney, left Trudeau’s leadership even more bruised than it already was.\n\nDespite the expectation Carney would assume the role, he did not and has not made any statements about it. LeBlanc was sworn in as finance minister instead the same day Freeland quit.\n\nMore than two dozen Liberal MPs have publicly called on Trudeau to resign as leader, and Trudeau is said to be taking the holidays to think about his next steps.\n\nHe is currently vacationing in British Columbia.\n\nAlessia Passafiume, The Canadian Press","url":"https://www.abbynews.com/national-news/trudeau-carney-push-back-over-trumps-ongoing-51st-state-comments-7730920","image":"https://www.bpmcdn.com/f/files/shared/feeds/gps/2024/12/web1_20241227091228-20241227091220-1ffc928a2c627ffaef157c3e89dee3a1cf6c3187bad01a64080d9e59dc5215c0.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-12-27 23:29:54","author":"The Canadian Press","authors":["The Canadian Press"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"ca","sentiment":0.125},{"id":276544502,"title":"Latest Episode","text":"Dunya News Video\n\nLifestyle-&-Entertainment\n\nDunya-Headlines\n\nDunya News -
