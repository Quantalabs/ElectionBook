Also Read | Donald Trump Claims He Prevented India-Pakistan Nuclear War Through Trade Deals (Watch Video).\nDr. Monami Sinha, a member of the Standing Committee, said the Political Science PG syllabus came under \"significant scrutiny\" during the meeting. \"The courses that were dropped and asked to be revamped are 'Pakistan and the World', 'China's Role in the Contemporary World', 'Islam and International Relations', 'Pakistan: State and Society', 'Religious Nationalism and Political Violence',\" Sinha, who is also a member of the Academic Council said.\nSpeaking to ANI, Monami Sinha said these papers would either be completely dropped or replaced by other courses. The new courses will then be referred to the department's course committee. The committee will prepare a new syllabus. This syllabus will be presented for approval to the university syllabus panel and then tabled in the Academic Council for approval. ANI reached out to the Delhi University administration, but there was no response at the time of filing this report.\nRecently, Delhi University Vice Chancellor Yogesh Singh informed us that Department heads at the University of Delhi (DU) have been asked to review their syllabus and remove any unnecessary glorification of Pakistan. This statement comes in the wake of a terror attack in Jammu and Kashmir's Pahalgam on April 22.\nHowever, the members of the DU faculty have objected to these revisions in the syllabus, saying \"forced\" changes are retrograde and politically motivated. Dr. Monami Sinha argued that removing these courses undermines academic rigour and geopolitical understanding. \"It is imperative to study Pakistan in detail because, pedagogically, we need to train our students and foster scholarship on Pakistan, as it remains one of India's constant foreign policy challenges,\" she stated in her note. She also cautioned against excluding China at a time when it is emerging as a key player in the Global South.\nAlong with political courses, the committee recommended the removal of unit 3 in MA Geography (semester 1), on internal conflict and religious violence -- including a key text by Paul Brass -- from the course \"Territorial Bases of Politics in India.\" In the Social Geography paper, the Chair objected to the topic \"Distribution of SC Population\", calling for a de-emphasis on caste-related content. A course on vulnerability and disaster was also dropped.\nIn Sociology, the introductory theory paper was criticised for relying solely on Marx, Weber, and Durkheim, with calls to include Indian theorists and joint family structures, Sinha said. Objections were also raised to Kath Weston's reading on same-sex families, with the Chair noting that same-sex marriages are not legal in India. Condemning the recommended changes, Abha Dev, Secretary of Democratic Teachers' Front (DTF) alleged that the academic autonomy of departments has been eroded and this \"should worry all of us\".\n\"Academic autonomy of Departments stands eroded. The dumbing down of courses by revisions centred around \"beliefs\" rather than questions of pedagogy and scientific inquiry is unfortunate. Forced revisions are retrograde and are politically motivated. DU was known for its UG courses. These forced changes will adversely impact students' scholarships. This should worry all of us,\" said Abha Dev.\nMeanwhile, Mithuraaj Dhusiya, elected member of the Academic Council questioned the authority of standing committee, saying the panel can suggest changes but it cannot ask direct departments to remove papers. \"The University administration of DU has forgotten the fact that the University space is meant for a ruthless and dispassionate debate to foster critical thinking; it is not meant to produce conformist, mediocre minds, which can only lead to the cult of hero worship. Instead of cancelling uncomfortable questions, one needs to always engage even with the perceived 'other' to equip oneself with the intellectual wherewithal to tackle the 'other' in the new global geopolitical order,\" said Dhusiya, in a statement.

Trump, in turn, scolded CNN, calling for the firing of reporter Natasha Bertrand and hurling insults and accusations of “fake news” at the network.\n\nCNN’s Jake Tapper went on air Wednesay with a message for the president and Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth: Don’t shoot the messenger.\n\n“They’re calling journalists ‘fake news’ for true stories! They’re calling for an excellent CNN reporter, Natasha Bertrand, to be fired, which is preposterous,” Tapper said. “The Trump administration is also accusing any news media who reports on this intel assessment as not being patriotic,” he later added.\n\nYou can watch the video below.\n\nThroughout Tapper’s segment for “The Lead,” the journalist condemned the Trump administration’s trend of “shooting the messengers in an increasingly ugly way.” The role of the media, Tapper said, is to question authority and press for facts at all times, regardless of any notion of so-called “patriotism.”\n\nFollowing Trump’s order to bomb key nuclear sites in Iran, the president went on to call the mission a complete success, saying the sites were “obliterated.” The DIA’s assessment, however, said that obliteration was far from the truth; CNN’s reporting said that seven people familiar with the assessment verified that it said the bombing “did not destroy the core components of the country’s nuclear program” and merely set it back a few months.\n\nBertrand’s reporting hedges on making any definitive statements on the attack itself. She attributes information to the DIA assessment and those familiar with it while emphasizing that the report was in its early stages.\n\n“The analysis of the damage to the sites and the impact of the strikes on Iran’s nuclear ambitions is ongoing, and could change as more intelligence becomes available,” Bertrand’s article reads. “But the early findings are at odds with President Donald Trump’s repeated claims that the strikes ‘completely and totally obliterated’ Iran’s nuclear enrichment facilities.”\n\nTapper adds that the bombs used in the Iran strike were untested, leading to a natural question of how much damage they can do: “No one is questioning whether this was a heroic and valiant effort on behalf of the United States,” he said. “The key questions for the American people and the world are simply about the degree of success of the operation.”\n\n“Our obligation as journalists is not to praise President Trump or protect his feelings, or to disparage, or to praise him, for that matter,” he said. “Our obligation is to report facts.”\n\nTapper underscored that reporting on government documents like this is a necessary responsibility of the press. The CNN host cited the Pentagon Papers, first published by The New York Times in 1971, as an example proving the importance of unflinching journalism. Reporting on these papers, Tapper said, showed that “officials had been lying to the American people for years.”\n\nThe reporter ended by decrying Trump’s notion that blind support is the same thing as patriotism.\n\n“History has taught us that the most pro-service member action we can take is to ask questions of our leaders, especially in times of war,” Tapper concludes. “That, for journalists, is the height of patriotism.”","summary":"Tapper says, \"the most pro-service member action we can take is to ask questions of our leaders\"\n\n\nThe post Jake Tapper Defends CNN’s Iran Reports, Says Obligation Is ‘Not to Praise Trump or Protect His Feelings’ | Video appeared first on TheWrap.","url":"https://www.thewrap.com/jake-tapper-defend-cnn-iran-reports-trump/","image":"https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/jake-tapper-cnn-2-19-25.jpeg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-06-26 01:04:03","author":"Casey Loving","authors":["Casey Loving"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.2},{"id":335259154,"title":"Iran N-programme obliterated, insists US President","text":"THE HAGUE: US President Donald Trump compared the impact of American strikes on Iranian nuclear sites to the end of World War Two on Wednesday, arguing that the damage was severe even though available intelligence reports were inconclusive. His comments followed reports by Reuters and other media outlets on Tuesday revealing that the US Defense Intelligence Agency had assessed that the strikes had set back Iran’s nuclear program by just a few months, despite Trump and administration officials saying it had been obliterated. \n\n“The intelligence was ... very inconclusive,” Trump told reporters while meeting with NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte ahead of a summit in The Hague. \n\n“The intelligence says, ‘We don’t know, it could have been very severe.’ That’s what the intelligence says. So I guess that’s correct, but I think we can take the ‘we don’t know’. It was very severe. It was obliteration,” Trump added. \n\nSUCCESS OF IRAN STRIKES CRUCIAL FOR TRUMP\n\nTrump has an uneasy relationship with the US intelligence community, and the success of the strikes is politically critical to him. His right-leaning supporters had argued loudly beforehand that such military intervention was inconsistent with Trump’s domestic-focused “Make America Great Again” agenda and his promise to avoid foreign entanglements. \n\nTrump has countered by insisting that Iran must never be allowed to obtain a nuclear weapon - a line that an accurate, decisive attack would support. \n\nTrump said the US strikes were responsible for ending the war between Israel and Iran and compared them to the United States’ use of atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki in Japan, which brought an end to World War Two in 1945. \n\n“I don’t want to use an example of Hiroshima, I don’t want to use an example of Nagasaki, but that was essentially the same thing. That ended that war. This ended the war,” Trump said. Trump argued that Iran’s nuclear program had been set back “basically decades, because I don’t think they’ll ever do it again” and he turned to top advisers to reinforce that message. \n\nBroadly, he has argued that the strikes were much more successful than has so far been reported in the US media. \n\nThe White House on Wednesday shared what it said was a statement from the Israel Atomic Energy Commission - that country’s nuclear regulator - assessing that Iran’s nuclear program had been set back by “many years.” \n\nAl Jazeera quoted an Iranian official on Wednesday saying that the country’s nuclear installations had been “badly damaged.” \n\nHEGSETH AND RUBIO REINFORCE TRUMP’S MESSAGE \n\nTrump, who arrived in the Netherlands late on Tuesday for NATO’s annual summit, was sitting beside Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth, who both also cast doubt on the reliability of the DIA assessment. \n\n“When you actually look at the report - by the way, it was a top secret report - it was preliminary, it was low-confidence,” Hegseth said. “This is a political motive here.” \n\nHe said the FBI was investigating a potential leak. Rubio suggested that those responsible for sharing the report had mischaracterized it, saying: “This is the game they play.” \n\nAll three men criticized media reports about the intelligence assessments. \n\nAt the summit, NATO member states were set to announce their joint intention to raise defense spending to 5% of gross domestic product. \n\nWhile some countries have suggested they may not in fact reach that threshold, the Trump administration has pointed to the expected commitment as a significant foreign policy victory.","summary":"THE HAGUE: US President Donald Trump compared the impact of American strikes on Iranian nuclear sites to the end of World War Two on Wednesday, arguing that the damage was severe even though available intelligence reports were inconclusive.

spending.\n\n“China’s economy continues to grow steadily, providing strong support for the accelerated recovery of the global economy,” he said.\n\nBeijing, he added, was “stepping up our efforts to

That did not happen here,” the brief said. “In fact, the single most relevant federal statute was not considered at all.”\n\nLove true crime? Sign up for our newsletter, The Law&Crime Docket, to get the latest real-life crime stories delivered right to your inbox.\n\nIn Rubenfeld’s view, the Tariff Act of 1930 (the brief does not refer to it as the Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act) “expressly” authorized Trump to impose the “worldwide and reciprocal” tariffs.\n\n“Section 338 of the Tariff Act of 1930 confers directly on the President the power to impose tariffs on any country in any amount up to 50%, ‘whenever the President shall find as a fact that any foreign country places any burden or disadvantage’ on United States commerce ‘directly or indirectly, by law or administrative regulation or practice, by or in respect to any customs, … charge, exaction, classification, regulation, condition, restriction, or prohibition,” said the brief. “As will be shown below, President Trump’s worldwide and reciprocal tariffs—enjoined by the court below—fit Section 338 of the Tariff Act of 1930 like a glove.”\n\n“The reason the court below did not discuss the Tariff Act of 1930 is understandable: the President did not cite that statute in the pertinent Executive Orders,” he added. “But it is well established that an Executive Order may be upheld under a statute not cited in the Order itself. Because Section 338 of the Tariff Act of 1930 plainly authorizes the challenged tariffs, the judgment below must be reversed and the injunction vacated.”\n\nWhether the Federal Circuit would embrace the Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act as a legal authority for Trump’s tariffs — an argument not relied upon by the Trump administration — remains to be seen.\n\nNotably, then-President Ronald Reagan decades ago slammed the Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act as an act of misguided protectionism that only worsened the Great Depression.\n\nFrom Reagan’s September 13, 1986, radio address to America:\n\nThe answer to our trade balance problem is not to close our markets, cut imports, or collapse trade.

Now its battered theocracy and 86-year-old Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei must regroup and rebuild in a changed landscape. Israeli airstrikes decimated the upper ranks of Iran's powerful Revolutionary Guard and depleted its arsenal of ballistic missiles. Israeli missiles and American bunker buster bombs damaged the nuclear programme — though how much remains disputed. Khamenei went into deep isolation in an undisclosed location, appearing only twice in videos as the Israelis had free rein over the country's skies. Also Read | Donald Trump Claims He Prevented India-Pakistan Nuclear War Through Trade Deals (Watch Video). Iran's self-described \"Axis of Resistance,\" a group of allied countries and militias in the Mideast, has been mauled by the Israelis since Hamas' Oct 7, 2023, attack. Foreign support Tehran may have expected from China and Russia never materialised. At home, old problems remain, particularly an economy wrecked by international sanctions, corruption and mismanagement. \"Iran's leadership has been dealt a heavy blow and will be conscious of preserving the ceasefire, which gives the regime breathing room and allows space to focus on internal security and reconstruction,\" the Eurasia Group said in an analysis Wednesday. Also Read | Donald Trump Meets With Volodymyr Zelenskyy, Says Higher NATO Defence Spending May Deter Future Russian Aggression. Shoring up loyalty One thing Israel's campaign showed was how much its intelligence agencies have infiltrated Iran — particularly its swift pinpointing of military and Guard commanders and top nuclear scientists for strikes. The No. 1 task for Khamenei may be to root out any suspected disloyalty in the ranks. \"There must be some sort of purge. But who will implement it? That is the question,\" said Hamidreza Azizi, a visiting fellow at the German Institute for International and Security Affairs. \"This level of distrust that apparently exists now is going to paralyse any effective planning or security overhaul,\" he said. In that atmosphere, rebuilding Iran's military, particularly its Revolutionary Guard, will be a challenge. But the forces have a deep bench of officers. One top survivor of the war, Gen Esmail Qaani, in charge of the Guard's expeditionary Quds Force, was seen in videos of a pro-government demonstration in Tehran on Tuesday. On the civilian side, Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi found himself empowered to the level of almost a de facto prime minister, publishing announcements on even the ceasefire while others in Tehran remained silent. Khamenei also has to rethink the security policy he wove together over the past two decades. The \"Axis of Resistance\" alliances allowed Iran to project its power across the Mideast but also was seen as a defensive buffer, intended to keep conflict away from Iranian borders. That buffer has now been shown to be a failure. Race for a bomb? After Israel's campaign exposed Iran's vulnerabilities, Khamenei might conclude that his country can only protect itself by turning its nuclear capability into an actual bomb, as North Korea did. Iran has always said its nuclear programme is peaceful. But it is the only non-nuclear armed state to have enriched uranium to 60 per cent, a short step from weapons-grade. Many observers believe Khamenei opposed taking that step to a weapon to avoid a war, Azizi said. But now voices within the system demanding a bomb are likely growing, he said. \"We might have already passed that threshold for Khamenei's viewpoint to change.\" Still, any drive for a nuclear weapon would be a major gamble. The extent of damage from the US and Israeli barrages remains unclear, but Iran certainly needs to rebuild its nuclear facilities and centrifuge infrastructure, whether that takes months or years. And it would have to do all that in extreme secrecy, concealed from Israeli and US intelligence. Were Israel to catch wind, it could resume strikes. Khamenei could also take the opposite path, resuming talks with the United States in hopes of winning sanctions relief. US Mideast envoy Steve Witkoff, appearing Tuesday night on Fox News' \"The Ingraham Angle,\" called the chance for future negotiations \"promising.\" \"We're already talking to each other,\" he said. \"We are hopeful we can have a long-term peace agreement that resurrects Iran.\" Challenges at home Many also fear an intensified crackdown on dissent, as a leadership battered by war regroups amid mounting problems at home. Iran's frail economy has been wrecked by international sanctions, corruption and years of mismanagement. For months, the ailing power grid has been plagued by hourslong, rolling blackouts. The flight of much of Tehran's population during the war temporarily eased the strain. But as they return, even longer blackouts are likely to come roaring back during the worst of the summer months, disrupting everything from bakeries to factories. The war also shut down Tehran's stock market and currency exchange shops, pausing a collapse of Iran's riyal currency. Back in 2015 when Iran reached its nuclear deal with world powers, the rial traded at 32,000 to USD1. Today, it is near 1 million rials to the dollar. Once businesses reopen in force, the plunge could resume. The economy has sparked unrest in the past. After state-set gasoline prices rose in 2019, protests spread across some 100 cities and towns, with gas stations and banks burned down. In the ensuing crackdown, at least 321 people were killed and thousands detained, according to Amnesty International.

Nato chief denies using grovelling nickname for Donald Trump - and explains what he DID mean instead","text":"Nato chief Mark Rutte has been forced to backtrack on an embarrassing remark - where he apparently called US president Donald Trump 'daddy.'\n\nDuring a meeting of the defence bloc in the Hague yesterday, Rutte and Trump met following the US president's crass comment on the Iran-Israel war. \n\nIt was there that the US President he said: 'We basically have two countries that have been fighting so long and so hard that they don't know what the f*** they're doing.'\n\nRutte said on Wednesday that 'Daddy has to use strong language' to get Israel and Iran to sort things out, to which Trump agreed. \n\n'You have to use strong language. Every once in a while you have to use a certain word,' the president said. \n\nBut the Nato chief's comments raised eyebrows across the world, and later in the day Rutte, the former prime minister of the Netherlands, was forced to backtrack. \n\nHe said: 'The daddy thing, I didn't call [Trump] daddy, what I said, is that sometimes... In Europe, I hear sometimes countries saying, \"hey, Mark, will the US stay with us?\" \n\n'And I said, \"that sounds a little bit like a small child asking his daddy, 'hey, are you still staying with the family'\"? So in that sense, I use daddy, not that I was calling President Trump daddy.'\n\nBut Trump himself appeared to enjoy being called 'daddy' as he was referred to at Wednesday's Nato Summit in the Hague by Rutte, who has led the defence bloc since October 2024. \n\nDuring Trump's whirlwind press conference that marked his final appearance at the summit, a reporter asked him how he felt when Rutte had referred to the American president as 'daddy' earlier in the day.\n\n'No, he likes me, I think he likes me! If he doesn't I'll let you know and I'll come back and I'll hit him hard OK?' Trump told the journalist. \n\n'He did it very affectionately though,' Trump continued. '\"Daddy, you're my daddy,\"' the president said with a smile.\n\nAlongside Trump was the usually stoic Secretary of State Marco Rubio. \n\nBut the former Florida senator couldn't contain his laughter, bending down and giggling during the back-and-forth. \n\nThe president had previously mouthed the F-word at a campaign rally in 2016 and used the word 'bulls***' while making a briefing room appearance earlier this year.\n\nTrump also said during his meeting with Rutte that he believed the Iran-Israel ceasefire will hold. \n\n'They're not going to be fighting each other, they've had it,' the president argued.\n\n'Like two kids in the schoolyard, they fight like hell, you can't stop them. Let them fight for two or three minutes then it's easy to stop them.' \n\nThe 'schoolyard' comment prompted Rutte's 'daddy' observation.\n\nDuring Trump's press conference, the reporter followed up by asking if the U.S. president viewed 'your Nato allies as sort of children?' \n\n'They're obviously listening to you and they're spending more, and are obviously appreciative of that. But do you think they can actually defend Europe on their own, without you?' the journalist asked. \n\nTrump said he believed the European nations would 'need a little help at the beginning.' \n\n'And I think they'll be able to,' he continued. 'And I think they're going to remember this day and this is a big day for Nato, this is a very big day.'\n\nEarlier on Wednesday the Nato nations agreed to something Trump had long pushed - a massive increase in defence spending. \n\nMost of the 32 Nato countries agreed to language that said 'allies commit to invest 5 percent of GDP annually on core defense requirements as well as defense-and security-related spending by 2035.'\n\nBut Nato member Spain pushed back on the agreement, and said it would increase its spending to just 2 per cent, which Trump said he would respond to by forcing high tariffs on the nation. \n\nHe said he doesn't know what 'the problem' with Spain, calling the country's position unfair to other members of the Nato alliance.\n\n'They want a little bit of a free ride, but they'll have to pay it back to us on trade,' he said, making up for it through higher tariffs.\n\nBut Spain belongs to the European Union, the world's largest trading bloc, which negotiates trade deals on behalf of all 27 member countries. They are not meant to negotiate trade deals individually.\n\nAsked about that, Trump said, 'I'm going to negotiate directly with Spain. I'm going to do it myself.'\n\nThe reporter pressed again asking Trump if the European nations could defend themselves without the U.S.\n\n'Well ask Mark, I think you have to ask Mark, OK?' Trump said. \n\nThe president was previously nicknamed 'daddy' by former Fox News host Tucker Carlson, who broke with Trump recently over the president's decision to bomb Iran's three nuclear sites this past weekend. \n\nThe president has since left The Hague after spending less than 24 hours there for the NATO summit.\n\nThe summit wrapped up Wednesday and Trump held a subsequent press conference.\n\nAir Force One, which had touched down on Tuesday at 7:36 p.m. local time, took off from Amsterdam Airport Schiphol shortly before 6 p.m. local time.\n\nThe flight was expected to take more than six hours, putting Trump back at the White House on Wednesday evening.","summary":"Nato chief Mark Rutte said on Wednesday that 'Daddy has to use strong language' to get Israel and Iran to sort things out, to which Donald Trump agreed.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-14847903/nato-chief-insists-not-donald-trump-daddy.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/06/25/16/99715259-0-image-m-48_1750865509236.jpg","video":"https://videos.dailymail.co.uk/video/mol/2025/06/25/3762217037024246119/1024x576_MP4_3762217037024246119.mp4","publish_date":"2025-06-26 00:55:26","author":"Editor,Perkin Amalaraj","authors":["Editor","Perkin Amalaraj"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.212},{"id":335260608,"title":"India News | Action Will Be Taken Against Persons Involved in Drug Business: Punjab Minister Harpal Cheema on SAD Leader Majithia's Custody","text":"Chandigarh [India], June 26 (ANI): Following the raids by the Vigilance Department at the residence of Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) leader Bikram Singh Majithia, Punjab Minister Harpal Singh Cheema said that Aam Aadmi Party government is fighting against drug menace and action will be taken against any person involved in the drug business.\n\"A big campaign, 'Yudh Nashe Ke Viruddh', is going on in Punjab.

Once tickets were issued in the victims' names, the syndicate would later initiate fraudulent cancellation procedures by impersonating the customers. They submitted forged documentation, including fabricated death and medical certificates, to airlines in order to secure full refunds, police said. The illicit proceeds were partially returned to the victims--after deducting fictitious cancellation fees--or withheld entirely. Preliminary forensic analysis of seized electronic devices has revealed hundreds of forged documents used to facilitate these fraudulent claims.\nA formal investigation was initiated with the registration of FIR under various sections of IT Act, at PS Special Cell, Delhi.

In blunt testimony before Congress Wednesday, Lake declared the U.S. Agency for Global Media (USAGM), the $950 million agency for which she is the senior advisor overseeing Voice of America (VOA), is \"rotten to the core\" and on track to be gutted by 2026. \"This place is rotten. It’s rotten to the core,\" Lake told the House Oversight Committee. \"President Trump has asked me to go in and help clean it up, and he’s also issued an executive order to reduce this agency down to its mandate, to what is mandated, statutorily required. That’s exactly what I’m doing. I don’t care if they attack me.\" She’s not acting alone. Lake provided Fox News Digital with a letter from House Oversight Chair James Comer, R-Ky., and Rep.

It’s possible. We’re working to try to figure that out.\" She accused the grantees — including VOA, Radio Free Asia and the Open Technology Fund — of resisting oversight and stonewalling basic financial reviews. \"Nearly $400 million, the hard-earned taxpayer dollars of hard-working American people, are going to these grantees, and they’ve stonewalled us from getting any information until the eleventh hour,\" Lake said. \"Finally, last night, knowing I would be sitting here, they finally agreed to say, ‘Oh, we’ll let you look at our books now.’ It’s a joke what’s going on.\" Lake found no shortage of support from Republicans on the committee, including Rep. Tim Burchett, R-Tenn., who said the agency should’ve been shut down years ago. \"We might as well be riding a Model T down the middle of the street. It might be ... it looks good, and it brings back old memories, but, dadgum, it’s not very efficient,\" Burchett said. Lake agreed, adding, \"It’s a relic.\" Democrats accused Lake of dismantling a strategic asset and repeating anti-VOA rhetoric similar to that used by China. Rep. Madeleine Dean, D-Pa., said, \"You just want to reduce it to its statutory minimum. And then you said … that it will be gone by 2026. You want it gone. The president wants it gone by 2026. ... You’re a propaganda machine for the Trump administration.\" Dean said she had \"no questions\" for Lake, adding, \"You have misled this committee. ... You’ve lost your credibility. You have poured it out in buckets.\" Rep.

And I don’t trust those numbers.\" Johnson shot back, \"That’s a sad state of affairs when you don’t trust the government that you’re representing.\" Lake defended the cuts, saying they follow the law and common sense. \"We are doing what is statutorily required,\" she said. \"The statutory minimum President Trump put forth in his executive order ... and that’s what we’re going to do.\" Rep. Young Kim, R-Calif., expressed concern that cutting grantee staff could weaken U.S. influence in hot spots like Iran and North Korea. \"We can do it with a smaller staff.,\" Lake replied. \"This newsroom should have been downsized a long time ago. … It’s over.

I congratulated President Trump on the successful operation in the Middle East. It is important that the U.S. actions have weakened not only their nuclear program but also their drone production capabilities. We will continue to keep an eye on the situation,\" Zelenskyy stated. One of the key themes of the meeting was Ukraine's growing urgency to strengthen its air defence systems amid continued Russian missile and drone strikes.\nAlso Read | Donald Trump Meets With Volodymyr Zelenskyy, Says Higher NATO Defence Spending May Deter Future Russian Aggression.\nZelenskyy confirmed that Ukraine is actively pursuing the purchase of US-made air defence systems to protect its cities, critical infrastructure, churches, and civilian population, also urging broader European cooperation in this effort.\nThe two leaders also discussed the potential for US-Ukraine co-production of drones, as Kyiv seeks to enhance its domestic defence industry while simultaneously contributing to Western security supply chains.\nhttps://x.com/ZelenskyyUa/status/1937904978045149579\nThe Ukrainian president also informed Trump about the recent technical meetings held in Istanbul, which included discussions on humanitarian issues such as the exchange of prisoners and repatriation of the fallen.\n\"We discussed the protection of our people with the President -- first and foremost, the purchase of American air defence systems to shield our cities, our people, churches, and infrastructure.

We can strengthen each other,\" he said. \"I also informed the President about how the technical team's meetings in Istanbul went, as well as the exchanges of prisoners and the fallen.

Putin is definitely not winning. I presented the President with the facts about what is really happening on the ground. Thank you for the meeting and your support. I'm also grateful for the truly kind words about our people.

A separate Russian assault killed two individuals in the city of Samara.\nRussia also reported intercepting dozens of drones overnight across various regions, including the border-area Voronezh region, with Russian forces announcing they had taken control of the village of Dyliivka in eastern Ukraine's Donetsk region--a long-contested battleground since the conflict first erupted in 2014, as reported by Al Jazeera.\nMeanwhile, the member states of NATO have committed to ramping up their defence spending by investing 5 per cent of their country's GDP annually on \"core defence requirements\" as well as defence- and security-related sectors by 2035, to bolster their military capabilities, particularly against the long-term threat posed by Russia and the persistent challenge of terrorism.

If elected in November, the 33-year-old would become the first Muslim mayor in New York City’s history. \n\nAccording to city officials, Mr Mamdani had taken 43 per cent of the vote with 95 per cent of ballots counted. Mr Cuomo, who was at around 36 per cent, confirmed to supporters he had called his rival and conceded — and appeared to have no chance to catch his rival. \n\nMr Mamdani’s triumph was widely celebrated by Democrats and New Yorkers – but not by the US President, who weighed in on the political upset in his former hometown in a series of furious Truth Social posts. \n\n“It’s finally happened, the Democrats have crossed the line,” Mr Trump wrote. \n\n“Zohran Mamdani, a 100% Communist Lunatic, has just won the Dem Primary, and is on his way to becoming Mayor. We’ve had Radical Lefties before, but this is getting a little ridiculous. \n\n“He looks TERRIBLE, his voice is grating, he’s not very smart, he’s got AOC+3, Dummies ALL backing him, and even our Great Palestinian Senator, Cryin’ Chuck Schumer, is groveling (sic) over him. Yes, this is a big moment in the History of our Country!”\n\nMr Schumer, who is US Senate minority leader, is Jewish and not of Palestinian heritage. Mr Trump’s “AOC+3” is in reference to the so-called progressive squad in Congress that includes New York Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. \n\nIn a follow-up post, Mr Trump declared Ms Ocasio-Cortez an “Low IQ Candidate”.\n\n“Added together with our future Communist Mayor of New York City, Zohran Mamdani, and our Country is really SCREWED!,” he declared. \n\nProminent conservative activists, meanwhile, targeted Mr Mamdani’s Muslim faith, tying him to 9/11 in a barrage of vile xenophobic attacks. \n\nMAGA-aligned social media personality Laura Loomer claimed that “New York City will be destroyed” and that the city “is about to see 9/11 2.0”. \n\n“If the Muslim Brotherhood would have been designated as a terrorist org, @ZohranKMamdani could have been prevented from running for office,” Loomer wrote.\n\n“Get ready for Muslims to start committing jihad all over New York.” \n\nConservative activist Charlie Kirk also invoked the September 11 Al-Qaeda attacks. \n\n“24 years ago a group of Muslims killed 2,753 people on 9/11,” he wrote. \n\n“Now a Muslim Socialist is on pace to run New York City.” \n\nWhile Donald Trump Jr declared that “New York City has fallen”. \n\nIn the closing days of the race, Mr Mamdani remarked on the countless attacks he’d faced because of his religion. \n\n“I get messages that say, ‘The only good Muslim is a dead Muslim’,” he said at a press conference. “I get threats on my life, on the people that I love. And I try not to talk about it.”\n\nIn his victory speech on Wednesday, Mr Mamdani said: “Tonight we made history”, adding that New Yorkers “have stood up for a city they can afford”. \n\nThat Mr Mamdani, the son of Indian immigrants, has also spoken out for Palestinians and accused Israel of “genocide” in its ongoing assault on Gaza makes him a prime target for the President and the Republican faithful. \n\nHis success has been seen as a rebuke to Democratic centrists who backed the powerful Mr Cuomo, as the party flails nationally in search of a way to counter the President’s hard-right movement. Democrats have struggled to make their case as a credible alternative to Republicans since Kamala Harris’s 2024 defeat to Mr Trump — seen in part as repudiation of identity politics and so-called “woke” ideology.\n\n“It’s a political earthquake,” director of the Marist University Institute for Public Opinion, Lee Miringoff, told The New York Post. \n\n“An unknown defeating Andrew Cuomo is a changing of the guard. More Democratic voters are younger, and their views have to be taken into account.” \n\nDemocratic consultant Trip Yang described it to The New York Times as “the biggest upset in modern New York City history”. \n\n“The race shows Democratic voters are growing tired of the same old faces and they’re willing to bet on newcomers,” said political strategist Andrew Koneschusky, a top former Democratic Senate aide.\n\n“Looking ahead, we may see more competitive Democratic primaries and more upsets like this. That’s bad news for establishment Democrats, but can be good for the party overall.”","summary":"The US President unleashed on the unlikely victor of New York City’s Democratic mayoral primary race, blasting his politics and “terrible” looks.","url":"https://www.news.com.au/world/north-america/us-politics/communist-lunatic-donald-trump-slams-zohran-mamdanis-nyc-mayoral-primary-win/news-story/dde9a202f51541fdc0067679ddcd248d?from=rss-basic","image":"https://content.api.news/v3/images/bin/4670331ecf8306337bacfdaf30330c61","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-06-26 00:48:01","author":"Natalie Brown","authors":["Natalie Brown"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"au","sentiment":-0.132},{"id":335260614,"title":"World News | France Congratulates India as Group Captain Shubhanshu Shukla Makes History with Axiom-4 Mission","text":"New Delhi [India], June 26 (ANI): The French Embassy in India on Wednesday congratulated the country on a historic achievement, as Group Captain Shubhanshu Shukla embarked on a journey to the International Space Station as part of Axiom Mission 4.\nGroup Captain Shukla, an Indian Air Force officer, is part of the international crew aboard Axiom Mission 4, launched earlier in the day.

You should know that we can eat Queens boys for breakfast. Respectfully,' AOC wrote to X in regards to the president's Queens upbringing. \n\nBut Slater escalated the debate by unveiling a yearbook photo of her as a high school freshman in the affluent suburb of Yorktown, Westchester County - a 40-minute drive from the Bronx.\n\n'If you're a BX girl then why are you in my Yorktown yearbook?' Slater wrote on X. 'Give it up already.'\n\nAlongside his tweet, the Republican lawmaker posted two images: a black-and-white throwback of a young, smiling AOC, and the 2004 yearbook cover from Yorktown High School.\n\nIn a statement to The New York Post, he dismissed the 'AOC-Bronx mythology' as 'laughable,' adding that the claim is just as laughable to the 36,000 residents of the Westchester community. \n\n'The truth is AOC is Sandy Cortez who went to Yorktown High School and lived at the corner of Friends Road and Longvue Street,' Slater told the outlet.\n\n'She may think it makes her look tough or like some kind of champion for the radical left who voted for Zohran Mamdani, but she really needs to come clean and drop the act,' he added. \n\nThe takedown came shortly after AOC - who represents parts of both the Bronx and Queens - called for Trump's impeachment following his order to deploy a dozen 30,000-pound 'bunker buster' bombs that reportedly 'obliterated' Iran's three largest nuclear facilities. \n\n'The president's disastrous decision to bomb Iran without authorization is a grave violation of the Constitution and Congressional War Powers,' she said on Saturday.\n\n'He has impulsively risked launching a war that may ensnare us for generations. It is absolutely and clearly grounds for impeachment.'\n\nTrump swiftly fired back, challenging her to 'go ahead and try impeaching me, again.'\n\n'Stupid AOC, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, one of the 'dumbest' people in Congress, is now calling for my Impeachment, despite the fact that the Crooked and Corrupt Democrats have already done that twice before,' he wrote in retaliation.\n\nTrump then noted that the liberal firebrand 'can't stand the concept of our country being successful again,' because members of her party 'aren't used to winning.'\n\nAfter that came the personal attacks on the congresswoman's intelligence, as Trump added 'when we examine her test scores, we will find out that she is not qualified for office.'\n\nLess than an hour later, AOC replied to Trump's jab, writing: 'Mr. President, don't take your anger out on me - I'm just a silly girl.' \n\n'Take it out on whoever convinced you to betray the American people and our Constitution by illegally bombing Iran and dragging us into war,' she added.\n\n'It only took you five months to break almost every promise you made.' \n\nBut Slater - representing parts of both Putnam and Westchester counties - quickly jumped in, posting the two photos with the caption beneath one: 'Here's the Yorktown High School '04 yearbook pic. Friends Road looks nothing like the Bronx.'\n\nThe 35-year-old left-wing congresswoman has faced scrutiny over her suburban upbringing since her unexpected triumph in 2018 catapulted her onto the national stage.\n\nDuring her campaign, AOC highlighted her deep personal ties to the borough by sharing stories of her childhood and neighborhood life, aiming to authentically connect with Bronx voters and present herself as 'one of their own.'\n\nEven during a segment with late-night host Stephen Colbert during Trump's first term, she reaffirmed her Bronx identity, telling him, 'I don't think he knows how to deal with a girl from the Bronx.'\n\nHowever, at just five years old, AOC moved with her family to a modest two-bedroom house on a quiet street in Yorktown Heights - a suburban relocation driven by the search for better schools, according to a 2018 article by The New York Times.\n\nIn 2007, the congresswoman graduated from Yorktown High School before attending Boston University, where she studied economics and international relations—and briefly engaged with establishment politics - before returning to the Bronx.\n\nOnce back in the borough, she began advocating for improved childhood education and literacy - and even launched a children's book publishing company aimed at portraying the Bronx in a more positive light.\n\nDespite criticism of her suburban roots, AOC has continued to lean into and defend her Bronx narrative, arguing that her time in Yorktown highlighted the stark disparities people face based on where they're born.\n\n'It is nice. Growing up, it was a good town for working people,' she said in reference to Yorktown in a 2018 tweet. \n\n'My mom scrubbed toilets so I could live here & I grew up seeing how the zip code one is born in determines much of their opportunity.' \n\nAOC’s biography notes that she was born in the Parkchester neighborhood of the Bronx before her family moved north to Yorktown.\n\n'Alexandria’s mother was born and raised in Puerto Rico and worked throughout her childhood as a domestic worker,' her biography reads.

I was looking for guys with machetes and could not find them, where are they when you need them?”\n\nWatch Hughesy’s Carlton rant in the video above\n\nCarlton’s last premiership came back in 1995, as Hughesy knows all too tell, and he went rogue with a serious of tongue-in-cheek declarations about his beloved team.\n\n“This was our year? 30 years! This was it,” he said.\n\n“Guys it’s sad. I cannot do it anymore, it’s not good for my health. every weekend from now on I will go to the Wonthaggi area and forage for mushrooms.

What do you reckon?”\n\nHughes also took aim at the decision to let midfielder Matthew Kennedy go to the Bulldogs, where he could well be leading their best and fairest after a stellar year for the recruit.\n\n“Kennedy has gone to the Bulldogs and he might with the Brownlow,” Hughes said. “He has not missed a goal all year.”\n\nPressure is mounting on Carlton coach Michael Voss, with Buddy Franklin predicting Voss will be sacked before season’s end.\n\nVoss is refusing to put energy into discussions and external comments around his future as heat on his position reaches boiling point.\n\nVoss said there was only one place he was directing his “energy” and that was on Port, a game coming just five days after the loss to the Roos.\n\n“I don’t deal in hypotheticals like that, you can go for your life. As far as what we’re concerned, we’ve come off a game what four days ago,” he said.\n\n“As you can imagine, you tend to focus a lot of your energy on turning around what was a disappointing loss and turn that into something else.\n\n“Obviously, jumped on a plane today and got a game tomorrow. As you can understand, we haven’t drifted too far beyond that.\n\n“It was pretty obvious, clearly the contest part of the game and some drift moments in defence … we gave it a good throw at the end to have a crack at it, but the distance was far too much for us to peg it back.”\n\nCarlton will unveil two debutants this week, with Billy Wilson and Flynn Young confirmed to face Port Adelaide.\n\n— With NewsWire","summary":"Dave Hughes has delivered an epic rant about the “sad” reality of one of his obessessions, and his comments have to be seen to be believed.","url":"https://www.news.com.au/sport/afl/mushrooms-machetes-dave-hughes-epic-rant-about-sad-reality-of-being-a-carlton-fan/news-story/acba3f4b5dd4d85b76cbbfc3f23c8d34?from=rss-basic","image":"https://content.api.news/v3/images/bin/b24a43d509daff26fbb504a373163210","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-06-26 00:40:44","author":"Matthew Sullivan","authors":["Matthew Sullivan"],"language":"en","source_country":"au","sentiment":-0.107},{"id":335256428,"title":"Trump gesa perbicaraan Netanyahu dibatalkan","text":"WASHINGTON: Presiden Amerika Syarikat (AS), Donald Trump menggesa Israel supaya memberikan pengampunan kepada Perdana Menterinya, Benjamin Netanyahu atau membatalkan perbicaraan terhadapnya berhubung tuduhan rasuah.\n\nNetanyahu didakwa pada 2019 di Israel atas tuduhan rasuah, penipuan dan pecah amanah yang semuanya dinafikan beliau. \n\nPerbicaraan bermula pada 2020 dan membabitkan tiga kes jenayah dan Netanyahu mengaku tidak bersalah.\n\nTrump menerusi platform Truth Social berkata, perbicaraan Netanyahu sepatutnya dibatalkan serta-merta atau diberikan pengampunan kepada beliau yang banyak berjasa kepada Israel.\n\nMedia Israel melaporkan sesi soal balas terhadap Netanyahu bermula pada 3 Jun lalu di mahkamah Tel Aviv dan dijangka mengambil masa kira-kira setahun untuk diselesaikan.\n\nPresiden Israel, Isaac Herzog, mempunyai kuasa untuk memberikan pengampunan kepada Netanyahu namun media tempatan memetik beliau sebagai berkata bahawa pengampunan tidak dipertimbangkan pada ketika ini dan tiada permohonan rasmi dikemukakan.\n\nDalam pada itu, Trump turut memuji Netanyahu dan mendakwa AS sudah menyelamatkan Israel dan perdana menteri negara itu.\n\nDifahamkan, kenyataan berkenaan merujuk kepada sokongan AS terhadap serangan Israel ke atas program nuklear Iran dan Trump sebelum ini mengumumkan gencatan senjata, Isnin lalu.\n\nBagaimanapun, tidak jelas sama ada Trump memberi maksud bahawa AS boleh campur tangan dalam kes undang-undang yang dihadapi Netanyahu.\n\nTrump turut menggambarkan kes terhadap pemimpin Israel itu sebagai satu 'pemburuan ahli sihir', istilah yang sering digunakan Trump bagi merujuk kepada siasatan terhadap dirinya sendiri di AS.","summary":"WASHINGTON: Presiden Amerika Syarikat (AS), Donald Trump menggesa Israel supaya memberikan pengampunan kepada Perdana Menterinya, Benjamin Netanyahu atau membatalkan perbicaraan terhadapnya berhubung tuduhan rasuah.","url":"https://www.bharian.com.my/dunia/amerika/2025/06/1412583/trump-gesa-perbicaraan-netanyahu-dibatalkan","image":"https://assets.bharian.com.my/images/articles/bhtrump26_BHfield_image_listing_featured.var_1750898433.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-06-26 00:40:41","author":"REUTERS","authors":["REUTERS"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"my","sentiment":0.797},{"id":335260592,"title":"India News | Party Will Decide on Rajya Sabha Seat: AAP Leader Sanjeev Arora","text":"New Delhi [India], June 26 (ANI): With Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) leader Sanjeev Arora winning the Ludhiana West by-elections in Punjab, the party's Rajya Sabha seat has now become vacant, and the party is yet to decide the candidate for the same.

He declared that the Telangana Government would go ahead with legal proceedings to stop the Andhra Pradesh Government's Godavari-Banakacherla Link project, which he described as illegal and detrimental to the state's interests.

The Union Minister assured the state leadership that no approval had yet been granted and promised to call an Apex Council meeting soon to deliberate on the matter, release stated.

He directed that the presentation be updated to include clear documentation on how the project originated during the previous BRS regime, thus exposing the \"political background\" behind Andhra's current move, it mentioned. Uttam Kumar Reddy discussed the process of inducting two distinguished Army officers, renowned for their expertise in tunnel technology, into the Telangana Irrigation Department to oversee tunnel-related and other irrigation works in the state. These officers were recently involved in the execution of the Rohtang and Zojila tunnel projects.\nGeneral Harpal Singh, former Engineer-in-Chief of the Indian Army, has been invited to join the Telangana Irrigation Department as an Honorary Advisor. Colonel Parikshit Mehra, an internationally acclaimed expert in tunnel technologies and construction, will be joining the department in July.\nTurning his attention to critical issues within Telangana, the minister reviewed the findings of the National Dam Safety Authority on the damaged barrages of Medigadda, Annaram, and Sundilla. He directed officials to implement the NDSA's recommendations without delay. He was informed by the officials that the NDSA itself had offered to work as the design consultant for restoration works. Emphasising the urgency of the situation, he demanded weekly progress reports and warned that restoration must proceed on a war-footing basis in accordance with Central Water Commission guidelines.\nHe also reviewed the status of other major works, including the Singur Canal, where tenders have already been called. Uttam Kumar Reddy asked officials to expedite the formalities and ensure the agreements are signed at the earliest. Regarding the Dindi project, he was briefed about the ongoing inter-linkage coordination and the post-borewell design process. He directed officials to meet the respective District Collectors to speed up land acquisition and fast-track project execution.\nOn the Srisailam Left Bank Canal (SLBC) project, officials informed the minister that proposals had been sought from several agencies, including reputed international firms. The minister insisted that a LIDAR survey be conducted, stating that while cost was not a constraint, quality and speed were paramount. He directed officials to deploy the best manpower, equipment, infrastructure, and advanced technologies available in the country. If necessary, additional manpower must be recruited to ensure the project proceeds at a rapid pace. He further directed that SLBC work be reviewed on a daily basis.\nAddressing longstanding administrative issues, Uttam Kumar Reddy ordered immediate action on pending promotions and transfers within the department. A delegation of Assistant Executive Engineers met him during the meeting and pointed out that their promotions to the rank of Deputy Executive Engineer had been delayed for over 18 years, with 125 DEE posts currently vacant. The minister assured them that all pending promotions and transfers would be completed without any further delay.\nRegarding the desiltation and desedimentation of major irrigation projects, the minister noted that the Government of India had issued national guidelines and even constituted a Cabinet Sub-Committee to address the issue, given that many reservoirs have lost 20-25 per cent of their storage capacity. He enquired about the status of desiltation works in Nagarjuna Sagar, Nizam Sagar, and other key reservoirs. Specifically, he instructed officials to begin the desiltation process at Nagarjuna Sagar and formally inform the Andhra Pradesh Government about the move.\nHe also enquired into the progress of the Devadula project's Package-3 and gave directions to expedite the works. On the Sitarama project, he asked officials to identify ways to include additional packages within the existing budget so that progress is not stalled due to funding limitations.\nUttam Kumar Reddy concluded the review meeting with a clear message that there should be no delays in the execution of irrigation projects.\nHe announced that weekly reviews would be held to monitor the progress of each work, and strict action would be taken against officials who fail to meet timelines.

What a ride! We are back in space once again after 41 years. It's an amazing ride,” were the first thoughts shared by Shukla from the Dragon space capsule. He will serve as the pilot on the mission. Lucknow-born Shukla said his journey is not the beginning of India’s journey to the ISS but the country's pivot to its human space programme. The Ax-4 mission will provide valuable operational experience for India ahead of its maiden human spaceflight mission, Gaganyaan, which aims to carry a three-member crew to low-earth orbit. The Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) mission is scheduled for 2027, followed by Bhartiya Antriksh Station by 2035, and a planned human moon landing by 2040. Prime Minister Narendra Modi hailed Shukla and wished the mission success.“The Indian astronaut, Group Captain Shubhanshu Shukla is on the way to become the first Indian to go to the International Space Station. He carries with him the wishes, hopes and aspirations of 1.4 billion Indians,” the PM wrote on X.Shukla, along with his crew, is scheduled to dock at ISS’s Harmony module in low-earth orbit at 4:30 pm India time on Thursday. The journey from launch to docking is estimated to take 28 to 29 hours.In a statement, NASA said the collaboration with ISRO enabled Ax-4 to fulfill a commitment made by US President Donald Trump and Prime Minister Modi to send the first ISRO astronaut to ISS. The two leaders had made the announcement during their summit in February, seeking to broaden civil space cooperation. “The space agencies are participating in five joint scientific investigations and two in-orbit STEM demonstrations,” the US space agency said. “NASA and ISRO share a long-standing relationship rooted in a common vision to advance scientific knowledge and expand space collaboration.”Also Read: Shubhanshu Shukla Space Experiments: Indian astronaut to grow methi, moong daal and study tardigrades in microgravity Delay and big cheers The launch was delayed several times over the last one month due to issues in the electrical harness in the Crew Dragon Module, unpreparedness of the Falcon 9 launch vehicle, unfavourable weather conditions, and oxygen leakage in the engine bay of the ISS. On Wednesday too, engineers at SpaceX resolved a critical issue involving the uploading of real-time wind data, which is necessary to enable the Launch Escape System. Just T-minus 35 minutes before the take-off, the data upload was successfully confirmed. Back home, space-tech startups and academia cheered Shukla’s journey, hoping for a sustained human space exploration programme that can open new avenues for research and commercial space flights. “Seeing an Indian in orbit will add an ‘Indian flavour’ to low earth orbit for all of us here. Space will become more relatable in an intangible way,” said Srinath Ravichandran, cofounder of AgniKul Cosmos. Industry body Indian Space Association (ISpA) said the success of the mission will push more companies and startups to build world-class technology in India. “India is now in the final stages of preparation for the Gaganyaan mission, with firms like Larsen & Toubro, Tata and Ananth Technologies playing a critical role alongside our vibrant startups,” said Lt Gen AK Bhatt (retd), Director General, ISpA. Amitabh Kant, former Niti Aayog CEO said Shukla’s journey breathes new life into India’s space ambitions and reinforces commitment to advancing its space technology.

Recalling the \"serious assault\" made by the then government and the Prime Minister on the values of the Constitution, the Chief Minister said that Samvidhaan Hatya Diwas is observed so that the present and future generations of the nation remain aware of this dark chapter and awaken a sense of pride and dignity towards the Constitution.\nAlso Read | Ladki Bahin Yojana Installment: Will Women Beneficiaries in Maharashtra Get June and July Installments Together?.\nCM Patel highlighted that during the Emergency years, Prime Minister Narendra Modi disguised himself to fight for the Constitution and democratic values. He pointed out that the then government compromised the Constitution for governance purposes. CM emphasised that the Prime Minister places the Constitution and national interest above all, showcasing profound respect for it to the nation and the world.\nThe Chief Minister said that while the Emergency was imposed when the Constitution completed 25 years, diminishing its glory, on the 60th anniversary of the Constitution, PM Modi, as the then Chief Minister of Gujarat, honoured it through a Samvidhaan Gaurav Yatra with the Constitution placed atop a royal elephant.\nAlso Read | Donald Trump Claims He Prevented India-Pakistan Nuclear War Through Trade Deals (Watch Video).\nThe Chief Minister reiterated his commitment to upholding the Constitution's spirit--\"We the People\"--to build Viksit Bharat under the Prime Minister's leadership. This will be achieved through \"Sabka Saath, Sabka Vikas, Sabka Vishwas, and Sabka Prayas.\"\nThe Prime Minister has enacted significant reforms, such as the Nari Shakti Vandan Adhiniyam, abolishing Triple Talaq, and the Citizenship Amendment Act, while respecting constitutional values. He has also protected citizens' interests by abrogating Articles 35A and 370 to build Akhand Bharat. The Chief Minister emphasised his role in safeguarding the Constitution for the nation's benefit.\nLaw and Judiciary Minister Rushikesh Patel, calling the citizens the guardians of democracy, stated that to ensure India, governed by democratic principles, never strays towards dictatorship, it is essential for citizens to remain aware of their fundamental rights.\n\"In the past, the then government imposed the Emergency and snatched away these rights. Therefore, under the guidance of PM Modi, the Samvidhaan Hatya Diwas-2025 programme is being organised across the country to raise public awareness so that today's youth can learn from this event and such a grave mistake is never repeated,\" he said.\nThe minister elaborated on the idea behind celebrating Samvidhaan Hatya Diwas, stating that as per the Indian Constitution, citizens are entitled to several fundamental rights from birth, including freedom of speech and expression. In the past, on this very day--at midnight on June 25, 1975--the then government misused Article 352 of the Constitution to impose Emergency in the country in order to maintain its dominance and grip on power.\nDuring the Emergency, fundamental constitutional rights of citizens were taken away, and both democracy and the Constitution were attacked. Today marks the completion of 50 years of that disgraceful incident. The day is being commemorated as \"Samvidhaan Hatya Diwas\" to raise public awareness about it.\nDuring the event, retired judge of the Gujarat High Court and legal expert Ravikumar Tripathi provided detailed insights on the Indian Constitution, the fundamental rights enshrined in it, amendments made to it in the past, misuse of various constitutional provisions, and the imposition of Emergency in 1975. He also sensitised the citizens about their constitutional rights. Additionally, Commissioner of Youth Services and Cultural Activities Department Alok Kumar Pandey extended a formal welcome and presented a holistic overview of the event at the start of the programme.\nThe Chief Minister, along with dignitaries and citizens, watched a documentary and a play about the Emergency.\nThe programme was attended by Gandhinagar Municipal Corporation Mayor Miraben Patel, Gandhinagar North MLA Rita Patel, Secretary of the Parliamentary and Legal Affairs Department K M Lala, Gandhinagar District Collector, M K Dave, Gandhinagar District Development Officer, B J Patel, as well as various officials of the Gandhinagar Municipal Corporation, government officers and employees, and a large number of citizens.

The bail order was issued on Wednesday following the conclusion of his statement and detention hearing in the corruption case filed by the Nepali Commission for the Investigation of Abuse of Authority (CIAA).\nAlso Read | Donald Trump Claims He Prevented India-Pakistan Nuclear War Through Trade Deals (Watch Video).\nA bench comprising Special Court members Tej Narayan Singh Raya, Ram Bahadur Thapa, and Bidur Koirala issued the order directing his release on bail.\nSenior Advocate Sushil Pant, on Wednesday, hired by the CIAA, led the prosecution, which also included government attorneys Mohan Sagar Basyal, Bhagawati Devi Gautam, Umakanta Poudel, and Gyan Prasad Bhusal.\nAlso Read | Donald Trump Meets With Volodymyr Zelenskyy, Says Higher NATO Defence Spending May Deter Future Russian Aggression.\nPant argued that the Cabinet decision enabling the land transaction constituted corruption and should not exempt Nepal from legal accountability.\nPant responded to two key questions posed by the court - whether the CIAA can prosecute a policy-level Cabinet decision and whether Nepal's role caused harm to government property, as the land in question had not been officially nationalised.\nPant contended that it was not a policy decision and that the land swap effectively caused a loss to the government, as the land beyond the ownership ceiling was meant to be compulsorily nationalised, thereby resulting in a loss. Pant stressed that Nepal should be held in custody during the trial.\nThe defence, led by Senior Advocate Shambhu Thapa, challenged the CIAA's legal standing in the case, arguing that independent lawyers cannot represent the prosecution when the charge sheet specifies government attorneys.\nThapa cited precedent from 2003 in which a similar land exemption decision was upheld by the Supreme Court and claimed the charges against the former Nepali PM were politically motivated and legally baseless.\nOther defence lawyers, including Khamma Bahadur Khati, Raman Shrestha and Gobinda Bandi, supported the claim that the Cabinet's decision was policy-driven and beyond the CIAA's jurisdiction.\nEarlier on June 5, the CIAA had booked the former Prime Minister in a corruption case for the first time in the nation's history.\nThe case involves alleged misappropriation of land acquired for Patanjali Yogpeeth in Nepal under government exemptions for land ownership ceilings.\nAs per the charges, the anti-grant agency has demanded NRS 186 million from the former Prime Minister.\nMadhav Kumar Nepal, now the chairman of CPN-Unified Socialist (CPN-US), while in power on February 1, 2010, had approved the purchase of 815 ropani (one ropani equals 0.0509 hectares) of land in Banepa, Kavre, under the ceiling exemption for purposes including yoga centres, Ayurvedic institutes, and the herbal industry. The decision was made through a meeting of the council of ministers led by then Prime Minister Madhav Kumar Nepal.\nThe same cabinet meeting also approved the purchase of land under a ceiling exemption of 75 bighas (one bigha equals 0.677 hectares) in Dang, 300 ropanis in Lamjung, 250 ropanis in Syangja, 15 bighas in Chitwan, 25 bighas in Dhanusha, 150 ropanis in the Kathmandu Valley, and 40 bighas in the Bara-Parsa area within five years.\nAfter receiving Cabinet approval, Patanjali's Nepal chief, Shaligram Singh, purchased 593 ropanis, 5 annas, and 3 paisas of land in the areas of Nasikasthan, Sanga, Mahendrajyoti, and Chalal Ganeshsthan in Banepa.\nThe decision-making process to grant approval for purchasing land under the ceiling exemption involved then Prime Minister Madhav Kumar Nepal, then Land Reform Minister Dambar Shrestha, then chief secretary Madhav Ghimire, then secretary Chhabiraj Pant, along with other high-ranking officials and employees.\nWithin a month of receiving approval to purchase land under the ceiling exemption, on February 19, 2010, Patanjali's Nepal chief Shaligram, submitted an application to the then Land Reform Minister, Shrestha, seeking permission to sell the land acquired under the exemption.\nOn March 16 of the same year, citing \"as per Prime Minister Nepal's instruction\", then Minister Shrestha took the proposal to the Cabinet to allow Patanjali to sell the land obtained through the ceiling exemption. Three days later, the Cabinet decided to approve the sale of the exempted land.\nHowever, on March 30, 2010, then-director general of the Land Reform Department Keshar Bahadur Baniya sent a letter to the ministry stating that the Cabinet's decision was illegal and could not be implemented.\nOn April 8, 2010, the Cabinet decided to seek clarification from Director General Baniya, accusing him of challenging the approval given for the sale of land exempted from the land ceiling. The next day, to support the planned sale of the exempted land, Baniya was allegedly removed from his position as director general, and Joint Secretary Jit Bahadur Thapa of the ministry was appointed in his place.\nOn the very same day he assumed the role, Thapa sent a letter to the Kavre Land Revenue Office granting approval for the sale of the land exempted from the land ceiling.\nOn June 25, 2010, Patanjali sold 353 ropani and 15 aana of land to Kasthamandap Business Homes Pvt Ltd. The investigation has also revealed financial irregularities in land transactions.\nWhen Patanjali sold the land in Banepa, the recorded price was NRS 42.25 million. Government records show that Patanjali later bought 104 ropani, one aana, two paisa, and one dam of land in Dhulikhel for Rs 10.75 million.

You know, they [Spain] are doing very well … And that economy could be blown right out of the water when something bad happens,” Trump said, adding that Spain would get a tougher trade deal from the US than other European Union countries.\n\nIn a five-point statement, Nato endorsed the higher defence spending goal – a response not only to Trump but also to Europeans’ fears that Russia poses a growing threat to their security following the 2022 invasion of Ukraine.\n\nThe 32 allies’ brief communique added: “We reaffirm our ironclad commitment to collective defence as enshrined in Article 5 of the Washington Treaty – that an attack on one is an attack on all.”\n\nAsked to clarify his own stance on Article 5 after recent ambiguous comments, Trump said: “I stand with it.

to recent developments, Ambassador Asim Iftikhar emphasized:\n\n— Condemnation of violation of the sovereignty and territorial integrity of member states and, of the threat or use of force to settle disputes;\n\n— Rejection of attacks on IAEA-safeguarded nuclear facilities;\n\n— Sustained cessation of hostilities and a permanent ceasefire to allow resumption of dialogue and verification activities by the IAEA, and,\n\n— Renew diplomatic engagement to seriously and faithfully address the outstanding issues in a cooperative manner.\n\nIn conclusion, the Ambassador Asim Iftikhar informed the Council that together with Russia and China, Pakistan has proposed a draft Council resolution in search of a peaceful solution to the concerns surrounding Iran’s nuclear programme.\n\nHe said the sponsors will propose an updated version of its Sunday’s resolution that takes into consideration the latest developments to ensure the sustainability of the ceasefire and the Council’s oversight of it.\n\nEarlier, addressing the Council meeting held to try and revive the deal amid the dramatic military escalation of the past 12 days, UN political affairs chief Rosemary DiCarlo said the fragile ceasefire announced by Donald Trump overnight provided “an opportunity to avoid a catastrophic escalation and achieve a peaceful resolution of the Iran nuclear issue.\n\nMs. DiCarlo told the Council the recent surge in violence had significantly undermined diplomatic momentum.\n\n“The military escalation between Israel and Iran since 13 June and United States air strikes on Iran’s nuclear facilities on 21 June complicated prospects for achieving full implementation of resolution 2231,” Ms. DiCarlo said.\n\n“Iran’s strikes yesterday on a base in Qatar further exacerbated insecurity in an already tense region.”\n\nDespite five rounds of bilateral talks between Iran and the US, facilitated by Oman in recent months, Ms. DiCarlo noted that efforts “did not produce a way forward” to restore full JCPOA implementation.\n\nA sixth round of talks was called off due to the outbreak of hostilities.\n\nMeanwhile, the toll from the recent conflict has been sobering.\n\nAccording to Iranian authorities, at least 606 people were killed and more than 5,300 injured since hostilities erupted on 13 June. Israeli officials reported 28 deaths and nearly 1,500 injuries.","summary":"Pakistan reaffirmed its support for resolving Iran nuclear issue through peaceful means when the UN Security Council on Tuesday discussed the latest developments related to the implementation of its 2015 resolution endorsing the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), which limits the Iranian atomic programme. &#8220;Diplomatic engagement and the resumption of dialogue are the best [&#8230;]","url":"https://dailytimes.com.pk/1323199/iran-nuclear-issue-pakistan-urges-diplomacy-dialogue-verification/","image":"https://dailytimes.com.pk/assets/uploads/2025/06/WhatsApp-Image-2025-06-25-at-11.30.31-PM-copy.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-06-26 00:17:29","author":"Sajid Salamat","authors":["Sajid Salamat"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"pk","sentiment":-0.051},{"id":335253656,"title":"India News | Maharashtra: Pune BJP Leader Booked for Harassing Senior Woman Police Officer","text":"Pune (Maharashtra) [India], June 26 (ANI): The Pune City Police have registered a case against Pramod Kondhre, general secretary of the BJP's city unit, for allegedly sexually harassing a senior woman police officer on Monday, said a senior Pune City Police official on Wednesday.\nThe incident occured near the venue of a programme attended by Union Minister Nitin Gadkari on Monday, where several BJP functionaries had gathered for the event.\nAlso Read | Ladki Bahin Yojana Installment: Will Women Beneficiaries in Maharashtra Get June and July Installments Together?.\nAccording to the police, Kondhre is accused of inappropriately touching the officer during the event, and the incident has been recorded on CCTV.

Trump Stands Up For Israeli PM Amid Corruption Cases","text":"US President Donald Trump's focus on the Middle East and Israel in particular continued on Wednesday after the US President sent out a long message slamming the prosecution of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. In a post on Truth Social, Trump noted that he and \"Bibi\" fought alongside each other against \"a very tough and brilliant longtime enemy of Israel, Iran,\" and he could not believe when he learned that the \"Great War Time Prime Minister!\" was due to appear in court in a corruption case. Trump lauded Netanyahu as \"a WARRIOR, like perhaps no other Warrior in the History of Israel\" and dubbed all the charges and cases against him a \"ridiculous Witch Hunt.\" The 79-year-old called for the trial to be \"cancelled immediately\" or a \"pardon\" to be given to Netanyahu. \"Now it is going to be the United States of America that saves Bibi Netanyahu. THIS TRAVESTY OF “JUSTICE” CAN NOT BE ALLOWED!\" Trump concluded his post. Why Is Netanyahu On Trial? Benjamin Netanyahu has been under investigation by Israeli police since December 2016. In November 2019, he was formally indicted on charges of fraud, bribery, and breach of trust. His trial began in the Jerusalem District Court on May 24, 2020, with witness testimonies starting on April 5, 2021. The prosecution presented 333 witnesses before resting its case in July 2024. Netanyahu’s defense, including his own testimony, began in December 2024. Netanyahu was investigated in five different cases, three of which have gone to trial. Also read: Trump’s ‘Schoolyard Fight’ Analogy, NATO Chief’s ‘Daddy’ Quip Go Viral Amid Israel-Iran Truce Case 1000 centers on claims that Netanyahu and his wife, Sara, accepted luxury gifts, primarily cigars, champagne, and jewelry, valued at around NIS 700,000 (approximately $200,000) from Hollywood producer Arnon Milchan. In exchange, Netanyahu is accused of assisting Milchan with matters such as renewing his US residency visa and addressing tax concerns, actions that allegedly violated conflict-of-interest regulations. Case 2000 involves accusations of fraud and breach of trust. Netanyahu allegedly sought a deal with Arnon “Noni” Mozes, the publisher of Yedioth Ahronoth, offering legislation to curb the influence of rival newspaper Israel Hayom in return for more favorable coverage in Yedioth. Case 4000, known as the Bezeq-Walla affair, is considered the most severe. Netanyahu is accused of advancing regulatory decisions that benefited the controlling shareholder of communication conglomerate Bezeq, Shaul Elovitch, by hundreds of millions of shekels. In return, Elovitch allegedly ensured positive coverage of Netanyahu on the Walla news website, which he also owned. Netanyahu has denied all allegations, claiming the charges are politically motivated and part of a conspiracy orchestrated by law enforcement and the state prosecution.","summary":"US President Trump defended Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu, calling his corruption trial a “witch hunt” and demanding it be canceled or pardoned.

It is accordingly rejected. The hearing of this petition has practically taken the whole day, leaving aside our urgent cause list, and for such reason, the petition would certainly warrant dismissal with costs; however, we refrain from doing so.\" The petition, argued by Senior Advocate and political leader Prakash Ambedkar--grandson of Dr B.R. Ambedkar --alleged that a total of 76 lakh votes were polled after 6 pm on November 20, 2024, the day of polling in Maharashtra.\nAlso Read | Donald Trump Claims He Prevented India-Pakistan Nuclear War Through Trade Deals (Watch Video).\nIt further claimed that this unusually high number of late votes had a decisive impact on as many as 90 assembly constituencies.\nHowever, during the hearing on Monday, the bench posed critical questions to the petitioner's counsel, asking, \"Is this the first time votes were polled after 6 pm in any election?\n\"The court also questioned why no challenge had been brought in relation to the Lok Sabha elections, where similar voting patterns reportedly occurred.\nResponding to the bench's queries, counsel for the Election Commission of India and the Union Government clarified that polling beyond 6 pm is not an irregularity but a routine feature of Indian elections.\n\"The whole basis on which the petitioner intends to prosecute this petition is vague, ambiguous, and is in the realm of disputed questions of fact. There is not an iota of material whatsoever that there is a difference between the votes that were cast and the polled votes, as sought to be vehemently canvassed by the petitioner. On such specious pleas, the petitioner cannot call upon the High Court to delve into the merits of the petitioner's contentions as such contentions can be entertained on merits only if the Court assumes jurisdiction,\" the ECI counsel said.\nVoters who are present in the queue by the scheduled closing time are legally permitted to cast their vote, which often leads to extended polling hours, the counsel said.\nThe court found no grounds to intervene to annul the results of an entire state election.\nThe High Court observed that at every polling station, there are several precautions provided by the ECI to strictly adhere to the fair procedure of the elections.\n\"There is nothing on record that at any polling station in the State of Maharashtra, any untoward incident/fraud had taken place,\" it noted.\n\"We are also of the opinion that although such farcical claims are made on the purity of the process of the elections of the State Assembly, and more particularly in the context of the electronic voting machines (EVM) and a need to discard such system of voting to be replaced by a traditional method of voting by ballot papers, such plea of the petitioner, appears to be in absolute desperation. This is more particularly in view of the settled principles of law on the use of EVMs, which are held to be legal and valid by the Supreme Court, the court added\nIt said that a petition under Article 226 cannot be maintained on grounds of political opinions or on unsubstantiated newspaper reports. \"We wonder as to how the petitioner can have a locus standi to seek such wide, sweeping and drastic reliefs to question the entire elections of the State Legislative Assembly. It is a relief, too far fetched, that too on the basis of no cause of action as the facts clearly demonstrate,\" it said.

While some, like Tucker Carlson, spoke out against any attack or escalation, Kirk remained a stalwart supporter of the president – while acknowledging foreign policy is the biggest divider on the right.\n\n“There is no greater divide on the American right than foreign policy,” Kirk said. “It’s like we’re largely in agreement on immigration. We’re actually really in agreement on the trans stuff, but the greatest fault line of the conservative movement is foreign policy. And I was really worried that this was going to bring it to a very unpleasant moment.”\n\nHe continued: “Turns out, I was partially right, because no one has liked to see what we’ve seen on X the last week and a half, it’s just been seeing a lot of our friends fight. It’s been really kind of nasty. I’m taking a different tact, which is, let’s just keep it about ideas.”\n\nPerhaps the biggest dust up about the escalation came from a conversation between Carlson and Ted Cruz last week. Carlson confronted the Texas senator about wanted to attack Iran without knowing much about the country.\n\n“How many people live in Iran, by the way?” Carlson asked. “I don’t know the population at all … I don’t know the population,” Cruz replied.\n\n“You don’t know the population in the country you seek to topple?” Carlson asked before clarifying that Iran currently has an estimated population of 92 million. “How could you not know that?”\n\n“I don’t sit around memorizing population tables,” Cruz responded. \n\n“Well, it’s kind of relevant, because you’re calling for the overthrow of the government,” Carlson retorted.\n\nKirk went on to add that some of the dissent came from younger voters. He explained to Kelly that they are tired of wars and worried Trump was putting the U.S. into the thick of things too much.\n\n“Allow me to try to introduce one element, which is the younger voters that I represent on college campuses,” he said. “They are war weary. They don’t want foreign conflict. They don’t want foreign intervention, and so just please keep that in mind when you’re going about this.”\n\nWatch the full segment, in which Kelly referred to the tensions as a mounting “civil war” within the Republican Party, below","summary":"\"I was really worried that this was going to bring it to a very unpleasant moment,\" he adds on \"The Megyn Kelly Show\"\n\n\nThe post Charlie Kirk Says Trump&#8217;s Iran Mission Ignited a MAGA Civil War, Cites Foreign Policy as a GOP &#8216;Fault Line&#8217; | Video appeared first on TheWrap.","url":"https://www.thewrap.com/charlie-kirk-maga-civil-war-trump-iran-bombing/","image":"https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/CharlieKirk.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-06-26 00:04:24","author":"Jacob Bryant","authors":["Jacob Bryant"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.227},{"id":335255520,"title":"Kudlow - Wednesday, June 25","text":"to top close Video This video is playing in picture-in-picture.\n\n Your Preview Pass expires in 00:00 Don't have a TV subscription?

The cuts would also drastically reduce funding for rural hospitals which would lead to widespread closures. \n\nAfter the latter problem was pointed out, some GOP senators are proposing the establishment of a separate fund specifically for rural hospitals, instead of backing off the cuts themselves. Critics say that plan wouldn’t solve the problem and would likely make seeking medical care more onerous for rural residents, Duckworth among them.\n\n“As these negotiations continue, Senate Republicans are debating a $15 million stabilization fund for rural hospitals to help offset some of the concerns about what the bill does do Medicaid what do you think of that suggestion?” Tapper asked Duckworth.\n\n“Well, it’s like the person setting the fire saying, ‘Hey, you know what, we need a fire department’ when you’re the one who set the fire to begin with. These hospitals are going to shut down, 30% of our safety net hospitals are goning to shut down if these Medicaid cuts go through. And by the way, for a party that says they want smaller government, they seem to be creating more goverbment bureaucracy. So they’re going to start a new fund with more bureaucracy about it, that hospitals have to apply to get this money?” Duckworth said.\n\n“And by the way, that doesn’t help the hundreds of thousands of Illinoisans who are going to get kicked off of Medicaid. This will help the hospitals, maybe, if they can process through the paperwork and get this fund setup. But what does it do to the mom who is trying to make sure that she can take her kid to the emergency room for care? What does it do to the pregnant woman, one of the 40% of all births in this country are covered by Medicaid, what does it do for that person?” she continued.\n\n“So this is not a fix, this is just a fig leaf that they are trying to put out there to try to distract the American people. Bottom line, 30% of our safety net hospitals will shut down. Many times, these are the last remaining hospitals in a tri or quad-county area. They’re also the largest employer in the area. You’re going to see people die,” she added. “Americans did not vote for the ‘we’re all gonna die anyway’ party, but that’s what they’re getting from Donald Trump and his Republican allies.”\n\nWatch the whole clip below","summary":"The Illinois Democrat tells Jake Tapper the GOP is \"like the person setting the fire saying, 'Hey, you know what, we need a fire department'\" \n\n\nThe post Tammy Duckworth Shreds Trump and Allies Over Medicaid Cuts: &#8216;The Party of We&#8217;re All Going to Die&#8217; | Video appeared first on TheWrap.","url":"https://www.thewrap.com/tammy-duckworth-shreds-trump-over-medicaid-cuts/","image":"https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Jake-Tapper-and-Tammy-Duckworth-discussing-GOP-Medicaid-cuts.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-06-26 00:01:13","author":"Ross A.

A source who witnessed the discussion told the outlet that Tillis discussed how the GOP proposal would cut services in his home state and told Thune, “this will be devastating to my state.”\n\nTillis is up for reelection in 2026 and is one of the Republican Party’s most vulnerable Senate candidates. He won his 2020 race by less than 2 percentage points, and while Trump won North Carolina in 2024, the state has been decided by less than 4 percentage points in the past five presidential elections.\n\nAdditional pressure is being exerted on Republicans from within by a group of over a dozen House Republicans. The members, who hold vulnerable seats, sent a letter to Thune and Johnson on Tuesday, saying they wouldn’t back a revised bill that included more health care cuts.\n\nThune’s predecessor in Senate leadership, Republican Sen. Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, is also trying to prevent his party from getting more bad headlines over health care. After it was reported that McConnell said in a private meeting that voters would “get over it,” referring to the cuts, his spokesperson tried to claim his comments referred to people purportedly abusing Medicaid benefits.\n\nRepublicans have been trying to convince the public that the proposed cuts will not affect the public at large, but this is false. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office has estimated that 16 million would lose care under the bill. \n\nEven though public opinion polls show Americans opposed to the bill’s provisions, Trump is already planning a victory party to celebrate the bill’s passage. The party’s congressional campaign committee also plans to attack Democrats for voting against it.\n\nDemocratic leaders like Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts have been lambasting Republicans over the bill, with an emphasis on the massive impact it will have on day-to-day life for millions.\n\nTrump has a lot riding on the legislative success of the bill.\n\nIn his first term, two of his most humiliating moments came after the failure to repeal the Affordable Care Act and his inability to pass an infrastructure bill (though former President Joe Biden passed one). Trump’s signature legislative achievement, the 2017 tax cut, failed to stimulate the economy.","summary":"New disclosures from Republican lawmakers reveal concerns within the party that voters may punish the GOP if proposed cuts to health care in the Donald Trump-backed “One Big, Beautiful Bill” become law.

The crew is travelling to the International Space Station (ISS) on a new SpaceX Dragon spacecraft on the company's Falcon 9 rocket.\n\nIndian Air Force Group Captain Shubhanshu Shukla lifted off aboard SpaceX’s Dragon spacecraft from NASA’s Kennedy Space Center at 12:01 pm Wednesday, achieving the rare feat of being only the second Indian to journey to space after Rakesh Sharma’s historic flight in 1984. On the 14-day trip for the Axiom mission (Ax-4), the four-member crew including NASA veteran Peggy Whitson, Poland’s Slawosz Uznanski-Wisniewski, and Hungary’s Tibor Kapu will conduct more than 60 scientific experiments representing 31 countries aboard the International Space Station (ISS). “Namaskar, my dear countrymen! What a ride! We are back in space once again after 41 years. It’s an amazing ride,” were the first thoughts shared by Shukla from the Dragon space capsule. He will serve as the pilot on the mission. Lucknow-born Shukla said his journey is not the beginning of India’s journey to the ISS but the country’s pivot to its human space programme. The Ax-4 mission will provide valuable operational experience for India ahead of its maiden human spaceflight mission, Gaganyaan, which aims to carry a three-member crew to low-earth orbit. The Indian Space Research Organisation (Isro) mission is scheduled for 2027, followed by Bhartiya Antriksh Station by 2035, and a planned human moon landing by 2040.Live Events Prime Minister Narendra Modi congratulated Shukla and wished the mission success. Startups, academia cheer Shukla “The Indian astronaut, Group Captain Shubhanshu Shukla, is on the way to become the first Indian to go to the International Space Station. He carries with him the wishes, hopes and aspirations of 1.4 billion Indians,” the PM wrote on X. Shukla, along with his crew, is scheduled to dock at ISS’s Harmony module in low-earth orbit at 4:30 pm India time on Thursday. The journey from launch to docking is estimated to take 28 to 29 hours. In a statement, NASA said the collaboration with Isro enabled Ax-4 to fulfill a commitment made by US President Donald Trump and PM Modi to send the first Isro astronaut to ISS. The two leaders had made the announcement during their summit in February, seeking to broaden civil space cooperation. “The space agencies are participating in five joint scientific investigations and two in-orbit STEM demonstrations,” the US space agency said. “NASA and Isro share a long-standing relationship rooted in a common vision to advance scientific knowledge and expand space collaboration.” Delay and big cheers The launch was delayed several times over the last one month due to issues in the electrical harness in the Crew Dragon Module, unpreparedness of the Falcon 9 launch vehicle, unfavourable weather conditions, and oxygen leakage in the engine bay of the ISS. On Wednesday, too, engineers at SpaceX resolved a critical issue involving the uploading of real-time wind data, which is necessary to enable the Launch Escape System. Just T-minus 35 minutes before the take-off, the data upload was successfully confirmed. Back home, space-tech startups and academia cheered Shukla’s journey, hoping for a sustained human space exploration programme that can open new avenues for research and commercial space flights. “Seeing an Indian in orbit will add an ‘Indian flavour’ to low earth orbit for all of us here. Space will become more relatable in an intangible way,” said Srinath Ravichandran, cofounder of AgniKul Cosmos. Industry body Indian Space Association (ISpA) said the success of the mission will push more companies and startups to build world-class technology in India. “India is now in the final stages of preparation for the Gaganyaan mission, with firms like Larsen & Toubro, Tata and Ananth Technologies playing a critical role alongside our vibrant startups,” said Lt Gen AK Bhatt (retd), Director General, ISpA.(You can now subscribe to our Economic Times WhatsApp channel)\n\nRead More News onInternational Space StationAxiom missionNASAGaganyaan missionISROSpaceX Dragon spacecrafthuman spaceflightShubhanshu Shukla\n\n(Catch all the Business News, Breaking News, Budget 2025 Events and Latest News Updates on The Economic Times.)
