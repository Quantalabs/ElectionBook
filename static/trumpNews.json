She said Sarcone wasn’t properly appointed to his position last year.\n\n“Mr. Sarcone’s service was and is unlawful because it bypassed the statutory requirements that govern who may exercise the powers of a U.S. attorney,” Schofield wrote. “The subpoenas are quashed, and Mr. Sarcone is disqualified from further participation in the underlying investigations.”\n\nSarcone’s office didn’t immediately return a message seeking comment.\n\nA spokesperson for James’ office said the decision is “an important win for the rule of law.”\n\nThe ruling is a setback to the Trump administration’s efforts to investigate James, a Democrat who successfully brought fraud charges against Trump and his businesses. Schofield joined other judges in throwing out indictments of Trump’s perceived enemies because the prosecutors who brought them weren’t properly installed. James used a similar argument last year to rebut mortgage fraud charges brought by federal prosecutors in Virginia.\n\nA judge there threw out a two-count indictment against James after determining that Lindsey Halligan, a former White House lawyer, wasn’t properly installed in her post as interim U.S. attorney. Virginia prosecutors tried to refile the charges against James, but were rejected by two different grand juries in the course of a week.\n\nJames says she is innocent and the charges are politically motivated. She has said Sarcone’s investigation is also politically motivated and that her cases were brought based on evidence. \n\nSarcone personally requested the subpoenas of James’ office in August. He previously said he believed James was irresponsible in saying during her 2018 campaign that she would investigate Trump if elected.\n\nJames sued Trump and his businesses in 2022, alleging that he inflated the value of his property to obtain favorable loan terms. A judge fined Trump more than $350 million, but the penalty has been set aside as the case is appealed.\n\nRepublicans said that case is a witch hunt and that Trump was unfairly targeted. The president has called for “accountability” for James and other perceived critics who have investigated and brought charges against him.\n\nSarcone, a former Trump campaign lawyer, had never worked as a prosecutor when U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi appointed him interim U.S. attorney for the Northern District of New York last spring.\n\nJudges in the district declined to permanently install Sarcone after his 120-day interim term expired. Bondi responded by naming Sarcone a special attorney and designated him as the first assistant U.S. attorney in Albany, making a bureaucratic maneuver to keep him in his post.\n\nAssistant U.S. Attorney Richard Belliss argued in court that Sarcone possessed the legal authority to seek subpoenas and fulfill all the major duties of a U.S. attorney because he was a “special attorney.”\n\nSchofield rejected that argument.\n\n“Federal law does not permit such a workaround,” she wrote.","summary":"ALBANY, NY - APRIL 28: U.S. Attorney for the Northern District of New York John A.

Bessent said in an interview that he still doubted that the court would rule against Trump's tariffs, but he believed that any refunds would be a corporate boondoggle for companies that passed on added costs to their customers. He added that any negative ruling may not be a simple yes-or-no result, but something more nuanced that could complicate the refund process. \"It won't be a problem if we have to do it, but I can tell you that if it happens - which I don't think it's going to - it's just a corporate boondoggle,\" Bessent said. \"Costco, who's suing the U.S. government, are they going to give the money back to their clients?\" Bessent said companies generally, however, were not passing tariffs on to consumers, saying there was \"very, very little, if any, pass-through,\" and disputed that Trump's tariffs contributed to inflation. He said goods inflation had been below headline inflation. Importers and trade lawyers had anticipated a Supreme Court ruling on Friday but the court instead issued a ruling on a different matter. It remains unclear when the court will rule on the tariff case, which challenges President Donald Trump's use of the International Emergency Economic Powers Act to impose broad tariffs on nearly every U.S. trading partner. Bessent said he believed that the longer the tariff decision is delayed, the more likely it is that the Supreme Court rules in Trump's favor. With cash on hand of nearly $774 billion as of Thursday, the Treasury has more than enough funds to cover any refunds. \"We're not talking about the money all goes out in a day.

She was at least the fourth person killed in a shooting by immigration-enforcement officers during Donald Trump’s second term. Two more people were shot yesterday when a Border Patrol officer fired at a car during a traffic stop in Portland, Oregon; their condition remains unknown.\n\nAs my colleague Caitlin Dickerson explains in her latest story, the president and his advisers have exerted “overwhelming pressure” on immigration enforcement. The White House has “pumped out rhetoric and imagery that celebrates the merciless, military-style pursuit of deportations,” she writes. “The overall message to employees, including those who carry weapons, is that anything goes.” Last year, the administration effectively kneecapped three offices meant to protect the public from misconduct: the Office for Civil Rights and Civil Liberties, the Citizenship and Immigration Services Ombudsman, and the Immigration Detention Ombudsman. Good’s killing is now being handled exclusively by Kash Patel’s FBI, and local investigators have been barred from accessing evidence.\n\nI spoke with Caitlin, who won a Pulitzer Prize in 2023 for her immigration reporting, about how the Trump administration is encouraging aggressive enforcement tactics while also scaling back oversight.\n\nWill Gottsegen: To what extent is ICE no longer subject to some of the guardrails that once helped keep it in check?\n\nCaitlin Dickerson: Formally and informally, since Donald Trump took office, there’s been this push away from transparency and accountability, which is exactly what would discourage an officer in a tense situation, under pressure, from using deadly force. We still need to learn a lot more about what happened in Minnesota and Portland, and an investigation needs to transpire, but we do know that ICE officers shot more people last year than in 2023 and 2022. There are clear examples of how training and policy seem to have been violated in some recent incidents. So I think the fact that these three offices for accountability are going away is significant in that it’s sending a message to everyday officers that they’re not being watched as closely as they once were and, in fact, that the only thing they can really get in trouble for is not being aggressive enough.\n\nThere has been a constant churn within leadership. In addition to high-level reassignments, a significant number of field-office directors were replaced with Border Patrol leadership, who are perceived to be more aggressive. Former officials who spent their whole careers at ICE told me that they don’t recognize the agency anymore. They said things like: I don’t know who these people are anymore, because the standards seem to have changed so much. It’s almost become a completely different agency with a completely different mission.\n\nThe pressure that ICE officers are facing is unprecedented, and it’s not just the pressure to carry out as many deportations as possible—the administration is actually celebrating aggression. When you look at its statements, the memes, and the imagery that it’s publishing, all of these signs seem to be encouraging officers to be as aggressive as possible. There’s no emphasis on trying to minimize harm.\n\nWill: How does this pressure on ICE officers affect immigration-enforcement operations?\n\nCaitlin: The kinds of conflicts that we’re seeing on social media every day are not what typical immigration enforcement looks like at all. It’s not what officers are trained to do, and it’s not what veteran officers have any experience with. Normally, with law enforcement, the goal is to have things happen as discreetly as possible: without tension, without conflict, without getting a lot of attention and disrupting the general public. And immigration enforcement looks the opposite of that right now. In the case of Minneapolis and Portland, law-enforcement training 101 says, Do not shoot into a moving vehicle. A retired officer I spoke with today told me what he would have done in that situation: “I’m going to follow them until I get them somewhere where I can control the environment.” Not taking those kinds of precautions could be dangerous for the officers and for people nearby.\n\nWill: Minnesota Governor Tim Walz has said that he’s skeptical that the FBI is going to be able to do an impartial investigation, because multiple federal officials have already adopted the party line that Renee Good got herself killed. The vice president blamed “left-wing ideology” for her death. Do you anticipate that the investigation will be affected by political interests?\n\nCaitlin: It’s going to depend on who’s put on the investigation but also which high-level officials get to review and sign off on any assessments before they’re made permanent and public. What we do know is that there are numerous examples of law-enforcement work being co-opted for political purposes under this administration, specifically under Kash Patel’s FBI, which has at times prioritized going after the president’s enemies and critics despite what the facts show. I think there is cause for concern, making it even more important that certain oversight offices have been eliminated from within the Department of Homeland Security. Historically, the FBI may have done the first investigation, but ideally an objective inspector general would have come in next, followed by the ICE Office of Professional Responsibility and then the Office for Civil Rights and Civil Liberties. There were lots of layers to get to the truth and to mitigate any political bias.

FHFA Director William Pulte on Friday said they had started with a $3 billion initial round of purchases. The Fed holds just over $2 trillion of MBS, a legacy of the central bank's past efforts to provide stimulus to the economy during crises like the global financial crisis and more recently the pandemic. But that stash has been shrinking for more than two years at a rate of between $15 billion and $17 billion a month, a dynamic that some have said is preventing mortgage rates from falling further than they have over the last year or so. The average rate on a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage has fallen to around 6.2% from nearly 8% in 2024, but remains well above levels in the 3% range seen during the pandemic. Borrowing costs and elevated housing prices together have exacerbated the affordability problem that is weighing on Trump's approval ratings. Bessent said the purchases - being funded by the two firms' own balance sheets - were unlikely to directly bring mortgage rates down, but could do so indirectly by reducing the yield spread on Fannie and Freddie securities over U.S. Treasuries. The two firms support the housing market by purchasing loans originated by banks and other direct home lenders, repackaging those loans into bonds and selling those to investors. The purchases reopen space on lenders' balance sheets to make new loans. Trump and his team have also been talking about reprivatizing Fannie and Freddie, which came into government ownership in 2008 during the financial crisis. Bessent said the purchases would not harm their financial standing, asserting the two have ample cash and the actions could increase their earnings.

Alberta Premier Danielle Smith is calling on Ottawa to further speed up its approval process for major projects, saying she wants to see applications green-lit within six months.\n\nPrime Minister Mark Carney's major projects office, established last year, currently aims to complete regulatory reviews within two years.\n\nSmith, in a letter to Carney shared on social media Friday, said that two years is too long, considering the recent U.S. capture of Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro and U.S. President Donald Trump's plan to ramp up oil production in the South American country.\n\n\"Renewed Venezuelan crude production, supported by United States investment, will ultimately increase the amount of heavy oil bound for U.S. refineries and directly compete with Canadian production for limited refining capacity,\" Smith said in the letter.\n\nThe premier, who said she had a \"positive\" meeting with Carney on Friday discussing the developments in Venezuela, has previously said Maduro's capture underscored the need for new pipelines, including one to the West Coast being pitched and planned by her government.\n\nSmith's letter says an application for such a pipeline will be submitted by June, and asks that it be approved no later than fall.\n\nConservative Leader Pierre Poilievre called for an even quicker approval of Alberta's desired pipeline, saying Ottawa should sign off on it within 60 days of receiving the application.\n\nA route for the pipeline and a private-sector proponent have yet to be determined.\n\nSmith said in her letter that \"within the current geopolitical context, timelines of up to two years are still woefully long\" and put Canada at risk, especially since the U.S. is accelerating its own oil and gas projects.\n\n\"Any delay risks ceding market share, losing investment, and undermining Canada's competitive position in a rapidly changing global energy landscape.\"\n\nTrump met with executives from 17 major oil companies Friday, saying he expected at least US$100 billion in investments to expand oil production in Venezuela, which has the largest proven reserves in the world. \n\nThe president also promised \"government protection\" for those investments, saying the U.S. was able to work with Delcy Rodriguez, Venezuela's interim president, and that the companies would be dealing with his administration directly when it comes to oil production.\n\nSmith's letter says there is proven demand for Alberta's heavy oil in Asia and that a new pipeline — and an expansion of the existing Trans Mountain pipeline connecting her province to the B.C. tidewater — would secure further investments and stabilize oil prices, which make or break her government's budgets.\n\n\"As a stable democracy

to 'address injuries' as concerned fans wish her a 'safe recovery'","text":"Days after Kai Trump was seen with a stability bandage on her left wrist, President Trump's granddaughter and aspiring professional golfer has shared that she has undergone surgery.\n\nThe 18-year-old who has signed to join the University of Miami’s golf team in 2026, told her 2.7 million Instagram followers that the surgery was to \"address injuries to the stabilizing tissues of my ECU tendon and damage to my triangular fibrocartilage complex.\"\n\n\"The surgery was successfully performed at the Lehigh Valley Orthopedic Institute by Dr. Thomas Graham, Chief of Jefferson Orthopedics,\" she wrote, concluding: \"I look forward to my rehab ahead in the coming months. I am excited for the ability to play golf pain free!\"\n\n\"Get well fast Kai,\" her father, Donald Trump Jr commented, as others shared that they were praying \"for a speedy recovery\".\n\nKai is set to graduate from high school in Florida this summer, and will enroll at the University of Miami and their golf team in the fall of 2026. Kai is currently ranked No. 461 in the American Junior Golf Association standings.\n\nShe has been mentored partly by Tiger Woods who is dating Kai’s mother, Vanessa; Vanessa was previously married to Donald Trump Jr. for 12 years before their split in 2018.\n\nIn November she took part in her first-ever LPGA Tour.Kai was awarded a sponsor's invitation due to her high-profile status as the President's grand-daughter, and during a press conference, the teen revealed the piece of advice that Donald had given her ahead of the big day.\n\n\"Go out there and have fun. Just don't get nervous,\" she said.\n\nAs for the advice Tiger had given her, she added: \"I mean, he is the best golfer in the entire world, I would say that. And an even better person. He told me to go out there and have fun and just go with the flow. Whatever happens, happens.\"\n\nAs well as a student and golfer, Kai is a vlogger, offering her Gen Z perspective on the world. In December, she gave viewers an insight on the controversial changes that had taken place inside the White House,, including the demolition of the East Wing, a portion of the White House that was built in 1902, significantly expanded in 1942 by President Franklin Roosevelt's wife Eleanor, and became the professional home for First Ladies in the following decades.\n\nTrump demolished the wing in 2025 for the construction of a 90,000-square-foot ballroom, a project estimated to cost around $300 million which has been funded via private donations from individuals, corporations and tech companies, including Google and Amazon.\n\nIn the clip, Kai walked through the building alongside her grandfather, who paused to point out a statue of Abraham Lincoln.\n\n\"I got this from the East Wing. This came out of the East Wing, the famous East Wing. This looks good, doesn’t it, here? The same man that did Mount Rushmore,\" he said.","summary":"Kai Trump,  who has signed to join the University of Miami’s golf team in 2026, told her 2.7 million Instagram followers that the surgery was to 'address injuries to the stabilizing tissues of my ECU tendon'","url":"https://www.hellomagazine.com/celebrities/877116/kai-trump-undergoes-surgery-address-injuries/","image":"https://images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/landscape/b698f0f450b9-gettyimages-2246151748.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-10 00:02:03","author":"Rebecca Lewis","authors":["Rebecca Lewis"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":0.177},{"id":392169994,"title":"Trump's Greenland remarks worrying: FM","text":"Foreign Minister Elina Valtonen on Thursday described recent remarks by U.S. President Donald Trump and members of his administration on Greenland as \"worrying,\" while reiterating Finland's support for Denmark and Greenland's right to self-determination, reported Xinhua.\n\nValtonen made the comments at a press conference at Finnish parliament after an extraordinary meeting of the parliamentary Foreign Affairs Committee, which discussed U.S. statements on Greenland and the situation in Venezuela, as well as other security issues.\n\nShe said Denmark has assessed that U.S. messages on Greenland must be taken seriously and that Finland is relying on Denmark's assessment.\n\n\"Finland and the other Nordic countries have exceptional expertise in Arctic conditions, and we are happy to make use of that together with our North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) allies to strengthen Arctic security, but it cannot be done by threatening allies,\" Valtonen said, as Washington has framed the Greenland issue in Arctic security terms.\n\nJohannes Koskinen, chair of the Foreign Affairs Committee, said it was \"unprecedented\" for threats of violence to be made within NATO against another member in connection with seizing territory, adding that such threats run counter to the United Nations Charter and that their inconsistency with international law should be underscored at all levels.\n\nValtonen said a U.S. security strategy published in December already signaled a move away from a multilateral, rules-based order toward the notion of spheres of interest, a direction she said runs against Finland's security policy outlook.\n\nShe said Finland has conveyed in its contacts with the United States that resorting to \"the prerogative of the most powerful\" would not serve even the long-term interests of the most powerful.\n\nValtonen also described as \"quite a piece of news\" the U.S. announcement that it would withdraw from 66 international organizations and agreements.\n\nThe press conference followed briefings in which Finnish officials and experts updated lawmakers on the evolving international situation and its implications for Finland's security and foreign policy.","url":"https://www.dailyfinland.fi/national/47184/Trumps-Greenland-remarks-worrying-FM","image":"https://www.dailyfinland.fi/assets/news_photos/2026/01/08/image-47184-1767908390.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-10 00:00:00","author":"Hanne Salonen","authors":["Hanne Salonen"],"language":"en","source_country":"fi","sentiment":-0.038},{"id":392170008,"title":"US may lose voting rights at UNGA at certain point: UN spokesperson","text":"The United States may lose its voting rights at the UN General Assembly at some point if it does not pay its dues to the United Nations for a certain number of years, a UN spokesperson said Thursday, reported Xinhua.\n\n \"Well, the (UN) Charter is clear ... about what happens when a country doesn't pay its dues for a certain number of years,\" said Stephane Dujarric, spokesperson for the UN secretary-general, in response to questions about the implications if a UN member state does not pay its dues to the United Nations.\n\n \"It's Article 19.

An internet watchdog organization described the move as a precursor to a possible violent crackdown, although the blackout did not immediately prevent the posting of videos of the protests, said the CNN report.\n\nIran's capital, Tehran, and several other parts of the country experienced an internet blackout on Thursday, reported Xinhua, quoting an internet monitoring group said.\n\n NetBlocks, the monitoring group, said on its website that, \"Live metrics show Iran is now in the midst of a nationwide internet blackout.\"\n\n Xinhua reporters based in Tehran have experienced the blackout, starting from around 8:15 p.m. local time (1645 GMT).\n\n The blackout is reportedly the consequence of ongoing protests in several Iranian cities since late last month, including the latest in Tehran on Thursday, over the sharp fall in the rial and long-standing economic hardships.\n\n Iran's semi-official Mehr news agency reported Thursday that 23 police officers and one \"rioter\" were injured during clashes in northeastern Iran's Khorasan Razavi over the past days, amid protests in the province.\n\n Five people were killed in an attack by \"rioters\" on a police station in the province on Wednesday night, it added.\n\nMeanwhile, U.S. President Donald Trump on Thursday threatened again to strike Iran \"very hard\" if its authorities \"start killing people\" protesting in the Middle Eastern country, reported Xinhua.\n\n \"I have let them know that if they start killing people ... we are going to hit them very hard,\" Trump said in an interview with a conservative radio.\n\n Trump and other senior U.S. officials recently warned on several occasions that Washington would act if Iran \"kills peaceful protesters.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Iran's Foreign Ministry has condemned what it described as \"interventionist and deceptive\" remarks by U.S. officials on recent unrest in the country, saying they reflected Washington's continued hostility toward the Iranian people.\n\n In a statement issued late on Wednesday, the ministry said U.S. comments on Iran's internal affairs were part of a long-standing policy of pressure and interference, rather than genuine concern for the welfare of Iranians.\n\n Protests have erupted in several Iranian cities since late last month over the sharp fall in the rial and long-standing economic hardships.

We don’t want you to deal with Venezuela.”\n\nTrump added: “Our giant oil companies will be spending at least $100bn of their money, not the government’s money. They don’t need government money. But they need government protection.”\n\nTrump welcomed the oil executives to the White House after US forces earlier on Friday seized their fifth tanker over the past month that has been linked to Venezuelan oil. The action reflected the determination of the US to fully control the exporting, refining and production of Venezuelan petroleum, a sign of the Trump administration’s plans for ongoing involvement in the sector as it seeks commitments from private companies.\n\n“At least 100 Billion Dollars will be invested by BIG OIL, all of whom I will be meeting with today at The White House,” Trump said on Friday in a predawn social media post.\n\nThe White House said it invited oil executives from 17 companies, including Chevron, which still operates in Venezuela, as well as ExxonMobil and ConocoPhillips, which both had oil projects in the country that were lost as part of a 2007 nationalisation of private businesses under former President Nicolas Maduro’s predecessor, Hugo Chavez.\n\n“If we look at the commercial constructs and frameworks in place today in Venezuela, today it’s un-investable,” said Darren Woods, ExxonMobil CEO. “And so significant changes have to be made to those commercial frameworks, the legal system, there has to be durable investment protections and there has to be change to the hydrocarbon laws in the country.”\n\nBenjamin Radd, a senior fellow at the UCLA Burkle Center for International Relations, told Al Jazeera that he had “noted the hesitation and less-than-full-throated enthusiasm for re-entering the Venezuelan market”, citing Woods, who told the gathering that the company had its assets there seized twice already.\n\n“The bottom line is that until Trump can outline and provide assurances of a plan towards political stability, it will continue to be a risky endeavour for these oil companies to re-engage Venezuela. And what is there is a regime change in Iran in the days or weeks or months to come, and all of a sudden that re-emerges as a place where Western oil companies can do business? Even though the reserves don’t equal what Venezuela has, the risk is far less, and the infrastructure is more sound,” Radd said.\n\nOther companies invited included Halliburton, Valero, Marathon, Shell, Singapore-based Trafigura, Italy-based Eni and Spain-based Repsol, as well as a vast swath of domestic and international companies with interests ranging from construction to the commodity markets.\n\nWait and see\n\nLarge US oil companies have so far largely refrained from affirming investments in Venezuela, as contracts and guarantees need to be in place. Trump has suggested that the US would help to backstop any investments.\n\nVenezuela’s oil production has slumped below one million barrels per day (bpd). Part of Trump’s challenge to turn that around will be to convince oil companies that his administration has a stable relationship with Venezuela’s interim President Delcy Rodriguez, as well as protections for companies entering the market.\n\nWhile Rodriguez has publicly denounced Trump and the abduction and ouster of Maduro, the US president has said that to date, Venezuela’s interim leader has been cooperating behind the scenes with his administration.\n\nMost companies are in a wait-and-see mode as they await terms from the Venezuelans, stability and wait to find out how much the US government will actually help, said Rachel Ziemba, an adjunct senior fellow at the Center for a New American Security.\n\nThose like Chevron that are already in there are in a better position to increase investments as they “already have sunk costs”, Ziemba pointed out.\n\nZiemba said she expects a partial ramp-up in the first half of this year as the volumes that were going to China – Venezuelan oil’s largest buyer – are redirected and sold via the US. “But long-term investments will be slow,” she said as companies wait to find out about US commitments and Venezuelan terms.\n\nTyson Slocum, director of the consumer advocacy group Public Citizen’s energy programme, criticised the gathering and called the US military’s removal of Maduro “violent imperialism”. Slocum added that Trump’s goal appears to be to “hand billionaires control over Venezuela’s oil”.\n\nSo far, the US government has not said how the revenue from the sale of Venezuelan oil will be shared and what percentage of the sales would be given to Caracas.\n\nZiemba said she was worried that “if funds do not go to Venezuela for basic goods, among other local needs, there will be instability that will deepen the country’s economic crisis“.\n\nIn the news conference on Friday, Trump said the US had a formula for distributing payments. UCLA’s Radd said that “if the US can or will guarantee security and stability, it makes sense for it to expect a return on investment in that sense. But then this makes it sound more like a mafia-style ‘racket’ than a government-led operation”, he told Al Jazeera.\n\nMeanwhile, the US and Venezuelan governments said on Friday they were exploring the possibility of restoring diplomatic relations between the two countries, and a delegation from the Trump administration arrived in the South American nation on Friday.","summary":"Experts said oil execs gave a &#039;less-than-full-throated&#039; approval as they waited on terms from US and Venezuela.","url":"https://www.aljazeera.com/economy/2026/1/9/trump-promises-oil-executives-total-safety-if-they-invest-in-venezuela?traffic_source=rss","image":"https://www.aljazeera.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/2026-01-03T165300Z_824548544_RC2STIA7D0LY_RTRMADP_3_USA-VENEZUELA_cropped-1767460525.jpg?resize=1920%2C1440","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-09 23:55:55","author":"Al Jazeera,Apps Support","authors":["Al Jazeera","Apps Support"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"QA","sentiment":-0.175},{"id":392172390,"title":"Forecasting Supreme Court's Trump tariff ruling, refund and trade implications","text":"to top close Video This video is playing in picture-in-picture.\n\nKudlow January 09, 2026 02:01 \n\n Forecasting Supreme Court's Trump tariff ruling, refund and trade implications \n Former Deputy Assistant Attorney General John Yoo analyzes the Supreme Court's delay on President Donald Trump's tariffs and discusses the complexities of a potential refund process on ‘Kudlow.’\n\nTags WHAT TO WATCHSHOWSKUDLOWKUDLOW | LATEST EPISODESV-VIDEOS","summary":"Former Deputy Assistant Attorney General John Yoo analyzes the Supreme Court&apos;s delay on President Donald Trump&apos;s tariffs and discusses the complexities of a potential refund process on ‘Kudlow.’","url":"https://www.foxbusiness.com/video/6387497529112","image":"https://a57.foxnews.com/cf-images.us-east-1.prod.boltdns.net/v1/static/854081161001/24b08ad3-5393-4a15-98b0-72bbe1bc8509/e7793adc-e4d8-46df-abea-8e05ba7a6527/1280x720/match/1024/512/image.jpg?ve=1&tl=1","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-09 23:54:57","author":null,"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.31},{"id":392171926,"title":"Chevron sees pathway to grow Venezuela production by 50%, US energy secretary says","text":"WASHINGTON, Jan 9 (Reuters) - U.S. Energy Secretary Chris Wright said on Friday that Chevron saw a pathway to grow its Venezuela production by 50%, with his comments coming after a meeting that President Donald Trump had with oil companies on the South American nation.

Vance, Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Energy Secretary Chris Wright and Interior Secretary Doug Burgum.\n\n“We’re going to discuss how these great American companies can help rapidly rebuild Venezuela’s dilapidated oil industry and bring millions of barrels in oil production to benefit the United States, the people of Venezuela and the entire world,” Trump said to begin the meeting. \n\n“We’re going to be working with Venezuela, we’re going to be making the decision as to which oil companies are going to go in, that we’re going to allow to go in,” Trump said. “We’re gonna cut a deal with companies. We’ll probably do that today or very shortly thereafter.”\n\nTrump pitched Venezuela as an opportunity for companies to profit, saying that the companies would have “total security.” \n\nThe oil company executives were less enthused.\n\n“If we look at the legal and commercial constructs and frameworks in place today in Venezuela today, it’s uninvestable,” Exxon CEO Darren Woods said in the meeting. “And so significant changes have to be made to those commercial frameworks, the legal system. There has to be durable investment protections, and there has to be a change to the hydrocarbon laws in the country.”\n\nWoods said the company had its assets in Venezuela seized twice, losing billions, and that the company takes a decades-long view when choosing to enter a country. \n\n“The investments that we make span decades and decades,” Woods said. “So we do not go into any opportunity with a short mindset, short-term mindset. There’s a value proposition that we have to meet.”\n\nBut Woods also did not rule out Exxon’s return to Venezuela, saying he believed the necessary changes could be made and that it would be “absolutely critical” to get a technical team in the country to better assess the situation. \n\n“We’re confident that with this administration and President Trump, working hand in hand with the Venezuelan government, that those changes can be put in place,” he said. \n\nExecutives from Chevron, Exxon, Conoco Phillips, Continental, Halliburton, HKN, Valero, Marathon, Shell, Trafigura, Vitol Americas, Repsol, Eni, Aspect Holdings, Tallgrass, Raisa Energy and Hilcorp were expected to attend the meeting, which was live streamed with the press corps in attendance.\n\nVenezuela holds the largest known oil reserve in the world at an estimated 303 billion barrels, but getting companies to make the investments to get the oil may be a tough sell. \n\nOil companies are reported to be wary of operating in Venezuela, after companies had their assets seized in 2007 when then-President Hugo Chavez nationalized the country’s oil industry. Since then much of the oil infrastructure in the country has fallen into disrepair, and the workforce fled. \n\nEnergy consulting firm Rystad Energy estimated it would take “at least $30 to $35 billion” in capital over the next two to three years to return Venezuela to its pre-Chavez level of production, and $184 billion over the next 14 years. \n\nTrump has said he wants oil companies to invest $100 billion toward the effort. \n\nThere would be heavy environmental costs as well. Trump himself has called Venezuelan oil some of the “dirtiest, worst oil” in the world. Described as “extra-heavy crude,” Venezuela’s oil is a tar-like substance that must be heated to bring it to the surface and mixed with chemicals to be transported in pipelines. An analysis by clean energy nonprofit RMI found Venezuela’s oil to produce more greenhouse gas emissions per barrel than that of the other 54 leading oil-producing nations in 2024. \n\nThe heavy crude, like Canadian tar sands oil, requires additional refining because of its poor quality, further increasing the energy needed to turn it into a usable product. \n\nThat refining would likely take place in Black communities in Texas and Louisiana where the populations are already heavily impacted by the oil industry. \n\nA spokesperson for the American Petroleum Institute, a trade group representing U.S. oil and gas industry interests, said the industry welcomed the collaboration with the White House, but said investment decisions would be made by individual companies. \n\n“Our industry welcomes the President’s invitation to discuss how American energy leadership, global markets, and developments in Venezuela intersect,” the spokesperson said in an email. “As always, our role is to share industry expertise and perspective, while any investment decisions are made independently by individual companies and depend on fundamental conditions such as security, the rule of law, market factors, and stable governance.” \n\nTrump posted to social media Friday that a “very big factor in this involvement will be the reduction of Oil Prices for the American People.” \n\nBut crude oil prices are already as low as they’ve been since early 2021, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. The EIA states that in 2025, there was more supply in the global crude oil market than demand.","summary":"President Donald Trump’s meeting with oil industry executives was high on praise for Trump and his actions in Venezuela, but low on commitments from U.S. oil majors to invest the billions of dollars it would take to revive the country’s foundering oil industry.&#160; Less than a week after a U.S. military operation captured and arrested [&#8230;]","url":"https://insideclimatenews.org/news/09012026/trump-pitches-venezuela-to-oil-executives/","image":"https://insideclimatenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/GettyImages-2254860060-1024x683.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-09 23:48:16","author":"By Dennis Pillion,Derek Harrison","authors":["By Dennis Pillion","Derek Harrison"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.334},{"id":392169138,"title":"New video emerges of Minnesota shooting, further inflaming tensions","text":"Minneapolis - The White House on Friday reposted on social media a new video taken from the cellphone of the immigration officer who fatally shot a Minnesota woman in her car this week, adding to the documentation of an incident that has sparked days of protests in the U.S.The 47-second video shows 37-year-old Renee Good telling the officer, 'That's fine, dude, I'm not mad at you,' moments before he opens fire after Good puts the car in gear in an apparent effort to pull back into the street.The new clip is likely to further inflame tensions between state officials and officials in U.S. President Donald Trump's administration, who have offered ​starkly different accounts of the shooting.

U.S. District Judge Arun Subramanian in Manhattan, an appointee of Democratic former President Joe Biden, said he issued a temporary restraining order for the reasons stated in a legal filing by California, Colorado, Illinois, Minnesota and New York, which filed the lawsuit. The White House did not immediately respond to an email seeking comment on the ruling. The states sued the Trump administration late on Thursday, two days after the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services announced the freeze. Funds that were frozen include more than $7 billion from the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families program, which provides cash to low-income families with children. The funds also included $2.4 billion from the Child Care and Development Fund, which helps make childcare more affordable, and about $870 million in social services grants for children. HHS said it had concerns about \"widespread fraud and misuse of taxpayer dollars\" in the five states' welfare programs, including the possibility people other than U.S. citizens and lawful permanent residents might be receiving benefits. U.S. Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins on Friday said the Department of Agriculture had frozen federal benefit programs for Minnesota, citing fraud allegations. Minnesota Governor Tim Walz, a Democrat who was former Vice President Kamala Harris' running mate in the 2024 presidential election won by Trump, a Republican, announced on Monday he will not seek a third term so he can focus on the fraud scandal. The five states said HHS lacked a legitimate justification for this week's funding freeze and had usurped Congress' power to allocate the money. They also called the unsubstantiated fraud allegations a pretext to justify the lawsuit, whose real purpose was to \"punish perceived political enemies of the Trump Administration by unlawfully withholding critical funding pending purported fraud detection measures unauthorized by any statute.\" (Reporting by Jack Queen in New York; Editing by Chris Reese) By Jonathan Stempel and Blake Brittain","url":"https://www.marketscreener.com/news/judge-blocks-trump-from-freezing-10-billion-in-child-family-aid-to-five-us-states-ce7e59d3dd80f52c","image":"https://cdn.zonebourse.com/static/resize/0/0//images/reuters/2026-01/2026-01-10T003000Z_1_LYNXMPEM0900A_RTROPTP_4_USA-TRUMP.JPG","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-09 23:40:19","author":"Reuters","authors":["Reuters"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"fr","sentiment":-0.135},{"id":392153924,"title":"Trump says protest-hit Iran in ‘big trouble,’ again threatens military strike","text":"US President Donald Trump said on Friday that Iran, faced with major protests, was in “big trouble” and again warned he could order military strikes.\n“Iran’s in big trouble.

Trading houses and oil companies, including Chevron, Vitol and Trafigura, are competing for U.S. government deals to export crude from Venezuela, sources said, after President Donald Trump said that Venezuela is set to turn over as much as 50 million barrels of sanctioned oil to the United States. Trafigura said in a meeting with the White House on Friday that its first vessel should load in the next week. Faced with a U.S. blockade in recent months, Venezuela has been storing oil in tankers and has nearly completely filled storage tanks onshore. The vessels holding the oil are old, poorly maintained, and under sanctions. Other vessels cannot make direct contact with sanctioned ships due to liability and insurance requirements, even if the U.S. grants licenses, the sources said. Onshore tanks have also not been maintained for years, posing risks for parties trying to load the oil. Shipping companies Maersk and American Eagle Tankers are among the firms looking to expand their ship-to-ship transfer operations in Venezuela, three of the sources said. Maersk could replicate the ship-to-shore-to-ship logistics it has used before in Amuay Bay in Venezuela, one source said. Maersk already has operations in nearby Aruba and Curacao, islands whose waters are often used to transfer Venezuelan oil. However, while the transfers are possible in Aruba and U.S. ports, they are more expensive. \"With 17 employees in the country, Maersk's presence in Venezuela is limited. All employees are safe and accounted for, and there are currently no changes to our ocean services. Operations continue, with only minor delays at this stage, and we continue to monitor the situation closely,\" the company said in a statement. Transfer operations will also be complicated by a shortage of smaller ships to move oil from the storage vessels to piers from where the oil can be transferred to another ship, as well as inadequate maintenance of machinery and equipment, another shipping source said. AET, which already helps transfer Chevron's shipments of Venezuelan crude to the U.S., is being approached by potential clients to expand its capacity in that area, two of the sources said. AET and Chevron did not immediately respond to requests for comment. While supply could reach the 500,000 barrels per day Venezuela previously exported to the U.S. before sanctions and would drain accumulated inventories in 90-120 days, it will be difficult to meet that goal if oil must be taken from both tankers and onshore storage, the sources said. Companies are also competing fiercely for loading slots at Venezuela's main Jose oil terminal, where there are capacity and speed limitations. Chevron, a key joint venture partner in the country, is also aggressively vying to keep its privileged position at Venezuela's terminals, while lining up its vessel fleet, one source said. Oil companies, including Chevron, Vitol, Trafigura, are already sourcing supplies of much-needed naphtha, an industry source in Venezuela said. The naphtha is typically blended into the heavy Venezuelan crude to lower its density, and make it easier to transport and process at refineries.

Lauren Boebert (R-Colo.) to secure clean drinking water for her constituents. This came even though just last month, the bill had passed unanimously. \n\nThis time, only 24 Republicans voted for the initiative. \n\n“This is a bill that, in policy, no one in that chamber disagreed with,” Boebert told The Independent in a gaggle after the vote on Thursday. “This was purely political, and it's very unfortunate, but I'm not taking it out personally on anybody. I'm going to use my frustration as motivation to continue to get this over the line.”\n\nWhile it’s not clear why exactly Trump vetoed the legislation, it’s hard not to see that Trump hung Boebert, one of his most enthusiastic supporters in the House, literally out to dry after she joined the discharge petition to force a vote to release files related to Jeffrey Epstein.\n\nIt reveals the double-bind Republicans face: as the president becomes increasingly unpopular or when he directly defies their local interests, they have to find ways to break with him. But his megaphone and sway on the Republican electorate remains tight. \n\nOn Thursday, five Republicans joined with Senate Democrats on a War Powers Act resolution to rein in any future activity in Venezuela. One of the Republicans, Sen. Josh Hawley of Missouri, insisted to reporters that he did not mean to cross the president. \n\n“This is all about going forward, if the president should determine, ‘you know what, I need to put troops on the ground in Venezuela, I think that wouldn't require Congress,’” Hawley said. \n\nIt didn’t work. Later that day, Trump lit into Hawley and his cohorts –Sens. Rand Paul of Kentucky, Susan Collins of Maine, Lisa Murkowski of Alaska and Todd Young of Indiana –for voting for the resolution, saying they “should never be elected to office again.”\n\nIt’s a bold statement, considering Collins is up for re-election in what will be a tough race and her occasional votes with Democrats are the only thing that keeps her afloat in liberal New England. \n\nSen. John Cornyn of Texas, who is up for re-election this year, told reporters not to make too much of it. \n\n“I think you should check back with him and see how he feels in a few days,” he told reporters on Thursday. “But obviously, he was irritated with that outcome. I think it was a bad outcome myself, because I think people are interpreting this as somehow a rebuke.”\n\nCornyn needs to stay on Trump’s good side to survive a bruising primary against Attorney General Ken Paxton and avoid Trump endorsing the super-MAGA Paxton.\n\nThat might give Republicans less of an incentive to vote on a War Powers resolution pushed by Democratic Sen. Ruben Gallego to prevent Trump from putting troops on the ground in Greenland. \n\nThe only Republican who seems comfortable lighting into Stephen Miller, the most vocal champion of the idea, is retiring Sen. Thom Tillis of North Carolina.\n\n“It should be to Stephen Miller that if he wants to take a position that the president supports, that's fine. He doesn't speak for me,” he told The Independent. “And I'm just saying, keep in your lane or know what you're talking about and never represent it.”\n\nOn the other side of the Capitol that same day, 17 Republicans defected to vote for legislation with Democrats to extend the expanded tax credits for the Affordable Care Act’s health insurance marketplace. \n\nAlmost all of them are in tough re-election races. But don’t expect Trump to give them breathing room for siding with Democrats. It’s only a matter of time before he turns his attention to them the way he did Boebert.\n\nAnd Republicans learn they have to tread lightly around Trump. Many Hispanics in South Florida who voted for Trump hoped that his capture of Venezuela’s Nicolas Maduro would be the beginning of Democracy. But Trump has shown little interest in supporting opposition leader Maria Corina Machado, instead propping up Maduro’s deputy Delcy Rodriguez. \n\nBut when asked about it, Rep. Carlos Gimenez of Florida, who is Cuban-American, did not seem bothered.\n\n“It's a means to an end,” he told The Independent. “It's up to the Venezuelan people to that's whoever the Venezuelan people want. And right now, I believe the Venezuelan people want Maria Corina Machado.”\n\nAnd Republicans need only look at the fate of Marjorie Taylor Greene, Boeber’s former friend and colleague, who formally tendered her resignation at the beginning of this week after she clashed with Trump about the release of Epstein files.","summary":"Trump is increasingly unpopular and Republicans need to create some distance between him and them, Eric Garcia writes.

Email tips@dailymail.co.uk\nBy LAURA PARKIN, SHOWBUSINESS REPORTER \n Published:21:36 GMT, 9 January 2026 |Updated:23:30 GMT, 9 January 2026 \n\nBrooklyn Beckham shared a gushing birthday tribute to wife Nicola Peltz on Friday as he branded himself the 'luckiest man' despite his ongoing family feud. \nIt came just hours after he copied his estranged dad David Beckham on motorbike ride after he asked his parents to contact him only via his lawyers.\nBrushing off the drama, Brooklyn, 26, wished his 'beautiful girl' Nicola a happy 31st birthday, but notably turned the comments on his post off, in a bid to avoid questions from his followers. \nSharing some photos from their wedding day to Instagram, he wrote: 'My dear Nicola x happy birthday beautiful girl x \n'I love you with all my heart and I am the luckiest man to call you my wife x \n'You are the funniest and most hard working person I know x can’t wait to stay young with you baby girl xx.'\n\nBrooklyn Beckham shared a gushing birthday tribute to wife Nicola Peltz on Friday as he branded himself the 'luckiest man' despite his ongoing bitter family feud (pictured in 2024) \n\nBrushing off the drama, Brooklyn, 26, wished his 'beautiful girl' Nicola a happy 31st birthday and shared his love for her (pictured in 2024) \nBrooklyn's social media update came after he headed out on an identical Harley Davidson chopper to him.\nOn Thursday, the Daily Mail revealed that relations between the Beckhams broke down so completely last summer that at one point, Brooklyn asked his parents David and Victoria to contact him only via his lawyers.\nIt was also claimed that despite his feud with his parents, he has been in regular contact with four family members - both sets of his grandparents. \nHowever despite their apparent estrangement, Brooklyn channelled his dad as he was spotted cruising through West Hollywood on a motorbike. \nBrooklyn was driving a Harley Davidson Chopper motorcycle, featuring a fluffy seat, as he peered out from behind an orange-tinted visor.\nThe snaps were reminiscent of one of Brooklyn's dad David riding his $60,000 custom-built Harley-Davidson Knucklehead motorbike - which he was first seen on in 2013. \nSlight differences came in the form of the helmet, as Brooklyn wore a $850 Hedon helmet cruiser while David's was a bobber.\nIt was this week revealed that Brooklyn instructed his parents to only contact him through lawyers. \n\nSharing some photos to Instagram, he wrote: 'My dear Nicola x happy birthday beautiful girl x 'I love you with all my heart and I am the luckiest man to call you my wife' \n\nIt came just hours after he copied his estranged dad David Beckham on motorbike ride after he asked his parents to contact him only via his lawyers (David and Victoria in October) \n\nBrooklyn's social media update came after he headed out on an identical Harley Davidson chopper to him (pictured)\n\nThe snaps were reminiscent of one of Brooklyn's dad David riding a Harley Davidson motorbike in Los Angeles (Pictured)\n\nIt comes after Brooklyn said he didn't want his parents to contact him, or make public statements about him on social media\nBrooklyn said he didn't want his parents to contact him, or make public statements about him on social media.\nThere was no legal action between them – and no legal basis for the letter, which was simply a request.\nBut it followed what Brooklyn considered to be a series of 'nasty' briefings about his wife Nicola, including the suggestion that he was a 'hostage' being 'controlled' by his wife.\nThis week, publicists and friends on both sides refused to discuss the matter, still hoping that things will calm down and be resolved.\nHowever one source said: 'David was told to speak to them via Schillings. That was the only way for them to communicate.'\nThe 'talk to my lawyers' move might explain why Brooklyn opted to block his parents – and siblings Romeo, Cruz and Harper – on social media just before Christmas.\nThe family had been viewing and liking his cooking posts. And it was felt this was contrary to Brooklyn's wish they would leave him and his wife alone.\nDavid BeckhamInstagramBrooklyn Beckham\n\nShare or comment on this article: \nBrooklyn Beckham shares gushing birthday tribute to wife Nicola Peltz - but turns comments OFF just hours after copying dad David Beckham on motorbike ride amid feud\n\nAdd comment\n\nComments 133\n\n Share what you think\n\nWorst rated\n\nThe comments below have not been moderated.\n\nThe views expressed in the contents above are those of our users and do not necessarily reflect the views of MailOnline.\n\nAdd your comment\n\nEnter your comment\n\nBy posting your comment you agree to our house rules.\n\nSubmit Comment\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual.\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual\n\nWe will automatically post your comment and a link to the news story to your Facebook timeline at the same time it is posted on MailOnline.

The killing of 37-year-old Renee Macklin Good by an ICE agent in Minneapolis on Wednesday morning was caught on video from multiple angles; The New York Times, The Washington Post, 404 Media and more did video analysis of the killing. Watching the videos, they show, very clearly, that the Trump administration lied about what happened.\n\nThen came the last video; the video from the camera of Jonathan E. Ross, the ICE agent who shot Good three times in the face in the first and only homicide in the city of Minneapolis in 2026. Even by the standards of our current media environment, it’s hard to watch. It was obtained by a right-wing news outlet called Alpha News. You have to presume someone thought leaking the video made Ross look good. \n\nWhich is lunacy. In the video, Ross is filming as he exits an unmarked SUV. Good’s maroon Honda Pilot is stopped sideways across the road; she has a dog in the back seat, with the window open. When he circles around to her side Good says, “That’s fine, dude. I’m not mad at you.” She says it again: “I’m not mad at you.” Her wife, Rebecca Good, who is standing beside the car, is more confrontational, but hardly threatening: she appears to be a middle-aged woman with a cellphone and a whistle around her neck; as her statement said, they were there to support their neighbours. She says, “you want to come at us? I say you go get yourself some lunch, big boy. Go ahead.”\n\nOn the other side of the car masked, heavily armed ICE agents have rapidly approached Good’s vehicle — in another video you can hear her say, “I’m pulling out.” The audio isn’t clear, but one agent sounds like he says, “Go, get out of here,” and the other is at her door saying, “Get out of the car, get out of the f—-ing car.” Good backs her car up. Her wife tries the passenger side door handle, but Good appears to be panicking. In Ross’s video she is also, very clearly, going hand over hand on the steering wheel to her right. Ever see someone do a three-point turn? Watching the video, you see her pointing the vehicle away from Ross’s camera.\n\nRoss appears to fumble his camera as he shoots her three times: we are told he shot her once through the windshield, twice though the side window. And as the SUV rolls away with its driver dead, we hear a voice close to the camera say, “F—-ing bitch” right before she crashes into a parked car.\n\nThere is no way to watch — especially after watching the other videos, frame by frame if necessary — and say Ross was justified in wildly shooting three times at a 37-year-old, moon-faced poet on a crowded street. And to be clear, everything that happened in that video echoed videos from the last several months from cities across America: twitchy, entitled, masked paramilitary ICE or Border Patrol agents with hair-trigger anger, who, in the words of Vice President JD Vance, “were going door-to-door trying to find criminal illegal aliens and deport them.”\n\nBut Vance, who so often displays a hideous level of depravity , led the charge of right-wing figures who, as with previous videos, tried to tell people not to believe their own eyes. It is almost destabilizing to witness how the American MAGA project, from government to influencers to friendly media, has handled this, even as it crystallizes how they handle everything: they lie about obvious truths, and viciously attack their enemies before the blood is dry. So a 37-year-old mom in a Honda Pilot who had just dropped off her six-year-old at school and had a dog in the back seat and stuffed animals in the glove compartment was labelled a domestic terrorist, and it was done with the full weight of a secret police-employing government. The party that insisted people mourn Charlie Kirk deplored anybody who mourned Good.\n\nAs America is broken apart the cracks are everywhere, but the killing of Renee Macklin Good seems like a chasm. On Twitter, the glee with which large swathes of MAGA accounts greeted the killing evoked a sort of Radio Rwanda, and as relentlessly monstrous as this administration has been, this is also one of those moments where MAGA tries to push the boundaries of what it can get away with: in this case, the state-sponsored killing of a U.S. citizen.\n\nAnd everything that has followed is a signal that under Donald Trump if you are the slightest inconvenience to a masked government thug who was going door to door checking papers, he can fumble with his cellphone and shoot you in the face and probably call you a bitch. And in your memory, whether you’re an immigrant or a minority or a Democrat or a 37-year-old poet mom, the state will tell its adherents that you deserved to die.","summary":"As America is broken apart the cracks are everywhere, but the killing of Renee Macklin Good seems like a chasm, Bruce Arthur writes.","url":"https://www.thestar.com/politics/political-opinion/the-ice-shooting-in-minneapolis-is-a-warning-to-all-americans/article_e31fd49d-66e8-445e-b69d-01456d6beee0.html","image":"https://bloximages.chicago2.vip.townnews.com/thestar.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/8/46/8467fcdc-f47f-57b3-aedb-98f3968a691e/696197b06c7d5.image.jpg?crop=1763%2C926%2C0%2C125&resize=1200%2C630&order=crop%2Cresize","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-09 23:30:00","author":"Bruce Arthur","authors":["Bruce Arthur"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"ca","sentiment":-0.292},{"id":392171810,"title":"Under court order, Trump administration to fund beleaguered consumer financial watchdog","text":"WASHINGTON, Jan 9 (Reuters) - Citing a court order, the Trump administration said on Friday it will fund the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau with $145 million, a reversal that ends an 11-month battle that pushed the consumer watchdog toward insolvency. President Donald Trump's budget director, Russell Vought, has requested funding from the Federal Reserve, according to a letter filed in federal court on Friday. The move came a month after a federal judge rejected the administration's argument that it was legally barred from drawing funds from the central bank, which supplies the agency's budget. A spokesperson for the Fed declined to comment. CFPB representatives did not immediately respond to a request for comment. In the past, the Fed has always supplied the requested funding. The Trump administration this year has alternated between moving to shut the CFPB down entirely and reducing it to a fraction of its former size. Top officials have accused it of politicized enforcement and burdening free enterprise, charges the agency's supporters and staff reject. The about-face marks another setback for the administration's efforts to dismantle the CFPB following an appeals court decision last month that threw out an earlier decision that would have allowed agency leadership to proceed with mass firings. The funding will come as a lifeline to an agency that had been perhaps mere weeks away from insolvency. The agency had informed a judge last year that it could not guarantee sufficient funding to meet its expenses after December 31. In Friday's letter to Fed Chair Jerome Powell, Russell Vought, who serves both as the head of the Office of Management and Budget and the acting CFPB director, said that although he disagreed with the court's order, the $145 million would be sufficient to carry out the CFPB's functions from January to March. The amount requested is in line with the CFPB's average quarterly funding draw over the past decade but comes after nearly a year in which the agency had drawn down its available finances. The agency, however, is facing lower costs due to the suspension of most activities and an exodus of workers.

The year 2026 has opened with a surprise attack by U.S. President Donald Trump. On the first weekend of the new year, the United States launched an assault on Venezuela, captured President Nicolas Maduro, and transported him to New York. This extraordinary development undermines the rule of law and accelerates the collapse of the international order -- actions by a country that was supposed to be the leader of democracy.\n\nThe U.S. strike shattered the celebratory New Year's mood, and newsrooms around the world are now operating at full throttle. At Nikkei Asia, we are focusing on how this incident in distant South America will impact Asia.\n\nNow that the Trump administration has declared its operation in Venezuela a success, it has openly stated its intention to \"run\" the country, which holds the world's largest oil reserves. U.S. officials have repeatedly suggested that American companies will develop Venezuela's oil and secure its resources.\n\nThese moves will affect China. Over the past years, U.S. sanctions have drastically reduced Venezuela's crude exports to the United States, while shipments to China have surged. Last year, Venezuelan oil accounted for around 4% of China's total crude imports.\n\nAsia's stance toward the U.S. action is split. Unsurprisingly, Beijing has fiercely criticized Washington's attack on Venezuela as a violation of international law. Meanwhile, Japan, a U.S. ally, has responded with ambiguity. Tokyo stressed the importance of principles such as democracy and the rule of law, but limited its statement to a pledge to continue diplomatic efforts to restore democracy in Venezuela.\n\nBy justifying an assault that strips another nation of sovereignty, the United States has made global geopolitics even more uncertain. If military intervention is permissible solely to protect national interests, then Russia's invasion of Ukraine could also be legitimized. Tensions in the South China Sea and the Taiwan Strait are likely to rise further. At Nikkei Asia, we will continue reporting on the Venezuela issue from an Asian perspective, so please stay tuned.\n\nMy suggested reads\n\n1. What does 2026 have in store for Asia? Nikkei Asia readers once again have offered their opinions on the likely economic, political and other developments in the year ahead. Surprisingly, they are most enthusiastic about the prospects for new Japanese Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi as well as Vietnam's economy.\n\n2. Hong Kong became the top destination for initial public offerings last year in Asia and No. 2 in the world, as asset managers and hedge funds turned increasingly visible in new listings, participating as cornerstone investors. Will the trend continue into 2026? Likely, says our reporter in the city, but questions on weaker credentials remain.\n\n3. While less remembered today than China's one-child policy, other Asian nations including Indonesia, India and Vietnam spent decades pushing their citizens to limit themselves to two children using a mix of carrots and sticks. Now, as with China, the worry is that things went too far, but reversing the messaging isn't so easy, as our latest Policy Asia explores.\n\nWishing you a wonderful weekend!\n\nAkito Tanaka\n\nFollow us on Threads and Instagram\n\nSign up for the weekly Editor-in-chief's picks newsletter here","url":"https://asia.nikkei.com/editor-s-picks/editor-in-chief-s-picks/editor-s-choice-trump-s-venezuela-assault-upends-global-norms-splits-asia","image":"https://images.ft.com/v3/image/raw/https%3A%2F%2Fcms-image-bucket-productionv3-ap-northeast-1-a7d2.s3.ap-northeast-1.amazonaws.com%2Fimages%2F4%2F5%2F3%2F6%2F11976354-1-eng-GB%2Fc56fa3281da8-cccc.jpg?width=1200&fit=cover&gravity=faces&dpr=2&quality=medium","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-09 23:17:03","author":"Akito Tanaka","authors":["Akito Tanaka"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"jp","sentiment":0.167},{"id":392150032,"title":"U.S. Treasury Secretary pushes for Minnesota fraud crackdown","text":"U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent announced the creation of a new IRS task force and other measures to combat fraud, underscoring the Trump administration's focus on Minnesota amidst the immigration crackdown.\"Minnesota is going to be the protocols, procedures and investigative techniques and collaboration.

National Park Service Warns That Passes With Stickers Over Donald Trump’s Face Will Be Void","text":"When pondering a new National Park Service “America the Beautiful” annual pass one would be forgiven for expecting images of the beautiful National Parks on the passes, but not this year.\n\nEveryone in America knows that the country’s versatile and beautiful national parks are something to brag about. The range of scenes of nature vary from red rocks to wild waves, lush mountains and beautiful wildlife. However, this year there has been a change in the NPS annual passes, where no beautiful scenes are revealed, only an image of US President Donald Trump’s face.\n\nLovers of the national parks have already taken note of the new annual passes, with many placing a sticker with a natural scene over the image of Trump’s face. Now, to keep the president happy, the National Park Service has updated its policy to discourage visitors from “defacing” a picture of Trump on the latest annual pass.\n\nHowever, not only have park lovers reacted by covering his face with a sticker, there are now sticker protests being held, and even a lawsuit from a conservation group.\n\nThe new $80 annual America the Beautiful pass offers visitors access to more than 2,000 federal recreation sites. While since 2004, the passes have typically showcased beautiful landscapes and iconic wildlife, selected through a public photo contest, this year is different. Previously, past winners have featured beautiful images on the passes of bison roaming the plains, or shots of the Grand Canyon, or Arches National Park.\n\nThis year, there are no beautiful images of nature, just side-by-side portraits of Presidents George Washington and Donald Trump. As the passes were released, they have quickly attracted criticism from park goers, leading to a wave of “do-it-yourself” resistance.\n\nPhotos have been shared on social media revealing that national park cardholders have quickly covered the image of Trump’s face with more appropriate stickers of landscapes, wildlife and yellow smiling emojis. Some have even completely blocked out the face of the whole card, and the backlash has inspired a growing sticker editing campaign.\n\nHowever, it isn’t just about blocking out Trump’s mugshot, and is more about doing good. As noted by NPR, Jenny McCarty, a longtime park volunteer and graphic designer started selling beautiful custom stickers, sized to directly cover 47’s face, while 100 percent of proceeds go to conservation nonprofits. “We made our first donation of $16,000 in December,” McCarty said. “The power of community is incredible.”\n\nMcCarty does stress that the sticker movement is less about politics and more about the neutrality of public lands, where everyone is welcome.\n\n“The Interior’s new guidance only shows they continue to disregard how strongly people feel about keeping politics out of national parks,” she said.\n\nAfter noting the changes to people’s annual passes, the National Park Service had to update its card policy this week to warn people that passes that have been “defaced or altered” may no longer be valid. This comes at a time when the sticker movement has grown across social media, not only doing good, but making life more beautiful.\n\nAdmittedly, the National Park Service has long said that passes can be voided if the signature strip is altered, but now the guidance has been amended to specifically include stickers or markings on the face if the card.\n\nReportedly, it is will be up to the discretion of park service officials to determine whether a pass has been “defaced” or not. Meanwhile, a further update says park officials now have leeway to reject an annual pass if a sticker leaves glue residence behind.\n\nThe Center for Biological Diversity, a conservation group, filed a lawsuit in Washington, DC, opposing the new pass design. The group points out that the image of Trump violates a federal requirement that the annual America the Beautiful pass display a winning photo from a national parks photo contest. For 2026, the winning photo was of Glacier National Park, but it never made it to the passes.","summary":"US National Park Service has released its new 'America the Beautiful' annual pass for 2026, but is it beautiful?","url":"https://www.inquisitr.com/national-park-service-warns-passes-with-stickers-void","image":"https://www.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/national-park.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-09 23:13:35","author":"Anne Sewell","authors":["Anne Sewell"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.31},{"id":392139210,"title":"US senate moves to block Trump’s military action in Venezuela as oversight dispute deepens","text":"The United States Senate has voted to advance a resolution aimed at restricting President Donald Trump from taking further military action in Venezuela without explicit congressional approval, marking a rare bipartisan pushback against the White House.\n\nThe chamber voted 52–47 on Thursday to move the war powers resolution forward, with a small group of Republicans joining Democrats to support the measure.

In two separate lawsuits, New York Attorney General Letitia James is asking a federal court in Washington to block U.S. President Donald Trump's December 22 freeze on federal offshore leases held by Norway's Equinor and Denmark's Orsted. The Interior Department has said it paused the projects due to complaints by the Pentagon that wind turbines cause radar interference that can make it hard to identify security threats. \"New Yorkers deserve clean, reliable energy, good-paying jobs, and a government that follows the law,\" James said in a statement. \"These projects were carefully reviewed and already under construction when the federal government pulled the plug without explanation. This reckless decision puts workers, families, and our climate goals at risk, and my office is taking action to stop it.\" James, an elected Democrat, is one of the Republican president's top political antagonists. Equinor and Orsted have faced repeated setbacks to their offshore wind developments under Trump, who has said wind turbines are ugly, costly and inefficient. Both offshore wind developers have filed their own lawsuits against Interior on behalf of their multibillion-dollar New York projects, Empire Wind and Sunrise Wind. Equinor's Empire Wind has warned in court papers that it faces likely termination if it cannot restart construction by January 16 and has asked a federal judge in Washington for a preliminary injunction. A hearing on that request will take place next week. Orsted has sued on behalf of Sunrise Wind and another project, Revolution Wind, which is being built off the coast of Rhode Island. The company in September succeeded in getting a federal judge to block a separate Trump administration stop-work order on Revolution Wind. The Interior Department's pause on offshore wind leases also affects Avangrid's Vineyard Wind project off the coast of Massachusetts and Dominion Energy's Coastal Virginia Offshore Wind facility.

This apprehension stems from a major statement made by Trump regarding the nuclear treaty between the US and Russia.\n\nIn an interview with a newspaper, Trump said, \"I don't care if the START treaty between the US and Russia is expiring. I think we and Russia can reach a better agreement, but this new proposed treaty will have to include countries like China so that the limits of nuclear power can be set for the entire world.\" By using such words, Trump has indicated that he is not serious about the nuclear agreement with Russia and that he may want to completely terminate the treaty.\n\nWhat is START treaty?\n\nIn 1991, the US and Russia signed the START treaty. Under this treaty, both countries agreed not to build new nuclear weapons. The treaty was extended in 2009 and 2021. Now, the current START treaty between the two countries is set to expire on February 5.\n\nDuring a meeting with Trump in Alaska, Putin proposed extending the treaty, but the way Trump mentioned China in relation to the treaty suggests that he does not want to extend the current agreement. The nuclear treaty is just one point. Tensions between Putin and Trump have been steadily increasing for the past three months.\n\nIn October 2025, the Trump administration authorised Ukraine to attack Russian oil and energy resources. On January 7, 2026, the US Navy seized a Russian cargo ship. On January 8, Trump announced that a 500 per cent tariff would be imposed on countries buying oil from Russia. That same night, Putin rejected the US-proposed ceasefire in Ukraine, and on January 9, Putin announced that if European countries send peacekeeping forces to Ukraine, those peacekeepers would also become targets for Russia.\n\nThe continuous actions and rhetoric from both sides indicate that neither Trump nor Putin is in the mood to back down. Regarding such confrontations between major powers, former US Secretary of State Henry Kissinger made a significant observation.\n\nKissinger used to say that nuclear-armed nations are essentially like blind men. Such countries do not see morality or logic; instead, if they are brought into conflict with each other, the result is nothing but destruction. Similar circumstances seem to be developing between the US and Russia. Trump's ego and Putin's hardline stance have brought the two superpowers face-to-face.\n\nRussia and the US together possess more than 1,100 nuclear weapons. If these weapons are unleashed against each other, it would trigger a nuclear winter – a period of unimaginable pain and devastation. In a nuclear winter, the smoke and soot from the atomic explosions would cover the upper layers of the Earth's atmosphere, preventing sunlight from reaching 70 per cent of the planet's surface.\n\nThis layer of soot and smoke would persist for approximately 10 years. Due to the prolonged lack of sunlight, the Earth's average temperature would drop by 15 to 20 degrees Celsius, leading to a rapid increase in cold. The altered weather patterns would disrupt the rainfall cycle, destroying approximately 55 per cent of the world's agriculture. In short, a nuclear winter would bring not only destruction but also widespread famine. This is why the world wants Trump and Putin to soften their stance and extend the nuclear treaty so that the threat of nuclear war looming over the world can be eliminated.","url":"https://www.dnaindia.com/analysis/report-dna-tv-show-will-us-president-donald-trump-break-the-nuclear-agreement-with-vladimir-putin-russia-start-treaty-3196521","image":"https://cdn.dnaindia.com/sites/default/files/styles/full/public/2026/01/09/2737768-dna-32.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-09 23:02:00","author":"Pm Ist","authors":["Pm Ist"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"in","sentiment":-0.225},{"id":392147040,"title":"'Uninvestable': Big Oil skeptical of Trump's Venezuela push without big changes","text":"WASHINGTON ― Some of America's top oil executives told President Donald Trump their companies aren't ready to invest in oil operations in Venezuela unless major changes are made to ensure the viability of the ventures.\n\nThe oil industry pointed to challenges with Trump's Venezuela oil plan as the president met with executives from 17 oil companies on Jan. 9, nearly one week after the United States military captured the country's president, Nicolás Maduro.\n\n\"We first got into Venezuela in the 1940s. We've had our assets seized twice,\" ExxonMobil CEO Darren Woods said. \"So you can imagine, to re-enter a third time would require some pretty significant changes from what we've seen historically here and what is currently the state.\"\n\nMore: Trump meets with oil execs after Venezuela attack. Here's why.\n\nTrump has said the United States will take control of between 30 billion and 50 billion barrels of Venezuela oil and is working to convince American oil companies to spend billions to upgrade aging oil infrastructure to increase the country's energy output. He has said the companies will more than earn their money back through profits, with oil sold to both Americans and Venezuelans.\n\nBut Woods said existing legal and commercial challenges make the country's oil \"uninvestable\" unless changes are made for legal, financial and security guarantees. \"There has to be durable investment protections and there has to be a change to the hydrocarbon laws in the country.\"\n\nMore: Trump says Venezuela will give up to 50 million barrels of oil to US\n\nIf the Trump administration is able to address those needs, ExxonMobil can \"hit the ground\" quickly, Woods said. He said the company plans to assemble a technical team to assess the state of the oil industry in Venezuela. \"We haven't been in the country in almost 20 years,\" he said.\n\nTrump said he hopes to strike a deal with the oil companies that would include security guarantees to keep the companies \"physically safe, in addition to financially safe.\"\n\n“I have an idea what I want, what I think we should have,” Trump said of a potential deal. \"We have to get them to invest, and then we have to get their money back as quickly as we can. And then we can divvy it all up between Venezuela, the United States and them. I think it’s simple. I think the formula is simple. We start with a brand-new plate.\"\n\nVice President JD Vance, Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Energy Secretary Chris Wright and Interior Secretary Doug Burgum joined Trump and the oil executives at the meeting.\n\nMore: Trump reveals how long he expects US to control Venezuelan oil\n\n\"Certainly it excites me as an explorationist,\" Harold Hamm, chairman and CEO of Continental Resources, told Trump of the possibility of investing in Venezuelan oil. \"Everybody has that in their blood. It is a very exciting country, and a lot of reserves. It's got its challenges, and the industry knows how to handle that.\"\n\n\"As Darren said,\" Hamm added, referring to the ExxonMobil CEO, \"you go in with your eyes open and do the best you can with the team you got.\"\n\nThe most bullish oil company about the opportunities in Venezuela was Chevron, the only U.S. company currently operating in Venezuela, with 3,000 employees in the country.\n\nMark Nelson, vice chairman of Chevron, said the company's oil production in Venezuela over the past five to seven years has increased 40,000 barrels a day to 240,000 barrels.\n\n\"I think we have a path forward here very shortly to be able to increase our liftings from those joint ventures 100%, essentially, effective immediately,\" Nelson said.\n\nHe said having Chevron workers already on the ground is a \"definite advantage.\"\n\nRyan Lance, chairman and CEO of ConocoPhillips, said talks need to take place with banks to restructure debt for oil companies that invest billions into energy infrastructure. He singled out the EXIM Bank, the official export creditor of the federal government.\n\n\"If we can do that, and think bold, there's an opportunity to be quick, fast and restore quality of what's been lost in Venezuela over the course of the last 25 years,\" Reach Joey Garrison on X @joeygarrison.","url":"https://eu.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2026/01/09/big-oil-says-big-changes-needed-for-trumps-venezuela-push-to-work/88105572007/","image":"https://www.gannett-cdn.com/authoring/authoring-images/2026/01/09/USAT/88107972007-2254852561.jpg?auto=webp&crop=8155,4587,x0,y425&format=pjpg&width=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-09 23:01:48","author":"Usa Today","authors":["Usa Today"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.222},{"id":392159614,"title":"Donald Trump says the US has already taken 30 million barrels of oil out of Venezuela and tells firms they are to deal with America as he meets with executives at the White House","text":"Donald Trump said the U.S. has already taken 30 million barrels of oil out of Venezuela as he met with executives from 17 oil firms at the White House on Friday.\n\nThe oil - worth around $4 billion - was taken yesterday, with most of the proceeds set to go to the United States, though some would be allocated to Venezuela, the president said.\n\nTrump told executives that US companies would deal directly with Washington rather than Caracas when exploiting Venezuela's vast oil reserves.\n\n'You're dealing with us directly, you're not dealing with Venezuela at all, we don't want you to deal with Venezuela,' he said.\n\nFollowing the US military raid to capture former Venezuelan leader Nicolas Maduro on Saturday, Trump has cast the intervention as an economic opportunity, with the U.S. seizing tankers carrying Venezuelan oil.\n\nHe said Washington would take control of sales between 30 million and 50 million barrels of previously sanctioned oil and would oversee global sales indefinitely.\n\nOpening the meeting, Trump sought to reassure executives they could invest - and in some cases return - to Venezuela despite its history of state asset seizures, ongoing sanctions, and political instability.\n\n'You have total safety,' Trump told the group. 'You're dealing with us directly and not dealing with Venezuela at all. We don't want you to deal with Venezuela.'\n\nTrump added: 'Our giant oil companies will be spending at least 100 billion dollars of their money, not the government's money.\n\n'They don't need government money. But they need government protection.'\n\nTrump welcomed the oil executives to the White House after US forces earlier on Friday seized their fifth tanker over the past month that has been linked to Venezuelan oil.\n\nThe action reflected the determination of the US to fully control the exporting, refining and production of Venezuelan petroleum, a sign of the Trump administration's plans for ongoing involvement in the sector as it seeks commitments from private companies.\n\nIt is all part of a broader push by Trump to keep gasoline prices low.\n\nAt a time when many Americans are concerned about affordability, the incursion in Venezuela melds Trump's assertive use of presidential powers with an optical spectacle meant to convince Americans that he can bring down energy prices.\n\n'At least 100 Billion Dollars will be invested by BIG OIL, all of whom I will be meeting with today at The White House,' Trump said on Friday in a pre-dawn social media post.\n\nThe White House said it invited oil executives from 17 companies, including Chevron, which still operates in Venezuela, as well as ExxonMobil and ConocoPhillips, which both had oil projects in the country that were lost as part of a 2007 nationalisation of private businesses under Maduro's predecessor, Hugo Chavez.\n\n'If we look at the commercial constructs and frameworks in place today in Venezuela, today it's un-investable,' said Darren Woods, the ExxonMobil chief executive.\n\n'And so significant changes have to be made to those commercial frameworks, the legal system, there has to be durable investment protections and there has to be change to the hydrocarbon laws in the country.'\n\nOther companies invited included Halliburton, Valero, Marathon, Shell, Singapore-based Trafigura, Italy-based Eni and Spain-based Repsol as well as a vast swathe of domestic and international companies with interests ranging from construction to the commodity markets.\n\nLarge US oil companies have so far largely refrained from affirming investments in Venezuela as contracts and guarantees need to be in place.\n\nTrump has suggested that the Us would help to backstop any investments.\n\nVenezuela's oil production has slumped below one million barrels a day.\n\nPart of Trump's challenge to turn that around will be to convince oil companies that his administration has a stable relationship with Venezuela's interim President Delcy Rodriguez, as well as protections for companies entering the market.\n\nWhile Rodriguez has publicly denounced Trump and the ouster of Maduro, the US president has said that to date Venezuela's interim leader has been co-operating behind the scenes with his administration.\n\nTyson Slocum, director of the consumer advocacy group Public Citizen's energy programme, criticised the gathering and called the US military's removal of Maduro 'violent imperialism'.\n\nSlocum added that Trump's goal appears to be to 'hand billionaires control over Venezuela's oil'.\n\nMeanwhile, the US and Venezuelan governments said on Friday they were exploring the possibility of restoring diplomatic relations between the two countries, and a delegation from the Trump administration arrived in the South American nation on Friday.\n\nThe small team of US diplomats and diplomatic security officials travelled to Venezuela to make a preliminary assessment about the potential reopening of the US embassy in Caracas, the state department said in a statement.\n\nTrump also announced on Friday he would meet with President Gustavo Petro in early February, but called on the Colombian leader to make quick progress on stemming flow of cocaine into the US.\n\nTrump, following the ouster of Maduro, had made vague threats to take similar action against Petro, describing the Colombia leader as a 'sick man who likes making cocaine and selling it to the United States'.\n\nBut Trump abruptly changed his tone on Wednesday about his Colombian counterpart after a friendly phone call in which he invited Petro to visit the White House.\n\nThe seeming detente between Petro, a leftist, and Trump, a conservative, appears to reflect that their shared interests override their deep differences.\n\nFor Colombia, the US remains key to the military's fight against leftist guerrillas and drug traffickers.\n\nWashington has provided Bogota with roughly 14 billion dollars in the last two decades.\n\nFor the US, Colombia, the world's biggest cocaine producer, remains the cornerstone of its counternarcotics strategy abroad, providing crucial intelligence used to interdict drugs in the Caribbean.","summary":"The oil -

Major stock indexes jumped to record highs and the dollar was also up on Friday after data showed the U.S. economy created fewer jobs than expected in December, which did little to change rate cut expectations from the Federal Reserve this year. The S&P 500, Dow and the STOXX 600 notched record high closes. Chip stocks rose and helped to boost the S&P 500, with Intel gaining 10.8% after U.S. President Donald Trump said he had a \"great meeting\" with the chipmaker's Chief Executive Officer, Lip-Bu Tan. Broadcom rose 3.8%. The Bureau of Labor Statistics monthly report showed 50,000 workers were added to nonfarm payrolls in December, compared with expectations in a Reuters poll for a rise of 60,000, just above November's downwardly revised increase of 56,000. The unemployment rate eased, as expected, to 4.4%. \"Payrolls were a little bit light relative to consensus, but still fairly strong numbers,\" said Tim Ghriskey, senior portfolio strategist at Ingalls & Snyder in New York. \"We are back to normal in terms of economic reporting, so that's a bit of a relief for everyone.\" Before now, the release of U.S. economic data had been delayed because of the long federal government shutdown. Stock market gains this week came despite increased geopolitical tensions sparked by U.S. forces capturing Venezuelan leader Nicolas Maduro in a raid on its capital January 3. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 237.96 points, or 0.48%, to 49,504.07, the S&P 500 rose 44.82 points, or 0.65%, to 6,966.28 and the Nasdaq Composite rose 191.33 points, or 0.82%, to 23,671.35. All three indexes posted gains in the first full trading week of 2026, driven by increases in materials, industrials and other sectors that have lagged technology stocks in recent years. MSCI's gauge of stocks across the globe was up 5.42 points, or 0.53%, at 1,034.87, and hit a record intraday high. European shares ended at a record high. A jump in Glencore helped put the STOXX 600 on its longest weekly winning streak since May. The pan-European STOXX 600 index rose 0.97%. DOLLAR, TWO-YEAR YIELDS UP After the jobs report the dollar initially gave up almost all the day's gains versus a basket of major currencies, having risen by nearly 0.2% earlier. The dollar index, which measures the greenback against a basket of currencies including the yen and the euro, was last up 0.26% at 99.13. Interest rate sensitive two-year Treasury yields were higher after the data, while 10-year yields were last down slightly. The 2-year note yield, which typically moves in step with interest rate expectations for the Fed, rose 5 basis points to 3.538%, from 3.488% late on Thursday. The yield on benchmark U.S. 10-year notes fell 1.2 basis points to 4.171%. In commodities, crude oil ended sharply higher. Brent futures rose $1.35, or 2.18%, to settle at $63.34 per barrel, while U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude gained $1.36, or 2.35%, to $59.12. Investors have become more convinced that production in Venezuela, even under U.S. control, may not rise meaningfully for some time. Copper prices rose, extending recent gains on renewed bets on a future demand boost, while aluminium hit its highest since April 2022. TRUMP'S TARIFFS Investors had been bracing for a possible U.S. Supreme Court ruling on the legality of Trump's tariffs. But the court is expected to issue its next rulings on Jan. 14. The court indicated on its website on Friday that it could release decisions in argued cases when the justices take the bench during a scheduled sitting next Wednesday.

Trump didn’t say who gave him the pin.\n\n“Considering the fact that I’m never happy, I’m never satisfied,” the president continued, holding out his lapel and looking down at the pin, then looking back at reporters with a playful smirk. “I will never be satisfied until we make America great again, but we’re getting pretty close, I tell you what. This is called a Happy Trump.”\n\nTrump wore a pin with the same design at least once before, during a ceremony in February to swear in Tulsi Gabbard as his Director of National Intelligence — though he didn’t comment on it then.\n\nOnline searching revealed a Trump lapel pin featuring what appears to be the same design — bundled together with a pin imposing an American flag over an outline of a U.S. map — available for sale on Amazon for $9.99.\n\nSince the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks, U.S. presidents have generally worn an American flag pin on their lapels. Former President Joe Biden occasionally added his own flourish, sometimes wearing a pin featuring an American flag crossed with a Ukraine one to show his support for that country in its war with Russia.\n\nThen-Sen. Barack Obama was criticized while first running for president in 2007 when he said he’d no longer wear a flag pin because he said doing so had become a substitute for “true patriotism.” But Obama resumed the practice the following year, when a veteran handed him one at a Pennsylvania town hall, prompting the candidate to immediately don it to cheers from attendees.\n\nFriday’s was not the first Trump likeness to pop up on a lapel pin in Washington.\n\nIn April, Brendan Carr, the Trump-appointed chair of the Federal Commissions Commission, wore a small gold medallion fashioned in the shape of Trump’s profile as a lapel pin. It could be seen in Carr’s post on X about a meeting on Capitol Hill with Georgia Rep. Buddy Carter.","summary":"WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump insists he's never happy.

The Supreme Court did not issue an expected ruling on Friday on the legality of President Donald Trump’s tariffs, contributing to Bitcoin’s stasis alongside exchange-traded fund inflows and geopolitical uncertainty, according to Jake Ostrovskis, head of over-the-counter trading at Wintermute.“We’re seeing classic post-rally consolidation after Bitcoin’s strong start to 2026,” Ostrovskis said.Stronger-than-expected economic data also weighed on expectations for additional interest-rate cuts, limiting Bitcoin’s momentum toward its all-time high above $126,000 in October.“Macroeconomic data have generally come in stronger than expected, modestly reducing the probability of a March rate cut and likely adding further near-term pressure on prices,” said James Butterfill, head of research at CoinShares.Some market participants view the price stagnation as constructive.“Bitcoin is consolidating around $90,000 after a prolonged selloff tied to tax-loss harvesting and fears MSCI would exclude digital-asset treasury companies from major indices,” said Brian Vieten, a senior research analyst covering digital assets and blockchain at Siebert Financial. “With that risk now resolved, selling pressure has largely been exhausted.”Index provider MSCI shelved a plan this week to remove digital-asset treasuries on the grounds that they behave like investment funds.Some traders remain bullish on Bitcoin’s longer-term prospects. Butterfill said a price of about $200,000 is achievable by year-end. Ostrovskis said systemic buying would be unlocked again once Bitcoin breaks through the $95,000 psychological barrier, reopening a path to six-figure prices. “A sustained break above $95,000 likely becomes reflexive,” Ostrovskis said.More stories like this are available on bloomberg.com©2026 Bloomberg L.P.","url":"https://www.livemint.com/market/bitcoin-stalls-at-90-000-as-markets-await-fed-tariff-news-11767999089194.html","image":"https://www.livemint.com/lm-img/img/2024/12/06/1600x900/logo/market1_1733465997762_1733466008348.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-09 22:51:28","author":"List.metadata.agency","authors":["List.metadata.agency"],"language":"en","category":"business","source_country":"in","sentiment":-0.01},{"id":392123974,"title":"New video emerges of Minnesota shooting, further inflaming tensions","text":"The White House on Friday reposted on social media a new video taken from the cellphone of the Immigration officer who fatally shot a Minnesota woman in her car this week, adding to the documentation of an incident that has sparked days of nationwide protests.\n\nThe 47-second video shows 37-year-old Renee Good telling the officer, “That’s fine, dude, I’m not mad at you,” moments before he opens fire after Good puts the car in gear in an apparent effort to pull back into the street.\n\nThe new clip is likely to further inflame tensions between state officials and officials in U.S. President Donald Trump‘s administration, who have offered starkly different accounts of the shooting. Minnesota authorities on Friday said they were opening their own criminal investigation, after some state leaders said the FBI was refusing to cooperate with state investigators.\n\nThe video, obtained by the website Alpha News and verified by Reuters, begins as the Immigration and Customs Enforcement officer, Jonathan Ross, exits his car and approaches Good’s Honda SUV, which is partially blocking traffic. A black dog is visible through an open rear window.\n\nAs he circles around the front of the car, Good reverses farther out of the street before speaking to him through her open window. Ross then continues around the vehicle’s rear, where he films the vehicle’s license plate and encounters Good’s wife, Becca Good, in the street. She tells him, “We don’t change our plates every morning, just so you know. It’ll be the same plate when you come talk to us later. That’s fine. U.S. citizen.”\n\nBecca Good, who was filming the ICE agent with her own phone, then adds: “You want to come at us? I say go get yourself some lunch, big boy.”\n\nAt that point, another ICE agent approaches Renee Good in the vehicle and orders her to get out of the car. She can be seen reversing briefly, then putting the car into gear and turning the steering wheel, apparently trying to drive away.\n\nAs the car moves forward, Ross shouts “Whoa!” Shots can be heard, and the car briefly disappears from the frame of the video as the officer’s hand holding the phone appears to flail about.\n\nThe video then shows the car careening down the street, while someone can be heard muttering, “f------ bitch.”\n\nU.S. Vice-President JD Vance, who has accused Good of deliberately using her car as a weapon, reposted the video, saying it showed the officer’s life was endangered.\n\nOther videos of the shooting show Good turning her wheels away from Ross as she drives forward, while he fires three shots while jumping backward from the front of the car. The final two shots appear to be aimed through the driver’s side window, after the car’s front bumper has already passed by the officer’s legs.\n\nIt is unclear whether Ross made any contact with the car, but videos show he stayed on his feet and walked calmly toward the car after the shooting.\n\nOfficials from the Republican Trump administration have defended the shooting as self-defence and accused Good of an act of “domestic terrorism” - a narrative described by Democratic Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey as “garbage” based on the video footage.\n\nGood was a mother of three, including a 6-year-old son. Becca Good issued a statement to Minnesota Public Radio on Friday, saying the two had “stopped to support our neighbors.”\n\n“We had whistles,” she wrote. “They had guns.”\n\nShe also described her late wife as someone who had “sparkles coming out of her pores.”\n\n“Renee lived by an overarching belief: there is kindness in the world and we need to do everything we can to find it where it resides and nurture it where it needs to grow,” she said. “Renee was a Christian who knew that all religions teach the same essential truth: we are here to love each other, care for each other, and keep each other safe and whole.”\n\nSeparate investigations\n\nMary Moriarty, the top prosecutor for Minneapolis’ Hennepin County, and the state’s Democratic attorney general, Keith Ellison, said on Friday they were opening their own probe into the shooting.\n\nThe announcement came one day after the state’s lead investigative agency, the Bureau of Criminal Apprehension, said the FBI had reversed its initial cooperation and blocked the BCA from scene evidence, witness interviews and other material.\n\nThe decision could set up separate, parallel probes into the shooting.\n\nU.S. officials, including Vance, have dismissed the idea that a federal officer could face state criminal charges. But Moriarty said the decision was hers to make.\n\n“To be sure, there are complex legal issues involved when a federal law enforcement officer is involved. But the law is clear: we do have jurisdiction to make this decision,” she said.\n\nThe announcement underscored how the Trump administration’s immigration crackdown in Democratic-run cities has frayed the trust between local and federal officials.\n\nEarlier in the day, Frey accused the Trump administration of trying to predetermine the investigation’s outcome by cutting out state authorities.\n\n“This is a time to follow the law,” Frey said. “This is not a time to hide from the facts.”\n\nIn Portland, Ore., on Thursday afternoon, a U.S. Border Patrol agent shot and wounded a man and woman in their car after an attempted vehicle stop. As in Minnesota, the Department of Homeland Security said the driver “weaponized” the car in an effort to run over the agent, who fired in self-defence.\n\nPortland Mayor Keith Wilson, echoing Frey, said he could not be sure the government’s account was grounded in fact without an independent investigation.\n\nThe two shootings have drawn thousands of protesters in Minneapolis, Portland and other U.S. cities, with more demonstrations expected over the weekend.\n\nIn both cases, Democratic mayors and governors have called on the Trump administration to pull federal officers out, arguing that their presence is sowing chaos and needlessly creating tensions on the streets.\n\nWhile the operation is part of Trump’s broader immigration crackdown, the president has for months aimed political attacks at the state, particularly its large Somali-American community.","url":"https://www.ctvnews.ca/world/article/new-video-emerges-of-minnesota-shooting-further-inflaming-tensions/","image":"https://www.ctvnews.ca/resizer/v2/QHY3SAHPZNBG5FPBIYZIEUPSUY.jpeg?auth=13a972fe55197e50d6c1af280f2e050d1599ed434a10f87018535eb9a3bdbe35","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-09 22:50:38","author":null,"language":"en","source_country":"ca","sentiment":-0.452},{"id":392128272,"title":"Trump: We're not going to allow Russia and China to occupy Greenland","text":"to top close Video This video is playing in picture-in-picture.\n\nPrimary World January 09, 2026 02:39 \n\n Trump: We're not going to allow Russia and China to occupy Greenland \n President Donald Trump discusses his maneuvering on Greenland while taking reporter questions at the White House.\n Tags WORLDPERSONALITIESDONALD TRUMPSHOWSWHAT TO WATCH | VIDEOSLATEST NEWS | VIDEOSON AIR","summary":"President Donald Trump discusses his maneuvering on Greenland while taking reporter questions at the White House.","url":"https://www.foxnews.com/video/6387493880112","image":"https://a57.foxnews.com/cf-images.us-east-1.prod.boltdns.net/v1/static/694940094001/9ca98c94-3b71-41bd-83ba-ffd5e954879d/478d6b54-6bb3-4938-98d2-06bf0c6a2082/1280x720/match/1024/512/image.jpg?ve=1&tl=1","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-09 22:46:47","author":null,"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.043},{"id":392159644,"title":"Pupil 'fired fake gun in playground' while teachers were striking at primary school over 'assaults and violence'","text":"Home and Garden\n\nBlack Friday\n\nLatest Headlines\n\nUniversity Guide\n\nThe Crime Desk\n\nPrivacy Policy\n\nSaturday, Jan 10th 2026\n\n5-Day Forecast\n\nAdvertisement\n\nStunning new footage shot by ICE agent who killed Renee Nicole Good shows what REALLY happened\n\nNigel Farage vows to fight Labour's Brexit reset 'all the way', as he fires the starting gun on Reform's election campaign in London\n\nThousands of Brits prescribed super-strength CANNABIS for mental health conditions including anxiety and depression - with benefits claimants offered free consultations and discounts on their monthly weed prescription\n\n'How could they do this to her?': Bloodbath behind the scenes at ITV as insiders reveal how Kate Garraway has been 'humiliated', truth about Susanna Reid's hair - and why 'furious' Lorraine Kelly could 'walk'\n\nLIZ JONES: Kate's recovery is so moving.

Email: edward.holt@dailymail.co.uk \nBy ED HOLT \n Published:21:32 GMT, 9 January 2026 |Updated:22:45 GMT, 9 January 2026 \n\nA pupil 'fired a fake gun' at a primary school on the same day teachers striked complaining that violent children brought knives into the classroom and assaulted staff.\nStaff at Ravensfield Primary School in Greater Manchester staged a walkout on Tuesday January 6 and Wednesday January 7. \nIn a letter sent out to parents, seen by the Daily Mail, they were informed that on the second day of strike action a child caused a panic in the playground when they 'discharged an imitation firearm while under the supervision of their mother'.\nAlthough the school reassured parents that no one was injured or threatened by the fake weapon, staff said they are working closely with Greater Manchester Police to 'ensure the appropriate measures are taken'. \nThe harrowing ordeal is just the latest instance of violence, which included claims that children had physically assaulted staff and brought knives into the school.\nOne parent, who wished to remain anonymous, said that the persistent bad behaviour had become such a cause for concern that parents are taking their children out of the school.\nAlongside staff at Lily Lane Primary School - in the Moston area of Manchester - workers from Ravensfield Primary School staged a walkout this week over their working conditions. \nStaff at both schools say they have been physically attacked and some pupils are too scared to attend class. \n\nIn a letter sent out to parents, seen by The Daily Mail, they were informed that on the second day of strike action a child caused a panic in the playground when they 'discharged an imitation firearm while under the supervision of their mother'\n\nStaff at Ravensfield Primary School (pictured) in Greater Manchester staged a walkout on Tuesday January 6 and Wednesday January 7\nTeachers also say there have been instances of pupils being hit, kicked and even spat at.\nBoth schools are part of the Changing Lives in Collaboration Trust (CLiC) and following the announcement of strike action, the trust said the safety and wellbeing of pupils and staff was its 'highest priority'.\nThe trust said teachers were 'suffering high levels of stress and anxiety which are affecting their entire lives'.\n\n Teachers strike at primary schools after pupils kick and bite staff and bring knives into classrooms \nRachel Knight and Jac Casson, National Executive Members for Greater Manchester, said: 'Working conditions at these CLiC Trust schools are devastating the teachers. They are desperate for change. Alongside their physical injuries, teachers are suffering high levels of stress and anxiety which are affecting their entire lives.\n'All they want is to go to work in a safe environment and to be able to keep their pupils safe.'\nCLiC said it was 'disappointed' to see the walkout 'so soon after the ballot without adequate opportunity to respond to members' concerns'.\nPicket lines at both schools are due to take place at 8.45am on January 7 and 8. Both schools will remain open during industrial action.\nMatt Wrack, General Secretary of NASUWT - The Teachers' Union, said: 'This strike represents an unprecedented event for our union: two primary schools from the same academy trust taking action over worryingly similar concerns. It is fair to say that this strike constitutes a declaration of emergency from the teachers. The health and safety of everyone at these schools is at risk.'\n\nStaff at Lily Lane Primary School (pictured) and Ravensfield Primary School in Manchester claim that teachers have been physically attacked and some pupils are now too afraid to attend\nLeaders at the trust say they are keen to work with NASUWT and respect the right of its members to take action. But added that the union chose not to accept a 'collective conciliation'.\nStrike action at Lily Lane Primary School and Ravensfield Primary School is planned for January 7, 8, 13, 14, 15, 20, 21 and 22. \nJo Ashcroft, CEO of CLiC Trust said: 'The safety and wellbeing of pupils and staff in all our schools is of the very highest priority to us and we work closely with every one of our schools to ensure they maintain the very highest safeguarding standards at all times.\n\n'We also support our schools to ensure the needs of all pupils, including those with special educational needs are fully met.\n'We completely respect the right of union members to take strike action where they believe it to be necessary, however it's disappointing in this case that strike action is taking place so soon after the ballot without adequate opportunity to respond to members' concerns, and despite the Trust having engaged ACAS to offer collective conciliation, which the union chose not to accept. We remain keen to work in partnership with the NASUWT to discuss their members' concerns.\n'In the meantime arrangements are in place for both schools to remain open to all pupils during any strike action that ensues.'\nThe Daily Mail has approached Ravensfield Primary School and Greater Manchester Police for a comment. \nGreater Manchester Police\n\nShare or comment on this article: \nPupil 'fired fake gun in playground' while teachers were striking at primary school over 'assaults and violence'\n\nAdd comment\n\n Share what you think\n\nNo comments have so far been submitted.

They do not prohibit the import, sale or use of any existing drone models the agency previously authorised, nor do they impact any previously bought drones.\nThe White House and Commerce held meetings on ‌the drone proposal through December 19 and met with DJI officials on December 11, according to records posted online.\nDJI told officials that imposing blanket restrictions ‍on drones manufactured in China would be “unnecessary, conceptually flawed, and would be extremely harmful to US stakeholders”.\nThe move comes as Washington has frozen some actions targeting China ahead of US President Donald Trump’s planned meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping in April. A government official briefed on the matter said it appeared the decision to withdraw the drone rule was tied ‌to that ⁠effort.\nNeither the Commerce Department nor DJI immediately responded to requests for comment.\nThe Commerce Department in January 2025 said it was seeking input on potential rules to safeguard the supply chain for drones, saying threats from China and Russia “may offer our adversaries the ability to remotely access and manipulate these devices, exposing sensitive US data”.\n\nCommerce also said in September it was considering similar rules to address concerns about medium- and ‌heavy-duty truck imports after finalising rules in January 2025 under then-President Joe Biden that effectively bar nearly all Chinese cars and trucks from the US market over the same concerns.\nThe commercial truck proposal has not gone to the White House for ‌review.\nChinese imports account for the ‌vast majority of US commercial drone sales. More than half come from DJI, the world’s largest drone manufacturer.\nThe Commerce Department in January 2025 said it was considering restrictions on systems in imported drones like on-board computers, communications and flight control systems, ground control stations, operating software and data storage.\nSome experts said restricting key systems could have led to an effective ban on Chinese drones operating in the United States.","summary":"The US Commerce Department ‍said on Friday it has withdrawn a plan to impose restrictions on Chinese drones to address national security concerns after an earlier crackdown on passenger cars and trucks.\nLast month, the US Federal Communications Commission barred imports of new models of foreign-made drones and critical components including from China’s DJI and Autel on US national security ⁠grounds.\nThe FCC this week said it was exempting some non-Chinese drones from the restrictions.\nThe...","url":"https://www.scmp.com/news/us/diplomacy/article/3339412/us-commerce-department-drops-plan-crack-down-chinese-drones","image":"https://cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2026/01/10/d6a9cbdd-9afe-43fe-beac-cbcfb2a37494_5b5d50c6.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-09 22:45:18","author":"Reuters","authors":["Reuters"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"cn","sentiment":-0.135}]}
