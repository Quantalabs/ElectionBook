Shapiro as VP: poll","text":"A recent survey of 600 likely voters shows former President Donald Trump holds a 2-point lead over Vice President Kamala Harris in Pennsylvania. The results, from North Star Polling Research, come amid swirling rumors that Gov. Josh Shapiro may join Harris on the ticket as her running mate – a choice that could boost her popularity in the commonwealth but cost her in Michigan and Wisconsin. Shapiro, who is Jewish, has denounced Hamas’ Oct. 7 attack on Israeli civilians and pushed university leaders to disband pro-Palestinian protest encampments at colleges across the state. This, analysts say, makes him unappealing to younger voters opposed to Israel’s military campaign in Gaza. “For Harris, she has to run the table on those Rust Belt swing states,” said John McHenry, who conducted the survey. “She can’t lose any of them and win the presidency.” He added that running mate picks don’t generally make or break a presidential ticket. “It’s pretty rare that the individual matters,” he said. “I think it tells more about the presidential nominee’s decision making process.” Trump’s running mate choice JD Vance, McHenry said, likely “matters less than almost any other in recent history.” “It says, ‘I’m ahead and I don’t need to reach so far towards the middle. I’m going to reinforce my base and this is a base pick,’” he said of Trump’s decision. “He’s certainly not going to lose the presidency over JD Vance,” McHenry added. “By the same token, I don’t think Harris is going to win or lose based on who she picks.” Harris already fares better with Pennsylvania voters, with or without Shapiro. McHenry’s polling shows she narrowed Trump’s 9-point lead over President Joe Biden held before he dropped out. Most of that gain came from registered Democrats, though she “has a long way to go” on bringing independents into the fold. Down ballot, however, Trump’s popularity hasn’t swayed support for Republican Senate nominee Dave McCormick, who trails incumbent Democratic Sen. Bob Casey 49%-41%. McHenry said McCormick hasn’t yet appealed to certain parts of Trump’s electorate, including “soft” Republicans and working-class voters. An attack ad his campaign published this week, however, “is exactly the right messaging to make that happen.” In the advertisement, McCormick highlights Harris’ progressive record on criminal justice reform and immigration enforcement. Elsewhere in the survey, more than half of respondents said Biden’s economic policies leave the middle class worse off, while 51% said their financial situation was better during Trump’s presidency. Biden’s debate performance also turned off supporters, with 31% of respondents saying they were more likely to vote for Trump in the aftermath. Trump’s attempted assassination boosted his support slightly, with 21% saying they were “more likely” to vote for him. The survey was conducted from July 20 through July 23 with a 4% margin of error.","summary":"A recent survey of 600 likely voters shows former President Donald Trump holds a 2-point lead over Vice President Kamala Harris in Pennsylvania.","url":"https://nypost.com/2024/07/25/us-news/trump-maintains-lead-in-pennsylvania-as-harris-eyes-gov-shapiro-as-vp-poll/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/07/newspress-collage-i63lyok0v-1721948895201.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&1721934676&w=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/wPb0Y7rU-RyIcpnTz.mp4","publish_date":"2024-07-25 23:50:58","author":"The Center Square","authors":["The Center Square"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.048},{"id":252644570,"title":"'Apples to orangutans': Report reveals MAGA’s new bogus voter fraud scheme","text":"Republicans have come up with a new baseless theory for uncovering \"voter fraud,\" wrote Abby Vesoulis for Mother Jones — and while the new lawsuits they are filing probably won't go anywhere, they could still succeed in their overall purpose.

Indeed, wrote Vesoulis, they are gearing up to spend an unprecedented amount of money, not on campaign ads or canvassing, but on election litigation and poll watchers: \"The party’s recent maneuvering suggests a far more sophisticated — and more dangerous — strategy.

Claims out of Bidenworld have it that he’s convinced Kamala can’t win — and is spitting mad that Joe jumped the gun on crowning her as his replacement; ‘Bam had wanted several candidates to compete, with a winner chosen at the convention. But the party, doubtless exhausted after weeks of tension over whether Biden would drop, rushed to embrace Harris to end the drama. And Democrats figure Harris is a (relatively) fresh face; though her approval ratings are as low as Biden’s, they’re surely not as firmly locked in. The same messaging machine (including most of the media) that covered up Biden’s decline can now turn (shamelessly) to covering her flaws. They only have to make it work for the bit over four months to Election Day, and they’ve already got a social-media blitz going. Thing is, Kamala’s flaws are many: She’s crashed and burned while trying to discuss policy almost as often as Joe. She has little experience actually governing, and she’s thrown her support behind lefty causes, like The Green New Deal and defunding the police, that centrist Americans oppose. Not to mention the “border czar” fiasco — and her media enablers have already burned themselves trying to memory-hole that. Nor is it clear how much the public trusts the press after the Biden revelations. Plus, Harris’ former staffers (and she’s gone through a lot of them) routinely complain that she doesn’t do her homework, then blames her minions when she’s caught out. Doesn’t bode well for live interviews (perhaps a repeat of her meltdown with Lester Holt?) nor for debating Donald Trump. To be clear: Switching out Joe for Kamala ups the challenge for the Trump-Vance ticket; polls suggest the race is already tighter, and the Dems’ convention, including her VP pick, might tighten it up more. Republicans are still feeling out the right tone to attack a nominee who’s a black woman: Dems will call them racist and sexist no matter what, but the voters will judge for themselves. Yet she may still bomb, and forcing out one nominee is surely the limit or Democrats will lose the “democracy” issue entirely. We’ll likely never know for sure if Obama really wanted Sen. Mark Kelly or whoever, but we do know he’s a smart guy. And we suspect the early coronation of Kamala Harris will prove not that smart.","summary":"While endorsements for Kamala Harris pile up from all corners of the Democratic Party, there's one glaring omission: Barack Obama.","url":"https://nypost.com/2024/07/25/opinion/barack-obamas-instincts-that-kamala-isnt-a-winner-are-spot-on/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/07/newspress-collage-vju7cgyys-1721948929894.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&1721934647&w=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-07-25 23:36:14","author":"Post Editorial Board","authors":["Post Editorial Board"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.42},{"id":252643770,"title":"Letters: Harris’ skills | GOP rants | Vaccination promise | Mideast peace","text":"Harris has the skills to win White House Re: “Biden bows out” (Page A1, July 22). I was worried about Joe Biden stepping aside. But now it seems to be going well. Kamala Harris certainly has the experience to put Donald Trump where he belongs — never to step into the White House again. Trump has taken away women’s rights. He got the Supreme Court to give him almost full immunity, which includes not being subject to the rule of law. We should all be aware of Trump’s Agenda 47 and his Project 2025. If those things come to pass, we will descend even further into an autocracy, which is all he wants: nothing for the American people, all for him. If we listen to Kamala Harris, then we can God bless America again. Gae Mora Concord Trump, Vance rants should be known to all Re: “Mallard Fillmore” (Page B9, July 24). Bruce Tinsley is whitewashing Donald Trump again. The East Bay Times should create a running list of Trump’s pronouncements and fantasies. Publish this list in every edition. Add JD Vance’s choicest eruptions. Go back in time to Trump’s demeaning statements as to how he regards women. Add the diatribes, the unrelenting conviction that the 2020 election was fraudulent, the crackpot economic pronouncements, the war-ending, wand-waving dreams. Refute Tinsley with the recorded evidence. Trump and Vance are menaces whose words should be displayed in bold print. Americans need to be reminded daily that these are men who make vacuous promises as to how they will create an economic nirvana.

James Hammill Walnut Creek U.S. must honor vaccination promise No child should lose their life contracting a disease which could have been prevented by simply receiving a vaccine immunization. Disappointedly, more than 14 million children received no vaccine at all last year. GAVI, The Vaccine Alliance was established in 2000 to save lives, decrease poverty, and protect the world against the threat of epidemics and pandemics by increasing the equitable and sustainable use of vaccines. The success of GAVI has proven substantial. Prior to 2000 approximately 10 million children died each year prior to their fifth birthday. Since 2000, GAVI has helped vaccinate more than 1 billion children in 78 lower-income countries preventing more than a projected 17.3 million future deaths. On June 20 in Paris, first lady Dr. Jill Biden announced a U.S. pledge of at least $1.58 billion to GAVI over five years. Our representatives and senators must now sign the resolutions supporting GAVI, H. Res. 1286 and S. Res. 684.

Wilson, 20, in an exclusive interview with NBC News, responded to comments that Musk made Monday about her and her transgender identity. On social media and in an interview posted online, Musk said she was “not a girl” and was figuratively “dead,” and he alleged that he had been “tricked” into authorizing trans-related medical treatment for Wilson when she was 16. Wilson said that Musk had not been tricked and that, after initially hesitating, he knew what he was doing when he agreed to her treatment, which required consent from her parents. Musk’s recent statements crossed a line, she said. “I think he was under the assumption that I wasn’t going to say anything and I would just let this go, unchallenged,” Wilson said in a phone interview. “Which I’m not going to do because if you’re going to lie about me, like, blatantly to an audience of millions, I’m not just gonna let that slide.” Wilson said that, for as long as she could remember, Musk has not been a supportive father. She said he was rarely present in her life, leaving Wilson and her siblings to be cared for by their mother or by nannies even though Musk had joint custody, and she said Musk berated her when he was present. “He was cold,” she said. “He’s very quick to anger. He is uncaring and narcissistic.” Wilson said that, when she was a child, Musk would harass her for exhibiting feminine traits and would pressure her to appear more masculine, including by pushing her to deepen her voice as early as elementary school. “I was in fourth grade. We went on this road trip that I didn’t know was actually just an advertisement for one of the cars — I don’t remember which one — and he was constantly yelling at me viciously because my voice was too high,” she said. “It was cruel.” Musk did not respond to a request for comment. Wilson and her twin brother were born to Musk’s first wife, author Justine Musk. The couple divorced in 2008, and Wilson said her parents shared custody between their homes in the Los Angeles area. Musk, 53, is among the wealthiest people in the world through his stakes in Tesla, where he’s CEO, and in SpaceX, which he founded. He’s also become a significant political figure, having endorsed former President Donald Trump this month for another term in the White House. Musk has 12 children, including Wilson. Now a college student studying languages, Wilson has never granted an interview before and has largely stayed out of public view. She did, however, attract attention in 2022 when she sought court approval in California to change her name and, in the process, denounced her father. “I no longer live with or wish to be related to my biological father in any way, shape or form,” she said in the court filing. She told NBC News that at the time, she was surprised by the media attention to the court filing, which she submitted when she was 18. She said in the interview that she stands by what she wrote, though she said she might have tried to be more eloquent if she had known the coverage it would receive. Wilson said that she hadn’t spoken to Musk in about four years, and that she refused to be defined by him. “I would like to emphasize one thing: I am an adult. I am 20 years old. I am not a child,” she said. “My life should be defined by my own choices.” Musk threw a spotlight on Wilson on Monday by speaking about their relationship in a video interview with psychologist and conservative commentator Jordan Peterson streamed live on X, saying that he did not support Wilson’s gender identity. “I lost my son, essentially,” Musk said. He used Wilson’s birth name, also known as a deadname for transgender people, and said that she was “dead, killed by the woke mind virus.” And in a post on X Monday, Musk said that Wilson was “born gay and slightly autistic” and that, at age 4, she fit certain gay stereotypes such as loving musicals and using the exclamation “fabulous!” to describe certain clothing. Wilson told NBC News that those anecdotes are not true, though she said she did act stereotypically feminine in other ways as a child. Wilson also addressed Musk’s recent comments in a series of posts Thursday on the social media app Threads. “He doesn’t know what I was like as a child because he quite simply wasn’t there,” she wrote. “And in the little time that he was I was relentlessly harassed for my femininity and queerness.” “I’ve been reduced to a happy little stereotype,” she continued. “I think that says alot about how he views queer people and children in general.” In recent years, Musk has taken a hard-right turn into conservative politics and has been waging a campaign against transgender people and policies designed to support them. This month, he said he was pulling his businesses out of California to protest a new state law that bars schools from requiring that trans kids be outed to their parents. On the social media app X, Musk has for years criticized transgender rights, including medical treatments for trans-identifying minors, and the use of pronouns if different from what would be used at birth. He has promoted anti-trans content and called for arresting people who provide trans care to minors. After Musk bought X, then known as Twitter, in 2022, he rolled back the app’s protections for trans people including a ban on using deadnames. Musk told Peterson that Wilson’s gender transition has been the motivation for his push into conservative politics. “I vowed to destroy the woke mind virus after that, and we’re making some progress,” he said. Wilson was also mentioned in a biography of Musk by author Walter Isaacson — a book that she told NBC News was inaccurate and unfair to her. The book refers to her politics as “radical Marxism,” quoting Musk’s sister-in-law Christiana Musk, but Wilson said she’s not a Marxist, though she said she does oppose wealth inequality. The book also calls her by her middle name, Jenna. Wilson said that Isaacson never reached out to her directly ahead of publication. In a phone interview Thursday, Isaacson said that he had reached out to Wilson through family members. Christiana Musk did not immediately respond to requests for comment Thursday. Wilson told NBC News that for years she had considered speaking out about Musk’s behavior as a parent and as a person, but that she could no longer remain silent after his comments Monday. She said she had never received an explanation for why her father spent so little time with her and her siblings — behavior by him that she now views as strange. “He was there, I want to say, maybe 10% of the time. That’s generous,” she said. “He had half custody, and he fully was not there.” “It was just a fact of life at the time, so I don’t think I realized just how abnormal of an experience it was,” she added. Wilson said she came out twice in life: once as gay in eighth grade, and a second time as transgender when she was 16. She said she doesn’t recall Musk’s response the first time, and she wasn’t present when Musk heard from others that she was transgender because by then the pandemic had started and she was living full-time with her mother. “She’s very supportive. I love her a lot,” Wilson said of her mom. The pandemic was a chance to escape Musk’s cruelty, she said. “When Covid hit, I was like, ‘I’m not going over there,’” she said. “It was basically very lucky timing.” Musk told Peterson in the interview that he had been “tricked” into signing documents authorizing transgender-related medical treatment for Wilson — an allegation that Wilson said isn’t true. “I was essentially tricked into signing documents for one of my older boys,” Musk said, using her birth name. “This was before I had really any understanding of what was going on, and we had Covid going on,” he said, adding that he was told that she might commit suicide. Wilson said that, in 2020, when she was still a minor at 16, she wanted to start treatment for severe gender dysphoria but needed the consent of both parents under California law. She said her mother was supportive, but that Musk was initially not. She said she texted him about it for a while. “I was trying to do this for months, but he said I had to go meet with him in person,” she said. “At that point, it was very clear that we both had a very distinct disdain for each other.” When she eventually went and gave him the medical forms, she said, he read them at least twice, once with her and then again on his own, before signing them. “He was not by any means tricked. He knew the full side effects,” she said. She said she took puberty blockers before switching to hormone-replacement therapy — treatments that she said were life-saving for her and other transgender people. “They save lives. Let’s not get that twisted,” she said. “They definitely allowed me to thrive.” She said she believed that the requirements to obtain such treatments remain onerous, with teenagers pressured to say they’re at extreme risk of self-harm before they’ll be approved. She said she felt judged by Musk and Peterson, in the Monday interview, for not being at a high enough risk in their eyes. “I have been basically put into a point where, to a group of people, I have to basically prove whether or not I was suicidal or not to warrant medically transitioning,” she said. “It’s absolutely mind boggling.”","summary":"Vivian Wilson, the trans daughter of Elon Musk, said in her first public interview that he was an absent father who harassed her as a child for being feminine.","url":"https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/tech-news/elon-musk-transgender-daughter-vivian-wilson-interview-rcna163665","image":"https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-1500w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2024-07/240725-elon-musk-vivian-jenna-wilson-transgender-cs-8a4956.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-07-25 23:30:00","author":"David Ingram","authors":["David Ingram"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.308},{"id":252643772,"title":"Warriors star Stephen Curry backs Kamala Harris for president at Olympic news conference in Paris","text":"Vice President Kamala Harris will have the endorsement of a prominent Bay Area athlete as she looks to win the Democratic presidential nomination in the coming weeks and, eventually, the election in November. Golden State Warriors superstar Stephen Curry spoke glowingly of the Oakland-born Harris in a news conference on Thursday ahead of the U.S. men’s basketball team’s first group-stage game against Serbia. “It’s a very interesting time for our country, for sure,” Curry said. “The fact that President Biden gave the endorsement, Vice President Harris is primed to bring her energy to this campaign and, hopefully if she’s on the ticket, winning the election. It’s a big deal, to say the least.” Harris, a longtime Warriors fan, met with the U.S. men’s team after a training camp practice earlier this month. Curry said he hopes a gold medal performance in Paris can help bring positive energy to Harris and bring the country together ahead of the election. “She represents the Bay Area. She’s been a big supporter of us, so I want to give that energy back to her,” he said. “We’re representing our country here, and this is a very monumental next couple of months for the direction where we’re headed. Hopefully, this is a great way to do our part to continue unifying our country with how sports brings a lot of people together. For her, in this moment, knowing what’s ahead, it’s all about positive energy and optimism, knowing how divided our country is right now. [I’m] just excited for the journey ahead for her.” Following President Joe Biden’s announcement last weekend that he will not run for a second term, Harris earned the endorsement of Biden and many other prominent Democrats as the party’s nominee to go against Republican nominee and former President Donald Trump in November’s election. Despite Harris still needing to earn the nomination from delegates at the Democratic National Convention in August, she is favored to be the party’s candidate. Warriors head coach Steve Kerr also voiced his support for Harris, telling reporters on Thursday, “Kamala Harris is a great candidate and I will support her.” Curry will look to lead Team USA to its fifth consecutive Olympic gold medal. This year’s team is one of the more talented rosters the U.S. has put together, featuring the likes of Curry, LeBron James, Kevin Durant, Jayson Tatum, Joel Embiid, Anthony Davis and Devin Booker. While still favored to win gold, the U.S. will face stiff competition. France, Greece, Spain, Canada, Serbia and South Sudan all boast teams with NBA talent that could challenge the U.S. in different ways. The U.S. went 5-0 in lead-up games, but three wins came by six points or less. The American’s opening game against Serbia is scheduled for 8:15 a.m. on Sunday.","summary":"\"For her, in this moment, knowing what’s ahead, it’s all about positive energy and optimism, knowing how divided our country is right now.

Following Trump’s proposal for no tax on tips, Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX) introduced a new bill that would eliminate federal income taxes on tips. House Republicans introduced a separate bill that would not allow tips to be “subject to income or employment taxes.” “American workers in dozens of industries depend on tipped wages to support themselves,” Cruz said in the press release announcing the Senate bill. “This legislation is a common-sense pro-worker bill that will help families deal with the historic inflation caused by the Biden administration.” However, the vast majority of workers in the United States workforce receive tips, according to the Center For American Progress. The organization found that Cruz’s bill “leaves out more than 95 percent of low- and moderate-wage workers.” One Fair Wage, an advocacy group for tipped workers, working with the Food Labor Research Center at the University of California, Berkeley, found that nearly half of restaurant workers who rely on tips earn less than $13,850, which is the threshold needed to pay for income tax. “Many of these workers make so little that they will not come close to paying federal income tax under current law and thus would not benefit at all from Trump’s proposal,” Howard Gleckman, a senior fellow at the Tax Policy Center, said in a statement.

The Australian-born architect, 29 - who also wore a daring outfit last week to grab a bite at the iconic landmark - returned with the Heartless rapper, 47, to enjoy lunch together at the hotel. She barely covered up her cleavage in a skimpy, nude-colored bralette top as well as a pair of white, micro shorts - not paying any heed to the business casual dress at the Chateau Marmont. Censori additionally slipped into a pair of closed-toed, black heels that were secured with thin straps that wrapped around her ankles. Her short, brunette locks were parted to the side, and fell down in natural waves to nearly brush the tips of her shoulders.

She was seen arriving to the legendary venue on Thursday while stepping out of a sleek, Tesla Cybertruck West - who is also known as Ye - joined his wife for the lunch date and opted for an all-black ensemble that comprised of a black hoodie and comfy sweatpants. The performer also slipped into a pair of black shoes while also sporting black shades and a bracelet in his left wrist. Censori's return to the Chateau Marmont in another daring look comes shortly after an insider revealed whether the architect was welcome at the hotel - which costs around a whopping $774-a-night. A valet at the landmark told DailyMail.com on Wednesday, 'She comes here all the time. I always know when she's here because there's always a lot of paparazzi.' 'She comes a lot. She stayed here awhile, a few months I think, and last time she was here was before the weekend, Tuesday or Wednesday.' In regards to her risqué looks when paying a visit to the hotel, the valet revealed, 'She always dresses like that.'

(WSVN) — Ahead of the meeting between former President Donald Trump and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Friday, authorities said security is a top priority for the area. Palm Beach County Sheriff Ric Bradshaw said preparations are underway for a smooth meeting between the two leaders. “We’re well trained at this. We protected the president for four years here. We’ve never had a glitch,” he said. Bradshaw said that despite the assassination attempt on July 13 on former President Trump’s life, his office is ready for Netanyahu’s visit. “There’s a lot of apprehension out here, I think, right now, about presidential visits and dignitaries, given what happened in [Pennsylvania],” said Bradshaw. Bradshaw said that when Netanyahu arrives on Friday, Southern Boulevard will be closed to get him from the airport to Trump’s Mar-a-Lago estate. During that ride, demonstrators who wish to protest the visit will be allowed on both sides of the roadway, but the sheriff said there is one big limit. “Don’t go in the road, folks. That’s a no-no, all right?” said Bradshaw. “I know some of the protesters like to shut roads down and make a statement. That ain’t gonna happen here. We’re not going to allow it.” His comments about pro-Palestinian protesters come after some of the protests outside the U.S. Capitol turned destructive on Wednesday while Netanyahu was giving an address to a joint session of Congress. Netanyahu continued his Washington, D.C., trip with a sit-down meeting with both President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris. “From a proud Jewish Zionist to an Irish American Zionist, I want to thank you for 59 years of support for the state of Israel,” said Netanyahu. The two leaders spoke about the latest efforts to reach a cease-fire agreement between Hamas and Israel, a war that has killed thousands of Palestinians, with at least 100 Israelis still held captive. “My message to Benjamin Netanyahu is very simple: go for the deal that would release all the hostages, along with a cease-fire. We need loved ones back home,” said Yehuda Cohen, the father of a hostage being held by Hamas. As Netanyahu lands in Palm Beach on Friday, Trump had some advice to the prime minister. “You have to end this fast. It can’t continue to go on like this. It’s too long,” said Trump in a Fox News interview. The sheriff also said there will be correction vans set up in case anybody gets too rowdy or blocks the roads.

Trump’s lawyers earlier this month asked Manhattan Supreme Court Justice Juan Merchan to vacate his conviction and dismiss the underlying indictment in light of the July 1 ruling by the Supreme Court’s conservative majority finding that most actions undertaken by presidents in the course of “official acts” are immune from criminal prosecution. Opposing the request in new filings, Assistant District Attorney Matthew Colangelo argued that Trump’s conviction for reimbursing his personal lawyer, Michael Cohen, for hush money under the table and the underlying scheme were utterly unrelated to his official duties. “(All) of the evidence that he complains of either concerned wholly unofficial conduct or, at most, official conduct for which any presumption of immunity has been rebutted. The Supreme Court’s recent ruling thus has nothing to say about defendant’s conviction,” Colangelo wrote. “(The) scheme was entirely personal and largely committed before the election, and it had no relationship whatsoever to any official duty of the presidency,” the prosecutor later wrote. The jury’s May 30 verdict finding Trump guilty of 34 felonies determined he falsified records to cover up payback to Cohen for silencing Daniels, illegally documenting checks to him as compensation for legitimate legal services. The verdict made him the first U.S. president to be criminally convicted and could be his only conviction if he wins the election. He still faces two other criminal cases in Fulton County, Georgia, and Washington, D.C., alleging he plotted to overturn President Biden’s win in 2020, in which he’s pleaded not guilty. Neither case is expected to make it to trial before the election, and it’s unclear whether they ever will if he wins. The federal case in Florida alleging Trump hoarded classified documents after his presidency and hid them from authorities was dismissed by a Trump-appointed judge in a decision that sent shockwaves through the legal community last week. Federal prosecutors are appealing the ruling, which could take years. Although Trump’s Manhattan case mostly centered on the year leading up to his presidency — when prosecutors alleged the hush money scheme was carried out to win the election — his defense team has argued that any evidence presented to jurors relating to his time in office in 2017 and 2018, including the reimbursement to Cohen, was out-of-bounds, thus nullifying the verdict. The Supreme Court’s immunity decision, which is expected to pare down Trump’s federal election subversion case significantly, also blocked prosecutors from presenting evidence of presidential acts while trying to prove a president’s unofficial acts were against the law. Among other examples, Trump’s defense team has argued that testimony by his campaign manager and then White House communications director, Hope Hicks, was impermissible. She told jurors that in early 2018, Trump acknowledged he reimbursed Cohen for paying off Daniels and said it would have been worse had the payoff been reported by the media before the 2016 election. In their motion, they also cited tweets Trump fired off from his official presidential account on Twitter, now known as “X,” which prosecutors presented as evidence that Trump tried to intimidate Cohen from cooperating with authorities probing the hush money scheme. In the filing made public Thursday, prosecutors said that even if some evidence was improperly admitted at trial, Merchan should let Trump’s conviction stand as the trial record contained “overwhelming evidence” of his guilt. “For all the pages that defendant devotes to his current motion, the evidence that he claims is affected by the Supreme Court’s ruling constitutes only a sliver of the mountains of testimony and documentary proof that the jury considered in finding him guilty of all 34 felony charges beyond a reasonable doubt,” Colangelo wrote. “Under these circumstances, there is no basis for disturbing the jury’s verdict, and defendant’s motion should be denied.” Merchan granted a defense request to delay Trump’s sentencing, initially slated for July 11 until Sept. 18, “if such is still necessary” following the Supreme Court ruling. He’s expected to rule on Trump’s request to throw out the verdict by Sept. 6. Attorneys for Trump did not immediately respond to requests seeking comment.","summary":"The former president's lawyers had asked a judge to overturn his conviction for falsifying records.","url":"https://www.centralmaine.com/2024/07/25/supreme-court-immunity-ruling-has-no-effect-on-donald-trump-hush-money-conviction-manhattan-da-says/","image":"https://w2pcms.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2024/05/Trump_Hush_Money_86466.jpg?w=1000","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-07-25 23:20:51","author":"Molly Crane-Newman","authors":["Molly Crane-Newman"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.283},{"id":252642908,"title":"Kamala Harris tightening gap with Donald Trump as more national polls show presidential race within margin of error","text":"While Democrats have gone through a month of anxiety about their electoral chances in the presidential race, it appears substituting Kamala Harris for Joe Biden atop the ticket hasn’t hurt the incumbent party at all. At least that’s the takeaway from two new national surveys dropped Thursday showing the race with Donald Trump is too close to call. The New York Times-Siena College sampling of 1,142 likely voters shows the Republican nominee with a marginal lead over the Democratic vice president — 48% to 47% with leaners factored in — and giving every indication the race for the White House could have a photo finish in November. The NYT-Siena survey shows that both Trump and Harris command intraparty loyalty, with 93% of Republicans and Democrats saying they’re behind their party’s standard bearer. Harris has a slight edge with independent voters in a two-way race, with 47% backing the veep, 45% behind Trump and 7% up for grabs. When the field is expanded to include Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and other marginal candidates like Libertarian Chase Oliver, the Green Party’s Jill Stein and independent Cornel West, the Siena survey is more sterling still for Harris. She leads Trump 44% to 43% in that expanded field, with the support of 89% of Democrats, 70% of black voters, 52% of Hispanic voters, and 51% of women. While she doesn’t have a majority of independents, with 41% backing her in the larger field many voters will see on their ballots this fall, she’s 4 points ahead of Trump with that subgroup. The poll evenly sampled Republicans and Democrats, at 33% each, with independents 29% of the participants. In another poll of 1,170 registered voters, which YouGov and the Times of London conducted after Biden withdrew from the race but before his Wednesday night address from the Oval Office, the race is also too close to call. Trump leads Harris by just 2 points, 46% to 44%, with the marginal candidates shedding vote share as seems to happen every four years. Kennedy is at a lowly 4% in this sample, with Stein at 1% and the hapless Cornel West mired at 0%. As poll watchers know, there are key differences between registered voter and likely voter models, but some things remain the same. Even those surveyed who don’t claim to be fully committed to voting are loyal to their party’s picks, with 92% of Republicans backing Trump and 91% of Democrats behind Harris. Independents in this poll skew toward Trump, meanwhile, but not overwhelmingly: 45% to 37%, with Kennedy taking 8% of unaligned voters, Stein 2% and West 1%. Gender splits take center stage here also, with 54% of men backing Trump and 51% of women supporting Harris. Democrats have been messaging heavily on reproductive rights since the 2022 Dobbs decision, which Harris and others blame Trump for, given that his three Supreme Court picks drove the reversal of Roe v. Wade. Expect messaging along these lines through Election Day from the Harris team. While Trump has 54% support among white voters, the YouGov/Times of London poll nonetheless suggests his won’t be a rainbow coalition. Only 12% of black voters back the former president, with 72% on side for Harris. Trump has spent some time this cycle trying to juice the African-American vote, but those efforts haven’t paid off in this survey. Hispanic voters are leaning Harris here also, 44% to 40%. Against Biden in many polls, Trump ran even or was actually ahead. But this is a new presidential race. And it’s anyone’s guess who will prevail.","summary":"While Democrats have gone through a month of anxiety about their electoral chances in the presidential race, it appears substituting Kamala Harris for Joe Biden atop the ticket hasn’t hurt the incumbent party at all.

Sacks wrote in a post that during the storming of the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, Biden was in “no danger of being deposed” but was “actually deposed,” when he stepped down as the party’s presumptive nominee this Sunday, calling the move a “coup.” You were sanctioned by the SEC. Nobody else, only you. But you’ve spent the last decade trying to shift the blame onto others for your own poor ethics. ? pic.twitter.com/j3F8A3boFH— David Sacks (@DavidSacks) July 24, 2024 The mention of a coup prompted Conrad to reply. “Let me tell you, coups are this man’s speciality,” Conrad posted, recalling the acrimonious falling out the men had nearly a decade ago while at a software startup. The background to the brief sparring session is the two worked together at Zenefits, a startup founded by Conrad where he was CEO. Sacks was an investor in the company and served as COO. In 2016, Conrad and Zenefits encountered compliance issues that ultimately resulted in an SEC settlement and his departure from the company. While the argument on X this week quickly turned personal, with Sacks and Conrad reliving their years-old feud, it started because of a post that’s emblematic of an industrywide rift that is distinctly contemporary. The November election between Trump and Harris has divided Silicon Valley in ways previous elections haven’t. A growing contingent of high-profile industry leaders—Sacks, Elon Musk, and venture capitalist pairing Marc Andreesen and Ben Horowitz— have thrown their support behind Trump. That, in and of itself, is a surprising development for the tech industry, which is centered in the traditionally liberal Bay Area and has historically backed Democrats. Harris, a Bay Area politician herself, is familiar to many tech executives, whom she has both regulated and courted for donations. Sacks did not respond to a request for comment from Fortune. Conrad, through a spokesperson for his current company, Rippling, declined to comment for this article. Zenefits was an HR software company that also acted as a health insurance brokerage firm. However, the company ran into trouble when Buzzfeed alleged that Conrad wrote a computer script that made it appear as though some brokers had completed a legally required training course when they hadn’t. Ultimately, in 2017 the SEC settled with Zenefits and Conrad for a combined $1 million for “materially false and misleading statements and omissions.” (Conrad and the company neither admitted nor denied wrongdoing as part of the settlement.) On X, Sacks brushed off Conrad’s mention of their shared history. “You were sanctioned by the SEC,” Sacks wrote on X with a screenshot of Conrad’s reply. “Nobody else, only you. But you’ve spent the last decade trying to shift the blame onto others for your own poor ethics.” That’s when Paul Graham chimed in on X to offer his two cents. (Graham, a veteran tech investor, is best known for starting the wildly successful startup incubator Y Combinator.) “Do you really want the full story of what you did to Parker to be told publicly?” Graham replied to Sacks. “Because it’s the worst case of an investor maltreating a founder that I’ve ever heard, and I’ve heard practically all of them.” Graham did not respond to a request for comment from Fortune. While at Y Combinator, Graham funded hundreds of startups, as spots in the incubator became increasingly competitive and coveted. Over his career he’s worked with the likes of Airbnb founder Brian Chesky, Dropbox founders Drew Houston and Arash Ferdowsi, and the Collison brothers, who founded Stripe. Sacks dismissed Graham, saying the two had never met or worked together, and accused Conrad of “publicly fuming and smearing me.” Others leapt to Conrad’s defense, with former journalist and tech watcher Eric Newcomer accusing Sacks of unfairly blaming Conrad for company problems. Conrad maintains he was unfairly forced out of the company he started. In a 2022 interview, Conrad said that, after he agreed to step down from Zenefits to be replaced by Sacks, the duo, in conjunction with the board, drafted a “friendly” press release announcing his departure. Conrad said he was blindsided when, a few hours after he signed the paperwork to resign, Sacks issued a press release blaming him for Zenefits’ problems. On Thursday, Sacks seemed ready to move on from the issue. “Personally I think it’s a huge waste of time to still be talking about this a decade later,” he wrote on X.","summary":"A politically charged mention of “coups” brought back David Sacks’ ousting of Parker Conrad from the startup he founded.","url":"https://fortune.com/2024/07/25/a-post-about-kamala-harris-pushed-a-long-simmering-feud-between-tech-execs-into-the-open/","image":"https://fortune.com/img-assets/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/GettyImages-2161586982-e1721940077538.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-07-25 23:07:06","author":"Paolo Confino","authors":["Paolo Confino"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.538},{"id":252642618,"title":"Kamala Harris Joins TikTok","text":"Vice President Kamala Harris, who is now running for president in 2024 against Donald Trump, on Thursday launched her own account on social-entertainment app TikTok.

But, the question is will a second term be the same as the ex-president's first term, or this time round, some family members will have a more influential presence in the Oval Office than others? The Republican National Convention gave an insight into the family's current political hierarchy. The Milwaukee event had MAGA supporters chanting \"Fight!\" as the politician emerged after recovering from an assassination attempt. His political allies and family members cheered for him as the GOP wrapped up the day with a rather un-Trump speech style. However, noticeably, almost every family member was present at the convention except his youngest Barron Trump. During the RNC, his eldest son Don Jr. was omnipresent. He is currently serving as executive vice president of the Trump Organization and he spoke at length about his father's near-death experience and the MAGA campaign's future plans if re-elected. Don Jr. has emerged as Trump's staunch supporter and arguably he's been more politically active campaigning for his father, openly criticizing his rivals Joe Biden and Kamala Harris, and ensuring he change the narrative around the former president like a loyal son. It has also been reported that JD Vance, Trump's running mate is a good friend of Don Jr. Corey Lewandowski, who ran Trump's campaign in 2016 and is also on board for the 2024 campaign, told USA Today, \"I think Don Jr. is the one who delivers his father's message most closely to the way he would do it. He has a massive following… and Don. Jr truly loves this stuff, I mean that's what he does.\" Meanwhile, former First Daughter Ivanka and her husband Jared Kushner, who were the controversial senior advisors during Trump's administration from 2017 to 2021, appeared low-key throughout the convention. The couple came on the last night of the RNC and were not among the keynote speakers. They briefly joined Trump on stage and clearly wouldn't be active members of Trump's upcoming administration. Moving onto the ex-commander-in-chief's Slovenian wife Melania Trump who's been a silent supporter throughout her husband's political career. Although she too, like Ivanka, joined her husband on stage to show her support, it is unlikely that she'd break her \"private person\" image as one source said she's \"through a lot\" lately like losing her mother and watching her husband being nearly killed. Tiffany, Eric, and his wife Lara Trump have also been using their platforms to amplify MAGA voices. While Tiffany, Trump's daughter with ex-wife Marla Maples, hasn't been an active political figure, she frequently graces events to support her father. During the RNC, Eric's wife Lara told the crowd, \"Maybe you got to see a side of Donald Trump on Saturday that you were not sure existed until you saw it with your own eyes,\" per BBC. The 18-year-old Barron who recently graduated from school is set to go to college and made his first-ever debut at Trump's rally in Miami. Although there have been reports that the youngest son has political inclinations and had also been announced as a delegate for his father in Florida, it was speculated that his \"fiercely protective\" mother, Melania objected. So, who'd take on a more active role in Trump's second-term administration? Charlie Kirk, the founder of the youth-focused Turning Point USA, said, \"I think they'll all be influential.\"","summary":"For Donald Trump, the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee was a family affair with nearly every member in attendance.","url":"https://www.inquisitr.com/trumps-second-term-administration-could-allow-these-family-members-to-have-the-most-influence","image":"https://dab57h0r8ahff.cloudfront.net/707200/uploads/7c8f7990-4a63-11ef-be28-7322a0db7321_1200_630.jpeg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-07-25 23:01:33","author":"INQUISITR,Juwairiya Shariq","authors":["INQUISITR","Juwairiya Shariq"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.193},{"id":252643766,"title":"A Parkinson's Expert Has Visited the White House 8 Times Since Last Summer: Report","text":"Although POTUS Joe Biden is no longer in the 2024 presidential race, the speculations around his declining mental health are still dominating the headlines. The 81-year-old, has been scrutinized for freezing during speeches, missing cues, stumbles, and verbal gaffes. Amid all this, The New York Times reported that a Parkinson's expert visited the White House multiple times. Apparently, a neurologist, Dr. Kevin Cannard, who recently published a paper on Parkinson's and specializes in movement disorders, paid a visit to the Presidential Palace eight times in eight months from last summer to this spring. According to official visitor logs, out of those eight trips, one time, he even had a meeting with Biden's personal physician. The logs document visits from July 2023 through March this year under the White House's voluntary disclosure policy. However, it is unclear whether he met the Democrat specifically or for other unrelated meetings. Dr. Cannard has been serving the White House officials and their families for over a decade. His social media platform, such as LinkedIn, describes his profile as 'supporting the White House Medical Unit' for more than 12 years, including during the administrations of Barack Obama and Donald Trump. Amid the curiosity around the POTUS' health, his doctor released a letter later on Monday, July 8, 2024, shedding light on the Parkinson's expert's numerous visits to The White House. Kevin O'Connor, Biden's physician, said that Cannard has been a longstanding in-house neurology consultant to the official residence's medical unit. While he did check Biden for his three annual physicals, he also looks after the active-duty military members. The letter further explained, \"Seeing patients at the White House is something that Dr. Cannard has been doing for a dozen years.\" Meanwhile, the letter further explained Cannard hasn't been chosen because he's a Parkinson's expert but because of his 'wide expertise which makes him flexible to see a variety of patients and problems' as a well-trained medic at Walter Reed and across the Military Health System. This explanation of Dr. Cannard's visits was followed by a tense exchange between press secretary Karine Jean Pierre and the journalists who repeatedly asked her to reveal the name of the specialist (which she refused citing it would breach the privacy of those being treated in the White House). The back-and-forth clash and Jean Pierre's hesitation to answer some questions led to more concerns, as per Politico. Biden's lacking mental sharpness was already gaining media attention but his disappointing performance at CNN's presidential debate against rival Trump cemented him as a frail, old man who needs to retire instead of running the United States. His critics demanded he resign immediately, and even his own people from the Democratic Party were reported to have talked to him about abandoning his re-election campaign, which he finally did on July 21, 2024. His stumbles, gaffes, and missteps may have been a weapon for his political rivals, but in an interview with MSNBC's Morning Joe, the 46th president of the US insisted, \"I've been out. I've been testing myself, testing everywhere I go. Going out and making the case. The night of that debate, I went out. I was out until 2 o'clock in the morning that very night. That very night.

Trump, 78, revealed his wish for ferocious retaliation in a Truth Social post on Thursday, in which he included a clip of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu discussing the Islamic Republic’s assassination threats during his address to Congress. “If they do ‘assassinate President Trump,’ which is always a possibility, I hope that America obliterates Iran, wipes it off the face of the Earth,” the Republican nominee for president said. “If that does not happen, American Leaders will be considered ‘gutless’ cowards!” he added. Trump’s call for his hypothetical death to be avenged comes less than two weeks after an would-be assassin’s bullet grazed his ear at a Butler, Pa., campaign rally, leaving him bloodied, two rally-goers injured and one man, 50-year-old hero firefighter Corey Comperatore, dead. In the days after the assassination attempt, US officials revealed that they had received intelligence about an Iranian plot to kill Trump just weeks before the July 13 rally shooting. The threat was shared with the lead Secret Service agent on Trump’s protection detail and with the former president’s campaign, US officials said. The White House National Security Council noted last week that it has been tracking Iranian threats against Trump administration officials “for years,” and that they stem from the rogue nation’s “desire to seek revenge for the killing of Qassem Soleimani,” the leader of the Iranian Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps’ Quds Force who was taken out on Trump’s orders in 2020.

You want to talk? Good. Otherwise you can have a bad economy for the next three years.” Trump invoked similar rhetoric against North Korea in 2017, warning that the hermit kingdom would face “fire and fury like the world has never seen” if it continued its belligerent behavior against the US.","summary":"“If they do ‘assassinate President Trump,’ which is always a possibility, I hope that America obliterates Iran, wipes it off the face of the Earth,” the Republican nominee for president said. ","url":"https://nypost.com/2024/07/25/us-news/trump-hopes-us-obliterates-iran-if-hes-assassinated-by-the-american-adversary/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/07/newspress-collage-mmvxcaygj-1721945955854.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&1721931707&w=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/7AHRPixO-RyIcpnTz.mp4","publish_date":"2024-07-25 23:00:08","author":"Victor Nava","authors":["Victor Nava"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.307},{"id":252642780,"title":"Trump Rally Gunman May Have Had Pro-Biden Account on Far-Right Site","text":"Andrew Torba, the founder of the far-right favorite social media site Gab, wrote in a blog post Wednesday that Thomas Matthew Crooks, the man who attempted to take former President Donald Trump’s life at a campaign rally earlier this month, may have been a user of the site. “Today Gab learned that Thomas Crooks, the deranged Joe Biden supporter who attempted to assassinate President Donald Trump, may have had an account on our platform,” Torba wrote in the post. “We are unable to confirm that the account in question actually belonged to him, but have reason to believe it does after receiving an emergency disclosure request from a law enforcement agency.” The account called ‘epicMicrowave’ was created in September 2019 and made nine posts on the site, most of which defended various policies championed by President Joe Biden.","summary":"Aaron Josefczyk/ReutersAndrew Torba, the founder of the far-right favorite social media site Gab, wrote in a blog post Wednesday that Thomas Matthew Crooks, the man who attempted to take former President Donald Trump’s life at a campaign rally earlier...","url":"https://nation.lk/online/trump-rally-gunman-may-have-had-pro-biden-account-on-far-right-site-271888.html","image":"https://nation.lk/online/site/assets/img/broken.gif","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-07-25 23:00:05","author":"President Joe Biden","authors":["President Joe Biden"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"lk","sentiment":-0.49},{"id":252642782,"title":"‘The View’s’ Ana Navarro Uses Nude Melania Trump Photo to Defend Kamala Harris","text":"Ana Navarro, a long-time co-host of The View, posted on her Instagram Thursday an old photo of nude Melania Trump.

Growth last quarter also received a boost from inventory building as well as increased government spending, the Commerce Department’s advance report on second-quarter gross domestic product today showed. The housing market recovery, however, regressed and was a small drag on the economy. The trade deficit widened further, subtracting from GDP growth. The report dispelled concerns that the economic expansion was in danger of an abrupt end, which had been stoked by a lackluster performance in the first quarter and in April. The economy continues to outperform its global peers, despite hefty rate hikes from the U.S. central bank in 2022 and 2023, thanks to a resilient labor market. “Economic growth is solid, not too hot and not too cold,” said Christopher Rupkey, chief economist at FWDBONDS. “Inflation looks to be going the Fed’s way and an easing of monetary restraint with an interest rate cut is likely in September.” Gross domestic product increased at a 2.8% annualized rate last quarter, the Commerce Department’s Bureau of Economic Analysis said in its advance estimate of second-quarter GDP. That was double the 1.4% growth pace in the first quarter. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast GDP rising at a 2.0% rate. Estimates ranged from a 1.1% rate to a 3.4% pace. The growth rate in the first half of the year averaged 2.1%, half the 4.2% pace logged in the last six months of 2023. That is just above the 1.8% pace viewed by U.S. central bank officials as the non-inflationary growth rate. Consumer spending, which accounts for more than two-thirds of the economy, increased at around a 2.3% rate after slowing to a 1.5% pace in the January-March quarter. Spending was driven by increased outlays on services like healthcare, housing and utilities as well as club memberships, visits to sports centers, parks, theaters and museums, and gambling. Consumers also boosted outlays on goods, including new light trucks, recreational goods and vehicles, furnishings and durable household equipment as well as energy products. Spending was in part supported by wage gains. A separate report from the Labor Department today showed the labor market steadily easing, with initial claims for state unemployment benefits dropping 10,000 to a seasonally adjusted 235,000 for the week ended July 20. Business investment picked up as spending on equipment, mostly aircraft, surged at an 11.6% rate after rising at only a 1.6% pace in the first quarter. Spending on intellectual property products continued to rise, though the pace slowed from the brisk rate in the January-March quarter. Businesses also accumulated more inventory, which increased at a $71.3 billion rate after rising at a $28.6 billion pace in the prior quarter. Inventories added 0.82 percentage point to GDP growth after being a drag for two straight quarters. That more than offset a 0.72 percentage point hit from a wider trade gap. STRONG DOMESTIC DEMAND Even discounting inventories, trade and government spending, growth was solid last quarter, with domestic demand rising at a 2.6% pace. The increase in final sales to private domestic purchasers matched the gain in the January-March quarter. “The U.S. economy is much stronger than people realize and to the extent that markets were worried about a growth slowdown, they should breathe a sigh of relief,” said Chris Zaccarelli, chief investment officer at Independent Advisor Alliance. Stocks on Wall Street were mixed. The dollar slipped against a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury prices rose. The rise in GDP growth bodes well for a pick-up in productivity, which would slow the pace of increase in labor costs and ultimately price pressures. The personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index, excluding the volatile food and energy components, increased at a 2.9% rate after surging at a 3.7% pace in the first quarter. While the rise in the so-called core PCE price index was slightly above economists’ expectations for a 2.7% rate of increase, the trend is slowing. Core inflation increased 2.7% from a year ago, welcome news for policymakers ahead of their two-day policy meeting next week. The core PCE price index is one of the inflation measures tracked by the Fed for its 2% target. “We think revisions to past data may explain part of the miss,” said Daniel Vernazza, chief international economist at UniCredit Bank. The government’s broadest gauge of prices in the economy, the gross domestic purchases price index, rose at a 2.3% pace after jumping at a 3.1% rate in the January-March quarter. The Fed has maintained its benchmark overnight interest rate in the current 5.25%-5.50% range for the past year. It has hiked its policy rate by 525 basis points since 2022. Financial markets expect three rate cuts this year, starting in September. Despite the solid economic growth pace, the outlook for the second half of the year is hazy. The labor market is slowing, which will impact wage gains. Though wages rose, income at the disposal of households after adjusting for inflation and taxes increased more slowly last quarter, rising at a 1.0% rate after climbing at a 1.3% pace in the first quarter. That meant consumers turned to savings and also saved less to fund their spending last quarter. The saving rate fell to 3.5% from 3.8% in the January-March period and is now well below its pre-pandemic average. Economists also estimate that much of the Fed’s rate hikes is still to be felt. State and local government revenues are also slowing, which could erode spending. There are also worries about new tariffs, which could see businesses front-loading imports if former President Donald Trump is returned to the White House in November’s presidential election. Nonetheless, a recession is not expected, with monetary policy easing anticipated this year. “Economic activity is indeed about to downshift into a below potential path in the second half of the year,” said Scott Anderson, chief U.S. economist at BMO Capital Markets.","summary":"WASHINGTON >> The U.S. economy grew faster than expected in the second quarter amid solid gains in consumer spending and business investment, but inflation pressures subsided, leaving intact expectations of a September interest rate cut from the Federal Reserve.","url":"https://www.staradvertiser.com/2024/07/25/breaking-news/u-s-economy-regains-speed-in-2nd-quarter-price-pressures-easing/","image":"https://www.staradvertiser.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/web1_2024-07-25T124916Z_1_LYNXMPEK6O0L8_RTROPTP_3_USA-ECONOMY.JPG","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-07-25 23:00:00","author":"Reuters","authors":["Reuters"],"language":"en","catgory":"business","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.37},{"id":252643200,"title":"First polls reveal how Kamala Harris stacks up to Donald Trump since Biden dropped out","text":"The US election landscape shifted dramatically this week as President Joe Biden bowed out of the 2024 race and endorsed his vice president, Kamala Harris, at the top of the Democratic ticket. Four days later, the majority of Democrats have thrown support to Harris to take on ex-president and Republican nominee Donald Trump. The first polls since Biden dropped out of the race have been released, and reveal how Harris is performing compared to Trump. Several polls show Harris in neck and neck competition with Trump. Vice President Kamala Harris has a higher favorability rating than President Joe Biden in a New York Times/Siena College poll (Picture: Getty Images) A New York Times/Siena College poll released on Thursday has Trump leading Harris by one percentage point – 48% versus 47%. Trump’s 48% support among registered voters is up from 42% in the last poll by the organizations which was conducted after Biden’s disastrous debate and after the ex-president survived an assassination attempt. It is his highest rating yet in the poll, which had prior figures for him ranging from 39% to 45%. Meanwhile, Harris’ ratings have seen a greater jump than Trump’s. Her rating is up from 36% favorability in February, but she still trails Trump narrowly. Harris’ rating is higher than Biden’s ever was in the poll.

Chris Christie for badmouthing her endorsement of Donald Trump. “I wasn’t surprised and I didn’t take happiness in it,” Haley told CNN’s Jake Tapper on Thursday of Biden’s decision to end his re-election bid. “I think through the whole campaign I fought for mental competency tests. I wasn’t doing it to be disrespectful.” “I was doing it because I think it’s not just Joe Biden. There is an issue that we have in DC where people will go into office, and they won’t let go. And then their staffers and their family keep propping them up. And it’s a problem for the American people.” Back in February 2023, Haley, 52, launched her presidential bid with a call for mental competency tests for politicians over 75 and predicted that the GOP would be squaring off against Vice President Kamala Harris. “The first party to retire its 80-year-old candidate is going to be the one who wins this election,” she chided in January of this year. Ultimately that prognostication came true this past Sunday when Biden, 81, withdrew from the presidential race and paved the way for Harris, 59, to become the presumptive Democratic nominee for president. Biden did so in the wake of a pressure campaign among Democrats amid concerns over his mental acuity. “The Democrats are very smart to put in a younger candidate. I think that that’s what America has craved. But I think what you look at it they put in the weakest candidate they just put in,” she said with a smile when asked if she still believes the party that retired its 80-year-old will win. Haley then ticked through a laundry list of complaints against Harris, going through her past positions on the border, crime, foreign policy, and more. Both Haley and Harris are of Indian descent. Some Republicans have attacked Harris as a diversity, equity, and inclusion — DEI hire. That’s a reference to Biden publicly pledging to hire a female running mate. Some Republican leaders urged their colleagues to stop those attacks about DEI against Harris. “It’s not helpful. We’re talking about a liberal senator, who literally has not accomplished very much and what she was given she didn’t do much with,” Haley said. “You don’t need to talk about what she looks like. Or what gender she is.” Haley made waves last week when she officially endorsed former President Donald Trump, 78, at the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee. She had previously indicated that she planned to vote for him. “I owed the millions of people who supported me — they deserve to know who I’m going to vote for, and why I’m going to vote for him,” she explained. One of her old rivals, former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, 61, sniped that her “speech was tortured ambition” and she did it because “she wants to run for president again.” Haley didn’t mince words on Christie, who infamously had a hot mic incident when he dropped out of the race before the New Hampshire primary and was heard badmouthing her. “I think it’s funny coming from a guy who didn’t even play in Iowa and couldn’t even get out of New Hampshire. I think he’s bitter to anybody that he’s ever dealt with,” she shot back. “It’s comical that it’s coming from a person who in 2016 literally did that one thing — fell all over himself for Trump to get a position in an administration and he still didn’t get it. I wish Chris well. I think he’s got a lot of torture demons inside of him.” She also denied the notion that she weathered significant pushback from Republicans who backed her in the primary over her backing of Trump. Haley further revealed that she does not have plans to campaign with him. Haley seemingly implied that Trump should also take a mental competency test given his age. Trump has boasted in the past about acing the Montreal Cognitive Assessment. “I have said — and it’s not just Donald Trump,” she said. “The American people deserve to know that everybody’s at the top of their game.” The former South Carolina governor and US ambassador to the United Nations had been the last rival to Trump standing before she dropped out in March. Trump seethed at her for staying in so long, at one point he even questioned the whereabouts of her husband, Michael, who was deployed overseas. “For me, it’s not personal. I know Donald Trump. He’s gonna throw something just to kind of get people upset and I think he got pushback for that,” she said. “What I do feel bad is those that are serving.” Haley had exchanged her fair amount of fire with Trump on the campaign trail as well, calling him toxic and unhinged. She said he has no plans of taking that back. “I said a lot of tough things about him in the campaign. He said a lot of tough things about me in the campaign. That’s what happens in campaigns. I don’t think we need to apologize or take anything back,” she reflected. “I don’t plan on doing that.” The Palmetto State Republican expressed gratitude for those who supported and helped her 2024 bid. She also revealed that she has no plans at the moment to seek the presidency or a gig in a hypothetical Trump administration in the future. Haley also took note of vice presidential hopeful JD Vance’s (R-Ohio) position on Ukraine and acknowledged that the Republican Party is splintering on foreign policy. “I think that there’s a division in the Republican Party on where we should be on foreign policy especially. We have seen that play out with Ukraine. What I will tell you is, when Russia gets a little bit, they want a little bit more and a little bit more,” she warned.","summary":"Former Republican presidential hopeful Nikki Haley said she isn't gleeful that her prediction of President Biden dropping out came to fruition and lashed out at former New Jersey Gov.

Netanyahu’s first White House visit since 2020 comes a day after he gave a fiery speech to Congress and at a time of growing pressure in Israel and the U.S. to find an endgame to the nine-month conflict that’s left more than 39,000 dead in Gaza and some 1,200 dead in Israel. Dozens of Israeli hostages are still languishing in Hamas captivity. Harris said in remarks after what she called a “frank and constructive meeting” with the Israeli leader that she supports Israel’s right to defend itself, but said, “how it does so matters.” She expressed concern over the “devastating” humanitarian situation in Gaza and images of civilians killed in the conflict, saying, “We cannot look away in the face of these tragedies.” She echoed Biden in calling for a swift cease-fire to end the fighting, at least for a time, to boost humanitarian aid to Gaza and release some of the most vulnerable hostages from Hamas captivity. White House officials say the negotiations are in the closing stages, but there are issues that need to be resolved. “The gaps are closable,” White House national security spokesman John Kirby said. He added, “But it’s going to require, as it always does, some leadership, some compromise.” Harris met with Netanyahu in her ceremonial office in the Eisenhower Executive Office Building. She is also expected to press him on securing a deal to release the hostages kidnapped during Hamas’ Oct. 7 attack on Israel that launched the war. “We have a lot to talk about,” Harris said as she welcomed the Israeli leader. “We do indeed,” he replied. Thousands protested Netanyahu’s visit in Washington, and Harris condemned those who were violent or used rhetoric that praised Hamas. Netanyahu, last at the White House when former President Donald Trump was in office, is headed to Florida on Friday to meet with the Republican presidential nominee. The conservative Likud Party leader Netanyahu and centrist Democrat Biden have had ups-and-downs over the years. Netanyahu, in what will likely be his last White House meeting with Biden, reflected on the roughly 40 years they’ve known each other and thanked the president for his service. “From a proud Jewish Zionist to a proud Irish American Zionist, I want to thank you for 50 years of public service and 50 years of support for the state of Israel,” Netanyahu told Biden at the start of their meeting. A U.S.-backed proposal to release remaining hostages in Gaza over three phases is something that would be a legacy-affirming achievement for Biden, who abandoned his reelection bid and endorsed Harris. It could also be a boon for Harris in her bid to succeed him. Following their talks, Biden and Netanyahu met with the families of American hostages. For Harris, the meeting with Netanyahu is an opportunity to demonstrate that she has the mettle to serve as commander in chief. She’s being scrutinized by those on the political left who say Biden hasn’t done enough to force Netanyahu to end the conflict and by Republicans looking to brand her as insufficient in her support for Israel. A senior administration official, who briefed reporters on the condition of anonymity under ground rules set by the White House, said there is “no daylight between the president and vice president” on Israel. Harris’ last one-on-one engagement with Netanyahu was in March 2021, but she’s taken part in more than 20 calls between Biden and Netanyahu. Netanyahu is trying to navigate his own delicate political moment. He faces pressure from the families of hostages demanding a cease-fire agreement to bring their loved ones home and from far-right members of his governing coalition who demand he resist any deal that could keep Israeli forces from eliminating Hamas. In his speech to a joint session of Congress on Wednesday, Netanyahu offered a robust defense of Israel’s conduct during its military offensive in Gaza and lashed out against accusations by the International Criminal Court of Israeli war crimes. He made the case that Israel, in its fight against Iran-backed Hamas, was effectively keeping “Americans boots off the ground while protecting our shared interests in the Middle East.” “Remember this: Our enemies are your enemies,” Netanyahu said. “Our fight, it’s your fight. And our victory will be your victory. ” Netanyahu used his speech to praise Biden for his administration’s support in the aftermath of the Oct. 7 attack. But he also noted action that Trump took during his four years in office that benefited Israel, including recognizing Israel’s sovereignty over the Golan Heights, confronting Iran’s aggression and moving the U.S Embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem. Netanyahu derided protesters who massed near the U.S. Capitol on Wednesday, calling them Iran’s “useful idiots.” Harris on Thursday said she was outraged that some protesters tagged areas near the U.S. Capitol with pro-Hamas graffiti, expressed support for the militants, and burned a U.S. flag at Union Station. “Pro-Hamas graffiti and rhetoric is abhorrent and we must not tolerate it in our nation,” Harris said in a statement. “I condemn the burning of the American flag. That flag is a symbol of our highest ideals as a nation and represents the promise of America. It should never be desecrated in that way.” Protesters massed near the White House on Thursday chanted, “Arrest Netanyahu,” and brought in an effigy of the prime minister with blood on its hands and wearing an orange jumpsuit. A small number of counter-protesters wore Israeli flags around their shoulders. Trump and his Republican allies criticized Harris, who had events in Indiana and Texas on Wednesday, for skipping Netanyahu’s address to Congress. The vice president is the president of the Senate and would typically co-preside over such an event with the House speaker, Republican Mike Johnson. White House officials said that her absence wasn’t a slight and was solely due to scheduling conflicts. Sen. JD Vance, the Republican vice presidential nominee, also skipped the speech to campaign. Biden, as vice president, skipped an address Netanyahu made to Congress in 2015. Harris has long spoken of her strong support for Israel. The first overseas trip of her Senate career in early 2017 was to Israel, and one of her first acts in office was to introduce a resolution opposing a U.N. Security Council resolution condemning Israel. She’s also spoken of her personal ties to Israel, including memories of raising money as a child to plant trees in Israel, installing a mezuzah near the front door of the vice president’s residence in Washington (her husband is Jewish) and her connections to pro-Israel groups including the conservative American Israel Public Affairs Committee and the liberal J Street. Harris has largely been in lockstep with Biden throughout the conflict, but at moments she’s been a front-runner for tougher Biden administration rhetoric on Israel.

And why didn’t she share the details with the American people? That last is the question nearly everyone has, according to a YouGov/Times of London poll of 1,170 registered voters. The July 22 to 23 survey was in the field after President Biden renounced his re-election campaign but before he offered a halting delivery of what was effectively a farewell speech Wednesday night from the Oval Office. A staggering 92% of respondents believe Harris knew at least a little bit about the president’s progressive deterioration, which became too much for even mainstream media to deny after his debate debacle against former President Donald Trump last month in Atlanta, though Biden’s issues have been discussed openly on the right since he took office in 2021. And of that vast majority charging Harris, a former prosecutor, with being part of a conspiracy to defraud the American people about the octogenarian’s obvious decline, most believe she knew a “great deal” about Biden’s issues — but chose not to say anything. Overall, 68% say she had ample knowledge of Biden’s deterioration, with 78% of Republicans, 73% of independents, and 82% of self-identified conservatives believing the VP was central to the coverup. Though more than two of every three voters think Harris essentially had complete knowledge of the president’s deterioration and chose not to divulge it, it’s not as if the rest of the respondents think otherwise. Indeed, an additional 17% of those surveyed believe the VP was “somewhat” involved in the concealment scheme and 7% at least “a little.” The one saving grace for Harris? Only 22% of Democrats, who look poised to nominate her for the presidency without the input of a single voter, think she knew a great deal about Biden’s issues. The left may be reluctant to assign its standard bearer complete culpability, but it doesn’t mean the rest of them are buying into the idea the president’s second in command didn’t have eyes to see what was happening to her boss over the years: 58% of Democrats and 64% of liberals allot her substantial blame at the least, and an additional 20% of Dems and 21% of liberals say she knew at least “a little” about Biden’s health and aging issues. While Dems are more willing to give her the benefit of the doubt, it only goes so far: Only a small number on the left (12% of Democrats and 7% of liberals) believe Harris knew nothing at all about the president’s problems. With Biden expected to stay in office for his term’s remainder, the right has already begun weaponizing voters’ perception of the VP’s deception. Donald Trump’s MAGA Inc. super PAC produced an ad this week that says Harris was in on the coverup, deliberately concealing “Joe’s obvious mental decline.” Expect more of this, especially if Biden continues to flash warning signs of a continued decline.","summary":"And why didn’t she share the details with the American people?","url":"https://nypost.com/2024/07/25/us-news/92-of-voters-blame-kamala-harris-for-biden-health-coverup-poll/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/07/newspress-collage-61e3ldgne-1721947423286.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&1721933068&w=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/Iy2YL9nc-RyIcpnTz.mp4","publish_date":"2024-07-25 22:51:25","author":"A.g.

It is not hard to evaluate this by looking at the monthly fiscal data. former President Trump was in office from January 2017 to January 2021, but it is only fair to evaluate until February 2020, when COVID-19 started to raise its head. It is not hard to freely retrieve the Federal receipts and outlays data from the U.S. Treasury. We will not normalize them by comparing them with GDP, for it is not directly controlled by the government. The result is interesting. In his first 2⅓ years of office (until May 2019), the year-over-year (YoY) growth of Federal receipts fluctuated narrowly between minus 3 percent and 3 percent. But after this, until just before the outburst of COVID-19, the growth rate shot up to over 6 percent. For Federal outlays, in his first two years or so (till March 2019), the growth was below but close to 5 percent. After that, it mainly fluctuated between 5 percent and 10 percent. The rationale behind this may somehow be attributed to economics: real GDP YoY growth in 2019 accelerated from 1.9 percent in Q1 to 3.2 percent in Q4. That is, we do not see any fiscal abnormality during the first 60 percent of former President Trump’s time in office. By contrast, in President Biden’s recent years in office, the situation was no better. We do not do YoY on numbers due to abnormal figures during the COVID-19 period and the corresponding abnormally high or low base effect afterward. Merely looking at the monthly deficits, the number has often been above 200 billion U.S. dollars over the past two years, when COVID-19’s impact should have been, by and large, gone. This was obviously higher than that during former President Trump’s time in office from 2017 to 2019. If the fiscal deficit is not so related to who is in office, is it then attributed to economics? Theoretically speaking, the answer should be yes. However, if we look at the data, the picture is somewhat less clear. The accompanying chart plots together the annual real GDP, Federal receipts, and outlays, all in YoY growth, and these can be traced to the beginning of the 20th century. Whenever there were World Wars or Great Depressions leading to sharp ups and downs, the correlations between GDP and receipts/outlays were clearer. For postwar to pre-COVID-19, however, the correlations were much lower. On the one hand, the boom-bust governs how much the government receives and the corresponding level that can be spent, but on the other hand, the practice of countercyclical fiscal policies offsets this positive correlation. Inflation is another long-cycle factor that retards deficits growth when inflation is high and vice versa. Having all these factors together in a framework, we should be able to model the fiscal. Given that the evidence of former President Trump being fiscally expansionary is unclear (as mentioned at the onset), there is no need to politicize the topic of fiscal (even of government), which is originally economic in nature and about income and expenditure.","summary":"There is a belief that if former President Donald Trump becomes the U.S. president again, then the fiscal situation will worsen.

U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Sean Lane had ruled on July 12 that Giuliani should be kicked out of bankruptcy over his failure to make required financial disclosures. But the decision did not immediately take effect, and Lane said in a Thursday court order that he was having second thoughts due to the former New York mayor’s refusal to reimburse creditors who hired investigative accountants to fill gaps in his financial reports. Ending the bankruptcy without taking care of those fees would essentially reward Giuliani for failing to make required financial disclosures, according to Lane. “There may come a point when dismissal is no longer an option,” Lane wrote. Giuliani, 80, filed for bankruptcy protection in December after a Washington, D.C., court ordered him to pay $148 million to two Georgia election workers who he falsely accused of rigging votes in the 2020 presidential election which was won by Democrat Joe Biden. There is no question that Giuliani owes the fees or that he has the ability to pay them – Giuliani’s apartments in New York and Florida are worth approximately $9 million, Lane wrote. Giuliani has “simply refused” to pay them, according to Lane. Lane ordered Giuliani and his creditors to suggest alternative paths forward by July 31. Once dismissed from bankruptcy, Giuliani’s creditors will be free to pursue lawsuits against him for defamation, sexual harassment and other claims stemming from Giuliani’s work for Trump, the former Republican president, as he sought to overturn his loss in the 2020 election. Despite the legal risks, Giuliani told Lane he preferred to end the bankruptcy rather than continue under more onerous court supervision proposed by his creditors. A committee appointed to represent Giuliani’s creditors had asked Lane to appoint a bankruptcy trustee to take over Giuliani’s finances and businesses. Giuliani’s most significant creditors, former election workers Wandrea “Shaye” and Ruby Freeman, had argued in favor of dismissal, which would allow them to seek payment on their $148 million defamation judgment against Giuliani. Giuliani’s attorneys had said that dismissing the case would also free Giuliani to appeal that judgment, which had forced him to seek bankruptcy protection. Lane said Thursday that he would consider appointing a bankruptcy trustee to oversee the sale of Giuliani’s $6.5 million New York apartment and pay the overdue fees from the proceeds of that sale. Lane said he may also require Giuliani to testify under oath about his finances before proceeding to dismiss the case.","summary":"NEW YORK >> A U.S. judge said Thursday that he may reverse course on ending Rudy Giuliani&#8217;s bankruptcy and instead keep Donald Trump&#8217;s former lawyer under Chapter 11 supervision until he pays about $350,000 in fees owed to his creditors.","url":"https://www.staradvertiser.com/2024/07/25/breaking-news/giuliani-remains-in-bankruptcy-limbo-over-unpaid-fees/","image":"https://www.staradvertiser.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/web1_2024-07-25T211645Z_3_LYNXMPEK6O11K_RTROPTP_3_USA-TRUMP-GIULIANI-BANKRUPTCY.JPG","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-07-25 22:45:00","author":"Reuters","authors":["Reuters"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.258},{"id":252642068,"title":"Netanyahu to meet with Biden and Harris at a critical time for both the US and Israel","text":"Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is set to make a long-awaited White House visit Thursday to meet with President Joe Biden and likely Democratic nominee Vice President Kamala Harris at an important moment for all three politicians. Netanyahu’s White House visit, his first since before President Donald Trump left office in 2020, comes at a time of growing pressure on all three to find an endgame to the nine-month war that’s left more than 39,000 dead in Gaza. Dozens of Israeli hostages are still languishing in Hamas captivity. Biden is pressing to get Israel and Hamas to seal his proposal to release remaining hostages in Gaza over three phases – something that would be a legacy-affirming achievement for the 81-year-old Democrat, who abandoned his reelection bid and endorsed Harris. It could also be a boon for Harris in her bid to succeed him. RELATED: Fact-checking Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s address to Congress White House officials say that the negotiations are in the closing stages but there are issues that need to be resolved. Following their midday talks, Biden and Netanyahu will meet the families of American hostages. Harris, who will meet separately with Netanyahu later, is trying to demonstrate that she has the mettle to serve as commander in chief. She’s being scrutinized by those on the political left who say Biden hasn’t done enough to force Netanyahu to end the war and by Republicans looking to brand her as insufficient in her support for Israel. A senior administration official, who briefed reporters on the condition of anonymity under ground rules set by the White House, said there is “no daylight between the president and vice president” on Israel. Harris’ last one-on-one engagement with Netanyahu was in March 2021, but she’s taken part in more than 20 calls between Biden and Netanyahu. Netanyahu, meanwhile, is trying to navigate his own delicate political moment. He faces pressure from the families of hostages demanding a cease-fire agreement to bring their loved ones home and from far-right members of his governing coalition who demand he resist any deal that could keep Israeli forces from eliminating Hamas. RELATED: Netanyahu calls on Congress to give bipartisan support of Israel Netanyahu, in a fiery address before a joint session of Congress on Wednesday, offered a robust defense of Israel’s conduct during the war and lashed out against accusations by the International Criminal Court of Israeli war crimes. He made the case that Israel, in its fight against Iran-backed Hamas, was effectively keeping “Americans boots off the ground while protecting our shared interests in the Middle East.” The Israeli leader spent scant time discussing the ongoing negotiations. “Remember this: Our enemies are your enemies,” Netanyahu told American lawmakers. “Our fight, it’s your fight. And our victory will be your victory. “ Netanyahu used his speech to praise Biden for his administration’s support in the aftermath of the Oct. 7 attack on Israel. But Netanyahu also went out of his way to note action that Trump took during his four years in office took that benefited Israel, including recognizing Israel’s sovereignty over the Golan Heights, confronting Iran’s aggression and moving the U.S Embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem. Netanyahu is set to travel to Florida on Friday to meet with Trump. Netanyahu also slammed protesters who massed near the U.S. Capitol on Wednesday, calling them Iran’s “useful idiots.” The Secret Service beefed up security at the White House ahead of Netanyahu’s visit, erecting additional fencing and barriers near the White House campus. Harris on Thursday said she was outraged that some protesters tagged areas near the U.S. Capitol with pro-Hamas graffiti, expressed support for the militants and burned a U.S. flag at Union Station. “Pro-Hamas graffiti and rhetoric is abhorrent and we must not tolerate it in our nation,” Harris said in a statement. “I condemn the burning of the American flag. That flag is a symbol of our highest ideals as a nation and represents the promise of America. It should never be desecrated in that way.” Trump and his Republican allies criticized Harris, who had events in Indiana and Texas on Wednesday, for skipping Netanyahu’s address to Congress. The vice president is the presiding officer of the Senate and would typically co-preside over such an event with the House speaker, Republican Mike Johnson. But there have been other instances in recent history when the vice president has skipped such addresses. Biden, as vice president, skipped an address Netanyahu made to Congress in 2015. Harris “should be here whether she likes the prime minister of Israel or not, whether she respects him or not, she should be here,” said Iowa Sen. Joni Ernst, who organized a news conference with fellow Senate Republicans that largely focused on Harris’ absence from the speech. “It is a disgrace.” White House officials said that her absence wasn’t a slight and was solely due to scheduling conflicts. Harris spoke on Wednesday to the historically Black sorority Zeta Phi Beta before flying to Houston ahead of an address to the American Federation of Teachers on Thursday. Sen. JD Vance, the Republican vice presidential nominee, also skipped the speech to campaign. “The vice president has been unwavering in her commitment to the security of Israel,” White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said. Harris has long spoken of her strong support for Israel. The first overseas trip of her Senate career in early 2017 was to Israel, and one of her first acts in office was to introduce a resolution opposing a U.N. Security Council resolution condemning Israel. She’s also spoken of her personal ties to Israel, including memories of raising money as a child to plant trees in Israel, installing a mezuzah near the front door of the vice president’s residence in Washington (her husband is Jewish) and her connections to pro-Israel groups including the conservative American Israel Public Affairs Committee and the liberal J Street. Harris has largely been in lockstep with Biden throughout the conflict, but at moments she’s been a front-runner for tougher Biden administration rhetoric on Israel. She used a high-profile address in March in Selma, Alabama, a day before she met with Netanyahu rival and Israeli war cabinet member Benny Gantz to decry Palestinians “starving” in the face of “inhumane” conditions and to urge Israel to do more to alleviate civilian suffering in Gaza.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is set to make a long-awaited White&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Netanyahu to meet with Biden and Harris at a critical time for both the US and Israel first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/news/us/netanyahu-to-meet-with-biden-and-harris-at-a-critical-time-for-both-the-us-and-israel/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/ic_launcher.png","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-07-25 22:44:10","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.049},{"id":252642794,"title":"Trump Urges Netanyahu to End War in Gaza Ahead of Friday Meeting","text":"Republicans in Congress applauded often when Israel’s prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, spoke at the Capitol on Wednesday. But the Republican nominee for president, Donald J. Trump, appeared less impressed with Israel’s messaging the next day. Israel must end the war in Gaza “and get it done quickly,” Mr. Trump said in an interview on Fox News on Thursday. He argued that Israel was “getting decimated” by negative publicity over its conduct of the war, set off by the Oct. 7 Hamas-led attack on Israel. Since then, more than 39,000 Palestinians have been killed, according to Gazan health authorities, and the war has wreaked widespread disease, hunger and destruction. “Israel is not very good at public relations,” Mr. Trump said. The comments came a day before a scheduled meeting on Friday between the former president and Mr. Netanyahu at Mar-a-Lago, Mr. Trump’s private residence and club in Palm Beach, Fla. But it is not clear that the Israeli prime minister — who praised the former president in his congressional address — would agree with Mr. Trump about wrapping up the conflict. In his speech to U.S. lawmakers, Mr. Netanyahu vowed that Israel would fight until Hamas was eradicated. He did not say what many Israelis, especially the relatives of hostages in Gaza, wanted to hear: that he would close a cease-fire deal with Hamas to end the war and return about 115 people taken from Israel on Oct. 7 who remain in Gaza, several dozen of whom are believed to be dead.","summary":"The Israeli leader is scheduled to visit Mar-a-Lago in Florida before he returns home.","url":"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/25/world/middleeast/trump-netanyahu-israel-gaza.html","image":"https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/07/25/multimedia/25mideast-crisis-Trump-vjwk/25mideast-crisis-Trump-vjwk-facebookJumbo.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-07-25 22:41:56","author":"Ephrat Livni","authors":["Ephrat Livni"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.224},{"id":252641932,"title":"Russia and China’s joint Alaska flight was a test for lame-duck Biden","text":"You’d be forgiven if you thought that a staged scene out of Norman Jewison’s classic comedy “The Russians Are Coming, the Russians are Coming” was playing out high in the skies near Alaska this week. On Wednesday, the Russians did come — intentionally — just ahead of President Biden’s Oval Office speech explaining why he abruptly stepped down from his re-election campaign against former President Donald Trump. And the Russians brought Chinese bombers along with them for good measure. Shortly before Biden’s evening address to the nation, NORAD reported that US and Canadian fighter jets had “intercepted two Russian TU-95 and two PRC H-6 military aircraft operating in the Alaska Air Defense Identification Zone.” Message received, loud and clear: Beijing and Moscow are signaling they believe no one is fully in charge at the White House. Russia and China are sensing a vacuum at the West Wing as power begins to transition from Biden to Vice President Kamala Harris, now said to be essentially acting as a co-president in all but name. Biden’s stilted exit speech only reinforced that notion. And given that the country’s national-security interests in Europe, Africa, the Middle East and the Indo-Pacific are increasingly under kinetic attack, a rudderless White House is not a good thing. In failing to explain why he couldn’t beat Trump in a rematch, Biden also failed to stand down Vladimir Putin and Xi Jinping. Instead, they are likely preparing to take advantage of Biden’s Democratic Party-imposed lame-duck status. Wednesday was emblematic of the strategic openings Biden and Harris are presenting to Moscow and Beijing (as well as their Axis of Evil allies), as they essentially went AWOL in Washington. Biden set the tone by postponing his meeting with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu — and Harris followed on by electing not to preside over Bibi’s joint address to Congress. Both were the wrong messages to send to Russia and China — and exactly the wrong kind of strategic greenlighting that it effectively sent to Hamas, Hezbollah and their Iranian sponsors as they wage a widening war against Israel. Netanyahu’s address to Congress was his first public speech to American lawmakers since Oct. 7. Forty-five Americans were killed in that terrorist attack. Eight US citizens are still being held hostage by Hamas in the Gaza Strip. The Israeli leader even brought American family members of the hostages to the House chamber. Harris’ excuse? She chose not to stand with Israel at the joint session because she opted to make a campaign address at a Zeta Phi Beta sorority gathering. But that was just an excuse to get out of Dodge and curry electoral favor with the progressive wing of the Democratic Party — at the direct expense of America’s closest ally in the Middle East. Hamas’ useful idiots in Washington, DC, got the message as well. During Netanyahu’s address, they assaulted Capitol Police officers, vandalized monuments and federal buildings, burned American flags at Union Station and defaced a replica Liberty Bell with anti-Israel and antisemitic graffiti — all on Biden and Harris’ watch. Is this really what defending democracy looks like? Biden and Harris chose to essentially abandon Washington, leaving it to the pro-Palestinian mob — and in so doing gave an open invitation to our nation’s enemies to trample on US national-security interests in the Mideast and elsewhere. November politics are endangering Americans, our troops and our allies, while Iran is waging a multi-pronged war against Israel and aggressively working to weaponize its nuclear program. This cannot continue: Moscow, Beijing, Tehran and Pyongyang will not be deterred unless they know someone is in control at the White House. At present, that isn’t clear. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin and national security adviser Jake Sullivan are gone if Harris wins, according to reports — with Phillip Gordon, the veep’s current national-security chief and a former Obama administration official who helped negotiate the 2015 Iran nuclear deal, widely expected take the leading role. Since Austin and Sullivan are likely lame ducks, are they already ceding policy decisions to Harris and Gordon? Or is Biden nominally still in charge? Likely not. Strategic ambiguity has its value — up to a point. We perilously crossed that threshold on Wednesday when Russian and Chinese bombers told us in Alaska that they were seeing through it.

In a filing arguing against Trump’s bid to dismiss the indictment and guilty verdict on 34 felony counts, prosecutors from Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg’s office said the Supreme Court’s ruling in the federal election interference case against Trump “has nothing to say about defendant’s conviction” in its case. “At issue in the Supreme Court’s decision was whether defendant could be federally prosecuted ‘for conduct alleged to involve official acts during his tenure in office.’ The criminal charges here, by contrast, exclusively stem from defendant’s ‘unofficial acts’ — conduct for which ‘there is no immunity,’” the DA’s filing said. Further, “the evidence that he claims is affected by the Supreme Court’s ruling constitutes only a sliver of the mountains of testimony and documentary proof that the jury considered in finding him guilty of all 34 felony charges beyond a reasonable doubt,” the DA argued. Attorneys for the former president argued earlier this month that the high court’s decision, issued July 1, had implications for his conviction in the weekslong hush money trial, citing several examples of what they described as “impermissible official-acts evidence” introduced at trial that under the Supreme Court’s new ruling cannot be introduced because they touched on “core” presidential duties. They contended testimony about his private conversations with former White House Communications Director Hope Hicks, discussions around his pardon power, as well as the use of his presidential posts on Twitter were all wrongly admitted, and as a result, Trump should be entitled to a new trial — or more. “In order to vindicate the Presidential immunity doctrine, and protect the interests implicated by its underpinnings, the jury’s verdicts must be vacated and the Indictment dismissed,” the filing said. Trump attorney Todd Blanche declined comment on the DA’s new filing, but he submitted a letter to Judge Juan Merchan asking for permission to respond to the DA’s “legal and factual misrepresentations.” Merchan is expected to rule on the issue by Sept. 6. Trump was initially scheduled to be sentenced in the case on July 11, but the judge delayed the sentencing until at least Sept. 18 in order to consider Trump’s arguments. Trump was convicted on all counts against him in May, the first time a former president has ever been convicted of criminal charges. If the sentencing goes forward, he faces penalties ranging from a fine to four years in prison per count. Prosecutors alleged Trump falsified business records related to a hush money payment his former lawyer Michael Cohen made to adult film star Stormy Daniels in the final weeks of the 2016 presidential election. Trump has denied any wrongdoing.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nA Supreme Court decision on Donald Trump’s immunity for “official acts” while&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Alvin Bragg, Manhattan&#8217;s District Attorney, asks judge to uphold Trump&#8217;s conviction first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/news/us/alvin-bragg-manhattans-district-attorney-asks-judge-to-uphold-trumps-conviction/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/rewrite-this-title-Manhattan-DA-Alvin-Bragg-urges-judge-not.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-07-25 22:38:31","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.264},{"id":252641578,"title":"Bryson DeChambeau: It was an ‘honor’ to golf, make YouTube video with Donald Trump","text":"The invitation is open. Bryson DeChambeau, the two-time U.S. Open winner, said he would be “more than willing” to have a Democrat on his “Break 50” YouTube video series after former President Donald Trump appeared in an episode that debuted on Tuesday. The golfer also called it an “honor” to play with the former president and described the “content piece” as a way to produce something unique on the video-sharing platform. DeChambeau has maintained that the collaboration with the 45th President and current Republican presidential nominee was not about politics and that the invitation is out there if anyone on the Democratic side wanted to join him on the links. “I’m more than willing to play with them. I have no issues whatsoever,” DeChambeau said Thursday ahead of this week’s LIV Golf UK event at JCB Golf & Country Club. “I think that’s the thing about golf, the more we can utilize golf to bring everyone together in a cool way that’s the vision of the global game of golf. It’s important for me inspiring a younger generation is huge for me and that’s why this YouTube space is so cool, ’cause it really shows people’s true sides. “I think that’s what I’m trying to accomplish and it’s definitely helped me in that regard and I can’t wait to hopefully do it with others.” The 30-year-old said his team also “asked the other side,” though it’s unclear if that meant President Joe Biden or another high-profile Democrat. The video with Trump already has nearly 7 million views on YouTube and helped DeChambeau’s already popular channel grow exponentially as the “Break 50” episode trended as the top video on the platform after it was released Tuesday morning. The concept of DeChambeau’s video series is to try and shoot a round in fewer than 50 strokes with a partner, with previous episodes including Sergio Garcia and Paige Spiranac as guests. The video with Trump was filmed at Trump Bedminster in New Jersey, and the duo managed to finish at exactly 50 from the red tees at the course. The episode was filmed on July 6 prior to the assassination attempt on Trump a week later during a rally in Pennsylvania. It was released two days after Biden announced that he would not seek re-election for a second term in the White House. DeChambeau told reporters that it took a little bit of time to set up and that it was “a lot of fun to do.” The LIV star also called Trump a “pretty good golfer.” The video largely remained apolitical — though there was one swipe at the current commander in chief about his golf game — with the conversation focusing on golf and some of the former president’s musical preferences.","summary":"Bryson DeChambeau, the two-time U.S. Open winner, said he would be “more than willing” to have a Democrat on his “Break 50” YouTube video series.","url":"https://nypost.com/2024/07/25/sports/bryson-dechambeau-it-was-an-honor-to-golf-with-donald-trump/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/07/newspress-collage-bdp5760kp-1721945347349.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&1721930984&w=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-07-25 22:31:13","author":"Christian Arnold","authors":["Christian Arnold"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.279},{"id":252642030,"title":"Opinion: Samantha Bee: These Republicans’ Attacks on Kamala Harris Are Delightful Flops","text":"One of the more unexpected joys of the past week has been the extent to which Republicans and right wing media outlets seem lost, wandering through the forest, trying to find the perfect phrasing to properly denigrate Kamala Harris.

The US Supreme Court’s recent ruling immunizing presidents’ “official acts” has “no bearing” on the case in which jurors found Trump guilty of lying on company records about reimbursing his fixer Michael Cohen for a $130,000 payoff made to Stormy Daniels before the 2016 election, the Manhattan District Attorney’s office wrote. The first-ever criminal prosecution of a former president “exclusively” stemmed from “unofficial acts” like Trump, 78, ordering Cohen to pay off Daniels – who testified about having a brief tryst with a married Trump in 2006 – to hide a sex scandal from voters, according to Manhattan DA Alvin Bragg. Trump’s lawyers have argued that Justice Juan Merchan should toss the guilty verdict because the trial was “tainted” by evidence that the jury should have never heard based on the Supreme Court’s ruling. The GOP 2024 presidential nominee told his White House communications director Hope Hicks, for example, that “it was better” that Daniels’ lurid tale of sex with Trump was revealed in 2018 rather than before the 2016 election, Hicks testified. That conversation should be considered “official conduct” that can’t be used against a president in a criminal case, according to Trump’s lawyers. The DA’s office countered Thursday that Hicks’ testimony was “personal” in nature and not an “official” presidential action. But even if Manhattan jurors never heard that conversation and other challenged evidence from Trump’s White House stint, such evidence “constitutes only a sliver of the mountains of testimony and documentary proof” that jurors used to convict Trump on 34 counts of felony falsifying business records, prosecutors wrote. “Under these circumstances, there is no basis for disturbing the jury’s verdict, and defendant’s motion should be denied,” Bragg’s office added. Prosecutors also urged Merchan to find that the evidence in question relatively “harmless” to the overall case, and to agree with a federal judge’s July 2023 ruling that, “Hush money paid to an adult film star is not related to a president’s official acts.” Merchan delayed Trump’s sentencing date from July 11 to Sept. 18 to hear from both sides on the presidential immunity issue, and said he’ll decide by Sept. 6. whether to scuttle the historic verdict. If the sentencing does happen as planned, Trump faces up to four years in prison, though legal experts told The Post that he’s more likely to get probation or community service. Trump has denied having sex with Daniels, but chose not to testify at the trial. He’s repeatedly claimed that the case brought by Bragg — an elected Democrat in a borough Trump lost in landslides in 2016 and 2020 — is a politically motivated plot to hurt his 2024 campaign.","summary":"Donald Trump does not have presidential immunity for covering up a payoff to a porn star from the Oval Office – and his hush money conviction should stand, Manhattan prosecutors argued Thursday. ","url":"https://nypost.com/2024/07/25/us-news/trumps-hush-money-verdict-should-stand-because-porn-star-payoff-not-official-act-da/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/07/combination-photo-shows-adult-film-83129435.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/i3Kxmc2N-RyIcpnTz.mp4","publish_date":"2024-07-25 22:27:12","author":"Ben Kochman","authors":["Ben Kochman"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.253},{"id":252641424,"title":"The week in whoppers: WaPo heartlessly slams Hamas hostages’ parents, NY Times gaslights on Biden’s bailout and more","text":"Diary of disturbing disinformation and dangerous delusions This tweet: We say: What kind of sick mind slams the parents of a 22-year-old kid held hostage by Hamas terrorists for 10 months?

This claim: “The president has placed the national interest above his own pride and ambition.” — NY Times editorial, Sunday We say: What a distortion! President Biden didn’t act in “the national interest” by dropping his reelection bid; Democratic bigwigs had to drag him kicking and screaming. Indeed, some sources say they purposely let him debate Donald Trump to show the world how impaired he is — and then threatened to invoke the 25th Amendment to force him out. If Biden truly cared about the national interest, he wouldn’t have run at all this year. Dems could’ve then held primaries to let actual voters decide who’d replace him, rather than the party’s elite.

Yes, Donald Trump wants to deport millions of migrants; they broke the law by crossing the border illegally and have no right to be here. Yet victims at Nazi concentration camps (the sites suggested by Scientific American’s wacky headline) broke no laws. And they were used as slaves and executed. Trump merely wants to deport folks who shouldn’t be here, are costing US citizens billions, competing for their jobs and bringing drugs, crime and possible terrorism to US soil. Can any comparison be more warped? Spot the difference: “Harris, appointed by Biden as border czar, said . . .” — Axios, April 14, 2021 vs. We say: Axios is bashing Team Trump for calling Kamala Harris “border czar.” Hmm: Wonder where they got that idea. Maybe from Axios itself, which, like most outlets, used the term to describe her in 2021. Now she’s the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee, having failed miserably to control the border, so media like Axios are pretending she had nothing at all to do with Team Biden’s border disaster.

Why did the AG fight freedom?","text":"ST. LOUIS (AP) — A man who was on the verge of walking out of prison this week after a judge found evidence of “actual innocence” and overturned his murder conviction now faces a fresh legal hurdle. The person blocking Christopher Dunn’s freedom is Missouri Attorney General Andrew Bailey, who is fresh off an unsuccessful battle to keep another woman whose murder conviction was reversed imprisoned. Political scientists say Bailey’s efforts are a way to appear tough on crime and shore up votes in advance of a tough primary race. Judges and defense attorneys are voicing frustration. “His actions are causing undue harm to this innocent individual and is a stain on our legal system,” Michael Heiskell, president of the National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers, said when asked about Bailey’s opposition to Dunn’s release. Here are some things to know: Who is Christopher Dunn? Dunn, who is Black, was 18 in 1990 when 15-year-old Ricco Rogers was killed. Among the key evidence used to convict him of first-degree murder was testimony from two boys who were at the scene of the shooting. Both later recanted their testimony, saying they had been coerced by police and prosecutors. Judge Jason Sengheiser on Monday overturned the murder conviction of the now 52-year-old and ordered his immediate release. Bailey’s office appealed, and prison officials declined to release Dunn. Sengheiser then held an emergency hearing Wednesday and threatened to hold the warden in contempt if he didn’t free Dunn within hours. Dunn was signing papers, preparing to walk out the door, when the Missouri Supreme Court agreed to consider Bailey’s objections and halted his release, a corrections department spokesperson said. “That is not justice,” the Midwest Innocence Project, which is representing Dunn, said in a statement. Bailey’s spokesperson has declined repeated email and text requests for comments. On Wednesday, she provided a link to the order halting Dunn’s release. Dunn’s case marks the second “actual innocence” ruling in the state in recent weeks. Sandra Hemme, now 64, spent 43 years in prison for the fatal 1980 stabbing of a library worker before a judge overturned her conviction. Appeals by Bailey — all the way up to the Missouri Supreme Court — kept Hemme imprisoned at the Chillicothe Correctional Center for more than a month after that initial ruling. During a court hearing last Friday, Judge Ryan Horsman scolded an attorney in Bailey’s office for telling the warden not to release Hemme on her own recognizance pending an appellate court review. “To call someone and tell them to disregard a court order is wrong,” Horsman said. He said that if Hemme wasn’t released within hours, Bailey himself would have to appear in court with contempt of court on the table. Hemme, whose attorneys with the Innocence Project described her as the longest held wrongly incarcerated woman known in the U.S., was released later that day. “The court has to be obeyed,” said Michael Wolff, a former Missouri Supreme Court judge and chief justice. Bailey’s opposition to innocence claims A Missouri law adopted in 2021 lets prosecutors request hearings when they see evidence of a wrongful conviction. The law was passed after another judge, William Hickle, found in 2020 that a jury would likely find Dunn not guilty based on new evidence. But Hickle declined to order Dunn’s release, citing a 2016 Missouri Supreme Court ruling that only people on death row could make a “freestanding” claim of actual innocence. In 2023, Bailey opposed the release of Lamar Johnson, who spent 28 years in prison for murder. Another St. Louis judge overturned Johnson’s conviction, and he was freed. Stakes are even higher for a hearing next month. St. Louis County’s prosecutor believes DNA evidence shows that Marcellus Williams didn’t commit the crime that landed him on death row. DNA of someone else — but not Williams — was found on the knife used in the 1998 killing, experts said. A hearing on Williams’ innocence claim begins Aug. 21. His execution is scheduled for Sept. 24. Bailey’s office is opposing the challenge to Williams’ conviction, too. Bailey’s appointment as attorney general When Eric Schmitt was elected to the U.S. Senate in November 2022, Republican Gov. Mike Parson appointed Bailey, who at the time was serving as the governor’s lawyer, as Schmitt’s replacement. Bailey’s first election test comes in next month’s primary. Ken Warren, a professor emeritus of political science at Saint Louis University, said fighting the release of people in custody advances Bailey’s agenda. “This will only help him with his base,” he said. Bailey’s opponent, Will Scharf, a former federal prosecutor who recently served as an attorney for former President Donald Trump, has been attacking Bailey as liberal, said Steven Puro, professor emeritus of political science of St. Louis University. Puro said Bailey is balancing the need to look tough while avoiding being perceived as uncaring and not obeying the law. “Most other prosecutors have thought the risk was not worth the reward,” Puro said. Bailey’s use of the courts Since taking office, Bailey has sued Planned Parenthood and President Joe Biden, tried to force clinics that provide gender-affirming care to hand over their records, and pushed a liberal prosecutor to resign. When debate over transgender minors’ access to gender-affirming health care reached a fever pitch in Missouri in 2023, Bailey tried to restrict access to both minors and adults by regulation — a move typically reserved for the state’s health department. He later pulled the rule amid legal battles and action from the Legislature. Most recently, Bailey sued the state of New York over its prosecution of Trump, arguing that Trump’s conviction constitutes election interference. Richard Serafini, a former federal prosecutor now in private practice, called the lawsuit against New York “one of the silliest things that I think I’ve ever heard of in the practice of law.” And Lindsay Runnels, an attorney who serves on the board of the Midwest Innocence Project, questioned the fight to free people once judges have ruled. “The system doesn’t work if our highest law enforcement officer in the state flouts the court system and believes that they are not accountable to them for their orders and following orders,” she said. “It’s insane.” ___ Summer Ballentine contributed to this report from Columbia, Missouri.

Speaking to Al Jazeera near the Capitol, Matthews said, “I just think it’s terrible when the majority of the world is looking at this man and what he’s doing in Gaza, and then also what he’s overseeing in the West Bank and East Jerusalem, that we’re welcoming into the so-called sacred halls of our government.” “This has been an ongoing struggle for people that just want to have dignity and be able to live independent lives and dream of a better future,” he continued in support of Palestinians during the on-camera interview, which showed other protesters milling behind him. “This man is the pinnacle of the obstacle toward that freedom and that we have him visiting the country is obscene. It’s a disgusting show of support for someone that doesn’t deserve our support. “I’m ashamed that my tax dollars are going to the brutalizing of an entire people,” Matthews added. “It’s shameful. And I’m ashamed that our government is welcoming him here.” According to The Associated Press, thousands were present Wednesday to protest Netanyahu’s visit and call for an end to U.S. aid to Israel amid the country’s ongoing war against Hamas, which has claimed more than 39,000 Palestinian lives. The conflict began after the Palestinian terrorist group killed 1,200 people and took about 250 hostages in its Oct. 7 attacks on Israel. Police deployed pepper spray into the crowd on Wednesday after some protesters became “violent” and “failed to obey” orders to move back, according to authorities. Nine people were arrested in D.C., including four who were charged with assaulting an officer outside Union Station. At one point, some demonstrators attempted to block Netanyahu’s route to the Capitol but were removed from the street by police. Once inside, the prime minister called the protesters “idiots” and said that Israel intends to “fight until we achieve victory,” per CNN. The following day, Netanyahu met separately with President Joe Biden and Vice President/presumptive 2024 Democratic nominee Kamala Harris at the White House, where the leaders reportedly negotiated a ceasefire deal. On Friday, Netanyahu plans to meet with former president Donald Trump in Florida.

Dunn’s case marks the second “actual innocence” ruling in the state in recent weeks. Sandra Hemme, now 64, spent 43 years in prison for the fatal 1980 stabbing of a library worker before a judge overturned her conviction. Appeals by Bailey — all the way up to the Missouri Supreme Court — kept Hemme imprisoned at the Chillicothe Correctional Center for more than a month after that initial ruling. During a court hearing last Friday, Judge Ryan Horsman scolded an attorney in Bailey’s office for telling the warden not to release Hemme on her own recognizance pending an appellate court review. “To call someone and tell them to disregard a court order is wrong,” Horsman said. He said that if Hemme wasn’t released within hours, Bailey himself would have to appear in court with contempt of court on the table. Hemme, whose attorneys with the Innocence Project described her as the longest held wrongly incarcerated woman known in the U.S., was released later that day. “The court has to be obeyed,” said Michael Wolff, a former Missouri Supreme Court judge and chief justice. Bailey’s opposition to innocence claims A Missouri law adopted in 2021 lets prosecutors request hearings when they see evidence of a wrongful conviction. The law was passed after another judge, William Hickle, found in 2020 that a jury would likely find Dunn not guilty based on new evidence. But Hickle declined to order Dunn’s release, citing a 2016 Missouri Supreme Court ruling that only people on death row could make a “freestanding” claim of actual innocence. In 2023, Bailey opposed the release of Lamar Johnson, who spent 28 years in prison for murder. Another St. Louis judge overturned Johnson’s conviction, and he was freed. Stakes are even higher for a hearing next month. St. Louis County’s prosecutor believes DNA evidence shows that Marcellus Williams didn’t commit the crime that landed him on death row. DNA of someone else — but not Williams — was found on the knife used in the 1998 killing, experts said. A hearing on Williams’ innocence claim begins Aug. 21. His execution is scheduled for Sept. 24. Bailey’s office is opposing the challenge to Williams’ conviction, too. Bailey’s appointment as attorney general When Eric Schmitt was elected to the U.S. Senate in November 2022, Republican Gov. Mike Parson appointed Bailey, who at the time was serving as the governor’s lawyer, as Schmitt’s replacement. Bailey’s first election test comes in next month’s primary. Ken Warren, a professor emeritus of political science at Saint Louis University, said fighting the release of people in custody advances Bailey’s agenda. “This will only help him with his base,” he said. Bailey’s opponent, Will Scharf, a former federal prosecutor who recently served as an attorney for former President Donald Trump, has been attacking Bailey as liberal, said Steven Puro, professor emeritus of political science of St. Louis University. Puro said Bailey is balancing the need to look tough while avoiding being perceived as uncaring and not obeying the law. “Most other prosecutors have thought the risk was not worth the reward,” Puro said. Bailey’s use of the courts Since taking office, Bailey has sued Planned Parenthood and President Joe Biden, tried to force clinics that provide gender-affirming care to hand over their records, and pushed a liberal prosecutor to resign. When debate over transgender minors’ access to gender-affirming health care reached a fever pitch in Missouri in 2023, Bailey tried to restrict access to both minors and adults by regulation — a move typically reserved for the state’s health department. He later pulled the rule amid legal battles and action from the Legislature. Most recently, Bailey sued the state of New York over its prosecution of Trump, arguing that Trump’s conviction constitutes election interference. Richard Serafini, a former federal prosecutor now in private practice, called the lawsuit against New York “one of the silliest things that I think I’ve ever heard of in the practice of law.” And Lindsay Runnels, an attorney who serves on the board of the Midwest Innocence Project, questioned the fight to free people once judges have ruled. “The system doesn’t work if our highest law enforcement officer in the state flouts the court system and believes that they are not accountable to them for their orders and following orders,” she said. “It’s insane.” ___ Summer Ballentine contributed to this report from Columbia, Missouri.

LOUIS (AP) — A man who was on the verge of walking out of prison this week after a judge found evidence of “actual innocence” and overturned his murder conviction now faces a fresh legal hurdle. The person blocking Christopher Dunn’s freedom is Missouri Attorney General Andrew Bailey, who is fresh off an unsuccessful battle to keep another woman whose murder conviction was reversed imprisoned. Political scientists say Bailey’s efforts are a way to appear tough on crime and shore up votes in advance of a tough primary race. Judges and defense attorneys are voicing frustration. “His actions are causing undue harm to this innocent individual and is a stain on our legal system,” Michael Heiskell, president of the National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers, said when asked about Bailey’s opposition to Dunn’s release. Here are some things to know: Who is Christopher Dunn? Dunn, who is Black, was 18 in 1990 when 15-year-old Ricco Rogers was killed. Among the key evidence used to convict him of first-degree murder was testimony from two boys who were at the scene of the shooting. Both later recanted their testimony, saying they had been coerced by police and prosecutors. Judge Jason Sengheiser on Monday overturned the murder conviction of the now 52-year-old and ordered his immediate release. Bailey’s office appealed, and prison officials declined to release Dunn. Sengheiser then held an emergency hearing Wednesday and threatened to hold the warden in contempt if he didn’t free Dunn within hours. Dunn was signing papers, preparing to walk out the door, when the Missouri Supreme Court agreed to consider Bailey’s objections and halted his release, a corrections department spokesperson said. “That is not justice,” the Midwest Innocence Project, which is representing Dunn, said in a statement.

JD Vance — over his remarks about people who haven’t borne children. The Emmy winning “Friends” star on Wednesday shared her disbelief over a resurfaced clip of the GOP nominee for vice president, who in 2021 likened Democrats like Vice President Kamala Harris to “childless cat ladies who are miserable at their own lives and the choices that they’ve made.” Vance said, “They want to make the rest of the country miserable too.” Posting a tweet about the clip on her Instagram story, the actor wrote: “I truly can’t believe this is coming from a potential VP of The United States.” “The Morning Show” star, who opened up about her infertility struggles in 2022, then directed her comments to Vance himself while alluding to the Republican Party’s support of personhood laws that would affect access to abortion, in vitro fertilization procedures and certain types of contraception. “All I can say is… Mr. Vance, I pray that your daughter is fortunate enough to bear children of her own one day,” she wrote. “I hope she will not need to turn to IVF as a second option. Because you are trying to take that away from her, too.” Representatives for Aniston did not immediately respond today to The Times’ request for comment. The senator from Ohio, 39, was a candidate for the U.S. Congress when he made the remarks in 2021 on former Fox News host Tucker Carlson’s show, but the clip has made the rounds on social media recently in the wake of Trump tapping his onetime critic as his VP pick at the Republican National Convention last week. “It’s just a basic fact — you look at Kamala Harris, Pete Buttigieg, AOC — the entire future of the Democrats is controlled by people without children. And how does it make any sense that we’ve turned our country over to people who don’t really have a direct stake in it?” Vance told Carlson. After taking aim at Vance, Aniston, 55, appeared to endorse Harris, who stepped into the race Sunday after President Joe Biden heeded widespread calls to drop out of the election. She reposted a 2018 video from fellow actor Allison Janney showing the former prosecutor and senator grilling Justice Brett Kavanaugh, then a Supreme Court nominee, on abortion rights. In a 2022 interview, Aniston provided rare insight into her attempts at parenthood and how the media scrutinized her about not having children during her high-profile marriages to Brad Pitt and Justin Theroux. “I was trying to get pregnant. It was a challenging road for me, the baby-making road,” she told Allure. “All the years and years and years of speculation. … It was really hard. I was going through IVF, drinking Chinese teas, you name it. I was throwing everything at it. I would’ve given anything if someone had said to me, ‘Freeze your eggs. Do yourself a favor.’ You just don’t think it. So here I am today. The ship has sailed.” Aniston said that the media painfully branded her as “selfish” and someone who “just cared about her career.” “God forbid a woman is successful and doesn’t have a child,” she said. “And the reason my husband left me, why we broke up and ended our marriage, was because I wouldn’t give him a kid. It was absolute lies.” Meanwhile, Harris’ stepdaughter Ella Emhoff and Ella’s mother, Kerstin Emhoff, came to Harris’ defense. Ella Emhoff posted a statement her mother had given to CNN on her Instagram story on Thursday. In it, Kerstin Emhoff called the “childless” claims against Harris “baseless” and praised Harris as a “co-parent” to her two children with second gentleman Doug Emhoff. “She is loving, nurturing, fiercely protective, and always present,” the statement said. Ella Emhoff added: “How can you be ‘childless’ when you have cutie pie kids like cole and I. kemhoff say it louder for the people in the back… I love my three parents.”","summary":"Jennifer Aniston has entered the 2024 election news cycle to call out former President Donald Trump&#8217;s running mate &#8212; &#8220;Hillbilly Elegy&#8221; author and Ohio Sen.

In a 69-page filing, Bragg and his team of prosecutors painstakingly laid out how former President Donald Trump being granted broad criminal immunity for official acts by SCOTUS doesn't change his late May conviction by a New York jury. Bragg argued that the crimes Trump committed in the lead-up to the 2016 presidential election are not tied to any official acts he took as president, and that no evidence prosecutors introduced ran significantly afoul of SCOTUS' immunity boundaries laid out in the Trump v. United States decision. Bragg referred to a practice known as \"harmless-error analysis\" in which a criminal conviction can still be upheld despite a \"harmless error\" by a judge overseeing a criminal trial if that error is not rooted in bias or not significant enough to merit a reversal — like the admission of evidence later found to be admitted erroneously. A harmless error is different than a reversible error, as a reversible error requires a conviction be overturned while a harmless error does not. READ MORE: 'Not very difficult': Former federal prosecutor explains how Alvin Bragg can convict Trump \"Like New York's courts, the U.S. Supreme Court 'repeatedly has held' that 'errors such as mistaken admission of evidence' are not 'immune from harmless-error analysis,'\" Bragg wrote. \"And, as particularly relevant here, the Supreme Court has applied harmless-error review even when the improperly admitted evidence involved 'conduct that was not criminal when the defendant engaged in that conduct.'\" \"If a reviewing court can determine whether it was harmless to introduce evidence of conduct for which a defendant could not have been prosecuted because it was not a crime, then the same must be true for evidence of conduct for which a defendant could not have been prosecuted because of immunity,\" he continued. \"Under both New York and federal law, harmless-error analysis is unavailable for only extremely narrow categories of errors—none of which include the erroneous introduction of evidence.\" It's unclear how Judge Juan Merchan will rule given that the evidence compiled by the grand jury that led to Trump's indictment is still under seal, according to Business Insider legal correspondent Jacob Shamsian. While he opined that the harmless-error analysis could \"cinch\" Bragg's case that the convictions should be upheld, the fact that the evidence has not been made public remains a wild card. \"[W]e can't evaluate whether it would have violated the Supreme Court's immunity ruling — based on the public record, at least,\" Shamsian tweeted.

After SCOTUS' 6-3 ruling in the former president's favor in Trump v. United States, Merchan pushed sentencing back to September 18 in order to allow for time to review how the immunity decision may impact the verdict. At the core of the case was Trump's role in orchestrating hush money payments to multiple women who claimed to have had affairs with him (Trump has denied the affairs) in order to prevent them from sharing their stories with the media ahead of the 2016 election. Bragg argued in his indictment that the payments — which were illegally labeled as legal expenses to his then-attorney, Michael Cohen — constituted illegal campaign contributions, as they were done to advance his political goals. When he took the witness stand, Cohen testified that he made the payments to adult film star Stormy Daniels and former Playboy model Karen McDougal, and that Trump reimbursed him for those payments by calling the reimbursement a legal retainer. Cohen maintained there was no legal retainer and that the reimbursements were for the hush money payments.

The former model turned first lady, who has largely avoided the public eye amid her husband's political career, is set to release her new memoir just weeks before the Nov. 5 presidential election when Donald Trump will face the presumed Democratic nominee Vice President Kamala Harris. Titled Melania, the book tells \"a powerful and inspiring story of a woman who has carved her own path, overcome adversity and defined personal excellence,\" her office said in a statement. \"May your experience reading my book be as enjoyable as the writing process was for me,\" Melania Trump said in a post announcing her new memoir. Melania is published by Skyhorse Publishing, which has released books from other MAGA land personalities such as Donald Trump, his former adviser Steve Bannon, former Trump lawyer Rudy Giuliani and far-right conspiracy theorist Jack Posobiec. \"The book is a diligent and historically important record of the turbulent recent past of our country, seen from Melania Trump's unique vantage point,\" Skyhorse President Tony Lyons told CNBC. \"It coveys her core beliefs of unity, hope and kindness, and whatever you thought you knew about this intensely private woman, these pages contain something more -- and something deeper.\" Melania Trump has rarely made public appearances since leaving the White House and for the most part has avoided the campaign trail outside of some closed-door events at Mar-a-Lago. Her first tell-all book comes with a hefty price tag, with standard copies starting at $40. Fans of the first lady can get a signed copy for $75, and a full-color collector's edition with \"bonus photographs\" and an optional digital collectible goes for $150. Comparatively, First Lady Jill Biden's 2019 memoir \"Where the Light Enters: Building a Family, Discovering Myself\" is currently $16.99 on Amazon, and former First Lady Michelle Obama's Becoming is on sale for $11.32. Donald Trump also announced Thursday he is releasing a new photo book Saving America featuring the iconic photo of him defiantly raising his fist after the failed assassination attempt left his right ear bloodied.

Shiloh, who hired and paid for her own lawyer when she filed to drop the Pitt name on her 18th birthday in May, filed to change her name from Shiloh Nouvel Jolie-Pitt to Shiloh Nouvel Jolie, per the newspaper notice obtained by TMZ.

D. Vance Is Rankling Fellow Veterans","text":"J. D. Vance’s veteran status could be an advantage for the GOP—unless he trumpets his years of service too much and annoys his fellow vets in the process. Breaking the Code J. D. Vance is a U.S. Marine, and he wants you to know it. In the days since he was selected as the GOP vice-presidential nominee, Vance and the Republican Party have touted his service credentials with little discretion. At a rally on Monday, he said, “Well, I don’t know, Kamala, I served in the United States Marine Corps, and I built a business. What the hell have you done other than collect a government check?” Vance hasn’t always grandstanded when it comes to his time in uniform: During his Senate campaign against Tim Ryan two years ago, he spoke of the need for modesty, telling Greg Kelly of Newsmax, “I hate these guys who talk about their military service not because it’s an important part of their identity, but to use it to deflect against any criticism of their record.” And at the Republican National Convention this year, Vance told the crowd, with tact, that after 9/11, he “did what thousands of other young men my age did in that time of soaring patriotism and love of country: I enlisted in the United States Marines.” But if his tone at the rally earlier this week is any indication, Vance may be embracing a newfound lack of modesty when it comes to his service. It’s a paradox: Vance seems to have been picked, in part, because of his veteran status. Donald Trump has shown a pattern of mixing ostentatious patriotism with disdain for American service members—he has described those who died in combat as “suckers” and “losers,” as first reported by The Atlantic’s editor in chief, Jeffrey Goldberg—and he may hope that having a vet on the ticket will deflect from criticism of that history. But if Vance trumpets his years of service too much, he risks squandering the advantage that Republicans have tried to build with veterans and the military. Vance wasn’t a Marine who saw combat. His specialty while he was deployed to Iraq was public affairs, which means he wrote stories and took photos. That in itself is no reason to question him. He served honorably in uniform, which the majority of Americans don’t even consider doing. Among veterans, there’s a mutual understanding that everyone is part of the military family—no matter what their job was. I’m a veteran myself, and I understand that there’s a code: Anyone who volunteered to wear the uniform deserves respect. But few things anger veterans like someone who goes beyond talking about their service and starts bragging about it. When veterans bring undue attention to their service, they invite deep scrutiny of their record that they might not actually want. And when they use their military service as a political cudgel, that veteran code of respect is voided. The GOP is clearly trying to court the veteran vote with Vance, and to paint him as a military hero whom civilian patriots should want to vote for. Senator Dan Sullivan of Alaska—a Marine himself—went on Fox Business to talk about how Vance will be good for the country and for veterans because of his Marine background. Right-wing pundits and others on social media have been treating Vance like a Prussian field marshal: The venture capitalist David Sacks posted, “When the Twin Towers came down, JD Vance enlisted in the Marine Corps, gung-ho to exact justice on America’s enemies.” In a Washington Post op-ed, the conservative political commentator Hugh Hewitt called Vance a “warrior” and a “grunt” who can speak directly to veterans and blue-collar voters. In 2016, the GOP focused heavily on America’s veteran voting bloc; today, more than 18 million living Americans have served, or some 6 percent of the adult population. (There are many more, of course, who are related to veterans or who care about defense issues for other reasons.) The GOP’s focus paid off: The New York Times exit polling showed that veterans turned out heavily for Trump, an advantage that slipped in 2020. Vance’s Marine credentials could, if leveraged properly, help the GOP gain back some of that support. Veterans of Iraq and Afghanistan I have spoken with are glad to have one of their own on a top ticket. But they understand that just because someone has worn the uniform doesn’t mean that they are a strong candidate or a good person. “People are excited … It’s past time for us to have some veterans on these tickets,” Joe Chenelly, the national executive director of the veteran-service organization American Veterans (AMVETS), told me. But Chenelly noted that any veteran can overplay their hand when it comes to their record, Vance included. “I personally don’t like when veterans run and their No. 1 qualification for office is being a veteran. And he’s come close to that,” Chenelly said. “There’s a lot of room for backlash from the veterans community when that happens. He has a responsibility to be very mindful of the way he frames his service.” Vance hasn’t totally broken with the veteran code yet. But his behavior so far shows that he might continue to reject the kind of mindfulness Chenelly is talking about. Over the past few years, Vance has changed his wardrobe to more closely resemble that of Donald Trump, and in the days since his VP nomination, he’s changed his rhetorical approach to sound more like his running mate too. At the RNC, he lauded unity, but in his subsequent solo rallies, he’s claimed, falsely, that Kamala Harris wants to “totally decriminalize” illegal immigration, and that Democrats believe it is “racist to do anything”—including drink Diet Mountain Dew. Even taking Vance out of the equation, up until last week, Trump had a clear advantage with veteran voters and those who care about foreign policy and defense: the fact that Biden fumbled the end of the “forever war.” Trump had been able to thread the rhetorical needle, taking credit for signing the deal to leave Afghanistan but blaming Biden for the way it was done. Voters of both parties disapproved of the way America pulled out of Afghanistan, and Trump could use that fact to go on the offensive (as he did in last month’s debate), because he knew that Biden would always be tied to the images of Afghans falling from a cargo plane as they tried to escape Kabul, and of U.S. Marines killed while standing guard during the chaos. But now the presumptive Democratic nominee, Kamala Harris, can distance herself from Biden’s Afghanistan policy, which Republicans have largely managed to tie to the president himself rather than to his administration more broadly. (When I speak with veterans and those involved in the Afghanistan withdrawal, they invariably complain about Biden, not Harris.) Pollsters pay little attention to the veteran vote, which makes it difficult to track, and we don’t yet know how Trump and Vance will square against a Harris-led ticket. But the fact that Harris can break free of the Afghanistan legacy could give her an advantage with the veteran vote. Chenelly, of AMVETS, said that many of the veterans in his organization don’t know all that much about Harris. But they have been angry with Biden for Afghanistan and even blame some of the current military-recruiting crisis on him. What we do know is that if the Trump campaign wants to properly court veterans and their families, Vance ought to stay humble about his military service—an unlikely feat in a campaign where humility is not the guiding principle.
