A vote Saturday to formally organize Starbase as a city was being approved by a lopsided margin by a small group of voters who live there and are mostly Musk's employees at SpaceX. Starbase is the facility and launch site for the SpaceX rocket program that is under contract with the Department of Defense and NASA that hopes to send astronauts back to the moon and someday to Mars. Musk first floated the idea of Starbase in 2021 and approval of the new city was all but certain. Of the 283 eligible voters in the area, most are believed to be Starbase workers. The election victory was personal for Musk. The billionaire's popularity has diminished since he became the chain-saw-wielding public face of President Donald Trump's federal job and spending cuts, and profits at his Tesla car company have plummeted. SpaceX has generally drawn widespread support from local officials for its jobs and investment in the area. But the creation of an official company town has also drawn critics who worry it will expand Musk's personal control over the area, with potential authority to close a popular beach and state park for launches. Companion efforts to the city vote include bills in the state Legislature to shift that authority from the county to the new town's mayor and city council. All these measures come as SpaceX is asking federal authorities for permission to increase the number of South Texas launches from five to 25 a year. The city at the southern tip of Texas near the Mexico border is only about 1.5 square miles (3.9 square kilometers), crisscrossed by a few roads and dappled with airstream trailers and modest midcentury homes. SpaceX officials have said little about exactly why they to want a company town and did not respond to emailed requests for comment. We need the ability to grow Starbase as a community, Starbase General Manager Kathryn Lueders wrote to local officials in 2024 with the request to get the city issue on the ballot. The letter said the company already manages roads and utilities, as well as the provisions of schooling and medical care for those living on the property. SpaceX officials have told lawmakers that granting the city authority to close the beach would streamline launch operations. SpaceX rocket launches and engine tests, and even just moving certain equipment around the launch base requires the closure of a local highway and access to Boca Chica State Park and Boca Chica Beach. Critics say beach closure authority should stay with the county government, which represents a broader population that uses the beach and park. Cameron County Judge Eddie Trevino, Jr. has said the county has worked well with SpaceX and there is no need for change. Another proposed bill would make it a Class B misdemeanor with up to 180 days in jail if someone doesn't comply with an order to evacuate the beach. The South Texas Environmental Justice Network, which has organized protests against the city vote and the beach access issue, plan to hold another protest Saturday night as the polls close.","summary":"SpaceX's South Texas facility, poised to become the city of Starbase, anticipates near-certain approval from local voters, largely SpaceX employees.

\n\nBecause members of the White House press corps all think and act in unison, as if they are members of a guild, they’ve already lost the argument.\n\nConsider that none of them saw any sign of Joe Biden’s cognitive decline — until it jeopardized his chances of beating Trump.\n\nInstantly, they all joined the call for Biden to step aside and anoint Kamala Harris as the Dem nominee.\n\nIndependence daze\n\nStill, the vague claim of “independence” is the only argument they have and it’s not a coincidence that both the Times and the Corporation for Public Broadcasting used the word to defend their perks and declare themselves holier than thou.\n\nIn a recent article that covered nearly two full pages in the print edition, the Times sneered at White House attempts to broaden access to the president in the Oval Office and briefing room by making space for newcomers, including bloggers and podcasters.\n\nTo the Gray Lady, letting in upstarts who don’t subscribe to leftist pieties is an affront to all that is good and decent.\n\n“Longtime White House reporters say the result has been an erosion of their independence,” the Times sneered, without defining what independence it was referring to.\n\nIt went on to claim that adding newer media outlets “has undercut the briefing as a space to relay accurate information to the American public and hold the president to account.”\n\nIt offers no evidence of those claims, except to show that the newer outlets sometimes get to ask questions of the press secretary that are different from the ones the Times thinks should be asked.\n\nHeaven forbid!\n\nThat’s the left in a nutshell: Diversity is a good idea as long as everybody thinks alike!\n\nNPR reacted with the same don’t-you know-who-we-are arrogance.\n\nIt said Trump’s executive order defunding the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, which in turn funds PBS and NPR, is “an affront to the First Amendment rights of NPR . . . and locally owned and operated the First Amendment rights of station listeners and donors who support independent news and information.”\n\nSo let’s get this straight: By saving taxpayers $500 million a year by pulling the funding, Trump is violating the First Amendment rights of both recipients and listeners.\n\nIs there a lawyer in the house?\n\nFree speech gatekeepers\n\nThe sense of entitlement perfectly captures the arrogance of the leftist outlets. \n\nThey not only want a monopoly, they also demand that taxpayers fund it.\n\nWhat they really fear is that breaking their stranglehold will lead to the public hearing different perspectives and that will be the end of their cookie jar.\n\nThink about the implications: These are the supposed guardians of the First Amendment, yet they try to squelch the free flow of information because it threatens their sinecures and control of what the public knows about its government.\n\nBad as it is, the position would be more defensible if the legacy media didn’t distort everything by putting their leftist spin on all news and commentary. \n\nTheir lack of fairness and balance is the ultimate reason why they should lose their dominance.\n\nUnfortunately for them, the second Trump White House sees the pattern and is determined to throw open the doors.\n\nMoreover, the administration is wise to the grifters’ false claims of being independent and is now insisting they actually live up to the word.\n\nIn his Friday executive order ending funding for PBS and NPR, Trump cited why the outlets should be forced to do without government money.\n\n“Government funding of news media in this environment is not only outdated and unnecessary but corrosive to the appearance of journalistic independence,” the president wrote.","summary":"When there is a Republican president, the leftist-dominated White House press corps likes to gang up and try to put him on defense.","url":"https://nypost.com/2025/05/03/opinion/michael-goodwin-the-left-wing-media-creates-false-allegations-with-trump-back-in-the-oval-office/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/05/u-s-president-donald-trump-103579181-e1746319677271.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-05-04 01:11:20","author":"Michael Goodwin","authors":["Michael Goodwin"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.066},{"id":317565232,"title":"World News | Elon Musk's Starbase on Its Way to Becoming a Texas City After Lopsided Early Voting Results","text":"McAllen (Texas), May 4 (AP) The South Texas home of Elon Musk's SpaceX rocket company is on its way to becoming an official city with a galactic name: Starbase.

Organizers estimate the crowd numbered between 5,000 and 6,000.Newsweek reached out to Sanders' spokesperson via email on Saturday for comment.Why It MattersPennsylvania, with its 19 electoral votes, was critical to Trump's 2024 presidential victory and has reemerged as a decisive swing state heading into the 2026 midterms.Trump's surge in support in smaller cities like Allentown and Scranton helped secure the state over Kamala Harris in November, flipping several counties that leaned more Democratic in prior elections.Sanders' rally in Bethlehem, located in Lehigh County, which swung over 5 percent more Republican compared to 2020 — highlights progressive efforts to reclaim lost ground among working-class voters in the Rust Belt. His populist economic message appears aimed at those same disillusioned constituents who have drifted away from the Democratic Party in recent years.What To KnowLehigh University's sports arena hosted the 83-year-old independent senator as he made his third Pennsylvania stop in just three days on his \"Fighting Oligarchy\" tour.Speaking just miles from Gettysburg, Sanders invoked Abraham Lincoln's vision of government \"of the people, by the people, for the people,\" contrasting it with what he called a modern system run by billionaires.Sanders name-checked Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, Meta's Mark Zuckerberg and Tesla CEO Elon Musk, saying all three tech tycoons stood behind Trump at his 2025 inauguration and represent the consolidation of wealth and power undermining democracy.\"Right now, we have a government of the billionaire class, by the billionaire class, for the billionaire class, and we are not going to accept that,\" Sanders said, drawing thunderous applause from the crowd.As head of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), Musk has led the charge on cuts to federal spending, and as the owner of X, formerly Twitter, has made himself a top advocate for the administration's policies through his prolific social media activity.Sanders criticized both Trump and Democratic leadership, saying the latter's failure over the past half-century to stand up for working Americans helped pave the way for Trump's rise. He condemned cuts to Medicaid, threats to Social Security, and growing corporate influence in Washington.What People Are SayingSenator Bernie Sanders took to X, formerly Twitter on Saturday: \"More than 5,000 people came out in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania to stand up for the needs of working families against the billionaire class, against powerful special interests, against enormous corporate greed, and against Trump's authoritarianism.\"He added: \"That's what this movement is about.\"Anna Bahr, director of communications for Sanders, told Newsweek in an email on Friday: \"The arrogance, selfishness, greed, and exploitation of the current oligarchic regime – as personified by Elon Musk, but also by many other billionaires like Zuckerberg, Bezos, etc – have generated a period of populist revolt that unites working people across the political spectrum.\"Billionaire Trump ally Elon Musk on Sanders' recent Denver, Colorado rally in a March 23 X post: \"The Dems just move around the same group of paid 'protesters.'\" In a separate post on April 11, Musk wrote: \"Bernie is just fully communist.\"Sanders told rallygoers at Saturday's \"Fighting Oligarchy\" event in Bethlehem: \"The Democratic Party is going to finally have to say, 'We're going to stand with those people. We are prepared to take on the greed of corporate America.'\"What Happens NextSanders' \"Fighting Oligarchy\" tour is expected to continue drawing national attention as Democrats assess how to rebuild a fractured coalition in time for the 2026 midterms.","summary":"Bernie Sanders draws thousands in Trump-won Pennsylvania, blasting billionaire influence and rallying working-class support.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/video-photos-show-bernie-sanders-crowd-size-swing-state-trump-won-2067775","image":"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2638293/bernie-sanders.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-05-04 01:04:59","author":"Adeola Adeosun","authors":["Adeola Adeosun"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.127},{"id":317566700,"title":"Pro-Separation Albertans Hold Rally, Say Things Won’t Change Under Confederation","text":"EDMONTON—Katheryn Speck said she used to be a Canadian nationalist, travelled the world with a maple leaf on her backpack and once lived in Quebec so she could become fluently bilingual.\n\nBut on Saturday she was among hundreds of people who rallied at the Alberta legislature to support separation from Canada, with many in the crowd waving Alberta flags and a few even displaying the U.S. Stars and Stripes.\n\n“I thought it was a beautiful, fantastic country.

I’m literally crushed that we'll never be represented in this country and there’s never a chance of changing the government,” Speck said.\n\nEarlier this week, Premier Danielle Smith’s government proposed legislation that would lower the bar for holding a referendum.

That does not change,” Smith said.\n\nIn March, Smith threatened a “national unity crisis” if the next prime minister doesn’t acquiesce to a list of her demands within six months, but reiterated this week that she supports a sovereign Alberta within a united Canada.\n\nRally attendee Susan Westernaier said she believed everything would be better if Alberta separated.\n\n“We have the oil, we have the resources. We’re fine,” Westernaier said, noting she believed Monday’s election was rigged.","summary":"EDMONTON—Katheryn Speck said she used to be a Canadian nationalist, travelled the world with a maple leaf on her backpack and once lived in Quebec so she could become fluently bilingual.

It wielded trade barriers as a means of political coercion, imperiling Australia’s export-dependent economy,” the Times wrote.\n\n“Three years ago that country was China, which had imposed punishing restrictions on many Australian exports, sent spy ships lurking near Australia’s west coast and struck an alarming military pact with a regional neighbor, the Solomon Islands.\n\n“This time, as Australians cast ballots on Saturday, that external factor is the United States and President Trump.”\n\nAustralia’s former Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull piled on, too, telling BBC Newshour that Dutton ran a “very Trumpian campaign” and the US president was “the mood music that had a very big influence on how people perceived” the Coalition.\n\nSenior Liberals who spoke to news.com.au said the same thing — that Trump and the Coalition campaign could not be separated.\n\n“Honestly, easily, the single biggest factor is Trump,’’ a senior Liberal MP told news.com.au.“He has just smashed us.\n\n“It’s a less dramatic version of what’s happened in Canada. The Canadian conservatives have lost 20 points in the polls over this. It’s the same phenomenon.”\n\nWorld leaders from Ukraine to India and the UK sent congratulations to returning PM Albanese while, as of Sunday morning, Donald Trump was yet to reach out.\n\nUS Secretary of State Marco Rubio sent his best to Albanese, describing the relationship between the US and Australia as an “enduring alliance”.\n\n“Australia is a valued ally, partner, and friend of the United States,” he said in a statement.\n\n“The United States looks forward to deepening its relationship with Australia to advance our common interests and promote freedom and stability in the Indo-Pacific and globally.”\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky was also quick to contratulate the Labor party for its victory. \n\n“Ukraine sincerely values Australia’s unwavering support and its principled stance on ending Russia’s war and securing a dignified and lasting peace,” he said in a statement.\n\n“We look forward to further strengthening our productive partnership.”\n\nNew Zealand PM Christopher Luxon spoke directly with his nearest neighbour.\n\n“I have been in touch with Mr Albanese to offer my congratulations on retaining office,” he said.\n\n“When we spoke, Mr Albanese and I affirmed our strong working relationship. New Zealand has no better friend and no greater ally than Australia. Working together is even more important now as we both face the most challenging global environment in decades. We are stronger on the world stage together. \n\n“I look forward to continuing to work with Mr Albanese on a range of issues including our shared security, partnering in the Pacific, and making the trans-Tasman business environment ever more seamless.” \n\nUK leader Keir Starmer also issued a statement of congratulations, describing the two nations as “close as ever”.\n\n“I know that we will continue to work together on our shared ambitions,” he wrote on social media.\n\nIndian Prime Minister Narendra Modi said Albanese’s election win would strengthen ties between the India and Australia.\n\n“Congratulations on your resounding victory and re-election.

Campaigns of all stripes have partaken,” she said. “Behold, the Liberal party’s last-minute SMS to voters about asylum seekers before the 2022 federal election, or “Labor’s controversial ‘Mediscare’ text before the 2016 poll. Despite multiple cycles of criticism, these tactics remain a persistent feature of Australian election campaigns.”\n\nShe said a recent proposal to update decades-old rules could help change things – if a government would put it into practice.\n\n“First, there is the Spam Act. This legislation requires that organisations obtain our consent before sending us marketing emails, SMSs and instant messages. The unsubscribe links you see at the bottom of spam emails? Those are mandated by the Spam Act,” she said.\n\n“Second, the Do Not Call Register (DNCR) Act. This act establishes a “do not call” register, managed by the Australian Communications and Media Authority (Acma), which individuals can join to opt out of telemarketing calls.\n\n“Finally, there is the Privacy Act, which governs how organisations collect, use and disclose our personal information. Among other things, the Privacy Act requires that organisations tell us when and why they are collecting our personal information and the purposes for which they intend to use it. It restricts organisations from re-purposing personal information collected for a particular purpose, unless an exception applies.\n\nShe said this trio of laws was designed to offer relief from unsolicited, unwanted direct marketing. It does not, however, stop the deluge of political messages at election time due to broad political exemptions sewn into the legislation decades ago.\n\n“The Spam Act and DNCR Act apply to marketing for goods and services but not election policies and promises, while the Privacy Act contains a carve-out for political parties, representatives and their contractors,” she said.\n\nCounting continues on Sunday.","summary":"After her party bombarded Aussie’s phones with unsolicited text messages, the Trumpet of Patriots leader has made a shock move on social media.","url":"https://www.news.com.au/national/federal-election/trumpet-of-patriots-leaders-shock-move-after-election-result/news-story/4b871ed93eaf8198e1c445f259f5d6e9?from=rss-basic","image":"https://content.api.news/v3/images/bin/9cf1ca5fbdb2d70cc7c56b291c37cd13","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-05-04 00:54:35","author":"Brielle Burns","authors":["Brielle Burns"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"au","sentiment":0.074},{"id":317564504,"title":"Marriott CEO says ‘the right thing’ about DEI, gets 40K emails in response","text":"A hotel industry’s top exec has revealed the overwhelming positive support he’s received after tackling diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) head on.\n\nDuring the Great Place to Work for All Summit last week, Marriott CEO and President Anthony Capuano spoke to the crowd about the cultural and workplace shifts on DEI and reflected on a moment he was met with unexpected encouragement from tens of thousands of emails from coworkers.\n\n“The day the [DEI] executive order came out, I sat with our senior leadership team and I said: given the industry-leading position we have, we ought to make sure we’re all aligned on, not only philosophically — how we think about this, which was the easy part — but what words we use, what language we use.

A vote Saturday to decide whether to turn part of south Texas into a new city centered around Elon Musk’s SpaceX delivered a victory to the tech billionaire and his rocket company. As expected, the measure passed with broad support, paving the way for a newly incorporated city made up almost exclusively of SpaceX employees and people connected to the company. The initial vote tally was 173 in favor of incorporation and 4 against; only 143 votes were needed for the measure to pass. “It’s officially statistically impossible for the measure to fail,” Cameron County Elections Administrator Remi Garza said Saturday night. “Cameron County is about to have a new city.” Now that the vote has passed, commissioners in the county will canvass the results within two weeks, Garza said. A judge will then assign an order declaring the results of the election and the official incorporation of the new city. The new city of Starbase covers about 1½ square miles at the southern tip of Texas, a coastal spot nestled against the Mexico border. The area is home to SpaceX headquarters, and it’s where the company builds its boosters and engines and launches its huge Starship rocket on test flights. The ballot result was a much-needed win for Musk, who has faced widespread backlash over the past few months for his involvement with President Donald Trump’s administration. Musk was installed as chief of the so-called Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) and oversaw sweeping layoffs and cuts across federal agencies. In response, protests against Musk erupted around the country and profits plummeted at the billionaire’s electric car company, Tesla. Now, SpaceX will have the company town that Musk first publicly proposed in 2021. In addition to incorporating the new city, Saturday’s election also selected Starbase’s first mayor — Bobby Pedden — and two city commissioners — Jordan Buss and Jenna Petrzelka. The candidates for all three positions ran unopposed, and all three are employees of SpaceX. There were 283 people eligible to cast ballots in Saturday’s Cameron County special election, according to county election records. Eligibility was determined based on if a resident’s home would fall within the boundaries of the proposed new city. Neither SpaceX nor Musk has detailed the purpose of incorporating a city around the rocket company’s operations. There has been speculation, however, that having greater municipal control of the area could ease some of the bureaucracy and restrictions around SpaceX’s tests and rocket launches. At the moment, SpaceX must obtain permission from authorities in Cameron County to close a highway and shut down public access to Boca Chica Beach and Boca Chica State Park to keep people safe during rocket launches. The frequent closures have contributed to legal complaints against SpaceX, and have drawn protests from local residents and activists, including the Carrizo Comecrudo Tribe of Texas, the South Texas Environmental Justice Network and Border Workers United, as reported by CNBC. Now that SpaceX operates within the newly incorporated city of Starbase, things may soon change — though perhaps not without resistance. “Right now that authority lies solely within Cameron County and my office, and we think that we’ve proven to be good collaborators and partners with SpaceX in their operations and also in making sure and providing enough notice and public access to Boca Chica Beach,” Cameron County Judge Eddie Trevino told NBC News. Trevino said any changes to the established procedures would be unnecessary. “If it’s not broken, it doesn’t need to be fixed,” he said.","summary":"Residents of the small south Texas town that's home to Elon Musk’s SpaceX have voted to incorporate into a new city called Starbase.","url":"https://www.nbcnews.com/science/space/welcome-starbase-population-283-rcna204214","image":"https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-1500w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-05/250503-starbase-wm-524p-e7e7cc.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-05-04 00:49:21","author":"Denise Chow,Marissa Parra","authors":["Denise Chow","Marissa Parra"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.265},{"id":317567962,"title":"Elon Musk: It Is ‘Outrageous’ to ‘Claim That I’m a Nazi’","text":"Elon Musk, the head of Donald Trump’s so-called Department of Government Efficiency, said “it’s an outrageous thing to claim that I’m a Nazi” in a clip from an interview with Fox News that was released Friday, slamming how he’s been covered by the media. He also said that if his detractors could “press a button” and kill him, they would, but he is “difficult to kill.” \n\n At Trump’s post-inauguration rally, Musk gave a straight-arm salute that many, including his estranged daughter, interpreted to be a Sieg Heil. Since he bought Twitter, now social platform X, he has restored white supremacist accounts that were previously banned. In March, as he was carrying out widespread firings of federal workers, he shared a post from an X account that said that Joseph Stalin, Adolf Hitler, and Mao Zedong didn’t cause the deaths of millions of people. Instead, public workers did. After criticism, he removed the post.\n\n Shortly after Trump’s inauguration, Musk spoke virtually at a campaign event for a far-right German political party, Alternative für Deutschland. He said that Germans should not lose their culture to “multiculturalism.” \n\n “Children should not be guilty of the sins of their parents, let alone their great grandparents,” he said. \n\n Musk has become increasingly unpopular as he slashes the federal government via DOGE, cutting agencies and programs. Tesla dealerships have been the location of protests, vandalism, and arson; the company’s cars have been given the name “swasticars.” In March, Musk said that he and the DOGE team were getting death threats on a daily basis. \n\n “You grew up in South Africa,” Lara Trump, Trump’s daughter-in-law and Fox News host, said in the new interview. “You lived during a period of Apartheid. I’m sure you’ve seen a lot of horrific things. So to be called a Nazi by people, to be made out to be this monster, that must be really hard for you.” \n\n “It’s a relentless propaganda campaign, which obviously President Trump has experienced for a very long time,” Musk said. “Twenty years, maybe longer. And politics is a blood sport. So they’re going to come up with whatever attacks they can to destroy the public perception of someone.” \n\n “Now, obviously,” he continued, “I’ve not harmed anyone in my life, so it’s an outrageous thing to claim that I’m a Nazi, because the issue with Nazis was not their mannerisms or their, you know, choice of dress, but the fact that they killed millions of people. That’s the issue. They’ve also called President Trump a Nazi, and there was one publication that said He’s … worse than Hitler, Stalin, and maybe Mao combined, but he also is not a violent person, and, in fact, has done a lot to prevent wars and stop wars, which is the very opposite of being a Nazi.”\n\n “Ironic how that works out,” Lara Trump said.\n\n “But it is disappointing how well propaganda works,” Musk said. “If you repeat a lie, you know, the sort of ‘he’s a Nazi’ line enough times, some people actually believe it, especially people that still believe the legacy news. So if they still think that what CNN says with the exception of Scott Jennings is true, then, you know, they call me an Nazi on CNN. So if someone believes CNN, then they would say, ‘Oh … that’s an Nazi.’ That’s because they said it on TV. The person on the TV said it. But they really are trying every angle to get me.”\n\n In January, Elon Musk’s mother had encouraged him in a post on X to sue CNN after Washington Post columnist Catherine Rampell argued with conservative panelist Scott Jennings about the straight-arm gesture. Rampell told him he should do the same gesture on television if it was not controversial. \n\n “Why don’t you do it on TV right now? Why don’t you do it on TV right now if you think it’s so, so banal,” Rampell said. Jennings, of course, did not do the gesture.\n\n In his interview with Lara Trump, Musk said he thinks some people want him dead.\n\n “If they could press a button and kill me in reality, they would press that button immediately, but since I’m a little difficult to kill, they are doing character assassination instead,” he said.\n\n It’s unclear who the “they” is he’s referring to, but it appears he’s getting paranoid.","summary":"The head of Trump's so-called DOGE told Fox News people would kill him if they could","url":"https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-news/elon-musk-nazi-claims-fox-news-1235330984/","image":"https://www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/ElonMuskNaziResponse-1.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-05-04 00:44:29","author":"Althea Legaspi,Naomi Lachance","authors":["Althea Legaspi","Naomi Lachance"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.33},{"id":317563518,"title":"Trump’s Proposed Cuts to Public Radio Stations Could Impact Lifeline Services During Disasters","text":"CHARLESTON, W.Va. — In the aftermath of Hurricane Helene, which struck Asheville, North Carolina, the familiar sound from open car windows was Blue Ridge Public Radio, as locals gathered along a ridge to find cell reception. While queuing for essentials like water and food, the updates they had absorbed from the station provided constant discussion material.\n\n“The public radio station was alerting people what was going on,” said Lisa Savage, who volunteered at an area church after the hurricane.\n\nCurrently, public radio stations are facing potential funding cuts proposed by President Donald Trump, who recently signed an executive order targeting the reduction of public subsidies to NPR and PBS, accusing them of “bias” in their reporting.\n\nFor communities affected by severe weather that disrupts power, internet, and cell infrastructure, public radio stations have been an essential source of information. In many out-of-the-way and rural areas throughout the U.S., these stations often serve as the primary, if not the only, outlet for local news.\n\nAbout a week after she had volunteered in the Asheville area, Savage recalled driving through another hard-hit community and hearing updates on Blue Ridge Public Radio on where residents could pick up water.\n\n“So that was crucial,” Savage said.\n\nIn the West Texas desert, Marfa Public Radio provides listeners with a mix of local and national news and music. It is based in Marfa, a city of about 2,000 that draws tourists to its art scene.\n\n“Marfa Public Radio is the only radio service in a lot of the geographic area that we cover,” said Tom Livingston, the station’s interim executive director. “So it’s really essential in terms of if there’s news events, if there’s safety things that happen in the community.”\n\nFunding has widespread impact\n\nTrump’s order instructs the Corporation for Public Broadcasting and other federal agencies “to cease Federal funding for NPR and PBS” and further requires that they work to root out indirect sources of public financing for the news organizations. The broadcasters get roughly half a billion dollars in public money through the private CPB, which has said that it is not a federal executive agency subject to Trump’s orders.\n\nThe heads of PBS, NPR and CPB all suggested Friday that the order was illegal, and a court fight seems inevitable.\n\nThe White House has also said it will be asking Congress to rescind funding for the CPB as part of a $9.1 billion package of cuts. Local stations operate on a combination of government funding, donations and philanthropic grants, and stations in smaller markets are particularly dependent on the public money.\n\nWMMT, based in the eastern Kentucky community of Whitesburg, can be heard in parts of five Appalachian states. The station’s general manager, Teddy Wimer, said listeners “want to hear people that sound like folks that they know from Appalachia,” and the station, which currently operates from a renovated Winnebago called the Possum Den, relies on CPB funding.\n\n“We’re in an economically disadvantaged area of the country,” Wimer said. “Most of our listeners who really rely upon our programming don’t have the funds to ramp up their support.”\n\nLivingston said about 30% of their funding comes from the CPB. Right now, he says, it’s too early to know if the cuts will actually happen or what they would impact if they do come through.\n\nLocal flavor is a factor in listenership and credibility\n\nAlong the West Virginia-Virginia border, more than three hours from Washington, D.C., residents can pick up signals from radio stations far away. But those “aren’t going have the local flavor and impact that we do,” said Scott Smith, general manager of Allegheny Mountain Radio. “This is the only game in town for that sort of thing.”\n\nIn his home base of Monterey, Virginia, Smith said there’s about a 4 -square-mile area of cell coverage with one cell tower. The station has proven to be a vital source of information during natural disasters. In 2012, residents relied on it after a derecho knocked out power to 680,000 customers across West Virginia and it took nearly two weeks for some areas to get their service restored.\n\n“Yeah, we play music. Yeah, we get on the air and joke around,” he said. “But we’re here providing basic level services of information, emergency information, that sort of thing, to our communities. And as part of that, we’re a pretty critical link in this area for the emergency alert system.”\n\nSmith has a staff of 10 people at Allegheny Mountain Radio, which receives 68% of its annual budget from CPB.\n\n“What CPB does fund the most is small rural radio,” Smith said. “When you take 60% of our income away, that’s not readily or easily replaceable.”\n\nSmith calls it a “wait-and-see game” on whether Congress will act on the CPB funding.\n\n“The answer to how we move forward is vague,” Smith said. “We will still continue to be here as long as we can be.”","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nCHARLESTON, W.Va. — In the aftermath of Hurricane Helene, which struck Asheville,&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Trump&#8217;s Proposed Cuts to Public Radio Stations Could Impact Lifeline Services During Disasters first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/local-news/trumps-proposed-cuts-to-public-radio-stations-could-impact-lifeline-services-during-disasters/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Public-radio-stations-targeted-for-cuts-by-Trump-offer-lifelines.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-05-04 00:42:39","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.244},{"id":317563520,"title":"AI-Generated Photo of Trump as Pope Sparks Online Outcry","text":"US President Donald Trump posted a spoof picture of himself dressed as the pope on his Truth Social platform after joking that he would like to be the next Catholic pontiff.\n\nThe president is seen in what appears to be an AI-generated colour image, with his right index finger pointed toward the sky, wearing papal regalia, including white robes, a gold crucifix pendant and the miter hat.\n\nIt comes after Trump joked to reporters this week that he would like to be the next pope, just days before cardinals are due to start the conclave to elect the successor of .\n\nTrump went on to say that he did not have a preference but said there was a cardinal in New York who was “very good.”\n\nHe appeared to be referring to the archbishop of New York, Timothy Dolan, a theological conservative and fiercely opposed to abortion.\n\nThe New York State Catholic Conference, which says it represents bishops of the state in working with the government, voiced sharp criticism of the picture.\n\n“There is nothing clever or funny about this image, Mr. President,” it wrote in a post on X.\n\n“We just buried our beloved Pope Francis and the cardinals are about to enter a solemn conclave to elect a new successor of St. Peter.

He talked of a \"win win\" partnership with the US, and reminded the president that Canada was the \"biggest client\" of 40 of the 50 US states, and a key energy and fertiliser supplier. \n\nHe also told me he \"potentially could supply them with critical minerals\". This struck me as a negotiation tactic very targeted at what Trump has become fixated on elsewhere. \n\nCanada has ample resources of critical minerals, and would be a much more dependable supplier across the West than many other nations. Carney is implicitly suggesting, however, that his country has deep strategic choices to make here, on for example, developing them with Europe rather than the US.\n\nIn any event, the PM will use the impetus of external threat to try to transform the Canadian economy. Even in the granting of an interview to BBC News, it was clear that he sees a critical need to diversify trade and strategic alliances. Defence partnerships are now on the cards. \n\nHe seemed to acknowledge that a stalled Canada-UK trade deal could be expedited.\n\nOn Friday he pulled off the historic announcement that King Charles would reopen the Canadian parliament in person at the end of the month. This has not happened since 1977. It is entirely in keeping with Canada's constitution, but it is also a stunning assertion of enduring independence from the White House.\n\nAll roads now lead to the G7 Summit hosted by Carney in the middle of June in Alberta, bringing together the world's seven largest economies, which dominate global trade and the international financial system.\n\nAssuming that Trump comes, it will occur within days of the expiry of the pause in massive so-called \"reciprocal tariffs\" on most of the world. \n\nIt is often forgotten that if Canada and Mexico free themselves from the fentanyl tariffs, they will then, according to White House advisers, find themselves subject to this system, with a minimum of 10% tariffs.\n\nAll of this occurs within days of some growing frustration from America's traditional allies with the entire \"trade deal\" process. \n\nJapan is increasingly frustrated, with its finance minister now openly pointing to Japan's unbeaten holding of US government debt as a \"card\" in negotiations. \n\nThe EU has not got very far. Even the UK has hinted that a deal with Europe may be a more effective way of boosting the economy.\n\nIt comes as tariffs are starting to have a visible and tangible negative impact on US businesses and consumers.\n\nThere is no great incentive to offer much up, while the US itself starts to feel the inevitable inflationary consequences of its actions. \n\nThe flotilla of empty Chinese cargo ships and empty docks on the US West Coast will soon be seen in the economic data of an already shrinking US economy.\n\nAs a veteran of economic crises arising from the uncertain experiments of governments, Carney might be uniquely placed on how these situations pan out. Many in the markets have been thoroughly unimpressed with the White House advisers sent out to reassure investors in recent weeks.\n\nBut Carney too has his own challenges. He just missed out on a majority in parliament, but has chosen to try to project this as a virtue. \n\nHe will reach across the aisle for a \"Team Canada\" approach to talks with the US. \n\nThe Premier of the oil-rich Alberta state, who is a regular visitor to Mar-a-Lago, immediately announced moves to make separation referendums easier.\n\nThis is a very complicated, domestic, continental and global environment economically and politically. Few would predict exactly where it goes. Carney may have a very large part in it, and not just for his own country.","url":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cgjlqwxevd0o","image":"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/2563/live/4f5f3640-2767-11f0-9bdb-2b348bd5e027.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-05-04 00:35:29","author":"Faisal Islam","authors":["Faisal Islam"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":0.092},{"id":317564314,"title":"Trump takes another smackdown — this time by Mexican president","text":"Then again, what would you expect from an American president who has no clue about history or foreign affair norms or territorial sovereignty? Who embraces enemies and insults and alienates allies?\n\nDonald Trump, who has all but signaled to Russia to take what it wants in Ukraine while threatening Canada, Greenland and Panama with occupation, wanted to send American armed forces into Mexico — you know, to help those inept Mexican officials.\n\nNo thanks, said Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum.\n\nThis is Trump’s second recent high-level smackdown. Last week, Canadian prime minister Mark Carney said Trump retreated from comments of making Canada the 51st state when the two spoke. Trump’s tough talk on Canada, it seems, is only bluster that he can’t muster in person.\n\nSheinbaun said Saturday that she had declined an offer by Trump to send troops to fight drug cartels on Mexican territory. Speaking during a public university inauguration in Texcoco, Sheinbaum confirmed a Wall Street Journal report that Trump had made the offer — saying it was mentioned during “some of the calls” the two have shared.\n\n“He said: ‘How can we help you to fight against drug trafficking? I propose that the U.S. Army come in to help you.’ And do you know what I told him? ‘No, President Trump. The territory is inviolable. Sovereignty is inviolable. Sovereignty cannot be sold. Sovereignty is cherished and defended,’” Sheinbaum said.\n\nShe added: “It’s not necessary. We can collaborate, we can work together, but you on your territory, and we on ours. We can share information, but we will never accept the presence of the US Army on our territory.”\n\nTension rose toward the end of a 45-minute telephone conversation with Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum on April 16 when Trump pushed to have U.S. armed forces take a leading role in battling Mexican drug gangs that produce and smuggle fentanyl to the U.S., the people said. Sheinbaum told Trump her administration would cooperate on matters such as intelligence sharing but not accept a direct military presence, the people added.\n\nTrump has said publicly that the U.S. would take unilateral action if Mexico doesn’t dismantle cartels. “Mexico is very, very afraid of the cartels,” Trump told the Spanish-language network of Fox News shortly after the April 16 conversation. “We want to help her. We want to help Mexico, because you can’t run a country like that. You just can’t.”\n\nTrump and Sheinbaum have said their call was productive. White House spokeswoman Anna Kelly said robust bilateral cooperation is delivering results and creating a historically secure border. \n\n“But Mexico still must do more to protect Americans from dangerous foreign terrorist organizations and the drugs and violence they flood into communities on both sides of the border,” she said.\n\nThis isn’t the first time Sheinbaum has beaten Trump.\n\nTrump walked back his tariff threat against Mexico last month after he said he had a “friendly conversation” with Sheinbaum. He announced that he would be imposing 25% tariffs on Mexico and Canada, and an additional 10% tariff on China.\n\nTrump said that Sheinbum would immediately supply 10,000 Mexican soldiers on the southern border between the two countries that will be tasked to “stop the flow of fentanyl, and illegal migrants into our Country.” He also said the agreement included pausing the antiquated tariffs for a one-month period as the two countries negotiate a “deal.”\n\nBut multiple pundits pointed out Monday that Trump may have been outfoxed by Sheinbaum, noting that former President Joe Biden secured the same deal at the beginning of his term without the tariffs.\n\n“President Biden got this exact deal -- 10,000 troops deployed to the border -- at the start of his term without tanking the market,” Democratic strategist Zac Petkanas wrote on social media platform X.\n\nOur journalism needs your support.

Email tips@dailymail.com \nBy DAILY MAIL REPORTER \n Published:01:08 BST, 4 May 2025 |Updated:01:22 BST, 4 May 2025 \n\nDame Mary Berry is set to release a special new project with the BBC to celebrate her milestone 90th birthday.\nThe national treasure, who is best known for hosting the Great British Bake Off, is reportedly bringing out a new series in autumn after she turned 90 on March 20.\nAfter her milestone birthday, it has been claimed that Mary is now filming a special series in celebration of her life, including all her favourite recipes. \nA source told the Mirror: 'Mary is a national treasure so what better way to celebrate her than a new series. It'll be a tribute to the Mary’s joy of cooking and sharing good food.'\nIt is thought the six-part show will feature some of the icon's favourite memories, as well as her best-known fuss-free recipes for every occasion.\nMailOnline has contacted the BBC for comment.\n\nMary Berry is set to release a special new project with the BBC this autumn to celebrate her milestone 90th birthday\nMary previously revealed how she would be celebrating her 90th birthday while speaking to Vogue. \nShe simply said: 'There will be cake, and champagne. I'm all for parties.'\nThe chef also admitted she is no fan of gyms and instead takes after her mother, who preferred walking for exercise.\nSpeaking of her mother Margaret, she said: 'She didn't go to gyms and I couldn't agree with her more.'\nMary previously suffered a health scare when she was picking sweet peas in her garden in August 2021 and tripped.\nShe had to wait three and a half hours for an ambulance to arrive and had surgery for a broken hip at the Royal Berkshire Hospital in Reading.\nThe TV star said the following year: 'My GP told me, ''You've two options. You could sit in a chair and do no exercise and quite probably be dead in four years, or you can set to, walk (uphill too!) and do everything you can, and it'll take 18 months for a full recovery''.\n'And gosh, she was right. I've exercised and had lots of physio and it's not quite normal yet, but it will be.'\n\nHer birthday was back in March, but it's claimed she is currently filming a special series in celebration of her life and favourite recipes\n\nSpeaking about her birthday to Vogue, Mary (pictured in 2022) simply said: 'There will be cake, and champagne. I'm all for parties.'\n\nMary also recently revealed that she plays tennis every week – as long as it's sunny.\nAs well as her hugely successful career as a chef, Mary and her husband Paul Hunnings also welcomed three children; Thomas, William and Annabel.\nWilliam tragically died in a car accident in 1989 when he was 19. Annabel was in the car also but survived.\nMary recently shared how she and Paul were 'lucky to have him' and they got to be a 'family unit' right up until 'those few hours' before he died.\nGreat British Bake OffMary BerryBBC\n\nShare or comment on this article: \nNational treasure Dame Mary Berry 'lines up special new BBC project to celebrate her milestone 90th birthday'\n\nAdd comment\n\n Share what you think\n\nWorst rated\n\nThe comments below have not been moderated.\n\nThe views expressed in the contents above are those of our users and do not necessarily reflect the views of MailOnline.\n\nAdd your comment\n\nEnter your comment\n\nBy posting your comment you agree to our house rules.\n\nSubmit Comment\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual.\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual\n\nWe will automatically post your comment and a link to the news story to your Facebook timeline at the same time it is posted on MailOnline.

The party has been plagued with infighting and finger pointing following Democrats' loss to President Donald Trump and Republicans in last year's election.Ocasio-Cortez, 35, is floated by many analysts as a possible 2028 contender. Meanwhile, she and Sanders, 83, have held a series of massive rallies as part of \"Fighting Oligarchy\" tour across the country, including in states and districts won by Trump. Due to Sanders' age, most analysts do not believe the progressive senator is a likely 2028 contender.What to KnowMcCarthy, a Trump ally who resigned from Congress in 2023, appeared on HBO's Real Time with Bill Maher on Friday. During the show, Maher asked the former GOP congressman who he sees as the Democratic Party's 2028 presidential ticket.\"Right now? Bernie and AOC,\" McCarthy responded quickly.Maher expressed skepticism, pushing back on the assessment.\"They've got the biggest crowds,\" McCarthy said. \"It won't sustain itself, but right now they [Democrats] have no leader.\"Sanders and Ocasio-Cortez are \"going to lead right now,\" the Republican added later in the segment. \"I'm just saying who's in the lead right now. I don't think that's how it ends up.\"When Maher pushed back on using crowd sizes as an indicator, McCarthy said \"it drives where the ideas are gonna go, it's gonna drive the money for a while.\"Some recent polls have shown Ocasio-Cortez in second place after former Vice President Kamala Harris. A survey by Quantus Insights carried out among 1,000 registered voters from April 21 to 23 showed Harris with 30 percent and Ocasio-Cortez in second place at 14 percent. Notably, Sanders registered at 6 percent in the same poll.What People Are SayingAlexandria Ocasio-Cortez when asked by a Fox News reporter last week about a possible presidential run: \"This moment isn't about campaigns, or elections, or about politics. It's about making sure people are protected, and we've got people that are getting locked up for exercising their First Amendment rights. We're getting 2-year-olds that are getting deported into cells in Honduras. We're getting people that are about to get kicked off of Medicaid. That, to me, is most important.\"Anna Bahr, Sanders' communications director, told Newsweek on Friday: \"Lifelong Republicans, Trump supporters, Independents, Democrats and people who have never been involved with politics have all turned out for the Fighting Oligarchy tour. We are not living in a 'left versus right' political paradigm anymore. It's 'the very top versus everyone else.'\"Senator Bernie Sanders on X, formerly Twitter, on April 29: \"At a time when Trump and his billionaire gang is attacking our democracy and ripping off the working class, we need leaders with the backbone to take them on.\"Billionaire Trump ally Elon Musk in an April 11 X post: \"Bernie is just fully communist.\"What Happens Next?Speculation about 2028 will continue, especially as Democratic candidates hold off on declaring their ambitions.Other prominent Democrats widely speculated to be weighing a run include former Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg, California Governor Gavin Newsom, Kentucky Governor Andy Beshear, Maryland Governor Wes Moore, Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer and Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro, among others.","summary":"\"They've got the biggest crowds,\" the former Republican House speaker said.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/bernie-sanders-aoc-currently-lead-2028-kevin-mccarthy-2067768","image":"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2638289/alexandria-ocasio-cortez-bernie-sanders.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-05-03 23:58:31","author":"Jason Lemon","authors":["Jason Lemon"],"language":"en","category":"entertainment","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.248},{"id":317561972,"title":"Mexico’s president says she rejected Trump’s plan to send US troops across the border","text":"MEXICO CITY (AP) — President Claudia Sheinbaum of Mexico said on Saturday that U.S. President Donald Trump proposed sending American troops into Mexico to help her administration fight drug trafficking but that she rejected it.\n\nHer remarks to supporters in eastern Mexico came in response to a Wall Street Journal article published the day before, describing a tense phone call last month in which Trump reportedly pressured her to accept a bigger role for the U.S. military in combating drug cartels in Mexico.\n\n“He said, ‘How can we help you fight drug trafficking? I propose that the United States military come in and help you.’ And you know what I said to him? ‘No, President Trump.’”\n\nShe added: “Sovereignty is not for sale. Sovereignty is loved and defended.”\n\nThe White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Sheinbaum’s remarks.\n\nThe U.S. military presence has increased steadily along its southern border with Mexico in recent months, following Trump’s order in January to increase the army’s role in stemming the flow of migrants.\n\nThe U.S. Northern Command has surged troops and equipment to the border, increased manned surveillance flights to monitor fentanyl trafficking along the border and sought expanded authority for U.S. Special Forces to work closely with Mexican forces conducting operations against cartels.\n\nTrump designated many of the gangs and cartels smuggling drugs into the U.S. as foreign terrorist organizations on Feb. 19, restricting their movements and lending law enforcement more resources to act against them.\n\nBut Sheinbaum’s hardline stance Saturday signaled that U.S. pressure for unilateral military intervention would put her and Trump on a collision course after months of cooperation on immigration and trade.\n\n“We can work together, but you in your territory and us in ours,” Sheinbaum said.\n\nTo a burst of applause, she added: “We will never accept the presence of the United States military in our territory.”","summary":"The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Sheinbaum’s remarks.","url":"https://www.mercurynews.com/2025/05/03/mexicos-president-says-she-rejected-trumps-plan-to-send-us-troops-across-the-border/","image":"https://www.mercurynews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Mexico_US_63421.jpg?w=1024&h=683","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-05-03 23:58:12","author":"Associated Press","authors":["Associated Press"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.348},{"id":317560332,"title":"Oasis 'drops inappropriate song from reunion tour setlist' after link to disgraced pop star","text":"Black Friday\n\nKim Kardashian\n\nVictoria Beckham\n\nHarry Styles\n\nAmanda Holden\n\nBritain's Got Talent\n\nPrivacy Policy\n\nSunday, May 4th 2025\n\n5-Day Forecast\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe country that has cut asylum claims by 90% by banning the burkha and refusing benefits to migrants who don't learn their language, revealed by SUE REID\n\nMost Brits say strip Harry and Meghan of their HRH titles after bombshell interview as backlash grows - amid palace anger at BBC for failing to challenge Duke\n\nClose friend of the King reveals trust in Prince Harry's ability to keep private family conversations private means Charles CAN'T reconcile with him - as his own former protection officer blasts Duke's stitch up comment as offensive\n\nHarry's 'olive branch' is dripping in poison... and I know the real reason he always wants to play the victim: SARAH VINE\n\n'Gaslighting': Insiders' withering verdict on Harry's truce-ending broadside as they tell REBECCA ENGLISH of King's pain and that the Royals will now NEVER forgive him\n\nLabour rebels tell PM: change or die - as voters tell MoS poll they expect Farage to be the next Prime Minister\n\nThe Beckhams have arrived!

'He has said ''I'm going to die in jail now,'' and is resigned to it.\n'He would be almost 87 by the time his sentence ends and knows the effect being inside can have on your health.'\nThe song’s removal follows a major Oasis tour decision by Noel and Liam - one that hints the brothers still haven’t fully buried the hatchet. \n\nThe song’s removal follows a major Oasis tour decision by Noel and Liam - one that hints the brothers still haven’t fully buried the hatchet\n\nOasis sensationally split in 2009 after a backstage bust-up - devastating their loyal fan base. \nIn the 14 years that have followed, a feud and bitter fighting has ensued with the brothers trading insults back and forth in interviews and social media.\nBut this year, the pair are reuniting for a huge world tour, and have dates booked across the UK, America, South America and Asia in 2025.\nDespite the highly-anticipated reunion, it appears the Liam and Noel haven't put all of their differences behind them.\nA source, who has a guest list ticket for one of the shows in Heaton Park, claimed they will be spending time separately following the shows.\n\n Noel and Liam Gallagher make huge Oasis tour decision that suggests they still aren't getting along \nThey told The Sun: 'You might be seeing Oasis on stage but you will not be seeing Liam and Noel together afterwards.\n'Each of them had a VIP list where their friends and famous fans could buy their tickets.\n'But depending on which brother you got your ticket off, it's their green room and after-party you're invited to.\n'It's gutting for people who want to hang out with both of them but it seems they're keeping it all at a distance.'\nDespite the separate parties, the duo seem to be working well together, with Liam telling his fans he's loved working with Noel again.\nAnd Noel feels the same, saying of his sibling: 'He's alright, he's on tip-top form.'\nMailOnline has contacted Oasis' representatives for comment.\nThe Oasis Live 25 tour kicks off on 4 July at Cardiff's Principality Stadium before playing sell-out gigs at Manchester's Heaton Park, Wembley Stadium in London, and Edinburgh's Murrayfield stadium.\nThe Brit pop band will then head over to America, South America and Asia in 2025.\n\nOasis Live 25 tour dates\n\n4th - Cardiff, Principality Stadium\n5th - Cardiff, Principality Stadium\n11th - Manchester, Heaton Park\n12th - Manchester, Heaton Park\n16th - Manchester, Heaton Park \n19th - Manchester, Heaton Park\n20th - Manchester, Heaton Park\n25th - London, Wembley Stadium\n26th - London, Wembley Stadium\n30th - London, Wembley Stadium \nAUGUST 2025\n2nd - London, Wembley Stadium\n3rd - London, Wembley Stadium\n8th - Edinburgh, Murrayfield\n9th - Edinburgh, Murrayfield\n12th - Edinburgh, Murrayfield\n16th - Dublin, Croke Park \n17th - Dublin, Croke Park\nSEPTEMBER 2025\n27th - London, Wembley Stadium\n28th - London, Wembley Stadium \nOasisGary GlitterNoel Gallagher\n\nShare or comment on this article: \nOasis 'drops inappropriate song from reunion tour setlist' after link to disgraced pop star\n\nAdd comment\n\n Share what you think\n\nNo comments have so far been submitted.

Then Cyclone Donald crashed through Australia’s election","text":"The turnaround from the beginning of this year has been rapid and remarkable. As Trump’s second inauguration approached on January 20, centre-left parties were grasping for relevance. In an era of high inflation, incumbency had become a curse and left-wing governments were in an especially grim position. Conservative populism was in the ascendancy. Canada’s progressive prince, Justin Trudeau, announced his retirement in January as a beleaguered, unpopular figure. And Labor was falling behind the Coalition in the polls, raising the likelihood of a Dutton prime ministership.\n\n“Social democratic parties across the world are in disarray,” Emma Dawson, the head of the progressive Per Capita think tank, said in January. Public intellectual Clive Hamilton, who founded the left-wing Australia Institute, argued, “there is clearly something profound going on” in global politics. “There’s no doubt that social democratic parties are struggling to sustain their votes,” Hamilton said.\n\nIndeed, something profound is happening in global politics, but the opposite of what seemed to be the case just a few months ago. Trump’s radical and in many ways frightening return to office has breathed new life into centre-left parties and laid a booby trap for conservative leaders. Dutton was never a Trump clone, and notably called him out for berating Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. But he dabbled in MAGA-style politics by appointing Jacinta Price to an Elon Musk-style government efficiency role, and praised Trump as shrewd and a “big thinker” when he proposed his bizarre plan to turn Gaza into the “Riviera of the Middle East”.\n\nEven before any votes had been counted on Saturday night, Liberal frontbencher James Paterson was singling out the Trump factor as a decisive reason for the Coalition’s loss. “I think it has been significant,” Paterson said of Trump’s electoral impact. Of the temptation to echo Trump-style politics, Liberal National senator James McGrath warned late on Saturday night: “We must resist that path.”","summary":"Albanese’s victory will be interpreted around the world as a repudiation of Trumpism and the latest sign of a revival of social democratic politics. ","url":"https://www.theage.com.au/politics/federal/first-it-was-canada-then-cyclone-donald-crashed-through-australia-s-election-20250503-p5lwbt.html","image":"https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.5174%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_21/t_crop_custom/q_86%2Cf_auto/3703160c4b1ff3179d8bdd2f87ec2d5e6aba87bad5902ccc8cbed70ec1fce0bd","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-05-03 23:49:20","author":"Matthew Knott","authors":["Matthew Knott"],"language":"en","source_country":"au","sentiment":-0.125},{"id":317558280,"title":"Trump criticised after posting AI image of himself as Pope","text":"US President Donald Trump has attracted criticism from some Catholics after posting an AI-generated image of himself as the Pope.\n\nThe picture, which was shared by official White House social media accounts, comes as Catholics mourn the death of Pope Francis, who died on 21 April, and prepare to choose the next pontiff.\n\nThe New York State Catholic Conference accused Trump of mocking the faith.

Do not mock us.”\n\nLeft-leaning Italian former Prime Minister Matteo Renzi also blasted Trump’s post.\n\n“This is an image that offends believers, insults institutions and shows that the leader of the right-wing world enjoys clowning around,” Renzi wrote in Italian on X.\n\nBut the White House rejected any suggestion that the Republican president was making fun of the papacy.\n\n“President Trump flew to Italy to pay his respects to Pope Francis and attend his funeral, and he has been a staunch champion for Catholics and religious liberty,” said press secretary Karoline Leavitt.","summary":"Trump&#8217;s AI image as Pope draws backlash amid Vatican preparations for new papal election Featured Graphic.com.gh International News May &#8211; 03 &#8211; 2025 , 23:45 2 minutes read US President Donald Trump has attracted criticism from some Catholics after posting an AI-generated image of himself as the Pope.

Now it seems unlikely that broadcasters will return to work until the case has been resolved by the courts.\n\nA Saturday ruling by a divided DC circuit court panel essentially decided that the courts must defer to the executive branch on employment matters. Judges Neomi Rao and Gregory Katsas – both Trump appointees – found that the lower court likely did not have jurisdiction to order the employees back to work. Their ruling paused the part of the lower court order requiring the administration “take all necessary steps to return USAGM employees and contractors to their status prior” to the executive order.\n\nJudge Nina Pillard, an Obama appointee, in her dissent on Saturday, said the decision was tantamount to “silencing Voice of America for the foreseeable future”.\n\nVoA was effectively shut down after Trump signed an order on 14 March dismantling or shrinking seven agencies including the US Agency for Global Media (USAGM).\n\nThe USAGM is an independent government agency that oversees VoA and distributes congressionally appropriated funds to several non-profit broadcasters that provide news and information in almost 50 languages in countries with limited or no access to independent media sources.\n\nRelated: ‘A cocktail for a misinformed world’: why China and Russia are cheering Trump’s attacks on media\n\nAfter nearly every affected network sued, US district judge Royce Lamberth, a Ronald Reagan appointee, granted a preliminary injunction in late April, ruling that the executive order was arbitrary and likely exceeded the president’s authority.\n\nThe Department of Justice appealed. On Thursday, a Washington DC federal appeals court, which included two Trump appointees, partly upheld the lower court ruling that would have enabled VoA to resume broadcasting while the appeal played out.\n\nVoA staff would have been able to begin a “phased return” to the office and resume programming next week, according to an email from the justice department shared with the Washington Post. Some VoA and USAGM staff had had access to their government email accounts restored.\n\nBut that ruling was bad news for the other publicly funded broadcasters.\n\nThe Trump administration’s freeze on congressionally approved funds for Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty, Radio Free Asia and Middle East Broadcasting Networks will remain in place while the lawsuit makes its way through the court.\n\nWhile VoA is a federal entity, the other broadcasters are private non-profit organizations. The funding freeze has already forced them to make staffing cuts and reduce content.\n\nThe USAGA had, until now, enjoyed bipartisan support, due to the vital role VoA and the other foreign-news broadcasters play in advancing democracy and US interests by reaching about 360 million people in countries that have little to no independent press.\n\nThe Guardian has contacted both the USAGA and VoA for comment.\n\nDiana Ramirez-Simon contributed to this report","url":"https://uk.news.yahoo.com/voice-america-resume-airing-court-142518881.html","image":"https://media.zenfs.com/en/theguardian_763/3eb3fa30ff088fbe9a883d66a3f4f087","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-05-03 23:29:23","author":"Nina Lakhani","authors":["Nina Lakhani"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.556},{"id":317559760,"title":"World News | International Students in Alabama Fearful After Researcher with No Political Ties is Detained","text":"Tuscaloosa, May 4 (AP) Sama Ebrahimi Bajgani and her fiance, Alireza Doroudi, had just spent an evening celebrating the Persian new year at the University of Alabama when seven armed immigration officers came to their apartment before dawn and arrested Doroudi.

Doroudi is among students across the U.S. who have been detained in recent weeks as part of President Donald Trump's immigration crackdown. Bajgani said the couple does not know why Doroudi — who has no criminal record or public political views — faces deportation, adding that Trump's recent visit to the school made her feel like the university was “ignorant of our crisis.” One Iranian civil engineering student and close friend to Doroudi said he has lost over 10 pounds (4.5 kilograms) due to stress and depression in the six weeks since Doroudi was detained. “It's like all of us are waiting for our turn. It could be every knock, every email could be deportation,” said the student, who spoke on condition of anonymity because of concerns about losing his legal status. He now avoids unnecessary trips outside. When he was in a car crash last month, he begged the other driver not to call the police, even though he wasn't at fault, because he didn't want to draw attention to himself. I stayed with their permission Bajgani said Doroudi, 32, is an ambitious mechanical engineering student from Shiraz, Iran. He entered the United States legally in January 2023 on a student visa. Bajgani said he often worked 60-hour weeks while still making time to run errands for loved ones. “If someone like him doesn't get to the place he deserves, there is nothing called the American dream,” she said. Doroudi's visa was revoked in June 2023, but the embassy didn't provide a reason and ignored his inquiries, Bajgani said. The university told him he could stay as long as he remained a student but that would not be allowed to reenter the U.S. if he left, she said. He was operating under that guidance when immigration officers came to the couple's door in March. The University of Alabama didn't comment on Doroudi's case, but said it offers resources to help immigrants on campus comply with federal law. It also offers guidance to students whose visas are revoked. “Our international students are valued members of our campus community,” university spokesperson Monica Watts said in a statement. Doroudi told Bajgani he spent three days in a county jail, sleeping on a tile floor and feeling panicked. He is now in a Louisiana immigration detention facility over 300 miles (480 kilometers) from Tuscaloosa while he awaits a deportation hearing scheduled for next week. At least one other high-profile international student is there. “I didn't deserve this. If they had just sent me a letter asking me to appear in court, I would've come, because I didn't do anything illegal. I stayed with their permission,” Doroudi said in a letter he dictated to Bajgani over the phone to provide his perspective to others. “What was the reason for throwing me in jail?” Trump's immigration crackdown More than 1,000 international students across the U.S. have had their visas or legal status revoked since late March, according to an Associated Press review of university statements and correspondence with school officials. They included some who protested Israel's war in Gaza. Immigration and Customs Enforcement has since reversed those revocations, including those of four University of Alabama students. “University staff closely monitors changes that could affect them and has communicated updates related to new protocols and procedures,” Watts said. A Louisiana judge who denied Doroudi bond in mid-April said he didn't sufficiently prove that he wasn't a national security threat, Doroudi's lawyer, David Rozas said. Rozas said he was “flabbergasted” because the government hasn't presented evidence that Doroudi is a threat, though that is what the Department of Homeland Security has alleged. A familiar sense of fear International students make up over 13% of the statewide University of Alabama graduate program, according to the school's website. Over 100 Iranian students attend the university, according to an estimate from the Iranian Student Association. Every year, many gather for a picnic to celebrate Sizdah Bedar, the thirteenth day of the Persian new year, which begins with spring. This year, the typically festive holiday \"felt like a funeral service,” one Iranian doctoral student said. At one point, silence fell over the group as a police car passed. \"It's becoming too hard to be living here, to be yourself and thrive,\" said the student, who spoke on condition of anonymity because she fears retaliation. She has criticized the Iranian regime since arriving in the United States over five years ago, so she suspects she is no longer safe in her home country. Now, she has those same doubts in Alabama. “All of a sudden it feels like we're returning back to Iran again,” she said.

The event was carried live by at least one Austin TV station.\n\n“Gone are the days that families are limited to only the school assigned by government,” said Abbott, moments before signing. “The day has arrived that empowers parents to chose the school that is best for their child.”\n\nThe bill will help parents pay for accredited private school tuition and school-related expenses.

Homeschoolers can receive up to $2,000 per year.\n\nThe money will flow to families through education savings accounts, which essentially function as state-managed bank accounts.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nTexas Gov.

Daily masses and prayers are being held through May 4 in honor of Francis who died on Easter Monday aged 88.His funeral on April 26 in St. Peter's Square brought together heads of state, including Trump, religious leaders from around the world, and the general public. His body was laid to rest in St. Mary Major, one of the four papal basilicas in Rome.Trump's post also comes just days after the president, who is not Catholic, jokingly told reporters that he would \"like to be pope,\" saying \"that would be my number one choice.\" Trump has also vowed to make American \"more religious.\"What To Know On Friday evening, Trump posted an AI-photo of himself in a white cassock and a Mitre hat with a large gold cross around his neck. The White House's official X, formerly Twitter, account republished the photo on Saturday.The post reportedly was the topic of several questions during the Vatican's daily conclave briefing on Saturday, with local outlets calling it offensive, according to the Associated Press.Former Italian Prime Minister Matteo Renzi, now a senator for Florence, criticized the image in a post on X, formerly Twitter, writing that it \"offends believers, insults institutions and shows that the leader of the right-wing world enjoys clowning around.\"New York State's Catholic Conference also condemned Trump's post, calling it offensive and mocking.\"There is nothing clever or funny about this image, Mr. President,\" the group wrote in an X post. \"We just buried our beloved Pope Francis and the cardinals are about to enter a solemn conclave to elect a new successor of St. Peter. Do not mock us.\"The Archbishop of New York, Cardinal Timothy Dolan, has been tapped by Trump to serve on a newly created presidential commission on religious liberty. Newsweek has reached filed out an online contact request for Dolan on Saturday.American Jesuit priest and writer James Martin said he found the image \"deeply offensive\" in an X post, writing: \"Jesuits are always supposed to give people the benefit of the doubt. So even though I find this deeply offensive, I will presume that Mr. Trump meant this light-heartedly (even though he had just recently returned from Pope Francis's Funeral Mass, and he has a Catholic Vice President who met with Francis the day before his death).\"Martin added: \"But imagine the incandescent outrage, the swift condemnation, and the individual and joint protests from the US bishops if this had been done by Joe Biden or Barack Obama.\"Trump ally, Senator Lindsey Graham, who is not a Catholic but a Southern Baptist, praised the photo, writing \"seeing is believing! A picture is worth a thousand words...\"A Pew Research Center survey conducted April 7–13 during Trump's first 100 days in office found Catholic opinion divided on his performance. Among 367 Catholic adults polled, 38 percent said he was doing an excellent or good job, 17 percent said fair, and 43 percent said poor. The poll had a margin of error of plus or minus 5.5 percentage points.The same survey found that 72 percent of white evangelical Protestants approved of Trump's job performance.The president's post also led to a slew of memes and jokes on the matter.What People Are SayingWhite House Secretary Karoline Leavitt told the Associated Press when asked about the criticism: \"President Trump flew to Italy to pay his respects for Pope Francis and attend his funeral, and he has been a staunch champion for Catholics and religious liberty.\"Michael Steele, a Roman Catholic, former chair of the Republican National Committee (RNC) and Trump critic who now is a MSNBC host, wrote in an X post Saturday: \"During this period of Novemdiales (mourning the loss of Pope Francis) I'll set this offense aside because Trump in his narcissism gets off on our being offended. More to the point, this affirms how unserious and incapable he is. At 78 he remains a 10yo child, emotionally scarred and broken while desperate to prove he could be somebody. His problem: he can't grow up to prove it.\"Senator Lindsey Graham posted to X on Saturday: \"Glad to report there is very positive reception and strong momentum for President Trump to be the next Pope.

Mitch McConnell after the 83-year-old announced his retirement in February. \n\nMcConnell served Kentucky since 1984, and according to businessman Nate Morris, ‘The last thing Kentucky needs is another puppet for Mitch McConnel running for office.’ \n\n‘If you’re asking for a permission slip to run for office here in Kentucky from Mitch McConnell, then you shouldn’t be running in the first place,’ Morris said on X. \n\nMorris has also been touted as a possible contender, and according to a veteran GOP political consultant Jennings’ might have good standing with Trump, but that doesn’t mean he’ll get the job.\n\n‘I can’t imagine Trump endorsing Jennings against Morris, even if Jennings is a good TV presence,’ they told the outlet. \n\nOn Tuesday evening, Jennings, 47, joined Trump on stage during a Michigan rally celebrating the president’s first 100 days in the White House.\n\nTrump gave Jennings a generous introduction to the boisterous, partisan Michigan crowd. \n\n‘We have a man here that I don’t know but he’s defending me all the time on CNN and he defends me really well,’ Trump said.\n\nThe president joked that Jennings ‘can’t take it too far’ but added that it’s ‘amazing’ how he can ‘take it right to the edge’ for their left-leaning audience.\n\n‘He really does a good job. I think he’s terrific,’ Trump said before bringing him up.\n\nAs he waited for Jennings to make it to the stage, he joked about what it would mean for his career at CNN: ‘This is the end of Scott!’\n\nHe then embraced Jennings and allowed him to speak briefly to the assembled crowd.\n\nJennings told the crowd: ‘Michigan, we were flying in here today and I said “look at these farms!” I gotta’ get a farm in Michigan cause when you own as many libs as I do, you gotta’ get a place to put them all!’ \n\nHe then thanked the audience and gave a final handshake to a beaming Trump. \n\nThe father-of-four and grandson of a Democrat-elected official has recently made headlines for his opposing Republican views on CNN’s NewsNight.\n\n‘Often the show sort of comes down to several people versus Scott. Part of my job here is to honestly help translate from Red America,’ Jennings previously told The Wall Street Journal. \n\nHis coverage of President Trump’s re-election, and his defense of his policies and allies, has welcomed the Republican party viewpoint to CNN – boosting the outlet’s ratings and viewership.\n\nIn June, prior to the show turning to a round table discussion format, NewsNight averaged 485,000 viewers. So far this year, the show attracted about 500,000 viewers, WSJ reported. \n\nIn July alone, the show brought in 669,000 viewers, and in October, just before the election, it attracted 717,000. \n\nAlthough some of his critics have torn into Jennings for the apparent shift, CNN host Van Jones has branded Jennings a ‘genius’ that Republicans who tune into CNN ‘love to hate.’\n\n‘The genius of Scott is that he somehow has managed to be the Republican that all CNN watchers love to hate,’ the processive Democrat said, adding, ‘Emphasis on the love.’\n\nJennings previously served as a White House aide, reporting to Karl Rove, and was a longtime advisor to Senator McConnell who aided in several re-election campaigns and also helped Bush win New Mexico in the 2004 election. \n\nOutside of his job at CNN, Jennings is also a contributing columnist for Daily Mail, helps lead RunSwitch PR in his home state – a crisis communications firm – and recently joined the Los Angeles Times’ editorial board.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nCNN&#8217;s Scott Jennings might soon say goodbye to the station, but his&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: CNN Analyst Scott Jennings Plans Bold Career Shift That May Ruffle Liberal Feathers first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/world-news/cnn-analyst-scott-jennings-plans-bold-career-shift-that-may-ruffle-liberal-feathers/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/rewrite-this-title-CNNs-Scott-Jennings-could-run-to-become.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-05-03 23:21:38","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.092},{"id":317554926,"title":"Donald Trump fired national security adviser Mike Waltz for 'plotting with Israel's leader to bomb Iran'","text":"President Donald Trump sacked his national security adviser Mike Waltz because he was plotting with Israel's leader to attack Iran, it was claimed last night.\n\nWaltz, 51, was thought to have been fired because he accidentally added a journalist to a Signal chat about plans to attack Yemen's Houthi terrorist group, causing global embarrassment for the Trump administration.\n\nBut last night the Washington Post reported the real reason for Trump's ire was that Waltz huddled with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu during the latter's White House visit in February and 'appeared to share the Israeli leader's conviction that the time was ripe to strike Iran,' according to a source.\n\nTrump was angered that Waltz 'engaged in intense coordination with Netanyahu about military options against Iran ahead of an Oval Office meeting between the Israeli leader and Trump.'\n\nThe source said: 'Waltz wanted to take US policy in a direction Trump wasn't comfortable with because the US hadn't attempted a diplomatic solution. \n\nIt got back to Trump and the president wasn't happy with it.

Ảnh: THX/TTXVN\n\nTheo bình luận của tạp chí Wall Street Journal ngày 2/5, Trung Quốc dường như đang trên đường giành chiến thắng trong cuộc chiến thương mại với Mỹ, dù có vẻ đối mặt với những thách thức nhất định. Điều này nghe có vẻ nghịch lý, nhưng khi phân tích sâu hơn, chúng ta có thể thấy rõ lợi thế thực sự của Trung Quốc trong cuộc đối đầu này.\n\n Cuộc đối đầu bất cân xứng về thời gian\n\nLợi thế lớn nhất của Trung Quốc so với Mỹ trong cuộc chiến thương mại này chính là yếu tố thời gian. Chủ tịch Trung Quốc Tập Cận Bình không phải đối mặt với áp lực từ cử tri như Tổng thống Trump, người chỉ có không quá 18 tháng để chứng minh rằng chiến lược thuế quan của mình mang lại hiệu quả trước cuộc bầu cử giữa nhiệm kỳ năm 2026.\n\nMặc dù thông tin gần đây cho thấy nền kinh tế Trung Quốc đang gặp khó khăn – Chỉ số quản lý mua hàng chính thức ghi nhận mức giảm mạnh nhất trong 16 tháng, báo hiệu suy giảm sản xuất và có báo cáo về việc các nhà máy chậm sản xuất, công nhân bị sa thải hoặc cho nghỉ phép – nhưng Bắc Kinh có thể chịu đựng “cơn bão” này lâu hơn Washington.\n\nThoạt nhìn, điều này có vẻ như chứng minh cho tuyên bố từ các quan chức của chính quyền Trump như Bộ trưởng Tài chính Scott Bessent, người cho rằng Mỹ nắm giữ “hầu hết các lá bài trong một ván bài thương mại” toàn cầu. “Hãy nhớ rằng lịch sử thương mại là chúng ta là quốc gia thâm hụt. Quốc gia thâm hụt có lợi thế. Họ là các quốc gia thặng dư. Theo truyền thống, các quốc gia thặng dư luôn thua bất kỳ loại leo thang thương mại nào”, ông Bessent phát biểu vào ngày 2/4 sau thông báo về thuế quan “Ngày giải phóng” của Tổng thống Trump.\n\nTuy nhiên, Wall Street Journal dẫn nhận định của các chuyên gia cho rằng: “Hệ thống chính trị Trung Quốc cho phép nước này vượt qua cuộc chiến thương mại ít nhất là sau cuộc bầu cử giữa nhiệm kỳ của Mỹ”.\n\nVideo đang HOT\n\n Khả năng kích thích kinh tế dài hạn\n\nTrung Quốc vẫn còn lá bài quan trọng chưa sử dụng: khả năng triển khai các gói kích thích kinh tế quy mô lớn. Chính quyền Trung Quốc có thể chuyển tiề.n tài trợ bằng nợ cho các hộ gia đình và doanh nghiệp để thúc đẩy tiêu dùng, hoặc mở rộng tín dụng để ngăn chặn tình trạng phá sản của doanh nghiệp và tài trợ cho các công trình công cộng.\n\nNhững biện pháp như vậy đã trở thành công cụ chính của Bắc Kinh để duy trì tăng trưởng kinh tế trong những năm gần đây. Với việc thuế quan 145% của chính quyền Trump bắt đầu có hiệu lực, một gói kích thích kinh tế mới dường như là điều không thể tránh khỏi nếu cuộc chiến thương mại tiếp tục kéo dài.\n\nKiểm soát chặt chẽ vốn và tín dụng trong nước là một lợi thế khác của Trung Quốc. Điều này cho phép các nhà hoạch định chính sách ngăn chặn các dấu hiệu bất bình thường của tình trạng khó khăn về kinh tế, chẳng hạn như tình trạng mất khả năng thanh toán, miễn là họ cho rằng cần thiết.\n\nTrong khi đó, “đòn bẩy” chiến tranh thương mại của Mỹ chỉ có thể được khai thác bằng cách buộc người tiêu dùng Mỹ trả nhiều tiề.n hơn cho hàng hóa. Thị trường đã nhanh chóng nhận ra điều này, khiến chỉ số chứng khoán S&P 500 ghi nhận hiệu suất 100 ngày đầu tiên tệ nhất dưới thời Trump so với bất kỳ tổng thống nào trong 5 thập kỷ qua.\n\n Chủ tịch Trung Quốc Tập Cận Bình (trái) trong lễ đón chính thức Tổng thống Mỹ Donald Trump tới thăm Bắc Kinh ngày 9/11/2017.

Những người đã bỏ phiếu cho ông Trump với hy vọng kiểm soát lạm phát sẽ thất vọng khi thấy giá cả hàng hóa tiếp tục tăng. Đảng Cộng hòa chỉ có chưa đầy 18 tháng để chứng minh rằng chiến lược thuế quan mang lại hiệu quả, nếu không họ sẽ gặp khó khăn trong cuộc bầu cử giữa nhiệm kỳ năm 2026.\n\nMặc dù có lợi thế ngắn hạn, Wall Street Journal lưu ý, Trung Quốc vẫn phải đối mặt với những thách thức dài hạn. Thuế quan ở mức cao của chính quyền Trump ngụ ý sự tách rời của hai nền kinh tế, điều này có thể để lại lỗ hổng 300 tỷ USD hoặc nhiều hơn trong nền kinh tế Trung Quốc.\n\nCác gói kích thích kinh tế sẽ không thể thay thế vĩnh viễn nhu cầu mất đi từ thị trường Mỹ. Ngoài ra, khả năng chơi trò chờ đợi của Trung Quốc chỉ là một lợi thế chiến thuật chứ không phải chiến lược. Tuy nhiên, Tổng thống Trump đã chọn theo đuổi chính sách thương mại mang tính chiến thuật hơn là chiến lược, vô tình tạo điều kiện cho Bắc Kinh tận dụng lợi thế về thời gian.\n\nTóm lại, cuộc chiến thương mại giữa Mỹ và Trung Quốc không phải là một cuộc đối đầu cân sức. Trong khi Mỹ có sức mạnh kinh tế to lớn, Trung Quốc lại có khả năng chịu đựng các cú sốc ngắn hạn và duy trì ổn định trong thời gian dài hơn. Với khả năng kiểm soát chặt chẽ nền kinh tế và không phải lo lắng về áp lực từ cử tri, Bắc Kinh có thể duy trì nền kinh tế của mình cho đến giữa nhiệm kỳ bầu cử ở Mỹ – có lẽ đó là tất cả những gì họ cần để giành chiến thắng trong cuộc chiến thương mại với Mỹ thời Trump.\n\nTrung Quốc đặt điều kiện đàm phán thương mại với Mỹ Phía Trung Quốc đã đưa ra một số điều kiện để đàm phán thương mại với Mỹ trong bối cảnh căng thẳng leo thang giữa hai quốc gia liên quan thuế quan.

At the Pentagon, Trump is calling for a massive jump in spending - a 13% increase to $1.01 trillion -- almost entirely via allocations in a congressional budget reconciliation plan. The jump would happen while many other federal agencies would be slashed, in part to supercharge federal spending in two areas where SpaceX is positioned to profit - a vast missile defence system and space missions to Mars and the moon.Trump has proposed a Golden Dome defense system to track and kill missiles headed toward US targets, possibly sent by China, Russia, North Korea or other rivals. Pentagon officials say SpaceX is considered likely to be the top recipient of this burst of new spending, because SpaceX manufactures both rockets that can launch military payloads into orbit and satellite systems that can deliver the surveillance and targeting tools needed for the project.Trump's budget plan also calls for an undisclosed but large amount of new money for \"US space dominance to strengthen national security.\"Nasa's budget faces overall cuts in Trump's plan -- down 24% from $24.8 billion in the current budget year-- but there are increases that largely match SpaceX's own corporation priorities. The spending plan goes after Musk's commercial rivals, calling for Nasa to phase out funding for the Space Launch System, a rocket program being led by Boeing, and also the Orion astronaut capsule, being built by Lockheed Martin, part of three planned flights to take humans back to the moon. Instead, Trump's budget calls for \"more cost effective commercial systems that would support more ambitious subsequent lunar missions,\" an industry that SpaceX now dominates. Jeff Bezos' Blue Origin, which has developed its own new rocket, also could be a big beneficiary of this shift, industry executives said Friday.","summary":"","url":"https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/trumps-space-budget-is-a-largesse-for-spacex/articleshow/120861589.cms","image":"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/resizemode-4,width-1280,height-720,msid-120861620/120861620.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-05-03 23:13:16","author":"Eric Lipton","authors":["Eric Lipton"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"in","sentiment":0.1},{"id":317558832,"title":"Outspoken Democrat Jasmine Crockett reveals what GOP colleagues really think about Trump tariffs","text":"As Donald Trump vows to push ahead with a sweeping tariff regime that blindsided allies, spooked markets, and left America's ports eerily quiet, one firebrand Democrat is revealing what many in the GOP really think, but are too afraid to say out loud.\n\nIn a fiery Friday night interview on CNN, Texas Democratic Rep. Jasmine Crockett, a progressive rising star and one of the most outspoken members of Congress, unleashed a bombshell.\n\nCrockett claims Republican lawmakers are privately seething over Trump's chaotic trade policy, but are too cowed by the MAGA machine to do anything about it.\n\n'It's absolutely insane,' Crockett said bluntly. 'Behind closed doors, they will talk about how these things are crazy… You can find plenty of Republicans that will tell you that these tariffs are a problem.' \n\nShe didn't name names but the fractures in the GOP's economic messaging are already beginning to show, with prominent figures like Senator Rand Paul, Senator Chuck Grassley, and Rep. Don Bacon publicly voicing opposition to Trump's latest trade salvos. \n\nBut Crockett revealed that there is far more dissent among the Republican party than the GOP would have voters believe. \n\n'They literally were silent,' Crockett added, describing recent committee hearings where Republican lawmakers refused to debate common-sense amendments.\n\n'It was almost like they were told, \"Don't say anything… we just have to vote down these common-sense amendments and get through this, because this is what we've been told to do.\"' \n\nCrockett's depiction of a party essentially frozen in fear comes amid growing fallout from Trump's tariff blitz - an economic gamble that has already been felt from the factory floor to the corner store.\n\nAt the Port of Los Angeles, the busiest gateway for goods entering the United States, the sound of cranes and thud of containers has given way to an unsettling silence.\n\nFor the week of May 4, traffic at the port is expected to plunge by up to 35% compared to this time last year. \n\nNeighboring Long Beach is projecting a 30% drop in imports for the month. Dozens of ships have cancelled their voyages.\n\nRetailers, manufacturers, and logistics operators have slammed on the brakes.\n\nShipments from China, still the largest source of US imports, have plummeted amid Trump's erratic tariff flip-flops, including levies as high as 145% on some goods.\n\n'You could hear a pin drop,' Port Director Gene Seroka said, calling it 'very unusual.' \n\n'Many retailers and manufacturers alike have hit the pause button,' Seroka warned. 'If this trade dispute goes on for any length of time, we'll likely see fewer selections on store shelves and online buying platforms.' \n\nConsumers are also about to feel it in higher prices, empty shelves, and fewer product choices. \n\nIn Southern California, where nearly a million logistics workers keep America's supply chains moving, frustration is boiling over.\n\nAntonio Montalbo, a small business owner running a trucking outfit near the ports, said his maintenance costs have doubled and that work has dried up. \n\n'We're angry at Donald Trump,' said the 37-year-old. 'He needs to go check out the country a little bit, because he has a lot of angry truck drivers.' \n\nA crucial engine part made in China now costs twice what it did just weeks ago.\n\nMontalbo voted for Trump in 2024, hoping for economic relief. What he got, he said, is worse than inflation.\n\n'Now we have something worse than inflation, called tariffs.' \n\nAnd yet, back in D.C., Trump continues to downplay the damage. \n\nWhen pressed in an NBC interview Friday on the looming recession warnings, Trump casually brushed off concerns.\n\n'Everything's OK,' he said. 'This is a transition period. I think we're going to do fantastically.' \n\nIt was an eerily upbeat assessment that flew in the face of reality. \n\nHours earlier, the Commerce Department reported the first quarterly GDP decline in three years. \n\nStill, Trump remains defiant and on his Truth Social, he doubled down.\n\n'We're only in a transition stage, just getting started!' he posted. \n\nBack on Capitol Hill, Crockett said the tariffs are just one example of how the GOP's public bravado masks private panic. \n\nRepublicans, she claims, are too terrified to confront Trump or to face their own constituents.\n\n'It seems like they do whatever [Donald Trump] wants them to do at all times,' Crockett said. \n\n'That's why they don't want to go out and listen to their constituents at their town halls.' \n\nIt's a damning allegation but one that resonates. Voter anger is rising across the country, particularly among small businesses and working-class Americans who feel abandoned.\n\n'They literally were silent,' Crockett said again. 'They're afraid to say anything, because they know they can't win.' \n\nMeanwhile, in hearings and legislative markups, the silence from Republicans has become deafening.\n\nBut behind the scenes, the dam may be starting to break.\n\nGrassley, the veteran Iowa senator, recently told Politico that Trump's tariff policy was 'misguided' and warned it could cripple American agriculture. \n\nRand Paul, a libertarian stalwart, has called for returning tariff power to Congress.\n\nEven Bacon, a centrist Republican from Nebraska, warned tariffs could 'hurt the very people we're trying to help.'\n\nBut unless more Republicans speak up publicly, Crockett warned, the economic damage will continue and the silence will be seen as complicity.\n\n'They know this is a disaster,' Crockett said. 'They just don't have the spine to say it.","summary":"Rep.

He pledged to work hard for the voters.\n\n “We are grateful for your strong mandate and… will honour the trust that you have given to us by working even harder for all of you,” said the 52-year-old premier.\n\n The Elections Department (ELD) said Singaporeans cast their votes for 92 out of 97 parliamentary seats at 1,240 polling stations island-wide to decide the future politics of Singapore.\n\n This was Singapore’s 19th election since the first general election in 1948 and 14th since its Independence in 1965.\n\n Wong, 52, was sworn-in last May as the new prime minister in 20 years after Lee Hsien Loong stepped down after almost two decades.\n\n There was vociferous campaigning by opposition political parties, raising issues related to high cost of living and housing as well as increasing presence of foreigners in almost all sectors of the economy in the manpower-short Singapore.\n\n Top PAP leaders were seen balancing their election schedules during the last nine days of campaigning since nominations closed on April 23 along with negotiating tariffs imposed by Singapore’s largest trading partner US.\n\n Singapore’s Deputy Prime Minister and Trade and Industry Minister Gan Kim Yong had been negotiating with his US counterparts on a 10 per cent tariff imposed on imports from Singapore.\n\n The PAP fielded candidates in all 92 constituencies, while its main rival, the Workers’ Party (WP), contested 26 seats in eight constituencies.\n\n The Progress Singapore Party (PSP) fielded 13 candidates across six constituencies. Other parties in the fray included the Singapore People’s Party (SPP), Singapore Democratic Party (SDP), People’s Power Party (PPP), People’s Alliance for Reform (PAR), Red Dot United (RDU), National Solidarity Party (NSP), Singapore United Party (SUP), and Singapore Democratic Alliance (SDA).\n\n Prime Minister Wong had urged Singaporeans to vote responsibly as the global economies are going through unprecedented challenges and led to uncertainties.\n\n The finance-trade-export focused city state sits in the middle of US-China trade war, having historical bilateral economic and diplomatic relations with both the giant markets, diplomatic sources said.\n\n Manufacturing activity in Singapore fell into recession territory in April 2025 as tariffs announced by US President Donald Trump triggered a wave of export-order deferments and cancellations.\n\n The purchasing managers’ index (PMI), a barometer of the manufacturing sector’s health, fell to 49.6 points in April, down one point from 50.6 in March; readings above 50 indicate growth while those below point to contraction.\n\n “The contraction in Singapore’s factory activity snaps 19 straight months of expansion,” reported The Straits Times, citing a Singapore Institute of Purchasing and Materials Management (SIPMM) report on Friday.\n\n Meanwhile, the PAP had a walkover in one constituency of five members of parliament at the close of nomination day on April 23.\n\n The PAP’s share of the popular vote slipped to a near-record low of 61 per cent in 2020 elections, down from nearly 70 per cent in 2015 and although it kept 83 out of 93 parliamentary seats, the opposition gained ground with a record 10 seats. \n\nPublished on May 4, 2025","summary":"This was Wong’s first election as prime minister since succeeding Lee Hsien Loong in 2024, and he called the win a “humbling experience,” vowing to work harder for Singaporeans. ","url":"https://www.thehindubusinessline.com/news/world/pm-wongs-pap-scores-landslide-victory-in-singapore-general-election/article69535974.ece","image":"https://bl-i.thgim.com/public/incoming/k0apvs/article69535975.ece/alternates/LANDSCAPE_1200/2025-05-03T183219Z_1262362565_RC2GAEA9UX9D_RTRMADP_3_SINGAPORE-ELECTION.JPG","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-05-03 23:08:49","author":null,"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"in","sentiment":0.101},{"id":317553872,"title":"Children's Ombudsman hugely concerned over use of AI 'nudify' apps on images of underage girls","text":"Advertisement\n\nWe need your help now\n\nSupport from readers like you keeps The Journal open.\n\nYou are visiting us because we have something you value.

others can be accessed via a web browser by anyone who has a URL to the relevant app.\n\nAlthough sharing non-consensual sexual images is a crime in Ireland under the Harassment, Harmful Communications and Related Offences Act (also known as Coco’s Law), legal experts have said the legislation does not cover the creation of deepfakes.\n\nTens of thousands of ads for these apps have appeared on Facebook and Instagram in recent months, and keep pushing the apps to Irish users despite Meta’s repeated attempts to remove them because they breach the company’s advertising rules.\n\n“The ease of access by children to this type of technology is a huge concern to the Ombudsman for Children’s Office (OCO),” Muldoon told The Journal.\n\n“It is difficult to comprehend any possible need for these apps when the risk of abuse and sexual exploitation of children is so high.”\n\nHe called for Coimisiún na Meán and the European Commission to strengthen the oversight of major technology companies under the Digital Services Act, to ensure that the apps were not being recommended to children and young people online.\n\nA spokesperson for Coimisiún na Meán said that the Online Safety Framework makes big tech platforms accountable for how they protect people, especially children, from harm online.\n\nThe European Commission’s spokesperson for tech sovereignty Thomas Regnier said that the commission is aware that ads for services to create pornographic deepfakes of women were present on Facebook and Instagram.\n\nHe also said large tech companies have an obligation to ensure measures are in place that mitigate risks to users.\n\nA spokesperson for Meta said the company prohibits the display of nudity or sexual activity in its ads and that the company removes ads that violate its policies, but that bad actors are continually evolving their tactics to avoid enforcement.\n\nOmbudsman for Children Dr Niall Muldoon has expressed concernRollingNews.ie\n\nRollingNews.ie\n\nNudification apps have already attained notoriety in other countries, including in the United States, where dozens of teenage girls have been targeted in schools in California, New Jersey and Washington. \n\nEarlier this week, the children’s commissioner for England called for the apps to be banned after publishing a report which found that deepfake nudification apps disproportionately target women and girls.\n\nThe report contained interviews from a number of teenage girls, some of whom said they had already changed their online behaviour as a result of nudification technology.\n\n“This chilling effect is causing them to take steps to keep themselves safe, which often requires them to limit their behaviour in some way,” the report said.\n\n“This pattern of behaviour is similar to girls avoiding walking home alone at night, or not going to certain public places alone.”\n\nThe Dublin Rape Crisis Centre previously said it was “deeply concerned” about the capacity of deepfake images to “amplify harm to women” and said they should not be available to download.\n\nWhat are nudification apps and how do they work?\n\nNudification apps can be downloaded via app stores (if they have not already been removed), or accessed via a web browser using a URL; certain bots on the messaging app Telegram also offer nudification services.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe apps encourage users to upload a photo of any woman, and offer to produce a new, deepfake version of the same image in which the person appears without clothes.\n\nThe apps are thought to have been trained using open-source artificial intelligence models in which the underlying code is freely available for anyone to copy, tweak and use for whatever purpose they want if they have the skills to do so.\n\nIn the case of nudification apps, the artificial intelligence works by creating new images that are based on their attempts to replicate existing images that they have been trained on.\n\nThey are specifically thought to have been trained from vast amounts of explicit images of women, which is why they tend to only work on women and teenage girls.\n\nThe artificial intelligence is unable to tell when a person is underage or that such images are illegal.\n\nGraphika, a US company that tracks online disinformation, has said that open-source AI models are “the primary driver” behind a surge in the creation and dissemination of non-consensual images of adults, including through the use of nudification apps.\n\nThe UK-based Internet Watch Foundation has also said that creators of child sexual abuse material have legally used open-source AI models to create explicit deepfake images of children.\n\nAn ad for a nudification app seen on FacebookMeta Ad Library\n\nMeta Ad Library\n\nDeepfake economy\n\nGraphika has also warned that nudification services and the creation of sexually explicit deepfake images has become a “fully-fledged online industry”, which some have dubbed the “deepfake economy”.\n\nNudification apps often seek payment to create deepfake images, while they can also be used as part of targeted harassment campaigns and for sextortion.\n\nIn many cases, links to nudification services can be found through Google searches.\n\nThe Journal has also uncovered thousands of targeted ads for nudification apps, which claim that apps can “erase” or “see through” the clothes of any woman, that are being pushed to Irish social media users on Facebook and Instagram on an ongoing basis.\n\nAdvertisements entice users by claiming “one click to undress”, “upload image, you can see anything about her” and “your friends in transformed photos”.\n\nThe ads link to app stores, where AI editing apps can be downloaded, and third-party websites that can be accessed by anyone with a URL that links to the relevant website. \n\nThey often feature side-by-side images of a woman with clothes on and the same image of the woman naked or partly naked; other ads feature videos of women dancing or talking, which occasionally flash in a way that the woman appears with no clothes.\n\nSome versions of the ads use AI-generated images of women, but others use images of real women that appear to be taken from social media.\n\nThe ads tend to feature on fake profiles that have small numbers of followers, but which appear to be somewhat co-ordinated: different pages will use the same names and images, or claim that they are based in similar locations.\n\nMany share different links that re-direct to the same website in an apparent attempt to avoid falling foul of Meta’s advertising rules.\n\nSince the beginning of April, The Journal has found dozens of pages that have advertised nudification services via more than 20 unique links, which re-direct users to a single web-based app.\n\nMeta has removed the majority of ads for these services, though some remain active; in some cases, the ads were only removed once they were flagged by The Journal while links to those that were not shared with Meta remained online.\n\nIf you have been affected by any of the issues mentioned in this article, you can reach out for support through the following helplines:\n\nDublin Rape Crisis Centre - 1800 77 8888 (fre, 24-hour helpline) \n\nSamaritans - 116 123 or email jo@samaritans.org (suicide, crisis support)\n\nPieta - 1800 247 247 or text HELP to 51444 – (suicide, self-harm)\n\nTeenline - 1800 833 634 (for ages 13 to 19)\n\nChildline - 1800 66 66 66 (for under 18s)\n\nReaders like you are keeping these stories free for everyone...\n\nA mix of advertising and supporting contributions helps keep paywalls away from valuable information like this article.\n\nOver 5,000 readers like you have already stepped up and support us with a monthly payment or a once-off donation.\n\nSupport The Journal\n\nStephen McDermott\n\nSend Tip or Correction\n\nEmbed this post\n\nTo embed this post, copy the code below on your site\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEmail “Children's Ombudsman hugely concerned over use of AI 'nudify' apps on images of underage girls”.\n\nRecipient's Email\n\nFeedback on “Children's Ombudsman hugely concerned over use of AI 'nudify' apps on images of underage girls”.\n\nYour Feedback\n\nYour Email (optional)\n\nReport a Comment\n\nPlease select the reason for reporting this comment.\n\nPlease give full details of the problem with the comment...\n\nArtificial Intelligence\nChild Safety\nChildren's Ombudsman\n\nNiall Muldoon\nNudification\nNudification apps\nThe Morning Lead\n\nNews in 60 seconds\n\nQuiz: How much do you know about tsars?\n\nApocalypse Kit Now\nWhat if Ireland had a power blackout?

According to the Anti-Defamation League, antisemitic incidents at colleges and universities rose by an alarming 700% between October 2022 and October 2023.Jewish students are being harassed, threatened, and sometimes even assaulted for expressing pride in their identity or for supporting Israel. At Columbia and Yale, flyers with Nazi imagery were distributed openly. At Cornell, a student was arrested after threatening to murder Jewish classmates. Jewish students are now being warned by friends and even university staff not to wear Stars of David, kippot, or other Jewish symbols in public for their own safety. North American students tell of campus antisemitism during Israel fact-finding mission. (credit: Hasbara Fellowships)The Trump administration is taking strong and clear action. While many political leaders issued vague or cautious statements, President Donald Trump made it known that antisemitism on campus would not be tolerated. His direct response stood out and reassured many Jewish students that their government was willing to defend them.However, focusing only on colleges overlooks a more serious problem. By the time students reach university, their beliefs and knowledge about antisemitism have already been shaped. Real progress requires addressing the issue much earlier, in elementary, middle, and high school classrooms. Holocaust education across the United States remains uneven and, in many places, deeply inadequate. A 2020 Claims Conference survey found that 63% of US millennials and Gen Z did not know that six million Jews were murdered during the Holocaust. Nearly half could not name even a single concentration camp.Even more alarming, 11% believed that Jews themselves caused the Holocaust. These are not minor gaps in knowledge; they represent a failure to educate students about one of the most tragic and important chapters in world history. When young people are left unaware of the facts, they become vulnerable to harmful lies and conspiracy theories.A LACK of education does not simply result in ignorance; it creates an environment where hatred can grow. Students who have never learned about antisemitism and the Holocaust are less likely to recognize when hatred is being normalized around them. They may not understand why certain words, symbols, or movements are dangerous. They may even be misled into thinking antisemitic ideas are justified.Teaching about the Holocaust is not just about preserving the memory of the past. It is about giving students the tools they need to stand up against hatred in the present.Education of the Holocaust must become a national priorityHolocaust education should become a national priority. Just as schools across the country teach students about safe driving, drug prevention, and civil rights history, they should also educate about antisemitism and the Holocaust with the same seriousness. A strong, consistent curriculum would help ensure that every student, no matter where they live, understands the dangers of antisemitism and why it must be opposed.Adopting a clear definition of antisemitism is also necessary. The International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance provides a definition that not only covers traditional forms of antisemitism but also explains when criticism of Israel becomes a cover for hatred against Jewish people. Schools that use this definition would be better prepared to recognize and respond to antisemitic incidents. Jewish students should receive the same protection and respect as students from any other minority group.America needs more than just minor changes; it needs a complete shift in how antisemitism is addressed in education. Every student – regardless of race, religion, or political belief – should graduate with a basic understanding of what antisemitism is, how it has evolved, and why it remains dangerous. Students do not have to be Jewish to understand why this matters. They only need a proper education built on truth and responsibility, not on guilt or political agendas.My parents fled a country where the government tried to erase their Jewish identity. They came here with the hope that their children could live freely, without hiding who they are. That hope must not be wasted.If American schools continue to ignore antisemitism until students reach college, it will already be too late. The real fight against antisemitism begins in the classroom – not just on campus.The writer is a high school student from Great Neck, New York, active in meaningful dialogue about US politics, international relations, and Israel as the Jewish homeland and a key US ally.","summary":"A 2020 Claims Conference survey found that 63% of US millennials and Gen Z did not know that six million Jews were murdered during the Holocaust.","url":"https://www.jpost.com/opinion/article-852468","image":"https://images.jpost.com/image/upload/q_auto/c_fill,g_faces:center,h_537,w_822/661535","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-05-03 23:03:58","author":"Gregory Lyakhov","authors":["Gregory Lyakhov"],"language":"en","source_country":"il","sentiment":0.296},{"id":317554930,"title":"Britain's Got Talent is hit by another fix row as show introduces controversial new element in semi-finals with fans left raging","text":"Black Friday\n\nKim Kardashian\n\nVictoria Beckham\n\nHarry Styles\n\nAmanda Holden\n\nBritain's Got Talent\n\nPrivacy Policy\n\nSaturday, May 3rd 2025\n\n5-Day Forecast\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe country that has cut asylum claims by 90% by banning the burkha and refusing benefits to migrants who don't learn their language, revealed by SUE REID\n\nMost Brits say strip Harry and Meghan of their HRH titles after bombshell interview as backlash grows - amid palace anger at BBC for failing to challenge Duke\n\nClose friend of the King reveals trust in Prince Harry's ability to keep private family conversations private means Charles CAN'T reconcile with him - as his own former protection officer blasts Duke's stitch up comment as offensive\n\nHarry's 'olive branch' is dripping in poison... and I know the real reason he always wants to play the victim: SARAH VINE\n\n'Gaslighting': Insiders' withering verdict on Harry's truce-ending broadside as they tell REBECCA ENGLISH of King's pain and that the Royals will now NEVER forgive him\n\nLabour rebels tell PM: change or die - as voters tell MoS poll they expect Farage to be the next Prime Minister\n\nThe Beckhams have arrived!

Email tips@dailymail.com \nBy DAILY MAIL REPORTER \n Published:23:55 BST, 3 May 2025 |Updated:00:02 BST, 4 May 2025 \n\nBritain's Got Talent has been hit by another fix row after a controversial new element was introduced in the semi-finals.\nThe Golden Buzzer has previously just been a fixture in the auditions, but an eyebrow-raising new concept has seen it also added to the semi-finals.\nGuitarist Olly Pearson, 11, secured the sought-after Golden Buzzer after Simon Cowell was left blown away by his performance.\nHe showcased his talents with an impressive guitar medley and made his way to the final alongside Stacey Leadbeatter, who secured the most public votes.\nHowever, viewers were left divided about the addition of the Golden Buzzer in the semi-finals, giving them a one-way ticket to the final.\n\nTonight saw Simon Cowell dish out a Golden Buzzer to 11-year-old phenomenon Olly early on in the show, meaning Cheer Re-man missed out\n\nOlly put on a show-stopping performance for the audience with an incredible rockstar medley, that earned him the approval of Simon\nTaking to X, fans were seething about the fact it could only be pressed once, with some declaring the whole thing as a 'fix'.\nComments included: 'This pile of rubbish needs to be renamed Britain's Got the Fix Factor, because there is NO WAY tonight's voting was accurate. No way #BGT';\n'Golden buzzer is clearly to fix #BGT'; 'Honestly get rid of that stupid golden buzzer! The audience should shut up! #BGT.'\nIn each semi-final, one of the judges or Ant & Dec can take control of the buzzer when they see a performance worthy of a place in the final.\nThey have just one opportunity to press it, meaning any acts which follow do not have the chance to secure the sought-after accolade.\nElsewhere in Saturday's second round of semi-finals, supermarket worker Stacey got through to the final after fearing she wouldn't be able to sing due to her health woes.\nThe singer impressed the judges in her audition and received a Golden Buzzer from KSI after being forced to retrain her voice due to a stutter.\n\nOver on X, fans were seething about the fact it could only be pressed once, with some declaring the whole thing as a 'fix'\n\nAn eyebrow-raising new concept means that the Golden Buzzer can only be given to one act during the semi-finals - and it had already been given by the time they performed\n\nStacey won the most public votes and advanced straight through the final alongside guitarist Olly \n\n BGT star Stacey Leadbeatter who was bullied for stuttering receives Golden Buzzer \nHowever, she reached a huge hurdle this week as she was struck down by strep throat, which left her fearing she might not be able to sing in the semi-finals.\nShe gave it her all at Wembley Arena in front of the judges - and has now landed her spot in the final, hoping for a chance to be crowned the winner.\nStacey won the most public votes and advanced straight through the final alongside guitarist Olly.\nShe beat out competition including Will Burns and Cheer Re Mans to the top slot, who narrowly missed out on their place in the final.\nSpeaking after the vote was revealed, Stacey said: 'Thank you so much for believing in me.'\nShe broke down in floods of tears and grabbed host Declan Donnelly for a hug as she was overwhelmed with emotion.\nJust hours before the semi-final, Stacey revealed her panic about potentially not being able to sing after being struck down by strep throat.\n'My voice is only just coming back,' she told The Mirror.\n'I am still actually on antibiotics. I haven't been able to sing properly. I have been a bit concerned about this weekend but, hopefully, I'll be able to do it.'\nThe semi-finals will continue next week with the finals set to wrap up the series at the end of the month. \nSimon CowellKSI\n\nShare or comment on this article: \nBritain's Got Talent is hit by another fix row as show introduces controversial new element in semi-finals with fans left raging\n\nAdd comment\n\n Share what you think\n\nWorst rated\n\nThe comments below have not been moderated.\n\nThe views expressed in the contents above are those of our users and do not necessarily reflect the views of MailOnline.\n\nAdd your comment\n\nEnter your comment\n\nBy posting your comment you agree to our house rules.\n\nSubmit Comment\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual.\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual\n\nWe will automatically post your comment and a link to the news story to your Facebook timeline at the same time it is posted on MailOnline.

led the Liberal Party to a historic defeat","text":"It seemed like a good idea at the time.\n\nOn Australia Day, with polls and betting markets predicting Peter Dutton was cruising to power, the Liberal leader said Jacinta Price would be minister for government efficiency in a Coalition government.\n\nThe Trump-inspired appointment thrilled many conservatives — Mr Dutton’s natural supporters — who hoped Senator Price would bring an Elon Musk-style chainsaw to what they considered wasteful Indigenous and other social programs.\n\nIn hindsight, it was a warning signal for Mr Dutton’s go-from-the-gut decision-making style: instead of years carefully planning detailed and well-crafted policies, the ex-policeman left important decisions late and seemed to make up answers during press conferences.\n\nOne of the Coalition’s most-important economic policies, a mortgage tax deduction for people living in their own homes, was agreed on after the campaign began on March 28, according to party sources.\n\nStarting ahead\n\nWhen Mr Dutton reshuffled his frontbench on January 25, his appointees might have expected they would soon be dropping the “shadow” from their titles. A YouGov poll published February 15 predicted the Coalition would win about 73 seats, and could possibly get the 76 needed for majority government.\n\nBut on April 2, Donald Trump sparked a trade war with the world, including Australia. The president became an important figure in the campaign, dragging the Coalition vote down with every confrontational utterance against America’s allies.\n\nOnly two weeks earlier Mr Dutton had promised to make the White House his first foreign visit, a break from the placing-Asia-first tradition established by Australian prime ministers, Liberal and Labor, since 1992.\n\nLike other conservatives around the world, the Opposition Leader distanced himself from the populist president. “If I needed to have a fight with Donald Trump or any other world leader to advance our nation’s interest, I would do it in a heartbeat,” Mr Dutton told Sky News on April 2.\n\nVoters were not convinced. The Trump-Dutton association went beyond copying the “government efficiency” reference. Many Australians sensed an ideological alignment, reinforced by Mr Dutton’s frequent complaints about immigration and crime.\n\nIt did not help that the Coalition’s campaign slogan, Get Australia Back on Track, had the double drawback of lacking a specific promise, and sounding similar to Make America Great Again, the Trump movement slogan so famous it morphed from an acronym into a word.\n\nOff the cuff\n\nThere was the freelancing. Almost every couple of weeks, Mr Dutton suggested a policy or made a factual assertion that he withdrew. The cumulative effect was to create a sense of unpredictability about the Coalition’s policies, at a time when turmoil had left voters craving stability.\n\nMr Dutton’s first suggestions may have been the most unlikely. After triumphantly defeating a referendum to introduce an Indigenous Voice to Parliament in 2023, his proposed three constitutional changes of his own.\n\nThe referenda would have allowed the deportation of criminals with Australian citizenship, recognised Indigenous people in the constitution, and created four-year parliamentary terms.\n\nAccepting there was no chance of success without bipartisan agreement, he quckly dropped the ideas.\n\nA decision to make public servants work in their offices was an example of Mr Dutton acting on his instincts without considering the political consequences.\n\nAlthough well intentioned, the policy reminded voters of Trump. Polling found it particularly unpopular with women, many of whom were already found Mr Dutton overly aggresive.\n\nWork-from-work was dropped. So too was a commitment to a tax break for electric cars (after two days, raising suspicions Mr Dutton did not know his own policy), a plan to fire 41,000 public servants (which became a resignation-and-retirement target), and an assertion the president of Indonesia had approved a Russian air force base (a mistake that blew one of the best, and few, random events that could have helped the Coalition).\n\nFor a politician who prided himself on a connection to the working class — Mr Dutton filmed a whole ad praising tradesmen — the greatest self-inflicted mistake may have been his revelation during a KIIS radio interview he and wife Kirilly planned to live in the prime minister’s Kirribilli residence.\n\nEntirely understandable for a family that had sacrificed so much for politics, the Duttons’ aspiration contradicted the campaign’s central message that Australians’ needed relief from deep economic pain. It was still being talked about a month later.\n\nTroubled candidates\n\nIn close elections, good candidates count. The Liberal Party’s selection system missed easy-to-find problems, including a Sydney candidate who blamed “woke Marxist ideologies” on the decision to allow women into military combat roles.\n\nHe was dumped, but Coalition Defence spokesman and former SAS officer Andrew Hastie looked strange when he acknowledged he too opposed women in combat, even though his Defence policy says the opposite.\n\nA candidate of Afghan heritage in Melbourne spent three weeks avoiding one of the city’s main newspapers, which had revealed his NIDS business used fake reviews and stock photos. His opponent, a Labor MP, received a swing more than three times the national average.\n\nOne of the most-prominent failed Liberal candidates was Amelia Hamer in Kooyong, a Melbourne seat the party desperately wanted to win back from independent Monique Ryan.\n\nMs Hamer presented herself as a renter, a gambit to win over the many students in the electorate. A Facebook search, presumably conducted by her opponent, found Mr Hamer was a London landlord. She admitted owning a Canberra apartment too.\n\nFaced with questions about her confusing property status, Ms Hamer switched to complaining about potholes on roads, which she promised to fix with federal grants to the Victorian government. She lost by 1.7 per cent, suggesting the renter fib made the difference.\n\nThe scare campaign\n\nTo be fair on Liberals who ran in the so-called teal seats, they had an opponent who was always going to be tough to beat: Liberal Party policy. The decision to place a petrol tax cut at the centre of the Coalition campaign, promote natural gas, and promise higher taxes on electric cars, seemed almost designed to turn off inner-city voters.\n\nIn the closest races against teal candidates, Goldstein in Melbourne and Bradfield in Sydney, the independents were both ahead in the last count.\n\nPart of the blame falls on Senator Price, who uttered the MAGA slogan standing next to Mr Dutton on April 12. At the time, one Liberal candidate in a winnable electorate said: “Those comments are going to cost us seats.”\n\nMr Dutton’s greatest mistake may have been his boldest. His plan for seven government-owned nuclear power stations, introduced over the objections of Treasury spokesman Angus Taylor, was the type of structural policy change that experts never stop complaining politicians are afraid to make.\n\nEven though Prime Minister Anthony Albanese could not properly pronounce nuclear, the Coalition’s nuclear plan became a centrepiece of his campaign.\n\nUsing questionable research that estimated the plants would cost $600 billion, Labor ministers argued they would be paid for from cuts to Medicare.\n\nThere was no objective evidence to support the claim. But scare campaigns work, and 2025 became the election when the Opposition Leader had his signature policy turned into one by the government.\n\nNot only did it cost the Coalition the election, it cost Mr Dutton his seat.","summary":"AARON PATRICK: Donald Trump, last-minute policy decisions and poor candidates all played a part, but Peter Dutton’s greatest mistake may have been his boldest.","url":"https://thewest.com.au/politics/federal-election-2025/aaron-patrick-how-peter-dutton-led-the-liberal-party-to-a-historic-defeat-c-18521083","image":"https://images.thewest.com.au/publication/C-18521083/bff313d395e9d9fcc13ac5ae991051d3175e38a0-16x9-x1y0w1278h719.jpg?imwidth=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-05-03 23:01:00","author":"Aaron Patrick","authors":["Aaron Patrick"],"language":"en","source_country":"au","sentiment":-0.291},{"id":317567894,"title":"Why are Republicans so bad at the economy?","text":"Two key pieces of economic data released in recent days are clear warning signs for the U.S. economy under President Donald Trump.\n\nFirst, the Bureau of Economic Analysis revealed on Wednesday that the gross domestic product shrunk by 0.3% in the first quarter, down from a 2.4% rise in the last quarter of 2024, when President Joe Biden was still in office.

He claimed that the bad economic news was a reflection of Biden’s policies, and that his approach would work out in the long run.\n\nBut voters who remember Trump’s first term and who aren’t in his personality cult will probably be extremely skeptical of his spin.\n\nTrump, after all, is the only U.S. president since labor statistics have been collected to leave office with a net job loss. As The Washington Post noted in January 2021, “No other modern president has left the U.S. with a smaller workforce than it had when they took office. Since the government started keeping track in 1939, no other president has even seen significant job losses during a single presidential term.”\n\nTrump is the most recent in a string of Republican presidents who range from poor to mediocre in their stewardship of the U.S. economy, despite the party’s claim that its policies are economically superior.\n\nRelated | Why the right wants small government—no matter how dangerous it is\n\nIn fact, the U.S. has been victim to an epidemic of economic downturns under Republican presidents in the last four-plus decades.\n\nThere was a recession at the end of George H.W. Bush’s presidency in 1992, following policies put in place by him and his predecessor Ronald Reagan. By 2008, the Great Recession that began under George W. Bush had taken a sledgehammer to the economy. In 2020, the last year of Trump’s first term, the economy suffered from the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic—even though Trump claimed the virus would melt away in the summer.\n\nThe Democratic presidents who took office after these downturns all saw significant economic improvement on their watch. In fact, Bill Clinton, Barack Obama, and Biden have three of the five best records for job growth. In total, the three Democrats saw the economy add over 35 million jobs during their presidencies. Clinton topped the overall list, with 16.6 million jobs added between 1993 and 2001.\n\nAn October 2024 study from the Senate Joint Economic Committee also determined that the economy—or GDP—grew more under Democrats and unemployment has been lower under the party as well.\n\nWhy? Republicans push tax cuts—particularly tax cuts that favor wealthy people and large corporations. Reagan, George W. Bush, and Trump all embraced this economic approach. It doesn’t work to stimulate the overall economy.\n\nIn 2017, Trump and congressional Republicans promised that their Tax Cuts and Jobs Act would lead to growth. It didn’t happen. The Center for American Progress noted in an April 2024 report that “more than six years later, there is little evidence that the law’s costly corporate tax cuts delivered promised growth or improved well-being for the vast majority of the nation’s workforce.”\n\nTrump’s law instead increased economic inequality and cut revenue that could have been used to invest in America.\n\nIn stark contrast, the Democrats have targeted investment in the middle class and the social safety net. Clinton signed the 1993 Omnibus, Obama passed the Recovery Act, and Biden signed the American Rescue Plan before the economy recovered during each of their presidencies.\n\nThe GOP’s approach has been to hand out tax cuts to really rich people in the hopes that their savings will “trickle down” to the rest of the economy. But studies have clearly shown that trickle-down economics does not work.\n\nBut if Republicans admit this and concede that the Democratic approach of focusing on middle-class needs has worked (as the data shows), they would have to give up on doling out tax cuts and shrinking the government.\n\nThat runs contrary to the interests of the super-rich. People like Trump’s top benefactor Elon Musk stand to disproportionately benefit from millionaire and billionaire tax cuts. And people like Musk are largely unaffected when the government stops providing services and protection for millions of people, especially those in the working class.\n\nIf Republicans aren’t catering to Musk and his ilk, the money they provide to the party goes away and Republicans must concede one of their most deeply held arguments against Democrats and the left.\n\nSo even when data shows their ideas aren’t working and are making things worse, the GOP will not back down. Trump and other Republicans will say conservative economic policies just need another shot, and that liberal policies—which have helped the economy recover time and time again—are a failure.\n\nThe spin may temporarily fool voters, but the data tells the truth.","summary":"Two key pieces of economic data released in recent days are clear warning signs for the U.S. economy under President Donald Trump.\n\n\n\nFirst, the Bureau of Economic Analysis revealed on Wednesday that the gross domestic product shrunk by 0.3% in the first quarter, down from a 2.4% rise in the last quarter of 2024, when President Joe Biden was still in office.
