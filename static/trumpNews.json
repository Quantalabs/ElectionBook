Israeli authorities said the family of the deceased would be notified first after a formal identification process.\n\nThe handover came after Hamas’ military wing, known as the Qassam Brigades, said the remains were that of an “occupation prisoner”, suggesting that they belonged to an Israeli rather than one of the hostages of several other nationalities also taken in Gaza.\n\nThis was the 10th deceased hostage Israel has received out of 28 bodies held in Gaza. Hamas, citing technical problems, has said it needed heavy machinery and excavating equipment to speed up the process of locating bodies buried under rubble.\n\nOn Friday, two bulldozers ploughed up the earth as Hamas searched for hostages’ remains in Hamad city, a complex of apartment towers in the city of Khan Younis. Israeli forces repeatedly bombarded the towers during the war, toppling some, and troops conducted a week-long raid there in March 2024.\n\nTurkey sent a team of specialists to help retrieve remains buried under the rubble, but the group was still waiting on Friday for Israeli permission to enter the territory. “It remains unclear when Israel will allow the Turkish team to enter Gaza,” a Turkish official told AFP, noting that the team’s mission included locating Palestinian and hostage remains. A Hamas source told AFP the Turkish delegation was expected to enter by Sunday.\n\nIsrael, insisting Hamas knows the whereabouts of the hostages’ bodies, has said the group was running out of time. Hamas has said it remains committed to the ceasefire agreement and to handing over the bodies of all remaining hostages.\n\nIsrael has returned to Gaza the bodies of 90 Palestinians for burial. Israel is expected to return more bodies, although officials have not said how many are in its custody or how many will be returned.\n\nThe dispute over hostage remains has cast a shadow over the ceasefire agreement – the first phase of US president Donald Trump’s 20-point plan to end the war.\n\nAt a news conference in Ankara, Turkish foreign minister Hakan Fidan said Israel’s statements about the hostage bodies were worrying. “Will Israel use Hamas’ incapability to locate bodies left under rubble … as an excuse and break the ceasefire? There is concern in the international community over this,” he said.\n\nEarlier on Friday, Hamas called on mediators to push for the next steps under the ceasefire, including reopening the border, letting in aid, beginning reconstruction, setting up an administration and completing Israel’s withdrawal.\n\nFighting has largely stopped in Gaza under Trump’s plan, endorsed by mediators Egypt, Qatar and Turkey. However, Gaza’s Civil Defence Service said on Friday that 11 people were killed when Israeli troops opened fire on a vehicle south east of Gaza City, including seven children and three women.\n\nThe Israeli military did not comment on the incident, and Hamas again accused Israel of violating on the ceasefire.\n\nThe 20 living hostages who were taken by Hamas along with others during its assault on Israel on 7 October 2023 were returned from Gaza earlier this week.\n\nIsrael said on Thursday it was preparing for the reopening of Gaza’s Rafah crossing with Egypt to allow Palestinians to move in and out, but gave no date as it traded blame with Hamas over violations of the ceasefire.\n\nOther unresolved elements of the plan include the disarmament of militants and Gaza’s future governance.\n\nWith Reuters, Associated Press and Agence France-Presse","summary":"Red Cross passed coffin from Hamas to Israeli military, with the remains to go through a formal identification process\n\nThe Red Cross had handed over the body of another hostage from Gaza to the IDF, Israel said early on Saturday, amid a dispute over delays in the return of remains under the ceasefire deal between Hamas and Israel.\n\nThe Israeli military and security forces received the coffin from the Red Cross inside the Gaza Strip, and it was to be sent to the Ministry of Health’s National Center for Forensic Medicine in Israel.

So will Keir Starmer sever the suppurating limb that is National Security Adviser Jonathan Powell?","text":"Any corking spy thriller has an enigmatic, grey eminence, a shadowy controller figure to intrigue the reader. So it has proved with Parliament’s ‘Chinese spooks’ saga.\n\nTwo men with connections at Westminster were about to be charged under the Official Secrets Act. They were suspected of spying for Beijing. All looked set for a trial. Then the case collapsed.\n\nDespite indignant denials from Downing Street, there were suspicions that Jonathan Powell, the little-known National Security Adviser, played a discreet and improper part in the decision. But who is this Powell? For whom does he bat? What makes him tick?\n\nA reporter, or intelligence officer, would normally respond to such questions by delving into dusty files. In the case of Agent Powell, if we may call him that, such digging is not necessary.\n\nYes, his case history offers the customary personal facts, but there is something more instructive. In 2010 he was bold enough to write a quasi-psychological politics textbook – rather a good read, it should be said – about his time as Tony Blair’s chief of staff from 1995 to 2007. The book was called ‘The New Machiavelli, How To Wield Power in the Modern World’ and it is, in its blithe unscrupulousness, most illuminating.\n\nNiccolo Machiavelli was the medieval Florentine courtier whose name has become a byword for ruthless political fixes. Machiavelli held a low view of humanity. ‘He who wishes to deceive will never fail to find willing dupes,’ ran one of his sayings. Another went: ‘If you need to conceal a fact with words, do it in such a way that it does not become known, or, if it does become known, that you have a ready and quick defence.’\n\nHow delicious that dictum becomes in the light of Downing Street’s convulsive protestations of innocence about Powell’s Chinese activities.\n\nThe book’s title was a droll acknowledgment by Powell of the job he did for Blair. Just as Machiavelli served the power-hungry churchman and politician Cesare Borgia (1475-1507), so was Powell Sir Tony’s courtly thug, his merciless wingman, the calculator of advantages to the cause. That cause was always his boss. But which boss now? Sir Keir Starmer? Tony Blair? Someone else?\n\nIn 300 pages of urbane prose Powell chronicles the struggles, mishaps and occasional triumphs of the Blair years, from New Labour’s election in 1997 to Blair’s departure from office in 2007, when he was finally worn down by a decade of mad plotting from Gordon Brown. If the book has a villain it is Brown, along with his grunting sidekick Ed Balls.\n\nBlair and Brown may have been presented to voters as the dynamic duo of New Labour but behind the scenes their relationship, as described by Powell, was neuralgic. Powell hardly helped, laughing scornfully at Brown early in his time as Blair’s chief of staff.\n\nHe and Brown, thereafter, did not speak directly to one another for a decade. What petulance. And how foolish it now looks for Powell to have been so rude in print about Brown and Balls. As National Security Adviser nowadays he needs to work with the Foreign Secretary, Yvette Cooper. Her husband? Ed Balls.\n\nPowell, whose public persona, if he has one, is that of a shrewd intellectual, emerges from his own book as a schemer, a gossip and a voyeur – he liked to be in the tear-stained room when Blair sacked ministers. Powell was even something of a snoop. He habitually eavesdropped on other people’s telephone calls, not always with their knowledge.\n\nWhen he wrote the book he may not have imagined he would return to the cockpit of politics. For supposedly such a cunning man, writing a book was a rash thing to do. Did he feel a need to proclaim his brilliance? In the breast of every orchestral viola player there may lurk a virtuoso violinist itching for the concert hall’s acclaim.\n\nPowell put loyalty to Blair above everything else. He was terse with secretaries of state, contemptuous of mandarins and would have been happy for Blair to have abandoned Downing Street and operated from a drab conference centre opposite Westminster Abbey. No 10, he argues in the book, should become a museum. Only someone deaf to symbolism and the tug of history could seriously propose such a thing.\n\nThere is something uncollegiate and metallic about Jonathan Powell. Another of his theories was that it should not be necessary for government ministers to be members of parliament. He is unmoved by the idea of parliamentary democracy and its essential link between those who rule and those who are governed. Powell is the ultimate Davos Man, a technocrat absorbed by his own class.\n\nLet us have those basic biographical facts. Jonathan Nicholas Powell (b. August 14, 1956) was the youngest son of a decorated Air Vice-Marshal. His oldest brother is Charles Powell, long-serving foreign-affairs aide to Margaret Thatcher. The flamboyant, effortlessly civilised Charles is 15 years senior and must, in early days, have been a remote, heroic figure to his little brother.\n\nYoung Jonathan was educated at Canterbury Cathedral choir school. Yes, he sings, though not, we must hope, in the sense spymasters use that verb. In the mid-1970s he read history at University College, Oxford, at a time that old scoundrel Lord Goodman, consigliere to Harold Wilson, became the college’s master.\n\nPostgraduate studies in Pennsylvania followed for Powell, as did a stint as a television journalist before he joined the Foreign Office. He served tours in three celebrated spy cities – Lisbon, Stockholm and Vienna – and was involved as a desk officer in the handover of Hong Kong to, well, well, the Chinese.\n\nThen came a posting to Washington DC, where he coiled his way into the circle of presidential candidate Bill Clinton, a fellow University College alumnus.\n\nWhen Tony Blair became leader of the Labour party in 1994, Powell was interviewed to be his chief of staff. He had long fancied becoming a Labour MP. Here was a shortcut to such glories: a political career without the tiresome business of having to suck up to provincial party dignitaries in some safe seat. In ‘The New Machiavelli’, Powell complains that he had to pay his own air fare to London for the Blair interview. The process was conducted in secret. He had been told that Brown must not hear of it.\n\nCalamity nearly struck when, heading back to Washington after the interview, Powell saw Brown and Balls in the distance at Heathrow airport. He dived into WH Smith to avoid detection. In a John le Carre book he might have hidden behind a copy of the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung. Given WH Smith, it was in this case more likely a copy of Practical Caravans magazine.\n\nIn the book’s introduction Powell claims that, far from being manipulative, he is as naive as Candide, the fictional character created by Voltaire. Candide is a young blade of ‘the most unaffected simplicity’ and when bad things happen, he is astonished.\n\nSuch a self-assessment is alarming from someone who is now National Security Adviser, a position generally associated with the most intense and wary worldliness. But then you contemplate some of Powell’s greatest hits: the recent surrender of the Chagos Isles, concessions to Irish republican terror groups and the amiable dealings with Libya’s murderous Colonel Gaddafi. ‘Unaffected simplicity’ may be a polite way of admitting he is a blithering fool.\n\nWhen he started working for Blair he was told that he spoke too fast for his political bosses. With his head of Grecian curls and his gabbling intellectualism he was the back-room professor, the tester of theories, sower of strategies. That, at least, is what we are invited to believe.\n\nYet this coy self-portrait, this reaching for the role of brainy ingenue, will not quite wash. Powell was part of a cabal that, by various sneaky sleights, took us to war in Iraq. After leaving Downing Street in 2007 he continued his association with the now multi-millionaire Blair. Powell himself is understood to be enviably well-off. Please, spare us the innocent abroad routine.\n\nPowell has had a deleterious effect on our public life.\n\nHis appointment as a Downing Street official in 1997 frayed long-standing conventions on civil service impartiality. Standards of political hygiene deteriorated fast under New Labour. The Blairites downgraded the office of Lord Chancellorship and made for the establishment of a supreme court, wrecking our constitution’s balance between the executive and the Law.\n\nPowell was an ardent Europhile and regrets that the Blair government did not surrender even more of our sovereignty to Brussels. It’s the old George Smiley conundrum. Is he naïve? Or sinister?\n\nThen there was, and is, his approach to our country’s relations with the United States. It was Powell who, before the Iraq war, told our then ambassador to Washington, Christopher Meyer that, ‘we want you to get up the arse of the White House and stay there’. At a Downing Street press conference I asked Blair to explain that disgusting remark. He refused even to acknowledge it, such was Downing Street’s embarrassment.\n\nNow we see the same Powell steering the Starmer government’s approach to the Trump administration. Let’s hope things work out better this time than they did with the Iraq war.\n\nComing as it does from a student of Machiavelli, none of this should be a surprise. Machiavelli believed any competent prince would be ‘skilful in simulating and dissembling’. That was a fancy Florentine way of saying ‘lies’. Powell himself writes that Tony Blair was good at ‘constructive ambiguity’. Spot the difference.\n\nWhat can this silken, sinuous courtier, so reverent to that liquid lizard Blair, truly think of plodding, oblong Sir Keir? Powell’s book notes the qualities Machiavelli demanded most in a prince were decisiveness, oratorical fluency, optimism and charm. Sir Keir is not over-endowed in any of those.\n\nMachiavelli held that the key ability of a leader was to avoid contempt. With hapless Sir Keir we can only say ‘too late, mate’. To toil under dullard Starmer having previously worked for Prince Tony must be to drink flat Tizer having once supped Krug. How the Blairites must laugh at Sir Keir behind his back.\n\nAnd does the nasal knight even start to understand this complex latter-day Machiavelli who is his National Security Adviser? Sir Keir appears to take Powell at face value. In the Commons this week he proudly noted that Donald Trump’s Middle East negotiator, Steve Witkoff, had been complimentary about Powell.\n\nDid Sir Keir not pause to wonder who had encouraged the infamously transactional Witkoff to make that remark? Could it possibly have been Blair, trying to save his stricken friend? And who suggested to the Trump White House that the superannuated Blair might be a suitable chairman of the new peace body in Palestine? Could that not have been Powell? Circles, circles.\n\nThe Blairites toy with Starmer, using a sub-standard PM for their own ends. Machiavelli would have understood such naked self-interest. Before Sir Keir becomes too bogged down in defending his National Security Adviser he should perhaps consider Machiavelli’s advice that the wise prince ‘must be ready to shift as the winds and tides of Fortune turn’.\n\nWhen Jonathan Powell turned up for work in Downing Street this week a photograph caught him looking distinctly careworn. Fortune may finally be turning against Downing Street’s furtive lurker. He may or may not be right about Britain needing to reach an accommodation with China. That is by the by. He has now become a reputational problem for a Starmer government that has run out of political capital. Such things have their own relentless logic.\n\nAs Powell himself notes in his Machiavelli book, ‘it is best not to let a scandal drag on. If the person at the centre of it will have to be sacrificed in due course, it is no kindness to them, and a major problem for the government, to allow the limb to suppurate rather than cutting it off straight away’.\n\nSir Keir should follow Jonathan Powell’s excellent advice, and sever this suppurating limb.","summary":"Any corking spy thriller has an enigmatic, grey eminence, a shadowy controller figure to intrigue the reader.

Standing on the terraces at Villa Park – or, these days, sitting there with my equally fanatical sons – I love it all the same.\n\nI’ve had the privilege of meeting Prince William twice. Both times we chatted for what felt like hours about our shared love for our club – even if HRH probably doesn’t share my fondness for Bovril and a balti pie at half-time.\n\nThat’s why, as someone adopted and raised by a loving Jewish father, I’ve never been as appalled as I am by the decision of West Midlands Police to ban fans of Maccabi Tel Aviv from visiting my club for an away match next month.\n\nThat a local ‘Independent’ MP, Ayoub Khan, worked with disgraced ex-Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn to organise a petition to have the match called off is a stain on the game and our country.\n\nLocal cleric Asrar Rashid, meanwhile, handed down an ‘Islamic ruling’ and warned disgracefully: ‘When the Tel Aviv fans come to Birmingham in a few weeks, we will not show them rahma [mercy].’\n\nYesterday, West Midlands Police finally said that Israeli fans should not be allowed to come to the game.\n\nWe should be clear about what has taken place. A group of fans have been banned from attending a match on the basis of their nationality – or perhaps their race. This is anti-Jewish racism straight out of the 1930s.\n\nI know from personal experience that West Midlands Police can appear less than impartial. When, last year, I called the proscribed terrorist group Hamas an ‘Islamist death cult’ on X, I was stunned to find myself investigated for a so-called ‘non-crime hate incident’. It was, I was told by a senior officer, only a change in rules that prevented it being logged as such on my ‘police record’.\n\nBut these issues extend beyond the parochial. Britain is seeing an inexorable rise in both extremism and sectarian politics. Councillors and MPs are being elected for their views on Israel and Gaza, a conflict thousands of miles away.\n\nGreen Party deputy leader, Mothin Ali, marked his council election victory last May by donning a keffiyeh and screaming: ‘This is for Palestine! Allahu akbar!’ Climate change and recycling did not appear to be his main priorities.\n\nResearch by my office has found that between Hamas’s pogrom on October 7, 2023, and October 5 this year, Parliament discussed Israel and Gaza more than 15,000 times – compared to 8,000 or so for both the NHS and the Ukraine war, and a mere 2,500 times for immigration.\n\nThe BBC is just as myopic, obsessing over Israel while remaining comparatively mute on wars in, say, Sudan.\n\nYesterday, Ofcom censured the BBC for broadcasting a documentary narrated by a boy with links to Hamas, which it failed to disclose. The national broadcaster still refuses to refer to Hamas as ‘terrorists’ – though they are in law.\n\nAll this helps to fuel the lie that Israel is somehow uniquely evil – and that leads to hatred towards people rightly or wrongly identified with the country, including Britain’s Jewish community.\n\nThe Community Security Trust, the brilliant charity that does so much to protect British Jews, is logging thousands of incidents every year. In London in July, a synagogue was reportedly smeared with excrement. In Worcester last month, buildings owned by Jewish people were daubed with red swastikas.\n\nAs the Chief Rabbi has said, it is a ‘tidal wave of Jew-hatred’ – and it culminated, tragically, in the cold-blooded murder of innocent Jews in their own synagogue a fortnight ago by an Islamist terrorist in Manchester.\n\nThis context is vital to understanding the abysmal decision of West Midlands Police to ban Jewish fans from attending their team’s game. It should be a wake-up call for our country – and we have a duty to do something about it. It is time we stood up for democracy, equality, freedom, fairness and tolerance – and tell anyone who disagrees with these values to feel free to go and live elsewhere.\n\nThe Government needs to develop a proper plan to tackle anti-Jewish extremism. The authorities must finally deal with hardline clerics preaching hatred in mosques. Racist staff should be sacked from public-sector jobs. Charities giving a platform to anti-Jewish racism should be stripped of their tax-free status.\n\nYes, the right to protest is sacrosanct. But the weekly anti-Semitic hate-marches must be curbed, especially after Donald Trump’s historic peace deal.\n\nThe decision to ban Maccabi Tel Aviv fans is a symptom of a far more insidious disease.

She called for “renewed commitment to the time-honored principles that helped make American universities great” and said she looked forward to more dialogue.\n\nThe White House has faced a flurry of rejections after inviting nine universities to become “initial signatories” of the so-called compact, which asked colleges to make commitments aligned with Trump’s political priorities in exchange for favorable access to research funding. It was the latest effort by Trump’s administration to bring to heel prestigious universities that conservatives describe as hotbeds of liberalism.\n\nThe White House asked university leaders to provide initial feedback on the compact by Oct. 20, yet as the deadline approaches, none has signed on to the document. Those that have not yet announced a decision are Dartmouth College, the University of Arizona, the University of Texas and Vanderbilt University. They did not immediately respond to questions about Friday’s call. Leaders of the University of Texas system previously said they were honored to be included, but other universities still weighing the deal have not indicated how they’re leaning.\n\nAfter the meeting, McMahon took a collaborative tone, speaking of ongoing discussions with universities and referencing continued federal funding.\n\n“American universities power our economy, drive innovation, and prepare young people for rewarding careers and fulfilling lives,” she said in the social media post. “With continued federal investment and strong institutional leadership, the higher education sector can do more to enhance American leadership in the world and build tomorrow’s workforce.”\n\nNo takers so far\n\nNevertheless, the University of Virginia on Friday became the fifth university to decline to participate in Trump’s compact. Providing federal money based on anything but merit would undermine the integrity of research and further erode public confidence in higher education, the university’s interim president said in a letter to McMahon and White House officials.\n\n“We look forward to working together to develop alternative, lasting approaches to improving higher education,” Paul Mahoney wrote.\n\nIt’s unclear exactly what universities have to gain by agreeing to the deal — or what they stand to lose if they don’t. In a letter sent alongside the compact, Trump officials said it provided “multiple positive benefits,” including favorable access to federal funding. In exchange, colleges were asked to adopt 10 pages of commitments aligned with Trump’s views.\n\nThe administration asked for commitments to eliminate race and sex from admissions decisions, to accept the government’s strict binary definition of “man” and “woman,” to promote conservative views on campus and to ensure “institutional neutrality” on current events, among other provisions.\n\n“Institutions of higher education are free to develop models and values other than those below, if the institution elects to forego federal benefits,” the compact said.\n\nThe issue weighed on some students at Vanderbilt on Friday, with some worrying the university might sign the agreement even after student and faculty groups condemned it.\n\n“My major concern is just that this is like a first hook,” Marjolein Mues, a postdoctoral researcher in language development in the brain, said in an interview at the Nashville campus. “And once universities agree to this, the terms will change, and more and more will be asked of universities, and that maybe the government will start to interfere more with the types of research being done here.”\n\nThe Massachusetts Institute of Technology was the first to decline the deal last week, saying it would limit free speech and campus independence. Similar concerns were cited in rejections from Brown University, the University of Pennsylvania and the University of Southern California.\n\nA push to change academia\n\nThe compact — which aims to reshape higher education through negotiation rather than legislation — has stirred a wave of pushback from academia and beyond. It has been protested by students, been condemned by faculty and drawn the ire of Democrats at all levels. Gov. Gavin Newsom in California and Democrats in Virginia have threatened to cut state funding to any university that signs on.\n\nIn a joint statement Friday, more than 30 higher education organizations urged the administration to withdraw the compact. Led by the American Council on Education, an association of research universities, the coalition said the agreement would give the government unprecedented control over colleges’ academics and hinder free speech.\n\n“The compact is a step in the wrong direction,” the statement said.\n\nMany of the terms align with recent deals the White House struck with Brown and Columbia universities to close investigations into alleged discrimination and to restore research funding. But while those agreements included terms affirming the campuses’ academic freedom, the compact offers no such protection — one of the roadblocks cited in Brown’s rejection.\n\nIn Trump’s ongoing quest to win obedience from powerful universities, his top target has been Harvard, the first university to openly defy a set of wide-ranging demands from the government. The White House went on to slash billions of dollars in research funding at Harvard, cancel its federal contracts and attempt to block the Ivy League school from enrolling foreign students.\n\nA federal judge in Boston reversed the funding cuts last month, calling them an unconstitutional overreach.\n\nSeveral other prestigious universities have also had their funding cut amid investigations into alleged antisemitism.\n\nWhite House officials described the offer as a proactive approach to shape policy at U.S. campuses even as the administration continues its enforcement efforts.\n\nTrump on Sunday said colleges that sign on will help bring about “the Golden Age of Academic Excellence in Higher Education.” Speaking on his Truth Social platform, he said it would reform universities that are “now corrupting our Youth and Society with WOKE, SOCIALIST, and ANTI-AMERICAN Ideology.”\n\n(Copyright (c) 2024 The Associated Press.

A catastrophic crash that will destroy savings, prosperity and living standard is coming. Britain's in deep, deep trouble","text":"Every October, some 10,000 finance ministers and bankers from 190 nations around the planet assemble in Washington DC for the annual – and simultaneous – gatherings of the International Monetary Fund, the G7 group of the world’s richest nations and the World Bank.\n\nThe American capital is bathed in the russet and orange foliage of fall, but the streets are a sea of black limousines and anxious, dark-suited delegates.\n\nThere is the usual veneer of polished calm as the world’s most eminent money men settle down to business, but, as a veteran of almost five decades at these gatherings, I can smell trouble in the air.\n\nUncertainty is everywhere, from the quixotic behaviour of Donald Trump’s White House to febrile world stock markets which, on most measures, have lost all connection with reality.\n\nThere is uncertainty as to whether rich nations, including Britain, can continue borrowing huge sums to fund their lifestyles.\n\nAnd there is fear about growing fissures in the private, unregulated loan markets which could prove as toxic as the American sub-prime mortgage scandal, the trigger for the great financial crisis of 2008.\n\nStrip away the technical language and look into the eyes of key financiers and you can see the trepidation.\n\nThe financial world stands on the edge of a precipice. No wonder cautious investors and central bankers are hoarding gold.\n\nEven the normally phlegmatic boss of the International Money Fund (IMF), Kristalina Georgieva, was moved to observe this week that ‘forces of change are making the global economy less predictable, and it is impacting people. People are anxious. They’re taking to the streets to demand better opportunities.’\n\nDemanding economic progress is one thing, however. Achieving it is quite another.\n\nI fear that it’s now too late for soothing words and hopeful promises. Events are moving rapidly – in completely the wrong direction.\n\nAnd we should, instead, be preparing for a calamity so profound it could destroy savings, wealth, prosperity and living standards.\n\nThe first threat shaking the world economy is Donald Trump himself, the 47th President of the United States, and his determination to re-shape global trade to America’s advantage.\n\nEven such a calm and trusted figure as his Treasury Secretary, Scott Bessent, is warning that America and China are being sucked into a debilitating trade war.\n\nBeijing’s unexpected decision to impose a ban on the export of rare-earth metals poses a daunting threat to America’s defence, high-tech and electric vehicle industries. China controls 99 per cent of the world’s trade in processed rare earths, minerals which are essential when it comes to manufacturing sophisticated electronics.\n\nOther nations are scrambling to catch up, but it will take them years, if not decades, to do so.\n\nStill more dangerous is Trump’s response: a pledge of a minimum 100 per cent tariff on all Chinese goods entering the United States (raised to 130 per cent on some items).\n\nThis could prove even more destructive than the ‘Liberation Day’ tariffs he imposed in April which paralysed financial markets.\n\nAnalysts are also bracing themselves for a Bonfire Night explosion. November 5 is the date set by the Supreme Court to decide whether Trump had the right to impose tariffs – and declare a trade war on the world – without the approval of Congress.\n\nOr whether, in relying on his own executive powers, the President exceeded his mandate.\n\nNo one is quite sure how an enraged Trump will react if he loses.\n\nThe second major threat facing the world’s financial system comes from the inexorable rise of share prices, American stocks in particular. These have been driven to record valuations thanks to the huge bets placed on the potential of artificial intelligence (AI).\n\nIt is fashionable to say that our futures rest upon AI which, it is claimed, will have the same revolutionary impact as the coming of the railways or the internal combustion engine.\n\nBut share prices for tech are plainly overwrought, particularly when you consider the incestuous nature of recent AI deals.\n\nFirst, chip-maker Nvidia revealed it was investing $100 billion in OpenAI, the US firm which created ChatGPT. Then, days later, OpenAI disclosed it was forming an alliance with another high-value American chipmaker, AMD, worth tens of billions of dollars.\n\nThis cross-investment has led to fears of an AI bubble similar to the dotcom speculation which ended with such an almighty bang in 2000.\n\nValuations of the ‘Magnificent Seven’ tech companies (a list which includes Nvidia, Microsoft, Apple, Amazon and Meta, formerly Facebook) underpin equity markets right around the world, not to mention the savings of millions relying on pensions and savings trusts.\n\nIf American tech valuations were to go up in puff of smoke, we would all be doomed.\n\nA third cause of alarm here in the American capital is the sheer scale of debt among the very richest countries.\n\nThe nature of the debt is concerning too, as much of it is underwritten by the ever-expanding ‘shadow’ banking sector.\n\nThe collapse of two players in the US motor industry, parts-maker First Brands and finance-supplier Tricolor, has set alarm bells ringing.\n\nBoth companies relied on finance from unregulated private lenders. Yet, because the vast $4.5 trillion private credit markets fall outside the tough regulation and scrutiny imposed on banks since the financial crisis of 2008, it is only now that the scale of the debts has been exposed.\n\nThese bankruptcies reach deep into the heart of the world’s formal banking system, too.\n\nSwitzerland’s UBS and investment bank Jefferies were both lenders to First Brands. JP Morgan has acknowledged a $1 billion exposure to Tricolor.\n\nAs one senior regulator told me, ‘The drains need to come up’ – meaning that the system needs to be flushed out before we can really see what’s going on.\n\nThe world’s most powerful commercial banker Jamie Dimon, chairman of the mighty JP Morgan, put it a different way when he suggested that these unwelcome corporate failures were like ‘cockroaches’: when you see one, you know that more will be lurking.\n\nAnyone who has encountered this particular pest – prevalent in Washington – knows that they creep into every crevice and are ferociously difficult to eliminate.\n\nDimon’s colourful analogy sent tremors through the financial system.\n\nPoliticians might try to blame the regulators for problems in the financial markets, but they cannot escape the financial crises of their own making.\n\nThe Group of Seven (G7) richest countries – America, Canada, Japan, Germany, Britain, France and Italy – can no longer hide from levels of public debt, which have reached heights not seen since the aftermath of the Second World War in 1948.\n\nGermany aside, debt levels in these economies have climbed to 100 per cent or more of national output – and the totals continue to rise.\n\nBritain owes some £2.9 trillion. America is a staggering £28 trillion in the red. No one believes it is sustainable.\n\nTo my mind, the doom-laden atmosphere here in Washington is terrifying, as is some of the language used by top officials.\n\nThe list of risk factors cited by the IMF’s global stability chief Tobias Adrian was remorseless. He accused Wall Street, London and other world financial markets of ‘being complacent as the ground shifts’ beneath their feet.\n\nThe atmosphere in Washington felt much like this when Britain was ejected from the Exchange Rate Mechanism in September 1992 and the Bank of England temporarily raised interest rates to 15 per cent in a failed attempt to defend the pound from speculators.\n\nThe humiliation would eventually sweep John Major’s Tories from office.\n\nWe could feel the gathering storm in October 2008, too. Lehman Brothers had just collapsed and the foundations of world finance were subsiding.\n\nA top British monetary official confided to me then that the United Kingdom was at the start of something disastrous.\n\nIn the event, Gordon Brown launched a near £1 trillion package to bail out Britain’s financial sector. The taxpayer is still paying off those bills today.\n\nIt was also here in Washington that short-lived Chancellor of the Exchequer, Kwasi Kwarteng, was swept up in the whirlwind of the Liz Truss mini-budget in 2022.\n\nStanding 6ft 5in, the lanky Kwarteng received a dressing down from diminutive US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen as the pound slumped and bond yields (the interest rate the government pays to its lenders) soared.\n\nKwarteng was ordered home to face the mounting chaos, but by the time his ‘red eye’ flight arrived at Heathrow, he had been sacked.\n\nToday, once again, Britain is in trouble. Labour’s great promise to ‘fix the foundations’ of the economy has come to nothing.\n\nBy my count, Rachel Reeves’s budget on November 26 will be her fourth major attempt at solving the UK’s problems in the short time since she took office.\n\nBritain’s reputation on the bond markets – the ultimate diviners of fiscal credibility – is no better than after the Truss implosion.\n\nThe world’s financial markets have less faith in Britain than in any of our G7 rivals – and that’s despite the severe budgetary problems of our competitors.\n\nIndeed, IMF officials are considering a special study into why Britain’s bond yields are perennially higher than those of all other nations.\n\nPrime Minister Keir Starmer and his Chancellor are skating on very, very thin ice.\n\nThe promise to achieve best growth in the G7 was crushed by Labour’s destructive increase in employers national insurance, which is also causing unemployment to climb.\n\nBritain is an outlier in inflation, too, with consumer prices soaring by 3.7 per cent. It is hurting the very working people that Labour says it wants to help.\n\nAnd all of this has created a ‘doom loop’, with a great hole in the public finances opening up once again.\n\nReeves is keen to create a bigger financial buffer to protect the UK from the coming global train wreck – yet has no means of doing so aside from damaging the economy with yet more tax increases.\n\nNone of this can end well. Trump, tariffs, overheated equity markets and the gathering storm in private credit markets all portend a financial crisis of the kind which destroyed the governments of Callaghan in 1979, John Major in 1997 and Gordon Brown in 2010.\n\nToday, the pressure is building relentlessly, yet Starmer – lacking leadership, strategy and understanding of economic policy – seems powerless to act.\n\nSacking his chancellor could save Starmer’s skin in the short term. But the British electorate never forgives economic failure especially if it robs them of\n\nsavings, pensions and a comfortable retirement.\n\nFrom what I’ve seen here in Washington, we should be in no doubt at all: a crash is coming. And when it does, our nation is in terrible jeopardy.","summary":"Every October, some 10,000 finance ministers and bankers from 190 nations around the planet assemble in Washington for the annual gathering of the International Monetary Fund","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/money/mailplus/article-15202529/ALEX-BRUMMER-financiers-terrified-Britain-economy-trouble.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/10/17/16/103083397-0-image-a-44_1760715344192.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-10-18 00:29:20","author":"Alex Brummer,Editor","authors":["Alex Brummer","Editor"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":0.101},{"id":370280780,"title":"White House lobs middle school insult at liberal news outlet's question about upcoming Putin meeting","text":"The White House descended into a playground-style spat on Friday after reporters questioned President Donald Trump's decision to hold his next meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Budapest.\n\nWhen HuffPost correspondent S.V.

I actually believe that the Success in the Middle East will help in our negotiation in attaining an end to the War with Russia/Ukraine,' Trump said in his post.\n\nHe went on to reveal that both sides had agreed to send 'high-level advisors' with US meetings led by Secretary of State Marco Rubio ahead of the main summit, which would take place in Budapest 'to be determined' in the coming weeks.\n\nThe choice of Budapest immediately raised eyebrows across the diplomatic world, not just because of the city's history but also because of Hungary's authoritarian drift under Prime Minister Viktor Orbán, one of Putin's closest allies in Europe and a vocal supporter of Trump's return to power.\n\nOn Friday, Trump hosted Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky at the White House. \n\nDuring their meeting, Trump signaled that he was leaning against selling Kyiv long-range Tomahawk missiles, even as he called for an end to the war.\n\n'I have an obligation also to make sure that we're completely stocked up as a country, because you never know what's going to happen in war and peace,' Trump told reporters. \n\n'We'd much rather have them not need Tomahawks.

Listing reasons as to why protesters will be out for the “No Kings” rallies nationwide, Tarlov said people will be “peacefully protesting” the Trump administration’s crackdown against illegal immigrants in the U.S.\n\n“Then why are they always dressed like a furry, screaming about boys and girls?” Fox’s Joey Jones asked. “They are ridiculous.”\n\nAs Tarlov attempted to argue, Jones continued to say that if the activists wanted to make an “intellectual argument” then “dressing up like a unicorn and running out there and screaming every time” is not the way. (RELATED: Lesbian Pop Star Reneé Rapp Launches Foul-Mouthed Tirade Against Trump, ICE During Portland Concert)\n\n“It is an intellectual argument to say, [DHS Secretary] Kristi [Noem], ‘You’re making it up about what’s going on here at that ICE facility, because I’m dressed as Pikachu and posing no threat.’ They arrested a guy who was singing,” Tarlov responded.\n\n“His voice was terrible, Jessica,” Fox’s Jesse Watters teased.\n\nSince the protests in Portland began over the summer, President Donald Trump deployed National Guard troops to the Democrat-led city and others to address attacks against ICE. The president’s decision came as ongoing assaults from the militant far-left network Antifa persisted, with authorities arresting and charging dozens of rioters outside the ICE facility.\n\nWhile Democrats have downplayed the violence, conservative journalist Nick Sortor and Post Millennial reporter Katie Daviscourt have had multiple altercations with Antifa while reporting on the ground.\n\nOn Oct. 2, Sortor was arrested by local authorities for “disorderly conduct” after Antifa became agitated as he was recording them. In a video shared on X, an Antifa member dressed in all black repeatedly confronted Sortor as he said he was simply trying to cross the street. The person appeared to throw the first swing, which Sortor then appeared to defend against, ending with him landing on his back in a nearby planter.\n\nIn an interview with Fox News following his arrest, Sortor criticized local authorities for failing to act against Antifa members.

Santos, who represented New York’s 3rd Congressional District, was sentenced earlier this year to seven years and three months in prison after pleading guilty to wire fraud and identity theft. He had initially faced 23 federal charges, including wire fraud, money laundering, and theft of public funds, related to the misuse of campaign donations. He entered a plea deal in August 2024, just weeks before his trial. Trump’s decision to grant clemency continues a pattern of leniency toward Republican allies facing corruption or fraud charges. Here are the nine other GOP congressmen who previously received similar relief: Chris Collins Christopher Carl Collins, former US representative for New York’s 27th district, pleaded guilty in 2019 to insider trading and lying to the FBI. Arrested in 2018 alongside his son, Collins was charged with using non-public information for stock trades. Despite initially suspending his 2018 re-election campaign, he won narrowly before resigning in October 2019. Collins began serving a 26-month prison sentence in October 2020 but was pardoned by President Donald Trump in December 2020. In June 2025, Collins announced plans to run for Congress again, this time for Florida’s 19th district in the 2026 election. Duncan Hunter Duncan Duane Hunter, former Republican US representative for California, was indicted in 2018 for conspiracy, wire fraud, and campaign finance violations. Prosecutors revealed Hunter misused campaign funds from 2009 to 2016 for personal expenses, including extramarital affairs. In December 2019, he pleaded guilty to misusing campaign funds and resigned from Congress in January 2020. Hunter was sentenced to 11 months in prison, set to begin in January 2021, but did not serve time after President Donald Trump pardoned him in December 2020. Trump also pardoned Hunter’s wife, who had pleaded guilty to related charges. Steve Stockman Stephen Ernest Stockman, a Republican former US representative from Texas, was convicted in 2018 on 23 felony counts involving money laundering and the misuse of campaign funds. He was sentenced to ten years in prison and ordered to pay $1 million in restitution. On December 22, 2020, President Donald Trump commuted Stockman’s prison sentence, significantly reducing his punishment. Rick Renzi Richard George Renzi served as the US Representative for Arizona’s 1st congressional district from 2003 to 2009. In 2008, he was indicted on 35 counts related to a corrupt land-swap deal involving over $700,000 in personal gain. Renzi denied wrongdoing but was convicted in 2013 on 17 counts and sentenced to three years in prison. His family business was raided by the FBI in 2007, and he temporarily resigned from the House Intelligence Committee. After revelations of prosecutorial misconduct, Renzi received a presidential pardon from Donald Trump on January 20, 2021. Robin Hayes Robert Cannon \"Robin\" Hayes served as the US Representative for North Carolina’s 8th congressional district from 1999 to 2009 and was the party’s gubernatorial nominee in 1996. Hayes also chaired the North Carolina Republican Party twice, from 2011 to 2013 and 2016 to 2019. In 2019, he pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI as part of a bribery investigation. On January 20, 2021, President Donald Trump granted Hayes a pardon, clearing him of the conviction. Mark Siljander Mark Deli Siljander is a former Republican congressman from Michigan who served in the US House of Representatives from 1981 to 1987. In 2008, he was indicted on charges including money laundering, conspiracy, and obstruction of justice. He later pleaded guilty in 2010 to obstruction of justice and acting as an unregistered foreign agent in connection with lobbying efforts on behalf of an Islamic charity linked to terrorism. In 2020, President Donald Trump granted Siljander a full pardon as part of a series of clemency actions during his final weeks in office. Duke Cunningham Duke Cunningham, a decorated Navy pilot and Vietnam War ace, served 20 years in the military before becoming a TOPGUN instructor and squadron commander. He was elected to the US House of Representatives in 1990 and served until 2005, representing parts of California. Cunningham resigned from Congress after pleading guilty to accepting over $2.4 million in bribes and underreporting his income. He was sentenced to eight years and four months in prison and ordered to pay $1.8 million in restitution. He completed his sentence in 2013. In 2021, President Donald Trump granted him a conditional pardon for his crimes. Michael Grimm Michael Grimm, a former Republican congressman from New York’s 11th District, was charged in 2014 with 20 counts including fraud, tax evasion, and perjury. He pleaded guilty to felony tax fraud on December 23, 2014, and admitted to hiring undocumented workers, committing wire fraud, and lying under oath. Grimm resigned from Congress in January 2015 and was sentenced to eight months in prison, which he began serving in September 2015. He attempted a political comeback in 2018 but lost in the GOP primary. Between 2022 and 2024, he worked as a Newsmax commentator. In 2024, he was paralyzed in a horse-riding accident and was pardoned by Donald Trump in May 2025. John Rowland John Rowland served three terms in the US House representing Connecticut’s 5th District (1985–1991) and later became the state’s governor, winning three terms. In 2004, he resigned amid a corruption investigation and later pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit honest services fraud, mail fraud, and tax fraud. He served 10 months in prison and four months under house arrest. In 2014, Rowland was convicted on seven counts related to illegal campaign payments and sentenced to 30 months in prison. He was released in 2018. In 2025, President Donald Trump issued him a full pardon as part of a broader clemency effort.

The Indonesian government denied the Israelis visas to enter the country for the upcoming 53rd FIG Artistic Gymnastics World Championships in Jakarta, which began Sunday. \"The IOC’s principled position is very clear: All eligible athletes, teams and sports officials must be able to participate in international sports competitions and events without any form of discrimination from the host country, in accordance with the Olympic Charter and the fundamental principles of nondiscrimination, autonomy and political neutrality that govern the Olympic Movement,\" the IOC's statement said. CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM \"It is therefore the direct responsibility of the host country, the organizer and the sports organizations directly concerned to make sure that this principle is fully respected and that all necessary assurances are provided by the relevant authorities of the host country in advance.\" The IOC also claimed its officials will discuss the situation with Indonesia at its next meeting. \"Sport must remain a safe space for athletes to fulfill their dreams; and athletes must not be held responsible for political decisions,\" the statement added. Indonesia said it wouldn't grant visas to Team Israel because of the war in Gaza. Then, on Tuesday, the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) rejected Israel's request for intervention. The Israel Gymnastics Federation (IGF) released a statement addressing the sanction. \"The rules are clear, and Indonesia's actions constitute a blatant violation of them. It is inconceivable that a country can bar another nation from competing in a World Championship while the governing bodies stand by,\" the statement read, via the BBC. \"This decision undermines the very foundations of sport and fair competition, and it delivers a severe blow to the morale of the gymnasts and staff who have worked tirelessly for this moment.\" Indonesia was previously stripped of its right to host football's Under-20 World Cup when the governor of Bali refused to host Team Israel in a game. Indonesia's latest sanction against the IGF is just the latest example of restrictions placed on Israel's sports teams and fans in recent months. CRUZ SLAMS UN'S ISRAEL ‘GENOCIDE’ CHARGE, PUSHES FOR CONSEQUENCES The Israel Premier Tech cycling team has been excluded from an upcoming race in Italy, the Giro dell'Emilia, scheduled for Oct. 4, over potentially disruptive pro-Palestinian protests. The UEFA Europa League, Europe's biggest soccer body, was reportedly moving toward a vote to suspend Israel over the war in Gaza in September. FIFA President Gianni Infantino announced no action would be taken against the team on Oct. 3. He reportedly later met privately at FIFA headquarters with the leader of the Palestinian soccer federation, Jibril Rajoub, and praised his organization \"for their resilience at this time,\" per The Associated Press. Meanwhile, fans of Israeli teams have been barred from recent major events as well. Fans of the Israeli soccer team Maccabi Tel Aviv are prohibited from attending a Europa League game in Birmingham, England, Nov. 6, over safety concerns, after the team's fans were attacked in Amsterdam at a game against Ajax last fall.

Santos, 37, reported to a federal facility in Fairton, N.Y., on July 25.\n\nSantos also gained prominence for lying about his employment history and education, and information about his family.\n\n\"George has been in solitary confinement for long stretches of time and, by all accounts, has been horribly mistreated,\" Trump posted on Truth Social. \"Therefore, I just signed a Commutation, releasing George Santos from prison, IMMEDIATELY. Good luck George, have a great life!\"\n\nTrump left the White House on Friday to spend the weekend in Florida. He's the keynote speaker Friday night at a fundraiser for the super PAC MAGA Inc.\n\nA senior White House official told NBC News that Trump decided to help Santos this week and \"many people wrote to him about it.\"\n\nRep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., had sought a pardon, which erases the legal consequences of a crime. A commutation only reduces the severity of the punishment.\n\nGreene told NBC News this week that she had been in contact with the Department of Justice in recent weeks regarding the possibility, saying the sentence was overly harsh.\n\n\"George Santos never raped anybody, never murdered anybody, is not a child sex-trafficker. Why is he in solitary confinement?\" she said. \"That is an extreme treatment for someone for the crimes that he was convicted of.\"\n\nCNN didn't receive comments from his lawyers.\n\nSantos, before reporting to prison, told a Saudi outlet, Al Arabiya English, that he asked Trump for a pardon.\n\n\"I did not spend time in D.C. making friends,\" Santos said. \"I never made it to the president. I got stonewalled by the gatekeepers.\"\n\nFrom prison last week, Santos wrote a letter to Trump published in The South Shore Press: \"Mr. President, I am not asking for sympathy. I am asking for fairness -- for the chance to rebuild. I know I have made mistakes in my past. I have faced my share of consequences, and I take full responsibility for my actions. But no man, no matter his flaws, deserves to be lost in the system, forgotten and unseen, enduring punishment far beyond what justice requires.\"\n\nTrump took notice of Santos' situation.\n\n\"George Santos was somewhat of a 'rogue,' but there are many rogues throughout our Country that aren't forced to serve seven years in prison,\" Trump posted on Truth Social. \"I started to think about George when the subject of Democrat Senator Richard 'Da Nang Dick' Blumenthal came up again.\"\n\nTrump explained that Blumenthal, who has served as a U.S. senator serving Connecticut for 14 1/2 years, lied about his military involvement.\n\n\"He was 'a Great Hero,' he would leak to any and all who would listen -- And then it happened! He was a COMPLETE AND TOTAL FRAUD. He never went to Vietnam, he never saw Vietnam, he never experienced the Battles there, or anywhere else. ... This is far worse than what George Santos did, and at least Santos had the Courage, Conviction, and Intelligence to ALWAYS VOTE REPUBLICAN!\"\n\nSantos fabricated parts of his biography, including falsely, saying that he was a \"star\" player on a championship volleyball team.\n\nSantos was raised Catholic but claimed his mother had a Jewish background and that his maternal grandparents were Jewish refugees from Ukraine who survived the Holocaust.

The 311-114 vote surpassed the required two-thirds majority.\n\nHe was the sixth lawmaker to be forced out of the chamber.\n\nOn March 7, 2024, he announced he would run as a Republican in the 1st Congressional District and 15 days later, Santos said he would seek the office as an independent. A month later, on April 23, he withdrew his candidacy.\n\nHe pleaded guilty on Aug. 19, 2024, in federal court in Central Islip, N.Y., and was sentenced on April 25.\n\n\"I deeply regret my conduct,\" Santos said in court during his conviction and sentence. \"I accept full responsibility for my actions.\"","summary":"President Donald Trump said he commuted the sentence of George Santos, freeing the former Republican U.S. House member after three months in federal prison.","url":"https://www.upi.com/Top_News/US/2025/10/17/Trump-commutes-George-Santos-sentnece-frees-prison/5541760741409/","image":"https://cdnph.upi.com/sv/ph/og/upi/5541760741409/2025/1/2a58827d149c0ca0f517e364567417a4/v1.5/Disgraced-ex-lawmaker-George-Santos-freed-from-prison-by-Trump.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-10-18 00:11:37","author":"Allen Cone","authors":["Allen Cone"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.39},{"id":370280226,"title":"India News | MLA Jitendra Awhad Discharged from 2016 Fergusson College Violance Case","text":"Pune (Maharashtra) [India], October 18 (ANI): The Additional Sessions Court in Pune has discharged Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) MLA Jitendra Awhad of all charges related to the 2016 Fergusson College violence case, citing a lack of evidence.\nThe order, passed by Additional Sessions Judge Aniruddha Subhash Gandhi on October 13, stated that there was \"insufficient evidence to frame charges\" against the legislator.

I'm not a king,” in an interview clip released Friday. \n\nRepublicans have called the protests “Hate America” rallies. \n\nMeanwhile, late late-night show host Jimmy Kimmel — a Trump critic whose show was briefly suspended in September over comments he made about conservative activist Charlie Kirk’s assassination — likened the protests to the American Revolution. \n\n“There is nothing more American than a political protest,” Kimmel said on his show Thursday night. “The American Revolution was a ‘No Kings’ rally.”\n\nHere is everything you need to know about Saturday’s protests. \n\nEzra Levin, a leading organizer of Saturday’s protests, said the demonstrations are a response to what he called Trump’s “crackdown on First Amendment rights.”\n\nLevin, the co-executive director of the nonprofit Indivisible, pointed to Trump’s sweeping immigration crackdown, his unprecedented promises to use federal power to influence midterm elections, restrictions on press freedom and retribution against political opponents.\n\nHe said those steps cumulatively represented a direct threat to constitutionally protected rights.\n\nProtests are planned for more than 2,500 locations nationwide — from the country’s largest city, New York, to small unincorporated, rural communities like East Glacier Ridge, Montana, with roughly 300 residents.\n\nOrganizers will consider the day a success, Levin said, if people are galvanized to become more politically involved on an ongoing basis.\n\nThe last “No Kings” protest took place on June 14 in thousands of cities and towns across the country, in large part to protest a military parade in Washington, D.C., that marked the Army’s 250th anniversary and coincided with Trump’s birthday. \n\n“No Kings” organizers at the time called the parade “coronation,” which was symbolic of what they characterized as Trump’s growing authoritarian overreach.\n\nConfrontations were isolated, and the protests were largely peaceful.\n\nPolice in Los Angeles, where protests over federal immigration enforcement raids erupted the week prior and sparked demonstrations across the country, used tear gas and crowd-control munitions to clear out protesters after the formal event ended. \n\nOfficers in Portland, Oregon, also fired tear gas and projectiles to disperse a crowd that protested in front of a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement building well into the evening.\n\nOne protester was killed during the Salt Lake City march in June. A safety volunteer shot at a person who was accused of pointing a rifle at demonstrators, but inadvertently struck and killed protester Arthur Folasa Ah Loo, a beloved fashion designer.\n\nFour months later, no one has been charged. Experts have said state gun laws may shield both the shooter and the man who brandished a rifle but didn’t fire shots.\n\nJamie Carter, an organizer of one of Saturday’s rallies, said Utah activists considered not participating in this round of “No Kings” demonstrations, but “we also felt that we really had to get back out there.”\n\nOrganizers are not affiliated with the groups that put on the June demonstration that turned deadly. Safety volunteers will be present but unarmed, and all have received de-escalation training, said Carter, of Salt Lake Indivisible. Attendees have been asked not to bring weapons.\n\n“We really want this to be a very uplifting, happy event of people coming together in a community to kind of try to erase and replace some of the bad memories,” she said.\n\nConcerns about large political demonstrations remain heightened in Utah, where Kirk was fatally shot during a college speaking event last month.\n\nTrump’s crackdown against protests, especially in Democratic cities, has intensified since the June marches. He has since sent National Guard troops to Washington, D.C., and Memphis. His efforts to deploy troops to Chicago and Portland have stalled in federal court.\n\nOrganizers in Chicago are expecting tens of thousands of demonstrators at a popular Lake Michigan park, followed by a downtown march.\n\nFederal immigration agents have arrested more than 1,000 people in Chicago, the nation’s third-largest city, with increasingly aggressive tactics since September. Protests have been frequent and well attended in recent weeks, and have boiled over in intense clashes outside a suburban federal immigration processing center.\n\n“People are angrier. It feels so much more immediate,” said Denise Poloyac with Indivisible Chicago. “They’re very concerned about what’s happening in Chicago and around the country.”\n\nThe “No Kings” organizers have led numerous virtual safety trainings leading up to the protests with the help of the American Civil Liberties Union, which is listed as an official partner on the “No Kings” website.\n\nThe trainings informed viewers about their rights during protests — such as whether you are required to carry ID or if wearing a mask is allowed, both vary according to each state — and emphasized de-escalation techniques for encounters with law enforcement.\n\nEach official protest has a safety plan, which includes designated medics and emergency meeting spots.\n\nThe protests have already drawn swift condemnation from some of the country’s top politicians, with House Speaker Mike Johnson dubbing the event the “Hate America rally” at a news conference on Wednesday.\n\nSome state leaders, like Texas Republican Governor Greg Abbott, have decided to activate the National Guard ahead of the protests.\n\n“Texas will deter criminal mischief and work with local law enforcement to arrest anyone engaging in acts of violence or damaging property,” Abbott said in a statement.\n\nDemocratic California Governor Gavin Newsom struck a more optimistic tone, saying he hopes Californians turn out in large numbers and remain peaceful. He said Trump “hopes there is disruption, there’s some violence” that he can exploit.\n\nAssociated Press writers Hannah Schoenbaum, Christopher Weber, Juan A.

George Santos in federal fraud case","text":"NEW YORK (AP) — President Donald Trump said Friday he had commuted the sentence of former U.S. Rep. George Santos, who is serving more than seven years in federal prison after pleading guilty to fraud and identity theft charges.\n\nThe New York Republican was sentenced in April after admitting last year to deceiving donors and stealing the identities of 11 people — including his own family members — to make donations to his campaign.\n\nHe reported to Federal Correctional Institution in Fairton, in southern New Jersey, on July 25 and is being housed in a minimum security prison camp with fewer than 50 other inmates.\n\n“I just signed a Commutation, releasing George Santos from prison, IMMEDIATELY,” Trump posted on his social media platform.\n\n“George Santos was somewhat of a ‘rogue,’ but there are many rogues throughout our Country that aren’t forced to serve seven years in prison,” he wrote.\n\nAndrew Mancilla, one of Santos’ lawyers, said Friday he was “very, very happy with the decision,” though he said it’s unclear at this point when Santos will be released.\n\n“The defense team applauds President Trump for doing the right thing,” Mancilla said by phone. “The sentence was far too long.”\n\nSantos has been in prison for 84 days. During his time behind bars, he has been writing regular dispatches in a local Long Island newspaper, The South Shore Press.\n\nIn his latest letter, published Oct. 13, Santos pleaded to Trump directly, citing his fealty to the president’s agenda and to the Republican Party.\n\n“Sir, I appeal to your sense of justice and humanity — the same qualities that have inspired millions of Americans to believe in you,” he wrote. “I humbly ask that you consider the unusual pain and hardship of this environment and allow me the opportunity to return to my family, my friends, and my community.”\n\nA prominent former House colleague, U.S. Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, also urged the White House to commute his sentence, saying in a letter sent just days into his prison bid that the punishment was “a grave injustice” and a product of judicial overreach.\n\nThe judge in Santos’ case had agreed with federal prosecutors that a stiffer sentence was warranted because Santos didn’t seem remorseful, despite what he and his lawyers claimed.\n\nSantos’ commutation is Trump’s latest high-profile act of clemency for former Republican politicians since retaking the White House in January.\n\nIn late May, he pardoned former U.S. Rep. Michael Grimm, a New York Republican who in 2014 pleaded guilty to underreporting wages and revenue at a restaurant he ran in Manhattan.\n\nHe also pardoned former Connecticut Gov. John Rowland, whose promising political career was upended by a corruption scandal and two federal prison stints.\n\nTrump himself was convicted in a New York court last year in a case involving hush money payments. He derided the case as part of a politically motivated witch hunt.\n\nSantos was once an up-and-coming star for the GOP.\n\nHe became the first openly gay Republican elected to Congress in 2022, flipping a House seat representing parts of Queens and Long Island.\n\nBut Santos served less than a year in office after it was revealed that he had fabricated much of his life story, which in turn led to investigations into how the then-unknown politician had funded his winning campaign.\n\nA son of Brazilian immigrants, Santos had claimed he was a successful business consultant with Wall Street cred and a sizable real estate portfolio.\n\nHe eventually admitted he had never graduated from Baruch College — or been a standout player on the Manhattan college’s volleyball team, as he had claimed. He had never worked at Citigroup and Goldman Sachs.\n\nHe wasn’t even Jewish. Santos insisted he meant he was “Jew-ish” because his mother’s family had a Jewish background, even though he was raised Catholic.\n\nIn truth, the then-34-year-old was struggling financially and even faced eviction.\n\nSantos was charged in 2023 with stealing from donors and his campaign, fraudulently collecting unemployment benefits and lying to Congress about his wealth.\n\nWithin months, he was expelled from the U.S. House of Representatives — just the sixth member in the chamber’s history to be ousted by colleagues.\n\nSantos pleaded guilty the following year just as he was set to stand trial.\n\nCopyright 2025 The Associated Press.

The group’s mission has evolved over the centuries to meet the changing defense needs of the U.S. \n\nThe group also provides services to bolster rescue and construction efforts across the United States. The Corps website highlights the group’s involvement in response to flooding and hurricane disasters in Georgia, North Carolina, Tennessee and Florida, as well as rebuilding efforts in the aftermath of the devastating Los Angeles wildfires this year. \n\nThe Corps calls itself “the Nation’s environmental engineer,” which owns and operates more than 600 dams and 12,000 miles of commercial inland navigation channels. It also maintains harbors, preserves and restores wetlands and supports Army and Air Force installations. \n\nU.S. Army Corps of Engineers contractors remove hazardous materials from a home that was destroyed in the Eaton Fire, on March 26 in Altadena, California. (Photo by Mario Tama/Getty Images)\n\nWhat To Know\n\nVought has said the administration will cut back on Army Corps of Engineers infrastructure projects in major Democratic-run cities, including New York, San Francisco, Boston and Baltimore.\n\n“The Corps will be immediately pausing over $11 billion in lower-priority projects & considering them for cancellation,” Vought wrote, adding that further information would come from the Corps.\n\nVought did not specify the number or nature of the projects considered for the pause, and the Army Corps of Engineers has provided no updates after Vought’s announcement. The most recent posts on the Corps’ X account include a repost of a Department of Defense post on Thursday concerning additional construction of the Border Wall in Arizona and a repost on October 2 announcing the impact of the shutdown on broader Corps operations. \n\n“The most recent appropriations for the Department of War expired at 11:59 p.m. EST on September 30, 2025,” the post by the U.S. Army on October 2 read. “Military personnel will continue in a normal duty status without pay until such time as a continuing resolution or appropriations are passed by Congress and signed into law. Civilian personnel not engaged in excepted activities will be placed in a non-work, non-pay status.” \n\nThe administration of President Donald Trump has pursued further cuts during the shutdown, with Vought indicating on Friday that they may hit more widely than previously believed.\n\nTrump at the beginning of the shutdown announced on Truth Social that he and Vought would look at making extensive workforce reductions, saying that he would seek Vought’s recommendations on which “Democrat Agencies” to reduce and thanking “the Radical Left Democrats” for giving him an “unprecedented opportunity.”\n\nThe reduction impacts around 4,000 federal workers across several agencies, including the departments of Treasury, Health and Human Services, Education and Housing and Urban Development.\n\nBoats of the New York City Fire Department and U.S. Army Corps of Engineers float near the site of a deadly helicopter crash on the Hudson River, on April 10 in Jersey City, New Jersey.

Therefore, I just signed a Commutation, releasing George Santos from prison, IMMEDIATELY. Good luck George, have a great life!', the president continued.\n\nSantos pled guilty to federal wire fraud and aggravated identity theft charges for deceiving donors and stealing people's identities in order to fund his congressional campaign.\n\nDespite his crimes and his lies, Santos had his backers. \n\nRep. Marjorie Taylor Greene formally came to his aid this summer arguing the length of his term represented 'a grave injustice.' \n\nThe plea, which was sent to a Justice Department pardon attorney, came less than two weeks after Santos began his sentence. \n\n'While his crimes warrant punishment, many of my colleagues who I serve with have committed far worse offenses than Mr. Santos yet have faced zero criminal charges,' Greene, a Georgia Republican, wrote without elaborating.\n\n'I strongly believe in accountability for one's actions, but I believe the sentencing of Mr. Santos is an abusive overreach by the judicial system.' \n\nLast month, Greene once again tweeted at length as to why Santos should be released.\n\n'Former Congressman George Santos has been in solitary confinement for nearly 30 days in FCI Fairton NJ. They say it’s “for his safety” due to threats. I’m told he is in his cell 24 hours per day and he is only allowed to get a shower 3 times a week,' Greene began.\n\n'He does not get any sunlight. He’s only allowed to buy stamps from the commissary and is drinking water from the sink...This is torture. I have sent a letter asking for his sentence to commuted, 87 months is way too long for the crimes he was sentenced for.... George should be pardoned!!!' \n\nOn Friday night, Greene publicly thanked Trump for his compassion.\n\n'THANK YOU President Trump for releasing George Santos!! He was unfairly treated and put in solitary confinement, which is torture!!'\n\nIn recent months Greene has has become an unlikely critic of the Republican leadership.\n\nElected to office in 2020, has become one of the most controversial figures in American politics, leaving a trail of racist and antisemitic statements and unapologetically embracing conspiracy theories. \n\nBut while still a supporter of Trump’s agenda, she has also shown a willingness to break with her party on issues including Israel’s war in Gaza; the release of the Epstein files; and now the fight to end the government shutdown.\n\nSantos, meanwhile, was once heralded in the Republican Party for winning a perennially contested New York congressional seat covering parts of Queens and Long Island. But then it became clear that he fabricated much of his life story. \n\nIn one bizarre story from Santos past, there were picture of circulated of him performing as a drag queen in Rio de Janeiro. \n\nWhen initially reported last year, Santos denied he ever dressed in drag at gay pride events, but later admitted to it and at one point even used his former persona to bring in funds. \n\nAmong his famously false claims were that his mother died in the 9/11 attacks. He also had to explain that he was 'Jew-ish,' not Jewish, when questions were raised about his claim that his grandparents had fled the Holocaust.\n\nHe survived two expulsion attempts before a scathing House ethics committee report in late 2023 led to his ouster from Congress, making him only the sixth member in the chamber´s history to be removed by colleagues.\n\nThe former New York Republican was sentenced to 87 months in prison for aggravated identity theft and wire fraud committed around his brief stint on Capitol Hill.\n\nThe fabulist liar made up a host of twisted tails about working on Wall Street, being a collegiate volleyball star and an heir to a real estate empire.\n\nSantos, 37, took office in January 2023, becoming the first openly gay Republican to be elected. He was expelled later that year after his web of lies began to unfurl.\n\nAt one point, he falsely claimed that his mother died in the 9/11 attacks. At another, he had to clarify that he was 'Jew-ish,' not Jewish, when pressed about a claim that his grandparents had fled the Holocaust.\n\nThe lies made him a political pariah before he even got to Washington. \n\nOnce there, he survived two expulsion attempts before a scathing House ethics committee report in late 2023 sealed his fate. \n\nHe was expelled from Congress after a vote later that same year, becoming the sixth member in the chamber's history to be removed by colleagues.\n\nProsecutors presented evidence of Santos spending political donations on Botox, designer clothes, casino holidays, and OnlyFans fees. \n\nHe was also ordered to pay at least $373,749.97 in restitution and forfeit over $200,000, according to a plea agreement he made last year.\n\nSince his sentencing, Santos had been vying for Trump to commute his sentence - as evidenced by long rants he's posted to social media claiming he is the victim of unfair legal prosecution.\n\n'From the halls of Congress to the chaos of cable news what a ride it's been,' he wrote before heading to prison. 'I may be leaving the stage (for now), but trust me legends never truly exit.' \n\nFederal prosecutors indicted Santos for defrauding his own political supporters the same year he took office. \n\nHe took their donations and moved them into his own bank accounts, later using the funds on a slew of personal expenses, prosecutors claimed. \n\nSantos also as alleged to have fraudulently applied for COVID pandemic benefits despite not meeting the qualifications, the feds said. \n\nIn addition, the ex-lawmaker lied on his campaign paperwork to qualify for funding from the Republican Party, prosecutors alleged. He also was accused of using his donor's payment information to make contributions in their name to his campaign. \n\nAt his sentencing the judge noted how Santos appeared unrepentant for his actions and crimes. \n\n'Where is your remorse? U.S. District Court Judge Joanna Seybert asked Santos during the Friday sentencing. 'Where do I see it?' \n\nWith the disgraced lawmaker, the judge said, 'it's always someone else's fault.'\n\nSantos wept as he told the court he felt 'humbled' and realized he had betrayed his constituents' trust.\n\n'I offer my deepest apologies,' he said, adding: 'I cannot rewrite the past, but I can control the road ahead.","summary":"President Donald Trump on Friday evening said he has commuted the prison sentence of George Santos, releasing the disgraced former Republican congressman immediately.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-15203537/Trump-commutes-sentence-jailed-former-GOP-Rep-George-Santos.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/10/18/00/103092799-0-image-m-14_1760745114769.jpg","video":"https://videos.dailymail.co.uk/video/mol/2025/04/25/6968338021282234397/1024x576_MP4_6968338021282234397.mp4","publish_date":"2025-10-17 23:54:55","author":"Editor,James Gordon","authors":["Editor","James Gordon"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.385},{"id":370282250,"title":"Zelensky holds phone call with European leaders after meeting with Trump — media","text":"MOSCOW, October 18. /TASS/.

He offered no proof of a coverup.\n\nAn emailed statement from a Poilievre spokesperson late Thursday said while the RCMP plays \"an important role\" in protecting Canadians, \"RCMP leadership passively accepted Justin Trudeau withholding key witnesses and evidence from investigation\" in the SNC Lavalin affair.\"\n\n\"They also declined to pursue a criminal prosecution of Justin Trudeau’s 2016 Christmas vacation to the Aga Khan’s private island in the Bahamas, for which he was found guilty in 2017 of four violations of the federal Conflict of Interests Act,\" the statement added.\n\nPoilievre's office declined to comment Friday on the Soudas oped, but flagged a social media post from Anna Tomala, chief of staff to Harper.\n\nShe said the oped does not reflect Harper’s views.\n\n\"Mr. Soudas does not speak on behalf of Mr. Harper,\" she wrote.\n\nSoudas wrote that, months after losing the federal election, Poilievre \"seems not to have learned the lessons of his electoral defeat.\"\n\n\"His latest comments show once again he has failed to make the leap from critic to leader,\" he said.\n\nKory Teneycke, former director of communications to the Prime Minister's Office under Stephen Harper and campaign manager for Ontario Premier Doug Ford, called Poilievre's recent comments \"absurd\" and \"a political misstep.\"\n\n\"I don't think they're well advised. I think it's quite Trumpian in tone, which I don't think is really where the Canadian electorate's at,\" he said, citing U.S. President Donald Trump's recent calls for criminal charges against his political enemies.\n\n\"I'm not sure what his objective was in choosing to go down that path, but I don't think it's one that's broadly shared by Conservatives that I speak to anyway.\"\n\nTeneycke, who has been an outspoken critic of Poilievre's leadership, said the Conservative leader's comments had nothing to do with holding the current prime minister accountable.\n\nTeneycke said that while Poilievre seemed to be \"softening his tone\" immediately after the election, he now seems to be falling back into old patterns.\n\n\"I think looking and sounding too much like Trump was a big liability for Poilievre with a lot of Canadian voters and I think it cost them the election,\" he said.\n\n\"My view is that Poilievre was trying to tone that down quite a bit and I sort of thought he was moving in a different direction. This sort of feels like a bit of a relapse, but not in a positive way.\"\n\nIn the interview with Northern Perspective, Poilievre also linked the murder of American conservative influencer Charlie Kirk with what he called an \"authoritarian left\" that was frustrated that it \"couldn't win the argument.\"\n\nKirk, an ally of U.S. President Donald Trump, was killed in September while speaking at a university in Utah.\n\nPoilievre said Kirk, who was known for his debate-style engagements on politics, often won his arguments and when the \"authoritarian left\" couldn't beat him, it \"ultimately ended the argument.\"\n\nHe added the \"radical left\" is trying to drive its opponents out of the political sphere, and that people need to \"stand up against it\" and protect their families.\n\nPolitical violence has targeted both sides of the spectrum, both in the U.S. and in Canada.\n\nIn 2020, an armed man was arrested after he rammed his truck through the gates of Trudeau's official residence. A number of other individuals have been charged after making death threats against Trudeau.\n\nAnd in the U.S. this year, Democratic Minnesota state representative Melissa Hortman was killed in her home with her husband.\n\nPoilievre did not mention violence against the left. He said that he too has taken security precautions to keep his family safe.\n\n\"We've obviously had death threats targeting me. They go after my family, they target my wife,\" Poilievre said.\n\nYaroslav Baran, who served as communications chief for Harper’s leadership campaign, said it's not surprising that a Conservative leader would respond to Kirk's murder.\n\n\"We certainly hear no shortage of it when it's the other way around,\" Baran said. \"We're seeing it more and more all over the map, on the right, on the left.\"\n\nBaran also spoke to Poilievre's comments about the RCMP. He said that while there's no widespread anti-RCMP sentiment among Conservatives, some have concerns about \"potential cosiness\" between the RCMP's leadership and its \"political masters.\"\n\n\"It's not the RCMP rank and file, it's the leadership that can sometimes come into question,\" he said. \"There's probably a pretty broad sentiment among Conservatives that there have been problems with the leadership of the RCMP.\"\n\nPoilievre also spoke during the roughly 30-minute interview about lessons learned from his party's April federal election defeat, saying his party will release its platforms earlier and nominate its candidates sooner.\n\nSoudas wrote that Canadians didn't reject conservative ideas in the last election, but Poilievre himself.\n\n\"Months later, there’s little evidence he has reflected, adapted, or grown. If anything, he seems more committed than ever to the very approach that cost him credibility with the voters he most needed to win,\" Soudas wrote.\n\nLori Turnbull, a professor at Dalhousie University, said Poilievre's statements are directed at the base of supporters he needs behind him to win a leadership review at the party's convention in Calgary in late January.\n\nPoilievre's leadership is up for review by the party membership after losing the April election — and his own Ottawa-area seat.\n\nPoilievre returned to the House of Commons this fall after an MP in a safe Conservative riding stepped aside to let him run in a byelection.\n\nTeneycke said he suspects Poilievre will easily win the leadership vote, since he doesn't see anyone else organizing to replace him.\n\nTurnbull said Poilievre is looking to tap into the people who still distrust Trudeau, and those who think the institutions of government are working against them.\n\n\"I'm not surprised that he's doing this in advance of a leadership review where he's making assumptions about who's going to show up for that,\" she said.\n\n\"The people who are going to show up to an in-person meeting in Calgary in the dead of winter? That's not going to be a cross-section of the Conservative party.\"\n\nTurnbull said she doesn't doubt Poilievre can win the leadership review but his \"limiting\" rhetoric is holding him back with the wider electorate.\n\n\"He's using his old playbook, but it's a different game now,\" she said.","summary":"A top aide to former Conservative prime minister Stephen Harper has lashed out at Pierre Poilievre over his leadership of the Conservative party and his recent comments attacking the RCMP's treatment of Justin Trudeau.\n\nIn a recent interview with a YouTube channel called Northern Perspective, Poil...","url":"https://www.castanet.net/news/Canada/578644/Top-aide-to-former-PM-Harper-rips-Poilievre-s-comments-about-RCMP-and-Trudeau","image":"https://www.castanet.net/content/2025/10/fc92e3f8bd9184c3fcae105e084f4f57c02e05dcce23723f3437bb41a7065d75.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-10-17 23:46:00","author":"Catherine Morrison,The Canadian Press","authors":["Catherine Morrison","The Canadian Press"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"ca","sentiment":-0.328},{"id":370283242,"title":"Kremlin Abuzz at Prospect of a Trump-Putin Meeting","text":"The Summit That Sparked a Kremlin Rally: How a Single Phone Call Became a Storyline\n\nThe midday news opener on Russia’s most-watched state channel felt less like information and more like curtain-raising: “Donald Trump has heard Vladimir Putin — a bad sign for warmongers,” the announcer intoned, voice steady, the map of Europe glowing behind him.\n\nIt was a line designed to do everything that modern propaganda does best: condense a complicated diplomatic moment into a moral fable, draw clear heroes and villains, and invite viewers to feel both vindicated and threatened. Three and a half years after Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine, Russian state television presented a simple thesis — the warmongers are not in Moscow; they are in Brussels, London and Berlin. The friend, on the other hand, is the one who picks up the phone.\n\nWhy Hungary?\n\nWhen word slipped out that a face-to-face meeting between the U.S. and Russian leaders might be prepared in “the coming days,” according to an aide to Vladimir Putin, chatter quickly converged on a single name: Budapest. “Hungary has always been the voice of wisdom and peacekeeping in Europe,” Kirill Dmitriev, the Kremlin’s close economic envoy, said in a statement that was aired repeatedly across pro-government outlets.\n\nIt’s a neat narrative arc. Viktor Orbán, Hungary’s conservative prime minister, has often been painted as the troublesome sibling in the European family — skeptical of sanctions, courting Russian investment, and wary of any policy that might unmoor his domestic agenda. For Moscow, calling a summit in Hungary plays like theatre: a picturesque Central European capital, a hospitable host, and the implicit message that not all of Europe is rowing in the same direction.\n\nStagecraft and Signals\n\nThese summits are as much about optics as they are about outcomes. A handshake in a silk-paneled room, waves caught on-camera, a joint photo op — those images rewrite headlines and remake reputations. “Putin thrives on the ritual of summitry,” an American foreign policy analyst told me. “Every face-to-face meeting is, for him, an act of legitimation. It signals he’s not a pariah but a player.”\n\nFor many Kremlin commentators, the meeting itself is a strategic score. “A personal meeting is arguably his favourite thing to do,” said one commentator on the popular program Time Will Tell, where three-hour panels of pundits and political guests parse every whisper out of the Kremlin. “It elevates him globally.”\n\nWhat the Kremlin Is Selling\n\nAcross Russia’s pro-government media there’s a steady, repeated argument: that the U.S. — or at least a U.S. leader willing to speak directly to Putin — represents a corrective to a quarrelsome and increasingly isolated Europe. Britain and Germany, for example, have been singled out for criticism as the supposed engines of escalation. “They moved the locomotive of war,” a repeat line on morning shows suggested, in language meant to conjure hubristic empire-builders.\n\nThe rhetorical pivot is simple. Europe is cast as the coalition of “warmongers,” the U.S. as the pragmatist or at least the debater, and Hungary as the calm, steady voice. In opinion pieces and talk shows, a phrase like “coalition of losers” is trotted out to describe Ukraine’s allies — a clear counterpoint to the earlier Western talk of a “coalition of the willing.”\n\nHow the Narrative Lands in Budapest\n\nWalk the Danube embankment in Budapest and you’ll find people nodding, shrugging, or furrowing their brows at the idea of hosting great-power choreography. “If it brings a chance to stop the killing, why not?” said Anna K., a 62-year-old history teacher sipping espresso near the Parliament. “But we also know how the show works — it doesn’t mean promises are kept.”\n\nA street vendor selling paprika and postcards laughed ruefully when I asked whether Hungarians relish the attention. “We like visitors,” he said, “but we are not props in someone else’s fight.”\n\nSmoke, Mirrors—and a Negotiating Playbook\n\nBeyond the pageantry, analysts warn there is a familiar pattern in Moscow’s diplomacy: charm, delay, and revision. “There’s a formula — flattery first, then evasion,” a seasoned diplomat with experience on Eastern European files told me. “You leave the summit with pictures and statements. You often don’t leave with the concessions or mechanisms that end a war.”\n\nThat has been the frequent complaint from Kyiv and many Western capitals: meetings without sustainable tracks for de-escalation or enforceable mechanisms. At the same time, to Russia, a summit with the U.S. leader — especially if the leader is presented domestically as congenial — rewrites the argument about isolation. It says: Russia remains a country whose word matters.\n\nWhat’s at Stake: Beyond Choreography\n\nAsk yourself: are we watching diplomacy or theatre? The answer matters because the human toll does not perform on cue. Since February 24, 2022, the war in Ukraine has displaced millions, shattered lives, and redrawn security calculations across Europe. International monitors and humanitarian agencies have documented enormous civilian suffering — the kind that a hand-written communique can’t erase.\n\n“Summits can quiet headlines for a day,” said a humanitarian worker who has worked in Ukrainian displacement camps. “But without concrete, verified steps — ceasefires, withdrawal, humanitarian corridors — the cameras won’t stop the suffering.”\n\nEchoes of a Larger Crisis\n\nWhat plays out in television studios and state bulletins connects to deeper themes: the fragility of alliances in polarized times, the performative power of leadership, and the way information channels shape public belief. An electorate that relies on a single dominant source of news is especially vulnerable to narratives that simplify complexity into winners and losers.\n\nAnd there is another layer: the domestic politics that both shape and are shaped by these international dramas. Leaders use summits to burnish profiles at home. Public diplomacy becomes campaign fodder, and foreign policy becomes a stage for domestic validation.\n\nQuestions to Take Away\n\nSo where does that leave the rest of us? Does a meeting in Budapest mark a turning point, a pause, or simply a new sequence of managed expectations? Will images of handshakes be followed by enforceable actions that ease suffering, or will they be another episode in a long-running series of diplomatic theatre?\n\nThose are questions best answered by what comes after the cameras are packed away: the paper, the clauses, the monitoring teams, and, most importantly, the lived experience of people on the ground.\n\nAs one Ukrainian volunteer put it to me over a late-night phone call: “Photos are nice. Food on the table is nicer.” It’s a blunt way to remind us that the real metric of diplomacy should not be how it looks but who it helps.","summary":"The Summit That Sparked a Kremlin Rally: How a Single Phone Call Became a Storyline The midday news opener on Russia’s most-watched state channel felt less like information and more like curtain-raising: &#8220;Donald Trump has heard Vladimir Putin — a bad sign for warmongers,&#8221; the announcer intoned, voice steady, the map of Europe glowing behind [&#8230;]","url":"https://jowhar.com/kremlin-abuzz-at-prospect-of-a-trump-putin-meeting/","image":"https://jowhar.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Photo-coverage-Trump-and-Putin-meet-for-summit-in-Alaska.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-10-17 23:43:18","author":"hanad","authors":["hanad"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"so","sentiment":0.13},{"id":370278456,"title":"Laura: 'Peace warrior' Trump understands leverage","text":"to top close Video This video is playing in picture-in-picture.\n\nIngraham Angle October 17, 2025 07:42 \n\n Laura: 'Peace warrior' Trump understands leverage \n Fox News host Laura Ingraham juxtaposes President Donald Trump's efforts to end wars against Democrats' obsession with protests on 'The Ingraham Angle.'\n Tags POLITICSV-VIDEOTHE INGRAHAM ANGLEDONALD TRUMP","summary":"Fox News host Laura Ingraham juxtaposes President Donald Trump&apos;s efforts to end wars against Democrats&apos; obsession with protests on &apos;The Ingraham Angle.&apos;","url":"https://www.foxnews.com/video/6382907366112","image":"https://a57.foxnews.com/cf-images.us-east-1.prod.boltdns.net/v1/static/694940094001/89672b62-4293-488b-96f3-7fee7ffbe9ea/1a3a0dd3-c204-4095-997a-f7768e3c35b9/1280x720/match/1024/512/image.jpg?ve=1&tl=1","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-10-17 23:42:57","author":null,"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.252},{"id":370273830,"title":"President Trump commutes the prison sentence of George Santos","text":"President Donald Trump announced on Friday that he commuted the prison term of George Santos, the disgraced New York Republican who was sentenced to more than seven years in prison for a litany of crimes after he was expelled from the House over accusations that he stole money from campaign donors.\n\nTrump made the announcement in a post on Truth Social on Friday, saying he had signed a commutation to release Santos from prison immediately.\n\n\"George Santos was somewhat of a 'rogue,' but there are many rogues throughout our Country that aren't forced to serve seven years in prison,\" Trump wrote.\n\nSantos, a fierce supporter of Trump, pleaded guilty in 2024 to wire fraud and aggravated identity theft. Prosecutors said Santos was responsible for a \"mountain of lies, theft, and fraud\" aimed at enriching himself and deceiving campaign donors. He began his sentence in July of this year at the Federal Correctional Institution in Fairton, New Jersey.\n\nSoon after Santos was elected in 2020, reports that he had fabricated numerous aspects of his identity began to trickle out. He later admitted to lying about his education, employment and his upbringing. Santos was still sworn into Congress in 2022 despite the inconsistencies raised about his background and campaign finances.\n\nHis falsehoods would catch up with him less than a year after his term began. In 2023, the House voted 311-114 to remove him from office. Almost every Democrat and more than 100 Republicans voted to expel Santos.\n\nThe vote made Santos just the sixth representative to ever be expelled from the chamber but the first to be expelled without being convicted of a crime. At the time of his expulsion, Santos was facing 23 criminal charges.\n\nTrump compared Santos' crimes to claims made by Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., more than 15 years ago about his military service. Blumenthal has previously admitted that he \"misspoke\" about serving in Vietnam.

The post also included a lengthy missive in which Trump compares Santos to Connecticut Sen. Richard Blumenthal. \n\n “George Santos was somewhat of a \"rogue,\" but there are many rogues throughout our Country that aren't forced to serve seven years in prison,” Trump began the post. “I started to think about George when the subject of Democrat Senator Richard 'Da Nang Dick' Blumenthal came up again.” \n\n According to CNN, Trump called for a federal investigation into Blumenthal in July, alleging that the Connecticut senator lied about his service in the Vietnam War. Blumenthal denied Trump’s claims, telling the outlet that Trump’s allegations were “completely deceptive and distorted.” \n\n “His War Hero status, and even minimal service in our Military, was totally and completely MADE UP,” Trump continued. “This is far worse than what George Santos did, and at least Santos had the Courage, Conviction, and Intelligence to ALWAYS VOTE REPUBLICAN!” \n\n Also in his post, Trump alleged that Santos has been in “solitary confinement for long stretches of time, and by all accounts, has been horribly mistreated.” \n\n Trump ended the post with a single line of well wishes for Santos: “Good luck George, have a great life!”\n\n “We never gave up on him,\" Santos' attorney Robert Fantone said in a statement to PEOPLE. \"And now it looks like George’s sentence is fair and commensurate with the nature and severity of conduct.”\n\n Santos was convicted in August 2024 on 23 counts of wire fraud and aggravated identity theft. He was later sentenced to seven years in prison, with federal prosecutors seeking a longer prison sentence due to his “belligerent,” “attention-seeking” behavior.

The choice has raised questions, because Putin is wanted by the International Criminal Court. However, Hungary appears unlikely to cooperate with the warrant and is in the process of leaving the court, the Associated Press reports.\n\nWhen HuffPost asked the White House who chose the location for the meeting, White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt replied, “Your mom did.” White House Communications Director Steven Cheung also followed up with, “Your mom,” the outlet reports.\n\nHuffPost then asked Leavitt if she thought her response was funny.\n\nShe responded: “It’s funny to me that you actually consider yourself a journal [sic]. You are a far left hack who nobody takes seriously, including your colleagues in the media, they just don’t tell you that to your face.

According to the defense, the post was later reposted by Justice Department deputy public affairs director Chad Gilmartin, who wrote that Trump 'is absolutely right.'\n\nThe Department of Justice declined to comment publicly on the filing, and the White House referred questions to the DOJ, NBC News reported. Daily Mail has reached out to the Department of Justice.\n\nFederal prosecutors however told the court they had the posts removed after learning of them and argued the officials involved were not part of the prosecution team.\n\n'They operate entirely outside the scope of the prosecution team, possess no operational role in the investigative or prosecutorial functions of the Mangione matter, and are not 'associated' with this litigation,' prosecutors said in a letter earlier this month.\n\nMangione's attorneys also renewed allegations of political interference by Attorney General Pam Bondi, who in April directed federal prosecutors to seek the death penalty, calling it part of 'President Trump's agenda to stop violent crime and Make America Safe Again.'\n\nIn a Fox News interview that month, Bondi said, 'If there ever was a death [penalty] case, this is one.'\n\nThe defense argues Bondi's comments, along with Trump's public statements, have 'poisoned the jury pool' and violated Mangione's due process rights.\n\nThe judge overseeing the case previously warned DOJ officials that further public comments could lead to sanctions, The Daily Beast reported.\n\nThe filing also alleges coordination between the administration and UnitedHealth executives, citing recent meetings with DOJ officials as evidence of 'unprecedented intervention.' The insurer is currently under federal investigation for its Medicare billing practices.\n\nThis is not the first time Mangione's defense has sought to have the charges thrown out.\n\nA previous motion last month accused the Trump administration of using the case to promote a 'law and order' agenda after Trump referred to Mangione as a 'pure assassin' on social media.\n\nMangione's attorneys now argue that the administration's efforts to tie him to Antifa represent a deliberate attempt to frame the case as part of a broader political narrative.\n\n'The government has turned Mr. Mangione's prosecution into a political spectacle,' the defense wrote, 'and in doing so, has jeopardized his right to a fair trial.","summary":"Luigi Mangione's lawyers are taking direct aim at President Donald Trump, accusing his administration of using their client as 'political ammunition.'","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-15203487/Luigi-Mangiones-lawyers-blast-Trump-connecting-alleged-assassin-antifa-ditch-bid-dismiss-charges.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/10/18/00/103092673-0-image-m-11_1760742720293.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-10-17 23:33:43","author":"Editor,Samantha Rutt","authors":["Editor","Samantha Rutt"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.31},{"id":370279846,"title":"Trump Commutes George Santos' Prison Sentence, Orders Immediate Release","text":"President Donald Trump announced Friday on Truth Social that he has commuted the prison sentence of ex-Congressman George Santos, who had been serving a seven-year term for multiple fraud convictions. In his post, Trump characterized Santos as a “rogue,” but argued that others with similar or worse conduct have not faced such severe punishment. The former president also claimed that Santos had been subjected to harsh treatment while incarcerated, including prolonged periods in solitary confinement. “George has been in solitary confinement for long stretches of time and, by all accounts, has been horribly mistreated,” Trump wrote. “Therefore, I just signed a Commutation, releasing George Santos from prison, IMMEDIATELY. Good luck George, have a great life.” Santos had been serving his sentence at the Federal Correctional Institution in Fairton, New Jersey, according to the federal Bureau of Prisons. In a lengthier explanation accompanying the announcement, Trump drew a comparison between Santos and Senator Richard Blumenthal (D-CT), whom he criticized for previously misstating his military service during the Vietnam War. Trump argued that Blumenthal’s actions were “far worse” than Santos’s offenses and suggested that political bias played a role in Santos’s punishment. “At least Santos had the courage, conviction, and intelligence to always vote Republican,” Trump added. The commutation means Santos will be released from prison immediately, though his convictions remain in place. Commutations reduce or eliminate a sentence but do not expunge the underlying criminal record. Georgia Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene was among the biggest proponents of a pardon or relief for Santos after he went to prison on July 25 for wire fraud and aggravated identity theft related to hundreds of thousands of dollars that he stole from supporters. George Santos was sentenced to 87 months in prison and ordered to pay nearly $579,000 in restitution and forfeiture after pleading guilty in 2024. According to the Justice Department, Santos committed multiple scams, including falsifying campaign fundraising reports to qualify for federal support, stealing credit card information from donors, defrauding political contributors through a limited liability company, and fraudulently claiming unemployment benefits during the COVID-19 pandemic. He also lied to the House by overstating his income and assets.

Well, all of those people who went to the right schools don’t seem to have done very well in the Middle East.\n\nOn the face of it, things haven’t changed that much, but it’s apparent that significant change is now possible. In league with Benjamin Netanyahu, Trump has quieted the Iran threat for now. Trump then talked Netanyahu into stopping the firing of further missiles into Iran unnecessarily.

Most Democrats today seem to think that “preserving democracy” equals dominance by Democrats on all levels. (And, yes, many Republicans wrongly seek GOP dominance.) But either would actually be the destruction of democracy. And many seem to think that even the courts should always rule the way they think they should rule.

Yes, beautiful. I hope people notice. It’s a good — it’s actually very stylish. I like it,” Trump remarked, clearly impressed.\n\nThe conversation, which started off lighthearted with sartorial compliments, soon transitioned into a more serious discussion about the ongoing conflict in Ukraine and Russian President Vladimir Putin’s intentions for peace. However, the initial wardrobe praise marked a notable change in tone from previous interactions between the two leaders.\n\nZelensky’s change in dress followed criticism from the Trump administration regarding his casual military attire during a visit to the Oval Office in February, which sparked a heated exchange.\n\nDuring that earlier visit, when a reporter inquired about his choice to forgo a suit, Zelensky replied, “I will wear a suit after this war finishes.”\n\nTrump’s long–time fixation on physical appearance has become more frequent in recent months –– and he does not discriminate, whether they are men or women, reporters, world leaders or even anyone from his own staff. \n\nEven when conducting diplomacy over war, Trump sees aesthetics as half the battle.\n\nWhile addressing the Israeli Knesset on Monday, President Trump singled out Defense Forces Chief Eyal Zamir, saying, ‘You know, the guy’s central casting. Let’s put him in a movie. Look at him.’\n\nShortly after, Trump shared a memory with the lawmakers about meeting Gen. Dan Caine, now the US chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, along with other military leaders. ‘Everybody was like central casting,’ Trump added. ‘Between him and you guys over here, we could get rich making movies, okay?’\n\nLater that day while attending the Gaza peace ceremony in Egypt, Trump drew attention to Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni, commenting on her looks.\n\n‘She’s a beautiful young woman,’ he remarked. ‘In the US, calling a woman ‘beautiful’ can end your political career, but I’m willing to take that risk. \n\nHe continued, ‘Where is she? There she is. You don’t mind being called beautiful, do you? Because you truly are.’\n\nAnd in another instance, back in late June at a peace signing event between the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Rwanda –– President Trump made comments about the beauty of Angolan journalist Hariana Veras. \n\n‘I shouldn’t say this because it’s politically incorrect: She’s beautiful,’ Trump said. ‘And you are beautiful,’ before joking about how he shouldn’t say things like that because it could be the end of his political career. \n\nNevertheless, the comments continued. \n\nIn August, Trump made the same comments regardless of him joking it could ‘get him into trouble.’\n\n‘I look at Pam. I would never say she’s beautiful, because that’s going to be the end of my political career,’ he said. \n\nDuring his September visit to Great Britain, Trump told Catherine, Princess of Wales, ‘You’re beautiful, so beautiful.’ \n\nDuring a conversation with reporters, Trump also commented on his press secretary Karoline Leavitt’s looks. \n\n‘That face… and those lips,’ he remarked. ‘They move like a machine gun, right?’ Trump said with a laugh.\n\nThere was even one time, where he commented on his own looks, when a reporter asked him if he would be visiting Argentina.\n\n‘I’d love to go to Argentina. I’d like to be like Biden. I’d like to go to the beach,’ Trump said. ‘You know, my legs are not quite as thin as his, since my legs are slightly heavy and my arms are slightly larger. My body is a little bit larger.

President Donald Trump has commuted the more than seven-year prison sentence of former US representative George Santos for fraud and identity theft, ordering his immediate release.\n\nSantos, who was

Truth Social, before repeating debunked claims about the Democratic Senator Richard Blumenthal.\n\nAdditionally, the president claimed Santos “has been in solitary confinement for long stretches of time and, by all accounts, has been horribly mistreated” and praised the ex-congressman for having “the Courage, Conviction, and Intelligence to ALWAYS VOTE REPUBLICAN!”\n\nSantos, who was expelled by colleagues from Congress in 2023 after making a series of brazen false claims about his life story, had appealed to Trump earlier in the week for a reprieve.\n\n“I have faced my share of consequences, and I take full responsibility for my actions,” Santos wrote in a letter to the president published by The South Shore Press, a New York news outlet. “But no man, no matter his flaws, deserves to be lost in the system, forgotten and unseen, enduring punishment far beyond what justice requires.”\n\nIn the message, Santos said he has been in solitary confinement since August following an alleged death threat against him.\n\nRepublican congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene praised the president for freeing Santos.\n\n“He was unfairly treated and put in solitary confinement, which is torture!!”

As everyone remembers, ‘Da Nang’ stated for almost twenty years that he was a proud Vietnam Veteran, having endured the worst of the War, watching the Wounded and Dead as he raced up the hills and down the valleys, blood streaming from his face. He was ‘a Great Hero,’ he would leak to any and all who would listen — And then it happened!

George has been in solitary confinement for long stretches of time and, by all accounts, has been horribly mistreated. Therefore, I just signed a Commutation, releasing George Santos from prison, IMMEDIATELY. Good luck George, have a great life!” Trump added.\n\nPrior to being expelled from the House by his colleagues in December 2021 over his federal charges, the former Republican lawmaker had served nearly a year in Congress. According to a November 2023 House Ethics Committee report, lawmakers also found he had committed additional wrongdoing beyond his guilty plea.

They’re putting me in a violent prison. It’s a medium facility. I’m not a streetwise guy. I don’t know how to fight,” Santos said. “I’m a gay man. Statistics tell you what happens to gay men in prison. I don’t know that I survive this. I’m being honest. I mean, I can’t change that. It’s sad. I have a family.”\n\nShortly after the interview, Santos began his prison sentence, posting a message to his supporters on July 24 on X.\n\n“The curtain falls, the spotlight dims, and the rhinestones are packed.

At the time, Trump described it as short-term aid “during this little transition” with the expectation that automakers would move production lines back to the U.S.\n\nThe extension and adjustments came after conversations with the auto industry, senior administration officials said. The goal is to both expand domestic production and make it more competitive. The officials insisted on anonymity as a condition for talking to reporters ahead of Trump signing the proclamation.\n\nThe amended action provides a rebate of 3.75% relative to the sales price of a domestically assembled vehicle. That figure was reached by putting the 25% import tax on parts that make up 15% of a vehicle’s sales price. Multiplying those two percentages together is equal to 3.75%.\n\nThe rebate will also now be offered to manufacturers of trucks and engines, officials said.\n\nTrump had posted on his social media site Oct. 6 about the new tariffs on imported trucks. Buses will also be tariffed at 10% as part of the action.\n\nThe new tariffs do not apply to imports covered under the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement on trade. That pact, which went into effect in 2020, is up for renegotiation next year.\n\nThe moves come at a delicate moment for the auto industry as consumers are enduring sticker shock. According to Kelley Blue Book, buyers of new autos spent an average of $50,080 in September, the highest average on record. New auto prices have increased 3.6% from a year ago.","summary":"The president extended what was supposed to have been a short-term rebate until 2030.","url":"https://www.twincities.com/2025/10/17/trump-auto-tariffs-extension/","image":"https://www.twincities.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Trump_42676.jpg?w=1600&resize=1600,900","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-10-17 23:11:22","author":"Associated Press","authors":["Associated Press"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.313},{"id":370279844,"title":"George Santos' Letter To Trump Revealed After Sentence Commutation.

In the letter, Santos described the harsh conditions of solitary confinement at the Federal Correctional Institution in Fairton, New Jersey, where he had been held since August 28, 2025. He said life in the Special Housing Unit (SHU) was like being trapped in a “small steel cage twenty-four hours a day,” with minimal contact with the outside world. Santos admitted he had made mistakes but asked Trump for fairness and a chance to rebuild his life and return to his family and community. “I am not asking for sympathy,” Santos wrote. “I am asking for fairness, for the chance to rebuild.

Calling Santos “somewhat of a rogue,” Trump argued that many people commit wrongdoing without facing such long prison terms. He added, “At least Santos had the courage, conviction, and intelligence to ALWAYS VOTE REPUBLICAN!” Trump also compared Santos’ actions to those of Democratic Senator Richard Blumenthal, whom he accused of falsely claiming Vietnam War service. He said, “George Santos’ actions are far less serious than the complete fraud committed by Blumenthal, who never served in Vietnam despite claiming heroism for almost 20 years.” The president highlighted what he described as the harsh treatment Santos faced in prison, including long periods in solitary confinement, and said the commutation was immediate, wishing Santos “a great life.” What George Santos Did Santos had been sentenced to 87 months in prison for wire fraud and aggravated identity theft. He had also been ordered to pay restitution to victims totaling $373,749.97, along with $205,002.97 in forfeiture. He had pled guilty to the charges in 2024.

Trump described Santos as a \"rogue\" but argued that many others with worse offenses have faced less severe punishment.

George Santos, a Republican, served as the US Representative for New York’s 3rd Congressional District from January 3 to December 1, 2023. He won a surprising victory over incumbent Democrat Tom Suozzi in the 2022 midterm elections. However, his political career was soon engulfed by controversy. At 37, Santos faced intense media scrutiny after it was revealed that he had fabricated large portions of his personal and professional background, including his education, work experience, and heritage. He also failed to disclose a criminal record and pending lawsuits, prompting bipartisan calls for his resignation. In a historic move, the House of Representatives voted 311-114 to expel Santos, making him the first member ever expelled without prior conviction or ties to the Confederacy. Santos later pleaded guilty to identity theft and wire fraud in August 2024 and was sentenced in April 2025 to 87 months in prison. He began serving his sentence in July at the Federal Correctional Institution in Fairton, New Jersey. The Justice Department detailed multiple schemes by Santos, including falsifying campaign fundraising reports to secure federal support, stealing donors’ credit card information, defrauding political contributors through a limited liability company, and unlawfully claiming unemployment benefits during the COVID-19 pandemic. He was also found to have significantly overstated his income and assets to Congress. Santos was ordered to pay nearly $579,000 in restitution and forfeiture as part of his sentence.

He has formally requested a major disaster declaration from the White House.\n\nOne of the most severely impacted communities, Kipnuk, saw an overwhelming 90% of its homes—totaling 121—destroyed, as per Dunleavy’s report. In Kwigillingok, approximately one-third of the homes became uninhabitable after three dozen houses were swept away.\n\nThe flooding was triggered by the remnants of Typhoon Halong, which hit the region with the intensity of a Category 2 hurricane, unleashing high surf on the low-lying areas. The disaster claimed one life, left two individuals missing, and forced rescue teams to save dozens as their homes were carried off by the floodwaters.\n\nEfforts are underway to evacuate residents from the waterlogged Alaska Native villages. More than 2,000 people have sought refuge in various locations—some in local schools, others in larger communities in southwest Alaska, and many have been airlifted to Anchorage by military aircraft. Dunleavy anticipates that over 1,500 will eventually need relocation to major cities in the state.\n\nIn Anchorage, the state’s largest city, approximately 575 evacuees have already been relocated by the Alaska National Guard to a sports arena and a convention center, with more flights planned for Friday and Saturday. Authorities are currently focused on transitioning evacuees from temporary shelters to both short-term and longer-term housing solutions.\n\n“Given the challenges posed by time, space, distance, geography, and weather, it is highly unlikely that many survivors will be able to return to their communities this winter,” Dunleavy stated. “While agencies are prioritizing urgent repairs, some communities may simply not be able to sustain winter occupancy in the harsh climate of the U.S. Arctic.”\n\nThe federal government already has been assisting with search and rescue, damage assessments, environmental response and evacuation support. A major disaster declaration by President Donald Trump could provide federal assistance programs for individuals and public infrastructure, including money for emergency and permanent work.\n\nThe three members of Alaska’s congressional delegation on Friday sent a letter to Trump, urging swift approval.\n\nThe storm surge pummeled a sparsely populated region off the state’s main road system where communities are reachable only by air or water this time of year. The villages typically have just a few hundred residents, who hunt and fish for much of their food, and relocating to the state’s major cities will bring a vastly different lifestyle.\n\nAlexie Stone, of Kipnuk, arrived in Anchorage in a military jet with his brothers, children and mom, after his home was struck by the flooding. They’ve been staying at the Alaska Airlines Center at the University of Alaska, where the Red Cross provided evacuees with cots, blankets and hygiene supplies.\n\nAt least for the foreseeable future, he thinks he might try to find a job at a grocery store; he used to work in one in Bethel.\n\n“It’s going to be, try to look for a place and find a job,” Stone said Friday. “We’re starting a new life here in Anchorage.”\n\nJohnson reported from Seattle.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nANCHORAGE, Alaska — The devastation caused by recent flooding in remote Alaskan&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Alaska Faces Severe Flooding: Evacuations Underway with Long-Term Displacement Expected first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/news/us/alaska-faces-severe-flooding-evacuations-underway-with-long-term-displacement-expected/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Alaska-evacuations-today-Typhoon-storm-devastation-flooding-so-bad-many.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-10-17 22:59:26","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.221},{"id":370280784,"title":"Ex-woke billionaire Marc Benioff issues groveling apology after telling Trump to send National Guard to San Francisco","text":"Tech billionaire Marc Benioff made an about face after calling on Donald Trump to send the National Guard to San Francisco after facing outrage from inside and outside his company. \n\nThe Salesforce CEO and former Hillary Clinton donor said the commander in chief should deploy federal troops to the struggling city in a New York Times interview earlier this week. \n\nBenioff claimed he was most concerned about safety surrounding Dreamforce, the annual tech conference his company runs in San Francisco, now heavily focused on AI technology. \n\nHowever, his comments quickly received backlash as entertainers booked for the event pulled out and a key investor resigned. Benioff then said he was sorry for asking the president to do what he did in Washington to the city by the bay. \n\n'Having listened closely to my fellow San Franciscans and our local officials - and after the largest and safest Dreamforce in our history - I do not believe the National Guard is needed to address safety in San Francisco,' Benioff said. \n\n'My earlier comment came from an abundance of caution around the event, and I sincerely apologize for the concern it caused,' Benioff added. \n\n'It’s my firm belief that our city makes the most progress when we all work together in a spirit of partnership. I remain deeply grateful to Mayor [Daniel] Lurie, SFPD, and all our partners, and am fully committed to a safer, stronger San Francisco.' \n\nWhen reached for comment, White House spokesperson Abigail Jackson called Trump's deployment to DC 'tremendously successful' and called on Benioff and Bay Area liberals to get with the program. \n\n'San Francisco Democrats should look at the tremendous results in DC and Memphis and listen to fellow Democrat Mayor Bowser and welcome the President in to clean up their city.'\n\nBenioff, who owns Time magazine, angered Democrats after he declared his full support for additional law enforcement officers in Fog City.\n\nThe New York Times also reported that Benioff pitched ICE on hiring 10,000 new agents and enhancing deportation operations using Salesforce AI tech.\n\nElon Musk backed the fellow tech giant CEO in an X post on Sunday, writing: 'SF downtown is a drug zombie apocalypse.'\n\nBenioff's statement followed Trump's fiery shots at the Democrat-run city in August, slamming it's leadership and current state.\n\n'Look at what the Democrats have done to San Francisco,' the president told reporters in a press statement.\n\nHowever, liberals balked at the statement, with comedians Kumail Nanjiani and Ilana Glazer canceling their appearances at Dreamforce, The San Francisco Chronicle reported. \n\nFurthermore, Ron Conway - a man nicknamed 'The Godfather of Silicon Valley' resigned from the Salesforce Foundation's board on Thursday in a fiery email to Benioff.\n\nConway, a prominent Democratic donor, said he was resigning because of Benioff's comments.\n\n'It saddens me immensely to say that with your recent comments, and failure to understand their impact, I now barely recognize the person I have so long admired,' Conway wrote to Benioff.\n\nConway had been a director of Salesforce's philanthropic arm for a decade and a close friend of Benioff for over 25 years, per the NYT.\n\nSalesforce, which owns the tallest skyscraper that dominates in the downtown financial sector, boasts a philanthropic history of donating millions to fund San Francisco.\n\nHowever, arrests for petty drug crimes have increased amid Mayor Daniel Lurie's attempts to crackdown on the city's drug problem.\n\nBenioff's claims seemingly contrast with his previous progressive beliefs, leaving many San Franciscans shocked.\n\nHe donated to the Hillary Clinton campaign in 2016 and has spoken of his friendship with Democrat Governor Gavin Newsom. \n\nIn 2018, he slammed his fellow San Francisco billionaires by saying they're 'hoarding' money and not aiding the homelessness crisis.\n\nThe billionaire criticized Jack Dorsey, co-found of Twitter, in an interview with the Guardian.\n\n'He just doesn't want to give, that's all. And he hasn't given anything of consequence in the city.'\n\nBenioff has called out affluent business moguls in the past to aid in the homeless crisis, and even runs the UCSF Benioff Homelessness and Housing Initiative.\n\nIn 2018, he funded a city ballot measure campaign to tax businesses, including Salesforce, to fund services for the homeless.\n\nSalesforce this week announced their $15 billion investment to the city over the next five years because they 'believe deeply in it's future'.\n\nThe billionaire mogul wrote on X that he believes the city's public safety challenges are real.\n\n'Every possible pathway' needs to be explored to create a safer city, he said, adding that Salesforce is providing an $1 million to support larger hiring bonuses for new police officers.\n\n'It's proof that collaboration works and a reminder that the city needs more resources to keep San Franciscans safe year-round,' he wrote.\n\nFor his company's Dreamforce conference this week, Benioff hired hundreds of off-duty law enforcement officers to patrol the convention area, \n\nSpeaking to the NYT, he warned that the city's police force is underfunded, and said he planned for there to be cops 'on every corner... how it used to be.'\n\nBenioff said that his political affiliation is independent and he's supported both Democratic and Republican candidates.","summary":"Salesforce CEO - and former Hillary Clinton donor - Benioff has said he is sorry for asking the president to do what he did in Washington to the city by the bay","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-15203329/marc-benioff-apologizes-Donald-Trump-National-Guard-San-Francisco.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/10/17/23/102904597-0-Marc_Benioff_the_CEO_of_software_giant_Salesforce_recently_said_-a-8_1760740993264.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-10-17 22:56:49","author":"Editor,Stephen M.
