In June, the United Nations said it was drastically scaling back its global humanitarian aid plans due to the “deepest funding cuts ever”.\n\n“Even before the quake, the reduced funding had forced WFP to drastically shrink our assistance to reach only the most vulnerable – leaving millions of hungry people without support,” the World Food Program said on Monday.\n\n‘Fear and tension’\n\n“There is a lot of fear and tension … Children and women were screaming. We had never experienced anything like this in our lives,” Ijaz Ulhaq Yaad, a member of the agricultural department in Nurgal told AFP.\n\nMany living in quake-hit villages were among the more than four million Afghans who have returned to the country from Iran and Pakistan in recent years.\n\n“They wanted to build their homes here,” Yaad added.\n\nNangarhar and Kunar provinces border Pakistan and have received many waves of Afghan returnees deported or forced to leave, often with no work and nowhere to go.\n\nUnited Nations chief Antonio Guterres expressed his condolences to those impacted by the “devastating” earthquake and said the UN would “spare no effort to assist those in need in the affected areas”.\n\n“I stand in full solidarity with the people of Afghanistan after the devastating earthquake that hit the country earlier today,” he wrote in a post on X. \n\n“I extend my deepest condolences to the families of the victims and wish a speedy recovery to those injured.”\n\nIn a post shared by the Vatican, Pope Leo XIV said he was “deeply saddened by the significant loss of life caused by the earthquake in the area of eastern Afghanistan”.\n\nFrequent quakes\n\nAfghanistan is frequently hit by earthquakes, especially in the Hindu Kush mountain range, near the junction of the Eurasia and India tectonic plates.\n\nSince 1900, there have been 12 earthquakes with magnitudes greater than seven in northeast Afghanistan, according to Brian Baptie, a seismologist at the British Geological Survey.\n\n“This scale of the seismic activity, the potential for multi-hazard events and the construction of structures in the region can combine to create significant loss of life in such events,” he said.\n\nIn October 2023, western Herat province was devastated by a 6.3-magnitude earthquake, which killed more than 1,500 people and damaged or destroyed more than 63,000 homes.\n\nA 5.9-magnitude quake struck the eastern province of Paktika in June 2022, killing more than 1,000 people and leaving tens of thousands homeless.\n\nRavaged by four decades of war, Afghanistan is already contending with a series of humanitarian crises.\n\nSince the return of the Taliban in 2021, foreign aid to Afghanistan has been slashed, undermining the impoverished nation’s already hamstrung ability to respond to disasters.\n\nAround 85 per cent of the Afghan population lives on less than one dollar a day, according to the UN Development Programme.","summary":"Homes have been reduced to rubble and over 800 people have died in horrific scenes.","url":"https://www.news.com.au/technology/environment/children-and-women-were-screaming-over-800-killed-villages-flattened-as-60-magnitude-earthquake-hits-afghanistan/news-story/40f986005d35083334fc11dd590bc74e?from=rss-basic","image":"https://content.api.news/v3/images/bin/86e7013ae1f38066e6f9556776932033","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-09-02 01:11:15","author":"Brielle Burns","authors":["Brielle Burns"],"language":"en","source_country":"au","sentiment":-0.382},{"id":356520460,"title":"Was ‘Chrisley Knows Best’ Scripted?","text":"Todd Chrisley and his family are back on TV in the new Lifetime docuseries, The Chrisleys: Back to Reality.\n\nThe first episode, which aired tonight, reintroduced the family to the world for the first time since Todd and Julie Chrisley were found guilty of fraud and tax evasion and sentenced to a combined 19 years in prison. \n\nThey first found fame as an eccentric Southern family in USA Network’s Chrisley Knows Best, which aired for 10 seasons before Todd and Julie reported to their respective prison sentences in January 2023. The new docuseries outlines their family background, taking viewers from their childhood, to their reality TV stardom, to their lives months before Todd and Julie were ultimately pardoned by President Donald Trump.\n\nOf course, this is a family known for having no filter—and the youngest of the clan, Chloe Chrisley, is no different as she spilled some major tea about their defunct reality show. Keep reading to find out what she said.\n\nWas Chrisley Knows Best Scripted?\n\nAccording to Chloe Chrisley, Chrisley Knows Best was scripted. \n\nIn a surprising on-camera moment between Savannah Chrisley and Chloe in The Chrisleys: Back to Reality, the 12-year-old complains to her older sister about having “cameras in [her] face all the time” and their “not normal” lives. When Savannah reminds Chloe that she’s been in front of cameras her whole life, Chloe responds, “Yeah, when it was scripted.” Savannah nervously looks around the room before replying, “Well, now it is not.”\n\nThis isn’t the first time we’ve heard that Chrisley Knows Best was scripted. In 2017, a source told RadarOnline that Todd had been using a “team of comedy writers” to write his dialogue for several seasons. The source claimed that “more than half of the dialogue on the show is scripted and a large majority of the scenes are reshot when they are not as funny as he wants them to be.” \n\nDuring Todd and Chrisley’s 2022 trial, their attorney Bruce Morris revealed that while some of the show is real, “some of it is not,” per Business Insider. Their wealth, for example, was often exaggerated. According to the lawyer, Todd’s claim in one episode that the family spends $300,000 in clothes a year was a lie.\n\n“He was in bankruptcy at the time,” Morris said. “It’s all part of the sizzle. It’s all part of the show. It’s all part of the act.”\n\nWho Is Chloe Chrisley? Chrisley Family Explained:\n\nThere are a lot of people in the Chrisley family, so it can be confusing if you’re just coming into it. Todd Chrisley has two children from his first marriage: Lindsie Chrisley, 35, and Kyle Chrisley, 33. When he married Julie Chrisley, she adopted his two children as her own. Together, they had Chase Chrisley, 29, Savannah Chrisley, 28, and Grayson Chrisley, 19. \n\nChloe Chrisley, 12, is the daughter of Todd’s eldest son, Kyle, who was “not in a position to be a dad” at the time she was born.\n\n“Her mother let us have her every other weekend. And then every other weekend turned into every other week. And then, I’ll never forget her calling my parents one day, saying, ‘I need you to come get Chloe. We don’t have anywhere to stay and I can’t have her sleep in the car,'” Savannah said in the docuseries. “Then she signed over custody completely.”\n\nAccording to Savannah, Todd could never bring himself to fully terminate Kyle’s rights as a parent. Therefore, the adoption wasn’t made official until a month or two before Todd and Julie went to prison. It was done so neither Kyle or Chloe’s biological mother could come back and take her away while they were incarcerated.\n\nHow To Watch The Chrisleys: Back to Reality:\n\nThe Chrisleys: Back to Reality will release two-hour specials on Monday, Sept. 2 and Tuesday, Sept. 3 at 8/7c on Lifetime. Back-to-back episodes will begin airing every Tuesday starting on Sept. 9, with the finale airing on Tuesday, Sept. 16. With a valid cable login, you can watch the docuseries on Lifetime and/or Lifetime.com.\n\nHow To Watch The Chrisleys: Back to Reality Online Without Cable:\n\nCut the cord? No worries!

A 19-year-old woman who allegedly hit Giuliani’s vehicle suffered non-life threatening injuries. No charges have been filed, State Police said.\n\nPreviously, Giuliani’s head of security Michael Ragusa wrote on X that the former mayor had been “flagged down by a woman who was the victim of a domestic violence incident” and contacted police on her behalf.\n\nState Police confirmed his account in an update Monday, including that the rear-ending incident was unrelated to the domestic violence report.\n\nGiuliani, a passenger, was flagged down by a woman on the side of the road Saturday night, according to an update released by State Police Monday. She told Giuliani and Theodore Goodman, his spokesperson and driver, that she was a victim of a domestic violence incident. \n\nGoodman reported the incident to police just after 9 p.m., officials said, and he and the former mayor remained with the woman until troopers arrived. The pair reported to troopers what they saw and then got back on the interstate.\n\nJust minutes later, Goodman and Giuliani got back on I-93, heading northbound, and were struck almost directly across from the scene of the reported domestic violence incident, officials said. Troopers then went across the highway to provide aid.\n\nThe 19-year-old driver had no connection to the domestic violence incident, investigators believe. \n\n“At this time, all aspects of the crash remain under investigation, including whether distraction or curiosity of the initial scene was a factor,” troopers wrote in a statement.\n\nAvailable footage from troopers’ dashboards or body-worn cameras is being reviewed.\n\nGiuliani, a longtime political ally of President Donald Trump, was disbarred as an attorney in New York and Washington after he was found to have repeatedly made false statements about Trump’s 2020 election loss.

Trump has not lived in the building for years, but it continues to be a rallying point for demonstrations. Similar protests were held outside Trump Tower in Chicago, where chants included “No National Guard” and “Lock him up.” Large gatherings also took place in Washington DC, San Francisco and other West Coast cities. In Washington, protesters carried signs reading “Stop the ICE invasion” and “Free DC No masked thugs.” Along the West Coast, from San Diego to Seattle, rallies focused on immigrant rights, and low wages. In Chicago, where Trump has discussed deploying National Guard troops to address street crime, multiple groups joined together to hear speeches. Evanston mayor Daniel Biss told the crowd, “We’re here because our core values and our democracy are under attack. They are threatening to send the military into our streets.” A brief confrontation broke out when a woman shouted support for Trump and the protesters responded with shouts of their own until the woman left a few minutes later. Union members and worker rights groups also marched in Los Angeles, San Francisco and Portland. The Labour Day demonstrations added to a series of recent protests, including the “May Day” rallies on May 1, the “No Kings” marches in June and last month’s demonstrations against Trump’s plan to redraw congressional districts.","summary":"Across the United States on Labor Day, protesters rallied against president Trump's policies in cities like New York, Chicago, and Washington DC.

As a matter of fact, he has, in a despicable, despicable manner, increased the bombing campaign.”\n\nBessent added: “So I think with President Trump, all options are on the table, and I think we’ll be examining those very closely this week.”\n\nIn the weeks after meeting with President Donald Trump in Anchorage, Alaska, in an attempt to advance a peace deal, Putin has yet to back off from attacking Ukraine.\n\nOn Thursday, Russia pummeled Ukraine with missiles and drones, killing at least 17 people and wounding 48 others in Kyiv. Among the dead were four children between 2 and 17, said Tymur Tkachenko, the head of Kyiv’s city administration.\n\nExperts told Fox News Digital last week that the attack could be a signal Putin is utilizing diplomacy to buy himself more time to advance his goals and continue to attack Ukraine, all while avoiding secondary sanctions that the Trump administration has threatened to impose.\n\nBessent was also asked by Edson about the status of the US-India relationship given the Trump administration’s recent tariffs on India over its purchases of Russian oil, which the White House views as helping to finance Russia’s war in Ukraine, and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi is meeting with his Russian and Chinese counterparts.\n\n“This is a longstanding meeting, it’s called the Shanhai Cooperation Organization and I think it’s largely performative,” Bessent said. “I think at the end of the day, India is the most populous democracy in the world. Their values are much closer to ours and to China’s than to Russia’s.” \n\n“I think at the end of the day, two great countries will get this solved. But the Indians have not been great actors in terms of buying Russian oil and then reselling it, financing the Russian war effort in Ukraine,” he added, while noting the slow progress in US-India trade talks as an additional factor for the White House’s move to raise tariffs.\n\nFox News Digital’s Diana Stancy and FOX Business’ Eric Revell contributed to this report.","summary":"Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent claimed that \"all options are on the table\" as the Trump administration weighs sanctions on Russia after President Vladimir Putin continued to bombard Ukraine.","url":"https://nypost.com/2025/09/01/world-news/bessent-says-trump-administration-willing-to-hit-russian-with-new-sanctions-in-bid-to-end-ukraine-war/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/09/newspress-collage-4yf6kv2zg-1756771026293.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&1756756684&w=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/behaYkDF-RyIcpnTz.mp4","publish_date":"2025-09-02 00:05:47","author":"Fox Business","authors":["Fox Business"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"zm","sentiment":0.058},{"id":356518984,"title":"Graham Greene dead at 73: Oscar-nominated Dances With Wolves star passes away after long illness","text":"Kim Kardashian\n\nVictoria Beckham\n\nHarry Styles\n\nAmanda Holden\n\nBritain's Got Talent\n\nPrivacy Policy\n\nTuesday, Sep 2nd 2025\n\n5-Day Forecast\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMeghan Markle puts her kids front and center in rare snaps as she braves scathing reviews of FLOP Netflix show\n\nLabour's 'one in, one out' migrant deal fiasco: As Cooper attempts asylum 'crackdown', it emerges 3,567 people have landed in dinghies since deal with France was struck - and NONE have been returned\n\nMan, 44, is arrested after 'eight-year-old boy was sexually assaulted in his tent while on holiday with family'\n\nMy partner and I share ONE Mounjaro prescription to cut costs... we take turns to use the jab and have lost 3 stone.

The historical parallels they have drawn are plausible.\nEven some mainstream newspaper op-eds have been borrowing from the analogy. “Britain is the Soviet Union in the 1980s,” one opinion writer declared this week in The Telegraph.\n“Britain’s managerial class increasingly resembles that of the Soviet Union in the early 1980s. They know that change is coming, but they’re doing their utmost to ignore the fact as best they can, for as long as they can,” he wrote.\n“Like the USSR of the early 1980s, political rigidity and borderline terror at the idea of questioning obsolete dogma infect almost every corner of institutional Britain.”\nWhether history will prove such critics right is less important than the fact their warnings at least warrant serious attention. For better or worse, the mere decline of the West – never mind its collapse – is enough to have serious consequences for the world.\nHow the debate started\nIn June last year, influential historian and public intellectual Niall Ferguson published a viral, controversial essay titled “We’re All Soviets Now”. How so?\nHe explains: “A [US] government with a permanent deficit and a bloated military. A bogus ideology pushed by elites. Poor health among ordinary people. A senescent leader. Sound familiar?”\n\nBut Ferguson was not the one who started this Soviet debate, he is merely the most famous and has pushed it onto the agenda of the mainstream media.\nIn late 2023, Abby Innes, a political economist at the London School of Economics and Political Science, published a book with a fascinatingly confusing title, Late Soviet Britain: Why Materialist Utopias Fail.\nHer main thesis is that in Britain, but also in most Western societies, unstable democracy and failing governance have become common because state competence has been eroded, even broken, over the decades by “radical” economic liberalisation or “neoliberalism”, as radical as communist state planning.\nFurther back, in July 2020, lamenting the horrible years of Donald Trump as president who might yet get a second term, Harold James, a leading American economic historian at Princeton University, penned a powerful essay, “Late Soviet America”.\nIt’s well worth reading in full because what he said is even more relevant today, as the problems he identified have worsened and multiplied in the United States.\nWe will follow their arguments in turn.\nOld Soviet jokes\nJokes from the Soviet era are deliciously irresistible. Perhaps that is why each of the three main writers referenced here started their work with one of them. Ferguson actually offered a combined Nazi-Soviet joke, which is perhaps worse.\nBut each joke also serves a serious purpose as, in its own way, each encapsulates its main critiques.\n\nLet’s start with James: “A young man who shouted in Red Square that the decrepit Soviet leader Leonid Brezhnev was an idiot ended up being sentenced to 25 years and six months in prison – six months for insulting the chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet, and 25 years for revealing state secrets.”\nQuoting from the then new memoirs of Trump’s former national security adviser turned nemesis John Bolton, James wrote: “The book is considered dangerous not so much because it insults Donald Trump as because it reveals that the president is deeply incompetent and ‘stunningly uninformed’.”\nPerhaps idiocy is endemic in politics, whether democratic or communist.\n“Many aspects of America’s current annus horribilis recall the final years of the Soviet Union, starting with the intensification of social and political conflict,” James continued.\n“In the Soviet case, long-suppressed ethnic rivalries and competing national aspirations quickly bubbled to the surface, pushing the entire country towards violence, secession and disintegration,” he wrote.\n“In the US, Trump’s response to nationwide protests against racism, police brutality and inequality has been to stoke further the country’s historic racial divide.”\nThat was 2020. It’s much worse today. James’ prognosis is not good.\n“Like the Soviet Union in its final years, the United States is reeling from catastrophic failures of leadership and long-suppressed socioeconomic tensions that have finally boiled over,” he wrote.\n“For the rest of the world, the most important development is that the hegemony of the US dollar may finally be coming to an end.”\n\nUtopian nightmares\nCan the US system possibly resemble the Soviets? Well, there is that old joke, or rather a quip: “Capitalism is the exploitation of man by man. Communism is its opposite.”\nThat is exactly Innes’ point. Central planning and the free market may be polar opposites, but they mirror each other.\nBoth rest on rigid utopian ideologies that claim to be rigorous science, with highly abstract models built on unrealistic assumptions that are nevertheless forced upon real-life economic and social activities and the workings of key institutions.\n“Why has the United Kingdom, historically one of the strongest democracies in the world, become so unstable? What changed?” Innes asks.\n“A major part of the answer lies in the transformation of its state … Britain championed radical economic liberalisation only to weaken and ultimately break its own governing institutions. The crisis of democracy in rich countries has brought forward many urgent analyses of neoliberal capitalism,” she writes.\n“The ‘governing science’ in Leninist and neoliberal revolutions fails for many of the same reasons. These systems may have been utterly opposed in their political values, but when we grasp the kinship in their closed-system forms of economic reasoning and their strategies for government, we may better understand the causes of state failure.”\nQuite simply, if the very people who run the government are themselves convinced that government is the problem and the market always or most of the time offers better solutions, what do you think happens to state competence, democratic stability and regulatory governance after several decades?\n\nAre we the Soviets?\nNow to Ferguson’s joke. He was referring to a now-classic sketch by British comedians David Mitchell and Robert Webb, playing Waffen-SS officers. As they faced certain defeat, it dawned on one of them to ask, “Are we the baddies?”\n“I imagine two American sailors asking themselves one day – perhaps as their aircraft carrier is sinking beneath their feet somewhere near the Taiwan Strait: are we the Soviets?” Ferguson wrote.\nHe drew much flak for making the comparison. Weren’t the Chinese communists supposed to be the late Soviets? Yes, they were and are, according to Ferguson, who has made the claim about the Chinese both before and after his viral essay from last year.\nPerhaps everyone is the late Soviets now, on Ferguson’s telling. But many Chinese would have been familiar with that comparison, so I am writing about the other, perhaps less familiar Soviet comparison with contemporary Britain and the US.\nAccording to the Ferguson law of history, which he claims is at least true from the time of the Dutch Republic’s colonial empire, an empire’s days are numbered when its debt service exceeds its defence spending. The US has just crossed the threshold.\n“The federal government will almost certainly spend more on debt service than on defence this year [2024],” Ferguson wrote.\n“The share of gross domestic product going on interest payments on the federal debt will be double what we spend on national security by 2041, thanks partly to the fact that the rising cost of the debt will squeeze defence spending down from 3 per cent of GDP this year to a projected 2.3 per cent in 30 years’ time.”\nThe empire may not immediately collapse, but it will not last.\n\nIn his classic Postwar: A History of Europe since 1945, the late Tony Judt observed the gerontocratic leadership of the Soviet Union in its death spiral.\nBrezhnev died on November 10, 1982, at the age of 75. His successor, Yuri Andropov, gave up the ghost in just over a year. Konstantin Chernenko, the next to last Soviet leader before Mikhail Gorbachev, lasted 13 months.\n“They had inherited and overseen an authoritarian, gerontocratic bureaucracy, whose overwhelming priority was its own survival: in the world that Brezhnev, Andropov and Chernenko had grown up in, merely dying in your bed was no insignificant accomplishment,” Judt observed.\nFerguson made a similar observation about Trump and Biden in his June 2024 essay. “It is a reflection of the quality of healthcare enjoyed by their American counterparts today that they are both older and healthier [than those late Soviet leaders],” he wrote.\n“Nevertheless, Joe Biden (81) and Donald Trump (78) are hardly men in the first flush of youth and vitality … The former cannot distinguish between his two Hispanic cabinet secretaries, Alejandro Mayorkas and Xavier Becerra. The latter muddles up Nikki Haley and Nancy Pelosi.”\nPelosi herself is a case in point, quitting her job as House speaker in 2023, at the age of 82. Equally indicative are her ever-ageing congressional colleagues – in contrast to the worsening health of the average American, who, against the trend of all advanced economies, is dying younger.\nAs The New York Times reports: “When the current Congress was convened in January, there were nearly 120 members who were 70 or older – 86 in the House, including non-voting delegates, and 33 in the Senate.\n“This number, which is unmatched in modern history, included 14 octogenarians in the House, five in the Senate, and 91-year-old Senator Charles E. Grassley, Republican of Iowa” (my italics).\nDo Americans seriously expect these elderly lawmakers to read bills that run to thousands of pages, or at least their summaries that are still dozens of pages long?\n\nWhat about the American people whom they supposedly serve? Well, they don’t get the same quality medical care.\n“The recent data on American mortality are shocking. Life expectancy has declined in the past decade in a way we do not see in comparable developed countries,” Ferguson wrote.\n“The main explanations, according to the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine, are a striking increase in deaths due to drug overdoses, alcohol abuse, suicide and a rise in various diseases associated with obesity.”\nNow that sounds more like post-Soviet Russia.\nFerguson pointed to many more contemporary American ills, but we are all familiar with them. Somehow, like any discussion of the decline of the US empire, China has to be dragged into it. Ferguson is no exception.\n“The question that haunts me is: what if China has learned the lessons of [the] Cold War better than we have?” he wrote.\n“I fear that Xi Jinping has not only understood that, at all costs, he must avoid the fate of his Soviet counterparts. He has also, more profoundly, understood that we can be manoeuvred into being the Soviets ourselves.”\nWell, Ferguson has amply proved that Americans are more than capable of doing it to themselves without Chinese prompting.","summary":"Long after the Tiananmen Square incident in 1989, Westerners and, secretly, even some within China, were thinking that if the communist country was going to follow the decline and fall of the Soviet Union, the crackdown would have been the trigger.\nBut history is full of surprises.\nNowadays, some prominent intellectuals in the Anglo-American world are fretting over whether their own countries are looking a lot like the late Soviets.

Each charge could lead to sentences of multiple years.\n\nThe allegations date back to before his supporters stormed government buildings on 8 January 2023.\n\nFollowing an extensive investigation, police alleged that he and other officials had been planning acts to abolish the democratic rule of law and keep him in power as early as 2019.\n\nPolice say he had \"full knowledge\" of a plan to assassinate Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva - who at the time was the president-elect - along with Lula's running mate and Supreme Court Justice Alexandre de Moraes.\n\nThe investigators cited a dialogue captured between the alleged conspirators and meetings at the presidential residence that they say support the charges.\n\nJair Bolsonaro is also accused of calling a meeting with top commanders of the armed forces in December 2022, in which he allegedly presented them with a proposed coup plan and asked them to join.\n\nThe army and air force commanders refused, but Navy Commander Almir Garnier Santos – a co-defendant in the trial – expressed support, according to police. The commander has denied the allegations.\n\nBolsonaro and his allies, including his former defence minister Walter Braga Netto, are also accused of encouraging Bolsonaro's allies to attack the armed forces commanders on social media for not joining in the coup plan. Braga Netto has denied any wrongdoing. \n\nBolsonaro is already banned from running for re-election in Brazil's next elections in 2026 after using social media and state television to cast doubt on Brazil's electoral system and electronic voting machines without evidence.\n\nAfter Bolsonaro very narrowly lost the 2022 election to Lula, his supporters staged protests and roadblocks across the country.\n\nIn the months before the election, he had sowed doubt without evidence on the electoral process, and after the results he did not concede defeat.\n\nOn January 8th 2023, a week after Lula's inauguration, crowds of his supporters wearing yellow Brazil football shirts marched through Brasília. They broke into and vandalised Congress, the Supreme Court and the Presidential Palace. It included vandalising statues, smashing glass and setting the chief justice's chair on fire. It led to clashes with police.\n\nBolsonaro distanced himself from the riots at the time and criticised the methods on social media, but continued to claim the election had been stolen.\n\nHe is currently under house arrest, banned from travelling and wears an ankle tag – after authorities expressed concern he may try to flee the country or seek political asylum in an embassy.\n\nJustice Cristiano Zanin, a former lawyer for Lula who is now chairman of the Supreme Court panel tasked with the Bolsonaro trial, will open proceedings at 09:00 local time (12:00 GMT).\n\nHe will call on Justice Alexandre de Moraes – whom Mr Bolsonaro sees as his main opponent – to read out a report outlining the case.\n\nThe prosecutor general, Paulo Gonet, is expected to then read the charges against Bolsonaro and his co-defendants.\n\nOne of the eight men on trial, Bolsonaro's former aide Mauro Cid, has signed a plea deal in exchange for providing evidence and his lawyer will be the first to speak.\n\nThe remaining defendants' lawyers will then take their turns to speak on behalf of their respective clients, all of whom have denied the charges against them.\n\nThe justices will then cast their votes one by one. A majority of three out of the five votes is needed to find a defendant guilty.\n\nEach judge can recommend a sentence for those found guilty.\n\nBolsonaro and his co-defendants can appeal to the full Supreme Court if found guilty.","url":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4gzgq9n8xjo","image":"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/9ef4/live/55341b50-875a-11f0-ac15-0be71ebd833b.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-09-01 23:44:48","author":"Ione Wells","authors":["Ione Wells"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.126},{"id":356512354,"title":"Five Times Brit Hume Said Something Insightful You Didn’t Hear Anywhere Else","text":"Brit Hume has long been known for cutting through the noise with sharp observations that others often miss.\n\nHume built a reputation as one of Fox News’ most seasoned political analysts, known for cutting through headline-driven coverage with detailed observations. Over the years, his commentary has highlighted overlooked facts, challenged shaky narratives, and offered context that often gets lost in the rush of breaking news. Here are five times Hume offered insights that cut against the grain.\n\n1. Hume On How Putin Miscalculated And Strengthened His Enemies\n\nHume did not sugarcoat his view of Russian President Vladimir Putin’s invasion of Ukraine, calling it a historic blunder that left Russia weaker than before. He explained that instead of dividing the West, Putin inadvertently unified America and Europe, while expanding NATO’s reach.\n\n“I think most of what we saw today, Bret, with all the difficulty that may lie ahead, was testament to the utter failure of Vladimir Putin,” Hume told Bret Baier.\n\nHume pointed out that Putin’s quick-strike plan collapsed under the weight of poor strategy and heavy losses. More than two years into the war, Hume noted that Russia failed to secure even full control of eastern Ukraine despite enormous costs.\n\n“The man is a fool. He may be evil and cunning in some ways, but he made a very foolish mistake here, and, in the end, I think he will pay for it. But it may take a while. There may be considerable suffering yet,” Hume said. (RELATED: Trump Reveals What Advice He’ll Give Zelenskyy)\n\n2. Hume Warned Against Iran Strike Reports\n\nPresident Donald Trump announced in June that U.S. forces carried out a “very successful attack” on Iran’s nuclear sites at Natanz, Esfahan, and Fordow, the latter of which he said was hit with a “full payload of BOMBS.” CNN then claimed U.S. strikes on Iran’s nuclear sites only caused minor damage. Hume warned against taking the report at face value and reminded viewers that early assessments are often based on limited information and cannot provide reliable conclusions.\n\n“You know there’s only so much you can know about underground damage from massive bombing in the 48 or 72 hours after it happened. Because in order to really know you’d have to be in there,” Hume told Baier.\n\nBy calling attention to sloppy reporting, Hume highlighted the dangers of rushing to judgment in matters of national security. (RELATED: Just About Everyone Dumps Cold Water On CNN Report Alleging Minor Damage To Iran Nuke Sites)\n\n“I think that the subsequent intelligence reports we’ve heard about are more reliable. But you know this all has to await a longer-term situation, which somebody’s gonna have to get in there and really find out. But the Iranians themselves were saying today that their nuclear program was badly damaged, so maybe we ought to rest with that,” Hume said.\n\n3. Hume Explains Who Really Pays Taxes\n\nWhen lawmakers approved Trump’s tax plan, Hume focused on a fact often left out of the conversation: a significant portion of Americans don’t pay federal income taxes. He noted that while they pay Social Security and local taxes, the federal tax burden falls largely on those who do file income taxes.\n\n“This is an income tax cut, and income tax cuts benefit the people who pay income taxes. About 40% of the households in the United States today do not pay any federal income tax,” Hume said.\n\nHume argued that this makes it difficult to design tax cuts that benefit everyone equally. In his view, critics of Republican tax plans ignore the structural reality that non-taxpayers cannot see relief from cuts they don’t pay into. (RELATED: ‘No Great Big Grand Final Bargain’: Brit Hume Says Deal With China Still ‘Has A Long Way To Go’)\n\n“Now they pay other taxes, Social Security taxes, local taxes, property taxes and so on, but they don’t pay any federal income tax. It’s very hard to design a tax cut that benefits people who don’t pay taxes,” Hume said. “The president has tried with the no taxes on tips and no taxes on overtime and so on, but it is simply a fact of life that tax cuts benefit taxpayers.”\n\n4. Hume Pushes Back on Biden Autopen Story\n\nNBC News downplayed House Oversight Chairman James Comer’s concerns over former President Joe Biden’s use of the autopen, but Hume called the report misleading. He drew a distinction between signing letters and using the device for serious government actions such as pardons.\n\n“It’s perfectly clear, or should be, that nobody is talking about Mr. Biden’s use of the autopen for letters and other routine things. The concern, to the extent there is a concern, is about using the autopen for very serious official documents, such as pardons and the like,” Hume said.\n\nHume accused NBC of either missing the point or deliberately protecting Biden. He stressed that the story was not about routine use but about potential abuse of power when applied to high-level legal authority. (RELATED: ‘Scandal Of The Century’: Josh Hawley Demands Biden Staff Secretary Testify To Congress On Autopen)\n\n“As young journalists come along and they hear the story about an autopen being used by Mr. Biden, and, therefore, you know, anybody using the autopen becomes kind of an equivalent in their mind and imagination. And the next thing you know, you’ve got stories written about it,” Hume explained.\n\n5. Hume Sees Stability Beneath Economic Jitters\n\nWhen the U.S. economy shrank by 0.3% in early 2025, Hume warned against overreaction. He pointed to the rebound in markets by the end of the day as a sign investors saw deeper strength.\n\n“By the end of the day, it was back up because I think investors began to see the things that you pointed out there, [as] Bret and others were saying, that this is something that may not be repeated in the economy,” Hume said. “It may be on sounder footing than the original number made it appear.”\n\nHe explained that one quarter of contraction does not prove long-term weakness. Instead, Hume said factors like pre-tariff imports and consumer pullbacks made the dip look worse than it was. (RELATED: ‘The Real Villain’: Steve Moore Identifies Who Made The Market Tank Friday And Why)\n\n“The president was saying this is Biden’s stock market. Of course, back in January when the market was surging he was saying it was the Trump market,” Hume told Baier. “But the truth is that this is not nearly as bad as it sounded at first.”\n\nWhether he is pointing out Putin’s self-inflicted wounds, reminding viewers not to trust premature intelligence reports, or challenging the media’s blind spots on Biden and the economy, Hume grounds his commentary in facts others ignore.\n\nAll content created by the Daily Caller News Foundation, an independent and nonpartisan newswire service, is available without charge to any legitimate news publisher that can provide a large audience.

More dead children, dead because they were shot by what we now know is the classic American mass shooter — our uniquely native-born young person whose craziness, whose need to destroy, won’t be contained because Republican legislators make sure he has access to assault weapons.\n\nGoing to school has become one of the riskiest things a child can do. Why? Unbelievably, someone in America is today planning an assault on a school district that we won’t identify until more children are dead. Isn’t that the most insane statement you’ve ever read?\n\nThe shooting is at least the fifth at K-12 schools in the U.S. since the school year began on Aug. 1, according to the anti-gun violence advocacy organization Everytown for Gun Safety.

We need a national ban on it, but until after the 2028 election, we must make this desperate effort to stop Donald Trump from stealing our chance to put an end to his fascist takeover.\n\nThe five congressional seats he has had engineered to win with gerrymandering in Texas, combined with the aggressive voter suppression the Republicans are pursuing, could tip the election in his favor. Passing Proposition 50 in November simply gives California the chance to neutralize the Texas steal and is crucial to the survival of democracy in this country.\n\nPlease vote yes on Proposition 50.\n\nJacqueline Black\nCastro Valley\n\nDon’t be fooled by\nanti-Prop. 50 flyers\n\nA mailer from the “Protect Voters First” coalition announces that mid-cycle redistricting in California would be “weakening our democratic process.”\n\nIt does not say that the recent Texas gerrymander, intended to ensure a Republican majority in the House of Representatives, triggered the California redistricting effort and weakens democracy. The mailer uses a quote from California League of Women Voters President Gloria Chun Hoo, implying that her organization endorses the coalition effort; it does not.\n\nAnd the coalition’s top funder is social conservative and anti-abortion activist Charles T. Munger Jr. Buyer beware.\n\nKaren Lee Cohen\nWalnut Creek\n\nTo make US healthy,\nget rid of RFK Jr.\n\nIt is possible to impeach a cabinet secretary. Let’s start with Robert F. Kennedy Jr.\n\nHe is clearly demonstrating that he lied during his confirmation hearings. The actions he has taken as secretary show that. A long-time vaccine skeptic with no medical background, he claimed he would follow the science, but his actions indicate otherwise. He replaced all members of the vaccine advisory committee with vaccine skeptics, he canceled funding for MRNA projects, and now he is firing the director of the CDC who says he is “weaponizing public health.”\n\nLet’s start making America healthy again by putting someone in charge who knows something about public health. Let’s get rid of him.\n\nDarcy Johnson\n\nTrump crying fraud\ndoesn’t hold water\n\nRe: “Trump fires Fed governor, opening new front in fight for central bank” (Page A4, Aug. 26).\n\nIsn’t it ironic?\n\nI read some of the excerpts from President Trump’s termination letter to Lisa Cook, the Federal Reserve Board Governor, whom he is firing for being accused of committing lender fraud on her mortgage applications.\n\nIn a holier-than-thou stance, the president explains that he must protect the American people from the questionable integrity of high-level officials.\n\nWhat? The president himself has already been convicted of business fraud. He is not eligible to take that stance.\n\nJames Morphy\n\n‘Donor states’ must\nhave federal relief\n\nPrior to the Trump administration, California contributed nearly $88 billion more to the federal government in taxes than it received in federal contributions. Nineteen other states also have this “donor state” distinction.\n\nCuts in education, research, wind and solar development, consumer protection, Medicaid, arts endowment, public broadcasting, Planned Parenthood, Head Start and disaster relief, to name a few, will expand the gap between giving and receiving.\n\nThe president, while telling us how well he is taking care of the federal government through tariffs, payoffs from tariff negotiations and lawsuits against his enemies, collecting “tens of billions per month,” expects states to be self-sufficient.\n\nThe lawsuits to get our federal funding reinstated can take years to resolve. Federal legislation is needed that closes the gap. There are both blue and red states that are considered donor states. A bipartisan bill could help donor states reclaim what they are due.\n\nFrank Jones","summary":"Also: Redistricting necessary &#124; Don't be fooled &#124; Impeach secretary &#124; Crying fraud &#124; 'Donor states.'

The event could potentially demonstrate their three-way unity against the United States.\n\nKim and Russian President Vladimir Putin are among the 26 world leaders who’ll join Chinese President Xi Jinping to watch Wednesday’s massive military parade in Beijing that commemorates the 80th anniversary of the end of World War II and China’s fight against Japan’s wartime aggressions.\n\nWhile the event would mark Kim’s first attendance of a major multilateral event during his 14-year rule, it would also be the first time for Kim, Xi and Putin, all key challengers of the U.S., to gather at the same venue. None of the leaders have confirmed a private trilateral meeting.\n\nThe North’s official Korean Central News Agency reported early Tuesday that Kim left Pyongyang for Beijing by his special train on Monday to participate in the celebrations. KCNA, citing Foreign Ministry official Kim Chon Il, said that Kim Jong Un was traveling with top officials including Foreign Minister Choe Son Hui. \n\nSouth Korean media reported Kim’s train was expected to arrive in Beijing on Tuesday after confirming its arrival in the Chinese border city of Dandong on Monday night.\n\nKim’s travel marks his first visit to China since 2019 and the fifth visit in total since he inherited power upon his father’s death in late 2011. \n\nPutin arrived in China on Sunday to attend the Shanghai Cooperation Organization, a regional summit, as well as the Beijing parade. Kremlin Aide Yuri Ushakov told Russia’s TASS news agency on Sunday that a meeting with Kim on the sidelines was “under consideration.”\n\nNorth Korea observers are paying keen attention to Kim possibly meeting Xi bilaterally as well and holding even a trilateral meeting with Xi and Putin. The three leaders have met bilaterally previously but have yet to hold a trilateral meeting. \n\nNorth Korea’s foreign policy priority has been Russia in recent years as it has been supplying troops and ammunition to support Russia’s war against Ukraine in exchange for economic and military assistance. North Korea’s relations with China have reportedly turned sour in recent years, but experts say Kim likely hopes to restore ties as China is North Korea’s biggest trading partner and aid benefactor and he would want to brace for the end of the Russia-Ukraine war. \n\nSince aligning with Russia, North Korea has become more vocal in international affairs beyond the Korean Peninsula, issuing diplomatic statements on conflicts in the Middle East and in the Taiwan Strait, while portraying itself as a part of a united front against Washington. Some experts say Kim’s presence at the multilateral event in Beijing is part of efforts to develop partnerships with other nations close to China and Russia.\n\nKim’s trip comes as President Donald Trump and new liberal South Korean President Lee Jae Myung have repeatedly expressed their hopes to restart talks with North Korea. North Korea has been shunning talks with the U.S. and South Korea and pushing to expand its nuclear and missile arsenals since Kim’s earlier round of diplomacy with Trump collapsed in 2019. \n\nBefore departing for China on Monday, Kim visited a North Korean missile research institute to review progress on developing a new rocket engine made with carbon-fiber composite materials, which the North plans to use in its intercontinental ballistic missiles, KCNA reported. The North in recent years has unveiled various versions of ICBMs that demonstrated potential range to reach the U.S. mainland during test flights.\n\nAssociated Press writer Kim Tong-hyung contributed to this report.","summary":"North Korea's Kim Jong Un travels to Beijing to watch military parade alongside Putin and Xi Jinping  AP News","url":"https://apnews.com/article/north-korea-kim-china-xi-putin-parade-9b47625f8f6c1e0c0391de9fae848e11","image":"https://dims.apnews.com/dims4/default/8c8a3d8/2147483647/strip/false/crop/3450x2300+0+0/resize/1486x991!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fassets.apnews.com%2Fd4%2F4f%2Fceed968250d758ba013e1eb4f768%2Fbfa5d5b0834b4bb180a0b11e29a22839","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-09-01 23:27:00","author":"Hyung-Jin Kim","authors":["Hyung-Jin Kim"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.267},{"id":356518990,"title":"Anne Hathaway has another on set incident while filming Devil Wears Prada 2... days after epic tumble","text":"Kim Kardashian\n\nVictoria Beckham\n\nHarry Styles\n\nAmanda Holden\n\nBritain's Got Talent\n\nPrivacy Policy\n\nTuesday, Sep 2nd 2025\n\n5-Day Forecast\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMeghan Markle puts her kids front and center in rare snaps as she braves scathing reviews of FLOP Netflix show\n\nLabour's 'one in, one out' migrant deal fiasco: As Cooper attempts asylum 'crackdown', it emerges 3,567 people have landed in dinghies since deal with France was struck - and NONE have been returned\n\nMan, 44, is arrested after 'eight-year-old boy was sexually assaulted in his tent while on holiday with family'\n\nMy partner and I share ONE Mounjaro prescription to cut costs... we take turns to use the jab and have lost 3 stone.

He kept it because it was a charming moment,' she explained.\nMeanwhile, Hathaway isn’t the only familiar face returning to the Devil Wears Prada universe. \nMeryl Streep, Stanley Tucci, and Emily Blunt have all been spotted filming scenes in New York, bringing back the magic fans loved in the first film.\n\nView this post on Instagram\n\nA post shared by Anne Hathaway (@annehathaway) \n\nAt first, fans weren’t sure if it was a scripted stunt or a genuine slip, but Hathaway made it clear it was the latter when she shared the moment on Instagram the next day — pairing it with a throwback clip of another famous mishap\n\nThe video showed her falling in the 2001 hit The Princess Diaries , where she toppled down the high school bleachers\n\nThat fall wasn’t scripted either, but director Garry Marshall loved it so much he kept it in the movie\n\nWith the caption, 'Twenty years later, still falling for you,' Hathaway proved she can take a spill and laugh about it with the best of them\nNew additions to the cast are also turning heads. \nKenneth Branagh plays Miranda’s new husband, while Australian heartthrob Patrick Brammall has been cast as Andy’s latest romantic interest. \nHathaway and Brammall were spotted filming a few sweet moments last week as they strolled through the crowded streets of Brooklyn as the sun set in the distance.\nAt one point, the actor placed his arms around the beauty as they fell into an embrace while standing outside of a restaurant.\nHathaway also flashed a big smile on her face as Brammall twirled her around in circles.\nIn the 2006 movie, Adrian Grenier had played her character's boyfriend Nate - but the actor is notably not returning to the second movie. \n\nThe superstar also reflected on her Princess Diaries stumble during a 2020 tribute to the late director Marshall, who passed away in 2016 at the age of 81; (on set of The Princess Diaries 2 in 2004)\nGrenier's character has since divided fans, with some labeling him as an unsupportive boyfriend over her journalism career.\nThe Entourage actor previously discussed his role in the first movie while talking to Entertainment Weekly in 2021.\n'I didn't see some of the subtleties and the nuance of this character and what it represented in the film until the wisdom of the masses came online and started to push against the character and throw him under the bus, and I got flak.\n'All those memes that came out were shocking to me,' he added, referencing to how fans had called Nate 'the villain' of the film.\n'It hadn't occurred to me until I started to really think about it, and perhaps it was because I was as immature as Nate was at the time. And in many ways he's very selfish and self-involved.'\nAdrian continued, 'It was all about him; he wasn't extending himself to support Andy in her career.'\nTimothée Chalamet’s sister Pauline and The Office star BJ Novak have also been seen on set, alongside YouTube personality Amelia Dimoldenberg, known for Chicken Shop Date.\nDavid Frankel - who directed the first 2006 movie - is returning as director on the sequel as well. \nThe Devil Wears Prada was a critical success and raked in $326.7 million in the box office on a budget of around $35-$41 million.\nIt also garnered two Oscar nominations, such as Best Actress for Meryl Streep. Other nods included five BAFTAs and three Golden Globes - with Meryl winning for Best Actress in a Motion Picture Musical or Comedy.\nAlthough Lauren Weisberger penned a follow-up novel, Revenge Wears Prada, the upcoming movie reportedly takes a different direction from the book.\nThe film finds Miranda navigating the shifting world of Runway as print magazines give way to the digital age.\nAnne Hathaway\n\nShare or comment on this article: \nAnne Hathaway has another on set incident while filming Devil Wears Prada 2... days after epic tumble\n\nAdd comment\n\nComments 21\n\n Share what you think\n\nWorst rated\n\nThe comments below have not been moderated.\n\nThe views expressed in the contents above are those of our users and do not necessarily reflect the views of MailOnline.\n\nAdd your comment\n\nEnter your comment\n\nBy posting your comment you agree to our house rules.\n\nSubmit Comment\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual.\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual\n\nWe will automatically post your comment and a link to the news story to your Facebook timeline at the same time it is posted on MailOnline.

Modi and Putin were photographed holding hands and held talks in the afternoon.\n\nRussian state media reported the pair spent nearly an hour talking “face-to-face” in Putin’s armoured presidential car before an official meeting.\n\n“Conversations with him are always insightful,” Modi posted on X alongside a photograph of them travelling in the car.\n\nBefore their meeting, Modi praised the “special and privileged strategic partnership” with Moscow and added that India wanted both sides in the Ukraine conflict to “find stable peace”.\n\n‘Mutual trust’ \n\nThe SCO summit kicked off on Sunday, days before a massive military parade in Beijing to mark 80 years since the end of World War II.\n\nThe member states signed a declaration Monday agreeing to strengthen cooperation in sectors such as security and economy, China’s Xinhua news agency said. \n\nXinhua added that the leaders also admitted Laos as an observer country, or “dialogue partner” – the summit already has 16 observers.\n\nXi held a flurry of back-to-back meetings with leaders including Lukashenko – one of Putin’s staunch allies – and Modi, who is on his first visit to China since 2018.\n\nModi told Xi that India was committed to taking “forward our ties on the basis of mutual trust, dignity and sensitivity”. \n\nThe world’s two most populous nations are intense rivals, competing for influence across South Asia, and fought a deadly border clash in 2020. \n\nA thaw began last October, when Modi met Xi for the first time in five years at a summit in Russia.\n\nTheir rapprochement deepened as US President Donald Trump pressured both Asian economic giants with trade tariffs.\n\nMore than 20 leaders are attending the bloc’s largest meeting since it was founded in 2001.\n\nMany of the assembled dignitaries will be in Beijing on Wednesday to watch the military parade, which will also be attended by North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.\n\nKim left Pyongyang by train on Monday afternoon and is expected to arrive Tuesday, South Korea’s Yonhap news agency reported.","summary":"“This crisis wasn’t triggered by Russia’s attack on Ukraine, but was a result of a coup in Ukraine, which was

government data is outlining how President Donald Trump's U.S. immigration crackdown is impacting the job market.\n\nThe number of U.S.-based migrant workers, data released August 21 by the Washington-based think tank Pew says, declined by 1.2 million from January through July, according to Pew-analyzed data out of the U.S Census Bureau in figures including non-legal and legal residents.\n\n\"It's unclear how much of the decline we've seen since January is due to voluntary departures to pursue other opportunities or avoid deportation, removals, underreporting or other technical issues,\" Stephanie Kramer, a Pew senior researcher, told CBS News.\n\nPew said from 2021 to 2023 there was a 13% bump in migrants via South America.\n\n\"However, we don't believe that the preliminary numbers indicating net-negative migration are so far off that the decline isn't real.\"\n\nIt also pointed specifically to the four specific states of California, Louisiana, Florida and New York, where most of America's more than 51 million immigrants in recent years have lived.\n\nEconomic experts predict that a drop in workforce participation could see ripple effects through the already-strained U.S. labor market.\n\nBut Pew said the caveat to a reversal in immigration means the total number of unauthorized migrants likely decreased \"due in part to increased deportations and reduced protections under the Trump administration.\"\n\nAccording to Pew's research estimates, the overall number of people in the country illegally peaked in 2023 at around 14 million people.\n\nPew officials pointed to specific U.S. policy changes starting mid-last year that they say affected America's immigrant population.\n\nPew said then-President Joe Biden's restrictions on new asylum seekers last June, in addition to Trump's first 100 days back in the White House and flurry of 181 executive orders on immigration, culminated in a \"sharp decline\" in immigration issues.","summary":"The Pew Research Center says the number of U.S.-based migrant workers declined by 1.2 million from January through July, according to U.S Census Bureau

Platner, Troy Jackson at Labor Day rally in Portland","text":"Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders told thousands Monday that the United States faces “dangerous” times that require progressive leadership during an appearance with Maine political leaders at the Cross Insurance Arenaon Monday in Portland.\n\n“This is an unprecedented and in fact dangerous moment in American history, and we have got to respond in an unprecedented way,” Sanders told the crowd. “The way we respond is to build the kind of strong, progressive, grassroots movement the likes of which this country has never seen.”\n\nSanders spoke in support of U.S. Senate hopeful Graham Platner, a Sullivan Democrat challenging Republican U.S. Sen. Susan Collins, and Maine gubernatorial candidate Troy Jackson, an Allagash Democrat, who both appeared at the event.\n\nPlatner, 40, is a former U.S. marine and oyster farmer who announced his run for Collins’ seat last month. Jackson, 65, is a former logger and longtime Maine legislator who received Sanders’ endorsement days after tossing his hat into a crowded race for governor.\n\nThey each decried rising income inequality, the actions of President Donald Trump’s administration and what they said was a rising oligarchy in the U.S., a government where power is controlled by a small group.\n\n“We have to break the status quo. It’s not working for us,” Jackson told the crowd. “The only way to build our future, the future that we want, is to build it for ourselves.”\n\nPlatner decried the Trump Administration’s attacks on immigrants and LGBTQ+ Americans and spoke about the rich “extracting wealth out of working Americans” through what he described as “a system that is functioning exactly as it is intended.”\n\n“We live in a system that has been built by the political class to enrich and support millionaires on the backs of working people,” Platner said. “Democrats are part of the same corporate apparatus that the Republicans are.”\n\nSanders, Platner and Jackson have each branded themselves as “outsiders” at a moment of reckoning for the Democrat Party, which is historically unpopular according to national polling — just 24% of voters view the party favorably, a CNBC poll released last month found.\n\nPlatner has been openly critical of the party since launching his campaign. He has called out Democrats online and in interviews for “doing jack” to oppose the Trump administration, income inequality and other issues. It was a primary theme of his speech on Monday.\n\n“Much of the world that we have today is the specific result of policy choices made by establishment politicians. And the shame in the truth of all of this is that the blame cannot simply be left at the feet of one political party,” Platner told the crowd Monday.\n\nSinger-songwriter Josh Ritter opened the event with an acoustic performance. The rally was another stop in Sanders’ “Fighting Oligarchy” tour, which a spokesperson said has drawn hundreds of thousands of attendees to events across 18 states. Sanders, 83, had arrived from another rally at the New Hampshire State House earlier that day.","summary":"The Vermont independent stumped with progressive candidates for Senate and governor against 'oligarchy,' the MAGA movement and the Democrat party establishment before a crowd of several thousand.","url":"https://www.centralmaine.com/2025/09/01/bernie-sanders-backs-graham-platner-troy-jackson-at-labor-day-rally-in-portland/","image":"https://w2pcms.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2025/09/34260-20250901_Rally_11.jpg?w=1024","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-09-01 23:21:02","author":"Dylan Tusinski","authors":["Dylan Tusinski"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.026},{"id":356518988,"title":"Kevin Costner, 70, heats up 'hush hush' romance with billionaire's ex-wife, 46, with glitzy Colorado trip","text":"Kim Kardashian\n\nVictoria Beckham\n\nHarry Styles\n\nAmanda Holden\n\nBritain's Got Talent\n\nPrivacy Policy\n\nTuesday, Sep 2nd 2025\n\n5-Day Forecast\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMeghan Markle puts her kids front and center in rare snaps as she braves scathing reviews of FLOP Netflix show\n\nLabour's 'one in, one out' migrant deal fiasco: As Cooper attempts asylum 'crackdown', it emerges 3,567 people have landed in dinghies since deal with France was struck - and NONE have been returned\n\nMan, 44, is arrested after 'eight-year-old boy was sexually assaulted in his tent while on holiday with family'\n\nMy partner and I share ONE Mounjaro prescription to cut costs... we take turns to use the jab and have lost 3 stone.

Email tips@dailymail.com \nBy DEIRDRE DURKAN-SIMONDS, US ASSOCIATE SHOWBUSINESS EDITOR and HEIDI PARKER, US DEPUTY SHOWBUSINESS EDITOR and RUSS WEAKLAND, US SENIOR SHOWBIZ REPORTER \n Published:22:50 BST, 1 September 2025 |Updated:00:19 BST, 2 September 2025 \n\nKevin Costner appears to have found love again and friends say the Hollywood legend hasn't looked this happy in years.\nThe Yellowstone star, 70, has quietly been seeing Kelly Noonan Gores, the 46-year-old filmmaker and ex-wife of billionaire Alec Gores, with whispers of their romance first beginning to swirl last week.\nNow, after both made appearances at the JAS Labor Day Experience Festival in Snowmass Village near Aspen over the holiday weekend, albeit separately, speculation about their relationship has only intensified.\n'Kevin is dating and happy again after a very dark time in his life,' a source told the Daily Mail exclusively. 'He has been seeing Kelly. They were together in Aspen in late July. He has tried to keep it very hush hush because he doesn't want this to go off the rails.'\nThe two-time Oscar winner, who endured a difficult and very public divorce from Christine Baumgartner last year, has been leaning into this new chapter with quiet optimism. \nHis budding romance with Noonan Gores, insiders say, is offering him exactly the partner and balance he's been searching for.\n\nKevin Costner appears to have found love again and friends say the Hollywood legend hasn't looked this happy in years - he and Kelly Noonan Gores (R) attended the same Aspen event over the weekend\n'She is exactly his type and they have a lot in common: the outdoors, sports — she likes to surf — long walks with dogs,' the insider added. 'Also she has young kids and he loves kids, so he thinks that's cute. He says she is just \"chill,\" which is what he needs right now.'\nWhile attending the JAS Labor Day Experience, Costner cut a casual figure in a black quarter-zip sweater, dark pants and sunglasses.\n\nEXCLUSIVE Kevin Costner, 70, 'casually dating' billionaire's ex-wife, 46, after bitter divorce \nAs he enjoyed the music festival, the father-of-seven looked relaxed as he mingled with friends.\nNoonan Gores, meanwhile, turned heads in a chic black mini dress paired with a denim jacket and ankle boots. \nHer effortless style fit right in at the glamorous mountain hotspot beloved by celebrities.\nThough the pair weren't photographed together, their overlapping presence did not go unnoticed.\nAlthough they've been keeping their relationship under wraps, Costner's ease was hard to ignore.\nFor Costner, happiness has been hard-won. \n\nNow, after both made appearances at the JAS Labor Day Experience Festival in Snowmass over the holiday weekend, albeit separately, speculation about their relationship has only intensified\n\n'Kevin is dating and happy again after a very dark time in his life,' a source told the Daily Mail. 'He has tried to keep it very hush hush because he doesn't want this to go off the rails'\nA second source told the Daily Mail: 'With Kelly, she has fallen into his charm 110%. He thinks she is very nice, super sexy and likes hanging out with her.' \n'Kevin can get almost any woman he wants, and Kelly is his target right now and they both are enjoying each other's company,' the insider added. 'It is hot and heavy right now, and the sky is the limit. He's looking to hang out with her as much as possible and she is all for it as well.' \nHis messy split from Baumgartner left him bruised and at times withdrawn, but those close to him say that Aspen, long a refuge for the actor, has become a backdrop for new beginnings.\nCostner split from Baumgartner in May 2023 after 18 years of marriage, officially closing the book on their messy split this past February. \nThe courtroom battle was brutal, with Costner ultimately ordered to pay $63,209 per month in child support — far less than the jaw-dropping $248,000 Christine had demanded. \nShe was also forced to vacate his $145 million beachfront estate in Carpinteria only two months after filing.\nSince then, Costner has leaned into single life, turning heads with rumored links to Jewel, Sharon Stone, Jennifer Lopez, and January Jones.\nOn Friday, The Daily Mail confirmed that the actor was dating Gores, an accomplished director and author. \n\nThe two-time Oscar winner, who endured a difficult and very public divorce from Christine Baumgartner last year, has been leaning into this new chapter with quiet optimism\n\nHis budding romance with Noonan Gores, insiders say, is offering him exactly the partner and balance he's been searching for\nAn insider told Daily Mail that Kevin has been 'getting to know Kelley' amid his busy Hollywood work schedule.\n'Kevin has been filming and working to get a few films off the ground and also dealing with the recent lawsuit against him and his Horizon film, so the times he has had for himself have been few and far between, but he has been getting to know Kelley and it seems like they share an interest with each other and look to hang out even more in the future,' Daily Mail's source explained.\nThe insider claimed that Kevin is being cautious about jumping into a new relationship due to being 'burned' in the past.\nHowever, the A-list hunk is still open to finding 'true love.'\n'Kevin is using kids gloves upon getting into any new relationship because he has been burned, but he also believes in true love and if Kelley were someone to bring that to him, that would be great.'\nThe source explained that Costner and Kelley have 'mutual friends, so if it doesn't work out romantically, they will at least make a good new trusted friend.\n'This is currently in the wait and see period of it all, but they both aren't running away from a potential loving new relationship.'\n\n'She is exactly his type and they have a lot in common: the outdoors, sports — she likes to surf — long walks with dogs,' the insider added; seen in 2025\nThe Daily Mail has reached out to reps for Costner for comment and has yet to hear back.\nUs Weekly also reported that Costner and Kelley aren't rushing into a relationship just yet, especially with geography working against them — Costner lives in Carpinteria while Noonan is based about 100 miles away in Manhattan Beach.\nStill, sparks seem to be flying as the two have reportedly 'spent time' together in Colorado.\n'They both frequent Aspen often and have mutual friend groups,' the source added.\n'They have been getting to know each other and seeing each other casually when they can.'\n\nLittle is publicly known about Gores, who married Gores, 72, in 2016\nLittle is publicly known about Gores, who married Gores, 72, in 2016.\nThe couple announced their divorce in December 2024 and share a 6-year-old daughter, Riley.\nOn Instagram, she describes herself as a director, author, and host, as well as 'Mama, Meditator, Sports Nut.'\nNews of the budding romance follows a January report claiming the Hollywood leading man 'is not seriously involved with anyone and not necessarily looking for anything more than that right now.'\nIt also comes on the heels of Costner publicly shutting down rumors that he was dating Jewel.\nWhile visiting The Howard Stern Show, he told the host: 'Jewel and I are friends. We've never gone out ever.'\n\nOn Instagram, she describes herself as a director, author, and host, as well as 'Mama, Meditator, Sports Nut'\n'She's special, and I don't want — I don't want these rumors to ruin our friendship because that's what we have. She's special to me. She's beautiful enough to go out with,' he added.\nThe star recalled that he and Jewel were among a group that included Emma Watson who attended a charity event in the British Virgin Islands in November 2023.\n'She was somebody I just had some tremendous conversations with, and along with Emma,' he said, noting that they flew together to and from Richard Branson's island.\nCostner was also linked to Stone late last year after a source said 'sparks were flying' between them and that 'they exchanged numbers' at the Governors Awards in November.\nMeanwhile, he was spotted in Aspen enjoying drinks with Lopez at hotspot Kemo Sabe in December.\nThough he mingled with her group, it's unclear how much time they spent together.\nThat same month, Mad Men star January shared on Instagram Stories that she 'finally' had the chance to meet him at a Brunello Cucinelli event.\n\nThe actor split from Christine Baumgartner in May 2023 after 18 years of marriage, officially closing the book on their messy split this past February; (seen in 2014)\nShe wrote: 'Beautiful evening once again with the incredibly warm @brunellocucinelli_brand family. And I finally got to meet @kevincostner.'\nDespite persistent rumors and fans' hopes, no romance blossomed between Costner and the actresses he's been linked to, leaving the actor focused on life after his high-profile split.\nHe remains devoted to co-parenting with Baumgartner, sharing sons Cayden, 18, and Hayes, 16, and daughter Grace, 15.\nHe also has three adult children from his first marriage to Cindy Silva: Annie, 41, Lily, 39, and Joe, 37.\nAs the Daily Mail previously revealed, Baumgartner is now planning a tropical wedding with fiancé Josh Connor, a financier, just 18 months after her split from Costner.\nTheir relationship has been fraught with controversy.\nDuring a heated court hearing in August 2023, Costner accused his ex of cheating with Connor, who was once a close friend and neighbor.\nChristine denied the claims under oath, but by January 2024, their romance had become public knowledge.\nKevin Costner\n\nShare or comment on this article: \nKevin Costner, 70, heats up 'hush hush' romance with billionaire's ex-wife, 46, with glitzy Colorado trip\n\nAdd comment\n\nComments 51\n\n Share what you think\n\nWorst rated\n\nThe comments below have not been moderated.\n\nThe views expressed in the contents above are those of our users and do not necessarily reflect the views of MailOnline.\n\nAdd your comment\n\nEnter your comment\n\nBy posting your comment you agree to our house rules.\n\nSubmit Comment\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual.\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual\n\nWe will automatically post your comment and a link to the news story to your Facebook timeline at the same time it is posted on MailOnline.

Wes Moore and his wife Dawn are seeking refuge in the comforts of the Hollywood actor's famous Lake Como villa.\n\nThe 46-year-old showcased his shirtless physique as he and Dawn soaked up the sun Monday afternoon from the deck of the movie star's yacht.\n\nA White House spokesman told the Daily Mail: 'Baltimore's residents can't escape gunshots and crime while Wes Moore flies to Lake Como to hang out with the Democrat elite. \n\n'Maybe he should stay there, because he surely isn't getting anything done in Annapolis.'\n\nClooney and his wife Amal have already left Italy after making their noticeably quick appearance at the Venice Film Festival, but have opened their home to the Moores.\n\nThe couple are said to have all the luxuries of the more than $100million Villa Oleandra estate and its service staff at their full disposal.\n\nMoore is said to be Clooney's pick for the Democratic presidential nominee in the 2028 election, with the actor once praising him as 'someone we could all join in behind'.\n\nThe governor has escaped to Lake Como after he spent all last week feuding with Trump over his deployment of the National Guard into Washington DC to combat crime.\n\nTrump threatened to send federal law enforcement to Baltimore and branded Maryland's biggest city a 'hell hole' and a 'horrible death bed'.\n\nMoore admits more needs to be done to tackle skyrocketing crime in Baltimore, but has dismissed the idea of sending in the National Guard.\n\n'I would love more federal support, but federal support on things that actually make sense and not things that are performative,' he said during an ABC interview that aired Sunday.\n\n'The National Guard is completely performative because the National Guard is not even trained for it.'\n\nThe Maryland governor previously described Trump's attempt to fight inner city crime as 'tone deaf' and 'ignorant.' \n\nHe further argued the FBI and local law enforcement would be better suited for the task than the military. \n\n'It's because they have not walked our streets,' Moore added. 'They have not been in our communities, and they are more than happy to keep making these repeated tropes about us.' \n\nBaltimore recorded more than 2,500 crimes in the 17 days that followed Trump's deployment of the National Guard on DC, according to recent police statistics.\n\nThe city was plagued with a slew of violence including six homicides, nine rapes, 426 assaults and 271 aggravated assaults. There were also 252 auto thefts, 155 burglaries and 439 acts of vandalism\n\nMoore did invite Trump to come walk the streets of the city with him, but the president responded by saying he might 'send in the troops' instead. \n\nTrump said Moore's invitation came in a 'rather nasty and provocative tone' and then raised the specter of repeating the National Guard deployment he made in Los Angeles despite objections from California Gov. Gavin Newsom. \n\nThe president has also called out Moore's admission that he lied about getting a Bronze Star for his military service on a fellowship application - which the governor has called 'an honest mistake'.\n\nFrom 1996 until 2014, Moore served in the Army Reserve where he was deployed to Afghanistan from August 2005 until March 2006.\n\nThe rising Democratic star obtained multiple service awards, including a National Defense Service Medal, but he incorrectly claimed on a 2006 application for a White House fellowship that he was awarded a Bronze Star.\n\nWhen news broke of the misdeed, Trump jumped on it by posting a link to an article from The Hill covering Moore's apology.\n\n'But is that the end of his political career?' Trump asked his followers on Truth Social. 'He was very disrespectful to the Office of the President!'\n\nThe Daily Mail has approached representatives for Moore and Clooney for comment.","summary":"A Democratic governor is seeking refuge in the comforts of George Clooney's famous Lake Como villa.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-15055355/flees-war-donald-trump-italy-george-clooney.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/09/01/22/101740979-0-image-m-7_1756762272571.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-09-01 23:04:26","author":"Editor,Natasha Anderson","authors":["Editor","Natasha Anderson"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":0.121},{"id":356510312,"title":"The United States Uses a Fabricated Drug Charge for a Potential Strike on Venezuela","text":"By Vijay Prashad\n\nAuthor Bio: This article was produced by Globetrotter.

In January 2025, the White House designated Tren de Aragua as a “foreign terrorist organisation”, and in March, the administration of US President Donald Trump evoked the Alien Enemies Act (1789) to warn against the ‘invasion of the United States by Tren de Aragua’. The US State Department, in February 2025, had declared that Tren de Aragua was an international drug cartel on par with such already recognised cartels as the Mexican Las Zetas (now Cártel del Noreste), Sinaloa, and Jalisco cartels as well as the Mara Salvatrucha (MS-13) that was formed in Los Angeles (US) and has now taken root in El Salvador thanks to a decade-long US deportation policy. Unlike Tren de Aragua, these other cartels are well-known, and their work has been frequently documented by the US Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA).\n\nThe most recent DEA report for 2025 confirms several facts about the drug cartels that traffic vast amounts of drugs (from cocaine to fentanyl) into the United States. It certainly has long sections on the Mexican and Salvadorian gangs, which have deep roots in the drug trade. Since 2019, the DEA and other agencies have tracked the movement of lethal drugs from being carted via the Caribbean and the Central American landline to the Pacific Ocean route. Drugs leave the ports of Guayaquil (Peru), Esmeraldas (Ecuador), and Buenaventura (Colombia) for the ports such as Puerto Escondido (Mexico) before they are carted into the US market. Over 80 percent of the lethal drugs go along this Pacific coastline, according to the United Nations World Drug Report 2025, while only just above 10 percent go across the Caribbean Sea. For a very long time now, the DEA has made the accurate assessment that most of the drugs entering the United States come from the Andes, from Central America, and from Mexico.\n\nSo, what does Tren de Aragua have to do with any of this, since it is a prison gang created inside the Tocorón prison in central Venezuela (about 150 kilometres away from Caracas)? The gang was created in 2012 by Héctor Rushtenford “Niño” Guerrero Flores (a convicted criminal who escaped from the prison in 2023 and has not been seen since then). Niño Guerrero’s gang, Tren de Aragua, is accused of taking advantage of the migration out of Venezuela to build its network in the United States and elsewhere across Latin America and to expand his trafficking opportunities through this migration web. However, it is more than likely that the actual network does not exist, but that former Tren de Aragua members have consolidated themselves as nodes for criminal activity in different places. Guerrero is wanted in Venezuela and has a migration alert from Chile, where he is believed to have taken refuge amongst the half million Venezuelans in this southern cone country. The United States government has targeted Tren de Aragua and Guerrero, offeringa $12 million reward for his arrest. But Guerrero is nowhere to be found.\n\nA Fabricated Cartel\n\nHow does the United States government go from a legitimate concern for the entry of drugs into the country to sending seven US warships and one nuclear-power submarine, to encircle Venezuela for an “enhanced counter-narcotics operation”? How will these warships, which are just outside the Venezuelan sea boundary, do anything to either catch Guerrero, stop the Tren de Aragua, or prevent the cartels from carrying drugs to the United States? Guerrero is most likely not in Venezuela, his gang operates across Latin America and in the United States, and most of the drugs are carted through the Pacific Ocean and not the Caribbean Sea. So, what are these warships doing off Venezuela’s coastline, even though the US says that they are on an ‘anti-cartel mission’?\n\nIn April 2025, the United States increased its reward for the arrest of Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro Moros from $25 million to $50 million. The reason given for this increased bounty is that the US accuses Maduro of being the leader of the Cartel of the Suns (Cartel de los Soles). The term Cartel of the Suns was first used in 1993 to describe the activity of some senior military officers and anti-narcotics officials in the drug trade. This was long before the entry of Hugo Chávez into the presidential palace in 1999. The term was used because of the solar symbol on the uniforms of high-ranking Venezuelan army officers.\n\nThere was no actual cartel. After the death of Venezuelan president Hugo Chávez in 2013, several exiled Venezuelan journalists wrote books picking up on Marcano’s observation about the ‘suns’ but now arguing that there was an organised cartel and not just some corrupt officers. Central amongst these books is Héctor Landaeta’s Chavismo, Narcotráfico y Militares (2014) and Emili J. Blasco’s Bumerán Chávez: Los fraudes que llevaron al colapso de Venezuela (2015). But Landaeta told the Miami Herald in 2015 that “the Cartel de los Soles is more of a phenomenon than an organised group”. Nonetheless, in July 2025 the US Treasury Department designated the group as a “Specially Designated Global Terrorist”. Between Landaesta’s admission in 2015 and the present, there was almost silence in the US public documents about the fabricated Cartel de los Soles (although the use of a false drug charge against Maduro was used by Trump in 2020). There is no indication at all of any connection between this “cartel” and the Tren de Aragua, which is itself more a loose term that is nothing like the major Colombian and Mexican cartels that have vertical lines of organisation.\n\nThe massive military build-up along Venezuela’s coastline, the increased reward for the arrest of Maduro, and the accusation that the Venezuelan government is linked to the Tren de Aragua provides the foundation for a classic military intervention against Venezuela in the name of the War on Drugs. The idea of the Cartel de los Soles is operating like the Weapons of Mass Destruction in Iraq in 2002-03, with the US administration desperate to find the casus belli (cause for war) that otherwise simply does not exist.","summary":"By Vijay Prashad Author Bio:&#160;This article was produced by&#160;Globetrotter.

Rich shallow water habitats also nurture life, from fragile hatchlings that sustain our commercial fisheries to the vast abundance of birds and wildlife that call it home.\n\nThis is all at risk of being lost to sea level rise. We depend on healthy Bay ecosystems to sustain our entire region, so let’s invest in keeping them alive to ensure that future generations will thrive alongside them.\n\nCost of not drawing\nnew maps is too high\n\nRe: “California can’t pay for special election” (Page A6, Aug. 27).\n\nJohn Hoving laments the supposed cost of the November election. Well, let’s face facts: If we don’t try to counteract Texas’ redistricting, we may never have another election again. Boy, John, that’d save us a bunch of money, but at what cost?\n\nWe used to be a democracy: one person, one vote. What’s happened to America? What’s happened to adherence to the rule of law? What’s happened to habeas corpus? What’s happened to objective truth?\n\nPeople cannot ignore what’s happening and hope everything will be okay. Everyone needs to pay attention, read everything, listen to trusted voices and vote. The America we want depends on it.\n\nDenise DeLong\n\nDemocrats’ strategy\nfor Trump is too timid\n\nOn Aug. 25, I went to Rep. Sam Liccardo’s town hall in Portola Valley. What I saw demonstrated to me why Democrats have their lowest ratings in decades. I was deeply angered and frightened by his timid oratory.\n\nDonald Trump is invading Democratic run cities like Los Angeles and D.C. in order to have a police state in blue population centers in time to fix the midterms. Meanwhile, Liccardo ‘s strategy is to stand by and let Trump’s disastrous economic and authoritarian policies destroy our country, thinking the voters will then return the House to Democrats.\n\nWake up, Sam. Your strategy is wholly insufficient to meet the moment. Wake up, other weak Democrats. Wake up, America. Gov. Newsom is right; if Trump steals the midterms, this democracy is over. Paul Krugman is right. This is a five-alarm fire. Sound the alarm, everyone.\n\nMichael Baer\n\nValley Water works hard\nto serve customers\n\nRe: “Plans for new reservoir sink amid cost overruns” (Page A1, Aug. 27).\n\nThe recent unanimous decision to halt the Pacheco Reservoir Expansion Project will be viewed by many as long overdue, and hindsight will allow the project’s detractors to ridicule the time and money devoted to the project.\n\nI applaud Valley Water’s fine staff for all they do to secure a reliable water supply, promote conservation, maintain our aquifers, prevent flooding and protect our environment. Climate change is creating great uncertainty regarding future water supplies, and we should continue exploring all feasible storage solutions with the same relentless vigor that was devoted to Pacheco.\n\nI encourage anybody who is cynical about the management of our watersheds to learn more about Valley Water and get to know the competent, caring people who work there. If all you know about them is what you read in the paper, you are sure to get the wrong impression.\n\nDoug Peterson\n\nCollege leaders, Dems\ncreated climate of fear\n\nThe Trump administration is using a heavy-handed approach to fighting antisemitism on college campuses. The previous administrations either ignored the problem or practiced a form of appeasement, allowing a hostile environment for Jewish students.\n\nAnyone who saw Rep. Elise Stefanik grill three university presidents who could not say whether calling for the mass murder of Jews violated the campus code of conduct should understand what Jewish students have been facing. This hostility, and in some cases outright discrimination, has been festering long before the Hamas massacre on Oct. 7, 2023.\n\nHad college administrators and Democratic officials done their jobs, Donald Trump and associates would not have been able to weaponize the issue as they have. Whether it was to pander to the radical left wing of the party or just not caring about the safety and well-being of Jewish students, they contributed to a climate of fear that could have been avoided.\n\nGilbert Stein\n\nCitizens must call on\nTrump to end Gaza war\n\nThe ongoing conflict between Israel and Palestine has reached a devastating level. The world has watched in horror as communities have been torn apart, and innocent Palestinians, including a disproportionate number of children, have been killed.\n\nThe humanitarian crisis in Gaza is a stain on our collective conscience. Hospitals have been bombed, refugee camps have been attacked, and access to food, water and medical supplies has been severely restricted.\n\nIt is crucial that we, as global citizens, do not remain silent. We must call on our leaders to demand an immediate and permanent ceasefire and a commitment to international law. We must advocate for a lasting and just peace that addresses the root causes of this conflict, including the occupation, and ensures human rights for all. We can’t let the voices of the victims be silenced.\n\nThere is one person who can make this stop. That is President Trump.\n\nHelena Vella","summary":"Also: Inaction costly &#124; Timid strategy &#124; Valley Water &#124; Climate of fear &#124; Gaza war.

While President Donald Trump’s erratic tariffs are wrecking the economy writ large, they’re now going to wreck your personal economy writ small if you happen to like buying things from overseas.\n\nThe de minimis rule, which had allowed overseas goods worth less than $800 to enter the country duty-free, ended on Friday. Now, no matter how low the value, import costs apply. \n\nMuch of the focus on Trump’s tariffs has been on the increased costs of the goods themselves, noting that the things Americans routinely buy at low costs from overseas will become much more expensive. However, there’s also the issue of increased friction and chaos for overseas sellers, shippers, and foreign postal offices. \n\nThe de minimis rule smoothed the way for that low-cost commerce. Goods under that $800 threshold could be shipped directly to consumers, meaning no complicated determinations of tariff costs for sellers and shippers, and buyers didn’t have to go to the post office to pay duty fees to get a $9 Labubu accessory out of hock after it has undergone a full customs inspection.\n\nIf Trump’s tariffs were at least stable, sellers and shippers might decide they could deal with the tariff problem. Indeed, big shippers like UPS and FedEx are already equipped to figure out and pay country-specific duty costs. However, many smaller shippers ship through their country’s post office.\n\nIn killing the de minimis exemption, Trump also ordered that Customs and Border Protection wouldn’t assess the tariff duties stateside from packages sent via the international postal network. Therefore, post offices overseas must now calculate the duty and pay it to U.S. Customs. That involves the post office first setting up a way to collect tariff duties—yep, the ones that keep changing—from package senders. Then the post office has to pay the duties to CBP. Then the shipment can be handed over to the USPS for delivery within the United States.\n\nWhile postal services get that sorted, the only real solution in some instances is just to not ship any packages here. Note that “any packages” part. It’s not just that some overseas postal services aren’t going to send you that Labubu accessory purchased from an overseas website tapping into the Labubu frenzy. They’re not going to send any packages at all until there is more certainty about what sending things to the United States looks like. \n\nSo, if you were expecting a nice letter with some photographs from a relative in Mexico? That’s a package, and you can’t have it if your relative tried to send it via the country’s postal service. \n\nIf your theoretical relative lives in Japan and wants to use Japan Post, they could send you that letter and those photos, and could even throw in trinkets worth up to $100 in value. But if you tried to buy those same trinkets, a Japanese seller can’t send them to you through the country’s postal service. Similar to Australia, where your relative can send those trinkets but must comply with new mandatory declaration requirements regarding the value of the trinkets and their country of origin. If it looks like this is just a purchase in disguise, it can’t be sent. \n\nIndia, Thailand, South Korea, New Zealand—all of those postal services are now suspending package services, as are Switzerland and Taiwan. See also Austria, Belgium, and portions of Scandinavia.\n\nFor an example of how untenable this is, let’s pretend your relative moved to Finland and wants to send you a letter via post. No photos, no trinkets. Just a two-page handwritten letter about how well the little ones are doing at school and how nice summer vacation was. As of Aug. 22, you couldn’t even get that letter, because Finland’s postal service, the adorably named Posti, was dealing with the issue that airlines were refusing to accept anything bound for America, including letters. Then airlines began accepting some items again, so Posti announced it would again be accepting letters to be sent here. But as of Friday? Airlines are now again refusing to send postal items here, so Posti is back to sending nothing, not even cards or letters, to the United States. And you can’t blame them, really. \n\nAnd it’s not just countries that are suspending package shipments here. DHL, the German shipping group that handles tons of shipments for European sellers, announced it will not ship any business parcels here. Even major companies, like Lego, can’t hang with this chaos and are restricting what they will send here. And good luck if you’re trying to buy from a small Etsy seller or the like. \n\nThere is a credible and logical argument to be made that the de minimis exemption was too high, that it had become an import loophole for big companies rather than a way for you to get a sweet vintage fountain pen from a French seller on eBay without both of you having to be import-export specialists. There’s even a credible and logical argument to be made that the exemption allowed for unsafe or knockoff goods to enter the country in large quantities without ever being inspected. \n\nBut those aren’t the arguments the administration is making. \n\nTrump is a fool and has no idea what the exemption is, but he tries to cover it up with hyperbole: “It's very important, de minimis. It's a big deal. It's a big scam going on against our country, against really small businesses, and we've ended it. We put an end to it.” He’s also sure this will make it harder for fentanyl to enter the country, presumably under the theory that your relative can no longer tuck a couple of grams in with the family photos. \n\nIn the meantime, please enjoy America’s retreat from the global economy. Maybe we’ll just start making Legos and Labubu stateside and fix the economy that way?","summary":"By the time you’re reading this, it’s already too late.

Low writes that Churchill would exit their weekly meetings \"purring\".\n\nBiographer Sarah Bradford characterised Churchill's feelings for his monarch as \"tender and romantic\", notes Low. \"You had this idea that he came away from audiences with a very jaunty look about him. It was romantic with a small 'r' in the way that an old man can love a younger woman.\"\n\nThe queen's instant connection with Labour firebrand Harold Wilson was very different.\n\nIt seems an unlikely union because we assume the royal family has more in common with right-wing politicians, but Low says politics actually rarely came into the relationship between sovereign and prime minister, personality was the thing.\n\n\"Wilson talked to the queen like a normal person. One of the things I hadn't realised until I did the research for the book was how much [Conservative PM from 1957 to 63] Harold Macmillan bored her. He used to lecture her, which she found rather tedious,\" Low says.\n\n\"There's a story when Macmillan went up to Balmoral for the summer visit that some equerry or private secretary was deputed to take him for a long walk so the queen wouldn't be exposed to him for too long.\"\n\nThat was never the case with Wilson, with whom the monarch would happily spend hours.\n\n\"He liked political gossip and I learned that the queen did too. She liked to know what was going on, who was up, who was down, what was around the corner.\"\n\nLow cites a particularly amusing incident in the wake of a \"scurrilous\" story in the London Standard in 1974 about French president Valéry Giscard D'Estaing's penchant for \"lighter ladies of the town\" on his night-time walks in Paris.\n\nWhen Wilson told Her Majesty he was off to France for a meeting with D'Estaing, the queen joked with a \"ho ho\" and on his return playfully asked about about \"ho ho\", suggesting Wilson might himself have been out in Paris with the president, to which the prime minister replied: \"Ma'am, there was no ho ho!\"\n\nWhen Wilson lost the 1970 election (he returned to be PM a second time in 1974), of course the queen couldn't openly commiserate but she did wish him a well-deserved rest.\n\n\"Then Edward Heath came along, and he was totally the opposite to Wilson — very stiff, awkward, no small talk. The queen didn't like that at all. I think she adored Wilson.\"\n\nThatcher, Blair and Brexit\n\nHer relationship with Margaret Thatcher was more complex. Despite being two women leaders, there was no sense of shared sisterhood. Thatcher was an avowed monarchist and somewhat in awe of Elizabeth, always dropping into deep curtseys. That the two didn't exactly gel was certainly a source of disappointment for the iconic Conservative leader.\n\n\"People talk about, 'oh, the queen and Thatcher, they hated each other' but I don't believe either of them hated the other, I think Thatcher exasperated the queen,\" Low says.\n\n\"I think she found her difficult.\"\n\nWhen Thatcher first went to Balmoral, she failed to pack suitable footwear for the outdoor activities on the estate.\n\n\"She had to borrow a pair of Hush Puppies and multiple pairs of socks\", writes Low, underlining the differences between the two women. The Queen famously loved the outdoors.\n\nIssues between the two were most stark though over the Commonwealth, to which the queen was dedicated. Thatcher in contrast was \"naturally suspicious of international organisations that conspired, in her view, against Western interests,\" writes Low.\n\nWhen, finally, a story broke in the Sunday Times claiming that the queen found Thatcher's policies to be \"uncaring\", it went down like a lead balloon at Buckingham Palace.\n\n\"The queen was asked by someone close to her if the article was accurate. She said, 'No, not at all' and the person asked 'Well, how did you get on?' The queen said, 'Well, she was like all prime ministers. She didn't listen!'\"\n\nWhen Tony Blair came into office in 1997, he almost immediately had to negotiate the national meltdown following the death of Diana and encourage the queen to come down from Balmoral to grieve with her people. That was a significant blemish on Elizabeth's reign and looking into it in depth, Low says, he has come to understand a little more about what was really going on behind the scenes.\n\n\"The queen did have to be persuaded to change her mind on one or two issues, the famous one about the flag flying at half-mast and coming down to London, and I think there were some pretty bruising conversations that took place in order for that to come about,\" Low says.\n\nThe methods used to get the queen to do the right thing were convoluted, he says, and included enlisting Charles to speak directly to his mother.\n\n\"Blair wanted to persuade the queen midway through that week to have a change of tack, and it was not long into his premiership. He felt that he didn't know the queen well enough to put these arguments to her, so he put them to Charles instead, whom he knew better and was nearer his age, so there wasn't that same deference thing,\" Low explains. \"He used Charles to try and get the queen to change her mind.\"\n\nFor his part, Blair, like all prime ministers \"always wanted to please the queen and have her blessing,\" adds Low.\n\n\"In the early years a source told me that they felt that the queen's attitude was, 'he's new, he's got a lot to learn'. But I think she also recognised what he represented, the change in Britain,\" he says. \"The Gulf War was the thing that damaged Blair's reputation and I wonder if actually the queen was sympathetic to him about that.\"\n\nBlair's wife Cherie however was not a hit with her majesty. \"Cherie could put her foot in it. She was quite gauche and that didn't go down well.\"\n\nLow says the most surprising thing he discovered about Queen Elizabeth II was that \"she didn't want Britain to leave the European Union. We've always been led to believe that she supported Brexit, but it turns out not to be true. She was a bit of a remainer.\"\n\nThe other nugget Low uncovered was a story about the current Queen Camilla, who was assaulted on a train when she was a teenager.\n\n\"There was a sexual groper on board, his hand was wandering where it shouldn't. And when she was telling the story to then-prime minister Boris Johnson, she recalled, 'I did what my mother taught me. I took my shoe off and whacked him in the nuts with the heel,'\" Low says. \"And then she got off the train, found a man in uniform and [the man who assaulted her] was arrested.\"\n\nMeddling in Aussie politics\n\nThe biggest change in the relationship between the monarch and government over time has been the balance of power.\n\nQueen Victoria had veto over her prime minister and endlessly interfered in political policy.\n\nThat pendulum has shifted and the watershed moment, says Low, was the abdication of King Edward VIII in 1936.\n\n\"That was when the king wanted to do one thing and the cabinet another, and the cabinet won, that was new,\" Low says.\n\nAs the Prince of Wales, Charles's famous \"black spider memos\" — letters he sent to ministers to put across his own opinions on matters he was passionate about — caused a huge commotion when they were revealed in 2015, the result of a hard-fought newspaper freedom of information battle.\n\nBut the letter that stopped Low in his tracks was one Charles sent following the famous dismissal of Australia's Labor Whitlam government in 1975 by the queen's representative in Australia, governor-general John Kerr.\n\n\"When the so-called 'Palace letters' [the private communications between the palace and Sir John Kerr] came out in 2020, the overriding view was that the queen didn't know Kerr was going to do it and didn't ask for him to do it,\" says Low. \"I think there was an element of the palace being involved, but they didn't actively connive in the sacking … they watched on and sat on their hands.\n\n\"But to me, the other thing that was unexpected about this matter was the letter that Charles wrote to the governor-general a few months later, saying you did the right thing, you know … a very unwise thing to have done, although I'm sure Charles would have thought it was said in private. I'm surprised it doesn't get more mention.\"\n\nLow says that as King Charles III, those meddling days are long behind him. \"Charles is very anxious to prove that he is a good constitutional monarch and will do what his government wants him to do.\"\n\nThis month, that will include hosting US President Donald Trump at Windsor Castle in a much-vaunted official state visit.\n\nCertainly, King Charles III is already more involved in politics than his mother, Queen Elizabeth II, but so far that seems to be working out, notes Low.\n\n\"I think if you can marshal his passions where they align with your government's, that's quite a productive way of going forward. The recent meeting with Ukrainian President Zelenskyy, for example, was absolutely with the blessing of the government.\"\n\nPower and the Palace: The Inside Story of The Monarchy and 10 Downing Street by Valentine Low is released next week.","summary":"From detailing Princess Diana's secret counselling sessions with the queen's favourite PM, to meddling in Australia's biggest political scandal, this new book lays bare the relationship between Crown and State","url":"https://www.abc.net.au/news/2025-09-02/royal-family-diana-queen-valentine-low-power-and-palace-major/105714708","image":"https://live-production.wcms.abc-cdn.net.au/505e65f379d845e87ff07fc13d9d373c?impolicy=wcms_crop_resize&cropH=450&cropW=800&xPos=0&yPos=94&width=862&height=485","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-09-01 23:00:00","author":"Juliet Rieden","authors":["Juliet Rieden"],"language":"en","source_country":"AU","sentiment":0.255},{"id":356515468,"title":"South Australia bans fish-shaped soy sauce bottles and polystyrene containers under plastic laws","text":"Tiny fish-shaped soy sauce bottles are the latest casualty in Australia’s fight against waste, outlawed by single-use plastic laws that took effect on Monday.

The ban applies to all rigid plastic condiment containers with lids under that size, commonly handed out with takeaway meals. Along with soy sauce fish, the state extended the ban to single-use straws and cutlery attached to food or drink containers, such as straws on juice boxes.

In 2022, the state banned expanded polystyrene cups, bowls, plates and clamshell containers common in takeout, along with oxo-degradable plastic products. Since then, South Australia has also banned items including plastic-stemmed cotton buds, pizza savers, barrier bags, thick supermarket bags, single-use food containers, plastic confetti and food bag tags. TRUMP, ELON MUSK BOND OVER PLASTIC STRAWS States and municipalities across the U.S. have imposed their own single-use plastic bans, targeting items like straws and plastic bags. While Australia tightens restrictions, the U.S. appears to be moving in the opposite direction. Earlier this year, President Donald Trump signed an executive order ending the \"procurement and forced use of paper straws.\" The order directed the federal government to stop purchasing paper straws and ensure they are no longer offered in federal buildings. The order also required a \"National Strategy\" to end the use of paper straws within 45 days and \"alleviate the forced use of paper straws nationwide.\" According to the White House, paper straws are more expensive than plastic straws and use chemicals that may carry risks to human health.

He is fully alert and conscious, and his medical team is pleased with his progress,' Ragusa told the Daily Mail.\n\nGiuliani's son Andrew also thanked supporters for their prayers in the aftermath of the crash.\n\n'Thank you to all the people that have reached out since learning the news about my Father. Your prayers mean the world,' Andrew Giuliani wrote on social media.\n\n'As a son, I can tell you I'm honored to have a Dad that I can call the toughest SOB I've ever seen!'\n\nTo celebrate Giuliani in his hour of need, President Donald Trump announced he would award him the presidential medal of freedom, crowning him the 'greatest mayor in the history' of that city. \n\nThe president said that details of the medal award ceremony would be announced at a later date.\n\nTrump has long celebrated Giuliani's legacy as Mayor of New York City and utilized his legal services particularly while unsuccessfully challenging the 2020 election as fraudulent.\n\nBut the former mayor's work for Trump resulted in his own legal troubles\n\nGiuliani was was disbarred in New York and Washington D.C. from practicing law.\n\nHe was also found guilty for defaming two Georgia election polls workers by accusing them of tampering with ballots during the presidential election.","summary":"Michael Ragusa took to social media Monday with a video updating the public on Giuliani's condition while hitting back at his liberal haters.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-15055955/Rudy-Giuliani-rep-rants-against-leftists.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/09/01/23/101741339-0-image-m-13_1756766330665.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-09-01 22:54:26","author":"Editor,Stephen M.

Pope Leo also sent condolences for the dead.\nThe earthquake killed 812 people in the eastern provinces of Kunar and Nangarhar, administration spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid said.\nZiaul Haq Mohammadi, a student at Al-Falah University in the eastern city of Jalalabad, was studying in his room at home when the earthquake struck. He said he tried to stand up but was knocked over by the power of the tremor.\n“We spent the whole night in fear and anxiety because at any moment another earthquake could happen,” Mohammadi said.\nRescuers were battling to reach remote mountainous areas cut off from mobile networks along the Pakistan border, where mud-brick homes dotting the slopes collapsed in the earthquake.\n“The area of the earthquake was affected by heavy rain in the last 24-48 hours as well, so the risk of landslides and rock slides is also quite significant – that is why many of the roads are impassable,” Kate Carey, an officer at the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (UNOCHA), told Reuters.\n\nRescue teams and authorities are trying to dispose of animal carcasses quickly so as to minimise the risk of contamination to water resources, Carey said.\nCasualties could rise as rescue teams access more isolated locations, authorities said.\n“All our … teams have been mobilised to accelerate assistance, so that comprehensive and full support can be provided,” said health ministry spokesman Abdul Maten Qanee, citing efforts in areas from security to food and health.\nReuters Television images showed helicopters ferrying out the affected, while residents helped security forces and medical workers carry the wounded to ambulances in an area with a long history of earthquakes and floods.\nMilitary rescue teams fanned out across the region, the defence ministry said, with 40 flights carrying away 420 wounded and dead.\nThe earthquake razed three villages in Kunar, with substantial damage in many others, authorities said. At least 610 people were killed in Kunar with 12 dead in Nangarhar, they added.\nSome villagers sat weeping amid the piled ruins of their homes. Others began laboriously clearing the debris by hand or carrying out the injured on makeshift stretchers.\n“This is Mazar Dara in Nurgal district.

Politico revealed that the president has upgraded the ceiling lights in the Cabinet room following his apparent dissatisfaction with footage from an earlier session, according to an unnamed White House source . During his second presidency, Trump's Cabinet meetings have stretched on for hours whilst members heap praise upon the President rather than tackling policy matters. It remains unclear which particular gathering sparked the president's frustration , though social media users previously highlighted the subpar lighting during a March meeting, with journalist Aaron Rupar observing, \"Interesting lighting for this cabinet meeting. Trump's hair looks like it's glowing in the dark.\" Observers have also spotted Trump's fondness for gold décor. The Cabinet room has been completely adorned with golden accessories, a design element that has extended into the Oval Office. This lighting enhancement represents merely the most recent modification Trump has implemented at the White House since assuming office in January. Plans for a $200 million ballroom that will expand the East Wing were also unveiled several weeks ago, with completion scheduled for 2028 - perfectly timed for Trump's final year in office. A source said: \"He seems to wake up and say what else needs to be improved. Every day, it is something new.\" The president has also floated concepts beyond the White House grounds, including rebranding a golf course situated in the heart of the Potomac River. Only last week, he declared that Washington, D.C. would be \"beautified in 12 months. White House spokesman Davis Ingle said: \"President Trump is a builder at heart and has brought this talent to our nation's capital. \"He is restoring American greatness to everything he touches-from the White House to our federal buildings and D.C. parks - and is fulfilling his promise to usher in a new golden age of America.\" Whilst Trump isn't the only president to have ever implemented changes to the White House, Stewart McLaurin, president of the White House Historical Association, told Politico: \"this is probably the first time when there are so many at once.\" The unnamed White House official informed the publication that Trump's ambition extends beyond mere aesthetics and splendour. \"He is actually thinking about his legacy.

Calling out corporate media’s apparent bias and the Democratic Party’s attempts to regain voters ahead of the midterms, Gutfeld has torched those efforts on his late-night show. (RELATED: Watch Greg Gutfeld Shred Dems For Their Role Creating MN Shooter And Then Trying To ‘Escape Their Own Culpability’)\n\n1. The Washington Post’s ‘Journalistic Stroke Job’\n\nIn June, The Post ran a piece titled “These centrist women in a group chat are leading Democrats in 2025,” naming Virginia gubernatorial nominee Abigail Spanberger, New Jersey Rep. Mikie Sherrill and Michigan Sen. Elissa Slotkin as the party’s “moderate” leaders.\n\nDuring his show, Gutfeld ripped into the “fluff bomb” article, highlighting the irony of Democrats celebrating women while simultaneously pushing biological males who identify as trans into the group.\n\n“This week, the Washington Post ran a fluff bomb celebrating centrist Democrat women going gaga over their resumes, mom energy, and group chat chemistry. But in this journalistic stroke job, not a single policy position was mentioned, which is weird,” Gutfeld said. “That’s like doing a profile on me and not mentioning my many bodybuilding awards … So why is that? Why’d they bend so far backward to avoid a basic stance? Maybe because in the current state of their party, it’s better just to keep your head down and to stay safe.”\n\n“They substitute substance with nicknames, the Mod Squad or the Badass Caucus. But it’s fake empowerment meant to disguise a lack of bravery. But what are they scared of? What’s the dog not barking? The key question to detect a centrist is, do males belong in women’s sports? Of course, we all know the answer to that. It’s yes. Someone has to show them how to hold a bat,” Gutfeld added. “But the Democrat Party is different. It’s a collection of appeasement signals where one group must submit to the other … It’s why the loudest members of the party are usually white women. It’s an appeasement signal. They wish to pass inspection by dramatically applauding extremes to avoid being targeted for their whiteness.”\n\nThe battle over protecting women’s sports has caused sharp divisions, with Republicans calling to remove biological males from competing while Democrats rally behind their inclusion despite numerous reports of the dangers it poses to women.\n\nAccording to a Harvard CAPS Harris Poll conducted in February, 69% of Americans surveyed said they support “banning men who have undergone operations and hormones to become women from girls’ sports.” Of the majority of support, 50% were Democrats, 86% were Republicans and 70% were either independents or other, according to the data.\n\n2. Mamdani’s High School Transcripts and JB Pritzker’s ‘Bra’\n\nDespite emphasizing his Muslim background during his campaign, socialist Democrat NYC mayoral nominee Zohran Mamdani marked himself as both “Asian” and “African American” on his Columbia University application in 2009, according to The New York Times.\n\nDespite ultimately not being admitted to Columbia University, Gutfeld called out how the mayoral nominee appeared to benefit from the Ivy League’s push to incorporate Diversity, Equity and Inclusion, which has offered advantages for diverse applicants.\n\n“But it raises the often-ignored question. How can you claim to be oppressed when you know the claim gets preferential treatment? I mean, why would anyone voluntarily choose an identity that supposedly holds you back unless you knew it could actually move you forward? So he saw the grift using a false disadvantage to actually get ahead. He was lying to get what he wanted. Like when I used to tell women that I love them,” Gutfeld added. “He wasn’t confused. He was calculating. Mamdani knew that applying while black could be a ticket past the velvet rope of Ivy League admissions. And that was in 2009.”\n\n“But being of Indian heritage isn’t a resume builder when you’re auditioning for the Oppression Olympics. So he pulls a [Fox’s Brian] Kilmeade, faking a limp so he can board first on Delta,” Gutfeld said. “But you notice it’s always the lefties who pull this kind of shit. Their thinking is, we created this game, might as well take advantage of it. So he dumped his past and he picked the one that carries social capital. Still, he didn’t get in, which means his transcript had so many Ds in it, it looked like [Illinois] Governor [JB] Pritzker’s bra.”\n\nIn response to the transcripts, Mamdani told the NYT that he did not consider himself “Black or African American” but rather “an American who was born in Africa.” Acknowledging that he did check off the boxes, the socialist Democrat told the outlet he wrote in “Ugandan,” as the application allowed applicants to provide “more specific information where relevant.”\n\n3. Democrats Nosedive On American Pride\n\nIn June, a Gallup poll found that only 36% of Democrats were “extremely” or “very” proud to be American, a drop of roughly 26 points from the year prior. On his late night show, Gutfeld noted how Democrats’ pride appeared to depend on who is in office, as the poll was conducted after Trump returned to the White House.\n\n“For a new poll, Democrats have lost pride in the United States, although I’m not sure how you lose something you never had. That’s like a poll revealing that Joy Behar lost her sex appeal. But apparently just 36% of Dems are extremely or very proud to be a Yank. That’s down from 62% a year ago, back when the president had a body temp of a crisp 62 degrees. But when Trump won, their national pride nosedived like a pilot listening to Kilmeade’s audiobook. Now they’re feeling about as proud as a dad whose son was just named prom queen,” Gutfeld said.\n\nAccording to the poll, Democrats’ national pride rose from 42% in 2020 to 62% after Joe Biden took office the following year. Republican patriotism, however, remained in the 80–90% range during Biden’s presidency and climbed to 92% after Trump returned to office.\n\n“But the right has a much different view of our red, white, and blue, and it’s the flag the left considers a hate crime, especially if it blocks their queers for Palestine banner … It’s something we got to deal with to be sure, but it’s not our identity,” Gutfeld said.\n\n“But when politics doesn’t tilt in the left’s favor, it ruins their lives because it’s who they are. So it’s no wonder the second Trump does something great, they lose their shit faster than a knocked over porta potty. Oh, they love separating people by race, size, class, education, yet they can’t separate politics from their daily lives. Without politics, they’d lose their personal identity quicker than Barbra Streisand after a nose job,” Gutfeld said.\n\n4. ‘Fat Dexter’ Eric Swalwell \n\nAfter being sent home for summer recess, California Rep. Eric Swalwell posted a video of himself bench pressing an estimated 135 pounds, claiming Republicans sent members home over the Epstein files chaos. The clip was mocked online, with Gutfeld noting he had ridiculed it before, prompting Swalwell to challenge him to a “bench press contest.”\n\n“But because we ragged the video, the poor sap, aka Fat Dexter, has challenged me to a bench press contest. And the loser, he says, has to quit their job. Yes, Swalwell, the only man to ever be outlifted in the Capitol Gym by the groundhog on Maxine Waters’ head, says he wants to meet me in the weight room. Now, perhaps it’s all a plan to get me in the gym sauna by himself. But Swalwell also claimed that he had never heard of me,” Gutfeld said. “Right, nice try, Eric. Everyone knows me. I’m so famous, you can’t go to a Cambodian prison without hearing my name.”\n\n“So Eric, if you really want anyone to take you seriously, you might try truth instead of being so damn thirsty. It’s why you got honey potted by a Chinese spy. She looked at you and thought, ‘Hmm, a socially inept dork who hasn’t got his weenie wet since a field trip to the water slide in seventh grade. I got this one,'” Gutfeld added. “I mean, what else could she see in a guy who looks like he buys boner pills from the New Zealand dark web? Maybe it’s because you once rode a camel shirtless. Wow, I’m looking at that picture and wondering which hairy beast retains more water.”\n\nIn 2023, Swalwell was removed from the House Intelligence Committee by former Republican House Speaker Kevin McCarthy over his interactions with alleged spy Christine Fang.\n\nFang had been a volunteer on Swalwell’s 2014 House campaign, reportedly participating in fundraisers for him and placing an intern on his staff. The FBI briefed him on Fang’s Chinese government ties. Republicans have long insinuated that Swalwell had a sexual relationship with her, though the Democrat lawmaker has declined to speak on the claims.\n\n5. Gutfeld Lifts Ratings For Others\n\nAccording to Nielsen Media Research, Gutfeld’s first appearance in August on NBC’s “The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon” brought in the show’s largest audience of 2025, attracting 1.7 million viewers. During his appearance on Fallon, the Fox host recalled a time when Fallon wrestled him inside a bar.\n\n“I walk into this bar, and I’m with my friend Andy. We just got off shooting something, and I look around and go ‘What the hell have I got into?’ And then I see you, and you look at me and you have your eyes kind of explode. And then you run towards me, and you tackle me like a giant golden retriever.

Venezuela’s military is “super prepared,” he said.\n\nVenezuela’s government has scoffed at U.S. assertions that the country and its leadership are key to major international drug trafficking.\n\nIn early August, the United States doubled its reward for information leading to Maduro’s arrest to $50 million over allegations of drug trafficking and links to criminal groups.\n\nWhile U.S. Coast Guard and Navy ships regularly operate in the Southern Caribbean, this buildup is significantly larger than usual deployments in the region.\n\nBut it is unclear exactly how the U.S. military presence would disrupt the drug trade.\n\nMost of the seaborne drug trade travels to the United States via the Pacific, not the Atlantic, where the U.S. forces are, and much of what arrives via the Caribbean comes on clandestine flights, according to the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime’s 2023 Global Report on Cocaine.\n\nVenezuela’s President Nicolas Maduro addresses the media, in Caracas, Venezuela, September 1, 2025.

In an interview published Monday by the conservative news site Daily Caller, Trump said, “Israel will have to end this war. They may be winning the war, but they are not winning in the court of public opinion—and it’s hurting them.” He added that Israel’s influence in Washington has weakened in recent years. “If you go back 15–20 years, Israel had the strongest lobby in Congress of anything or body, or of any company or corporation or state that I’ve ever seen. Israel was the strongest, and today it doesn’t have that strong a lobby. It’s amazing.” Trump also pointed to the growing prominence of progressive lawmakers. “There was a time where you couldn’t speak badly about Israel if you wanted to be a politician—you couldn’t. But today you have Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and all these lunatics, and they’ve really changed it,” he said. “Israel once had complete control in Congress, and now it doesn’t. I’m a little surprised to see it.” “People have forgotten October 7, it was a really horrible day,\" he added. \"I saw the pictures. It was really bad. You have people that deny it ever happened. You have people that deny the Holocaust ever happened,” he said. Last week, the White House held an internal discussion on postwar planning for Gaza. A senior official said Trump convened a policy meeting with aides to review “all aspects of the Gaza issue, including increasing aid deliveries, the hostage crisis and plans for the day after the war.” Another official said Trump “made clear that he wants the war to end, and that he wants peace and prosperity for all the people of the region.” U.S. officials have repeatedly signaled their preference for a quick resolution to the conflict. Both Trump and his special envoy, Steve Witkoff, have indicated the timeline for the war should be short, even if Israel goes ahead with a planned offensive to capture Gaza City. On Tuesday, families of Israeli hostages planned to demonstrate outside the U.S. Embassy in Tel Aviv, urging Trump to press for an agreement to secure their relatives’ release and end the war. Organizers said they would present a symbolic peace agreement and a mock Nobel Prize certificate to highlight what they described as a “historic opportunity” for U.S. leadership. “An agreement for the return of the hostages is now on the negotiating table through mediators,” the families said in a statement. “Yet the Israeli government continues to obstruct it and refuses to discuss it, putting our loved ones in real danger.”","summary":"U.S. president says Israel’s influence in Congress has weakened, noting that progressive lawmakers have shifted the debate; 'Israel once had complete control in Congress, and now it doesn’t,' he says","url":"https://www.ynetnews.com/article/sjvno9q5xx","image":"https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/08/25/Bk11ebB9tgl/Bk11ebB9tgl_0_0_3000_2000_0_large.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-09-01 22:24:11","author":"Ynet","authors":["Ynet"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"il","sentiment":-0.269},{"id":356507594,"title":"Trump to award Rudy Giuliani the Presidential Medal of Freedom","text":"Sept. 1 (UPI) -- President Donald Trump announced Monday he will award the Presidential Medal of Freedom -- the nation's highest civilian honor -- to Rudy Giuliani, as the former New York City mayor was being released from the hospital following a weekend car crash.\n\nTrump called his one-time lawyer \"the greatest mayor\" and a \"great American patriot,\" in a post Monday on Truth Social.\n\n\"As president of the United States of America, I am pleased to announce that Rudy Giuliani, the greatest mayor in the history of New York City, and an equally great American patriot, will receive THE PRESIDENTIAL MEDAL OF FREEDOM, our country's highest civilian honor,\" Trump wrote, adding that details about a time and location were still being worked out.\n\nGiuliani, 81, was released from the hospital Monday afternoon after he was involved in a car crash in Manchester, N.H., on Saturday night.

Many leaders -- including Putin -- will remain in China after the SCO to attend the parade.\n\nPutin Blames The West\n\nAt the SCO in Tianjin outside of Beijing, Putin sent a defiant message against the West over his invasion of Ukraine after standing shoulder-to-shoulder with Chinese leader Xi Jinping.\n\nPutin said the war in Ukraine came about “not as a result of a Russian attack” but because of a Western-backed coup in Kyiv, according to comments carried by the Russian news agency TASS.\n\nThat was an inaccurate reference to the Maidan protests that pushed Moscow-friendly Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych from power in 2014, after he scrapped plans for a trade agreement with the EU and turned toward Russia instead.\n\nPutin added that what he called the West’s attempts to draw Ukraine into NATO posed a \"direct threat to Russia’s security,\" a claim that the military alliance has repeatedly denied.\n\nMeanwhile, Kyiv's European allies in the so-called Coalition of the Willing -- led by French President Emmanuel Macron and British Prime Minister Keir Starmer -- are set to meet in Paris on September 4 to discuss potential security guarantees for Ukraine.\n\n\"Together with our partners, and in coordination with NATO, we will work to define robust security guarantees for Ukraine. These are a necessary prerequisite to move credibly towards peace,\" Macron wrote on X following talks with NATO chief Mark Rutte.\n\n\"We will also review Russia’s stance, as it persists in its war of aggression and continues to reject peace,\" Macron added.\n\nEuropean Commission President Ursula von der Leyen on August 31 said Kyiv's European allies were working on “pretty precise plans” and a \"clear road map\" for a potential deployment of troops to Ukraine should a peace deal be struck between Kyiv and Moscow,\n\nVon der Leyen, in comments published in The Financial Times on August 31, added that any such venture would have the full backing of the United States, which has swayed back and forth on potential involvement over the past year.\n\n'No Concrete Plans' For Trilateral Summit\n\nSeparately, on the sidelines of the SCO, Kremlin foreign policy adviser Yury Ushakov said there were no immediate plans for a trilateral meeting between Putin, Zelenskyy, and US President Donald Trump, contradicting recent remarks by Trump that he was arranging such a meeting.\n\n\"Now everyone is talking about a trilateral summit...but there has been no concrete agreement on this between Putin and Trump,\" Ushakov said.\n\nTrump, who has made ending the war a top priority of his administration, has grown increasingly frustrated with Putin's refusal to meet with Zelenskyy but has suggested he was moving toward a trilateral meeting with himself included.\n\nTrump has also expressed anger with Russia's nonstop campaign of air assaults on Ukrainian cities, causing civilian deaths and damage to infrastructure.\n\nWith reporting by RFE/RL's Ukrainian Service and dpa","summary":"Ukraine urged China to pressure Vladimir Putin to move toward peace as the Russian president arrived in Beijing following his participation in the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO) summit – where he defended the war that has killed tens of thousands of people.","url":"https://www.rferl.org/a/china-putin-sco-xi-ukraine-ceasefire-zelenskyy/33518925.html","image":"https://gdb.rferl.org/0baacf90-5efb-418f-7af2-08ddc3797fd2_w1080_h608.jpeg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-09-01 22:02:03","author":"Rfe/rl","authors":["Rfe/rl"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"iq","sentiment":0.06},{"id":356517206,"title":"Inside Todd and Julie Chrisley's Decades-Long Relationship (Including Their 1 'Rough Moment' When Reuniting After Prison)","text":"Todd Chrisley and Julie Chrisley’s marriage has seen its fair share of ups and downs.\n\n The couple, who have been married since 1996, first rose to fame in 2014 as the stars of their eponymous reality show, Chrisley Knows Best. The series, which was billed as the southern version of the Kardashians, followed Todd and Julie and their children as they lived their lavish lifestyle — first, in a 30,000-square-foot mansion in Atlanta, and then, in two equally opulent Nashville homes. The show, which aired on USA Network for 10 seasons, was an instant hit and cemented the Chrisleys as reality television stars.\n\n But Todd and Julie have also had their struggles over the years. They’ve weathered illness (Julie was diagnosed with breast cancer in 2012), family strife (including an ongoing estrangement from Todd’s son from a previous marriage, Kyle) and legal troubles (the couple were convicted of tax and bank fraud in 2022). After spending 28 months behind bars, the Chrisleys were pardoned by President Donald Trump on May 27, 2025, and released from federal prison the next day.\n\n Throughout it all, the Chrisleys’ love for one another has remained strong. In his first press conference following his pardon and release from prison, Todd took the time to gush about his wife of nearly 30 years — referring to Julie as his “best friend” who has been through “all the ups and downs” of life with him.\n\n “It was great to be home,” Todd said. “No matter where that is, as long as she's there, it's home.”\n\n From their first encounter to their latest reality television venture, The Chrisleys: Back to Reality, which premieres on Lifetime on Sept. 1, here is everything to know about Todd and Julie Chrisley’s marriage.\n\n Todd and Julie were both previously married \n\n Todd and Julie were both married once before saying “I do” to each other.\n\n Todd wed his high school girlfriend, Teresa Terry, with whom he shares daughter Lindsie, born in 1989, and son Kyle, born in 1991.\n\n Julie, meanwhile, was married to Keith Wayne Childress, according to the Los Angeles Times. The couple had no children together and eventually split.\n\n They first met at a friend’s house \n\n Todd and Julie first crossed paths when Julie showed up at Todd’s friend’s house — and Todd was instantly smitten, he revealed on an episode of their podcast Chrisley Confessions.\n\n “She walked into my friend’s house, and it was during the winter months, and I remember when she walked in and she smiled, I thought, ‘She has got the most beautiful smile I have ever seen,’ ” Todd said.\n\n He added, “She’s the only woman who has ever literally touched my soul.”\n\n But while Todd may have fallen head over heels, Julie, however, played hard to get from the moment they met, according to their daughter Savannah.\n\n “I've read parts of the book that he's working on, and I was just sobbing, just because he talks about the first time he saw my mother, how he felt, how he would just go into the bank just to be able to see her,” she shared on a June 2023 episode of her podcast Unlocked with Savannah Chrisley. “And she wouldn't give him the time of day.”\n\n Julie initially turned down Todd’s proposal \n\n Todd first proposed to Julie after she became pregnant with their first child together — and Julie said no, twice, according to Savannah. Julie's hesitation stemmed from a combination of factors, including “getting pregnant out of wedlock,” having a preacher for a father and Todd’s previous divorce, Savannah detailed on her podcast.\n\n “I think of my mom in her early 20s when she got pregnant with Chase, so my older brother, who's 14 months older than me,” Savannah shared. “My dad had just come off a divorce, he had two kids, and my mom was the preacher's daughter in a small, one stoplight town in South Carolina — preacher's daughter. Everyone knew everyone.”\n\n Instead, Julie planned to raise her child on her own — with Todd’s involvement as a co-parent, not a spouse.\n\n “She got pregnant, and she told my dad, she was like, 'I am not marrying you. This is my baby. I'm gonna raise my baby. If you want to be involved in his life you can, but I'm raising my child,’” Savannah revealed.\n\n Savannah continued, \"She told him, she was like, 'I'm not marrying you, just for you to make the same mistake you made with your first wife.”\n\n But despite two rejections from Julie, Todd persisted. It paid off, and Julie eventually agreed to marry him. The couple said “I do” on May 25, 1996, when Julie was nine months pregnant with the eldest child, son Chase. She gave birth one week later, on June 1, 1996.\n\n \"He asked her twice, and she told him no. And now, look at 'em, 27 years later,\" Savannah said.\n\n Todd and Julie have three children together \n\n In addition to his two children with his first wife Teresa Terry (Lindsie and Kyle), Todd has three children with Julie: Chase, Savannah and Grayson Chrisley.\n\n After welcoming Chase in June 1996, Todd and Julie had their second child, daughter Savannah, 14 months later in August 1997. Their third and youngest child, son Grayson, was born on May 16, 2006. Todd and Julie also adopted their granddaughter Chloe, who is the daughter of Todd’s estranged son Kyle and a woman named Angela Johnson, in 2016. The Chrisleys took in Chloe amidst Kyle’s legal issues and struggles with substance abuse.\n\n The Chrisley children all appeared on the family’s reality show, Chrisley Knows Best, beginning in 2014. Growing up on-screen came with its own pros and cons, Savannah and Chase revealed to PEOPLE in 2020.\n\n \"It definitely changed our lives entirely,” Chase shared at the time. “It forced us to grow up fast.”\n\n Savannah added, “Growing up on TV ... There was a lot of pressure to be perfect ... but overall it’s given us a platform to help others and meet a lot of people. I don’t think we can complain too much.”\n\n Todd helped Julie through her breast cancer diagnosis in 2012 \n\n From Julie’s breast cancer diagnosis to her double mastectomy, Todd was a pillar of support for his wife. After two friends were diagnosed with breast cancer, Todd pushed for Julie to receive a mammogram in 2012 — even though she was only 39 years old with no family history.\n\n “I did it to appease him so he would shut up and leave me alone,” Julie told The Tennessean in 2018.\n\n The mammogram, plus additional imaging and a biopsy, revealed a diagnosis of breast cancer. For treatment, Julie opted for a double mastectomy — and Todd was by her side as she recovered from the intense operation. It was an experience that ultimately strengthened their marriage, Julie revealed in the interview.\n\n “I truly believe that that moment took our relationship to a whole other level because he never flinched,” she said. “He was in the shower with me, he took all of my bandages off, and he never flinched.”\n\n Todd and Julie were convicted of bank and tax fraud in 2022 and sentenced to jail time \n\n In August 2019, the Chrisleys were indicted by a federal grand jury on 12 counts of bank and wire fraud, tax evasion, and conspiracy. Prosecutors accused the reality stars of creating false documents to secure $30 million in bank loans in order to pay for their over-the-top lifestyle — and then filing for bankruptcy to avoid paying the more than $20 million they owed. Additionally, the Chrisleys allegedly lied about the millions of dollars they earned from Chrisley Knows Best and created a shell company to reportedly hide assets from the IRS.\n\n The Chrisleys turned themselves in and pleaded not guilty to all charges. Instead, Todd claimed in a lengthy Instagram post that a former “trusted employee” had been “stealing” from them for the past seven years, as well as “creating phony documents, forging our signatures, and threatening other employees with violence if they said anything.”\n\n “We fired the guy and took him to court — and that’s when the real trouble started,” Todd wrote. “To get revenge, he took a bunch of his phony documents to the U.S. Attorney’s office and told them we had committed all kinds of financial crimes, like tax evasion and bank fraud.”\n\n Todd and Julie’s federal fraud trial began in May 2022 in Atlanta. At the conclusion of the three-week trial, the couple were found guilty of conspiracy to commit bank fraud, conspiracy to defraud the United States and tax fraud. Julie was also found guilty of wire fraud. They faced up to 30 years in prison as a result of their convictions.\n\n “Both Chrisleys are devastated and disappointed with the verdict and will be pursuing an appeal,” the pair's lawyer Steve Friedberg told PEOPLE at the time.\n\n In November 2022, the Chrisleys received their sentences: A federal judge sentenced Todd to 12 years in prison and 16 months probation, while Julie received seven years in prison and 16 months probation. They began their prison sentences on Jan. 17, 2023 — with Todd reporting to Florida's Federal Prison Camp Pensacola and Julie entering the Federal Medical Center in Lexington, Ky.\n\n Todd and Julie went two years without speaking while in prison \n\n While serving their federal prison sentences, the Chrisleys were unable to communicate with each other for nearly two years, their daughter Savannah confirmed to PEOPLE in February 2025.\n\n “They don't get to speak. It's been two years, and they haven't spoken a word to each other,” Savannah revealed. “They've been together almost 30 years, and they've never gone a day in their life without being with one another. That's been a challenge. That should never happen.”\n\n Todd and Julie, who were in prisons 650 miles apart, were unable to write letters or speak on the phone to each other. Their only form of communication was email, but that was often “delayed,” according to Savannah.\n\n “I miss Todd so much that it hurts. I’ve never gone this long without talking to him,” Julie wrote in a letter from prison sent to Savannah.\n\n Savannah was outraged on behalf of her parents. “There should never be a time where they keep them from communicating, and they do,” she said. “They interfere with emails, they interfere with mail. There was mail theft and fraud at my dad's facility that I'm still not going to allow that person to get away with.”\n\n As a result of her parents’ experience behind bars, Savannah began work as a prison reform activist and campaigned for President Trump to pardon her parents’ case — while also serving as the legal guardian of her two youngest siblings, Chloe and Grayson. Throughout her parents’ ordeal, Savannah remained positive and persistent.\n\n \"It sucks that my parents are going through what they're going through but we're going to take this and make something great out of it,\" Savannah said. “And in the end, the government will not win.”\n\n The Chrisleys were pardoned by President Trump in May 2025 and reunited after two years apart \n\n More than two years into their prison sentences, the Chrisleys were granted a full pardon by President Trump on May 27, 2025.\n\n Savannah celebrated the news in a statement, saying: “For the past two and a half years, I’ve done everything in my power to fight for my parents’ freedom and bring them home. This moment is the answer to countless prayers, and I am beyond grateful to President Trump for seeing the truth and restoring my family.”\n\n The couple were reunited for the first time in more than two years on May 29, 2025 — just days after their 29th wedding anniversary. Savannah captured the moment on Instagram Stories, sharing a photo of Todd and Julie’s legs as they sat facing each other and writing, “Reunited and it feels so good!”\n\n Todd and Julie later discussed their reunion on a July episode of their Chrisley Confessions 2.0 podcast. In a brutally honest exchange, Todd admitted to being shocked by Julie’s appearance — particularly her hair color, which had gone from bright blonde to dark brunette.\n\n “I'm not gonna lie, I first saw you, when I got out of that car, I started thinking about going back [to prison],” Todd quipped. “But then I thought, let me embrace this.\"\n\n He explained further: “I mean it was a rough moment. It was a rough moment because I'd never seen you dark in my life. Julie, 30 years, I've never seen you with dark hair.”\n\n Julie also admitted to being “nervous” to see her husband after more than two years apart.\n\n “I was a little nervous,” Julie said in an interview with ABC News Studios that aired on Good Morning America in June. “Just because, you know, you think, ‘Oh my gosh, I’ve been away this long.’ But then, when I saw him, it was as if no time had passed.”\n\n Todd and Julie addressed divorce rumors following their presidential pardon \n\n Following their release from prison, Todd and Julie spoke about the state of their marriage in a July episode of Savannah’s podcast Unlocked. During the podcast appearance, the couple were asked about rumors they were breaking up since receiving their pardons from President Trump.\n\n “No. No. Let me set the record straight,” Julie insisted. “We are not getting divorced. I actually think that we settled back in fairly easy.”\n\n Despite spending more than two years apart with little to no contact while they were held in separate federal prisons, Todd revealed he never felt “away” from his wife of nearly 30 years.\n\n “In my mind, I was never away from her,” the Chrisley family patriarch explained. “I would tell her in the emails every day, I said, ‘I'm with you every step you take.’ And I’d say, ‘And feel my love surrounding you at all times.’ So when I went to bed at night, she was right there with me. When I woke up and I did my prayers, she was right there with me. And that's how I survived it.”\n\n That mindset “allowed us to really just come back together,” Julie added.\n\n Todd and Julie are returning to reality television following their release from prison \n\n Though their three reality television series — Chrisley Knows Best, Growing Up Chrisley and Love Limo — were all canceled in the wake of their sentencing, the Chrisleys are returning to reality television in September 2025.\n\n The Chrisley family revealed in August 2023 that a new reality series was in the works. The untitled project was officially greenlit by Lifetime in May 2025, just days before Todd and Julie were granted a presidential pardon.\n\n The new series, titled The Chrisleys: Back to Reality, promises to expose “the raw truth of their lives — past and present.” It will follow the famous family — including Todd and Julie, Chase, Savannah, Grayson, Chloe and Nanny Faye — navigating their new normal as the couple “are eventually pardoned, released from prison and return home.” The series also \"shows a side of the Chrisleys that has never been seen before with exclusive access to the family,” including Julie's parents, Harvey and Pam, appearing on-screen for the first time.\n\n The Chrisleys: Back to Reality premieres in a two-night event on Sept. 1 and Sept. 2 at 8 p.m. ET on Lifetime, with a finale airing on Sept. 16.\n\n In addition to their upcoming reality television series, the Chrisleys sat down for an interview with ABC News Studios that aired on Good Morning America in June. In the conversation, Todd opened up about his and Julie’s plans for the future, including where they hope to relocate.\n\n “You know, I think we will always have a presence in Nashville, but I have a pull for Julie and I to go back to South Carolina — to Charleston — to that area. And we have plans for what we wanna do,” Todd revealed.\n\n He continued, “We have hopes of acquiring a hotel — a mansion — there, that we are gonna convert into a hotel, and we’re gonna create a show around that.”","summary":"Todd Chrisley and Julie Chrisley’s latest reality show, 'The Chrisleys: Back to Reality,' premieres on Sept. 1","url":"https://people.com/all-about-todd-chrisley-julie-chrisley-marriage-11798784","image":"https://people.com/thmb/l8KcvQoUFOwy-jjRhPUzPvgsGfQ=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(759x160:761x162)/trump-pardons-todd-chrisley-julia-chrisley-052925-56e36298890a49c2ba21e9670528bd7a.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-09-01 22:00:00","author":"Lynsey Eidell","authors":["Lynsey Eidell"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.099},{"id":356510200,"title":"Maduro claims US seeks 'regime change through military threat' amid Caribbean buildup","text":"Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro on Monday accused the United States of seeking a regime change in his country amid a naval buildup in the Caribbean.

Ushakov downplayed the possibility of a meeting between Putin and Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy, which was teased by Trump after he met the two leaders last month.\n\n\"Everyone is talking about a trilateral meeting, (or) about a meeting between Putin and Zelenskyy … But, as far as I know, there was no specific agreement between Putin and Trump about this,\" Ushakov told Russian state media journalist Pavel Zarubin on Monday.\n\nUkraine war looms over summit\n\nChina has emerged as a key pillar of diplomatic and economic support for Putin's regime since the early days of the Ukraine invasion, even as it claims neutrality in the conflict.\n\nChinese firms have bought up swaths of discounted Russian oil and provided it with critical trade, including dual use goods that Western leaders say have powered Russia's defence industrial base. Beijing defends its \"normal trade\" with Russia.\n\nTrump earlier this year threatened to take aim at that partnership, saying China could face major tariffs on its goods if it continued to purchase fuel from Russia as it wages war.\n\nBut even as the US imposed such penalties on India last week, it has so far slow-rolled that threat as it seeks a broader trade agreement with Beijing.\n\nTrump's whopping 50 per cent tariff on India has soured ties with Modi – and accelerated a nascent and cautious rapprochement between New Delhi and Beijing.\n\nModi and Putin also held a nearly hour-long private meeting in the Russian presidential limousine, the Aurus, while en route to their formal talks, according to Russian state media.\n\n\"India and Russia have always stood shoulder to shoulder even in the most difficult times,\" Modi said at the start of the meeting. \"We have been in constant dialogue on the situation in Ukraine. We welcome all the recent efforts for peace.\"\n\nObservers say that Xi sees the gathering – and a massive military parade that he'll host on Wednesday in Beijing, expected to be attended by Putin, North Korea's Kim Jong Un as well as some two dozen other leaders – as a critically timed diplomatic push.\n\nChinese officials touted this year's SCO as the largest yet, saying ahead of the event that 20 leaders from across Asia and the Middle East would join. In addition to Russia, China and India, SCO members include Iran, Pakistan, Belarus, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, and Uzbekistan.\n\nDOWNLOAD THE 9NEWS APP: Stay across all the latest in breaking news, sport, politics and the weather via our news app and get notifications sent straight to your smartphone.
