Apparently, it never occurred to him that Americans would be appalled at:\n\n1. Masked ICE agents snatching their neighbors off the streets, many of whom were arrested because of the color of their skin. Some even turned out to be U.S. citizens.\n\n2. Hiring an antivaxxer and science denier, Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., to be in charge of the nation’s health.\n\n3. Targeting his political opponents by bringing frivolous, made-up charges.\n\n4. Starting a trade war with our friends, such as Canada and Mexico. He just raised Canadian tariffs simply because they played a Ronald Reagan commercial disparaging tariffs during the World Series.\n\n5. Sending the National Guard into cities in Democratic-run states on the pretext of crime preventionand against the will of the governors.\n\n6. Cutting back Medicare and Medicaid benefits to give huge tax cuts to his billionaire donors.\n\nArthur Straus\nWalnut Creek\n\nThe truth about\ndemocratic socialism\n\nRe: “Democrat Zohran Mamdani elected New York City mayor” (Page A3, Nov. 5).\n\nMany Americans don’t understand the difference between communists, socialists, and democratic socialists. Democratic socialists believe in a market-based capitalist economy run to benefit the majority, not the few. They advocate for a robust social safety net, government control over essential services like health care and policies to reduce economic inequality, such as higher taxes on the wealthy and corporations. They want universal health care, free higher education and to strengthen labor unions.\n\nWhile communism and some forms of socialism involve state control of everything, democratic socialism works within existing democratic structures to achieve its goals. It is opposed to the authoritarian communism of Russia and China.\n\nMany also worry that democratic socialism will slide into full-fledged socialism or some form of communism. That ignores long-established and respected Social Democratic Parties in Europe — the Labour Party in the UK and the Socialist Party in France, as well as left-of-center parties throughout Scandinavia.\n\nJim Wolpman\nWalnut Creek\n\nRestoring SNAP would\nbe best thing for Trump\n\nRe: “Congress must cement health care, food aid” and “Trump administration must prop up SNAP” (Page A6, Nov. 6).\n\nThank you, Jim Driggers and Ricardo Narvaez, for your recent letters advocating for SNAP, the government program providing food for needy children and families.\n\nObviously, Mr. Trump has never had to go without food due to a lack of money, so he cannot understand the meaning of hunger. Well, Mr. Trump, there are many people without the means to buy food who have used SNAP to feed their families. Do you really want to be seen as the wealthy leader responsible for starving American children?\n\nRestore SNAP.\n\nTari Nicholson\n\nFederal rules against\ngerrymandering needed\n\nMy party just put another nail in the coffin of democracy in California with Proposition 50.\n\nEven in high school, we learned that gerrymandering was undemocratic and unacceptable. It needs a non-political federal implementation of standard rules for all states. States’ rights are an issue, but these are elected federal positions and cannot be left up to the local political bias of states. It beats rolling in the mud with the rest of the country.\n\nIn the future, the California Democratic Party’s claim to defend democracy and protect all minorities (Republicans) will ring hollow.\n\nJames Roesler\n\nProgressive tide rolls\nin with election\n\nThe political tide has changed in America.\n\nZohran Mamdani’s emphatic victory over Andrew Cuomo shows that New Yorkers support progressive, for-the-people policies, over for-the-rich favoritism.\n\nDemocratic wins around the country — Virginia and New Jersey governors, races in Pennsylvania, Georgia and Virginia again, and Proposition 50 here, are all blows to Donald Trump’s nasty, erratic divisiveness.\n\nYet, the Democratic Party leadership resists progressive policies because they fear losing corporate campaign funds and are satisfied with the status quo. Chuck Schumer didn’t endorse Mamdani. Hakeem Jeffries only did so, and Barack Obama only called him at the last minute, after the outcome was clear.\n\nHad Kamala Harris supported progressive policies rather than spouting limp anti-Trump rhetoric, she would have won.\n\nThe only way for Democrats to win back power is to prioritize ordinary people’s needs, tax the shamefully rich and give first-time and younger voters reasons to support Democrats. It’s common sense.\n\nKeith Nakatani\n\nGaza tragedy must\nnever happen again\n\nRe: “It’s time to face the enormity of Gaza’s loss” (Page A13, Oct. 26).\n\nI can only imagine returning to the devastation that once was home in Gaza. Consider the whole Bay Area reduced to powder: Grace Cathedral, 680, Golden Gate Park — no more. Schools and hospitals — piles of concrete and rebar. No clean or running water, not even any pipes or treatment facilities. No toilets; no sewers. No food. Your home is now contaminated rubble. Can you even find the lot? Your pets?\n\nHow do you rebuild centuries of history, beauty, life and culture that have all been bombed to dust? Bring back whole families blasted out of existence? Help so many WCNSFs (Wounded Child No Surviving Family)? This, while Israel continues its bombing, torture, starvation, detention and land theft of innocent Palestinians.\n\nWe must find a way to reclaim the vibrancy and history of Palestine and ensure that “never again” will such obliteration be funded with our money and support.\n\nElizabeth Fisher\nPleasant Hill","summary":"Also: Democratic socialism &#124; The best thing &#124; Federal rules &#124; Progressive tide &#124; Gaza tragedy.

The administration then swiftly appealed to the nation’s high court.\n\nOn Thursday, a federal judge gave the administration 24 hours to fully fund SNAP and the Department of Agriculture said Friday afternoon that it will immediately begin funding the program while the legal challenge plays out.\n\nDistrict Judge John McConnell had ordered the administration to deliver full payments to states by Friday after finding that the government failed to address any administrative issues that prevented states from quickly sending out at least partial benefits to nearly 42 million Americans who rely on the program to keep from going hungry.\n\nBut the Trump administration then filed an emergency request with a federal appeals court to freeze the judge’s order and block the courts from requiring the government to spend more money that goes beyond what’s left in a contingency fund to pay out partial benefits for the month.\n\nAt the same time, a memo from the USDA said the agency “will complete the processes necessary” to ensure that SNAP benefits, also known as food stamps, are delivered to the states.\n\nSNAP funds, which are distributed by the federal government to states each month, support the nation’s largest anti-hunger program. Roughly one in eight families receive an average of $188 per person per month, or about $6 per day, which is administered on prepaid cards that can be used to pay for groceries.\n\nFood pantries across the country are warning that they are not prepared to support the millions of families that rely on government assistance.\n\nOfficials in several states — including California, Kansas, New Jersey, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin — said SNAP recipients were beginning to receive monthly benefits by Friday afternoon. “Food benefits are now beginning to flow back to California families,” said California Governor Gavin Newsom, whose state has roughly 5.5 million SNAP recipients.\n\nNew York Governor Kathy Hochul, whose state has roughly 3 million SNAP recipients, directed state agencies to “fully fund” federal benefits for November.\n\n“President Trump's actions have been senseless and un-American. I'll never stop fighting for New York's families,” she said.\n\nBefore two federal judges intervened, the administration intended to freeze funding for the program entirely during the government shutdown, claiming that it did not have legal authority to tap into billions of dollars in emergency funds. On a notice on its website last month, USDA claimed that the “well has run dry” and that “there will be no benefits issued November 1.”\n\nThe administration then agreed to tap into $4.65 billion in contingency funds to cover roughly 65 percent of benefits. The USDA said those partial payments were sent to states on Monday but officials wrote in court documents that it would “take anywhere from a few weeks to up to several months” for those recipients to start seeing those benefits.\n\nIn his ruling on Thursday, District Judge Jack McConnell said the administration failed to “expeditiously resolve” any clerical issues that could delay those payments, which he ordered last week.\n\nAs a result, “people will go hungry, food pantries will be overburdened and needless suffering will occur,” with SNAP funding lapsing for the first time in the nation’s history, the judge said during a virtual court hearing Thursday.\n\n“People have gone without for too long. Not making payments to them for even another day is simply unacceptable,” McConnell said. “This should never happen in America.”","summary":"The USDA says funding is already going to states while the government wages a legal battle to freeze it","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/trump-snap-food-stamp-payments-appeals-court-b2861189.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/11/07/22/16/Government-Shutdown-Food-Bank-lxpwubf1.jpeg?crop=5883,3922,x0.5,y0&trim=0,1,0,0&width=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/FyzYYGMM-OhrQWqOm.mp4","publish_date":"2025-11-08 00:24:01","author":"Alex Woodward","authors":["Alex Woodward"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.394},{"id":376891824,"title":"Elise Stefanik can win in New York — if the GOP suits up and seizes on Democrats’ divisions","text":"Zohran Mamdani, a proud member of the Democratic Socialists of America, won more than 50% of the vote Tuesday in the highest-turnout mayoral race in over half a century.\n\nThis was no sleepy off-year fluke, but a record-breaking mobilization — and voters chose Democratic Socialism over everything else on the menu.\n\nHere’s the kicker: Mamdani didn’t beat a Republican.\n\nHe beat his own party — crushing the Democratic establishment in a civil war over capitalism, antisemitism and what’s left of the city’s liberal center.\n\nIn the process, Mamdani redefined the Democratic Party as openly socialist, pro-criminal and decidedly anti-Israel, leaving the once-powerful centrist wing in tatters.\n\nNow, every mainstream Democrat in New York should be sweating — and every Republican should be suiting up.\n\nThis is how the GOP has always won in this state: By seizing the moment when Democrats self-destruct and voters desperately seek sanity.\n\nRudy Giuliani ran on crime; George Pataki on Cuomo fatigue; Mike Bloomberg after 9/11 chaos.\n\nNot master plans — opportunities seized.\n\nIn 2025, with Democrats at war over Israel, socialism and whether the party still had room for moderates, Republicans weren’t positioned to exploit their chance.\n\nMany rank-and-file voters stood by Curtis Sliwa, but President Donald Trump and much of the business community never believed the nominee could win, and stopping the socialist trumped party loyalty.\n\nTrump gave Republicans permission to abandon their own party — and many did. \n\nGOP votes for mayor hit their lowest since 1977.\n\nIn doing so, Andrew Cuomo became the de facto Republican candidate.\n\nAnd viewed that way, Tuesday was a partial success: The right reframed NYC politics around one powerful idea — stopping socialism.\n\nThe coalition that emerged to block the far left forms the foundation of a comeback.\n\nAnd good news: Republicans get a second shot in 12 months.\n\nGov. Kathy Hochul is historically weak — tolerated, not loved, by her own party.\n\nShe governs by default, reads polls like horoscopes, and projects all the charisma of a DMV clerk.\n\nHer coalition is splintering. \n\nThe DSA just took the city and they’re marching on Albany.\n\nEnter Elise Stefanik, a North Country congresswoman who’s disciplined, battle-tested and sharp enough to beat Hochul, with national reach and Upstate roots.\n\nBut she needs a full machine behind her — not just money, but message, ground game and discipline.\n\nTo help her win, Republicans need more than luck. They need a plan.\n\nNew York is brutal territory — 11% GOP registration in the city, 23% statewide — but there’s a real opportunity to offer voters a better path to getting the state back on track.\n\nThe GOP can’t wait for another perfect storm; it has to build one.\n\nFirst, start with a simple, coherent message.\n\nMamdani ran a brilliantly disciplined campaign, giving voters something they could grab on to.\n\nThey had no idea how he would pay for free buses and government grocery stores, but everyone could recite his top priorities.\n\nRepublicans, too, must articulate an easily digestible platform that cuts across party lines.\n\nThe coming race should be about energy prices in Buffalo, housing costs on Long Island and subway crime in Queens.\n\nSecond, engage the same leaders and community groups who stood up to Mamdani’s agenda. \n\nThey’ve already shown they’ll fight back.\n\nMake them partners in a shared mission to save the state from ideological extremism.\n\nThird, use the campaign financing program to seed new Republican candidates — especially in districts long abandoned by the party.\n\nMatching funds aren’t a progressive perk. Build a farm team of credible, relatable voices who reflect their districts and can actually win.\n\nFourth, reach out to New Yorkers who know what socialism looks like because they’ve lived through it.\n\nFrom Cuban and Venezuelan exiles to Eastern Europeans and Chinese immigrants, millions fled the very systems Mamdani romanticizes.\n\nThey don’t need a lecture — they need a microphone. Make them the face and voice of this movement.\n\nFifth, go deep and wide into New York’s Jewish community.\n\nNo group felt this election’s fallout more acutely. They saw the mainstreaming of antisemitism and the moral rot that allowed it to flourish.\n\nThat offers Republicans a unique chance to expand their coalition with conviction, not calculation.\n\nSixth, build a real year-round voter operation, not a seasonal scramble.\n\nThe 854,000 New Yorkers who voted for Cuomo to stop Mamdani have proven they’ll cross party lines to counter the far left. Bring them home and reinvigorate the GOP.\n\nFinally, invest in cultivating nontraditional media — ethnic media, podcasts, local influencers and neighborhood press. \n\nThat’s where swing voters actually live and listen.\n\nKeep the message simple and relentless: New York can’t afford socialism.\n\nEvery so often, Democrats lose their minds, voters hit their breaking point, and the door cracks open.\n\nIn 2025, the person who walked through was a socialist.\n\nIn 2026, it better be a Republican.\n\nBecause New York doesn’t just need an opposition party. It needs a comeback story.\n\nDavid Catalfamo, president of Capital Public Strategies, was the political director of Gov. George Pataki’s 1994 campaign.","summary":"Zohran Mamdani splintered his party.

It makes it difficult to plan. These are people who, to survive, spend a lot of time planning how they are going to spend what they have.”\n\nThe Greater Chicago Food Depository also heard from its partners that recipients started to receive partial benefits, but they along with many others were still waiting to see if the White House would fully fund the program for November.\n\nLate Friday afternoon, President Donald Trump’s administration continued its challenge of a court order that required it to fully, rather than partially, fund SNAP benefits. An appeals court late Friday left in place that order to fully fund SNAP in November, for now. After the appeals decision, the Trump administration quickly asked the U.S. Supreme Court to take up its request, the Associated Press reported.\n\nIllinois Attorney General Kwame Raoul filed a brief, along with a coalition of states, opposing Trump’s attempts not to fully fund the food assistance program for November during the government shutdown, the longest in U.S. history.\n\n“A federal judge ordered the Trump administration to provide full SNAP benefits, but still the president is continuing down a path of cruelty that will unlawfully impede tens of millions of families across the country from accessing the food they deserve,” Raoul said in a statement. \n\nThe Illinois Department of Human Services, which administers SNAP, said at most, households across the state will receive 65% of their normal monthly benefits, but some may not receive anything at all.\n\nRecipients who typically receive food assistance in the first six days of the month should have started receiving the payments Friday or will receive it in the next few days, according to state officials. People who typically have their cards loaded after the seventh day of the month should receive a partial payment on their regular day.\n\nNearly 2 million people in Illinois receive SNAP benefits each month. Typically, a family of three cannot have a gross monthly income of more than $3,551 to receive SNAP assistance. The average monthly benefit is about $370.\n\nIn Chicago, most SNAP recipients live on the West Side, including the Austin, North Lawndale, East Garfield Park and West Garfield Park neighborhoods, according to U.S. Census data analyzed by WBEZ and the Sun-Times.\n\nSince last week, the Marillac St. Vincent Harvest Hub has seen more people visiting the food pantry.

The First Amendment stands in their way.”\n\nHis order permanently blocks the Education Department from touching workers’ email accounts to send out similar partisan messages.\n\nThe ruling, which applies only to Education Department employees, follows complaints from government watchdogs and furloughed workers from several agencies who were surprised to learn their email accounts were automatically replying to messages with language that echoed the president’s.\n\n“[I’m] so pissed … We as career government employees need to be neutral when carrying out our jobs,” one Education Department employee told ABC News last month. “This is such bull****.”\n\nThe Trump administration’s use of government resources to spread its messaging “was an unprecedented violation of the First Amendment, and the court’s ruling makes clear that even this administration is not above the law,” according to Everett Kelley, president of American Federation of Government Employees, nation’s largest federal worker union, which sued the administration over the messages.\n\nThe emails stated that the workers were on “furlough status” because “unfortunately, Democrat Senators are blocking passage” of a temporary funding bill that “has led to a lapse in appropriations.”\n\n“The employee you have contacted will respond to emails once government functions resume,” the emails said.\n\nThat language was also echoed on banners and pop-up messages on the websites of the Department of Justice, State Department, the Food and Drug Administration, Department of Agriculture, Department of Housing and Urban Development and the Small Business Administration, among others.\n\nWatchdog groups argue that the statements defy ethics laws that prohibit political attacks and campaigning from inside federal facilities — which Trump and administration officials have continued to do since entering office without facing any consequences.\n\nThe White House has previously argued that officials from Barack Obama and Joe Biden administrations “repeatedly assigned partisan blame on Republicans in official fact sheets, press releases and statements.”\n\nHundreds of thousands of federal employees have been furloughed since the government shutdown started October 1, marking the longest-ever shutdown in U.S. history.\n\nEssential federal workers, including air traffic controllers and aviation employees, are required to show up to work without pay during the funding lapse.

We need Republicans to just say yes,” Schumer said.\n\nJohn Thune, the Senate majority leader, was unmoved by the offer, with his spokesperson Ryan Wrasse reiterating the demand that the government be reopened before the tax credit issue will be discussed.\n\n“Extending the Covid bonuses *is* the negotiation – something that can only take place after the government reopens. Release the hostage. End the pain,” Wrasse said.\n\nSenate Republicans were more blunt on X: “Hard no, Chuck.”\n\nThune has moved to keep the Senate in session this weekend, though a deal to end the shutdown remains elusive.\n\nAny compromise would also need to be approved by the House of Representatives, which Republican speaker Mike Johnson has kept on recess since 19 September. That means the 38-day shutdown would not end immediately.\n\nDemocrats made the offer as Americans faced unprecedented disruptions blamed by Donald Trump on the funding lapse, which began on 1 October.\n\nThe Trump administration has attempted to pause payments under the government’s food aid program for the first time in history, but has been blocked by a court order. The Federal Aviation Administration also slashed commercial air travel, saying weeks of unpaid work by controllers had undermined capacity. About 800 US-linked flights had been canceled as of Friday morning, according to the tracking website FlightAware.\n\nThough Republicans control both chambers of Congress, any spending legislation needs at least some bipartisan support to clear the 60-vote threshold for advancement in the Senate. The Senate majority leader, John Thune, has tried 14 times to get Democrats to support a House-approved bill to continue funding through 21 November, butonly three minority lawmakers voted for it.\n\nDemocrats had for weeks insisted that any funding bill include an extension of the tax credits, which were created during Joe Biden’s presidency and will expire at the end of the year. People on ACA plans are expected to soon see their costs jump by an average of 26%, the Kaiser Family Foundation found.\n\nKevin Hassett, director of the National Economic Council, told reporters at the White House that he expected the shutdown to cut GDP growth by approximately half in the current quarter, though much of that will be made up in the following quarter, assuming the shutdown ends and federal workers receive backpay.\n\nTrump has publicly mulled not giving federal workers, many of whom his administration has maligned, pay for the time the government was shut down.\n\nLater on Friday, Senate Democrats blocked a procedural motion to advance a Republican bill that sought to pay some of the federal workers who had stayed on the job without pay during the shutdown and active-duty troops. The 53-43 tally, which was mostly along party lines, fell well below the 60 vote threshold needed for passage.\n\nDemocrats said they were concerned the legislation would allow Trump to selectively choose which federal workers received pay.\n\nDemocrats’ resolve to hold strong against the Republican funding proposal was boosted on Tuesday when the party’s candidates swept off-year elections in a number of states, which party leaders attributed to voters being on board with their demands.\n\n“Americans plagued by high costs fired a political torpedo this week at Donald Trump and Republicans,”Schumer, said on Thursday.\n\n“If Republicans were smart, they would get the message after Tuesday that their do-nothing strategy isn’t working. Even Donald Trump knows Americans hold Republicans responsible for this mess.”\n\nRecent polls have shown the GOP taking more of the blame for the shutdown than Democrats, and some in the party have warned that backing down from their demands now would turn off newly reenergized voters.\n\n“I think there will be some pretty substantial damage done to a Democratic brand that has been rehabilitated, if, on the heels of an election in which the people told us to keep fighting, we immediately stop fighting, if we surrender without having gotten anything,” the Democratic senator Chris Murphy told Punchbowl News.\n\nTrump appeared to acknowledge that dynamic, telling senators from his party on Wednesday that the shutdown was “negative for Republicans”.\n\nHe has called for them to vote for scrapping the Senate’s filibuster, which allows the minority party to hold up most legislation that does not receive 60 votes. “If Republicans kill the Filibuster, they sail to Victory for many years to come.

Millions of Americans are struggling to provide food for themselves and their families. Forty-one million Americans rely on SNAP benefits to provide or supplement their nutritional needs, and removing these benefits is cruel and unethical.\n\nWhile it is important to restore SNAP benefits, I think that it is also worth bringing up that 30%-40% of the food supply goes to waste. I think that funding infrastructure that would reduce the amount of food waste and get it onto the tables of those who need it would be beneficial for everyone.\n\nThe United States is a very rich country.

He has cut nearly $1 trillion over nine years from Medicaid, which is the largest single source of addiction treatment funding. He has cut funds and proposed future budget cuts of billions more, which affect programs that provide services such as naloxone distribution, overdose prevention and public health surveillance.\n\nHe just wanted a slush fund of tariffs so that he could use it to reward his rich and powerful billionaire friends and hurt the small businesses and the working poor.\n\nElection struck a\nblow for the truth\n\nTo me, the overriding political issues in the recent election were the deceitfulness, incompetence and unpredictability of our president. That was, is and will continue to be the case as long as Trumpism muddies the scene.\n\nThis election was evidence of the strength of democracy: The people oppose oppression when truth prevails. I have the same faith in our elections as thewise thinker, who stated, “You can fool some of the people all of the time and all of the people some of the time, but you cannot fool all of the people all of the time.”\n\nThe truth is not changed by deceitful politicians nor by deep-seated party affiliations. It is hidden sometimes by blind compliance, dishonest leadership and groupthink, but it is always there. I have therefore to believe that the human desire for truth, human rights and freedom from oppression will ultimately prevail.\n\nJerry Meyer\n\nUS needs framework\nfor AI and education\n\nAcross America, two forces are shaping the next generation: the rapid rise of AI and the daily work of education. The challenge is not choosing between them but bringing them together.\n\nAI drives innovation and prosperity, but education develops empathy, discernment and judgment. Both aim to expand human potential. AI creates possibilities, and education gives it purpose.\n\nThat shared mission should define the next chapter of America’s progress. We need a framework in which builders of AI and stewards of learning work side by side. AI companies should embed educators in product design, schools should teach AI literacy and ethics; and regulators should focus on transparency, privacy and age-appropriate design.

But experts said it's unlikely that an investigation would result in lower prices at grocery stores, and a trade group representing meat packers said they're not to blame.\n\nTrump did not present evidence for his claims, writing on social media that “I have asked the DOJ to immediately begin an investigation into the Meat Packing Companies who are driving up the price of Beef through Illicit Collusion, Price Fixing, and Price Manipulation.”\n\nHe said he was taking the action to help ranchers, who were recently angered by his suggestion that the U.S. would buy Argentine beef to bring down stubbornly high prices for American consumers.\n\n“We will always protect our American Ranchers, and they are being blamed for what is being done by Majority Foreign Owned Meat Packers, who artificially inflate prices, and jeopardize the security of our Nation’s food supply,” Trump said.\n\n Why beef prices have climbed \n\nBeef prices have soared to record levels in part after drought and years of low prices led to the smallest U.S. herd size in decades. Trump’s tariffs on Brazil, a major beef exporter, have also curbed imports.\n\nMeanwhile, demand for beef remains strong. Prices are high because consumers want to eat it, and they’re willing and able to pay for it, said Glynn Tonsor, who leads the Meat Demand Monitor at Kansas State University.\n\nTonsor said the ownership mix in the meat packing industry has not changed significantly in the past four years.\n\nConcentration in the meat packing business has been a longtime concern for farmers and politicians on both sides of the aisle. Four major meatpacking companies dominate the beef market in the United States.\n\nThere’s no evidence to back up claims that the big packers have undue market power and use it to drive up beef prices, said Derrell Peel, an agricultural economist at Oklahoma State University.\n\n“The packing industry in this country has been investigated and researched for 50 years, and it’s been an issue for over a hundred years, at least, for some producers,” Peel said, expressing skepticism that consumers or producers will benefit from the investigation Trump announced.\n\n“If the outcome is to break up the big packers, the outcome will be higher beef prices for consumers, and lower cattle prices for producers,” Peel said.\n\n Meat packers say they're getting pinched by high prices \n\nOklahoma Sen. Markwayne Mullin said he and his fellow Republican senators Cindy-Hyde-Smith of Mississippi and Tim Sheehy of Montana visited the White House to speak with Trump about recent volatility in the beef market. Mullin said Trump agreed to have the Justice Department look at the issue.\n\nMullin blamed meat processors, saying that “we’re seeing the same exact game play again out” as a 2019 lawsuit against large meatpackers for violating antitrust laws.\n\nJBS, which is based in Brazil, is the largest U.S. beef producer and its second-largest producer of poultry and pork. Half of its annual revenue comes from the U.S., where it has more than 72,000 employees.\n\nThe company has faced price-fixing charges before. In 2022, JBS agreed to a $52.5 million settlement with grocery stores and wholesalers who accused JBS, Arkansas-based Tyson Foods and other companies of working together to suppress the number of cattle being slaughtered in order to drive up beef prices. \n\nJBS did not admit wrongdoing as part of that settlement. Messages seeking comment were left Friday with JBS USA.\n\nThe Meat Institute, a trade group that represents JBS and other meat producers, said its industry is being pinched by the price of cattle, despite record prices for U.S. beef.\n\n“For more than a year, beef packers have been operating at a loss due to a tight cattle supply and strong demand,” Meat Institute President and CEO Julie Anna Potts said in a statement. “The beef industry is heavily regulated, and market transactions are transparent. The government’s own data from USDA confirms that the beef packing sector is experiencing catastrophic losses and experts predict this will continue into 2026.”\n\nTrump’s accusations have renewed a bipartisan presidential fight against rising food prices.\n\nThen-President Joe Biden talked with independent farmers and ranchers about initiatives to reduce food prices by increasing competition within the meat industry. And then-Vice President Kamala Harris, who Trump defeated in winning reelection last year, used her campaign to vow to crack down on food producers and major supermarkets’ “ price gouging.”\n\nKarnowski reported from Minneapolis.

But the administration asked the appeals court to suspend any court orders requiring it to spend more money than is available in a contingency fund, and instead allow it to continue with planned partial SNAP payments for the month.The food program serves about 1 in 8 Americans, mostly with lower incomes.The court filing came even as the U.S. Department of Agriculture said in a memo to states that it’s working to make funds available Friday for full monthly SNAP benefits.Officials in at least a half-dozen states confirmed that some SNAP recipients already were issued full November payments on Friday.“Food benefits are now beginning to flow back to California families,” Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom said in a statement.In Wisconsin, more than $104 million of monthly food benefits became available at midnight on electronic cards for about 337,000 households, a spokesperson for Democratic Gov. Tony Evers said. The state was able to access the federal money so quickly by submitting a request to its electronic benefit card vendor to process the SNAP payments within hours of a Thursday court order to provide full benefits.Oregon Gov. Tina Kotek, a Democrat, said state employees “worked through the night” to issue full November benefits “to make sure every Oregon family relying on SNAP could buy groceries” by Friday.Officials in Kansas, New Jersey and Pennsylvania also said they moved quickly to issue full SNAP benefits Friday, while other states said they expected full benefits to arrive over the weekend or early next week. Still others said they were waiting for further federal guidance.The court wrangling prolonged weeks of uncertainty for Americans with lower incomes.An individual can receive a monthly maximum food benefit of nearly $300 and a family of four up to nearly $1,000, although many receive less than that under a formula that takes into consideration their income.For some SNAP participants, it remained unclear when they would receive their benefits.Jasmen Youngbey of Newark, New Jersey, waited in line Friday at a food pantry in the state’s largest city. As a single mom attending college, Youngbey said she relies on SNAP to help feed her 7-month-old and 4-year-old sons. But she said her account balance was at $0.“Not everybody has cash to pull out and say, ‘OK, I’m going to go and get this,’ especially with the cost of food right now,” she said.Later Friday, Youngbey said, she received her monthly SNAP benefits.Tihinna Franklin, a school bus guard who was waiting in the same line outside the United Community Corporation food pantry, said her SNAP account balance was at 9 cents and she was down to three items in her freezer. She typically relies on the roughly $290 a month in SNAP benefits to help feed her grandchildren.“If I don’t get it, I won’t be eating,” she said. “My money I get paid for, that goes to the bills, rent, electricity, personal items. That is not fair to us as mothers and caregivers.”Franklin said later Friday that she had received at least some of her normal SNAP benefits.Because of the federal government shutdown, the Trump administration originally had said SNAP benefits would not be available in November. However, two judges ruled last week that the administration could not skip November’s benefits entirely because of the shutdown. One of those judges was U.S. District Judge John J. McConnell Jr., who ordered the full payments Thursday.In both cases, the judges ordered the government to use one emergency reserve fund containing more than $4.6 billion to pay for SNAP for November but gave it leeway to tap other money to make the full payments, which cost between $8.5 billion and $9 billion each month.On Monday, the administration said it would not use additional money, saying it was up to Congress to appropriate the funds for the program and that the other money was needed to shore up other child hunger programs.Thursday’s federal court order rejected the Trump administration’s decision to cover only 65% of the maximum monthly benefit, a decision that could have left some recipients getting nothing for this month.In its court filing Friday, Trump’s administration contended that Thursday’s directive to fund full SNAP benefits runs afoul of the U.S. Constitution.“This unprecedented injunction makes a mockery of the separation of powers. Courts hold neither the power to appropriate nor the power to spend,” the U.S. Department of Justice wrote in its request to the court.In response, attorneys for the cities and nonprofits challenging Trump's administration said the government has plenty of available money and the court should \"not allow them to further delay getting vital food assistance to individuals and families who need it now.”Some states said they stood ready to distribute SNAP money as quickly as possible.Massachusetts said SNAP recipients should receive their full November payments as soon as Saturday. New York said access to full SNAP benefits should begin by Sunday. New Hampshire said full benefits should be available by this weekend. And Connecticut said full benefits should be accessible in the next several days.Officials in North Carolina said they distributed partial SNAP payments Friday and full benefits could be available by this weekend. Officials in Illinois, Kentucky, Louisiana and North Dakota also said they distributed partial November payments.Amid the federal uncertainty, Delaware's Democratic Gov. Matt Meyer said the state used its own funds Friday to provide the first of what could be a weekly relief payment to SNAP recipients.","summary":"A federal appeals court orders the Trump administration to provide full SNAP benefits, with states like California, Wisconsin, and Oregon issuing payments.","url":"https://www.republicworld.com/world-news/us-court-orders-trump-administration-to-provide-full-snap-benefits-amid-shutdown","image":"https://img.republicworld.com/all_images/us-court-orders-trump-administration-to-provide-full-snap-benefits-amid-shutdown-1762559681969-16_9.webp","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-11-07 23:54:47","author":"Associated Press Television News","authors":["Associated Press Television News"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"in","sentiment":-0.279},{"id":376891812,"title":"Turns out the BBC is now a pro-Hamas, anti-Trump propaganda machine","text":"Wow: The BBC just got outed as such a purveyor of straight-up propaganda that it mashed up clips of President Donald Trump speaking on Jan. 6, 2021 to make it sound like he encouraged the crowds to storm the Capitol and “fight.”\n\nThis wasn’t simply cutting out a couple of “ums” or filler words for the sake of clarity.\n\nNo, the revered “Beeb” took two sections of Trump’s speech that were separated by 54 minutes and spliced them together to make him sound as unhinged as possible.\n\nThat’s Stalin-level journalistic ethics.\n\nThe BBC claims that its “Editorial Guidelines embody the wisdom of more than 100 years of program making, content production and journalism.”\n\nBut a leaked internal memo has exposed even more far-reaching bias at the venerable, publicly-owned British network.\n\nWritten by a former member of the BBC’s own standards committee, the memo reveals multiple cases in which the BBC knowingly reported Hamas propaganda as fact, such as reports that Israeli troops had murdered hundreds of bound civilians and buried them in mass graves at al-Shifa Hospital.\n\nIn reality, Palestinians buried those casualties before the Israeli troops arrived.\n\nThe BBC also went all-in promoting the famine hoax, apparently taking editorial direction from the notorious Hamas-affiliated Shehab Agency, offering debunked stories about mass starvation and the murder of civilian aid-seekers.\n\nThat’s not all: BBC Arabic was found to present the same news stories as the main channel, but with added pro-Hamas editorializing.\n\nWorse, BBC Arabic regularly platformed Hamas “journalists” who openly spouted antisemitic vitriol on-air, including saying Jews are subhuman and should all be burned to death.\n\nThe opposition in Parliament is demanding an investigation into the BBC’s standards and practices; seems to us like the next government should look at shutting the whole thing down.","summary":"The BBC just got outed as such a purveyor of straight-up propaganda that it mashed up clips of President Donald Trump speaking on Jan. 6, 2021 to make it sound like he encouraged the crowds to storm the Capitol and “fight.”","url":"https://nypost.com/2025/11/07/opinion/turns-out-the-bbc-is-now-a-pro-hamas-anti-trump-propaganda-machine/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/11/bbcuk.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-11-07 23:53:00","author":"Post Editorial Board","authors":["Post Editorial Board"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"zm","sentiment":-0.271},{"id":376895040,"title":"South Korean solar firm cuts pay and hours for Georgia workers as US officials detain imports","text":"A South Korean solar company says it will temporarily reduce pay and working hours for about 1,000 of its 3,000 employees in Georgia because U.S. customs officials have been detaining imported components needed to make solar panels.\n\nQcells, a unit of South Korea's Hanwha Solutions, said Friday that it will also lay off 300 workers from staffing agencies at its plants in Dalton and Cartersville, both northwest of Atlanta.\n\nThe company says U.S. Customs and Border Protection has been detaining imported components at ports on suspicion that they contain materials that may have been made with forced labor in China, meaning it can't run its solar panel assembly lines at full strength.\n\nHomeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem announced in August that her department was stepping up enforcement of the Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act, a 2021 law that restricts Chinese goods made with forced labor from entering the U.S. Published reports indicate that U.S. officials began detaining solar cells made by Qcells in June.

But then don’t penalize the person who is here on a valid status that you granted them and then not allow them to work because the administration is taking more time to do that vetting.”\n\nKalpana Peddibhotla, executive director of the San Jose-based South Asian American Justice Collaborative, said the change for now may affect only a “narrow set” of H-4 holders, but “processing times will likely go up.”\n\nPeddibhotla noted that H-4 holders have already gone through extensive security checks to be allowed into the U.S.\n\nVetting and screening will probably include checks for any criminal activity, and probing of applicant’s social media for sentiments viewed by the administration of President Donald Trump as “anti-American” under one of the president’s executive memoranda, Duehning said. She said she would not be surprised if that screening led to denials of work permits.\n\nThe additional investigation will probably add to processing times for H-4 work permits, Duehning said.\n\nCitizenship and Immigration did not immediately respond to questions about the screening and vetting.\n\nAbout 90,000 foreign citizens live in the U.S. under the H-4 visa, which is granted to wives and husbands of H-1B workers on track for a green card. The vast majority of H-4 holders are women from India. Since 2015, they’ve been allowed to work if their spouses on the H-1B — a visa heavily used by the Silicon Valley technology industry to obtain top talent along with lower-paid employees — are on track for a green card.\n\nLosing work authorization can cost a foreign worker their job, and make it harder to find other employment in the future, Peddibhotla said. Taking away automatic renewal also dissuades employers from offering jobs to H-4 holders out of concerns about potential employment gaps, Peddibhotla added.\n\nPeople on the H-4 have long faced uncertainty over their ability to take and keep jobs. Two months after they received the right to work under former President Barack Obama in 2015, a group of tech workers sued the federal government, claiming the employment authorization illegally and unfairly forced them to compete for jobs against non-citizens.\n\nWhile President Donald Trump was campaigning for his first term in the White House, he attacked the H-1B and claimed an “influx of foreign workers” was hurting working-class Americans. In the first year in office, his administration pledged to end the H-4 employment authorization, sparking a lobbying blitz by the tech industry, which highlighted companies’ reliance on H-1B workers and argued that allowing H-1B spouses to work was crucial for attracting and retaining foreign talent. The work ban never came.\n\nIn Trump’s second term, the H-1B shot to its highest-ever profile in America’s debate over immigration and foreign workers, after a right-wing conspiracy theorist attacked employment of Indian tech workers in the U.S. The ensuing vitriolic debate exposed a schism among Trump supporters, pitting advocates for the tech sector and Silicon Valley against anti-immigration hardliners.\n\nIn October, the U.S. Supreme Court declined to hear an appeal of the tech workers’ H-4 case, effectively ending it.\n\nDuehning recalled that processing backlogs for H-4 visas and work permits in 2019 and 2020 caused substantial upheaval in the Bay Area.\n\n“The impact is more prevalent here in the Bay Area because of the large volumes of H-4 holders that we have here, and also because of the cost of living,” Duehning said. “It is very difficult when you have only one working adult in the household. It really puts a lot of these families in a really bad spot.”\n\nIf H-4 work permit processing times increase past six months, Duehning said, “I think we will start seeing a lot of concern. It will really put a lot of families here in a position of ‘Hey, can we even afford to be here?'”","summary":"U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services said Friday that gaps in employment could result if visa holders don't file work permit applications in time, or if the agency can't process their applications before permits expire.","url":"https://www.mercurynews.com/2025/11/07/h1b-visa-spouses-h4-visa-new-threat/","image":"https://www.mercurynews.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/h1b-papers-ms_-071800.jpg?w=1600&resize=1600,900","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-11-07 23:44:07","author":"Ethan Baron","authors":["Ethan Baron"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.475},{"id":376893646,"title":"AU rejects Trump threat, urges dialogue with Nigeria","text":"The African Union Commission has reaffirmed its commitment to Nigeria’s sovereignty, religious freedom, and the rule of law in response to recent statements by the United States suggesting Nigerian complicity in attacks against Christians and threatening possible military action.\n\nThe commission emphasised the importance of diplomacy and constructive engagement over military threats.\n\nIn a press release issued on Friday via its official X account, the AUC underscored the need to respect Nigeria’s right to manage its internal affairs without external interference.\n\n“The Federal Republic of Nigeria is a longstanding and valued member state of the African Union, playing a key role in regional stability, counterterrorism, peacekeeping initiatives, and continental integration,” the statement read.\n\nThe commission stressed that any external engagement must uphold Nigeria’s sovereignty and territorial integrity.\n\n“The AUC fully respects Nigeria’s sovereign right to manage its internal affairs, including security, religious freedom, and human rights, in line with its constitution and international obligations,” it added.\n\nAddressing concerns about alleged religious persecution, the AUC reaffirmed Nigeria’s commitment to protecting freedom of belief.\n\n“The commission supports Nigeria’s repeated affirmation that its constitution guarantees freedom of religion and belief, and that the government rejects all forms of religious persecution,” the release stated.\n\nThe AU also acknowledged the complex security challenges facing Nigeria, including violent extremism, banditry, communal clashes, and resource-based conflicts.\n\n“Nigeria faces complex security challenges affecting citizens of all faiths,” the AUC noted, calling for regional and international cooperation to strengthen capacities to protect citizens and uphold human rights.\n\nCautioning against portraying Nigeria’s security problems as religiously motivated, the AU rejected what it described as “divisive and simplistic” narratives.\n\n“The AUC rejects any narrative that weaponises religion or oversimplifies security challenges.

Trump's decision to boycott the summit comes after he had already stated he would not attend the annual summit, and Vice President JD Vance had been scheduled to attend in his place.Trump's decision is reportedly driven by his administration's long-standing accusation that the South African government is allowing minority white Afrikaner farmers to be persecuted and attacked. In a post on his social media site, Trump cited abuses of Afrikaners, including violence, death, and confiscation of their land and farms.The Trump administration has repeatedly accused the South African government of discriminating against white farmers, despite the country's efforts to address historical injustices and promote equality. The South African government has firmly rejected these allegations, stating that they are based on false information and is surprised by the accusations of discrimination, given the country's progress in promoting equality and addressing the legacy of apartheid.South African President Cyril Ramaphosa has personally told Donald Trump that the allegations of persecution are completely false, but the Trump administration has continued to criticise the South African government.

Many ordinary Catholics would love to meet the Pope but now the Vatican brings in Hollywood actors who have said terrible things against God and who aren't Christian.'\n\nOne suggested the meeting had political undertones, saying: 'The rewards for cursing the president. Or maybe De Niro will use the rosary to pray for Trump?'\n\nOthers mocked the optics, with one viral comment reading: 'I do seriously wonder what it is with Popes and movie celebrities. Like... who arranges this stuff? \"Hi Bob... this Pope Bob. Next time you are in Rome stop by.\" \"Sure. How about beginning of November?\" \"Great. We'll keep a slot open for you.\" And why De Niro? Is the message \"I hate Trump, too\"? Just… what?'\n\nOne simply blasted the meeting as 'HORRIFYING!'\n\nThe footage quickly ignited outrage online, with some blasting the Vatican for prioritizing celebrity meet-and-greets over ordinary worshippers\n\nThe meeting quickly sparked backlash online\n\nStill, not everyone was outraged. Some defended the encounter as a harmless gesture of goodwill.\n\nOne fan explained: 'De Niro was in Rome receiving the Lupa Capitolina award and the meeting was arranged for him to attend with another group.

Popes often meet people as good will gestures. That's their job.'\n\nThe viral outrage comes after De Niro fueled speculation he might be planning a permanent move abroad, looking overjoyed as he accepted the Lupa Capitolina from Mayor Roberto Gualtieri. \n\nThe ceremony comes nearly 20 years after De Niro was at the center of a citizenship controversy, when an Italian-American group tried to block Italy’s plan to honor him, claiming he’d spent his career portraying 'unflattering and untrue stereotypes' of Italian-Americans. \n\nIn August 2004, the Order of the Sons of Italy in America (OSIA) — based in Washington, D.C. — publicly condemned the plan, accusing the Oscar winner of having 'made a career of playing gangsters of Italian descent,' per The Guardian.\n\n'He has done nothing to promote Italian culture in the United States. Instead, the OSIA and its members hold him and his movies responsible for considerably damaging the collective reputations of both Italians and Italian-Americans,” the group said in a statement. \n\nDe Niro’s career has long been defined by his portrayals of Italian-Americans and gangster figures, roles that made him an iconic figure in Hollywood. \n\nDe Niro, who currently resides in New York City, had fans wondering if he’s preparing to cross the pond for good after he looked thrilled accepting Rome's top honor, the Lupa Capitolina, from Mayor Roberto Gualtieri on Thursday\n\nFrom the ruthless mobster in The Godfather: Part II to the cunning criminal in Goodfellas, his performances often leaned into the very stereotypes the group criticized. \n\nEven in lighter fare, such as the animated Shark Tale, he brought his signature gangster persona to the character, reinforcing his on-screen association with Italian mob figures.\n\nOSIA was particularly angered by De Niro’s portrayal of a godfather-like figure in Steven Spielberg’s animated film Shark Tale.\n\nOSIA even demanded that DreamWorks edit what it called the film’s 'most offensive aspects' at the time.\n\nDreamWorks pushed back, saying the outrage was misplaced. \n\nThe ceremony comes nearly 20 years after De Niro was at the center of a citizenship controversy, when an Italian-American group tried to block Italy’s plan to honor him, claiming he’d spent his career portraying 'unflattering and untrue stereotypes' of Italian-Americans; (pictured in 1990's Goodfellas)\n\nIn August 2004, the Order of the Sons of Italy in America (OSIA) — based in Washington, D.C. — publicly condemned the plan, accusing the Oscar winner of having 'made a career of playing gangsters of Italian descent,' (pictured 1974's Godfather II)\n\nSpokesman Andy Spahn told reporters, 'This organization has not even seen the film, so we are somewhat perplexed. \n\n'It’s an animated movie about colourful fish. I can’t see how that can offend anyone.'\n\nAt the time, OSIA warned that giving De Niro such an honor would insult millions of Italian-Americans who viewed his filmography as a 'distorted and unbalanced portrayal' of their heritage. per the outlet.\n\nDespite the backlash in the U.S., many Italians supported the Taxi Driver star’s recognition. \n\nIn Ferrazzano — the tiny village De Niro’s great-grandparents left in the 19th century — locals have long celebrated him as one of their own. \n\nThe Guardian reported in 2004 that the village’s 3,000 residents hosted an annual festival devoted entirely to his films, gathering each August to honor his work.\n\nDe Niro, born in New York in 1943, does not qualify for an Italian passport because neither his parents nor grandparents were born in Italy.\n\nHe has never visited the village himself, according to the outlet.\n\nStill, locals remained fiercely proud of their connection to him, describing the actor as a symbol of their immigrant success story, according to the outlet.\n\nItalyRobert de Niro\n\nShare or comment on this article:\nRobert De Niro's meeting with 'anti-Trump' Pope Leo sparks outrage over leader 'fawning over Hollywood stars'\n\nAdd comment","summary":"Robert De Niro's quick stop in Italy has landed him in the middle of a firestorm the Oscar winner likely didn't see coming.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-15270599/Robert-Niro-Pope-Leo-outrage-fawning-Hollywood.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/11/07/22/103699407-0-image-m-106_1762554264003.jpg","video":"https://videos.dailymail.co.uk/video/mol/2025/02/19/4303216800944573987/1024x576_MP4_4303216800944573987.mp4","publish_date":"2025-11-07 23:03:23","author":"Editor,T.

But major gaps in the plan could blunt its impact, drug policy experts say: Some of the drugs the administration has promised discounts on haven’t been approved yet by the Food and Drug Administration; the lower prices for people paying out of pocket only appear to apply to the lowest doses of the drugs; and the deal doesn’t expand Medicare coverage to people seeking treatment for weight loss alone. “It’s a situation where we have more questions than answers,” said Juliette Cubanski, deputy director of the Medicare policy program at KFF, a nonpartisan health policy research group. “Based on what we didn’t hear, that suggests to me that there’s a lot that the administration itself hasn’t even ironed out as of yet.” “It just feels,” she added, “a little bit too squishy right now.” The announcement marks one of the most ambitious efforts yet to tackle the high cost of weight loss drugs in the U.S. Wegovy and Zepbound carry list prices above $1,000 a month, a cost that both Republicans and Democrats have criticized as far too high, especially compared with what other countries pay. Administration officials say there’s still time to iron out details before the lower prices take effect. The lower prices that will be available through the administration’s self-pay platform, TrumpRx, aren’t expected to go live until the end of the year, and the Medicare and Medicaid changes won’t roll out until mid-2026. “I think the administration deserves credit for continuing to try to push the envelope on finding ways to lower prescription drug prices in the U.S.,” Cubanski said. She said KFF polling shows that health care costs, including prescription drugs, are a top concern for Americans. Art Caplan, the head of the division of medical ethics at NYU Grossman School of Medicine in New York City, said the deal, while ambitious, lacks crucial details. “It’s just murky as to how this will take shape, how the programs will work,” Caplan said. “You can’t really tell from what’s going on.” Unapproved drugs Several forms of the drugs included in the deal haven’t yet received FDA approval. That includes oral versions of the weight loss drugs — which are still under development or FDA review — and Eli Lilly’s new multidose injection pens, which haven’t been approved but the drugmaker says are the versions included in the pricing agreement. Lawrence Gostin, director of the O’Neill Institute for National and Global Health Law at Georgetown University, said that makes the administration’s promises premature, since those lower prices can’t take effect until the products are on the market. “It is reckless to negotiate pricing deals on products which the FDA have not yet approved as safe and effective,” Gostin said. “The administration is getting way out ahead of its own safety agency.” An oral version of Wegovy, from Novo Nordisk, is being reviewed by the FDA. A decision is expected in the coming weeks. A multidose version of Zepbound is under review by the FDA, Lilly said. The company hasn't submitted its weight loss pill, orforglipron, to the agency yet. Lilly CEO David Ricks told NBC News’ Tom Llamas on “Top Story” that the FDA would review the pill quickly. “As part of the deal, they’ve agreed to give us an expedited approval,” Ricks said. Different doses, different prices The White House said that both the pills and the injection pens will be available for discounted prices for people who pay out of pocket. Starting doses of weight loss pills will cost $149 for a month’s supply, and the shots will cost an average of $350 for a month’s supply, the White House said. The price of the injections is expected to fall to about $250 within two years, it said. But people may end up paying more. When people start on a weight loss drug, they start with the lowest dose possible — the starting dose — to allow the body to get used to the drug. Over the course of several months, however, they increase the dose until they get to a dose that’s effective for weight loss. Wegovy comes in five doses and Zepbound comes in six, with the most weight loss seen at the highest doses. Administration officials said the starting doses of GLP-1 pills will cost $149 a month, but did not say what higher doses would be. For the injections, the exact White House language was vague: The shots will initially have a “weighted average” price of $350 a month. Lilly, however, said Zepbound will be available at the lowest dose for $299 a month, with additional doses priced up to $449. A spokesperson for Novo Nordisk didn’t say whether doses would have different prices, but said it plans to publish an update on costs “in the coming weeks.” That means patients paying through TrumpRx could end up paying far more than the administration’s advertised prices — especially if patients don’t stay on the lowest doses for long, Caplan said. Limited coverage As part of the deal, Lilly and Novo Nordisk will charge Medicare and Medicaid $245 for a month’s supply of the shots, a move that will likely provide savings for the programs. Medicare enrollees will have their costs capped at $50 a month. Medicaid enrollees often don’t have copays. But not everyone on Medicare or Medicaid is eligible. Under the deal, Medicare will continue to cover the weight loss drugs for people who are overweight or obese and have another qualifying condition, such as heart or kidney disease. The agreement doesn’t expand coverage to people using the drugs for weight loss alone. Medicare, by law, is barred from covering weight loss drugs, Cubanski, of KFF, said. The lack of expanded coverage is a significant omission, said Stacie Dusetzina, a health policy professor at Vanderbilt University in Nashville, Tennessee. Medicare is one of the largest payers in the country, and without broader coverage, millions of patients will remain priced out even as the administration touts lower costs. “You would have to change the law or go through several regulatory steps to be able to offer coverage outside of an already covered indication,” Dusetzina said. A White House spokesperson said the administration wanted to first lower prices for patients who would most benefit, such as those with risk factors associated with obesity. It’s possible the administration could eventually expand Medicare coverage through a pilot program. Ricks, the CEO of Lilly, said at a briefing Thursday that the government plans to launch one in spring 2026 that would be voluntary for Medicare plans. Still, there are issues Medicare plans would have to weigh, Dusetzina said. “The plans will have to think about how many more people might be interested in enrolling and using these drugs and how that would affect their costs,” she said. “So, again, it’s not totally clear to me how that will get operationalized and how soon Medicare beneficiaries would expect to see lower prices.” Ricks said the pilot would be “at no cost” to the plans. Dr. Shauna Levy, a specialist in obesity medicine and the medical director of the Tulane Weight Loss Center in New Orleans, said the deal is “a step in the right direction” but she worries if the administration is overstating the potential savings. “As an obesity community, I think we will remain skeptical of this deal until we see how it actually plays out,” Levy wrote in an email.","summary":"President Donald Trump hailed his deal to slash the price of blockbuster weight loss drugs as a game changer, promising to make Wegovy and Zepbound more affordable for millions of Americans.","url":"https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/trumps-weight-loss-drug-deal-promises-big-savings-details-are-murky-rcna242622","image":"https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-1500w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-11/251107-weight-loss-conference-gk-f53fb7.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-11-07 22:55:32","author":"Berkeley Lovelace Jr","authors":["Berkeley Lovelace Jr"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.284},{"id":376892340,"title":"Trump pardons ex-NYPD officer who was convicted of helping China stalk an expat","text":"President Donald Trump granted a pardon Friday to a former New York police sergeant who was convicted of helping China try to scare an ex-official into going back to his homeland, a prominent case in U.S. authorities' efforts to combat what they claim are Beijing's far-flung efforts to repress critics. \n\nMichael McMahon was sentenced this spring to 18 months in prison for his role in what a federal judge called “a campaign of transnational repression.\" He insisted he was innocent, saying he was “unwittingly used” when he took what he thought was a straightforward private-investigator gig. McMahon said he was told he was working for a Chinese construction company, not the nation's government. \n\nA White House official, speaking Friday on condition of anonymity to discuss a pardon that hasn’t been publicly announced, pointed to McMahon's explanation that he'd been misled. The official also noted that McMahon earned dozens of commendations before a 2001 injury ended his 14-year NYPD career.\n\nMcMahon's lawyer, Lawrence Lustberg, said the pardon “corrects a horrible injustice.” \n\n“I will always believe that it was the Chinese government that victimized Mike, a true hero cop, whom our government should have celebrated and honored, rather than indicted,” Lustberg said by email. \n\nThe Brooklyn-based federal prosecutors’ office that brought the case declined to comment. \n\nA jury had convicted McMahon, 58, of charges that included acting as an illegal foreign agent and stalking. He was released from prison to a halfway house earlier this year and was back at his New Jersey home Friday, his attorney said.\n\n McMahon had supporters in Congress \n\nMcMahon had gotten support from U.S. Reps. Mike Lawler, R-N.J., and Pete Sessions, R-Texas. They wrote to the court last year to back McMahon's assertions of innocence and urge the judge to spare him prison. \n\nLawler cheered the pardon Friday, writing on X that the former officer “never should have been prosecuted to begin with.” A message seeking comment was sent to Sessions' office. \n\nMcMahon was one of three men convicted at the first trial stemming from U.S. claims about China’s decade-old “Operation Fox Hunt” initiative. His co-defendants, both Chinese citizens, also were sentenced to prison, where they remain. Messages seeking comment were sent Friday to attorneys for the men, who denied the charges. \n\nThree other people pleaded guilty in the case, and another five defendants remain at large, believed to be in China. \n\nU.S. authorities have viewed “Operation Fox Hunt,” in at least some instances, as a tool of “transnational repression” — a term for sending government operatives to harass, threaten and silence dissidents living abroad. \n\nBeijing says it's just trying to repatriate fugitives, including corrupt officials, and denies making threats to secure their return. \n\nThe case involving McMahon centered on a former Chinese city official named Xu Jin, who moved with his family to suburban New Jersey in 2010. The Chinese government has accused him and his wife of bribery. The couple denied the allegation and said he was unjustly targeted because of internal politics within China’s Communist government. \n\nChina has no extradition treaty with the U.S. so it couldn't legally compel Xu's return. Instead, U.S. prosecutors said, Beijing engineered years of creepy outreach and innuendo to try to induce him to come back.\n\n A Chinese ex-official got an ominous note \n\nHired by co-defendants to locate Xu, McMahon searched law enforcement and government databases and conducted surveillance. He and Lustberg acknowledged that McMahon missed “red flags” about the $11,000 job, but they said he was duped by his clients and didn’t foresee that the information would be used to hound Xu. \n\n“I never thought for one minute I was working for China, stalking anyone,\" McMahon said at his sentencing. \n\nProsecutors and trial witnesses said Xu was subjected to a pressure campaign that included disparaging Facebook messages to friends of his adult daughter, a slew of letters to a relative in New Jersey and a startling visit from his octogenarian father, who was flown in from China to press his son to return. \n\nFinally, Xu's wife found a note on their front door that read, in translation: “If you are willing to go back to the mainland and spend 10 years in prison, your wife and children will be all right. That’s the end of this matter!”\n\nXu said at the trial that before seeing the note, he thought the Chinese Communist Party's overtures were “only a mental threat to me.”\n\n\"However, when I saw that note, I realized that it had become a physical threat,” Xu testified, through a court interpreter. \n\nSuperville reported from Washington.

Sources told Fox News Digital Brennan; Strzok, the FBI’s former deputy assistant director of counterintelligence; and Page, a former FBI lawyer, were served with federal subpoenas on Friday. Law enforcement sources told Fox News Digital that up to 30 subpoenas will be issued in the coming days relating to the investigation. The grand jury is out of the Southern District of Florida. U.S. attorney for the Southern District of Florida Jason Reding Quiñones is supervising the probe. Fox News Digital first reported this summer that Brennan was under criminal investigation. Strzok and Page first came under scrutiny in 2018 when Justice Department Inspector General Michael Horowitz uncovered a series of anti-Trump text messages between them. Both were assigned to work on Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s team in 2017. Page served on Mueller’s team on a short detail, returning to the FBI’s Office of General Counsel in July 2017. Strzok, though, was removed from the team and was reassigned to the FBI’s Human Resources Division. Prior to serving in the special counsel’s office, Strzok was a top agent in the bureau’s counterintelligence division. Strzok is the FBI agent who, in July 2016, opened the FBI’s initial Russia investigation, which was nicknamed \"Crossfire Hurricane\" inside the bureau. Page resigned from the bureau in May 2018, and Strzok eventually was fired in August 2018. EX-OBAMA INTEL BOSS WANTED ANTI-TRUMP DOSSIER INCLUDED IN 'ATYPICAL' 2016 ASSESSMENT DESPITE PUSHBACK Strzok was fired from the bureau in August 2018 after months of scrutiny regarding the anti-Trump text messages exchanged between himself and Page. During congressional testimony in 2018, Strzok confirmed that he and Page were involved in an extramarital affair. As for the criminal investigation into Brennan, CIA Director John Ratcliffe referred evidence of wrongdoing by Brennan to FBI Director Kash Patel for potential prosecution, DOJ sources told Fox News Digital. Sources, at the time, said that the referral was received and told Fox News Digital that a criminal investigation into Brennan was opened and is underway. DOJ sources declined to provide further details. It is unclear, at this point, if the investigation spans beyond his alleged false statements to Congress. The Brennan investigation came after Ratcliffe, this summer, declassified a \"lessons learned\" review of the creation of the 2017 Intelligence Community Assessment (ICA). The 2017 ICA alleged Russia sought to influence the 2016 presidential election to help then-candidate Donald Trump. But the review found that the process of the ICA's creation was rushed with \"procedural anomalies,\" and that officials diverted from intelligence standards. It also determined that the \"decision by agency heads to include the Steele Dossier in the ICA ran counter to fundamental tradecraft principles and ultimately undermined the credibility of a key judgment.\" The dossier — an anti-Trump document filled with unverified and wholly inaccurate claims that was commissioned by Fusion GPS and paid for by Democrat presidential candidate Hillary Clinton's campaign and the DNC — has been widely discredited. Last week's review marks the first time career CIA officials have acknowledged politicization of the process by which the ICA was written, particularly by Obama-era political appointees. Records declassified as part of that review further revealed that Brennan did, in fact, push for the dossier to be included in the 2017 ICA. Brennan testified to the House Judiciary Committee in May 2023, however, that he did not believe the dossier should be included in that intelligence product. Ratcliffe was not surprised by the review's findings, a source familiar told Fox News Digital, given the director's long history of criticizing Brennan's politicization of intelligence. But Ratcliffe was compelled to refer aspects of Brennan’s involvement to the FBI for review of possible criminality, the source said. WHITE HOUSE WANTS OBAMA INTEL OFFICIALS 'HELD ACCOUNTABLE' FOR ROLE PEDDLING 2016 RUSSIA HOAX The source was unable to share the sensitive details of Ratcliffe’s criminal referral to the FBI with Fox News Digital, but said that Brennan \"violated the public’s trust and should be held accountable for it.\" The false statements portion of the probe stems from a newly declassified email sent to Brennan by the former deputy CIA director in December 2016. That message said that including the dossier in the ICA in any capacity jeopardized \"the credibility of the entire paper.\" \"Despite these objections, Brennan showed a preference for narrative consistency over analytical soundness,\" the new CIA review states. \"When confronted with specific flaws in the Dossier by the two mission center leaders – one with extensive operational experience and the other with a strong analytic background – he appeared more swayed by the Dossier's general conformity with existing theories than by legitimate tradecraft concerns.\" The review added: \"Brennan ultimately formalized his position in writing, stating that ‘my bottomline is that I believe that the information warrants inclusion in the report.’\" OBAMA ADMIN 'MANUFACTURED' INTELLIGENCE TO CREATE 2016 RUSSIAN ELECTION INTERFERENCE NARRATIVE, DOCUMENTS SHOW But Brennan testified the opposite in front of Congress in May 2023. \"The CIA was very much opposed to having any reference or inclusion of the Steele dossier in the Intelligence Community Assessment,\" Brennan testified before the House committee, according to the transcript of his deposition reviewed by Fox News Digital. \"And so they sent over a copy of the dossier to say that this was going to be separate from the rest of that assessment.\" CIA officials at the time of its creation pushed back against the FBI, which sought to include the dossier, arguing that the dossier should not be included in the assessment, and casting it as simply \"internet rumor.\" Ultimately, Steele’s reporting was not included in the body of the final ICA prepared for then-President Barack Obama, but instead detailed in this footnote, \"largely at the insistence of FBI’s senior leadership,\" according to a review by the Justice Department inspector general, and later, the Senate Intelligence Committee. But back in June 2020, Ratcliffe, while serving as director of national intelligence, declassified a footnote of the 2017 ICA, which revealed that the reporting of Trump dossier author Christopher Steele had only \"limited corroboration\" regarding whether then-President-elect Trump \"knowingly worked with Russian officials to bolster his chances of beating\" Hillary Clinton and other claims. FLASHBACK: DNI DECLASSIFIES BRENNAN NOTES, CIA MEMO ON HILLARY CLINTON 'STIRRING UP' SCANDAL BETWEEN TRUMP, RUSSIA The footnote, also known as \"Annex A\" of the 2017 ICA, exclusively obtained by Fox News Digital in June 2020, spanned less than two pages and detailed reporting by Steele, the former British spy who authored the unverified anti-Trump dossier — a document that helped serve as the basis for controversial Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) warrants obtained against former Trump campaign aide Carter Page. Steele’s reporting, at the time, was commissioned by opposition research firm Fusion GPS and funded by the Clinton campaign and the Democratic National Committee (DNC) through law firm Perkins Coie. The footnote made clear the internal concerns officials had over that document. \"An FBI source (Steele) using both identified and unidentified subsources, volunteered highly politically sensitive information from the summer to the fall of 2016 on Russian influence efforts aimed at the US presidential election,\" the annex read. \"We have only limited corroboration of the source’s reporting in this case and did not use it to reach the analytic conclusions of the CIA/FBI/NSA assessment.\" \"The source collected this information on behalf of private clients and was not compensated for it by the FBI,\" it continued. But the annex notes that Steele's reporting was \"not developed by the layered subsource network.\" \"The FBI source caveated that, although similar to previously provided reporting in terms of content, the source was unable to vouch for the additional information's sourcing and accuracy,\" the annex states. \"Hence this information is not included in this product.\" FBI IGNORED 'CLEAR WARNING SIGN' OF CLINTON-LED EFFORT TO 'MANIPULATE' BUREAU FOR 'POLITICAL PURPOSES' Justice Department Inspector General Michael Horowitz also reviewed the inclusion of Steele’s reporting in the ICA during his review of alleged misconduct related to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, or FISA. His report, released in late 2019, found that there were \"significant inaccuracies and omissions\" in FISA warrants for former Trump campaign aide Page. Those warrants relied heavily on Steele’s reporting, despite the FBI not having had specific information corroborating allegations against Page that were included in Steele’s reporting. Meanwhile, Fox News Digital exclusively reported in October 2020 that Brennan briefed former President Obama and administration officials on intelligence that then-Democrat nominee former Secretary of State Clinton was stirring up a plan to tie Trump to Russia. Ratcliffe, as director of national intelligence, declassified Brennan’s handwritten notes memorializing that meeting, which were exclusively obtained by Fox News Digital in October 2020. On July 28, 2016, Brennan briefed Obama on a plan from one of Clinton's campaign foreign policy advisors \"to vilify Donald Trump by stirring up a scandal claiming interference by the Russian security service.\" Comey, then-Vice President Joe Biden, former Attorney General Loretta Lynch and former Director of National Intelligence James Clapper were in the Brennan-Obama briefing. FLASHBACK: DECLASSIFIED TRUMP-RUSSIA PROBE DOCS TO DATE: WHAT TO KNOW After that briefing, the CIA properly forwarded that information through a Counterintelligence Operational Lead (CIOL) to Comey and then-Deputy Assistant Director of Counterintelligence Peter Strzok, with the subject line: \"Crossfire Hurricane.\" Fox News Digital exclusively obtained and reported on the CIOL in October 2020, which stated: \"The following information is provided for the exclusive use of your bureau for background investigative action or lead purposes as appropriate.\" \"Per FBI verbal request, CIA provides the below examples of information the CROSSFIRE HURRICANE fusion cell has gleaned to date,\" the memo continued. \"An exchange (REDACTED) discussing US presidential candidate Hillary Clinton’s approval of a plan concerning US presidential candidate Donald Trump and Russian hackers hampering US elections as a means of distracting the public from her use of a private email server.\" The FBI on July 31, 2016, opened a counterintelligence investigation into whether candidate Trump and members of his campaign were colluding or coordinating with Russia to influence the 2016 campaign. That investigation was referred to inside the bureau as \"Crossfire Hurricane.\" Former Special Counsel Robert Mueller was appointed to take over the FBI’s original \"Crossfire Hurricane\" investigation. After nearly two years, Mueller’s investigation, which concluded in March 2019, yielded no evidence of criminal conspiracy or coordination between the Trump campaign and Russian officials during the 2016 presidential election. Shortly after, John Durham was appointed as special counsel to investigate the origins of the \"Crossfire Hurricane\" probe. Durham found that the FBI \"failed to act\" on a \"clear warning sign\" that the bureau was the \"target\" of a Clinton-led effort to \"manipulate or influence the law enforcement process for political purposes\" ahead of the 2016 presidential election. \"The aforementioned facts reflect a rather startling and inexplicable failure to adequately consider and incorporate the Clinton Plan intelligence into the FBI’s investigative decision-making in the Crossfire Hurricane investigation,\" Durham’s report states. \"Indeed, had the FBI opened the Crossfire Hurricane investigation as an assessment and, in turn, gathered and analyzed data in concert with the information from the Clinton Plan intelligence, it is likely that the information received would have been examined, at a minimum, with a more critical eye,\" the report continued. COMEY PLEADS NOT GUILTY IN COURT AFTER INDICTMENT ON ALLEGED FALSE STATEMENTS, OBSTRUCTION Durham, in his report, said the FBI \"failed to act on what should have been—when combined with other incontrovertible facts— a clear warning sign that the FBI might then be the target of an effort to manipulate or influence the law enforcement process for political purposes during the 2016 presidential election.\" The Justice Department, earlier this year, formed a \"strike force\" to assess evidence publicized by Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard relating to former President Barack Obama and his top national security and intelligence officials' alleged involvement in the origins of the Trump–Russia collusion narrative. Meanwhile, Fox News Digital also first reported that Comey was under criminal investigation. Comey has been charged with making false statements and obstruction of a congressional proceeding.

It's a physical reality because we don't have port(s),\" Orban said.\nHungary - the closest ally in the EU of both Trump and the Kremlin - has also offered to host a summit in Budapest between Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin.\nTrump called off the summit in October amid growing frustration with Putin's refusal to end his invasion of Ukraine, and slapped Russia's two biggest oil companies with sanctions.\nWashington has given firms who work with Russian oil giants Rosneft and Lukoil one month to cut ties or face secondary sanctions, which would deny them access to US banks, traders, shippers and insurers.\n'Respect this leader'\nExperts say the meeting with the US president was expected to give at least a \"symbolic\" win to Orban, who faces an unprecedented challenge to his 15-year rule ahead of elections next spring amid economic stagnation.\nTrump told EU leaders to show more respect to Orban, who has thumbed his nose at them over migration.\n\"I think they should respect Hungary and respect this leader very, very strongly because he's been right on immigration,\" Trump told reporters.\nTrump, who has carried out a sweeping crackdown on immigration at home, again alleged a link between migrants and crime, which is not backed up by statistics in the US.\nOrban visited his \"dear friend\" Trump at his Mar-a-Lago residence in Florida three times last year, but the US president's return to power has had a mixed effect on Hungary.\nWashington has withdrawn sanctions against top Orban aide Antal Rogan and restored the country's status in a visa waiver scheme.\nBut Trump's tariffs against the European Union have hit Hungary's export-oriented car industry hard, contributing to an already weak economy.\nDaniel Hegedus, central Europe director at the German Marshall Fund (GMF), had predicted that Trump would show some flexibility on Orban's request on the oil sanctions.\n\"I expect Trump will give a victory to Orban that he can sell at home and strengthens his position, as the administration actively supports political forces that divide the EU,\" he said.\nOrban - who has refused to send military aid to Ukraine and opposes Kyiv's EU bid - has had frequent run-ins with Brussels on the rule of law and other issues.","summary":"Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban pressed his case that Russian energy was vital for his landlocked country.","url":"https://www.freemalaysiatoday.com/category/highlight/2025/11/08/hungarys-orban-wins-russian-oil-sanctions-exemption-from-trump","image":"https://www.freemalaysiatoday.com/cdn-cgi/image/quality=75,format=auto,fit=scale-down,dpr=1,width=1600,height=1000/https://media.freemalaysiatoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/eedd0239-13492909.webp","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-11-07 22:50:09","author":"AFP","authors":["AFP"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"my","sentiment":0.077},{"id":376881090,"title":"Turkiye: Israel Fails to Fulfill its Obligations in Gaza Despite Palestinians' Constructive Approach","text":"Ankara, November 7 (QNA) – Turkish Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan has stated that the Palestinian side has demonstrated a constructive approach in advancing the peace process in Gaza, while Israel is failing to fulfill its obligations and does not believe in the fundamental objectives of the ceasefire.\n\nThis came during a joint press conference today with his Romanian counterpart, Iona Toiu, in Ankara.\n\nFidan explained that the efforts exerted to return all prisoners and bodies to Israel are among the most prominent indicators of the Palestinian side's constructive stance.\n\nHe added: \"In contrast, Israel continues to fail to fulfill its obligations regarding the delivery of humanitarian aid.\"\n\nHe noted that trucks carrying humanitarian aid are not reaching Gaza, and the basic needs of Palestinians in Gaza remain unmet.\n\nHe emphasized Turkey's rejection of the continuation of this situation, reiterating the call for urgent and necessary measures to deliver aid.\n\nHe noted that a draft resolution on Gaza is to be submitted to the UN Security Council, and that Turkiye is sharing its views and contributions on this draft with the relevant parties.\n\nFidan said that the countries that met with US President Donald Trump in New York consulted on this issue and transformed this into diplomatic activity.\n\nFidan also confirmed that they are discussing the issue of Gaza's reconstruction with international partners after the situation there improves, expressing his hope that an initiative will be implemented that will promote peace in Gaza and enable reconstruction and the restoration of some aspects of life that Palestinians have lost.\n\nHe stressed the importance of maintaining the ceasefire in Gaza, stating that the situation is \"fragile\" because \"the Israeli administration and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu do not believe in the fundamental objectives of the ceasefire.\"\n\nHe added: \"Nevertheless, the Palestinian side is adhering to the terms of the ceasefire with great maturity.

Kathy Hochul signed a permit Friday advancing a major gas pipeline to pump more fuel into New York City.\n\nThe New York Department of Environmental Conservation (NYSDEC) issued a vital water permit for the Northeast Supply Enhancement pipeline Friday, in a reversal from its previous rejections, according to NYSDEC. The project has been hotly contested by some Congressional New York Democrats, with Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries and others urging Hochul to consider the environmental impacts of the pipeline on Oct. 15.\n\n“As Governor, a top priority is making sure the lights and heat stay on for all New Yorkers as we face potential energy shortages downstate as soon as next summer,” Hochul said in a statement, according to multiple reports. “We need to govern in reality. We are facing war against clean energy from Washington Republicans, including our New York delegation, which is why we have adopted an all-of-the-above approach that includes a continued commitment to renewables and nuclear power to ensure grid reliability and affordability.” (RELATED: Trump Admin Reportedly Lets NY Advance Green Project Hoping For Pipeline — But Team Hochul Downplays Deal)\n\nIf the project is completed, the underwater pipeline will span almost 24 miles, transporting natural gas from Pennsylvania through New Jersey to sections of New York City, according to NYSDEC. The New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection also reportedly issued needed permits, Commissioner Shawn LaTourette told Politico.\n\nThe project may still require other permitting permissions, with NYSDEC noting that the developer “is required to develop a Dredge Management Plan, which will be subject to NYSDEC approval and must include detailed adaptive management techniques should any actual or imminent exceedance of total suspended sediments occur.”\n\nNew York has higher utility bills than average, and its commitment to intermittent green energy technology like wind and solar decreased the state power grid’s reliability, experts previously explained to the Daily Caller News Foundation.\n\nPresident Donald Trump blasted Hochul for high New York energy costs on Truth Social on Monday, writing that she “is killing the entire region with Energy Prices that are OUT OF CONTROL, and expected to TRIPLE because she can’t get an Upstate and, separately, Long Island, PIPELINE built.”\n\nThe Trump administration pushed for more East Coast pipelines in May and reportedly lifted a work-stop order on a major offshore wind farm in exchange for Hochul’s pipeline approval, according to the Washington Free Beacon. However, Hochul’s team denied that any official deal was made, the DCNF previously reported.\n\nWhile the Biden administration pushed for intermittent resources like wind and solar, cracking down on conventional resources like coal, oil and gas, the Trump administration pulled federal support for some green energy sources and looked to bolster resources like nuclear, coal and geothermal among others.\n\nNotably, Hochul also looked to embrace nuclear energy after the state shuttered the Indian Point nuclear plant in 2021.\n\nHochul’s office did not respond to the DCNF’s request for comment.\n\nAll content created by the Daily Caller News Foundation, an independent and nonpartisan newswire service, is available without charge to any legitimate news publisher that can provide a large audience.

Trump was hosting Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban when he opened the White House for questions from journalists.\n\nAs is the drill, a reporter questioned Trump about the Walmart Thanksgiving meal, which triggered him bigtime. “Mr. President, since you brought up the Walmart Thanksgiving meal, and it is cheaper, but it also contains less,” the reporter asked.\n\nTrump, straight-up, dismissed the question because the reporter happened to be from NBC. “I haven’t heard that,” Trump said, asking the journalist, “Who are you with?” On learning that she is from NBC, he interrupted, “You’re fake news. NBC’s gone down the tubes with most of the rest of them.”\n\nReporter: On the Walmart thanksgiving meal, it is cheaper but it also contains less\nTrump: I haven’t heard that. Who are you with?\nReporter: NBC\nTrump: Fake news pic.twitter.com/QZt8PaP4nW\n— Acyn (@Acyn) November 7, 2025\n\nThe not-so-surprising follow-up to Trump’s dismissal act was the wave of backlash that he received on social media as the video made its way to X. “How is it fake news when Walmart released the list?” a curious X user questioned. Another one read, “Fake news = facts I don’t like.”\n\n“Any truth that goes against what Trump wants you to think is suddenly fake news. I seriously think he would say something like that if Fox asked the same question,” noted another. Slamming Trump, a netizen commented, “Fake news is the battle cry of the proudly ignorant.”\n\nA section of the Internet tried to decode Trump’s relationship with the media, which is nothing short of a rollercoaster ride (more on that later). “And the moment a reporter mentions the missing portions, he does what he always does: → Pretend he never heard it → Ask who they work for → Yell fake news and hope the crowd forgets the question. It’s not a presidency… It’s a reflex,” an X user pointed out.\n\nSome even gave a shout-out to the journalist. “Bravo to a reporter that actually did their job,” read a remark. “How is this acceptable in America? You don’t have to like a particular reporter, but you do have to answer questions honestly. Attacking journalists is evasive and juvenile behavior,” another one wrote, echoing similar thoughts.\n\nDismissing truth is what this user perceived Trump’s statement to be. “‘I haven’t heard that.’ Admitting his ignorance. Furthermore, dismissing truths which are inconvenient to his agenda,” the comment read.\n\nPresident Trump’s complicated relationship with the media needs no introduction, but for those who require one. It is Fox News that has often been accused of being pro-Trump. On Wednesday, the network honored First Lady Melania Trump with the ‘Patriot of the Year Award’ despite her largely being away from the spotlight and the White House.\n\nIronically, Trump also accused Fox News of “fake spin” in one of his Truth Social entries earlier this year. Trump was furious after the network’s interview with Democrat Mark Kelly, who talked about the effects of the government shutdown on health care.\n\nTrump complaining about Doocy’s interview with Senator Mark Kelly: Fox should either get on board, or get off board, NOW, but at this point, it just doesn’t make any difference to me. They suck up the Ratings because of us, and then spin them in the Democrats’ direction. They… pic.twitter.com/h2HVBNz5kf\n— Acyn (@Acyn) October 5, 2025\n\nNot so long ago, Trump interrupted a reporter midway and said, “I don’t take questions from ABC fake news. After what you did with Stephanopoulos to the Vice President of the United States, I don’t take questions from ABC fake news.”\n\nTrump’s tales of media bashing are not just restricted to news channels. It was only last month that he slammed TIME magazine for a piece they did on him. Trump’s complaint, however, was about the unflattering cover photo accompanying the piece. “They ‘disappeared’ my hair, and then had something floating on top of my head that looked like a floating crown, but an extremely small one,” he wrote in his Truth Social entry.\n\nDuring a press meeting last month at the White House, Trump made a misogynistic comment on a female reporter. He is also often schooled by the Internet for misbehaving with female journalists.","summary":"Trump’s comment was met with a wave of backlash on the Internet","url":"https://www.inquisitr.com/youre-fake-news-donald-trump-dismisses-nbc-reporter-over-walmart-thanksgiving-meal-question","image":"https://www.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Donald-Trump_Snaps_at_Journalist_1200.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-11-07 22:45:15","author":"Pranita Chaubey","authors":["Pranita Chaubey"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.522},{"id":376877050,"title":"Olivia Rodrigo Slams ICE for Using Her Song to Promote ‘Racist, Hateful Propaganda’","text":"Skip to main content\n\nOlivia Rodrigo attends the 67th GRAMMY Awards on February 02, 2025 in Los Angeles, California.\n\nFrazer Harrison/Getty Images)\n\nDo you get deja vu? Donald Trump‘s administration has once again been slammed by an artist for using their music without permission, this time receiving a comment from an unhappy Olivia Rodrigo after the White House and Department of Homeland Security shared a video set to one of her songs.\n\nThe controversial clip in question was shared in a joint Instagram post on Tuesday. Soundtracked by “All-American Bitch,” the opening track on the pop star’s Billboard 200-topping sophomore album, Guts, the video shows United States Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers forcibly tackling, detaining and deporting people.\n\nOlivia Rodrigo Caps Guts Tour With ‘Lacy’ Performance in NYC\n\nOlivia Rodrigo Speaks Out Against Jimmy Kimmel’s Suspension: ‘Blatant Censorship’\n\nOlivia Rodrigo & Gracie Abrams Refuse to ‘Remain SILENT’ About Starving Palestinian Children\n\nIt then cuts to a montage of supposed immigrants voluntarily boarding flights organized by the DHS, smiling and giving thumbs up as they go. “LEAVE NOW and self-deport using the CBP Home app,” the caption reads. “If you don’t, you will face the consequences.”\n\nIn the comments, Rodrigo wrote, “don’t ever use my songs to promote your racist, hateful propaganda.”\n\nBillboard has reached out to the White House and ICE for comment.\n\nIt’s unclear why the government would want to use a song by the three-time Grammy winner. Not only has Rodrigo been vocal in her opposition to Trump, endorsing his opponent Kamala Harris in the 2024 election, but she’s also specifically called out his harsh crackdown on immigration by way of ICE raids this past year.\n\n“I’ve lived in LA my whole life and I’m deeply upset about these violent deportations of my neighbors under the current administration,” she wrote on her Instagram Story in June. “LA simply wouldn’t exist without immigrants. Treating hardworking community members with such little respect, empathy, and due process is awful. I stand with the beautiful, diverse community of Los Angeles and with immigrants all across America. I stand for our right to freedom of speech and freedom to protest.”\n\nThat said, Trump’s administration is famous for using music without artist permission at this point. In the past few weeks alone, Kenny Loggins slammed the twice-impeached POTUS for pairing “Danger Zone” with an AI-generated video of himself dumping feces on “No Kings” protestors, and Swifties called out the White House for making a TikTok set to Taylor Swift’s “The Fate of Ophelia.” (The pop star herself didn’t comment on the issue, but given her long history of clashing with Trump, it’s probably safe to say she didn’t give him the green light.)\n\nGet weekly rundowns straight to your inbox\n\nWant to know what everyone in the music business is talking about?\n\nGet in the know on\n\nVisit Billboard Pro for music business news\n\nBillboard is a part of Penske Media Corporation. © 2025 Billboard Media, LLC.

He has even served time in the infamous Abu Ghraib prison. \n\nThe U.N. Security Council voted 14-0 in favor of adoption of the resolution, with one abstention. \n\n\"With the adoption of this text, the Council is sending a strong political signal that recognizes Syria is in a new era since Assad and his associates were toppled in December 2024,\" U.S. ambassador to the United Nations Mike Waltz said moments after the resolution was adopted Thursday. \n\n\"As President Trump previously indicated, now is Syria's chance at greatness,\" Waltz added, noting that al-Sharaa, as well as Syria’s interior minister, Anas Hasan Khattab, were now 'de-listed' from a sanctions list. \n\nMonday's meeting between Trump and al-Sharaa marks the first-ever official visit by a Syrian president to the White House. \n\nIt's also the third meeting between Trump and al-Sharaa this year, as the Syrian leader confronts the challenges of rebuilding the country, seeking to restore ties with Arab countries and the West after years of civil war under Bashar al-Assad's regime. The Assad regime's fall brought to an end nearly 14 years of civil war.\n\nA senior Trump administration official said Monday's meeting between Trump and al-Sharaa will focus on counterterrorism efforts. Syria is also expected to join the U.S.-led anti–Islamic State coalition, which includes some 80 countries working to prevent a resurgence of the extremist group, according to the official. \n\nThere is also an effort ongoing in Congress to fully repeal stringent U.S. sanctions imposed against Syria in 2019 by including the repeal in the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA), a must-pass defense policy bill that usually clears Congress at the end of the year. \n\nMost congressional lawmakers are eager to repeal the sanctions, arguing that the sanctions have become an obstacle to Syria's stability and reconstruction. \n\n\"Effective diplomacy requires bold action, and removing sanctions on Syria’s leadership is a necessary step to bring the Syrian economy into the 21st century.

President Trump and his allies have used every insulting term in their vocabulary to deride AG James and call for criminal penalties in retaliation for the exercise of her rights and fulfillment of her statutory duties to fulfill her obligations as New York state’s attorney general,” lawyers for James wrote in urging that the case be dismissed.\n\nThe name-calling by Trump includes describing Trump as “crooked,” “scum,” “a monster,” and “criminal,” according to the filing.\n\nThe filing is similar to one from another of Trump’s perceived adversaries, James Comey, who has pleaded not guilty to charges of making a false statement and obstructing Congress and who has said the case against him is similarly vindictive and inspired by the president's desire for retribution.\n\nJames is accused of lying on mortgage papers to get favorable loan terms when purchasing a modest house in Norfolk, Virginia, where she has family. She pleaded not guilty last month, and told reporters outside the courthouse that the Trump administration was using the justice system as a “tool of revenge.”\n\nTo bolster their claim of a vindictive prosecution, James' attorneys also assert that the Justice Department has singled her out for scrutiny “while ignoring apparent inconsistencies in the mortgage records of numerous other public officials.” \n\nThey say the activities that form the basis of the indictment match the conduct of other high-profile figures who have not been investigated or charged.\n\n“The only meaningful difference between AG James and these individuals is that AG James is a Democratic Attorney General who spoke out against the President, while the others are his allies and cabinet members,” defense lawyers wrote. \n\nLike Comey, she was charged in Virginia by a hastily appointed U.S. attorney, Lindsey Halligan, a White House aide without any prosecutorial experience who was named to the post by Trump after the administration effectively forced out the prosecutor who had overseen both investigations, Erik Siebert, but had not brought charges in either case.\n\nAfter Siebert’s resignation, Trump, in an extraordinary social media post, urged Attorney General Pam Bondi to prosecute James and other political foes, noting that he had been impeached and indicted himself multiple times. Trump wrote the administration “can’t delay any longer, it’s killing our reputation and credibility,” adding: “JUSTICE MUST BE SERVED, NOW!!!”\n\nJames was first elected in 2018 as New York state’s top lawyer, after holding elected jobs in New York City. She is the first woman elected as the state’s attorney general.\n\nJames has been a frequent target of Trump’s ire, especially since she won a staggering judgment against the president and his companies in a lawsuit alleging he defrauded banks by overstating the value of his real estate holdings on financial statements. An appeals court overturned the fine, which had ballooned to more than $500 million with interest, but upheld a lower court’s finding that Trump had committed fraud.","summary":"New York Attorney General Letitia James is asking a federal judge to dismiss a mortgage fraud case against her, calling it a vindictive and politically motivated prosecution brought at the behest of a president who regards her as an enemy","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/donald-trump-letitia-james-new-york-washington-norfolk-b2861190.html","image":"","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-11-07 22:30:35","author":"Eric Tucker","authors":["Eric Tucker"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.447},{"id":376867192,"title":"Phil Mickelson drops a 3-word reaction to California allegedly spending more on healthcare of illegals than on police","text":"Phil Mickelson has once again made headlines with his outspoken political views, this time reacting sharply to a report about California’s spending priorities.

I am asking the DOJ to act expeditiously,” he added.\n\nHe subsequently claimed in a second post that something was “fishy” because “the price of Boxed Beef has gone up” even while cattle prices were stable or falling.\n\nThe president’s Friday afternoon rant came weeks after he floated — and quickly abandoned — a plan to have the government purchase Argentine beef in an effort to lower prices and also prop up the Argentine beef sector ahead of last month’s elections in the South American country.\n\n“We would buy some beef from Argentina,” he told reporters during an October 20 media availability on Air Force One en route from Florida to Washington. “If we do that, that will bring our beef prices down.”\n\nUS beef prices have been stubbornly high for a variety of reasons, including drought and reduced imports from Mexico because of a flesh-eating pest in cattle herds there, as well as tariffs Trump has placed on beef imports from Brazil to punish the Brazilian government for imprisoning his friend, ex-president Jair Bolsonaro, for having attempted a coup to remain in power after losing an election.\n\nBut the plan met with swift opposition from the American beef industry as well as Republican senators from cattle-producing states.\n\nOne senator, Deb Fisher of Nebraska, said in a statement at the time that the Argentine beef proposal “wasn’t the way” to address high prices.\n\n“Right now, government intervention in the beef market will hurt our cattle ranchers. The U.S. has safe, reliable beef, and it is the one bright spot in our struggling ag economy. Nebraska’s ranchers cannot afford to have the rug pulled out from under them when they’re just getting ahead or simply breaking even,” she said.\n\nVice President JD Vance was subsequently “bombarded” with questions about President Donald Trump’s new beef deal with Argentina during a lunch with Republican senators last week, leading the VP to reportedly ask if any senators had “questions NOT about beef” at one point.\n\nTrump’s outburst over high beef prices also follows devastating losses for his party’s candidates in the New Jersey and Virginia gubernatorial races at the hands of voters who expressed anger over his administration's failure to address rising prices contributing to an ever-higher cost of living in the U.S.\n\nCiting New Jersey Governor-elect Mikie Sherrill and Virginia Governor-elect Abigail Spanberger’s laser-focused campaigns which centered on “affordability” just one year after voters cited higher prices as the reason for returning him to the White House in the 2024 presidential election, Trump complained that the Democrats’ focus on “affordability” was “a con job.”\n\n“The Democrats are good at a few things, cheating on elections and conning people with facts that aren’t true,” said Trump, who then proceeded to rattle off a list of baseless assertions about the prices of this year’s Thanksgiving dinner staples and gasoline, the latter of which he falsely claimed is available to Americans at $2 per gallon.\n\n“Prices are down under the Trump administration, and they're down substantially ... gasoline is way down, and the other big thing is ... inflation is way down ... we did a great job on groceries and affordability. The The only problem is the fake news. You people don't want to report it,” he said.\n\n“The reason I don't want to talk about affordability is because everybody knows that it's far less expensive under Trump than it was under sleepy Joe Biden and the prices are way down.”","url":"https://uk.news.yahoo.com/trump-goes-meat-packing-industry-211926072.html","image":"https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/i4Cik1wfGers2tbjn_AyVA--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTI0MDA7aD0xNjAwO2NmPXdlYnA-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_independent_577/bdbd870852b820abb11ee71a6fe905cd","video":"","publish_date":"2025-11-07 22:24:45","author":"Andrew Feinberg","authors":["Andrew Feinberg"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.417},{"id":376895028,"title":"FACT FOCUS: Trump says Thanksgiving dinner will cost 25% less this year. His numbers are misleading","text":"With Thanksgiving less than three weeks away, the question of how much this year’s turkey and trimmings will cost looms large, especially with grocery prices 2.7% higher than they were in 2024.\n\nPresident Donald Trump has claimed over the past two days that costs for the Thanksgiving meal are down 25% this year, citing a prepackaged Thanksgiving meal basket from Walmart.\n\n“I just saw that Walmart came out with a statement last night, they've done it for many years, that Thanksgiving this year will cost 25% less than Thanksgiving last year,” he said during a news conference on Friday with Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán.\n\nBut Trump’s numbers are off. Here's a closer look at the facts.\n\nCLAIM: Walmart prices show that the cost of Thanksgiving dinner is 25% lower in 2025 than in 2024.\n\nTHE FACTS: This is misleading. While Walmart's 2025 meal basket costs about 25% less than the one from 2024, that's because it offers fewer items and different products that make it more affordable.\n\n“It's not apples to apples, right?” said David Anderson, a livestock economist at Texas A&M University. “What this does highlight is individual retailers’ strategies for getting customers in the door.”\n\nThe 2025 basket costs less than $40 and feeds 10 people, about $4 a head, according to Walmart. In 2024, a basket for eight cost approximately $56, less than $7 per person. That's about a 25% decrease, possibly more depending on price fluctuations. John Furner, president and CEO of Walmart U.S., touted the savings in a LinkedIn post last month.\n\nBut the baskets differ significantly. For example, this year's includes just 15 items compared to last year's 29. It is missing many dessert items, including a pecan pie, mini marshmallows and muffin mix, as well as savory items such as sweet potatoes, yellow onions and celery stalks.\n\nThe superstore retailer has also substituted some products. Instead of 12 sweet Hawaiian rolls, the 2025 deal includes 12 dinner rolls. Both are from Walmart's store brand. It also offers Kinder's crispy fried onions as opposed to French's.\n\nPlus, the amount of each item varies. Customers were promised a 10-16 pound turkey in 2024, but a 13.5 pound one this year. And they'll get one can of cream of mushroom soup instead of two.\n\n“They're marketing it that ‘hey, this is a more affordable way,’ yet that implies that 'man, stuff's a lot more expensive,'” Anderson said. “I guess it's good marketing.”\n\nA Thursday press release from the White House also cited cheaper Thanksgiving deals at Lidl's, Aldi's, Target and Schnucks.\n\nTarget's four-person meal costs less than $20, about the same as in 2024, but substitutes green beans and cream of mushroom soup for French bread and frozen corn — also not an apples-to-apples comparison.\n\nSchnucks provided The Associated Press with a press release saying the retailer is offering consumers its lowest price on a frozen store-brand turkey in over 15 years. It declined further comment. The other four retailers did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nAccording to a recent report from Wells Fargo, the cost of a 10-person Thanksgiving meal has fallen 2% to 3% since 2024, depending in part on whether customers go for national name brands or cheaper store labels. The White House press release also cited this report.\n\nSome economists have concerns about the price of turkey. Purdue University’s College of Agriculture reported at the end of October that wholesale prices are up 75% since October 2024, while retail prices are 25% higher than a year ago.\n\nAn earlier analysis from the American Farm Bureau Federation found that wholesale turkey prices were up about 40%.\n\nAnd yet, that doesn’t mean every bird will be pricier in 2025. Anderson explained that because certain retailers, such as Walmart, contract their turkeys well in advance, the price for customers might be much lower than the market currently indicates.\n\n“That gives them the flexibility to run those types of specials,” he said.\n\nFind AP Fact Checks here: https://apnews.com/APFactCheck.","summary":"With Thanksgiving less than three weeks away, the question of how much this year’s turkey and trimmings will cost looms large, especially with grocery prices 2.7% higher than they were in 2024","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/donald-trump-walmart-viktor-orban-facts-ceo-b2861183.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/11/07/22/Government_Shutdown_Food_Aid_76842.jpg?width=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-11-07 22:20:56","author":"Melissa Goldin","authors":["Melissa Goldin"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.194},{"id":376893274,"title":"Johnson urges UN panel to hold Trump accountable for 'human rights abuses'","text":"Arguing that “no country should be above international law,” Mayor Brandon Johnson urged the United Nations Human Rights Council on Friday to hold President Donald Trump’s administration accountable for what he called a “worsening human rights crisis in the United States.”\n\nIn a virtual appearance before the panel’s members meeting in Switzerland, Johnson invited U.N. experts to come to Chicago to witness firsthand abuses committed by Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents during raids he said have wreaked havoc in neighborhoods across the city and suburbs.\n\n“That is why I call on this council to hold the federal government of the United States to the same standards of accountability you apply elsewhere in the world,” Johnson said, urging the group to consider holding a special session on the matter. “Human rights are universal — or they are meaningless.”\n\nEarlier this week, Johnson condemned ICE agents for going inside a North Center preschool and “tearing a teacher out of a classroom in front of” toddlers.\n\nThe mayor said video of the incident “shocked the conscience of every single Chicagoan,” adding, “This is not who we are. We … cannot have this in our city or our country.”\n\nJohnson vowed to hold U.S. Border Patrol Commander-at-Large Gregory Bovino “accountable for the crimes you have committed against our people.”\n\nDuring his speech, Johnson accused the Trump administration of seeking to “evade scrutiny for its violations of human rights, just as it has sought to evade accountability for its actions in cities like mine,” by refusing to either submit to the U.N. Human Rights Council a Universal Periodic Review Report or appear before the panel. \n\n“This refusal to engage in good faith with international mechanisms for accountability and oversight is a moral failure,” the mayor said. “In Chicago, we live with that moral failure every day. Families torn apart by immigration raids. Raids that have targeted daycare teachers, ride-share drivers and restaurant cooks.”\n\nJohnson went on to describe in detail an immigration enforcement campaign in Chicago that he claimed has been “marked by violence” and is an “assault on the dignity of all Chicagoans.”\n\n“Federal agents drag parents out of their vehicles in the pickup line for elementary schools. They throw neighbors supporting neighbors to the ground and assault them,” Johnson said. “Right before Halloween, federal agents deployed tear gas on a children’s parade.”","url":"https://chicago.suntimes.com/immigration/2025/11/07/brandon-johnson-united-nations-panel-human-rights-abuses-ice-raids-donald-trump","image":"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/5c313a1/2147483647/strip/false/crop/3687x2459+0+0/resize/1486x991!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fec%2F81%2F3302c0a541e383ff149d88e6ee8f%2Ficesh","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-11-07 22:17:54","author":"Fran Spielman","authors":["Fran Spielman"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.036},{"id":376871796,"title":"Homeland Security OKs additional $155M for Helene recovery in N.C.","text":"Nov. 7 (UPI) -- The U.S. Department of Homeland Security has dispersed an additional $155 million for western North Carolina to fund 130 projects from Tropical Storm Helene.\n\nThe funding is the most allocated in the state for the storm, which struck the western Appalachian region Sept. 27, causing widespread river flooding and landslides with 30 inches of rain in some areas.

He hit 335 homers and had 1,000 RBIs and 221 stolen bases in 17 seasons.\n\nPlagued by later legal, health and personal problems, Strawberry was indicted for tax evasion and eventually pleaded guilty in 1995 to a single felony count. That was based on his failure to report $350,000 in income from autographs, personal appearances and sales of memorabilia.\n\nStrawberry agreed to pay more than $430,000 as part of the case.\n\nHe was diagnosed with colon cancer and underwent surgery and chemotherapy in 1998.\n\nThe following year, Strawberry was sentenced to probation and suspended from baseball after pleading no contest to charges of possession of cocaine and soliciting a prostitute. He eventually spoke in court about struggling with depression, and he was charged with violating his probation numerous times -- including on his 40th birthday in 2002.\n\nStrawberry ultimately served 11 months in Florida state prison and was released in 2003.\n\nA White House official said Friday that Trump approved a pardon for Strawberry, who had served time and paid back taxes. Speaking on background to detail a pardon that had not yet been formally announced, the official noted that Strawberry found faith in Christianity and has been sober for a decade-plus and that he had become active in ministry and started a still-active recovery center.\n\nStrawberry posted on Instagram a picture of himself and Trump and wrote, \"Thank you, President @realdonaldtrump for my full pardon and for finalizing this part of my life, allowing me to be truly free and clean from all of my past.\"\n\nHe described being home Thursday afternoon, caring for his wife who was recovering from surgery, \"when my phone kept ringing relentlessly.\"\n\n\"Half asleep, I glanced over and saw a call from Washington DC. Curious, I answered, and to my amazement, the lady on the line said, 'Darryl Strawberry, you have a call from the President of the United States, Donald Trump,'\" Strawberry wrote. \"I put it on speakerphone with my wife nearby, and President Trump spoke warmly about my baseball days in NYC, praising me as one the greatest player of the '80s and celebrating the Mets. Then, he told me he was granting me a full pardon from my past.\"\n\nTrump was a New York real estate mogul before becoming a reality television star and twice winning the presidency.\n\nStrawberry said he was \"overwhelmed with gratitude -- thanking God for setting me free from my past, helping me become a better Man, Husband and Father.\"\n\n\"This experience has deepened my faith and commitment to working for His kingdom as a true follower of Jesus Christ,\" Strawberry wrote, while also noting \"This has nothing to do with politics - it's about a Man, President Trump, caring deeply for a friend. God used him as a vessel to set me free forever!\"\n\nStrawberry's pardon followed Trump issuing pardons this week for a former Republican speaker of the Tennessee House and a onetime aide on public corruption charges. It adds to a list of celebrities and political allies who have similarly received unlikely pardons -- including a former Republican governor of Connecticut, an ex-GOP member of Congress and reality TV stars who had been convicted of cheating banks and evading taxes.\n\nStrawberry played for the Mets, New York Yankees, Los Angeles Dodgers and San Francisco Giants between 1983 and 1999. He won the World Series with the 1986 Mets, starring alongside the likes of Dwight Gooden and Keith Hernandez, and with the Yankees in 1996, 1998 and 1999.\n\nStrawberry was hospitalized with a heart attack in March 2024, a day before he turned 62. That same year, the Mets retired his No. 18 and an emotional Strawberry told the Citi Field crowd: \"I'm truly, deeply sorry that I ever left you guys. I never played baseball in front of fans greater than you guys.\"","summary":"President Donald Trump has pardoned former MLB great Darryl Strawberry, the 1983 NL Rookie of the Year and an eight-time All-Star, of tax evasion and drug charges dating back to the latter part of his playing career.","url":"https://www.espn.com/espn/story/_/id/46884107/trump-pardons-ex-mlb-star-strawberry-tax-evasion-drug-charges","image":"https://a.espncdn.com/photo/2024/0601/r1340474_1296x729_16-9.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-11-07 22:14:58","author":"Rob Demovsky","authors":["Rob Demovsky"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.192},{"id":376867282,"title":"Trump laughs after victory for Ukraine called a ‘miracle’","text":"Donald Trump met with Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban at the White House to discuss Hungary's reliance on Russian oil. \n\nTrump praised Orban as a \"great leader\", while Orban reciprocated, calling it a \"Golden Age\" in US-Hungarian relations. \n\nThe ongoing conflict in Ukraine was a key topic, with Orban suggesting \"miracles can happen\" regarding Ukraine's potential victory, a remark that prompted laughter from Trump. \n\nTrump expressed a desire for a summit with Russian President Putin, indicating it could still take place in Budapest. \n\nTrump also stated his belief that Russia would soon push for an end to the nearly four-year conflict, despite its significant troop losses.","summary":"Donald Trump met with Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban at the White House to discuss Hungary's reliance on Russian oil.","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/bulletin/news/president-trump-hungarian-prime-minister-ukriane-kyiv-b2861176.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/11/07/18/19/SEI273462722.jpeg?crop=8113.5,5409,x0.3,y0&trim=0,0,0,0&width=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/gnwYIOX4-4VHSaSK0.mp4","publish_date":"2025-11-07 22:14:47","author":"Arpan Rai,Maira Butt and James C.

It requests information on the number of interested vendors and what technology they can use to “maximize call efficiency.” ICE also issued another notice seeking information on vendors able to transport thousands of detainees daily from across Texas, where a new state law taking effect next year mandates all counties with a jail enter into ICE partnerships.\nThe proposed call centre and transport programs come as the government pours $170 billion into immigration and border security following the passage of the Republican Party’s big bill which President Donald Trump signed into law in July. There has been an explosion of partnerships with local and state law enforcement agencies to enforce immigration laws.\nThe Trump administration’s immigration crackdown has also included several policy changes focused on unaccompanied minors and ramped up attempts to deport them. About 2,000 unaccompanied children were in government custody as of July.\nAn unaccompanied migrant child is defined by the US government as someone who is under 18, lacks lawful immigration status and has no parent or guardian in the country to take custody of them.\nHundreds of thousands of unaccompanied minor children have traveled to the US southern border in recent years. When they enter the country, Border Patrol transfers the children to the care of the Office of Refugee Resettlement which houses them in a network of shelters across the country. They can be released from the shelter system to stay with sponsors who are generally parents, relatives or family friends.\nThe Trump administration has been conducting a nationwide review of the 450,000 migrant children who crossed the U.S.-Mexico border without their parents during President Joe Biden’s term. Federal agents have intensified scrutiny on migrant children’s sponsors, requiring them to submit to DNA tests and fingerprinting among other measures. While the administration has said these efforts are intended to ensure the safety, migrant advocates are dubious given Trump’s zero-tolerance approach to immigration and mass deportation agenda.\nThe ICE notice did not specify why the greater Nashville area was chosen as the intended site. But CoreCivic Inc., one of the largest private detention contractors in the US, is headquartered there. The company, which has donated millions to GOP candidates at all levels of government, has benefited from a surge in ICE contracts.\nA spokesperson for CoreCivic spokesperson did not comment on whether it would be contracted for the call center.\nICE is also searching for vendors capable of transporting detainees from anywhere in Texas, including hospitals, private residences and traffic stops, to one of 36 different ICE offices within 30 minutes.\nICE said it anticipates six trips daily transporting around 30 detainees in SUVs under armed guard from regional hubs near each county jail, according to federal contracting documents. The vendor would be required to establish its own transport hubs within six months of receiving a contract.\nThe Department of Homeland Security did not immediately respond to request for comment.
