The Duke of Sussex's visa became a topic of discussion after he disclosed in his 2023 memoir Spare that he had a history of drug use. This prompted The Heritage Foundation to question how Harry, now 40, managed to secure a US visa in 2020 given his past. The group campaigned for the release of his visa documents to determine whether he was dishonest about his past drug use or received preferential treatment from the Joe Biden administration. The heavily redacted court documents released this week, as ordered by a judge, revealed no evidence of government misconduct. However, it remains unclear whether Harry answered 'yes' or 'no' to questions regarding his history of drug use. Despite this uncertainty, one expert believes that regardless of the outcome, US President Donald Trump would not deport the father-of-two, who stepped down from Royal duties five years ago, due to more pressing matters, reports the Express . This is despite Trump's known disapproval of Harry and his wife Meghan Markle, 43, and his previous statement that he would not \"protect\" the duke if he lied on his visa documents - a claim that remains unproven. Alphonse Provinziano, a California family attorney, doubts that Trump will follow through on threats to deport Prince Harry, pointing out the complexity of such a process amidst more pressing concerns. Alphonse remarked: \"First, the process itself must be initiated, and there would likely be little reason to expedite Prince Harry's removal.\" He added: \"He is a contributing member of society, a war veteran, and actively involved in philanthropic work. Furthermore, his personal story is inspiring, and US public sentiment generally favours him.\" Alphonse elaborated that given the larger immigration issues facing the country: \"It seems unlikely that President-elect Trump would prioritise his removal for political reasons, even if questions about Harry's immigration status arise. \"President-elect Trump has made clear that his priority is removing the approximately 3,000 alleged criminal illegal aliens in the US, a process which may consume almost four years.\" Prince Harry, who has faced scrutiny over his visa since 2023, continues to express positive feelings about living in the US. In December, Harry voiced his gratitude for raising his children, Prince Archie, five, and Princess Lilibet, three, in the States, where the family resides in a lavish Montecito estate.","summary":"Prince Harry's US visa has been a cause of debate since he admitted in his 2023 memoir that he used to take drugs, with the Heritage Foundation questioning how he was able to get a US visa","url":"https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/entertainment/donald-trump-unlikely-deport-prince-34895777","image":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/article34895776.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200b/0_Separate-photos-of-Donald-Trump-and-Prince-Harry.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-03-20 00:55:33","author":"Jasmine Carey,Phoebe Tonks","authors":["Jasmine Carey","Phoebe Tonks"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.092},{"id":302028036,"title":"Nvidia chief confident chip maker can weather US tariffs","text":"Nvidia boss Jensen Huang expressed confidence Wednesday that the artificial intelligence (AI) chip giant can handle US President Donald Trump's trade war.\n\n\"We have a really agile network of suppliers; they are not just in Taiwan or Mexico or Vietnam,\" Huang said while meeting with journalists at Nvidia's annual developers conference in San Jose, California.\n\n\"If we add onshore manufacturing by the end of this year, we should be quite good.\"\n\nNvidia is not expecting tariffs to significantly affect its financial performance in the short term, according to Huang.\n\nHe noted that the tariff situation is evolving, and that what it does to Nvidia costs will depend on which countries are targeted by Trump.\n\nTrump has threatened to slap extra tariffs on imports of computer chips to the United States, which will heap pressure on Nvidia's business, which depends on imported components mainly from Taiwan.\n\nSince returning to power in January, Trump has imposed tariffs on Washington's three main trading partners, Mexico, Canada, and China.\n\nTrump has talked of imposing \"reciprocal tariffs\" against other countries in early April, creating uncertainty for businesses and financial markets.\n\nThe White House recently put out a release saying Trump is intent on making the US a \"manufacturing superpower,\" ramping up pressure to shift production back to this country.\n\nHowever, chip fabrication facilities can take years to build.\n\nSince its founding in 1993, Nvidia has specialized in graphics processing units (GPUs) coveted by video game enthusiasts.\n\nGPUs are also ideally suited for AI and the rise of that technology has catapulted the Silicon Valley-based chip maker into the spotlight.\n\n\"We're not making chips anymore; those were the good old days,\" Huang quipped. \"What we do now is build AI infrastructure.\"\n\nHigh-end versions of Nvidia's chips face US export restrictions to the major market of China, part of Washington's efforts to slow its Asian adversary's advancement in the strategic technology.\n\nAsked about this, Huang replied that his company is not alone in needing to respect each country's laws.\n\nSource: AFP","summary":"Nvidia boss Jensen Huang expressed confidence Wednesday that the artificial intelligence (AI) chip giant can handle US President Donald Trump's trade war.

With no apparent war other than the in-fighting between the top political actors in Rivers, it is a hasty and contentious decision with dangerous ramifications.\n\nAfter his hasty Inauguration Day “subsidy is gone” policy gone awry, the floatation of the naira and the threat to levy war on three ECOWAS countries for the coups there, this is another precipitate step by Tinubu. It is a political overdo.\n\nCiting the war of attrition between Governor Siminalayi Fubara and the state lawmakers, Tinubu initially suspended the executive and legislative political structure in Rivers. This is pregnant with meaning. It indicates that Fubara and the parliamentarians may be ousted indefinitely. This is harsh.\n\n“By this declaration, the Governor of Rivers State, Mr Siminalayi Fubara, his deputy, Mrs Ngozi Odu and all elected members of the House of Assembly of Rivers State are hereby suspended for an initial period of six months,” the President stated.\n\nIn the interim, he swore in Ibok-Ette Ibas, a retired Chief of Naval Staff, as the state administrator. The judiciary was spared.\n\nTwenty-seven members of the Rivers House of Assembly, led by Speaker Martin Amaewhule, have defied Fubara with backing from Nyesom Wike, the Minister of the Federal Capital Territory. Fubara succeeded Wike in May 2023 though there has been a war between the two parties since then.\n\nThe President, who met with the combatants twice to resolve the turmoil, said he relied on Section 305 of the 1999 Constitution for the suspension. He castigated Fubara repeatedly for the crisis.\n\nThis is unfair and one-sided. The bias shows through.\n\nIn all this, Fubara is cast as the bad boy; Wike, the lawmakers and the Federal Government as the angels.\n\nWhile Section 305 grants the President the mandate to declare a state of emergency in any part of Nigeria, it does not state the President can suspend the governor or the lawmakers. This is the crux of the matter.\n\nIn Section 188 of the Constitution, only the state House of Assembly can remove a governor through a well-defined legal process.\n\nSoldiers took over the Rivers Government House in Port Harcourt on Tuesday night, accompanied by tanks. This gives democracy a bad name. The President should not use every pretext to declare an emergency.\n\nThe declaration speaks volumes about Nigeria’s democracy and hollow federalism. The Nigerian President should not have absolute powers to declare a state of emergency. It creates fear and a sense of lack of independence among the sub-national governments.\n\nCan President Donald Trump remove a governor in America? If he does, the courts are there to quickly respond, which they have been doing with Trump’s immigration and federal employment policies.\n\nThe then-President Jonathan avoided this constitutional debacle in 2013 when he declared a state of emergency in Adamawa, Borno and Yobe States at the peak of the Boko Haram insurgency. Although Tinubu was among the critics who lampooned Jonathan for assaulting democracy then, it was a wiser decision.\n\nJonathan retained the three governors and the parliaments. He must have learnt from history.\n\nIn 2004, ex-President Olusegun Obasanjo declared a state of emergency in Plateau due to ethnic killings. Obasanjo ousted Joshua Dariye and appointed Chris Alli as administrator.\n\nDespite the outcry, Obasanjo repeated the declaration two years later in Ekiti when he suspended Ayo Fayose as governor and appointed Tunji Olurin as administrator.\n\nTherefore, the National Assembly should reject the suspension of Fubara and the legislators.\n\nSince September 2023, Fubara has been at loggerheads with his benefactor, Wike. Wike, a two-term governor of Rivers, has repeatedly castigated Fubara and the Ijaw people, escalating the turmoil with his intemperate rhetoric. Tinubu conveniently side-stepped this. \n\nThe President said, “It is my fervent hope that this inevitable intervention will help to restore peace and order in Rivers State by awakening all the contenders to the constitutional imperatives binding on all political players in Rivers State in particular and Nigeria as a whole.”\n\nWithout reining in Wike, this is wishful thinking. Instead of defusing tensions, the emergency will stoke further divisions. On Tuesday, militants blew up two oil pipelines in Rivers. It could be unrelated to the turmoil, but Nigeria will reportedly lose over $35 million daily to the two incidents.\n\nThis might reverse the gains of employing ex-militants in the Niger Delta to protect the oil assets from attacks.\n\nThe turmoil degenerated after the ruling by the Supreme Court on February 28. The court reinstated the 27 members of the Assembly. Although they had publicly defected to the All Progressives Congress, the Supreme Court overruled that, citing the withdrawal of the suit challenging their membership of the legislature by Fubara.\n\nThe Supreme Court stopped the monthly allocations to Rivers. This provoked instant tensions. The 27 lawmakers stopped Fubara from representing the 2025 budget and began impeachment proceedings against him. \n\nThe Attorney-General of the Federation, Lateef Fagbemi, the APC, the 27 lawmakers, and the Defence Minister, Bello Matawalle, have justified the imposition of an emergency on Rivers. They all blame Fubara. That is sycophancy.\n\nFubara alone cannot precipitate the turmoil. The state lawmakers and their backers deserve equal blame. Without making the legislators realise their belligerency and power-grab antics, the crisis will not decelerate.\n\nConversely, the Nigerian Bar Association and the main opposition figures, Atiku Abubakar and Peter Obi, have condemned the state of emergency. The New Nigerian People’s Party and 12 PDP governors are also against the emergency.\n\nTinubu should tread carefully by learning from history so as not to throw Nigeria’s democracy into jeopardy.\n\nThe seismic events of the First Republic refer. Due to the political turmoil in the Western Region between the premier, Ladoke Akintola, and his predecessor, Obafemi Awolowo in the Action Group, the Prime Minister, Tafawa Balewa declared a state of emergency in October 1962.\n\nBalewa appointed Moses Majekodunmi the sole administrator of the region for six months.\n\nIt was seen as hasty, an undue interference in the affairs of the region. The emergency worsened the volatile political turmoil.\n\nFirst, it instigated ‘Operation Wetie’, in which political thugs doused their opponents with fuel and burnt them and their property.\n\nAwolowo ended up in Calabar prison, convicted on trumped-up charges of treasonable felony.\n\nFour years later, the military used the pretext to overthrow the government on January 15, 1966. The soldiers slaughtered Balewa, Akintola, the Northern Premier, Ahmadu Bello, and other political leaders.\n\nThe first coup instigated another one a few months later, and the Biafra Civil War in 1967. Nigeria is still recovering from Balewa’s singular decision.\n\nTherefore, the NASS should not be Tinubu’s chorus boys. The lawmakers should critically weigh the pros and cons of Tinubu’s emergency declaration and decide to promote democracy in Nigeria.\n\nThe NASS might approve the state of emergency but should reject the suspension of Fubara, his deputy and the lawmakers.\n\nTinubu and Co. should stop their threats against the Fubara camp and sincerely work towards a political solution by first sanctioning Wike and cautioning the assembly members.","summary":"TWELVE years after Goodluck Jonathan declared a state of emergency in three North-East states due to Boko Haram Islamic terrorism, President Bola Tinubu repeated it in Rivers State on Tuesday.

Kennedy have revealed details of a Soviet KGB defector called 'the most valuable' turncoat the CIA ever had. \n\nThe release early Tuesday evening included 2,182 PDF documents totaling 63,400 pages on the National Archives website more than 60 years after the president was shot and killed in Dallas.\n\nWhile there were few immediate bombshells found, one of the files with some intrigue pertain to Anatoliy Golitsyn, who used the code name 'Stone' and under the alias 'John Stone.'\n\nCIA Counter-intelligence Director James Angleton and writer Sir John Hackett both termed Golitsyn 'the most valuable defector ever to reach the West.'\n\nAmong the files released include statements from Golitsyn's administrative assistant Donald Deneslya, who spoke about the work done by Golitsyn. \n\nNewly unredacted pages show that Golitsyn was given a settlement of $200,000 by the CIA as well as protection. \n\nGolitsyn wrote about his experience as a defector in two books released during and after the Cold War. \n\nHe was also provided a Virginia residence, located near the CIA's headquarters in Langley. \n\nDeneslya was a CIA operative - which Golitsyn was aware of - working undercover as a Georgetown University student while he helped Golitsyn write one of his books. \n\nHe said Golitsyn 'turned up traitors in many Western countries,' including Swedish and West German generals. \n\nGolitsyn, who died in 2008, supplied information about several Soviet spies and revealed how deeply the KGB had infiltrated governments in France and other Western nations. \n\nThe files included typewritten reports and handwritten notes spanning decades, including details of a top CIA agent who claimed the deep state was responsible, Lee Harvey Oswald being a 'poor shot' and that Secret Service had been warned Kennedy would be killed in August, three months before the murder.\n\nThe rollout of the files stunned Trump's national security team, who spent 24 hours racing to assess security hazards ahead of publication.\n\nWhen the files were released at around 7pm, it sparked widespread backlash, from liberals claiming it was just a repeat of a similar drop by Joe Biden years ago, to MAGA fans angered that the pages still contained redactions and left questions, leading experts to describe the files as 'impenetrable.'\n\nExperts have warned as they sift through the information that they do not expect the release to overturn the long understanding of what happened or earth-shattering reveals.\n\nThe document batch did not include annotations, what agency documents originated from, how they were linked together or whether they were found more credible than others to the investigation. \n\nIts publication represents the fulfillment of a campaign promise from Trump, who had threatened to get the files out dating back to his first term in office. \n\nWhile Trump's team was working on getting the records out since the president returned to the White House in January, those plans were put into overdrive on Monday.\n\nThe president said during a media event at the Kennedy Center that the files were all going to be released on Tuesday. \n\nNational security analysts were scrambling to make sure there were no hazards in what they were about to publish with a supercharged deadline. \n\nCIA Director John Ratcliffe had wanted to have everyone prepped on what was in the documents so that they wouldn't be caught off guard, the New York Times reports.\n\nThe National Security Council put together an emergency call to make everyone aware of what they still had to un-redact. \n\nMany had worries that confidential information would be revealed about people who were still alive. \n\nKaroline Leavitt, the White House press secretary, scoffed at the notion that anyone was left unaware that this was coming. \n\n'President Trump made a promise to release all of the JFK. files — and he is delivering on that promise. Anyone surprised by this hasn't been paying attention or has been willfully ignorant.' \n\nHistorians speaking to the mainstream media have suggested there's not much new out there in the JFK files and what's been released is disorganized and will be hard to parse through regardless. \n\nDirector of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard also claimed on X that Trump was 'ushering in a new era of maximum transparency' and that the files were being released 'with no redactions.'\n\nThe files on JFK weren't the only ones released, as documents pertaining to the assassinations of both Kennedy's brother Robert and Dr. Martin Luther King.\n\nLeading up to its release, Trump said it would be 'interesting' and the White House said Americans would be 'shocked' by revelations.\n\n'People have been waiting for decades for this,' Trump said on Monday. 'We have a tremendous amount of paper. You've got a lot of reading.'\n\nTrump was for releasing the JFK files during his first term in office but thousands remained under seal.\n\nDuring his 2024 campaign he vowed to make them public as part of his overall effort to increase government transparency.\n\nHe signed an executive order in January to declassify the remaining files.","summary":"Newly-unveiled files related to the 1963 assassination of John F.

As a result, OpenAI and Google called for tech firms to be allowed to take copyrighted works without permission or payment to train their AI models.\n\nThey claimed this was in the national interest, and even urged Mr Trump to lean on Britain and the EU to follow suit.\n\nBut experts warn that the proposal will devastate the cultural industry without leading to any advances in the most important capabilities AI offers in defence, health and science.\n\nFor years AI firms have been ‘scraping’ – or collecting – art, books, music and other online data to train their models without paying for it. The companies can then create their own works of art and profit from them.\n\nCopyright laws give artists automatic protection and allow compensation if their work is taken. A landmark US case found this year that AI firms should pay for copyrighted material.\n\nBut tech companies have lobbied Washington to loosen copyright laws so they can stay ahead of China’s AI progress.\n\nArtists said this idea was ‘gaining alarming traction’ and warned: ‘America’s global AI leadership must not come at the expense of our essential creative industries.\n\n‘It is clear that Google (valued at $2 trillion) and OpenAI (valued at over $157 billion) are arguing for a special government exemption so they can freely exploit America’s creative and knowledge industries, despite their substantial revenues and available funds.\n\n‘AI companies can use our copy-righted material by simply doing what the law requires – negotiating appropriate licenses with copyright holders, just as every other industry does. This issue goes well beyond the entertainment industry, as the right to train AI on all copyright-protected content impacts all of America’s knowledge industries.’\n\nThe Mail is campaigning against Labour’s plan to give AI firms a copyright exception in the UK. Stars including Sir Elton John and Simon Cowell have written powerful editorials in the Mail urging ministers to reconsider.\n\nThe Government says it has not made up its mind on the issue.\n\nBen StillerGoogleOpenAIBette Midler\n\nShare or comment on this article:\nHollywood stars call on Donald Trump to make AI pay for their work amid tech row \n\nAdd comment","summary":"Cate Blanchett, Ben Stiller, Chris Rock, Phoebe Waller-Bridge and Bette Midler are among 400 actors, film-makers, writers and musicians urging his administration to resist lobbying by Silicon Valley.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-14517475/Hollywood-stars-Donald-Trump-AI.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/03/20/00/96375499-0-image-m-37_1742429588167.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-03-20 00:42:23","author":"Andy Jehring,Editor","authors":["Andy Jehring","Editor"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":0.062},{"id":302023926,"title":"World News | JFK Assassination Files Declassified to Restore Citizens' Trust on US Intelligence: White House Press Secretary","text":"Washington DC [US], March 20 (ANI): White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said US President Donald Trump has pledged to restore public trust in the intelligence community, and as part of his commitment, he has declassified and published 80,000 pages of previously classified documents related to the assassination of former US President John F Kennedy.\n\"President Trump also promised maximum transparency and commitment to rebuild the trust of the American people in our intelligence community.

Kennedy have been released by the Trump administration, giving historians, amateurs and conspiracy theorists another shot at uncovering revelations about the killing that still fascinates America, more than six decades later.\n\nThe two batches of documents made public on Tuesday came to about 63,400 pages, according to the National Archives, though it was unclear how many of those files were actually new, or had previously been released in part or in whole, or if there still could be more released later in the week, the New York Times reported. \n\nOfficials have said that nearly all government records relating — sometimes very tangentially — to the Kennedy assassination were already public. NYT estimates this might be one of the last releases of the Kennedy papers, considering that only about 1 per cent of the six million pages in the government’s possession remains undisclosed.\n\nThe latest records were released through an executive order signed by President Donald Trump in January. That order also directed the nation’s security agencies to disclose any remaining documents related to the assassinations of Senator Robert F. Kennedy and Dr Martin Luther King Jr in 1968.\n\n One newly un-redacted memo details how CIA operatives were posted abroad as ‘State Dept employees’\n\nThe new documents are not published in any organised fashion, and clicking each file on the National Archive’s website can feel like opening a box of messy, unrelated papers, wrote NYT’s Talya Minsberg.\n\nSome files are one page and fairly straightforward. Others are almost 700 pages and stuffed with handwritten notes, diplomatic cables and images, while some documents are completely illegible.\n\nSome may turn out to be full versions of documents previously available with only light redactions, adding a name or two to the record. Others, scholars say, are likely to be duplicates or variants of memos and reports that have long been available from other sources.\n\nAlthough experts don’t really expect to find any bombshells, that doesn’t mean there won’t be interesting details, particularly for scholars of the workings of intelligence agencies.\n\nFor example, as NYT’s Isabelle Taft noted, it’s no secret that the CIA has long placed agents undercover as State Department officials.\n\nBut a newly unredacted portion of a 1961 memo to President Kennedy describes how the agency had placed about 1,500 agents overseas as State Department employees. \n\nThe aide who authored the memo, Arthur Schlesinger, Jr., wrote that the practice, which was originally meant to be temporary and limited, was threatening the State Depa-rtment’s control of foreign policy.\n\n“In the Paris Embassy today, there are 128 CIA people,” Schlesinger wrote to Kennedy. “CIA occupies the top floor of the Paris Embassy, a fact well known locally; and on the night of the Generals’ revolt in Algeria, passers-by noted with amusement that the top floor was ablaze with lights.”\n\nDaniel Alcorn, president of the Assassination Archives and Resea-rch Center — the largest private collection of material related to the Kennedy assassination – speculated that the newly released portion of Schlesinger’s memo to Kennedy about the practice had long been redacted because it confirmed the CIA’s cover arrangements. \n\n“I guess they consider that a matter of secrecy,” he said. “They really just didn’t want the embarrassment or the negative attention.”\n\nThe release, so far, appears to contain little new information about the JFK assassination, and significantly less about the killing of Dr Martin Luther King Jr.\n\nOnly a few dozen PDFs of the 1,123 initially released refer to King. Some describe investigations into his murder, which happened at a Memphis hotel on April 4, 1968.\n\nThe details, several of which appear to have been previously disclosed, mention that sources in Mexico City and Nigeria believed they had seen someone who resembled King’s assassin, James Earl Ray. \n\nThe documents also describe two American citizens who were detained in Panama City in connection with the murder but ultimately were not charged.\n\nA Berkeley physician also came under suspicion, having been “a chronic letter writer to the CIA criticizing them and the government,” according to one memo in the tranche.\n\nThe documents reflect both the FBI’s and the CIA’s known fixation on Dr King and his association with left-wing activists, which came at a time when J. Edgar Hoover, the director of the FBI, was trying to undermine the civil rights movement.\n\nPublished in Dawn, March 20th, 2025","summary":"TWO sets of documents related to the assassination of US president John F.

That dramatic escalation followed the Trump administration’s gutting of the organisation’s board last week. \n\nA declaration filed as part of the lawsuit from the institute’s chief security officer alleges that the one USIP employee who “possesses the technological capability to access the Infrastructure and to grant others access” was traveling to Washington, DC, “at the behest of DOGE … in order to access the Infrastructure and grant access to DOGE as soon as the evening of March 18, 2025”. \n\nAnother memorandum of support stated that “USIP also has reason to believe that Defendants or those working in concert with them are currently in the USIP building, causing physical damage to the premises and physically accessing and disposing of USIP financial records”. \n\nThe complaint argues the administration’s actions, including alleged destruction and modification of files, are causing “irreparable harm” against USIP. It asks the court to block the “trespass by Defendants against real and personal property belonging to the Institute”.\n\nPhotos posted to social media platforms showed that the organisation’s name and emblem had been removed from its Washington headquarters.\n\nThe complaint specifically calls on the court to declare the Trump administration’s efforts to oust the USIP board of directors and its acting president “null and void”. It asks for an injunction saying that those individuals may not be removed unless the court finds that it complies with the law and gives its “express permission”. \n\nHowever, NBC News quoted White House spokeswoman Anna Kelly as saying that President Trump “signed an executive order to reduce USIP to its statutory minimum” and that “11 board members were lawfully removed” before three board members appointed Jackson acting president of the organisation.\n\nUnder the USIP Act, most of the bipartisan board of directors is appointed by the president “with the advice and consent of the Senate”. Last week, the White House said they were terminating most of those members, who include President Donald Trump’s former ambassador to Russia. According to the lawsuit, the termination emails from the White House Office of Presidential Personnel “did not state any justification for the purported terminations”.\n\nThe three remaining members of the board — Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth, Secretary of State Marco Rubio and National Defense University President Peter Garvin — said they were removing the acting president, Amb. George Moose and installing Trump appointee Kenneth Jackson.\n\nUSIP, which was established under President Ronald Reagan, employs 414 employees and personal services contractors, is present in 26 countries, and has seven field offices. Its main building is owned by an independent nonprofit corporation and was constructed from “private gifts and contributions,” according to the suit.\n\nPublished in Dawn, March 20th, 2025","summary":"THE United States Institute of Peace (USIP) — an independent non-profit established by Congress 40 years ago — has asked a US judge to immediately block the Department of Government Efficiency’s (DOGE) attempt to forcibly shut the organisation’s offices.\n\n\n\nAccording to CNN, a lawsuit filed on Tuesday in the DC district court seeks “the immediate intervention of this Court to stop Defendants from completing the unlawful dismantling of the Institute and irreparably impairing Plaintiffs’ ability to perform their vital peace promotion and conflict resolution work as tasked by Congress”. \n\n\n\nThe suit was filed after DOGE personnel, accompanied by DC police officers, gained access to the USIP on Monday after being turned away last week.

It was not immediately clear where Riibe traveled after leaving the Dominican Republic. According to a statement from Guzmán Ariza, Abogados Consultores, the law firm representing the Riibe family, the La Altagracia prosecutor's office offered to return Joshua's passport. “While appreciating the offer, Joshua opted to obtain a new passport from the U.S. consulate for privacy reasons, which was expedited,” the law firm said. Also Read | Donald Trump Holds Telephonic Conversation With Volodymyr Zelenskyy After Call With Vladimir Putin, Suggests 'US Should Take Ownership of Ukrainian Power Plants for Security'. Riibe had been detained by Dominican police, but on Tuesday judge Rijo ordered his release, saying he could cooperate with authorities without being detained. He was not named as a suspect. According to the transcript of an interview with prosecutors, reported by Dominican media as well as NBC and Telemundo, Riibe told police he was drinking with Konanki on the beach and they were kissing in the ocean when they got caught in a current. Riibe said he was a former lifeguard and helped bring her ashore. He told investigators he vomited upon reaching the beach and that Konanki said she was going to fetch her things. When he looked up, she was gone. He said he was later surprised to hear of her disappearance. On Monday, Konanki's parents asked Dominican authorities to declare their daughter legally dead. Subbarayudu and Sreedevi Konanki said in a letter that after an extensive search, local authorities believe that Sudiksha, 20, drowned. “Initiating this process will allow our family to begin the grieving process and address matters related to her absence,” they wrote. “While no declaration can truly ease our grief, we trust that this step will bring some closure and enable us to honor her memory.” Michael Chapman, sheriff of Loudoun County in Virginia, where the Konankis live, said in a statement Tuesday that officials have been working with Dominican authorities and continue to review evidence in the case. “The disappearance of Sudiksha Konanki is tragic, and we cannot imagine the grief her family has been feeling,” he said. “Sudiksha's family has expressed their belief that she drowned. While a final decision to make such a declaration rests with authorities in the Dominican Republic, we will support the Konanki family in every way possible.” Sudiksha Konanki and five female friends had traveled to the Caribbean nation on March 3 for spring break. Police said she disappeared at a beach by her hotel before dawn on March 6. Konanki was born in India and later became a U.S. permanent resident.

I’ve already endorsed President Trump,” Bannon told NewsNation’s Chris Cuomo on Wednesday. \n\n“A man like this comes along once every century if we’re lucky. We’ve got him now. He’s on fire, and I’m a huge supporter. I want to see him again in 2028,” he added. \n\nAsked how Trump would bypass the constitutional ban on a third term, Bannon replied, “We’re working on it.”\n\n“I think we’ll have a couple of alternatives, let’s say that. We’ll see what the definition of term limit is,” the former Breitbart News chairman said. \n\n“We’ve had greater longshots than Trump 2028. We’ve got a lot of stuff we’re working on. We’re not prepared to talk about it publicly. \n\nWhen asked if he was implying a violent revolution or an insurrection, Bannon said, “No. We are big believers in democracy.” The strategist said that the Trump supporters intend to mobilize their voting base, including low-propensity and low-information voters. \n\nTrump has repeatedly joked about the possibility that he could serve more than two terms. In January, he told a crowd of supporters in Nevada, “It will be the greatest honor of my life to serve, not once but twice or three times or four times.”\n\nEarlier this year, Republican Congressman Andy Ogles proposed to amend the Constitution to allow presidents who did not serve two consecutive terms to serve three terms in total. “It is imperative that we provide President Trump with every resource necessary to correct the disastrous course set by the Biden administration,” Ogles said in January.\n\nTrump was first elected in 2016, defeating former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. He ran for reelection in 2020 but lost to former Vice President Joe Biden. Trump won his second term last year, defeating Biden’s hand-picked successor, Kamala Harris.The two-term restriction was included in the Constitution in response to Franklin D. Roosevelt’s unprecedented four-term presidency.

as Trump moves closer to Putin","text":"NEW YORK/BERLIN: Several US national security agencies have halted work on a coordinated effort to counter Russian sabotage, disinformation and cyberattacks, easing pressure on Moscow as the Trump Administration pushes Russia to end its war in Ukraine.\n\nFormer President Joe Biden last year ordered his national security team to establish working groups to monitor the issue amid warnings from US intelligence that Russia was escalating a shadow war against Western nations.\n\nThe plan was led by the president’s National Security Council (NSC) and involved at least seven national security agencies working with European allies to disrupt plots targeting Europe and the United States, seven former officials who participated in the working groups told Reuters.\n\nBefore President Donald Trump was inaugurated, his incoming administration was briefed by Biden officials about the efforts and urged to continue monitoring Russia’s hybrid warfare campaign, the former US officials said.\n\nHowever, since Trump took office on Jan. 20 much of the work has come to a standstill, according to eleven current and former officials, all of whom requested anonymity to discuss classified matters. Reuters is the first to report on the full extent of the Biden administration effort and how multiple different US agencies have since paused their work on the issue.\n\nRegular meetings between the National Security Council and European national security officials have gone unscheduled, and the NSC has also stopped formally coordinating efforts across US agencies, including with the FBI, the Department of Homeland Security and the State Department, the current and former officials said.\n\nReuters could not determine whether the president has ordered the administration to halt all its work monitoring and combatting Russia’s campaign, whether agencies were still working to hire additional staff, or if they are making their own policy decisions independent of the White House.\n\nSome officials involved in the working groups said they are concerned that the Trump administration is de-prioritizing the issue despite intelligence warnings. The change follows the unwinding of other Russia-focused projects launched by Biden’s administration.\n\nThe FBI last month ended an effort to counter interference in US elections by foreign adversaries including Russia and put on leave staff working on the issue at the Department of Homeland Security. The Department of Justice also disbanded a team that seized the assets of Russian oligarchs.\n\nThe White House has not told career officials who’d previously participated in the effort whether it will recreate the cross-agency working groups, according to the current US officials.\n\nIt is unclear to what extent the US is still sharing intelligence related to the sabotage campaign with European allies. UK government officials said that routine intelligence sharing between the United States and the British government continues.\n\nWhen asked for comment about the suspension of the coordinated efforts, the White House deferred to the NSC.\n\nBrian Hughes, spokesperson for the National Security Council, said that it coordinates “with relevant agencies to assess and thwart threats posed to Americans.”\n\n“President Trump has made it abundantly clear that any attack on the US will be met with a disproportionate response,” he said.\n\nA senior US official at NATO said the US was still coordinating with its allies on the issue but declined to offer more detail. The CIA, FBI and the State Department declined to comment.\n\nAnitta Hipper, EU Spokesperson for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, said she had no specific information to share when asked about the suspension of some intelligence-sharing meetings.","summary":"NEW YORK/BERLIN: Several US national security agencies have halted work on a coordinated effort to counter Russian sabotage, disinformation and cyberattacks, easing pressure on Moscow as the Trump Administration pushes Russia to end its war in Ukraine.\n\n\nFormer President Joe Biden last year ordered his national security team to establish working groups to monitor the issue amid warnings from US intelligence that Russia was escalating a shadow war against Western nations.\n\n\nThe plan was led by the president’s National Security Council (NSC) and involved at least seven national security agencies working with European allies to disrupt plots targeting Europe and the United States, seven former officials who participated in the working groups told Reuters.\n\n\nBefore President Donald Trump was inaugurated, his incoming administration was briefed by Biden officials about the efforts and urged to continue monitoring Russia’s hybrid warfare campaign, the former US officials said.\n\n\nHowever, since Trump took office on ","url":"https://www.brecorder.com/news/40353766/us-suspends-some-efforts-to-counter-russian-sabotage-as-trump-moves-closer-to-putin","image":"https://i.brecorder.com/large/2025/03/20002009e281034.jpg?r=002013","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-03-20 00:30:54","author":"Reuters","authors":["Reuters"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"pk","sentiment":-0.16},{"id":302025630,"title":"US Federal Reserve keeps interest rates steady amid Trump's tariff chaos","text":"The US Federal Reserve has kept the country's interest rates unchanged as central bank officials weigh the impact of President Donald Trump's aggressive economic agenda.\n\nThe decision on Wednesday (Thursday AEDT), which comes at the conclusion of the Fed's two-day monetary policy meeting, shows that central bankers are waiting for evidence that inflation is headed toward their 2 per cent target — or that the economy is weakening more than expected. Those are the two outcomes that would put rate cuts back on the table.\n\nOfficials still expect to trim borrowing costs twice this year, according to their latest economic projections released on Wednesday, though eight officials are predicting one or no cuts this year, compared with only four who expected that in December.\n\nREAD MORE: Donald Trump is implementing steel and aluminium tariffs for Australia. How hard will it hit our economy?\n\nFed Chair Jerome Powell in his post-meeting news conference acknowledged the high level of uncertainty among American consumers and businesses — a lot of it stemming from the Trump administration's \"turmoil,\" he said. Powell said that \"it remains seen how these developments affect future spending and investment.\"\n\nThe Fed's key borrowing rate remains in the 4.25 per cent to 4.5 per cent range. Keeping them on hold also allows policymakers to see how the Trump administration's flurry of policy changes ultimately affects the US economy, he said . That includes hefty tariffs, mass deportations and a downsizing of the federal workforce.\n\nIn recent speeches, officials have said they're willing to adjust interest rates in either direction, depending on what economic figures show.\n\nThe Fed's latest pause marks the second time in a row that the central bank held borrowing costs steady.\n\nFed policymakers also expect the economy to be weaker this year than previously thought, according to the projections. They also forecast inflation to be higher this year.\n\nREAD MORE: Millions of Australians to receive boost to Centrelink payments from today\n\nTo put it simply, as the Trump administration sets out to enact structural changes, Fed officials see the US economy trending toward \"stagflation,\" a troubling combination of sluggish or negative growth and accelerating inflation. It remains to be seen whether the US economy ultimately slips into a period of outright stagflation, which last occurred in the 1970s.\n\nAll 12 Fed officials with voting power voted in favour of Wednesday's decision to hold interest rates steady, though Fed Governor Christopher Waller dissented to a decision to slow the pace of the central bank's offloading of securities on its balance sheet.\n\nHere are key takeaways from the Fed's latest decision as Trump proceeds with significant policy changes.\n\nPowell on Trump's policies and where the economy stands\n\nTrump's policies remain a huge wild card for the Fed because of their potentially wide-ranging effects on the economy. As expected, Powell was peppered with questions from reporters on how the Fed is assessing Trump's policy changes and he said it's still an evolving situation with many unknowns.\n\nTrump's tariffs threaten higher inflation and weaker growth, his administration's aggressive crackdown on immigration can cause labour shortages in certain industries, his mass layoffs of federal workers could send some local economies into a recession, but his deregulation efforts and the extension of his 2017 tax cuts could promote growth. Put together, it's unclear what the \"net effect\" of Trump's policies on the US economy will be, as measured by growth, inflation and the labour market.\n\nPowell said Trump's tariffs was a factor contributing to officials's higher inflation forecasts for this year, but he noted that it's difficult to gauge how much of the higher inflation expected this year will be due to Trump's trade war.\n\nREAD MORE: Government pledges to slash medicine prices if re-elected\n\nEarlier this month, Powell said officials will be guided by what economic statistics ultimately show, not what forecasts predict. The Fed leader said that data shows there's been a \"a moderation in consumer spending.\"\n\nWhile American shoppers might finally be pulling back some, the US labour market remains a sturdy pillar of strength for the economy. In February, unemployment stood at a low 4.1 per cent as employers added a healthy 151,000 jobs. And new applications for unemployment benefits, often an early indicator of any shifts in the labour market, remain historically low.\n\nIndeed, Powell pointed to the jobs market's resilience as a key bright spot in the US economy, adding that any unexpected weakening could force central bankers to resume cutting sooner.\n\n\"Labour market conditions are solid,\" Powell said.\n\nWhen asked to weigh in on the odds of a recession, which some economists say have grown in recent weeks, Powell said those chances haven't risen to concerning levels yet.\n\n\"Forecasters have generally raised — a number of them have raised their possibility of a recession somewhat. But still at relatively moderate levels,\" he said. \"If you go back two months, people were saying that the likelihood of a recession was extremely low. So it has moved, but it's not high.\"\n\nPowell on America's souring mood and its implications\n\nThe so-called \"hard data\" that captures actual economic activity remains solid, but Trump's agenda has already shown up clearly across various sentiment surveys, or \"soft data,\" Powell said.\n\nOn America's souring economic mood, Powell said it's not clear how that will affect spending, which powers 70 per cent of the US economy.\n\n\"The relationship between the survey data and economic activity hasn't been very tight,\" he said. \"There are times people are saying very downbeat things about the economy and then going out and buying a new car.\"\n\nBut not only are American businesses and consumers growing pessimistic about the economy, but they're also expecting inflation to ratchet higher and remain elevated in the coming years, according to the University of Michigan's latest consumer survey.\n\nIf long-term inflation expectations continue to climb, that could force the Fed to consider raising interest rates. In 2018 during Trump's first trade war, rising inflation expectations was a key factor that Fed officials pointed to that would force them consider hiking interest rates, according to a declassified document detailing policy alternatives, known as the \"teal book.\"","summary":"T﻿he central bank is keeping all options on the table amid the &quot;turmoil&quot; unleashed by Donald Trump&#x27;s radical reshaping of the US economy.","url":"https://www.9news.com.au/world/federal-reserve-keeps-us-interest-rates-on-hold-cuts-growth-outlook/2ec673c9-9faa-4939-8eb8-4d4b22b6f92a","image":"https://imageresizer.static9.net.au/tuTVleXRwazOaFjSNQemrMlKjxg=/0x0:7698x4330/750x422/https%3A%2F%2Fprod.static9.net.au%2Ffs%2F773ced52-ee99-4f68-a0cc-4b3d85d5bcd1","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-03-20 00:30:35","author":"9News","authors":["9News"],"language":"en","source_country":"AU","sentiment":-0.276},{"id":302024138,"title":"Black eye for BlackRock-Hutchison Panama ports deal? Not so easy, say experts","text":"As scrutiny mounts over Hong Kong-based CK Hutchison’s sale of its Panama ports, experts say there is a patent lack of legal tools governing commercial transactions that authorities can use to stop the deal and they are highly sceptical the national security legislation will be invoked.\nBut the conglomerate owned by tycoon Li Ka-shing’s family would have to ensure full compliance with rules governing listed companies and secure the green light from its shareholders for the deal, they said.\nHutchison has been beset by escalating warnings from the pro-establishment camp in the city after Beijing’s agencies overseeing Hong Kong reposted scathing commentaries by a newspaper urging it to reconsider the sale to a consortium led by US investment firm BlackRock, the world’s biggest asset manager.\nIn a surprise move earlier this month, CK Hutchison announced it was selling all its port stakes, except for those in China, which would give the consortium control of the two ports in the Panama Canal and 41 others across 23 countries.\nThe deal will mean the consortium paying US$23 billion and the Li subsidiary walking away with US$19 billion in cash.\nAsked about the deal on Tuesday, Chief Executive John Lee Ka-chiu said society’s concerns over the sale deserved attention and the transaction “must comply with the legal and regulatory requirements” as he urged foreign governments not to engage in “abusive use of coercion or bullying tactics” in international trade relations.\nThe comments fuelled talk already spreading in some circles that the authorities were reviewing the deal as debate centred on the laws that could be invoked if Hong Kong or mainland authorities did actually scrutinise it.\n\nRegina Ip Lau Suk-yee, convenor of the government’s key decision-making Executive Council, on Wednesday said it would be hard for both mainland and local authorities to intervene in the deal as it did not involve any ports in China.\n“Of course, the ports being sold involve a lot of countries, these other countries could have an opinion towards the deal,” she said.\nIp said that from a commercial aspect, the purchase agreement struck by CK Hutchison was a “very good deal” for the company and that it allowed it to avoid the pressure it was facing from the United States.\nShe said Beijing was only expressing its opinion towards the transaction and it could not affect the deal going forward.\n“If CK Hutchison is to be faulted in any way, it failed to take into account national interests and national reaction before entering into a deal,” she said.\nIp noted that the Hong Kong government could have reached out to Hutchison after the US started putting pressure on Panama, adding that it had a responsibility to see if the company needed any help.\nBarrister and New People’s Party lawmaker Eunice Yung Hoi-yan said “coercion” could be one of the elements to be studied if one wanted to review the sale, highlighting how Lee had used the term when he spoke on the deal.\nOfficial comments from a Chinese foreign ministry spokeswoman and a commentary in pro-Beijing newspaper Ta Kung Pao also cited the use of “coercion” over the sale.\n“If there are concerns about the use of coercion in this particular sale, it is likely to fall under the purview of contract law and the principles of duress, rather than the national security law,” Yung said.\nThe transaction by the Hong Kong-listed company would also be subject to listing rules that covered disclosure requirements, shareholder approval and connected transactions, she noted.\n“CK Hutchison will need to ensure compliance with these rules and disclose relevant information to the Hong Kong stock exchange and its shareholders,” Yung said.\nWhen it announced the deal, CK Hutchison said the transaction was considered a “very substantial disposal” for the company and therefore would be subject to the notification, announcement, circular and shareholder approval requirements under Chapter 14 of the listing rules.\n\nLawyer Dominic Wai Siu-chung, who specialises in commercial litigation as well as regulatory and compliance areas, said the “doctrine of duress” usually related to a contract that might become void if it could be proved that it was entered into due to duress and not by the party’s free volition.\n“It usually applies against the party that caused the duress or knows that the party was under duress when entering the contract,” he said.\nWai said the doctrine would usually be raised by the contractual party that wanted to get out of the contract.\nThe lawyer said that both contractual parties could agree on which laws – those of Hong Kong, the US or other countries – the contract should be set against.\n“There are not any obvious tools that can be used to change the deal as Hong Kong has been a very free place for business transactions,” Wai said.\nProfessor Simon Young Ngai-man from the law faculty of the University of Hong Kong (HKU) said the Protection of Trading Interests Ordinance (Cap 471) might have some relevance.\nCap 471 could apply if a foreign country imposed an extraterritorial measure that might be deemed damaging to the trading interests of Hong Kong. Under the ordinance, the chief executive has the power to prohibit a Hong Kong company from complying with such a foreign measure.\nOnline discussion about the sale had thrown up speculation that the national security law could be a last resort measure. Asked if this was possible, Young said an inquiry might be needed to determine whether the sale amounted to collusion under the Beijing-imposed legislation and the espionage offence under the domestic security law.\nArticle 29(2) of the Beijing-decreed national security law stipulates that collusion occurs if a person conspires with an external organisation to seriously disrupt the implementation of policies of the Hong Kong or central government, which is likely to cause serious consequences.\n“Could it be said the sale of the port assets will seriously disrupt the central government’s policies and likely cause serious consequences? It would need to be shown the person intended to bring about such consequences,” Young argued.\n\nLau Siu-kai, a consultant to the semi-official Chinese Association of Hong Kong and Macau Studies think tank, said the Hong Kong government was very unlikely to intervene using the two national security laws.\nHe said that any intervention would have to come from Beijing, which could employ diplomatic or political actions on top of legal measures.\n“Beijing will have to consider a lot of things if it intervenes, such as whether it will affect people coming to mainland China and Hong Kong to invest,” he said.\n“It needs to consider a lot of things at the same time before it can establish the appropriate solution.”\nThe ports deal was announced on March 4, coinciding with the opening of the annual meeting of the Chinese People’s Political Consultative Conference, the country’s top political advisory body.\nUS President Donald Trump hailed BlackRock’s deal, saying Washington would be “reclaiming” the canal from Chinese control. Hutchison had come under pressure for months after Trump won re-election to the White House.\nAccording to Xinhua news agency, a delegation led by Ma Hui, a vice-minister of the Communist Party’s diplomacy arm, the International Department, visited Panama last week, holding talks with “leaders of major political parties” and think tanks.\nBeijing remained silent about the deal for almost a week until its offices overseeing Hong Kong affairs reposted a commentary by Ta Kung Pao, which described the business decision as a hegemonic act in which the US used “despicable means including coercion, pressure and inducements” to harm interests of another country.\nThat was followed by another commentary along similar lines.\nOn Tuesday, Chinese foreign ministry spokeswoman Mao Ning weighed in, highlighting the country’s firm opposition to “economic coercion and bullying” when asked about an investigation mainland authorities were reportedly carrying out on the deal.\nHutchison’s shares have dropped 7.28 per cent since the first Ta Kung Pao commentary was published on March 13. On Thursday, it will take the unusual step of not holding press briefings after announcing its year-end results.\nAdditional reporting by Jeffie Lam","summary":"Legal tools to smash the sale are not really available as Hong Kong is a very free place for business, observers say.","url":"https://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/politics/article/3303057/black-eye-blackrock-hutchison-panama-ports-deal-not-so-easy-say-experts","image":"https://cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2025/03/20/1d0e005a-7592-4616-91dc-074093f73c52_0d002aa2.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-03-20 00:30:08","author":"Harvey Kong,Lam Ka-Sing","authors":["Harvey Kong","Lam Ka-Sing"],"language":"en","source_country":"cn","sentiment":0.073},{"id":302026174,"title":"What’s new in the JFK files?

On his first day back in the White House in January, Trump ordered a 90-day freeze of all US foreign aid.\n\nShortly afterwards, billionaire Elon Musk, a key adviser to Trump, and his Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) gained access to USAID’s payment and computer systems and told most of its staff they were placed on leave.\n\nMusk also attacked the NED on his platform, X, in early February. Later that month, the NED issued a statement saying it was unable to access its Congress-appropriated funds and had “been forced to suspend support for nearly 2,000 partners worldwide.”\n\nAccording to the description on the US government’s website, USAID provides assistance to countries “recovering from disaster, trying to escape poverty, and engaging in democratic reforms.”\n\nIt is unclear whether any organisations in Hong Kong have received funding from USAID. \n\nAn HKFP search on publicly available US government spending records found no results for organisations based in, or operating in, Hong Kong funded by USAID over the past five years.\n\nSeparate to the 2020 Beijing-enacted security law, the homegrown Safeguarding National Security Ordinance targets treason, insurrection, sabotage, external interference, sedition, theft of state secrets and espionage. It allows for pre-charge detention of up to 16 days, and suspects’ access to lawyers may be restricted, with penalties involving up to life in prison. Article 23 was shelved in 2003 amid mass protests, remaining taboo for years. But, on March 23, 2024, it was enacted having been fast-tracked and unanimously approved at the city’s opposition-free legislature.\n\nThe law has been criticised by rights NGOs, Western states and the UN as vague, broad and “regressive.” Authorities, however, cited perceived foreign interference and a constitutional duty to “close loopholes” after the 2019 protests and unrest. \n\nSupport HKFP | Policies & Ethics | Error/typo? | Contact Us | Newsletter | Transparency & Annual Report | Apps\n\nHelp safeguard press freedom & keep HKFP free for all readers by supporting our team","summary":"Hong Kong’s security chief has refused to disclose information about national security investigations following a lawmaker&#8217;s questions about whether the US Agency for International Development (USAID) had provided funding to organisations in the city.

Officially titled Top Chef: Destination Canada, the show airs Thursday nights on Bravo, with episodes streaming on-demand on Peacock.\n\n At a Glance: How to Watch Top Chef: Destination Canada\n\n For returning judge Gail Simmons, the new season is particularly special, as much of it takes place in her hometown of Toronto. The TV star and author says the rising U.S.-Canada tensions stoked by President Donald Trump make it all the more important to promote and showcase what the country has to offer.\n\n “As a Canadian, at this moment in our history and our relationship with America, I’m especially proud to be able to show off Canada in all its glory,” Simmons tells The Hollywood Reporter. “I think it’s going to give Canada its moment in the sun and it’s the perfect time for that.”\n\n Simmons says Top Chef has always been about “seeing the world through the lens of food,” and she hopes this season will foster new perspectives about Canadian cuisine, but also about the country as a whole.\n\n “I think Canada is especially nuanced because it feels like the States, and it kind of looks like the States, but to truly understand Canada, you really have to respect and be open to the fact that it is a totally different country,” she says, noting the country’s “completely different immigrant pathways and stories, and vibrant and powerful Indigenous community.”\n\n “I think understanding the differences between us ultimately teaches us respect for one another and tolerance, and sort of gets us back to our humanity,” she adds, “especially at this moment [when] America loves to just clump us together. My hope is that Top Chef will allow us to explore Canada a little more richly and show the world how beautiful it is as a country and how extraordinary the ingredients are.”\n\n How to Watch Top Chef Season 22 Online Free \n\n Want to watch Top Chef: Destination Canada online? The show airs weekly on Bravo and you can livestream Top Chef with streamers like Fubo, DirecTV Stream and Hulu + Live TV, which all carry a live feed of Bravo. The sites let you watch Top Chef online without needing a cable subscription.\n\n What we like: all three streaming services also offer free trials, so you can watch Top Chef live online for free. Fubo’s free trial includes free DVR, so you can record the episodes to watch back on-demand later. See full details here.\n\n As mentioned earlier, you can also watch new episodes of Top Chef on Peacock, which will have season 22 episodes available for streaming on-demand the day after they air live on TV. Peacock doesn’t have a free trial but a monthly subscription costs just $7.99 and also includes access to other Bravo shows, live sports and thousands of TV series, movies and specials.\n\n Top Chef Season 22: Judges, Contestants \n\n In addition to Simmons, Tom Colicchio returns as a permanent judge and former contestant Kristen Kish returns for a second season as host (replacing Padma Lakshmi).\n\n Fifteen contestants compete for a chance to win the grand prize, which includes $250,000, a feature in Food & Wine magazine and the opportunity to headline their own dinner at the James Beard House in New York. The winner also receives instant Delta SkyMiles Diamond Medallion Status and a $125,000 flight credit to spend on travel with Delta. \n\n Colicchio tells THR that this was his “favorite season,” adding that “with this particular group, once we started eating the food, it was like, ‘Wow, this is wide open. Anyone can take this.'”\n\n “With the level of the chefs [we had] there were probably nine that could have won,” he teases. “More often than not, people weren’t going home for making bad food — it was just the worse dish [that episode]. It wasn’t bad at all. And when you’re sending people off who are doing good food, now that’s a good season.”\n\n Top Chef has now been on the air for two decades, an almost unheard-of number for a reality competition series. Along the way, the show has been nominated for a staggering 50 Emmy Awards, winning once in 2008 for outstanding picture editing for reality programming, and for outstanding reality competition program two years later.\n\n As for why the show remains so popular, Kish says it’s about focusing on the contestants in the kitchen, rather than manufacturing drama. “These are real people who come from really great backgrounds and have restaurants and awards, and you’re taking the best of the best and then putting them into an arena which gets them to think differently and to push themselves,” she says. “It’s not just some flashy, drama-filled television show just for the sake of it.”\n\n Simmons is more pragmatic: “Unlike a show where you can hear the music or see the fashion, you can’t taste the food as a viewer, and so the audience has to experience that dish through us. And so if you as the viewer don’t trust us, and think that we’re lying, being dramatic, not being authentic and not giving you the truth, then you’re going to turn the TV off.”\n\n “Everybody recognizes that we all eat, we all have an opinion and we all connect through food,” she concludes, “and that’s really been the joy of being part of this show for so long.”","summary":"Season 22 of the hit Bravo series takes place across Canada this year, as contestants travel through cities like Toronto, Calgary and Montreal for a shot at the $250,000 grand prize.","url":"https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/tv/tv-news/how-to-watch-top-chef-season-22-canada-online-free-stream-1236168602/","image":"https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/watch-top-chef-season-22-canada.png","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-03-20 00:25:26","author":"Tim Chan","authors":["Tim Chan"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.349},{"id":302020898,"title":"Trump to sign executive order calling for shutdown of Department of Education","text":"Washington — President Donald Trump plans to sign an executive order Thursday calling for the shutdown of the U.S. Education Department, according to a White House official, advancing a campaign promise to eliminate an agency that’s been a longtime target of conservatives.\n\nThe official spoke on the condition of anonymity before an announcement.\n\nTrump has derided the Department of Education as wasteful and polluted by liberal ideology. However, finalizing its dismantling is likely impossible without an act of Congress, which created the department in 1979.\n\nA White House fact sheet said the order would direct Secretary Linda McMahon “to take all necessary steps to facilitate the closure (of) the Department of Education and return education authority to the States, while continuing to ensure the effective and uninterrupted delivery of services, programs, and benefits on which Americans rely.”\n\nThe Trump administration has already been gutting the agency through layoffs and program cuts. Its workforce is being slashed in half and there have been deep cuts to the Office for Civil Rights and the Institute of Education Sciences, which gathers data on the nation’s academic progress.\n\nThe department sends billions of dollars a year to schools and oversees $1.6 trillion in federal student loans.\n\nCurrently, much of the agency’s work revolves around managing money — both its extensive student loan portfolio and a range of aid programs for colleges and school districts, from school meals to support for homeless students. The agency also plays a significant role in overseeing civil rights enforcement.\n\nFederal funding makes up a relatively small portion of public school budgets — roughly 14%. The money often supports supplemental programs for vulnerable students, such as the McKinney-Vento program for homeless students or Title I for low-income schools.\n\nColleges and universities are more reliant on money from Washington, through research grants along with federal financial aid that helps students pay their tuition.\n\nRepublicans have talked about closing the Education Department for decades, saying it wastes taxpayer money and inserts the federal government into decisions that should fall to states and schools. The idea has gained popularity recently as conservative parents’ groups demand more authority over their children’s schooling.\n\nIn his platform, Trump promised to close the department “and send it back to the states, where it belongs.” Trump has cast the department as a hotbed of “radicals, zealots and Marxists” who overextend their reach through guidance and regulation.\n\nYet even some of Trump’s allies have questioned his power to close the agency without action from Congress, and there are doubts about its political popularity. The House considered an amendment to close the agency in 2023, but 60 Republicans joined Democrats in opposing it.\n\nDuring Trump’s first term, former Education Secretary Betsy DeVos sought to dramatically reduce the agency’s budget and asked Congress to bundle all K-12 funding into block grants that give states more flexibility in how they spend federal money. It was rejected, with pushback from some Republicans.","summary":"The order wil aim to \"return education authority to the States\"","url":"https://www.syracuse.com/politics/2025/03/trump-to-sign-executive-order-calling-for-shutdown-of-department-of-education.html","image":"https://www.syracuse.com/resizer/v2/2ZQAWTTX6BHQNGVGJTDGRYCERM.jpg?auth=3e7a7f5f117cfd7a9e4c3bebc3cc7c1de3a522281c3040f4c459c2ae3d816012&width=1280&quality=90","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-03-20 00:23:58","author":"The Associated Press","authors":["The Associated Press"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.007},{"id":302026168,"title":"SoftBank is buying Ampere Computing for $6.5 billion","text":"SoftBank is acquiring Ampere Computing, a Silicon Valley-based chip design start-up, for $6.5 billion in cash, the company said in a statement Wednesday.SoftBank said that under the agreement Ampere will keep its name and headquarters in Santa Clara, California, and operate as a subsidiary of the company.\"The future of Artificial Super Intelligence requires breakthrough computing power,\" Masayoshi Son, chairman and CEO of SoftBank, said in a statement. \"Ampere's expertise in semiconductors and high-performance computing will help accelerate this vision, and deepens our commitment to AI innovation in the United States.\"Renee James, the founder and CEO of Ampere, said in a statement, \"With a shared vision for advancing AI, we are excited to join SoftBank Group and partner with its portfolio of leading technology companies.\"The deal is expected to close in the second half of the year, the statement said.Business Insider has reached out to Ampere for comment.

The directive follows weeks of significant staff and budget reductions within the agency, marking a major shift in federal education policy.\nExecutive Order to End Federal Oversight\nThe upcoming executive order instructs Education Secretary Linda McMahon to “take all necessary steps to facilitate” the department’s closure and to transfer education oversight back to the states, according to a summary obtained by POLITICO.\nDespite the department’s impending dissolution, McMahon will be tasked with ensuring the continued delivery of education-related services, programs, and benefits. The exact wording of the executive order remains undisclosed, though Trump is expected to sign the measure during an East Room ceremony at the White House.\nSweeping Workforce Reductions in Department of Education\nThe Trump administration has already initiated deep cuts within the agency, eliminating positions across multiple divisions, including legal teams, student aid services, and the Office for Civil Rights. Additional layoffs are expected this week as the administration accelerates the department’s wind-down.\nIn addition to the structural changes, the order will prohibit any remaining Education Department-funded programs from advancing initiatives related to diversity, equity, inclusion, or gender ideology, a move that aligns with Trump’s broader conservative policy agenda.\nKey Political Figures and Conservative Leaders to Attend Department of Education Closure\nThe signing event is set to draw a significant number of Republican governors, including Greg Abbott (Texas), Mike Braun (Indiana), Ron DeSantis (Florida), Bill Lee (Tennessee), Brad Little (Idaho), Glenn Youngkin (Virginia), Kim Reynolds (Iowa), and Mike DeWine (Ohio), according to a White House official.\nAlongside elected officials, representatives from conservative advocacy groups such as Moms for Liberty, the Heritage Foundation, and Concerned Women for America are expected to be present.\nThe first report on the scheduled signing was published by USA Today.\nInternal Debate and Legislative Hurdles\nWhile the move to dismantle the department has been in the works for weeks, Trump’s precise strategy has been in flux. POLITICO mentioned sources familiar with White House discussions indicate that some advisers have questioned whether an executive order is necessary to achieve the goal.\nAdditionally, securing congressional approval remains a challenge. Some lawmakers, including key Republican figures, have voiced concerns over eliminating the department entirely. Trump would need at least 60 Senate votes to fully execute his plan, highlighting the significant legislative obstacles ahead.\nFunding Cuts and Future Policy Shifts\nThe broader effort to reduce the federal government’s role in education has been influenced by conservative political forces, including billionaire entrepreneur Elon Musk’s government-reduction initiatives.

The jury awarded more than $660 million in damages across three Greenpeace entities, citing charges including trespass, nuisance, conspiracy, and deprivation of property access.\"We would like to thank the judge and the jury for the incredible amount of time and effort they dedicated to this trial,\" the company said.\"While we are pleased that Greenpeace will be held accountable for their actions, this win is really for the people of Mandan and throughout North Dakota who had to live through the daily harassment and disruptions caused by the protesters who were funded and trained by Greenpeace.\"Greenpeace vowed to appeal the verdict and continue its environmental advocacy.\"The reality is you can't bankrupt a movement,\" Greenpeace USA interim executive director Sushma Raman told AFP.\"This movement exists all around the world: individuals who want a cleaner, greener planet, more vibrant and inclusive democracy, protection of oceans, forests, and land. The people who power organizations like Greenpeace -- you can't bankrupt them, and the work will continue.\"Greenpeace International is counter-suing ET in the Netherlands, accusing the company of using nuisance lawsuits to suppress dissent. A hearing is set for July 2.At the heart of the North Dakota case was the Dakota Access Pipeline, where from 2016 to 2017, the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe led one of the largest anti-fossil fuel protests in US history.The demonstrations saw hundreds arrested and injured, drawing the attention of the United Nations, which raised concerns over potential violations of Indigenous sovereignty.Despite the protests, the pipeline -- designed to transport fracked crude oil to refineries and on to global markets -- became operational in 2017.ET, however, continued its legal pursuit of Greenpeace.Initially, ET sought $300 million in damages through a federal lawsuit, which was dismissed. It then shifted its legal strategy to North Dakota's state courts -- one of the minority of US states without protections against so-called \"Strategic Lawsuits Against Public Participation\" or SLAPPs.Throughout the years-long legal fight, ET's billionaire CEO Kelcy Warren, a major donor to President Donald Trump, was open about his motivations.His \"primary objective\" in suing Greenpeace, he said in interviews, was not just financial compensation but to \"send a message.\" Warren went so far as to say that activists \"should be removed from the gene pool.\"The trial began in late February in Mandan, North Dakota, and after more than two days of deliberation, the jury delivered its verdict.Critics call the case a textbook SLAPP, designed to silence dissent and drain financial resources.\"This kind of lawsuit, which can have the effect of crushing lawful protest and chilling free speech, should be subjected to the higher levels of scrutiny that come with anti-SLAPP legislation,\" said Michael Burger, a lawyer and scholar at Columbia University, told AFP.However, Michael Gerrard, an environmental law professor at the same university, did not go quite so far.\"This verdict will chill protests that physically obstruct fossil fuel projects,\" he said, \"but it shouldn't affect peaceful, non-obstructive demonstrations and certainly won't stop litigation against such projects.\"Greenpeace maintains that it played only a small and peaceful role in the movement, which was led by Native Americans.But in his closing arguments, ET's lead attorney Trey Cox accused Greenpeace of \"exploiting\" the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe to advance its anti-fossil fuel agenda, according to the North Dakota Monitor.","summary":"A jury in North Dakota on Wednesday ordered Greenpeace to pay hundreds of millions of dollars in damages in a closely watched lawsuit brought by a US pipeline operator, raising serious free speech concerns.","url":"https://www.ibtimes.com/greenpeace-hit-660-mn-damages-us-pipeline-suit-3766969","image":"https://d.ibtimes.com/en/full/4588183/native-american-protestors-holds-his-arms-he-other-protestors-are-threatened-private-security.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-03-20 00:06:24","author":null,"language":"en","category":"business","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.008},{"id":302022064,"title":"Tesla Investor Calls for Elon Musk to Step Down as CEO After 'Destroying' Its Reputation: 'Yeah, It's a Crisis'","text":"An early Tesla investor is publicly calling for Elon Musk to step down as CEO, arguing that Musk's focus on his role as adviser to President Donald Trump has put Tesla in crisis.Ross Gerber, the co-founder, president and CEO of Gerber Kawasaki Wealth and Investment Management, criticized Musk's leadership at Tesla following his appointment as head of DOGE, saying the billionaire's attention has been spread too thin.\"It's time for somebody to run Tesla.

Santa Clara County Superior Court Judge Charles Adams on March 12 certified the case as a class action and approved the settlement.\n\nThe payments to workers will cover affected employees who worked at Google in California from mid-February 2018 to the end of 2024. Legal fees and assorted costs and monetary distributions will make up the rest of the $28 million.\n\nGoogle spokesperson Courtenay Mencini said Wednesday that the company continued to “disagree with the allegations that we treated anyone differently, and remain committed to paying, hiring and leveling all employees fairly.”\n\nThe lawsuit alleged Google systematically paid people of certain racial and ethnic backgrounds less than White and Asian or Asian-American workers, using affected employees’ previous compensation to slot them into lower levels in the company’s jobs hierarchy, and denying promotions.\n\nA separate lawsuit, seeking class action status, makes similar claims regarding Black workers at Google.\n\nUnder a California law in effect since 2018 — aimed at preventing previous discriminatory pay from leading to continuing inequities — employers are banned from asking job applicants about their salary history.\n\nCantu claimed that when she was hired and during the period the class action covers from mid-February 2018 to the end of 2024, it was Google’s standard practice to ask prospective hires what they were paid in their past three jobs.\n\nPay disparities at hiring, based on race and ethnicity, continued through affected workers’ employment because raises were based on a percentage of salary, the lawsuit alleged.\n\nThe lawsuit also claimed that for affected workers, Google systematically denied promotions to higher job levels, and that raise percentages were larger for higher-level employees.\n\nGoogle was aware of the pay inequities via its own records and an internal study finding White workers were paid more than non-White workers, the lawsuit alleged.\n\nCantu claimed the unequal pay forced her to resign in 2021.

But as the administration of President Donald Trump threatens legal action over hiring practices based on diversity, equity and inclusion efforts, Google has joined other firms including Meta and Amazon in scaling back diversity hiring targets.\n\nThe firm’s most recent diversity report, from last year, showed its U.S. workforce was 46% Asian, 45% White, 8% Latino, 6% Black and 1% Native American.

What is obviously important is they appreciate that it is what it is which is a credible capability. And that it most certainly is.’\n\nSir Keir will travel to Barrow today to launch construction work on the new Dreadnought class submarines which will take over responsibility for Britain’s continuous at sea deterrence in the 2030s.\n\nHe will also reveal that the King is to honour the Cumbrian shipyard town for its vital national security work by allowing it to use the title Royal Port of Barrow.\n\nEarlier this week he made a secret visit to the crew of one of the existing Vanguard submarines as it returned to Faslane after a record 204 days at sea.\n\nThis afternoon he will address a meeting of senior military chiefs from around 30 countries to plan the creation of a military force to deter further Russian aggression in Ukraine if a peace deal is struck.\n\nKeir Starmer and Defence Secretary John Healey on board a nuclear-armed Vanguard class submarine this week as it returned to Faslane\n\nKeir Starmer and John Healey are briefed on the operation of the UK's Trident nuclear deterrent\n\nKeir Starmer says Russian tyrant 'respects' Britain's nuclear deterrent\n\nBritain and France are the only two countries to have publicly committed to putting boots on the ground. But government sources said a ‘significant number’ of others had privately indicated they are considering it, while other nations could provide different support such as logistics and backfilling.\n\nSir Keir suggested that the force could have to mobilise within months if Donald Trump succeeds in brokering a ceasefire and persuading Russia and Ukraine to stick to it.\n\n‘The fact that we’ve moved to the military planning stage shows that this beyond the sort of speech you tend to get in a political arena to the more military side because I am conscious of the fact that things could move quite quickly.\n\n‘There are a lot of moving parts obviously, but we need to be in a position to answer the question how are you going to defend the deal?\n\n‘We have to understand Putin’s position, -that he doesn’t respect a deal that doesn’t have security arrangements around it. We know that because he’s breached them.’ \n\nSir Keir said he had been moved by his visit to the Vanguard class submarine which would be responsible for firing the UK's Trident nuclear missiles if he was ever required to give the order.\n\nThe boat is thought to have made the longest deployment at sea on record, with the crew not seeing sunlight for more than six months and having no contact with their families.\n\nThe PM, the first to visit a boat returning from a nuclear patrol for 12 years, said: ‘We do ask extraordinary commitment from those that are doing the nuclear deterrent front line work for us.\n\nThe Prime Minister is given a tour of the submarine which helps provide the UK's ultimate deterrent\n\nRelief: Families prepare to greet loved ones after the crew's record deployment of 204 days at sea\n\nWeathered: Nuclear submarine shows the effects of almost seven months in the ocean\n\nKeir Starmer was briefed by the crew as Vanguard class nuclear sub returned to Faslane on Monday\n\n ‘As the Prime Minister, who writes the letters of last resort, to go and meet the team who are operating our nuclear deterrent is, for me, a real sense of duty.’\n\nHe added: 'The crew themselves I was very struck by. They have been there a long time - no daylight. By and large they've been doing six-hour shifts for every one of those however days - it is literally six hours off, six hour on repeat, repeat, repeat, repeat, repeat. I was really struck by what an incredible commitment that is\n\n'All of them have got to be absolutely on their game because it's one of those situations where you're in an environment like that - below the water - you are totally reliant on the teams to do everything they need to do.'\n\nSir Keir said he was 'slightly surprised' to learn he was the first PM since David Cameron in 2013 to join one of the nuclear deterrent boats on its 'Day Zero' return to base.\n\nAnd he paid tribute to the families of the crew.\n\n 'To have your loved one on board for a prolonged period of time when you literally cannot have any communication is really quite something.\n\n'It was quite emotional for the families. It was a joyful day for them - the last hours of waiting before they were reunited. I would describe it as sort of bursting with love.... and also bursting with pride.\n\n'There are little human things that get you - some of them were coming off as new fathers of babies they hadn't either seen or even known (about) but also some coming off to bereavements they did not know about. So a real mix of emotions.' \n\nKeir StarmerRussiaVladimir PutinUkraine\n\nShare or comment on this article:\nPutin fears Britain's Trident missiles warns Starmer, as he launches next generation of the UK's nuclear deterrent\n\nAdd comment","summary":"Speaking ahead of talks today on a new 'coalition of the willing' to keep the peace in Ukraine, the PM said Britain's nuclear deterrent made it one of the key countries able to stand up to Russia .","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-14516679/Putin-Trident-nuclear-missiles-Starmer-Ukraine-Barrow.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/03/19/20/96368591-0-image-a-22_1742414465217.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-03-20 00:01:52","author":"Editor,Jason Groves","authors":["Editor","Jason Groves"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":0.008},{"id":302024046,"title":"Military figures to meet as Ukraine diplomacy push continues","text":"Military figures are set to gather in the UK on Thursday as planning for a peacekeeping force in Ukraine moves into an “operational phase”.\n\nPrime Minister Sir Keir Starmer has been trying to assemble a coalition of nations that would be willing to help enforce any peace deal that could be reached between Kyiv and Moscow.\n\nIt comes after Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said he believes a “lasting peace can be achieved this year” after a call with US President Donald Trump.\n\nSir Keir is expected to meet with defence planners after he announced at the weekend that military chiefs would gather to “put strong and robust plans in place to swing in behind a peace deal and guarantee Ukraine’s future security”.\n\nHe also signalled a move to an “operational phase” as he confirmed Thursday’s meeting.\n\nAddressing a press conference in Downing Street on Saturday, the Prime Minister did not elaborate on which nations had made concrete commitments to a peacekeeping force, but said that what action they could take would be a subject of discussion in the meeting.\n\n“There are different capabilities from different countries, but those are the operational discussions that are going on in relation to what this coalition of the willing will be able to provide,” he said.\n\nDiplomatic efforts on securing a ceasefire had continued on Wednesday, with the call between the US and Ukrainian leaders on Wednesday coming a day after Mr Trump spoke to Russian President Vladimir Putin.\n\nIn a post on X on Wednesday afternoon, Mr Zelensky said he had a “positive, very substantive and frank” conversation with Mr Trump, and said that Ukraine was “ready to implement” the ending of strikes on energy and other civilian infrastructure.\n\nHe thanked Mr Trump for the talks in Saudi Arabia last week, and added: “We agreed that Ukraine and the United States should continue working together to achieve a real end to the war and lasting peace.\n\n“We believe that together with America, with President Trump, and under American leadership, lasting peace can be achieved this year.”\n\nIn the same call, the US president suggested that America takes ownership of Ukrainian power plants to ensure their security.\n\nMr Trump told Mr Zelensky during their call that the US could be “very helpful in running those plants with its electricity and utility expertise”, according to a White House statement from US secretary of state Marco Rubio and national security adviser Mike Waltz.\n\nThe US president added that “American ownership of those plants could be the best protection for that infrastructure”.\n\nNumber 10 welcomed the “progress” that Mr Trump has made “towards a ceasefire deal”.\n\nIn a statement on Wednesday evening, a Downing Street spokesperson said: “We welcome the progress President Trump has made towards a ceasefire deal, and we will continue to work with international partners on putting Ukraine in the strongest possible position.\n\n“We now need to ensure the implementation of the ceasefire deal to see a just and lasting peace in Ukraine.”\n\nMeanwhile, Mr Zelensky is also expected to address European leaders on Thursday when he dials in to the European Council meeting via video link.\n\nElsewhere on Thursday, the Prime Minister is also due to visit Barrow-in-Furness after hailing the town as a “blueprint” for how increasing defence spending can boost prosperity.\n\nHe will lay the keel of the first of the Dreadnought class of submarines, a fleet of four vessels that will make up the next generation of the UK’s nuclear deterrent.","summary":"Military figures are set to gather in the UK on Thursday as planning for a peacekeeping force in Ukraine moves into an “operational phase”.

crusade to erase American heroes from US history","text":"President Donald Trump’s administration has made it a top priority to remove anything associated with diversity, equity, and inclusion initiatives from federal websites, regardless of the context. But in doing so, it’s erasing history—and making a compelling case for why we shouldn’t be dismantling the Department of Education.\n\nOne glaring example of this is Pete Hegseth’s Department of Defense, which, in early March, erroneously removed a historic image of the B-29 bomber, the Enola Gay, from the Pentagon’s website. (The plane dropped the first atomic bomb over Hiroshima, Japan, during World War II.) Why? Because the aircraft’s name contains the word “gay.” \n\nThis absurdity is a powerful illustration of how far Trump and his cronies will go in their quest to eliminate anything that might be construed as “inclusive.” But this particular flub reveals the administration’s true intentions: to distort historical facts for the sake of ideological purity.\n\nMore recently, on Tuesday, it was reported that the Defense Department removed articles about the Navajo Code Talkers from its website, supposedly following a directive from Trump and Hegseth to eliminate all DEI-related content from Pentagon and military sites.\n\nAs we’ve highlighted before, though, under Trump, DEI has been reduced to little more than a smokescreen. The term now serves as a tool for denying opportunities to people of color, women, and minorities—if not erasing them entirely from the history books.\n\nSo far, the Defense Department has been at the forefront of this effort to whitewash the past. But it's not just Hegseth. Trump’s America doesn’t just tolerate blatant racism—it celebrates it. Nazi salutes are casually made by presidential surrogates without consequences, and Confederate generals are celebrated as heroes. History is being erased right before our eyes.\n\nThis past Friday, the Arlington Cemetery website deleted information about certain Black, Hispanic, and female service members, according to The Washington Post. Then, on Monday, the Post reported that a webpage honoring Pfc. Ira Hayes, a Pima Indian and one of the Marines famously photographed raising the American flag at Iwo Jima in 1945, had been removed from the Defense Department’s website. After public pushback, officials stated the page would be restored.\n\nJackie Robinson, the first Black man to play Major League Baseball and a former Army lieutenant, also found himself on the chopping block. Reports indicate his story has also been erased from the Department of Defense’s website. \n\nAs one ESPN columnist wrote, “The ghouls who did this should be ashamed. Jackie Robinson was the embodiment of an American hero. Fix this now.”\n\nAfter more public outcry, the article on him was restored as of Wednesday.\n\nRobinson isn’t the first Black icon once celebrated by the president to be swept aside in this DEI purge. A webpage honoring Medgar Evers, the civil rights activist and U.S. Army World War II veteran, was also removed from the Arlington Cemetery website.\n\nThese instances raise a troubling question: Does Trump even understand the consequences of his actions, despite their apparent lack of rationality? After all, during the 2017 opening of the Mississippi Civil Rights Museum, Trump called Evers a “great American hero.” Yet now, in 2025, it’s as if that acknowledgment never occurred. What’s changed?\n\nThe administration’s actions go beyond seemingly innocuous policy directives; they represent a deliberate attempt to whitewash history and then later rewrite it in the image of those who hold power. By attacking DEI initiatives, the president is erasing the significant achievements of people of color—achievements that have shaped America’s identity.\n\nThese examples underscore the administration’s blatant disregard for history and diversity. More than that, they reveal what happens when figures like Hegseth call for the eradication of DEI: the promise of a “merit-based, color-blind” society translates into one where historically marginalized groups are denied credit and upward mobility.\n\nThere’s an irony in this. While the administration seeks to diminish the accomplishments of underrepresented groups, people like Hegseth are rewarded despite their lack of relevant qualifications. He was given his position not for experience, but because he is a white man who is loyal to Trump.\n\nDespite all the rhetoric about wanting a colorblind society, the administration’s actions speak louder than words. The real goal is clear: a whiter America.","summary":"President Donald Trump’s administration has made it a top priority to remove anything associated with diversity, equity, and inclusion initiatives from federal websites, regardless of the context.

The Prime Minister boarded one of Britain's nuclear subs on Monday that patrols the seas ready to unleash missiles as part of the Trident deterrent. Asked if Putin respects Britain's nukes, he said: \"Yes. The UK is, within Europe, one of the leading nations on defence and security because we have our own independent deterrent and we're committed to Nato.\" The PM said the nuclear deterrent was more important than ever, saying: \"It's been an incredible effective deterrent for decades and we must not take that for granted... the last few years and the last few months have been a reminder across the country, across Europe, how important that first duty of defence and security really is.\" It comes as dozens of military chiefs meet today for crunch talks on how to shore up potential ceasefire in Ukraine . Top brass from countries from the PM's “coalition of the willing” will gather to hammer out plans for a peacekeeping operation to deter Putin from invading again. Speaking in Downing Street ahead of the talks, Mr Starmer said Europe needs to \"answer the question the US has put on the table\" in terms of ramping up its defence. But he said he hoped the UK and other allies looking to boost their budgets would \"bind NATO more closely together\", including the US, amid fears Donald Trump could abandon Europe. \"We've got to step up on our defence and our security,\" Mr Starmer said. \"That's not just a question on Ukraine, in my view it's a long overdue step up which probably should have been better appreciated the moment Russia went across the border into Ukraine.\" Mr Starmer has been spearheading efforts to form a \"coalition of the willing\" to back up any peace deal, which is expected to involve around 30 countries. \"I can sense more of a collective will in Europe to do this now,\" he said. \"We need to be in a position to answer the question; How are you going to defend the deal? I am clear in my mind and [President] Zelensky is very clear in his mind that Minsk [agreement in 2014] didn't work because it didn't have any security arrangements around it. \"We have to understand Putin's ambitions. He doesn't respect a deal that doesn't have security arrangements around it because he's breached them.\" He said some leaders had discussed moving \"at the speed of the fastest\" rather than \"going at the speed of the most cautious\" as before. But he added: \"I don't see this as the alternative to the relationship we have with the US.\" The Prime Minister is expected to join the military planning meeting after visiting Barrow-in-Furness, in Cumbria, to mark the start of construction of the Dreadnought submarine, the next generation of the UK’s nuclear deterrent. Earlier this week he secretly joined submariners as they returned home to their families for the first time in months, making him the first Prime Minister to join a so-called \"day zero\" since 2013. Mr Starmer said he was struck by the commitment of the crew, who worked six hours on, six hours off, for months, without seeing daylight. He said: \"We do ask extraordinary commitment from those who are doing the nuclear deterrent frontline work for us and I think as the PM who writes the letters of last resort, to go and meet the team that are operating our nuclear deterrent is a real sense of duty.\" He also met families as they waited to be reunited after months without contact with their loved ones. Mr Starmer will use his visit to Barrow today to set out how the town is a blueprint for how defence spending can boost communities. The PM said: \"We want to buy British and we want this to be felt in jobs across the country.\" He will announce that the King plans to hand the title ‘Royal’ to the Port of Barrow in recognition of the town’s role in the nation’s security. He will also \"lay the keel\" for the new Dreadnought-class submarines, which will replace Vanguard-class that operate Britain's continuous at sea nuclear deterrent. They are expected to enter service in the 2030s.

They want to fast-track themselves to the top.”\n\nHe added that “the ones that are perhaps not blessed academically, that leave school, unfortunately they end up needing money, and it turns them to crime, I’m afraid. And there’s too much crime going on, stealing iPhones, getting, riding around on bikes and nicking iPhones, easy way to make a living.”\n\nExperiences of crime, as measured by the annual Office for National Statistics survey, have been on a broad downward trend since the mid-1990s.\n\nRajan also asked Lord Sugar for his view on the tense Oval Office meeting between US President Donald Trump, a real estate mogul who rose to greater prominence via the American version of The Apprentice, and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.\n\nHe said that the “leader of a country, of America, publicly having a slanging match with someone else”, was one of the “things in life” he did not believe he would see.\n\n“It’s just not right… by all means have a slanging match behind closed doors, but not publicly,” he added.\n\n“It was humiliating for Zelensky.\n\n“You saw that come up when Zelensky was sitting there quietly. He mentioned something. And then suddenly Trump went into action. It’s just not right. It’s not statesmanlike, is it?”\n\nLord Sugar said he may have done “himself a favour amongst some of the Americans that backed him”, but not the rest of the world, and called the moment “unbelievable” and “not statesmanlike”.\n\nDuring the interview he confirmed he had signed up to another three years of The Apprentice, and will be fronting the show until at least 2029.\n\nLord Sugar also said that would-be reality stars are “part and parcel of the entertainment package” of making a show such as The Apprentice, but he maintained they will “never become the winners” as he spots them quickly.\n\nHe said: “I know what they’re there for. They’re there for the wrong reasons. Right… you can see them flicking their hair back and all that stuff and doing the lipsticks and all that, you know, and coming in with their suits.\n\n“You can tell straight away.”\n\nSeries 19 of the business show, which sees contestants compete for Lord Sugar’s £250,000 investment, is currently more than half way through on the BBC.\n\nThe show is celebrating its 20th year in 2025.\n\nContestants including first winner Tim Campbell, who is currently one of the show’s aides with Baroness Karren Brady, originally would go on to work for Lord Sugar’s companies, before the format was changed.\n\nAmol Rajan Interviews: Alan Sugar is on BBC Two and BBC iPlayer.","summary":"He has barred working from home at his company.","url":"https://www.standard.co.uk/showbiz/celebrity-news/alan-sugar-amol-rajan-donald-trump-conservatives-labour-b1217760.html","image":"https://static.standard.co.uk/2025/03/20/00/0131f1b55db8d2c503a4121d60cd3dc9Y29udGVudHNlYXJjaGFwaSwxNzQyNDk1MTgw-2.75527918.jpg?width=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-03-20 00:01:00","author":"Charlotte McLaughlin","authors":["Charlotte McLaughlin"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.393}]}
