The local currency's decline came at an opportune moment, as some of these sectors like textiles-and-clothing were on the cusp of a gradual revival after a prolonged slump. But the reality is much more nuanced: many sectors, including textiles and leather, have significant import content, which somewhat balances out the gains for onward shipments from a weaker local currency. Moreover, since many competing countries, including China, already have an edge over India in terms of economies of scale and costs, with their currencies also falling as much or more than the rupee against the greenback, the gains for India are either tenuous or non-existent in most markets. Also ReadGenerative AI in 2025: Disrupting Tech and Business Landscapes K Venkatachalam, chief adviser at the Tamil Nadu Spinning Mills Association, pointed out that while India exports yarn and readymade garments, it also imports significant amounts of cotton and other raw materials in dollar terms. This offsets the benefits of exports, rendering the revenue situation (export realisation) neutral even amid the latest bout of rupee depreciation. “If we start exporting finished goods with Indian raw materials alone, it will be beneficial for exporters, but the current situation is not that,” he says, adding that a major part of the raw materials used in export of yarns, including contamination-free and extra long-staple cotton predominantly comes from the US, Brazil and west Africa. According to industry estimates, around 30-40% of the raw materials used in cotton yarn intended for exports from India typically depend on imports. The rupee’s fall is the lowest when compared to the currencies of competing countries in Asia such as Korea, China, Indonesia, Philippines and Indonesia. In 2024, the Indian rupee has fallen a little over 2%, while the Chinese yuan has been down 2.7%, Indonesian rupiah 4.5%, Philippine peso 6.5%, and Korean won 12%. “Exporters are not gaining much,” Ajay Sahai, CEO and director-general at the Federation of Indian Export Organisations (FIEO), says. Prabhu Damodaran, convener of the Coimbatore-based Indian Texpreneurs Federation (ITF), however, says the rupee’s depreciation may have provided a modest advantage, but adds that this may not be a significant growth driver for textile exports. ITF, which has 500 companies as members, represents the entire textile manufacturing value chain, including standalone spinning firms, weaving units, and apparel and home-textile exporters. Damodaran says while buyers from Europe and America are already seeking long-term industrial partnerships with India, the country lacks the manufacturing scale of China to fully meet even the existing demand. For instance, India's monthly readymade garment exports average at just $1.1 billion compared to China's $13 billion. Even neighbouring Bangladesh, despite facing domestic unrest, manages to export three times more than India. In October 2024 alone, it exported $3.3 billion worth of readymade knitwear and woven garments, marking a 22% increase against the same month in 2023. Bangladesh’s domestic challenges have prompted some global buyers to diversify production, presenting India with an opportunity. “This is a directional change, and our task is to turn it into a structural opportunity,” Damodaran says, adding that Indian companies should utilise the PM Mitra Parks being set up in seven states and focus on greenfield investments to meet global demand. In April-November this fiscal, India’s textile exports reached $23.33 billion, a modest 6% growth over the same period in the previous fiscal. This contrasted with the decline in shipments in FY24. Readymade garments accounted for 42% of exports, followed by cotton yarn and fabric (34%) and manmade yarn (14%) in the first eight months of the current fiscal. For Gujarat's textile companies, a volatile and weakened rupee could spell opportunity or crisis, depending on which end of the spectrum they are at. Speaking to FE, Ashish P Gujarati, former president of the Southern Gujarat Chamber of Commerce and Industry (SGCCI), states: “With a weak rupee, it is natural that import prices for raw materials such as MMFs and polyester will increase. Importers across Gujarat and the rest of the country may have to grapple with a 2% to 5% increase in raw material imports.” He notes how high import duties, such as a 20% duty for polyester and other MMFs, already burden importers across the state. “Falling rupee rates have further exacerbated the troubles of importers, who may already be burdened with high import duties and non-tariff barriers. While there is hope of the currency stabilising within the next two months, textile companies importing raw materials will have to face the brunt.” Damodaran notes that Bangladesh imports 40 million kg of cotton yarn from India every month. While this volume is expected to continue, he does not foresee a significant windfall in cotton yarn exports due to the rupee’s depreciation. Chandrima Chatterjee, secretary-general at the Confederation of Indian Textile Industry, says: “Depreciation of rupee has helped exports in the past, too, but adjusted for inflation, the gains don't not amount to much.” She underscores that for long-term gains, developing competitiveness and widening the product mix would be crucial for Indian exporters. Bharat Patel, MD at Ahmedabad-based Ultra Denims, however, says that “for textile exporters like us, it is the perfect opportunity to boost exports to other countries”. He says exports could increase as much as 10%, given the current geopolitical circumstances. Political unrest in Bangladesh could result in approximately 20% growth for textile players, especially ready-to-wear garment producers based in Surat. “If the orders are materialised, Indian textile exporters can benefit immensely in comparison to competitors, especially China, Pakistan and Bangladesh.” Other sectors of labour-intensive exports, too, have a mixed outlook on short-term gains from the weaker rupee. “The gains will be for orders already booked, and will last three months at the most. For new orders, the buyers will take into account the depreciation and drive down prices,” Pankaj Chadha, chairman of of Engineering Export Promotion Council, says. As for the leather sector, India's competitiveness in overseas markets largely depends on exchange rates, and pricing by competing countries like China, Vietnam, Bangladesh, and Cambodia. Israr Ahmed, director at Chennai-based leather manufacturer Farida Group, says: \"Since the dollar is strengthening against all currencies, our competitors are likely to offer similar benefits and pricing.” Nearly 40% value of India’s footwear exports depends on imports, with bovine leather, sole materials, and PU linings being the key items procured from abroad. Within leather exports, the garments segment-with its lesser reliance on imports-stands to benefit the most, followed by the footwear sector. In contrast, the leather goods segment, which heavily depends on imported components like synthetic materials and metal hardware, is likely to gain the least.

Additionally, he notes that efforts by the new US president to end the Ukraine war could bring stability to the region, further benefiting exporters. \"We expect 2025 to be a remarkable year for Indian leather exporters, driven by the Trump factor and anticipated stability in Europe,\" he adds. A cog in the wheels for exporters in general is indeed the (rising) cost of imports, which will likely go up. For crude petroleum, the hit will be the biggest. Other imports like electronics, machinery, parts, intermediate goods, which typically come from China and Southeast Asia, will however be cheaper on net basis because their currencies have depreciated more, according to analysts. “Exports like petroleum products, electronics, gems and jewellery which are dependent on large-scale imports have a natural hedge,” Sahai reckons.","url":"https://www.financialexpress.com/business/industry-rupee-impact-labour-intensive-exports-gains-likely-to-be-tenuous-short-lived-3699452/","image":"https://www.financialexpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/rupee.freepiks_7e96f1.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-12-25 01:10:24","author":"Guest","authors":["Guest"],"language":"en","category":"business","source_country":"in","sentiment":-0.28},{"id":275913726,"title":"Economists seek FTAs, factor-market reforms","text":"Economists on Tuesday made a strong pitch for a new set of reforms to seamlessly integrate India with the global supply chains, including an aggressive pursuit of free trade agreements (FTAs), easing of land and labour market rigidities, and steps to raise farm income and consumption. In their pre-Budget meeting with Prime Minister Narendra Modi, the economists stressed the need to return to 7-8% gross domestic product (GDP) growth, and the “next phase of development cycle”, sources said. Modi met 19 economists from various sectors to seek their suggestions, ahead of Budget FY26, which is to be presented in the background of slowing of economic growth, tepid urban consumption, persisting external volatility, and the threat of high tariffs further impeding world trade and stoking global inflation. Also ReadPM Modi meets economists, experts for suggestions on Budget 2025-26 India's GDP rose by 5.4% in July-September, the lowest rate in seven quarters, as weaker expansions in manufacturing and consumption hurt the economy. Modi encouraged the economists to give bold suggestions and emphasised that Viksit Bharat can be achieved through a fundamental change in mindset which is focused towards making India developed by 2047, a source who attended the meeting said. “We should aggressively go for FTAs with more countries. Some people even suggested we should join the RCEP because without getting into global value chains, we will not be able to break through the next development cycle,” one of the economists present in the meeting with the PM, said. The government has decided not to join the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) after the Galwan clash with China. RCEP was originally being negotiated between 16 countries — Asean members and countries with which they have free trade agreements (FTAs), namely Australia, China, Korea, Japan, New Zealand and India. RCEP was signed by the group of countries in November 2020 except India. Some economists suggested that India should be ready to deal with the incoming new government in the US headed by President Donald Trump, who has threatened to impose tariff on US imports. Trump has talked about raising import duties to 20% across the board and putting a 60% duty on Chinese imports. Recently, he talked about a reciprocal approach in regard to tariffs on imports from India. The US action against China may benefit India, they said. With Bangladesh crisis affecting the textiles industry in that country, some suggested India needs to increase textile and garment exports, which can boost labour-intensive employment in manufacturing. The discussions broadly focussed on the agricultural sector, MSMEs and job creation, said another participant. “Global economies are ageing, and we have the advantage of a growing workforce, we have to adequately skill them to get absorbed in the workforce. So, there was a lot of discussion around that,” the person said. “There is a slowdown in consumption in the economy due to lack of disposable income in the rural households. Growth in farm real wages are flat,” an economist said. There were some suggestions for crop diversification and the adoption of Amul cooperative model for better remuneration to farmers. Economists also suggested reforms in fertiliser subsidy, which could save the government Rs 50,000 crore annually. The Centre’s annual outgo is around Rs 2 lakh crore on fertiliser subsidy. They said education and skills should be mapped with the job requirements to increase employability. “Whether it is farm laws or labour laws or laws related to land use change, all those would have to be addressed as we are slipping on these fronts,” another economist said.

Policymakers have acknowledged several challenges ahead for India, including the impact of stagnant wages on consumption, plateauing of global demand, and climate impact on agriculture. Some analysts estimate that FY25 growth may come in below 6.5% against the Economic Survey projection of 6.5-7%.","url":"https://www.financialexpress.com/policy/economy-economists-seek-ftas-factor-market-reforms-3699479/","image":"https://www.financialexpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/tradee.reuters_fb181c.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-12-25 01:10:24","author":"Prasanta Sahu","authors":["Prasanta Sahu"],"language":"en","category":"business","source_country":"in","sentiment":0.238},{"id":275912564,"title":"Trump pushing death for &apos;rapists, murderers, monsters&apos;","text":"US President-elect Donald Trump says he will direct his Justice Department to \"vigorously pursue\" the death penalty to protect Americans from \"violent rapists, murderers, and monsters\" when he takes power on January 20.

Biden said converting their punishments to life imprisonment was consistent with the moratorium imposed on federal executions in cases other than terrorism and hate-motivated mass murder.\n\n“Joe Biden just commuted the Death Sentence on 37 of the worst killers in our Country,” he wrote on his social media site. “When you hear the acts of each, you won’t believe that he did this. Makes no sense. Relatives and friends are further devastated. They can’t believe this is happening!”\n\nPresidents historically have no involvement in dictating or recommending the punishments that federal prosecutors seek for defendants in criminal cases, though Trump has long sought more direct control over the Justice Department's operations. The president-elect wrote that he would direct the department to pursue the death penalty “as soon as I am inaugurated,” but was vague on what specific actions he may take and said they would be in cases of “violent rapists, murderers, and monsters.”\n\nHe highlighted the cases of two men who were on federal death row for slaying a woman and a girl, had admitted to killing more and had their sentences commuted by Biden.\n\nOn the campaign trail, Trump often called for expanding the federal death penalty — including for those who kill police officers, those convicted of drug and human trafficking, and migrants who kill U.S. citizens.\n\n“Trump has been fairly consistent in wanting to sort of say that he thinks the death penalty is an important tool and he wants to use it,” said Douglas Berman, an expert on sentencing at Ohio State University’s law school. “But whether practically any of that can happen, either under existing law or other laws, is a heavy lift.”\n\nBerman said Trump’s statement at this point seems to be just a response to Biden’s commutation.\n\n“I’m inclined to think it’s still in sort of more the rhetoric phase. Just, ‘don’t worry. The new sheriff is coming. I like the death penalty,’” he said.\n\nMost Americans have historically supported the death penalty for people convicted of murder, according to decades of annual polling by Gallup, but support has declined over the past few decades. About half of Americans were in favor in an October poll, while roughly 7 in 10 Americans backed capital punishment for murderers in 2007.\n\nBefore Biden's commutation, there were 40 federal death row inmates compared with more than 2,000 who have been sentenced to death by states.\n\n“The reality is all of these crimes are typically handled by the states,” Berman said.\n\nA question is whether the Trump administration would try to take over some state murder cases, such as those related to drug trafficking or smuggling. He could also attempt to take cases from states that have abolished the death penalty.\n\nBerman said Trump's statement, along with some recent actions by states, may present an effort to get the Supreme Court to reconsider a precedent that considers the death penalty disproportionate punishment for rape.\n\n“That would literally take decades to unfold. It’s not something that is going to happen overnight,” Berman said.\n\nBefore one of Trump's rallies on Aug. 20, his prepared remarks released to the media said he would announce he would ask for the death penalty for child rapists and child traffickers. But Trump never delivered the line.\n\nOne of the men Trump highlighted on Tuesday was ex-Marine Jorge Avila Torrez, who was sentenced to death for killing a sailor in Virginia and later pleaded guilty to the fatal stabbing of an 8-year-old and a 9-year-old girl in a suburban Chicago park several years before.\n\nThe other man, Thomas Steven Sanders, was sentenced to death for the kidnapping and slaying of a 12-year-old girl in Louisiana, days after shooting the girl's mother in a wildlife park in Arizona. Court records show he admitted to both killings.\n\nSome families of victims expressed anger with Biden's decision, but the president had faced pressure from advocacy groups urging him to make it more difficult for Trump to increase the use of capital punishment for federal inmates. The ACLU and the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops were some of the groups that applauded the decision.\n\nBiden left three federal inmates to face execution. They are Dylann Roof, who carried out the 2015 racist slayings of nine Black members of Mother Emanuel AME Church in Charleston, South Carolina; 2013 Boston Marathon bomber Dzhokhar Tsarnaev; and Robert Bowers, who fatally shot 11 congregants at Pittsburgh’s Tree of Life Synagogue in 2018, the deadliest antisemitic attack in U.S history.\n\n© Copyright 2024 The Associated Press.

He makes fun of, he belittles, he mocks, because he can,” he said. But he said that a vacuum of leadership in Ottawa from embattled Prime Minister Justin Trudeau is spurring “the freelancing of some of the provincial leaders” in response to Trump’s comments.\n\nFor example, Ontario Premier Doug Ford weighed in on Trump’s postings on Dec. 18, telling media that “we’ll never be the 51st state. We’re Canada; we’re proud to be Canadians. We’ll always fight for that.”\n\nEttinger said civil society is similarly better to focus on convincing Americans to not impose damaging tariffs on Canada, instead of amping up anti-Trump rhetoric.\n\n“Canadians should worry first about what Canada’s actual national interests are,” he said. “We’re not going to out-trash talk Donald Trump, so don’t even bother trying and focus instead on the core stuff that really matters.”\n\nIn response to Trump’s threats, the Trudeau Liberal government has unveiled a $1.3 billion spending package over six years to address Trump’s threats, which concern border security and the flow of illegal drugs into the United States.\n\nCanada’s ambassador to the U.S. Kirsten Hillman has repeatedly characterized Trump’s comments as gentle ribbing between two close countries.\n\nForeign Affairs Minister Mélanie Joly said on Dec. 13 that she has quipped to Republican senators that they could join Canada as the eleventh province.\n\nGreenland’s head of government, Múte Bourup Egede, suggested that Trump’s latest calls to purchase the territory from Denmark would be as meaningless as those made in his first term.\n\n“Greenland is ours. We are not for sale and will never be for sale,” he said in a statement. “We must not lose our years-long fight for freedom.”\n\nPanama President José Raúl Mulino has also rebuffed Trump’s musing about taking over the Panama Canal.\n\n“Every square metre of the canal belongs to Panama and will continue to,” he said in a video, to which Trump fired back on his social media site, “We’ll see about that!”","url":"https://www.saanichnews.com/national-news/expert-calls-trump-taunts-churlish-urges-canada-to-focus-on-coming-trade-war-7729031","image":"https://www.bpmcdn.com/f/files/shared/feeds/gps/2024/12/web1_20241224041248-20241224041244-676a82dcd4ddb8f749125209jpeg.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-12-25 00:37:24","author":"The Canadian Press","authors":["The Canadian Press"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"ca","sentiment":0.103},{"id":275911740,"title":"Investors hope for U.S. stock market trifecta in 2025 after boom years","text":"NEW YORK - Investors are expecting more gains for the U.S. stock market in 2025 after two straight standout years, fueled by a solid economy supporting corporate profits, moderating interest rates and pro-growth policies from incoming President Donald Trump.The benchmark S&P 500 is up over 23% year to date, even with a recent speed bump, and is on pace for its second straight year of gains exceeding 20%, lifted by megacap tech stocks and excitement over the business potential of artificial intelligence.Investors are more confident about the economy than this time a year ago, with consumers and businesses having absorbed higher interest rates and the Federal Reserve now lowering them — albeit by not as much as hoped.

Zapeta-Calil, 33, was deported from the U.S. in 2018 but reentered the country on an unknown date.The suspect's immigration status renewed criticisms of President Joe Biden's immigration policies, while President-elect Donald Trump, meanwhile, made illegal immigration and border security a central tenet of his 2024 election campaign.Among other things, Trump has pledged to initiate mass deportations on the first day he takes office. The president-elect has not yet publicly commented on the subway killing.What To KnowZapeta-Calil is charged with first and second degree murder and arson for the incident, which happened on an F train in Brooklyn on Sunday.Police are still working to identify the victim. A criminal complaint lists her manner of death as \"homicide\" and the causes as \"thermal injuries and smoke inhalation.\"During Zapeta-Calil's arraignment Tuesday, the court heard how he had quietly approached the victim, who was sleeping, and lit her clothing on fire.Assistant District Attorney Ari Rottenberg said Zapeta-Calil then used his shirt to fan the flames, causing the fire to engulf her \"in a matter of seconds,\" Fox 5 New York reported.Surveillance footage showed the suspect calmly leaving the train, sitting on a platform bench and watching the victim burn to death, according to prosecutors.Zapeta-Calil's lawyer did not speak to reporters after the arraignment. Newsweek reached out to him for comment via email on Tuesday evening.Zapeta-Calil was arrested after high schoolers recognized him on another F train later that same day, from surveillance photos released by the New York Police Department, and called 911.Rottenberg said Zapeta-Calil claimed to have no memory of the incident, telling police he drinks alcohol. But he added that the 33-year-old had identified himself as the suspect in the surveillance images of the attack.Zapeta-Calil said his last known address was an outpatient treatment program for substance abuse and mental health issues called Samaritan Daytop Village in Brooklyn.Investigators are attempting to identify the victim using dental records. Multiple reports have said she was homeless, but police have not yet confirmed that.CNN reported that the victim may have had mobility issues, noting she had a walker nearby. She was also wearing multiple layers of clothing, which may have accelerated the fire's spread.Meanwhile, people have expressed shock and outrage at video surveillance footage of the incident, which shows bystanders and at least one uniformed NYPD officer appearing to casually walk by or mill about rather than try to help the victim as she was engulfed in flames.What People Are SayingGerald Posner, a journalist known for his investigations into the JFK assassination, told Newsweek of the video footage: \"I could imagine if you didn't want to be the person who wanted to rush in and try to help them, because you're afraid you're going to catch on fire, you don't know what's going on—I get that.\"But the idea, then, of just not running to get the cops, as opposed to just sort of looking out at the phone and filming it... It did make me think back to that 1964 murder.\"NYPD commissioner Jessica Tisch condemned the killing: It was \"one of the most depraved crimes one person could possibly commit against another human being.\"Brooklyn District Attorney Eric Gonzalez said in a statement: \"This gruesome and senseless act of violence against a vulnerable woman will be met with the most serious consequences. Every New Yorker deserves to feel safe on our subways, and we will do everything in our power to ensure accountability in this case.\"What Happens NextZapeta-Calil was remanded in custody at his arraignment on Tuesday. His next court appearance is scheduled for Friday, December 27.A spokesman for ICE said there are plans to issue a detainer to transfer Zapeta-Calil to federal custody.","summary":"Sebastian Zapeta-Calil \"fanned the flames\" after allegedly setting a woman on fire on the subway, prosecutors said.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/sebastian-zapeta-nyc-subway-murder-suspect-fanned-flames-2005885","image":"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2551312/sebastian-zapeta-appears-nyc-court.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-12-25 00:33:19","author":"Hannah Parry","authors":["Hannah Parry"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.402},{"id":275910384,"title":"The 'War on Christmas' is the wrong fight for Christians","text":"By Frank Barry\n\nThis holiday season brings an extra reason to be joyful: A recent poll found that Americans’ belief in the existence of a “War on Christmas” has fallen dramatically since 2022, to 23 percent. Peace on earth and mercy mild!\n\nPerhaps with the ongoing “invasion” of our southern border, Fox and other conservative networks have decided that it’s best to focus on drumming up support for one war at a time. Or maybe waging a two-decade war over the Prince of Peace with imaginary grinches has finally grown wearisome, even if Donald Trump is still manning the barricades.\n\nThe idea that there’s a war against Christmas has never been about the ability to practice Christianity, only the fear that America is under siege by secular liberals and their allies among Jews, Muslims and people of other faiths. It is based on the claim that saying “Merry Christmas” rather than “Happy Holidays” is culturally verboten, rather than a well-intentioned (one might even say Christian) effort at inclusive grace.\n\nThe tragedy of making up a forever war on Christmas to score political points isn’t that it’s been needlessly divisive. It’s that so many Christians spent so much time confusing a greeting with the gospel. In taking aim at secularization, they trained their fire on the most superficial and meaningless target, rather than the big prize: infusing the Christmas season with more of Christ’s spirit, in the face of the avalanche of commercialism that overwhelms it.\n\nThe work of rescuing Christianity from partisan warriors is captured in an inspiring new book, Your Jesus Is Too American. Its author, Steve Bezner, is the pastor of a large evangelical church in Houston, Texas, which I visited recently on a cross-country RV trip.\n\n“It’s not unusual,” he writes, “to see signs featuring a cross draped in an American flag or even Jesus wearing an American flag as a sash.” Those images lead to “people being convinced that being an American citizen is synonymous with being a Christian” — and often, that being a Christian is synonymous with being a Republican.\n\n“You’re not a Christian if you vote for a Democrat,” a megachurch pastor in Dallas said earlier in the year. He was hardly the only person to make that claim, which has led many Christians to believe, Bezner writes, “that our salvation is found not in Jesus but in who occupies the White House.”\n\nHis book aims “to remind us of the backward and upside-down values of Jesus and to hold them in tension with our American values.” He’s deeply patriotic, but doesn’t confuse love of country with love of God, or loyalty to party with fidelity to scripture.\n\nBezner thoughtfully explores paradoxes at the heart of Christianity that challenge American culture: denying our material wants to fulfill our spiritual needs, which runs counter to our consumerism; giving away our resources to enrich ourselves, which runs counter to our ambitions; and serving others to save ourselves, which runs counter to our individualism.\n\n“Jesus’ final act of teaching before sharing a meal with his disciples and then journeying to the cross,” Bezner writes, “was an act of joyful service” — washing his disciples’ feet, demonstrating that the lowliest forms of service are God’s highest calling.\n\n“Too many of our pastors sound like pundits,” he writes. “Too few of us wash feet.”\n\nBezner examines the most difficult of Jesus’ commandments — love your enemies — by placing it in historical context that has contemporary relevance. Jesus spoke those words to Jews living under a violently repressive Roman regime that was “militarily occupying their homeland, taxing them, and building up pagan worship.”\n\nAt a time when hatred of Donald Trump runs deep through the Democratic Party, and when Trump and other Republicans are threatening retribution against their enemies, Jesus’ call to practice what Bezner calls “enemy love” is a challenge to Christian members of both parties.\n\nBezner is especially compelling when examining Jesus’ solidarity with “ethnic outcasts,” including Samaritans despised by Jews, and with aliens and exiles who arrive to new lands with nothing.\n\n“His reputation as the friend of sinners is well earned,” Bezner writes of Jesus, “but we might do well to think of him also as the friend of foreigners.” His disciples took that lesson to heart. “The earliest churches,” notes Bezner, “were multiethnic in an age when xenophobia was high.”\n\nBezner has worked to make his own congregation more ethnically and racially diverse, a process that led to “a lot of negative emails and comment cards and even a few death threats.” And while some members left, his church has grown in numbers — and in strength — as it has gone from 99% White to about two-thirds White.\n\nOver the past decade, leading a church while tacking against the nation’s howling political winds has been an extremely difficult challenge that courts backlash and risks failure. But we need more pastors, like Bezner, willing to attempt it. “A good preacher,” another evangelical pastor told me earlier this year, “steps on toes.”\n\nFor Christmas, churches will be aglow with purple candles. In the Christian tradition, purple signifies penance. In the American tradition, it signifies unity — the blending of red and blue.\n\nWhat better way to celebrate Christ and country than to carry the purple of this season with us into the new year.\n\nMerry Christmas.\n\nFrank Barry is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist and member of the editorial board covering national affairs.

challenges","text":"A double cancer diagnosis for the King and the Princess of Wales marked a difficult, challenging 2024 for the royal family.\n\nIt was, in the words of the Prince of Wales, a “brutal” time.\n\nKate shared heartfelt updates on her cancer journey, as both the princess and the monarch underwent treatment for the disease.\n\nCharles was back on public duties in the spring with the Queen often urging him to take it easy.\n\nThe princess has made a gradual return, while the King carried out a major long haul tour to Australia and hosted two state visits.\n\nKate’s festive annual carol concert was a highlight, but there was controversy as the year came to a close thanks to the Duke of York’s close links to an alleged Chinese spy.\n\nJanuary started badly for Andrew with hundreds of pages of court documents relating to the Jeffrey Epstein scandal unsealed in the US.\n\nAllegations the duke sexually assaulted Virginia Giuffre when she was 17, which he denies, were given a fresh airing in the legal papers, amid growing pressure on the Metropolitan Police to investigate.\n\nThen the royal family was hit by a double health scare when Kate underwent abdominal surgery and it was announced on the same day that the King was to be treated in hospital for a benign, enlarged prostate.\n\nKate spent 13 nights in hospital and was expected to take the next three months to recuperate.\n\nCharles visited his daughter-in-law’s bedside as he was admitted to the same clinic for his procedure, and a three-night stay.\n\nWilliam stepped back from official duties to juggle caring for his children and his wife, and Kensington Palace said Kate’s operation was not-cancer related.\n\nJust days later, there was a further blow to the royal family when Sarah, Duchess of York was revealed to have skin cancer, with her malignant melanoma diagnosis coming less than a year after she had breast cancer.\n\nThe Windsors’ health problems were only just beginning.\n\nOn February 5, Buckingham Palace announced to the nation the King had cancer – not prostate cancer but another undisclosed form.\n\nThe Duke of Sussex made a transatlantic dash to see his father, but in the end met him for around 30 minutes, and had no reunion with William.\n\nCharles, who had already begun treatment, cancelled all face-to-face public duties, and William returned to work, restarting his official engagements, with the Princess Royal and the Queen also holding the fort.\n\nCamilla, on a visit to Salisbury, said the King was doing “extremely well under the circumstances”.\n\nHarry gave an interview to Good Morning America and suggested the King’s illness could lead to a reconciliation with his father, saying: “I love my family.”\n\nCharles went on to resume his weekly audiences with the then-prime minister, and told Rishi Sunak the public’s “wonderful” get well messages had “reduced me to tears most of the time”.\n\nWilliam pulled out of attending his godfather King Constantine of Greece’s memorial service in Windsor at the last minute due to an undisclosed personal matter, fuelling speculation about Kate’s health.\n\nThere was devastating news at the end of February when the Palace announced the sudden death of Thomas Kingston, the 45-year-old husband of Prince and Princess Michael of Kent’s daughter Lady Gabriella Kingston.\n\nMr Kingston took his own life, in what his family said was an impulsive action provoked by an adverse reaction to depression drugs and sleeping tablets, an inquest later found.\n\nThere were concerns about the “threadbare” working monarchy, with Anne carrying on with her many engagements, the ailing Duke of Kent also out on public duties and the Queen heading off on a week’s break.\n\nRumours began to intensify on social media about Kate, with no sighting of the princess for more than two months.\n\nBut soon after, she was papped, wearing dark sunglasses, being driven in a car by her mother near Windsor.\n\nSarah, Duchess of York was given good news, when she learned her skin cancer had not spread.\n\nConspiracy theories about Kate’s whereabouts abounded online and speculation grew worse when Kensington Palace released a Mother’s Day photograph of the princess and her three children, and photo agencies “killed” the image when it turned out to have been digitally altered.\n\nKate made a public apology and confessed to having edited the photograph, and she was seen soon after smiling as she visited a farm shop in Windsor with William – but the rumours continued.\n\nThe princess was also at the centre of an alleged royal data breach, when unauthorised staff at the London Clinic, where she had her surgery, allegedly tried to access her confidential medical records.\n\nThen just days later on March 22, the princess revealed in a shock video message that she was undergoing chemotherapy after post-operative test showed she had cancer.\n\nShe described the development as a “huge shock”, but vowed “I am going to be OK” and asked for time, space and privacy.\n\nWell-wishes flooded in from around the world and the King was said to be “so proud” of his “beloved daughter-in-law” for her courage in speaking out about her diagnosis.\n\n On Easter Sunday, the King made his most significant public appearance since his diagnosis. \n\nHe attended church with Camilla in Windsor and conducted a walkabout to greet the crowds.\n\nThe Netflix drama Scoop, featuring Holiday actor Rufus Sewell as the Duke of York, Gillian Anderson as interviewer Emily Maitlis and Billie Piper as producer Sam McAlister, was released, delving into the story behind the infamous Newsnight interview about Andrew’s friendship with Epstein.\n\nWilliam returned to official engagements after Easter after spending quality time with his family.\n\nAt food distribution charity Surplus to Supper, based in Sunbury-on-Thames, he promised a volunteer he would “take care” of Kate.\n\nThe Waleses celebrated Louis’ sixth birthday, released a new picture – stressing it was unedited – straight to social media in a change in tactic to avoid a repeat of the Mother’s Day photo furore.\n\nThe King, meanwhile, returned to public duties, with his medical team “very encouraged” by the progress he had made.\n\nCharles and Camilla visited University College Hospital Macmillan Cancer Centre in central London, with the King becoming patron of Cancer Research UK, and he spoke of his “shock” at his diagnosis, telling fellow patients “I’m well”.\n\nThe Duchess of Edinburgh became first British royal to visit Ukraine since the start of war with Russia.\n\nPrincess Charlotte’s ninth birthday was celebrated with an image taken by Kate showing the smiling princess pictured next to a pink clematis.\n\nCharles received a hug from niece Zara Tindall as he braved the rain to visit the Royal Windsor Horse Show.\n\nAnd Harry returned to the UK to mark the 10th anniversary of the Invictus Games with a service at St Paul’s Cathedral, but there was no reunion with the King or the William.\n\nHe followed it with a three-day quasi-royal tour to Nigeria with the Duchess of Sussex to champion mental health for young people affected by conflicts and to promote the Invictus Games.\n\nThe same month, their charity the Archewell Foundation was temporarily listed as “delinquent” in California following an apparent issue with the receipt of the renewal fees.\n\nWilliam made his first trip to the Scilly Isles since becoming the Duke of Cornwall, and bought pasties and played volleyball on the beach.\n\nJust days later, Charles officially handed over the role of Colonel-in-Chief of the Army Air Corps – Harry’s former regiment – to William during a rare joint engagement, which saw William flying off in a Apache helicopter.\n\nAnd the first completed portrait of the King since his coronation – by Jonathan Yeo – depicted the monarch bathed in red with, at Charles’s suggestion, a butterfly at his shoulder, symbolising his metamorphosis from prince to King.\n\nSome commentators described it as like a poster for a horror movie, and others said it appeared as if the King was “burning in hell”, while Camilla praised its likeness to the King.\n\nThe announcement of a surprise summer election, set for July 4, meant the royal family postponed engagements “which may appear to divert attention or distract from the election campaign”.\n\nFootball fan George joined William as he presented the FA Cup to winners Manchester United at Wembley.\n\nD-Day 80th anniversary commemorations went ahead with Charles and Camilla travelling to Portsmouth and Normandy where they appeared visibly moved during poignant services in remembrance of the fallen.\n\nBut the event turned into a major blunder for then-PM Mr Sunak, when he was heavily criticised for returning early and missing an international ceremony, attended by heir to the throne William, to record a television interview.\n\nHarry stayed away from the Duke of Westminster’s wedding in Chester, where William was acting as an usher, as the brothers’ long-running estrangement showed no signs of abating.\n\nA new photo and written message to the nation came from Kate ahead of a brief return to the public spotlight at Trooping the Colour – her first official engagement of the year and since her diagnosis.\n\nThe princess in her candid words revealed she was “making good progress” but had “good days and bad days”, was “not out of the woods yet” and was facing a few more months of treatment.\n\nShe was pictured in the grounds of the Windsor Castle estate, standing in a tranquil setting against a weeping willow tree near a lake.\n\nAt Trooping, the princess rode in closed carriage with her children and took to the balcony. Charles participated this year from a carriage, rather than on horseback.\n\nAt the traditional Order of the Garter, William, Charles and Camilla, in their robes, walked down from Windsor Castle’s state apartments to St George’s Chapel.\n\nGeorge and Charlotte joined William at a Taylor Swift concert at Wembley Stadium at the end of June to celebrate their father’s 42nd birthday, taking a backstage selfie with the US pop singer.\n\nThere was a further health blow for the royal family in late June when Anne was rushed to hospital after being struck by a horse while out walking on her Gatcombe Park estate.\n\nShe suffered concussion and mild head injuries, and spent five nights in hospital.\n\nYet, the show carried on, with the King and Queen hosting the Japanese state visit, but with political elements such as Downing Street meetings removed because of the forthcoming election.\n\nCharles in his banquet speech made cultural reference to Hello Kitty and Pokemon, telling guests: “The Pokemon phrase, gotta catch ’em all, may resonate with my grandchildren, but for me it is, perhaps, aspirational.”\n\nCamilla wore the King’s new Family Order – the diamond-encased miniature portrait of her husband set on a silk ribbon – on her banquet gown for the first time.\n\nCharles played a central role post-election, inviting Sir Keir Starmer to form a new government as he became the third Prime Minister of Charles’ reign and the first Labour one.\n\nThe King sympathised with his new PM, telling him you must be “utterly exhausted and nearly on your knees”.\n\nCharles took a trip to Cardiff to celebrate 25 years of Welsh devolution as he addressed the Senedd.\n\nKate attended the Wimbledon men’s final with Charlotte – her second public engagement since her diagnosis – and presented the trophy to Carlos Alcaraz.\n\nThe same day, George went to Berlin with William for the England’s men’s football team’s Euro 2024 final.\n\nCharles urged the squad to “hold your heads high” after their defeat to Spain, while William said “we’re all still so proud of you”.\n\nKensington Palace released a photo of Charlotte and Prince Louis, wearing England shirts bearing their names, watching the game at home.\n\nMeanwhile, the King wrote privately to Donald Trump after the former US president survived an assassination attempt.\n\nThe room behind Buckingham Palace’s famous balcony opened to the public for the summer and Charles and Camilla made an official visit to Jersey and Guernsey.\n\nIt was a busy month for Charles. The King carried out his duty and delivered the second King’s Speech of his reign at the State Opening of Parliament.\n\nAt his side was the Queen, who was celebrating her 77th birthday the same day.\n\nA new black and white photo of George, looking grown up in an open-necked white shirt and dark blazer and wearing a friendship bracelet on his left wrist, marked his 11th birthday.\n\nA National Audi Office report revealed the ongoing £369 million renovations of Buckingham Palace had been well managed but structural damage and the discovery of asbestos, which led to cost increases, “could have been foreseen”.\n\nIn other royal finances, soaring Crown Estate profits meant the monarchy will receive a boost of more than £45 million, with a 53% jump in its official annual income to more than £130 million.\n\n Harry said his determination to fight the tabloids was a “central piece” in destroying his relationship with his family, with the “rift” in part due to his mission, in ITV ’s Tabloids On Trial documentary. \n\nHe also said it would be “still dangerous” for Meghan to return to the UK.\n\nMeghan, in an interview with CBS Sunday, said she had not “really scraped the surface” in talking about her suicidal thoughts.\n\nLater in the month, the couple undertook a four day quasi-royal trip to Colombia, where Meghan said her three-year-old daughter Princess Lilibet had “absolutely found her voice” during a talk on gender equality.\n\nThe first £1 coins featuring the King entered circulation.\n\nAnd Charles reportedly axed his private funding of Andrew’s security team, with the change due in the autumn.\n\nThe King suspended his traditional Balmoral break to made a solo trip to meet survivors of the fatal Southport knife attack and their relatives in Merseyside, expressing his sympathy as he viewed the floral tributes.\n\nThe next day, he met bereaved families during a private audience at Clarence House.\n\nBoth William and Harry attended the funeral of their uncle Lord Fellowes in Norfolk, but they sat apart and were not seen interacting.\n\nWilliam grew a summer beard, but kept it, debuting his new look on public duties, and later revealing a previous beard left Charlotte in floods of tears.\n\nThe King reached the second anniversary of his accession to the throne and the death of his mother the late Queen, with royal sources saying his health was “heading in a very positive trajectory”.\n\nKate issued a deeply personal video update on her cancer journey, saying she had finished her chemotherapy but her “path to healing and full recovery is long”, she was taking each day at it came, and hoping to return to a light programme of public duties.\n\nHer words were narrated over stylised footage showing the Waleses and their children enjoying the outdoors, walking through woods and the couple cuddling as they held hands.\n\nThe King found himself in the middle of a scrum when he accepted a hug from New Zealand women’s rugby player Ayesha Leti-I’iga and her team-mates at a Palace reception\n\nCharles also marked the 25th anniversary of the Scottish Parliament with an address to the chamber.\n\nHarry’s US visa application remained private despite him admitting taking drugs in his memoir, after a ruling from an American judge.\n\nAnd he turned 40 in September, and in a rare step, William and Kate’s Kensington Palace social media account wished him a happy birthday in a message on X.\n\nThe duke also carried out a run of solo engagements in New York, and returned to the UK for the WellChild awards ceremony.\n\nThe Palace announced Beatrice was pregnant with her second child.\n\nKate was pictured hugging aspiring teenage photographer Liz Hatton, who had a rare and aggressive form of cancer, after inviting her to take pictures at William’s Windsor Castle investiture.\n\nHarry travelled solo to South Africa and Lesotho for his charity Sentebale, reuniting around a bonfire with his close friend Prince Seeiso, who described him as “my younger brother Mohale, the warrior”.\n\nSarah, Duchess of York, visited the set of Coronation Street with actress Sally Dynevor, and poured a pint in the Rovers Return, as she raised awareness of breast cancer.\n\nThe Duke and Duchess of Edinburgh visited the late Queen’s home in Malta, recreating a picture of Elizabeth and Prince Philip at Villa Guardamangia.\n\nAnd Kate made a surprise visit with William to meet the bereaved families of the Southport stabbing victims in Merseyside.\n\nShe told emergency responders: “I can’t underestimate how grateful they all are for the support you provided on the day.”\n\nOn a trip to Chad, Sophie was moved to tears after she met refugees fleeing to escape the civil war in Sudan and heard their “devastating” experiences of sexual violence.\n\nThe King paused his cancer treatment and set off on a historic tour to Australia – his first as the country’s King.\n\nThere was controversy when Charles was berated by Australian senator Lidia Thorpe who accused him of “genocide” against her nation’s indigenous people and declared: “You are not my king” during his welcome at Parliament House, Canberra.\n\nBut thousands flocked to the famous Sydney Opera House to see the monarch and Camilla.\n\nThe King and Queen flipped sausages on a Sydney barbecue, met an alpaca wearing a bow tie, and the King shared a hug with Uncle James Michael Welsh, a survivor of Australia’s stolen generation when First Nations children were taken away from their parents for assimilation into white society.\n\nCharles stumbled slightly during one four-minute speech and said over the microphone: “God almighty. They’ve got two pages of this bloody thing”.\n\nIn Samoa, the King showed off his own take on local fashion during welcoming ceremonies.\n\nHe swapped his trademark tailored suit for a short-sleeved white jacket and trousers he designed himself as he was honoured with a new title, sipped a symbolic drink and was presented with a pig for feasting on the opening day of his state visit to the Pacific nation, before attending the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting.\n\nThe King and Queen also stopped off in India for a break in a luxury spa on their way home.\n\nIn an ITV documentary about William’s Homewards initiative, the prince said he used the school run to talk to his children about homelessness when they spot rough sleepers.\n\nWilliam travelled to Cape Town for his Earthshot Prize Awards, where he played a game of touch rugby with youngsters, and sported a second-hand double-breasted Prince of Wales check jacket sourced from a vintage store at the ceremony.\n\nIn interviews, he admitted he did not like the added responsibility that came with being heir to the throne, and described the past 12 months, with his wife and father’s health challenges, as “brutal” and probably “the hardest year of my life”.\n\n Meanwhile, an investigation by Channel 4’s Dispatches and the Sunday Times into William and the King’s Duchies found the estates have struck rental agreements worth millions of pounds with the armed forces, the NHS and state schools. \n\nCharles’s Duchy of Lancaster agreed a deal to store ambulances in a warehouse on its land at a cost of more than £11 million to the NHS over 15 years.\n\nCamilla caught a seasonal bug and missed a run of engagements including Remembrance Day at the Cenotaph.\n\nShe ended up with pneumonia and post viral fatigue, and amid it all, her dog and faithful companion Beth had to be put down.\n\nIn an ITV documentary on her domestic violence campaigning, Camilla vowed to “keep trying” to end the crime until she is “able to no more”.\n\nKate made appearances over the Remembrance weekend in honour of the nation’s war dead, including at the Cenotaph, where Sophie placed a comforting hand on Kate’s back in a show of support.\n\nCharles marked his 76th birthday with a visit to a food distribution hub.\n\nOn the evening before, he celebrated the UK’s film and television industry at a star-studded Buckingham Palace reception, followed by a night out at the Gladiator II premiere with stars Paul Mescal, Denzel Washington and Pedro Pascal.\n\nWilliam and Kate paid tribute to photographer Liz Hatton, who died aged 17, at the end of November.\n\nThe princess joined the King and William in welcoming the Emir of Qatar to the UK at a state visit at the start of December, another step in her journey back to her public role.\n\nThe princess looked relaxed as she greeted the Gulf state leader and attended the Horse Guards Parade welcome.\n\nShe missed the state banquet, but there for the first time were David and Victoria Beckham, raising speculation the former England captain was in line for a knighthood.\n\n Kate brought Christmas cheer with her annual carol concert in Westminster Abbey, where she gathered with William and their children, other royals, and stars such as Paloma Faith and Richard E Grant. \n\nLouis left a touching message to his Middleton grandparents on a “kindness tree”, writing: “Thank you to granny and grandpa because they have played games with me.”\n\nKate spoke to Faith of “challenging times” and how she “didn’t know” what this year would bring.\n\nIn Paris, William met US president-elect Donald Trump after the Notre Dame reopening, with Mr Trump later saying the prince was “very handsome” and “some people look better in person”, and how the King “is fighting very hard” against cancer.\n\nHarry and Meghan’s e-Christmas card gave a glimpse of Lilibet, pictured from behind, with long, flowing ginger hair, and Archie next to her.\n\nThe duke earlier in the month dismissed rumours that his marriage to the duchess was in trouble when he appeared at The New York Times Dealbook Summit, saying: “We’ve apparently divorced maybe 10, 12 times as well. So it’s just like, what?”\n\nAnd the Sussexes’ Polo series hit Netflix, but attracted a flurry of negative reviews.\n\nThe year ended as it began with Andrew back in the headlines, when it emerged he had been a “close confidante” of alleged Chinese spy Yang Tengbo, who paid visits to Buckingham Palace but was later banned from entering the UK on national security grounds.\n\nThe duke and ex-wife Sarah, Duchess of York took the decision to stay away from the King’s traditional Christmas gathering at Sandringham in a bid to avoid further embarrassment for the royal family.\n\nFor all the latest news, visit the Belfast Live homepage here and sign up to our daily newsletter here.","url":"https://www.nation.lk/online/the-royal-family-s-brutal-2024-as-the-windsors-faced-major-health-challenges-289267.html","image":"https://i2-prod.belfastlive.co.uk/incoming/article30657013.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_The-royal-year.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-12-25 00:22:24","author":null,"language":"en","source_country":"lk","sentiment":-0.09},{"id":275907964,"title":"Christmas 2024, A Harbinger of Hope In Dark Days","text":"Many folk think that Canada Free Press is just “Judi and Brian.” But in Truth CFP is a combination of our loyal readers, columnists, its ‘feeders’ and commenters, in which Totsy, in far away Louisiana is still our ‘Comment Queen’.\n\nEarlier a Catholic priest we got to know back in Ontario, now serving in Cyprus in a church behind a barbwire fence, responded to our Merry Christmas wish: “I hope you have a great Christmas with very many happy memories of Christmases past.”\n\nThat message resonates with us because we know that Christmas for all of us is forever.\n\nChristmas 2024 is a special Christmas of Hope, as we patiently wait for the January 20 Inauguration of President-Elect Donald Trump, whose devoted intent is to return America to its glory.\n\nIt will, of course take infinite patience for us to wait it out—patience and unflagging hope.\n\nGod was with President Trump when he survived an assassination attempt on July 13 in Butler, Pa.\n\nHe rose to his feet after being hit with a bullet that grazed his ear, standing tall and telling rally attendees to “Fight!, Fight!, Fight!” giving us the kind of heartfelt hope that would see us through tumultuous, frightening times.\n\nWith the Almighty’s Help, all we need to see it through until January 20, 2025, is patience and the will to stay the course, hunger and the cold of winter notwithstanding.\n\nBetter days are just ahead, everyone.

The stated goal of this change is to reduce and prevent immigration fraud.\n\nIn a social media post, Miller said this will take effect in the spring and that it will be a temporary measure.\n\nA broader review of the express entry program is being conducted, and a future decision on the value of a job offer in that system will be made at that time.\n\nA labour market impact assessment, a key document required for an employer to hire a foreign worker, is currently worth 50 to 200 points in the express entry system.\n\nApplicants are not supposed to pay for these, but a black market has emerged where people are charging tens of thousands of dollars for these documents.\n\nApplications that are already in progress won’t be affected once this change takes effect.\n\nMiller also said the government is looking at ways to streamline Canada’s asylum system at that Dec. 17 press conference. This includes exploring options to “quickly deal with” illegitimate claims.\n\nThe government’s broader border measures plan to respond to Trump’s 25 per cent tariff threat also includes enhanced aerial surveillance and drug detection efforts.","url":"https://www.langleyadvancetimes.com/national-news/border-measures-begin-to-take-effect-in-response-to-trumps-tariff-threat-7729022","image":"https://www.bpmcdn.com/f/files/shared/feeds/gps/2024/12/web1_20241224101224-20241224101216-3968f8a2ef0d535a30f202d3a494123cf465a5fd2a3e40727c95610a70950a48.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-12-25 00:08:25","author":"The Canadian Press","authors":["The Canadian Press"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"ca","sentiment":-0.243},{"id":275907614,"title":"Expert calls Trump taunts ‘churlish’, urges Canada to focus on coming trade war","text":"U.S. president-elect Donald Trump and those in his corner continue to muse about annexing Canada, though Canadian officials have largely sidestepped those comments. \n\nIn a post on the social media platform X, Eric Trump shared a doctored photo of his father purchasing Canada, Greenland and the Panama Canal on Amazon, with the phrase “We are so back!!!”\n\nSince winning the presidential election in November, Trump has repeatedly referred to Canada as the “51st state.”\n\nOn Trump’s Truth Social platform, he’s also repeatedly referred to Prime Minister Justin Trudeau as the “governor” of Canada.\n\nTrump has also threatened 25 per cent tariffs against Canada, which has prompted discussions at both the federal and provincial levels on the best way to deal with the incoming Trump government.\n\nCarleton University professor Aaron Ettinger said federal officials have rightly been dismissing the social-media posts and maintained a “focus like a laser beam” on the real and “existential threat” of tariffs.\n\n“This strikes me as being profoundly unserious,” said Ettinger, who has studied Canada-U.S. relations during the first Trump presidency.\n\n“These are taunts; these are churlish provocations that are not mature, and do not reflect just how serious the coming trade war is,” he said.\n\nEttinger said Trump is likely continually posting about Canada because it plays well to his supporters, without being seen as a real threat of annexation.\n\n“We know his moves. He makes fun of, he belittles, he mocks, because he can,” he said. But he said that a vacuum of leadership in Ottawa from embattled Prime Minister Justin Trudeau is spurring “the freelancing of some of the provincial leaders” in response to Trump’s comments.\n\nFor example, Ontario Premier Doug Ford weighed in on Trump’s postings on Dec. 18, telling media that “we’ll never be the 51st state. We’re Canada; we’re proud to be Canadians. We’ll always fight for that.”\n\nEttinger said civil society is similarly better to focus on convincing Americans to not impose damaging tariffs on Canada, instead of amping up anti-Trump rhetoric.\n\n“Canadians should worry first about what Canada’s actual national interests are,” he said. “We’re not going to out-trash talk Donald Trump, so don’t even bother trying and focus instead on the core stuff that really matters.”\n\nIn response to Trump’s threats, the Trudeau Liberal government has unveiled a $1.3 billion spending package over six years to address Trump’s threats, which concern border security and the flow of illegal drugs into the United States.\n\nCanada’s ambassador to the U.S. Kirsten Hillman has repeatedly characterized Trump’s comments as gentle ribbing between two close countries.\n\nForeign Affairs Minister Mélanie Joly said on Dec. 13 that she has quipped to Republican senators that they could join Canada as the eleventh province.\n\nGreenland’s head of government, Múte Bourup Egede, suggested that Trump’s latest calls to purchase the territory from Denmark would be as meaningless as those made in his first term.\n\n“Greenland is ours. We are not for sale and will never be for sale,” he said in a statement. “We must not lose our years-long fight for freedom.”\n\nPanama President José Raúl Mulino has also rebuffed Trump’s musing about taking over the Panama Canal.\n\n“Every square metre of the canal belongs to Panama and will continue to,” he said in a video, to which Trump fired back on his social media site, “We’ll see about that!”","url":"https://www.langleyadvancetimes.com/national-news/expert-calls-trump-taunts-churlish-urges-canada-to-focus-on-coming-trade-war-7729031","image":"https://www.bpmcdn.com/f/files/shared/feeds/gps/2024/12/web1_20241224041248-20241224041244-676a82dcd4ddb8f749125209jpeg.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-12-25 00:08:25","author":"The Canadian Press","authors":["The Canadian Press"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"ca","sentiment":0.103},{"id":275906396,"title":"Wall Street rallies ahead of Christmas","text":"All told, the S&P 500 rose 65.97 points to 6,040.04.

She’s had to call for help many times.\n\nIn another instance, a child has constant nightmares about her father finding and killing her mum, who was violently assaulted by her dad before she left him.\n\nThe nine-year-old girl often says she’s sick so she can stay home from school to look after her mum. \n\nThese are just a handful of the horrifying stories recounted to Berry Street workers, with experts warning the Christmas break can mark a dangerous spike in FDV.\n\n“CONSTANT SENSE OF THREAT AND FEAR”\n\nThere were 8668 family violence incidents in Victoria last December, according to Crime Statistics Agency figures.\n\nThis is an average of 279 incidents per day, with a 33 per cent increase in incidents on Christmas Day (372 incidents).\n\nThis included 91 family violence orders breached and 79 assaults.\n\nBerry Street executive director Heidi Reid said demand for FDV support services increase by about a third around the Christmas period.\n\nShe said the holiday period can be especially tough for children in violent homes, as the break can remove routine, stability and safe spaces. \n\n“The violence doesn’t go away and it might be exacerbated at certain times such as Christmas,” Ms Reid said.\n\nReferring to the seven-year-old hiding her siblings away, Ms Reid said the world can be “terrifying” for children.\n\n“You can imagine a child at that age and that being their job, and the constant sense of threat and fear,” Ms Reid said.\n\n“They wouldn’t be able to concentrate in school, to play or explore the world — the world is terrifying for them.\n\n“All of those things become apart of the way the child views the world, safety and relationships.\n\n“That’s happening today in Melbourne, in Sydney, in our classrooms, really — kids that have to deal with that at home.”\n\nThe fear often doesn’t end when a woman leaves a violent relationship, with frontline workers from Berry Street recalling one instance of a teenager forced to see his violent father despite being old enough to make decisions about contact.\n\nThe boy is struggling at school, and while appearing disinterested in class, he’s actually been up most of the night worried about the next time he’ll see his father.\n\nHe’s frightened of his father, but more concerned with protecting his younger siblings during their visits.\n\nFormer Victoria Police acting chief commissioner Tim Cartwright worked as the Victoria Family Violence Reform Implementation Monitor (FVIRM) between 2016 and 2019, with the FVRIM’s work monitoring the implementation of recommendations from the Royal Commision into Family Violence concluding at the end of 2022.\n\nMr Cartwright, who has had more than 40 years experience in the police force, recalled being told of infants going quiet when their violent father had entered the room.\n\n“(The victim-survivor) would talk about how when her husband came into the room her infant at six months of age would go quiet on the bed, would stop squawking like young kids do and go into defensive mode,” Mr Cartwright said.\n\n“There’s so much more to understand, and it’s so concerning how these experiences affect kids.”\n\nAlso vice president at Berry Street, Mr Cartwright said it’s a “challenge” for young people who’ve experienced trauma “just to go about their daily lives”.\n\n“It’s a challenge for them to leave home in the morning, to go to school, to get themselves fed.”\n\nHe also admitted he’s “not at all proud” of how family and domestic violence was handled back in the 70s while he was a young constable.\n\n“(I saw) some of the most horrific acts, and sometimes it shakes your face in your community, and that’s a challenge for people that work in the field not to become too cynical,” he said, praising the resilience of victim survivors and all those who work to support them. \n\n“GUYS IN THE COMMUNITY HAVE A RESPONSIBILITY”\n\nWhile there’s been “enormous progress”, Mr Cartwright said there’s a long way to go in terms of addressing family and domestic violence.\n\n“I’d often think (change) would take 10 years, but this is a generation, this is changing a whole community,” he said.\n\n“There’s been enormous progress but we’ve got so far still to go.\n\n“I can’t see the community ever saying we’ve nailed violence against women and family violence.”\n\nHe expressed concern in the rise in misogyny spouted by men with large platforms — including Andrew Tate and Donald Trump — that young men might look up to.\n\n“Misogyny and these people being leaders for our young men really concerns me,” he said.\n\nHe said there are “so many opportunities for leadership in our community”, including local sport clubs.\n\n“People, particularly men, don’t realise younger men watch them … hear what they say,” he said.\n\n“Guys in the community have a responsibility to be a (role model) for younger men.\n\n“The way they treat each other in the sporting field goes towards how young men see them.”\n\nHe urged men to model “better examples” for younger men.\n\nCHILDREN FEEL “TRAPPED” OVER HOLIDAYS\n\nAustralian Association of Psychologists president Sara O’Doherty said children in DV situations could feel “trapped” during the holiday period as there are “fewer outlets than the family home” available, which could spark symptoms of PTSD.\n\nThis could give children a higher susceptibility to other mental health disorders, Ms O’Doherty said.\n\nReflecting on the seven-year-old girl hiding her siblings from her hammer-wielding father, Ms O’Doherty said children in DV situations can feel a heightened sense of responsibility to look after their parents and/or siblings, referred to as “parentification”.\n\n“An eldest child (can take) on a lot of those adult responsibilities of either caring for an unwell parent or a parent who’s not coping or having to look after their younger siblings,” she said.\n\n“They’ve recognised that their parental figures are not at that point in time capable of managing that situation.”\n\nCRUCIAL WARNING SIGNS\n\nMs O’Doherty said a safety plan is crucial for the holiday period where violence may be escalated by added stressors including increased alcohol consumption, which could include having a trusted GP, counselling service, or friends and family members to visit “as a way of getting out of the house”.\n\nShe also urged people to look out for changes in behaviour among children, which could appear as children being more tired or more reserved.\n\n“If they are less interactive, if they look as though they haven’t slept or if they’re refusing food, and also if there are unexplained injuries” she said.\n\n“If it’s a close family member or a friend and they’re used to seeing a child being bright and interactive and their behaviour suddenly changes to be more withdrawn or more clingy to their parents, or just more distant, hiding.\n\n“Those changes to behaviour are what we need to look out for.”\n\nShe encouraged parents to get children in touch with a child psychologist or school counsellor as “early intervention is key” to develop skills “necessary to overcome fears, stress and anxiety at an earlier age”.\n\n“It’s going to then set them in good stead for later on,” Ms O’Doherty said.\n\n“WE ALL KNOW SOMEONE”\n\nAs the Christmas break approaches Ms Reid echoed Ms O’Doherty’s call to look for these changes in children’s behaviour.\n\n“We all know someone who is experiencing violence because when you look at statistics, you can’t not — but yet many people wouldn’t be able to recognise that, the questions to ask … How to gently ask if people needed support,” she said.\n\n“Offering a really safe space in which you can talk to children and listen to what they might be trying to say and communicate.”\n\nMs Reid also emphasised that leaving a domestic violence situation is a complex process.\n\n“Leaving is a process, not an event,” she said.\n\n“It’s very complex, so asking questions in a avery non-judgmental way, recognising that they’re probably very, very scared,” she said.\n\nMr Cartwright issued a similar message.\n\n“Listen, be empathetic, and believe them,” he said.","summary":"Stories of an infant being

truly can't abide - Vice President Kamala Harris and Teamsters Union President Sean O'Brien (SOB for short).\n\nYou know POTATUS always has loved to tout his reportedly humble roots - the whole 'Joe from Scranton' schtick - and hobnobbing with union workers has been his meat and potatoes move. \n\nLOOK AT ME, JUST A REGULAR GUY RELATING TO WORKING SCHLUBS\n\nHe fashioned himself as organized labor's champion, and they fell for it, supporting him for decades' worth of \"Union Joe\" campaigns.\n\nBiden’s labor report card: Historian gives ‘Union Joe’ a higher grade than any president since FDRPresident Joe Biden came into the White House intent on being \"the most pro-union president leading the most pro-union administration in American history.\" Four years later, he has shown a lot of progress.Joe Biden has pledged repeatedly to go further than any of his predecessors with his support for U.S. labor rights.“I intend to be the most pro-union president leading the most pro-union administration in American history,” Biden said at a White House meeting in September 2021 that brought together ordinary workers, labor leaders and government officials.He has expressed this intention many times, sometimes clarifying his goals.For example, in 2023 he said in Chicago that his administration was “making it easier to empower workers by making it easier to join a union.”Based on my research regarding the history of organized labor in America, I would give Biden an A-minus for his record on workers rights. In my view, the man dubbed “Union Joe” has lived up to the claim, with one notable error.\n\nAs the 2024 election started heating up, with POTATUS now publicly fading away - his handlers found it impossible to keep the vegetative state hidden any longer, particularly after the disastrous debate performance - Trump sensed an opening in what had always been a damn near impenetrable Democratic labor vote block.\n\nHe knew that in spite of whatever labor leaders mouthed, their rank-and-file members were hugely unhappy with the direction of the economy, and becoming restless. There was dissention in the ranks the likes of which had never been seen before. Were union members at the point where they would be willing to break free of leadership's political diktats?\n\nBack in May, Trump was already nibbling around the edges of Teamsters traditional Democratic loyalty, when he held that wonderful Bronx rally. He spent much of it telling New York construction stories - had to work with lots of unions - and called Teamsters out specifically. I had live-blogged that rally and picked right up on the outreach:\n\n...6:39 Just took a shot at the judge.\"Do we have any Teamsters here?\" Oh smart smart smart talking about working with them for the concrete on the rink. And of course tons of hoots from Teamsters in the audience.6:37 Telling the ice rink anecdote and how they told him to use rubber hose \"I like that that's cheaper\" in that Trump accent. Hilarious.\n\nThen Trump took a calculated gamble and invited Teamsters President Sean O'Brien to speak at the Republican National Convention, to the gobsmacked astonishment of the GOP establishment and delight of the nascent, reborn big tent Republican Party. \n\nThe astounding, unprecedented olive branch was a thunderclap that rippled through Teamsters membership like seismic waves after a quake.\n\nRepublicans wanted to hear from THEM?\n\nBREAKING: After receiving an invitation from Trump, Sean O'Brien, the leader of one of the biggest labor unions in the world will be speaking at the RNC Convention.

Teamsters has many of their members in the biggest swing states, if Trump can activate them, the election is WON bigly\n\nAnd when O'Brien accepted and stepped to the podium last July...BOOMITY.\n\nSo incredibly significant that they gave Sean O'Brien @TeamsterSOB this prime slot, when Trump was already in the audience. Speaks volumes. And the applause is raucous!— Batya Ungar-Sargon (@bungarsargon) July 16, 2024\n\nIt was a labor-rhetoric-filled barnburner, with no endorsement of Trump at all, BUT.\n\nO'Brien was there and free to say what he had to say, and all million-plus members of his union witnessed it, as well as every other organized labor union in the country.\n\nYou know where O'Brien wasn't?\n\nAt the Democratic National Convention.\n\nTo use the phrase Axios employed, the DNC 'ghosted' the Teamsters boss. And he had to ask them for a chance to address delegates, unlike the GOP invite.\n\nWell...huh.\n\nDNC makes Teamsters president sweatTeamsters President Sean O'Brien has been ghosted by the Democratic National Convention after his request to speak this week in Chicago.Why it matters: At least seven leaders of major labor unions were set to take the DNC stage tonight, but O'Brien has become persona non grata in some Democratic circles.\"We didn't get a response to our request for him to speak,\" Kara Deniz, a Teamsters spokesperson, told Axios.The Teamsters boss became the first-ever union president to speak at an RNC last month, delivering fiery remarks before a party that has a track record of opposing labor movements.Rank-and-file Teamsters retirees have been invited to attend the DNC, a sign that O'Brien's snub is personal, The Bulwark reports.\n\nThe snub was 'personal.' Tactical error there.\n\nThis quick snippet from Batya Ungar Sargon with Megyn Kelly, besides the Trump-O'Brien RNC dynamic, also sheds some light on the UAW membership shifting.\n\nUnion Politics:The democrats banned Teamsters President Sean O'Brien from the DNC after he spoke at the RNCAlso, did you know that more than 25% of UAW members are not auto workers?

Other candidates, including Trump, answered them all.“On the fourth question, one of her operatives or one of her staff slips a note in front of me — ‘This will be the last question.’ And it was 20 minutes earlier than the time it was going to end,” O’Brien told Carlson.“And her declaration of the way out was, ‘I’m going to win with you or without you,’’ he recalled.\n\nThat's a rocky start.\n\nBut it got worse. \n\nHarris waggled a demanding finger in one of O'Brien's vice president's faces in a receiving line, with repeated, \"You BETTER GET ON BOARD\" demands.\n\nWhen he heard about it the next day, O'Brien was incensed and made a phone call to Biden’s former Secretary of Labor Marty Walsh.\n\nKamala Harris's argument for the Teamsters endorsement, one of the largest labor unions in the world, \"You better get on board!\"They did not get on board.Teamsters President Sean O'Brien on Kamala Harris: \"Who does this f**king lady think she is?\" pic.twitter.com/XAv42dfYFW— Brigitte Gabriel (@ACTBrigitte) December 24, 2024\n\nI mean, this is just astonishing stuff.

For example, this Xweet highlights how local Teamsters councils bucked leadership to endorse Harris-Walz independently because O'Brien is, what? Mean?\n\nSo frickin' virtue-signaling what?\n\nTheir membership went for Trump overwhelmingly.\n\nI've got it in the headlines today, but it's a great headline from Politico, and this Tucker interview (whole thing here) sure puts paid to the old line \"If you're in a hole, stop digging.\"\n\nThere are many contributing factors, but the attitude @KamalaHarris and other top @TheDemocrats displayed when they said things like \"You better get on board\" to a @Teamsters executive hurt.

Or will an age of darkness and cold do it instead?\n\nIran sits on some of the most expansive energy reserves in the world, both in oil and natural gas. Had they spent the last two decades developing those fields rather than nuclear weapons, perhaps Iranians would be able to turn on the lights and the heat this winter. Instead, the teetering mullahcracy faces a potentially destabilizing energy crisis, right when they face other pressures related to their decisions in their conflict with Israel:\n\nGovernment offices in Iran are closed or operating at reduced hours. Schools and colleges have moved to online only. Highways and shopping malls have descended into darkness, and industrial plants have been denied power, bringing manufacturing to a near halt.Although Iran has one of the biggest supplies of natural gas and crude oil in the world, it is in a full-blown energy crisis that can be attributed to years of sanctions, mismanagement, aging infrastructure, wasteful consumption — and targeted attacks by Israel.\n\nThe \"targeted attacks by Israel\" are just a handy excuse for the regime, and not much of one at that. Israel attacked those targets because Iran decided to change strategy and attack Israel directly in the larger war after the October 7 massacres. The Iranians found out the hard way that the Israelis were better equipped and had better intelligence despite being the much smaller nation -- a David against a Goliath, as it were, especially with Bashar al-Assad in the way. Even then, Israel largely avoided the energy industry in its attacks at the behest of Joe Biden, who for some reason wants to preserve the mullahs' grip on Iran.\n\n\"Targeted attacks by Israel\" will be the regime's excuse for their own incompetence. Not that it seems to be working with ordinary Iranians this time:\n\nFor most of last week, the country was virtually shut down to save energy. As ordinary Iranians fumed and industrial leaders warned that the accompanying losses amounted to tens of billions of dollars, Mr. Pezeshkian could offer no solution other than to say he was sorry.\n\nWhile the mullahs have poured billions of dollars into their nuclear-weapons program and even more billions into its proxy terrorist networks, they have allowed their traditional energy industry to crumble. The regime has now reached the eating-the-seed-corn stage of collapse, where rationing now takes energy away from actual energy production in order to prevent the collapse of residential service in the short run:\n\nThe government faced two stark choices. It either had to cut gas service to residential homes or shut down the supply to power plants that generated electricity.It chose the latter, as turning gas off to residential units would come with serious safety hazards and would cut off the primary source of heat for most Iranians.\n\nWinter has only just started. Tehran's average high temperatures in December are around 50 degrees, with average lows in the 30s. The average low temperature will not rise above 60 degrees until May. That's five months of energy rationing for both gas and electricity in a nation that should easily be a net exporter, and that assumes that Iranian industry will survive to rebound once cold weather departs and energy can be rationed in a different direction. \n\nThe Iranians can't blame that on sanctions, either, nor on the Israelis. That is a failure of investment, the result of throwing away a fortune on Hezbollah and theocratic adventurism. Even if Iran can't export these energy resources, nothing prevented them from building the infrastructure to make full domestic use of their massive natural gas and oil reserves. The mullahs chose terrorism over their own people.\n\nWith that in mind, perhaps Ali Khamenei should consider that Donald Trump might be doing them a favor with a new \"maximum pressure\" campaign:\n\nPresident-elect Donald J. Trump will encounter an Iran that is suddenly far more brittle than it was during his first administration, its leadership more uncertain, its nuclear program more exposed and vulnerable to attack.That new reality has touched off an internal debate about how his administration should approach Tehran: with an openness to negotiations, or with an attack on its nuclear enrichment program — overt or covert, or perhaps initiated by Israel.Or, as many suggest, a round of “coercive diplomacy” that leaves Tehran to choose either a negotiated disassembly of its nuclear capability, or a forced one.\n\nThe mullahs' best bet for survival is to end its attempts to dominate the region by force and start investing in its own infrastructure. That's clearly true even without Trump leading another crippling economic war against Tehran, but even more true with that as background. Forty-five years of theocratic imperialism has landed Iran in a new and literal Dark Age, and it won't be long before the restive Iranian people take this choice out of their hands.","url":"https://hotair.com/ed-morrissey/2024/12/24/guess-whos-having-an-energy-crisis-n3798195","image":"https://media.townhall.com/cdn/hodl/2024/299/13c0f8a6-fa27-44e9-a1fe-2e6b814bd3cb.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-12-24 23:46:24","author":"Ed Morrissey","authors":["Ed Morrissey"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.358},{"id":275905056,"title":"When Whoopi Goldberg Is the Voice of Reason...","text":"Far be it from me to claim that Whoopi Goldberg is a reasonable person. \n\nReason requires connection to reality, and connection to reality and \"Host of The View\" are mutually exclusive terms. \n\nBut at least Whoopi spent a few moments as a tourist in the real world, and it was so jarring to faux-Republican Ana Navarro that she nearly had a breakdown.

Because we have the luxury of saying that because we're legal, we are successful, we are –GOLDBERG: Listen –NAVARRO: If you are an illegal immigrant in this country, you're not going to be not in panic! If you are a woman working for the Department of Defense, you have a right to be in a panic!GOLDBERG: Ana, you tell people to say fraught and like this! That is not --NAVARRO: No, I'm telling people to prepare, Whoopi! I'm telling people to prepare!GOLDBERG: You think they aren't prepared? They are prepared.

I'm sorry.NAVARRO: I mean, I disagree!GOLDBERG: Winter is – Babe, winter is here! Winter has been with us!“Yeah, but my point to you is we are in a privileged position that a lot of people are going to be under his attack are not!” Navarro shrieked. “I have a family who is going through the same thing! Ana, calm down!” Goldberg shot back.\n\nPanic. It is the cure for what ails you in Navarro's world. \n\nI'm not quite sure what women who work for the Department of Defense have to worry about unless Navarro means women with testicles. Last I checked, Trump didn't kick all the women out of the military or anything like that. As for Hegseth, the position he has staked out with the Senators he has met with has been that anybody who can meet the same stringent standards required of all people will be treated equally. \n\nIf spreading panic isn't exactly in the spirit of the season, as even Goldberg understands, it certainly is in the spirit of the modern Democratic Party. But people aren't buying what these people are selling. It is too exhausting, too unrealistic, and most of all, it is in the service of an ideology that people reject. \n\nAna Navarro may want us all to be panicked because illegal aliens are no longer welcome, she will find herself lonely in today's America. \n\nPeople are a lot more afraid of that Guatemalan guy on the subway than of Donald Trump.","url":"https://hotair.com/david-strom/2024/12/24/when-whoopi-goldberg-is-the-voice-of-reason-n3798209","image":"https://media.townhall.com/cdn/hodl/2021/356/7511b2fc-eb69-435b-ace2-66a3e214faf5.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-12-24 23:46:24","author":"David Strom","authors":["David Strom"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.047},{"id":275905036,"title":"A Liberal Hate Fest for the Holidays","text":"Below is my column in The Hill on the rising rage of the holiday on the left as we approach the second Trump inauguration.

The situation has Canada’s regional leaders hopping on flights to influence the incoming Trump administration themselves. For Yukon Premier Ranj Pillai, that led to chewing the fat with the president-elect’s eldest son, Donald J. Trump Jr., over meals of black bear spring rolls, turkey, deer and oysters at a hunting lodge in North Carolina. Don Jr., as he’s often called, has frequented the Yukon for hunting trips, a passion Pillai shares. And the Trumps have ties to the region. More than a century ago, Donald Trump Sr.’s grandfather Friedrich Trump capitalized on the Yukon gold rush with a restaurant, bar and brothel in a remote town close to the northern territory’s border. “I made sure that I brought him, Don, some clothing, because I wanted to remind him that the Trump family businesses were Yukon-built,” Pillai said by phone. The two first met at a conference in Nevada a few months prior. Pillai said the conversations were “incredibly positive” and an opportunity to “share some data points” and argue that the US-Canada trading deficit that stokes the president-elect’s ire “is only because we’re sending raw materials to them, and they’re creating jobs and value from that.” They also discussed the Yukon’s efforts on Arctic security and “opportunities to secure supply chains inside of North America.” Some of those projects are already happening. Earlier this month, the US Department of Defense and the Canadian government jointly announced they’d invest in a Yukon tungsten mining project. Although Trump Jr. was quick to point out that he has no official role in the upcoming administration, people connected to the transition team were present over the weekend, Pillai said. The premiers of Canada’s provinces and territories are trying to set up formal meetings with Trump’s transition team before Jan. 20, he added, sharing his worry that the federal government could be doing more. “I’ve had some very, very brief dialog with Dominic LeBlanc, but other than that there does not seem to be a full-scale strategy coming from Ottawa, with a series of different ministers taking on certain responsibilities,” Pillai said, referring to new Finance Minister LeBlanc. He replaced Trudeau’s longtime deputy Chrystia Freeland after she dramatically resigned Dec. 16, destabilizing Trudeau’s government.

Harris' alleged attitude likely didn't win her any favors from the union leader.\n\nO'Brien, who was a guest on The Tucker Carlson Show, told the host about a meeting he had with the vice president in July shortly after President Biden withdrew from the race. \n\nAccording to O'Brien, an angry Harris lashed out at the Teamsters during a roundtable discussion in which she only answered three of16 planned questions.\n\nHe told Carlson Harris demanded: \"Teamsters? You better get on board. Better get on board soon.\"She then cut the roundtable abruptly short, leaving 20 minutes early. But on her way out, she made O'Brien one more promise.\n\nO'Brien recalled she told him: \"I'm going to win with you or without you!\" He added his reaction was one of shock: \"Who does this f------ lady think she is?\" \n\nCarlson was equally stunned, replying: \"D---. I thought I was arrogant. That's really arrogant.\"\n\nIn the final days before the election, O’Brien announced that for the first time since 1996 the Teamsters would not be endorsing a presidential candidate. \n\nThe Teamsters backed the Biden-Harris ticket in 2020 and endorsed Hillary Clinton over Donald Trump in 2016.As RadarOnline.com previously reported, Harris' campaign dropped a massive amount of money on celebrity influencers, radical activist groups, and private jets in her failed bid for the White House. And she wants that money back.\n\nOver a week after the election wrapped, the campaign was still seeking more donations via email and text.\n\nOne of the text messages begged: \"Hi Team, It's Kamala, The election isn't what we wanted, but I will never give up the fight.\n\n\"And right now there are still a number of critical races across the country that are either too close to call, or within the margin of recounts or certain legal challenges.”\n\nAccording to two campaign officials, the donation requests were meant for the Democratic National Committee to help assist with state recounts or curing ballots.Many campaign officials have questioned the request for donations and suggested the money could allegedly go towards paying off the massive debt.\n\nA senior campaign official called it \"appalling,\" while another said it was \"disgusting.\"\n\nHarris soon discovered the only thing voters were willing to donate was their frustration. Users took to X to mock Harris for the request.\n\nOne user wrote: \"Are you kidding me? SKamala Harris is asking for donations to fund a recount. Seriously?\"\n\nAnother claimed: \"Harris is sending me emails to help pay off her huge balance for her failed election. They are looking for funds to pay off their debts to the celebrities who sold their souls to perform for her.\"\n\nA third user alleged: \"Kamala Harris wants a vote RECOUNT. What’s even more hilarious is that she’s asking for CAMPAIGN DONATIONS to do it. Could it be that she’s just bamboozling her supporters to try to pay for the $20 million in debt she ran up??!\"","summary":"Kamala Harris has been slammed by the president of the Teamster's Union for her perceived 'arrogance' in the final days of the presidential campaign.","url":"https://radaronline.com/p/kamala-harris-union-boss-win-election-loss-donald-trump/","image":"https://media.radaronline.com/brand-img/ZZK6IUioF/0x0/union-kamala-harris-1735074995780.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-12-24 23:30:00","author":"Radar Staff","authors":["Radar Staff"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.497},{"id":275902834,"title":"Zoho CEO Sridhar Vembu tried to hire Donald Trump's AI advisor Sriram Krishnan: 'Wanted to recruit him in...","text":"Zoho CEO Sridhar Vembu recently shared an interesting story about Indian-American venture capitalist Sriram Krishnan, who has been appointed as Senior White House Policy Adviser on Artificial Intelligence under US President-elect Donald Trump.

Report claims...","text":"The US could withdraw from the World Health Organization (WHO) as early as the first day of Donald Trump’s potential second term, according to health law expert Lawrence Gostin. According to Reuters, Gostin, a professor at Georgetown University and director of the WHO Collaborating Center on National and Global Health Law, revealed, “I have it on good authority that [Trump] plans to withdraw, probably on Day One or very early in his administration.” This move aligns with Trump’s previous criticisms of the WHO, which he accused of failing to hold China accountable during the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic. He has often described the agency as being under Beijing's influence. Critics warn that such a withdrawal could weaken global health systems and reduce the US's influence in international health initiatives. The Trump administration had initiated a withdrawal from the WHO in 2020, but the process was reversed by President Joe Biden six months later. Trump has since nominated outspoken critics of the organisation, including vaccine skeptic Robert F Kennedy Jr, for key health roles. According to the report, experts caution that leaving the WHO could harm global disease surveillance and pandemic response, giving other nations, such as China, more influence in global health governance. \"The US would lose clout, and a weakened WHO could endanger the world,\" Gostin warned.","url":"https://www.dnaindia.com/world/report-donald-trump-plans-to-withdraw-us-from-who-during-second-term-report-claims-3124031","image":"https://cdn.dnaindia.com/sites/default/files/styles/half/public/2024/12/24/2668528-2641615-donald-trump-reuters.png","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-12-24 23:23:24","author":"Shivam Verma","authors":["Shivam Verma"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"in","sentiment":-0.246},{"id":275903942,"title":"Aspiring MAGA congresswoman performs mock ‘execution’ of migrant in disturbing campaign video","text":"Aspiring congresswoman and controversial MAGA cheerleader Valentina Gomez has sparked outrage once again after posting a video in which she appears to simulate executing an immigrant.\n\nThe 25-year-old, who tried and failed to be elected as the Missouri Secretary of State earlier this year, said in the disturbing clip that undocumented persons who committed violent crimes “deserve to be ended.”\n\nIn the video, posted to X on Monday, Gomez is seen firing a handgun into the back of the head of a dummy tied to a chair with a black bag over its head.\n\n“It’s that simple, public executions for any illegal that rapes or kills an American. They don’t deserve deportation, they deserve to be ended,” she says.\n\nThe video has been flagged by X as potentially violating the platform’s rules against “violent speech,” but it had not been removed as of Tuesday. “Public executions for any illegal that rapes or kills an American.” Gomez captioned the video.\n\nIt quickly sparked outrage from other social media users, with some branding the Colombian native as a “psychopath.” “What’s wrong with these people?” one wrote.\n\n“They’re unhinged, mentally ill, and sociopathic,” replied another.\n\nCritics even included the president of Colombia, Gustavo Petro, who wrote: “She is not just an American fascist. She is Colombian. And being a migrant, what she wants is to unleash hatred against migrants. Most Americans are killed by Americans.”\n\nHowever, others seemed to agree with Gomez’s stance, including fellow MAGA firebrand and Trump acolyte Laura Loomer who posted. “Love this.”\n\nAfter X started restricting the video, Gomez claimed that she was “the biggest threat to the establishment because I call it like I see it.”\n\n“I give people hope, and I don’t need their money. Remember, nobody is coming to save us. Stay strapped,” she said.\n\nThe sentiment of Gomez’s video echoes that of President-elect Donald Trump, who has previously called for expanding the death penalty to those people who have arrived in the country illegally who kill a citizen or police. Trump has railed against Joe Biden’s decision to pardon the majority of federal death row inmates. \n\nGomez has frequently shared outrageous or shocking videos on her social media pages and has consequently been banned from Instagram.\n\nIn previous clips she frequently used homophobic slurs, and in one video, set two LGBTQ-inclusive books on fire. She has characterized the literature as “grooming, indoctrinating and sexualizing.”\n\nDuring the 2024 election campaign she called Vice President Kamala Harris a “hoe” and “little b****”, used the word “f****t” to describe transgender people and described Democrats as “full of gay s***”, among other things.\n\nHer bold rhetoric ultimately did not play well with voters. Gomez gained only 7.4 per cent of the vote with finishing sixth out of eight candidates in the race for Missouri Secretary of State.\n\nLast week she announced that she was running for Congress in Texas and relocating to the state to challenge Republican congressman Dan Crenshaw’s seat. “I don’t fear pdfs, criminals, or the crooks in DC. I only fear God,” she wrote in a post announcing the move.","summary":"Valentina Gomez, who lost the race to become Missouri Secretary of State earlier this year, that undocumented persons who committed violent crimes ‘deserve to be ended’","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/valentina-gomez-migrant-execution-video-b2669740.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2024/12/24/22/newFile-1.jpg?quality=75&width=1200&auto=webp","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/XYBsiWpV-4VHSaSK0.mp4","publish_date":"2024-12-24 23:21:04","author":"Mike Bedigan","authors":["Mike Bedigan"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.43},{"id":275903144,"title":"Controversial Ex-Democrat Says Trump Team More 'Humane' to Her Than DNC","text":"What's NewProminent Democratic National Committee (DNC) fundraiser Lindy Li has announced her departure from the Democratic Party, citing a toxic internal culture and backlash over her critiques of Vice President Kamala Harris and President Joe Biden.In a series of media appearances, Li has claimed that allies of Donald Trump have been more \"humane\" to her than her former party.Newsweek has reached out to Lindy Li for comment.Why It MattersLi likened her exit to \"leaving a cult,\" sparking debate about dissent within the party.

It is a constitutional duty that essentially requires her to oversee the certification of her 2024 rival’s decisive victory.\n\nTo get to a swift and professional counting session, the House on Jan. 3 — or perhaps in the following two days — would need to elect a speaker, who would then administer the oath of office to the newly elected and reelected members. \n\nIf a protracted speaker fight lasts beyond 1 p.m. on Jan. 6, congressional scholars agree there are procedural options that could help ensure the counting and certifying of Electoral College votes that day. But that could prove difficult following yet another span of GOP infighting over government funding and the debt ceiling that saw Speaker Mike Johnson battling rebellious conservatives. \n\nThe drama has raised fresh questions about the Louisiana Republican’s fate in the next Congress and whether he would be able to comfortably win the floor vote for speaker on Jan. 3. \n\n‘One big gray area’\n\nAs speaker, Johnson will not have a presiding official role during the Jan. 6 counting session. But what happens — or does not happen — in the three days before would be crucial. \n\n“The country would be going into one big gray area,” Steve Smith, a professor of political science and global studies at Arizona State University, said about a speaker fight extending into Jan. 6. “The one precedent that is clear and could help determine what happens is at the start of a new Congress, the election of the speaker is the first thing the House does.”\n\n“Nothing else happens until the speaker is elected. It’s been that way since 1789 when the first Congress convened,” Smith said. “Now, that worked just fine for the first Congress. But that could prove problematic here.”\n\nAlready, Kentucky Republican Rep. Thomas Massie has said he would not vote for Johnson on the floor during the scheduled Jan. 3 speaker election. With House Republicans holding only a razor-thin majority in the 119th Congress, Johnson can’t afford more than a few defections. \n\nThe House clerk presides over speaker elections, including at the start of a new Congress. Among the early actions on Jan. 3, according to a Congressional Research Service report, the clerk will order a quorum call before the House proceeds to the floor election for speaker, which the clerk will conduct with the assistance of tellers. \n\nBut even if a speaker is not elected in time for Jan. 6, multiple congressional and legal scholars told CQ Roll Call that the clerk – if both parties agree — could potentially swear in all House members because the Constitution grants the chamber exclusive authority to organize itself. \n\nWhile there is no precedent in U.S. history to guide House members through such a scenario, they likely have the authority to, as Smith put it, “make up a precedent.”\n\nAnd, should that be necessary, he said one option would be to reach an agreement under which “the clerk could organize the House and even allow for the Jan. 6 count to proceed — speaker or no speaker.”\n\nDerek Muller, a professor at the University of Notre Dame Law School, said the Constitution gives the House the authority to organize itself, which would give members enough legal wiggle room to find a way out of what would be an unprecedented situation.\n\n“They could elect an acting or temporary speaker, with a provision that the entire House would revisit the matter of a permanent speaker in X-number of days,” Muller said. \n\nA joint session without a speaker\n\nJustin Levitt, a law professor at Loyola Marymount University who served as senior policy adviser for democracy and voting rights in the Biden White House, said he thinks the joint session to count the electoral votes likely could proceed without a speaker.\n\nThe speaker has two formal roles on Jan. 6, Levitt said: selecting the two tellers who read out the votes and overseeing the House during any debates over objections to the Electoral College votes. \n\nLevitt said the teller portion could likely be handled by majority vote or unanimous consent and objections would be unlikely under the new, higher threshold to sustain them established by the 2022 overhaul to the law governing the counting of presidential electoral votes. Dubbed the Electoral Count Reform Act, the law was enacted as part of a bipartisan reaction to the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol and laid out specific procedures for presidential election certification, challenges and more. \n\nLevitt also said that although the regular House cannot do business without a speaker, it is a different body — constitutionally — when it is part of a joint session to count the votes.\n\n“I don’t think, as a constitutional matter, there is an impediment to members of the body proceeding with the electoral count if the body can’t do any work on its own without electing a speaker,” Levitt said.\n\nThe House, along with the Senate, also typically passes a concurrent resolution to enter in the joint session and lay out the procedures they will follow. Levitt pointed out that those same procedures are also laid out in the 2022 electoral count law, and Harris could rely on the statute to proceed with the count.\n\n“As far as the Constitution goes, all the things you need are the Senate, the House and the president of the Senate, who is the sitting vice president,” Levitt said.\n\nSarah Binder, a George Washington University political science professor, said she sees “a path to do this, technically,” that starts with what she dubbed “general parliamentary law.”\n\n“That’s what guides the House before it elects a speaker and adopts that speaker’s rule package. That’s rather amorphous,” Binder said. “There’s also the House Practice Manual.” Collectively, those procedure documents could serve as guardrails that would allow the joint session to go forward, she said. \n\nUnder this option, “the clerk would have procedural authority,” Binder said, though she added that “the clearest option would be, if there was the political will to do it, to elect a temporary speaker.”\n\nAll experts interviewed agreed that the best option would be a speaker elected on Jan. 3. The biggest force that could make that happen, they said, would be political pressure.\n\n“They would be, especially the Republicans, under tremendous pressure to select a speaker candidate and elect that person,” Muller said. “Trump would be applying that pressure once it became a question of his election being official on Jan. 6.”\n\nOf course, if Johnson cannot muster enough votes, another Republican would have to be willing to deal with a fractious conference and a mercurial Trump. \n\n“Anybody who wants it,” California Republican Rep. Tom McClintock said Sunday on NewsNation, “obviously isn’t in his right mind.”\n\nMichael Macagnone and Niels Lesniewski contributed to this report.","url":"https://rollcall.com/2024/12/24/protracted-gop-speaker-fight-could-complicate-electoral-college-count/","image":"https://rollcall.com/app/uploads/2024/12/GettyImages-2189981947.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-12-24 23:07:24","author":"Niels Lesniewski","authors":["Niels Lesniewski"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.342},{"id":275900710,"title":"Premiers clash over strategy as Trump tariffs threaten economy","text":"Reading Time: 4 minutes\n\nThe premiers acknowledge that Canada is facing a real struggle to overcome Trump’s tariff threat\n\nAs Chrystia Freeland’s resignation rocked Ottawa last Monday, Canada’s provincial premiers were gathered in Toronto. Hosted by Ontario Premier Doug Ford, they were meeting to develop a joint response to the potential tariffs on Canadian goods, including energy, by the incoming U.S. administration under Donald Trump. The premiers agreed that such tariffs would be disastrous for the Canadian economy.\n\nCanada and the U.S. are each other’s largest trade partners, with nearly $3.6 billion (US$2.7 billion) worth of goods and services crossing the border each day in 2023. This trade relationship is one of the largest bilateral partnerships in the world, with annual two-way trade nearing $1 trillion. Canada supplies 34 critical minerals and metals to the U.S. Canadian crude oil and electricity account for 60 per cent and 85 per cent of U.S. imports. Furthermore, Canada is the leading supplier of steel, aluminum, and uranium to the U.S.\n\nAt the Monday meeting, the premiers were divided on how to counter the Trump administration’s potential tariffs. Ontario Premier Doug Ford suggested suspending electricity exports to American customers, stating, “It would turn off the lights to a million-and-a-half Americans.” However, not all premiers supported matching export tariffs on Canadian goods, including oil and gas, to the U.S.\n\nThe rift among the premiers became apparent when Danielle Smith, the premier of Alberta, and Andrew Fury, the premier of Newfoundland and Labrador, discussed the issue at the Empire Club in Toronto. The timing of the Empire Club debate on the day following Freeland’s resignation gained greater significance in light of the tariff discussions.\n\nDanielle Smith argued that more needed to be done to address the concerns of the incoming U.S. administration. She suggested that presenting a security plan acceptable to the U.S. could help maintain good relations. Smith noted that Alberta is spending $29 million on enhancing border security to address U.S. concerns about securing Canadian borders and preventing the flow of drugs and illegal immigration. She also acknowledged that the fentanyl issue is a concern for Alberta and the rest of the country.\n\nSmith added that Alberta is uniquely positioned to help achieve U.S. energy security, which could serve as a bargaining chip with Washington. She criticized the Trudeau government’s energy policy, emphasizing that while reducing greenhouse emissions is important, Alberta has made significant efforts to address the issue. She stressed that meeting the net-zero targets within the specified timeframe would require cutting output by one million barrels per day (bpd) by 2030 and two million bpd by 2035. Smith emphasized that caps are not a viable solution and that Alberta would not accept such measures. She stated that Canadian prosperity relies on oil.\n\nSmith also said that Canada is a better, more reliable, and more responsible energy trading partner for the U.S. and the world compared to dictatorial regimes with worse environmental and humanitarian records.\n\nMeanwhile, Andrew Fury emphasized provincial leadership’s crucial role in managing oil and gas issues. He highlighted that the Atlantic Accord, an agreement with the federal government, guarantees joint management in both spirit and writing. This means that any decisions regarding emission caps require agreement between the energy minister and the premier of Newfoundland and Labrador. Fury pointed out that this agreement has not been honoured and said he will fight for the hard-working men and women in Newfoundland and Labrador’s energy industry.\n\nFury also noted that his province is making efforts to produce more energy and that the world needs more Canadian energy. He argued that Canada needed to negotiate from a position of strength and emphasized the importance of presenting a united front during negotiations with the incoming Trump administration.\n\nThe premiers recognized the reality of the tariff challenge and admitted that overcoming it will be difficult. They emphasized that maintaining a unified stance during negotiations is a key priority for the provincial leaders.\n\nToronto-based Rashid Husain Syed is a highly regarded analyst specializing in energy and politics, particularly in the Middle East.

He said on Dec. 9 that many countries had voters who would be “wondering about the choice they maybe made in elections,” and on Dec. 11 said the Nov. 5 defeat of U.S. Vice-President Kamala Harris in the presidential election was a setback for women.\n\nWith Trump threatening 25 percent tariffs on Canada if it does not take adequate steps to improve border security and stop the flow of illegal drugs and immigrants, Ottawa has been working on strengthening the Canada-U.S. border. The Canadian government recently announced a $1.3 billion border plan to tighten security, which includes creating a new North American task force targeting organized crime and drug trafficking and increasing funding for helicopters, drones, and surveillance towers.\n\nIn recent days, Trump has also spoken about purchasing Greenland from Denmark, an idea that Trump floated repeatedly during his first term as president.

The former Danish colony is strategically located about halfway along the shortest route from Europe and Russia to North America. It’s home to a large U.S. space facility and its proximity to the Arctic means that it plays a pivotal role in monitoring and managing Arctic security.\n\nThe Arctic also serves as the shortest route for intercontinental ballistic missiles traveling between the United States and Russia, elevating Greenland’s importance as a strategic security outpost in the current period of heightened rivalry between global great powers.\n\nThe United States also made previous offers to purchase Greenland, first in 1867 and again in 1946 under President Harry Truman. Each time, Denmark refused.\n\nFollowing Trump’s latest comment on wanting the Arctic island to come under U.S. control, Greenlandic Prime Minister Mute Egede dismissed any suggestions that Greenland is for sale.\n\n“Greenland is ours. We are not for sale and will never be for sale. We must not lose our long struggle for freedom,” Egede said in a Dec. 23 statement.\n\nChinese state media have identified Greenland as a critical strategic hub, citing its proximity to Arctic shipping lanes and its rich reserves of uranium and rare earth minerals. In 2019, the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) announced its “Polar Silk Road” initiative—an extension of its Belt and Road Initiative—aiming to develop Arctic shipping routes and encourage Chinese enterprises to invest in regional infrastructure projects.\n\nEconomic ties between Greenland and China have grown significantly over the past decade, driven by efforts to expand Greenland’s mineral mining, oil and gas exploration, and tourism sectors. Greenland’s increasing dependence on China has coincided with Beijing’s broader Arctic ambitions.\n\nGreenland is home to the Pituffik Space Base, formerly Thule Air Base, located in its remote northwest. The facility supports personnel from Denmark, Canada, Greenland, and the U.S. Space Force, serving as a hub for space surveillance activities. It also houses an Upgraded Early Warning Radar system, essential for detecting intercontinental ballistic missile launches from Russia, the Middle East, or missiles from North Korea and China that traverse the Arctic.","url":"https://www.theepochtimes.com/world/denmark-boosts-greenlands-military-defense-capacity-after-trumps-remarks-5781492","image":"https://img.theepochtimes.com/assets/uploads/2021/02/23/id5780839-Thule-Air-Base-300x180.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-12-24 23:02:24","author":"Tom Ozimek","authors":["Tom Ozimek"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.141},{"id":275900582,"title":"Supreme Court to Decide on Jan. 10 If It Will Hear Unusual Redistricting Appeal","text":"The U.S. Supreme Court said it will decide on Jan. 10, 2025, whether to hear an unusual racial gerrymandering appeal from North Dakota.\n\nThe lead appellee is former North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum, a Republican, who is being sued in his official capacity. Burgum’s term ended on Dec. 15.\n\nPresident-elect Donald Trump, who will be inaugurated on Jan. 20, has nominated Burgum to be U.S. Secretary of the Interior.\n\nBurgum will likely be replaced as a litigant with the new Republican governor, Kelly Armstrong, which is the usual practice when a government official leaves office midway through a lawsuit.\n\nTwo Republican-affiliated voters sued to challenge a redistricting plan passed by the state legislature.\n\nThe redistricting plan approved by a lower court allows the state to create two new minority-majority state legislative subdistricts in the state House to help elect local Native Americans.\n\nIn the state’s eyes, the problem with the case it won is that a three-member panel of federal district judges assumed that attempting to comply with the federal Voting Rights Act (VRA) justifies racial discrimination in validating the new subdistricts.\n\nThe VRA, enacted in 1965, prohibits racial discrimination in voting and was intended to enforce the 15th Amendment, which forbids the federal government from denying or abridging a citizen’s right to vote “on account of race, color, or previous condition of servitude.”\n\nThe plan that is the subject of the case passed the state legislature in 2021 and bisected two existing two-member districts in the state House of Representatives to create two new Native American-majority subdistricts that would each be represented by a single member.\n\nThe new political subdivisions include Indian reservations.\n\nThe other appellant, Paul Henderson, is active in the state GOP.\n\nThe two filed their lawsuit as voters, alleging that the plan amounted to unconstitutional racial gerrymandering that discriminates against non-minority voters.\n\nAt trial, they argued the newly drawn subdistricts violated the Equal Protection Clause of the 14th Amendment, while the state argued it had reason to believe the subdistricts were required by Section 2 of the VRA.\n\nThat section prohibits voting practices or procedures that discriminate on the basis of race, color, or membership in a large language minority group.\n\nIn November 2023, a three-judge panel of the U.S. District Court for the District of North Dakota dismissed the lawsuit at the behest of North Dakota and the Mandan, Hidatsa, and Arikara Nation.\n\nThe so-called MHA Nation, also known as the Three Affiliated Tribes, is located on the Fort Berthold Indian Reservation, near New Town, North Dakota.\n\nThe panel granted summary judgment to the state and the tribe, finding “that the state’s actions to draw the subdistricts in districts 4 and 9 satisfy strict scrutiny.”\n\nCourts use the strict scrutiny test when reviewing legislative or executive branch enactments that infringe on constitutional rights.\n\nA government interest is deemed compelling, and therefore in satisfaction of the test, when it is essential or necessary, as opposed to a matter of preference, choice, or discretion.\n\nWhenever a case involving compliance with Section 2 as a defense to racial gerrymandering has come before the High Court, the justices have struck down the plan in dispute, the voters argued in the statement.\n\n“As a matter of first principles, the state is unable to defend the basis” for the summary judgment, specifically, the district court’s assumption that attempting to comply with the VRA justifies racial discrimination,” the brief stated.\n\nIf complying with a federal statute requires the state to engage in racial discrimination, “the proper conclusion is not that the statute excuses the state’s discrimination, but that the statute is invalid,” the brief stated, quoting Justice Clarence Thomas’s dissent in Allen v. Milligan (2023).\n\nAlabama had asked the Supreme Court to weaken Section 2, arguing the U.S. Constitution required such remedial action, and the court refused.\n\nBurgum urged the Supreme Court to “reexamine the foundation” of the district court ruling’s “assumption.”\n\nHe asked the Supreme Court to vacate the panel’s decision and “make clear that a state’s attempted compliance with Section 2 of the VRA cannot provide a compelling justification for making race the predominate consideration in the design of an election map.”\n\nPrelogar said in a brief that the voters challenging the redistricting do not live in an affected subdistrict so they lack legal standing.\n\nStanding refers to the right of someone to sue in court. The parties must show a strong enough connection to the claim to justify their participation in a lawsuit.\n\nShe also said the district court was correct when it upheld the use of race to create the subdistrict.\n\nThe Epoch Times reached out to Walen’s attorney, Bryan Paul Tyson of Clark Hill in Atlanta, Georgia, the office of North Dakota Attorney General Drew Wrigley, and the U.S. Department of Justice for comment.\n\nNo replies were received by publication time.","url":"https://www.theepochtimes.com/us/supreme-court-to-decide-on-jan-10-if-it-will-hear-unusual-redistricting-appeal-5781401?cmt=1","image":"https://img.theepochtimes.com/assets/uploads/2024/11/15/id5760714-GettyImages-2162462393-300x180.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-12-24 23:02:24","author":"Matthew Vadum","authors":["Matthew Vadum"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.171},{"id":275900578,"title":"Apple Approaches $4 Trillion Valuation","text":"Apple is closing in on a historic $4 trillion stock market valuation.\n\nThe company has pulled ahead of Nvidia and Microsoft in the race to the monumental milestone, thanks to an about 16 percent jump in shares since early November that has added about $500 billion to its market capitalization.\n\nValued at about $3.90 trillion as of the last close, Apple dwarfs the combined value of Germany and Switzerland’s main stock markets.\n\nThe Silicon Valley firm, driven by the so-called iPhone supercycles, was the first U.S. company to hit previous trillion-dollar milestones.\n\nIn recent years, the company has attracted criticism for being slow to map out its artificial intelligence strategy, while Microsoft, Alphabet, Amazon, and Meta Platforms have pulled ahead to dominate the emerging technology.\n\nShares of Nvidia, the biggest AI beneficiary, have surged more than 800 percent over the past two years, compared to the near doubling in shares of Apple during the same period.\n\nApple earlier in December started integrating OpenAI’s ChatGPT into its devices after unveiling plans in June to integrate generative AI technology across its app suite.\n\nThe company expects overall revenue to increase “low- to mid-single digits” during its fiscal first quarter—a modest growth forecast for the holiday shopping season—sparking questions about the momentum for the iPhone 16 series.\n\nHowever, LSEG data showed analysts expect revenue from iPhones to rebound in 2025.\n\nThe recent surge in shares has pushed Apple’s price-to-earnings ratio to a near three-year high of 33.5, compared to 31.3 for Microsoft and 31.7 for Nvidia, according to LSEG data.\n\nWarren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway has sold shares of Apple—its top holding—this year, as the conglomerate broadly retreated from equities on concerns over stretched valuations.\n\n“I suspect the stock in three years will not look as expensive as it does today,” said Eric Clark, portfolio manager of the Rational Dynamic Brands Fund, which holds Apple shares.\n\nApple faces the risk of retaliatory tariffs if President-elect Donald Trump delivers on his promise to slap tariffs of at least 10 percent on goods coming from China.\n\n“We believe it’s likely Apple gets exclusions on products like iPhone, Mac and iPad, similar to the first round of China tariffs in 2018,” Woodring said.\n\nApple’s shares tumbled last Wednesday amid a Wall Street selloff after the Federal Reserve forecast a slower pace of rate cuts next year but investors expect the broad trend of monetary easing to support stock markets next year.\n\n“Technology has been regarded by investors as a new form of a defensive sector because of their earnings growth,” said Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA Research.\n\nThe Fed’s action “could end up having a greater impact on some of the other cyclical areas such as consumer discretionary and financials and less so on technology.”\n\n“Apple’s approach to $4 trillion market cap is a testament to its enduring dominance in the tech sector.

The former Danish colony is strategically located about halfway along the shortest route from Europe and Russia to North America. It’s home to a large U.S. space facility and its proximity to the Arctic means that it plays a pivotal role in monitoring and managing Arctic security.\n\nThe Arctic also serves as the shortest route for intercontinental ballistic missiles traveling between the United States and Russia, elevating Greenland’s importance as a strategic security outpost in the current period of heightened rivalry between global great powers.\n\nThe United States also made previous offers to purchase Greenland, first in 1867 and again in 1946 under President Harry Truman. Each time, Denmark refused.\n\nFollowing Trump’s latest comment on wanting the Arctic island to come under U.S. control, Greenlandic Prime Minister Mute Egede dismissed any suggestions that Greenland is for sale.\n\n“Greenland is ours. We are not for sale and will never be for sale. We must not lose our long struggle for freedom,” Egede said in a Dec. 23 statement.\n\nChinese state media have identified Greenland as a critical strategic hub, citing its proximity to Arctic shipping lanes and its rich reserves of uranium and rare earth minerals. In 2019, the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) announced its “Polar Silk Road” initiative—an extension of its Belt and Road Initiative—aiming to develop Arctic shipping routes and encourage Chinese enterprises to invest in regional infrastructure projects.\n\nEconomic ties between Greenland and China have grown significantly over the past decade, driven by efforts to expand Greenland’s mineral mining, oil and gas exploration, and tourism sectors. Greenland’s increasing dependence on China has coincided with Beijing’s broader Arctic ambitions.\n\nGreenland is home to the Pituffik Space Base, formerly Thule Air Base, located in its remote northwest. The facility supports personnel from Denmark, Canada, Greenland, and the U.S. Space Force, serving as a hub for space surveillance activities. It also houses an Upgraded Early Warning Radar system, essential for detecting intercontinental ballistic missile launches from Russia, the Middle East, or missiles from North Korea and China that traverse the Arctic.","url":"https://www.theepochtimes.com/world/denmark-boosts-greenlands-military-defense-capacity-after-trumps-remarks-5781492?cmt=1","image":"https://img.theepochtimes.com/assets/uploads/2021/02/23/id5780839-Thule-Air-Base-300x180.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-12-24 23:02:24","author":"Tom Ozimek","authors":["Tom Ozimek"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.141},{"id":275900408,"title":"Toyota Joins Ford in Donating $1 Million to Trump's Inauguration","text":"What's New?Toyota followed Ford's lead and donated $1 million toward President-elect Donald Trump's inauguration in January, The Hill reported.Why It MattersTrump has pledged to impose tariffs on Chinese, Canadian and Mexican goods, which could result in a 17 percent drop in automakers' profits, according to a recent report from S&P Global.Carmakers and tech giants appear to be trying to get ahead of that by gaining Trump's favor, by way of generous donations, before he takes office.Newsweek reached out to Toyota North America via phone and Ford via email for comment.What To KnowFord Motor Co. announced on Monday that it would donate $1 million and a small fleet of vehicles toward Trump's inauguration.Toyota North America followed suit on Tuesday, pledging $1 million to Trump's inaugural fund, which is a fundraising effort that supports the president-elect's inauguration and related events.Earlier this month, Meta, Amazon and Open AI CEO Sam Altman all pledged seven-figure donations to Trump's inauguration fund.Facebook's parent company announced it would donate $1 million to the fund, sparking anger from some on both sides of the political aisle. The announcement came two weeks after Meta founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg met with Trump at his Mar-a-Lago residence in Florida.Zuckerberg and Trump have had a strained relationship in recent years. Tensions between the two men hit a boiling point after Facebook banned Trump in the wake of the January 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol.Trump later repeatedly threatened to jail Zuckerberg, alleging that he personally conspired to rig the 2020 election against Trump. The Meta CEO, for his part, has publicly praised Trump, likely in an effort to defuse hostilities before Trump takes office.In addition to commending Trump's response to a July assassination attempt, Zuckerberg joined a slew of other business and tech moguls in congratulating Trump after he won the 2024 U.S. election.The Wall Street Journal reported earlier this month that Amazon would also be donating $1 million to Trump's fund, as will OpenAI's Altman.What People Are SayingSenator Elizabeth Warren criticized donations to Trump's inaugural fund, telling The Independent: Trump's \"reliance on private donors to fund the transition\" is \"nothing more than a ploy for well-connected Trump insiders to line their pockets while pretending to save taxpayers money.\"Ford CEO Jim Farley told reporters earlier this month that he's looking forward to working with the Trump administration: Given \"Ford's employment profile and importance in the US economy and manufacturing, you can imagine the administration will be very interested in Ford's point of view.\"What Happens Next?Trump's will be inaugurated on January 20 in Washington, D.C.At around noon, Trump will recite the following oath: \"I do solemnly swear (or affirm) that I will faithfully execute the Office of President of the United States, and will to the best of my ability, preserve, protect and defend the Constitution of the United States.\"","summary":"Toyota followed Ford's lead and donated $1 million towards President-elect Donald Trump's inauguration in January.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/toyota-donates-donald-trump-inauguration-2005872","image":"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2550442/donald-trump.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-12-24 22:56:15","author":"Hannah Parry","authors":["Hannah Parry"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.211},{"id":275899580,"title":"Eric Trump's Post About Buying Other Countries on Amazon Goes Viral","text":"What's NewEric Trump posted on social media Monday night, in an apparent joke about the United States being able to buy territories on Amazon, after his father, President-elect Donald Trump said he would take back the Panama Canal and buy Greenland.The post on X, formerly Twitter, received over 7,000 replies, with some calling the mock-up of an online shopping cart \"disrespectful\" and \"disturbing\", while others backed Trump's caption of: \"We are so back!!!\"Why It MattersThe post, while seemingly in jest, comes after the President-elect made more serious comments about owning and controlling Greenland, demanding the return of the Panama Canal, and that Canada could be the next U.S. state.

The caption read: \"We are so back!!!\"The post, which has also been shared over 13,000 times, came after a similar post on December 21, responding to a post from the President-elect on Panama, in which Eric Trump said: \"The grown-ups are back in charge\".The President-elect's first assertion that he could expand the U.S. came after announcing tariffs on Mexico, China and Canada over immigration and fentanyl flows, after which he said Canada could \"become the 51st State\".He then suggested the U.S. should buy Greenland, an autonomous territory that has been part of Denmark for 600 years. Trump previously floated the idea during his first term in the White House, and Greenland's leaders pushed back earlier this week saying: \"We are not for sale\".The President-elect also then threatened a demand for the return of the Panama Canal to U.S. control, if the Central American country failed to reduce the fees it charges American ships.His son's post was not received well by all, with some viewing it as aggressive toward other nations and hypocritical when Republicans have been vocal against Russia's invasion of Ukraine.

Bush, emphasized that Biden’s decision reflects a “regrettable failure” by the administration to support the judiciary and warned that it would exacerbate growing caseloads, further delaying justice for litigants.\n\nALL 13 OF BIDEN’S PRESIDENTIAL VETOES\n\n“The president’s veto will contribute to the pattern of growing caseloads and increasing backlogs that hurt litigants and weaken public confidence in our courts,” Conrad wrote in a statement on Tuesday, adding that Biden’s decision is “a deviation from the long historical pattern of approving judgeship bills that awarded new judgeships to sitting Presidents.”\n\n“The President’s veto is contrary to the actions of Senator Biden who helped pass many of those bills,” Conrad stated.\n\nThe JUDGES Act, which proposed a phased introduction of new judgeships across 25 federal district courts in 13 states — including California, Florida, and Texas — had garnered broad bipartisan support. The Senate passed the legislation unanimously in August, and the House approved it with a 236-173 vote on Dec. 12.\n\nHundreds of judges have called on Congress to add the 63 permanent seats and the three temporary seats the bill would have added. There are currently roughly 865 active federal judgeships, including the nine Supreme Court justices.\n\nDespite pleas from within the judicial branch, Biden cited concerns in his veto about the expedited approval process and the allocation of the judgeships, though deeper concerns among Democrats, like how Trump would gain roughly two-dozen more seats to fill in the next four years, complicated their support of the bill after the 2024 election.\n\nUniversity of Richmond Law professor Carl Tobias told the Washington Examiner the legislation became the closest to passing compared to any similar bill that has been proposed since 1990, the last time the number of judges was expanded in the federal judiciary.\n\nTobias emphasized the balance of interests Biden was considering when vetoing the bill, noting that close allies who sponsored the bill such as Sen. Chris Coons (D-DE) were let down but understood the president’s decision.\n\nCoons said he was “disappointed” by the veto not only for his state but “for the federal judges throughout the country struggling under the burden of ever-higher caseloads.” \n\nChief U.S. District Judge Randy Crane of the Southern District of Texas, whose district would have received four additional judgeships, described the veto as a significant blow to court efficiency, according to Reuters.\n\nThe timing of the bill’s passage, just after Republican President-elect Donald Trump’s victory in the Nov. 5 election, led to accusations from House Democrats like Rep. Jerrold Nadler (D-NY) that their GOP colleagues had reneged on promises to pass the bill in a nonpartisan manner. This political tension, coupled with Biden’s veto threat, fueled controversy over the bill’s fate.\n\nDespite the setback, judicial leaders remain hopeful that the legislation will be revived under the incoming Trump administration.\n\nTobias said he’s hopeful that lawmakers will be able to pass a similar measure over the next four years under Trump but warned, “I don’t think the votes are going to be there.”\n\n“Unless they want to blow up the Senate 60-vote filibuster over this issue,” Tobias said, adding he saw that as unlikely.\n\nAs the judiciary grapples with delays and overburdened courts, Biden’s veto has sparked a renewed debate over how Congress can come to an agreement to meet the needs of the federal judiciary.\n\nAlmost “everybody agrees that the need is there” for more judges, Tobias said, adding that there needs to be a compromise to push through additional judges “in a fair way that doesn’t advance one party or the other.”","summary":"Federal judiciary leaders have sharply criticized President Joe Biden’s veto of the JUDGES Act, a bipartisan bill that sought to add 66 new federal judgeships to address mounting caseloads in courts across the United States.

We are not for sale and will never be for sale,\" he said in a statement. \"We must not lose our years-long fight for freedom.\"\n\nTrump previously cancelled a 2019 visit to Denmark after his offer to buy Greenland was rejected by Copenhagen, and ultimately came to nothing.","summary":"Donald Trump has repeated calls for Greenland to be sold to the US, which it has rejected","url":"https://www.standard.co.uk/news/world/denmark-greenland-defence-donald-trump-us-control-b1201788.html","image":"https://static.standard.co.uk/2024/07/15/18/15173151-285830ba-c42f-4dc0-bcab-fcd37157636c.jpg?width=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-12-24 22:24:02","author":"Josh Salisbury","authors":["Josh Salisbury"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.237}]}
