But hard-line Republicans in his own party have voiced their opposition to the bill, which contains economic aid for those hit by recent hurricanes and some relief for farmers.\n\nIt looks like they’re taking their cues from the likes of failed presidential candidate and billionaire Vivek Ramaswamy, who Trump appointed to lead the advisory (and completely unofficial) Department of Government Efficiency alongside multibillionaire Elon Musk. The obscenely wealthy duo wants the bill killed.\n\nIn a TikTok video, Ramaswamy claimed that he read the entirety of the 1,500-page bill released Tuesday night “that blows away your taxpayer money.”\n\n“Real-time advice to Congress: go back to the drawing board, start with a blank slate & do this the right way,” Ramswamy later wrote.\n\nMusk also voiced his displeasure with the bill Tuesday, writing, “This bill should not pass.”\n\nIn a Wednesday morning appearance on Fox News, Johnson disclosed that he had been involved in a text chain with Musk and Ramaswamy overnight, trying to assuage their concerns over the legislation. Following that conversation, both billionaires have continued to attack the bill. Ramaswamy has even posted what he says should be a one-page “clean” funding bill that isn’t a “pork-fest” like the current legislation.\n\nEchoing the billionaires, Texas Sen. John Cornyn asked, “How on earth did a 3 month Continuing Resolution grow into this Cramnibus.” In response, Musk called it “a nightmare bill.”\n\n“Any member of the House or Senate who votes for this outrageous spending bill deserves to be voted out in 2 years!” Musk wrote in a separate post. Musk spent at least $250 million to help elect Trump and has said he will put more of his immense fortune into molding the Republican Party in his image.\n\nGeorgia Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene jumped on the bandwagon, writing, “I agree with @elonmusk and @VivekGRamaswamy 100% on the CR!”\n\nSimilarly, Florida Rep. Kat Cammack said she was against the bill and claimed the deal is “doing credible damage” to the party.\n\nIncredibly, even Trump is now reportedly expressing his opposition to the bill, according to Axios, while Politico reports that Johnson is already weighing a spending Plan B—which leads one to wonder who is truly wielding the most influence over the GOP.\n\nNot only is the current rebellion a headache for Johnson’s immediate concerns about the bill passing, but it could hurt his bid to be reelected speaker in January, when Congress reconvenes.\n\nRep. Thomas Massie told reporters that he will not vote for Johnson, and if others follow suit the process could echo the multiple rounds of voting that former Speaker Kevin McCarthy had to endure.\n\nThe billionaires have made their demands known and some of the Republican Party’s most prominent figures are giving them what they want—even if working-class Americans have to suffer the consequences.\n\nWe're right in the thick of the holiday season, and we're all tired after a long election in which we gave 110%, but this is important: Daily Kos is falling short of our final goal of the year and time is running out.

The act also provides immunity from liability to healthcare providers, nurses, pharmacists, pharmacy interns, and pharmacy technicians who administered the COVID-19 vaccines. \n\nXavier Beccera, the secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS), signed the 12th amendment to the declaration under the PREP Act for COVID-19 Medical Countermeasures, claiming the move was necessary because of a still substantial “credible risk” the pandemic spirals out of control in the next four years— or while President-elect Donald Trump is in office. \n\nAccording to the Federal Registrar Notice: \n\nI am now amending section XII of the Declaration to extend the time period of PREP Act coverage through December 31, 2029. COVID-19 continues to present a credible risk of a future public health emergency. COVID-19 continues to cause significant serious illness, morbidity, and mortality during outbreaks. The risk of domestic cases is high due to ongoing outbreaks that continue domestically and internationally in the year since the PHE for COVID-19 ended.Development of and stockpiling vaccines, therapeutics, devices, and diagnostics for COVID-19 continues to be needed for U.S. preparedness against the credible threat of a public health emergency due to outbreaks of COVID-19. Continued coverage under the PREP Act, as provided in this Declaration, is intended to prepare for and mitigate the credible risk presented by COVID-19. \n\nThe PREP Act, enacted in 2020, was initially intended to encourage vaccine manufacturers to speed up their research on COVID-19 vaccines without fear of being legally held responsible for side effects. The Biden Administration defended the sudden move, saying the extension would be a precaution for “future public health emergencies.” \n\nMichael Hogue, CEO of the American Pharmacists Association, said the extension would “continue saving lives and lower healthcare costs, particularly in rural and underserved areas where the local pharmacy may be the only healthcare provider for miles.” \n\nPer CDC data, about one in every 200,000 cases, a person will have an allergic reaction or suffer from heart problems, such as myocarditis or pericarditis, in response to a COVID-19 vaccine. The Daily Mail noted that there have been about 13,000 claims that the Covid vaccine or other related treatments have caused injury, with 10,000 of those awaiting review. This means that since 2020, only 3,000 of those claims have been reviewed.","url":"https://townhall.com/tipsheet/saraharnold/2024/12/18/biden-quietly-extends-covid-emergency-declaration-to-protect-big-pharma-from-liability-until-2029-n2649259","image":"https://media.townhall.com/cdn/hodl/2018/212/07134811-173b-40fd-9f2a-db3bf819c748.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-12-19 00:54:22","author":"Sarah Arnold","authors":["Sarah Arnold"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.544},{"id":274386094,"title":"Heraldsun.com.au","text":"A NOTE ABOUT RELEVANT ADVERTISING: We collect information about the content (including ads) you use across this site and use it to make both advertising and content more relevant to you on our network and other sites.

Hayes wrote in his diary, “This is a government of the people, by the people, and for the people no longer. It is a government of corporations, by corporations, and for corporations.” Hayes offered this private admission at the peak of the Gilded Age, when, as the historian Richard White put it, “corruption suffused government and the economy.” Businessmen amassed fortunes never seen before in American history and demanded government officials aid them in expanding those fortunes further. If there was any doubt that we are in a new Gilded Age, Speaker Mike Johnson’s admission to Fox News Wednesday obliterated it. Johnson appeared on “Fox and Friends” the morning after congressional leaders released the full text of a deal to keep the federal government running through mid-March. As my colleague Hayes Brown explained Tuesday, Congress needs to pass a funding bill this week to avoid “a decidedly unmerry shutdown.” On the one hand, most House Republicans don’t want to vote for a bill that Senate Democrats and President Joe Biden will accept. But they also don’t want to be blamed for a government shutdown. To square this circle, Johnson planned to count on Democratic votes to expedite the bill’s passage with a two-thirds majority, so much of his caucus can oppose the deal without consequence. After playing a compilation of GOP representatives complaining about the bill, “Fox and Friends” co-host Steve Doocy asked Speaker Johnson about Elon Musk’s post a few hours prior that “this bill should not pass.” “If you could,” Doocy asked, “what’s your message to Elon Musk?” “I was communicating with Elon last night,” Johnson revealed. “Elon, Vivek [Ramaswamy] and I were on a text chain together, and I was explaining to them the background of this.” In other words, with the federal government days from a partial shutdown, the person second in the line of presidential succession is spending his time tending to the egos of two rich businessmen. Johnson was not even consulting Musk and Ramaswamy on areas where they might have expertise. He was explaining to these men very basic facts about how the House of Representative works. “Remember, guys, we still have just a razor-thin margin of Republicans,” Johnson says he told the two men. “So any bill has to have Democrat votes.” The speaker’s attempts at reassurance were unsuccessful. Like Musk, Ramaswamy has maintained his opposition despite Johnson’s efforts. Nor, it seems, was Musk paying attention to the lesson in congressional basics: He wrote on X that any congressperson or senator “who votes for this outrageous spending bill deserves to be voted out in 2 years!” Never mind that only one-third of the Senate is up for re-election in 2026. The problem here goes far deeper than the rich mistaking wealth for expertise — any sports fan, for example, can name a dozen team owners who demonstrate that failing to the world every year. These two men, though, have been granted an advisory commission on government spending. Musk and Ramaswamy want to cut trillions from the federal budget — reductions as vast as their grasp on governance is tenuous. And that’s before you include Musk’s web of conflicts of interest with various government regulators. In a vacuum, their posts would be harmless, but their influence makes them disastrous. Late Wednesday, Musk’s influence was affirmed when President-elect Donald Trump and Vice President-elect JD Vance released a statement echoing him. They lambasted congressional Republicans for “allowing our country to hit the debt ceiling in 2025” and calling for “a streamlined spending bill” that increases the debt ceiling but “doesn’t give Chuck Schumer and the Democrats everything they want,” such as “sweetheart provisions for government censors and for Liz Cheney.” Will Musk and Ramaswamy be the architects of this “streamlined” bill? For decades, the influence of money in politics has grown alongside the country’s increasing income inequality. Those who warned about this growing influence have been thoroughly vindicated. This year, Trump’s campaign was fueled by roughly $800 million from seven billionaire families. His administration will include more than a dozen billionaires, the wealthiest since President Warren Harding’s corrupt White House. To end the first Gilded Age, Hayes realized, massive reforms were needed. “The real difficulty is with the vast wealth and power in the hands of the few and the unscrupulous who represent or control capital,” he wrote. “Hundreds of laws of Congress and the state legislatures are in the interest of these men and against the interests of workingmen. These need to be exposed and repealed. All laws on corporations, on taxation, on trusts, wills, descent, and the like, need examination and extensive change.” Ending the second Gilded Age will require the same sort of sweeping remedies.","summary":"House Speaker Mike Johnson, in the midst of working on a government funding bill, revealed he was in a group text with Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy.","url":"https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/elon-musk-mike-johnson-fox-news-government-shutdown-rcna184731","image":"https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-1500w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2024-12/241218-elon-musk-mike-johnson-mn-1515-18eabc.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-12-19 00:51:38","author":"James Downie","authors":["James Downie"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.053},{"id":274385170,"title":"8 Key Facts About Trump’s First Caribbean Ambassador Nominee","text":"News Americas, New York, NY, December 18, 2024: Former President Donald Trump has nominated Leah Campos Schandlbauer, a former CIA operations officer and seasoned foreign affairs expert, as the U.S. Ambassador to the Dominican Republic. If confirmed, Campos will be Trump’s first ambassadorial pick for the Caribbean region, bringing extensive national security and policy experience to the role. \n\nHere’s what you should know about Campos:\n\nDistinguished CIA Career: Campos Schandlbauer is a former CIA operations officer with over 10 years of experience. \n\nForeign Affairs Expertise: Campos previously served as a senior advisor for the Western Hemisphere on the U.S. House Foreign Affairs Committee, focusing on Latin America.\n\nEducational Background: She holds degrees from the University of Pittsburgh (1997) and Arizona State University, reflecting her strong academic foundation.\n\nCongressional Candidate: In 2012, she ran for Congress as a Republican in Arizona’s 9th Congressional District, emphasizing border security in her campaign. During her congressional run, she like Trump, made the border a central theme, stating in 2012: “The federal government needs to do its job and secure our border with Mexico, just as Mexico robustly secures its own southern border. Mexico is undergoing a bitter, violent and widespread assault at the hands of vicious drug cartels, which threatens to completely destabilize the Mexican nation. Anyone who asserts that this has not had a huge impact on Arizona is simply not telling the truth. “\n\nFamily Connections: Campos’ sister, Rachel Campos-Duffy, is a Fox News contributor, and her brother-in-law, Sean Duffy, was named Secretary of Transportation by Trump. “Her sister, the outstanding Rachel Campos-Duffy, of FoxNews, and brother-in-law Sean Duffy, who will be Secretary of Transportation, are also wonderful Patriots. Leah will take her love of Country, and commitment to our National Security and Prosperity, to her post as U.S. Ambassador to the Dominican Republic,” Trump said in a post to Truth Social.\n\nPrivate Sector Role: Since 2019, she has worked as Senior Strategic Adviser for SAS Institute, focusing on Latin America, Southern Europe, and other regions.\n\nDevout Faith: A lifelong Catholic, she credits her mother, a catechist, with shaping her strong religious values.\n\nPersonal Life: She resides in Arizona with her husband, Alfred Schandlbauer, and their four children: Christian, Isabela, Soledad, and Xavier.","url":"https://grenadachronicle.com/8-key-facts-about-trumps-first-caribbean-ambassador-nominee/","image":"https://grenadachronicle.com/app/uploads/2024/12/cmex-2024-honors-thea-lafond-z6o3WT.jpeg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-12-19 00:51:22","author":"Keith Mitchell","authors":["Keith Mitchell"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gd","sentiment":0.972},{"id":274384516,"title":"Trump&#8217;s reciprocal tariff plan to open talks for market access","text":"As US president-elect Donald Trump on Wednesday asserted that the world's largest economy would charge taxes (import tariffs) on India on a strictly reciprocal basis, experts here said the move would force open negotiations for greater market access between the two countries. While Trump talked of reciprocity, product-to- product parity on tariffs is not possible because items of export for both countries are not the same as imports, they pointed out. One form the US action could take was matching the tariffs that India imposes on some US products with a similar burden on some other products that India sells to the US. Also Read‘If they tax us, we tax them the same amount’: President-elect Donald trump slams ‘high tariffs’ by India Trump’s comments that India imposes tariffs of 100% are also misleading, they noted. Only in some select products like automobiles and wines and spirits that the tariffs reach that level. Even the US has over 100% tariffs. The outgoing Biden administration has imposed 100% tax on Chinese electric vehicles. “India’s average tariff stands at 17%, significantly higher than the US’s 3.3%, but comparable to countries like South Korea (13.4%) and China (7.5%),” an analysis by Global Trade Research Initiative (GTRI) said. While the incoming US President singles out countries for warnings on tariffs, the World Trade Organisation’s (WTO) rules do not allow for country-specific import duties. Behind the talk on tariffs the intent of the US will be to seek greater market access for products of interest to them, director general and chief executive officer of Federation of Indian Export Organisations (FIEO) Ajay Sahai said. “India has to be ready for negotiations on some products of interest to the US.” The US is not a big exporter of manufactured products to India. Within manufacturing the largest imports by India are of aircraft parts. US biggest exports to India are crude oil, coal, natural gas and diamonds. The areas where the US might seek more openness is in agriculture products. “The US is the world’s largest agricultural products exporter. Barring rice it has surplus which it might want to sell to India like wheat, maize, groundnuts, soya, poultry and some other products,” trade expert, acting president and Distinguished Professor, Council for Social Development Biswajit Dhar. He said there is speculation that the US might increase its crude oil production which it might be keen to sell to India. Crude oil is already the biggest item of import from the US. Last financial year it stood at $ 5 billion down from $ 10 billion in 2022-23. Concessions in agriculture could hit at the very base of our agriculture self sufficiency as the US gives very high subsidies to capture export markets, Dhar said. Retaliation on tariffs by the US could come in areas of manufacturing like electric vehicles, semiconductors where it is trying to build local capacity, Sahai said. In the past three years, smartphone manufacturers in India by Apple have emerged as one of the biggest exports to the US. Experts do not expect duties there as the phone assembly is not a focus area of the US administration to revitalise manufacturing. “Even though Trump's claims about Indian tariffs may be overstated, India can seize this moment to strategically review its tariff structure. A targeted reduction in tariffs could be advantageous for India, aligning with its goal of boosting low-cost, value-added manufacturing and trade,” GTRI’s founder Ajay Srivastava said. “With 85% of tariff revenue generated by fewer than 10% of tariff lines, and 60% of lines contributing under 3% to revenue, India could lower its average tariff to around 10% without major revenue losses,” he added. Also ReadIndian firms turn to euro, yen swaps to trim borrowing cost If the Trump administration gets aggressive on tariffs India has an option to retaliate as it did earlier in 2018, Srivastava said. In 2018, when the US imposed tariffs on Indian steel and aluminum, India retaliated by increasing tariffs on 29 specific American products. This well-calibrated response ensured that India collected equivalent revenue from US imports. This dispute that was also fought in WTO also was laid to rest along with six others after bilateral consultations in 2023.“At this point we need to be aware of the threat Trump’s moves can pose to the US and prepare ourselves to counter it. Given the relations between the two leaders )Trump and Prime Minister Narendra Modi) there is a possibility of better engagement,” Dhar added.","url":"https://www.financialexpress.com/policy/economy-trumps-reciprocal-tariff-plan-to-open-talks-for-market-access-3694855/","image":"https://www.financialexpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/trumpmodi.reuters.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-12-19 00:48:23","author":"Mukesh Jagota","authors":["Mukesh Jagota"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"in","sentiment":-0.042},{"id":274384086,"title":"LILLEY: Trudeau AWOL as Donald Trump throws his weight around","text":"A lot of what Trump is putting out there is bluster, especially all the material about Canada being the 51st state.

[+] seminal season film 'Home Alone.'\n20th Century Studios/Disney\n\nAh, Christmas. It's the time when families either gather or avoid each other, but we all agree on one thing: movies fit in there somewhere. Some start immersing themselves in the reason for the cinematic season the day after Halloween, others at Thanksgiving, and the rest as soon as the calendar tips into December. Still, as sure as Rudolph's nose is red, we all meet up in front of a screen with a warm glow and ridiculous grin that we're shoveling festive snacks into and binge Christmas movies.\n\nWhile Hollywood continues to provide audiences with festive films, not all of them make the top of the box office nice list, or some are streaming exclusives, so sadly, there is no place at the potluck for the highly recommended Netflix's Klaus, Krampus, Bad Santa, Violent Night, Jingle All the Way or Scrooged. Even The Nightmare Before Christmas, National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation, and The Muppet Christmas Carol fail to crack the top ten.\n\nRegardless, here's the list of the top ten highest-grossing Christmas movies of all time. No, before you ask, we're not including Die Hard. Yes, I believe it's a Christmas movie, but I don't make the rules.\n\nThese Are The 10 Highest-Grossing Christmas Movies Of All Time\n\nAt number ten, we have The Santa Clause. Released in theaters in 1994, it grossed $190.5 million worldwide and $145.5 million domestically. The Tim Allen comedy spawned a lucrative film franchise and a TV show. Additionally, The Santa Clause reunited Allen with fellow Home Improvement alum director John Pasquin. Now a festive favorite and something of a calling card for Allen, along with the Toy Story movies, he wasn't the first choice for the role. Bill Murray and Chevy Chase were reportedly offered the part, but both turned it down.\n\n2006's The Holiday lands at number nine. This was not a domestic hit, grossing only $63.2 million domestic, but it pulled in $205.8 million at the worldwide box office against an $85 million budget. The romantic home-swapping comedy starring Cameron Diaz, Kate Winslet, Jude Law, and Jack Black has become a classic since its release, but critics were lukewarm when it was released. Directed by Nancy Meyers, who also made The Parent Trap, Father of the Bride, and The Intern, also got her friend, legendary actor Dustin Hoffman, to make an uncredited cameo in the video rental store scene, which features a nod to his film, The Graduate.\n\nMORE FOR YOU\n\nThe Fed’s ‘Biggest Nightmare’ Is Suddenly Coming True As Bitcoin Price Surges\n\nElon Musk Xmail Teaser Poses New Threat For Billions Of Gmail Users\n\nMystery Drones Saga: Rand Paul Blocks Expedited Drone Bill (Updated)\n\n'Elf' Makes The List Of The Highest-Grossing Christmas Movies\n\nEighth place goes to Elf. This 2003 seasonal comedy grossed $227.3 million worldwide and $178 million at the domestic box office and is hailed as a modern classic. In one of his most iconic roles, Will Ferrell plays Buddy Hobbs, an eccentric human raised by Santa's Christmas elves, who heads to New York City to meet his biological father, played by James Caan. The cast also includes Zooey Deschanel, Mary Steenburgen, Ed Asner, Bob Newhart, Faizon Love, and Peter Dinklage. Written a decade earlier, Chris Farley and Jim Carrey were originally candidates to play Buddy, but SNL alum Ferrell eventually won the role. And that classic scene in Elf where Buddy screams out \"Santa!\" was totally improvised.\n\nReleased the same year as Elf, Love Actually occupies the seventh spot in the top ten with a worldwide gross of $248 million worldwide. Only $59.6 million of that was earned at domestic movie theaters. Hugh Grant, Liam Neeson, Colin Firth, Laura Linney, Emma Thompson, Alan Rickman, Keira Knightley, Andrew Lincoln, Chiwetel Ejiofor, Martine McCutcheon, Bill Nighy and Rowan Atkinson, to name just a few, all have key roles in these ten interlinked stories of love. Aside from being a great romantic dramedy, Love Actually is also notable for an early appearance by Gavin and Stacey's Joanna Page.\n\n'The Polar Express' Boards The List Of Highest -Grossing Christmas Movies\n\nDirector Robert Zemekis' animated Christmas fantasy adventure The Polar Express is arriving in sixth place. The groundbreaking 2004 film from the Here director uses actors to play multiple human characters using live action and motion capture effects. Set on Christmas Eve, it tells the story of a young boy who sees a mysterious train bound for the North Pole stop outside his window, and he is invited aboard by its Conductor, played by Tom Hanks, who also voices the boy's father, the Conductor, an unhoused man, Santa and more. Yeah, it's creepy, and it looks a bit dated now, but the box office doesn't lie, and it grossed $316.8 million worldwide.\n\nAnother of the Death Becomes Her, Who Framed Roger Rabbit, Contact, Forrest Gump, and Back to the Future director's motion capture movies lands at number five. A Christmas Carol grossed $325.2 million worldwide, with $137.8 million of that from domestic audiences. Critics didn't love it, but audiences turned out in their droves. Released in theaters in 3D in 2009, A Christmas Carol was Disney's third film retelling of the classic story following 1983's Mickey's Christmas Carol and 1992's The Muppet Christmas Carol. As Tom Hanks had done in The Polar Express, Jim Carrey voiced multiple characters, including Ebenezer Scrooge.\n\n'The Grinch' Steals Fourth Place On The Highest-Grossing Christmas Movies List\n\nJim Carrey makes his second and final appearance in the top ten thanks to Dr. Seuss' How the Grinch Stole Christmas! Director Ron Howard's Christmas fantasy, based on the Dr. Seuss character and 1957 story of the same name, celebrates its 25th anniversary in 2025. The film, which starred Carrey in the titular lead, was released just before Thanksgiving and spent four weeks at the top of the domestic box office despite critics giving it a poor reception. However, it grossed $345.8 million worldwide including $260.7 million in the US, and it has even found new life as the annual Grinchmas event at the Universal Studios theme parks in Hollywood and Orlando.\n\nNow considered to be a classic and, by some, even better than the original film, 1992's Home Alone 2: Lost in New York takes third place. At the time, critics gave it a negative response, and it didn't pull in the crowds at the same level as the original. However, thanks to various reasons, including a Donald Trump cameo and the annual meme suggesting incorrectly that British media personality Piers Morgan plays the Central Park Pigeon Lady, this sequel's popularity and pop culture influence grows year after year. The jape sees Macaulay Culkin reprise his role as Kevin McCallister as he fends off Wet/Sticky Bandits Joe Pesci and Daniel Stern in the Big Apple. Notable cast editions include the legendary Tim Curry as Plaza Hotel concierge, Mr. Hector. Home Alone 2: Lost in New York grossed $358.9 million worldwide.\n\nWith a worldwide box office tally of $476.6 million worldwide, $285.7 million of which was shelled out in domestic theaters, 1990's Home Alone takes second place. It held the top spot until 2018, but more on that soon. Home Alone was actually so popular with audiences that it stayed in theaters well past the Christmas season and was the number one film at the box office for 12 straight weeks - from its release on November 16, 1990, through the weekend of February 1, 1991. The role also made Macaulay Culkin an international star and household name overnight. Keep the change, you filthy animal.\n\nThis Animated Hit Is The Highest-Grossing Christmas Movie Of All Time\n\nThe film that dethroned Home Alone and takes the top spot is Dr. Seuss' The Grinch. Grossing $526.7 million worldwide, and $271.3 million domestically, the animated comedy featuring the voice of Benedict Cumberbatch as the titular iconic festive party pooper is not only the highest-grossing Christmas film of all time but also the highest-grossing Dr. Seuss film adaptation. From the same studio as the Minions and Despicable Me movies, the original plan was for Cumberbatch to use his natural British accent. However, he wasn't down with that, and he was made American to match the rest of the cast. Audiences loved it and handed over their money in a big way, which is why it tops the list of the ten highest-grossing Christmas movies ever.\n\nFollow me on Twitter or LinkedIn.

I remember Hunter as a bright, confident teenager with a magnetic personality and a hot streak. Like the Bidens, my family has also grappled with the devastating toll of addiction. Many years later, my own brother, Sam Spitz, may he rest in peace, succumbed to his struggles during the COVID pandemic.\n\nThe presidential pardon is enshrined in Article II, Section 2, Clause 1 of the U.S. Constitution, empowering the president with the authority to \u001cgrant Reprieves and Pardons for Offenses against the United States, except in Cases of Impeachment.\u001d This provision, rooted in the English concept of \u001cprerogative of mercy,\u001d was designed to offer a mechanism to temper justice with mercy, allowing for the correction of judicial errors and the mitigation of undue harshness in the legal system.\n\nCritics of President Biden\u0019s pardon of his son Hunter argue that he placed family loyalty above the impartiality of the law, and that it sullies Biden\u0019s campaign promise to restore dignity to the presidency.\n\nHunter Biden\u0019s troubles are no secret. He wrote a tell-all book describing the years and dollars he spent on cocaine and prostitutes. He committed crimes that were blown out of proportion by public scrutiny and partisan posturing, culminating in convictions for tax evasion and illegal firearm possession. Others in similar circumstances might have avoided prosecution altogether, as Joe Biden pointed out in his statement on the pardon. \u001cHunter,\u001d he said, \u001cwas selectively and unfairly prosecuted.\u001d\n\nJoe Biden found himself in a place where any decision he made regarding his son would have generated a fierce backlash. Biden campaigned for office in 2020 on the vow of restoring dignity to the office of the presidency \u0013 contrasting himself directly with the self-serving machinations of Donald Trump and his family. Did pardoning his own son \u0013 whose sins included influence-peddling schemes that seemingly implicated several members of the Biden family (including the president) \u0013 undermine that pledge? Biden\u0019s critics, many of them Democrats, certainly thought so.\n\nBut the president would have also faced disdain if he had allowed his son to face prison. We live, for better or worse, in a transactional society where every act is judged by its gains or costs to the actor. And thus, refusing to grant it would have rendered Biden seem a chump to many Americans \u0013 a father unwilling or unable to protect his own family from a justice system he deemed unfair.\n\nAlexander Hamilton, in Federalist No. 74, argued that the pardon is essential because it allows a leader to temper the rigidity of the law with mercy, especially in \u001ccritical moments\u001d when compassion serves the public good. Hunter\u0019s case may not have national significance, but for Biden, the father, it was a critical moment that tested his humanity.\n\nRecent precedent exists for presidents extending clemency to their inner circle. Bill Clinton pardoned his half-brother, Roger Clinton, for a 1985 cocaine distribution conviction. In 2020, Donald Trump pardoned his daughter Ivanka\u0019s father-in-law Charles Kushner, a prominent real estate developer, who\u0019d been convicted in 2005 of tax evasion, illegal campaign contributions, and witness tampering.\n\nKushner hired a prostitute to seduce his brother-in-law, recorded the encounter, and sent the tape to his own sister in an attempt to intimidate the witness. This led then-U.S. Attorney Chris Christie, who prosecuted the case, to describe it as \u001cone of the most loathsome, disgusting crimes\u001d he\u0019d ever encountered. In November 2024, President-elect Trump announced his intention to nominate Charles Kushner as the U.S. Ambassador to France.\n\nHunter Biden\u0019s struggles are not just his own; they belong to a family that has endured unspeakable tragedy and untimely deaths. As someone who has lost relatives to suicide and a brother to addiction, I empathize with the Bidens\u0019 pain. Addiction devastates families, leaving behind a trail of grief, regret, and what-ifs. In this light, Joe Biden\u0019s act of clemency is not just an exercise of power but an entirely understandable attempt to save his son and his family from further suffering.\n\nCritics argue that this decision undermines faith in the justice system and sets a dangerous precedent. But pardons have always toed the line between justice and mercy, law and compassion. Abraham Lincoln, our country\u0019s greatest president, once confided in an old friend, saying, \u001cI have always found that mercy bears richer fruits than strict justice.\u001d And Lincoln was weighing the fate of Union Army deserters.\n\nPresident Biden\u0019s pardon may not be as high-minded, and it certainly did not resonate with everyone, but it shows that even the most powerful among us are not immune to the heartbreak of addiction and the complexities of familial love.\n\nHunter\u0019s case also speaks to the broader societal challenges surrounding addiction and recovery. His prosecution highlights an anomalous modern inequity \u0013 public figures become stand-ins, and sometimes scapegoats, for larger societal issues. By pardoning his son, Joe Biden implicitly acknowledged the need for a more compassionate approach to addiction, one that prioritizes rehabilitation over punishment.\n\nIn the end, this pardon is less about politics and more about the enduring human bonds of family. In a transactional world, where power often outweighs principles, President Biden\u0019s decision reflects a rare moment of vulnerability and authenticity. To lose a child to addiction is every parent\u0019s nightmare; to save one, even at great personal and political cost, is an act of profound love.\n\nAs we debate the merits of this decision and future pardons to come, let us remember that the pardon power, at its best, is a tool for healing, reconciliation, and compassion. President Biden\u0019s pardon of his son Hunter reminds us that even in the highest offices of power, humanity and family still matter most.","url":"https://www.realclearpolitics.com/articles/2024/12/18/hunters_pardon_152102.html","image":"https://www.realclearpolitics.com/asset/img/social_media_assets/site_logos/rcp.png","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-12-19 00:36:22","author":"Eric Spitz","authors":["Eric Spitz"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.053},{"id":274383118,"title":"Canadian Opposition Leader Poilievre: Government Must Work For The People, Not The Ego Of One Man","text":"Back to Videos\n\n Canadian Opposition Leader Poilievre: Government Must Work For The People, Not The Ego Of One Man\n\n | \n\n Posted By Tim Hains\n On Date December 18, 2024\n \n\nCanadian Conservative Opposition Leader Pierre Poilievre delivered this heartfelt speech about the suffering of average Canadians trying to make ends meet. Poilievre appears likely to take power as Justin Trudeau's government teeters in the wake of the Prime Minister's \"embarrassing\" meeting with Donald Trump. \n\nPIERRE POILIEVRE: When I travel across this country, I consistently meet two types of people. One, those who are a little better off and tell me\u0014and I'll be very blunt about this\u0014that if I don't win, they will leave the country. And they are very numerous. But, you know, I don't worry about them as much. You know who I worry about? The ones who can't leave. The ones who don't know\u0014and if I can just use very blunt language\u0014who tell me, \"I don't know what the hell I'm going to do. I have no idea how I'm going to pay my way.\"\n\nI met a waitress at a restaurant not long ago, and she came up to me and grabbed me by the hand. She said, \"You have to win.\" And I said, \"Oh, thank you. I appreciate your support.\" She said, \"No, no, it wasn't a compliment. You have to win.\" Then she told me her story.\n\nShe told me that she was working one full-time job and two part-time jobs just to pay her bills. A single woman in her late 50s, she was tired of working all the time. So she cut everything out of her budget\u0014every creature comfort, everything she enjoyed about her life\u0014so that she could drop one of those part-time jobs. Then, one morning, she woke up and walked outside, and her car was gone. She called her insurance, and they said they weren't going to cover the replacement value. So she had to take that job back because she simply cannot live her life without a car.\n\nNow, you can bet your bottom dollar the guy who stole the car was probably out on bail. This was not his first job. That's right. Her taxes have gone up, her heating bill has gone up, her wages have not gone up. She's scared to go out in the streets in places where they didn\u0019t even lock the door not long ago.\n\nThese are the people we're fighting for. These silly games over here\u0014they\u0019re very entertaining, the soap opera that everyone\u0019s seized with today\u0014that's all fine. But there are real people whose lives are on the line here, and we have a duty to work for them.\n\nQuite frankly, this woman doesn\u0019t see me or any of us as any kind of savior. She sees us all as a last hope. In fact, she doesn\u0019t want to be saved\u0014she just wants her life back. Exactly. She was taking care of herself just fine until her taxes, her heat, her grocery bill went through the roof, and her car went missing. She was doing just fine. She was doing everything right.\n\nI met another guy at the Lebrat Brewery a few days ago\u0014you can watch the video of me talking with him. He walked up to me and said, \"I have three jobs, and I can't make it. We're renting. We have no hope. We've given up on ever owning a home. We're renting, and we can barely make it.\"\n\nHe said to me, \"I feel ashamed when I talk to my kids because they ask me why I'm never around and why we can never have a house. I feel like a failure.\" But he didn\u0019t fail. He has been failed.\n\nThat's right. He has been robbed of the promise of Canada. It was a very simple promise: that if you worked hard, you got a good life. Now, it wasn\u0019t fancy or extravagant, but you got a house with a yard where you could have kids playing safely. You could have a nice dog that you could afford to feed, along with the kids, and your kids could play safely in the streets.\n\nThat was the promise. Now, politicians break promises all the time. But you know what was bad about this promise? This promise didn\u0019t belong to this prime minister. It wasn\u0019t his promise to break. It belonged to all of us.\n\nOur purpose is to bring home that promise for that young man, that young father, and that older female worker, so they can once again take back control of their lives. Live in a safe country where their hard work earns them a good wage, where the rent and their food are affordable, and where, when they go to bed at night, they know they will be safe throughout their sleep and that they will have their car in their driveway in the morning.\n\nA country where people are proud again to fly the flag, where they know the government is a servant and not a master. Right. Where they understand that, every day, the Commons\u0014this place\u0014works for the common people, not for the ego of one man desperate to cling on to his job.\n\nWe must remember that we are servants in this place. We have a job to do on behalf of the people who sent us here. Our personal dramas are not important. The dramas that should seize all of our concern and imagination are the daily dramas of the working women and men who build this country.\n\nWe are in it for them. We're going to give them back control of their lives in the freest country on Earth: Canada. Let's bring it home.\n\nRelated Topics: Canada's Government, Canada-U.S. Relations, Pierre Poilievre, Canada\n\n Show comments\n Hide Comments","url":"https://www.realclearpolitics.com/video/2024/12/18/canadian_opposition_leader_poilievre_government_must_work_for_the_people_not_the_ego_of_one_man.html","image":"https://assets.realclear.com/images/67/672945_5_.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-12-19 00:36:22","author":"Tim Hains","authors":["Tim Hains"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.195},{"id":274383114,"title":"Pod Save America's Favreau: Trump Not Being President Yet Is A Fact Easier and Easier To Forget As Biden Disappears","text":"Back to Videos\n\n Pod Save America's Favreau: Trump Not Being President Yet Is A Fact Easier and Easier To Forget As Biden Disappears\n\n | \n\n Posted By Ian Schwartz\n On Date December 18, 2024\n \n\nPOD SAVE AMERICA: Joe Biden cedes the spotlight to Donald Trump, who's rolling like he's already taken office: meeting with world leaders, attending the annual Army-Navy game, and calmly announcing the next targets in his legal offensive against the media. \n\nJON FAVREAU, CO-HOST, FORMER OBAMA SPEECHWRITER: So the purpose of Trump's appearance at Mar-a-Lago Monday morning was to announce a hundred billion dollar investment from SoftBank, the hugely influential Japanese bank in American AI projects. What an American story. It was more or less a standard presidential policy announcement.\n\nThe main difference being Trump isn't president yet. A fact that's getting easier and easier to forget as Joe Biden seems to be disappearing from the public stage as his term comes to an end. Over the weekend, Trump took his new bro squad to watch the Army-Navy game at the Commander's Stadium just outside D.C., an event that the president sometimes attends and Biden has attended himself in the past. No sign of him this year, though he did apparently appear at the DNC holiday party. The White House put out a memo on Sunday hinting that in the coming weeks, Biden will be announcing more pardons or commutations, doing more to protect federal land and trying to forgive more student debt, rein in AI and award more CHIPS Act and IRA money.\n\nBrainberries6 Amazing Shows From The 90s That Need A Reboot Right Now\n\n Recommended\n\n \n\n Gingrich: Trump Is Already Having A Direct Impact, I Don't Remember A Transition That Was Quite This Decisive\n\n December 17, 2024\n\n FOX News contributor Newt Gingrich praised President-elect Donald Trump's transition and said he is already directly impacting culture and society.\n\nHANNITY: I don't think anyone really cares what Joe and Kamala have to say anymore, except I did laugh when she started giggling again.

It leaves Johnson scrambling to engineer a new plan before Friday’s deadline to keep government open.\n\n“Republicans must GET SMART and TOUGH,” Trump and Vice President-elect JD Vance said in a statement.\n\nThe president-elect made an almost unrealistic proposal that combined some continuation of government funds along with a much more controversial provision to raise the nation’s debt limit — something his own party routinely rejects. “Anything else is a betrayal of our country,” they wrote.\n\nDemocrats decried the GOP revolt over the stopgap measure, which would have also provided some $100.4 billion in disaster aid to states hammered by Hurricanes Helene and Milton and other natural disasters.\n\n“House Republicans have been ordered to shut down the government and hurt everyday Americans all across this country,” said House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries.\n\nJeffries said “an agreement is an agreement,” and by backing out of it “the House Republicans “will now own any harm that is visited upon the American people.”\n\nAlready, the massive 1,500-page bill was on the verge of collapse, as hard right conservatives rejected the increased spending, egged on by Trump’s billionaire ally Elon Musk who rejected the plan almost as soon as it was released late Tuesday night.\n\nRank-and-file lawmakers complained about the extras, which included their first pay-raises in more than a decade — a shock after one of the most unproductive chaotic sessions in modern times.\n\nEven the addition of much-needed disaster aid, some $100.4 billion in the aftermath of hurricanes and other natural calamities that ravaged states this year, plus $10 billion in economic assistance for farmers failed to win over the budget-slashing GOP.\n\nA number of Republicans were waiting for Trump to signal whether they should vote yes or no.\n\n“This should not pass,” Musk posted on his social media site X in the wee hours of Wednesday morning.\n\nOne lawmaker said office phone lines were flooded with calls from constituents\n\n“My phone was ringing off the hook,” said Rep. Andy Barr, R-Ky. “The people who elected us are listening to Elon Musk.”\n\nThe outcome comes as no surprise for Johnson, who like other Republican House speakers before him, has been unable to convince his majority to go along with the routine needs of federal government operations, which they would prefer to slash.\n\nIt all shows just how hard it will be for Republicans next year, as they seize control of the House, Senate and White House, to unify and lead the nation. And it underscores how much Johnson and the GOP leaders must depend on Trump’s blessing to see any legislative package over the finish line.\n\nMusk, who is heading Trump’s new Department of Government Efficiency, warned that “Any member of the House or Senate who votes for this outrageous spending bill deserves to be voted out in 2 years!”\n\nIt’s not an idle threat coming from Musk, the world’s richest man, who helped bankroll Trump’s victory and can easily use his America PAC to make or break political careers.\n\nDemocratic Rep. Jamie Raskin of Maryland said this is the problem with “an oligarchy a handful of wealthy people run everything and everyone is supposed to live in fear of them.”\n\nDemocrats, who negotiated the final product with Johnson and Senate GOP leadership, will be expected to provide enough support to help ensure passage, as is often the case on big, bipartisan bills.\n\nHowever, Trump’s new demands on the debt limit pose a daunting test for Johnson, who has worked hard to stay close to the president-elect, only to have him turn against his hard-fought plan.\n\nTrump posted later that he was insisting on the debt ceiling: “I will fight ‘till the end.”\n\nThe nation’s debt limit expires 2025 and Trump appears to want the issue off the table before he returns to the White House, a reasonable idea but one that typically takes months to negotiate.\n\nThe last House speaker, Kevin McCarthy, worked for months with President Joe Biden to raise the debt limit. Even though they struck a bipartisan deal that cut spending in exchange for additional borrowing capacity, House Republicans said it didn’t go far enough, and it ended up costing McCarthy his job.\n\nNow, Trump is looking for Johnson to pass a debt ceiling extension some 48 hours before a partial government shutdown.\n\nMeanwhile, the bipartisan package that Trump rejected extended existing government programs and services at their current operating levels for a few more months, through March 14, 2025.\n\nThe stopgap measure is needed because Congress has failed to pass its annual appropriations bills to fund all the various agencies in the federal government, from the Pentagon and national security apparats, to the health, welfare, transportation and other routine domestic services.\n\nBut the inches-thick bill goes beyond routine funding and tacks on several other measures.\n\nRep. Anna Paulina Luna, R-Fla., called it essentially a junk sandwich, using a swear word.\n\nAnd then there’s the pay raise.\n\nThe bill would have turned off a pay-freeze provision and that could allow a maximum adjustment of 3.8% or $6,600 in 2025, bringing lawmakers’ annual pay to $180,600, according to a Congressional Research Service report. Members of Congress last got a raise in 2009.\n\nAmong other provisions, there’s full federal funding to rebuild Baltimore’s Francis Scott Key Bridge, which collapsed when struck by a cargo ship that reported losing power just before the crash. Federal taxpayers will be reimbursed through proceeds from insurance payments and litigation.\n\nAnd there’s a provision to transfer the land that is the site of the old RFK Stadium from the federal government to the District of Columbia, which could potentially lead to a new stadium for the Washington Commanders.\n\nOn the health care front, the legislation seeks to extend coverage of telehealth appointments for Medicare enrollees and rein in how much money pharmacy benefits managers — the companies that negotiate how and what drugs are covered by insurance plans — make off those deals.\n\nThe bill also includes provisions focused on countering China, including expanding on Biden’s executive order that seeks to restrict investments into countries that pose a national security threat to the United States. Blocking China’s high-tech ambitions is one of the few issues that enjoys broad support in Washington from both Republicans and Democrats.","summary":"Elon Musk publicly came out against the plan.","url":"https://www.syracuse.com/politics/2024/12/government-funding-plan-collapses-after-trump-abruptly-rejects-deal-days-before-shutdown.html","image":"https://www.syracuse.com/resizer/v2/WLRRTFGW4RBSLP3UOXLOC6GD5U.jpg?auth=e41ddf3903bf799d66853759067a7032c5d126383281b3b969414627312f5576&width=1280&quality=90","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-12-19 00:30:01","author":"The Associated Press","authors":["The Associated Press"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.073},{"id":274381872,"title":"Arnold Schwarzenegger is shooting a movie as Santa, and it will put you in the jolliest holiday mood","text":"Shopping Trends\n\n The Shopping Trends team is independent of the journalists at CTV News.

Jean Carroll in the 1990s and defaming her by denying that an assault took place, although the judge presiding over the trial later said that Trump's actions met \"the meaning of 'rape' in common modern parlance.\"What To KnowWhile sharing an article on former Democratic Illinois Governor Rod Blagojevich calling for Trump to sue Pritzker, Stone wrote the following on X, formerly Twitter, earlier on Wednesday: \"President Trump should sue billionaire Governor JD [sic] Pritzker who falsely called him a rapist.\"Pritzker referred to Trump as an \"adjudicated rapist\" on multiple occasions while acting as a surrogate for the Democratic presidential campaigns of President Joe Biden and later Vice President Kamala Harris over the summer.\"Donald Trump is a convicted felon, an adjudicated rapist and a congenital liar,\" Pritzker said during a speech in June. \"He's a racist, sexist, misogynistic narcissist who wants to use the levers of power to enrich himself and punish anyone who dares speak a word against him.\"What People Are SayingBlagojevich—an outspoken Trump supporter since being granted clemency by the then-president in 2020 after serving several years in federal prison on corruption charges—called for Trump to follow up his ABC suit by taking similar legal action against Pritzker in a post to X on Monday.\"Now that Trump successfully won his defamation case against ABC for calling him a 'rapist,' when will he sue Illinois Governor J.B. Pritzker for repeatedly lying & calling him the same thing?\" Blagojevich wrote.What Happens NextWhile it is unclear whether Trump intends to file a lawsuit against Pritzker, the former and future president has seemingly started a legal revenge campaign against critics and perceived political enemies before his inauguration on January 20.Trump filed a lawsuit on Monday against retired pollster J. Ann Selzer, the Des Moines Register and its parent company Gannett for what he alleges was \"brazen election interference\" for publishing a poll that showed Harris with a narrow lead in The Hawkeye State shortly before the election.","summary":"Illinois Governor JB Pritzker referred to Trump as an \"adjudicated rapist\" several times earlier this year.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/roger-stone-urges-trump-sue-illinois-governor-calling-him-rapist-2003191","image":"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2547590/roger-stone-jb-pritzker-donald-trump-lawsuit.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-12-19 00:22:58","author":"Aila Slisco","authors":["Aila Slisco"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.173},{"id":274384098,"title":"Sweeping Chinese hack of U.S. telecoms firms is 'still going on,' official says","text":"A sweeping Chinese government hacking campaign against American telecoms firms is a “very, very serious matter” that is “still going on,” Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas said Thursday in an interview on MSNBC. Mayorkas confirmed that the long-term effort, nicknamed Salt Typhoon, was “a very sophisticated hack” that was not done “overnight.” The hacking campaign is one of the largest intelligence compromises in U.S. history. It has breached eight domestic telecom and internet service providers and dozens of others around the world, a White House official said earlier this month. The U.S., Australia, Canada and New Zealand claim it is part of an intelligence operation conducted by China. The presidential campaigns of Donald Trump and Kamala Harris, as well as the office of Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., told NBC News in October that the FBI had informed them that they had been targeted. Mayorkas said the federal government has “taken action,” and the “telecom providers are focused intensely on it, and they are working in partnership with us to remediate it.” The New York Times reported on Monday that the data Salt Typhoon has given Beijing a road map that will help it determine which Chinese spies have been identified by U.S. officials and which have not. Mayorkas confirmed that the Commerce Department issued a notice last week to China Telecom Americas, the American subsidiary of one of China’s largest communications companies. The notice said that the department had reached a preliminary finding that China Telecom America's provision of cloud services and its presence in American networks posed a national security risk to the U.S. Mayorkas said the firm had 30 days to respond. “It’s very important to send a message and the message has substance to it,” he said. “It’s not purely symbolic.” Defending response to drones Mayorkas repeated that U.S. officials believed that the sightings of drones in the northeastern U.S. did not represent a threat to public safety. “We know of no threat to people’s security, and if we learn of any cause for concern, we will take action,” he said. “And we will communicate immediately with the American public.” Congress needs to pass laws that will give DHS, as well as state and local officials, more ability to regulate drones, Mayorkas said. Drones are “not a new phenomenon,” he added, and DHS needs “our authorities to catch up with the development of drone activity over the last 10 years.” Officials need “the authority to take down drones when the situation so warrants,” Mayorkas said, and that “state and local officials, law enforcement officials, should have counter drone authorities with appropriate safeguards.” Mayorkas also defended the Biden administration’s record on immigration. He said that the administration has “removed or returned or expelled more people than in the prior administration, referring to the first-term of President-elect Donald Trump. ” He argued that the Biden Administration has “been tough on enforcement\" and \"focused intensively on individuals who pose a public safety threat.\" Since Biden took executive actions in June designed to deter migrants from crossing into the U.S., \"the number of individuals encountered at our southern border are below 2019 levels,” Mayorkas said. “And that’s very important to note.”","summary":"A sweeping Chinese government hacking campaign against American telecoms firms is a “very, very serious matter” that is “still going on,” DHS Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas said  in an interview.","url":"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/national-security/vast-chinese-hack-eight-us-telecoms-firms-still-going-official-says-rcna181319","image":"https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-1500w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2024-10/241008-alejandro-majorkas-se-126p-8e76d3.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-12-19 00:21:36","author":"Andrea Mitchell,Nicole Moeder","authors":["Andrea Mitchell","Nicole Moeder"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.188},{"id":274380510,"title":"Major change in the training of British troops as it's 'what the Ukrainians need'","text":"British troops could be sent to Ukraine as part of training missions as the government aims to forge a new leadership role in the war, according to the defence secretary.\n\nJohn Healey opened up the possibility that troops could carry out training in Ukraine instead of in the UK. He said the country needed to \"make the training a better fit for what the Ukrainians need.\"\n\nSpeaking to The Times, he said: \"We [need to] make it easier to the Ukrainians to access and we [need to work with the Ukrainians to help them motivate and mobilise more recruits.\" When he was asked if it meant extending the training of Ukrainian recruits in the UK to their country he responded: \"We will look wherever we can to respond to what the Ukrainians want. They are the ones fighting.”\n\nHealey is in Ukraine and said he would share a five-point plan with his counterpart Rustem Umerov about how the UK would continue to support the country in its war against Russia in the year ahead. This included bolstering the number of Ukrainians being trained by UK forces as well as providing more money and new weapons.\n\nThe defence secretary arrived in Ukraine just weeks before US President-Elect Donald Trump returns to the White House following his election victory in November. The Republican has stated he would end the war in a single day, although he has not specified what he means by that. \n\nHealey said any talks regarding Ukraine's future needed to be made from a \"position of strength.\" He also does not agree with Trump that negotiations should be opened up with Putin. \n\nHe remarked on Trump's claim he'd quickly end the war, adding: \"Anyone who thinks that fight [to] talk is going to be a simple switch, misses I think the likely reality that you may have talking and still fighting. And whether or not you have got talking that may or may not be successful in reaching an agreement.”\n\nThe UK defence secretary said Ukraine needed to build up its fighting capabilities to further deter the Russians. The visit comes after Ukraine carried out a high-profile assassination of top Russian general Igor Kirillov. \n\nDespite this Russia has started making gains across the frontline as Putin aims to conquer as much territory from Ukraine ahead of any possible peace talks. But Putin appears unable to order his troops to move deeper into Ukraine after tens of thousands of its soldiers were killed in the war.","summary":"British troops could carry out training in Ukraine instead of in the UK with defence secretary John Healey saying the government needed to &quot;make the training a better fit&quot;","url":"https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/world-news/major-change-training-british-troops-34341694","image":"https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article34341743.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_UKRAINE-BRITAIN-CONFLICT-WAR-DIPLOMACY-DEFENCE.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-12-19 00:19:22","author":"Anders Anglesey,Bradley Jolly","authors":["Anders Anglesey","Bradley Jolly"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":0.076},{"id":274381330,"title":"Political donations rules ‘need strengthening’ says head of Electoral Commission","text":"The rules around donations to political parties need strengthening to “protect the electoral system from foreign interference”, the head of the elections watchdog has said.\n\nVijay Rangarajan, chief executive of the Electoral Commission, told The Guardian that it is “crucial” that people have “trust in the financing” of the political system.\n\nIt comes amid reports that X owner Elon Musk has been preparing to make a large donation to Reform UK.\n\nIn an interview with the newspaper, Mr Rangarajan said: “It’s crucial that UK voters have trust in the financing of our political system, so they need to see how parties and campaigners are financed and how they spend that money at elections.”\n\nAccording to UK election rules, parties can accept donations from a number of sources including individuals on the UK electoral register or a UK-registered company.\n\nEarlier this week, Reform UK leader Nigel Farage suggested talks were underway with Elon Musk about a potential donation to the party, saying that the two had discussed money and there will be “ongoing negotiations”.\n\nMr Farage described his hour-long meeting with Mr Musk at Donald Trump’s Mar-a-Lago resort on Monday as “great” and “historic”, saying he and party treasurer Nick Candy had “learned a great deal about the Trump ground game”.\n\n“We only have one more chance left to save the West and we can do great things together,” he said.\n\nWriting in The Telegraph after the meeting, Mr Farage said Mr Musk described Labour and the Conservatives as “the uniparty” and “left us in no doubt that he is right behind us”.\n\n“Inevitably, following such intense media speculation, the issue of money was discussed, and there will be ongoing negotiations on that score,” the Reform UK leader added.","summary":"It comes amid reports that X owner Elon Musk has been preparing to make a large donation to Reform UK.\n\n\nThe post Political donations rules ‘need strengthening’ says head of Electoral Commission appeared first on Jersey Evening Post.","url":"https://www.jerseyeveningpost.com/morenews/uknews/2024/12/19/political-donations-rules-need-strengthening-says-head-of-electoral-commission/","image":"https://d3gvyx4eg3tne0.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Img39536549.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-12-19 00:19:18","author":"UK News","authors":["UK News"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.007},{"id":274382664,"title":"Will the bill to avert a government shutdown pass without Trump's support?","text":"Will the bill to avert a government shutdown pass without Trump's support?\n For the second time in three months, Congress is facing a fast-approaching deadline to pass a short-term funding bill to prevent a government shutdown.

Sen. Mike Rounds’ recent praise of outgoing FBI Director Christopher Wray netted the South Dakota Republican a warning from Charlie Kirk, an influential pro-Trump activist: “Don’t be surprised, Mike Rounds, when you get a primary challenge.”\n\nIowa Sen. Joni Ernst also drew the wrath of Kirk and other conservative activists when she raised questions about past sexual assault allegations against Pete Hegseth, Trump’s choice to lead the Department of Defense. (Hegseth has denied the allegations.)\n\nErnst has since met with Hegseth and has cooled her criticism but her comments have spurred talk of a primary challenge. Podcaster Jason Smith launched a long-shot bid earlier this month, while Iowa talk show host Steve Deace suggested he would primary the two-term senator should Trump give the OK.\n\n“It’s very difficult to take [a sitting senator] out without the blessing of the king,” he said in an interview Wednesday, adding that he’s been approached by numerous national, state and local Republicans about a possible run against Ernst.\n\nBoth Rounds and Ernst are up for reelection in 2026.\n\nHeritage Action, the political arm of the conservative Heritage Foundation think tank, has already launched an ad blitz in support of Hegseth, Tulsi Gabbard and other announced Trump Cabinet nominees. The digital ads are running in states that have Senate contests next cycle, including South Dakota, Texas, Louisiana and Maine, all with GOP senators on the 2026 ballot.\n\nAt the height of his power\n\nBut it isn’t just Trump’s Cabinet picks who are raising the stakes for Republican senators.\n\nDevotion to Trump has long been a red line for Republican voters. But now, Trump is at the height of his political power and poised to take office with a far more compliant Congress than the one he dealt with in his first term.\n\n“Trump won a decisive victory and he overperformed … every single Republican senator on the ballot this cycle,” said Matt Mackowiak, a longtime Republican operative based in Austin, Texas. “He is the strongest he’s ever been among Republican voters.”\n\nElon Musk, a close Trump adviser, threatened Wednesday on X, the social media platform he owns, that any member of Congress who votes for the year-end legislative package unveiled Tuesday should be voted out in two years, a remark that came as support for the measure waned. Musk, the world’s richest man, spent millions to support Trump through super PACs leading up to this year’s elections.\n\nStill, in recent years, it’s been rare for an incumbent senator to lose a primary. The last one to do so was appointed Alabama Sen. Luther Strange, who lost a special election Republican primary to Roy Moore in 2017. Moore went on to lose to Democrat Doug Jones.\n\nOne senator up for reelection in 2026 has already drawn a high-profile primary challenger. Louisiana state Treasurer John Fleming, a former congressman, launched a bid earlier this month against Sen. Bill Cassidy. In his campaign announcement, Fleming alluded to the senator’s 2021 vote to convict Trump at his second impeachment trial, saying that “those who turned their backs on [Trump] and America First were not committed to his fight to make America great again.”\n\nTexas Sen. John Cornyn could face several challengers from the right should he run for a fifth term, including from state Attorney General Ken Paxton, a staunch Trump ally.\n\nWest Virginia Sen. Shelley Moore Capito has already drawn a 2026 primary challenge from a former state delegate and convicted Jan. 6 rioter, who called her a “RINO,” or Republican in Name Only, in his campaign announcement.\n\nMackowiak, though, says it’s too soon to say whether the flurry of threats against other sitting senators will result in viable primary challenges.\n\n“We’ll have to see how the year plays out,” he said.\n\nMore bark than bite?\n\nRepublicans are defending 20 seats in 2026, not counting likely special elections in Ohio (for the remaining term of incoming Vice President JD Vance) and Florida (for GOP Sen. Marco Rubio’s unfinished term if he’s confirmed as Trump’s secretary of State). As many as 10 of those incumbents could face challenges from the party’s MAGA wing.\n\nOf course, most of those incumbents – with the exception of Collins – are strong Trump allies.\n\n“I imagine Cornyn’s going to be a pretty strong partner with Trump on the border reconciliation bill, tax cuts, on the nominees. So, however the situation might appear to some people now, I think it’s gonna look very different by the end of the year,” Mackowiak said.\n\nCornyn has already said he plans to seek reelection next year.\n\n“I do expect him to have a primary, but whether it’s a serious, credible candidate and how many there are and whether Trump weighs in, remains to be seen,” Mackowiak said.\n\nIn South Dakota, Rounds is unlikely to be seriously threatened by a MAGA-backed challenger, said Jon D. Schaff, a professor of political science at Northern State University in Aberdeen, S.D.\n\n“Whether the more ardent Trump supporters are going to extend their sort of brinkmanship that they’re suggesting with nominees to other policies, I suppose that’s probably true,” Schaff said. “I don’t think that Mike Rounds’ voting record is going to be the issue if there is an issue, because he’s been in the Senate before with Donald Trump. … I don’t think that there are going to be any policy differences with the Trump administration.”\n\nRounds’ biggest liability with Trump’s more pugnacious allies might be one of style, not political substance, Schaff said.\n\n“Mike Rounds is not perceived as a fighter, and that’s probably his biggest problem,” he said of the former two-term South Dakota governor.\n\nNorth Carolina Sen. Thom Tillis, who has said he expects to draw a primary challenger based on his past elections, has the distinction of running in a swing state that voted for Trump by 3 points last month. He and Collins are among the senators expected to have the most competitive general elections in 2026.\n\n“I don’t ever worry about getting primaried,” Tillis, a former speaker of the North Carolina House, said Wednesday at the Capitol. “This is my job to be able to win elections. I’ve done that for about 20 years.”","url":"https://rollcall.com/2024/12/18/republican-senators-trump-primary-challenge/","image":"https://rollcall.com/app/uploads/2024/12/ernst_BC_088_121024.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-12-19 00:11:22","author":"Daniela Altimari","authors":["Daniela Altimari"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.073},{"id":274379462,"title":"How McConnell could remain a thorn in Trump&#8217;s side next Congress","text":"The feud between Donald Trump and Mitch McConnell could soon spark anew in the next Congress with the Kentucky Republican poised to hold ample sway over the president-elect’s agenda and nominees. \n\nMcConnell will leave GOP leadership when the 119th Congress is seated on Jan. 3. But that does not mean the outgoing Senate minority leader will lack power — or the ability to be a thorn in the once and future president’s side.\n\nOne Republican senator, who has butted heads before with McConnell, acknowledged the “unique role” the longtime GOP leader is expected to play next year, despite questions about his health after a recent fall. But the senator, granted anonymity to be candid, chuckled as he expressed a desire to steer clear of the Trump-McConnell dynamic.\n\nAnd Alabama Sen. Tommy Tuberville, a staunch Trump ally who cut his teeth in the chamber under McConnell’s leadership, said the president-elect and outgoing GOP leader “haven’t always gelled very well over the years.”\n\n“President Trump is a very forceful leader. Sen. McConnell is kind of slower and takes his time, and likes to think about things. And, sometimes, that doesn’t work out when you have two different personalities,” Tuberville said, likening the relationship to a tortoise and hare trying to reach agreement on tactics and strategies.\n\nThe likely first votes on which McConnell would need to decide whether to buck or back Trump involve some of his announced law enforcement and national security nominees, as well as the vaccine-skeptical Robert F. Kennedy as Health and Human Services secretary. \n\n“McConnell still represents Kentuckians, and they voted for President Trump. … That’s what I look at. If I were to even question anything about any of … these nominees, I’d get reprimanded from my people back in the state that voted for Donald Trump, as well as me,” Tuberville said. “He doesn’t have the leadership role anymore, but he does have one vote. We’re going to get three to waste.” \n\nTrump and his surrogates have sent mixed messages about whether he would back Republican primary candidates more in line with his “Make America Great Again” movement to challenge sitting senators who oppose his nominees. The former president said at a news conference at Mar-a-Lago earlier this week that those who opposed his picks “for political reasons or stupid reasons … probably should be primaried.” But he also suggested that senators who had “reasonable or fair” reasons for voting against his nominees, “or if they really disagree with somebody,” would not be hit with primary opponents. \n\nRepublicans are slated to hold a 53-47 majority in the next Senate, meaning Trump can only lose three GOP senators on each vote to get some of his more contentious nominees confirmed (with incoming Vice President JD Vance, as the Senate president, able to break any 50-50 ties). That would give McConnell, long billed as a master Senate tactician, some cards to play against a president who has harshly criticized him, including dubbing him “Old Crow,” and who insulted his wife — former Trump Cabinet member Elaine Chao — with a racial slur.\n\nStill, as Tuberville alluded to, McConnell would need at least three other Senate Republicans to join him and all Democratic Caucus members on any majority vote against Trump’s picks.\n\nMcConnell’s office did not respond to an inquiry seeking comment on how the veteran senator intends to decide on any potential opposition to the 47th president.\n\nBut Ford O’Connell, a Republican strategist, said in a Tuesday email that “while it’s widely believed that McConnell is serving his final term, his allies in the Senate still have elections to win, which significantly weakens McConnell’s influence.”\n\n“With Trump’s popularity among Republicans at an all-time high, McConnell would do well to recognize that this is no longer the Republican Party he once helped shape — it is now the party of Donald J. Trump,” O’Connell said. “While the two may differ on certain Cabinet appointments and the future of U.S. foreign policy, there is no denying that Trump has emerged victorious in defining the party’s direction. McConnell is keenly aware of this shift and would be wise to pick his battles judiciously.”\n\nYet, McConnell this week fired an opening salvo, penning an essay warning Trump to resist his isolationist instincts.\n\n“The response to four years of weakness must not be four years of isolation. … If the United States continues to retreat, its enemies will be only too happy to fill the void,” McConnell wrote in a Foreign Affairs essay titled “The Price of American Retreat.”\n\n“The administration will face calls from within the Republican Party to give up on American primacy. It must reject them,” added McConnell, who will chair the Rules Committee and Defense Appropriations Subcommittee next Congress. “America will not be made great again by those who simply want to manage its decline.”\n\nMcConnell is expected to have plenty of chances to potentially push back on Trump beginning next year. Incoming Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., said in a Tuesday floor speech that Friday votes “will be the norm” in the 119th Congress. And if weekend work, at times, is needed to “get the job done,” Thune added, “so be it.”\n\n‘Challenge for Trump’\n\nIt’s not just a few Republicans who expect periodic Trump-McConnell fireworks.\n\n“I do think one of the … principles that will be tested is the institutional prerogatives of the Senate, and that includes that confirmation process,” said outgoing Democratic Sen. Bob Casey, who lost reelection in Pennsylvania last month. “And Leader McConnell has been a strong supporter of the institution. I hope that plays out in the confirmation process, and beyond.”\n\nAnother veteran Democratic senator, Connecticut’s Richard Blumenthal, said he expects McConnell to “continue to be straightforward, candid, persuasive and influential.”\n\n“He’s respected, not only for his position as the Republican leader, but for the insight and intelligence that he brings to issues that are important,” Blumenthal said. “He has a lot of experience and wisdom on many of these issues.” \n\nOne Republican source with Senate ties said that the chamber “will be the bigger challenge for Trump,” noting that all House members will be up for reelection in 2026. “That’s not the case in the Senate, so that’s one reason [why] you’ve seen them go against Trump before,” added the Republican source, who was also granted anonymity to be candid. \n\nAlong with McConnell, the GOP source put Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, Susan Collins of Maine and Thom Tillis of North Carolina in the group of Republican senators most likely to sometimes butt heads with Trump. “There’s also Jim Justice,” the source said of the West Virginia governor elected last month to succeed retiring independent Sen. Joe Manchin III. “We’ll see about him. He was a Democrat not that long ago.” \n\nOther sources added Todd Young of Indiana, Joni Ernst of Iowa and even sometimes-Trump golfing partner Lindsey Graham of South Carolina among the GOP senators who, on specific issues important to them and their respective states, might deviate from Trump. \n\nG. William Hoagland, a former senior GOP Senate aide, predicted a sometimes-bumpy path toward confirmation for some of Trump’s nominees.\n\n“The White House’s Senate liaison will have their hands full with the confirmation process, hearings and counting votes, and possibly the uncomfortable job of telling POTUS when the votes are not there for his Cabinet picks or [department and agency] positions,” Hoagland, now with the Bipartisan Policy Center, said in a recent email.\n\nJames Braid, a former Vance aide whom Trump tapped to lead the White House’s legislative affairs office, will need “to work with John Thune’s office quickly to establish that trust and can convince them he speaks for the President,” Hoagland said.\n\n“But given the volatility of Trump,” he added, “that may not be an easy task.”","url":"https://rollcall.com/2024/12/18/how-mcconnell-could-remain-a-thorn-in-trumps-side-next-congress/","image":"https://rollcall.com/app/uploads/2024/12/mcconnell_BC_132_121724.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-12-19 00:11:22","author":"John T.

That language was not included in the bill released Tuesday. \n\n“Congress should be working to raise Americans’ wages and lower their health care costs, not sneaking new member perks into must-pass legislation behind closed doors,” Maine Democratic Rep. Jared Golden said in a statement Wednesday. “If members can’t get by on our already generous salaries and benefits, they should find another line of work. As long as these provisions are in the CR, I will vote against it.” \n\nThe overall package appeared to face longer odds on Wednesday afternoon after President-elect Donald Trump came out against it and the list of Republican defectors grew.\n\nThe debate over a COLA has raged for years, with those in favor arguing that depressing member wages makes it more difficult for people who are not independently wealthy to run for Congress.\n\nGeorgia Republican Rep. Andrew Clyde, meanwhile, argued earlier this year that blocking a pay raise may be unconstitutional, forming an unlikely partnership with Rep. Steny H. Hoyer, D-Md., the former House majority leader, who has long fought for a COLA.\n\nBut opposition remains, as members fear the optics of putting more money in their own pockets. And previous efforts have repeatedly fallen short. Earlier this year, bipartisan negotiations around the fiscal 2024 spending bill would have upped member pay, but ultimately hit a wall.\n\nGolden is among a small group of members who have railed against the COLA, raising uncertainty about a spending package whose size has also angered many in the GOP. \n\nHe led a bipartisan letter to Speaker Mike Johnson and Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries earlier this year calling for the exclusion of any COLA in fiscal 2025 spending bills.\n\nThe letter was signed by Republican Rep. Brian Fitzpatrick of Pennsylvania, along with Democratic Reps. Marie Gluesenkamp Perez of Washington, Josh Harder of California and Chris Pappas of New Hampshire. It notes that members of Congress draw a salary higher than roughly 90 percent of American households.\n\nSome in the House voiced their anger over the COLA move but did not join Golden in pulling their support from the package containing the continuing resolution, at least as of early Wednesday afternoon.\n\n“I have two words for you: not happy,” said Rep. Eric Sorensen of Illinois, who joined a separate letter, signed by Pappas and Minnesota Rep. Angie Craig, to Legislative Branch appropriators in June opposing a COLA. Sorensen said he had not decided how he would vote on the stopgap measure.\n\nGluesenkamp Perez issued a statement Wednesday urging House leaders to reconsider. “Any way you slice it, Congress giving itself a pay raise right now is bananas,” she wrote.\n\nCraig, who on Tuesday won the top Democratic spot on the House Agriculture Committee for the next Congress, said she was frustrated but would not vote against the bill, which includes a one-year extension of the farm bill.\n\n“I was shocked late last night to learn that Republicans had put that in,” Craig said of the pay bump. “But this bill also has $650 million in economic assistance to family farmers in it. It has year-round E15, which is really important to my corn growers back home. And it keeps the government open and our skies safe.”\n\n“So I’m not going to vote against it … but this is one of the reasons Americans don’t trust us,” Craig added. \n\nGolden also objected to a separate provision in the stopgap measure that would allow members of Congress to purchase health insurance through the Federal Employees Health Benefits program, rather than through exchanges under the Affordable Care Act.\n\nAccording to Golden, the change would lower out-of-pocket costs for members at the expense of taxpayers.\n\nThe fate of the year-end package remained unclear on Wednesday afternoon, as Republican leaders heard complaints on its myriad provisions. Elon Musk launched a public campaign against it, posting repeatedly on X. \n\n“Any member of the House or Senate who votes for this outrageous spending bill deserves to be voted out in 2 years,” wrote the world’s richest man, who spent millions boosting Trump and Republicans in the last election cycle.","url":"https://rollcall.com/2024/12/18/pay-raise-in-stopgap-funding-bill-a-sticking-point-for-some-members/","image":"https://rollcall.com/app/uploads/2024/12/house_votes800_061523.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-12-19 00:11:22","author":"Republican Rep.

The only way to do that is with a temporary funding bill WITHOUT DEMOCRAT GIVEAWAYS combined with an increase in the debt ceiling,” Trump and Vance wrote on the social platform X. “Anything else is a betrayal of our country.”\n\nLawmakers spent the day waiting for Trump to weigh in, after his unofficial “Department of Government Efficiency” co-chairs Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy weighed in against it. Even before Trump’s statement, Musk wrote that the “terrible bill is dead” on X, which he owns. \n\nThere was no official word yet from Johnson, R-La., who was huddling with other top Republicans in his office on next steps. GOP leaders sent word out during the meeting that no further votes would be held Wednesday night.\n\nTalk of a skinnier bill with a “clean” continuing resolution running to mid-March had been circulating before Trump’s missive. Plenty of GOP conservatives appear ready to back a disaster aid package, including Florida Rep. Anna Paulina Luna, a Freedom Caucus member who was in the meeting in Johnson’s office Wednesday afternoon.\n\nRep. Kevin Hern, R-Okla., said he thought Trump would have preferred to get all the fiscal 2025 spending bills done this year as well, but would settle for at least the debt limit and a shutdown being taken off the table.\n\n“If you have a CR with the debt limit, at least you are getting part of the problem done,” Hern said.\n\n‘Deserves to be voted out’\n\nAnger over the massive, 1,547-page year-end spending bill among the GOP rank and file, fueled by Trump’s top advisers, had already thrown the carefully negotiated package into question with just two days before the deadline to prevent a partial government shutdown.\n\nHouse Republican leaders had been mulling a vote as early as Wednesday afternoon on the legislative package. But that became unrealistic after leadership checked in with members during an early afternoon vote series in the face of grumbling from across the GOP conference and from Trump’s allies.\n\n“Any member of the House or Senate who votes for this outrageous spending bill deserves to be voted out in 2 years!” Musk wrote earlier on X.\n\nThe bill that Johnson negotiated with Democratic leaders contains about $117 billion in emergency spending that is not offset, mostly for victims of natural disasters as well as $10 billion in financial aid for farmers and nearly $6 billion to buy more nuclear-powered Virginia-class attack submarines.\n\nMembers of Congress would get their first pay raise in 15 years, and Democratic and Republican leaders also agreed to tack on over 1,000 more pages of unrelated legislation representing the pent-up demands of numerous authorizing committees over the past two years.\n\nTrump and Vance took particular umbrage at two provisions: the member pay raise and language that could block the Justice Department from subpoenaing House data stored by third-party providers like Google and Microsoft. \n\n“Congress is considering a spending bill that would give sweetheart provisions for government censors and for Liz Cheney. The bill would make it easier to hide the records of the corrupt January 6 committee —which accomplished nothing for the American people and hid security failures that happened that day,” Trump and Vance wrote.\n\n“This bill would also give Congress a pay increase while many Americans are struggling this Christmas,” they added.\n\nMost Democrats would have backed the measure, House Appropriations ranking member Rosa DeLauro, D-Conn., said, likely giving it the two-thirds vote it needed to pass the chamber under suspension of the rules. But that was the problem for many Republicans who saw the package as too tilted toward the other side’s priorities, even if many of the legislative add-ons had bipartisan support.\n\nThe situation was getting dicey for Johnson himself, who did a lot of the heavy lifting together with House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., and Senate Majority Leader Charles E. Schumer, D-N.Y.\n\nA number of House Republicans were starting to make threats against Johnson’s job as the day wore on; he needs to secure a majority vote to remain speaker on Jan. 3, and any GOP defections make that difficult if not impossible.\n\n“As of now, I still support the speaker,” said Maryland Rep. Andy Harris, chairman of the rebellious Freedom Caucus. “But I’m hearing more and more from members, inside and outside the Freedom Caucus, very concerned about the way this week has played out.” Rep. Eric Burlison, R-Mo., said Johnson was “a good human being,” but added, “I think that he can do better. I think he can fight harder.”\n\nDaniel Hillburn contributed to this report.","url":"https://rollcall.com/2024/12/18/trump-scrambles-stopgap-bill-as-gop-leaders-mull-next-moves/","image":"https://rollcall.com/app/uploads/2024/12/GettyImages-2189754096.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-12-19 00:11:22","author":"Daniel Hillburn","authors":["Daniel Hillburn"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.025},{"id":274379364,"title":"Gjykata e Lartë pranon të shqyrtojë çështjen e TikTokut","text":"Gjykata e Lartë tha të mërkurën se do të dëgjojë muajin e ardhshëm argumentet mbi kushtetueshmërinë e ligjit federal që mund ta ndalojë veprimtarinë e rrjetit TikTok në Shtetet e Bashkuara nëse nuk shitet nga kompania kineze ombrellë.\n\nAnëtarët e gjykatës do të dëgjojnë më 10 janar argumentet nëse ligji kufizon në mënyrë të palejueshme lirinë e fjalës në kundërshtim me Amendamentin e Parë.

That left Powell repeatedly citing a need for \"caution\" about committing to additional rate cuts from here, a tone that triggered a slide in stock prices and a recalibration of market estimates for further easing: Just a single Fed rate cut is now priced in for 2025.\n\n\"Some people did take a very preliminary step and start to incorporate highly conditional estimates of economic effects of policies into their forecasts at this meeting,\" Powell said in response to a question about the degree to which Trump factored into officials' thinking. \"Some people said they didn't do so, and some people didn't say whether they did or not, so we have people making a bunch of different approaches to that but some did identify policy uncertainty as one of the reasons for their writing down more uncertainty around inflation.\"\n\nAhead of the Fed decision, rates had already been lowered last week by the European Central Bank and Bank of Canada, with both expected to deliver some additional easing in 2025 amid weakening outlooks.\n\nWhile ECB President Christine Lagarde was vague about further rate cuts, she went out of her way to emphasize downside risks to growth, including from prospective trade tensions with the United States under Trump.\n\nMeanwhile, rate decisions are due in the coming hours from central banks in Japan, Sweden, Norway and the United Kingdom. A Reuters survey of Japanese businesses published last week showed nearly three-quarters expect Trump to have a negative effect on their operating environment, something Bank of Japan officials may have to reckon with as the world's lone developed central bank still trying to tighten policy. \n\nWhile Trump may have been just at the periphery of officials' thinking at the Fed in Washington, he was a central focus in Ottawa when Canadian Finance Minister Chrystia Freeland quit after clashing with Prime Minister Justin Trudeau on issues including how to handle possible U.S. tariffs under the next U.S. administration.\n\nFreeland exited on Monday just hours before she was due to present a fall economic update to parliament. The document showed the minority Liberal government had run up a 2023/24 budget deficit of C$61.9 billion, much higher than predicted.\n\nFreeland said the threat of new U.S. tariffs represented a grave danger after Trump last month warned he would issue levies on goods imported from Canada and Mexico of 25 per cent unless the two U.S. neighbors limit the flow of migrants and fentanyl into the U.S.\n\n\"That means keeping our fiscal powder dry today, so we have the reserves we may need for a tariff war. That means eschewing costly political gimmicks, which we can ill afford,\" she wrote in a letter to Trudeau posted on X.\n\nMeanwhile, crypto market enthusiasm for Trump's notion of establishing a strategic reserve of bitcoin was dealt a setback when Powell said the Fed had no legal authority to hold it, adding declaratively that it had no plan to seek a change in the law so that it could.\n\n\"That's the kind of thing for Congress to consider, but we are not looking for a law change at the Fed,\" Powell said.\n\nThe remark contributed to a broad slide in crypto-related assets, including a 5 per cent drop in bitcoin itself, its largest decline in more than three months.","summary":"","url":"https://www.channelnewsasia.com/business/trump-not-yet-office-already-figure-global-economic-policy-4815411","image":"https://dam.mediacorp.sg/image/upload/s--zqP7y1eq--/fl_relative,g_south_east,l_mediacorp:cna:watermark:2024-04:reuters_1,w_0.1/f_auto,q_auto/c_fill,g_auto,h_338,w_600/v1/one-cms/core/2024-12-19t000829z_2_lynxmpekbi009_rtroptp_3_usa-trump.jpg?itok=CZVvP-oF","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-12-19 00:08:29","author":null,"language":"en","source_country":"sg","sentiment":-0.079},{"id":274379096,"title":"ABC’s George Stephanopoulos was repeatedly warned not to use word ‘rape’ by producer — but said it anyway: sources","text":"George Stephanopoulos was repeatedly told by his executive producer not to “use the word rape” before going on the air to discuss Donald Trump but the ABC News anchor ignored the warning — a decision that cost the network $16 million, The Post has learned.\n\nParent company Disney’s capitulation last week in the defamation lawsuit by Trump against ABC News and Stephanopoulos shocked media and legal experts, but the damning revelation could help explain why Mouse House CEO Bob Iger signed off on the settlement so quickly.\n\nThe “This Week” host uttered that Trump was “liable for rape” while discussing the civil lawsuit won by journalist E. Jean Carroll during an interview with Republican lawmaker Nancy Mace in March.\n\n“‘This Week’ producer said ‘don’t use the word rape’ before the segment started,” a network source told The Post. “The EP [executive producer] said it so many times.”\n\nA second source at the show confirmed via a text message viewed by The Post that Stephanopoulos was warned “not to say rape.”\n\nDisney’s chances of winning the lawsuit would be damaged if Stephanopoulos ignored his producer’s warning, legal experts told The Post.\n\nOften, when dealing with litigious subjects, the company’s legal team may speak to producers ahead of time to advise on language so as to avoid lawsuits, which is customary in the media industry.\n\nHowever, it is unclear whether ABC’s legal team had been involved before Stephanopoulos went on the air.\n\nABC News declined to comment. Reps for Disney and Stephanopoulos did not return requests for comment.\n\nIger agreed to the deal late Friday — hours after Florida Judge Cecilia Altonaga rejected a request to delay the case and ordered Trump and Stephanopoulos to sit for hours-long depositions just days before Christmas, the New York Times reported Wednesday.\n\nThe judge also demanded that Disney turn over emails and text messages sent by and to Stephanopoulos by Sunday — which could have forced the media mogul’s hand if the damning text messages surfaced, according to the Times.\n\nDisney’s top lawyer, Horacio Gutierrez, urged Iger to settle the suit rather than risk a civil trial in front of a jury in the president-elect’s home state, people familiar with the matter told the Wall Street Journal.\n\nIger also was worried that fighting the case could “risk damaging press protections” and “hurt the Disney brand,” according to the Times.\n\nIf Disney were to suffer a negative outcome in US district court in Florida, the company feared the possible repercussions of appealing to the Supreme Court given the current 6-3 right-leaning majority.\n\nAccording to the Journal, Disney was concerned that appealing an unfavorable ruling to the Supreme Court would have increased the risk of possibly overturning New York Times v.

The African island nation’s new leadership is seeking to amend the terms of the deal, which had initially been seen as a breakthrough in resolving long-standing territorial disputes.\r\nThe UK's Position: Strategic Military Interests\r\nThe British government continues to push forward with plans to hand over sovereignty of the Chagos Islands, a chain of over 60 islands in the Indian Ocean, to Mauritius. However, the deal includes a crucial stipulation: the UK will retain control of the largest island, Diego Garcia, for at least 99 years to maintain a strategic joint UK-US military base. This base is a critical asset for military operations across the Indian Ocean region.\r\n\r\nPrime Minister Navin Ramgoolam of Mauritius, who assumed office just last month, announced on Tuesday that his government was reopening negotiations over the deal. He stated that the current agreement did not align with the benefits the country expected from such an important arrangement. Addressing lawmakers in Mauritius' parliament, Ramgoolam confirmed that his government remains open to finalizing an agreement with the UK but had submitted new counterproposals for consideration.\r\nMauritius government to review the terms of the agreement\r\nIn response to the new developments, Stephen Doughty, the UK’s minister for overseas territories, expressed confidence that the deal would eventually be finalized. He acknowledged that it is entirely reasonable for the new Mauritian government to review the terms of the agreement before proceeding. In a statement to the House of Commons, Doughty emphasized that the deal was fair and balanced, benefiting both parties. He also noted that it had received support from the US, India, and the broader national security community.\r\n\r\nThe proposed deal has sparked debate across the political spectrum. The UK’s opposition Conservative Party has accused the government of relinquishing sovereignty over a British territory, while US President Joe Biden praised the agreement, calling it “historic” and underscoring its significance for the US Navy base on Diego Garcia. However, supporters of President-elect Donald Trump have raised concerns about the deal.\r\nStrategic Importance of Diego Garcia for Mauritias and others\r\nThe US military base on Diego Garcia, which hosts approximately 2,500 US military personnel, plays a vital role in military operations across the Middle East, South Asia, and East Africa. It has been described as \"an all but indispensable platform\" for securing US interests in these regions. The base has also been linked to controversial operations, including covert rendition flights during the War on Terror.\r\n\r\nThe Chagos Islands have been under British control since 1814. In the 1960s and 1970s, the UK forcibly removed nearly 2,000 residents, known as Chagossians, to make way for the US military base. This displacement has been a source of enduring grievance, with displaced Chagossians and their descendants campaigning for the right to return to their homeland. The new agreement would allow the return of these individuals, though they would be excluded from settling on Diego Garcia, due to the ongoing military presence there.\r\n\r\nAlso Read: US Supreme Court Takes Up Challenge To TikTok Ban","summary":"A historic deal between the UK and Mauritius over the Chagos Islands has hit a roadblock after Mauritius&#8217; new Prime Minister, Navin Ramgoolam, introduced counterproposals.

However, the central bank's outlook for the future is now more cautious, with a significantly slower pace of rate cuts projected for 2025. This shift follows a recent uptick in inflation and robust economic growth.\r\nSlower Pace of Rate Cuts Ahead\r\nThe Federal Reserve now anticipates just two rate cuts in 2025, a notable reduction from the four cuts they forecast in September. This change reflects a revised outlook that includes stronger economic growth, persistent inflation, and a more resilient labor market through both this year and 2025. These factors suggest that fewer rate cuts will be needed moving forward.\r\n\r\nThe forecasts made by the Federal Reserve could be influenced by the policies outlined by President-elect Donald Trump, including his plans to impose heavy tariffs on imports, restrict immigration, and cut taxes. Economists from Barclays and Goldman Sachs have suggested that these policies may be contributing to the Fed's expectation of higher inflation and continued growth in the coming year.\r\nCautious Approach by Federal Reserve\r\nThe Federal Reserve’s statement following the two-day meeting emphasized a more careful consideration of future rate adjustments. The statement, which previously read \"In considering additional adjustments...\" has been revised to include more specific language: \"The Fed will carefully assess incoming data, the evolving outlook, and the balance of risks.\" This change indicates that Fed officials are likely to take a more cautious approach when determining when and how much to adjust rates, potentially resulting in fewer or smaller rate cuts.\r\n\r\nWednesday’s decision marks the third consecutive rate cut by the Fed, bringing the benchmark short-term rate to a range of 4.25% to 4.5%. This move is expected to have a broad impact, lowering borrowing costs for credit cards, some mortgages, and auto loans. However, it may also lead to lower interest rates for savings accounts, which had recently been providing higher returns to savers.\r\nCurrent Federal Reserve Interest Rate\r\nLooking ahead, Federal Reserve officials now estimate that the federal funds rate will fall by only 0.5 percentage points in 2025, bringing it to a range of 3.75% to 4%. This is half the drop they had projected in September. Additionally, they foresee two more cuts in 2026, bringing the rate to approximately 3.4%, which is also slightly higher than previously expected. The Fed has also adjusted its estimate for the \"neutral\" rate, which is the level that neither stimulates nor slows the economy, raising it from 2.9% to 3%. This adjustment suggests that officials may not need to make as many cuts to reach the neutral rate.\r\n\r\nThe Federal Reserve reduces interest rates to make borrowing cheaper, helping to stimulate economic activity when needed. Conversely, it raises rates to combat inflation by making borrowing more expensive and cooling down the economy. In 2022 and 2023, the central bank raised the federal funds rate from near zero to 5.25% to 5.5%, the highest level in 23 years, in response to a surge in prices related to the pandemic.\r\nFed's Monetary Policy Goals\r\nThe Federal Reserve's preferred inflation measure has decreased significantly, from 7% in mid-2022 to 2.3% in recent months. As a result, the Fed has made several rate cuts, including a significant 0.5-point reduction in September and a quarter-point reduction in early November. However, recent data has presented challenges for the Fed, as core inflation—excluding food and energy—has ticked up slightly from 2.7% in July to 2.8% in October. Moreover, the consumer price index (CPI) rose sharply for the fourth consecutive month in November, adding to the complexity of the Fed’s decision-making process as it navigates the conflicting forces of inflation and growth.\r\n\r\nAlso Read: Investors Demand Sebi's Green Light For NSE IPO In Delhi High Court Plea","summary":"The Federal Reserve has cut its key interest rate by 0.25 percentage points, signaling a shift toward a more cautious approach in its monetary policy.

The audio recording has Trump saying that as a celebrity he was able to \"grab\" women by their genitalia, which was widely condemned as an inappropriate way to discuss women, especially as a presidential candidate.Trump, however, said the recording was simply \"locker room banter\" and did not accurately reflect the way he treats women. He also said, \"I said it, I was wrong and I apologize.\" Shortly after the tape's release, Trump won the presidential election against former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton in 2016.What To Know While speaking with former Illinois Governor Rod Blagojevich about a lewd comment Blagojevich had made, Rogan likened it to Trump's controversial remark about grabbing women's genitals.\"Well, that's the same thing as like the grab 'em by the p**** comment,\" Rogan said to Blagojevich on his podcast, The Joe Rogan Experience. \"Guys talk like that all the time for fun,\" Rogan said, adding, \"It's what guys do and they know that the other person doesn't mean it, that's why it's funny to say.\"Blagojevich, who an Illinois jury found guilty on 17 felony counts in 2010, including wire fraud, conspiracy and attempted extortion, replied, \"And let's face it, most of us like that stuff.\"Blagojevich went on to recount hearing about the tape while he was in prison, saying it was a \"slimy thing to do to Trump\" right before the election.\"I think people have to realize that so many of these things that are taken out of context are taken outta context for a reason.

The move was a direct challenge to Republican House Speaker Mike Johnson, who rolled out the sweeping plan on Tuesday night.\n\n Now, it appears Musk has successfully killed the stopgap measure in its cradle — before it was even brought to a vote. \n\n In a manic posting spree on Wednesday, the world’s richest man bombarded his platform X, formerly Twitter, with attacks on a proposed funding bill, which would’ve kept the government funded through March 14 and had bipartisan support. He also amplified misinformation about what’s in the 1,500-page bill — as did his non-governmental commission, the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), which is recommending cuts to government spending and regulations to the incoming Trump administration.\n\n Trump himself opposes the resolution, according to a joint statement shared Wednesday by Vice President-elect J.D. Vance. Various hard-right GOP representatives also vowed to vote against it. Should Johnson fail to get a spending plan passed by Dec. 20, the federal government will enter a partial shutdown ahead of the holidays. But that apparently sounded ideal to Musk and his social media clique.\n\n “YES,” Musk commented on an X post from a user who wrote, “Just close down the govt until January 20th. Defund everything. We will be fine for 33 days.” In his own post, Musk wrote, “No bills should be passed [by] Congress until Jan 20, when @realDonaldTrump takes office. None. Zero.” (Upon Trump’s inauguration, Republican majorities will control both chambers of Congress.) Elsewhere, Musk reshared a meme of himself hacking at the bill with a sword, captioned “KILL THE BILL.” In yet another post, he wrote: “Any member of the House or Senate who votes for this outrageous spending bill deserves to be voted out in 2 years!”\n\n Musk personally thanked a number of GOP representatives who announced via X that they were voting “no” on the bill, including Reps. Barry Moore, Anna Paulina Luna, Wesley Hunt, Eli Crane, Randy Weber, Michael Cloud, Jeff Van Drew, Warren Davidson, Keith Self, Kevin Kiley and Andy Ogles, many of whom blasted it as an “omnibus” package of excessive spending and Democratic giveaways.\n\n The funding bill, H.R. 10445, contained provisions for allocating roughly $100 billion to relief efforts to aid Americans recovering from natural disasters in the past two years, some $30 billion in aid to farmers, and federal funding to replace the collapsed Francis Scott Key Bridge in Baltimore. It would also have criminalized revenge porn, given the District of Columbia greater control over the area surrounding the defunct Robert F. Kennedy Memorial Stadium as they seek to bring the Washington Commanders back into the city, addressed transparency issues in hotel prices and live event ticketing, and implemented health care reforms, including some intended to lower prescription drug costs.\n\n More controversially, the bill included a pay raise for members Congress, justified as a cost of living adjustment, a provision which drew criticism from both sides of the aisle. At most, it would have boosted their income by $6,600, a 3.8 percent bump from the annual salary of $174,000 that most of them receive. The official DOGE account and Musk both falsely claimed that the pay raise would be $69,000, or nearly 40 percent. Musk meanwhile shared a post from a far-right influencer who wrote that the resolution would impose mask and vaccine mandates. Although there was a section about ensuring pandemic preparedness that mentioned the need for accelerated vaccine research, there is no language about mandating their administration, nor does the word “mask” appear.\n\n Musk and DOGE likewise bought into and spread the false claim that the bill earmarked billions of taxpayer dollars to build a new NFL stadium in Washington, D.C., at the site of RFK Stadium. In fact, the resolution said the exact opposite, stipulating a covenant that “the District may not use Federal funds for stadium purposes on the Campus, including training facilities, offices, and other structures necessary to support a stadium.” \n\n Other dubious complaints circulating on X were that the bill ensured “Deep State immunity,” as MAGA loyalists interpreted one provision to have been added in order to protect former Rep. Liz Cheney from prosecution over her role on the congressional committee that investigated the Jan. 6 Capitol riot. Trump has said that Cheney belongs in jail, and House Republicans yesterday released a report recommending the FBI investigate Cheney over alleged witness tampering in the congressional testimony of former Trump White House aide Cassidy Hutchinson. Some Republicans additionally accused the resolution of funding “censorship activities” because it extended support for the Global Engagement Center, an agency within the State Department tasked with identifying and countering “propaganda and disinformation efforts aimed at undermining or influencing the policies, security, or stability of the United States.”\n\n With the legislation apparently dead on arrival, Speaker Johnson now has an incredibly narrow window to get a deal done and stave off a shutdown. Reportedly, his backup plan would be to hold a vote on a new “clean” government funding bill, dropping the disaster and farm aid — as well as other expensive elements of the bill — and punt those issues to next year. But cutting some of that spending might cost Democratic support, and some Republican hardliners could still oppose the stripped-down deal.\n\n Musk took a victory lap on Wednesday as the odds of Congress passing the original bill collapsed, and touted posts about how X — not Musk himself — had supposedly saved the American people from wasteful government spending. “Your elected representatives have heard you and now the terrible bill is dead,” he wrote. “The voice of the people has triumphed!”\n\n Or the voice of the world’s richest man, anyway.","summary":"The Republican megadonor bombarded X with lies about a stopgap bill that would have extended federal funding until the spring","url":"https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-news/musk-trump-government-funding-deal-shutdown-1235211000/","image":"https://www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Elon_Musk_shutdown.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-12-19 00:00:30","author":"Miles Klee","authors":["Miles Klee"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.193},{"id":274389290,"title":"Bird flu is getting serious as Trump’s quacks flock to Washington","text":"The Centers for Disease Control reported the first person hospitalized with a severe illness linked to the H5N1 bird flu in the United States, according to a Wednesday press release.

This comes after 33 dairy herds were reported as sources of exposure in California, with many of the confirmed human bird flu cases linked to farm workers, particularly in the poultry and dairy industries. \n\nTo mitigate the risk, Newsom announced that California has launched a collaborative effort with local farms to reduce workers’ exposure to the virus.\n\n“This proclamation is a targeted action to ensure government agencies have the resources and flexibility they need to respond quickly to this outbreak,” Newsom said. “Building on California’s testing and monitoring system—the largest in the nation—we are committed to further protecting public health, supporting our agriculture industry, and ensuring that Californians have access to accurate, up-to-date information.”\n\nBird flu was first detected in the wild bird population in South Carolina in January 2022, followed by California a few months later.

The Nasdaq had traded above 20,000 for the first time Dec. 11.\n\nCanada's benchmark Toronto Stock Exchange (TSX) Composite Index fell 2.24 per cent to 24,557, making its return 17.65 per cent so far this year. \n\nIf the TSX regains ground lost since early December, when it was up more than 23 per cent year-to-date, it would be on track for its best year since 2009, when it returned 30.69 per cent.\n\nInvestor confidence in 2024 was likely fuelled by the prospect, and then the reality, of Bank of Canada interest-rate cuts at a time when the country’s inflation rate steadily declined to 1.9 per cent in November from a 39-year high of 8.1 per cent in June 2022. Five Bank of Canada interest-rate cuts lowered the central bank’s key interest rate to 3.25 per cent, down from five per cent in May. Economists, such as Central 1 chief economist Bryan Yu, told BIV that they expect the central bank to lower that interest rate further. \n\nThe U.S. Federal Reserve today reduced that country's key interest-rate by 25 basis points, to a range between 4.25 per cent and 4.5 per cent, a two-year low. It lowered rates by 50 basis points in September and then by 25 basis points last month. \n\nThose moves helped U.S. markets surge even more than Canadian ones despite the rate cuts in total adding up to be cumulatively less. \n\nVarious professional money managers in Vancouver told BIV that they have disproportionately weighted client funds in U.S. stocks in part because American equities have tended to outperform Canadian counterparts. \n\nEven after today's carnage, the S&P 500 index is up 23.81 per cent so far this year. This follows a 24-per-cent gain last year and if this year's gains hold, 2024 would be the first time since 1998 that the index has risen by more than 20 per cent in two consecutive years.\n\nReal estate investing lagged in 2024\n\nFor much of the past couple decades, a preferred investment for many in Greater Vancouver was to buy residential real estate, though that asset class has recently struggled when compared with stocks.\n\nThe Real Estate Board of Greater Vancouver pinned the benchmark price for all residential properties in the region at $1.17 million at the end of November, up a mere 1.45 per cent compared with the end of September 2022.\n\nDuring that same period, the TSX Composite Index returned more than 39.5 per cent while the S&P 500 generated a return greater than 68.2 per cent.\n\nThose exposed to the Nasdaq 100 index, which is heavily weighted with technology stocks, saw a nearly 90.8-per-cent gain in the 26-month period between the end of September 2022 and the end of November.\n\n“You can't forecast this stuff,” Murray Leith, Odlum Brown’s executive vice-president and director of investment research, told BIV.\n\n“The returns surpassed even the most optimistic prognosticators by quite a long shot.”\n\nUnpredictability in markets has fuelled the trend of investors buying exchange-traded funds (ETFs) that simply track an index of stocks. \n\nThe shift toward index funds—passive investments with low management fees—is also because actively managed funds for many years have consistently underperformed, in part due to fees.\n\nIn 2024, total assets in U.S.-based passive mutual funds and ETFs surpassed those in active ones for the first time, according to Morningstar research.\n\nThis came thanks to passive funds attracting higher capital inflows than active funds in each of the past nine years, it said.\n\nLeith said he believes part of the value provided by active money managers, such as himself, is that he ensures clients are diversified.\n\n“The problem with human beings is that they're emotional, and they tend to want more when something is going up and less when it's going down,” he said. “They zig when they should zag, and vice-versa.”\n\nHe added that U.S.-index ETFs have outperformed largely because of banner runs by mega-cap technology stocks such as Apple Inc. (Nasdaq:AAPL), Nvidia Corp. (Nasdaq:NVDA) and Amazon.com Inc. (Nasdaq:AMZN).\n\n“People's enthusiasm for the U.S. stock market and U.S. stocks is perhaps a little too enthusiastic,” he said.\n\n“People should be diversified into other areas and not just be overweight in the big tech stocks that have been driving the U.S. market.”\n\nDespite that sentiment, he told BIV that he was not predicting that the TSX would outperform American stock markets next year.\n\nTrump tariffs, deregulation and 2025\n\nLeith said the darkest cloud hovering above Canadian stock markets in 2025 is the potential that President-Elect Donald Trump will levy tariffs on imports from Canada.\n\nTrump recently threatened a blanket 25-per-cent tariff on Canadian goods unless the country stopped drugs and migrants from entering the U.S. illegally.\n\nCanadian stocks immediately declined but soon recovered.\n\n“The market is discounting the potential of tariffs and not saying that it is a real potential challenge,” said Leith Wheeler Investment Council CEO and managing partner Jim Gilliland.\n\nThere are other ways a Trump presidency could impact stock markets.\n\nGilliland said Trump has promised to chop regulations in sectors such as banking, which would help the U.S. financial sector, including Canadian banks that do business in the U.S.\n\nWhether calls for Ottawa to deregulate the Canadian banking sector will materialize in 2025 is unknown, he said.\n\nGilliland said he thinks investors in the TSX, which is heavily weighted with financial stocks, are not yet pricing in a potential benefit from Canadian banking deregulation.\n\n“Regulatory compliance has ballooned over the last 15 years and these things kind of work like pendulums. The last 15 years has been an increased regulatory environment, and we might start seeing a reduced one,” he said.\n\nAnother stimulus for the TSX could come, ironically, if Trump levies tariffs on Canada.\n\nLeith, Gilliland and others, such as Thane Stenner, a senior portfolio manager at CG Wealth Management’s Stenner Wealth Partners, all agreed that a consequence of U.S. tariffs on Canada would likely be a weaker Canadian dollar.\n\nThane Stenner, a senior portfolio manager at CG Wealth Management’s Stenner Wealth Partners, believes mining companies are in the early innings of a bull run | Rob Kruyt \n\nCompanies’ assets would hold their values, but it would take more Canadian dollars to reach those values. Inflated corporate-asset valuations would then find its way into the companies’ stock prices, they said.\n\n“This would be especially true for companies that export, but there would be an initial hit [to stock prices] first” Stenner said, adding that the increase in corporate valuations may take a year or two.\n\n“The other thing that would really be a strong trend is that there would be a lot of American companies buying and taking over Canadian ones with mergers and acquisitions,” he said.\n\nStenner said that when the Canadian dollar was worth less than US$0.70 in the 1990s and aught years, there was a “tremendous amount of takeover activity.”\n\nHe, like Leith and Gilliland and Yu, said the Canadian dollar could easily trade in the US$0.65-to-US$0.70 range in the next year.\n\nStenner, who told BIV that his company manages more than $1 billion in client assets, and who specializes in managing portfolios for ultra-high-net-worth individuals, said he has been increasing his exposure to mining companies and to those ventures that produce various commodities.\n\n“We think we're in early innings of a bull market in commodities,” he said.\n\nCopper, lithium, cobalt, uranium, precious metals and rare-earth metals are some of the metals and commodities he is tracking.\n\nHe has been bullish on stocks exposed to artificial intelligence for years but has become “very cautious\" on that niche sector because share prices have rapidly appreciated.\n\n“I do not know how to assess Bitcoin,” he said of the cryptocurrency that earlier this month surpassed US$100,000 per unit for the first time.\n\n“I don't know how to objectively, truly understand its use over time.”\n\nHe said that he has held a “decent” amount of Bitcoin exposure for clients and that he favours selling between 50 per cent and 70 per cent of those positions now given the cryptocurrency’s recent spike in valuation.\n\nHis experience in 2024 has been at times to hold as much as 60 per cent of his clients’ capital in cash.\n\n“We’ve been very active,” he said. “We’ve been moving things around quite a bit.”\n\nThe S&P 500’s holdings are weighted by market capitalization so larger companies comprise larger slices of the index.\n\nStenner said that his performance in recent years has beaten a formulation of the S&P 500 index that weighs all 500 stocks equally and is hedged to the Canadian dollar.\n\nThe ticker symbol for one ETF that tracks that benchmark is TSX:EQL-F. It was up a little more than 13 per cent so far this year until yesterday.","summary":"Year in Review: Indices have in recent years outperformed Vancouver real estate, other investments","url":"https://www.biv.com/news/economy-law-politics/can-stock-markets-sustain-2024-bull-run-into-2025-9971240","image":"https://www.vmcdn.ca/f/files/biv/murray-leith-rk.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-12-19 00:00:00","author":"Glen Korstrom","authors":["Glen Korstrom"],"language":"en","source_country":"ca","sentiment":0.035},{"id":274381400,"title":"India moves to guard against Trump’s likely tariff strike","text":"New Delhi: India has begun a detailed sector-wise analysis, drawing up multiple scenarios, to prepare for a possible increase in tariffs on product exports to the United States under the Donald Trump administration, multiple people familiar with the matter told ET. “Ministries and departments are examining various scenarios, apprehending such a move by the US and possible remedies,” one of the persons said.President-elect Trump on Tuesday had said the US will impose reciprocal tariffs on Indian goods because New Delhi imposes high tariffs on American goods. Independent experts said India could relook at import duty on specific products and enhance market access for certain imports from the US to address Trump’s concerns. The US has in the past raised issues on high import duty on Harley Davidson and limited market access to medical devices and equipment as well as its dairy products into India.116449242Addressing US ConcernsOfficials maintain that India’s most favoured nation (MFN)-weighted average import tariff is quite low at about 5-6%. Select agricultural products faced higher tariffs, but even those are much lower than the rates bound at the World Trade Organization (WTO). Most countries, including the US, apply high tariffs as well as several non-tariff barriers on agri goods, they said. For example, dairy products, fruits and vegetables, cereals and food preparations, and oils face tariffs as high as 130- 190% in the US. Another person said any firm assessment of impact or measures needed can be made only after a concrete announcement by the Trump administration, which will take charge on January 20. Experts said New Delhi also has the option of imposing retaliatory tariffs or approaching the WTO even as they suggested a strategic approach.116449257“There is no harm in relooking at some of the products on which India can tweak tariffs to address the concerns of the US,” said one of the experts who did not wish to be identified due to the sensitivity of the matter. While tariffs are WTO-bound or linked to MFN status between nations and not country-specific, there is a view that a calibrated approach can be adopted when looking at the list of products traded between India and the US. “It is not possible for India to have country specific tariffs because it violates most-favoured nation (MFN) principle,” said Ajay Sahai, director general of Federation of Indian Export Organisations (FIEO). Tariff reviewSahai is of the view that India can relook at some of the tariff lines and strategise accordingly even if it means a marginal duty loss to the nation on some of the products.","summary":"India is analyzing potential impacts and preparing for possible US tariff increases under the Trump administration.
