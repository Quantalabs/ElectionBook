Fannie and Freddie common stock both sank around 10% in Friday trading to the lowest intraday levels since late November, with Fannie falling for a fifth day and Freddie down for a seventh day. Both stocks have tumbled more than 40% from peaks reached in September, but still remain up over 60% from year-ago levels. Optimism about upcoming IPOs had fueled notable 2025 gains for the two companies, which have been under Washington’s control since the financial crisis. Momentum crested after word in August that the administration was contemplating an IPO that could value the enterprises at around $500 billion or more, involving selling 5% to 15% of their stock to raise about $30 billion. Recent proposals including requiring Fannie and Freddie to purchase mortgage bonds and remarks casting doubt on an offering anytime soon have further damped that optimism. For Matthew Aks at Evercore ISI, the “IPO dead” narrative is getting a lot of attention but it’s not the full story.“I have heard some anecdotes of people who have been in this trade for a year and are up a good bit already just deciding now is the time to take profits and get out,” the strategist said. He still sees a path forward for the investors, which he described as “not quite full IPO but still a way where there is more upside.”In recent weeks, investors have been assessing a slew of housing-linked proposals from Trump, including directing Fannie and Freddie to purchase $200 billion in mortgage bonds, a move he cast as part of an effort to bring down housing costs. There is also speculation about what the president may say regarding housing next week at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. Trump’s mortgage-bond directive “adds risk to the balance sheet in the event of future losses,” JPMorgan global economist Joseph Lupton writes in a note. “To the extent the administration has talked in the past about letting the GSEs go private, levering them up in this way could delay their release from government control,” he said, referring to Fannie and Freddie as government-sponsored enterprises.On Thursday, Federal Housing Finance Agency Director Bill Pulte hailed Trump’s decision not to sell the mortgage-finance companies during his first term. “Thanks to President Trump’s decision to not sell these companies for $100 billion in his first term, Fannie and Freddie are getting stronger every day,” he wrote in a post. Earlier this month, Pulte had said Trump would decide on the next steps for the IPOs of Fannie and Freddie in the next month or two.More stories like this are available on bloomberg.com©2026 Bloomberg L.P.","url":"https://www.livemint.com/market/fannie-freddie-stock-woes-deepen-as-ipo-questions-mount-11768591164571.html","image":"https://www.livemint.com/lm-img/img/2024/12/06/1600x900/logo/market_4_1733466069237_1733466076549.png","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-17 19:19:24","author":"List.metadata.agency","authors":["List.metadata.agency"],"language":"en","source_country":"in","sentiment":-0.175},{"id":393634004,"title":"Canada Inks Trade Deal With China in Break From Trump Agenda","text":"China and Canada reached a wide-ranging agreement to lower trade barriers and rebuild ties, signaling a pivot in Canadian foreign policy and a break from alignment with President Donald Trump’s trade agenda.Prime Minister Mark Carney said he expects China to cut tariffs on Canadian rapeseed, also known as canola, after meeting Chinese leader Xi Jinping on Friday, in the first visit by a Canadian leader to Beijing in eight years. In tandem, Canada will allow 49,000 Chinese electric vehicles into its market at a tariff rate of about 6%, down from the current rate of 100%. China will also offer visa-free travel to Canadians, Carney said. The moves marked a sharp reversal from the era of former Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. Under the previous administration, ties between Canada and China all but collapsed following the 2018 extradition spat involving a senior Huawei executive.China’s subsequent detention of two Canadians and years of retaliatory trade measures turned the relationship into a deep freeze. Now, Carney’s warming to Xi suggests a new strategic direction for a nation long considered Washington’s closest partner.“If this marks a genuine about-face for Canada and not just another reactionary flip-flop then we should acknowledge it as a possible inflection point,” said Josef Gregory Mahoney, a professor of international relations at Shanghai’s East China Normal University.The centerpieces of the agreement are tariff concessions. Carney anticipates a drop in canola tariffs from more than 80% to about 15% combined by March 1, citing “a high degree of confidence that that’s going to happen.”Following the announcement, canola futures in New York extended gains to 2.6%, reaching their highest level since early December, before paring gains. Traders see more demand from Canada’s second-largest market.Carney also said Beijing will suspend anti-discrimination duties on other farm products. This includes canola meal and lobsters, with the suspension expected to last from March through at least the end of 2026.The reduction in electric vehicle tariffs is perhaps the most striking component of the deal. In 2024, Canada matched the Biden administration’s 100% levy to align with US trade policy, but Carney’s move suggests he will chart an independent course.The number of Chinese EVs being allowed at the lower tariff rate is small — it amounts to less than 3% of the Canadian vehicle market — but the decision still brought a negative reaction within Canada. “China now has a foothold in the Canadian market and will use it to their full advantage at the expense of Canadian workers,” Ontario Premier Doug Ford said.Carney hailed his strategic partnership with Xi, touting the importance of their ties in the face of a “new world order.” This was a veiled reference to the global instability caused by President Trump’s foreign policy swings and disruptive trade agenda.“I’m extremely pleased that we are moving ahead with our new strategic partnership,” Carney told Xi on Friday. A day earlier, he told Chinese Premier Li Qiang that their strengthening relationship “sets us up well for the new world order.”Asked whether he still sees China as Canada’s top security threat at a press conference on Friday, Carney said the security landscape continues to change. The multilateral system has been eroded and it remains to be seen what gets built in its place, he added. Dylan Loh, an associate professor at Nanyang Technological University, called Carney’s comments an endorsement of China and an indictment of the US. “I won’t go so far as to say it’s a break with the US, but it will certainly displease Trump,” he said.But Trump’s public reaction wasn’t negative. “That’s OK, that’s what he should be doing,” the president said of Carney at the White House on Friday afternoon. “It’s a good thing for him to sign a trade deal. If you can get a deal with China you should do that.”USMCA ReviewThe detente between Canada and China comes in the midst of Trump’s trade war that has seen the US put tariffs on goods from American allies and adversaries alike. At the same time, the president has brought Russia’s Vladimir Putin out of isolation, stunned the world by deposing Venezuela’s leader and made invasion threats toward Greenland, a semi-autonomous territory of NATO member Denmark.Carney’s trip overseas is happening just as Canada and Mexico gear up for difficult negotiations with Trump on the North American free trade pact known as USMCA. US officials have put pressure on its neighbors to erect barriers to Chinese products ahead of those talks. “The threat against Greenland is a threat against Canada,” Mahoney added. He suggested that by drawing closer to China, Carney may be looking for leverage to use in the talks with Washington.Carney, who frequently talks about the Canada-US relationship as having suffered a historic “rupture,” called for a new approach to China, “adapted to new global realities,” in his meeting with Xi.Xi expressed optimism, noting “positive results” in restoring ties.“The healthy and stable development of China-Canada relations serves the common interests of our two countries and is also conducive to world peace, stability and prosperity,” he said.A joint statement released by both governments says that they will expand trade, strengthen investment and deepen cooperation in various fields, including energy, finance, public security and people-to-people exchange.Canada reaffirmed its commitment to its long-standing One-China Policy, according to the statement. Under that approach, Canada recognizes the People’s Republic as the sole legitimate government of China without endorsing or challenging the Chinese position on Taiwan, the self-ruled democracy claimed by Beijing.Despite the warming tone, Carney is walking a fine line. Vina Nadjibulla of the Asia Pacific Foundation of Canada described the visit as a move toward a “pragmatic foreign policy” that focuses on economics while deprioritizing traditional irritants.“He wants to engage selectively,” Nadjibulla told Bloomberg Television. The focus is on laying foundations for economic and trade relations, while keeping certain sectors like defense and artificial intelligence behind strict guardrails, she added. Carney is among a stream of leaders including the UK’s Keir Starmer and Germany’s Friedrich Merz making trips to Beijing early this year to rebuild ties after the US and China stabilized relations with a trade truce.Speaking to reporters on Thursday, Canadian Industry Minister Melanie Joly, who as foreign minister in 2022 labeled China an “increasingly disruptive global power,” said the goal now is to bring stability to the relationship between the two nations.“You know what? The conversations here have been more predictable and stable than sometimes with other countries, including our neighbor,” she said.

While Machado met with US President Donald Trump in Washington on Thursday, the visit went off with little fanfare, no joint press conference and scant official photos. During the visit, she also gifted him her recent Nobel Peace Prize medal, drawing mixed reactions from supporters. Trump described her as a “wonderful woman who has been through so much,” but didn’t indicate she should lead a transition to democracy in the country. She was warmly greeted by members of the Venezuelan community in Washington afterward. Just a day earlier, Trump touted a “very good” phone call he had with Delcy Rodriguez, vice president under Maduro who is currently leading the Venezuelan government.Venezuelans in Doral quickly took to the streets on Jan. 3 to celebrate the downfall of Nicolas Maduro, after a US military operation snatched him from his home in Caracas along with his wife to face trial on charges in New York.More stories like this are available on bloomberg.com©2026 Bloomberg L.P.","url":"https://www.livemint.com/politics/venezuela-diaspora-in-miami-names-road-for-opposition-s-machado-11768589685245.html","image":"https://www.livemint.com/lm-img/img/2026/01/16/1600x900/logo/Politics_1545994646567_1768589687293.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-17 18:54:44","author":"List.metadata.agency","authors":["List.metadata.agency"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"in","sentiment":0.217},{"id":393633980,"title":"Why did Maria Machado present her Nobel Peace Prize medal to Donald Trump? She explains","text":"Venezuelan opposition leader Maria Corina Machado, 58, who remains confident of becoming president “when the right time comes\", even as she has been sidelined by the United States following the overthrow of Nicolas Maduro, presented her Nobel Peace Prize medal to President Donald Trump on Thursday.Trump had strongly pushed to receive last year’s Nobel Peace Prize, citing his role in ending eight wars. However, the award was instead given to Maria Corina Machado, who traveled to Oslo last month to accept it after making a daring escape from Venezuela by boat. It remains unclear whether Trump retained the medal after their White House meeting, and the Norwegian Nobel Committee has stated that the prize cannot be transferred.In contrast, Machado, who spent years campaigning to bring an end to Maduro’s rule, received a rousing welcome from cheering supporters in Washington.Machado says Trump ‘deserves’ it“He deserves it. And it was a very emotional moment, I decided to present the Nobel Peace Prize medal on behalf of the people of Venezuela,\" Machado stated, according to AFP.She said she was confident that Venezuela would see a smooth transition following the US overthrow of Maduro and that free and fair elections would ultimately be held. Machado also told a press conference, a day after presenting her Nobel Peace Prize medal to Trump, that she insisted in her meeting with him on returning to Venezuela as soon as possible, according to Reuters.During an event in Washington, she mentioned, “We are definitely now into the first steps of a true transition to democracy”, stating that this will have an “immense impact in the lives of all Venezuelans”, including around the region and world, as per AFP.Meanwhile, Trump and acting President Delcy Rodriguez held their first phone conversation on Wednesday, after which the White House said he \"likes what he's seeing\" from her. Rodriguez, however, made it clear that her administration would push back against Washington.\"We know they are very powerful... we are not afraid to confront them diplomatically, through political dialogue,\" she said on Thursday.She was delivering Nicolas Maduro’s state of the nation address in parliament at the time, as the long-time authoritarian leader remains jailed in New York on drug trafficking charges.","url":"https://www.livemint.com/news/us-news/why-did-venezuelan-maria-machado-present-her-nobel-peace-prize-medal-to-donald-trump-she-explains-11768585866742.html","image":"https://www.livemint.com/lm-img/img/2026/01/16/1600x900/logo/US_1768588564870_1768588565027.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-17 18:41:48","author":"Garvit Bhirani","authors":["Garvit Bhirani"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"in","sentiment":0.099},{"id":393688886,"title":"US air authority warns of &#8216;military activities&#8217; over Mexico, Central America","text":"Latest News\n\nInternational News\n\nNorth & East\n\nEnvironment\n\nSocial Love\n\nHorse Racing\n\nWorld Champs\n\nCommonwealth Games\n\nFIFA World Cup 2022\n\nEntertainment\n\nArt & Culture\n\nTuesday Style\n\nFood Awards\n\nJOL Takes Style Out\n\nDesign Week JA\n\nBlack Friday\n\nRelationships\n\nClassifieds\n\nMotor Vehicles\n\nPlace an Ad\n\nJobs & Careers\n\nStudy Centre\n\nJnr Study Centre\n\nAdvertorial\n\nSupplements\n\n\n\nLatest News\n\nInternational News\n\nNorth & East\n\nEnvironment\n\nSocial Love\n\nHorse Racing\n\nWorld Champs\n\nCommonwealth Games\n\nFIFA World Cup 2022\n\nEntertainment\n\nArt & Culture\n\nTuesday Style\n\nFood Awards\n\nJOL Takes Style Out\n\nDesign Week JA\n\nBlack Friday\n\nRelationships\n\nClassifieds\n\nMotor Vehicles\n\nPlace an Ad\n\nJobs & Careers\n\nStudy Centre\n\nJnr Study Centre\n\nAdvertorial\n\nSupplements\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInternational News\n\nFood Awards\n\nEntertainment\n\nWorld Champs\n\nCareer & Education\n\nEnvironment\n\nAdvertorial\n\nSupplements\n\nClassifieds\n\nDesign Week\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNEW YORK, NEW YORK - SEPTEMBER 23: U.S. President Donald Trump speaks to the 80th session of the UN’s General Assembly (UNGA) at UN Headquarters on September 23, 2025 in New York City.

(Photo by Ronaldo SCHEMIDT / AFP) \n\n International News, Latest News \n\nJanuary 16, 2026\n\n\n\n\n Spanish singer Julio Iglesias says abuse allegations ‘absolutely false’ \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMADRID, Spain (AFP)—Spain’s veteran singer and cultural icon Julio Iglesias on Friday rejected allegations of abuse lodged against him by two women ex-employees, in a case that has dominated headlines.\n\n“I deny having abused, coerced, or disrespected any woman. These accusations are absolutely false and deeply sadden me,” the 82-year-old wrote on his Instagram account.\n\nIglesias, one of the most successful Latin artists of all time, is a Grammy winner with more than 300 million records sold in a career spanning decades.\n\nTwo women — a domestic worker and a physiotherapist — alleged they suffered sexual and other forms of abuse while working at Iglesias’s properties in the Dominican Republic and the Bahamas in 2021.\n\nAdvocacy groups Women’s Link Worldwide and Amnesty International said a complaint filed with Spanish prosecutors on January 5 outlined alleged acts that could be considered “a crime of human trafficking for the purpose of forced labour” and “crimes against sexual freedom”.\n\nIglesias subjected them to “sexual harassment, regularly checked their mobile phones, restricted their ability to leave the home where they worked, and required them to work up to 16 hours a day without days off”, according to testimony collected by the two groups.\n\nIn the message posted on Instagram, Iglesias wrote: “It is with profound sadness that I respond to the accusations made by two people who previously worked for me.”\n\n“I have never felt such malice, but I still have the strength to let people know the whole truth and to defend my dignity against such a serious accusation,” he said, thanking the “so many dear people” who have sent him messages of support.\n\nThe allegations against the beloved crooner have sparked strong reactions in Spain, with members of the leftist government backing the complainants and demanding that an investigation establishes the truth.\n\nThe head of the conservative opposition Popular Party, Alberto Nunez Feijoo, who is friends with Iglesias, told Telecinco television on Wednesday he was “very, very, very surprised” but urged against “speculating”.\n\nIglesias’s former manager Fernan Martinez told Telecinco that he was “very affectionate” and enjoyed “physical contact” but stressed he never saw the music icon “behave aggressively”.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTags: Julio Iglesias Sexual Assault Spanish singer \n\n\n\n\n\n\n {\"jamaica-observer\":\"Jamaica Observer\"} \n\n\n\n\n\n0 Comments ·

The result is Marc doesn’t play tomorrow for us.”\n\nThe Palace boss added: “When the players want to move on, a deal will happen. It looks like it has happened now.\n\n“Everyone wanted Marc to stay forever. I talked to him, of course, it stays between us. Marc showed it in the summer transfer window, showed it the whole autumn that he was 100 percent committed to the team and to Crystal Palace.\n\n“I wish him all the best for the rest of his career. He is still at the beginning of his great career. He is a fantastic guy.”\n\nCity manager Pep Guardiola stressed he had “nothing to say” about the potential transfer at his own press conference ahead of his side’s match at Manchester United.\n\nThe club are currently without senior centre-backs John Stones, Ruben Dias and Josko Gvardiol due to injury, while Nathan Ake has struggled to play more than once a week due to fitness issues.\n\nGuardiola, whose team are second in the Premier League, six points behind Arsenal, said the club were “in a difficult situation for not one game but a long, long period”, adding: “Ruben will be back soon. Josko, no. John, hopefully we’ll see.”\n\nCity are also still challenging for silverware in the Champions League, FA Cup and League Cup.\n\nGlasner also said Friday he would leave Palace when his own contract expired at the end of the season.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTags: Crystal Palace Manchester City Marc Guehi Transfer \n\n\n\n\n\n\n {\"jamaica-observer\":\"Jamaica Observer\"} \n\n\n\n\n\n0 Comments · Make a comment\n\n\n\n\n ALSO ON JAMAICA OBSERVER\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment, Latest News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Kranium’s Nobody Has to Know is now gold in the United Kingdom \n\n\n\n\n BY KEVIN JACKSON Observer Writer \n\n\n\nJanuary 16, 2026 \n\n\n After racking up a platinum certification in Canada in 2021 and gold in the United States in 2019, Nobody Has to Know , the breakthrough hit by singer... \n\n\n\n\n {\"jamaica-observer\":\"Jamaica Observer\"} \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLatest News, News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Individuals urged to have contracts in place ahead of home construction \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJanuary 16, 2026 \n\n\n KINGSTON, Jamaica— The Incorporated Masterbuilders Association of Jamaica (IMAJ) is calling on Jamaicans to ensure they have a formal written contract... \n\n\n\n\n {\"jamaica-observer\":\"Jamaica Observer\"} \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLatest News, Regional \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Trinidad PM makes ‘no apology’ for standing with US in fight against illegal drug trade \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJanuary 16, 2026 \n\n\n PORT OF SPAIN, Trinidad (CMC) — Trinidad and Tobago’s Prime Minister Kamla Persad-Bissessar on Friday said “no international law was breached” and she... \n\n\n\n\n {\"jamaica-observer\":\"Jamaica Observer\"} \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLatest News, Regional \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Bahamas opens globally recognised Category 5 hurricane shelter \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJanuary 16, 2026 \n\n\n NASSAU, Bahamas (CMC)–A climate-resilient hurricane shelter, able to withstand category five-level disasters and flagged as a global best practice, ha... \n\n\n\n\n {\"jamaica-observer\":\"Jamaica Observer\"} \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLatest News, Regional \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Belize monitoring outbreak of measles in neighbouring Guatemala \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJanuary 16, 2026 \n\n\n BELMOPAN, Belize (CMC) — Belizean health authorities Friday said they are monitoring an outbreak of measles in two neighbouring Central American count... \n\n\n\n\n {\"jamaica-observer\":\"Jamaica Observer\"} \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInternational News, Latest News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Trump says no reason ‘right now’ for Insurrection Act in Minnesota \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJanuary 16, 2026 \n\n\n WASHINGTON, United States (AFP)—US President Donald Trump said Friday there was no immediate need to invoke the Insurrection Act over protests against... \n\n\n\n\n {\"jamaica-observer\":\"Jamaica Observer\"} \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInternational, Latest News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Machado says Venezuela beginning ‘transition’ to democracy \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJanuary 16, 2026 \n\n\n WASHINGTON, United States (AFP) — Venezuelan Opposition Leader Maria Corina Machado said Friday her country is starting a \"true transition\" to democra... \n\n\n\n\n {\"jamaica-observer\":\"Jamaica Observer\"} \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHOUSE RULES\n\n\n\nWe welcome reader comments on the top stories of the day.

The certification commemorated sales and streaming figures exceeding 400,000 units.\n\nNobody Has to Know, which was released in 2013, scaled the Billboard’s Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Airplay chart in 2015, peaking at #44. The song was produced by Havendale raised Lamar ‘Lala’ Reynolds, a past student of Jamaica College.\n\nIn a previous interview with Observer Online, Kranium spoke about the success of Nobody Has to Know.\n\n“I mean, it’s been a good ride. Dancehall music, it works when it’s done properly, and sometimes it takes longer. It [the song’s success] just shows that if we support the music, these are the things that happen,” said Kranium.\n\nThe artiste shared that he knew the song would have been a hit.\n\n“I was 100 per cent sure that it would’ve been a hit. Some people do music for music, but I do music for a cause. I’m representing dancehall music overseas. When Nobody Has to Know came out, my dream was to make a song that a dancehall artiste can do from America. Not every song works, but I’ve never in my life focused on more than one song at a time,” Kranium disclosed.\n\nThe St James-born artiste whose real name is Kemar Donaldson, is the nephew of singjay Screwdriver, who had a hit song during the late 1980s with Sharon.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTags: gold certifications Kranium Nobody Has to Know \n\n\n\n\n\n\n {\"jamaica-observer\":\"Jamaica Observer\"} \n\n\n\n\n\n0 Comments · Make a comment\n\n\n\n\n ALSO ON JAMAICA OBSERVER\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLatest News, News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Individuals urged to have contracts in place ahead of home construction \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJanuary 16, 2026 \n\n\n KINGSTON, Jamaica— The Incorporated Masterbuilders Association of Jamaica (IMAJ) is calling on Jamaicans to ensure they have a formal written contract... \n\n\n\n\n {\"jamaica-observer\":\"Jamaica Observer\"} \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLatest News, Regional \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Trinidad PM makes ‘no apology’ for standing with US in fight against illegal drug trade \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJanuary 16, 2026 \n\n\n PORT OF SPAIN, Trinidad (CMC) — Trinidad and Tobago’s Prime Minister Kamla Persad-Bissessar on Friday said “no international law was breached” and she... \n\n\n\n\n {\"jamaica-observer\":\"Jamaica Observer\"} \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLatest News, Regional \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Bahamas opens globally recognised Category 5 hurricane shelter \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJanuary 16, 2026 \n\n\n NASSAU, Bahamas (CMC)–A climate-resilient hurricane shelter, able to withstand category five-level disasters and flagged as a global best practice, ha... \n\n\n\n\n {\"jamaica-observer\":\"Jamaica Observer\"} \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLatest News, Regional \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Belize monitoring outbreak of measles in neighbouring Guatemala \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJanuary 16, 2026 \n\n\n BELMOPAN, Belize (CMC) — Belizean health authorities Friday said they are monitoring an outbreak of measles in two neighbouring Central American count... \n\n\n\n\n {\"jamaica-observer\":\"Jamaica Observer\"} \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInternational News, Latest News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Trump says no reason ‘right now’ for Insurrection Act in Minnesota \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJanuary 16, 2026 \n\n\n WASHINGTON, United States (AFP)—US President Donald Trump said Friday there was no immediate need to invoke the Insurrection Act over protests against... \n\n\n\n\n {\"jamaica-observer\":\"Jamaica Observer\"} \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInternational, Latest News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Machado says Venezuela beginning ‘transition’ to democracy \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJanuary 16, 2026 \n\n\n WASHINGTON, United States (AFP) — Venezuelan Opposition Leader Maria Corina Machado said Friday her country is starting a \"true transition\" to democra... \n\n\n\n\n {\"jamaica-observer\":\"Jamaica Observer\"} \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLatest News, News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Bellevue Hospital warns of post-holiday depression spike \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJanuary 16, 2026 \n\n\n KINGSTON, Jamaica — With the holiday spirit fading, decorations coming down and lights dimming as the reality of the new year and returning to work se... \n\n\n\n\n {\"jamaica-observer\":\"Jamaica Observer\"} \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHOUSE RULES\n\n\n\nWe welcome reader comments on the top stories of the day.

(JIS photo) \n\n Latest News, News \n\nJanuary 16, 2026\n\n\n\n\n Individuals urged to have contracts in place ahead of home construction \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKINGSTON, Jamaica— The Incorporated Masterbuilders Association of Jamaica (IMAJ) is calling on Jamaicans to ensure they have a formal written contract in place before beginning any home construction, expansion or renovation project.\n\nPast president of the IMAJ, Lenworth Kelly, informed a recent JIS Think Tank that failing to have contracts in place continues to expose potential homeowners to significant financial and legal risks.\n\n“One of the challenges in the industry is that there’s no legislation that governs contractors… So, you have a lot of persons informally who say they are contractors and they’re accepted because they say they are – just on that basis,” he said.\n\nKelly stressed, further, that a contract is an essential first step once building plans and drawings are complete.\n\n“If you’re building a home, expanding, or you’re buying, that’s probably the single largest investment you will make in your life with vast sums of money. Without a formal contract, that’s ridiculous,” he stated.\n\nBeyond having a contract, prospective homeowners are encouraged to engage qualified professionals who can act on their behalf.\n\n“Ask your designer, ask your engineer, ask your architect to act as the administrator on your behalf. So, they will come in and check monthly at milestones and approve for payment,” noted Kelly.\n\nHe highlighted, further, that common issues reported to the IMAJ often involve homeowners who failed to take basic precautions before they begin.\n\n“Do you have a contract? Have you checked the background of this person? What’s their track record? Are they registered with the Company’s Office of Jamaica? How long have they been in business?” he asked.\n\n“You have a responsibility when you are going to build; you have a responsibility to be very diligent,” Kelly continued.\n\nEven small projects should include a written agreement of some kind.\n\n“Even if you’re building a fowl coop, write something on a book leaf. Say, ‘we agreed to pay you X. We’re going to pay you Y’ and put your timelines in there. It’s a contract still. The courts will recognise it,” Kelly said.\n\nTo support homeowners, especially those planning to build or expand their homes, the IMAJ provides direct access to its in‑house consultant.\n\n“The IMAJ has an in-house consultant that’s available to the public on Tuesdays and Thursdays to advise, particularly for homeowners who want to build a little house, you want to expand it and so on,” Kelly said.\n\n“You call the IMAJ offices, you can do a Zoom call, or you can go in and sit with the consultant. We make that available to the public free of cost to give you direction,” he added.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTags: Contract home construction Incorporated Masterbuilders Association of Jamaica \n\n\n\n\n\n\n {\"jamaica-observer\":\"Jamaica Observer\"} \n\n\n\n\n\n0 Comments · Make a comment\n\n\n\n\n ALSO ON JAMAICA OBSERVER\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLatest News, Regional \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Trinidad PM makes ‘no apology’ for standing with US in fight against illegal drug trade \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJanuary 16, 2026 \n\n\n PORT OF SPAIN, Trinidad (CMC) — Trinidad and Tobago’s Prime Minister Kamla Persad-Bissessar on Friday said “no international law was breached” and she... \n\n\n\n\n {\"jamaica-observer\":\"Jamaica Observer\"} \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLatest News, Regional \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Bahamas opens globally recognised Category 5 hurricane shelter \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJanuary 16, 2026 \n\n\n NASSAU, Bahamas (CMC)–A climate-resilient hurricane shelter, able to withstand category five-level disasters and flagged as a global best practice, ha... \n\n\n\n\n {\"jamaica-observer\":\"Jamaica Observer\"} \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLatest News, Regional \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Belize monitoring outbreak of measles in neighbouring Guatemala \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJanuary 16, 2026 \n\n\n BELMOPAN, Belize (CMC) — Belizean health authorities Friday said they are monitoring an outbreak of measles in two neighbouring Central American count... \n\n\n\n\n {\"jamaica-observer\":\"Jamaica Observer\"} \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInternational News, Latest News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Trump says no reason ‘right now’ for Insurrection Act in Minnesota \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJanuary 16, 2026 \n\n\n WASHINGTON, United States (AFP)—US President Donald Trump said Friday there was no immediate need to invoke the Insurrection Act over protests against... \n\n\n\n\n {\"jamaica-observer\":\"Jamaica Observer\"} \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInternational, Latest News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Machado says Venezuela beginning ‘transition’ to democracy \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJanuary 16, 2026 \n\n\n WASHINGTON, United States (AFP) — Venezuelan Opposition Leader Maria Corina Machado said Friday her country is starting a \"true transition\" to democra... \n\n\n\n\n {\"jamaica-observer\":\"Jamaica Observer\"} \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLatest News, News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Bellevue Hospital warns of post-holiday depression spike \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJanuary 16, 2026 \n\n\n KINGSTON, Jamaica — With the holiday spirit fading, decorations coming down and lights dimming as the reality of the new year and returning to work se... \n\n\n\n\n {\"jamaica-observer\":\"Jamaica Observer\"} \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInternational, Latest News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n OpenAI introducing ads to ChatGPT \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJanuary 16, 2026 \n\n\n SAN FRANCISCO, United States (AFP) — OpenAI announced Friday it will begin testing advertisements on ChatGPT in the coming weeks, as the wildly popula... \n\n\n\n\n {\"jamaica-observer\":\"Jamaica Observer\"} \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHOUSE RULES\n\n\n\nWe welcome reader comments on the top stories of the day.

I make no apology today and I am happy,” Persad-Bissessar said as she outlined the achievements of her administration since coming to office in April last year and the legislative agenda for 2026.\n\nIn an apparent reference to the Opposition benches, she said, “If you had some good lawyers, we have some very good ones, including the Attorney General (John Jeremie), they will tell you that there was no international law that was breached when we were taking out people…in their boats, trafficking, human trafficking, drugs, children.”\n\n“Transnational crime, that is what we were fighting and we make no apology today,” she said to desk thumping and loud applause from the members of her government.\n\n“Find a good lawyer because we have the legal opinions on this matter and again we make no apology for it. In any event, I remember right here in this Parliament…a member on this side (now Opposition) say what (US President Donald) Trump going to do we…Well, we now finding out what Trump did us and what they could do. They are finding out, very disrespectful,” she added.\n\nInternational observers had claimed that Trumps war on drugs in the Caribbean was intended at regime change in Venezuela, and earlier this month, US military invaded the South American country, detaining its leader, Nicolas Maduro and his wife, and transporting them to New York where they now face drugs-related charges.\n\nTrump has since said Washington will “run” Venezuela.\n\nLast October, the United Nations Human Rights Chief, Volker Türk, condemned US military strikes on vessels allegedly carrying drugs in the Caribbean and Pacific, saying the lethal attacks violate international law and amount to “extrajudicial killing”.\n\nTürk, calling the attacks “unacceptable”, said Washington must halt them immediately and conduct prompt, independent and transparent investigations.\n\nPresident Trump has said the strikes are necessary to stem the flow of drugs into the US. Türk, while acknowledging the challenges of tackling drug trafficking, said in a statement that the circumstances for the deadly strikes “find no justification in international law”.\n\n“Countering the serious issue of illicit trafficking of drugs across international borders is — as has long been agreed among states — a law-enforcement matter, governed by the careful limits on lethal force set out in international human rights law.”\n\nUnder law, the intentional use of lethal force “is only permissible as a last resort against individuals who pose an imminent threat to life”, he said, adding that based on “very sparse information provided publicly by the US authorities, none of the individuals on the targeted boats appeared to pose an imminent threat to lives of others”.\n\nHe called on Washington to use law enforcement methods including intercepting boats and detaining suspects, and if necessary, prosecuting individuals.\n\nDuring her statement to Parliament, Prime Minister Persad-Bissessar thanked her Jamaican counterpart Andrew Holness, for assisting Port of Spain as the country moves to follow Kingston and introduce zones of special operations (ZOSOs), as the country seeks to take advantage of the reduction in murders and other crimes during a state of emergency (SOE) that is expected to end this month.\n\nJamaica established ZOSOs under the 2017 Special Security and Community Development Measures Act, to tackle high crime in specific areas through enhanced security and community development. They are regularly extended by Parliament.\n\n“We have spoken personally and I ask for him (Holness) to share with us what they were doing with the special zones and our Minister of Homeland Security (Roger Alexander) visited Jamaica in fact and spent time there with their police force,” Persad-Bissessar said.\n\nShe said upon Alexander’s return, discussions were held, culminating in the introduction of the ZOSO legislation, which will be debated on Friday.\n\n“So we remain focused as a priority on safety and security. We remain focused against transnational organised crime,” she added.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTags: Drugs Trinidad US \n\n\n\n\n\n\n {\"jamaica-observer\":\"Jamaica Observer\"} \n\n\n\n\n\n0 Comments · Make a comment\n\n\n\n\n ALSO ON JAMAICA OBSERVER\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLatest News, Regional \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Bahamas opens globally recognised Category 5 hurricane shelter \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJanuary 16, 2026 \n\n\n NASSAU, Bahamas (CMC)–A climate-resilient hurricane shelter, able to withstand category five-level disasters and flagged as a global best practice, ha... \n\n\n\n\n {\"jamaica-observer\":\"Jamaica Observer\"} \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLatest News, Regional \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Belize monitoring outbreak of measles in neighbouring Guatemala \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJanuary 16, 2026 \n\n\n BELMOPAN, Belize (CMC) — Belizean health authorities Friday said they are monitoring an outbreak of measles in two neighbouring Central American count... \n\n\n\n\n {\"jamaica-observer\":\"Jamaica Observer\"} \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInternational News, Latest News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Trump says no reason ‘right now’ for Insurrection Act in Minnesota \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJanuary 16, 2026 \n\n\n WASHINGTON, United States (AFP)—US President Donald Trump said Friday there was no immediate need to invoke the Insurrection Act over protests against... \n\n\n\n\n {\"jamaica-observer\":\"Jamaica Observer\"} \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInternational, Latest News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Machado says Venezuela beginning ‘transition’ to democracy \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJanuary 16, 2026 \n\n\n WASHINGTON, United States (AFP) — Venezuelan Opposition Leader Maria Corina Machado said Friday her country is starting a \"true transition\" to democra... \n\n\n\n\n {\"jamaica-observer\":\"Jamaica Observer\"} \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLatest News, News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Bellevue Hospital warns of post-holiday depression spike \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJanuary 16, 2026 \n\n\n KINGSTON, Jamaica — With the holiday spirit fading, decorations coming down and lights dimming as the reality of the new year and returning to work se... \n\n\n\n\n {\"jamaica-observer\":\"Jamaica Observer\"} \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInternational, Latest News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n OpenAI introducing ads to ChatGPT \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJanuary 16, 2026 \n\n\n SAN FRANCISCO, United States (AFP) — OpenAI announced Friday it will begin testing advertisements on ChatGPT in the coming weeks, as the wildly popula... \n\n\n\n\n {\"jamaica-observer\":\"Jamaica Observer\"} \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInternational, Latest News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n X, formerly Twitter, services restored \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJanuary 16, 2026 \n\n\n X, formerly Twitter, services have been restored after the platform appeared to have suffered a major outage on Friday.

In an Oval Office exchange with reporters following the talks, he reiterated his commitment to acquiring the territory. “We need Greenland for national security,” Trump said. He added: “We’ll see how it all works out. I think something will work out.”\n\nDanish Foreign Minister Lars Løkke Rasmussen said, “It is in everybody’s interest — even though we disagree — that we agree to try to explore whether it is doable to accommodate some of the concerns while at the same time respecting the integrity of the Danish kingdom’s territory and the self-determination of the Greenlandic people.”\n\nGreenland, the world’s largest island, is about 80% ice capped. The Inuit came to Greenland from North America in a series of migrations that stretched from 2500 B.C. to the 11th century. Vikings reached the island in the 10th century from Iceland; Danish colonization began in the 18th century, and Greenland became part of the Kingdom of Denmark in 1953.\n\nIt joined the European Community (now the EU) with Denmark in 1973 but withdrew in 1985 over a dispute centered on stringent fishing quotas. Greenland remains a member of the EU’s Overseas Countries and Territories Association.\n\nThe Danish parliament granted Greenland home rule in 1979; the law went into effect the following year. Greenland voted in favor of self-government in 2008 and acquired greater responsibility for internal affairs when the Act on Greenland Self-Government was signed into law in 2009. The Kingdom of Denmark, however, continues to exercise control over several policy areas on behalf of Greenland, including foreign affairs, security,and financial policy, in consultation with Greenland’s Self-Rule Government.\n\nThe U.S. protected it\n\nFollowing the Nazi German occupation of Denmark in World War II, Denmark signed an agreement with the U.S. to keep control of the Greenlandic territory in allied hands.

The DOJ did not respond to a request for comment.Amid the escalating row between Trump and Minnesota leaders this week, the president threatened the drastic measure that would have allowed him to deploy the military to police the protests.'If I needed it, I would use it. I don't think there is any reason right now to use it,' Trump told reporters at the White House when asked about the law that grants the deployment of soldiers on US soil.The Insurrection Act allows a president to sidestep the Posse Comitatus Act to suppress 'armed rebellion' or 'domestic violence' and use the armed forces 'as he considers necessary' to enforce the 19th-century law.Crowds of protesters have clashed with immigration officers across the city of Minneapolis, opposing their efforts to target undocumented migrants with some officers responding with violence.Demonstrations dramatically expanded following the killing of Renee Nicole Good, 37, by an Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officer in Minneapolis on January 7 as the Trump administration pressed operations to catch undocumented migrants.'Incitement of violence'Federal agents fired their weapons in two separate incidents, wounding a man from Venezuela Wednesday, and in Good's killing last week.Federal prosecutors also charged a man with stealing a rifle from an FBI vehicle and he is due in court Friday.US Attorney Daniel Rosen claimed that local officials were responsible for the 'incitement of violence against federal law enforcement... which resulted here in the theft of a firearm from an FBI vehicle.'A woman was roughly pulled from her car by officers Tuesday, an AFP correspondent saw, amid the escalating deployment of federal officers to the state.Proponents of immigration enforcement have also begun to face off with those who oppose it in the state, leading to tense encounters.The Minnesota Star Tribune newspaper reported that divisions within the anti-ICE movement were beginning to emerge over how aggressively to resist the enforcement efforts.Activists have also become increasingly wary of 'far-right provocateurs trying to bait demonstrators into rioting,' the publication reported.Minnesota's American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) chapter has reported an uptick in complaints against ICE officers.Democratic Minnesota Governor Tim Walz accused federal agents of waging 'a campaign of organized brutality against the people of Minnesota,' in a video posted to X Wednesday night.On Wednesday, the family of Good announced that they had retained a top law firm to probe the killing ahead of launching possible legal action against the officer and the government.The lawyers demanded Thursday that federal officials — including the officer who fired the shots that killed Good — preserve records and evidence relating to the incident.","url":"https://www.manilatimes.net/2026/01/17/world/americas-emea/trump-says-no-reason-right-now-for-insurrection-act-in-minnesota/2260590","image":"https://www.manilatimes.net/manilatimes/uploads/images/2026/01/17/902945.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-17 01:08:00","author":"Agence France-Presse","authors":["Agence France-Presse"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"ph","sentiment":-0.461},{"id":393695480,"title":"Trump issues a flurry of pardons, including for a woman whose sentence he commuted in his first term","text":"By WILL WEISSERT\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump issued a flurry of pardons in recent days, including for the father of a large donor to his super PAC, a former governor of Puerto Rico and a woman whose sentence he commuted during his first term but who ended up back in prison for a different scheme.\n\nTrump commuted the sentence of Adriana Camberos just before his first stint in the White House ended in 2021. That followed her being convicted as part of an effort to divert 5-Hour Energy drink bottles acquired for resale in Mexico and instead keep them in the U.S. Prosecutors said she and several co-conspirators attached counterfeit labels and filled the bottles with a phony liquid before selling them.\n\nIn 2024, she and her brother, Andres, were convicted in a separate case, this one involving lying to manufacturers to sell wholesale groceries and additional items at big discounts after pledging that they were meant for sale in Mexico or to prisoners or rehabilitation facilities. The siblings sold the products at higher prices to U.S. distributors, prosecutors said.\n\nThe Camberoses were among 13 pardons Trump issued Thursday, along with eight commutations. An additional pardon was announced Friday for Terren Peizer, a resident of Puerto Rico and California who headed the Miami-based health care company Ontrak.\n\nPeizer had been convicted and sentenced to 42 months in prison, and fined $5.25 million, for engaging in an insider trading scheme to avoid losses exceeding $12.5 million, according to the Justice Department.\n\nThe president has issued a number of clemencies during the first year of his second term, many targeted at criminal cases once touted by federal prosecutors. They’ve come amid a continuing Trump administration effort to erode public integrity guardrails — including the firing of the Justice Department’s pardon attorney.\n\nAlso pardoned this week was former Puerto Rico Gov. Wanda Vázquez, who had pleaded guilty last August to a campaign finance violation in a federal case that authorities say also involved a former FBI agent and a Venezuelan banker. Her sentencing had been set for later this month.\n\nFederal prosecutors had been seeking one year behind bars, something Vázquez’s attorneys opposed as they accused prosecutors of violating a guilty plea deal reached last year that saw previous charges including bribery and fraud dropped.\n\nThey had noted that Vázquez had agreed to plead guilty to accepting a promise of a campaign contribution that was never received.\n\nAlso involved in the case was banker Julio Herrera Velutini, whose daughter, Isabela Herrera, donated $2.5 million to Trump’s MAGA Inc. super PAC in 2024, and gave the group an additional $1 million last summer. The case’s third defendant was former FBI agent Mark Rossini, who was also pardoned by the president.\n\nThe recent wave of clemencies joins previous Trump pardons of Democratic former Illinois Gov. Rod Blagojevich and Republican ex-Connecticut Gov. John Rowland, whose promising political career was upended by a corruption scandal and two federal prison stints.\n\nTrump also pardoned former U.S. Rep. Michael Grimm, a New York Republican who resigned from Congress after a tax fraud conviction and made headlines for threatening to throw a reporter off a Capitol balcony over a question he didn’t like. Reality TV stars Todd and Julie Chrisley, who had been convicted of cheating banks and evading taxes, also got Trump pardons.\n\nThe president also pardoned Texas Democratic Rep. Henry Cuellar in a bribery and conspiracy case. He later expressed regret and frustration for having done so, however, when Cuellar announced he was seeking reelection without switching parties to become a Republican.","summary":"Many of the president's clemencies have been targeted at criminal cases touted by federal prosecutors.","url":"https://www.ocregister.com/2026/01/16/trump-pardons-flurry/","image":"https://www.ocregister.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Trump_22862.jpg?w=150&strip=all","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-17 01:05:00","author":"Associated Press,Gqlshare","authors":["Associated Press","Gqlshare"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.272},{"id":393695250,"title":"Trump issues a flurry of pardons, including for a woman whose sentence he commuted in his first term","text":"By WILL WEISSERT\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump issued a flurry of pardons in recent days, including for the father of a large donor to his super PAC, a former governor of Puerto Rico and a woman whose sentence he commuted during his first term but who ended up back in prison for a different scheme.","url":"https://www.baltimoresun.com/2026/01/16/trump-pardons-flurry/","image":"https://www.baltimoresun.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Trump_22862.jpg?w=1024&h=682","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-17 01:05:00","author":"Associated Press","authors":["Associated Press"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.102},{"id":393694968,"title":"\"They've Totally Lost Control\"; Trump Threatens 'Agitators' As Civil Unrest Soars In Minnesota","text":"Update: President Trump escalated his threat to use the Insurrection Act (as we detailed here) earlier today, warning that state and city officials \"have totally lost control.\"\n\nThe origin of the chaos appears to be mostly manufactured and began hours after the legal observer was shot and killed last Wednesday:\n\nMinneapolis ICE Shooting Shows Left Wing's Protest Industrial Complex Wants Another 'George Floyd'-Type RiotTim Walz Activates Emergency Operations Center, Alerts National Guard After ICE-Involved Shooting Sparks Protest Threat\n\nDemocrats are using the manufactured chaos, think of it as George Floyd 2.0, in an attempt to sway public opinion polls about Trump's deportation policies.

It's very powerful.\"\n💪🇺🇸👏pic.twitter.com/k1kzO8Bkay\n— Townhall.com (@townhallcom) January 16, 2026\n\nAs Michael Snyder detailed earlier via The Economic Collapse blog, what we have witnessed on the streets of Minneapolis this week has been absolutely stunning.\n\nIt was once such a beautiful city, but now it has been transformed into a war zone. For more than a decade, I have been relentlessly warning my readers that civil unrest would be one of the core elements of the coming “perfect storm”, and now we are literally watching violent clashes between radical leftists and federal authorities play out right in front of our eyes. In fact, it is getting so bad that President Trump is threatening to invoke the Insurrection Act. That hasn’t happened since the Los Angeles riots of 1992. If we keep going down this path, will we soon see martial law in major U.S. cities?\n\nIndependent journalist Nick Sortor is on the ground in Minneapolis, and last night he watched as rioters destroyed multiple federal law enforcement vehicles…\n\nMULTIPLE ICE and FBI vehicles have been DESTROYED and LOOTED by rioters in Minneapolis after federal agents were forced to abandon themAgents gear, laptops, and personal information now LITTERS the streetTHIS IS ABSOLUTE ANARCHY\n\nHe is right.\n\nIt is absolutely anarchy.\n\nSortor is also reporting that the rioters actually broke into a weapons locker in one of the vehicles and got away with a rifle and ammunition…\n\nMinneapolis rioters successfully BROKE OPEN a weapons locker in a federal vehicle and STOLE A RIFLE and ammunition before fleeingI captured the thief’s face and license plate on the getaway vehicle.\n\nA state of lawlessness exists on the streets of Minneapolis at this moment, and President Trump just threatened to invoke the Insurrection Act…\n\nAs the rioters were destroying and looting federal vehicles, the police just stood by and did nothing.\n\nOf course the reason why they didn’t intervene is because that is what their leaders are instructing them to do.\n\nIn remarks that she just made to the press, White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt explained that Trump’s threat to invoke the Insurrection Act “spoke very loud and clear to Democrats across this country”…\n\nWhite House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said Thursday that President Donald Trump’s threats to enact the Insurrection Act in Minnesota “spoke very loud and clear to Democrats across this country.” Leavitt said it send a message to elected officials “who are using their platforms to encourage violence against federal law enforcement officers who are encouraging left-wing agitators to unlawfully obstruct legitimate law enforcement operations.”\n\nOf course the Democrats are not going to back down.\n\nAnd neither will the Trump administration.\n\nSo I expect things to get really crazy in the months ahead.\n\nIf Trump actually invokes the Insurrection Act, that will allow him to deploy active duty soldiers to Minneapolis…\n\nThe president would have fairly broad authority under the law, Gene Rossi, a former federal prosecutor, told Newsweek on Thursday.“The punchline is this. Under the Insurrection Act, President Trump and any president has broad power to invoke that act, which is an extraordinary step,” he said. “What it means is that the president can employ active duty soldiers to assist state and local authorities in executing the federal laws.”In Minnesota, ICE is “executing, in their mind, the immigration laws in terms of arresting and detaining people who are here without proper documentation,” Rossi said. Trump would have broad authority to determine whether laws cannot be effectively executed without invoking the Insurrection Act, he said.\n\nIf troops are deployed in the streets, will far left radicals stop harassing ICE?\n\nOf course not.\n\nInstead, there would probably be even more violent confrontations like the one that we just witnessed on Wednesday evening…\n\nA U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agent is in the hospital after being ambushed during an attempt to arrest a Venezuelan national in Minneapolis on Wednesday evening, according to the Department of Homeland Security.The agent was ambushed by two people while attempting to conduct a traffic stop on an illegal immigrant from Venezuela, DHS said, adding that the agent fired his gun during the alleged attack because he was “fearing for his life and safety.”One Venezuelan suspect was shot but is reported to be stable and is now in custody, DHS said.\n\nThe radical left has drawn a line in the sand.\n\nThey are going to resist ICE no matter how much the Trump administration escalates matters.\n\nAnd so now our society stands at a very dangerous tipping point.\n\nAccording to a post by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security on Facebook, the ICE agent that is in the hospital got hurt when two men attacked him with “a snow shovel and a broom handle”…\n\nAt 6:50 PM CT, federal law enforcement officers were conducting a targeted traffic stop in Minneapolis of an illegal alien from Venezuela who was released into the country by Joe Biden in 2022.In an attempt to evade arrest, the subject fled the scene in his vehicle and crashed into a parked car. The subject then fled on foot.The law enforcement officer caught up to the subject on foot and attempted to apprehend him when the subject began to resist and violently assault the officer. While the subject and law enforcement were in a struggle on the ground, two subjects came out of a nearby apartment and also attacked the law enforcement officer with a snow shovel and broom handle.As the officer was being ambushed and attacked by the two individuals, the original subject got loose and began striking the officer with a shovel or broom stick.Fearing for his life and safety as he was being ambushed by three individuals, the officer fired a defensive shot to defend his life. The initial subject was hit in the leg.All three subjects ran back into the apartment and barricaded themselves inside.The attacked officer and subject are both in the hospital. Both attackers are in custody.This attack on another brave member of law enforcement took place while Minnesota’s top leaders, Governor Walz and Mayor Frey, are actively encouraging an organized resistance to ICE and federal law enforcement officers.Their hateful rhetoric and resistance against men and women who are simply trying to do their jobs must end. Federal law enforcement officers are facing a 1,300% increase in assaults against them as they put their lives on the line to arrest criminals and lawbreakers.\n\nIt would help if Democrats would tell their constituents to calm down and leave federal law enforcement officers alone.\n\nBut that isn’t happening.\n\nIn fact, Minnesota Governor Tim Walz is calling on the citizens of his state to “resist” the “occupation” that he believes is currently taking place…\n\nFolks, I know it’s scary, and I know it’s absurd that we all have to be defending law and order, justice, and humanity while also caring for our families and trying to do our jobs. So tonight, let me say once again to Donald Trump and Christine Noem: End this occupation, you’ve done enough.…Donald Trump wants this chaos. He wants confusion, and yes, he wants more violence on our streets. We cannot give him what he wants. We can, we must, protest loudly, urgently, but also peacefully.All across Minnesota, people are learning about opportunities, not just to resist, but to help people who are in danger. Thousands and thousands of our fellow Minnesotans are going to be relying on mutual aid in the days and weeks to come, and they need our support.\n\nTim Walz was a member of the National Guard for 24 years.\n\nWhen he uses military terminology, he knows exactly what he is doing.\n\nOn the other side, Stephen Miller is warning that federal officials are in the process of “identifying, disrupting and dismantling the insurgent networks” that are causing so much chaos in Minnesota…\n\nStephen Miller, a top White House official, said Tuesday evening that federal law enforcement now has the resources to protect its officers and begin the work of “identifying, disrupting and dismantling the insurgent networks” hampering Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) operations in Minnesota.\n\nThat sounds very similar to the terminology that many of our politicians would use regarding anti-insurgent operations in Iraq and Afghanistan under previous administrations.\n\nBut even if the violent radicals in Minnesota are successfully suppressed, more will just pop up elsewhere.\n\nPersonally, I believe that this is just the beginning of an enormous wave of civil unrest.\n\nAnd if a major war erupts in the Middle East, that will just add more fuel to the fire.\n\nThis year is already off to such a crazy start.\n\nAnd we are only halfway through the first month.\n\nUnfortunately, I believe that the rest of the year will be even more insane.\n\nMichael’s new book entitled “10 Prophetic Events That Are Coming Next” is available in paperback and for the Kindle on Amazon.com, and you can subscribe to his Substack newsletter at michaeltsnyder.substack.com.","url":"https://www.zerohedge.com/political/trump-warns-theyve-totally-lost-control-civil-unrest-soars-minnesota","image":"/s3/files/styles/16_9_max_700/public/2026-01/Snip20260115_69.jpg?itok=ejKxuVQD","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-17 01:05:00","author":"Tyler Durden","authors":["Tyler Durden"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.389},{"id":393694994,"title":"‘Authoritarian tactic’: Justice Department launches criminal probe into Minnesota governor","text":"Walz, reacting on social media to news of the investigation, said the justice system was being weaponised.\n\n“Weaponising the justice system against your opponents is an authoritarian tactic,” he said.

Mr Hassett has been seen as a top contender to succeed Fed Chair Jerome Powell. \n\n“I actually want to keep you where you are, if you want to know the truth,” Mr Trump told Mr Hassett during a White House event. “If I move him, these Fed guys – certainly the one we have now – they don’t talk much. I would lose you. It’s a serious concern to me.”\n\nAnalysts immediately speculated that Mr Trump’s remarks made \n\nMr Krishna Guha, head of central bank strategy at Evercore ISI, said in a note to clients the news would “catapult Warsh into pole position in the race to succeed Powell as Fed chair”.\n\nTreasury Secretary Scott Bessent said on Fox Business on Jan 17 that “only the president knows” who he will nominate after being asked about Mr Warsh’s prospects. “It’s his prerogative,” he said.\n\n“I have it, in my mind, done,” Mr Trump told reporters later on Jan 17 when asked if he had decided on a nominee. He declined to say which candidate he had chosen. \n\nThe dollar rebounded from session lows to trade modestly higher after Mr Trump’s initial remarks, while stocks turned negative. Prediction markets also responded immediately, raising the odds that Mr Warsh would win the nomination.\n\n“I believe the candidate who President Trump nominates will be confirmed quickly,” Mr Bessent said. “I think it will be someone who is substantial, who cares about the integrity of the Fed, cares about the dual mandate.”\n\nMr Bessent said the nominee will be someone who “markets will respect and world leaders will respect”.\n\nThe president’s effort to fill Fed vacancies is, however, facing obstacles in the Senate, which must confirm his nominees. Senator Thom Tillis of North Carolina, a key Republican on the Banking Committee, vowed to oppose any of the president’s picks until a Justice Department investigation into the Fed is resolved. \n\nThe president did not address that dispute in his Jan 17 comments, but indicated the selection process still was not settled. He has recently said he plans to announce his nominee for Fed chair in the next few weeks. \n\n“We don’t want to lose him,” Mr Trump said of Mr Hassett. “We’ll see how it all works out.”\n\nLate in 2025, Mr Hassett was seen by Trump advisers as the frontrunner for the job. But Mr Trump has continued to consider other candidates. \n\nIn an interview with Reuters earlier this week, Mr Trump suggested he was considering both Mr Hassett and Mr Warsh for the role, among others. \n\n“The two Kevins are very good,” Mr Trump said. “You have some other good people too.”\n\nBlackRock executive Rick Rieder on Jan 15 participated in a final interview for the role, Mr Bessent said on Fox Business.\n\nMr Powell’s term as head of the central bank ends on May 15. The search process is being led by Mr Bessent, who Mr Trump has said removed himself from consideration for the role.\n\nMr Trump’s search for a new Fed chair comes at a delicate time for monetary policymakers, as the US economy is pulling them in opposite directions. Employment showed signs of weakness in 2025, prompting officials to lower rates. Some at the Fed are calling for more cuts to bolster the jobs market.\n\nBut inflation also remains stubbornly above the central bank’s 2 per cent and several policymakers say it is time to hold rates steady to make sure policy puts downward pressure on inflation.\n\nA new Fed chair is expected to enter office seeking additional cuts, in line with Mr Trump’s wishes. But their ability to build consensus on the Fed’s rate-setting committee could prove difficult.\n\nThat would be further complicated if Mr Powell decides to stay on as a governor after his term as chair ends.

China \"has decided to present its candidature of the city of Xiamen to host the Secretariat\" of the treaty, the Chinese mission to the United Nations wrote in a letter to Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, according to a copy seen by AFP. The treaty will officially enter into force on Saturday, and the host country of the eventual secretariat will be decided later this year. Until now, Belgium and Chile had been vying to host the future organization. The Xiamen bid signals \"China's intention to help shape global rules,\" said Li Shuo, director of the China Climate Hub at the Asia Society Policy Institute in Washington, calling it a \"notable move.\" China's announcement came just days after US President Donald Trump announced his country will withdraw from 66 global organizations and treaties -- involving UN and non-UN entities. They include the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), the parent treaty underpinning all major international climate agreements, ratified by almost every country in the world. After years of delays, the treaty to protect the high seas was ratified in September by 60 countries. The law aims to protect biodiverse areas in waters worldwide, extending beyond countries' exclusive economic zones. Teeming with plant and animal life, the oceans are responsible for creating half of the globe's oxygen supply and are vital to combatting climate change, conservationists say. Once the treaty becomes law, a decision-making body will have to work with a patchwork of regional and global organizations already overseeing different aspects of the oceans. These include regional fisheries bodies and the International Seabed Authority -- the forum where nations are jousting over proposed rules on the environmentally destructive deep-sea mining industry. ico/acb/sla","url":"https://today.rtl.lu/news/world/china-bids-to-host-secretariat-of-new-high-seas-treaty-763562951","image":"https://static-prod.rtl.lu/dims4/default/7412daa/2147483647/strip/false/crop/768x512+0+0/resize/768x512!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Frtl-luxembourg-new-production-web.s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fbb%2Fbd%2F4eb34e441e10566f002465f37538%2F","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-17 00:54:49","author":null,"language":"en","source_country":"lu","sentiment":-0.121},{"id":393696300,"title":"Justice Department investigating whether Minnesota’s Walz and Frey impeded immigration enforcement","text":"WASHINGTON (AP) — The Justice Department is investigating whether Minnesota Gov.

State and local officials have repeatedly told protesters to remain peaceful.\n\nTHIS IS A BREAKING NEWS UPDATE. AP’s earlier story follows below.\n\nMINNEAPOLIS (AP) — A Liberian man who has been shuttled in and out of custody since immigration agents in Minnesota broke down his door with a battering ram was released again Friday, hours after a routine check-in with authorities led to his second arrest.\n\nState authorities, meanwhile, had a message for any weekend protests against the Trump administration’s unprecedented immigration sweep in the Twin Cities: avoid confrontation.\n\n“While peaceful expression is protected, any actions that harm people, destroy property or jeopardize public safety will not be tolerated,” said Commissioner Bob Jacobson of the Minnesota Department of Public Safety.\n\nHis comments came after President Donald Trump backed off a bit from his threat a day earlier to invoke an 1807 law, the Insurrection Act, to send troops to suppress demonstrations.\n\n“I don’t think there’s any reason right now to use it, but if I needed it, I’d use it,” Trump told reporters outside the White House.\n\nDetention whiplash\n\nThe dramatic initial arrest of Garrison Gibson last weekend was captured on video. U.S. District Judge Jeffrey Bryan ruled the arrest unlawful Thursday and freed him, but Gibson was detained again Friday when he appeared at an immigration office.\n\nA few hours later, Gibson was free again, attorney Marc Prokosch said.\n\n“In the words of my client, he said that somebody at ICE said they bleeped up and so they re-released him this afternoon and so he’s out of custody,” Prokosch said, referring to Immigration and Customs Enforcement.\n\nGibson’s arrest is one of more than 2,500 made during a weekslong immigration crackdown in Minneapolis and St. Paul, according to the Department of Homeland Security. The operation has intensified and become more confrontational since the fatal shooting of Renee Good on Jan. 7.\n\nGibson, 37, who fled the civil war in his West African home country as a child, had been ordered removed from the U.S., apparently because of a 2008 drug conviction that was later dismissed. He has remained in the country legally under what’s known as an order of supervision, Prokosch said, and complied with the requirement that he meet regularly with immigration authorities.\n\nIn his Thursday order, the judge agreed that officials violated regulations by not giving Gibson enough notice that his supervision status had been revoked. Prokosch said he was told by ICE that they are “now going through their proper channels” to revoke the order.\n\nNative Americans urged to carry IDs\n\nMeanwhile, tribal leaders and Native American rights organizations are advising anyone with a tribal ID to carry it with them when out in public in case they are approached by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers.\n\nNative Americans across the U.S. have reported being stopped or detained by ICE, and tribal leaders are asking members to report these contacts.\n\nBen Barnes, chief of the Shawnee Tribe in Oklahoma and chair of the United Indian Nations of Oklahoma, called the reports “deeply concerning”.\n\nOrganizers in Minneapolis have set up application booths in the city to assist people needing a tribal ID.\n\nDemocratic members of Congress held a local meeting Friday to hear from people who say they’ve had aggressive encounters with immigration agents. St. Paul Mayor Kaohly Her, who is Hmong American, said people are walking around with their passports in case they are challenged, and she has received reports of ICE agents going from door to door “asking where the Asian people live.” Thousands of Hmong people, largely from the Southeast Asian nation of Laos, have settled in the United States since the 1970s.\n\n911 caller: Good was shot ‘point blank’\n\nMinneapolis authorities released police and fire dispatch logs and transcripts of 911 calls, all related to the fatal shooting of Good. Firefighters found what appeared to be two gunshot wounds in her right chest, one in her left forearm and a possible gunshot wound on the left side of her head, records show.\n\n“They shot her, like, cause she wouldn’t open her car door,” a caller said. “Point blank range in her car.”\n\nGood, 37, was at the wheel of her Honda Pilot, which was partially blocking a street. Video showed an officer approached the SUV, demanded that she open the door and grabbed the handle.\n\nGood began to pull forward and turned the vehicle’s wheel to the right. Another ICE officer, Jonathan Ross, pulled his gun and fired at close range, jumping back as the SUV moved past him. DHS claims the agent shot Good in self-defense.\n\nArrest in FBI vehicle incident\n\nFBI Director Kash Patel said at least one person has been arrested for stealing property from an FBI vehicle in Minneapolis. The SUV was among government vehicles whose windows were broken Wednesday evening. Attorney General Pam Bondi said body armor and weapons were stolen.\n\nThe destruction occurred when agents were responding to a shooting during an immigration arrest. Trump subsequently said on social media that he would invoke the Insurrection Act if Minnesota officials don’t stop the “professional agitators and insurrectionists” there.\n\nMinnesota’s attorney general responded by saying he would sue if the president acts.\n\n(Copyright (c) 2025 The Associated Press.

An internal Communist Party position was added as a fifth pillar last year.\nLam would be the first person to be named to both the top two jobs simultaneously by a party congress, rather than stepping in following a holder’s death.\nIf he was, said Derek Grossman of the University of Southern California, “Vietnam will become more like China and North Korea rather than maintaining a separation of powers”.","url":"https://www.scmp.com/news/asia/southeast-asia/article/3340236/vietnams-lam-eyes-supreme-power-seeks-presidency-party-congress?module=latest&pgtype=homepage","image":"https://cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2026/01/17/72bd50ba-ec81-47ca-831d-600246094632_849e65a7.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-17 00:53:25","author":"Agence France-Presse","authors":["Agence France-Presse"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"hk","sentiment":0.038},{"id":393694896,"title":"DOJ investigating Minnesota governor and Minneapolis mayor for allegedly impeding federal agents during crackdown","text":"The Department of Justice is investigating whether Minnesota Governor Tim Walz and Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey impeded federal agents during the recent crackdown on immigration enforcement in the state.\n\nThe investigation focuses on public statements the two men have made that may be in potential violation of a conspiracy statute, The Associated Press reported.\n\nIt comes following weeks of heavy presence from ICE agents in the North Star state, which the Department of Homeland Security has called its largest enforcement operation, resulting in more than 2,500 arrests.\n\nTensions have exploded recently following the fatal shooting of 37-year-old Renee Nicole Good by ICE agent Jonathan Ross on January 7.

She is a Honduran national who was brought to the United States by her mother when she was 8 while seeking asylum.\n\n\"There is happily no one-size-fits-all solution for seeing that justice be done in what all agree was an amalgam of errors that ended badly for Any,\" he said.\n\nStearns said the \"simplest solution\" would be for the U.S. Department of State to issue her a visa. The alternative, he said, would be for him to order President Donald Trump's administration to arrange for Lopez Belloza's return, with a threat of holding the government in contempt if it refused. \n\nHe gave the administration 21 days to inform him of how it will proceed. The Justice Department declined to comment.

That followed her being convicted as part of an effort to divert 5-Hour Energy drink bottles acquired for resale in Mexico and instead keep them in the U.S. Prosecutors said she and several co-conspirators attached counterfeit labels and filled the bottles with a phony liquid before selling them.\n\nIn 2024, she and her brother, Andres, were convicted in a separate case, this one involving lying to manufacturers to sell wholesale groceries and additional items at big discounts after pledging that they were meant for sale in Mexico or to prisoners or rehabilitation facilities. The siblings sold the products at higher prices to U.S. distributors, prosecutors said. \n\nThe Camberoses were among 13 pardons Trump issued Thursday, along with eight commutations. An additional pardon was announced Friday for Terren Peizer, a resident of Puerto Rico and California who headed the Miami-based health care company Ontrak. \n\nPeizer had been convicted and sentenced to 42 months in prison, and fined $5.25 million, for engaging in an insider trading scheme to avoid losses exceeding $12.5 million, according to the Justice Department.\n\nThe president has issued a number of clemencies during the first year of his second term, many targeted at criminal cases once touted by federal prosecutors. They’ve come amid a continuing Trump administration effort to erode public integrity guardrails — including the firing of the Justice Department’s pardon attorney.\n\nAlso pardoned this week was former Puerto Rico Gov. Wanda Vázquez, who had pleaded guilty last August to a campaign finance violation in a federal case that authorities say also involved a former FBI agent and a Venezuelan banker. Her sentencing had been set for later this month.\n\nFederal prosecutors had been seeking one year behind bars, something Vázquez’s attorneys opposed as they accused prosecutors of violating a guilty plea deal reached last year that saw previous charges including bribery and fraud dropped. \n\nThey had noted that Vázquez had agreed to plead guilty to accepting a promise of a campaign contribution that was never received. \n\nAlso involved in the case was banker Julio Herrera Velutini, whose daughter, Isabela Herrera, donated $2.5 million to Trump’s MAGA Inc. super PAC in 2024, and gave the group an additional $1 million last summer. The case’s third defendant was former FBI agent Mark Rossini, who was also pardoned by the president. \n\nThe recent wave of clemencies joins previous Trump pardons of Democratic former Illinois Gov. Rod Blagojevich and Republican ex-Connecticut Gov. John Rowland, whose promising political career was upended by a corruption scandal and two federal prison stints.\n\nTrump also pardoned former U.S. Rep. Michael Grimm, a New York Republican who resigned from Congress after a tax fraud conviction and made headlines for threatening to throw a reporter off a Capitol balcony over a question he didn’t like. Reality TV stars Todd and Julie Chrisley, who had been convicted of cheating banks and evading taxes, also got Trump pardons. \n\nThe president also pardoned Texas Democratic Rep. Henry Cuellar in a bribery and conspiracy case. He later expressed regret and frustration for having done so, however, when Cuellar announced he was seeking reelection without switching parties to become a Republican.","url":"https://apnews.com/article/trump-pardons-donor-twice-convicted-fraud-99263a04b8a60ce8c081b9c5feaffd2e","image":"https://dims.apnews.com/dims4/default/9758996/2147483647/strip/false/crop/6794x4529+0+0/resize/1486x991!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fassets.apnews.com%2F66%2F2f%2F8966aeeae8e9d6bb05a9ecdcea87%2F6afc117ef91c404d8d32449554f1fa36","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-17 00:47:49","author":"Will Weissert","authors":["Will Weissert"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.274},{"id":393696246,"title":"Trump names Blair, Rubio to Gaza 'board of peace'","text":"WASHINGTON, D.C. — US President Donald Trump on Friday tapped Secretary of State Marco Rubio and former British prime minister Tony Blair as founding members of the Gaza 'board of peace.'Trump also named his special envoy Steve Witkoff, son-in-law Jared Kushner and World Bank President Ajay Banga among those on the seven-member 'founding executive board,' the White House said in a statement.Trump himself will chair the board, it said, adding that further members would be announced in coming weeks.Blair is a controversial choice in the Middle East because of his role in the 2003 invasion of Iraq, and Trump himself said last year that he wanted to make sure he was an 'acceptable choice to everybody.'Trump had announced the formation of the 'board of peace' on Thursday, a key phase two element of a US-backed plan to end the war in Gaza.The US president said it was the 'Greatest and Most Prestigious Board ever assembled at any time, any place.'The board's creation comes shortly after the announcement of a 15-member Palestinian technocratic committee, charged with managing the day-to-day governance of devastated post-war Gaza.Gaza native and former Palestinian Authority deputy minister Ali Shaath will head the new committee.Trump on Friday also named US Major General Jasper Jeffers to head the International Stabilization Force (ISF) in Gaza.The US-backed Gaza peace plan first came into force on October 10, leading to the return of all the hostages held by Hamas and an end to the fighting between the Palestinian militant group and Israel in the besieged territory.The plan's second phase is now underway, though clouded by allegations of aid shortages and violence.Hamas, meanwhile, has refused to publicly commit to a full disarmament, a non-negotiable demand from Israel.","url":"https://www.manilatimes.net/2026/01/17/world/americas-emea/trump-names-blair-rubio-to-gaza-board-of-peace/2260587","image":"https://www.manilatimes.net/manilatimes/uploads/images/2026/01/17/902942.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-17 00:47:00","author":"Agence France-Presse","authors":["Agence France-Presse"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"ph","sentiment":0.041},{"id":393693658,"title":"Multiple UVA board members resign under pressure from Spanberger – The Virginian-Pilot","text":"The head of the board overseeing the University of Virginia and two other top board members, including a major donor to the school, on Friday resigned under pressure from the state’s incoming Democratic governor, according to two people briefed on the matter and letters obtained by The New York Times.\n\nThe resignations came after Abigail Spanberger asked at least five members of the board to step aside as she takes office Saturday.\n\nThose who submitted resignations Friday were Rachel Sheridan, the head of the board, known at UVA as the rector; Porter Wilkinson, the vice rector; and Paul Manning, a board member and major donor who gave $100 million to the university just a few years ago, according to the letters.\n\nThere are 12 members of the Board of Visitors, which oversees the school, and all had been appointed by Spanberger’s Republican predecessor, Glenn Youngkin. At least two other members of the board were asked to resign but so far have resisted. It is unclear if Spanberger has asked the rest of the board members to resign.\n\nThe turmoil at the university over its board is the latest fallout to rock the school since the Trump administration began a pressure campaign against it earlier this year. Last summer, the school’s president, Jim Ryan, resigned amid pressure from the Trump administration, which was threatening to cut the school’s funding and investigate it if Ryan remained in office.\n\nConservative alumni and members of the Justice Department under President Donald Trump had wanted Ryan out because they believed he was too liberal. It’s unclear what impact the resignations will have on the recently appointed president of the school, Scott C. Beardsley. Some Virginia Democrats and school faculty members have been calling on Spanberger to have Beardsley removed, saying that he was too hastily appointed by a board that refused to stand up to Trump.\n\nShortly after her election in November, Spanberger sent a letter to the board asking that they delay the search for a new president after Ryan resigned, but the board declined to do so and appointed Beardsley anyway.\n\nThe moves come after months of broader conflict over the direction of the nation’s most elite higher education institutions. Trump and other Republicans have put enormous pressure on schools that they say have veered too far to the left. But many faculty members, university presidents and leaders on the left have argued that the tactics, including funding cuts to schools and efforts to oust university leadership, are threatening their independence and academic freedom.\n\nOn Friday, as news of Spanberger asking the members to resign made its way around Richmond and Charlottesville, some top Virginia Republicans were shocked by Spanberger’s decision. They believe that Manning has been integral to the school’s growth and that ousting board members will just continue the turmoil at the school.\n\nManning had discussions with senior Justice Department officials in July in which they told him that Ryan had to go.\n\n“Paul Manning reached out directly to the DOJ lawyers to make sure he was not missing anything, and he said that they told him that if I didn’t resign, they would ‘bleed UVA white,’” Ryan later wrote in a letter about his firing.\n\nUVA and Spanberger could not be immediately reached for comment.\n\nOther schools in the state may also be poised for leadership changes. One of George Mason University’s board members, Charles D. Stimson, offered his resignation to Youngkin on Friday, according to a letter that was obtained by the Times.\n\nStimson, who also works for the Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank, had been the chair of George Mason’s board. The school had also experienced turmoil over the summer, after the Trump administration targeted its president, Gregory N. Washington, over his support of diversity programs and asked him to personally apologize.\n\nGMU said it would not have any comment about Stimson’s resignation. Stimson did not respond immediately to a request for comment.\n\nThis article originally appeared in The New York Times.","url":"https://www.pilotonline.com/2026/01/16/uva-board-members-resign-spanberger-pressure/","image":"https://www.pilotonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/IMG_5742.jpg?w=1024&h=768","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-17 00:45:55","author":"Stephanie Saul","authors":["Stephanie Saul"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.336},{"id":393695476,"title":"Trump offers to restart US mediation in Nile River dispute between Egypt and Ethiopia","text":"By WILL WEISSERT\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump said Friday that he was ready to restart U.S. mediation efforts between Egypt and Ethiopia with an eye toward resolving long-standing issues of water sharing from the ⁠Nile River.\n\nWashington-led mediations began during Trump’s first term, but they effectively collapsed in 2020, when Ethiopia withdrew — though some discussions later continued under the African Union.\n\nEthiopia formally inaugurated the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam, or GERD, last fall. As Africa’s largest dam, it is located on the Blue Nile near Ethiopia’s border with Sudan and is meant to produce more than 5,000 megawatts, doubling Ethiopia’s electricity generation capacity.\n\nEthiopia sees the dam as a boon to its economy. But Egypt opposed its construction, arguing that it would reduce the country’s share of Nile River waters — which it almost entirely relies on for agriculture and to serve its more than 100 million people.\n\nOn Sept. 4, before the dam’s inauguration, Tamim Khallaf, spokesperson for the Egyptian foreign ministry, said Ethiopia built the dam “unilaterally without any prior notification, proper consultations, or consensus with downstream countries, thereby constituting a grave violation of international law and posing an existential threat.”\n\nTrump posted on his social media site a letter he sent to Egyptian President Abdel-Fattah el-Sissi, saying: “I am ‍ready to ‍restart ⁠U.S. ‌mediation between ⁠Egypt ‍and Ethiopia to responsibly resolve the ⁠question of ‘The Nile Water Sharing’ once ‌and for all.”\n\n“My team and I understand the significance of the Nile River to Egypt and its people,” Trump wrote.\n\nThe president frequently boasts about ending eight wars around the world, though that claim is exaggerated. Egypt and Ethiopia are already on his list of wars he resolved, with Trump maintaining he stopped a conflict that might have led to fighting over issues that included the dam known as GERD.\n\nTrump recently told Fox News that one of the ongoing conflicts that has continued despite his claiming to have stopped it — between Thailand and Cambodia — should actually count more than once.\n\n“I did put out eight wars, eight and a quarter, because, you know, Thailand and Cambodia started going at it again,” he told Sean Hannity last week. The implication was a flare-up in the conflict made it an extra 1/4 of a war — something to watch for as he pushes mediation efforts again in Ethiopia and Egypt.","summary":"Mediation efforts began during Trump's first term but collapsed in 2020 when Ethiopia withdrew.","url":"https://www.ocregister.com/2026/01/16/trump-egypt-ethiopia/","image":"https://www.ocregister.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Trump_10919.jpg?w=150&strip=all","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-17 00:45:22","author":"Associated Press,Gqlshare","authors":["Associated Press","Gqlshare"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.059},{"id":393695254,"title":"Trump offers to restart US mediation in Nile River dispute between Egypt and Ethiopia","text":"By WILL WEISSERT\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump said Friday that he was ready to restart U.S. mediation efforts between Egypt and Ethiopia with an eye toward resolving long-standing issues of water sharing from the ⁠Nile River.","url":"https://www.baltimoresun.com/2026/01/16/trump-egypt-ethiopia/","image":"https://www.baltimoresun.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Trump_10919.jpg?w=1024&h=683","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-17 00:45:22","author":"Associated Press","authors":["Associated Press"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.409},{"id":393691910,"title":"'Huge problem': Damning new WSJ poll spells trouble for Trump","text":"A damning new Wall Street Journal poll on Friday delivered a another devastating blow to President Donald Trump's economic boasts, revealing crumbling voter confidence just weeks into 2026.\n\nBy a crushing 15-point margin, voters now rate the economy as weak rather than strong, a dramatic swing from July, when the negative gap was just 4 points.

He said she lacked the “respect” needed to govern Venezuela following the U.S. military strike that deposed the country’s repressive leader, Nicolás Maduro. In a private meeting on Thursday, Machado gifted him her 2025 Nobel Peace Prize medal. Since then, Trump’s view of Machado appears to have warmed. Trump didn’t win the prize on his own last year — a snub that rankles him — but he said he greatly appreciated Machado’s gesture. He is keeping the 18-karat gold medal, which Machado presented in a gilded frame captioned, “To Donald J. Trump.” Speaking to reporters Friday before leaving for his home in Palm Beach, Trump heaped praise on Machado. Gone was any talk of disrespect. “I had a great meeting yesterday by a person who I have a lot of respect for — and she has respect, obviously, for me and our country — and she gave me her Nobel Prize,” Trump said. “But I’ll tell you what: I got to know her. I never met her before, and I was very, very impressed. She’s a really — this is a fine woman.” He made no promises about Machado's political future or a commitment to swapping her in for the Maduro holdovers now running Venezuela day to day. Indeed, CIA Director John Ratcliffe met with the interim president, Delcy Rodríguez, in Caracas on Thursday to discuss the “working relationship” between the U.S. and Venezuela, a U.S. official said. But Trump did suggest that when it comes to Venezuela’s leadership, Machado is part of his calculus. “I think she’s a very fine woman and we’ll be talking again,” he said. Asked if Machado made enough of an impression on Trump that he’ll set a quicker timetable for elections in Venezuela, Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., a Trump confidant, wrote in a text message: “Stay tuned.” Machado has proved deft at appealing to Trump since the president ordered the raid on Jan. 3 that plucked Maduro from his fortified compound. She has made multiple appearances on Trump’s go-to network, Fox News, while issuing statements bound to pique Trump’s interest. In presenting Trump with the medal, she invoked one of his favorite talking points: the wars he’s said he ended since taking office a year ago. “She said, ‘You know, you’ve ended eight wars and nobody deserves this prize more than — in history — than you do,” Trump recalled. Machado held a news conference Friday at the Heritage Foundation in Washington and made reference to the 2020 U.S. election that Trump claims robbed him of victory. (No evidence has emerged of election fraud on a scale that would have made Trump the winner.) She mentioned that Maduro’s regime stole the 2024 election in Venezuela from her opposition movement. “And I think he can certainly relate to that,” she said of Trump. Where she and Trump differ is their assessment of the remnants of the Maduro regime. On Wednesday, Trump said he had a “very good” phone conversation with Rodríguez. “This partnership between the United States of America and Venezuela will be a spectacular one FOR ALL,” he wrote on his social media platform. Machado, though, gave a withering evaluation of the Maduro regime leaders who remain atop the government. In her remarks at Heritage, she called Rodríguez “a communist” and an ally of Russia, China and Iran. Trump defended his decision to retain Maduro’s cohorts as a lesson gleaned from the ill-fated U.S. invasion of Iraq in the 2000s. After the U.S. toppled the Iraqi regime, American officials ousted government employees who later became terrorists, he said. “I remember that,” Trump said. The Norwegian Nobel Committee on Friday weighed in on the transfer of what is arguably humanity's most prestigious medal from the winner to someone who didn’t win. The prize cannot be shared, transferred or “revoked,” the committee said. “The decision is final and applies for all time.” Still, it isn’t all that uncommon for winners to part with the hardware. In the 125 years since the first Nobel laureate was named, the medal has been sold, given away or sent to museums for display. Nothing in the rules prevents that. Nor does the Nobel committee take a stance on what the winners choose to do with their medals. In its statement, the committee cited several cases, concluding with that of Knut Hamsun, who won the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1920. In 1943, Hamsun traveled to Germany and met the Third Reich’s propaganda minister, Joseph Goebbels. Hamsun later sent Goebbels his medal to thank him for the meeting. “The present whereabouts of the medal are unknown,” the committee wrote.","url":"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/nobel-prize-trump-praises-venezuela-opposition-machado-meeting-rcna254459","image":"https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-1500w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2026-01/260110-donald-trump-ch-1533-720c46.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-17 00:40:48","author":"Garrett Haake,Peter Nicholas","authors":["Garrett Haake","Peter Nicholas"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.046},{"id":393695890,"title":"World News | Trump Hails 'great Relationship' with Venezuelan Interim Govt","text":"Washington DC [US], January 17 (ANI): US President Donald Trump on Friday (local time) said that Venezuela has offered Washington \"50 million barrels of oil\" worth USD 5.2 billion, and he has agreed to that deal.\nAddressing the press on the renaming of Southern Boulevard to Donald J Trump Boulevard, Trump said, \"We're dealing with the new President.

But Congress is skeptical of Trump’s designs for the Denmark-owned island.\n\nOn Friday, Trump said at a White House event that he “may put a tariff on countries if they don’t go along with Greenland, because we need Greenland for national security.”\n\nAfter leaders from Greenland and Denmark visited Capitol Hill Thursday, Sen. Chris Coons, D-Del., is leading a bipartisan weekend trip to Denmark. The urgency of the trip was spurred on by Trump’s insistence that the United States should be in control of Greenland, a semi-autonomous facet of the Danish Kingdom.\n\nThe Congressional delegation has attracted high-ranking members of the Senate, including Senate Minority Whip Dick Durbin, D-Ill.\n\nDurbin criticized Trump’s pressure campaign against Denmark on X: “President Trump’s continued threats toward Greenland are unnecessary and would only weaken our NATO alliance.”\n\n“[The] United States Congress stands firm in our partnership, despite the President’s advances,” Durbin continued. \n\nCoons and Durbin will be joined by Democrat Sens. Jeanne Shaheen of New Hampshire, Peter Welch of Vermont, and Democrat Reps. Steny Hoyer of Maryland, Gregory Meeks of New York, Madeleine Dean of Pennsylvania, Sara Jacobs of California, and Sarah McBride of Delaware. Republicans on the trip include Sens. Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, and Thom Tillis, R-N.C. \n\nTrump previously shared in a truth social post Wednesday that “the United States needs Greenland for the purpose of National Security.” Acquiring the territory from Denmark, the president claims, will increase NATO’s effectiveness in the region. \n\nDenmark announced it was increasing military presence in Greenland this week. NATO allies in Europe followed suit. France, Germany, the U.K., Norway, Sweden, and the Netherlands have sent troops or promised to deploy them soon. \n\nThe bipartisan bicameral delegation is taking the weekend trip to “highlight more than 200 years of friendship between the United States and the Kingdom of Denmark, including enduring national security ties and decades of economic cooperation,” as Coons described in a press release. \n\nAccording to Durbin the Congressional Delegation has planned to meet with Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen, an array of ministers, and attend a Parliamentarian Engagement at Christiansborg Palace with lawmakers from Denmark and Greenland.\n\nThe goals of these meetings are to “deepen this partnership in line with our shared principles of sovereignty and self-determination, and in the face of growing challenges around the world, especially bolstering Arctic security and promoting stronger trade relations between the two countries,” said Durbin.","summary":"President Donald Trump has his eyes set on Greenland and may tariff countries opposed to the US acquisition of the island.

We have peace in the Middle East...We stopped India and Pakistan from fighting, two nuclear nations...The Pakistani Prime Minister said Donald Trump saved at least 10 million people, and it was amazing,\" he said.Trump has made similar claims many times since May 10 last year, stating that it was his pressure that led to peace between the two nuclear-armed neighbours as he makes his pitch for the Nobel Peace Prize. \n\nFollowing the much-anticipated meeting with US President Donald Trump, almost two weeks after US strikes on Caracas, Venezuelan opposition leader and Nobel laureate Maria Corina Machado on Thursday said that she had presented her Nobel Peace Prize medal to Trump at the White House, describing the gesture as recognition for his support for Venezuelan freedom and democratic efforts.President Trump also acknowledged Machado's gesture, calling it \"a wonderful gesture of mutual respect\" in a post on Truth Social and thanked her for the medal.However, according to statements from the Norwegian Nobel Committee and the Norwegian Nobel Institute, once a Nobel Prize is awarded, it cannot be withdrawn, shared, or passed on to another individual, and the decision is permanent and remains in effect indefinitelyAs Trump continuous claims continue, it is worth noting that India has consistently denied any third-party involvement, maintaining that peace was brokered directly between the two countries following India's launch of Operation Sindoor to target terror bases in Pakistan. The operation was launched in response to the Pahalgam terror attack in Jammu and Kashmir, which killed 26 people back in April 2025.According to Indian officials, it was Pakistan's Director General of Military Operations (DGMO) who contacted his Indian counterpart on May 10 to request an end to hostilities.

U.S. District Judge Richard Stearns in Boston imposed the deadline after a lawyer for the administration earlier this week apologized for having violated a court order that should have prevented 19-year-old Any Lucia Lopez Belloza from being sent to Honduras. She is a Honduran national who was brought to the United States by her mother when she was 8 while seeking asylum. \"There is happily no one-size-fits-all solution for seeing that justice be done in what all agree was an amalgam of errors that ended badly for Any,\" he said. Stearns said the \"simplest solution\" would be for the U.S. Department of State to issue her a visa. The alternative, he said, would be for him to order President Donald Trump's administration to arrange for Lopez Belloza's return, with a threat of holding the government in contempt if it refused. He gave the administration 21 days to inform him of how it will proceed. The Justice Department declined to comment. Her lawyer did not respond immediately to a request for comment. Lopez Belloza, a freshman at Babson College in Massachusetts, was arrested on November 20 while at Boston's airport while preparing to travel home to Texas to surprise her family for Thanksgiving. Her lawyer the next day sued in Massachusetts to challenge her detention, and a judge issued an order on November 21 barring Lopez Belloza from being deported or transferred out of the state for 72 hours. But by that time, Lopez Belloza had already been moved to Texas. She was sent to Honduras on November 22 and remains there with her grandparents. Stearns, who was appointed by Democratic President Bill Clinton, on Friday said because she was outside of Massachusetts by the time her lawyer sued, he lacked jurisdiction to hear her overall case going forward. But he said the government retained the ability to remedy the \"tragic (and preventable) mistake\" of violating the court's order. A lawyer for the government on Tuesday apologized for what he said was a \"mistake\" by an officer with Immigration and Customs Enforcement who failed to properly flag it because he thought it no longer applied as she was out of Massachusetts.

Trump said on January 10 he was calling for a one-year cap on credit card interest rates at 10% starting on January 20, a move that hit share prices and prompted banks to warn it would hurt consumers' access to credit. However, the White House has not provided details on how the plan will come to fruition on that day or how it would be enforced. Such a dramatic move could likely not be enforced through executive powers or financial regulators and would require legislation in Congress, where such efforts have failed in the past, according to regulatory experts and analysts. White House economic adviser Kevin Hassett earlier floated floated the idea of \"Trump cards\" that banks would voluntarily offer instead of being forced by a new law, speaking on Friday to Fox Business Network's \"Mornings with Maria\" program. Bloomberg on Friday reported that the White House was weighing using an executive action, citing sources. The lack of firm guidance leaves banks with a dilemma ahead of Tuesday. Some analysts say the industry may push for a compromise in which lenders launch new products with lower rates and fewer benefits. NO REQUIREMENT TO COMPLY Banks have been scratching their heads about what may happen that day, given as of Friday, there was no legal or regulatory requirement to comply, said a source at a major bank who declined to be identified speaking about sensitive policy issues. That person and a credit card industry insider said the industry had been in discussions with the administration to gain clarity. Despite the confusion over how the administration might implement the cap, lenders were taking Trump's directive seriously, said a third industry source. Indeed, the finance industry was caught off guard by the announcement last week. In the wake of it, one bank prepared its CEO in case of a call from an administration official, the banking source said. \"I think there will be an ongoing conversation between the industry and the administration,\" said Stephen Biggar, a banking analyst at Argus Research, although he was uncertain what might happen on Tuesday. The industry has for years fought bills in Congress that would cap credit card rates, and its position had not changed, said a fourth source at a trade group who added that banks expected to ramp up their advocacy efforts to fight the proposal in the coming weeks. Trump's announcement is seen as an attempt to address voter concerns over the cost of living ahead of congressional elections this year, in a revival of his presidential campaign pledge. \"The president certainly has an expectation ... that the credit card companies will do this,\" White House spokeswoman Karoline Leavitt told reporters on Thursday. \"I don't have a specific consequence to outline for you, but certainly this is an expectation, and frankly, a demand that the president has made.\" Hassett said on Friday that the administration was discussing with big bank CEOs how to extend credit to borrowers who lack it but could otherwise qualify. A White House official said the Trump administration was exploring every tool possible to address an affordability crisis that it blames on the Biden administration. POSSIBLE SOLUTIONS Credit cards are extremely profitable, and a cap could affect future earnings expectations of larger banks and card companies, said David Krakauer, vice president of portfolio management for Mercer Advisors. Card providers could instead make conciliatory gestures with innovative offerings, such as lower rates for certain customers or no-frills cards that could charge 10% but have no rewards, or lower credit limits, analysts said. Some banks, like Bank of America, already offer similar cards. \"Banks could offer either a new card or a line to a customer at a rate that was probably in the 10% area, but keeping in mind that the likely features of that card would be less robust,\" said Moshe Orenbuch, managing director at TD Cowen. While banks can push back, there's a limit to how far, said Brian Mulberry, senior client portfolio manager at Zacks Investment Management, which owns several large-cap bank stocks. \"Policy volatility is likely to create market volatility until there is a clear path forward for banks and regulators.\" (Additional reporting by Michelle Price, Pete Schroeder, Laura Matthews, Nandita Bose, Susan Heavey in Washington; Writing by Megan Davies; Editing by Rod Nickel) By Saeed Azhar, Tatiana Bautzer and Manya Saini","url":"https://www.marketscreener.com/news/wall-street-banks-face-test-with-trump-s-call-for-credit-card-rate-cap-ce7e58dfdb8df322","image":"https://cdn.zonebourse.com/static/resize/0/0//images/reuters/2026-01/2026-01-17T004004Z_1_LYNXMPEM0G00A_RTROPTP_4_USA-BANKS-EARNINGS.JPG","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-17 00:34:18","author":"Reuters","authors":["Reuters"],"language":"en","source_country":"fr","sentiment":-0.4},{"id":393693692,"title":"DOJ Reportedly Investigating Tim Walz, Jacob Frey Over Impeding ICE","text":"The Department of Justice has opened an investigation into Minnesota Gov.

Trump is a dishonest person. I doubt if he would treat Venezuela’s money fairly. He sent warships and is using “Gunboat Diplomacy” to get his way. He arrested the dictator but left the corrupt government basically intact.\n\nOnce money starts to disappear, going to “reimburse America,” resentment will surely grow.

Thank you!\" he posted on social media.\n\nIran has not publicly announced plans for such executions or said it had cancelled them.\n\nThe protests erupted on December 28 over economic hardship and swelled into widespread demonstrations calling for the end of clerical rule, culminating in mass violence at the end of last week. According to opposition groups and an Iranian official, more than 2000 people were killed in the worst domestic unrest since Iran's 1979 Islamic Revolution.\n\nBut several residents of Tehran reached by Reuters said the capital had now been comparatively quiet for four days. Drones were flying over the city, but there had been no sign of major protests on Thursday or Friday. Another resident in a northern city on the Caspian Sea said the streets there also appeared calm. The residents declined to be identified for their safety.\n\nPROSPECT OF US ATTACK RETREATS\n\nThe prospect of a US attack has retreated since Wednesday, when Trump said he had been told killings in Iran were easing. But more US military assets were expected to arrive in the region, showing the continued tensions.\n\nUS allies, including Saudi Arabia and Qatar, conducted intense diplomacy with Washington this week to prevent a US strike, warning of repercussions for the wider region that would ultimately impact the United States, a Gulf official said.\n\nIsrael's intelligence chief David Barnea was also in the US on Friday for talks on Iran, according to a source familiar with the matter, and an Israeli military official said the country's forces were on \"peak readiness\".\n\nAs an internet blackout eased this week, more accounts of the violence have trickled out.\n\nOne woman in Tehran told Reuters by phone that her daughter was killed a week ago after joining a demonstration near their home.\n\n\"She was 15 years old. She was not a terrorist, not a rioter. Basij forces followed her as she was trying to return home,\" she said, referring to a branch of the security forces often used to quell unrest.\n\nThe US is expected to send additional offensive and defensive capabilities to the region, but the exact makeup of those forces and the timing of their arrival was still unclear, a US official said speaking on condition of anonymity.\n\nThe US military's Central Command declined to comment, saying it does not discuss ship movements.\n\nPAHLAVI CALLS FOR INCREASED PRESSURE\n\nReza Pahlavi, the US-based son of Iran's last shah who has gained increasing prominence as an opposition figure, on Friday urged the international community to ramp up pressure on Tehran to help protesters overthrow clerical rule.\n\n\"The Iranian people are taking decisive action on the ground. It is now time for the international community to join them fully,\" said Pahlavi, whose level of support inside Iran is hard to gauge.\n\nTrump this week appeared to downplay the idea of US backing for Pahlavi, voicing uncertainty that the exiled royal heir who has courted support among Western countries could muster significant backing inside Iran. Pahlavi met US envoy Steve Witkoff last weekend, Axios reported.\n\nIranian-Kurdish rights group Hengaw said that there had been no protest gatherings since Sunday, but \"the security environment remains highly restrictive\".\n\n\"Our independent sources confirm a heavy military and security presence in cities and towns where protests previously took place, as well as in several locations that did not experience major demonstrations,\" Norway-based Hengaw said in comments to Reuters.\n\nREPORTS OF SPORADIC UNREST\n\nThere were, however, still indications of unrest in some areas. Hengaw reported that a female nurse was killed by direct gunfire from government forces during protests in Karaj, west of Tehran. Reuters was not able to independently verify the report.\n\nThe state-affiliated Tasnim news outlet reported that rioters had set fire to a local education office in Falavarjan County, in central Isfahan Province, on Thursday.\n\nAn elderly resident of a town in Iran's northwestern region, where many Kurdish Iranians live and which has been the focus for many of the biggest flare-ups, said sporadic protests had continued, though not as intensely.\n\nDescribing violence earlier in the protests, she said: \"I have not seen scenes like that before.\"\n\nVideo circulating online, which Reuters was able to verify as having been recorded in a forensic medical centre in Tehran, showed dozens of bodies lying on floors and stretchers, most in bags but some uncovered. Reuters could not verify the date of the video.\n\nThe state-owned Press TV cited Iran's police chief as saying calm had been restored across the country.\n\nA death toll reported by US-based rights group HRANA has increased little since Wednesday, now at 2677 people, including 2478 protesters and 163 people identified as affiliated with the government.\n\nReuters has not been able to independently verify the HRANA death toll. An Iranian official told the news agency earlier this week that about 2000 people had been killed.\n\nThe casualty numbers dwarf the death toll from previous bouts of unrest that have been suppressed by the state, including in 2009 and 2022.","summary":"","url":"https://www.odt.co.nz/news/world/protests-abate-iran-after-deadly-crackdown","image":"https://www.odt.co.nz/sites/default/files/styles/odt_story_opengraph_1200w/public/story/2026/01/2026-01-15t110803z_295234260_rc2n1ja0y68s_rtrmadp_3_iran-economy-protests.jpg?itok=xzJ_TxXH","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-17 00:27:57","author":null,"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"nz","sentiment":-0.432},{"id":393696318,"title":"US names Rubio, Blair and Kushner in Gaza board under Trump’s plan","text":"WASHINGTON - The White House on Jan 16 announced names of the so-called “Board of Peace” that will, under US President Donald Trump’s plan, supervise the temporary governance of Gaza, which continues to see deadly violence despite a fragile ceasefire that went into effect in October. \n\nThe names included US Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Trump special envoy Steve Witkoff, former British Prime Minister Tony Blair and Mr Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner, the White House said. Mr Trump is the chair of the board, according to his plan revealed late last year.\n\nIsrael and Palestinian militant group Hamas signed off in October on Mr Trump’s plan, which says a Palestinian technocratic body will be overseen by an international so-called “Board of Peace” that is meant to supervise Gaza’s governance for a transitional period.\n\nThe board also includes private equity executive and billionaire Marc Rowan, World Bank President Ajay Banga and Robert Gabriel, a Trump adviser, the White House said, adding that Mr Nickolay Mladenov, the former UN Middle East envoy, will have the role of high representative for Gaza.\n\nThe White House statement did not lay out the responsibilities of each member. \n\nMany rights experts and advocates have previously said that Mr Trump overseeing a board to supervise a foreign territory’s governance resembled a colonial structure, while Mr Blair’s involvement was criticised last year due to his role in the Iraq war.\n\nMajor General Jasper Jeffers, a former US special operations commander, was appointed commander of the International Stabilization Force, the White House said. A UN Security Council resolution, adopted in mid-November, authorised the “Board of Peace” and countries working with it to establish that force in Gaza.\n\nIsrael and Hamas have accused each other of ceasefire violations in Gaza, where since the start of the truce in October over 440 Palestinians, including more than 100 children, and three Israeli soldiers have been reported killed.\n\nIsrael’s assault on Gaza since late 2023 has killed tens of thousands, caused a hunger crisis and internally displaced Gaza’s entire population. Multiple rights experts, scholars and a UN inquiry say it amounts to genocide. Israel has said it took action in self-defense after Hamas-led militants killed 1,200 people and took over 250 hostages in their October 2023 attack.

It is that “now what?” feeling many people experience when the fun, family time, travel, and celebrations are over and normal routines resume.\n\nMental health professionals at Bellevue Hospital say this emotional shift is common and is often linked to the sudden change in routine, emotional stimulation and financial pressures after the festive season.\n\n“Many people feel emotionally low after the holidays because that period is often filled with increased time with family and friends, social activities and celebration. When that suddenly ends, it can create a sense of loss,” said Dr Brian Kazaara, psychiatrist at Bellevue Hospital. “In addition, many people experience financial strain after holiday spending, which can add to stress and emotional distress as the new year begins.”\n\nWhile post-holiday blues are usually temporary, Bellevue Hospital warns that some people may experience more serious emotional symptoms.\n\n“If you are feeling empty, sad or unmotivated after the holidays, it is important to know that these feelings are common and, for many people, temporary,” Dr Kazaara added. “With time, most persons return to their usual emotional state, but in some cases, additional support from loved ones or a mental health professional may be needed.”\n\nThe hospital is advising members of the public to pay close attention to how long these feelings last and how strongly they affect daily life.\n\n“When low moods last longer than two weeks, or are accompanied by major changes in sleep, appetite, energy, concentration, or thoughts of self-harm, this may indicate something more serious,” Dr Kazaara explained. “A noticeable decline in your ability to function at work, school or in relationships is also a clear sign that professional help should be sought.”\n\nBellevue Hospital is encouraging people to protect their mental well-being during this transition period by easing back into routines, setting realistic goals, getting adequate rest, eating balanced meals, staying physically active, and maintaining social connections even after the holidays. Reducing excessive social media use, which can increase feelings of comparison and pressure, is also recommended.\n\nFor those who need additional support, mental health services are available across the public health system.\n\n“People who are struggling emotionally after the holidays can access support through their local public health centres and the public mental health hotlines such as the Ministry of Health and Wellness’ Mental Health and Suicide Prevention Hotline at 888-639-5433. For more severe cases, Bellevue Hospital provides emergency mental health assessment and treatment to ensure that individuals receive the care they need,” Dr Kazaara said.\n\nMembers of the public who are experiencing emotional distress or need guidance are encouraged to contact their nearest health centre or visit the Bellevue Hospital website at bvh.gov.jm for information on support and resources.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTags: Bellevue Hospital depression holiday mental health \n\n\n\n\n\n\n {\"jamaica-observer\":\"Jamaica Observer\"} \n\n\n\n\n\n0 Comments · Make a comment\n\n\n\n\n ALSO ON JAMAICA OBSERVER\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInternational, Latest News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n OpenAI introducing ads to ChatGPT \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJanuary 16, 2026 \n\n\n SAN FRANCISCO, United States (AFP) — OpenAI announced Friday it will begin testing advertisements on ChatGPT in the coming weeks, as the wildly popula... \n\n\n\n\n {\"jamaica-observer\":\"Jamaica Observer\"} \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInternational, Latest News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n X, formerly Twitter, services restored \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJanuary 16, 2026 \n\n\n X, formerly Twitter, services have been restored after the platform appeared to have suffered a major outage on Friday.
