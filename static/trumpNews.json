Dan Sabbagh reports that the US president told NBC he would impose such measures within a month “if a deal isn’t made, and if I think it was Russia’s fault”, as he vented frustration at Vladimir Putin’s delaying tactics and attempts to discredit Volodymyr Zelenskyy, the Ukrainian president.\n\nSome countries, including China and India, are not participating in anti-war sanctions against Russian oil. Secondary sanctions or tariffs imposed directly on them by the US could further limit Putin’s access to oil revenue to fund the war. While not joining the international sanctions against Russia, China has been wary about breaching them in case it attracts secondary penalties. Some Chinese banks, for example, have curtailed dealings with Russian companies for fear of being barred from the international banking system.\n\nUBS analyst Giovanni Staunovo said that targeting buyers – as Trump has done with Venezuela’s oil – could affect China and India. “We need to see, however, what will be announced over the coming days.” India has surpassed China to become the biggest buyer of seaborne Russian crude oil, which comprised about 35% of India’s total crude imports in 2024. There have been concerns since the beginning of the war about India being a “back door” for Russian oil exports.\n\nWilliam Reinsch, a former senior US commerce department official now at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, said the haphazard way Trump was announcing and threatening tariffs left questions unanswered, including how US officials could trace and prove which countries were buying Russian oil.\n\nTrump also claimed on Sunday that Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, was “trying to back out of the rare earth deal and if he does that he’s got some problems, big, big problems”. The White House is demanding the first cut of all Ukraine’s mineral resource revenue for years, plus interest, in return for military aid. Zelenskyy has been open to a deal but cautious about the terms, while the Trump administration has been on-again, off-again about getting it signed.\n\nRussia’s defence ministry claimed on Sunday that its forces had gained control over Zaporizhzhia settlement in Ukraine’s Donetsk region. The village is unrelated to the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant which is in another region. The Russian claim was reported by Reuters, which said it was not able to verify it. The village is 7km from the border of Ukraine’s central Dnipropetrovsk region. The Donetsk region borders Dnipropetrovsk to the east.\n\nUkraine’s military said on Sunday that it destroyed 65 out of 111 drones launched by Russia during an overnight attack. It added that another 35 drones were “locationally lost” without causing damage – typically a reference to electronic jamming – but damage was reported in the Kharkiv, Sumy, Odesa and Donetsk regions.","summary":"Trump threatens Putin over ceasefire; Russia claims it has taken control of a Donetsk village.

I am not saying that there are no others,\" Putin said, speaking after talks in Paris about how to firm up Ukraine's position on and off the battlefield.\n\nThe idea could be implemented \"under the auspices of the UN, the USA, with European countries\" and with \"partners and friends\" of Russia, Putin said.\n\nThe goal would be \"to hold democratic elections and bring to power a capable government enjoying the trust of the people and then to start talks with them about a peace treaty,\" Putin said.\n\nPutin has long complained that Ukraine's authorities are not a legitimate negotiating partner because President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has remained in power beyond the end of his five-year mandate.\n\nNo Elections Under Martial Law\n\nElections were to be held in May 2024, but under Ukrainian law Zelenskyy remains president until new elections are held. But they cannot be held under martial law, which the country has been under since Russia launched its invasion in February 2022.\n\nPutin repeated that he views the current leadership of Ukraine as illegitimate and he is therefore resistant to signing any documents with it.\n\nPutin also expressed Russia's readiness for a peaceful settlement, saying Russia is \"persistently and confidently moving toward achieving all the goals stated at the beginning\" of the Russian invasion. \"There is reason to believe that we will achieve them.”\n\nHe said he believed US President Donald Trump sincerely wants to end the conflict, and Trump's push for direct talks between US and Russian negotiators showed that Trump wants peace.\n\nThere has been no reaction from Ukraine to Putin's latest statements.\n\nUS Secretary of State Marco Rubio said it's too early to expect high-level talks with Russia.\n\n\"There's a lot of work to be done with both sides, particularly with the Russian side, which we haven't talked to for years,\" Rubio said on March 27 on his return flight to the United States after a Caribbean tour.\n\nAsked how long it would take to make progress, Rubio said, \"I just can't put a timeframe on that because it doesn't depend on us.\"\n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron, who on March 27 hosted a summit of the leaders of a \"coalition of the willing,\" said they were more united around Ukraine than ever before and need to ensure that they're able to counter what he described as Russia's plan to draw out the negotiating process in order to grab more land.\n\n\"Our target is clear,\" Macron said at a press conference after the summit involving the leaders of 27 countries. \"It is to achieve peace -- and to do this, we need to get Ukraine in the best possible place.\"\n\nThe summit discussed the potential deployment of European forces in Ukraine to complement a future cease-fire or peace deal.\n\n\"There will be a reassurance force operating in Ukraine representing several countries,\" Macron said.\n\nHe added that there is currently no unanimity on sending a European-led force and that not all members have agreed to participate, but he said that this is not required to move ahead.\n\nThe French president said that foreign ministers of coalition countries were tasked with looking at specific legal questions over any European-led reassurance force and told to report back in three weeks.\n\nWhether the plan will result in a deployment or whether it will be integrated into diplomatic talks spearheaded by Washington remains to be seen.\n\nSaudi Peace Talks\n\nFollowing the summit, Zelenskyy said everyone understood that Russia does not seek peace and said that work on security guarantees would continue in the coming days and weeks.\n\nEarlier this week, separate US talks with Kyiv and Moscow in Saudi Arabia led to the announcement of a deal that the White House said resulted in a cease-fire in the Black Sea and an agreement \"to develop measures for implementing\" their commitment to halt strikes on energy facilities.\n\nBut Russia is also demanding a number of conditions be met before it abides by the Black Sea agreement, including an easing of sanctions.\n\nMacron said following the summit in Paris that he intends to speak to Trump and praised the recent US diplomacy.\n\nLater on March 27, Trump adviser Elon Musk told Fox News that he believes there will be a negotiated peace to end the war.\n\n“For the past two years, thousands of people have died every week for nothing. For what?” said Musk, who has become one of Trump's closest advisers.\n\nHe said he has \"contempt\" for people who want to continue the war without regard for those who are dying.\n\n\"I take great offense at those who…put the appearance of goodness over the reality of it,” he said. “Those who virtue signal and say we can’t give in to Russia but have no solution to stopping thousands of kids dying every day.”\n\nAsked whether he is optimistic that Trump’s plan to end the war will work, Musk said the plan is the only thing that will work.\n\nWith reporting by Reuters and AFP","summary":"Kyiv accused Moscow of a \"war crime\" after Russian drones struck a military hospital in Kharkiv, Ukraine's second-largest city, as part of an overnight attack that also hit a shopping center, apartment blocks, and other targets.","url":"https://www.rferl.org/a/ukraine-russia-zelenskyy-putin-oil-tariffs-minerals/33364668.html","image":"https://gdb.rferl.org/C2B4BCCE-0C35-430B-9DEA-AA79032BF45F_w1080_h608.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-03-31 00:42:01","author":"Rfe/rl's Ukrainian Service","authors":["Rfe/rl's Ukrainian Service"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.002},{"id":305896066,"title":"Tim Walz's daughter sparks backlash after revealing entitled reason she's turning down graduate school offer","text":"Tim Walz's daughter has turned down a graduate school offer because she does not want to 'give her money' to an institution which won't support students' right to protest.\n\nHope Walz, whose Democrat father would have been vice president if Kamala Harris won the election, will instead 'take her time' over the next year to find a school which better aligns with her values.\n\nShe said as a 'privileged white woman', the repercussions of protesting on campus wouldn't necessarily impact her, but she didn't want to give money to an institution that wouldn't also protect her peers.\n\nProtesting on campus has become a flashpoint of the Trump administration, after the president signed an executive order describing pro-Palestine activism which swept campuses last year acts of antisemitism.\n\nHe threatened to cut federal funding to schools which 'allow illegal protests' and vowed to imprison 'agitators' or send them back 'to the country which they came from.'\n\nAmerican students who could not be deported faced expulsion and arrest, Trump said, while simultaneously banning masks which shield a protester's identity.\n\nHope's comments sparked outrage among critics who said she was acting 'performatively' and 'setting feminism back 50 years.' \n\n'White women privilege is getting into college but having such rich parents you can decide to not go.. how noble and brave,' another critic said. \n\nOthers questioned whether she truly was accepted to her 'dream school', saying she could have been creating an elaborate excuse when in reality she simply didn't get in.\n\n'She didn't get in lol.

The case is ongoing. \n\nWhile Trump has made Columbia the most visible target of his crackdown on higher education, he has put other universities on notice that they will face cuts if they do not embrace his agenda.\n\nHis administration has announced investigations into 52 universities for their diversity, equity and inclusion programs. And it has suspended approximately $175 million in federal funding for the University of Pennsylvania over a transgender swimmer who last competed for the school in 2022.\n\nAnd in the comment section of Hope's video, she was inundated with current and former students who said their schools' stances 'broke their hearts.' \n\n'It's sad when these institutions don't support their communities,' one former student at John Hopkins said.\n\n'University of Michigan broke my heart,' another added.\n\nThe State Department has revoked more than 300 student visas connected to college students who protested in support of Palestine. \n\nHope said her criticism of the school she had been accepted into 'has nothing to do with students that currently go there, a lot of the faculty.'\n\n'But the people at the top are making these decisions and I decided that I'm not going to do that. \n\n'I'm going to do a little bit more research going forward, making sure I'm going to schools that align with my values and then maybe start in a year, which is okay.

Vance in the Oval Office.\n\nAfter Trump temporarily froze all military aid and intelligence sharing with Kiev, Zelensky has signaled willingness to return to negotiations, while insisting that Kiev does not “owe” Washington anything.\n\nOn Friday, Zelensky confirmed that Ukraine had received a new draft proposal, but claimed “there are a lot of things that had not been discussed before. And there are also some things that the parties had previously rejected.”\n\n“He’s trying to back out of the rare earth deal, and if he does that, he’s got some problems – big, big problems,” Trump told reporters aboard Air Force One on Sunday, as cited by Reuters.\n\nTrump also reiterated that Ukraine should abandon its aspirations to join NATO – a stance he previously acknowledged as a factor in the conflict with Russia. Moscow has long opposed the US-led bloc’s eastward expansion, calling it a threat to its national security.\n\n“He wants to be a member of NATO, but he’s never going to be a member of NATO,” Trump said, adding that even Zelensky “understands that.”\n\nAccording to Reuters, the latest version of the minerals deal is significantly harsher than earlier iterations. Under the proposed terms, the US would recoup all aid provided to Ukraine since the 2022 escalation of its conflict with Russia, and would impose a 4% annual interest rate on the total before Kiev could access any of the profits from the joint extraction fund.\n\nThe US has allocated more than $123 billion in military and financial assistance to Ukraine since 2022, according to data from Germany’s Kiel Institute.

Treasury yields also dropped further as funds sought any safe harbour, while gold reached another record peak.\n\nPresident Donald Trump on Friday said he was open to carving out deals with countries seeking to avoid tariffs, but media reports over the weekend claimed he was urging his advisers to be more aggressive with their plans.\n\nSpeaking to reporters late Sunday he said the tariffs would essentially hit all countries, causing renewed ripples in Asian markets.\n\nTrump is due to receive their recommendations on Tuesday and announce initial tariffs on Wednesday, followed by auto levies the day after. Yet it is still not clear how high the tariffs will be or what countries and goods they will cover.\n\nThe European Union was ready to respond with tariffs of its own, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz said on Sunday, but there were also reports the block was preparing a list of concessions to offer to Trump.\n\nMany economists are worried that tariffs will hit the US economy hard, even while limiting the Federal Reserve's scope to cut rates by also lifting inflation in the short term.\n\n\"Recession risks have become elevated – to a 40 per cent probability – on concerns that aggressive US policies hit business and household sentiment,\" warned Bruce Kasman, chief economist at JPMorgan.\n\n\"With the latest tariff increases set to push US core inflation above 4.0 per cent next quarter, a household sector with a healthy balance will need to show a willingness to lower its saving rate to cushion this blow.\"\n\nData out on Friday underlined the risks as a key measure of core inflation rose by more than expected in February while consumer spending disappointed.\n\nThat raised the stakes for the March payrolls report due on Friday where any outcome below the 140,000 gain expected would only add to recession fears. Also due are a rush of surveys on factories and services, along with figures on trade and job openings.\n\nThe threat of a global trade war likewise sent a chill through Asia, where MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan shed 0.5 per cent.\n\nJapan's Nikkei tumbled 3.2 per cent as automaker stocks continued to suffer fallout from Trump's talk of 25 per cent tariffs on imported cars and light trucks.\n\nBond investors seem to be betting the slowdown in US economic growth will outweigh a temporary lift in inflation and prompt the Fed to cut rates by around 70 basis points this year.\n\nThis, combined with a flight from risk assets, saw 10-year Treasury yields drop to 4.215 per cent.\n\nThe outlook for rates could become clearer when Fed Chair Jerome Powell speaks on Friday, following a host of other Fed speakers this week.\n\nThe drop in yields saw the dollar dip 0.1 per cent to 149.35 yen , while the euro was steady at $US1.0825 ($A1.7174). The dollar index held at 104.00, having slipped for the previous two sessions.\n\nThe perceived safety of gold saw the metal hit another all-time high at $US3,097 ($A4,914) an ounce.\n\nOil prices have been supported by US sanctions against producers Venezuela and Iran, though the risk of slower global growth remained a headwind.\n\nTrump on Sunday also said he would impose secondary tariffs of 25 to 50 per cent on all Russian oil if he feels Moscow is blocking his efforts to end the war in Ukraine.\n\nBrent rose 8.0 cents to $US73.68 ($A116.90) a barrel, while US crude added 2.0 cents to $US69.38 ($A110.07) per barrel.","summary":"Nasdaq futures drop 1.1 per cent, Nikkei falls 3.2 per cent; Trump says US tariffs to cover all countries; Flight to safety buoys bonds, gold hits record.","url":"https://thewest.com.au/business/markets/stocks-skid-bonds-rally-as-tariff-clock-ticks-down-c-18213992","image":"https://images.thewest.com.au/publication/C-18213992/ae6965451059c04f4bf2e997ed73f064662b65b7-16x9-x0y0w1280h720.jpg?imwidth=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-03-31 00:36:22","author":"Staff Writers","authors":["Staff Writers"],"language":"en","source_country":"au","sentiment":0.034},{"id":305899276,"title":"World News | Myanmar Earthquake Death Toll Rises to 1,700 as Rescuers Scramble to Find Survivors","text":"Naypyidaw [Myanmar], March 31 (ANI): Rescue efforts are underway in Myanmar after a devastating 7.7-magnitude earthquake struck the country, killing at least 1,700 people and leaving widespread destruction in its wake.

The region, home to over 1.5 million people, has been severely affected, with multiple buildings, bridges, and temples destroyed or damaged.\nAlso Read | Russia-Ukraine War: 2 Killed and Dozens Wounded in Russian Attack on Kharkiv; Donald Trump Lashes Out at Vladimir Putin.\nIn Bangkok, the earthquake's impact was devastating, with at least 18 people killed and dozens more trapped under the rubble of a collapsed high-rise building. The building, which was under construction, came crashing down in a matter of minutes, claiming the lives of 11 people.\nAccording to CNN, seven more fatalities were reported elsewhere in the capital as authorities scrambled to respond to the disaster. Search and rescue operations are ongoing, with around 80 people still missing. Families of the missing are gathering at the site of the collapsed building, anxiously awaiting news of their loved ones.\nThe earthquake that struck Myanmar was the most powerful to hit the country in over a century, with a magnitude of 7.7.

It's supposed to be a joyous occasion when families feast and purchase new clothes for children, but most of Gaza's 2 million people are just trying to survive.\n\n“It’s the Eid of sadness,” Adel al-Shaer said after attending prayers amid rubble in the central town of Deir al-Balah. “We lost our loved ones, our children, our lives and our futures.”\n\nTwenty members of his extended family have been killed by Israeli strikes, including four young nephews a few days ago, he said and began to cry.\n\nIsrael ended the ceasefire with Hamas and resumed the 17-month war earlier this month with a surprise bombardment that killed hundreds, after the militant group refused to accept changes to the truce reached in January. Israel has not allowed food, fuel or humanitarian aid to enter Gaza for a month.\n\n“There is killing, displacement, hunger and a siege,” said Saed al-Kourd, a worshipper. “We go out to perform God’s rituals in order to make the children happy, but as for the joy of Eid? There is no Eid.”\n\nNew proposal for Gaza ceasefire\n\nArab mediators are trying to get the truce back on track. Hamas said on Saturday it had accepted a new proposal from Egypt and Qatar. Israel said it made a counter-proposal in coordination with the United States, which has also been mediating. Details were not immediately known.\n\nThe Palestinian Red Crescent Society said the bodies of eight of its emergency medical technicians, and five members of Gaza's Civil Defense, were recovered a week after they and their ambulances vanished in Rafah during heavy fire.\n\nThe PRCS said a ninth colleague was still missing, adding that the targeting of medics “cannot be seen as anything other than a war crime.”\n\nGaza's Health Ministry asserted that some of the bodies had been bound and shot in the chest, and it called on the United Nations and other international organizations to investigate and hold Israel accountable.\n\nIsrael’s military on Sunday said its troops had opened fire on vehicles “advancing suspiciously” without emergency signals or movement coordinated in advance. It asserted that nine “terrorists” had been killed.\n\nIsrael’s operation in Gaza\n\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Israel would continue military operations while negotiating. He rejected claims that Israel does not want to end the war, while laying out conditions that go far beyond the ceasefire agreement and have been rejected by Hamas.\n\n“Hamas will disarm. Its leaders will be allowed out. We will look out for the general security in the Gaza Strip and allow for the realization of (President Donald) Trump’s plan,” Netanyahu told a Cabinet meeting.\n\nMr. Trump has proposed that Gaza's population be resettled in other countries so the U.S. can redevelop Gaza for others. Palestinians say they do not want to leave their homeland. Human rights experts say the plan would likely violate international law.\n\nIsraeli strikes on Sunday morning killed at least 16 people, including nine children and three women, according to Nasser Hospital in the southern city of Khan Younis.\n\nTwo girls appeared to be wearing new clothes purchased for the holiday, according to an Associated Press cameraman, including spotless sneakers.\n\nOn Sunday evening, a strike hit a tent in Deir al-Balah and killed at least two people, according to an AP journalist at the hospital.\n\nThe war began when Hamas-led militants stormed into Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, killing some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and taking 251 hostages. Hamas is still holding 59 captives — 24 believed to be alive.\n\nIsrael's offensive has killed over 50,000 Palestinians, according to Gaza's Health Ministry, which does not distinguish between civilians and combatants in its tally. Israel says it has killed around 20,000 militants, without providing evidence, and blames civilian deaths on Hamas because it operates in densely populated areas.\n\nNetanyahu’s security Cabinet approved the construction of a road for Palestinians in the occupied West Bank. Critics say it will open the door for Israel to annex a key area just outside Jerusalem, further undermining the feasibility of a future Palestinian state.\n\nNetanyahu’s office said the project is meant to streamline travel for Palestinians in communities near the large Jewish settlement of Maaleh Adumim.\n\nPeace Now, an Israeli anti-settlement watchdog group, said the road will divert Palestinian traffic outside of Maaleh Adumim and the surrounding area known as E1, a tract of open land deemed essential for the territorial contiguity of a future state.\n\nThat will make it easier for Israel to annex E1, according to Hagit Ofran, a settlement expert with the group, because Israel can claim there is no disruption to Palestinian movement.\n\nCritics say Israeli settlements and other land grabs make a contiguous future state increasingly impossible. Several roads in the West Bank are meant for use by either Israelis or Palestinians, which international rights groups say is part of an apartheid system, allegations Israel rejects.\n\nIsrael captured the West Bank, Gaza and east Jerusalem in the 1967 Mideast war. The Palestinians want all three for their future state. A two-state solution is widely seen as the only way to resolve the decades-old conflict.","summary":"Many Palestinians prayed outside demolished mosques to mark the end of the Muslim fasting month of Ramadan; It's supposed to be a joyous occasion when families feast and purchase new clothes for children, but most of Gaza's 2 million people are just trying to survive","url":"https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/eid-of-sadness-palestinians-in-gaza-mark-eid-with-dwindling-food-and-no-end-to-war/article69394603.ece","image":"https://th-i.thgim.com/public/incoming/fhwyux/article69394605.ece/alternates/LANDSCAPE_1200/CORRECTION_Israel_Palestinians_Eid_al-Fitr_41834.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-03-31 00:30:00","author":null,"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"in","sentiment":-0.166},{"id":305894988,"title":"Starmer and Trump discuss ‘productive negotiations’ on economic deal","text":"Sir Keir Starmer and Donald Trump have agreed “productive negotiations” about an economic deal between the UK and US will “continue at pace”, Downing Street has said, ahead of a looming deadline on US tariffs.\n\nThe Sunday night phone call between the pair comes after sources at No 10 said the government was prepared to retaliate against US trade taxes if needed.\n\nBritish negotiators are trying to win a last-minute exemption ahead of Trump’s 25% levy on car imports, which is expected to come in on Wednesday.\n\nTrump has imposed a series of tariffs targeting goods from other countries in the first few months of his second term in the White House, with threats of wider taxes also being imposed.\n\nThe prime minister has previously said he does not want to jump into a trade war with the US.

He declined to say what the materials were or to share further details.\n\nThe fire follows numerous acts of vandalism in recent weeks directed against Tesla, the electric-car company whose owner, Elon Musk, has led Republican President Donald Trump’s effort to slash the federal workforce. Several of those cases involved Molotov cocktails that were used to start fires at dealerships. U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi has called it a “wave of domestic terrorism.”\n\nAttacks on property carrying the logo of Elon Musk’s electric-car company are cropping up across the U.S. and overseas.

Jason Fejer with Albuquerque Fire Rescue.\n\nThe building was unoccupied and no one was injured. But the blaze badly burned the entrance and caused extensive smoke damage throughout the office, where three people work full time, according to Fejer and Republican party representatives.\n\nA photo provided by GOP representatives showed the charred entrance of the building with wood and pieces of burned insulation scattered on the ground.

The president responded, “That’s one” method, adding: “But there are others too.”\n\nAsked to share another method, he responded: “No.”\n\nAmending the Constitution to eliminate the two-term limit would be extremely challenging, requiring either a two-thirds vote in Congress or two-thirds of the states to agree to convene a constitutional convention to propose changes. Either option would then need ratification from three-quarters of the states.\n\nTrump maintains that “a lot of people would like me to” hold office for a third term.\n\nSpeaking to reporters on board Air Force One as he flew back to Washington, D.C. after a weekend in Florida, he was asked about whether he was serious about serving a third term.\n\nTrump said: “I'm not looking at that but I'll tell you, I have had more people ask me to have a third term, which in a way is a fourth term because the other election, the 2020 election was totally rigged, so it's actually sort of a fourth term. I just don't want the credit for the second because Biden was so bad, he did such a bad job, and I think that's one of the reasons that I'm popular, if you want to know the truth.\n\n“I think I'm popular because we've done a great job. I think we've had the best hundred days of almost any president. Most people are saying that and it's an honor, bringing back our country. We're respected as a country again. We're strongly respected and people are amazed.”\n\nAsked about the constitutional limits he faced, he said: “I don't even want to talk about it. I'm just telling you I have had more people saying, please run again. We have a long way to go before we even think about that but I've had a lot of people.”\n\nThese were his most extensive comments on the matter. Previous remarks have often been dismissed as jokes or the president trolling his critics and opponents.\n\nThe 22nd Amendment says “no person shall be elected” as president “more than twice.”\n\nWhile the first president, George Washington, set an example of serving a maximum of two terms, Franklin D Roosevelt was beginning his fourth when he died in office in 1945. Six years later Congress passed the 22nd Amendment to constitutionally limit presidents to two full terms.\n\nThe main body of the amendment reads: “No person shall be elected to the office of the President more than twice, and no person who has held the office of President, or acted as President, for more than two years of a term to which some other person was elected President shall be elected to the office of the President more than once. But this Article shall not apply to any person holding the office of President when this Article was proposed by the Congress, and shall not prevent any person who may be holding the office of President, or acting as President, during the term within which this Article becomes operative from holding the office of President or acting as President during the remainder of such term.”\n\nAs to the idea of running as vice president in a Vance campaign and having power handed to him, the 12th Amendment says: “No person constitutionally ineligible to the office of President shall be eligible to that of Vice President of the United States.”\n\nSuch a plan would depend on Vance being elected in his own right and then choosing to give up power to Trump, who would by then be in his 80s. Those supporting this theory could argue that it does not flout the terms of the 22nd Amendment, which talks about limits on how many terms a president can be elected to, not how many they can serve.\n\nHowever, such a move would be sure to trigger a constitutional dispute, with others arguing that it flew in the face of the principles of the amendment, and was hardly a proper way for the United States to choose a leader.","url":"https://uk.news.yahoo.com/trump-says-not-joking-serving-193348215.html","image":"https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_independent_577/ebe66e69b980ad9505db334368aa42c8","video":"","publish_date":"2025-03-31 00:22:17","author":"Oliver O'connell","authors":["Oliver O'connell"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.256},{"id":305893574,"title":"US politics live: Donald Trump says he’s ‘not joking’ about seeking third term","text":"Jeffrey Goldberg, the Atlantic magazine editor who was added to a Trump administration group chat concerning the bombing of Houthi rebels in Yemen, has dismissed US National Security Adviser Mike Waltz’s explanation for how he wound up there. \n\nSpeaking to NBC’s Kristen Welker on Meet The Press, Goldberg said Mr Waltz’s defence that his contact was “sucked in” to his phone via “somebody else’s contact” was impossible. \n\n“This isn’t The Matrix.

He declined to say what the materials were or to share further details.\n\nThe fire follows numerous acts of vandalism in recent weeks directed against Tesla, the electric-car company whose owner, Elon Musk, has led Republican President Donald Trump’s effort to slash the federal workforce. Several of those cases involved Molotov cocktails that were used to start fires at dealerships. U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi has called it a “wave of domestic terrorism.”\n\nAttacks on property carrying the logo of Elon Musk’s electric-car company are cropping up across the U.S. and overseas. While no injuries have been reported, Tesla showrooms, vehicle lots, charging stations and privately owned cars have been targeted.\n\nFirefighters responded to the fire just before 6 a.m. and brought it under control within about five minutes, according to Lt. Jason Fejer with Albuquerque Fire Rescue.\n\nThe building was unoccupied and no one was injured. But the blaze badly burned the entrance and caused extensive smoke damage throughout the office, where three people work full time, according to Fejer and Republican party representatives.\n\nA photo provided by GOP representatives showed the charred entrance of the building with wood and pieces of burned insulation scattered on the ground. A broken and burned door was set to one side.\n\nThe GOP office’s security system detected the fire, said New Mexico Republican Party Chair Amy Barela.

And in his first months back in office, Trump has pushed the issue further, erasing mention of transgender people on government websites and passports and trying to remove them from the military.\n\nIt’s a contradiction of numbers that reveals a deep cultural divide: Transgender people make up less than 1% of the U.S. population, but they have become a major piece on the political chess board — particularly Trump’s.\n\nFor transgender people and their allies — along with several judges who have ruled against Trump in response to legal challenges — it’s a matter of civil rights for a small group. But many Americans believe those rights had grown too expansive.\n\nThe president’s spotlight is giving Monday’s Transgender Day of Visibility a different tenor this year.\n\n“What he wants is to scare us into being invisible again,” said Rachel Crandall Crocker, the executive director of Transgender Michigan who organized the first Day of Visibility 16 years ago. “We have to show him we won’t go back.”\n\nSo why has this small population found itself with such an outsized role in American politics?\n\nTrump’s actions reflect a constellation of beliefs that transgender people are dangerous, are men trying to get access to women’s spaces or are pushed into gender changes that they will later regret.\n\nThe American Academy of Pediatrics, the American Medical Association and other major medical groups have said that gender-affirming treatments can be medically necessary and are supported by evidence.\n\nZein Murib, an associate professor of political science and women’s, gender and sexuality studies at Fordham University, said there has been a decades-old effort “to reinstate Christian nationalist principles as the law of the land” that increased its focus on transgender people after a 2015 U.S. Supreme Court ruling recognizing same-sex marriage nationwide. It took a few years, but some of the positions gained traction.\n\nOne factor: Proponents of the restrictions lean into broader questions of fairness and safety, which draw more public attention.\n\nSports bans and bathroom laws are linked to protecting spaces for women and girls, even as studies have found transgender women are far more likely to be victims of violence. Efforts to bar schools from encouraging gender transition are connected to protecting parental rights. And bans on gender-affirming care rely partly on the idea that people might later regret it, though studies have found that to be rare.\n\nSince 2020, about half the states passed laws barring transgender people from sports competitions aligning with their gender and have banned or restricted gender-affirming medical care for minors. At least 14 have adopted laws restricting which bathrooms transgender people can use in certain buildings.\n\nIn February, Iowa became the first state to remove protections for transgender people from civil rights law.\n\nIt’s not just political gamesmanship. “I think that whether or not that’s a politically viable strategy is second to the immediate impact that that is going to have on trans people,” Fordham’s Murib said.\n\nMore than half of voters in the 2024 election — 55% — said support for transgender rights in the United States has gone too far, according to AP VoteCast. About 2 in 10 said the level of support has been about right, and a similar share said support hasn’t gone far enough.\n\nNevertheless, AP VoteCast also found voters were split on laws banning gender-affirming medical treatment, such as puberty blockers or hormone therapy, for minors. Just over half were opposed to these laws, while just under half were in favor.\n\nTrump voters were overwhelmingly likely to say support for transgender rights has gone too far, while Kamala Harris’ voters were more divided. About 4 in 10 Harris voters said support for transgender rights has not gone far enough, while 36% said it’s been about right and about one-quarter said it’s gone too far.\n\nA survey this year from the Pew Research Center found Americans, including Democrats, have become more slightly more supportive of requiring transgender athletes to compete on teams that match their sex at birth and more supportive on bans on gender-affirming medical care for transgender minors since 2022. Most Democrats still oppose those kinds of measures, though.\n\nLeor Sapir, a fellow at Manhattan Institute, a right-leaning think tank, says Trump’s and Republicans’ positions have given them a political edge.\n\n“They are putting their opponents, their Democratic opponents, in a very unfavorable position by having to decide between catering to their progressive, activist base or their median voter,” he said.\n\n“People across the political spectrum agree that in fact, the major crises and major problems facing the United States right now is not the existence and civic participation of trans people,” said Olivia Hunt, director of federal policy for Advocates for Trans Equality.\n\nAnd in the same election that saw Trump return to the presidency, Delaware voters elected Sarah McBride, the first transgender member of Congress.\n\nPaisley Currah, a political science professor at the City University of New York, said conservatives go after transgender people in part because they make up such a small portion of the population.\n\n“Because it’s so small, it’s relatively unknown,” said Currah, who is transgender. “And then Trump has kind of used trans to signify what’s wrong with the left. You know: ‘It’s just too crazy. It’s too woke.’”\n\nBut Democratic politicians also know the population is relatively small, said Seth Masket, director of the Center on American Politics at the University of Denver, who is writing a book about the GOP.\n\n“A lot of Democrats are not particularly fired up to defend this group,” Masket said, citing polling.\n\nFor Republicans, the overall support of transgender rights is evidence they are out of step with the times.\n\n“The Democrat Party continues to find themselves on the wrong side of overwhelmingly popular issues, and it proves just how out of touch they are with Americans,” National Republican Congressional Committee spokesperson Mike Marinella said.\n\nSome of that message may be getting through. In early March, California Gov. Gavin Newsom, a potential 2028 Democratic presidential candidate, launched his new podcast by speaking out against allowing transgender women and girls competing in women’s and girls sports.\n\nAnd several other Democratic officials have said the party spends too much effort supporting transgender rights. Others, including U.S. Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto, have said they oppose transgender athletes in girls and women’s sports.\n\nJay Jones, the student government president at Howard University and a transgender woman, said her peers are largely accepting of transgender people.\n\n“The Trump administration is trying to weaponize people of the trans experience … to help give an archenemy or a scapegoat,” she said. But “I don’t think that is going to be as successful as the strategy as he thinks that it will be.”\n\nAssociated Press polling editor Amelia Thomson-DeVeaux contributed to this article.

He requested that the court issue an injunction \"as soon as possible but no later than the planned event on Sunday evening.\"The ruling comes after the Wisconsin Court of Appeals on Saturday denied Kaul's bid to stop Musk from making the payments. Kaul had previously been denied a request for an emergency injunction by a county court judge.Kaul argued that Musk's planned giveaway violated a state law that makes it a felony to offer voters \"anything of value\" to influence their vote.\"Wisconsin law prohibits offering anything of value to induce anyone to vote,\" Kaul wrote in his filing. \"Yet, Elon Musk did just that.\"Last week, Musk deleted a post on X where he said he'd issue two separate $1 million checks \"in appreciation for you taking the time to vote.\" In a new post, he wrote that entry to the town hall would be limited to individuals who sign a petition \"in opposition to activist judges,\" adding that the two recipients of the $1 million checks would be spokesmen for the petition.The Wisconsin high court now has a 4-3 liberal majority. Tuesday's contest between liberal Dane County Judge Susan Crawford and conservative Waukesha County Judge Brad Schimel will decide the court's ideological direction moving forward. Musk has lined up behind Schimel.Schimel previously served as Wisconsin's attorney general for one term and was narrowly defeated in his 2018 reelection bid by Kaul.Musk's America PAC has spent over $12 million on the race, which is officially nonpartisan. However, as has been the case in recent years, the two parties have both lined up behind candidates in the state's Supreme Court contests. President Donald Trump endorsed Schimel, while Crawford has been backed by an array of Democrats, including former President Barack Obama.","summary":"The ruling came after the Wisconsin Court of Appeals denied a bid by Attorney General Josh Kaul to stop Elon Musk from issuing payments to voters.","url":"https://www.businessinsider.com/elon-musk-wisconsin-supreme-court-payments-voters-race-2025-3","image":"https://i.insider.com/67e98b9c69253ccddf9ab7c3?width=1200&format=jpeg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-03-31 00:04:48","author":"John L.

In a memo sent out to colleagues, WHCA president Eugene Daniels wrote that the board unanimously decided to drop a comedic performance for the dinner as part of a \"re-envisioning\" of the tradition. \"At this consequential moment for journalism, I want to ensure the focus is not on the politics of division but entirely on awarding our colleagues for their outstanding work and providing scholarship and mentorship to the next generation of journalists,\" Daniels wrote. The decision came one day after White House deputy chief of staff for communications and personnel Taylor Budowich criticized the WHCA for recruiting Ruffin. WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENTS' DINNER FEATURES JABS AT BIDEN'S AGE, TRUMP'S LEGAL WOES, MAINSTREAM MEDIA \"This year’s @whca dinner will be hosted by a 2nd rate comedian who is previewing the event by calling this administration ‘murderers’ who want to ‘feel like human beings, but they shouldn’t get to feel that way, because you’re not.’ What kind of responsible, sensible journalist would attend something like this? More importantly, what kind of company would sponsor such as hate-filled and violence-inspiring event?\" Budowich wrote on X. Budowich also mocked the decision to pull Ruffin. \"No accountability at @WHCA, just a cop-out statement—pathetic! Many WHCA members are privately pointing the finger at Eugene for making the unilateral decision to recruit and sign this garbage, hate-filled comedian. Yet, they are all turning a blind eye to it publicly. It’s an indictment on how broken and useless this organization has become… so sad that such a storied and consequential group has been so quickly driven into irrelevancy. Oh well. Good riddance!\" Budowich wrote. Although Daniels wrote that he had been planning this change over the last couple of weeks, Ruffin has been promoting her gig as recently as Thursday. \"I have my Google Docs open at all times for throwing jokes in there and little thoughts I’m having, but I can’t help but to be like…we’re a little ways out, right?\" Ruffin said on The Daily Beast Podcast. \"News is happening at such a freaking clip that how are we supposed to hit that moving target? Also, how could you forget any of this stuff happened, you know what I mean?\" Fox News Digital reached out to WHCA and Ruffin for comment.

Two Chinese government offices overseeing Hong Kong affairs repeatedly reposted criticism published in op-eds in state-backed newspaper Ta Kung Pao. The op-eds accused Li’s conglomerate of “betraying and selling out all Chinese people” and urged it to drop the deal.\n\nCiting a source close to CK Hutchison’s management, local media reported on Friday that the company will not sign a deal on April 2 – a previously announced deadline for agreement – for “obvious reasons.”\n\nChina’s State Administration for Market Regulation also said on Friday that it will review CK Hutchison’s deal, according to local media reports, a move that will likely prevent any signings on or before April 2.\n\nLam said a company’s decision must “have benefits locally,” but added that external parties could not easily influence its operation.\n\n“Of course doing business involves buying and selling. I believe that all parties will handle the matter well,” he said.\n\n“I hope that there will be an acceptable outcome for all parties,” he added.\n\nCK Hutchison’s deal with the BlackRock-led consortium will return US$19 billion in cash, the company previously said.\n\nVictor Li, son of Li Ka-shing and chairperson of CK Hutchison, said in a results announcement released earlier this week that the company is expected to operate in a “volatile and unpredictable” environment this year, without mentioning the port deal.

It was a surprising tone as Trump himself has called Zelensky a “dictator” because of the country’s postponed elections, and his administration has often called into credibility the Ukrainian leader’s mandate.\n\n“If Russia and I are unable to make a deal on stopping the bloodshed in Ukraine and if I think it was Russia’s fault”, Trump continued, then he would impose “secondary tariffs on all oil coming out of Russia.”\n\nUnder Ukrainian law, elections are suspended during times of major military conflict.

David Jolly, Republican of Florida told MSNBC. “I think the biggest mistake of the last eight years is we somehow failed to give credibility to Donald Trump’s whims.\n\nNonetheless, Trump made the unusual move of striking out at the one actual dictator of the three, and said he planned to call him on Monday.\n\nTrump’s comments came after Grigory Karasin, a former ambassador to the UK and part of the Kremlin’s negotiating team, said on Sunday that a ceasefire may not be implemented until 2026.\n\n“It would be naive to expect any breakthrough results at the very first meeting,” said Karasin, who also serves as the chairman of the Federation Council’s Committee on International Affairs.\n\nTrump had previously brought up the possibility of imposing tariffs on Russia should the Kremlin not cooperate in peace talks. He explained to NBC, “if you buy oil from Russia, you can’t do business in the United States.”\n\n“There will be a 25 percent tariff on all oil, a 25- to 50-point tariff on all oil,” he said.","summary":"In a rare sign, the US President lashes out at Putin after Kremlin leader discusses a new regime in Ukraine, and threatens Russia with even more sanctions.","url":"https://www.kyivpost.com/post/49866","image":"https://static.kyivpost.com/storage/2025/03/19/17c832edb2d8aa5f77001fb0e315bf18.jpg?w=1200&q=90&f=jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-03-30 23:38:56","author":"Kyiv Post","authors":["Kyiv Post"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"ua","sentiment":-0.389},{"id":305890732,"title":"Skadden's pact with Trump was a 'dealbreaker,' associate tells BI after resigning","text":"After President Donald Trump announced a deal with Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom on Friday, Brenna Frey decided she had had enough.Frey, an associate at the firm's Washington, DC office who said she has worked in Big Law for over a decade, told Business Insider on Sunday it was a \"dealbreaker\" for her that Skadden chose to preemptively reach an agreement with the administration to avoid punitive executive actions similar to those taken against other law firms like Paul Weiss, Perkins Coie, and WilmerHale, among others.In recent weeks, Trump has targeted several Big Law firms with executive actions that strip their lawyers of security clearances and order reviews of their government contracts. Some firms, like Jenner & Block and WilmerHale, have fought the orders in court, while others, like Paul Weiss and Skadden, have chosen to sign agreements to avoid the legal headache.\"The deal was announced, and that was it for me,\" Frey said, noting that she was \"absolutely not considering leaving\" prior to Skadden's decision to provide $100 million in pro bono legal services to causes that Trump supports. The firm also promised it would not \"engage in illegal DEI discrimination,\" according to a copy of the agreement that Trump posted on Truth Social.In her resignation announcement posted on LinkedIn, Frey called Skadden's deal with Trump \"a craven attempt to sacrifice the rule of law for self-preservation.\"She told BI she wanted to make her resignation public to signal solidarity with those disappointed or angered by the agreement.\"I know there are people still at the firm who can't leave for whatever reason, financial reasons, needing to pay back law school loans, the breadwinner for their family,\" she said. \"I knew that those people can't speak out, so because I was able to, I felt it was important to make that public.\"In her LinkedIn post, Frey quoted Rachel Cohen, another former Skadden associate who resigned earlier this month in a firm-wide email. Frey said she also tried to send her resignation to all of Skadden's US firms but found the distribution lists disabled.Two other Skadden associates told BI that they, too, had tried to send firm-wide emails seeking more information about the deal but found that access to the internal distribution lists had been blocked after Cohen's resignation.In her March 20 resignation email to Skadden that she posted on LinkedIn, Cohen said the current situation was not normal. She also circulated an open letter among hundreds of associates at Big Law firms calling on their employers to take a stronger stand against Trump's executive orders.Cohen, who worked at the firm's Chicago office, wrote a response to Frey's LinkedIn post on Friday, complimenting her decision to \"stand for the rule of law.\"\"Brenna—you and many others are the reason that I will never be ashamed to say I worked at Skadden Arps, despite leadership's determination to try to ruin the firm's name,\" Cohen wrote.Frey said she's gotten support from some associates within Skadden, as well as from people outside the firm.\"With respect to Big Law more generally, I'm grateful that the world is watching, that clients are watching,\" she said. \"There are examples of firms out there who have successfully fought back.\"While firms like Skadden and Paul Weiss have inked deals with the president, drawing ire from many within the industry, other firms have chosen to sue in response to Trump's executive orders.Jenner & Block and WilmerHale are two of those firms. In both cases, judges approved temporary restraining orders to halt Trump's executive actions. The judges in both cases expressed concern that the targeted actions threatened the rule of law.\"I hope that they look to the firms who have fought back about against this infringement on the rule of law, rather than the firms who have chosen to acquiesce to the Trump administration's demands,\" Frey said.","summary":"After Skadden made a deal with Trump, Brenna Frey resigned, marking another public exit from the firm.","url":"https://www.businessinsider.com/skadden-big-law-trump-deal-brenna-frey-resignation-2025-3","image":"https://i.insider.com/67e9c1c8b8b41a9673fc1ed1?width=1200&format=jpeg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-03-30 23:36:42","author":"Katherine Tangalakis-Lippert,Katie Balevic","authors":["Katherine Tangalakis-Lippert","Katie Balevic"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.544},{"id":305889468,"title":"Donald Trump Says He’s ‘Not Joking’ About the Possibility of a Third Term: ‘There Are Methods’","text":"Donald Trump says he is “not joking” about the possibility of a third presidential term — despite the fact that it is illegal for a U.S. president to be elected to more than two terms.\n\n Trump, 78, made the comment during a phone interview with NBC News on Sunday, March 30. “A lot of people want me to do it,” he said during the interview. “But, I mean, I basically tell them we have a long way to go, you know, it’s very early in the administration ... I’m not joking. But I’m not — it is far too early to think about it.”\n\n At another point in the conversation, the president — who will be 82-years-old at the end of his second term — noted that “there are methods” by which it could be done, though he did not elaborate.\n\n The 22nd Amendment, which was added to the U.S. Constitution in 1951, states that a president cannot be elected to more than two terms.\n\n According to NBC, amending the Constitution would require either a two-thirds vote in Congress or two-thirds of U.S. states agreeing to call a constitutional convention to propose the changes — both of which are considered highly unlikely.\n\n A third method — which was mentioned by the NBC host during the Sunday morning conversation — would entail J.D. Vance winning the presidency on a Vance-Trump ticket and then resigning.\n\n Several of Trump’s most vocal supporters have publicly discussed the possibility of Trump running for a third term. His former chief strategist and current conservative podcaster, Steve Bannon, has endorsed the president for a 2028 presidential run, per NPR.

The storied broadcaster was launched in 1942 to counter Nazi propaganda, but two weeks ago president Donald Trump usurped Congress' authority and signed an executive order effectively shutting down the taxpayer funded broadcaster for what the White House calls \"radical propaganda.\" Friday, a federal judge put any further actions by the administration on hold. Over the decades VOA has projected American values globally, and for hundreds of millions it was the place to find fact-based news about America and the world in their own languages. It all came crashing down in a single day.Steve Herman: When I heard that 1,300 of my colleagues had been suspended immediately with pay in an email saying that they couldn't do any more work, couldn't go into the building, I knew at that point the Voice of America was gonna die very quickly. Steve Herman is chief national correspondent for Voice of America and perhaps its best-known journalist. Americans may not recognize him since VOA is prohibited by law from broadcasting in the United States.Steve Herman: People say, \"Oh, international broadcasting, it's archaic, it's obsolete.\" Why are the Chinese spending so much money and, and broadcasting in dozens of languages over radio and setting up all these TV services? You know, are they wasting their money? I don't think so. VOA is probably the best bang for our buck that we have in terms of public diplomacy. After joining VOA in 2002 as a Tokyo-based foreign correspondent, Herman spent the next 15 years covering the globe for America's flagship international broadcaster before landing at the White House in 2017. He told us he decided to take the job as a federal employee because of VOA's charter, which requires accurate, objective reporting and sets a firewall to protect the editorial independence of its reporters from political meddling.Steve Herman: I've met people, even in North Korea, who have said, when they first started listening to it and they heard it's from the United States, that it must be propaganda. Because that's what their broadcasters do. And then they heard us talking about America, warts and all. And they also heard us reporting about their own country, and telling them things that they could verify with their own eyes, that their own media wasn't telling them. And a light bulb goes off when they realize what it is like with the media in the United States. That you can criticize your own government, have opposition politicians on the air. That doesn't happen everywhere in the world.Patsy Widakuswara: Our mandate was never to present the administration's story. Our mandate was always to present America's story.Patsy Widakuswara is VOA's White House bureau chief. A native of Indonesia, she started working for VOA in its Indonesian service in 2003. Growing up under the dictatorship of President Suharto, she understands the value of VOA. Bill Whitaker: What's the size of the audience?Patsy Widakuswara: All around the world, it is 360 million weekly unduplicated.Bill Whitaker: Listening and watching VOA?Patsy Widakuswara: Multi-platform television, radio, digital, social media. And 86% of its worldwide audience tell pollsters they find VOA trustworthy. Two weeks ago, those millions of viewers and listeners were getting daily news in 49 languages.Turn on VOA today, you get this... on a loop.Steve Herman: Bill, you and I have both been in a lotta countries. And if you're in a country and all of a sudden television or radio switches from regular programming to music, you know something's up.Bill Whitaker: So what do you think that says to your listeners and viewers?Steve Herman: I think it would make them wonder, \"What the hell is going on in the United States?The Voice of America spoke its first words during World War II, beaming German language broadcasts into Nazi Germany to counter Hitler's propaganda machine. During the Cold War it expanded in Eastern Europe, the Soviet Union and China to challenge communist disinformation with straight-forward reporting on American life and politics – our highs and lows, an approach President John F. Kennedy praised at VOA's 20th anniversary. President John F. Kennedy: We compete with other means of communication, of those who are our adversaries who tell only the good stories. But the things that go bad in America, you must tell that also.With bipartisan support, VOA grew to spread American news and values across the globe.President Ronald Reagan: My fellow Americans and fellow citizens of the world, this is Ronald Reagan, President of the United States, speaking to you live from the broadcast studios of the Voice of America in Washington, D.C.VOA told the Chinese people about the military crackdown on pro-democracy demonstrators in Tiananmen Square and the deadly COVID outbreak in Wuhan when their own government wouldn't. It beamed reports into Iran about the democracy protests in 2009, it told the people of North Korea about their government's gulags and Russians about atrocities in Ukraine. VOA has been supported by every president since 1942 – Republican and Democrat … all but one. President Trump: If you heard what's coming out of the Voice of America, it's disgusting. What things they say are disgusting toward our country.That was President Trump in 2020. He complained VOA's coverage of the COVID epidemic parroted Chinese propaganda. Two weeks ago, the White House released a statement called \"The Voice of Radical America\" listing a dozen specific grievances, like VOA reports on white privilege, transgender migrants and Hunter Biden's laptop.Kari Lake: They've got national security risks inside this agency. The rot is so bad it's like having a rotten fish and trying to find the little portion you can eat. It's, it's unsalvageable right now.In February, President Trump installed Kari Lake of Arizona, a former TV anchor who lost two statewide political races, as senior advisor at the Agency for Global Media, the entity that oversees VOA and its sister services covering Europe, Asia, the Middle East and Cuba. She says they've grown too large.Kari Lake: We are going to be slimming this agency down, way down, it's going on a Ozempic diet.VOA's budget is $267 million a year. Lake is now moving to implement President Trump's executive order to eliminate the broadcaster to the \"maximum extent consistent with applicable law.\"We asked Lake for an interview to discuss her findings and plans for VOA. She declined, responding: \"I won't do an interview with a disreputable news outlet like 60 Minutes.\" The president has a well-known animus toward the press, but he seems to hold special disdain for Voice of America. Under his administrations, Steve Herman has been investigated twice for his copious social media posts, including this link to a critic of the dismantling of USAID, which one senior administration official suggested was treasonous.Bill Whitaker: What do you say to people who would say that your Twitter activity, your social media activity, as foreign service officer, technically part of the government, that perhaps you shouldn't be criticizing the president?Steve Herman: I wasn't criticizing the president. I wasn't criticizing his policies. I was quoting people who didn't like those policies. But I also put out what the president says, verbatim. I put out links to the president's executive orders. Does that mean that I'm supporting or praising those statements or policies? No. And I think any reasonable observer understands that. On the 12th of this month, Patsy Widakuswara – working her White House beat – asked the prime minister of Ireland a question President Trump found impertinent.Patsy Widakuswara: What about the president's plan to expel Palestinians out of Gaza? Are you discussing that with him and giving him your position?President Trump: Nobody's expelling any Palestinians. I don't know... Who are you with? Patsy Widakuswara: I'm with Voice of America, sir. President Trump: Oh, no wonder. Voice of America.Bill Whitaker: So when the President turns around and says, \"Who are you with,\" what'd you think?Patsy Widakuswara: Honestly, my heart sank a little bit. Two days later the president signed that executive order all but eliminating VOA. In following days, Kari Lake suspended hundreds of journalists, banned them from the building, and halted transmissions overseas. For the first time in 83 years, the Voice of America was silenced. Bill Whitaker: You think your question had anything to do with that?Patsy Widakuswara: I think it's impossible for me to know the answer to that question. This is happening to all federal agencies. Honestly, when I was at the Oval Office, it was-- it was just my reporter's instinct and I wasn't thinking about anything else. It was just...Bill Whitaker: Just doing your job.Patsy Widakuswara: Two world leaders in front of me. What am I going to do if not ask the questions?Steve Herman questions whether the president's executive action is legal. Steve Herman: There are those who want to make the Voice of America the voice of the president. Now, that's not up to the executive branch of government. That's up to the Congress. We're following the laws that Congress passed. Republican Congresswoman Young Kim of California is a South Korean immigrant, a Trump supporter, and a longtime champion of Voice of America and Radio Free Asia.Rep. Young Kim: I encourage President Trump to reconsider his executive order.Kim is one of the only Republican members of Congress to challenge the administration on VOA. Rep. Young Kim: When we are in an information war and we stop broadcasting into those repressive governments and into repressive societies, they're gonna, they are not gonna hear the truth. Why are we ceding our soft power that helps us to stay as a free world leader. We're just playing right into Xi Jinping's hands.Bill Whitaker: Since President Trump's executive order, media in China and Russia have been celebrating.Rep. Young Kim: Oh yeah. [laughs] I'm not surprised.Bill Whitaker: Does that concern you?Rep. Young Kim: That concerns me because we're losing that information war.Bill Whitaker: So we pulled back. Who fills the void?Rep. Young Kim: China. Ayatollahs. Kim Jong Uns. Dictators. And we're not there to counter that disinformation.Patsy Widakuswara is lead plaintiff in a lawsuit seeking to resuscitate VOA, but she fears the damage has already been done.Patsy Widakuswara: If they bring back everybody next week, what kind of newsroom would that be? How can we continue to report without fear or favor with this hanging over us? Would we only have to report on things that pleases the President? It's not something that I signed up for.Produced by Jack Weingart and Graham Messick. Broadcast associate, Mariah Johnson.

Known as Glock switches or auto sears, these small but powerful attachments allow a pistol to fire continuously with a single pull of the triggerâ€”effectively turning it into a machine gun.\nThe push for state-level bans has gained momentum as law enforcement agencies across the country report a sharp increase in the presence of these devices in criminal activity. While federal law already prohibits machine guns and conversion devices, many states are enacting their own stricter laws to enhance enforcement at the local level.\n Here’s why these are getting banned!\nThe movement to ban conversion devices has transcended party lines. In New Mexico, where law enforcement strongly supported new regulations, Democratic Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham signed a law in February making possession of such devices a felony punishable by up to three years in prison. Meanwhile, in Alabama, a deep-red state, Republican Gov. Kay Ivey made banning Glock switches a legislative priority, signing a law this month that imposes penalties of up to 10 years in prison.\nThe legislative push comes as police link conversion devices to a growing number of violent crimes. In Alabama, authorities suspect they were used in a Birmingham mass shooting last September that left four dead and 17 injured.\nWhat Federal Law Says\nUnder federal law, a machine gun is defined as any weapon capable of firing more than one shot per trigger pull, including those modified with conversion devices. The National Firearms Act (NFA) of 1934 and the Firearm Owners’ Protection Act of 1986 effectively ban private ownership of newly manufactured machine guns, with limited exceptions for law enforcement, military use, and certain licensed dealers.\nViolators of federal law face up to 10 years in prison, but state bans provide additional avenues for prosecution, sometimes making it easier to bring cases against offenders.\n A Growing Threat\nLaw enforcement agencies have reported a dramatic rise in the use of machine gun conversion devices. Data from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) shows that:\n- Between 2012 and 2016, authorities confiscated 814 such devices.\n- From 2017 to 2021, that number skyrocketed to 5,454.\n- By October 2024, over 12,360 suspected conversion devices had been seized in just 34 months.\nThe rise in availability has been linked to the ease of manufacturing these devices, particularly through 3D printing and online distribution. States like Florida, Illinois, Texas, Montana, and North Dakota have accounted for nearly half of all recovered auto sears in recent years.\n Gun Control vs. Gun Rights Debate\nGun control advocates argue that stronger laws are necessary to curb the rising threat posed by conversion devices. Groups like Everytown for Gun Safety are now pushing for legislation that would go even furtherâ€”banning the sale of any pistol that can be easily modified into a machine gun.\n“That really puts the pressure where it belongs”on the manufacturers that are making money off of guns that they know can be readily turned into machine guns,” said Nick Suplina, a senior policy official at Everytown.\nSeveral cities and states, including Baltimore, Chicago, Minnesota, and New Jersey, have already filed lawsuits against Glock, arguing that the company’s firearms are too easily modified into fully automatic weapons.\nGun rights groups, however, strongly oppose these measures. Organizations like the National Rifle Association (NRA) and Gun Owners of America (GOA) argue that current federal laws already provide the necessary legal framework to prosecute offenders.\nAidan Johnston, federal affairs director for GOA, went even further, stating that private citizens should have a Second Amendment right to own fully automatic weapons. “Just because you put that on your firearm doesn’t mean that you are a violent criminal or that you necessarily are a dangerous person,” Johnston said. He also cited practical applications, such as using automatic weapons to eliminate large groups of feral hogs that destroy farmland.\nWith New Jersey’s state Senate currently considering new restrictions and similar bills pending in other states, the trend toward banning conversion devices appears to be gaining momentum. At the same time, legal battles over the role of firearm manufacturers in the proliferation of Glock switches are likely to continue.\nALSO READ: Donald Trump Suggests Third Presidential Term, ‘I’m Not Joking’","summary":"The push for state-level bans has gained momentum as law enforcement agencies across the country report a sharp increase in the presence of these devices in criminal activity.","url":"https://www.newsx.com/world/half-of-the-us-states-now-ban-pistol-conversion-devices/","image":"https://www.newsx.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/IMG_4569.webp","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-03-30 23:31:33","author":"Vanshika Tyagi","authors":["Vanshika Tyagi"],"language":"en","source_country":"in","sentiment":-0.116},{"id":305890730,"title":"Most Americans say Trump isn't focused enough on lowering prices, survey finds","text":"Most Americans say President Donald Trump isn't focused enough on lowering costs, a new survey found.In a new CBS News/YouGov survey, which polled 2,609 US adults in late March, 64% of respondents said Trump wasn't focused enough on lowering the prices of goods and services.

The country has hosted talks between the US, Russia and Ukraine as Trump seeks a ceasefire to the war and the White House has singled out the country as a possible participant in the Abraham Accords.\nTrump said earlier this month he would be likely to make his first trip abroad to Saudi Arabia to seal an agreement for Riyadh to invest upwards of US$1 trillion in the US economy, including purchases of military equipment.\nHe said on March 6 he would probably travel there in the next month and a half. He noted the first overseas trip of his first term was to Riyadh in 2017 to announce Saudi investments estimated then to be worth US$350 billion.\nAxios reported the potential trip was discussed in recent weeks between senior US officials and their Saudi counterparts, including on the sidelines of talks about the war in Ukraine, according to sources.\nOne source said April 28 was discussed as a potential date for the visit but was postponed, while an official and a source familiar said the current plan is for Trump to travel to Saudi Arabia in mid-May, according to Axios.\nThe White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\nLast week, Trump vowed more countries will be added to the Abraham Accords, the series of normalisation his administration negotiated between Israel and some Gulf countries during his first term.\nTrump said more countries want to join the accords. While the White House has singled out Saudi Arabia as a possible participant in the accords, the Saudis have qualms about Israel due to the Gaza war.","summary":"Saudi Arabia has been taking a more prominent role in US foreign policy.

Guests included film star Woody Harrelson and TV presenter Claudia Winkleman. \nHowever the pair split just 14 months later - though she claims it was over almost immediately after saying 'I do'.\n'We had been married for 12 hours when our whole world fell apart,' she explained. 'He relapsed on the way to our honeymoon. It wasn't a great sign.'\nCharlotte, now 25, met Luke – a self-confessed recovering drug and alcohol addict – when she was just 18 and he was 33. \nHe encouraged Charlotte to join Narcotics Anonymous, helping to end her addiction to ketamine.\nShe once admitted that she used ketamine so frequently during high school that peers nicknamed her 'K-angel' after the drug. \n\nCharlotte appeared to confirm the relationship after tagging him in her bed in her latest Instagram post last month\n\nThe couple also exchanged a set of flirty messages in the comments as Isaak asked: 'Is this a date?'\n\nCharlotte previously married British rapper Luke Storey - 15 years her senior - in 2022, however the pair split 14 months later \n\nIsaak (middle left) pictured in Stuck In The Middle back in 2016\n\n My marriage to rapper was over in 12 HOURS: Rupert Murdoch's granddaughter, 23, reveals how 'Succession' style wedding turned into ****show \nShe said she struggled to cope with the high-profile scandals involving her family and 'overcompensated' for her glamorous upbringing by rebelling at school.\nCharlotte said she soon realised that recovery would play a big part in her marriage. \nShe said: 'It felt like there were three people in the relationship – me and him and our recovery.\n'If our recovery was strong then we were strong, and if it wasn't we were falling apart. We had a great relationship when we were sober, but neither of us could stay sober.\n'The wedding was so public and everyone thought our relationship was amazing.'\nHer new boyfriend Isaak has also has his own battles with addiction, after he told fans in January this year that he's three years sober 'off of, like, pills. But I’m six months sober off of drinking and excess, other things like weed and shrooms.'\nHe penned: '2 years ago today, I decided to change my life for the better. I encourage anyone struggling to reach out to someone and make that change for yourself, I promise you won’t regret it.' \nIn 2023 he was arrested for an incident - which he says was unrelated to his addiction battle - that made him realise he wanted to make some lifestyle changes. 'I just realised, like, I was still a prisoner under a coping mechanism that wasn’t healthy.'\nRupert MurdochJohn StamosLondonLos Angeles\n\nShare or comment on this article: \nRupert Murdoch's 'wild child' granddaughter Charlotte Freud hard launches her new Hollywood star boyfriend in western-themed photo shoot after marriage breakdown\n\nAdd comment\n\n Share what you think\n\nWorst rated\n\nThe comments below have been moderated in advance.\n\nThe views expressed in the contents above are those of our users and do not necessarily reflect the views of MailOnline.\n\nAdd your comment\n\nEnter your comment\n\nBy posting your comment you agree to our house rules.\n\nSubmit Comment\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual.\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual\n\nWe will automatically post your comment and a link to the news story to your Facebook timeline at the same time it is posted on MailOnline.

Critics have noted that while Musk cuts federal programs, his companies continue to benefit from government contracts, reportedly earning \"$8 million a day from those contracts alone.\"In response to a video posted to X, formerly Twitter, of protesters lying in the street in New York City holding paper made tombstones that read: \"Medicaid cuts killed me,\" \"Death by DOGE bite,\" \"RIP Musk made Trump cut Social Security,\" among other signs, Musk wrote: \"First of all, there are no cuts to Medicaid, Social Security or other entitlements, unless stopping fraud is considered a 'cut.' Second, organizing a campaign to call for the death of someone is illegal. The organizers and funders will be found and prosecuted.\"Trump said in January that his administration would \"love and cherish\" Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid.\"We're not going to do anything with that, unless we can find some abuse or waste,\" he said. \"The people won't be affected. It will only be more effective and better.\"In another X post, Musk shared a video on Sunday of protesters confronting a Cybertruck driver and wrote: \"It is time to arrest those funding the attacks. Arresting their puppets and paid foot-soldiers won't stop the violence.\"The protests have ranged from superficial vandalism such as spray-painting Tesla vehicles to using incendiary devices and setting fire to showrooms and cars.Some of the vandalism has included Nazi symbols in reference to the controversial gesture Musk made at Trump's second inauguration, which many interpreted as a Nazi salute.Musk, however, called the allegation that he did a Nazi salute a \"dirty trick\" by his critics.Meanwhile, Tesla's stock performance has fluctuated significantly in recent months, rising after Trump's election victory but then declining as Musk became more involved in federal government cuts.What People Are SayingProtest organizers on the \"Tesla Takedown\" website wrote: \"Elon Musk is destroying our democracy, and he's using the fortune he built at Tesla to do it. We are taking action at Tesla to stop Musk's illegal coup.\"The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) issued a public warning last week about Telsa vandalism as protests continued: \"These criminal actions appear to have been conducted by lone offenders, and all known incidents occurred at night, making identification and arrest of the actors difficult.\"The bureau added: \"Individuals require little planning to use rudimentary tactics, such as improvised incendiary devices and firearms, and may perceive these attacks as victimless property crimes.\"U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi in a March 18 statement: \"The swarm of violent attacks on Tesla property is nothing short of domestic terrorism. The Department of Justice has already charged several perpetrators with that in mind, including in cases that involve charges with five-year mandatory minimum sentences. We will continue investigations that impose severe consequences on those involved in these attacks, including those operating behind the scenes to coordinate and fund these crimes.\"What Happens NextBen Williamson, assistant director for public affairs at the FBI, confirmed on X last week that the agency is launching a task force to \"crack down on violent Tesla attacks.\"Meanwhile, legal experts will be watching to see if Musk follows through on his vow to pursue legal action against protest organizers.","summary":"The protests were held to hit the Tesla CEO in his wallet as retaliation for widespread cuts he has made to the federal government and its spending through DOGE.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/elon-musk-vows-prosecute-anti-tesla-protest-organizers-2052825","image":"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2617664/tesla-protest.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-03-30 23:09:30","author":"Adeola Adeosun","authors":["Adeola Adeosun"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.087},{"id":305886790,"title":"Trump tariffs: Agriculture is centre stage US-India trade showdown","text":"Why won't India buy even a single bushel of American corn?\n\nThat's the question US Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick raised recently while criticising India's trade policies, taking a swipe at its market restrictions.\n\nIn another interview, Lutnick accused India of blocking US farmers and urged it to open its agricultural market - suggesting quotas or limits as a possible approach.\n\nAgriculture is a key battleground in US President Donald Trump's escalating trade war, with tit-for-tat or reciprocal tariffs set to kick in on 2 April. \n\nTariffs are taxes charged on goods imported from other countries.Trump has repeatedly branded India a \"tariff king\" and a \"big abuser\" of trade ties.\n\nFor years, Washington has pushed for greater access to India's farm sector, seeing it as a major untapped market. But India has fiercely protected it, citing food security, livelihoods and interests of millions of small farmers.\n\nTo be sure, India's transformation from a food-deficient nation to a food-surplus powerhouse is one of its biggest success stories.\n\nIn the 1950s and '60s, the country relied on food aid to feed its population, but a series of agricultural breakthroughs changed that. India became self-sufficient in staples, and became the world's largest milk producer. Rapid growth in horticulture, poultry and aquaculture expanded its food basket.\n\nToday, India is not just feeding its 1.4 billion people but, as the world's eighth-largest agri-produce exporter, also shipping grains, fruits and dairy worldwide.\n\nYet, despite such major gains, Indian agriculture still lags in productivity, infrastructure and market access. Global price volatility and climate change add to the challenge. Crop yields lag far behind the global best. Small landholdings worsen the problem - Indian farmers work with less than a hectare on average, while their American counterparts had over 46 hectares in 2020.\n\nNo surprise then that productivity remains low - agriculture employs nearly half of India's workforce but accounts for just 15% of GDP. In comparison, less than 2% of the US population depends on farming. With limited manufacturing jobs, more people are stuck in low-paying farm work, an unusual trend for a developing country.\n\nThis structural imbalance also shapes India's trade policies. Despite its farm surplus, India keeps tariffs high to shield its farmers from cheap imports. It maintains moderate to high tariffs - ranging from zero to 150% - on farm imports.\n\nThe weighted average tariff - the average duty rate per imported product - in India on US farm products is 37.7%, compared to 5.3% on Indian goods in the US, according to the Delhi-based think tank Global Trade Research Initiative (GTRI).","url":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c204q6n0lzvo","image":"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/cab5/live/e853fcb0-0a38-11f0-97d3-37df2b293ed1.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-03-30 23:09:10","author":"Soutik Biswas","authors":["Soutik Biswas"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.142},{"id":305889448,"title":"Netanyahu to visit Hungary, defying ICC arrest warrant","text":"OCCUPIED JERUSALEM: Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu will travel to Hungary this week, his office said on Sunday, defying an arrest warrant from the International Criminal Court issued over allegations of war crimes in Gaza.\n\nDuring the visit, due to begin on Wednesday and run until Sunday, Netanyahu will meet his Hungarian counterpart Viktor Orban, who invited him in November, soon after the ICC issued the arrest warrant.\n\nOrban said at the time that the warrant would “not be observed”.\n\nAll European Union member states, including Hungary, are members of the ICC, which means they are required to enforce its warrants.

US M&A volume in the first quarter fell 3%, Dealogic data shows.\n\nMeghan Graper, global head of debt capital markets at Barclays, said only $8 billion of acquisition financing is currently in the pipeline for the market, compared with roughly $100 billion at the same point last year, the lowest since June 2020.\n\nOverall, investment-grade bond issuance volumes were expected to average $1.65 trillion in 2025, some $150 billion more than a year earlier, according to Informa Global Markets.\n\nDaniel Botoff, RBC Capital Markets global head of debt capital markets, said he had expected some 20% of issuance volumes this year to comprise M&A financing. “But that expectation is looking optimistic,” he said.\n\nSome bankers and analysts said the lower issuance to finance deals could put tightening pressure on credit spreads, the premium over Treasuries that issuers pay to investors. If the M&A slump continues, experts said it could also hit banks’ bottom lines, potentially leading to job losses in the industry.\n\nDaniel Krieter, a strategist at BMO Capital, said he now expects overall investment-grade volumes for the year to end up closer to $1.5 trillion, the same as in 2024, the second-busiest year ever for issuance.\n\nBut that volume of issuance may not be enough to satisfy investors who are expected to be flush with cash.\n\nInvestors will get back nearly $1 trillion this year - which is unusually high - in interest payments and as bonds mature. Most of that amount is expected to be reinvested, according to a JP Morgan research note and analyst estimates.\n\nThis will be on top of the already-persistent investor demand to lock in the high yields on the highest-rated bonds before expected cuts in US interest rates this year.\n\nCredit spreads have tightened nearly 6 basis points since touching their widest levels for the year in March when markets turned volatile, according to ICE BAML data. But at 91 basis points, they are only 14 basis points away from their lowest levels in over a decade.\n\nWithout a burst of bond issuance to fund M&A activity, spreads may remain at these tight levels or narrow further even if the economy slows and risk in these bonds increases.\n\n“Growth is almost certain to slow as a result of Trump’s trade and tariff policies but a recession appears unlikely in the medium term,” said Edward Marrinan, macro credit strategist at SMBC Nikko Securities.\n\n“We do not expect credit spreads to move materially wider from current levels — unless our view on recession changes,” said Marrinan.\n\nThe comedown in expectations of issuance has been dramatic. At one point in the first quarter it looked like they were on the right track with some big deals announced. In March, for example, nearly $49 billion was raised by investment-grade companies to fund acquisitions, including a $26 billion eight-part bond offering by candy giant Mars to finance its $36 billion takeover of Pringles maker Kellanova – the largest M&A financing in two years - and a $10 billion six-part bond offering by design-software maker Synopsys to support its $35 billion purchase of Ansys.\n\nBut Barclays’ Graper said that trend has not held up and the pipeline has dried.\n\nVolatility is “putting a dampener on dealmaking activity with buyers reluctant to pay what sellers want in an uncertain macro environment,” said Sandeep Desai, co-head of leveraged debt markets for North America at Deutsche Bank.\n\nWith a lag between announcement and financing, the absence of an outsized pipeline already in place does not bode well for the year.\n\n“New M&A that will need financing this year would have to be struck in the next few months,” said Victor Forte, head of investment-grade capital markets and syndicate at Mizuho. “But that progression has been delayed because of the macroeconomic uncertainty.”","summary":"NEW YORK: The pipeline for US high-grade corporate bond issuance to fund mergers has fallen to the lowest levels in five years as President Donald Trump’s trade war deters deals, in what could be a boon for borrowers but a challenge for banks and investors.\n\n\nWall Street had expected the Trump administration’s policies such as deregulation and tax cuts to fuel a resurgence in deal activity and add $250 billion to $300 billion of investment-grade bonds to fund it this year, up from $179 billion in 2024, according to interviews with six debt capital markets bankers.\n\n\nInstead, economic uncertainty due to Trump’s policies, especially the threat of tariffs on US imports, has thrown markets into turmoil, and prompted executives to hit “pause” on deals while they await clarity.

With the threat of more tariffs, “it feels like it (stagflation) is going to be more and more likely of an outcome, in terms of a slower growth and high-cost type of environment,” said Cipolloni.\n\nThe Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) price index increased 0.3% in February, in line with forecasts, after advancing by an unrevised 0.3% in January. In the 12 months through February, prices increased 2.5%, matching January’s rise.\n\nTreasury yields, which move inversely to prices and were already lower on the day, edged higher immediately after the PCE data but then pared back those increases and kept declining.\n\nThe bond rally gained more momentum after the release of a University of Michigan survey showing consumer sentiment dropped in March to a more than two-year low, while long-run inflation expectations topped 4%, double the Fed’s target.\n\n“In theory tariffs should be a one-time price increase, but … consumers are not making that distinction and are assuming these higher prices are going to continue into the future for quite some time,” said Ayako Yoshioka, portfolio consulting director at Wealth Enhancement Group.\n\n“For the bond market the focus really is on the growth scare we’re getting and whether this is going to turn into something else,” she added.\n\nTraders in interest rate futures anticipated a more accommodative Federal Reserve, betting on a total of about 73 basis points in interest rate cuts this year, around 10 basis points more than before the PCE release, according to LSEG data.\n\nSan Francisco Fed President Mary Daly said on Friday she still saw two interest-rate cuts this year as a “reasonable” projection, though the central bank could wait to cut rates to assess how businesses adjust to tariff costs.\n\n“This elevated inflation places the Fed in a challenging position regarding future rate policy,” Matt Stephani, president of Cavanal Hill Investment Management, said in emailed comments.\n\n“While the economy appears solid, business executives are adopting a cautious stance on new investments, largely due to the Trump administration’s aggressive and unpredictable tariff policy,” he said.","summary":"NEW YORK: US Treasury yields tumbled on Friday as investors assessed the likely negative hit on growth from President Donald Trump’s tariffs alongside inflation persistently stuck above the Federal Reserve’s goals.\n\n\nA Commerce Department report showed that the Personal Consumption Expenditures Price Index increased as expected by economists surveyed by Reuters.
