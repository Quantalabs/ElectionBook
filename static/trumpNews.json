AP's earlier story follows below. Also Read | PM Narendra Modi Makes India Shine at World Stage, Tops List of Global Democratic Leaders With 75% Approval; US President Donald Trump Ranks 8th. SURIN, Thailand (AP) — Tens of thousands of people sought refuge on Friday as border fighting between Thailand and Cambodia entered a second day, heightening fears of an extended conflict. The U.N. Security Council held an emergency meeting behind closed doors later Friday in New York, while Malaysia, which chairs the 10-nation regional bloc that includes both countries, called for an end to hostilities and offered to mediate. The council did not issue a statement but a council diplomat said all 15 members called on the parties to deescalate, show restraint and resolve the dispute peacefully. The council also urged the regional bloc, the Association of Southeast Asian Nations known asEAN, to help resolve the border fighting, the diplomat said, speaking on condition of anonymity because the meeting was private. Cambodia's U.N. Ambassador Chhea Keo told reporters afterward that his country, which called for the emergency meeting, “asked for immediate ceasefires, unconditionally, and we also call for the peaceful solution to the dispute.” He responded to accusations that Cambodia attacked Thailand asking how a small country with no air force could attack a much larger country with an army three times its size, stressing, “We do not do that.” UN Security Council urges restraint by both sidesKeo said the Security Council called for both sides to exercise “maximum restraint and resort to diplomatic solution” which is what Cambodia is calling for as well. Asked what he expects next, the ambassador said: “Let's see how the call can be heard by all the members there.” Thailand's U.N. ambassador left the meeting without stopping to talk to reporters. The Thai Health Ministry on Friday said more than 58,000 have fled from villages to temporary shelters in four affected border provinces, while Cambodian authorities said more than 23,000 people have evacuated from areas near the border. The latest flare-up in a long-running border dispute between the two countries has killed at least 19 people in Thailand — mostly civilians —while Cambodia confirmed its first fatality on Friday. Thailand's acting prime minister, Phumtham Wechayachai, said Friday that Cambodia may be guilty of war crimes due to the deaths of civilians and damage caused to a hospital. He said Thailand had exercised the “utmost restraint and patience in the face of provocations and aggression” from Cambodia. Tensions over a disputed border area erupted into fighting after a land mine explosion along the border wounded five Thai soldiers on Wednesday. Clashes break out across border areas The Thai military reported clashes early Friday in multiple areas along the border, including near the ancient Ta Muen Thom temple claimed by both sides. Associated Press reporters near the border could hear sounds of artillery from early morning hours. The Thai army said Cambodian forces had used heavy artillery and Russian-made BM-21 rocket launchers, prompting what Thai officials described as “appropriate supporting fire” in return. Thailand said six of its soldiers and 13 civilians were killed, including children, while 29 soldiers and 30 civilians were wounded. Cambodia's chief official in Oddar Meanchey province, Gen. Khov Ly, said a man died Thursday after a Thai rocket hit a Buddhist pagoda where he was hiding. At least four civilians in the province were also wounded Thursday. The Cambodian Education Ministry claimed that on Friday two Thai rockets had hit a school compound in Oddar Meanchey but caused no injuries. It said all schools in the province have been closed. The Thai army denied it targeted civilian sites in Cambodia, and accused Cambodia of using “human shields” by positioning their weapons near residential areas. Thousands flee villages near border As the fighting intensified, villagers on both sides have been caught in the crossfire, leading many to flee. Around 600 people took shelter at a gymnasium in a university in Surin, Thailand, about 80 kilometers (50 miles) from the border. Evacuees sat in groups, on mats and blankets, and queued for food and drinks. Seamstress Pornpan Sooksai was accompanied by four cats in two fabric carriers. She said she was doing laundry at her home near Ta Muen Thom temple when shelling began Thursday. “I just heard, boom, boom. We already prepared the cages, clothes and everything, so we ran and carried our things to the car. I was frightened, scared,” she recalled. Rattana Meeying, another evacuee, said she had also lived through the 2011 clashes between the two countries but described this flare-up as worse. “Children, old people, were hit out of the blue,\" she said. “I never imagined it would be this violent.” At the nearby Phanom Dong Rak hospital, periodic explosions could be heard Friday, and a military truck arrived with three injured Thai soldiers, including one who had both legs severed. Thursday's shelling shattered windows at one of the hospital's buildings and damaged its roof. In the neighboring Sisaket province, more villagers took their belongings and left homes in a stream of cars, trucks and motorbikes after they received an evacuation order on Friday. Across the border in Cambodia, villages on the outskirts of Oddar Meanchey province were largely deserted. Homes stood locked, while chickens and dogs roamed outside. Some villagers earlier dug holes to create makeshift underground bunkers, covering them with wood, tarpaulin and zinc sheets to shield themselves from shelling. Families with children were seen packing their belongings on home-made tractors to evacuate, though a few men refused to leave. A remote Buddhist temple surrounded by rice fields accommodated several hundred evacuated villagers. Women rested in hammocks, some cradling babies, while children ran about. Makeshift plastic tents were being set up under the trees. Veng Chin, 74, pleaded with both governments to negotiate a settlement “so that I can return to my home and work on the farm.” ASEAN chair calls for calm The conflict marks a rare instance of armed confrontation betweenEAN member countries though Thailand has tangled with Cambodia before over the border and has had sporadic skirmishes with western neighbor Myanmar. Malaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim said Friday that Thailand and Cambodia had agreed to a ceasefire and to withdraw their troops from the border, but requested more time before implementing the action, according to a report by Malaysia's Bernama national news agency. Anwar said he had spoken to both Cambodian leader Hun Manet and Thailand's Phumtham and urged them to open space for “peaceful dialogue and diplomatic resolution,” while offering to have Malaysia facilitate talks. U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres has also called for restraint and urged both countries to resolve disputes through dialogue, according to U.N. deputy spokesman Farhan Haq. It's latest flareup in longstanding border tensions The 800-kilometer (500-mile) frontier between Thailand and Cambodia has been disputed for decades, but past confrontations have been limited and brief. The last major flare-up in 2011 left 20 dead. The current tensions broke out in May when a Cambodian soldier was killed in a confrontation that created a diplomatic rift and roiled Thailand's domestic politics. Things got worse when a land mine wounded five Thai soldiers on Wednesday, leading Bangkok to close the border and expel the Cambodian ambassador. The next day, clashes broke out along the border.

'She was asked maybe about 100 different people, she answered questions about everybody and she didn't hold anything back.'\n\nOver the course of two days, Maxwell and her attorney have spent more than nine hours answering Blanche's questions. \n\nIt's not clear when or if the DOJ will release what was learned in the meetings.\n\nMarkus said Maxwell is grateful to have had the chance to sit-down with Blanche. \n\n'This was the first opportunity she's ever been given to answer questions about what happened,' Markus said. 'The truth will come out about what happened with Mr. Epstein and she's the person whose answering those questions.' \n\nMaxwell is continuing to appeal her sex trafficking conviction. \n\nThe latest effort was opposed by the DOJ last week as she sought for the Supreme Court to take up the case, arguing that she shouldn't have been charged due a 2008 plea deal Epstein struck with the court.\n\nOutside the courthouse in Tallahassee on Friday a plane flew overhead with a banner reading: 'Trump and Bondi are protecting predators.' \n\nMarkus detailed the poor conditions he says his client has experienced over the last five years since Epstein's death in prison on August 10, 2019.\n\nHe said Maxwell was 'treated like an animal' in prison and 'woken up every 15 minutes.","summary":"Maxwell, serving 20 years in prison for her involvement in Epstein's crimes, requested what's known as 'proffer immunity' so that anything she revealed couldn't be used against her.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-14942153/Ghislaine-Maxwell-granted-limited-immunity-deputy-attorney-general.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/07/26/01/100648571-0-image-m-19_1753490861200.jpg","video":"https://videos.dailymail.co.uk/video/mol/2025/07/25/917362138107102960/1024x576_MP4_917362138107102960.mp4","publish_date":"2025-07-26 01:03:54","author":"Editor,Stephen M.

He passed out after the first round, and I asked him to go a second time so I could get a quality tape for my OnlyFans.\"She Said Her OnlyFans Content Is 'Punishment' for Her 'Bad Parents'After her parents found out about her OnlyFans account, Louise declared her adult content is a punishment for them for being \"bad.\"\n\n\"It didn't affect my relationship with my parents much; I never was close with them and didn't like them,\" she admitted. \"If anything, it felt good to rebel and horrify them with my graphic content.\"\n\nWhile she initially told her family she was working as an online influencer, her aunt reportedly realized what the link in her bio actually was.\n\nLouise detailed: \"So she went over to my grandma's house, opened up my OnlyFans page together on my grandma's computer, and paid $9.99 to subscribe. They were horrified that my facial video wasn't a detailed skin care routine but instead a porn video.\"\n\nIn addition to her grandma and aunt, a close male relative with a porn addiction also reportedly subscribed to her OnlyFans page.\n\n\"It couldn't get more depraved than watching our blood family member getting it on… that broke my heart a bit,\" she continued.Louise Revealed a Former High School Teacher Subscribed to Her PageLouise became even more surprised when she found out her former health teacher from high school also subscribed to her OnlyFans account.\n\n\"There was one day he liked every single picture of my butt on Instagram.

Hogan reportedly had a health crisis weeks before his death, though his wife, Sky, denied the reports. She said her husband was \"strong\" and recovering from surgeries. The superstar pro wrestler, whose birth name was Terry Bollea, got his start in Championship Wrestling from Florida (CWF) in the late 1970s before he eventually joined the World Wrestling Federation (WWF) in 1979. However, it wasn’t until his return to the WWF, now the WWE, when he became the superstar that fans came to know. Vince McMahon bought the WWF from his father and chose Hogan to be the main attraction for the company. He started to wrestle when he saved Bob Backlund from an attack by the Wild Samoans. \"Hulkamania\" became the rage from there. FIVE UNFORGETTABLE HULK HOGAN MATCHES THAT DEFINED WRESTLING HISTORY Hogan was a six-time WWE champion, won the Royal Rumble twice and was inducted into the WWE Hall of Fame as an individual in 2005 and as a member of the NWO in 2020.

Beattie was a speechwriter in Trump's first administration who was eventually fired after speaking at a white nationalist conference. \n\nIn a statement, the State Department said that Beattie will be serving a dual role in the administration, maintaining his role at the State Department while also heading the USIP.

Mencken Club's annual conference (named for the late 19th and early 20th century writer who harbored racist views and railed against democracy) alongside white nationalist activist Peter Brimelow. Brimelow is the founder of the website VDare, which has been designated by the Southern Poverty Law Center as a hate group. And in 2024, he posted to social media: \"competent white men must be in charge if you want things to work.\"\n\nBeattie's initial hiring at the State Department alarmed multiple lawmakers. In March, 44 Democratic members of the House of Representatives co-signed a letter to Secretary of State Marco Rubio urging him to fire Beattie, saying his \"racist\" viewpoints made him \"actively dangerous.\" They cited examples of him heaping praise on China's and Russia's authoritarian governments as \"superior to American democracy,\" and lauded Xi Jinping's regime as one that doesn't \"coddle violent third world trash.\"\n\nSimilar to the Corporation for Public Broadcasting (which Trump also recently defunded with the help of Republicans in Congress), the USIP is an independent organization that receives congressional appropriations. According to its 2023 IRS form, Its most recent president was paid more than $365,000 in total annual compensation. Assuming Beattie is keeping his State Department undersecretary salary of roughly $165,000, he could be reaping a taxpayer-funded salary in excess of $500,000 per year.\n\nEarlier this year, Tesla and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) attempted to zero out the USIP's budget and seize its building. However, a federal judge in May ordered all of the USIP's assets be returned to the organization, ruling that DOGE's actions were illegal. Established in 1984 by the late former President Ronald Reagan, the USIP is dedicated to training people in diplomacy and mediation to de-escalate international conflict. Its 15-member board includes the secretaries of state and defense as well as the president of the National Defense University. The other remaining 12 board members are presidential appointees confirmed by the U.S. Senate.\n\nREAD MORE: 'Stay out of it': Former Texas Republican lawmaker blasts Trump's effort to 'rig' midterms\n\nRead Politico's full report by clicking here (subscription required).","summary":"One official in President Donald Trump's administration just got a new job heading up a congressionally funded organization that Trump previously tried to eliminate.\n\nAccording to a Friday report in Politico, Darren Beattie — who is currently the acting undersecretary for public diplomacy and public affairs in the U.S. State Department —  has been named as the acting president of the U.S. Institute of Peace (USIP).

University officials lifted a shelter in place order late Friday afternoon, saying there was still an active investigation and that the main campus in Albuquerque would remain closed. They said students were allowed to eat at the dining hall and return to their dorms but otherwise should avoid the crime scene.

For much of the day, authorities had the area around the student housing complex cordoned off with yellow tape as police vehicles blocked roadways and investigators gathered. The two people shot were inside a dorm building where they had been visiting a student, but they were not students themselves, said Lt. Tim Delgado with the University of New Mexico Police Department. Authorities have yet to release any other details about who was shot. Police had evacuated parts of the campus earlier in the day. “We had a student orientation going so there were like 400 kids in dorms, so we wanted to make sure they were safe,” Delgado said. Officials issued an initial alert just before 3:30 a.m. that a shooting had taken place. Campus police arrived at the Casas del Rio housing center to find two people with gunshot wounds — one dead and the other with non-life-threatening injuries. Another alert asking people to shelter in place was sent out just after 6 a.m. Mikey Beck, who was staying in student housing this week as part of new student orientation, said he heard gunshots overnight and saw what appeared to be an injured person hiding in some bushes. Two other people jumped out of a dorm window and ran, he said. Beck said he was excited to start his freshman year but the incident was disconcerting. “It's really sketchy out here. Just being in Albuquerque is really scary,” he said. Not far from the dorms, a line of university buses waited for students to board, many of them carrying backpacks and pulling small luggage carts with their belongings. The university was conducting a “staged, tactical evacuation,” spokesperson Cinnamon Blair said in an emailed statement. People were told not to move without direction from campus police. The university in central Albuquerque has about 23,000 students during the school year. New students like Beck have been visiting as part of scheduled orientations ahead of the fall semester, which begins in about three weeks. An increased law enforcement presence on and around the campus was planned for coming days, university President Garnett Stokes said in a letter to the campus community. “We understand this incident may be especially distressing for new students and their families who are here this week for orientation,” Garnett wrote. New Mexico's largest city has struggled with violent crime in recent years, particularly among juveniles. District Attorney Sam Bregman, who is running for the Democratic nomination for governor, has called for state lawmakers to do more to address what he describes as a crisis. The plea for legislative action comes amid violence in New Mexico involving young suspects, including a fatal hit-and-run in Albuquerque and a shooting in Las Cruces in March that killed three and wounded 15 others. Prosecutors, law enforcement and Republican lawmakers have pressed Democratic Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham to convene a special legislative session to address the state's crime problem. Despite voicing her disappointment with the Democratic-controlled Legislature at the end of the last session, the governor has not given recent indications that she will be calling lawmakers back to Santa Fe.

We would not be standing here right now - all of us together - if it was not for him.\n\n'So please help us honor him now as we give a 10-bell salute to Terry Bollea - the one and the only, the immortal Hulk Hogan.'\n\nA number of WWE figures looked visibly emotional as the 10-bell salute played out, including his former manager Jimmy Hart, who was seen wiping away tears.\n\nThe likes of Randy Orton, Logan Paul, Charlotte Flair and Cody Rhodes were also seen paying their respects to Hogan on the stage. \n\nSmackDown then ran a heartwarming montage of Hogan's greatest WWE moments, which featured some touching words from a number of his fellow wrestlers.\n\nHart, a WWE Hall of Famer who once served as Hogan's manager, revealed earlier on Friday that he tried to call his close friend the night before his tragic death.\n\nOn Wednesday, he rang Hogan but spoke only to his assistant.

He was talking with the fans. He was just phenomenal.'\n\nBut they did not see each other between Hogan's neck surgery and his death on Thursday. \n\n'It just hits so fast,' Hart told People. 'It was like, \"Oh my God.\" We thought he was doing so well. \n\n'We didn't go to see him at the house and at the hospital, because we wanted to make sure that he didn't get any infections or anything else.' \n\nFloridaHulk HoganWWE\n\nShare or comment on this article:\nHulk Hogan honored by WWE stars in poignant tribute following wrestling legend's sudden death at 71\n\nAdd comment","summary":"Hogan, considered by many as the greatest wrestler in history, passed away on Thursday morning after suffering a cardiac arrest at his home in Clearwater, Florida .","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/wwe/article-14942199/hulk-hogan-death-wwe-tribute-smackdown.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/07/26/01/100648507-0-image-m-65_1753489737346.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-07-26 00:41:58","author":"Editor,Oliver Salt","authors":["Editor","Oliver Salt"],"language":"en","source_country":"jp","sentiment":0.083},{"id":345330272,"title":"World News | India, Maldives Sign 8 Major Pacts Across Finance, Digital, Fisheries Sectors","text":"Male [Maldives], July 26 (ANI): India and the Maldives on Friday exchanged eight key agreements covering a wide range of sectors, including Line of Credit, debt repayment, fisheries, digital transformation, and Unified Payments Interface (UPI), in the presence of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Maldivian President Mohamed Muizzu.\nhttps://x.com/DrSJaishankar/status/1948756664133263510\nAlso Read | PM Modi Maldives Visit: Prime Minister Narendra Modi Continues To Expand 'Ek Ped Maa Ke Naam' Initiative Globally With Tree Plantation (See Pics and Video).\n\"Delighted to exchange eight Agreements related to Line of Credit, debt repayment, FTA, fisheries & aquaculture, digital transformation, pharmacopoeia and UPI in the presence of PM @narendramodi and President @MMuizzu today in Male,\" External Affairs Minister S.

Trump has indicated a desire to dismiss Powell but likely lacks the legal power to do so.\n\nA tense moment occurred when Trump told reporters that the renovation was costing US$3.1 billion ($4.7 billion). Powell, shaking his head, replied, “I haven’t heard that from anybody.”\n\n“You just added in a third building,” Powell said, adding it was a renovation completed five years ago.\n\nTrump went on to ask Powell if he expected additional cost overruns, to which he replied: “Don’t expect them.”\n\nAsked by a reporter what, in his career as a real estate developer, he would do if a project manager went over budget, Trump said: “Generally speaking … I would fire them.”\n\nAccording to Jerome Powell, President Trump mistakenly included the expenses from a finished project when he claimed a budget overrun for the central bank’s headquarters renovation. Source: AAP, AP / Julia Demaree Nikhinson\n\nAnd after the visit, Trump said he did not intend to fire Powell.\n\n“To do so is a big move and I just don’t think it’s necessary,” he told reporters.\n\nElevated by Trump to the top Fed job in 2018 and then reappointed by former president Joe Biden four years later, Powell last met with the president in March when Trump summoned him to the White House to press him to lower rates.\n\nThe visibly tense interaction between the pair comes less than a week before the central bank’s 19 policymakers are due to gather for a two-day rate-setting meeting, where they are widely expected to leave their benchmark interest rate in the 4.25 to 4.50 per cent range.\n\nTrump has repeatedly demanded Powell slash rates by 3 percentage points or more.\n\n“I’d love him to lower interest rates,” Trump said as he wrapped up the tour, as Powell stood by, his face expressionless.\n\n— With reporting by the Agence France-Presse and Reuters news agencies","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nDuring a visit to the Federal Reserve&#8217;s headquarters in Washington, DC, President&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Federal Reserve Chief Fact-Checks Trump in Tense Exchange During Renovation Tour first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/news/au/federal-reserve-chief-fact-checks-trump-in-tense-exchange-during-renovation-tour/","image":"https://images.sbs.com.au/c9/ce/def3fbc24795b7d7afdcb300f455/20250725166225286263-original.jpg?imwidth=1280","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-07-26 00:32:28","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.315},{"id":345330762,"title":"Berdiri teguh atau melutut?","text":"Israel semakin ganas, semakin kejam, semakin buas dan segala macam 'semakin' yang boleh dikaitkan dengan perkara tidak baik (baca: kejahatan). Di Gaza ia terus membunuh dengan senjata di samping membiarkan rakyat Palestin kebuluran. Iran, Yemen, Lubnan, Syria diserang juga. Cukup samseng.\nLantas saya kira lebih banyak sebab dan alasan untuk negara menolak influencer kelahiran Australia, Nick Adams, sebagai duta Amerika Syarikat ke Malaysia. Dia calon Donald Trump. Pencalonannya sehingga kini belum dapat pengesahan Dewan Senat AS namun saya kira sang presiden tidak akan mahu hasratnya terbantut meskipun pelbagai pihak di Malaysia membantah keras. Umum tahu memo bantahan sudah diserah parti politik dan NGO kepada kedutaan AS di Kuala Lumpur.\nTrump mahu Adams mengganti Edgard Kagan, career diplomat yang dihantar pentadbiran Joe Biden pada Mei 2023. Si Adams yang berusia 40 tahun dikenali melalui hantaran media sosial yang mempromosi imej peribadi berdasarkan 'simbol maskulin' stereotaip, selain buat kenyataan bernada Islamofobia dan menyokong Zionisme. Khairy Jamaluddin tempoh hari mengingatkan kita apa yang Adams suarakan secara terbuka, contoh: \"I stand with Israel and prime minister Netanyahu, I stand with Israel not with Islamic terrorists in Iran and Gaza.\"\nAda lagi katanya: \"America should not be accepting any refugees or immigrants who support Hamas and Palestine\" dan \"we don't need to be importing terrorist into our country\".\nBagi saya Adams buta atau membutakan diri terhadap keganasan di Gaza, Tebing Barat serta wilayah Timur Tengah, juga siapa pengganas sebenar dan mengapa tindak balas terjadi. Ini masalah besar orang macam ini dihantar sebagai duta ke Malaysia, kata Khairy pada podcast Keluar Sekejap baru-baru ini. Bak dikata tadi bukan beliau seorang yang melihat Adams sebagai masalah. Perlu dinyatakan yang membantah bukan sahaja orang atau kumpulan Melayu - parti dan NGO bukan Melayu turut tidak mahu Adams.\nPencalonan Adams memang hak Trump tetapi Malaysia sebagai negara merdeka ada hak menolak mana-mana calon diplomatik walaupun tanpa menjelaskan sebab, mengikut Perkara 4 Konvensyen Vienna. Khairy dan semua yang membantah mahu Wisma Putra tidak mengeluarkan apa yang dipanggil 'agreement' untuk memberitahu pencalonan Trump ditolak.\nSehingga kini kerajaan belum buat kenyataan rasmi. Apa pun perlu ditegaskan jika Malaysia menolak pencalonan Trump, kita tahu ia akan mencetus kemarahannya lantas we can expect the possibility of retaliation, kerana bak kata Khairy (yang kita pun tahu), Trump seorang pendendam.\nTidak dinafikan ada dalam kalangan rakyat yang tidak senang dengan dasar pro Palestin dan anti Israel (padahal semakin banyak negara termasuk pro-Tel Aviv dulu sudah mula mengecam Israel). Ada yang persenda Anwar Ibrahim, yang kata mereka mahu jadi atau eloklah jadi presiden Palestin.\nHakikatnya mereka tidak mahu Malaysia menimbulkan kemarahan Trump sekali gus risk incurring his wrath. Bukan pasal isu Adams sahaja. Lebih daripada itu isu tarif yang dikenakan AS.\nUmum tahu 2 April lalu Trump mengumumkan apa yang beliau namakan Liberation Day tariffs ke atas hampir setiap negara di dunia. Malaysia dikenakan tarif 24%. Trump kata boleh runding. Malaysia pun runding diwakili Tengku Zafrul Aziz menteri pelaburan, perdagangan dan industri dengan harapan kadar tarif dikurangkan. Apa yang berlaku sebaliknya. Pada 7 Julai lalu Trump umum tarif import dikenakan ke atas Malaysia ialah 25% - kenaikan 1% daripada tarif sebelumnya bermula 1 Ogos. Malaysia masih ada ruang berunding dan itulah yang Zafrul dan tim sedang lakukan.\nTentunya ramai masih ingat sebaik pengumuman tarif 25% diumumkan AS, orang kuat Bersatu yang juga Ahli Parlimen Tasek Gelugor Wan Saiful Wan Jan mengkritik keras kerajaan kerana katanya gagal menghalang kenaikan tarif terbaharu AS ke atas barangan Malaysia. Beliau menuntut penjelasan sambil menyifatkan keputusan AS itu adalah kerana kegagalan diplomasi dan rundingan pihak kerajaan. Kritikan atau serangan Wan Saiful tidak mendapat traction. Tidak memeranjatkan. Pada hemat saya beliau was just taking cheap shots at the government.\nJika Wan Saiful berusaha cari maklumat seperti apa yang dilakukan oleh Shahril Hamdan, co-host podcast Keluar Sekejap, beliau akan faham apa yang berlaku.\nKata Shahril beliau baca laporan USTR atau US Trade Representative 2025 yang menggariskan sedikit sebanyak apa yang mereka tidak puas hati terhadap setiap negara. Dalam bab Malaysia jelas dihuraikan subsidi eksport yang Malaysia bagi kepada pengeksport kita. Disebut juga digital trade barriers, dan perlindungan sektor kewangan.\n\"Kita punya bank komersil tak boleh melebihi 30% pegangan pemilik asing, cawangan baru bank asing tidak boleh dekat dengan bank tempatan. Contoh HSBC, Standard Chartered cawangan baru mereka tak boleh terlalu dekat dengan Maybank dan CIMB untuk mempertahankan dan mendahulukan bank tempatan,\" kata Shahril.\nAda juga disebut peranan Jakim dalam pensijilan halal barangan import, perolehan kerajaan, isu Bumiputera dan sebagainya. Itu benda-benda yang AS sendiri sebut. \"Ini yang mereka kurang puas hati,\" kata Shahril.\nSemua yang digariskan AS itu dikuatkuasakan negara kerana bagi Malaysia ia baik dan perlu untuk negara, tetapi itu yang AS tidak suka. Bolehlah difahami apa yang AS mahu.\nShahril buat andaian, \"AS minta Malaysia longgarkan benda-benda itu. Ini kita tak buat, Zafrul tak buat, PMX tak buat, dan kalau itu yang berlaku dan kita kena 25% tarif sebab Trump punya world view begitu, its not the worst thing in the world lah. I think we just have to manage.\"\nErtinya beliau is OK with that demi mempertahankan kedaulatan dan maruah negara kerana dunia tak khiamat hanya kerana Malaysia kena 25% tarif.\nSaya setuju. Namun saya akui ada juga dasar negara yang tidak disukai sebahagian rakyat, lantas ada yang perlu diubah untuk kesejahteraan dan keadilan setiap rakyat. Bagaimanapun perubahan mesti dilakukan atas kehendak dan persetujuan rakyat sendiri bukan kerana diugut dan dipaksa kuasa luar.\nMalangnya ada kalangan rakyat yang mahu negara tunduk pada tuntutan AS supaya kita tidak disusahkan. Namun mana-mana negara yang merdeka dan berdaulat akan mempertahankan dasar sendiri yang ia percaya bagus untuk rakyat.\nJelas Malaysia selama ini mahu lakukannya our way.

Saban responded bluntly when questioned on the possibility of his potential return.“No, I’m really happy with what I’m doing right now,” Saban said. “It’s exciting to still be involved in the game.”Saban explained how he's getting fulfilled in the broader role he's taken in the college football world. While working as an analyst on ESPN's College GameDay, the seven-time national champion is also working with stakeholders to ensure a better college football landscape.“It’s exciting for me to work with athletic directors, conference commissioners, people in Congress to preserve the integrity of our game and continue to be able to create opportunities to help young people create value for their future that will help them be successful in their life, which is what we always try to do as a coach.” View this post on Instagram Instagram PostNick Saban claims there's no enticing coaching opportunity Although many in the college football world view Nick Saban’s retirement as final, it may not be. However, Saban made it known that there's no opportunity enticing enough to make him return.“There is no opportunity that I know of right now that would enhance me to go back to coaching,” Saban said. “I enjoy what I’m doing. I did it for 50 years, I loved it. I loved the relationships with the players. I loved the competition.“But it’s another station of life now.

I think it was all to make sure [Skydance head David Ellison, set to become CEO of Paramount when the two companies’ merger closes in early August] were solid spending dad’s money.”\n\nRelated Stories\n\n'South Park' Creators Reveal Network Battle Over Premiere's Trump Penis as They Joke: \"We're Terribly Sorry\"\n\nDissenting FCC Commissioner: Paramount Chose \"Capitulation Over Courage\" In Dealing With Trump\n\n(For much of the video, Letterman refers to Ellison as “the Ellison twins” and “the Oracle boys,” as in the software giant headed by Larry Ellison, David Ellison’s father. Co-host Mary Barclay corrects him at one point, noting that David Ellison is not a twin, but he continues with the bit.)\n\n“If they were losing that kind of money — you’re telling me losing this kind of money happened yesterday?” Letterman continues. “I bet they were losing this money a month ago or six weeks ago. Or they were never losing that kind of money. They did not handle Stephen Colbert, the face of that network, in the way he deserves.”\n\nLetterman’s comments are his first directly addressing the cancellation of The Late Show, which he originated on CBS in 1993 and hosted until 2015. Colbert announced the cancellation on his July 17 show, although The Late Show will continue through the 2025-26 season. Letterman’s YouTube channel, where his conversation with Gaines is posted, earlier this week shared a collection of Late Show clips featuring Letterman lambasting network brass.\n\nLetterman calls the decision “sad” though he jokes that it could be good for Colbert: “For Stephen, I love this, because he gets to be a martyr.”\n\nHe also relates the Late Show cancellation to CBS settling a lawsuit by Donald Trump against 60 Minutes for $16 million over the objections of the show’s staff.\n\n“This is pure cowardice,” Letterman says. “You’re telling me 60 Minutes, the pinnacle of journalistic excellence and integrity for decades … they decided, ‘Aw, we’re sorry, let us give you $20 million.’ I believe this is in the wake of that.”\n\nLetterman closes with one last swipe at CBS and Paramount management. “I think one day, if not today, the people at CBS who have manipulated and handled this are going to be embarrassed,” he says. “This is gutless.”\n\nTHR Newsletters\n\nSign up for THR news straight to your inbox every day\n\n‘Gen V’ Season 2 Trailer Promises Uncovered Secrets, Lots of Blood\n\nThe West Wing\n\nRob Lowe Reveals Milk Carton Prank He Pulled Around ‘West Wing’ Exit\n\nHeat Vision\n\n‘Alien: Earth’ Screens Blockbuster First Episode at Comic-Con\n\n‘Rick and Morty’ Spinoff ‘President Curtis’ a Go at Adult Swim\n\n‘The Walking Dead: Daryl Dixon’ Renewed for Fourth and Final Season at AMC\n\nVince Gilligan and Rhea Seehorn’s Apple Series Has a Title and a Premiere Date\n\nThe Hollywood Reporter is a part of Penske Media Corporation. © 2025 The Hollywood Reporter, LLC.

We hope he exercises that power in the right and just way.”Ghislaine Maxwell’s lawyer, David Markus, discussed a possible presidential pardon with reporters in Tallahassee, Florida on Friday.Maxwell was reportedly granted a form of limited immunity for the two days of interviews with Blanche, unnamed sources told the New York Times.Markus also explained that Maxwell’s appeal to the supreme court was based the fact that “the government at the time promised her, promised Jeffrey Epstein, that any potential co-conspirators would not be prosecuted. And so she deserves that promise.”Markus was referring to a non-prosecution agreement offered to Epstein in 2007, after his initial arrest on charges related to sex with a minor, by the then US attorney the southern district of Florida, Alex Acosta. That agreement, which allowed Epstein to avoid federal charges in exchange for pleading guilty to lesser state crimes and serving just 13 months in jail, outraged the victims, who complained that the government had violated the Crime Victims’ Rights Act when it resolved the federal investigation of Epstein without consulting with them.A 2020 review of the case, published after Trump lost the presidency, by the department of justice’s office of professional responsibility concluded: “Acosta exercised poor judgment by deciding to resolve the federal investigation through the non-prosecution agreement and when he failed to make certain that the state of Florida intended to and would notify victims identified through the federal investigation about the state plea hearing.”Epstein was then indicted in federal court in Manhattan in 2019 and arrested before being found dead in jail, in what was ruled a suicide. Maxwell was arrested a year later and then convicted and sentenced to 20 years in jail in 2022.Her lawyer suggested on Friday that Trump might be sympathetic to the argument that the original non-prosecution agreement should have been honored by the government.“I don’t think that President Trump knows that the justice department took the position that that bargain should not, that promise should not be upheld,” Markus said. “President Trump is the ultimate deal-maker. He knows that a promise made on behalf of the government should bind the government.”“So we’re hoping the supreme court agrees with us that when the US attorney’s office in the southern district of Florida promised that no potential co-conspirators would be prosecuted that that bound the southern district of New York as well,” Maxwell’s lawyer added.While Trump said on Friday that pardoning Maxwell is “something I have not thought about”, and suggested later that “this is no time to be talking about pardons”, his allies in the conservative media have raised the possibility in recent days that Maxwell might “just might be a victim”.When Maxwell was arrested in 2020, Trump acknowledged that he had “met her numerous times over the years”, and offered some words of sympathy. “I just wish her well, frankly,” the president said.Key events43m agoHouse Democrats demand Epstein birthday book that Trump reportedly signed1h agoMaxwell's lawyer suggests Trump might be sympathetic to her case for a pardon2h agoFema offers $608m to states to construct immigrant detention centers3h agoTrump drives past protesters outside his golf resort in Scotland3h agoTrump says 'nothing' remains to work out in trade deal with UK, as Starmer presses for 'full implentation'4h agoFormer justice department lawyer provides corroborative evidence that Emil Bove wilfully defied court orders4h agoTrump says 'good 50-50 chance' of EU trade deal – the 'biggest of them all'4h ago'This is no time to be talking about pardons,' says Trump when pressed about Maxwell4h agoTrump greeted by Scottish secretary5h agoDisgraced former US representative George Santos reports to New Jersey federal prison to serve seven-year fraud sentence6h agoMaxwell's lawyer says Trump's DoJ has not offered clemency as second day of questioning ends8h agoEU's von der Leyen to meet Trump on Sunday as US president says 50/50 chance of trade deal10h agoTrump says he has not thought about pardoning Ghislaine Maxwell - but doesn't rule it out11h agoTrump cites ongoing investigation when asked about Maxwell clemency11h agoDonald Trump expected to be met with wave of protest as he heads to Scotland11h agoDeputy attorney general to hold second meeting with Ghislaine Maxwell today11h agoAnalysis: Trump cranks up distraction machine but focus refuses to budge from Epstein11h agoDemocratic lawmakers seek answers from homeland security head about masked Ice agents12h agoFed says it is 'grateful' for Trump's encouragement to complete renovation13h agoTrump administration reportedly seeks fines from universities including HarvardCalifornia congressmen Ro Khanna and Robert Garcia on Friday sent a formal request to attorneys representing the estate of Jeffrey Epstein, demanding the release of a 2003 “birthday book” that reportedly contains a signed greeting from Donald Trump to the late sex offender.The lawmakers are seeking a “complete and unredacted” copy of the book, which was compiled in 2003 by Ghislaine Maxwell, longtime associate who is serving a 20-year prison sentence for conspiring with Epstein to sexually traffic minors. They have asked for the document to be handed over no later than 10 August.“The public deserves to know the truth and the survivors and their families deserve justice,” said Khanna, who criticized Congress for leaving town without voting on his bipartisan bill to release the Epstein files.Trump is suing the Wall Street Journal for reporting that he contributed a bawdy message and signed drawing to the album, calling the document, said to have been reviewed by federal prosecutors, “fake”.On Thursday, the New York Times published an image of Maxwell’s dedication of the leather-bound album of birthday wishes to Epstein on his 50th birthday from dozens of his friends and associates.Garcia, the top Democrat on the House oversight committee, echoed the call for transparency. “The American people deserve to know who was involved in Epstein’s trafficking network and if they are in positions of power in our government,” he said.The lawmakers’ request comes as Democrats clamor for the release of files from the federal investigations into Epstein – accusing Republicans of attempting to shield Trump from disclosures about his close and well-documented relationship with Epstein, which appeared to end in 2004. House Republicans broke early for an August recess amid uproar over the Epstein controversy.In an interview with the Guardian, Angelica Salas, the president of the Los Angeles-based immigrant rights group CHIRLA, said Senator Alex Padilla’s new bill offered Congress a “simple” way to move past decades of failed negotiations over comprehensive immigration reform.\n She said the old political calculation that had shaped past attempts at an immigration overhaul – increased enforcement in exchange for pathways to legalization – was no longer relevant after Trump’s One Big Beautiful Bill Act turned Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) into the highest-funded law enforcement agency in the federal government.\n “The balance now is completely on the side of enforcement,” she said. “So it’s enough. It’s time to do this.”After decades of pushing for changes to state laws and city ordinances, Salas said there was little more California or Los Angeles could do to protect immigrants without an act of Congress.“We have done everything we can to protect our community,” she said. “And what has happened because of those protections, the federal government has come in to crush us. So we continue to ask more of our elected officials at the state and local level ... but that’s not the solution. The solution is finally to have people legalized in this country, and that’s only an act of Congress.”The proposed legislation, Salas stressed, was simple and would include all immigrants, as opposed to past piecemeal attempts to shield Dreamers or farmworkers. The veteran immigrant rights advocate, herself a naturalized citizen from Mexico, said she was realistic about the hurdles this legislation would face in a Republican-controlled Congress that answers to Trump. But she believes a shift in public sentiment will help.“I ask everybody in this country, so what do you choose? Do you choose what you see on TV where you have men and women being pummeled to the ground, treated as less than human,” Salas said during her public remarks. “Or do you want to update your own law so people can come out of these shadows, out of this fear and into the formal recognition that they deserve? If you can trust them with your child, if you can trust them with your mother and your father, for us to take care of them, if you trust us to feed you, can’t you trust us of the American family?”During a press conference in Los Angeles on Friday, Senator Alex Padilla grew emotional as he thanked the immigrant rights community for their advocacy and their support during what he described as “ long, hard summer for all of us”.In June, as tensions peaked over Trump’s decision to send national guard troops and active-duty marines to LA to quell widespread protests sparked by immigration raids across the city, the Democratic senator was forcibly removed and placed in handcuffs after he attempted to ask a question at a press conference held by Kristi Noem, the homeland security secretary.“Your support over the last six weeks has been so much to me and to my family,” he said, his voice catching with emotion. Padilla was joined by Angelica Salas, the executive director of the immigrant rights organization, CHIRLA, as well as David Huerta, the California labor leader who was arrested while observing the protests and held in detention before being released on bond.Among the speakers were Alejandro Barranco, a Marine veteran whose father, Narcisco, was detained by federal immigration officers while working a landscaping job he had held for more than 30 years; and Hazibi Johnson, whose brother was arrested and detained by Ice agents in June.Barranco, who was deployed to Kabul in 2021 to assist with the US withdrawal from Afghanistan, described his father’s arrest in June and detention, during which he said his father was “locked in a facility with nearly 100 others, no showers, no change of clothes, one toilet”. After being transferred to another facility, he was “forced to go 14 hours without any water, and became ill from the filthy conditions”.His father has been released on bond. But Barranco said: “The trauma that day will never leave him – or us.”Johsnon, whose brother Fermando, a small business owner, was arrested and detained in June, said his absence has shaken her family, especially her eight-year-old son who now panics when he sees black SUVs on the road.“This is what injustice does. It ripples out far beyond the person being detained. It touches children, elders, entire families and communities,” she said. “The fear doesn’t disappear when someone is released. It lingers in the every day lives for those who love them.”The press conference was held at the SEIU local 721 office in downtown LA, just a block from where masked Ice agents raided a Home Depot as part of the first wave of enforcement operations to target day laborers in the city.Salas cited an analysis, based on data from the LA Rapid Response Network, that found recent immigration enforcement activities in Los Angeles county between 6 June to 20 July targeted areas where, on average, 80% of the residents were Latino.“We can show a pattern of racial profiling, of blatant denial of constitutional rights, and a clear message to immigrants and US citizens alike that anyone at any moment could be a target,” she said. Yet Salas said the community remained “defiant”.“Our families are more than tears and fear, we are loving human beings who fight to keep our families together,” she said. “We dream of a better tomorrow for future generations, and we believe in an America that is a multiracial democracy where we are all welcome.”Senator Alex Padilla on Friday unveiled legislation that would amend existing law to allow millions of immigrants to seek legal residency in the US – a long-shot effort by the California Democrat to confront what he called the Trump administration’s “extreme cruelty”.During a press conference at the local SEIU headquarters in downtown Los Angeles, Padilla said he was “not naive” about the odds of passing a sweeping immigration bill with a Republican-controlled legislature and Donald Trump in the White House. But he said public opinion was shifting sharply against the president’s mass deportation agenda and even some Republicans in Congress were starting to speak out about the impact raids and enforcement operations have had on communities and key industries in their states.“The United States of America is not the United States of America without immigrants,” he said, drawing loud cheers from the coalition of labor and immigrant rights advocates in the audience.The bill, which will be formally introduced in the Senate on Monday, proposes a “simple update” to the Immigration Act of 1929 to allow legal residency for immigrants who have lived continuously in the US for seven years and have no criminal record, Padilla said. Advocates said the bill, if passed, could immediately open a path to legalization for as many as 8 million immigrants, including Dreamers, farmworkers and TPS holders.Padilla emphasized that the last time the law was updated was under Republican president Ronald Reagan, who he quoted as having argued that expanding legalization was a “matter of basic fairness” when he signed the amendment into law in 1986.“It creates an opportunity for people to have lived in shadows for too long, to be able to take steps forward, first towards legalization, as a step towards residency and potentially eventually citizenship,” Padilla said. “This is nothing new. It’s not a new bureaucracy, it’s not a new agency, it’s not a new program. It’s simply updating the cut off date.”California congresswoman Zoe Lofgren introduced companion legislation in the House.After Donald Trump reminded everyone on Friday that he is “allowed to” pardon Ghislaine Maxwell, a former associate of his who was convicted of conspiring with Jeffrey Epstein to recruit, groom and sexually abuse girls, Maxwell’s lawyer suggested that Trump might be sympathetic to the argument that her conviction was unjust.“We haven’t spoken to the president, or anybody, about a pardon, just yet,” Maxwell’s lawyer, David Markus, told reporters after her meeting with deputy attorney general Todd Blanche in Tallahassee, Florida.“Listen,” Markus added, “the president said this morning he has the power to do so.

Maxwell was arrested a year later and then convicted and sentenced to 20 years in jail in 2022.Her lawyer suggested on Friday that Trump might be sympathetic to the argument that the original non-prosecution agreement should have been honored by the government.“I don’t think that President Trump knows that the justice department took the position that that bargain should not, that promise should not be upheld,” Markus said. “President Trump is the ultimate deal-maker. He knows that a promise made on behalf of the government should bind the government.”“So we’re hoping the supreme court agrees with us that when the US attorney’s office in the southern district of Florida promised that no potential co-conspirators would be prosecuted that that bound the southern district of New York as well,” Maxwell’s lawyer added.While Trump said on Friday that pardoning Maxwell is “something I have not thought about”, and suggested later that “this is no time to be talking about pardons”, his allies in the conservative media have raised the possibility in recent days that Maxwell might “just might be a victim”.When Maxwell was arrested in 2020, Trump acknowledged that he had “met her numerous times over the years”, and offered some words of sympathy. “I just wish her well, frankly,” the president said.The Federal Emergency Management Agency (Fema) is preparing to send $608m to states to construct immigrant detention centers as part of the Trump administration’s push to expand capacity to hold migrants.The funds from Fema’s “detention support grant program” cover the cost to states and local governments building temporary facilities, according to an agency grant description. The agency has been accepting applications for funding since 9 July and states have until 8 August to apply for the funds, according to the grant description posted online.The Trump administration has been encouraging states to build their own facilities to detain migrants. This program provides a way for the administration to help states pay for it.The funds will be distributed by Fema in partnership with US Customs and Border Protection, according to the agency.Florida’s governor, Ron DeSantis, said on Friday that the state would apply for Fema reimbursement to pay for its new Everglades immigrant detention center it calls “Alligator Alcatraz.”The facility will cost an estimated $450m annually, according to homeland security officials.Kristi Noem, the homeland security secretary, has said her department will tap Fema’s $650m shelter and services program to fund Florida’s facility. Congress during the Biden administration directed the department, which includes Fema, to distribute the money to state and local governments to cover the cost of sheltering migrants.That funding stream was separate from money Congress set aside for Fema to cover disaster relief. “Secretary Noem has been very clear that the funding for Alligator Alcatraz can be a blueprint for other states and local governments to assist with detention,” a Fema spokesperson told Reuters.The grant program began accepting applications just days after lawyers for the department argued in court that the federal government could not be sued over Alligator Alcatraz because no funds from Fema had been used to pay for it and “DHS has not implemented, authorized, directed, or funded Florida’s temporary detention center.”News of the new Fema grants for detention facilities came as Maryland’s Democratic governor, Wes Moore, vowed to take Donald Trump to court after the president denied the governor’s request for Fema disaster assistance relief following massive floods in May, calling it “not warranted”.“It’s an insult to Marylanders and the community still suffering in the aftermath of this storm,” Moore said in a video response to the decision he posted on social media.In recent weeks, Trump has boasted of approving Fema funds to flood victims in Texas and other Republican-run states that voted for him in the 2024 election.Donald Trump has arrived at his Turnberry golf resort on the coast of Ayrshire, in south-west Scotland.His motorcade, escorted by Police Scotland vehicles and ambulance crews, drove past a small group of protesters, and at least one supporter.While Trump has spoken fondly of Scotland, where his mother was born and raised, the country has not always returned his warmth.During a previous visit, in 2018, Trump was greeted at his Turnberry resort by a Greenpeace activist who paraglided directly over his head trailing a banner that read: “Trump: Well Below Par”.Ahead of his visit, one local newspaper, the National, which supports independence for Scotland, ran a preview of the visit with the headline: “Convicted US felon to arrive in Scotland – Republican leader, who was found liable for sexual abuse and defamation, will visit golf courses”.Tomorrow's front page📰Convicted US felon to arrive in Scotland pic.twitter.com/EEwAZaPXgC— The National (@ScotNational) July 24, 2025\n\nIn his remarks to reporters at Prestwick airport earlier, Donald Trump was asked about his scheduled talks with UK prime minister Keir Starmer, which the White House has used to portray his mainly golf-themed trip as a working visit.“Can you explain,” a reporter asked Trump on the tarmac outside Air Force One, “what is missing in the UK deal that you have to work out?”“Nothing,” Trump replied. “I think it’s more of a celebration than a workout. It’s a great deal for both, and we’re going to have a meeting on other things, other than the deal. The deal is concluded.”Trump previously suggested that the talks were to “refine” the US-UK trade deal. Starmer told Bloomberg News in an interview on Thursday that the UK is still pressing for “full implementation” of the deal with the US.The sticking point appears to be that while Trump agreed to cut US tariffs on steel imports from the UK that currently stand at 25%, the tariffs have not yet been lifted.In response to the House ethics committee’s report into Democratic congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez’s attendance of the Met Gala four years ago, her chief of staff, Mike Casca, said:“The Congresswoman appreciates the Committee finding that she made efforts to ensure her compliance with House Rules and sought to act consistently with her ethical requirements as a Member of the House. She accepts the ruling and will remedy the remaining amounts, as she’s done at each step in this process.”The House ethics committee has ordered progressive Democratic congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez to pay nearly $3,000 to resolve an investigation into her attendance of the 2021 Met Gala in New York City.The inquiry began in 2022 following an allegation that Ocasio-Cortez accepted impermissible gifts when she attended the annual gala wearing a white floor-length gown with “Tax the Rich” written on the back.In its bipartisan report released today, the ethics committee determined that despite making “significant attempts” to comply with congressional rules around accepting gifts, Ocasio-Cortez failed to do so “fully” by “impermissibly” accepting free admission to the gala for her partner, and did not pay full market price for some of what she wore to the event.The committee found that a former campaign staff member tried to lower the congresswoman’s costs for attending the gala and made late payments to vendors involved. While it faulted Ocasio-Cortez for not properly supervising the staffer, the committee “did not find evidence that she intended to seek to lower the cost of goods provided to her or to delay payment for those goods and other services received”.The committee determined that they will close the matter and Ocasio-Cortez will not face sanctions if she donates the $250 cost of her partner’s meal, and pays $2,733.28 to the designer from which she rented the dress and accessories.A former Department of Justice lawyer has provided evidence to a justice department watchdog corroborating explosive claims that Emil Bove and other top officials wilfully and knowingly defied court orders, according to Whistleblower Aid, a non-profit representing the person.A top department official and Donald Trump’s former defense attorney, Bove is currently being considered for a lifetime seat on the federal bench.Whistleblower Aid said it was not identifying its client. They said the person had turned over “ substantive, internal DoJ documents” to the justice department’s inspector general. The evidence, the organization said, corroborate allegations from Erez Reuveni, a fired DoJ employee, who has publicly said that Bove told DoJ lawyers to defy the courts.“What we’re seeing here is something I never thought would be possible on such a wide scale: federal prosecutors appointed by the Trump Administration intentionally presenting dubious if not outright false evidence to a court of jurisdiction in cases that impact a person’s fundamental rights not only under our constitution, but their natural rights as humans,” said Andrew Bakaj, chief counsel at Whistleblower Aid.“Our client and Mr Reuveni are true patriots – prioritizing their commitment to democracy over advancing their careers.”Trump also said a trade deal with the European Union would be a big agreement and repeated his view that there was a “good 50-50 chance” for it.“With the European Union, we have a good 50-50 chance,” he told reporters. “That would be the biggest deal of them all if we make it.”He is due to meet with European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen on Sunday to discuss trade.Speaking to reporters at Prestwick airport, Trump denied reports that he was briefed about his name appearing in the Epstein files.Asked about the justice department’s questioning of Ghislaine Maxwell, Trump said: “I don’t know anything about the conversation, I haven’t really been following it.”“A lot of people have been asking me about pardons [for Maxwell]. Obviously, this is no time to be talking about pardons” he went on. “You’re making a very big thing over something that’s not a big thing.”Trump says it's ‘no time to be talking about pardons’ for Ghislaine Maxwell – videoHe then deflects further, suggesting the media should talk about Clinton and the ex-president of Harvard, but “don’t talk about Trump”.The US president was greeted by Scottish secretary Ian Murray as he walked off Air Force One at Prestwick airport.The pair could be seen shaking hands at the bottom of the aircraft stairs before Donald Trump walked across to a group of journalists to answer questions.Air Force One has just landed in Scotland.

Photograph: Tolga Akmen/EPADisgraced former US representative George Santos reported to a federal prison in New Jersey earlier today to begin serving a seven-year sentence for the fraud charges that got him ousted from Congress.The federal Bureau of Prisons confirmed to the Associated Press that the New York Republican was in custody at the Federal Correctional Institution in Fairton, in southern New Jersey.Santos pleaded guilty last summer to federal wire fraud and aggravated identity theft charges for deceiving donors and stealing people’s identities in order to fund his congressional campaign.Lawyers for Santos didn’t respond to phone and email messages seeking comment.George Santos arrives at federal court for sentencing on 25 April. Photograph: Julia Demaree Nikhinson/APThe ever-online Santos, 37, hosted a farewell party for himself on X last night.“Well, darlings … The curtain falls, the spotlight dims, and the rhinestones are packed,” he wrote in a post afterwards. “From the halls of Congress to the chaos of cable news what a ride it’s been! Was it messy? Always. Glamorous? Occasionally. Honest? I tried … most days.”In a Thursday interview with Al Arabiya, a Saudi state-owned news organization, Santos said he’ll serve his sentence in a minimum-security prison “camp” that he described as a “big upgrade” from the medium-security lockup he was initially assigned to.In April, a federal judge declined to give Santos a lighter two-year sentence that he sought, saying she was unconvinced he was truly remorseful. In the weeks before his sentencing, Santos said he was “profoundly sorry” for his crimes, but he also complained frequently that he was a victim of a political witch hunt and prosecutorial overreach.Santos lied extensively about his life story both before and after entering the US Congress, where he was the first openly LGBTQ+ Republican elected to the body. He was ultimately convicted of defrauding donors.He has apparently been holding out hope that his unwavering support for Donald Trump might help him win a last-minute reprieve.\n The White House said this week that it “will not comment on the existence or nonexistence” of any clemency request.A senior justice department official has told NBC News that attorney general Pam Bondi is still healing from a torn cornea, but it has not prevented her from doing day-to-day work and meeting with staff.The update comes after Bondi abruptly canceled a scheduled appearance on Wednesday at CPAC’s anti-trafficking summit in Washington, citing recovery from a health issue.As all the political firestorm over the Epstein saga continues to dominate the news cycle and consume Washington, there has been much online chatter about Bondi’s whereabouts.She was last seen on Tuesday morning swearing in the new DEA administrator Terry Cole at the justice department.NewsNation reports that following the conclusion of the DOJ interviews, David Oscar Markus, Ghislaine Maxwell’s attorney, said they were “very grateful” for the opportunity.Markus said:\n This was a thorough, comprehensive interview by the deputy attorney general. No person and no topic were off-limits. We are very grateful. The truth will come out.\nSome more detail on that from the Tallahassee Democrat.David Oscar Markus, Ghislaine Maxwell’s attorney declined to say whether Donald Trump was the focus of any of the Department of Justice’s questions during the interviewing sessions that have taken place behind closed doors at the federal courthouse in Tallahassee over the last two days.“I’m just not going to talk about the substance,” Markus said.Deputy attorney general Todd Blanche had asked Maxwell “every possible question”, Markus said. “He did a really good job and asked her a lot of things.”David Oscar Markus, attorney for Ghislaine Maxwell, talks with the media outside the federal courthouse in Tallahassee, Florida.

More buildings where people gather after Russian shelling on July 24, 2025 in Kharkiv, Ukraine. Russian army hit a residential area in the Kharkiv centre with two guided bombs. According to the city authorities, one of the hits occurred near a high-rise residential building; people are trapped under the rubble. The second hit was on a civilian enterprise, where a fire broke out. Dozens of people are known to have been injured because of Russian airstrikes on the city. At least 10 houses were damaged because of the hits, and about 15 cars were burning at the site.

Day 1,248.\n\nBetween July 21-24, Russian strikes across Ukraine killed at least 12 civilians and injured more than 120 others. In the eastern Donetsk oblast, or province, systematic shelling and glide bombs killed six non-combatants and wounded 44 others. In northeastern Kharkiv oblast, Russian glide bomb and drone strikes killed at least three residents and injured more than 50 others. In southern Kherson oblast, drone attacks killed two civilians and injured 22 people, including two children, while in the capital, Kyiv, one individual was reported dead, with nine others injured.\n\nGovernment Bid to End Anti-Corruption Agencies' Independence Sparks First Wartime Protests in Ukraine\n\nOn July 22, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy signed controversial legislation that would de facto place the country’s independent anti-corruption bodies under government control. Passed in a rushed parliamentary vote, the law would effectively strip independence from two key institutions established after 2014 to combat corruption: the National Anti-Corruption Bureau of Ukraine (NABU) and the Specialized Anti-Corruption Prosecutor’s Office (SAPO). It brings their investigative functions under the oversight of the prosecutor general, a direct presidential appointee.\n\nCritics of the law argue that the prosecutor general is not a politically neutral figure and could be sensitive to pressure against launching investigations into members of the political elite close to President Zelenskyy. The adoption of the legislation followed raids on NABU offices, which, according to the institution, were carried out without court warrants.\n\nUkrainian government officials defended the new law, citing concerns over Russian influence within NABU, which was allegedly unearthed by Ukraine’s security services. “The anti-corruption infrastructure will work, only without Russian influence – it needs to be cleared of that,” said Volodynyr Zelenskyy in his evening address on Telegram. Civil society, however, widely dismissed these claims, especially since the legislation was backed by lawmakers linked to pro-Russian factions in Ukraine’s parliament.\n\nThe apparent crackdown triggered the largest domestic protests since the start of Russia’s full-scale invasion in February 2022. Three days of peaceful demonstrations erupted in at least 16 Ukrainian cities, including key regional capitals such as Kharkiv, Dnipro and Lviv. The largest protests occurred in Kyiv, with attendance estimated at 1,000 to 5,000 participants. Footage circulated on Ukrainian media showed the main square near Kyiv’s government quarter filled with protesters. One sign read, “My father didn’t die for this,” a rebuke against what many see as the rollback of anti-corruption reforms.\n\nMORE FOR YOU\n\nIn addition to outcry from Ukrainian society, Western allies immediately raised alarms about the law. Ambassadors of the G7 countries in Kyiv issued a joint statement expressing concern; the European Commission spokesperson, meanwhile, warned the law could jeopardize Ukraine’s path toward EU accession since funding from Brussels is “conditional on [Ukraine’s] progress on transparency, judicial reform and democratic government.”\n\nThe legislation was similarly met with concern from U.S. lawmakers. In a rare bipartisan joint statement, U.S. Senators Jeanne Shaheen, a Democrat, and Lindsey Graham, a Republican, applauded Ukraine’s efforts to tackle corruption, even while under Russian attack, and expressed “fear this law undermines much of that [anti-corruption]\n\nprogress and contradicts Ukraine’s tremendous fighting spirit as well as the expectations of its citizens and the international community.”\n\nIn response to strong domestic and international criticism, President Zelenskyy is set to propose a bill that will decrease Russian influence while maintaining the anti-corruption agencies’ independence. NABU has already stated that this bill “restores all procedural powers and guarantees of independence” for the anti-corruption institutions.\n\nUkraine-Russia Peace Talks\n\nRussia and Ukraine agreed to a prisoner exchange during the latest talks in Istanbul, Turkey, on July 23. However, the meeting, which was initiated by Kyiv and lasted less than an hour, failed to yield progress on a ceasefire or a summit between Presidents Vladimir Putin and Volodymyr Zelenskyy. Ukraine’s negotiator, former defense minister Rustem Umerov, proposed such a summit by the end of August and suggested it may also include U.S. President Donald Trump and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan. However, Russia’s lead delegate, Vladimir Medinsky, said such a meeting should only occur to sign an agreement.\n\nThe two sides remain divided on ceasefire terms. Ukraine demands an unconditional halt to fighting; Russia, on the other hand, refuses a ceasefire due its ability to press its current battlefield advantage and a benign stance from President Trump; although his position appears to have shifted somewhat against Russia recently. Despite the stalemate in negotiations, the countries agreed to swap circa 500 prisoners-of-war and plan a larger exchange of 1,200 soldiers soon.\n\nCulture Front.\n\nMisty Copeland Backs New Dance Documentary Set in War-Torn Ukraine\n\nA new documentary executive produced by world-renowned ballerina Misty Copeland premiered Tuesday night at a sold-out screening at Village East by Angelika in New York City. Titled Match in a Haystack, the feature-length film follows a group of Ukrainian female dancers as they attempt to stage their first performance since Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022.\n\nDirected by five-time Emmy Award-winner Joe Hill, Match in a Haystack offers an intimate and urgent portrayal of art as survival — capturing the intersection of war, memory, and creative resistance. The film highlights the physical and emotional journey of artists determined to preserve identity and expression amid destruction.\n\n“This film is a love letter to courage, to movement, and to the enduring role of artistry in the face of crisis,” said Hill during a post-screening Q&A alongside Copeland. The two were joined onstage by producer Stefanie Noll, director of photography Nathaniel Brown, editor Arielle Sherman, and Ukrainian-American composer Katya Richardson, whose original score adds emotional weight to the story.\n\nFollowing its New York premiere, Match in a Haystack is expected to screen at festivals and special events throughout the U.S. and internationally in the coming months.\n\nUkrainian Artists Bring the Sounds of War to Manhattan\n\nUkrainian artist collective Open Group brings the sounds of war to Manhattan’s High Line in their haunting video installation Repeat After Me (2024), screening daily after 5 PM through September 7 at 14th Street.\n\nOriginally presented at the Polish Pavilion of the 2024 Venice Biennale, the work features Ukrainian civilians recalling the sounds of weapons they heard before fleeing their homes—then asking viewers to repeat those sounds back.\n\nFounded in 2012, Open Group’s current members — Yuriy Biley, Pavlo Kovach, and Anton Varga — use collaborative formats to confront political and social rupture.\n\nBy Danylo Nosov, Karina L.

Motivations don’t matter.”\nForbesHorror Thriller ’28 Years Later’ Gets Streaming Date, Report SaysBy Tim Lammers\n\nWhile President Donald Trump and conservatives were at the center of Episode 1’s mockery, Parker and Stone have been known to be an equal opportunity offenders. As such, Sepinwall wrote that viewers shouldn’t be surprised if a future episode lampoons the left.\n\n“Desperate times mean you can’t afford to interrogate the credentials of everyone who takes your side, even if it’s only temporary,” Sepinwall writes in Rolling Stone. “Parker and Stone can be so politically elusive that it wouldn’t be shocking if the next episode had a subplot about AOC [Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez] in a bikini contest, so the duo can once again insist that their chief goal is to play devil’s advocate to whatever the conventional wisdom of the moment is.”\n\nIn his assessment of the South Park Season 27 premiere for The Guardian in the U.K., Stuart Heritage wrote that there could be greater implications for Paramount.\n\n“Sermon on the ‘Mount is a grand dare. If Trump could get $16 million by suing Paramount over an editorially acceptable edit on a news [program], then it stands to reason that he will try to go after a cartoon that depicts him trying to insert his microscopic p---- into Satan,\" Heritage wrote in The Guardian. “And if he does sue, will Paramount risk destroying its already damaged reputation by capitulating yet again?”\nForbesAll ‘Fantastic Four’ Movies Ranked Worst To Best By Rotten Tomatoes CriticsBy Tim Lammers\n\nWhile media outlets celebrated the South Park Season 27 premiere, it managed to attract one major criticism — from the White House.\n\n“This show hasn’t been relevant for over 20 years and is hanging on by a thread with uninspired ideas in a desperate attempt for attention,” White House spokesperson Taylor Rogers said in a statement to media outlets (via Variety). “President Trump has delivered on more promises in just six months than any other president in our country’s history – and no fourth-rate show can derail President Trump’s hot streak.”\n\nSouth Park Season 27 is available on streaming on Paramount+ along with Seasons 1-26.\nForbesSouth Park’s Creators Are Now BillionairesBy Matt Craig\n\nEditorial StandardsReprints & Permissions","summary":"The \"South Park\" Season 27 premiere episode — where creators Trey Parker and Matt Stone take on President Donald Trump — has media outlets buzzing.

Briefing the media on Friday, commerce secretary Sunil Barthwal said product-specific rules of origin have been put in place. These stipulate value-addition norms that don't allow transshipment or third-country benefits.India has safeguarded its sensitive sectors - from dairy, cereals and millets, pulses and vegetables, to high-value items like gold, jewellery, lab-grown diamonds and certain essential oils.Critical energy fuels, marine vessels, worn clothing, and critical polymers and their monofilaments, smartphones, and optical fibres are also excluded.For strategically important products, particularly those where domestic capacity is being built under Make in India and production-linked incentive schemes, concessions are being provided over periods of five, seven and 10 years.Live Events India and the UK signed a Comprehensive Economic Trade Agreement (CETA) on July 24 after years of meetings and consultations.The accord with the UK differs from other free trade agreements as it reflects India's transition to a more mature economy, said Barthwal. India will enter areas that hadn't been touched upon in other trade deals as it transitions to developed country status, he said.'Balancing Strengths and Sensitivities’The accord balances “sensitivities and strengths,” the official said.“We wanted to remove the tag of tariff king and FTA is a way to do that,” Barthwal said. “FTAs bring a lot of certainty and predictability to businesses which this UK FTA will ensure. FTAs are give and take and when we build a narrative, we are sensitive that it’s not one-sided.” US President Donald Trump had referred to India as a tariff king. Barthwal also referred to negotiations with the US and the European Union.“Detailed talks are happening in the EU FTA. Talks with the US are going on — it will fructify,” he said.The India-UK friendship is based on fair play, equity and mutual benefit, the commerce secretary said. “We protected our sensitivities and they protected theirs. This FTA has been a balance of sensitivities and strengths. It’s a complex and comprehensive deal… Our defensive interests have been taken care of,” he said.The UK may take less than a year to ratify the CETA and India will use that time for building the capacity of its exporters and educating them on how to benefit from the accord. The government is conducting an exercise with states and export promotion councils on how they will be impacted.“We are doing granular studies,” he said. India and the UK have agreed to negotiate mutual recognition agreements (MRAs) to facilitate the movement of professionals such as nurses, accountants and architects to Britain. “Non-tariff barriers will be eased, and regulatory systems and MRAs would be improved,” Barthwal said.Scotch, carsBarthwal said that Scotch is a GI (geographical indication) product, and there is always a production limit. The duty on Scotch whisky will be reduced to 40% over 10 years.Limited duty cuts, up to 75% over 10 years, have been offered on other alcoholic beverages, with concessions applicable only above a set minimum import price — $6 for bottled and $5 for bulk whisky. The FTA will help in exports of Indian blended whisky, he added.“Indian malt whisky is blended with imported Scotch. So, when bulk whisky comes, it’s like an intermediate product,” the official said.In terms of market access to automobiles, India has committed to a calibrated, phased, and development-oriented quota-based liberalisation strategy. Under this, a total annual quota of up to 37,000 cars has been provided at a reduced tariff, with a graded structure for both quota and tariffs.No concessions have been given to electric vehicles, hybrids and hydrogen-powered cars in the first five years.(You can now subscribe to our Economic Times WhatsApp channel)\n\nRead More News onIndia UK FTASunil BarthwalMake in IndiaScotch whisky tariffs\n\n(Catch all the Business News, Breaking News, Budget 2025 Events and Latest News Updates on The Economic Times.)

Any Californians here?'\n\nShe then cited the Star-Spangled Banner being written in Baltimore before naming a favorite line from it as she ended the talk. \n\nSocial media - particularly conservatives - pounced at the speech. \n\n'WTF? What's wrong with Nancy Pelosi, is she intoxicated? Gibberish and more gibberish! I don't think the audience can even understand what she is saying. One of the premier faces of the Democrat Party,' wrote Eric Daugherty. \n\nAnother took on the content of Pelosi's speech: 'What about the hundreds of millions SHE has made trading stocks of those companies based on insider information?'\n\nOne compared the address to a fellow California politician's speech patterns: 'She drank Kamala’s lemonade.'\n\nAnother succinctly demanded: 'Term limits.'\n\nPelosi suffered a fall last December in Europe and underwent hip replacement surgery. \n\nMany branded Congress a 'nursing home' after Pelosi was pictured using her walking frame to get around the floor a month later. \n\nHeading into the 2025 session, the average age of Congress members is 79 days older than last session, at 58.9 years old. \n\nWhile the image of Pelosi has sparked criticism, she is not the oldest serving member of Congress. \n\nDelegate to the House Eleanor Norton holds that title at 88 years old. Hal Rogers is also 87, while Maxine Waters is 86, while Steny Hoyer is 85. \n\n Republican congresswoman Kay Granger was recently found in a dementia care facility after she vanished from work.\n\nA bombshell report in December revealed the 82-year-old Texas Representative, who hadn't cast a vote in the six months prior, was discovered at a memory care facility after reportedly being found wandering lost and confused through her neighborhood, according to an investigation by the Dallas Express.\n\nGranger, who wound up a nearly 30-year career in the House in January, was reportedly living in the $4,000-a-month nursing home for the previous six months.\n\nSenate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, 82, has also faced intense scrutiny after several concerning public episodes where he appeared to freeze mid-sentence.\n\nTo serve in the House, a member must be at least 25 years old, while the age restriction is set at older than 30 in the Senate.\n\nThe retirement age in the United States is 65. \n\nPelosi was an outspoken advocate in 2023 of Supreme Court term limits, arguing that they would help hold the powerful justices 'to account.'\n\nShe has represented San Francisco in Congress for 37 years.","summary":"Addressing Gen Z activists at the Voters of Tomorrow summit in Washington, Pelosi attempted to diagnose problems she saw regarding income inequality.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-14941963/Nancy-Pelosi-bizarre-rambling-speech-intoxication-claims.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/07/26/00/100647817-0-image-a-7_1753486044193.jpg","video":"https://videos.dailymail.co.uk/video/mol/2025/01/06/2988717170341398741/1024x576_MP4_2988717170341398741.mp4","publish_date":"2025-07-25 23:53:13","author":"Editor,Stephen M.

However, after Trump suggested that Texas Republicans use the special session as a means to conduct a mid-decade redistricting process in order to make the state's congressional map even more favorable to the GOP, Abbott assented.\n\nIn a Friday op-ed for the New York Times, former state representative Burt Solomons — who served in the Texas House of Representatives between 1995 and 2013 and chaired the redistricting committee — said he was \"deeply alarmed\" by his party's special session's redistricting effort. Solomons described the plan as \"an apparent bid to rig the 2026 midterm elections long before the votes are cast.\"\n\nREAD MORE: Trump official brutally mocked after he was saying he was 'not going to tolerate' sick Americans\n\n\"What Mr. Trump wants my former colleagues to do — redistricting now, years ahead of the usual once-per-decade time frame — would erode the public’s already flagging trust in government,\" he wrote. \"The Legislature should stand up against it. The president should stay out of it.\"\n\nSolomons admitted in his op-ed that one hallmark of politics was the party in power conducting the redistricting process in a way that gives them the best advantage until the next U.S. Census, and that he himself sought to expand Republicans' representation when proposing new maps. But he warned that Trump's effort was a bridge too far, saying that a state legislature acting on the whim of a president would \"hasten the end of our federal and state balance of power and of the balance between the three branches of the federal government.\"\n\nTrump's call to redraw Texas' U.S. House map has prompted calls from Democratic officials and activists to do the same in order to balance out any new seats Republicans give themselves, should the Texas legislature carry out Trump's wishes. Sen. Elissa Slotkin (D-Mich.) promised to \"go nuclear\" in her home state should Republicans carve up Democratic seats in Texas. And former Rep. Beto O'Rourke (D-Texas), who represented El Paso before leaving Congress in 2020, warned earlier this week that Democrats in reliably blue states would be participating in unilateral disarmament if they fail to counter what the GOP is doing. He praised California Governor Gavin Newsom (D) for threatening to gerrymander California's congressional districts in favor of Democrats in response to Texas' push, and opined he should move forward with it regardless of what Texas Republicans ultimately do in the ongoing special session.\n\n\"“Not only do I think [Newsom] should do this, I don’t think he should wait for Texas,” O'Rourke told the Center for American Progress. \"Why the f--- are we responding and reacting to the other side instead of taking offense on these things?”\n\nREAD MORE: Trump DOJ sitting on 'more than 100,000 pages' of unreleased Epstein materials: NY Times\n\nClick here to read Solomons' full op-ed in the New York Times (subscription required).","summary":"One former high-ranking Texas Republican state legislator is now coming out forcefully against President Donald Trump's latest push to drastically redraw congressional districts in the Lone Star State.\n\nTexas Governor Greg Abbott initially convened a special session of the legislature in order to address the deadly flooding in Kerr County, Texas.

Maxwell was tried, convicted and sentenced in 2022 for sex trafficking underage girls.\n\nSuch an agreement allowed Maxwell to answer questions from Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche – which her attorneys claimed she did fully – sources close to the matter told ABC.\n\nHer responses to those questions would not be able to be used against her at a later stage, the sources added.\n\nMaxwell, who is serving her 20-year sentence at a federal prison in Tallahassee, Florida, spent a total of nine hours speaking to Blanche about the Epstein case on Thursday and Friday.\n\nAccording to her attorney, David Oscar Markus, Maxwell was “asked about 100 different people” during her interview” and answered “every single question asked of her over the last day and a half.”\n\n“She answered those questions honestly, truthfully, to the best of her ability,” Markus, said. “She was asked about maybe about 100 different people. She answered questions about everybody and she didn't hold anything back.\"\n\n“She never invoked a privilege. She never refused to answer a question. So we’re very proud of her.”\n\nBlanche is interviewing Maxwell at a federal courthouse in Tallahassee to discuss others who may have “committed crimes against victims.”\n\nThe DOJ has enlisted her help as the fallout continues over the so-called “Epstein files,” information allegedly containing details of the associates of the disgraced financier, who died by suicide while awaiting his own trial for sex-trafficking in 2019.\n\nThough Donald Trump previously promised to release all information related to the Epstein files, the president has come under fire after representatives on both sides of the political aisle and even his own stalwart MAGA support base have criticized the handling of the situation by Attorney General Pam Bondi.\n\nBondi has shut down rumors about a so-called “client list” of high-profile individuals who participated in alleged crimes that Epstein committed, with the DoJ and FBI releasing a memo earlier this month saying no such list existed.\n\nRecent reports from CNN and The Wall Street Journal also claimed that Bondi alerted Trump, in early spring, that his name appeared in the Epstein Files. Being mentioned in the files does not suggest any wrongdoing, and hundreds of other people were also named.\n\nThe president has blasted those continuing to obsess over the files and his alleged involvement, blaming the issue on the Democratic party and claiming that the whole thing is a “SCAM.”","url":"https://uk.news.yahoo.com/ghislaine-maxwell-given-limited-immunity-232147906.html","image":"https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/9jmJ64OlpTH.kP2zYscJ4A--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTI0MDA7aD0xNjAwO2NmPXdlYnA-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_independent_577/a77b7030f1815f61c972c9b2d226569f","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-07-25 23:46:12","author":"Mike Bedigan","authors":["Mike Bedigan"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.086},{"id":345321458,"title":"Cramer's week ahead: Fed meeting, nonfarm payrolls, Big Tech earnings","text":"Next week could be a game changer for Wall Street, CNBC's Jim Cramer said. He told investors to pay attention to a slew of market-moving events, including the Federal Reserve's meeting, the latest nonfarm payroll report and earnings tech titans Apple, Amazon, Meta and Microsoft.\n\n\"Next week, no hyperbole, is pivotal. It's significant. I'm willing to make it a free-fire zone of superlatives,\" he said. \"In short, next week determines the market's direction for the duration. Or at least the rest of the summer.\"\n\nOn Monday, Cramer said he'll be paying attention to earnings from Celestica and Whirlpool. Cramer said electronics manufacturer Celestica will give insight into how a number of tech companies are doing. President Donald Trump's tariffs might bode well for home appliance maker Whirlpool, which does substantial manufacturing in the U.S., he continued.\n\nTuesday brings reports from UnitedHealth, Boeing, Procter & Gamble, Starbucks and Visa. Cramer suggested UnitedHealth's cooperation with the government in a probe into its Medicare billing practices is a positive, even though the insurer remains \"an un-investible story.\" Cramer said he hopes Boeing will detail its dealings with the government, and he predicted the stock will head higher.\n\nTo Cramer, Procter & Gamble's business is \"a question of raw costs and tariffs versus marketing muscle,\" but added that he thinks the dollar's weakness abroad is a tailwind for the company. Starbucks will likely reveal plans for its business in China, Cramer said, adding that he thinks the coffee chain will also report improved throughput. According to Cramer, Visa's quarter is usually met with selling because its financials are hard to understand. He said he would be a buyer on the dip.\n\nThe Federal Reserve will meet on Wednesday, and Cramer said he thinks Fed Chair Jerome Powell will express the need for caution with respect to tariff-driven inflation. It's also likely Powell will say he intends to stay in his role until the end of his term next spring, Cramer added.\n\nWednesday also brings earnings from Microsoft and Meta, and Cramer said their stock moves indicate better-than-expected results. Cramer recommended waiting to hear from Microsoft management before making a move on the stock. He said he thinks Meta will report success in advertising, specifically from social media platform Instagram. He also wondered if the company would start charging for messaging program WhatsApp, saying the new revenue stream could be a windfall.\n\nBig Tech earnings continue on Thursday, with Apple and Amazon set to report, and Cramer noted both companies stocks have been climbing steadily. While he said he still believes investors should own, not trade, Apple, he's expecting an \"unexciting quarter\" and a slowdown in growth from its services revenue stream. Cramer said he expects a solid quarter from Amazon, saying he thinks its business segments are performing well, namely its online retail, advertising and web services.\n\nFriday, the Labor Department will release the nonfarm payroll report, which measures employment. Cramer said it would be ideal to see continued growth in hiring and stables wages. President Donald Trump can't \"hector\" Powell to cut rates if wages are higher, he continued. Oil giants Chevron and Exxon Mobil will report Friday, and Cramer said he is unsure about what the latter will say. But he said he expects Chevron to raise its outlook, noting the company just completed its acquisition of Hess after winning a legal battle with Exxon over disputed oil assets.","summary":"CNBC's Jim Cramer explained why he thinks next week could be a game changer for Wall Street.","url":"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/07/25/cramers-week-ahead-fed-meeting-nonfarm-payrolls-big-tech-earnings.html","image":"https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/104580321-IMG_3640r-jim-cramer.jpg?v=1698100863","video":"https://pdl-iphone-cnbc-com.akamaized.net/VCPS/Y2025/M07D25/7000383592/6ED3-MM-A-BLOCK-SHORT-072525_L.mp4","publish_date":"2025-07-25 23:43:31","author":"Julie Coleman","authors":["Julie Coleman"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.352},{"id":345331016,"title":"Social Security makes screeching U-turn on controversial policy","text":"Social Security will continue mailing paper checks — in a major U-turn from a previously announced plan. \n\nThe agency had planned to halt checks after September 30 to cut costs and reduce fraud, shifting entirely to electronic payments. \n\nPaper checks cost about 50 cents to issue, compared with 15 cents for direct deposits, officials said. \n\nBut the agency has now reversed course, saying that it will continue to issue paper checks for Americans who have no other means of getting payments, a spokesperson confirmed to DailyMail.com. \n\nThis includes both recipients of retirement and disability benefits. \n\nDespite the about-face, the agency urged people to switch to direct deposit if they can. \n\n'We will continue to drive down paper check volume, which is less than 1 percent of total,' the spokesperson said.\n\nThe news comes as a grim new forecast this week warned Social Security's retirement fund is set to run short in just seven years — which could end up meaning benefits will be slashed for millions of recipients.\n\nThe check U-turn came after pushback from Massachusetts Democratic Senator Elizabeth Warren. \n\nWarren met with Social Security Commissioner Frank Bisignano on Wednesday and asked about the plan to discontinue paper checks, according to CBS News. \n\n'There are about 600,000 Americans who still receive their paper checks — it's a small fraction of people who receive Social Security payments, but it's a population that often needs checks through paper' instead of through electronic deposit, Warren said.\n\nShe added that Bisignano made a commitment that 'no one would be left behind.'\n\nMillions of Americans are 'unbanked,' which means they do not have a traditional checking or savings account at a bank or credit union. \n\nThe reasons why can vary, from past money mistakes to losing a job or not having enough money to meet minimum balance requirements. \n\nThese people tend to rely on alternative banking services, such as check cashing establishments, in order to access vital funds. \n\nBut paper checks are also more than 16 times more likely to be reported stolen or lost compared to electronic transfers, according to government data. There is also a higher chance that they will be returned deliverable or altered.\n\nAmericans who still receive paper checks but are able to switch can provide a bank account or credit union for direct deposits or an approved pre-paid debit card. \n\nRegistration can be completed at the government's Go Direct website.\n\nThe policy reversal comes after latest forecasts painted a grim picture for the future of the program. \n\nSocial Security's retirement fund is set to run short in just seven years — which could end up slashing benefits for millions of Americans by thousands of dollars a year.\n\nAccording to latest projections, retirees could face automatic 24 percent benefit cuts as early as the end of 2032. \n\nThis means a couple who both worked would receive $18,100 less each year if they retire at the start of 2033.\n\nThe new forecast from the nonpartisan Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget (CRFB), released Thursday, moves up the insolvency date for both Social Security and Medicare trust funds. \n\nA projection just last month had funds lasting until 2033, but that has already been revised. \n\nA major factor is the impact of President Donald Trump's 'Big, Beautiful Bill', which experts warned would speed up the use of funds.","summary":"The Social Security Administration has reversed a policy change which was unpopular with many Americans.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/yourmoney/article-14941357/social-security-reverses-controversial-policy-checks.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/07/25/21/100299077-0-image-m-91_1753475088418.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-07-25 23:43:10","author":"Editor,Tilly Armstrong","authors":["Editor","Tilly Armstrong"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.621},{"id":345319904,"title":"Romeo Beckham and sister Harper Beckham step out in St Tropez on family getaway - as they narrowly avoid Brooklyn and his wife Nicola Peltz amid ongoing rift","text":"Black Friday\n\nKim Kardashian\n\nVictoria Beckham\n\nHarry Styles\n\nAmanda Holden\n\nBritain's Got Talent\n\nPrivacy Policy\n\nFriday, Jul 25th 2025\n\n5-Day Forecast\n\nAdvertisement\n\n'Get your act together': Bullish Donald Trump touches down in Scotland to inaugurate his new golf course and immediately warns Europe it 'won't exist' unless it cracks down on immigration\n\nMy hell in the Gaza tunnels: British hostage Emily Damari tells of being held in a cage like an animal and how a surgeon called 'Dr Hamas' left her in constant pain - and demands: Now let my friends go\n\nCounty lines gangs train youngsters to steal phones instead of running drugs due to booming £70million market and softer sentences if they are caught\n\nBORIS JOHNSON: I've just had private healthcare and here's why I'm not ashamed to admit it\n\nHow Gwyneth told friends Brad Pitt is 'dumber than a sack of s***' and 'has terrible taste in women'.

Email tips@dailymail.com\nBy CAROLINE PEACOCK \n Published:00:17 BST, 26 July 2025 |Updated:00:37 BST, 26 July 2025 \n\nRomeo Beckham and his sister Harper headed out for a low-key dinner in St Tropez on Friday evening during their family holiday to the South of France.\nThe model, 22, and his younger sister, 14, appeared to have narrowly avoided an awkward run-in with brother Brooklyn and his wife, Nicola Peltz, who had recently been spotted in the same celebrity hotspot just last week.\nWhile the family remains at the centre of an ongoing rift with the couple, Romeo and Harper looked relaxed and unfazed as they headed out for a peaceful sunset meal.\nRomeo kept it casual in a white sweatshirt and pink basketball shorts, finishing the look with a red cap worn backwards.\nWhile Harper also embraced laid-back holiday style in a white hoodie, shorts, and beige Birkenstocks.\nJust hours earlier, Romeo was spotted taking a stroll around the French Riviera.\n\nRomeo Beckham and sister Harper headed out for a low-key dinner in Saint-Tropez on Friday evening during their family holiday\n\nThe model, 22, and his younger sister, 14, appeared to have narrowly avoided an awkward run-in with brother Brooklyn and his wife, Nicola Peltz, who had recently been spotted in the same celeb hotspot (pictured Brooklyn and Nicola)\n\nWhile the family remains at the centre of an ongoing rift with the couple, Romeo and Harper looked relaxed and unfazed as they headed out for a peaceful sunset meal\nHe cut a stylish figure in a vintage Brazil Ronaldo football jersey, teamed with camo-print shorts and suede loafers. \nThe nepo baby appeared in good spirits as he wandered through the area before boarding a yacht. \nThe outing come after Brooklyn spent the weekend celebrating his father-in-law Nelson, posing in happy family snaps from the billionaire's 83rd birthday.\nNicola has shared another gushing post about her 'most loving father' after throwing Nelson a lavish birthday party over the weekend.\nThe celebratory photos are the latest blow for David and Victoria, after Brooklyn snubbed his own dad David's 50th birthday.\nBrooklyn looked right at home with his in-laws, happily posing with Nelson and Nicola's brothers at the party held at the Peltz family's huge home in Bedford, New York.\n'Happy birthday dad! i am so lucky to be your daughter, you’re the most loving and supportive father i could ever dream of,' Nicola gushed alongside the party snaps.\n'I love you more than i could ever begin to express - you’re the wind beneath my wings,' the loving tribute continued.\n\nJust hours earlier, Romeo was spotted taking a stroll around the French Riviera\n\nHe cut a stylish figure in a vintage Brazil Ronaldo football jersey\n\nHe teamed the top with camo-print shorts and suede loafers\n\nThe nepo baby appeared in good spirits as he wandered through the area \n\nRomeo seen boarding a yacht\n'i loved celebrating you yesterday! thank you for always being there for us - our constant love and support.'\nDavid and Victoria have reportedly become resigned to the fact that they have become estranged from their beloved son after he failed to attend any of the football ace’s 50th birthday celebrations last month.\nHe also didn't wish either his mum Victoria or dad David a happy birthday on social media - an unusual move for the Beckhams, who are known for their loving posts.\nThis is in stark contrast to a post Brooklyn shared last week for his father-in-law and wrote on a picture of himself and Nicola with the billionaire: 'Happy birthday Nelson x We love you,'\nLast week, it was revealed that Brooklyn and Nicola's Instagram accounts no longer follow his younger brothers Cruz and Romeo in the latest family drama.\nHowever, Brooklyn's friends told MailOnline on Friday that Cruz and Romeo have actually blocked them on the social media platform.\n\nDavid and Victoria seen with their children Brooklyn, Romeo, Cruz and Harper last year before the family feud\nThis would make sense given that Brooklyn and Nicola are still following Victoria and David. \nCruz and Romeo were still following Brooklyn and Nicola earlier this month but appeared to take action after Brooklyn posted a birthday tribute to sister Harper, sharing a family photo without them in it – which Nicola reposted.\n\n Brooklyn Beckham wishes his grandad Ted a happy birthday as Victoria snubs him from family tribute \nThere was much speculation whether Brooklyn would reach out to Harper on her 14th birthday, but despite him doing so, it seems all is not well in the camp.\nBrooklyn's birthday tribute to Harper marked his first public interaction with his family since he paid tribute to his grandmother Sandra on June 26, despite remaining silent and shunning his father's 50th birthday earlier that same month.\nSources close to the family have told MailOnline of their fears that Brooklyn and his wife Nicola have also distanced themselves from Harper after they failed to visit her when they flew into London in May to film an advert for French-Italian clothing brand Moncler just over a mile from the family home in Holland Park.\nDavid and Victoria had no idea whether Brooklyn, who Harper has idolised since she was a little girl, would message her privately or publicly on Instagram because they have no communication with him.\nBrooklyn BeckhamRomeo BeckhamFrance\n\nShare or comment on this article: \nRomeo Beckham and sister Harper Beckham step out in St Tropez on family getaway - as they narrowly avoid Brooklyn and his wife Nicola Peltz amid ongoing rift\n\nAdd comment\n\n Share what you think\n\nWorst rated\n\nThe comments below have not been moderated.\n\nThe views expressed in the contents above are those of our users and do not necessarily reflect the views of MailOnline.\n\nAdd your comment\n\nEnter your comment\n\nBy posting your comment you agree to our house rules.\n\nSubmit Comment\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual.\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual\n\nWe will automatically post your comment and a link to the news story to your Facebook timeline at the same time it is posted on MailOnline.

The President is now at risk of being haunted by the scandal.\n\nIn an attempt to damp down the rising MAGA anger, he instructed the Justice Department to seek publication of testimonies given to grand juries in the Epstein case. He did so knowing no judge was ever likely to grant such a request since the confidentiality of grand jury proceedings (held to determine if a case should go to trial) is rigorously guarded.\n\nThis week, a judge predictably refused the request. For a President who has regularly scolded the judiciary it was amusing to see that sometimes judges do indeed serve a useful purpose.\n\nTrump could not be blamed for the transcripts remaining sealed – but sealed they remained.\n\nTulsi Gabbard, the President’s strange director of national intelligence, was next up in the deflection stakes, with cockamamie claims accusing ex-President Obama of treason during Russia’s efforts to meddle in the 2016 presidential election.\n\nTrump beamed – Gabbard is ‘hot’, he exclaimed – and for a moment the media was intrigued. But when she failed to produce any firm evidence, the media and the MAGA base moved on.\n\nSo back to the Justice Department. The deputy attorney general Todd Blanche was dispatched to Florida this week to interview Ghislaine Maxwell, daughter of the late media robber baron Robert Maxwell. She is spending 20 years in a federal penitentiary for sex trafficking minors on Epstein’s behalf.\n\nThe Trump administration wanted to give the impression it was still serious about bringing fresh facts to light about anyone complicit in Epstein’s crimes.\n\nIf she ‘has information about anyone who has committed crimes against victims’, said the deputy attorney general, who happens to be Trump’s former personal lawyer, ‘then the FBI and the Justice Department will hear what she has to say’.\n\nOthers pointed out that the FBI would have gone down that route multiple times before putting her on trial.\n\nSo Trump reverted to an old song – bashing the independent chairman of the Federal Reserve, Jerome Powell, for not cutting interest rates. This week he attacked him in person for allowing a Fed building to go way over budget. As the cameras rolled he pulled out a piece of paper to prove his case. Turns out Trump had the wrong figures.\n\nEven worse, in a battle for MAGA’s attention the supposed inadequacies of the Fed chairman are no match for the unknown contents of the Epstein files\n\nFresh revelations of Trump’s friendship with Epstein continued to make uncomfortable reading for the President. Even though, in the grand scheme of things, they are of marginal significance, they raise MAGA suspicions that perhaps their hero is not being as forthcoming as he should.\n\nLast week, the Wall Street Journal reported Trump had sent a somewhat inappropriate message and drawing to Epstein on his 50th birthday. The Journal described the drawing as the outline of a naked woman with Trump’s handwritten signature below her waist suggestive of pubic hair.\n\nThe embattled President dismissed the story, inevitably, as ‘fake news’ and sued the paper and proprietor Rupert Murdoch (ironically Trump’s biggest media cheerleader via his TV network Fox News) for $10billion (£7.4billion).\n\nUndeterred, the Journal reported on Wednesday that his attorney general, Pam Bondi, told Trump in May that his name appeared regularly in the Epstein files. It’s hardly a surprise since it’s well-documented the two socialised together in New York and Palm Beach in the 1990s and early 2000s (the friendship ended in some acrimony about 20 years ago, before Epstein’s first conviction for the sexual abuse of a minor). But it was a further embarrassment as Trump had denied being told any such thing by his attorney general.\n\nThen Thursday’s New York Times reported it had seen the list of contributors to Epstein’s 50th birthday book and Trump’s name was on it (as was Peter Mandelson’s, intriguingly). Suddenly the Journal story didn’t look at all like fake news.\n\nEven more suddenly, Trump’s hopes of burying the story were smashed when the first episode in a new season of South Park, the irreverent cartoon series, was aired this week, mercilessly skewering Trump for his Epstein links.\n\nThe White House couldn’t contain its anger, claiming the show had ‘not been relevant for 20 years’. In truth, the Trump-Epstein saga, thanks to South Park, has now entered popular culture. The disillusion of the true believers is palpable. Influential pro-Trump podcasters are turning on the President. One said his reasons for not publishing the Epstein files were ‘insulting our intelligence’. Another claimed Trump is ‘destroying his entire base by just dismissing [the Epstein files] and closing the case’.\n\nA third turned on US Vice President JD Vance for insisting the Epstein files should be released during the campaign then running for cover once in power. ‘What changed?’ he asked dismissively.\n\nMeanwhile, Right-wing commentator Anne Coulter asked: ‘Why is Trump blowing up his base to protect child predators?’\n\nThat said, the reasons why the Justice Department and FBI have determined no further disclosure is appropriate are respectable.\n\n‘Sensitive information relating to the victims [of Epstein] is intertwined throughout the materials,’ they said.\n\n‘This includes specific details such as victim names and likenesses, physical descriptions, places of birth, associates and employment history.’ Much of the evidence is sealed by court order and ‘no further disclosure’ of the Epstein files was ‘appropriate or warranted’.\n\nThe statement was anonymous but comes with the imprimatur of Bondi and Kash Patel, the director of the FBI.\n\nBondi is a Trump sycophant who once boasted intelligence on Epstein was coming in by ‘the truckload’. Patel, another member of the Trump faithful, has long been one of many touting Epstein conspiracy theories.\n\nFor these two to see no purpose in publishing information that would hurt victims should cut some ice with the MAGA base. But it doesn’t.\n\n‘No matter how much success we have had, securing the Border, deporting Criminals, fixing the Economy, Energy Dominance, a Safer World where Iran will not have Nuclear Weapons, it’s never enough for some people,’ Trump whinged this month on social media as it began to dawn on him he’d unleashed forces he can’t control.\n\nUntil very recently it was said the MAGA base would follow wherever Trump led. Bombing Iran, restoring military supplies to Ukraine, recommitting to NATO – they all gave MAGA palpitations but it went along.\n\nNow, on a matter not of great policy but of something far more important to MAGA – a conspiracy theory – there is dissension in the ranks.\n\nAnd even Trump, reaping what he’s sowed, is struggling to contain it.","summary":"The President's MAGA base of true believers refuses to accept the official reasons why the files on the late notorious paedophile can't be made public.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/columnists/article-14940875/Now-South-Park-mocking-Trump-Epstein-knows-hes-facing-scandal-control-ANDREW-NEIL.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/07/25/20/100643497-0-image-m-13_1753471683666.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-07-25 23:35:25","author":"Andrew Neil,Editor","authors":["Andrew Neil","Editor"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.512},{"id":345322914,"title":"World News | Southwest Airlines Flight Headed to Las Vegas Takes Dramatic Plunge in Response to Nearby Aircraft","text":"Las Vegas, Jul 26 (AP) Two Southwest Airlines flight attendants are being treated for injuries after a passenger jet heading to Las Vegas from Southern California took a dramatic plunge shortly after takeoff Friday in response to an alert about a nearby plane, the airline and passengers said.

More economic growth designate; NVIDIA co-founder and CEO Jensen Huang; Founders Fund partner and Varda Space Industries co-founder Delian Asparouhov; and Environmental Protection Agency Administrator (EPA) Lee Zeldin give a standing ovation to U.S. President Donald Trump at the \"Winning the AI Race\" summit.\nGetty Images\n\nAt the Winning AI Race Summit, President Donald Trump delivered a speech combining campaign-style showmanship with concrete policy proposals for America’s future in artificial intelligence. Speaking in his trademark improvisational style, assertive and theatrical, punctuated with rally-style slogans, Trump laid out a private-sector-driven strategy to reassert U.S. dominance in AI.\n\nIt is the start of a “golden age of America,” he said, punctuating the message with chants of “Drill, baby, drill and build, baby, build!” and urging American technology companies to go “all in for America.” The president announced an executive order banning what he called woke AI, a move that immediately sparked debate over the government’s role in shaping the values embedded in AI systems. Additionally, Trump also called for expedited permitting for data centers and energy projects, and launched an initiative to make the U.S. an “AI export powerhouse.”\n\nAn AI Agenda Tailored For The Tech Industry\n\nTrump’s speech outlined the plan to boost America’s AI global standing, empowering private-sector growth through deregulation, incentives and diplomacy for market access. He called for clearer copyright rules that would let AI systems learn from publicly available content without being blocked by licensing restrictions.\n\nHe advocated for a single federal AI regulatory standard. A mix of state laws, he warned, could slow innovation and strain early-stage companies and small businesses. The president made clear that he sees the private sector, not government, as the primary engine of innovation. He said Washington should enable innovation, not interfere with it, and declared his intention to keep bureaucrats “out of the way.”\n\nTrump pledged to accelerate the build of AI infrastructure, including data centers, power plants and semiconductor fabs, via deregulation and expedited permitting. He linked this effort to a broader industrial revival, citing the need for electricians, heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) technicians and construction workers to meet the rising demand. The speech referred to the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, the budget reconciliation bill at the core of Trump's second-term agenda with tax cuts, spending adjustments and a debt ceiling increase. It highlighted its provisions allowing companies to deduct capital expenses upfront to accelerate private investment in infrastructure.\n\nMORE FOR YOU\n\nInternationally, Trump proposed turning the U.S. into an AI export powerhouse of full-stack solutions that include American AI models, applications and the hardware it runs on. The goal is to promote sales to allied nations, backed by diplomatic and trade support from the State and Commerce Departments.\n\nOn energy, he called for an “all of the above” strategy, including coal, oil, gas and nuclear to meet AI’s rapidly growing power demands. According to the Energy Information Administration, China produced more than twice as much energy as the U.S. in 2023. With abundant power generation, China can support large AI factories, even when powered by less energy-efficient chips, such as older generations of Nvidia chips or locally produced semiconductors from Huawei.\n\nTrump vowed to eliminate what he called woke mandates from federally supported AI, criticizing prior policies that tied government funding to diversity goals. President Biden’s industrial strategy for semiconductor manufacturing included language encouraging companies to broaden their hiring pipelines. Under a new executive order, the government would be barred from using systems that incorporate ideological screening or require diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) benchmarks.\n\nLastly, Trump said he would support small tech firms to ensure competition and innovation beyond the dominant platforms, arguing that “the future of AI shouldn’t belong to a few companies alone.”\n\nThe AI Plan Draws Mixed Reactions\n\nCritics of the plan warn that it favors entrenched corporate interests while sidelining democratic safeguards and public accountability. Nicholas Garcia, senior policy counsel at Public Knowledge, calls it “a handout to already-entrenched, powerful tech companies”.\n\nThe plan’s emphasis on deregulation and expedited permitting has raised alarm among environmental advocates, who point to the potential climate impact of large-scale data centers and fossil fuel-heavy power generation. Civil society organizations created the “People’s AI Action Plan,” a manifesto stating that “We can't let Big Tech and Big Oil lobbyists write the rules for AI and our economy at the expense of our freedom and equality.”\n\nCivil liberties groups are also sounding the alarm. The ban on woke AI and the proposed removal of misinformation safeguards have drawn criticism from speech and privacy experts. The Electronic Privacy Information Center said the move is “placing business interests ahead of consumer protection.”\n\n“The government’s interest in only supporting AI that upholds free speech gives me pause,” said Manasi Vartak, chief AI architect at Cloudera. “In an age of misinformation and where AIs are becoming a key source of information, this banner of free speech can easily be misused.” At the same time, she praised the “support for open-source and open-weight models and datasets, which are essential for innovation and for continuing research.”\n\nThe Politics Of AI Policy\n\nTrump’s AI strategy uses a familiar Silicon Valley formula: deregulate, invest in infrastructure and trust the market to deliver.\n\nWhile the plan is ambitious, much of it remains a framework, leaving federal agencies and Congress to fill in the details. Whether it can move from rally to policy will depend on engagement from civil society, which, until now, has remained at the margin of the administration’s approach. As agencies begin translating priorities into rules and funding decisions, implementation could drift into partisan favoritism.\n\nBut the moment also opens space for new types of governance that move past the usual tug-of-war between regulation and laissez-faire. Policy experts are calling for governance models that pair public-private collaboration with independent audits and oversight systems designed to evolve with the fast-changing AI tools. A report by Fathom, an independent nonprofit, reminds that “no matter how well-intentioned any government’s efforts might be, the reality is that direct government regulation simply cannot keep up with the pace of innovation. Worse yet, it might suffocate it.”\n\nHow the plan plays out will influence U.S. competitiveness and the rules that shape AI worldwide. As other nations advance their AI strategies, Trump's private-sector-first emphasis will be tested. The plan positions the U.S. for leadership in technology, innovation and global adoption. But its success will ultimately depend on whether people around the world trust and use American-made AI.\n\nEditorial StandardsReprints & Permissions","summary":"Trump’s AI Action Plan blends industry deregulation, infrastructure, and culture war messaging sparking global debate over trust in U.S.-made AI.","url":"https://www.forbes.com/sites/paulocarvao/2025/07/25/ai-action-plan-channels-rally-energy-ignites-us-policy-debate/","image":"https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/68841265df92a8d625bc3bab/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-07-25 23:30:46","author":"Contributor,Paulo Carvão","authors":["Contributor","Paulo Carvão"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.064},{"id":345329188,"title":"EXCLUSIVE: Hulk Hogan Funeral Plan War Erupts — Over Whether He'll Be Buried in Suit or Wrestling Spandex","text":"Terry Gene Bollea, better known as Hulk Hogan, once thundered into the ring saying he wanted to go out \"in my boots, brother.\" \n\nNow, as fans and family mourn his passing, RadarOnline.com can reveal a bizarre battle is brewing behind the scenes over whether the wrestling icon will be laid to rest in a suit, or the spandex and bandana that defined him.Hulk's Burial Threads DecisionHogan, 71, died of cardiac arrest on Thursday, July 24, at his Clearwater Beach, Florida, home, according to Clearwater police.

But what is the psychic cost for company?","text":"By DAVID BAUDER\n\nWith this week’s FCC approval, the merger between Paramount Global and Skydance Media is expected to be completed in the coming weeks at a value of $8 billion. The question for the new company is whether the psychic cost is much higher.\n\nIt has been a particularly rough few months at Paramount-owned CBS, where the settlement of a lawsuit regarding “60 Minutes” and announced end of Stephen Colbert’s late-night show has led critics to suggest corporate leaders were bowing to President Donald Trump.\n\nFollowing the Federal Communications Commission approval Thursday, one of the triumvirate of current Paramount leaders, Chris McCarthy, said that he would be leaving the company. McCarthy has been in charge of fading cable properties like MTV, Comedy Central and Nickelodeon, expected to bear the brunt of an estimated $2 billion in cost cuts identified by Skydance leaders.\n\nSkydance head David Ellison is expected to head the new company, and he has identified former NBC Universal executive Jeff Shell as the incoming president.\n\nCBS News’ trajectory will be scrutinized\n\nAfter the merger’s Aug. 7 closing date, the new leaders will be watched most closely for how they deal with CBS News, particularly given the $16 million paid in a settlement of Trump’s complaint that last fall’s “60 Minutes” interview was edited to make opponent Kamala Harris look good. Two news executives — News CEO Wendy McMahon and “60 Minutes” executive producer Bill Owens — resigned due to their opposition to the deal.\n\nThe appointment of respected insider Tanya Simon to replace Owens this week was seen as a positive sign by people at “60 Minutes.”\n\nDays before the FCC’s vote, Paramount agreed to hire an ombudsman at CBS News with the mission of investigating complaints of political bias. “In all respects, Skydance will ensure that CBS’s reporting is fair, unbiased, and fact-based,” Skydance said in a letter to FCC Chairman Brendan Carr.\n\nThe role of an ombudsman, or public editor, who examines a news outlet’s work is often positive — if they are given independence, said Kelly McBride, an ethics expert who has had that role at NPR for five years. “You really want the person to have loyalty only to their own judgment and the journalistic mission of the organization,” she said.\n\nHaving the sole mission of examining bias could be problematic, however. To be fair, a journalist’s work should be closely studied before making that determination, not judged on the basis of one report or passage, she said.\n\nCarr, in an interview with CNBC on Friday, said the role “should go a long way toward restoring America’s trust in media.” Anna Gomez, an FCC commissioner who voted to reject the deal on Thursday, interpreted the arrangement as a way for the government to control journalists.\n\n“They want the news media to report on them in a positive light or in the light that they want,” Gomez told MSNBC. “So they don’t want the media to do their job, which is to hold government to account without fear or favor.”\n\nHow the merger could ripple out across Paramount properties\n\nAccording to published reports, Ellison has explored purchasing The Free Press, a flourishing news site founded by Bari Weiss perhaps best known for a former NPR editor’s study of liberal bias in public broadcasting. An Ellison spokeswoman did not return a message seeking comment on Friday.\n\nColbert’s slow-motion firing — he’ll work until the end of his contract next May — was described by CBS as a financial decision given late-night television’s collapsing economics. Colbert’s relentless lampooning of Trump, and his criticism of the “60 Minutes” settlement, led to suspicion of those motives.\n\n“Was this really financial?” comic Jon Stewart wondered. “Or maybe the path of least resistance for your $8 billion merger was killing a show that you know rankled a fragile and vengeful president?”\n\nStewart’s profane criticism on his own Paramount-owned show may provide its own test for Skydance. “The Daily Show” is one of the few original programs left on Comedy Central, and his contract ends later this year.\n\nIn an odd way, Comedy Central’s “South Park” buttresses CBS’ claim that the Colbert decision was financial, not political. Creators Trey Parker and Matt Stone delivered an episode this week that depicted a naked Trump in bed with the devil. Paramount just signed Parker and Stone to a new $1.5 billion deal that Skydance executives surely cleared; it makes the entire “South Park” library available for streaming on Paramount+. a platform where Colbert’s show doesn’t do nearly as well.\n\nFiguring out what to do with others at Paramount’s cable networks, or even the networks as a whole, will be an early decision for Ellison, son of multibillionaire and Oracle co-founder Larry Ellison.\n\n“There is a clear opportunity to improve Paramount’s growth profile by letting those assets go,” analyst Doug Creutz of TD Securities told investors Friday. “On the other hand, we suspect the Ellisons did not purchase Paramount in order to break it up for parts.”\n\nThe merger also brings together the Paramount movie studio with one of its most regular partners. David Ellison has been one of the industry’s top investors and producers since founding Skydance in 2006.\n\nEllison has a challenge here, too: Years of uncertainty over its future and modest investment in its movie pipeline has shrunk Paramount’s market share to last among the major studios. The Paramount+ streaming service has been a money-loser.\n\nTo revive Paramount, Ellison will look to revamp its streaming operations, leverage its franchises and try to bolster family content.\n\nAP Film Writer Jake Coyle contributed to this report.\n\nDavid Bauder writes about the intersection of media and entertainment for the AP.

U.S. District Judge Leo Sorokin ruled that a nationwide injunction on the Trump administration’s effort to end birthright citizenship that he issued earlier this year and that was granted to more than a dozen states can stand. Sorokin said the ruling was an exception to a recent U.S. Supreme Court ruling that limited lower courts’ ability to issue nationwide injunctions. The issue is expected to return to the Supreme Court. FEDERAL JUDGE BLOCKS TRUMP'S BIRTHRIGHT CITIZENSHIP BAN FOR ALL INFANTS, TESTING LOWER COURT POWERS Trump and the administration \"are entitled to pursue their interpretation of the Fourteenth Amendment, and no doubt the Supreme Court will ultimately settle the question,\" Sorokin wrote in his ruling. \"But in the meantime, for purposes of this lawsuit at this juncture, the Executive Order is unconstitutional.\" The Trump administration has argued that children born in the U.S. to parents in the country illegally and temporarily are not \"subject to the jurisdiction\" of the United States and therefore not entitled to citizenship. Trump signed the birthright citizenship executive order, along with a slew of other orders, on his first day in office in January. UPENDING US BIRTHRIGHT CITIZENSHIP WOULD HAVE DRASTIC NEGATIVE IMPACT, DEFENDERS WARN On Wednesday, the San Francisco-based 9th Circuit Court of Appeals also affirmed the lower court’s nationwide injunction, and, earlier this month, a New Hampshire federal judge issued a ruling prohibiting Trump’s executive order from taking effect nationwide in a new class-action lawsuit. Sorokin disagreed with the Trump administration’s argument that the Supreme Court’s ruling warranted a narrower ruling.

He said he was ready to send a negotiating team to Washington if needed.\n\n\"The senior general acknowledged the president's strong leadership in guiding his country towards national prosperity with the spirit of a true patriot,\" Myanmar state media said at the time.\n\nMin Aung Hlaing also asked Trump \"to reconsider easing and lifting the economic sanctions imposed on Myanmar, as they hinder the shared interests and prosperity of both countries and their peoples.\"\n\nA senior Trump administration official said the decision to lift sanctions was unrelated to the general's letter.\n\nAd Break Coming Up \n\n NEXT StayNext\n\nOffEnglish \n\n 180p288p360p480p540p576p720pHD1080pHDAuto (180p) \n\nAbout ConnatixV599477 \nAbout ConnatixV599477 \n\nContinue watchingafter the adVisit Advertiser websiteGO TO PAGE\n\n\"The decision to lift sanctions reflects a lengthy process that began in the prior administration,\" said the official, speaking on condition of anonymity. \"There is no connection between these decisions and the letter.\"\n\nWhite House spokeswoman Anna Kelly said that sanctions delistings \"were collected over the last year in accordance with standard Treasury course of business.\"\n\nJohn Sifton, Asia advocacy director of Human Rights Watch, called the sanctions move \"extremely worrying.\"\n\n\"The action suggests a major shift is underway in U.S. policy, which had centered on punitive action against Myanmar's military regime,\" he said in emailed comments. Myanmar's military overthrew a democratically elected government in 2021 and has been implicated in crimes against humanity and genocide.\n\nKelly rejected the Human Rights Watch comments as \"fake news,\" and a second senior Trump administration official said the sanctions decisions were not indicative of a broader shift in U.S. policy toward Myanmar.\n\nADDED TO SANCTIONS LIST IN 2022\n\nKT Services & Logistics and Jonathan Myo Kyaw Thaung were added to the sanctions list in January 2022 under the administration of U.S. President Joe Biden in a step timed to mark the first anniversary of the military seizure of power in Myanmar that plunged the country into chaos.\n\nSit Taing Aung and Aung Hlaing Oo were placed on the sanctions list the same year for operating in Myanmar's defence sector. Tin Latt Min, identified as another close associate of the military rulers, was placed on the list in 2024 to mark the third anniversary of the coup.\n\nRepresentative Ami Bera, the top Democrat on the House Foreign Affairs Asia subcommittee, in a statement to Reuters called the decision to lift sanctions against the individuals \"a bad idea\" that \"goes against our values of freedom and democracy.\"\n\nOther U.S. sanctions on Myanmar generals, including on Min Aung Hlaing, remain in place.\n\nMyanmar is one of the world's main sources of sought-after rare earth minerals used in high-tech defense and consumer applications.
