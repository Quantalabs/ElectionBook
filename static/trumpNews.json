Sharing the details in a post on X, it said, \"10 sorties of PLA aircraft and 10 PLAN vessels operating around Taiwan were detected up until 6 a.m. (UTC+8) today, 4 out of 10 sorties crossed the median line and entered Taiwan's northern and southwestern ADIZ. #ROCArmedForces have monitored the situation and responded.\"\nAlso Read | Pakistan-Afghanistan Tension: 6 Civilians Killed, 5 Injured As Pak Military Strikes Residential Homes in Spin Boldak District of Afghanistan.\nhttps://x.com/MoNDefense/status/1987324267826925582?s=20\nEarlier, Taiwan's Ministry of National Defence detected 18 Chinese military aircraft, seven naval vessels and one official ship operating around its territorial waters as of 6 am (local time) on Saturday. As per the MND, of the 18, 10 sorties crossed the median line and entered Taiwan's northern, southwestern and eastern ADIZ.\nAlso Read | 'Couple Having Sex at 90 MPH on German Autobahn' Sparks Chaos; Reckless Drive Nearly Causes Massive Pile-Up, Man Faces Dangerous Driving Charge.\nOn Friday, Taiwan detected 38 sorties of Chinese military aircraft and nine vessels. Of the 38, 31 sorties crossed the median line and entered Taiwan's northern, central and southwestern ADIZ.\nThe median line in the Taiwan Strait serves as an unofficial boundary between Taiwan and China, but Beijing has increasingly violated it in recent years as part of its pressure campaign against Taipei.\nThe latest military movements come amid heightened tensions in the Taiwan Strait, as Beijing continues to conduct near-daily operations around the self-ruled island.\nEarlier this week, US President Donald Trump warned China against any military aggression toward Taiwan, saying Beijing \"knows the consequences\" of such an action.\nIn an interview with CBS after meeting Chinese President Xi Jinping, Trump said, \"You'll find out if it happens, and he understands the answer to that. This never even came up yesterday as a subject... he understands it very well.\n\"Trump declined to reveal his strategy on a potential Taiwan conflict and insisted China \"understands what will happen\" if it attempts any aggression.\nHe added, \"I can't give away my secrets. I don't want to be one of these guys who tells you exactly what's going to happen if something happens. The other side knows, but I'm not somebody who tells you everything because you're asking me a question, but they understand what's going to happen.\" (ANI) (This is an unedited and auto-generated story from Syndicated News feed, LatestLY Staff may not have modified or edited the content body)","summary":"Get latest articles and stories on World at LatestLY.

Email tips@dailymail.com\nBy CODIE BULLEN, SENIOR SHOWBUSINESS REPORTER \n Published:00:00 GMT, 9 November 2025 |Updated:01:14 GMT, 9 November 2025 \n\nThey’re among the most prestigious job vacancies in showbusiness: the two presenting roles on Strictly.\nFans are buzzing with speculation that replacements for Tess Daly and Claudia Winkleman could include Holly Willoughby, Alan Carr or Zoe Ball.\nYet one of the show's longest-serving professionals Katya Jones has revealed she would like her colleague Janette Manrara to take one of the much-desired slots.\nSpeaking to The Mail on Sunday, the Russian dancer, 36, said Janette could ‘understand what the dancers are going through'.\nShe explained: ‘I think Janette would make a better Claudia if I'm honest, because she knows the dancing, she knows what we are going through. But Alan, he would be hilarious with the judges, imagine him with Craig!'\nJanette, 41, was a professional dancer on the show until 2021, before presenting the spin-off show, It Takes Two.\n\nStrictly Come Dancing pro Katya Jones reveals who she thinks should take over from Tess Daly and Claudia Winkleman\n\nTess and Claudia, who have fronted the show together since 2014, announced their departure in an emotional social media video\nJanette would be following in Claudia’s footsteps, who hosted It Takes Two from 2004 before eventually handing the baton over to Zoe Ball in 2012.\nIt's no surprise Janette's name has been bandied around as she is someone who knows the show like the back of her hand, with her odds at 3-1.\nThe Cuban-American star is best known in the UK for her work on the BBC show, which she appeared on from 2013 for eight series.\nAlex Jones, Bradley Walsh, Stacey Dooley, Kevin Clifton, Alex Scott, and Roman Kemp have also been mentioned for the role.\nKatya joined the BBC show in 2016 for its 14th series, and danced her way to victory the following year with Joe McFadden.\nThis year, she is paired with Lewis Cope, who blew the judges away as he received the first 40 of the series for his couple's choice dance to a quick version of Radiohead's Creep.\nBut since week one, the Emmerdale actor, 30, has faced some criticism after his dance background was revealed during the launch show.\nLewis joined Strictly at the last minute after Game of Thrones star Kristian Nairn withdrew due to injury.\n\nThe Russian dancer, 36, has said the best person for the job is Janette Manrara because she would ‘understand what they are going through’\n\n Janette Manrara praises Claudia Winkleman and Tess Daly as she emerges as favourite to host Strictly \nAnd during a pre-recorded segment on the BBC show, Lewis confessed he had been dancing since the age of 10 - even landing a role in Billy Elliot in London's West End.\nHe has now addressed the backlash, telling The Mail on Sunday: 'First of all, the experience I did have was a long time ago, and then I went to train as an actor. I've never trained professionally as a dancer.\n‘It is out of my hands what the viewers think. All I can do is work as hard as I can, and what they decide is up to them. \n'If people watched during rehearsals, people would not call me a professional dancer! I'm head to toe in sweat. It is hard. It takes so much hard work to get to Saturday night.'\nKatya added: 'What we took from the stat is we want to entertain people, we want to give something special to the audience. My job as a professional is to give my celebrity a moment they can treasure forever. I'd like to think that every one of them has something to take away. I can only try every week to create that special routine.\n'I'm not finding it easier or quicker than with any other partner. If anything, I'm finding it harder because I can ask a lot more from him.'\nReflecting on growing up in Hartlepool with his 13 siblings, Lewis left home at just 10 years old to live in London and pursue his career in performing as he admitted he often misses his family, especially his Nanna Dot.\nAnd sure to make his family proud Lewis and his partner Katya Jones brought the house down with the incredible performance full of twists and tricks.\n\nLewis achieved the first 40 of the series as he blew the judges away with his sensational couple's choice dance\n\nLeaving Motsi Mabuse on her feet, Craig Revel Horwood deemed the performance 'Spooktacular' while Motsi added it was 'out of this world'.\nMeanwhile Shirley Ballas was moved to tears as she thanked his family for letting Lewis follow his dreams and share his talent with the nation.\nAnton Du Beke added it was the best of the series by a 'million miles' and he couldn't have done anything to make it better.\nPreviously speaking about his dance experience in a Strictly segment, Lewis said: 'When I was 11, I was in Billy Elliot in the West End, which was quite relevant to my life. So my brothers were boxing and I was dancing.'\nAt just 18 years old, he performed in front of Got to Dance judges Ashley Banjo, Kimberly Wyatt and Aston Merrygold with Ruff Diamond.\nRuff Diamond also appeared on Children in Need, danced alongside the EastEnders cast, and was crowned UK Hip Hop Champions twice.\nThe group even represented the UK at the 2013 World Hip Hop Dance Championships in Las Vegas.\nLewis left Ruff Diamond in 2015, aged 20, to study acting at the prestigious Royal Welsh College of Music and Drama.\nHe joined the cast of Emmerdale in 2022, playing Nicky Miligan, and bid farewell to the Dales in July 2024 when his character left the village with his boyfriend, Suni Sharma.\n\nSTRICTLY LINEUP 2025\n\nHarry Aikines-Aryeetey\n\nProfession: Olympic Sprinter and Gladiator\nHarry says: 'I'll be bringing tons of energy to light up the dance floor.

Email tips@dailymail.co.uk\nBy CHLOE LOUISE, SHOWBUSINESS REPORTER\n Published:01:02 GMT, 9 November 2025 |Updated:01:08 GMT, 9 November 2025 \n\nTraitors winner Alan Carr reportedly saved his close friend's life after he fended off a knife-wielding thug.\nThe funny man, 49, is believed to have tackled the attacker who was brandishing a ten-inch blade at actress Cleo Rocos, 63.\nIn a bid to protect his friend while they were on a night out in Marrakesh, Alan knocked the weapon out of the assailant's hand.\nCleo told the publication that a man, believed to be in his 40s, appeared from the shadows and grabbed her arm.\nIt is not known when the incident took place. \n'I pushed him away, but he grabbed me tighter and, in really bad English, he said he wanted to be with me', she told The Sun.\n\nTraitors winner Alan Carr, 49, reportedly saved his close friend's life after he fended off a knife-wielding thug \n\nThe funny man is believed to have tackled the attacker who was brandishing a ten-inch blade at actress Cleo Rocos, 63 (pictured together in London, 2008)\n'We didn't think he was being serious, but then he pulled a knife out, it was probably about ten inches long.\n'Most people would have been terrified, but Alan was surprisingly calm.'\nIn his heroic moment, Alan used his own body as a barrier between his friend and the attacker and reportedly told the aggressor, 'don't be so rude,' and hit the knife out of his hand.\nThe attacker was said to be in disbelief over the incident and Cleo branded her pal a 'real gentleman' who is strong and chivalrous.\nThe comic somehow managed to hoodwink Nick Mohammed and David Olusoga into believing he was a Faithful during Celebrity Traitors this week.\nHis win ensured bagged the entire £87,500 prize pot as well as a string of new TV opportunities, including the return of his Chatty Man talk show.\nAlan is also tipped to be Strictly's new host after Tess Daly and Claudia Winkleman announced their departure last month after 20 years.\nA source said: 'Alan's comedy talents were showcased perfectly in the Traitors castle and it's reminded many people just how funny he is.\n\nIn a bid to protect his friend while they were on a night out in Marrakesh, Alan knocked the weapon out of the assailant's hand\n\n Celebrity Traitors winner Alan Carr's Chatty Man talk show 'set for a reboot' \n'Even people who claimed they didn't like him before have loved watching him laugh and lie his way through the episodes'.\nThey told The Mirror: 'It would be no surprise if Chatty Man now got a reboot - not necessarily on Channel 4 - and the Beeb could do way worse than letting Alan loose in the ballroom. He'd be a hoot'.\nThe Daily Mail contacted Alan Carr's representatives for comment at the time.\nIt comes after Celebrity Traitors fans have called for Alan to receive a knighthood after his surprise victory on Thursday night's show.\nWith a peak of 12 million viewers, it was the BBC's biggest overnight audience since Gavin & Stacey's Christmas special last year.\nViewers watched in awe and bewilderment as Alan snatched the prize, despite his previous claims that he was as bad a Traitor as series three star Linda Rands.\nAlan's surprise win came as a result of Nick, 45, and David, 55, turning on fellow Faithful Joe Marler at the last minute in a shock twist that left viewers reeling.\nDespite Joe, 35, correctly guessing that Alan and Cat Burns, 25, were the remaining Traitors, he failed to convince the others and found himself being banished at the last minute.\n\nShare or comment on this article: \nTraitors winner Alan Carr 'saved his close friend's life after fending off thug who attacked her with a knife'\n\nAdd comment\n\n Share what you think\n\nNo comments have so far been submitted.

Email tips@dailymail.co.uk\nBy LAURA PARKIN, SHOWBUSINESS REPORTER \n Published:00:58 GMT, 9 November 2025 |Updated:01:06 GMT, 9 November 2025 \n\nDavid Beckham continued to celebrate his knighthood on Friday as he partied at a Cotswolds pub with 'blaring music and £55 bottles of wine'. \nThe former footballer, 50, is said to have taken over The Bull in Charlbury with a group of close friends and his sons Romeo and Cruz - who performed a specially written song to mark the occasion. \nAfter being bestowed the honour by King Charles at Windsor Castle on Tuesday, he celebrated with an intimate family dinner at pal Gordon Ramsay's Chelsea restaurant before heading back to his £12million country retreat.\nAccording to reports, locals were surprised when David joined in 'dancing and singing' with revellers at the venue. \nAspiring singer Cruz is said to have belted out: 'King Charles came to David Beckham and knighted him my man / You're a knight you get my heart tonight.'\nOne pub goer told The Sun, it was 'kicking off,' and added: 'When the dinner finished, Becks and his crew of blokes left the pub’s safari tent and filtered into the main adjoining pub for dancing and singing.'\n\nDavid Beckham continued to celebrate his knighthood on Friday as he partied at a Cotswolds pub with 'blaring music and £55 bottles of wine' (pictured on Tuesday)\n\nThe former footballer, 50, is said to have taken over The Bull in Charlbury with a group of close friends and his sons Romeo and Cruz - who performed a specially written song (Cruz pictured)\nThey added: 'Everyone was in high spirits. The locals couldn’t believe they’d been treated to a night with Becks there. The music was blaring out and everyone was singing along.' \nAccording to the pub's website the private tent can hold up to 100 guests with dinner starting at £65pp for three courses. \nDaily Mail has contacted the Beckham's representative for comment. \nSir David was made a knight of the British empire for services to sport and charity during Tuesday's investiture, notably his impact on football over a twenty year period and subsequent ambassadorial role with UNICEF.\nThe former footballer was welcomed by King Charles while receiving his knighthood at Windsor Castle for services to sport and charity, and his younger sons were among the first to offer their congratulations. \nA source close to the family revealed to the Daily Mail that family friend Gordon was delighted to host the dinner party as his gift to his best pal in London on Tuesday. \n‘As David’s best friend, Gordon decided the best gift was to throw him a wonderful dinner,' an insider spilled. \n‘David was there, their kids, his sisters, parents and Victoria’s mum and dad.’\nThe couple were joined by three of their four children - Romeo, 23, Cruz, 20, and Harper, 14, as well as David and Victoria's extended family. \n\nOne pub goer told The Sun, it was 'kicking off,' and added: 'When the dinner finished, Becks and his crew of blokes left the pub’s tent and filtered into the pub for dancing and singing'\n\nTheir eldest son Brooklyn, 26, and his wife Nicola, 30, snubbed the festivities and have failed to acknowledge David's achievement on social media. \nTheir silence is just the latest slight after months of family feuding.\nWhen it was announced his father was to be knighted back in the spring, Brooklyn didn't congratulate him either publicly or privately, while his other two sons made a huge fuss of the news on social media.\nBrooklyn is said to have become increasingly estranged from the family after failing to attend any of his father's 50th birthday celebrations in May. \nWindsor CastleGordon RamsayDavid Beckham\n\nShare or comment on this article: \nDavid Beckham celebrates knighthood at Cotswolds pub with 'blaring music and £55 bottles of wine' as son Cruz performs specially written song\n\nAdd comment\n\n Share what you think\n\nNo comments have so far been submitted.

Email tips@dailymail.com \nBy JACQUELINE LINDENBERG \n Published:00:24 GMT, 9 November 2025 |Updated:00:29 GMT, 9 November 2025 \n\nTravis Scott and his daughter Stormi stole the show during his concert performance in Tokyo on Saturday - shortly after Kanye West's shock guest appearance. \nThe 34-year-old rapper - who shares Stormi, seven, and son Aire, three, with ex Kylie Jenner - held a show for a massive crowd at Tokorozawa's Belluna Dome which has a capacity of over 31,000. \nIn a fan video shared to X, Scott brought out his daughter on stage with him as he belted out lyrics to the track Thank God from his 2023 album Utopia - which features the seven-year-old. \nIn the song, the music artist says in the lyrics: 'Storm's a minor, but you know she's livin' major' - to which Stormi sweetly adds, 'That's right, daddy.' \nStormi had the chance to show off her stage confidence as she said both lyrics while her father held a microphone down towards her. \nAfterwards, the pair began to jump up and down on a raised platform on the stage - with the audience following suit. \n\nTravis Scott, 35, and his daughter Stormi, seven, stole the show during his concert performance in Tokyo on Saturday - shortly after Kanye West's shock guest appearance; seen in June in Illinois \n\nIn a fan video shared to X, Scott brought out his daughter on stage with him as he belted out lyrics to the track Thank God from his 2023 album Utopia - which features the seven-year-old\nScott then screamed into the microphone, 'Everybody make some noise for Stormi!' which prompted his fans to let out loud screams. \nHe held Stormi's hand as he guided her towards another part of the stage while continuing to perform the song. \n\n Travis Scott's music video set in London targeted by 'knifeman who threatened to stab crew member' \nA separate X clip uploaded by another fan in attendance revealed that Scott brought out another surprise guest: Kanye West. \nThe fellow rapper could be seen in a video initially wearing a mask - which he later removed. \nOnce he did so, the audience erupted into cheers and applause that echoed throughout the large stadium. \nBoth West - who also goes by Ye - and Scott then performed songs such as Through The Wire, which is found on West's 2004 debut studio album The College Dropout.\nThe music artist also sang his 2007 track Can't Tell Me Nothing, which is on his 2007 album Graduation. \nWest and Scott had a blast on stage together as they also performed other hit songs such as Heartless and All Of The Lights. \n\nStormi had the chance to show off her stage confidence as she said both lyrics while her father held a microphone down towards her\n\nA separate X clip uploaded by another fan in attendance revealed that Scott brought out another surprise guest: Kanye West; seen in 2024 in Inglewood \nDuring an interview with Complex earlier this year, Scott - who is also known as La Flame - opened up about his collaborative friendship with West. \n'S***, man. That's my kid's uncle,' he said at the time. 'That guy took me in when I was young, when I was like 19. \n'He taught me a lot about music. And not even just \"taught\" me, but he allowed me to experience the creation of music.'\nScott added, 'To create music with him, it's what helped me grow, making a lot of beats. \n'Whether it's writing and collaborating on music and film or clothes or whatever the f*** it is, just constantly learning.'\nIt came after West alleged that Scott took him off his 2023 album Utopia. But their recent appearance together over the weekend proved there are no hard feelings between the pair. \nSome of their past collaborations include Scott producing tracks on West's 2013 album Yeezus such as Guilt Trip. \nThe Sicko Mode hitmaker has also previously brought West out on stage - such as in 2023 during his Circus Maximus Concert in Rome. \n\n'S***, man. That's my kid's uncle,' Scott said of West at the time. 'That guy took me in when I was young, when I was like 19'; the pair seen in 2016 in Hollywood \n\nScott added, 'To create music with him, it's what helped me grow, making a lot of beats'; the rapper seen in June in NYC \n'There is no Utopia without Kanye West,' Scott told the audience at the time, per Billboard. \n'There is no Travis Scott without Kanye West. There is no Rome without Kanye West. Make some noise for Ye.'\nScott has been keeping busy during his time in Japan, and is also celebrating a pop-up store for his company Cactus Jack in Shibuya from November 7 until Sunday, November 9. \nLater this month, he is set to also perform in Abu Dhabi on November 15 followed by another concert in Mumbai, India on November 19. \nKanye WestTravis Scott\n\nShare or comment on this article: \nTravis Scott and daughter Stormi steal the show in Tokyo with adorable duet following Kanye West's shock appearance\n\nAdd comment\n\n Share what you think\n\nWorst rated\n\nThe comments below have not been moderated.\n\nThe views expressed in the contents above are those of our users and do not necessarily reflect the views of MailOnline.\n\nAdd your comment\n\nEnter your comment\n\nBy posting your comment you agree to our house rules.\n\nSubmit Comment\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual.\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual\n\nWe will automatically post your comment and a link to the news story to your Facebook timeline at the same time it is posted on MailOnline.

No shortcuts, no giving up - just more studying and and even more determination.\n\n“Thank you to everyone who has supported and encouraged me along the way so far. Falling short isn’t failure - it’s fuel. I was so close to passing the exam and that only motivates me even more. Let’s go!”\n\nEarlier this week, Kardashian ruled out becoming a divorce lawyer like her character in All’s Fair. \n\n“I don’t think I can ever really do family law,” Kardashian told the BBC, adding that she is “more into criminal justice and reform work”.\n\nKardashian took an unconventional law school route, studying under a lawyer in a workaround offered in California.\n\nShe enlisted in an apprenticeship program with a San Francisco law firm in 2018, according to multiple reports, and celebrated its completion in May.\n\n“It was the wildest idea that I was going to law school,” she said, “but to me it all makes sense and I hope that I’m forever curious and always want to try new things.”\n\nKardashian’s interest in criminal justice reform first drew wide attention in 2018 when she lobbied President Donald Trump for clemency on behalf of Alice Marie Johnson, who had been serving a life sentence for a non-violent drug offense. Johnson’s sentence was commuted that June, and she received a pardon in 2020.\n\nIn 2019, Kardashian supported the “90 Days to Freedom” campaign, helping fund efforts to free 17 people serving life terms for non-violent drug offenses.\n\nShe has also publicly backed the bipartisan First Step Act and related efforts to reduce mandatory minimum sentences for first-time offenders.\n\nKardashian’s interest in law is part of a family legacy. Her father, Robert Kardashian, was a successful attorney who practiced law for almost a decade before shifting into business.\n\nHe reactivated his inactive license to join OJ Simpson’s defense team during his 1995 murder trial. Robert Kardashian died in 2003 from esophageal cancer, aged 59.\n\nKardashian, who has been divorced three times, said the subject matter of her new show was “such a relatable topic” for her because she “experienced it with my family and parents growing up”.\n\nShe finalized her divorce from Kanye West, also known as Ye, with whom she has four children, after eight years of marriage in 2022.","summary":"Kardashian’s father, Robert Kardashian, was a successful attorney and part of OJ Simpson’s defense team during his 1995 murder trial","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/tv/news/kim-kardashian-passed-bar-legal-exam-b2861544.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/11/07/8/21/174743_0216RC.jpeg?crop=2047.5,1365,x0.3,y0&trim=0,0,0,0&width=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/jHJW7tGh-OhrQWqOm.mp4","publish_date":"2025-11-09 00:27:12","author":"Kevin E G Perry","authors":["Kevin E G Perry"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":0.006},{"id":377144142,"title":"Genocide: FG should dialogue with international bodies — PFN president","text":"The National President of the Pentecostal Fellowship of Nigeria (PFN), Bishop Francis Wale Oke, addressed the pressing issues facing the country regarding the allegations of genocide against the Christian community in Nigeria made by international bodies. SEYI SOKOYA provides excerpts from Bishop Oke’s engagement with the press last Friday.\n\nTHERE are claims that you said there was no genocide against Christians in Nigeria. Is that true?\n\nNo, I never said that. In fact, I have been one of the leading voices crying out against the unjust attacks on Christians over the years. I want to reaffirm that the ongoing killings and assaults on Christian communities across the country constitute genocide. I urge both local and international stakeholders to collaborate in addressing this crisis.\n\nThe report claiming I denied the genocide is false, misleading, and malicious. Let it be clear: there is genocide against the Church and Christian communities in Nigeria. I have never said otherwise. Anyone following the events in this country knows this to be true. I did not make these claims at the 40th anniversary of the PFN.\n\nThere has been a growing debate about whether Christians are facing genocide in Nigeria. Some argue that it is exaggerated, while others claim it is undeniable. What is your view?\n\nLet me speak frankly as a Nigerian, a Christian leader, and someone who has witnessed the pain of our people firsthand. There is no controversy about it; there is genocide against Christians in Nigeria. This is not speculation or political rhetoric; it is a tragic reality that has persisted for over a decade. The blood of innocent Nigerians cries out every day. From the abduction of Leah Sharibu, who remains in captivity for refusing to renounce her Christian faith, to the Chibok girls, abducted from a predominantly Christian community in Borno State, the evidence is overwhelming.\n\nIn Benue State, the killings continue unabated. Plateau State, Southern Kaduna, Taraba, and parts of Niger State have all faced relentless attacks for years. Before the last Kaduna administration left office, killings were happening almost daily. Villages were destroyed, churches were burned, and families were displaced. Even now, many communities in the Middle Belt continue to bury their dead quietly. These are largely Christian areas; these are our brothers and sisters.\n\nSome international observers, like Donald Trump, have described these attacks as a genocide against Christians. Do you agree with that characterization?\n\nAbsolutely. President Trump was right. He labeled it genocide because that is exactly what it is: targeted mass killings against Christians and their communities. Let us not deceive ourselves. This is not merely a conflict about cattle grazing or farmer-herder disputes. When armed men invade a village shouting “Allahu Akbar,” burn down churches, kill worshippers, and kidnap young girls, that is not a random conflict; it is religious persecution.\n\nWe have seen hundreds of pastors butchered, tens of thousands of Christians killed, and hundreds of churches destroyed. The PFN and CAN have documented these atrocities. What about the Owo Church massacre? Or the killings in Dogo Nahawa in Plateau State, where hundreds were slaughtered overnight? Before such attacks, the assailants often chant religious slogans. So let’s call it what it is: a genocide against Christians.\n\nI must emphasize that we are not accusing the entire Muslim community. Christians and Muslims have lived peacefully in Nigeria for centuries. We share neighborhoods, markets, and friendships. However, there are violent sects, such as Boko Haram, ISWAP, and some radicalized Fulani militias, who use the name of Islam to destroy lives. It would be a disservice to the victims’ blood to call this by any other name. As I often say, you don’t call cancer a headache. Cancer is cancer, and this cancer must be confronted and cured.\n\nWhat role should the Nigerian government play in this situation? Do you believe the government is complicit?\n\nWe must be fair; the current government did not create this problem. It is an inherited crisis that has lasted through multiple administrations. However, what we have seen is a lack of political will to confront it decisively.\n\nWhen villages are destroyed and entire communities are displaced, we often hear of “investigations,” but nobody is arrested, nobody is prosecuted, and nobody is punished. This creates a culture of impunity.\n\nIt is the constitutional duty of the government to protect the lives and property of every Nigerian, regardless of religion or ethnicity. Therefore, we are not blaming, but rather appealing to the government to fulfill its responsibility and defend all citizens equally.\n\nWhat message do you have for President Trump and the international community?\n\nWe appreciate President Trump’s willingness to speak out. He has recognized the harsh reality that Christians are being killed in large numbers in Nigeria. However, let me be clear: we are not asking America to invade Nigeria. We seek partnership and support.\n\nThe U.S. possesses advanced military technology, including drones, surveillance aircraft, and training expertise. We urge President Trump and the U.S. government to work collaboratively with Nigeria to help us combat the terrorism that has plagued our nation for over 15 years.\n\nAt the PFN, we have also sent humanitarian relief to victims. For instance, during one of the major massacres in Plateau State, our organization, the Dorcas Oke Hope Alive Initiative, dispatched over 40 truckloads of relief materials from Lagos to the affected communities. This is a national tragedy, and we cannot turn a blind eye to it.\n\nWhat is your response to the growing debate about Sharia law and the government’s involvement in promoting a “Halal economy”?\n\nOur constitution is very clear. Section 10 states that Nigeria shall not adopt any religion as a state religion. This means that the government, whether at the local, state, or federal level, must remain neutral in religious matters.\n\nSharia law is intended to be a personal law for Muslims, which is perfectly acceptable. Muslims have every right to practice their faith according to their beliefs. However, the government should not finance or promote any religious systems or economies, whether Halal or Haram.\n\nRecently, we heard about the government promoting a “Halal economy.” Halal means “permissible” in Islam, whereas Haram means “forbidden.” The irony is that while Christians are being killed by extremists who invoke religious slogans, our government is endorsing religiously exclusive programmes. This sends a wrong message.\n\nReligion should be a private matter, not a function of the state. Every Nigerian should be free to practise their faith, as long as it does not infringe on the rights of others. If anyone, whether Christian or Muslim, kills in the name of religion, they must face the full force of the law.\n\nDo you believe foreign governments like the U.S. have credible evidence for their positions on Nigeria?\n\nYes, they do. America does not act without evidence. The U.S. Congress, intelligence agencies, and human rights organizations have received comprehensive reports from within Nigeria from the PFN, CAN, and independent media sources.\n\nThey have witnessed the mass graves in Benue, the mass funerals in Plateau, and the burned churches in Southern Kaduna. The photographs and data are available. Therefore, when America labels this as genocide, it is based on documented evidence, not rumors. Our senators and political leaders should visit these areas to see the facts for themselves.\n\nWhat advice do you have for President Tinubu and his government regarding this issue?\n\nI urge President Bola Tinubu’s administration to establish diplomatic and military cooperation channels with the U.S. and other supportive nations. This challenge resembles cancer; we must confront it decisively. Nigeria needs help, and now is the time for collaborative action.\n\nFinally, what message do you have for Nigerians, both Christians and Muslims?\n\nNigeria must not allow this tragedy to become a political debate. This is not about politics; it is a security and humanitarian crisis that threatens our unity and peace. We, the Church, are people of prayer and peace. We love our Muslim brothers and sisters and are not enemies. However, peace must be built on justice. We call on the government to act courageously.\n\nWe urge Nigerians to reject extremism and implore the international community to continue standing with us, not to divide us, but to help us heal. The Church will continue to pray, but prayer must be matched with action. Let us defend the innocent, uphold justice, and preserve the soul of this nation.","summary":"The National President of the Pentecostal Fellowship of Nigeria (PFN), Bishop Francis Wale Oke, addressed the pressing issues facing the country regarding the allegations of genocide against the Christian community in Nigeria made by international bodies.

Elise Stefanik (R-NY) told The Post’s Rich Calder during a nearly 20-minute interview this week, excerpted below, discussing her decision to challenge Gov. Kathy Hochul.\n\nQ: Under the state Constitution, governors could suspend or even remove elected officials from office. Is that something you’d consider doing with socialist NYC Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani if elected governor?\n\nA: If elected governor, I will follow the New York State Constitution, which lays out a process. It is not based upon ideology. The Constitution is very specific about that process. . . . When we win, I will follow the Constitution and make an assessment.Q: How do you get around the fact that President Trump is not popular in parts of New York – especially in New York City? Hochul is already using your alliance with Trump to raise cash from panicked Democrats.\n\nA: Hochul’s campaign is helping us turn out low-propensity voters, which will be a key part of our electoral strategy. The reality is Kathy Hochul got about 3.1 million votes in New York and Donald Trump got nearly 3.6 million. This race is going to be won on voter turnout, and it’s going to be won on a referendum on Kathy Hochul. . . . Her name is on the ballot. My name will be on the ballot, and she is less popular than Donald Trump is in New York State.\n\nQ: If you beat Hochul, do you plan to reverse congestion pricing?\n\nA: Oh, absolutely. That is going to be a major part of my platform. It is a commuter tax. It is a tax on working New Yorkers, and it’s devastating the economy of New York City.\n\nQ: Why did you decide to enter the governor’s race – and why now?\n\nA: I am running to save New York. We have seen two decades of Democrats in the governor’s seat, and what has happened in New York? It’s become the most unaffordable state in the nation and one of the most unsafe. On the affordability issue, because of Kathy Hochul’s failed leadership, we are the highest tax state in the nation. We have the highest energy prices, the highest utility cost, highest rent, highest grocery bills. We also rank at the bottom when it comes to friendliness of doing business in New York.. . . And on the issue of safety, because of failed bail reform, every single day, there are violent crimes being committed against law-abiding New Yorkers. . . . New Yorkers are outraged, and so I decided to run because I want to save the state that I love. I’m born and raised in upstate New York, and I understand that traditionally New York is a Democrat state. But when I first ran for Congress over a decade ago, no one thought I could win. It was a Democrat seat. Republicans had struggled for many cycles to win it. . . . I went on to win the most expensive primary in the country, and I won the general election by over 20 points, shattering expectations, and we did that by building a coalition of Republicans, independents, and Democrats. And since then, we’ve built an apparatus where I put up some of the largest margins in the Northeast and the highest voter turnout of any congressional district in the state.\n\nQ: You’ve said that a lot of support for your gubernatorial bid has come from Dems – can you expand on that?\n\nA: Kathy Hochul is seeing the same polling that we are, and that is: among registered Democrats, she cannot make 50%. That is why she endorsed Mamdani and bowed to him to try to coalesce registered Democrats and try to appease the far left. It was a politically toxic and devastating decision because it puts into hyperdrive traditional Democrats, independents and Republicans who are opposing her. And if you look at Mamdani’s win, while he won a three-way race and got slightly above 50%, what it means to me is that it was an underperformance, traditionally, for the Democratic nominee. They’re usually in the high 60s or 70s in New York City. . . . Hochul’s approval ratings have cratered. Some of her biggest bundlers and donors are now my bundlers and donors, which will be revealed when we do our end-of-the-year filing. . . . They want a strong governor who can represent common sense values for all of New York, to save New York City, and save the rest of New York State.\n\nQ: Do you think Mamdani being mayor helps your campaign, and Republicans nationwide, assuming he bombs in office?\n\nA: I want New York City to succeed. It’s the most important and most meaningful city, not just in the state, but in the entire world. . . . We need a healthy, safe, vibrant, capitalist New York City. We also need a New York City where families are able to thrive and not be crushed by high taxation, regulatory burdens, as well as this “defund the police” nonsense that makes New York increasingly unsafe. So I’m going to continue holding Hochul accountable every single day for her refusal to condemn Mamdani’s positions. There’s not a single statement he has made that Hochul has condemned. She didn’t condemn his … calling for “defunding the police.” She didn’t condemn when he said Hamas should not lay down their arms. She didn’t condemn when he campaigned with the unindicted co-conspirator of the World Trade Center bombings in 1993. She didn’t condemn when he said he wants to abolish private property. . . . And, mark my words, she will break her promise that she said she’s not going to raise taxes because [the far left will] extract it from her.\n\nQ: But do you think his success or failures will help your campaign?\n\nA: Yeah, we’re holding him accountable, and it’s going to expose what Kathy Hochul has brought to New York City. At the time when it was most important for the governor to show strength and common sense, she anointed [Mamdani] by endorsing him. . . . So, yes, if Mamdani fails, we’re going to make sure that voters know there is a better way to have a strong governor who brings common sense and is focused on making New York affordable and making it safe.\n\nQ: Do you see yourself running not only against Hochul – but also Mamdani? And is the race a battle to prevent the soul of New York turning socialist?\n\nA: This is an existential battle for New York and for Western civilization. This is the most important election that New York State will have had in my lifetime, much like 2024 was a historically important [presidential] election. This is going to be a referendum on Kathy Hochul, and Kathy Hochul is tied lock, stock and barrel to Mamdani — every position, every catastrophic mistake he makes. You’re going to see an increase of crime in New York City. You’re already seeing a mass exodus and a fleeing of businesses, of families who, No. 1, are fearful of Mamdani — rightfully so — and No. 2, see his proposal of raising taxes, making New York even more unaffordable than it already is.\n\nQ: You called Hochul “the worst governor in the USA.” Do you feel Mamdani will be the worst mayor in the USA?\n\nA: Oh, yes, absolutely. And Kathy Hochul has earned that label. It stuck for a reason, and it’s because she’s an accidental governor. Let’s look back at Kathy Hochul’s career. She was a town board member of Hamburg. Hamburg, by the way, just flipped Republican. She was a one-term member of Congress who was fired by her constituents. She was lieutenant governor because [ex-Gov. Andrew] Cuomo wanted a weak lieutenant governor [from] the western part of New York State. And then she’s an accidental governor who happened to be on the ballot because Cuomo stepped down in [2021]. She was an unknown generic Democrat in 2022, and [Republican] Lee Zeldin came within six points [of beating her]. Now she’s known and she’s despised. She’s underwater in every single media market: New York City, Long Island, Hudson Valley, Capital District, Upstate Urban, Upstate Rural, and Western New York. They’re seeing those same numbers that we are while conducting our polling and research across the state.\n\nQ: Are you concerned about the effect Trump’s lack of popularity in New Jersey had on its governor’s race, which Democratic Rep. Mikie Sherrill won handily?\n\nA: In that case, Mikie Sherrill was not an incumbent governor the way that Kathy Hochul is, and I’ve served with Mikie Sherrill. Kathy Hochul is abysmal and the bottom of the barrel. And Mikie Sherrill is just a different type of candidate than Kathy Hochul, who is an embattled governor, who is being primaried by her own handpicked lieutenant governor, who owns the catastrophic economic and safety policies in New York State.\n\nQ: Will you bring fracking to New York?\n\nA: Absolutely. Day 1, I will be lifting the moratorium on fracking. We need to unleash American energy independence and New York energy independence, and that’s a major reason why we have the affordability crisis — because of the insane energy policies of Kathy Hochul. . . . She has chosen to block fracking. She has chosen to put in the gas-stove ban. We’re going to focus on New York natural resources that are affordable and also abundant and will lead to a huge economic boost for every New Yorker, every family, to pay lower bills, but it also will provide thousands of jobs in upstate, specifically the Southern Tier.\n\nQ: How will you solve the cost-of-living issue and is that the biggest issue for voters and the GOP?\n\nA: So No. 1, you have to cut taxes. Here Hochul has a record of raising taxes. . . . I’m the only candidate that will actually cut taxes, and I delivered that already, and voters will see that next year when they file their taxes. I negotiated the largest middle-class tax cut for New Yorkers in history with both the president and the Secretary of Treasury, and my colleagues in the New York Republican delegation, by the lifting of the SALT deduction. We are going to make New York the most affordable state with the most competitive tax issues by cutting taxes, rather than being taxed the most. The second piece is energy. Energy is the fuel of the economy, and New Yorkers are paying more for energy bills than anywhere else in the country. That’s why those issues you talked about are so important. Lifting the moratorium on fracking to “frack baby, frack.” That is going to lower the costs tremendously. Green lighting the pipeline [project] that Kathy Hochul blocked for so many years. Getting rid of the insane gas-stove ban. I also want to take a sledgehammer to the red tape and bureaucracy that makes it so expensive to do business.\n\nQ: What do you bring to the table that Hochul lacks?\n\nA: A record of results. I’ve been re-elected overwhelmingly. I’m in my sixth term in Congress. I bring energy. I am a hardworking mom, a hardworking member of Congress with the ability to win and unify Republicans, independents, and Democrats. I’m laser-focused on tackling the affordability crisis to lower the cost of groceries, to lower costs of energy bills, as well as to lower taxes. I also understand how important it is with a young family to have safe communities. . . . I have a record of doing that. And while I’ve served in Congress — whereas Kathy Hochul has only served with Democratic majorities in the Assembly, Senate . . . in the governor’s seat — I’ve served with Democrats, Republicans, and I’ve been able to effectively deliver for New Yorkers, no matter what that iteration is. . . . I’ve been rated as one of the topmost bipartisan members and also one of the most effective, particularly when it comes to small businesses.","summary":"The 2026 New York gubernatorial election will be “existential battle” to save New York and all of Western civilization from socialism, Rep.

He retired as a permanent secretary in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. In this interview with ISAAC SHOBAYO, Ambassador Sheni speaks on the current diplomatic row between Nigeria and the United States, particularly over President Donald Trump’s designation of the country as a “Country of Particular Concern,” the threat of military action against Nigeria over alleged religious persecution of Christians, among other related issues. Excerpts:\n\nPRESIDENT Donald Trump has designated Nigeria a “Country of Particular Concern” following claims of Christian genocide in Nigeria. How do you feel about this accusation?\n\nI also listen to and watch both local and international news about the issue of genocide in Nigeria, particularly against the Christian community. It started as a joke, but it has now gone so far that the President of the United States has designated Nigeria as a country of particular concern. This has taken the issue to another level entirely. No country wants to be so designated because it comes with certain implications. It is, first of all, an American policy decision under the International Religious Freedom Act, established in 1989. When the U.S. government views that a particular religion — in this case Christianity — is being profiled or persecuted persistently and with the approval, tacit or otherwise, of the state, it designates that country accordingly. This is not the first time. During the Trump administration in 2020, Nigeria was similarly designated. It was later reversed by President Biden, but now it has happened again.\n\nThis is a very serious and worrying development for us as Nigerians, because once you are in that category, you find yourself listed among countries like Sudan, North Korea, Cuba, and even China at some point — places you do not want to be associated with. Once a country is so designated, it sends a clear signal to the rest of the world that something is wrong with that nation in terms of religious freedom.\n\nSaudi Arabia has also been designated a number of times. Even within Islam, there are minority groups facing persecution. So it’s not something you want, especially for a developing country like Nigeria. For me, as someone who has worked in diplomacy, this is a terrible time for Nigeria. We are trying to polish our image and attract investors, yet this kind of development sends the wrong signal.\n\nNow, was the designation justified? As a Christian, I find it difficult to fully agree that Christians are being systematically persecuted in Nigeria. What I see is that human beings are being killed regardless of faith. People are being killed by insurgents and bandits across communities. Here in Plateau State, for instance, we’ve had to bury people. But do I believe that the federal or state governments are sponsoring these killings? My answer is no.\n\nWhat about the killings in Zamfara or Katsina, where Muslims are being attacked, even in mosques? To me, it is clear that Muslims and Christians and even traditional worshippers are being slaughtered, and it is completely unacceptable. We must not encourage further division by labeling everything along religious lines. Saying “this is Christian” or “this is Muslim” will not help us as a nation.\n\nBut I must admit, perception is very important in this matter. If some leaders, especially Christian leaders, believe or have evidence that the Nigerian state is complicit in these massacres, that is a different issue. I personally don’t have access to such information, so it would be difficult for me to draw that conclusion.\n\nNow, regarding the U.S. State Department’s designation, once a country is listed as one of particular concern, there are possible consequences, including sanctions, if the government in question does not take immediate and positive steps to address the perception. So this could lead to punitive actions against Nigeria for allegedly persecuting a particular religion.\n\nThe unfortunate part is that this latest action appears hasty, almost like a preemptive move by the U.S. against Nigeria. This happened just last week, without much engagement. And that’s why, as diplomats, some of us are saddened that at such a critical time, Nigeria does not have substantive ambassadors in key countries. We don’t have an ambassador in Washington, nor do we have one at the United Nations or in other major Western capitals. So this is coming at a very bad time for Nigeria.\n\nBut given President Trump’s threat of military action against some Nigerian states, what do you believe Nigeria’s next line of action should be?\n\nOnce a country is designated as one of particular concern, certain actions usually follow, and I think President Trump is already doing that now. For instance, there could be restrictions on U.S. aid. One of the first areas affected is usually military assistance and health-related support, which are now automatically restricted. There’s also the potential imposition of economic sanctions and other penalties on Nigeria. If this situation persists, things could escalate further.\n\nNigeria’s diplomatic engagement is poor. And remember, with Trump, he often acts unpredictably; he may start from the end and then work backward. So Nigeria must be very careful. This is a time for serious diplomatic engagement. We must step up our diplomatic engagement to avoid sanctions; President Trump is not predictable.\n\nDo you not believe that Nigeria is taking too long to react to this crisis, or that its engagement has not been as prompt and well planned as it ought to be?\n\nYou may ask, why is that so? First of all, at the international level, we lack capacity as defined by principal representatives — people who can speak with authority and credibility on behalf of the country. We don’t have a strong media presence abroad. We have not engaged international public relations firms or lobbyists in Washington and New York who can promote our case and engage the U.S. Congress effectively.\n\nSo yes, you are right, we need to wake up. Despite our economic challenges, we must move fast. One practical step is to gather retired ambassadors who have served in these key places and still maintain connections with former members of Congress so they can help us lobby and explain the Nigerian situation. Leaving such a serious issue to relatively junior officers shows a laissez-faire attitude toward something of national importance.\n\nHonestly, I wish the president himself would come out clearly to address journalists and explain what actions are being taken. Perhaps he is doing something behind the scenes, but we need to see stronger engagement.\n\nHow should this situation be handled, based on your experience?\n\nAs I said earlier, through strong diplomatic engagement. We should have ensured this designation never happened in the first place. We saw the warning signs. Senator Ted Cruz and others in the U.S. Congress were making a lot of noise about it. We’ve been here before; Trump did the same thing in 2020. We saw them moving toward this outcome, but perhaps we were complacent, thinking it wouldn’t happen again.\n\nThat’s unfortunate, because in 2020, Trump did it at the tail end of his administration, so he didn’t have time to follow up. This time, it’s happening in his first year — meaning he has at least three years to act on it. That’s a serious matter. So it calls for critical thinking. Nigeria must put its best diplomats forward, both retired and serving, alongside respected elder statesmen, to begin a serious lobbying mission in Washington.\n\nI recall a time when America appeared to turn its back on Nigeria, particularly in terms of purchasing weaponry and military hardware. So, why are they now raising alarms when they refused to assist Nigeria when it was most needed?\n\nFortunately, at that time, I was still in service, so I can speak about it with some understanding, though I won’t go into too many details. It’s not that they outright refused to sell. They imposed certain conditions. For instance, there are offensive platforms — military equipment that are not supposed to be used for internal operations. They’re meant for external defense. And when you purchase them, one of the conditions from the U.S. is that you must give a written undertaking that you will not use those platforms against your own people.\n\nYou see, many leaders in developing countries have bought such equipment and later used it for internal repression. So the Americans want assurance that this won’t happen. That’s one of their key concerns.\n\nAnother issue is about ensuring that the weapons don’t fall into the wrong hands. They worry that sensitive technologies could be exposed. So, not that they refused outright — it’s just that certain requirements had to be met.\n\nNigeria tried to give those assurances that we would not use the weapons to attack our citizens. Even then, some of the arms we got were not directly from the U.S. I think at one point, they were coming through Brazil and other countries. But globally, any time the U.S. dollar is involved in arms transactions, there’s close monitoring. Once the dollar trail flags Nigeria, other countries are also stopped from selling arms to us because of U.S. financial oversight.\n\nThere were times even China faced similar restrictions because payments were being made in dollars. The U.S. tracks these movements very closely.\n\nIf you were to advise Mr. President personally, what would you tell him to do, especially on this diplomatic issue?\n\nAt this stage, I would say we have crossed the bridge — the country has already been designated as one of particular concern. So, as I said earlier, we need to move quickly. Engage our friends to talk to their friends. That’s how diplomacy works. International relations are not so different from human relationships. If I have a misunderstanding with you and can’t reach you directly, I might ask a mutual friend to speak on my behalf. That’s the kind of robust engagement Nigeria needs right now.\n\nWe also need to take an honest look at our internal situation. Is there some truth in what certain Christian leaders are saying? We need to conduct an independent assessment. How did these groups in the U.S. arrive at their conclusions? What data, what documents, and what videos were presented to the U.S. Congress? Could there be a counter-narrative that we haven’t properly articulated?\n\nI saw a video from Plateau where they were burying over 50 people — and yes, they were Christians. But was that state-sponsored? These are the kinds of questions we must examine.\n\nSo, Mr. President should put together a small, competent team to review the events that led to this designation. After that, we should engage professional international lobbyists — people who understand Washington and who can represent Nigeria’s case credibly before the U.S. Congress and relevant agencies.\n\nThe roles of ambassadors are very crucial at this moment. What would be your recommendation to the president?\n\nMy advice is very clear: Mr. President should appoint ambassadors immediately. It’s not even about politics — it’s a matter of urgency. The process itself takes time, anywhere between six months to one year. After the president nominates candidates, the list must go to the Senate for confirmation. That requires security clearance and background checks, which can take months.\n\nEven after Senate confirmation, you still need to match each nominee with the right posting — assign them to countries where they can best serve Nigeria’s interests. Then you begin visa and accreditation processes, over which you have little control.\n\nYes, for nearby African countries like Ghana or others within West Africa, it’s easier — you don’t even need visas. But for the major capitals — the U.S., the U.K., Germany, and France — it’s far more complex. How do you convince a country that’s already canceling visas for Nigerians to issue diplomatic clearances quickly?\n\nSo, realistically, it will take at least six months to one year. But as the saying goes, a journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step. Mr. President should take that first step now — appoint substantive ambassadors and send them out.","summary":"Ambassador Danjuma Nanpon Sheni is a retired career diplomat who served in many foreign missions.

While addressing the crowd in Omaha, Joe called out President Donald Trump for the ongoing government shutdown and for cutting healthcare — a topic near to his family.\n\n Joe, who completed radiation treatments for prostate cancer last month, got quiet and visibly emotional at one point during the speech as he reflected on a moment he shared with Beau, who died in 2015 at age 46 from brain cancer.\n\n “Folks, I know what cancer research means. Cancer hits every family. It hit my family hard, just as so many of yours,” Joe said, according to footage of his speech shared by outlet APT.\n\n He continued, “When the love of my life, my oldest son, the attorney general of the state of Delaware, who should have been the president, not me, volunteered to go to Iraq for a year — he didn't have to — came back with stage 4 glioblastoma because he lived near the burn pit, just like those guys in 9/11, and he died. I remember him calling me aside.”\n\n Before recounting what his late son told him at that moment, the former president said, “I shouldn't probably say this, but … when he died, I lost part of my soul.”\n\n \"He asked to meet with me in his room, the hospital room,” Joe recalled. “And he said, ‘Dad, look at me.’ We have this screwy thing, we Bidens. When we want to make sure what we really mean, we say, ‘Give me your word as a Biden.’ ”\n\n “He said, ‘Dad, look at me. Look at me. I know what you're going to do, Dad. When I go, you're going to quit. You're not going to want to be engaged. But look at me, Dad. Promise me. Give me your word as a Biden. You'll stay involved. Give me your word.’ And I did,” Joe continued.\n\n The memory of Beau, and Joe's quiet comment that the late attorney general “should have been the president, not me,” came as the former president criticized Trump, 79, and \"his Republican friends\" for \"cutting government funding for healthcare.”\n\n Beau worked as a federal prosecutor before being elected as Delaware's attorney general in 2006. He was reelected to a second term in 2010. He joined the military in 2003 as a member of the Delaware Army National Guard and as a major in the Judge Advocate General (JAG) Corps. In 2008, Beau's unit was deployed in Iraq, and he served in active duty overseas until September 2009.\n\n During his speech in Nebraska on Friday, Joe also called for the president to “get the damn government open,” referring to the ongoing shutdown, which is officially the longest in U.S. history. Millions of struggling Americans are now receiving reduced and delayed food benefits as a result of the shutdown, while healthcare subsidies are set to expire. More than 600,000 federal workers have been furloughed, and upward of 700,000 have kept working without pay.\n\n “By the way, do you know how many government shutdowns we had when I was president? None,” Joe told the Nebraska Democrats elsewhere during the Nov. 7 address, prompting cheers.\n\n Never miss a story — sign up for PEOPLE's free daily newsletter to stay up-to-date on the best of what PEOPLE has to offer, from juicy celebrity news to compelling human-interest stories.\n\n Joe first announced that he had been diagnosed with an aggressive form of prostate cancer that had spread to his bones in May, via his personal office. In September, he also underwent Mohs surgery, a procedure used to treat skin cancer, a spokesperson for the politician confirmed to PEOPLE.\n\n The former president previously recalled Beau’s request for his dad to “stay engaged” in 2022, on what would have been his 53rd birthday. The title of Joe's 2017 memoir, Promise Me, Dad, also touches on the conversations the father-son duo had during Beau's final days.","summary":"The former president made the comment while recalling one of his final moments with Beau, who died in 2015 from brain cancer","url":"https://people.com/joe-biden-says-late-son-beau-should-have-been-president-not-me-11846354","image":"https://people.com/thmb/DhqCJPYNGHx09jmwlESmBVy4m_8=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(749x0:751x2)/joe-biden-Beau-donald-trump-110825-25f76f38042b422386872fffe5a5bc17.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-11-08 23:56:19","author":"Bailey Richards","authors":["Bailey Richards"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.184},{"id":377146746,"title":"Billionaire Peter Thiel warns if you ‘proletarianize the young people,’ don’t be surprised they end up communist","text":"After Tuesday night’s election victory of democratic socialist Zoran Mamdani as New York City’s mayor, an email Thiel sent five years ago went viral.\n\nIn the correspondence to Mark Zuckerberg, Marc Andreessen and others, he warned that “When 70% of Millennials say they are pro-socialist, we need to do better than simply dismiss them by saying that they are stupid or entitled or brainwashed; we should try and understand why.”\n\nThiel expanded on those concerns in an interview with the Free Press that was published on Friday, saying strict zoning laws and construction limits have been good for boomers, who have seen their properties appreciate, but they have been terrible for millennials, who are having an extremely hard time buying homes.\n\n“If you proletarianize the young people, you shouldn’t be surprised if they eventually become communist,” he explained.\n\nWhile Thiel, who backed Donald Trump’s re-election, disagrees with Mamdani’s answers to New York’s housing affordability problems, he credited the lawmaker for talking about the issue more than establishment figures have been.\n\nHe also said he’s not sure if young people are actually more in favor of socialism or if they have become more disillusioned with capitalism.\n\n“So in some relative sense, they’re more socialist, even though I think it’s more just: ‘Capitalism doesn’t work for me. Or, this thing called capitalism is just an excuse for people ripping you off,'” Thiel added.\n\nAffordability politics\n\nWhile Mamdani’s victory highlighted voters’ shift away from Republicans, moderate Democrats also won with campaigns that focused on the cost of living.\n\nThe off-year election results were a “wake-up call” for both parties to tackle the affordability crisis, according to polling expert Frank Luntz, who distinguished it from inflation.\n\nThiel expressed some sympathy for voters seeking bold ideas to solve daunting problems like student debt and housing costs, which previously have been addressed with “tinkering at the margins.”\n\nSuch incremental attempts haven’t worked, spurring voters to warm up to proposals outside the typical political discourse, including “some very left-wing economics, socialist-type stuff,” Thiel said. \n\nAs a result, he’s not surprised that voters have gravitated toward Mamdani, even though he doesn’t think his ideas will work either. \n\n“Capitalism is not working for a lot of people in New York City. It’s not working for young people,” Thiel said.\n\n‘Old people’s socialism’\n\nHe also observed that the growing popularity of socialism among younger Americans comes amid a “multi-decade political bull market.” \n\nThis era of increased political intensity comes as people have started looking more to politics to fix their problems, according to Thiel, who leans more libertarian. \n\nPart of that is due to a huge mismatch between people’s hopes and reality, with that chasm growing bigger than ever.\n\n“There are some dimensions in which the millennials are better off than the boomers. There’s some ways our society has changed for the better,” Thiel said. “But the gap between the expectations the boomer parents had for their kids and what those kids actually were able to do is just extraordinary. I don’t think there’s ever been a generation where the gap has been as extreme as for the millennials.”\n\nBut when asked if a revolution is on the horizon, he said he thinks that’s hard to believe, given that communism and fascism are “youth movements.”\n\nAt the same time, America’s aging demographics are marked by fewer young people, who are not having as many children.\n\n“And so, we have more of a gerontocracy. Which means that if the U.S. becomes socialist, it will be more of an old people’s socialism than a young people’s socialism, where it’s more about free healthcare or something like that,” Thiel added. “The word ‘revolution’ sounds pretty high testosterone and violent and youthful. And today, if it’s a revolution, it’s 70-something grandmothers.”","summary":"\"Capitalism is not working for a lot of people in New York City.

He was returned to the United States in June after a months-long court fight and now faces human smuggling charges, which he denies, stemming from a 2022 traffic stop in Tennessee.\n\nSince a court order prevents Abrego Garcia’s return to El Salvador, the administration has been looking for a third country to accept him, with Eswatini, Uganda, and Ghana previously floated, and the most recent filings identifying Liberia.\n\nThe Trump administration reported in September that “2 million illegal aliens have been removed or self-deported in just 250 days.” President Donald Trump has pledged to launch the largest mass deportation operation in U.S. history. Some of the deportees have been sent back to their country of origin, while others have gone to third countries that have entered an agreement with the U.S.\n\nWhat To Know\n\nIn a lengthy court filing, government lawyers pushed for U.S. District Court Judge Paula Xinis to “dissolve its preliminary injunction and permit the government to remove Petitioner to Liberia,” according to court documents reviewed by Newsweek. This summer, Xinis issued the preliminary injunction barring Abrego Garcia’s removal.\n\nThe attorneys argued that Abrego Garcia “has not carried his burden for obtaining relief based on fear of persecution or torture,” in Liberia, and noted that the “United States has received the requisite assurances from the government of Liberia, which here notably includes assurance that individuals would not be refouled to any country where they would be subject to persecution or torture.”\n\nHis immigration saga has extended for months as the administration admitted it first mistakenly deported him to El Salvador. Previously, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) told Abrego Garcia it planned to send him to Uganda, which he objected to, saying he feared being persecuted or tortured. Xinis blocked his deportation to Uganda in late-August.\n\nAbrego Garcia’s legal team has pushed back against Liberia as a removal destination noting in an October filing that he “expressed fear of removal to that country and requested a reasonable fear interview.”\n\nAbrego Garcia came to the U.S. illegally as a teenager, and is married to a U.S. citizen, residing in Maryland. He has said he is willing to be deported to Costa Rica, which has indicated it would accept him, but the administration has not pursued that option publicly.\n\nThe Trump administration maintains that Abrego Garcia is a member of the MS-13 gang, which Trump designated a terrorist organization in January. He and his family have consistently denied this allegation.\n\nSandoval-Moshenberg told Newsweek in an email statement Saturday, “The government still has not produced anything that guarantees Mr. Abrego Garcia will not be re-deported from Liberia to El Salvador, since the government of Liberia explicitly stated that they are only willing to accept him there on a temporary basis.”\n\nKilmar Abrego Garcia attends a protest rally at the Immigration and Customs Enforcement field office in Baltimore on August 25 to support him.

We, like others, undoubtedly make mistakes. We, like others, need to listen and learn. We can & will do better but we should stand up to those who prefer propaganda and disinformation.”\n\nThe leading presenter was backed up by fellow senior BBC journalist John Simpson, who said his initial remarks had been “exactly right.”\n\nMr Trump’s press Secretary Karoline Leavitt, in the first comments by the White House on the row, had earlier told the Telegraph: “This purposefully dishonestly, selectively edited clip by the BBC is further evidence that they are total, 100% fake news that should no longer be worth the time on the television screens of the great people of the United Kingdom.”","summary":"The programme spliced clips together from sections of the US president’s speech on January 6 2021.","url":"https://www.standard.co.uk/showbiz/celebrity-news/bbc-boris-johnson-nick-robinson-the-telegraph-trump-b1257266.html","image":"https://static.standard.co.uk/2025/11/08/23/2c8ded54899c9276bd2c40fdcd4c3c13Y29udGVudHNlYXJjaGFwaSwxNzYyNzI4NDMw-2.49715314.jpg?width=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-11-08 23:48:35","author":"Lauren Del Fabbro","authors":["Lauren Del Fabbro"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":0.156},{"id":377138688,"title":"Russell Crowe reveals true thoughts on Prime Minister Anthony Albanese during Joe Rogan podcast","text":"Speaking on the popular podcast, Crowe said he believed Aussies were “lucky at the moment”, praising the PM as someone genuinely motivated to help his constituents after being asked by Joe Rogan: “What is wrong with Australia?” \n\n“We have a Prime Minister who’s very much motivated by trying to help everybody, which should be the job of a politician right? To improve the lives of the people they represent,” Crowe said.\n\n“He’s kind of inherited a conga line of stupidity … and he’s trying to fix things.”\n\nThe Gladiator star said the PM was working “extremely hard” and deserved credit for recent international achievements – but that political opponents and sections of the media were quick to discredit him.\n\n“He arrives off a plane the other day, just came back from some very successful international meetings where he’s established various trade things and opportunities for Australia,” he said.\n\n“(He) gets off the plane wearing a Joy Division shirt – big band from his youth – and he’s just a relaxed character. He’s been wearing a suit and tie for weeks on the road.”\n\nCrowe went on to describe how the leader of the opposition, Sussan Ley, seized the moment to criticise the shirt’s reference to “Joy Division” – a term historically associated with Nazi concentration camps.\n\n“The member of the opposition wanted to point out, and did so in parliament, that Joy Division is a Nazi term … and it’s like okay, what’s the point of that?,” Crowe said.\n\n“We all know it’s a band name, right? Just because you like the Rolling Stones doesn’t mean that you want rocks to be falling on people. What are you f***ing talking about?”\n\nThe actor said this kind of political nitpicking distracts from the real work being done, calling it a “smokescreen” that undermines genuine progress.\n\n“That’s what we’re facing all the time,” he said.\n\n“Picking up some pointless piece of minutiae and lighting it on fire to cover up the reality that the Prime Minister worked his ass off on behalf of the country and successfully achieved a bunch of things.\n\n“(He) should be patted on the back, not pushed down the stairs.”\n\nMany Aussies were divided by Crowe’s comments, with some even labelling the actor as “out of touch”.\n\n“He’s detached from the ordinary person. He spends half the time jet setting around the world, making movies, living the life. The rest of the time at his bush property. He doesn’t know what normal people are going through,” one viewer wrote.\n\n“He makes a great point at the end but he’s still totally missing the big picture because like ever other celebrity he’s completely out of touch due to his phenomenal wealth,” another said.\n\n“Oh dear. Guess I won’t be watching re runs of Gladiator any more,” another commented – a move that is sure to greatly impact Crowe’s wealth.\n\nOthers were in full support of the actor’s position.\n\n“He’s absolutely spot on. but unfortunately there’s to many fools who push BS narratives with no facts whatsoever,” one wrote.\n\n“I’m not Albo’s biggest fan but Russell hit the nail on the head with this one,” another said.\n\n“This is true. The PM is doing a great job,” a third wrote.\n\nLast month, Ms Ley used a prime-time slot in parliament to accuse Mr Albanese of “displaying the wrong values” by wearing a black T-shirt depicting the cover of Joy Division’s hit album Unknown Pleasures.\n\n“At a time when Jewish Australians are facing a rise in anti-Semitism, when families are asking for reassurance and unity, the Prime Minister chose to parade an image derived from hatred and suffering,” she said.\n\nMs Ley insisted the shirt was “not a slip of judgement” by the PM as he had been told about the “dark origins” of the name back in 2022.\n\nNone of Australia’s major Jewish organisations chose to back Ms Ley in, or complain about Mr Albanese’s choice of outfit.\n\n“There’s a lot to legitimately criticise the prime minister about … wearing a T-shirt isn’t one of them,” Shadow Infrastructure Minister Bridget McKenzie told Seven.\n\nMr Albanese recently signed a deal on rare earth minerals with Donald Trump, and was praised by the US President as a “great Prime Minister.”","summary":"Russell Crowe has revealed his true thoughts on Anthony Albanese while appearing on Joe Rogan’s podcast.","url":"https://www.news.com.au/national/politics/russell-crowe-reveals-true-thoughts-on-prime-minister-anthony-albanese-during-joe-rogan-podcast/news-story/a9088d171b786f2c1324c73f21fe56b2?from=rss-basic","image":"https://content.api.news/v3/images/bin/c50587b913298ece8b7305359b291757","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-11-08 23:48:04","author":"Ella McIlveen","authors":["Ella McIlveen"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"au","sentiment":-0.096},{"id":377146016,"title":"Nick Canepa: Offensive linemen are big, really big, parts of success","text":"Since the first football player — all hairy and slumped over and naked — climbed out of the primeval swamp and tried to block an animal that hasn’t been seen since that giant asteroid smashed into Earth, it‘s been obvious.\n\nYou cannot win without an offensive line.\n\nSo it can’t go on this way.\n\nNo matter how good the rest of your team may be, no matter how good your quarterback, no matter how skilled at the skill positions, no matter how good your defense, no matter how vaunted your head coach and his staff, you’re not lining up at the jewelry store with a decrepit offensive line.\n\nAnd that’s why the NFL Team That Used To Be Here — you know, the Judases/L.A. Lodgers — are at once terribly charmed and incredibly unlucky.\n\nAt what point is charmed swallowed whole by unlucky?\n\nIt could happen Sunday night, when the Judases (6-3) play host to the Pittsburgh Steelers (5-3) on national television’s most watched program with their 15th different O-line combination. The home team is a three-point favorite, which is a Rocky Marciano “Suzie Q” right cross to the Steelers organization and its history.\n\nThe J’s are unlucky with the loss of their two starting Pro Bowl-caliber tackles. And charmed to have Justin Herbert, who is elite with his arm, legs, mind and toughness.\n\nNo QB has been more harassed than Herbert. He’s been pressured on 21.9 percent of his dropbacks, the highest rate in The League. And yet, he leads the NFL in rushing yards among QBs and is second in completions, passing yards and passing TDs. Normally, MVP numbers.\n\nThe deadline trade with the Saints giving up a sixth round pick for guard/tackle Trevor Penning — with tackle now so bleak, that’s where Penning figures to land — may help some. But enough? Doubtful.\n\nIt all comes down to protecting quarterback Herbert, who has been pressured 165 times, 30 more than any other QB. He was sacked six times by the Titans last week and won anyway because Tennessee stinks.\n\nPittsburgh is not a great team, but its defensive line may be the best in the sport. The Colts have a terrific O-line, and yet Pittsburgh sacked Indy’s QB five times last week. Something to remember, though, is that the Steelers’ secondary is very vulnerable and the J’s defense is fairly healthy.\n\nSince Oct. 19’s 38-24 Colts debacle, the Judases’ D has allowed just 17 points. They will ride the defense for at least a mile.\n\nBut the playoff race is a mile and a quarter, the classic American distance. J’s get passed in the stretch run. …\n\nThe Padres have hired Craig Stammen as manager. Their biggest surprise since Jerry Coleman. Craig never had managed or coached baseball at any octave. Good, because it really isn’t managed correctly by anyone who has managed before. …\n\nAfter a 9 ½-hour interview, Albert Pujols didn’t get the San Diego job. Asking to go to the bathroom for the fourth time probably cost him. …\n\nThe Pads will have their 200th hitting coach since the opening of Petco. Word is A.J. Preller has contacted Rasputin. …\n\nWe have no way of knowing how good a manager Stammen will be, although even saints agree the man is a saint. But did you know Pujols would be a great manager? Don’t lie. You did not. …\n\nA good thing. The Pads have picked up Ramón Laureano’s $6.5 million option for 2026. Good player. One of their few clutch guys, and they lost him for the playoffs. …\n\nBad enough the Dodgers got incredibly lucky and won the Series. Do San Diego news outlets have to show their victory parade? We hate these guys. …\n\nI’m tired of watching teams I can’t stand. Dodgers, Broncos, Chiefs, Raiders. Somebody help me. …\n\nI keep hearing it was a great World Series? It was poorly played and probably the most mismanaged Series I can recall. Close games don’t mean great games. Or didn’t you watch Raiders-Broncos? …\n\nWhy do coaches leave their stars in either-way blowouts? The Jayden Daniels injury — with the Commanders hopelessly out of it against the Seahawks with half the fourth quarter remaining — was totally preventable. Daniels has one knock: He’s frail. And he’s missed games with injuries. …\n\nKnow what a fleecing is? What the Jets did to the Colts, even cutting off their manes, sending cornerback Sauce Gardner to the Colts for two No. 1s. Sauce is fine, but The Jets are 17-38 with him, and no corner who ever lived is worth two ones. …\n\nThe Jets picked up another first, trading fine defensive tackle Quinnen Williams to Dallas. Hard to say who won this. One DT isn’t helping the Cowboys’ hopeless defense — especially its secondary — and the Jets may not stop somebody if they become school crossing guards. …\n\nThe SEC, the unbreakable football conference, now has fired 25 percent of its coaches. As the Chambers Brothers sang: “The rules have changed today. I have no place to stay.” …\n\nNebraska has zero wins in its last 30 games vs. ranked opponents. Where’s George Costanza? Was that wrong? …\n\nThe Padres may miss Robert Suarez, but I won’t. Never had a shred of confidence he was going to get the job done. …\n\nRIP, Woody Lowe. Terrific player. Good guy. Unfortunately, his near-should-have-been-a-sack of Ken Stabler started the Holy Roller. He also made the play that ended the great Dan Fouts-Joe Montana battle in San Francisco. …\n\nBoise State men’s basketball, picked to finish third in the Mountain West, lost 79-78 at home to Hawaii Pacific, which is Division II. HP plays in a gym that would be small for junior highs here, and the school literally is in an old strip mall. …\n\nNo school in America had a worse week than Boise. Its football team lost 30-7 at Fresno State. …\n\nClemson’s Dabo Swinney says that, if coaches and players are being investigated for gambling, officials should be, too. Couldn’t agree more. …\n\nAntonio Brown. The classic case of a Hall of Fame talent going bad. …\n\nBrian Kelly says his vision for LSU didn’t go as he hoped. He had a vision? So did Apostle Paul on the road to Damascus. …\n\nTom Brady has a new dog, one he cloned from his pooch who passed away. Now half of the NFL general managers are offering Tom untold millions to clone himself. …\n\nMike Vrabel, when asked if his Pats were close to making a trade: “Deals are like being pregnant. You either are or you aren’t. So I don’t know how close you can be.” …\n\nThe NBA’s minimum salary is $1.37 million. It’s a bad league. Unwatchable. How does it survive? I’m afraid to know. …\n\nHey, what’s with these short shorts kickers are wearing? They have to be outlawed. What’s next, Speedos? Kickers. …\n\nDonald Trump wants the Commanders’ new D.C. stadium named for himself. At least there will be a new record for naming rights: $0.00. …\n\nPeter Seidler Way has a nice ring to it. Way to go. …\n\nThere’s a new term for Black Friday: November.","summary":"NIck Canepa praises offensive linemen in his weekly trip around the sports world.","url":"https://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/2025/11/08/nick-canepa-offensive-linemen-are-big-really-big-parts-of-success/","image":"https://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/AP25306697559921.jpg?w=1600&resize=1600,900","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-11-08 23:41:34","author":"Nick Canepa","authors":["Nick Canepa"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.098},{"id":377139392,"title":"Bill Maher eviscerates press coverage of White House ballroom, says he doesn’t ‘give a s–t’","text":"On Friday’s episode of “Real Time,” host Bill Maher asserted his indifference about President Donald Trump remodeling the East Wing of the White House into a ballroom and slammed the media for their coverage of the project.\n\n“The ballroom, I don’t give a s—. I really don’t give a s—,” Maher said. “I was reading — it shows you how the media is. Everything is always on one side or the other. When [Trump] first mentioned it, it was all about, ‘Oh, my God, he’s desecrating the White House.’ \n\n“Then I finally read, ‘Oh, well, they’ve done s— to the White House before.’”\n\n“It’s just a building, I think,” he added.\n\nRejecting the White House’s current setup, where state dinners have been held in tents, Maher exclaimed, “This is America!”\n\nAside from criticizing the media’s “one side or the other” coverage of the remodel, Maher suggested that the ballroom may actually be a worthwhile investment, considering state dinners are currently hosted “in a tent.”\n\n“Also, I realized after reading other people, we don’t have a place when they have state dinners,” he said. “They’re doing it in a tent! This is America! So do I give a s— that he’s doing this to the White House? I really don’t.”\n\nMaher also pointed to the fact that the ballroom is being funded by “private money,” and isn’t being subsidized by American tax dollars.\n\nThis isn’t the HBO host’s first time commenting on Trump’s ballroom project. Last month he sounded the alarm on the “symbolism” behind the president’s addition to the White House and revealed what “bothers” him about the demolition of the East Wing.\n\n“The symbolism is he’s not leaving,” Maher told his panel. “Who puts in a giant ballroom if you’re leaving?”\n\nAlthough Maher objected to Trump’s demolition, he sparred with former Republican National Committee Chairman Michael Steele over whether the White House is “just a building.”\n\n“We watched this week the destruction of a symbol of this government,” Steele lamented. “Of our democracy, of our pluralistic society.”\n\n“You’re talking about the White House?” Maher countered. “Oh, it’s a building, Mike.”\n\nLater in the segment, Steele said that Trump had torn the East Wing down “without accountability.” The late-night host said he agreed with Steele on that.\n\n“You know, he should have gotten the permits, but that’s how he does things,” Maher said. “I agree, but it is just a building, first of all.”\n\n“That part of the building wasn’t always there,” he continued. “Presidents do change the buildings. Nixon put in a bowling alley. Obama made the tennis court a basketball court. I can’t get this mad about everything, Mike. I just can’t.”\n\nTrump’s privately funded $200 million White House ballroom is the latest “bold, necessary addition” to the executive residence, officials said, describing the East Wing construction as a continuation of presidential upgrades dating back more than a century.\n\nThroughout its 223-year history, the iconic residence has seen numerous updates — both large and small — under nearly every administration.","summary":"Rejecting the White House’s current setup, where state dinners have been held in tents, Maher exclaimed, 'This is America.'","url":"https://nypost.com/2025/11/08/media/bill-maher-eviscerates-press-coverage-of-white-house-ballroom-says-he-doesnt-give-a-s-t/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/11/115048319.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/N9ntYOWL-RyIcpnTz.mp4","publish_date":"2025-11-08 23:33:32","author":"Fox News","authors":["Fox News"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"zm","sentiment":-0.155},{"id":377145678,"title":"AI has arrived, what’s the point of living?","text":"At nearly 75 years, I have for long endorsed Bob Hope’s dictum: “I’m not afraid of dying but I don’t want to be around when it happens.” But, of late, I am more inclined to go with “Death, where is thy sting?” by the Apostle Paul, in 1 Corinthians of the New Testament. The simple reason is that I can no longer cope with the tectonic changes taking place in a world where AI means Artificial Intelligence and not the more familiar Artificial Insemination people of my generation were used to.I’ve always been scientifically challenged: in school, I thought a light year was one when you didn’t get any homework for the vacations, and even as a grown-up, I am convinced that the reason I can’t get out of bed in the morning is because of Newton’s First Law: a body at rest will continue to be at rest unless acted upon by an external force. That external force is Neerja, which only proves my point (and Newton’s). I guess what I’m trying to convey is that I lack the knowledge to make any sense of technological “progress”.For example, I cannot figure out what has happened to my email — I no longer receive mails from ladies. I discovered this the other day: someone, or something, has installed malware in my laptop which automatically filters out all mails sent by females. It could be Neerja, or it could be Trump with his misogynistic brain, but the point is: what the hell am I supposed to do? And what’s next — will they also filter mails from homosexuals, lesbians (sorry, they’re already out), my editors, anti-bhakts, Mani Shankar Aiyar and Kangana Ranaut? If so, then what’s the point of going on living?I can’t wrap my head around this Artificial Intelligence and robotic thingy either; compared to Trumpian and “andh-bhakt” intelligence, it’s a god-given gift and we should be welcoming it. But I believe it’s wiping out millions of jobs, and that the time is not far off when we will be to robots what dogs are to us — loyal, but totally confused.The optimists tell us that AI will delete jobs but will create new ones, but the problem is no one can tell which jobs it will create. Bill Gates recently said in an interview that only three types of jobs will remain — energy sector related, biological sciences and coding for AI itself. For us non-techie types, most of whom swarm the IAS, the only remaining jobs will be that of horse whisperers, dog walkers, tarot card readers and vaastu planners. There will be no re-employment after retirement either.Of course, Gates missed out on one job that will survive against all odds — politicians. They are a mutant sub-species of homo sapiens known as homo crapiens. Unlike the former, they did not emerge from Africa but from the cesspools that were the inevitable result of apes descending from the trees and living in groups. They evolved slowly over the last 5,000 years or so, gradually losing their vmPFC (ventromedial prefrontal cortex), which enables us to have a conscience and moral sense of right and wrong. This is precisely what the AI robots also lack; consequently, there is no difference between homo crapiens and AI. Which is why AI will never replace politicians. Mr Gates might like to make a note of this.And things are soon going to get whackier. In a few years, we shall be able to opt for designer babies with Einstein’s beauty and Kangana Ranaut’s brains, who will probably be home delivered by Blinkit; women will be eternally safe because their nether garments shall henceforth be password protected or have facial recognition features embedded in them; a new species of homo sapiens will emerge — cybernetic nerds — which will be a blend of human bodies and AI chips (Donald Trump may be a prototype).Astrologers will go extinct because ChatGPT will now predict your future — not a difficult job, because the said future will be the same for just about everybody except the multi-billionaires. Nobody will have a job, no one will be married because the female bots will be far more attractive than the female of our species. No one will die of old age, everyone shall die of boredom and ennui because there will be nothing for them to do except to listen to Mann Ki Baat.I’m ready to walk into the sunset, folks, even if it is AI-generated.— The writer is a retired IAS officer","summary":"The author, a 75-year-old retired IAS officer, grapples with rapid technological advancements like AI, finding them incomprehensible and unsettling.

a swipe at his premiership.\n\nAnother effigy showed a crazed-looking Sir Keir, complete with glowing, bright eyes and disheveled glasses, holding a dislodged steering wheel in the air as he rode a tractor with 'all lies Starmer' written on the front. \n\nIn Edenbridge Sir Keir beat Andrew Mountbatten Windsor and Andrew Tate to be voted as the centrepiece for this Saturday's event. \n\nEarlier this year Labour's inheritance tax raid on farmers sparked protests throughout the UK as the party was warned it would spell the end of farm shops.\n\nEdenbridge Bonfire Society has gained a reputation for using their effigy's to poke fun at celebrities, as well as politicians and their decision-making since 1994.\n\nAmong their previous targets include, Liz Truss, Boris Johnson, Donald Trump as well as London Mayor Sadiq Khan and his ULEZ policy.\n\nLast year the group previously took aim at Ticketmaster amid outrage over the sites dynamic pricing as fans scrambled to buy Oasis tickets last year.\n\nThis year however, the creators wanted to take the tradition back to its more political roots.\n\nBill Cummings, chairman of the Bonfire Society, said: 'This decision is a great opportunity to remind everyone why we have Bonfire Night in the first place, a message that has perhaps been forgotten over more recent years.'\n\nSir Keir also has his own links to the area having been raised in nearby Oxted and is said to have been part of one of the local football teams in Edenbridge.\n\nAndrea Deans, one of the creators of this year's effigy, said: 'We feel the public have chosen well this year when you look at how the current government is treating its citizens.\n\n'There were so many elements we could include on the effigy, and it was interesting working out how these could be represented visually.","summary":"The 36-foot high effigy was burned during the annual Edenbridge bonfire celebrations on November 8 in Edenbridge, Kent.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-15272927/Now-massive-effigy-fire-PM-Sir-Keir-Starmer-set-alight-Guy-Fawkes-night-event.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/11/08/22/103716625-0-image-a-10_1762639651825.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-11-08 23:22:52","author":"Editor,Olivia Allhusen","authors":["Editor","Olivia Allhusen"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":0.185},{"id":377135824,"title":"Trailer Park Boys star Mike Smith charged with sexual assault","text":"Home and Garden\n\nKim Kardashian\n\nVictoria Beckham\n\nHarry Styles\n\nAmanda Holden\n\nPrivacy Policy\n\nSaturday, Nov 8th 2025\n\n5-Day Forecast\n\nAdvertisement\n\nKing Charles appears moved during heartfelt rendition of the national anthem at Festival of Remembrance -

The Mamdani we saw on the campaign trail was much calmer, warmer, and more inclusive, and that was missing from his speech,’ Jones commented.\n\n‘That’s the Mamdani people needed to hear from tonight. Many are still deciding whether to support him. Will he include them? Will he become a class warrior even in office?’\n\nJones added, ‘He missed a chance to open up and welcome more people. His tone was sharp, and at times it felt like he was almost yelling through the microphone.’\n\n‘And that’s not the Mamdani that we’ve seen on TikTok and the great interviews and stuff like that.’ \n\nMamdani romped to victory with 50.4 percent support on Tuesday, defeating former New York Governor Andrew Cuomo at 41.6 percent and Republican Curtis Sliwa at 7.1 percent. \n\nMamdani took a swipe at his political opponents in his blistering address, including directing his remarks directly at the White House. \n\n‘Donald Trump, since I know you’re watching, I have four words for you: Turn the volume up!’ he said.\n\n‘If any city can show a nation how to stop Donald Trump, it is the city that gave rise to him,’ said Mamdani, who represents a district in the same borough of Queens where the President was raised.\n\n‘So, if there is any way to terrify a despot, it is by dismantling the very conditions that allowed him to accumulate power. This is not only how we stop Trump, it’s how we stop the next one.’\n\nBut the speech failed to impress CNN pundit Jones, who said he hoped Mamdani would have offered a message of unity instead of attacking others. \n\n‘I felt like it was a little bit of a character switch here, where the warm, open, embracing guy that’s close to working people was not on stage tonight,’ the panelist said. \n\n‘And there were some other voice on stage. That said, he’s very young. And he just pulled off something very, very difficult. \n\n‘And I wouldn’t write him off, but I think he missed an opportunity to open himself up tonight. And I think that that will probably cost him going forward.’ \n\nMamdani’s victory capped a clean sweep for Democrats in the few big races of this off-year election, as Mikie Sherrill of New Jersey and Abigail Spanberger of Virginia easily won governor’s races. \n\nGovernor Gavin Newsom’s Prop 50 campaign, which will redraw California’s congressional map and likely hand the Democrats five extra House of Representatives seats, also passed.\n\nIn the wake of his victory, Newsom urged Blue states across the nation to follow his lead and redraw their congressional maps to counter Trump’s efforts.\n\nNewsom said the plan could ‘de facto end Donald Trump’s presidency’ by the 2026 midterms, preventing the White House from instating many of its policies if Democrats retake the House.\n\n‘It is all on the line,’ he said. ‘We need to see other states, with their remarkable leaders that have been doing remarkable things, meet this moment head-on as well.\n\nRepublican Curtis Sliwa fell to just 7.1 percent support in the race despite polling near Cuomo during the campaign.\n\nHe slammed Cuomo’s wealthy backers for hurting his campaign in the final stretch as he grew emotional in his concession speech. \n\n‘The Masters of the Universe, the billionaires, decided that I should not have the right to represent all of you,’ Sliwa said.\n\n‘To be the voice of the voiceless, the working class people who are the backbone of this city.’\n\nSliwa alleged that he had been offered $10 million to drop his campaign to help former New York Governor Andrew Cuomo’s candidacy, but told his supporters: ‘I do not have a price.’\n\nThe Republican had been accused of helping Mamdani’s campaign by siphoning off votes from Cuomo.\n\nBut Sliwa excoriated Mamdani in his final speech, warning him not to enact a raft of far-left policies that experts have said could cripple the city’s economy.\n\n‘Let me warn our new leader, if you try to implement socialism, if you try to render our police weak and impotent, if you forsake the people’s public safety, we’re not only organizing, but we are mobilizing,’ he said.\n\n‘We will become the mayor-elect and his supporters’ worst enemy.’","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nVan Jones of CNN expressed criticism of Zohran Mamdani&#8217;s victory speech on&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Van Jones Expresses Concerns Over NYC Mayor-Elect Zohran Mamdani&#8217;s Fiery Speech Stirring Controversy Among Voters first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/world-news/van-jones-expresses-concerns-over-nyc-mayor-elect-zohran-mamdanis-fiery-speech-stirring-controversy-among-voters/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Van-Jones-blasts-Mamdanis-victory-speech.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-11-08 23:19:11","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.028},{"id":377142304,"title":"Why Texas Democrat James Talarico is Facing Backlash Over Following Porn Actors, OnlyFans Models on Instagram","text":"James Talarico, a Democratic candidate for the US Senate from Texas who has made his Christian faith central to his campaign, is facing scrutiny after an Axios report found that he follows several adult film performers, escorts and OnlyFans models on Instagram. Talarico, 36, a state lawmaker and seminary student, has become a rising figure in Texas politics, drawing attention for describing his faith as the foundation of his Democratic values. He has argued that Christian voters have been alienated from the Democratic Party and says his mission is to win them back by highlighting what he views as inconsistencies between Republican policies — particularly on immigration — and biblical principles. The report by Axios said Talarico's Instagram account follows 10 accounts belonging to women described as adult film performers or models with profiles on escort-related sites. The report also noted that he had \"liked\" non-explicit photos from one account linked to an Austin-based OnlyFans model earlier this year. In response, a campaign spokesperson said the activity was unintentional. \"The social media team — including James — follows back and engages with supporters who have large followings and does not investigate their backgrounds,\" Talarico's spokesperson JT Ennis said in a statement. Ennis added that Talarico's Instagram account, which has more than 1.7 million followers and follows roughly 3,700 others, is managed jointly by the candidate and his campaign team. \"James has never subscribed to OnlyFans or an escort service,\" Ennis said. \"While James was unaware of how these women make money, he does not judge them for it and will not play into an effort to smear them for clickbait articles. That's exactly what his Christian faith calls him to do.\" The campaign shared a screenshot of one brief exchange between Talarico's account and one of the women's accounts, showing a simple \"thank you\" message after she appeared to promote his campaign on Instagram. Talarico's Senate campaign, launched in September, draws heavily on biblical imagery and social justice themes. His campaign website compares his call for political reform to the biblical account of Jesus driving money changers from the temple. \"Two thousand years ago, when the powerful few rigged the system, that barefoot rabbi walked into the seat of power and flipped over the tables of injustice,\" the site reads. \"To those who love our country, to those who love our neighbours: It's time to start flipping tables.\" Talarico's approach has attracted attention from across the political spectrum. Former President Barack Obama recently described him as \"terrific\" and \"really talented\" in a conversation with podcaster Marc Maron, while Joe Rogan — who endorsed Donald Trump in 2024 — praised Talarico during a podcast appearance and urged him to consider a future presidential run. The Texas Democrat is among the leading contenders in the 2026 Senate race, alongside former US Representative Colin Allred, who lost to Senator Ted Cruz in 2024. On the Republican side, Senator John Cornyn is facing a primary challenge from Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton. Analysts say Democrats see an opportunity to flip the seat if Republicans nominate Paxton, who has been embroiled in legal and ethical controversies.

Gavin Newsom in Texas on Saturday told a crowd that Democrats winning back the House of Representatives in 2026 is \"the whole thing.\" Newsom, 58, continued to ride high over the weekend, four days after California’s Proposition 50 — to redistrict the state’s congressional map in favor of Democrats — passed in a landslide. Newsom also couldn’t resist taking a jab at his frequent foe, President Donald Trump. \"He is an historic president, however — historically unpopular,\" he told the crowd in Houston. \"And he had a very bad night on Tuesday.\" OBAMA CALLS NEWSOM'S CALIFORNIA REDISTRICTING MOVE A 'RESPONSIBLE APPROACH' TO GOP TACTICS Along with Prop 50 in California, Democrats also won gubernatorial races in New Jersey and Virginia and Democratic socialist Zohran Mamdani handily beat Democrat-turned-Independent candidate Andrew Cuomo in the New York City mayoral election. Proposition 50 was a response to Texas’ legislature redistricting their congressional map in favor of Republicans over the summer, and on Tuesday after Proposition 50 passed, Newsom called on other Democratic states to follow suit. \"We need to see other states, their remarkable leaders that have been doing remarkable things, meet this moment head-on as well,\" he said in a late-night news conference on Tuesday. \"We can de facto end Donald Trump’s presidency as we know it, the minute Speaker Jeffries gets sworn in as speaker of the House of Representatives. It is all on the line.\" NEWSOM SET TO RALLY TEXAS DEMS WITH VICTORY LAP DAYS AFTER PROP 50 PASSES: 'CALIFORNIA STEPPED UP' He continued his celebration on Saturday, telling the crowd: \"There were lines around the block two hours after polling had stopped because people wanted to be heard, not just seen, they wanted to send a message. But as I said, we cannot rest until we take it back.\" The governor reiterated, \"There is no more important race in our lifetimes than the House of Representatives, and taking back the House and getting speaker [Hakeem] Jeffries sworn in next November. It's the whole thing. It's the whole thing.\" \"And so that starts today,\" he continued. \"It started on Tuesday.\" Newsom added, \"We can shape the future here in Texas. We can shape the future all across the South and across the United States of America. You have that power.\" Trump and the GOP have spearheaded an effort to pad the party's razor-thin House majority to keep control of the chamber in the 2026 midterms, when the party in power traditionally faces political headwinds and loses seats. Missouri, North Carolina, and Ohio have drawn new maps as part of the president's push. Trump is aiming to prevent what happened during his first term in the White House when Democrats reclaimed the House majority in the 2018 midterm elections. Although he hasn’t announced his intentions to run for president, Newsom has been widely seen as a possible frontrunner for Democrats in the 2028 presidential election. CLICK HERE TO DOWNLOAD THE FOX NEWS APP While two other Democratic blue state governors with likely national ambitions in 2028, JB Pritzker of Illinois and Wes Moore of Maryland, are mulling new maps in their states to create one or two more blue-leaning congressional districts, Newsom has been the most visible leader so far in the redistricting wars and the first Democrat to succeed.

After the show I sold it off - for £7,500!' she said ahead of entering the jungle for all-stars in 2023.\nThe famous tiny white bikini was auctioned for charity for £7,500 and Myleene later revealed it was a last-minute purchase.\n\nKelly is famed for her hourglass curves and first found fame after forging a career as a lingerie model and Page Three girl for The Daily Star (pictured in 2000)\n\nMyleene has been spotted time and time again in white bikinis over the years, even playing the I'm A Celeb theme tune on the piano while wearing one to promote 2023 all-stars series\n\nBREAKING NEWS Kelly Brook flashes a huge smile as she jets off to Australia ahead of I'm A Celeb stint as model joins comedy legend and soap icon in the line-up \nMyleene has been spotted time and time again in white bikinis over the years, even playing the I'm A Celeb theme tune on the piano while wearing one to promote 2023 all-stars series.\nBack in 2018, Kelly said there would be 'a million' other things she would rather do like working in her local pub, than appear in the jungle. \n'I don't want to eat eyeballs or sheep testicles and all the things they have to eat on there,' she said on her Heart radio show.\n'Even if I had a huge tax bill and I had to pay it really urgently, I still wouldn't do it.'\nBut it was thought she was finally persuaded by a big money deal as she joins soap, music and comedy legends in the line-up ahead of the show's return later this month. \nAlso heading down under is comedy legend Ruby Wax, 72, whose best known work includes TV show Girls On Top and film Shock, and she has also written for BBC programme Absolutely Fabulous. \nThe show has also signed soap icons Shona McGarty, who played Whitney Dean on EastEnders between 2008 to 2024, and Emmerdale's Lisa Riley, known for her role as Mandy Dingle.\nThey will join actor and Spandau Ballet star Martin Kemp, 64, as well as broadcasters Alex Scott, 41, and Vogue Williams, 40.\nJack Osbourne, 39, is also set to enter camp just four months after his rocker father Ozzy's tragic death.\nMyleene KlassKelly BrookI'm A CelebrityITV\n\nShare or comment on this article: \nKelly Brook 'set to recreate Myleene Klass' iconic I'm A Celeb shower moment in a bid to have her moment and shine'\n\nAdd comment\n\nComments 75\n\n Share what you think\n\nWorst rated\n\nThe comments below have not been moderated.\n\nThe views expressed in the contents above are those of our users and do not necessarily reflect the views of MailOnline.\n\nAdd your comment\n\nEnter your comment\n\nBy posting your comment you agree to our house rules.\n\nSubmit Comment\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual.\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual\n\nWe will automatically post your comment and a link to the news story to your Facebook timeline at the same time it is posted on MailOnline.

Tuesday’s results underscore the extent to which the political and economic paradigm has shifted for Trump from his electoral victory a year ago, a period in which he aggressively reshaped Washington with little opposition. Now, the 2026 midterms are shaping up as a much tougher referendum on his political brand. Polls — and the GOP’s electoral setback — indicate voters have grown weary of the president’s firebrand politics and uneven stewardship of the economy.\n\nEager to maintain Republican control of the House and Senate, Trump has resorted to drastic measures. He’s directed Republican governors to redraw congressional districts in order to create more GOP House seats. He’s also demanded Republican Senate leaders scrap the filibuster rule to pass national restrictions on mail-in voting and voter identification requirements, arguing without evidence that elections have been plagued by widespread fraud.\n\nTrump has promised a rare national Republican convention ahead of the midterms to rally his base. He’s also expected to step up his travel in 2026 as part of his midterms push, people close to the White House said, though he has thus far taken few political trips. Aides say he also plans to refocus his message around the cost of living, which swung the off-year elections against the GOP in New York City, Virginia, New Jersey and elsewhere.\n\n“The only problem is the Republicans don’t talk about it and Republicans should start talking about it and use their heads,” Trump told reporters Thursday as he discussed his party’s political woes around affordability issues.\n\nShould Republicans lose their congressional majorities, an emboldened Democratic Party would be poised to rein in Trump’s policies on trade, taxes, immigration and the federal workforce. They’d also be empowered to launch congressional investigations, backed by subpoena power, into a wide swath of presidential actions, risking embarrassing or politically inconvenient revelations.\n\nSuch an outcome could also shatter the image of strength Trump has wielded to maintain an iron grip on his party and dominate his opponents, while forcing him to stare down his own political mortality as his party begins charting the contest to succeed him.\n\nPeople close to the president say he’s desperate to avoid a repeat of the midterms during his first term, when Democrats won control of the House. Trump’s legislative agenda stalled and he was impeached twice.\n\nBarred from appearing on the ballot in 2028, Trump is also grappling with ways to avoid the “lame duck” final years of a president’s second term — including by floating an end-run around the Constitution to run again before acknowledging it’s not allowed.\n\nDemocratic candidates won top-tier and down-ballot races around the country by focusing on cost-of-living issues that dominate voters’ attention. That revealed the risks of Trump’s freewheeling style; the president’s attention the last few weeks has been on negotiations with China, meetings with foreign leaders and his White House renovations.\n\nIt also served as a reminder that Trump’s supporters don’t necessarily vote when he is not on the ballot, a problem Republicans will have to confront again next year.\n\nTrump’s reaction also underscored that he may not be Republicans’ most helpful midterm messenger. This week, he declared on social media that “the Democrats ‘affordability’ issue is dead,” even as his advisers acknowledged the need to focus more on lower prices.\n\nOther Republicans warned voters could punish the party again if leaders downplay their concerns.\n\n“There is an affordability issue,” said Rep. Don Bacon, a Nebraska Republican who is not running for reelection. “Gas prices are down, but most people at the supermarket aren’t seeing any improvement.”\n\nRecent polls show an unhappy electorate, an encouraging sign for Democrats’ chances to win back the narrowly divided House of Representatives. Trump’s approval rating stood at 37% and his disapproval at 63%, according to a CNN poll released this week. Surveys also show Democratic voters are more energized than Republicans heading into the midterms.\n\n“The Democratic Party is full steam ahead to take back Congress next year,” Democratic National Committee Chair Ken Martin said this week on a call with reporters.\n\nShutdown politics\n\nThe government shutdown is also driving public frustration, as federal workers miss paychecks, food aid is delayed and flights have been canceled. Polling shows Republicans are shouldering more of the blame, but Trump has refused to meet with Democrats to negotiate a compromise. Instead, he has called on Republicans to abolish the filibuster to reopen the government, despite leaders’ insistence they lack the votes.\n\nStill, Trump allies argue he has some clear advantages going into 2026 that he did not have in 2018. He has consolidated Republicans around his agenda, Democratic opposition still has not matched the energy following Trump’s surprise 2016 win and he has raised immense sums of money through Trump-associated political action committees.\n\nSome Republicans also said that this week’s results weren’t representative of the country as a whole because they largely came in Democratic states and their party was plagued by weak candidates.\n\nThe GOP-aligned Senate Leadership Fund sent a memo to donors, reviewed by Bloomberg News, which argued that while Democrats did better than expected this week, they over-performed in Democratic states that Trump lost in 2024. Looking ahead to the midterms, it said that Senate Republicans have winning candidates in Trump-won states and that they are in a strong position to hold the chamber.\n\nTrump took a relatively hands-off approach to this year’s contests. He did not campaign in person in New Jersey or Virginia with Republican gubernatorial candidates, instead opting for virtual rallies. Trump’s vocal opposition to democratic socialist Zohran Mamdani helped fuel his winning campaign for New York City mayor, though the president’s party is also poised to use the mayor-elect as a foil.\n\n“The decision facing all Americans could not be more clear. We have a choice between communism and common sense,” Trump said Wednesday at an event in Miami.\n\nRedistricting fight\n\nOne of the ways Trump has worked to bolster his party’s standing in 2026 is to trigger a redistricting arms race between red and blue states. Texas Republicans redrew their state’s map to add five GOP-leaning seats outside of the typical once-a-decade cycle. In response, California Gov. Gavin Newsom got voters to approve a map that could net Democrats five seats there, enough to counter Texas’ changes.\n\nTrump has also urged other Republican-controlled states, including Missouri and Indiana, to follow Texas’ lead. That has energized Democrats to jump into the fight. Former President Barack Obama, among the party’s most popular figures, denounced the GOP maneuvers as an “existential threat” to American democracy.\n\nTrump has also returned to a long-running fixation, mail-in voting, promising an executive order curbing the now-common practice. He has long made unsubstantiated allegations that his 2020 election loss to Joe Biden was tainted by fraudulent ballots.\n\nPeter Loge, director of the School of Media and Public Affairs at George Washington University, said that traveling to promote legislation is standard politicking but Trump is aiming for something more.\n\n“One way you win a game is trying to change the rules to favor your side,” he said.","summary":"Sweeping Democratic wins have given new urgency to President Donald Trump’s efforts to midterm-proof his second term, with the president keenly aware of the consequences if Republicans lose control of Congress.","url":"https://www.bostonherald.com/2025/11/08/trump-reeling-from-election-night-tightens-focus-on-midterms/","image":"https://www.bostonherald.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/donald-trump.jpg?w=1600&resize=1600,900","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-11-08 23:07:47","author":"Bloomberg News","authors":["Bloomberg News"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.023},{"id":377143204,"title":"Weekend session gets off to slow start in Senate as lawmakers look for a way out of shutdown","text":"WASHINGTON (AP) — The Senate’s first weekend session since the beginning of the shutdown yielded few signs of progress Saturday as Senate Majority Leader John Thune’s wish for a quick vote never materialized.\n\nThe impasse that has lasted 39 days is taking an increasing toll on the country as federal workers go unpaid, airlines cancel flights and SNAP benefits have been delayed for millions of Americans.\n\nSaturday’s session got off to a rough start when President Donald Trump made clear he is unlikely to compromise any time soon with Democrats who are seeking a one-year extension of Affordable Care Act tax credits. He said on social media that it is “the worst Healthcare anywhere in the world” and suggested Congress send money directly to people to buy insurance.\n\nThune said Trump’s proposal would not be part of a solution to ending the shutdown, but added “it is a discussion that the president and all of us want to have.” Republican senators who spoke on the Senate floor Saturday generally echoed Trump’s assessment.\n\n“I guarantee you every day we keep this system in place is a great day for the health care insurance companies who have been making out literally like bandits every day under Obamacare,” said Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C.\n\nSen. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., said he welcomed Republicans to the fight when it came to insurance companies, “but that shouldn’t come at the cost of kicking millions off of their health care in January.”\n\nSenate Republican leaders have signaled an openness to an emerging proposal from a small group of moderate Democrats to end the shutdown in exchange for a later vote on the “Obamacare” subsidies, which make coverage more affordable. For those enrolled in Affordable Care Act exchanges, premiums on average are expected to more than double next year if Congress allows the enhanced subsidies to lapse.\n\nSen. Jeanne Shaheen, D-N.H., who is leading the talks among moderates, said Friday evening that Democrats “need another path forward” after Republicans rejected an offer from Democratic leader Chuck Schumer of New York to reopen the government and extend the subsidies for a year. “We’re working on it,” she said.\n\nModerates continue to negotiate\n\nShaheen and others, negotiating among themselves and with some rank-and-file Republicans, have been discussing bills that would pay for parts of government — food aid, veterans programs and the legislative branch, among other things — and extend funding for everything else until December or January. The agreement would only come with the promise of a future health care vote, rather than a guarantee of extended subsidies.\n\nIt was unclear whether enough Democrats would support such a plan. Even with a deal, Trump appears unlikely to support an extension of the health benefits. House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., also said this week that he would not commit to a health vote.\n\nRepublican leaders only need five additional votes to fund the government, and the group involved in the talks has ranged from 10 to 12 Democratic senators.\n\nSome Republicans have said they are open to extending the COVID-19-era tax credits as premiums could skyrocket for millions of people, but they want new limits on who can receive the subsidies. They lined up Saturday to take to the Senate floor and argue that subsidies for the plans should be routed through individuals.\n\n“We’re going to replace this broken system with something that is actually better for the consumer,” Graham said.\n\nRepublicans eye new package of bills\n\nTrump wants Republicans to end the shutdown quickly and scrap the filibuster, which requires 60 Senate votes for most legislation, so they can bypass Democrats altogether. Vice President JD Vance, a former Ohio senator, endorsed the idea in an online post Saturday, saying Republicans who want to keep the filibuster are “wrong.”\n\nRepublicans have rejected Trump’s call, and Thune is eyeing a bipartisan package that mirrors the proposal the moderate Democrats have been sketching out. What Thune, who has refused to negotiate, might promise on health care is unknown.\n\nThe package would replace the House-passed legislation that the Democrats have rejected 14 times since the shutdown began Oct. 1. The current bill would only extend government funding until Nov. 21.\n\nA choice for Democrats\n\nA test vote on new legislation could come in the next few days if Thune decides to move forward.\n\nThen Democrats would have a crucial choice: Keep fighting for a meaningful deal on extending the subsidies that expire in January, while prolonging the pain of the shutdown? Or vote to reopen the government and hope for the best as Republicans promise an eventual health care vote, but not a guaranteed outcome.\n\nSchumer on Saturday persisted in arguing that Republicans should accept a one-year extension of the subsidies before negotiating the future of the tax credits.\n\n“Doing nothing is derelict because people will go bankrupt, people will lose insurance, people will get sicker,” Schumer said in a floor speech. “That’s what will happen if this Congress fails to act.”\n\nAssociated Press writers Seung Min Kim, Joey Cappelletti and Lisa Mascaro contributed to this report.\n\n(Copyright (c) 2025 The Associated Press.

Aviation enthusiast Ian Recchio spotted an unusual weapon while snapping military aircraft over California's Owen Valley. Pictures taken on 29 October show a US Air Force B-52 Stratofortress carrying an unidentified weapon under its right wing, which experts believe could be the AGM-181 Long Range Stand Off Weapon (LRSO), according to The Aviationist. The AGM-181 LRSO, touted as the Air Force's next-generation stealth nuclear cruise missile, is set to equip both the B-52 and the newly constructed B-21 stealth bomber. The Aviationist pointed out that the warhead aboard the jet bears a striking resemblance to the only public image of the AGM-181 LRSO released in June, reports the Mirror . The bomber in the photograph also displays the classic orange markings associated with test flights, The Aviationist added. While the exact missile could not be independently confirmed, the B-52 has served as America's strategic long-range bomber for nearly seven decades. The AGM‐181 LRSO, currently undergoing testing, is expected to carry the W80‐4 warhead, with a reported yield of 5 to 150 kilotons - making its maximum blast approximately ten times that of the Hiroshima bomb in 1945. The missile, anticipated to be ready for service by 2030, is designed to replace the Cold War-era AGM‐86 ALCM, a subsonic air-launched cruise missile. Recchio told The Aviationist: \"I was plane spotting with a friend @661aviation in the Owens Valley when we heard 'Torch52' entering the low-level at 'point Alpha' on the scanner. \"It's always a treat to see a heavy down low but, by the time Torch had reached our position, it had climbed to about 5,000 feet, still low enough and large enough to get a decent photograph. We snapped a few images which revealed some interesting ordinance attached to one of the weapons pylons.\" The spotting emerges as America steps up work to modernise its nuclear weapons stockpile amidst increasing pressure from Russia and China. Russia carried out trials of its nuclear-powered Burevestnik cruise missile in late October, with Moscow claiming it can bypass air defences and fly almost indefinitely. \"We have launched a multi-hour flight of a nuclear-powered missile and it covered a 14,000km (8,700-mile) distance, which is not the limit,\" Chief of General Staff Valery Gerasimov told President Vladimir Putin in a televised meeting. Just days ago, Trump declared on Truth Social that he had instructed defence chiefs to \"start testing our nuclear weapons on an equal basis\" with competing nations. Energy Secretary Chris Wright subsequently made clear that America isn't planning nuclear detonations, noting that any trials would be \"non-critical explosions\". The Federation of American Scientists (FAS) estimates that Russia has approximately 5,459 warheads, the US has 5,177, and China around 600, although each country keeps its nuclear arsenal largely under wraps.","summary":"The AGM-181 LRSO, billed as the Air Force's next-generation stealth nuclear cruise missile, is poised to arm both the B-52 and the newly built B-21 stealth bomber","url":"https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/uk-world-news/donald-trumps-city-destroying-nuclear-36215049","image":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/article36215048.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200b/1_Jaw-dropping-images-may-show-secret-city-destroying-US-nuclear-missile.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-11-08 22:49:46","author":"Eliana Nunes,Julie Dunnett","authors":["Eliana Nunes","Julie Dunnett"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.031},{"id":377142362,"title":"Republicans turn their attention to bashing Obamacare as shutdown enters day 39","text":"Amid a 39-day government shutdown, Republican after Republican took to the Senate floor on Saturday to blast the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare, calling the program a failed approach to addressing the country’s health care needs. Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., went as far as to say the current system might need replacing. \"You were promised when Obamacare passed in 2010, President Obama said, that every family in America who participated in this thing would have a $2,500 savings in premium reductions. It’s been like a 100% increase. This thing is unsustainable,\" Graham said. FLASHBACK: TED CRUZ PREDICTS BALLOONING OBAMACARE SUBSIDIES NOW AT CENTER OF SHUTDOWN FIGHT \"We're going to replace this broken system with something that is actually better for the consumer to meet the goal of lowering health care costs,\" Graham added. Graham wasn't the only Republican voice to speak out against Obamacare. \"I hate to report that folks on the other side refused to acknowledge the very obvious damage being done across the board by Obamacare,\" Sen. Ron Johnson, R-Wis., said. \"The problem we have in healthcare is we've largely driven free-market principles out of healthcare. That's because of the faulty design of Obamacare. It's got to be fixed.\" Sen. Rick Scott, R-Fla., a former health care executive and longtime critic of the program, joined in. \"It's all caused by Obamacare. When the government gets involved in things, they often go up in price,\" Scott said. Notably, Republican criticisms of Obamacare on Saturday went beyond the front-and-center issue holding up consideration of government funding. Where Republicans have advanced a short-term spending package meant to keep the government open through Nov. 21, Democrats have rejected it 14 times, demanding that lawmakers first consider extending COVD-era emergency tax subsidies for Obamacare plan holders. Republicans, who maintain the temporary subsidies and their expiration have nothing to do with government spending, have largely focused their attention on the shutdown itself instead of engaging in a debate over the COVID-era assistance. They’ve said they will negotiate on the subsidies when the government reopens. But President Donald Trump changed the picture on Saturday morning in a post to Truth Social by arguing that lawmakers should re-structure the enhanced subsidies so that they go directly to the policyholders instead of insurance companies who currently receive the tax credit payments. TRUMP URGES SENATE REPUBLICANS TO REDIRECT FUNDS FROM OBAMACARE-BACKED INSURERS, PAY AMERICANS DIRECTLY In the wake of Trump’s suggestion, lawmakers began blasting Obamacare’s structure. \"Obamacare costs the federal government closer to $150 billion a year. That’s right. We’re spending $150 billion of your tax-earned dollars supplementing other people’s health care,\" Sen. Roger Marshall, R-Kan., said. \"When they sold this to the American people, they said it would cost $40 or $50 billion, but we’re triple that. That’s $400 million a day,\" he added. Sen. Joni Ernst, R-Iowa, echoed those comments, arguing that Obamacare had missed the mark on its original design. \"It’s clear that Obamacare has failed to deliver on its promises,\" Ernst said. \"The answer isn’t throwing more money into a broken system. What we need to do is fix what’s broken. We can end that waste.\" HOUSE REPUBLICANS DIVIDED OVER OBAMACARE AS GOP EYES FIX AFTER SHUTDOWN Like Ernst and Marshall, Sen. Jon Husted, R-Ohio., also took to the floor, calling for Congress to evaluate the source of climbing health care costs. \"So, I hope we want to get at the costs and the cause of what’s affecting the unaffordability of health care in this country. Health care has increased since Obamacare started by 6% a year while overall inflation has been 3% or less,\" Husted said. \"I hope we will reopen the government and begin serving the American people while we continue the very important conversation of how we make health care more affordable,\" he added.

The Trump administration later said it will fully fund Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program benefits while its appeal plays out. The administration is seeking a stay from the U.S. Supreme Court, according to media reports.\n\nThat’s how everything unfolded Friday after Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins said her department asked the 1st Circuit Court to pause the Rhode Island-based district court’s ruling that the department use $6 billion of emergency contingency funding to disburse SNAP benefits.\n\nThe debate over SNAP funding was met with criticism by those who say that the USDA’s refusal to pay for full SNAP benefits was wrong. However, some Republican legislators in California pushed back.\n\n“I grew up on EBT (electronic benefits transfer). I grew up on WIC. I grew up on CalFresh,” Assemblymember David Tangipa, R-Fresno, told The Center Square. “It was not like what it is right now when I was on it. There’s a lot of waste that is happening on EBT.”\n\nAccording to Tangipa, California’s version of SNAP, CalFresh, has a 13% fraud and error rate, meaning that one out of 10 applications on SNAP/EBT is fraudulent or inaccurate. Reducing fraud in the program will ensure that government spending is brought down and resources are provided only to those truly in need, he added. \n\n“Under the Big Beautiful Bill, they have to get that under 5%,” Tangipa told The Center Square. “So under 5% to make sure the money is going to the right people who deserve it, the ones who need it, and the ones who have been caught in that social safety net.”\n\nOn Thursday, a ruling made in U.S. District Court in Massachusetts that the Trump administration use emergency contingency funds to pay SNAP benefits was bolstered by a separate decision from a judge in the U.S. District Court of Rhode Island, who said that the U.S. Department of Agriculture had to fund full SNAP benefits by Friday. California officials both celebrated that victory in court and criticized the USDA, according to a Nov. 6 press release issued from California Attorney General Rob Bonta’s office.\n\n“Carrying out USDA’s directive to award reduced benefits has been nothing short of an administrative nightmare in many states,” said Bonta in the press release. “We continue to believe that the Trump administration is legally required to pay full November SNAP benefits, which would also be far easier to get out the door. And it’s great news that they have now been ordered to do precisely that.”\n\nHowever, Bonta added in the press release, “Instead of simply focusing on getting vital food assistance to millions of people, however, the USDA has appealed this latest order. It’s unconscionable. Californians, and people across this country, can’t afford any more delays or excuses.”\n\nAlso on Thursday, the deputy secretary of the U.S. Department of Agriculture, Steven Vaden, said he is attempting to root out fraud in the SNAP program, stating that the system doesn’t require thorough enough income and asset evaluations.\n\nOn Monday, the U.S. Department of Agriculture said it could only pay $4.6 billion toward November’s SNAP disbursements. Department officials announced the same day that it wouldn’t use other contingency funds to pay for those benefits. However, President Donald Trump wrote on social media on Tuesday that no money would go to paying for SNAP benefits until the federal government reopens, stating that congressional Democrats would have to vote to open the federal government before SNAP would continue to receive funding.\n\nCongressional Democrats voted that same day for the 14th time not to pass a continuing resolution that would fund the federal government through the end of 2025 – making the shutdown the longest in U.S. history. Friday was its 38th day.\n\nThe crux of the shutdown is centered on Democrats attempting to include a continuation of pandemic-era federal subsidies to offset the cost of health insurance premiums, which are set to expire at the end of the year. Republicans in Congress would not include that provision in the federal funding measure, insisting that debate over the issue be held after passage of the funding resolution.\n\nJudge Indira Talwani of the U.S. District Court of Massachusetts issued a ruling on Oct. 31 ordering the Trump administration to use those emergency funds to pay for SNAP benefits. Talwani determined $6 billion was legally available to continue funding SNAP disbursements to beneficiaries, despite the argument the Trump Administration adopted that the U.S. Department of Agriculture could not legally use the contingency funding to pay for SNAP benefits.\n\nThe SNAP program costs $8.6 billion a month nationwide, according to Talwani’s Oct. 31 ruling.\n\nBonta, along with the state attorneys general of 22 other states, filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court in Massachusetts on Oct. 28 to force the U.S. Department of Agriculture, which oversees and funds the SNAP program nationwide, to use emergency contingency funding to pay for SNAP beneficiaries’ food benefits. Bonta said in an Oct. 30 press conference, held at the Los Angeles Regional Food Bank, that he was hoping for an order to come from the judge in that case before Nov. 1, when money for SNAP and CalFresh would run out.\n\nMany other states experienced their own difficulties over losing SNAP benefits in recent weeks. Washington State, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Michigan, North Carolina, Louisiana, and Colorado have all dealt with trying to fill the gap to meet the needs of residents in those states who also rely on SNAP, formerly known as food stamps.\n\nThe ongoing federal shutdown has affected those who rely on SNAP benefits across the country. The federally funded program provides food benefits to 42 million Americans every month, and about 5.5 million people in California, according to previous Center Square reporting. Money for the program ran out on Nov. 1.\n\nIn California, SNAP is known as CalFresh.\n\nAccording to a report from the California Department of Social Services, approximately $1.1 billion in federal money is distributed in CalFresh benefits each month to eligible Californians.\n\n“Withholding these benefits will potentially take food off the table for 42 million Americans who use SNAP and require assistance to feed themselves and their families,” wrote Marcia Rabinoff, an account manager for Unbendable Media, in an email to The Center Square. “The administration’s freeze of SNAP funds also disproportionately harms families in rural areas, where access to grocery stores and social services is already limited, further deepening food insecurity and economic hardship.”\n\nA moveon.org petition had garnered 73,865 signatures as of Friday afternoon. The goal of the petition is to get 75,000 signatures in an effort to restore funding to SNAP.\n\nWhat legislators and members of Congress are doing\n\nCalifornia legislators have stepped up efforts to ensure their constituents get access to food. Assembly Speaker Robert Rivas, D-Salinas; Assemblymember Mark Gonzalez, R-Indio; Assemblymember Jesse Gabriel, D-Encino and U.S. Rep. Jimmy Gomez, D-Los Angeles, along with leaders of the YMCA of Metropolitan Los Angeles, visited a food distribution center operated by Weingart East Los Angeles YMCA, according to a Nov. 5 press release from Rivas’ office.\n\n“Trump is ignoring a court order and literally taking food off the table from millions, denying groceries to kids and seniors, and leaving families at the mercy of his Republican shutdown,” Rivas said in that press release. “It’s un-American. We are doing everything possible to fill in this awful gap so that families don’t go hungry during the holidays.”\n\nRivas’ office also said in the press release that the California legislature allocated tens of millions of dollars this year for food banks throughout the state, and that state officials are fast-tracking $80 million in food assistance to families in the Golden State ahead of the holidays.\n\n“Hunger doesn’t care who you voted for,” said Assemblyman Mark Gonzalez, D-Los Angeles, in a Nov. 5 press conference at the Weingart East Los Angeles YMCA food distribution center. “Hunger doesn’t care or wait for a budget deal. Hunger doesn’t take sides, it takes lives.”\n\nWELCOME TO THE JUNGLE: NANCY PELOSI RETIREMENT SETS OFF RACE TO FILL DEMOCRATIC TITAN’S SHOES\n\nBesides Gomez, other members of California’s congressional delegation have also visited organizations in their districts. U.S. Rep. Laura Friedman, D-Burbank, stopped by the nonprofit My Friend’s Place, which provides critical resources and services to young adults.\n\n“Programs like My Friend’s Place are a lifeline,” said Friedman in a Nov. 7 press release. “I’m forever grateful for their work and will continue fighting in Congress to get them the resources they need.

of labour unions led by the United Steelworkers slammed the Trump administration for suspending port fees on Chinese ships that workers argued would bring about a revival in the once-dominant domestic shipbuilding industry.\nThe unions expressed “strong disappointment” with the administration’s decision and said it would have negative consequences in the nation’s attempt to restore the US maritime sector, according to a letter sent to US Trade Representative Jamieson Greer.\nThe letter, also signed by the International Association of Machinists, International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers and International Brotherhood of Boilermakers, said the decision will allow China to continue “predatory behaviour”.\nThe strong comments come a week after US President Donald Trump touted a trade truce between the world’s largest economies, assuring Americans that the Chinese would buy more agricultural goods and roll back export controls on rare-earth minerals that threatened to undermine US national security.\nBut the pushback also shows that the deal came at the expense of some blue-collar workers, which could hurt the president during next year’s midterm elections in key battlegrounds.\n\n“By suspending 301 remedies for one year, the US government is introducing uncertainty at the very moment when confidence and long-term planning are most essential,” the unions wrote in the letter.\n“Suspending implementation of the responsive actions under the Section 301 investigation will continue to give China a free pass.”\nOn Thursday, the office of the US Trade Representative opened an usually short comment period on terms of a deal struck between Trump and his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping.\nThe unions’ letter was submitted on Friday, before the deadline at 5pm.\nTrump’s plan would pause tariffs on imports of ship-to-shore cranes and chassis from China, in addition to a suspension of fees levied on Chinese-built and -operated merchant ships calling at American ports.\nChina agreed to halt retaliatory measures in return for US action, according to a fact sheet released by the White House after Trump and Xi met last week.\n\nThe pause would begin on November 10 and is effectively a year-long pledge not to invoke tariffs or other penalties stemming from a US probe into China’s actions in the maritime, logistics and shipbuilding sectors.\nThe investigation under Section 301 of the Trade Act of 1974 began during the Biden administration, at the request of five trade unions representing US steelworkers and shipbuilders, including those that signed Friday’s letter.\nTrump has looked to counter China’s growing influence on the shipbuilding sector with the probe as well as with deals with Japan and South Korea to bolster alternatives.\nThe push to revive US shipbuilding capacity has received broad support from Republicans and Democrats in Congress, and bipartisan legislation complimentary to the policy aimed at China’s maritime sector was the subject of a Senate hearing just last week.\nThe measure is also supported by much of the domestic maritime industry.","summary":"A group of labour unions led by the United Steelworkers

Trump in an orange jumpsuit. \n\nMason Storm's 'Saint or Sinner' piece has been hanging in a pedestrian walkway in Basel, Switzerland, since Saturday. \n\nStorm depicted Trump fastened to a cross-shaped gurney as if he was being crucified like Jesus.\n\nTrump's hands lay slack and his head is tilted as if he is sleeping. \n\nOwner of Galerie Gleis 4 that organized the exhibit, Konrad

artist posted about the piece on Instagram and wrote: 'Half life-size Donny Trump, probably the most decisive politician of the modern era, or past for that matter. \n\n'Despised by some, beloved by others, so is he a saint on a cross or a sinner on the lethal injection gurney?

His remarks came during an appearance on News Saturday.\n\nDuring the broadcast, host Matt Boyle highlighted the administration’s efforts to mitigate the negative impact on Americans, as the Democrats’ refusal to reopen the government persists, prolonging the shutdown and its consequences.\n\n“The President has been striving to lessen the hardship on ordinary Americans,” Boyle commented. “However, we’re reaching a critical point where flight operations are affected, and there are growing concerns about SNAP benefits and other essential services. The situation is escalating, and hopefully, this will pressure officials to reopen the government soon.”\n\nEmmer praised President Donald Trump for his dedication to easing the shutdown’s effects, emphasizing the administration’s commitment to addressing challenges faced by citizens.\n\n“President Trump remarkably managed to secure pay for our troops last month, despite limited options,” Emmer noted. “Currently, the administration is exploring ways to support the 42 million low-income Americans who depend on SNAP for nutrition.”\n\nEmmer further elaborated, “A lower court mandated that all benefits for the month must be paid, which demands $8 to $9 billion from a $5 billion disaster fund. It’s important to understand that this emergency fund was never intended for such use,” he explained.\n\n“It was created for emergencies, natural disasters like hurricanes.

More than 62% of them are in a family with children. \n\nCannizzaro said beneficiaries “are going to be able to use the same cards that they do currently. We are confident that we will structure this program in a way that is both legal and efficient.”\n\nThe remarks came 38 days into the federal government shutdown, which has been defined by a bitter stalemate between Democratic and Republican U.S. senators, and countless program shutdowns as reserve funds have dried up. \n\nIt also came a day after a federal court ordered the Trump administration to fund the full SNAP budget, after the federal government had said it would only fund half of SNAP with U.S. Department of Agriculture reserve funds previously determined to be used in the event of a shutdown. The Trump administration on Friday appealed the latest court order by the U.S. District Court for Rhode Island. But the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 1st Circuit in Boston denied a request for an administrative stay. \n\nThe Trump administration said it would follow the court order to fully fund SNAP while it appeals the decision. The Department of Justice is asking the U.S. Supreme Court to issue a stay, according to media reports.\n\nMeanwhile, Nevada Senate Democrats’ plan to propose local SNAP funding is expected to face opposition from Republican Gov. Joe Lombardo, who has yet to publicly respond directly to Cannizzaro’s plan. Lombardo previously said he opposed local funding of the SNAP program. \n\n“The governor remains committed to finding a solution to source SNAP beneficiaries, and other Nevadans impacted by the federal shutdown, to the extent allowable under state and federal law,” Josh Meny, press secretary for the Governor’s Office, told The Center Square.\n\nThe Nevada Legislature isn’t scheduled to meet again for a regular session until 2027.

And new polling suggests Democrats may have little incentive to budge anytime soon.\n\nThe findings come from KFF, a nonpartisan health policy research group, and they get at the heart of why negotiations remain stubborn: Americans aren’t particularly opposed to Democrats’ push to extend enhanced Affordable Care Act subsidies, which are set to expire on Dec. 30.\n\nAbout half of Americans (48%) support Democrats continuing to “refuse to approve a budget unless it includes extending these tax credits, even if it means the government remains shut down,” according to KFF’s survey. A similar number (50%) favor ending the shutdown quickly, even if it means allowing health care costs to rise for some people.\n\nThat roughly even split may not seem overwhelming—but it’s notable for a few reasons.\n\nFor one, this is far from normal. When Republicans previously used government shutdowns to advance their priorities—such as defunding the ACA in 2013 or building a border wall in 2019—public support for those goals was weak. A 2013 New York Times/CBS poll found that fewer than 1 in 5 Americans thought defunding the ACA was worth a shutdown. And a CBS poll in 2019 found that just 28% backed shutting down the government to build a border wall.\n\nSecond, public opinion on Democrats’ new ACA push has remained remarkably stable.\n\nOn the first day of the shutdown, Oct. 1, a Washington Post poll found that a plurality of Americans (47%) supported Democrats holding out. A pre-shutdown Strength in Numbers/Verasight survey pegged support at 52% for withholding votes until Republicans agreed to restore funding for certain health programs, such as the ACA and Medicaid, the latter of which is not part of Democrats’ current demands. \n\nEven as the shutdown drags on, Americans’ appetite for Democrats holding firm hasn’t meaningfully waned.\n\nKFF’s polling highlights how sharply the shutdown divides along party lines. Among Democrats, support for holding firm on the ACA tax credits is nearly unanimous—81% say lawmakers should refuse to approve a budget without the extension. Independents are split almost evenly: 51% support continuing the shutdown to protect the subsidies, while 47% want a quick budget deal to reopen the government. Republicans overwhelmingly side against Democrats’ hard line—84% say lawmakers should approve a budget to reopen the government.\n\nBut the GOP has always had the power to end the shutdown. Republicans control the presidency, Congress, and the Supreme Court—and could, if willing, act to break the impasse by eliminating the filibuster. Their choice not to do so—nor negotiate meaningfully with Democrats—keeps the country in gridlock.\n\nNotably, among Americans under age 65 who purchase their own health insurance, 55% support Democrats refusing to approve a budget without ACA subsidies, according to KFF’s data. Past KFF data indicate that nearly half of adults enrolled in marketplace plans identify as Republicans or lean Republican, highlighting the cross-party appeal of the policy goal.\n\nIn practical terms, the polling suggests Democrats have little incentive to back down. KFF’s data finds that 74% of Americans want to extend the ACA subsidies, and of that group, only 23% say they would blame Democrats if the tax credits expire at the end of the year. Meanwhile, 38% would blame Republicans, and another 37% would blame Trump.\n\nIn other words, the Democratic Party could continue driving a hard bargain, even as the GOP blames them for the shutdown—a narrative that has little traction given the public and political realities. \n\nIndeed, Republicans have begun to hint at concessions, including potential votes to extend the ACA subsidies. And the shutdown appears not to have harmed Democrats politically: The recent Election Day results offered no evidence of voter backlash, and President Donald Trump has publicly suggested the standoff hurt Republicans instead.\n\nIn short, Democrats appear to be winning both the messaging battle and, for now, the shutdown war.","summary":"The GOP’s government shutdown became the longest in U.S. history on Wednesday, with no resolution in sight.

That appears to have hit a nerve. Both social and traditional media were ablaze with erroneous assertions about Gates’ supposed reversal of opinion on climate change.\n\nDespite reaffirming support for ambitious decarbonisation, his letter is being celebrated by climate sceptics while angering some climate scientists.

In fact, he specifically writes that “climate change will have serious consequences – particularly for people in the poorest countries.” He emphasises that “every tenth of a degree of heating that we prevent is hugely beneficial because a stable climate makes it easier to improve people’s lives.”\n\nGates goes further, calling for major investments into global health and development (particularly on vaccines), and expresses continued support for pursuing net zero carbon emissions – all of which seems to fly in the face of Trump’s climate and foreign aid agenda.\n\nGiven this, why are so many climate sceptics celebrating Gates’ letter?

They helped make him mayor","text":"When the results beamed onto televisions around a New York party confirming the city's new mayor, the crowd erupted.\n\nCaitlin McNaughton leapt to her feet, her hand covering her mouth as the crowd embraced and roared: \"Mam-da-ni! Mam-da-ni!\"\n\n\"Things have just been so bleak,\" the New Yorker exclaimed.\n\nThis watch party, held in a beer garden in the borough of Queens, is about as close to Zohran Mamdani's heartland as you can get. In fact, this is his neighbourhood.\n\nThe 34-year-old self-described Democratic socialist made headlines around the world this week when he won New York City's mayoral election by a massive margin.\n\nHis far-left policy platform that includes things like taxing the rich and opening city-run grocery stores was mocked by many, including US President Donald Trump, who also grew up in the city.\n\nBut Mr Mamdani had the last laugh on Tuesday night and there is evidence to suggest women like Ms McNaughton — who is also 34 — were the driving force behind the triumph.\n\n\"I'm extremely proud to be a New Yorker but lately I've been embarrassed to be an American,\" she said, referring to the Trump administration's cuts to critical government programs and hard-line immigration policies.\n\n\"This is a glimmer of hope.\"\n\nMr Mamdani, the Democratic Party's candidate, has been credited with energising previously disengaged voters around the city.\n\nThe Democrats were humbled by Mr Trump's Republican Party at last year's presidential election, and have been described as ineffective and directionless in the year since.\n\nSome hope Mr Mamdani's win in one of the nation's most progressive strongholds will help the beleaguered Democrats shake off the political paralysis they have faced since Trump's win.\n\nWhile analysts point out that Mr Mamdani's policies are unlikely to gain traction around the country, some aspects of his victory could.\n\nHis consistent messaging about the sky-high cost of living in New York City is a theme many people around the country will relate to.\n\nThe way Mr Mamdani galvanised young people — particularly women — appears to have been a major factor in his success.\n\nHe won about two-thirds of voters under 45, including 84 per cent of women aged 18 to 29 and 65 per cent of women aged 30 to 45, according to an exit poll of more than 4,000 people, published by CNN.\n\nWomen make up a larger share of the American electorate than men and historically turn out to vote in higher numbers, too.\n\n'This is monumental'\n\nMr Mamdani, who was born in Uganda and migrated to the US as a child, will become New York City's first Muslim mayor.\n\nThe millennial won 50.4 per cent of the vote, far ahead of independent Andrew Cuomo, who finished with just over 41 per cent.\n\nMr Cuomo, a former governor of the state who stepped down after multiple sexual harassment allegations, was well-known in the city. He is a Democrat, but ran as an independent after losing the primaries to Mr Mamdani.\n\nThe other major contender, Curtis Sliwa from the Republican Party, finished a very distant third.\n\nShanaz Chowdhury, a 38-year-old mother and first-generation Bangladeshi immigrant, celebrated with her partner and friends. For her, Mamdani's win as the first Muslim and South Asian mayor is deeply personal.\n\n\"As someone who has experienced Islamophobia since 9/11, this is monumental,\" she said. \"I'm proud my son won't have to go through what I have.\"\n\nShe recalled her parents in Salwar Kameez — a type of traditional dress — having objects hurled at them, her sister facing prejudice at work for wearing her hijab, and her elderly Imam being doused in beer by a stranger on the street.\n\n\"It's this feeling of not belonging. You feel it all the time,\" she said.\n\nWhile the CNN exit poll did not provide specific details of which candidates New York's South Asian community may have skewed towards, it did reveal he was popular among some of the city's other major cultural diasporas.\n\nAmong black women, for instance, 54 per cent backed Mr Mamdani, while for Latina women, it was 51 per cent.\n\n\"The conventional wisdom would tell you that I am far from the perfect candidate,\" Mr Mamdani said during his victory speech on Tuesday night.\n\n\"I am young, despite my best efforts to grow older. I am Muslim. I am a Democratic socialist. And most damning of all, I refuse to apologise for any of this.\"\n\nSupport for Mr Mamdani did not transcend all backgrounds, though.\n\nNew York City is home to the world's largest Jewish community outside Israel, and CNN's poll revealed the vast majority of this group — 64 per cent — had backed Mr Cuomo.\n\nMr Mamdani has a long history of pro-Palestinian activism and has been highly critical of Israel's government and military, even pledging to arrest the country's Prime Minister, Benjamin Netanyahu.\n\nWhite women backed Mr Mamdani, too.\n\nAccording to the exit poll, 47 per cent voted for the Democratic candidate, while 45 per cent backed Mr Cuomo.\n\nIn contrast, white men threw their support behind Mr Cuomo in larger numbers with 49 per cent casting a ballot for him, and 42 per cent voting for Mr Mamdani.\n\nFighting for a city that left her behind\n\nKristina Teschner was among those who believe Mr Mamdani is what the city needs. She even volunteered for his campaign.\n\nShe has spent years on the brink of being priced out of the city she loves.\n\nAt 44, the Brooklyn resident has lived most of her life pay cheque to pay cheque, and relies on government food and health programs to get by.\n\nShe also became homeless for a brief period after her landlord evicted her.\n\nThen came her biggest test: a breast cancer diagnosis that required treatment and a double mastectomy, leaving her unable to work.\n\n\"I couldn't look at my bank account today, but I think maybe there's a hundred dollars in there.\"\n\nDespite her situation, Ms Teschner devoted months to volunteering for Mamdani's campaign, canvassing, petitioning and organising neighbours frustrated with a city that seemed to have forgotten them. \n\nWhen Mr Mamdani was declared the winner, she screamed and hugged her friends.\n\n\"Just knowing this campaign existed makes me feel more taken care of,\" she said.\n\n\"It takes a tipping point for people to feel confident enough to stand up to these big money-burning machines and win.\n\n\"The heartbeat of New York isn't in corporate boardrooms. It's the taxi drivers, the bodega owners, the nurses, the teachers — people like me.\"\n\nMr Mamdani will be sworn in as mayor on January 1.","summary":"Zohran Mamdani's victory in Tuesday's New York City mayoral election looked unlikely at one point.

The ACA is also referred to as Obamacare.\n\nRepublicans want a clean funding bill with health insurance to be considered later, while Democrats want the government's subsidies to be extended into next year as part of a funding bill.\n\nA record 24.3 million have purchased insurance through one of the exchanges, with nine out of 10 receiving some sort of financial assistance.\n\nOpen enrollment began on Nov. 1 for most policyholders, one month after the shutdown began.\n\nRates will rise 26% on average next year, according to a KFF analysis -- not including the end of the subsidies. In all, costs will more than double, according to a separate KFF analysis of data from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services.\n\nThune, of South Dakota, said both sides negotiated overnight on a possible short-term spending bill, while bipartisan negotiations also have been ongoing but not fruitful.\n\n\"I'm frustrated like everybody is,\" GOP Sen. Roger Marshall of Kansas told reporters on Saturday. \"Every American is frustrated. Nobody wins in a shutdown, especially one that is this long.\n\nAsked whether there could be a deal, he responded, \"None. None at all. I'm almost speechless. What has not been said?\"\n\nThune said a 15th vote on advancing the House-passed continuing resolution is not currently scheduled, but could come up later in the day.\n\nIn past votes, a few Democrats have approved the bill but 60 votes are needed. The Republicans have a 53-47 edge in the chamber.\n\n\"There's still only one path out -- it's a clean funding extension,\" Thune said on the Senate floor Saturday.\n\nSenators have been told they will be given 24 hours to read the text of an agreement, a GOP aide told CNN.\n\nSen. Markwayne Mullin of Oklahoma told reporters that consensus has emerged in the Republican conference around a Jan. 30 funding end date.\n\nGOP senators have pushed for the funding with the goal of including longer-term appropriations bills and extending the deadline for funding, in exchange for a future vote on healthcare.\n\n\"The question is whether we can have everything ready to go,\" Thune told reporters. \"We're getting close to having it ready. Ideally, it'd be great to set it up so we could vote today, but we have to ... have the votes to actually pass it.\"\n\nOn Friday, Republicans shot down a Democratic push toward a deal featuring a one-year tax credit extension on health insurance. Thune said the tax extension would be considered after the shutdown ends.\n\n\"That's what we're going to negotiate once the government opens up,\" Thune said Friday.\n\nMinor Leader Chuck Schumer of New York criticized Republicans for rejecting the idea.\n\n\"Yesterday, we offered Republicans a perfectly reasonable compromise to get out of this horrible shutdown that they installed on the American people,\" Schumer said on the House floor. \"We offered three things: we all vote to reopen the government, we all approve a one-time temporary extension of current ACA premium tax credits, and then after we reopen we negotiate.\"\n\n\"I know many Republicans stormed out the gate to dismiss this offer, but that's a terrible mistake,\" he added.\n\nSchumer said it doesn't need to be negotiated because the idea \"is not a new policy, this is not negotiating a shutdown.\"\n\nThune has been adamant that he can't guarantee Democrats a tax extension process.\n\nPresident Donald Trump, who is at his estate in South Florida, has been pressing to end the filibuster rule and instead have bills pass by a majority of the 100 senators. Most Republicans are opposed to this \"nuclear\" option, fearing Democrats will do that when they are in power.\n\n\"Democrats are cracking like dogs on the Shutdown because they are deathly afraid that I am making progress with the Republicans on TERMINATING THE FILIBUSTER!,\" Trump posted on Truth Social on Saturday afternoon. \"Whether we make a Deal or not, THE REPUBLICANS MUST 'BLOW UP' THE FILIBUSTER, AND APPROVE HUNDREDS OF LONG SOUGHT, BUT NEVER GOTTEN, POLICY WINS LIKE, AS JUST A SMALL EXAMPLE, VOTER ID (IDENTIFICATION). Only a LOSER would not agree to doing this!\"\n\nEnd Obamacare?\n\nTrump also told Republicans to end Obamacare, something he has attempted to do since he first became president in 2017.\n\nHe called it the \"worst Healthcare anywhere in the World.\"\n\nOn Saturday morning in a post on Truth Social, he said money used for the program should be sent directly to the public instead of \"money sucking Insurance Companies in order to save the bad Healthcare provided by ObamaCare.\n\n\"In other words, take it from the BIG, BAD Insurance Companies, give it to the people.\"\n\nMedicare, mainly for seniors, has Part A and B that don't go through insurance companies and are run by the U.S. government's Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services.\n\nSen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, an ally of Trump, touted the proposal.\n\n\"We're not going to extend this program for a year because that would be unfair to the taxpayer,\" Graham said on the Senate floor. \"That would continue a healthcare system that's out of control. It would enrich health insurance companies even more. We're not going to do that. We're going to replace this broken system with something that is actually better for the consumer to meet the goal of lowering health care costs.\"\n\nGraham said he spoke with Trump on Saturday morning and that the president told him he would \"like to sit down and see if we can come up with a better solution. I know we can, but we're not going to do it while the government's shut down.\"\n\nGraham also urged Democrats to \"end this madness.\"\n\n\"To my Democratic colleagues, let's open up the government and act like adults and see if we can get this problem in a better spot. We'll never do it with the government shut down,\" he said.","summary":"The U.S. Senate will remain in session until a deal is reached to end the government shutdown, which has reached a record 39 days, Majority Leader John Thune said Saturday.","url":"https://www.upi.com/Top_News/US/2025/11/08/Thune-says-Senate-in-session-until-shutdown-ends/4021762631089/","image":"https://cdnph.upi.com/sv/ph/og/upi/4021762631089/2025/1/f41c4132fa431b65205490da1e9814ad/v1.5/Thune-to-keep-Senate-in-session-until-deal-reached-to-end-shutdown.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-11-08 21:37:57","author":"Allen Cone","authors":["Allen Cone"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.627},{"id":377130676,"title":"Jimmy Kimmel's wife is 'angry all the time' after losing relationships with Trump-voting family members","text":"Late-night host Jimmy Kimmel's wife, television writer Molly McNearney, revealed that she has lost relationships with some of her Trump-voting family members on the \"We Can Do Hard Things\" podcast on Thursday. Following her husband's spat with President Donald Trump over his show being temporarily suspended in September, McNearney told the podcast hosts that she felt betrayed after some of her family members voted for the current president. Disney briefly suspended ABC’s \"Jimmy Kimmel Live!\" after the host’s remarks about the alleged assassin of Charlie Kirk sparked widespread backlash. After an about-face from Disney, the liberal comedian returned the following week. JIMMY KIMMEL SAYS CHRISTIANITY HAS BEEN 'CO-OPTED AND PERVERTED' WHILE CRITICIZING TRUMP IMMIGRATION POLICY \"It hurts me so much because of the personal relationship I now have, where my husband is out there fighting this man, and to me, them voting for Trump is them not voting for my husband and me and our family. And I unfortunately have kind of lost relationships with people in my family because of it,\" McNearney said. She continued, saying that for her, politics is no longer about \"Republican versus Democrat,\" but about \"family values.\" \"And it's really hard for me because I grew up believing in these Christian ideals of taking care of the sick and taking care of the poor, and I don't see that happening with this Republican Party. And so it's — I feel like I'm kind of in constant conflict, and I'm angry all the time, which isn't healthy at all,\" McNearney explained. \"But I like personalize everything now. When I see these terrible stories every day, I'm immediately mad at certain aunts, uncles, cousins who put [Trump] in power.\" TRUMP CALLS ABC'S JIMMY KIMMEL SUPPORT 'MAJOR ILLEGAL CAMPAIGN CONTRIBUTION' TO DEMOCRATS The television writer added that these feelings have been \"really hard\" for her to deal with and that she wishes that she could \"deprogram\" herself to make it easier. She also revealed that before the 2024 election, she reached out to some of her conservative family members in a last-ditch effort to convince them not to vote for Trump. \"I've sent many emails to family, like right before the election, saying, 'I'm begging you. Here's the 10 reasons not to vote for this guy. Please don't,\" she recalled. \"And I either got ignored by 90% of them or got truly insane responses from a few. It's definitely caused a strain.\" While McNearney said she’s lost touch with some Trump-supporting relatives, she told the podcast hosts that she’s grown closer to family members who share her political views. JIMMY KIMMEL'S LATE-NIGHT EVOLUTION FROM APOLITICAL FUNNYMAN TO DEM ACTIVIST \"I've definitely pulled in closer with the family that I feel more aligned with. And I hate that this has happened… it feels silly,\" she said. \"You know, part of me goes, 'Don't let politics get in the way,' but to me, this isn't politics. It's truly values. And we just were not aligned anymore.\" Earlier in the podcast, McNearney recalled that when she was growing up in St. Louis, Missouri, she typically voted Republican down ballot until she moved away and \"met people from different backgrounds.\" She went on to explain how her former views provided her with the insight to feel \"a little bit of sympathy\" for her conservative family members. \"There's like a little bit of sympathy I have for people in my family that I feel are kind of being deliberately misinformed every day, and they've kind of… they are deliberately being misinformed every day, and they believe it,\" she said.

Jeanne Shaheen, D-N.H., who is leading the talks among moderates, said Friday evening that Democrats “need another path forward” after Republicans rejected an offer from Democratic leader Chuck Schumer of New York to reopen the government and extend the subsidies for a year. “We’re working on it,” she said.\n\nModerates continue to negotiate\n\nShaheen and others, negotiating among themselves and with some rank-and-file Republicans, have been discussing bills that would pay for parts of government — food aid, veterans programs and the legislative branch, among other things — and extend funding for everything else until December or January. The agreement would only come with the promise of a future health care vote, rather than a guarantee of extended subsidies.\n\nIt was unclear whether enough Democrats would support such a plan. Even with a deal, Trump appears unlikely to support an extension of the health benefits. House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., also said this week that he would not commit to a health vote.\n\nRepublican leaders only need five additional votes to fund the government, and the group involved in the talks has ranged from 10 to 12 Democratic senators.\n\nSome Republicans have said they are open to extending the COVID-19-era tax credits as premiums could skyrocket for millions of people, but they want new limits on who can receive the subsidies. They lined up Saturday to take to the Senate floor and argue that subsidies for the plans should be routed through individuals.\n\n“We’re going to replace this broken system with something that is actually better for the consumer,” said Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C.\n\nRepublicans eye new package of bills\n\nTrump wants Republicans to end the shutdown quickly and scrap the filibuster, which requires 60 Senate votes for most legislation, so they can bypass Democrats altogether. Vice President JD Vance, a former Ohio senator, endorsed the idea in an online post Saturday, saying Republicans who want to keep the filibuster are “wrong.”\n\nRepublicans have rejected Trump’s call, and Thune is eyeing a bipartisan package that mirrors the proposal the moderate Democrats have been sketching out. What Thune, who has refused to negotiate, might promise on health care is unknown.\n\nThe package would replace the House-passed legislation that the Democrats have rejected 14 times since the shutdown began Oct. 1. The current bill would only extend government funding until Nov. 21, though senators indicated their version would likely go through January.\n\nA choice for Democrats\n\nA test vote on new legislation could come in the next few days if Thune decides to move forward.\n\nThen Democrats would have a crucial choice: Keep fighting for a meaningful deal on extending the subsidies that expire in January, while prolonging the pain of the shutdown? Or vote to reopen the government and hope for the best as Republicans promise an eventual health care vote, but not a guaranteed outcome.\n\nSchumer on Saturday persisted in arguing that Republicans should accept a one-year extension of the subsidies before negotiating the future of the tax credits.\n\n“Doing nothing is derelict because people will go bankrupt, people will lose insurance, people will get sicker,” Schumer said in a floor speech. “That’s what will happen if this Congress fails to act.”\n\nEarlier, Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, an independent who caucuses with the Democrats, said they need to stand strong after overwhelming Democratic victories on Election Day.","summary":"Trump suggested Congress send money directly to people to buy health insurance.","url":"https://fortune.com/2025/11/08/trump-government-shutdown-compromise-affordable-care-act-tax-credits-premium-subsidies-health-insurance/","image":"https://fortune.com/img-assets/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/AP25310656691923-e1762636761450.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-11-08 21:29:17","author":"Kevin Freking,Mary Clare Jalonick,Stephen Groves,The Associated Press","authors":["Kevin Freking","Mary Clare Jalonick","Stephen Groves","The Associated Press"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.436}]}
