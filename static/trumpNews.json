It projected the U.S. gross domestic product to grow 1.7 percent from a year earlier, down from the previous forecast of 2.1 percent.\n\nPowell has been cautious about cutting the interest rate, especially since Trump unveiled his array of tariffs, which include a 10 percent duty on all imported goods as well as additional, country-specific levies.\n\nDespite saying recently that he does not plan to fire Powell, Trump has repeatedly criticized him, sparking concern that the Fed's independence is under threat.\n\nWhen asked Wednesday whether Trump's repeated calls on the Fed to make rate cuts have affected its monetary policy, Powell said, \"We're always going to do the same thing, which is we're going to use our tools to foster maximum employment and price stability for the benefit of the American people.\"\n\n\"We're always going to consider only the economic data, the outlook, the balance of risks and that's it,\" he said. \"That's all we're going to consider.

Or, excuse me, he's got a degree in English. Bachelor's degree,' Rogan said.\n\n'He's not an expert either. Unless we're talking about Shakespeare. Shut the f**k up. Because you're not an expert either. You know what I mean?' \n\nHanes agreed, telling Rogan he thought Murray came across as 'pompous' and that damaged his credibility. \n\n'This appeal to experts, just because you have a degree, you're not always right. You're wrong all the time,' Rogan said \n\n'He used tactics rather than facts. So the tactic was an appeal to experts like that. Like that's not what we're here for what we're here for is to get down to business so what he's doing is like putting you on the defensive right away out of the gate.'\n\nThe columnist and author told Rogan to his face that he thinks he's responsible for a misinformation problem in society.\n\n'I feel you've opened the door to quite a lot of people who now got a big platform, who have been throwing out counter-historical stuff of a very dangerous kind,' Murray said to Rogan.\n\nMurray offered podcaster Darryl Cooper and Holocaust denier Ian Carroll as examples of the kind of Rogan guests who have shared questionable information.\n\nDaryl Cooper has said that not only did the Nazis not intend to murder millions but that Winston Churchill is the main villain of World War Two.\n\n'These guys are not historians, they're not knowledgeable about anything,' Murray said.\n\n'No one is calling Ian Carroll a historian,' Rogan shot back.\n\n'But then why listen to their views on Churchill?' Murray insisted. \n\n'If you only get the contrary view, which is - \"isn't it fun if we all pretend that Churchill was the bad guy of the 20th century?\" - at some point you're going to lead people to think that's the view. And that's horses**t of the most profound kind.'\n\n'I don't think about it that way,' Rogan doubled down. 'I just think, I'd like to talk to that person.'\n\nBut Murray wasn't having it and concluded: 'There's a point at which \"I'm just raising questions\" isn't valid anymore... You're not asking questions — you're telling people something.","summary":"British author Douglas Murray challenged Joe Rogan over the guests he brings on his show last month.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-14689633/joe-rogan-responds-douglas-murray-challenged-misinformation.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/05/08/01/98154469-0-image-m-24_1746662787724.jpg","video":"https://videos.dailymail.co.uk/video/mol/2025/04/11/7291401322591597485/1024x576_MP4_7291401322591597485.mp4","publish_date":"2025-05-08 00:57:47","author":"Editor,Rachel Bowman","authors":["Editor","Rachel Bowman"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.134},{"id":318959172,"title":"Letters to the Editor, May 8, 2025","text":"Liberals have made Canada a joke internationally for years.

The District of Columbia joined 16 states — including California, Colorado and Washington — in a suit over the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA)'s efforts to halt Congress’ $5 billion National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure (NEVI) Formula Program to expand electric vehicle (EV) charging infrastructure. President Donald Trump on Jan. 20 mandated that federal agencies pause disbursement of all funds appropriated under the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act and the Inflation Reduction Act, including NEVI program funding. The Federal Highway Administration notified states in February that it was revoking previous state plan approvals and withholding or withdrawing NEVI program funds. KAROLINE LEAVITT CONDEMNS ‘DANGEROUS ATTACKS ON TESLA: ‘DOMESTIC TERRORISM’ The lawsuit claims the FHWA is acting unlawfully, devastating the ability of states to build the charging infrastructure needed to make EVs accessible to more consumers, combat climate change and pollution and support the states’ green economies. It asks the court to declare Trump’s directives unlawful, vacate the actions and permanently stop the administration from withholding the funds. TESLA VEHICLES, CHARGING STATIONS TARGETED AS PROTESTERS DENOUNCE DOGE, ELON MUSK In addition to the $300 million and $71 million in funding California and Washington stand to lose, respectively, the blue states previously adopted zero-emission vehicle standards that require a percentage of vehicles sold in the states to release zero emissions. Washington's laws further require all new passenger cars, light-duty trucks and medium-duty vehicles sold in the state to be zero emissions by 2035. California’s State Electric Vehicle Infrastructure Deployment Plan anticipated that California would need hundreds of thousands of additional EV charging ports to support passenger cars and trucks and \"incrementally more\" charging ports for medium- and heavy-duty trucks and buses to meet climate goals, according to a news release from the state. SUSPECTED TESLA ARSONISTS HIT WITH FEDERAL CHARGES IN ACTS OF 'DOMESTIC TERRORISM': AG \"When America retreats, China wins,\" California Gov. Gavin Newsom said in the release. \"President Trump’s illegal action withholding funds for electric vehicle infrastructure is yet another Trump gift to China — ceding American innovation and killing thousands of jobs. Instead of hawking Teslas on the White House lawn, President Trump could actually help Elon — and the nation — by following the law and releasing this bipartisan funding.\" The lawsuit comes as Democratic politicians, late-night hosts and political commentators have been touting Tesla's plummeting stock and acts of vandalism against its vehicles, dealerships and charging stations. The criminal acts have been linked by the FBI to nationwide protests against Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE).

Anyone “impacted by anticompetitive practices in the live concert and entertainment industry” will have 60 days to submit comments to Regulations.gov, with the comment period concluding on July 7.\n\n After the comment period closes, the agencies state they will “use the information in their preparation of the report and recommendations directed by President Trump” in his Executive Order 14254, also known as Combating Unfair Practices in the Live Entertainment Market. Signed by the president during a March 31 meeting in the Oval Office with musician Kid Rock in attendance, the order directed the Attorney General, along with the Secretary of the Treasury and the chairman of the FTC, to submit a report identifying “recommendations for regulations or legislation necessary to protect consumers” in the industry, including by enforcing the Better Online Tickets Sales (BOTS) Act.\n\n Passed in 2016, the BOTS Act gives both the DOJ and the FTC broad power to crack down on scalpers who illegally use automated technology to skirt the restrictions placed on high-demand ticket sales and prevents scalpers from buying up the best seats to flip for profit. Yet since its passage in 2016, the BOTS Act has only been used once to prosecute scalpers who knowingly break the rules put in place to make ticket buying fairer and more equitable.\n\n “Competitive live entertainment markets should deliver value to artists and fans alike,” said Assistant Attorney General Abigail Slater of the DOJ’s Antitrust Division in a statement. “We will continue to closely examine this market and look for opportunities where vigorous enforcement of the antitrust laws can lead to increased competition that makes tickets more affordable for fans while offering fairer compensation for artists.”\n\n Added FTC Chairman Andrew N. Ferguson, “Many Americans feel like they are being priced out of live entertainment by scalpers, bots, and other unfair and deceptive practices. Now their voices are being heard. President Trump has sent a clear message that bad actors who exploit fans and distort the marketplace will not be tolerated. The FTC is proud to help deliver on that promise and restore fair and competitive markets that benefit ordinary Americans.”\n\n The inquiry comes as several ticketing bills work their way through Congress, most notably the TICKET ACT, which passed the House of Representatives on April 29 and also includes language calling for the enforcement of BOTS Act. \n\n “Illegal bot use runs rampant in the ticketing industry because the FTC has only brought one enforcement action since the use of bots was banned in 2016,” read a statement from Stephen Parker, executive director of National Independent Venue Association (NIVA), shortly after the April 29 passage of the TICKET ACT in the House. He added, “We hope Congress does not miss the opportunity to ensure these laws are actually enforced in the future.”","summary":"Members of the public are invited to submit comments \"on harmful practices and on potential regulation or legislation to protect consumers in the industry\" through July 7.","url":"https://www.billboard.com/pro/department-of-justice-ftc-inquiry-live-ticketing-business/","image":"https://www.billboard.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Donald-Trump-Kid-Rock-Oval-Office-2025-billboard-1548.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-05-08 00:54:13","author":"Chris Eggertsen,Dave Brooks","authors":["Chris Eggertsen","Dave Brooks"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.094},{"id":318960800,"title":"Inside the MAGA takeover reception with Scott Bessent at the elite California Milken conference","text":"Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent appeared at the Milken Institute Global Conference in Los Angeles, California with a message: Donald Trump is serious about tariffs and it’s time to invest in the United States.\n\nBessent appeared at a small private reception organized by Presidential envoy for Special Missions Richard Grenell on Sunday at the Peninsula Hotel in Beverly Hills, prior to his speech at the conference. \n\nThe treasury secretary spoke to the exclusive gathering, previewing his speech with about 150 attendees that included political and economic heavyweights.\n\nFCC Chair Brendan Carr, Former Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, and Exchange Commissioner Mark Uyeda were present for the reception as well as financial titans Citigroup CEO Jane Fraser, Pershing Square Capital Founder Bill Ackman, Starwood Capital Group Chair Barry Sternlicht, and Bank of New York Mellon CEO Robin Vince. \n\nPresident of Paraguay Santiago Pena was also present as well as Congressmen Darrell Issa and Abe Hamadeh.\n\n‘It was incredible.’ Grenell told the Daily Mail in an interview about the event. ‘I realized that there was really an opportunity to showcase what is happening in America by showcasing people getting comfortable with the idea of America first.’\n\nHe said that some Silicon Valley tech investors were already widely supportive of Trump's efforts and Wall Street bankers were getting on board. \n\nThe event took place at the same time as a reception hosted by Citadel hedge fund manager Ken Griffin that was across the street.\n\nSources familiar with Griffin’s relationship with the White House told Daily Mail he is growing frustrated that no one is answering his calls and has become a bit of a punchline in the West Wing.\n\n‘It’s no surprise that Ken Griffin isn’t getting his phone calls returned,’ Caroline Wren, a longtime fundraiser for Trump told the Daily Mail. ’Ken Griffin has repeatedly and publicly criticized the America First policies that President Trump is enacting, and then privately complains about a lack of access to Trump. You can’t have it both ways.'\n\nIt's not a surprise, as Griffin remains a vocal critic of Trump.\n\nAt a World Economy Summit in Washington, DC, last month, Griffin complained that Trump was moving too fast and risking the American ‘brand.’\n\n‘It can be a lifetime to repair the damage that has been done,’ he said.\n\nFor weeks, Bessent has been quietly trying to reassure investors after the president announced a 90 day pause on global tariffs for every country except China. But at the same time, he is warning financial elites that Trump is serious about bringing manufacturing, production, and high-paying jobs back to the United States.\n\nDespite the handwringing and stress from global investors in the conference audience, Bessent warned critics they were underestimating the president.\n\n‘He proved them wrong in his first term and he’s proving them wrong today,’ Bessent said.\n\nHe explained calmly that the administration was ‘preparing the soil’ for an economic boom in the United States and ‘planting the seeds,’ urging companies to invest more in America.\n\n‘Next we harvest and we want you to harvest with us,’ he said. ‘Hire your workers here, build your factories here, make your products here, you’ll be glad you did.’\n\nThe appearance of Trump officials at the swanky conferences and receptions for elites can be problematic politically, if they give any sign of downplaying the president’s agenda to make wealthy investors happy.\n\nBut former White House chief strategist Steve Bannon praised Bessent’s appearance as ‘epic.’\n\n‘Bessent delivered the message. Trump is not backing off,’ he said. ‘He is requiring global commercial relationships to favor America and American workers and they jumped onboard.’\n\nThe message was well received, Grenell said, praising Bessent’s impact in the room.\n\n‘I think Scott is very calm, smart, judicious,’ Grenell said.\n\nThe Wall Street investors who support the existing political system, Grenell said, are very used to getting what they want for short term gain, but Bessent and is urging them to think bigger and more longterm.\n\n‘We have to be making things again and that requires a change in the current paradigm,’ Grenell said.","summary":"Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent appeared at the Milken Institute Global Conference in Los Angeles, California with a message.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-14689823/MAGA-milken-conference-california-scott-bessent.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/05/08/01/98155823-0-image-a-29_1746665380517.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-05-08 00:53:40","author":"Charlie Spiering,Editor","authors":["Charlie Spiering","Editor"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":0.103},{"id":318957130,"title":"Donald Trump taps wellness influencer close to Robert F. Kennedy Jr. for surgeon general","text":"President Donald Trump is tapping Dr. Casey Means, a physician-turned-wellness influencer with close ties to Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., as his nominee for surgeon general after withdrawing his initial pick for the influential health post.\n\nTrump said in a social media post Wednesday that Means has “impeccable ‘MAHA’ credentials” – referring to the “ Make America Healthy Again ” slogan – and that she will work to eradicate chronic disease and improve the health and well-being of Americans.\n\n“Her academic achievements, together with her life’s work, are absolutely outstanding,” Trump said. “Dr. Casey Means has the potential to be one of the finest Surgeon Generals in United States History.”\n\nIn doing so, Trump withdrew former Fox News medical contributor Janette Nesheiwat from consideration for the job, marking at least the second health-related pick from Trump to be pulled from Senate consideration. Nesheiwat had been scheduled to appear before the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee Thursday for her confirmation hearing. \n\nMeans and her brother, former lobbyist Calley Means, served as key advisers to Kennedy’s longshot 2024 presidential bid and helped broker his endorsement of Trump last summer. The pair made appearances with some of Trump’s biggest supporters, winning praise from conservative pundit Tucker Carlson and podcaster Joe Rogan. Calley Means is currently a White House adviser who appears frequently on television to promote restrictions on SNAP benefits, removing fluoride from drinking water and other MAHA agenda items.\n\nCasey Means has no government experience and dropped out of her surgical residency program, saying she became disillusioned with traditional medicine. She founded a health tech company, Levels, that helps users track blood sugar and other metrics. She also makes money from dietary supplements, creams, teas and other products sponsored on her social media accounts.\n\nIn interviews and articles, Means and her brother describe a dizzying web of influences to blame for the nation’s health problems, including corrupt food conglomerates that have hooked Americans on unhealthy diets, leaving them reliant on daily medications from the pharmaceutical industry to manage obesity, diabetes and other chronic conditions.\n\nFew health experts would dispute that the American diet — full of processed foods — is a contributor to obesity and related problems. But Means goes further, linking changes in diet and lifestyle to a raft of conditions including infertility, Alzheimer’s, depression and erectile dysfunction.\n\n“Almost every chronic health symptom that Western medicine addresses is the result of our cells being beleaguered by how we’ve come to live,” Means said in a 2024 book co-written with her brother.\n\nFood experts say it’s overly simplistic to declare that all processed foods are harmful, since the designation covers an estimated 60% of U.S. foods, including products as diverse as granola, peanut butter and potato chips.\n\n“They are not all created equal,” said Gabby Headrick, a nutrition researcher at George Washington University’s school of public health. “It is much more complicated than just pointing the finger at ultra-processed foods as the driver of chronic disease in the United States.”\n\nMeans has mostly steered clear of Kennedy’s controversial and debunked views on vaccines. But on her website, she has called for more investigation into their safety and recommends making it easier for patients to sue drugmakers in the event of vaccine injuries. Since the late 1980s, federal law has shielded those companies from legal liability to encourage development of vaccines without the threat of costly personal injury lawsuits.\n\nShe trained as a surgeon at Stanford University but has built an online following by criticizing the medical establishment and promoting natural foods and lifestyle changes to reverse obesity, diabetes and other chronic diseases.\n\nIf confirmed as surgeon general, Means would be tasked with helping promote Kennedy’s sprawling MAHA agenda, which calls for removing thousands of additives and chemicals from U.S. foods, rooting out conflicts of interest at federal agencies and incentivizing healthier foods in school lunches and other nutrition programs.\n\nNesheiwat, Trump's first pick, is a medical director for an urgent care company in New York and has appeared regularly on Fox News to offer medical expertise and insights. She is a vocal supporter of Trump and shares photos of them together on social media. Nesheiwat is also the sister-in-law of former national security adviser Mike Waltz, who has been nominated to be Trump's ambassador to the United Nations.\n\nBut she had recently come under criticism from Laura Loomer, a far-right ally of Trump who was instrumental in ousting several members of the president’s National Security Council. Loomer posted on X earlier this week that “we can’t have a pro-COVID vaccine nepo appointee who is currently embroiled in a medical malpractice case and who didn’t go to medical school in the US” as the surgeon general. \n\nIndependent freelance journalist Anthony Clark reported last month that Nesheiwat earned her medical degree from the American University of the Caribbean School of Medicine in St. Maarten, despite saying that she has a degree from the University of Arkansas School of Medicine. The White House pulled Nesheiwat’s nomination because of doubts about her confirmation prospects, according to a person familiar with the matter who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss the administration's reasoning.\n\n“I am looking forward to continuing to support President Trump and working closely with Secretary Kennedy in a senior policy role to Make America Healthy Again! My focus continues to be on improving the health and well-being of all Americans, and that mission hasn’t changed,” Nesheiwat wrote on social media Wednesday.\n\nThe surgeon general, considered the nation’s doctor, oversees 6,000 U.S. Public Health Service Corps members and can issue advisories that warn of public health threats.\n\nIn March, the White House pulled from consideration the nomination of former Florida GOP Rep. Dave Weldon to lead the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. His skepticism on vaccines had raised concerns from key Republican senators, and he withdrew after being told by the White House that he did not have enough support to be confirmed.\n\nThe withdrawal was first reported by Bloomberg News.\n\n© Copyright 2025 The Associated Press.

Like baking a delicious cake for the village fete’s tea stall, only for no one to cut a single slice.\n\nKemi Badenoch asked, instead, about winter fuel payments. Sir Keir started gabbling peevishly. Mrs Badenoch was calm and unusually focused.\n\nLabour MPs did not enjoy the exchanges.\n\nSome massaged their necks. Ian Byrne (Lab, Liverpool West Derby) even nodded agreement as the Tory leader made her attacks.\n\nSir Ed Davey rose, to groans. He, too, asked about winter fuel payments and about Donald Trump. He also raised the film industry and essayed a lame wisecrack about James Bond and Paddington Bear.\n\nThe House laughed with pain. But not Sir Keir. He was too caught up with indignation to see any joke.\n\nHis reply to the Lib Dem leader – with whom he may one day have to coalesce – was unusually snippy. Labour MPs sat in still silence, not sure how to react.\n\nSir Keir did not even smile when Tessa Munt (Lib Dem, Wells & Mendip Hills) asked one of her multi-paragraph epics. Ms Munt has no idea what a dribbler she is. The chamber groaned again, and laughed, and cheered ironically when she finally came to a halt.\n\nA guide dog on the floor in front of her rolled over and stuck its four legs in the air, stiff as a corpse. Sir Keir could have taken the mickey out of Munt. It might have cheered his demoralised troops.\n\nBut he was too caught up in his own, noble tribulations to see the fun in that.","summary":"Sir Keir Starmer has reached the 'exasperated' stage.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-14688987/QUENTIN-LETTS-MP-guide-dog-stiff-corpse-sketch.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/05/07/20/98146971-0-image-m-47_1746645983865.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-05-08 00:43:15","author":"Editor,Quentin Letts","authors":["Editor","Quentin Letts"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.02},{"id":318955306,"title":"Queensland Man Accused of Secretly Recording 40 Individuals in Their Homes","text":"Crime \n\n Background: Donald Trimble Mortuary in Decatur, Ga.

In the classic movie, the gang of cockneys led by Charlie Croker (played by Michael Caine) hijacks a truck full of stolen gold after disabling Turin’s traffic lights.\n\nThe lights are manipulated by a bungling boffin played by Benny Hill, who somehow manages to hack a clunky central computer and cause city-wide traffic jams, allowing Croker’s crew to intercept the consignment of bullion.\n\nThe movie was made in 1969 but this aspect of its plot resonates now more than ever. Only today, it’s not the traffic-management tech that fascinates but the cars themselves, which have become computers on wheels.\n\nBrimming with sensors and cameras, with wireless connections to networks controlled by their manufacturers, they have become the latest pawns in the global battle for supremacy being waged by the world’s superpowers.\n\nAnd as China’s share of the UK car market is now more than 10 per cent – and set to grow rapidly in the months and years to come as Beijing is increasingly priced out of the US market by President Trump’s tariffs – that presents us with a serious problem.\n\n‘China could cripple the traffic in London by cutting the controls of, let’s say, 400 electric cars in one go, so they couldn’t be moved,’ Richard Dearlove, the former head of MI6, warned recently, saying there is a strong security case for banning the sale of all Chinese-made electric vehicles (EVs).\n\nHe added: ‘This is not a scare story, it’s an actual possibility.’\n\nSince all new vehicles are connected to the internet, they can be rendered inactive from afar with relative ease, a concept that was graphically illustrated in Ukraine after Russian troops occupied the city of Melitopol and stole advanced farm vehicles from a John Deere dealership in 2022.\n\nThe Russians had shipped the machines 700 miles to Chechnya but were unable to use any of them since they were tracked and their systems shut down remotely by John Deere.\n\nSo while we are right to worry about spyware on our mobile phones, we ought also to bear in mind that EVs are giant pieces of spyware. And the threat of an Italian Job on British cites, shutting them down by disabling EVs at the command of the Chinese Communist Party, is only one chilling scenario haunting our security agencies.\n\nEVs are the perfect tools for sabotage, surveillance, espionage – and even targeted assassinations. Chilling demonstrations of how to take control of electric cars have become a staple of cybersecurity conferences.\n\nOne group of Chinese hackers has published a report on how they tricked the self-driving software on a Tesla into swerving into oncoming traffic. Others have shown how a vehicle’s boot controls, windscreen wipers and even brakes can be activated remotely.\n\nIt was reported last week that firms working on British defence contracts have warned staff not to connect their mobile phones to Chinese-made EVs out of fear that sensitive data could be extracted and transmitted to Beijing.\n\n‘It is safe to assume that every defence supplier is concerned about the tech in Chinese-built cars,’ one defence firm source was quoted as saying. ‘Not only could your car download your journeys, it could also scrape your text messages, voicemails and even sensitive work documents from your mobile.’\n\nThe firms reportedly include the defence giants BAE Systems, Rolls-Royce, Raytheon, Lockheed Martin and Thales.\n\nThe move follows tighter restrictions imposed by the Ministry of Defence on EVs entering sensitive military sites and training bases, with chiefs insisting that staff driving not only Chinese EVs but also cars with Chinese components park at least two miles from sensitive buildings.\n\nDespite these concerns, the Government is throwing open the door to Chinese EVs in its fanatical desire to reach its Net Zero targets. Even before Donald Trump’s ‘Liberation Day’ tariffs last month, these vehicles were coming under close scrutiny in America and the EU, both of which have imposed levies on imports.\n\nAs a result, China is scouring the globe for new markets in which to dump its growing mountain of cars. That makes the UK – which has so far shied away from introducing new tariffs on foreign cars – an even more attractive market for the likes of BYD, Ora, Geely and XPeng, as well as MG and Volvo, which are owned by China.\n\nAll MGs are now made in China, with the company employing just 46 workers at its old Longbridge plant, whose job these days is restricted to inspecting imports.\n\nChinese EVs are cheap, in part as a consequence of generous state subsidies and massive over-production. Chinese manufacturers have helped raise the number of sub-£30,000 EV brands for sale in the UK from nine to 29 over the last year, according to online marketplace AutoTrader.\n\nThese include the Leapmotor T03 (£15,164) and GWM ORA 03 (£24,995). AutoTrader estimates that Chinese firms could grab a quarter of the market – 400,000 cars per year – by 2030, which is when the Government has decreed that the sale of new petrol and diesel cars will end.\n\nThe dangers of Beijing’s growing dominance of our car sector have been clear for some time, but largely ignored by government.\n\nIt was two years ago that Professor Jim Saker, President Of The Institute Of The Motor Industry, warned: ‘The threat of connected electric vehicles flooding the country could be the most effective Trojan horse that the Chinese establishment has to potentially paralyse or hold the UK to ransom.’ Similarly, the ability to track, eavesdrop or even remotely take control of a vehicle has not been lost on the Chinese Communist Party, which banned Tesla cars from what it regarded as sensitive sites, including military compounds, housing complexes and other government affiliated venues, such as meeting and exhibition halls.\n\nDuring the World University Games in Chengdu in July 2023, Teslas were barred from parts of the city to be visited by President Xi Jinping.\n\nAnd it is not just the cars themselves that offer opportunities to data-hungry secret services. Two Chinese companies, CATL and BYD, which between them control half the global supply of EV batteries, have set their sights on dominating EV ancillary industries, including charging networks and energy storage systems.\n\nBoth companies have close links with the Chinese Communist Party and have benefited from substantial subsidies. This opens up another set of security risks, since storage and charging systems need to be linked to a nation’s electrical grid.\n\nChinese car exporters will no doubt give guarantees of good behaviour – as TikTok, Hikvision, Huawei (and of course Jingye, the owner of British Steel) have all done in the past – but such assurances are simply not credible when these companies, like all Chinese firms, are ultimately beholden to the Communist Party.\n\nA swathe of Chinese laws compel all companies, whether fully state-owned or nominally private, to cooperate on intelligence gathering and national security – the latter a very sweeping term in China. They simply cannot say no.\n\nIt has been argued that Chinese car companies would not engage in underhand activities because it would kill their businesses. But you would have to be very naive to buy that view.\n\nWhile evidence of Beijing exploiting its control over Chinese cars on British roads may be thin on the ground at the moment, if our relations with China were to deteriorate sharply – perhaps as a result of an invasion of Taiwan – the weaponisation of technology by China would become a chilling reality. Beijing already routinely uses trade, investment and market access as tools of coercion.\n\nThe seriousness of the threat was starkly illustrated by the discovery in 2023 of a Chinese-made tracking device in then-Prime Minister Rishi Sunak’s car during a ‘disturbing’ security sweep.\n\nThe device came sealed inside a part imported from China and had been installed by the manufacturer. Though the model was not disclosed, the official prime ministerial cars are not Chinese made.\n\nThe Government neither confirmed nor denied the report, but former Tory leader Sir Iain Duncan Smith said he had been ‘reliably told’ that it was true. ‘Those devices that they’ve been putting into Downing Street cars, although they won’t admit it, [led to them] tracking where the Prime Minister was going, knowing who he is seeing. This is exactly what they can do.’\n\nThe Government is pushing ahead with plans to ditch its own fleet of petrol and diesel cars by 2027, and there appears to be no prohibition on buying Chinese replacements.\n\nIn a report published last month, the Department for Transport said all central government cars and vans will have zero emissions by the end of that year. This totals around 30,000 vehicles, since the Government has one of the largest vehicle fleets in the UK.\n\nIntriguingly, one of the few exceptions will be the Prime Minister’s gas-guzzling Range Rover.\n\nComputers control nearly every aspect of the operation of a modern motor vehicle – and an EV in particular. The average electric car has around 2,000 chips and is festooned with sensors and cameras. Their functions range from assisting with parking and monitoring the car’s health and maintenance, to providing alerts, adjusting operations and warning the driver about issues.\n\nThey are also connected, meaning they send and receive information in real time. This facility enables the manufacturer or insurer to remotely monitor vehicle and driver performance or to update software. As cars move towards more autonomous driving and artificial intelligence (or machine learning) plays an ever greater role, so the flow of data will multiply.\n\nImported EVs and related equipment can, of course, be swept for spyware, but that is to miss the point – that EVs are, in and of themselves, giant pieces of spyware. Gathering and transmitting information is intrinsic to their operation, and their software is regularly updated. As Jim Sakar, who is also head of the Centre For Automotive Management at Loughborough University, has warned: ‘Even with regulation and strict homologation [the vehicle approval process] there is no way of stopping a car manufacturer having control of the vehicle and its data if the technology is already designed to allow it.’\n\nSmall internet-connected cellular modules, the type of device that was implicated in tracking the Prime Minister’s car, act as a kind of gatekeeper and manager.\n\nThey are a vital component in the system that controls elements such as sensors, cameras, audio, geolocation capability and the engine, as well as managing the flow of vast amounts of data in and out of the vehicle. Cellular modules are not covertly placed, they are an essential part of a modern control system, yet – in the wrong hands – they are potentially a far more dangerous weapon than the most potent piece of spyware, since they determine the operation of the vehicle itself.\n\nCharles Parton, a senior fellow at the Royal United Services Institute, has written that British security services are ‘petrified’ by the nightmare of such powers in the hands of a hostile state.\n\nParton, a former British diplomat who spent more than two decades specialising in China, has done more than anybody else to raise awareness of the dangers posed by cellular modules, the production of which is dominated by China. Its companies control almost two-thirds of the global market and seem on track to establish a near monopoly through the familiar tactics of heavy subsidies, cheap finance and other handouts. ‘Ultimately, you’ve got to ban any Chinese module in any vehicle and you’d have to do it quite quickly,’ says Parton.\n\nIf this were not challenge enough, the use of Chinese-made cellular modules goes far beyond EVs. They have a vast array of applications and can be found in power grids, manufacturing plants and payments systems, as well as items with online connectivity such as vacuum cleaners, refrigerators, smart meters and fitness trackers that are part of what is known as the Internet Of Things. ‘To ensure that such systems run efficiently, they collect huge amounts of data and metadata for analysis, processing and response management. They also deliver software updates to improve functionality,’ Parton wrote in a report for the Council On Geostrategy.\n\nIn other words, they are an indispensable – and extremely powerful – part of our lives and increasingly central to the smooth functioning of a modern economy.\n\nAnd it should not be forgotten that, for China, creating critical dependencies is not an accident, but a tool – indeed a goal – of Chinese Communist Party policy.\n\nThis was set out in stark terms by Xi Jinping himself in a 2020 speech to China’s Central Financial And Economic Affairs Commission. ‘We must tighten international production chains’ dependence on China, forming powerful countermeasures and deterrent capabilities based on artificially cutting off supply to foreigners,’ he said.\n\nTwo more versions of The Italian Job have been made over the years, one by Hollywood in 2003 and another by Bollywood in 2012, with the later versions reflecting developments in computers and the internet.\n\nYet the first Italian Job still reflects modern reality in two key respects: Just as Mr Bridger (Noel Coward) masterminds the heist from his distant prison cell, so modern-day cyber spies can create mayhem remotely via the internet and tools such as EVs.\n\nAnd as for the slapstick of the bumbling egghead Benny Hill, can there be any better metaphor for the Government’s confusion and dithering in the face of the growing threat from Chinese EVs?\n\nIan Williams is author of Vampire State: The Rise And Fall Of The Chinese Economy (Birlinn), which is out now.","summary":"The Italian Job is giving Britain's intelligence agencies sleepless nights.

Administration officials say she is at the White House more often than the public knows, but when exactly, and for how long, these officials will not (or perhaps cannot) say for certain.\n\nIt’s like having Greta Garbo as first lady.\n\nMrs. Trump is expected to reappear in the capital on Thursday to unveil a postage stamp honoring Barbara Bush, the former first lady, and to attend a ceremony for military mothers. But two people with knowledge of Mrs. Trump’s schedule said she had spent fewer than 14 days at the White House since her husband was inaugurated 108 days ago. Others say even that is a generous estimate. Officials in the East Wing and West Wing declined multiple requests for comment for this article.\n\nThat the first lady’s whereabouts is among the most sensitive of subjects in this White House only adds to the intrigue. \n\n“We haven’t seen such a low-profile first lady since Bess Truman, and that’s going way back in living human memory, nearly 80 years ago,” said Katherine Jellison, a historian at Ohio University whose research has focused on first ladies. She said that, like Mrs. Trump, Mrs. Truman spent much of her time running back to “her home base whenever she had the chance.” (In Mrs. Truman’s case, that was Independence, Mo.) \n\n“She just kind of liked her own private world,” Ms. Jellison said.\n\nThe same is true of this first lady. She has hired staff to work for her in the East Wing, but she rarely goes into the office. Even regulars at Mar-a-Lago say they don’t often see Mrs. Trump around the premises. \n\nEvery marriage has its highs and lows, but as with so many other things, the Trumps are in a league of their own. In the span of just a few months last year, the couple endured a public trial about his philandering, two assassination attempts and a presidential campaign. \n\nThe trial, which concerned hush money Donald J. Trump paid to a porn star, made for an especially challenging moment for the couple, two people with knowledge of their dynamic said. Mrs. Trump kept well away from the courthouse in Lower Manhattan and from the campaign that kicked into high gear in the weeks that followed.\n\nThe attempted assassination of her husband over the summer — and a subsequent incident in which a gunman got close to Mr. Trump on one of his golf courses — deeply spooked a woman who was already worried about her family’s safety and had been for years, according to two people familiar with her thinking. The first time President Trump was inaugurated, in 2017, she was concerned about even getting out of the car to walk in the parade.\n\nAt the White House this time around, Mr. Trump has taken to performing some duties that typically would fall to a first lady. She’s not the one carefully selecting light fixtures for the White House residence, redesigning the Rose Garden, greeting tour groups in the East Wing or hosting receptions for Women’s History Month. He is. \n\nIt has been a decade since husband and wife rode that golden escalator down into national political life together. Now, he has come to a moment in which he finds himself flush with power and self-confidence like never before. And yet, as he expands, she shrinks.\n\nMr. and Mrs. Trump do share one common approach to public office, though. They both know how to make money from the exposure. In January, Mrs. Trump launched her own cryptocurrency token. “You can buy $MELANIA now,” she wrote on social media the day before her husband’s second inauguration. \n\nAnd then there is the deal she struck with Amazon, reported to have been about $40 million, for a documentary offering a “behind the scenes” look at her life as first lady. \n\nWhat might that show? It’s hard to say, exactly. \n\n‘You serve the country’ \n\nMrs. Trump waited for months to move into the White House last time. But that was because her son was just 10, and his mother took the time she needed to arrange his schooling and the transition to a new city. Back then, Mrs. Trump’s parents were omnipresent at the White House as she learned to navigate the role. Mrs. Trump’s mother, Amalija Knavs, died in January 2024. These days, Mrs. Trump spends a lot of time with her father, Viktor.\n\nBarron Trump is 19 now. He is finishing his freshman year at New York University and is increasingly independent. Still, there is a part of Mrs. Trump that remains attached to the protective maternal role she has in his life, people around her say. \n\n“You know, I feel that as children, we have them until they are like 18, 19 years old,” Mrs. Trump told Fox News in a rare interview she gave in January before the inauguration. “We teach them. We guide them. And then we give them the wings to fly.”\n\nShe was asked where she planned to spend most of her time this term.\n\n“I will be in the White House,” she answered. “And, you know, when I need to be in New York, I will be in New York. When I need to be in Palm Beach, I will be in Palm Beach. But my first priority is, you know, to be a mom, to be a first lady, to be a wife. And once we are in on Jan. 20, you serve the country.”\n\nBecause Mrs. Trump is seldom seen or heard from, the times when she does appear provide a glimpse of how she sees her role. Some of her choices have been in line with traditional first lady duties — up to a point. \n\nShe stood alongside her husband to preside over the White House Easter Egg Roll last month, but even that raised ethical and legal concerns after it was revealed that corporate sponsors were allowed to contribute. (All money raised was to go to the White House Historical Association, a private nonprofit educational organization founded by Jacqueline Kennedy in 1961.) \n\nOn April 1, she spoke at the State Department for the International Women of Courage awards, the first time she had been seen in public in Washington in weeks. \n\nAt the White House, the first lady has hired her own staff in the East Wing. But what to do when the boss doesn’t come into the office? “We were honored to welcome these curious, young gardeners to the White House this past week!” reads the caption of one recent video posted to the “FLOTUS” Instagram page. \n\nBut FLOTUS herself does not appear in the video. It’s not clear if she was even there. \n\nFilm crews have been spotted around Mrs. Trump lately. But for the most part, the Amazon documentary about her life is, like its subject, shrouded in mystery. Documentary filmmakers and Hollywood executives say that the $40 million that Amazon is reported to have paid for the documentary, which Mrs. Trump is executive producing, is tens of millions of dollars more than what such projects would ordinarily fetch. Amazon declined multiple requests for comment for this article, as did the film’s director, Brett Ratner. \n\nJust as Mrs. Trump’s presence can make for an interesting sight, so too can her absence. \n\nWhen the first tour group was led through the East Wing, it was Mr. Trump who popped up to surprise them. “The first lady worked very hard in making it perfect,” he told the group. But she was not there. \n\nDuring the first Trump term, Mrs. Trump replanted and restored the Rose Garden. This term, the president plans to pave over it to turn it into a patio so he can entertain al fresco. Mrs. Trump was initially bothered by her husband’s plan, according to two people briefed on the matter. She has since been assured the rose bushes themselves will be left alone. \n\nShe also came around to the idea of the ballroom that he is adamant about building at the White House — once she was told the construction wouldn’t take place too close to the residence. \n\nOne person who has known Mrs. Trump for a long time is Paolo Zampolli, a former modeling agent from Italy who first spotted her in Milan in the 1990s. The Trumps say it was Mr. Zampolli who introduced them for the first time, in 1998, at the Kit Kat Club in Manhattan. He refers to Mrs. Trump reverently as “the lady.” Any persnickety questions about the lady’s absence in Washington, he said, were unfounded. “She loves the White House,” he insisted, “and she loves the role of serving as our first lady.”\n\nWhen the president makes his big swing through the Middle East next week, to Saudi Arabia, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates, the first lady is not expected to go with him. \n\nBut she did accompany him to Vatican City for Pope Francis’ funeral. \n\nWhen they landed back in Newark on a Saturday afternoon, it was Mrs. Trump’s 55th birthday. The president gave her a kiss on the cheek. She got into a car, he climbed into Marine One, and they went their separate ways.","summary":"","url":"https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/05/07/us/trump-news/voice-of-america-will-receive-feeds-from-a-pro-trump-network-administration-says","image":"https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/01/15/business/07trump-news-voa1/15oan1-facebookJumbo.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-05-08 00:30:26","author":"Alan Rappeport,Ana Swanson,Catie Edmondson,Chris Cameron,Javier C.

Being nimble paid off, until President Donald Trump launched his barrage of tariffs on US trading partners as part of his “America first” economic plan. In the second of a three-part series, the Post focuses on a global headwear manufacturer that moved strategically early, only to navigate new disarray in world trade today. Read part one here.\nHong Kong businesswoman Pauline Ngan Po-ling was in Beijing for China’s annual parliamentary meeting in early March when mayhem struck the global trading system.\nUnited States President Donald Trump had begun slapping hefty tariffs on US trading partners, hitting China hardest, in a bid to reduce the US trade deficit, assert American interests and correct what he believes are imbalances unfair to the world’s largest economy.\nNgan recalled the chaos on March 5, the day after Trump levied a 25 per cent tariff on imports from neighbouring Mexico, where her company produced caps, hats and other headgear mainly for the American market.\nThat day, she said, US customs officers did not know how to impose the new tariffs on Mainland Headwear Holdings’ goods moving across the border.\nThe very next day, however, Trump suspended the Mexico tariffs, and subsequent negotiations led to zero duties for garment imports from the country.\nWhile that was a relief, Bangladesh, where Ngan’s company had its main production base, was affected by a series of moves by the US leader.\nTrump first imposed a 37 per cent tariff on US imports from Bangladesh, then lowered it to a 10 per cent upon negotiation, before putting it on hold for 90 days from April 9.\n“It was so painful because things changed every day,” said Ngan, the company’s deputy chairman and managing director, and a Hong Kong representative to China’s top political advisory body, the Chinese People’s Political Consultative Conference.\n\nShe co-founded Mainland Headwear in 1986 with her husband, Ngan Hei-keung, now the company’s chairman. The couple grew it from modest beginnings in Hong Kong to a mainboard listed company with a presence in mainland China and in Bangladesh, Mexico, the US and Europe.\nIt is one of the world’s largest manufacturers of sports caps, hats and a wide range of other casual headgear, as well as accessories such as belts, headbands and visors.\nIt blamed global geopolitical uncertainty for sales sliding 4.4 per cent to HK$1.47 billion (US$189.7 million) last year, with net profit down 51.6 per cent to HK$57.07 million from 2023.\nThe company was among Hong Kong manufacturers that diversified operations overseas over a decade ago in response to growing geopolitical tensions between China and the West and rising costs.\n“What we have done on diversifying geographical locations is primarily because of geopolitics,” Ngan told the Post. “Every step we took more than 10 years ago was not easy at all, and came with lots of risks, and has proved right so far.”\nThe dust has yet to settle in Trump’s tariff wars, but for Mainland Headwear, the upheaval of recent weeks has forced it to re-examine its operations, shift production between its overseas factories and reconsider plans to set up in new locations.\nWith Mexico spared the US tariffs, the company moved swiftly to double production capacity there to a million pieces a month as quickly as possible.\nFor now, the 10 per cent so-called reciprocal tariff applied on its products made in Bangladesh was being shared between the company, its customers and suppliers.\nThe group sold 95 per cent of its Bangladesh output to the US, with the rest going to Europe.\nNgan has already taken steps to shift some production from Bangladesh to Mexico to avoid the US levy.\n\nDiversify to beat tariffs? ‘It’s not easy’\nTrump’s harshest tariff moves have been directed at China, and in a tit-for-tat series of actions, each side has raised levies on the other.\nThe US slapped tariffs of up to 245 per cent on some Chinese exports, while Beijing has reciprocated with levies of 125 per cent on all US goods, on top of earlier duties.\nTo avoid the tariffs, some analysts expected more mainland Chinese and Hong Kong manufacturers to start moving production lines to developing countries.\nSome said the Trump administration had set out to plug the loophole of Chinese manufacturers re-routing exports to the US via a third jurisdiction.\nThat explained the heavy tariffs on shipments from places such as Bangladesh, Thailand, Cambodia, Vietnam and Indonesia.\nIn a move expected to hit Chinese e-commerce firms, small parcels worth under US$800 from Hong Kong and China that were previously allowed to enter the US duty-free have been subject to a 120 per cent tariff or a hefty flat fee since May 2.\n“Whether and to what extent Chinese exporters can still use re-routing via other economies to bypass those additional tariffs remains uncertain,” said Lu Ting, Nomura Hong Kong’s chief China economist.\nBut he expected innovative manufacturers to “continue to explore methods to avoid these mammoth tariffs”.\nHis team estimated that US$31 billion worth of Chinese exports to the US went via Mexico last year, and exports totalling US$163 billion went via Asean, the 10-member group of Southeast Asian countries.\nSome Asean countries were top choices for Hong Kong and mainland manufacturers using the “China plus one” strategy to diversify their production bases.\nThe total US$194 billion of Chinese exports diverted to the US through Mexico and Asean accounted for 5.4 per cent of China’s US$3.58 trillion overall exports last year.\nA Goldman Sachs research report anticipated that Chinese exporters would try to export goods through other countries to avoid punitive US tariffs.\n“Re-routing, together with strong price competitiveness, is likely to maintain Chinese exports to other countries at solid levels,” it said.\nMainland Headwear’s Ngan said she had recently received many phone calls from Chinese exporters eager to know about moving to Mexico.\n“Many asked if I could lease some land to them to set up a factory,” she said. “Whether it is 145 per cent of 245 per cent tariffs, it is impossible to do business in China with the US.”\nShe is willing to share what she has learned from diversifying her production lines beyond the mainland. The main lesson: it is not easy.\n\nCulture shock in Bangladesh\nNgan spent a decade establishing her Bangladesh factory, now the group’s largest production base outside the mainland.\nIts 7,400 workers produce 6.5 million items of headwear and 300,000 pieces of accessories such as belts, wallets and backpacks a month, and she is satisfied that the quality of their work is top notch.\nWhen the company first set up there in 2013, it chose to be in quiet Bagbari, on the outskirts of the capital, Dhaka, to take advantage of the ready supply of cheap labour.\nA business contact had recommended the location. Visiting the place, Ngan found herself in a village surrounded by forest, without proper roads, water supply or telecommunication infrastructure.\nWhile there was a pool of available workers, most were illiterate and so poor that they lacked food or spare clothes, and many had head lice.\nThe company had to build roads, set up its Wi-fi network, dig wells for drinking water and raise the factory from nothing.\nShe brought in managers and trainers from her mainland factory to train the workers, provided them clothes and helped them get rid of the head lice, too.\nNgan also had to negotiate with gangs.\n“At the beginning, some gangsters would come to extort money from us every day,” she said.\nShe decided to meet the ringleader.\n“I offered him a three-year interest-free loan to spend on clearing up a bamboo forest, building dormitories and renting them to our workers,” she recalled. “I said, you don’t have to be gangsters, you can earn a decent income from rent.”\nHe accepted the offer and did as she had suggested.\n“He paid me back on time and no longer engaged in illegal business,” she said.\nIt took longer to build her workforce because the people she hired did not know how to sew.\nFor the first time, Ngan learned about Islam.\nBeing Muslims who prayed five times a day, her Bangladeshi workers would stop work at prayer times. She also became aware that Muslims had a holy month every year, Ramadan, when they fasted from dawn to dusk.\nShe built a mosque on the premises last year, then learned that only the men would pray there. The women workers still went home at prayer times.\nNgan’s Bangladesh experience taught her that moving production lines overseas made business sense, but also demanded understanding the local culture and practices, and that remains a work in progress.\n\nLessons from a Christmas party\nThat was something she had to learn all over again when Mainland Headwear set up in Mexico about a year ago to be closer to its US clients, including New Era Cap, America’s largest distributor of sports caps and fashion hats.\nIts factory and godown at the border town of Sonora occupies a sprawling 150 hectare (370 acre) site. The town is less than 2km (1.24 miles) from the border, allowing products to move fast at lower logistics costs.\nThe tariff chaos spurred Ngan to expand her output in Mexico by increasing the workforce from about 430 to 1,000 to push out a million headgear products a month.\nThe 12-hour time difference between Mexico and Bangladesh made for round-the-clock production, allowing the company to meet urgent orders and improve profitability.\nBut labour costs more in Mexico, where workers get a minimum monthly pay of US$650 compared with US$104 in Bangladesh.\nMainland Headwear was the first overseas company to set up a factory in Sonora in 30 years, and had to bring in everything it needed, from thread, sewing machines, packaging boxes and even chairs, from mainland China.\nThe company’s interim report last year revealed an operating loss because “production had yet to run smoothly”.\nFor Ngan, her team and local employees, there was some culture shock and time needed for adjustment before the factory could get on track.\nShe said it was “a painful experience” working through significant cultural differences and the language barrier.\n“Mexicans speak Spanish and many are well-educated, but their mindset and values are very different from workers in other developing countries,” she said.\nShe recalled the time that she wanted to know how many caps a female worker completed in an hour, and was taken aback to learn it was well below expectations.\nWhen she ticked off the worker for being too slow, the upset woman responded by slowing down even more.\nNgan realised she had to figure out how to handle her workers better.\n\nIt was a celebration last Christmas that made a difference.\n“It was a great party, everyone dressed up and enjoyed the entertainment, with singing, dancing and eating,” she said.\n“The dancers were so good I couldn’t help but ask how much it had cost to hire them. My staffer said, ‘Mrs Ngan, the dancers and the jazz drummer are all our workers.’ I was astonished.”\nIt moved her to try a softer approach. She gave a bonus to a worker who had danced well at the party, and the woman’s productivity jumped three times the next day.\n“The workers need to be encouraged and motivated,” she said. “Scolding doesn’t work.”\nShe found that Mexican workers also valued their quality of life, and some preferred not to work overtime even for more pay.\nIt took nearly a year to iron out such teething issues before production was finally on the right track.\n“The worst is over,” Ngan said.\nLate last year, Mainland Headwear identified Cambodia as a third production base outside China, adding on to its factories in Bangladesh and Mexico.\nThat plan stalled last month, when Trump imposed a 49 per cent tariff on exports from Cambodia.\n“The original calculation was that Cambodia and the US had stable and relatively friendly ties, but it has ended up facing even higher tariffs,” Ngan said.\nThe group has temporarily suspended its plan for a factory in Cambodia.\nStefanie Pan Xueyun, a Mexico-based manager with industrial estate firm American Industries Group, did not expect China and the US to work out their differences over tariffs any time soon.\nInstead, she expected more mainland and Hong Kong companies to set up factories in Mexico to benefit from the zero tariff under the US-Mexico-Canada trade agreement and tax incentives.\n“Mexico has always been a very attractive place for investors,” she said. “But I only recommend Mexico if their clients are from North America. If they’re selling to Europe, maybe Mexico is not a good option.”\nThe firm has developed 17 industrial estates and served more than 300 companies in Mexico.\nExpecting the US-Mexico-Canada trade agreement to be renewed in the review next year, Pan said the United States needed Mexico’s labour and space for production.\n“Mexico has always been very much respected by the US,” she added.\nAdditional reporting by Lam Ka-sing","summary":"First came shock and pain.

the prime minister eyes his new cabinet, the Labor leader faces early headwinds including U.S. tariffs and a potentially troublesome Greens senate crossbench.\n\nAnthony Albanese and his senior ministers have already sent a shot across the minor party’s bow, warning them to be cooperative after a first term marred by blocked legislation and drawn-out negotiations.\n\nThe Greens have retained their balance of power status in the upper house, but lost leader Adam Bandt and three of four lower house seats, amid a Labor resurgence in the federal election on May 3.\n\nOutgoing Greens MP Max Chandler-Mather hit back at the prime minister for challenging him on live television, after he described parliament as a toxic place.\n\nThe firebrand MP who shot to prominence as the party’s housing spokesman and went head-to-head with Albanese, lost his seat of Griffith in Brisbane to Labor after one term.\n\nAlbanese said Chandler-Mather needed to reflect on why he wasn’t in parliament and how he conducted himself when he was, and called out the Greens MP’s attacks on his character.\n\nChandler-Mather responded by saying it was “how the political class treats people who fight for renters and real change”.\n\n“Compare this to his kind words for Dutton,” he wrote on social media platform X.\n\nTrade Minister Don Farrell pointed to what he said was a tendency to abrasive politics as the reason for the Greens’ poor showing in the lower house.\n\n“The reason that they’ve done so badly in this election is because their supporters wanted them to support the government’s progressive policies, and they were doing exactly the opposite,” he told Nine’s Today Show on May 8.\n\nHowever, Greens senator Mehreen Faruqi defended the party, saying Labor’s vote spiked because “a lot of progressive Australians were deeply anxious about a Dutton government.”\n\n“But also, those same voters clearly wanted us to hold a potential Labor government to account, which is why we also achieved record high Senate votes,” she told ABC Radio.\n\nThe Greens’ balance of power position in the Senate means the government will need them to pass legislation opposed by the coalition.\n\nThe Greens are sweating on the Brisbane-based seat of Ryan, which is amongst 11 seats overall that remain too close to call after the election.\n\nLabor has won at least 89 seats while the coalition sits on a diminished 40 seats in the 150-seat house, after the landslide re-election victory under Albanese.\n\nThe Labor caucus will meet in Canberra on May 9 ahead of the likely unveiling of a new-look cabinet on Monday.\n\nSenator Farrell, a right faction powerbroker, said he would leave Albanese to determine his cabinet as the Labor factions tussle for ministry representations.\n\nSpots are decided on a proportional basis.\n\nThe Victorian right faction is calling for an extra post at the expense of their NSW counterparts, who are overrepresented after a swathe of new MPs changed the left and right faction balance.\n\nThe ministry is likely to be sworn in on May 6 with Albanese planning to travel to Indonesia the following day to meet President Prabowo Subianto.\n\nAlso on Albanese’s early-term agenda are the tariffs imposed by U.S. President Donald Trump on imported goods, steel, and aluminum from Australia.\n\nTrump has also flagged a 100 percent tariff on films made outside the U.S., which has alarmed the Australian arts community.\n\nSpeaking in Los Angeles, Australia’s ambassador to the U.S. Kevin Rudd said “I don’t think we want to see a tax on Bluey,” the popular children’s show on the ABC.","summary":"Storm clouds are already gathering on key

This included deaths from the strikes and border shelling.\n\nThe Indian strikes included Punjab, Pakistan's most populous province, for the first time since the last full-scale war between the old enemies more than half a century ago.\n\n\"The targets we had set were destroyed with exactness according to a well-planned strategy,\" India's Defence Minister Rajnath Singh said. \"We have shown sensitivity by ensuring that no civilian population was affected in the slightest.\"\n\nIslamabad said none of the six locations targeted in Pakistan were militant camps.\n\nFifty-seven commercial aircraft were in the air over Pakistan when India attacked, endangering thousands of lives, the spokesperson said, adding they included airlines of Saudi Arabia, Qatar, UAE, Thailand, South Korea and China.\n\nIn Muzaffarabad, the capital of Pakistani Kashmir, the Indian strike badly damaged a mosque-seminary in the heart of the city. Five missiles killed three people in the two-storey structure, which also had residential quarters, locals said.\n\nReuters journalists saw the roof and walls of the concrete building crumble under the impact of the strikes and household items scattered on the first floor.\n\nAn Indian source said the mosque was actually a \"terrorist camp\", which Pakistan denies. Pakistan has said all targets were civilians.\n\nHindu-majority India and Islamic Pakistan have fought two of their three wars since independence in 1947 over Muslim-majority Kashmir, which both sides claim in full and control in part.\n\n'Operation Sindoor'\n\nThe Pakistan prime minister's office said five Indian fighter jets and drones had been shot down, although this was not confirmed by India. The Indian embassy in Beijing called reports of fighter jets downed by Pakistan \"disinformation\".\n\nLocal government sources in Indian Kashmir told Reuters three fighter jets had crashed in separate areas of the Himalayan region overnight and their pilots had been hospitalised. Indian defence ministry officials did not respond to Reuters requests for comment.\n\nImages circulating on local media showed a large, damaged cylindrical chunk of silver-coloured metal lying in a field at one of the crash sites but the authenticity of the image could not be immediately verified.\n\nIndian forces attacked facilities linked to Islamist militant groups Jaish-e-Mohammed and Lashkar-e-Taiba, two Indian military spokespeople told a briefing in New Delhi, in what New Delhi called \"Operation Sindoor\".\n\nJaish said 10 relatives of its leader, Masood Azhar — who was released from an Indian jail in 1999 in exchange for 155 hostages from a hijacked Indian Airlines plane — were killed.\n\nIndia had earlier said two of three suspects in the tourist attack were Pakistani nationals, without detailing any evidence. Pakistan has denied any links to the attack.\n\nWednesday's strikes used precision weapons to target \"terrorist camps\" that served as recruitment centres, launch pads and indoctrination centres and housed weapons and training facilities, Indian military spokespeople said.\n\nIndian Foreign Secretary Vikram Misri, the top official in its external affairs ministry, said the strikes were to pre-empt further attacks on India.\n\nMr Misri briefed 13 foreign envoys in New Delhi on the strikes, an Indian source familiar with the developments said.\n\n\"India made it clear that if Pakistan responds, India will respond,\" the source said.\n\nThe neighbours also exchanged intense shelling and heavy gunfire across their de facto border in Kashmir, with 13 civilians killed and 43 wounded on the Indian side and at least six killed on the Pakistani side, officials there said.\n\nABC/Reuters","summary":"As the world waits with bated breath to see what will happen next between India and Pakistan, there are signs the conflict between the two nuclear-armed states may have reached a plateau.","url":"https://www.abc.net.au/news/2025-05-08/pakistan-revenge-india-airstrikes-willing-deescalate/105266868","image":"https://live-production.wcms.abc-cdn.net.au/acef2357fc776431882f3fc234f7651c?impolicy=wcms_crop_resize&cropH=2813&cropW=5000&xPos=0&yPos=260&width=862&height=485","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-05-08 00:09:48","author":"Will Jackson","authors":["Will Jackson"],"language":"en","source_country":"AU","sentiment":-0.399},{"id":318958504,"title":"Trump replaces surgeon general pick with wellness influencer","text":"President Donald Trump said Wednesday he is picking a wellness influencer to be US surgeon general, replacing his previous nominee one day before her Senate confirmation hearing was scheduled.Casey Means, who describes herself online as a \"former surgeon turned metabolic health evangelist,\" was praised by Trump for her \"MAHA\" credentials — a reference to the \"Make America Healthy Again\" slogan.Her role would see her working under Health Secretary Robert F.

It was one of Labour’s great failures not to have dealt with it in Government. The unions lodged a new claim and, with no progress made, last year applied to the courts. The law passed last night cancels that claim and, under a 10-year rule, it cannot lodge a new one until 2027. Most of the other 32 claims in the pipeline can be restarted, but under tougher criteria.\n\nThe threshold for starting talks is higher, comparisons with male workers are stricter, review clauses will be banned and the incentive for a negotiated settlement will be reduced because the courts will be banned from ordering backpay.\n\nThe Opposition has been on fire in the past two days, demanding answers about what warranted the coalition’s ambush to cut future pay equity settlements while giving tax breaks to landlords – or, as one put it, “robbing Paula to pay Paul”. The answers have been less than robust.\n\nBut Finance Minister Nicola Willis yesterday confirmed what Act leader David Seymour had already said – that the new law will cut billions from projected costs of settlements and will improve the Budget, or, as he put it, “save the Budget”. \n\nFollow the money\n\nThe Government sets out in the Budget how much has been booked over four years for unallocated operating contingencies to take account of upcoming general pay claims in the public sector and pay equity settlements. In last year’s Budget, the figure for the current year was $3.76 billion, followed by $4.46b for next year, $4.3b for the following and then $4.3b. \n\nWillis also confirmed yesterday that the savings in the Budget would have been booked whether or not the bill had passed into law. For Budget purposes, the Cabinet policy decision was necessary, not the passage of the bill through all stages. That means there was no compelling reason not to send it to a select committee, other than to avoid a protracted debate.\n\nThey forgot to tell the voters\n\nAct Workplace Minister Brooke van Velden says the new law will improve the system. Straight after the election, she apparently told the Prime Minister when she was made minister that she wanted to work on changes to the pay equity system. She forgot to tell the voters. Nobody campaigned on it. \n\nThe Government clearly believes that there have been too many settlements that have paid too much. They refuse to say which settlements or how much. Winston Peters, answering on behalf of the Prime Minister, yesterday said the move was to restore the regime that had been in place before pay equity legislation was passed in 2020 because no settlements had been made since then. That is not correct. A total of 10 pay equity deals have been settled since the 2020 legislation was passed, establishing the process to be followed. Three pay equity deals were negotiated before the 2020 legislation.\n\nWhat happens next\n\nIncluding the care and support workers, there are 33 claims in the pipeline, either sitting with employers or in the court system, which have now been extinguished. \n\nAny of the 10 existing agreements settled that had review clauses in them to avoid the same problem the care and support workers had with eroding relativities have had those clauses nullified. The unions progressing those claims will now have to go back to square one to lodge new claims under the new rules.\n\nBut the most egregious result sits with the care and support workers. The way to address an unfair situation is not usually to exacerbate the unfairness.\n\nAlternative titles\n\nPart of any debate on a bill is its title. Labour and the Greens put up a series of alternatives to the Equal Pay Amendment Bill, including:\n\nUnequal Pay Entrenchment Bill\n\nEqual Pay (War on Workers) Amendment Bill\n\nEqual Pay (Do Anything Other Than Improve the Tax System) Amendment Bill\n\nEqual Pay (War on Women) Amendment Bill\n\nEqual Pay (Thoughts and Prayers But Your Salary Won’t Get Higher) Amendment Bill\n\nNeedlesss to say, none made it.\n\nAu revoir David Parker\n\nRespected Labour list MP and former Attorney General, Revenue Minister and Environment Minister David Parker gave his final speech in Parliament last night to a packed gallery including former Prime Ministers Helen Clark and Sir Geoffrey Palmer, Chief Justice Dame Helen Winkelmann, Treasury Secretary Iain Rennie, Labour luminaries Mike Williams, Marian Hobbs, Paul Tolich and Craig Renney, environmentalists Gary Taylor and Simon Upton, and opinion-makers Matthew Hooton, Morgan Godfery, Annette Sykes, Max Rushbrooke and Jonathan Boston. \n\nIt was a carefully crafted and dense speech with some lengthy reckons on taxation, the environment and the Treaty of Waitangi. But it would probably be better to read it in detail on the parliamentary website than to watch it. He kept his head down most of the way through it. The after-match function had to be held at the National Library because Parliament’s events venues were already booked: the Grand Hall for a music event with Troy Kingi and Georgia Lines to mark NZ Music Week; and the Banquet Hall for a Europe Day reception.\n\nParker will be replaced by Vanushi Walters, who was MP for Upper Harbour last term.\n\nBy the way...\n\nJustice Minister Paul Goldsmith showed some gumption at the start of Question Time yesterday. Realising that Nicola Willis wasn’t in the House yet to answer the first question about the Government ‘s fiscal intentions and objectives, he sprang to his feet: “On behalf of the Minister, the Government’s fiscal intentions are to restore fiscal discipline to this country and to meet all our objectives.”\n\nWillis appeared in time for the supplementary question from Nancy Lu: “What is required to achieve the Government’s fiscal strategy?” Quick as a flash, Labour deputy leader Carmel Sepuloni interjected: “Showing up on time.” Welcome to Inside Politics.\n\nQuote unquote\n\n“We’re actually going to turn up and act like a real country, and that’s what we’re doing” – Judith Collins on where she is taking the country on defence.\n\nA National electorate MP has put a bill into a ballot that would ban social media for under-16s.

An ambulance belonging to the project was also hit.\n\nLt-Gen Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry said that as per the Geneva Conventions, it was prohibited to attack, destroy, remove or render useless objects that were indispensable to the survival of the civilian population, such as drinking water supplies/installations and irrigation works. \n\nTrump’s plea & NSAs’ chat \n\nDonald Trump called for India and Pakistan to halt their fighting immediately, and offe-red to help end the worst violence between the two nuclear-armed neighbours in two decades. “It’s so terrible,” Mr Trump said at the White House. “I get along with both, I know both very well, and I want to see them work it out. I want to see them stop.\n\n“They’ve gone tit-for-tat, so hopefully they can stop now, but I know both. We get along with both countries very well, good relationships with both, and I want to see it stop. And if I can do anything to help, I will. I will be there,” he said.\n\nMeanwhile, in an interview to TRT World, Foreign Min-ister Ishaq Dar confirmed that the national security advisers of India and Pakis-tan had been in touch. Mr Dar was questio-n--ed about whether the NSAs had spoken after the overnight action, to which he said: “Yes there has been contact between the two.”\n\nPakistan had recently named ISI Director General Lt Gen Muhammad Asim Malik as the NSA, while his counterpart from India is Ajit Doval. Earlier, NDTV quoted Do--val as telling his foreign counterparts that India has no in--tention to escalate. How-ever, other voices in the Indian government seemed to contradict his sentiment. \n\nIndian ‘operation’ and ‘crashes’\n\nAccording to New Delhi, its strikes targeted “terrorist camps” that served as rec-ruitment centres, launchpads, and indoctrination centres, and housed weapons and training facilities. “Intelligence and monitoring of Pakistan-based terror modules showed that further attacks against India were impending, therefore it was necessary to take pre-emptive and precautionary strikes,” Indian Foreign Sec-retary Vikram Misri, the top official in its external affairs ministry, told the briefing.\n\nPakistan claimed to have shot down at least three Rafale fighters, and two Russian-made fighter jets during engagements. \n\nAlthough India did not confirm Pakistan’s claim of shooting down five of its jets, local government sources in Indian-held Kashmir told Reuters that three fighter jets had crashed in separate areas during the night.\n\nAll three pilots had been hospitalised, the sources added. Indian defence ministry officials were not immediately available to confirm the report.\n\nImages circulating on local media showed a large, damaged cylindrical chunk of silver-coloured metal lying in a field at one of the crash sites.\n\nMeanwhile, CNN quoted a French security official as saying that at least one of the dow-ned aircraft was, in fact, a Rafale aircraft.\n\nPreparations in AJK, held Kashmir\n\nMeanwhile, preventive me--asures were taken along the Line of Control on Wednesday, as the AJK government on Wednesday established a Cen-tral Emergency Response Cen--tre to coordinate rescue, relief, and damage assessment efforts.\n\nOfficials in Muzaffarabad, Haveli, Poonch, and Kotli noted that a precise evaluation of property losses was still underway. As part of the emergency measu-r--es, all educational institutions across the region were ordered closed until further notice.\n\nIn Muzaffarabad’s Shawai area, a mosque struck by missiles — killing three people, including its 80-year-old caretaker — remained the focus of high-profile visits throughout the day. \n\nAmong the visitors were members of the United Nations Military Observers Group for India and Pakistan (UNMOGIP), who were briefed by military officials on the unprovoked Indian attack.\n\nDeputy Commissioner Faro--oq said many residents had been evacuated from Shawai overnight and returned home by the afternoon. Residents who lived near the mosque shared harrowing accounts of the attack.\n\n“At first, we had no idea what was happening. My daughter and I had just stepped into the veranda when she was struck by shrapnel. We immediately ran for cover,” said Safeer Awan, a lawyer whose house is located just metres from the mosque.\n\nErdogan conveys solidarity\n\nTurkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has spoken by phone with Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif to convey his solidarity after Indian strikes, Reuters reported.\n\nDuring the call, Mr Erdogan told the premier that Turkiye supported Pakistan’s “calm and restrained policies” in the crisis, his office said in a statement.\n\nMr Erdogan also described Islamabad’s call for an investigation into the Pahalgam attack as “appropriate”. \n\nMeanwhile, the UN has renewed its call for “maximum restraint”, APP reported. Responding to questions at a news briefing at UN Headquarters in New York, UN Spokesperson Stephanie Tremblay reiterated that the world cannot afford a military confrontation between the two nations.\n\nAsked whether the UN personnel serving the United Nations Observer Group in India and Pakistan, which monitors the Line of Control, were safe, she said, “Yes, we checked and everybody was safe.”\n\nWith input from AFP and Reuters.

Rates have been there since December after a series of cuts in the second half of 2024.The Fed gathered at a highly volatile moment for the economy and the global financial system amid an onslaught of policy changes from Trump just months into his second term in the White House.In a statement Wednesday, the Fed acknowledged that the labour market was still solid but that uncertainty about the economic outlook had increased further and that the risks of higher unemployment and higher inflation have risen. Since the Fed's last meeting in March, the administration announced and then rolled back aggressive new tariffs as Trump gave countries time to reach trade deals before a July deadline. Still, a 10% universal tariff remains in place, along with additional levies on steel, aluminum and cars. Trump has also imposed a minimum tariff of 145% on Chinese goods.The whiplash has unnerved financial markets, stoking volatility as Wall Street digested the various twists and turns associated with Trump's trade policy and his subsequent attacks on Fed Chair Jerome Powell for ignoring his demands to lower interest rates.The upheaval has created complications for the central bank. It is struggling to both assess the economic fallout from Trump's policies and game out how it will set monetary policy in an environment in which its goals of maintaining a healthy labor market and keeping inflation low and stable may be in tension with one another.Officials have grown increasingly worried about how much Trump's policies, which also include slashing spending and deporting immigrants, will sap growth. Some companies have already started to warn about sluggish sales as consumers have turned much more downbeat about the outlook. The fear is that the uncertainty will further chill business activity.But unlike in the past, the Fed is not in a position to respond to early signs that the economy is weakening by preemptively lowering interest rates. That is because of inflation: Price pressures stemming from the post-pandemic surge have not been fully snuffed out, and now Trump's tariffs risk rekindling them.It is too early to tell if the tariff-induced jump in inflation will prove to be temporary, or if it morphs into something more persistent. So far, market-based measures of inflation expectations, to which the Fed pays closest attention, suggest that inflation will indeed remain contained after an initial pop.","summary":"The unanimous decision to stand pat will keep rates at 4.25% to 4.5%.

The Washingtonian reported that at least three colleges will be offering a Trump-themed class for the upcoming fall semester. George Mason University's Schar School of Policy and Government will offer a \"US Democracy in Crisis\" course that will allegedly focus on how the United States is no longer a democracy under Trump. Professor Jennifer Nicoll Victor previously taught the course in the Spring of 2022, but said this year's class will focus on how the U.S. has \"moved to a regime type that is not classified as a democracy,\" she told The Washingtonian. COLLEGE OFFERING ‘WHITE SUPREMACY IN THE AGE OF TRUMP’ COURSE AS PRESIDENT-ELECT RETURNS TO WHITE HOUSE Johns Hopkins University's Center for Advanced Governmental Studies will offer a course titled \"The Presidency\" which will examine how the \"executive branch has be-come more significant in US culture and politics during the second Trump administration,\" the outlet reported. At George Washington University, a political science course on \"The American Presidency\" will analyze the \"controversies and disruptions\" of the second Trump term and the \"impact and dysfunctionality of the Trump administration and the likelihood for its success long term,\" according to lecturer Michael Goff. It's not just Washington-area colleges offering courses centered on Trump's second term. Fox News Digital previously reported that Smith College, a private liberal arts women's college in Northampton, Massachusetts, offered a 4-credit course titled \"White Supremacy in the Age of Trump\" this spring semester. CLICK HERE FOR THE LATEST MEDIA AND CULTURE NEWS Last fall, Fox News Digital reported on several universities across the country that offered \"safe spaces\" to students and faculty following Trump's election victory. Students at elite schools like Georgetown's McCourt School of Public Policy were reportedly offered treats like \"milk and cookies\" and \"hot cocoa,\" as well as \"Lego\" toys and \"coloring and mindfulness exercises\" to get their minds off the election results, the day after Trump won. Professors at Harvard University also reportedly canceled classes that day, made attendance optional or extended assignment deadlines for their students.

Not anymore in the Western world","text":"On Friday, Germany’s domestic intelligence agency officially labeled Alternative for Germany — the country’s most popular conservative party — as a “right-wing extremist” organization. The nationalist party surged to second place in February’s federal election, winning 20.8% of the vote. This new designation grants the ruling government expanded powers to surveil Alternative for Germany leaders and supporters and sets the stage for an outright ban.\n\nGermany has now joined a growing list of Western governments that delay elections, disqualify candidates, and ban opposition parties — all in the name of defending democracy.\n\nDemocracy has become a marketing slogan — useful for justifying war and globalist expansion, but disposable when it interferes with ruling-class priorities.\n\nTo call Germany’s relationship with authoritarianism “complicated” understates the case. The country’s historical memory fixates on Nazism as the ultimate expression of right-wing extremism and mass atrocity. But that singular focus conveniently ignores the fact that the Soviet Union, which helped defeat the Third Reich, imposed its own brutal regime across East Germany until the Berlin Wall fell.\n\nModern Germany has seen tyranny from both the far right and the far left. Yet its national identity now orbits entirely around a rejection of right-wing politics. Anti-fascism has become something like a state religion. But when a country builds its identity on shame and self-repudiation, it risks cultural collapse. We’ve seen the same pathology infect America, where elite institutions push a national narrative defined entirely by slavery and racial guilt.\n\nEvery nation has dark chapters. A mature society learns from them. It doesn’t define itself by them forever.\n\nWhile German history explains some of its deep aversion to nationalism, the trend of suppressing populist movements in the name of democracy has spread far beyond Berlin.\n\nBrazil’s Supreme Court banned former President Jair Bolsonaro from seeking office until 2030. Romania’s Constitutional Court voided its 2024 election, citing supposed Russian influence in the rise of populist candidate Călin Georgescu. And in the United States, courts came dangerously close to removing Donald Trump from the ballot — while the president now fights legal battles over whether he can exercise executive power at all under Article II of the Constitution.\n\nThis isn’t democracy defending itself. It’s ruling elites trying to outlaw their opposition.\n\nWestern elites justify their dominance by invoking democracy and individual liberty. That wasn’t always the case. The West once called itself Christendom — a civilizational identity grounded in faith, tradition, and truth. But it abandoned that foundation in favor of secular platitudes.\n\nThe United States has waged entire wars in the name of exporting democracy to places like Iraq and Afghanistan — nations that never wanted it and were never going to keep it. These projects were doomed from the start. Yet at least they wrapped American power in the language of benevolence.\n\nToday, even that fig leaf has disappeared.\n\nThe modern West treats democracy as a branding exercise, not a principle. Leaders like Joe Biden, Justin Trudeau, and Keir Starmer love lecturing the world about “liberal norms,” even as they jail political dissidents, censor speech, and turn domestic intelligence services against their own citizens. They condemn Vladimir Putin’s authoritarianism while staying silent as NATO allies crush dissent at home.\n\nDemocracy has become a marketing slogan — useful for justifying war and globalist expansion, but disposable when it interferes with ruling-class priorities.\n\nVice President JD Vance and Secretary of State Marco Rubio both slammed the German government for labeling Alternative for Germany as extremist. On social media, Rubio went further, blaming Germany’s open-border policies for the Alternative for Germany rise and calling the state’s surveillance powers tyranny in disguise.\n\nGermany’s Foreign Office issued a formal reply, insisting the decision stemmed from an “independent” and “thorough” investigation.\n\nThe claim is absurd on its face.\n\nNo government can “independently” investigate and condemn its most prominent political opposition — especially not when the accusation is “extremism,” a term that now means little more than holding views the ruling class finds inconvenient.\n\nI’ve made no secret of my dislike of modern mass democracy. But the original concept, at least, had merit. Democracy once meant rule by the demos — the people of a particular nation, rooted in shared history, culture, and civic identity. Its legitimacy came not from procedure or process but from the bonds between citizens and their country.\n\nToday’s ruling class has twisted that definition beyond recognition. As I’ve written before, globalist elites now use the word “democracy” to describe a system governed by unaccountable institutions they alone control. Populism, they say, is dangerous. Democracy, they insist, must be preserved. But in practice, they oppose the popular will and protect only the process they’ve captured.\n\nElections have become sacraments — rituals that legitimize the rule of bureaucracies, not expressions of the people’s will. The process is sacred, not the outcome. That’s why Western politicians now speak of “our sacred democracy,” which must be defended not from tyranny, but from actual democratic movements.\n\nWestern leaders still try to justify their global power by invoking freedom and liberty. But their credibility has collapsed. It’s farcical to hear men like Justin Trudeau or Keir Starmer preach about “shared Western values” while jailing political opponents and silencing dissent at home.\n\nThe moral authority of liberal democracy is crumbling. And the cause isn’t Putin or China. It’s Western leaders who’ve gutted the electoral process and replaced it with rule by managerial elites.\n\nThe Trump administration should continue to expose this hypocrisy. But it also must act. That means offering political asylum to dissidents facing persecution in places like Germany, Canada, and the United Kingdom.\n\nAmericans rightly recoil at repression in Russia. They should feel the same revulsion when it comes from our “allies” in Berlin, Ottawa, or London.","summary":"On Friday, Germany’s domestic intelligence agency officially labeled Alternative for Germany — the country’s most popular conservative party — as a “right-wing extremist” organization.

especially on environmental issues.\"The President continues his unconstitutional attempts to withhold funding that Congress appropriated to programs he dislikes,\" said California Attorney General Rob Bonta.\"This time he's illegally stripping away billions of dollars for electric vehicle charging infrastructure, all to line the pockets of his Big Oil friends.\"A mammoth congressional bill passed in 2022 aimed at bolstering America's crumbling infrastructure included $5 billion to help build out charging points for electric vehicles.But as soon as he arrived in the Oval Office in January, Trump ordered that the money be stopped, part of a slew of executive orders the Republican has issued, which also included demands that the United States produce more fossil fuels.The cash had been allocated by Congress to the states, and in some cases was expected to be paired with state and private funds as jurisdictions look to grow charging networks and reduce the range anxiety that drivers of gas cars sometimes say puts them off switching to electric vehicles.The lawsuit announced Wednesday contends that as president, Trump does not have the power to divert monies the legislature has allocated.\"The complaint asks the court to declare that the... directive is unlawful and to permanently stop the administration from withholding the funds,\" a statement said.Trump, a climate change skeptic, has long been hostile to electric vehicles and has repeatedly lashed out at Environmental Protection Agency rules requiring automakers to cut greenhouse gas emissions in their cars.California, which is home to the lion's share of EVs and hybrid vehicles in the United States, plans to phase out the sale of new gas-powered vehicles by 2035.The lawsuit comes as Republicans in Congress are trying to remove the rules that allow the state -- the biggest and richest in the nation -- to make its own vehicle emission rules.\"The facts don't lie: The demand for clean transportation continues to rise, and California will be at the forefront of this transition to a more sustainable, low-emissions future,\" said Bonta.\"California will not back down, not from Big

Libya","text":"Donald Trump’s administration is working to ramp up its pointless cruelty toward immigrants, and has apparently been plotting to have the military send Asian immigrants to Libya imminently, according to immigration lawyers. \n\n The plan to deport immigrants to Libya, a war-torn country known for widespread mistreatment of migrants, would represent not just a likely human rights violation but another brazen act of defiance toward the federal judiciary. \n\n Last month, a federal judge in Massachusetts issued an injunction barring the Trump administration from deporting any noncitizen to a third country — a country that is not their country of origin — without due process, and without giving them a meaningful opportunity to demonstrate they fear being persecuted, tortured, or killed if they are sent there.\n\n Judge Brian Murphy, who issued that injunction, quickly issued an order on Wednesday clarifying that “the allegedly imminent removals, as reported by news agencies and as plaintiffs seek to corroborate with class-member accounts and public information, would clearly violate this court’s order.”\n\n The New York Times reported Tuesday that the Trump administration was planning to use a military plane to fly immigrants to Libya as early as Wednesday. When Trump was asked Wednesday whether he was planning to send immigrants to Libya, he replied, “I don’t know, you’ll have to ask Homeland Security, please.”\n\n Lawyers with the National Immigration Litigation Alliance, the Northwest Immigrant Rights Project, and Human Rights First submitted an emergency motion before Murphy on Wednesday.\n\n The lawyers warned that “Laotian, Vietnamese, and Philippine” immigrants, who are being detained by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) in Texas, were “being prepared for removal to Libya, a county notorious for its human rights violations, especially with respect to migrant residents.” They said the immigrants had not received required notice or a chance to apply for protection under the Convention Against Torture.\n\n “Libya has a long record of extreme human rights violations,” the lawyers wrote. “Any class member who is removed to Libya faces a strong likelihood of imprisonment followed by torture and even disappearance or death.”\n\n Included as an exhibit was an email from an immigration lawyer at the Orange County Public Defender in California. It said: “What we’re hearing from relatives is that, yesterday, ICE officers at the South Texas Detention Facility gathered 1 Vietnamese detainee, along with 5 others (including 1 from Laos) into a room and told them that they needed to sign a document agreeing to be deported to Libya. When they all refused, they were each put in a separate room and cuffed in (basically, solitary) in order to get them to sign it.”\n\n Another exhibit included emailed declarations from lawyers at the Asylum Defense Project. One lawyer wrote that a Laotian man at the South Texas ICE Processing Center “may be sent to Libya or Saudi Arabia imminently.” She went to meet with immigrants there, “but they have already been moved out,” her colleague wrote. \n\n The Trump administration has already deported hundreds of Venezuelan migrants to a notorious mega-prison in El Salvador without due process, despite a federal judge’s order not to, claiming that no one can force the administration to bring them back. Trump and his officials have prominently refused to bring back Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a Maryland man whom it illegally deported to the Central American nation — even after the Supreme Court issued a unanimous 9-0 decision ordering it to “facilitate” his return. \n\n El Salvador’s prison system is known for torture and abuses, and its judicial system is effectively a “black hole,” as Rolling Stone has reported. But shipping immigrants to Libya would be a new low.\n\n The State Department’s 2023 annual report on human rights practices in Libya found, among other things, “credible reports of: arbitrary or unlawful killings, including extrajudicial killings; enforced disappearance; torture or cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment or punishment perpetrated by the government and armed groups on all sides; harsh and life-threatening prison conditions; arbitrary arrest or detention; serious problems with the independence of the judiciary; political prisoners or detainees; arbitrary or unlawful interference with privacy; punishment of family members for alleged offenses by a relative; serious abuses in a conflict, including reportedly widespread civilian deaths or harm.”\n\n The report painted an even more dire picture for migrants and refugees. \n\n “Migrants, refugees, and other foreign nationals were especially vulnerable to kidnapping,” the report said, adding that “such individuals remained vulnerable to seizure by armed groups engaged in human trafficking or migrant smuggling.” \n\n Elsewhere, the report said: “An unknown number of individuals, including refugees, asylum seekers, and other migrants, were held in facilities under the control of armed groups” including in “extralegal facilities run by smugglers and other nonstate actors.” \n\n It continued: “The criminal and nonstate armed groups controlling extralegal facilities routinely tortured and abused detainees, subjecting them to arbitrary killings, rape and sexual violence, beatings, electric shocks, burns, forced labor, and deprivation of food and water, according to dozens of testimonies shared with international aid agencies and human rights groups. In many instances, the purpose of this abuse was reportedly to extort payments from detainees’ families.”The New York Times reported Wednesday afternoon that Libya’s two rival governments both denied having agreed to any deal to accept deportations from the U.S.","summary":"A federal judge clarified that Trump’s reported plan to deport immigrants to Libya would violate his existing order prohibiting such acts","url":"https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-news/trump-deport-asian-immigrants-libya-1235334112/","image":"https://www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/TrumpLibyaDeportations-1.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-05-07 23:57:10","author":"Althea Legaspi,Andrew Perez","authors":["Althea Legaspi","Andrew Perez"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.286},{"id":318949346,"title":"Meta blocks access to prominent Muslim news page in India","text":"Instagram users in India trying to access posts from the handle @Muslim – a page with 6.7 million followers – were met with a message stating: “Account not available in India.

the American president's overreach, especially on environmental issues.\n\n\"The President continues his unconstitutional attempts to withhold funding that Congress appropriated to programs he dislikes,\" said California Attorney General Rob Bonta.\n\n\"This time he's illegally stripping away billions of dollars for electric vehicle charging infrastructure, all to line the pockets of his Big Oil friends.\"\n\nA mammoth congressional bill passed in 2022 aimed at bolstering America's crumbling infrastructure included $5 billion to help build out charging points for electric vehicles.\n\nBut as soon as he arrived in the Oval Office in January, Trump ordered that the money be stopped, part of a slew of executive orders the Republican has issued, which also included demands that the United States produce more fossil fuels.\n\nThe cash had been allocated by Congress to the states, and in some cases was expected to be paired with state and private funds as jurisdictions look to grow charging networks and reduce the range anxiety that drivers of gas cars sometimes say puts them off switching to electric vehicles.\n\nThe lawsuit announced Wednesday contends that as president, Trump does not have the power to divert monies the legislature has allocated.\n\n\"The complaint asks the court to declare that the... directive is unlawful and to permanently stop the administration from withholding the funds,\" a statement said.\n\nTrump, a climate change skeptic, has long been hostile to electric vehicles and has repeatedly lashed out at Environmental Protection Agency rules requiring automakers to cut greenhouse gas emissions in their cars.\n\nCalifornia, which is home to the lion's share of EVs and hybrid vehicles in the United States, plans to phase out the sale of new gas-powered vehicles by 2035.\n\nThe lawsuit comes as Republicans in Congress are trying to remove the rules that allow the state -- the biggest and richest in the nation -- to make its own vehicle emission rules.\n\n\"The facts don't lie: The demand for clean transportation continues to rise, and California will be at the forefront of this transition to a more sustainable, low-emissions future,\" said Bonta.\n\n\"California will not back down, not from Big Oil, and not from federal overreach.\"\n\nBonta is joined in the lawsuit by attorneys general from, Colorado, Arizona, Delaware, Hawaii, Illinois, Maryland, Minnesota, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Oregon, Rhode Island, Washington, Wisconsin, Vermont, and the District of Columbia.\n\nSource:

On Tuesday, the board of directors for Maine's Region School Unit (RSU) No. 24 voted 7-1 to rescind a policy that allows trans athletes to compete in girls sports. The rescinded policy, Policy JB, stated that \"students shall be able to participate in accordance with the gender identity asserted at school.\" CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM RSU No. 24 Superintendent Michael Eastman confirmed to Fox News Digital that the district and its schools will stop following the policy immediately. \"At its meeting last night, after respectful deliberation, the RSU No. 24 Board of Directors voted 7-1 (one director was absent) to rescind Policy JB — Transgender and Gender-Expansive Students,\" Eastman said. \"This change will take place immediately. We appreciate the turnout last evening and thank those residents who addressed the board with their thoughts regarding the policy.\" MAINE GIRL INVOLVED IN TRANS ATHLETE BATTLE REVEALS HOW STATE'S POLICIES HURT HER CHILDHOOD AND SPORTS CAREER RSU No. 24 operates five public schools in Sullivan, Maine. Hancock county, where Sullivan is located, voted in favor of Donald Trump in November's election by a margin of 52.9% to 45.3%. Eastman's district is not the first to amend a gender eligibility policy in recent weeks. The MSAD No. 70 School Board voted unanimously in mid-April to comply with Title IX, \"recognizing only two sexes — biological male and biological female — and that all private spaces be separated by biological sex.\" MSAD No. 70 Superintendent Tyler Putnam told Fox News Digital that, due to this vote, he is now directed to amend the district's policies to prevent trans athletes from competing in girls sports. \"The motion directs me to rewrite our policies to adhere to the motion,\" Putnam said. \"It is my interpretation that the school board will be looking to approve policies that align biological sex to their specific athletic teams too, i.e. biological males will be playing with only other biological males and the same for biological females. These policies will need to be approved by the policy committee and the board once rewritten.\" Maine is being sued by the Department of Justice for failing to come to an agreement to comply with Trump's \"Keeping Men Out of Women's Sports\" executive order. Maine has loosely allowed trans athletes to compete with girls since 2005, when the Maine Human Rights Act prohibited discrimination based on gender identity. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP The Maine Principals' Association (MPA) updated its policies in 2024 to explicitly allow transgender students to compete on teams matching their gender identity. The state, particularly its Democratic leadership led by Gov. Janet Mills, is doubling down to defy Trump and protect its trans athletes' rights to compete against girls and share girls locker rooms. Many residents, and now school districts, have taken steps to oppose Mills. There have been multiple protests across the state, including two at the state Capitol in August, by activists looking to protect girls from trans competitors. Attention to the issue was magnified this past week after a trans athlete won multiple events at a girls track meet. A trans-identifying athlete who competed for North Yarmouth Academy in Yarmouth, Maine, at the Poland-NYA-Yarmouth-Seacoast meet, won the 1600-meter with a time of 5:57.27, blowing away the second-place runner who finished with a time of 6:16.32. In the 800-meter, the trans athlete had a closer first-place finish with a time of 2:43.31, just around a second better than the second-place finisher with a time of 2:44.87. In October 2023, Fox News Digital reported that this athlete was transgender. A survey by the American Parents Coalition found that out of about 600 registered Maine voters, 63% said that school sports participation should be based on biological sex, and 66% agreed it is \"only fair to restrict women’s sports to biological women.\" The poll also found that 60% of residents would support a ballot measure limiting participation in women’s and girls sports to biological females. This included 64% of independents and 66% of parents with kids under age 18.

But we also must recognize the reality that our world has fundamentally changed,' he said to applause.\n\nHe met with Trump in the Oval Office earlier this week, where the President doubled down on his '51st state' plans.\n\nThe explosive meeting was intended to foster better relations between the two nations as they seek to come to an agreement over the imposition of massive tariffs.\n\nTrump said if the two nations joined together it would be a 'wonderful marriage.' He added: 'But it takes two to tango, right?' \n\nCarney told the former real estate developer flatly: 'There are some places that are never for sale,' mentioning the White House and Buckingham Palace.\n\nTrump refused to give up hope, jovially adding: 'I say ''never say never''.'\n\nHe went on to hail the meeting a success, later telling reporters: 'We had a very great meeting.

Khatahtbeh apologized to followers in India, adding: \"When platforms and countries try to silence media, it tells us that we are doing our job in holding those in power accountable.\"\"We will continue to document the truth and stand out firmly for justice,\" he added, while calling on Meta to reinstate the account in India.India has also banned more than a dozen Pakistani YouTube channels for allegedly spreading \"provocative\" content, including Pakistani news outlets.In recent days, access to the Instagram account of Pakistan's former prime minister and cricket captain Imran Khan has also been blocked in India.Pakistani Bollywood movie regulars Fawad Khan and Atif Aslam were also off limits in India, as well as a wide range of cricketers -- including star batters Babar Azam and Mohammad Rizwan and retired players Shahid Afridi and Wasim Akram.Rising hostilities between the South Asian neighbors have also unleashed an avalanche of online misinformation, with social media users circulating everything from deepfake videos to outdated images from unrelated conflicts, falsely linking them to the Indian strikes.On Wednesday, US President Donald Trump called for India and Pakistan to immediately halt their fighting, and offered to help end the violence.","summary":"Meta has banned a prominent Muslim news page on Instagram in India at the government's request, the account's founder said Wednesday, denouncing the move as \"censorship\" as hostilities escalate between India and Pakistan.","url":"https://www.ibtimes.com/meta-blocks-access-muslim-news-page-india-3772867","image":"https://d.ibtimes.com/en/full/4599439/muslim-news-page-was-banned-instagram-india-following-worst-violence-between-nuclear-armed.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-05-07 23:45:16","author":"Anuj Chopra","authors":["Anuj Chopra"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.305},{"id":318949434,"title":"Trump nominates health influencer Casey Means for surgeon general after pulling nomination of Janette Nesheiwat","text":"President Donald Trump pulled his nomination of a former Fox News contributor for surgeon general and instead nominated Casey Means, a health influencer allied with Robert F.
