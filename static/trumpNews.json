Temporary spending bills generally fund agencies at current levels, but an additional $231 million was included to bolster the Secret Service after the two assassination attempts against Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump, and additional money was added to aid with the presidential transition, among other things. Lawmakers have struggled to get to this point as the current budget year winds to a close at month’s end. At the urging of the most conservative members of his conference, House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., had linked temporary funding with a mandate that would have compelled states to require proof of citizenship when people register to vote. But Johnson abandoned that approach to reach an agreement, even as Trump insisted there should not be a stop-gap measure without the voting requirement. Bipartisan negotiations began in earnest shortly after that, with leadership agreeing to extend funding into mid-December. That gives the current Congress the ability to fashion a full-year spending bill after the Nov. 5 election, rather than push that responsibility to the next Congress and president. In a letter to Republican colleagues, Johnson said the budget measure would be “very narrow, bare-bones” and include “only the extensions that are absolutely necessary.” “While this is not the solution any of us prefer, it is the most prudent path forward under the present circumstances,” Johnson wrote. “As history has taught and current polling affirms, shutting the government down less than 40 days from a fateful election would be an act of political malpractice.” House Democratic leader Hakeem Jeffries said Democrats would evaluate the bill in its entirety before this week’s vote, but with the agreement, “Congress is now on a bipartisan path to avoid a government shutdown that would hurt everyday Americans.”","summary":"WASHINGTON — Congressional leaders announced an agreement Sunday on a short-term spending bill that will fund federal agencies for about three months, averting a possible partial government shutdown when the new budget year begins Oct. 1 and pushing final decisions until after the November election.

Harris has spoken fondly of her mother’s influence, immersing her in Indian culture and instilling values of social justice from a young age. “My mother was 19 when she crossed the world alone, travelling from India to California with an unshakeable dream,” Harris, 56, shared at the Democratic National Convention in August. “She taught us never to complain about injustice but to do something about it.” Gopalan was a breast cancer researcher who emigrated to the US in 1958. She died in 2009, aged 70. As Harris takes to the campaign trail, she has been cautious about highlighting her Indian identity, aware that it may not resonate with all voters – while her rival, Donald Trump, readily deploys racist dog whistles. Yet analysts predict that if she wins in November, Harris will likely emphasise her South Asian heritage to strengthen ties with India, a crucial US partner. “I think Harris is only likely to play up her South Asian identity if and after she wins, and not before,” said Vivek Mishra, a researcher of US-India relations and a fellow at the Observer Research Foundation think tank in New Delhi. Harris has already shown her commitment to democratic values, gently pressing Prime Minister Narendra Modi on India’s human rights record during their 2021 meeting in Washington. “I know from personal experience and from my family the commitment of the Indian people to democracy,” she said at the time, hinting at the work needed to uphold democratic values. Modi told Harris the people of India are “waiting to welcome you”, an invitation that will doubtless be renewed if she succeeds Joe Biden as US president. Despite criticisms from some Democrats about Modi’s human rights track record, Mishra said that many have embraced India as a crucial ally in the Indo-Pacific region. Echoes of Obama Experts say Harris’ Indian roots are likely to spark emotional connections in parts of India, much like Barack Obama’s Kenyan ties did in Africa. Obama also spent part of his childhood living in Indonesia and received warm receptions whenever he visited the Southeast Asian nation, with domestic news offering live coverage of him visiting his childhood home in Jakarta in 2017. A Harris victory might evoke similar sentiments in India. Residents of Thulasendrapuram celebrated her winning the vice-presidency four years ago, and the community now displays banners in support of her presidential bid. Harris “likes to highlight her Indian origins and especially her family and upbringing, but as with Obama and Kenya, that is unlikely to have a meaningful effect on policy outcomes,” said Dhruva Jaishankar, a foreign-policy specialist and executive director of the Observer Research Foundation America. Earlier this month, Harris shared a photo of her grandparents on social media to mark National Grandparents’ Day, recalling childhood visits to India that helped shape her political consciousness. Although her family ties may not significantly influence her broader policies towards Asia, they reinforce the narrative of the “American dream” and resonate with the Indian community in the United States, said Atul Mishra, an international-relations professor at Shiv Nadar University in India. “They may hold some sentimental value for her at the personal level and act as leverage in appealing to the Indian community at home, but I’m not sure if they will inform her approach to India and Asia at all,” he said. With Indian-Americans among the fastest-growing ethnic groups in the US – numbering 4.8 million as of the 2022 census – analysts say there’s a keen interest in seeing one of their own attain the highest office in the land. Her Indian roots could help strike a chord with Southeast Asia. It could certainly bear dividends Priyajit Debsarkar, geopolitical analyst “Harris’ connections with India are personal ties and run deep,” said Rafiq Dossani, an economist and analyst at the US-based RAND Centre for Asia-Pacific Policy. “Will that increase support for her in India? I think it definitely will.” However, Dossani remains sceptical about her appeal extending across Southeast Asia, despite the region’s historical connections to Indian culture. “I am less confident about Asia-wide support,” he said. Others argue that her Asian heritage could foster comfort among regional leaders in dealing with a potential Harris White House. “Her Indian roots could help strike a chord with Southeast Asia,” said Priyajit Debsarkar, a London-based geopolitical analyst and author. “It could certainly bear dividends if she works hard to cement ties that she has arduously tried to build through [regional] trips during her tenure as vice-president.”","summary":"Harris’ embrace of her South Asian identity not only mirrors Obama’s Southeast Asian ties, it could enhance US-India relations if she wins.","url":"https://www.scmp.com/week-asia/politics/article/3279374/kamala-harris-indian-roots-echo-obamas-global-appeal-race-against-trump","image":"https://cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2024/09/20/4e1efe31-da24-4cbc-8264-08b38a257574_51bb557a.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-23 00:00:17","author":"Amy Sood,Biman Mukherji,Maria Siow","authors":["Amy Sood","Biman Mukherji","Maria Siow"],"language":"en","source_country":"cn","sentiment":0.235},{"id":257032516,"title":"Mayor of Muslim-majority Michigan city endorses Trump: ‘Right choice for this critical time’","text":"The mayor of a Muslim-majority city in Michigan says he is endorsing Donald Trump in the 2024 presidential election, calling the former commander-in-chief, \"the right choice for this critical time.\" Amer Ghalib, mayor of the Detroit-area suburb Hamtramck, announced his endorsement of Trump in a Facebook post Sunday.

While Harris is considered a severe underdog in Montana, Democrats are still hoping they can voters to turn out to save incumbent Senator Jon Tester against Donald Trump-endorsed Tim Sheehy. Max Himsl, a voter living in the United Kingdom, wanted to make his choice once the ballots were online on Friday at 8am. The ballot listed both Trump and the now out of the race independent Robert F. Kennedy Jr. but not the vice president. Himsl said: ‘I’m upset my democratic process was interrupted’. The Montana Secretary of State claims that the errors were only found in their online system. ‘Our team and the vendor quickly investigated and found that only a few voters may have been impacted,’ the Secretary of State’s Office told the Daily Inter Lake. ‘As a precaution, the Electronic Absentee System has been taken offline until troubleshooting is completed.’ They promised that the system would be back online shortly after they’d taken it down. The voters impacted will be allowed to complete their ballots once it returns to functioning. ‘This does not affect any other ballots, including those that will be sent by mail,’ the Secretary of State’s Office said. Himsl, a first-time absentee voter, is worried about what this experience might mean for others. ‘This is very concerning to me,’ said Himsl. Citizens living overseas, including members of the armed forces, are allowed by law to vote absentee in elections. In Montana, a functioning absentee system allows them to vote starting 45 days until Election Day. While Democrats aren’t expected to come close in the presidential race, they’re still hoping to keep Tester in the Senate. Cook Political Report rates Tester’s race a ‘toss up,’ and former President Donald Trump won Montana by more than 16 points in 2020. Tester has held the Montana seat since 2007, in a state that heavily backed Trump during the 2020 election. Republicans see the battle as crucial to their hopes of taking control of the Senate. They expect to pick up a seat in West Virginia, where Democrat-turned-independent Joe Manchin is retiring, and need just one more to secure a majority in the upper chamber. The result is that millions of dollars is pouring into the battle between Tester and Sheehy, a former Navy SEAL. Latest campaign finance report show Tester has raised more than $43.7, a record amount, and three times more than he had collected by this stage in his 2018 race. Sheehy has raised $13.7 million since entering the contest a year ago. The importance of the race will be on full display on Friday, when former President Donald Trump holds a rally in support of Sheehy. He won the state by more than 16 points in 2020 and by more than 20 points over Hillary Clinton in 2016.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nThe state of Montana took its electronic absentee voting system offline shortly&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: State forced to shut down electronic polling system due to voting chaos caused by omission of major candidate first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/news/us/state-forced-to-shut-down-electronic-polling-system-due-to-voting-chaos-caused-by-omission-of-major-candidate/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/rewrite-this-title-Voting-chaos-as-state-is-forced-to.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-22 23:50:15","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.454},{"id":257031972,"title":"Letters to the Editor, Sept. 23, 2024","text":"Gabriel Vandermaarel Brantford, Ont.

After all, the vicious, unrelenting vitriol continues to be unleashed on Trump by high-ranking Democrats, including Kamala Harris, and mainstream media outlets like CNN, MSNBC and ABC. According to these underhanded zealots, Trump is another Hitler, a threat to democracy, a racist, a misogynist, and a dictator. This repugnant character assassination rolls on unabated. Is it any wonder that some nutcase feels justified in killing Trump? One must legitimately wonder if the Democrats and their media outlets are deliberately disseminating this acrimonious attack on Trump in the hopes that he is assassinated. After all, do the majority of Americans have any faith in the policies of the cackling Harris and the left-wing lunatic Walz?

The rally, held at Federal Plaza in the Loop, was organized by the Coalition of Haitian American Organizations in the Chicagoland Area. About 25 people attended and several community members, faith leaders and alderpersons spoke despite the afternoon’s persistent rain. During the Sept. 10 presidential debate against Democratic nominee Vice President Kamala Harris, Trump repeated the false claims that Haitian immigrants in Springfield, Ohio, were stealing and eating people’s cats and dogs. Many of Sunday’s speakers denounced the comments as racist and xenophobic. Trump’s running mate, Ohio Sen. JD Vance, has amplified debunked internet rumors about Haitian migrants as the Republican ticket criticizes the immigration policies of President Joe Biden’s administration that are supported by Harris. City officials acknowledge growing pains from the influx of some 15,000 Haitian immigrants, but say there’s no evidence to support the claim they are consuming anyone’s pets. More than 30 bomb threats have been made against schools, government buildings and city officials’ homes since last week, forcing evacuations and closures. At Sunday’s rally in Chicago, Daniel Jean, president of the Haitian American Professional Network of Chicago, said: “I stand with all my Haitian brothers and sisters across the country and all the way to Haiti to denounce the hateful remarks that are being levied against our people. “We deserve so much better,” Jean said. “One way to combat Haitian hate is to educate ourselves and to continue to educate other people about Haitian history, our culture and all of our contributions that we have continually made to this country.” Jean listed several key Haitian Americans. Chicago’s founder, Jean Baptiste Point du Sable, was Haitian, and Illinois Attorney General Kwame Raoul is the child of Haitian immigrants, Jean said. “You know who we are,” he said to cheers from the crowd. Darryl Auguste attended the rally to show support for the strong Haitian community that raised him. His parents emigrated from Haiti to Chicago before he was born. “The importance of this rally is not simply the fact that we are fighting against words that were harmful, but we’re supporting those that are helping to build us,” Auguste told the Sun-Times. “I know without my community, that I would not be where I’m at.” Auguste said that although Sunday’s rally was organized to call out hate and ignorance, it was also a chance to honor the contributions Haitians make to Chicago and the rest of the country. “As a Haitian American, I’m celebrating everything about me, both the Haitian side and the American side,” Auguste said. “I want everybody to see that we come here, and we help build this beautiful fabric that is the United States.” Contributing: Associated Press","url":"https://chicago.suntimes.com/chicago/2024/09/22/haiti-immigrants-trump-vance-ohio-campaign-chicago-immigrants","image":"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/7cdfe89/2147483647/strip/true/crop/6000x3425+0+287/resize/1461x834!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fe8%2F43%2Fd5da9ef596d4e0bbb0c822502a2e%2F40d8","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-22 23:46:14","author":"Kaitlin Washburn","authors":["Kaitlin Washburn"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.133},{"id":257032464,"title":"Memes for days","text":"So up to now it is still difficult to gauge what causes something to go viral. Of course, big things like “they are eating the cats, they are eating the dogs”, said at a nationwide debate by Donald Trump, would definitely go all over. We also had a good few viral moments from the Olympics. The breakdancer Raygun (Rachael Gunn) from Australia was a classic one. Of course, there was the pistol--shooting silver medal winner from Turkey, Yusuf Dikeç, whose cool demeanour and no-frills shooting style was one of the biggest things in the Olympics. Recently we had the policeman Terrance debacle go viral. It was late the Friday evening when I first heard about it. “What is the Terrance story?” I asked, after getting some late meme without context. “You now hearing about that, JP! That drop since this morning. It already have two songs and countless memes. You real late in the dance.” I was then sent the litany of videos sent by the wife and girlfriend and all the sketches of such. With social media such a major player in our lives, most of us are constantly on our phones, checking YouTube, TikTok, Facebook, WhatsApp, Instagram. There is positional power and almost increased ranking to persons who are the first to send the breaking news or new memes. So once something seems scandalous and funny, memes are quickly produced and forwarded with a veracity so that they easily become viral and the talk of the town. A few days later I was sent the calendar of the year so far, showing the main memes per month. It was then I realised that I was not really in the know, and for many of the memes I could not remember the story connecting. January was Karen Nunez--Tesheira climbing over the barrier to go to the funeral of former prime minister Basdeo Panday after she was not invited. After that episode, I must say Karen and her party lost serious potential -respect points with the population. The story spawned countless memes for days. February was a grandmother who sent her grandson to a church camp with two white folding chairs. It seems someone at the church camp stole one of her chairs and she made an entire video on social media saying she wanted back her chair, she knew which chair was hers, the chair was labelled, and she was requesting her chair be brought back to the Seventh-day Adventist Church. March was the episode with the policeman where his ticket machine was malfunctional and suddenly printed off an entire stream of tickets. The month of April was about the eclipse and everything weird that went with it. It triggered a load of conspiracy theories like “don’t bathe on the day of the eclipse since you would get moon-like skin lesions”. May was the woman who was caught in the taxi trying to thief someone’s phone. May was also the one of Minister of Works and Transport Rohan Sinanan eating doubles with a knife and fork. June was the commissioning of the peace pole in Tobago. This, though, occurred just before Hurricane Beryl came and then deviated from Tobago at the last minute. There were then numerous memes that “thank goodness for the peace pole or Tobago would have been badly hit”. July had the memes with the currants roll. It seems some guy, Nicolas Nuvan, was filming him trying out Caribbean foods and he tasted Trinidadian currants roll at a bakery. He mentioned that the Trini currants roll was moist, and currants rolls in Grenada were dry. A nearby Grenadian woman disputed this. The Trini woman who introduced Nicolas to the bakery then said “the currants roll was dry, honey”. “It was not dry.” “You wasn’t there, you didn’t make the currants roll.” This initiated a currants roll war of memes that even reached the Olympics. Comments like “All this flood and the Grenadian currants roll cyar find moisture”. In August we had the guy who was the driver in an accident and climbed into the passenger seat so others would presume he was not driving the car and, in any way, responsible for the accident. I think he said, “Whey the driver gone, boy.” The accident had just happened, though, and there was no time for anyone to have left the vehicle. Also, he seemed either high or drunk. August was also about this influencer, Zoe, some chick from England who was travelling through the Caribbean and is now living in Trinidad. She has made various videos (fairly X-rated) and also a song. Her next step probably is doing zess music. Social media has been reflecting on themselves since the talent of Zoe has been dubious, yet she has had numerous followers. And of course, in September, we had policeman Terrance. It seems Trinidad and Tobago is primed with persons who are eager to make humorous comments, stickers, videos, music, sketches. Primed with persons who will want to be the first to have something go viral. It all goes under the umbrella of “Trinidad is not a real place”. The explosive spread of the memes and stories is usually just to get kicks. The real reason, though—to give us a necessary break from the pressure-cooker intense mundanity of politics, crime, weather. It keeps us sane. —Dr Joanne F Paul is an emergency medicine lecturer with The UWI.","summary":"So up to now it is still difficult to gauge what causes something to go viral.

Robinson was the focus of an investigation by the network’s KFile unit on Thursday. A report published by CNN revealed an extensive history of comments made on a porn site called “Nude Africa” under an email address and username both known to be linked to him. The comments, which touched on a wide range of topics, were outrageous and shocking — in one, he apparently referred to himself as a “Black Nazi.” Though Robinson posted a video message on Thursday denying making the comments, he has faced calls from his fellow Republicans to prove that CNN defamed him with false information or drop out of the race. And over the weekend, his problems multiplied. A statement from the Robinson campaign Sunday afternoon indicated that his entire senior staff had resigned. WUNC further reported that the resignations were much deeper than the statement admitted. According to the news outlet, just three paid staffers remain employed by the Robinson campaign as of Sunday evening. Robinson has denied that he would drop out of the race and accused Democrats of manufacturing the allegations. But conservative operatives tuned into the race reacted to the news not with surprise but with resignation this past week as many seemed to indicate that the lion’s share of the accusations had been circulating in private for months. He “has long been toast,” Doug Heye, a longtime Republican operative from North Carolina, told The Independent on Thursday via text message. He noted how the Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump’s campaign, was “very nervous about how [the story] impacts him.” The extent of Robinson’s reported comments was shocking by itself. Aside from his comments about racial demographics, which are reportedly quite extensive in their own right, the North Carolina Republican opined about loving porn involving transgender Americans, despite publicly being an opponent of transgender rights and same-sex marriage. There were also comments made by the Robinson-linked account describing the poster’s own sexual tendencies and even claiming a sexual relationship with his wife’s sister. Beyond that, the poster alleged to have spied on women and girls changing in a locker room without their knowledge or consent. Publication of CNN’s investigation was a nightmare scenario for Robinson, who was already trailing his opponent Josh Stein in the North Carolina gubernatorial race by the high single digits, according to most polling. Now, Trump’s campaign (which had endorsed him) is publicly backing away from him at the worst possible time; Trump himself did not invite Robinson to a rally in the state on Saturday, with reports indicating that his campaign knew the story was coming. North Carolina is a key battleground state in the presidential race as well that Trump won by less than two percentage points in 2020. Kamala Harris, who took over the top of the Democratic ticket in July, has shrunk her opponent’s lead to a similar margin in available polling since entering the race.","summary":"Robinson ‘down to just 3 staffers’ after mass resignations in wake of CNN report","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/mark-robinson-campaign-staff-quit-nc-b2617186.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2024/09/19/21/Mark-Robinson-appears-on-stage-at-the-Republican-National-Convention.00_00_46_12.Still002.jpg?width=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-22 23:42:46","author":"John Bowden","authors":["John Bowden"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.204},{"id":257032752,"title":"“Donald Trump Won’t Run in 2028 if He Loses the 2024 Election”","text":"Donald Trump said that he won’t run for president if he loses to Kamala Harris this cycle. “No I don’t,” Trump told Full Measure host Sharyl Attkisson, who asked him whether he would wage another White House bid if he is not successful. “That will be it.

The deal keeps federal agencies funded and staves off what could have been a government stoppage Oct. 1, the start of the new fiscal year. This move allows lawmakers to push a decision on future spending until after the November election. House Speaker Mike Johnson described the measure as \"bare bones,\" and only included funding extensions that are absolutely necessary. \"While this is not the solution any of us prefer, it is the most prudent path forward under the present circumstances,\" Johnson wrote in a letter to his colleagues. \"As history has taught and current polling affirms, shutting the government down less than 40 days from a fateful election would be an act of political malpractice.\" Negotiations repeatedly fell victim to partisan politics, including the defeat of a GOP-backed plan that linked government funding to states' ability to require voters to show proof of citizenship before casting a ballot. Despite being backed by conservatives, 14 Republicans voted against it. An immigration compromise fell victim to similar politics earlier this year when a bi-partisan plan to reshape border policy was ultimately defeated at the behest of former President and Republican party standard bearer Donald Trump who was not keen on any immigration policy agreement on immigration in an election year, fearing it would be perceived as a victory for Democrats. Most temporary spending bills fund agencies at current levels, but this stop-gap plan also included $231 million for additional funding for the Secret Service in the wake of recent security breaches surrounding Trump, put money into a disaster relief fund and assist with the upcoming presidential transition. Democratic leaders, including House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries and Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, praised the bi-partisan deal, saying it is \"free of cuts and poison pills,\" and predicted the measure would be adopted quickly when Johnson brings it to the floor this week.","summary":"Washington lawmakers reached a spending plan Sunday that will keep the government operating through December, avoiding a looming shutdown.","url":"https://www.upi.com/Top_News/US/2024/09/22/deal-averts-govt-shutdown/1351727044569/","image":"https://cdnph.upi.com/ph/st/th/1351727044569/2024/upi/f84b08de766d30c2ac5b9f30e60ea481/v1.2/Weekend-spending-deal-averts-government-shutdown.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-22 23:35:20","author":"Mark Moran","authors":["Mark Moran"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.055},{"id":257031970,"title":"Several Mark Robinson campaign staffers quit as fallout over online posts continues","text":"RALEIGH, N.C. (AP) — Several top staffers in North Carolina Republican Lt. Gov. Mark Robinson’s campaign for governor have quit their posts, marking more fallout from a CNN report outlining evidence that he made disturbing posts on a pornography website’s message board more than a decade ago. The campaign said in a news release Sunday that senior adviser Conrad Pogorzelski III, campaign manager Chris Rodriguez, the campaign’s finance director and a deputy campaign manager “have stepped down from their roles with the campaign.” Information on new campaign staffers would be forthcoming soon, the release said. “I appreciate the efforts of these team members who have made the difficult choice to step away from the campaign, and I wish them well in their future endeavors,” Robinson said in the release. Pogorzelski, who helped Robinson get elected lieutenant governor in 2020 in his first bid for public office and later became his chief of staff, said separately on Sunday that additional staffers also left the campaign, including the deputy finance director, two political directors and the director of operations. Pogorzelski, in a text, said that he “along with others from the campaign have left of our own accord.” The CNN report on Thursday unearthed past posts it said Robinson left on a porn site’s message boards in which he referred to himself as a “black NAZI;” said he enjoyed transgender pornography; said in 2012 he preferred Hitler to then-President Barack Obama; and slammed the late Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. as “worse than a maggot.” Robinson denied writing the posts and said Thursday that he wouldn’t be forced out of the race by “salacious tabloid lies.” He avoided directly discussing the controversy during a gubernatorial campaign event on Saturday evening at a race track in Fayetteville. The event happened after earlier in the day former President Donald Trump didn’t mention Robinson at a rally about 90 miles (145 kilometers) away in Wilmington. Before Saturday, Robinson had been a frequent presence at Trump’s North Carolina campaign stops. The Republican presidential nominee has long praised Robinson — who would be North Carolina’s first Black governor if elected — calling him “Martin Luther King on steroids” for his speaking style. On Sunday, Robinson still expressed optimism that he could win in November over Democratic nominee Josh Stein, the sitting attorney general. Polls have shown Robinson trailing Stein. But Robinson said polls have “underestimated Republican support in North Carolina for several cycles,” and with a large portion of the electorate undecided “I am confident our campaign remains in a strong position to make our case to the voters and win on November 5.” Robinson has a long history of making inflammatory comments, including suggesting women who sought abortion “weren’t responsible enough to keep your skirt down” and comparing abortion to slavery. Stein said Sunday on CNN’s “State of the Union” that Robinson is “utterly unqualified, unfit to be the governor of North Carolina, and we’re going to do everything in our power to keep that from happening.” Polls show Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris locked in a close race in North Carolina and nationally. Democrats have seized on the opportunity to highlight Trump’s ties to Robinson, with billboards showing the two together and a new ad from Harris’ campaign highlighting the Republican candidates’ ties, as well as Robinson’s support for a statewide abortion ban without exceptions. On Sunday, Republican U.S. Sen. Lindsey Graham, of South Carolina, said on NBC’s “Meet the Press” that Robinson deserves a chance to defend himself against the allegations, which Graham described as “unnerving.” He said Robinson is “a political zombie if he does not offer a defense to this that’s credible,” while arguing the issue wouldn’t hurt Trump. “If they’re true, he’s unfit to serve for office,” Graham said of Robinson and the claims in the CNN report. “If they’re not true, he has the best lawsuit in the history of the country for libel.” Copyright 2024 The Associated Press.

The comments came in reaction to a Saturday speech where the former president claimed women’s lives had been improved by the end of the constitutional right to an abortion. “That’s just ludicrous,” Whitmer told CNN’s State of the Union on Sunday. “This guy just doesn’t understand what the average woman is confronting in her life in this country. How could he? He’s not lived a normal life.” “He’s just deranged,” Whitmer added. The Independent has contacted the Trump campaign for comment. At a rally in Wilmington, North Carolina, Trump claimed the 2022 Supreme Court ruling striking down Roe v. Wade was cause for celebration. “At long last this national nightmare that we’re going through will be over,” Trump said. “Women will be happy, healthy, confident and free. You will no longer be thinking about abortion because it is now where it always had to be, with the states.” The Harris campaign has underscored how Trump-appointed justices were key to the ruling ending Roe and the wave of abortion bans that followed in states around the country. “Women are being denied care during miscarriages, some only being treated once they develop sepsis,” Harris said this week, pointing to an example of a Georgia woman who died from the condition after her care was delayed. “And we know that women have died because of Trump abortion bans. I was with a mother and the two sisters of a woman who died because of Trump abortion bans just last night,” she added. JD Vance said in August that Trump would not sign a national abortion ban into law and would veto any such effort. “He said that explicitly that he would,” Vance said. “Donald Trump has been as clear about that as possible.” After the demise of Roe, 14 states banned abortion with few exceptions.","summary":"Comments came after Trump claimed end of Roe v Wade meant women would ‘no longer be thinking about abortion’","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/gretchen-whitmer-donald-trump-abortion-deranged-b2617121.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2024/08/05/05/US_China_Business_05032.jpg?width=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/Xc45yv1I-4VHSaSK0.mp4","publish_date":"2024-09-22 23:25:31","author":"Josh Marcus","authors":["Josh Marcus"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.379},{"id":257031054,"title":"Newspaper headlines: ‘Labour war on tax cheats’ and winter fuel ‘revolt’","text":"Stories looking ahead to the chancellor’s party conference speech dominate a number of the front pages on Monday. The Times says Rachel Reeves will use her address to praise the country’s “immense potential” and “offer a more positive version of the future” after a host of dire warnings about the state of the economy since winning power. A new crackdown on tax dodgers is the top story for the Daily Mirror. It reports on the chancellor’s plan to close the gap between how much tax is owed and how much is collected – it says the £39.8 billion shortfall will be recovered with the help of a newly set up taskforce. The i leads with a warning to the chancellor to keep public spending under control to avoid returning to austerity. Labour’s West Yorkshire Mayor Tracy Brabin told the paper “we’ve been here before, we’ve seen this movie”. The Daily Express reports that retired members of Unite will try to force a U-turn on the decision to scrap winter fuel payments by protesting at the second day of Labour’s conference in Liverpool. The Guardian’s top story reveals the chancellor has launched an investigation into £600m worth of Covid contracts awarded under the previous Conservative government. It says that Reeves will refer more than half the contracts for material goods such as masks to a newly-appointed Covid corruption commissioner. The Metro leads with a take on the first day of the Labour Party Conference. It writes that Deputy Prime Minister Angela Rayner “seemed close to tears” during her speech that came as she and other senior members have been embroiled in a freebies row. Leading The Daily Telegraph is a story saying Reeves will use her conference address to argue that “tough decisions” will lead to economic growth, which the broadsheet writes “will further raise fears of a raft of tax rises” in the forthcoming budget. The FT leads with a plea from steelmakers. It reports the price of European steel has been driven below the cost of production because of a surge in Chinese steel exports. Producers and trade bodies have told the paper that a new tarriff system was needed to cope with “the market-distorting effects of global overcapacity” in the industry. The Daily Mail reports that Angela Rayner has hired a “vanity photographer” on a £68,000 salary. It claims that although it is standard practice for the government to employ a photographer for the prime minister, Rayner is the first deputy PM to get her own. The return of Strictly Come Dancing leads The Sun, which reports that Saturday’s show registered the lowest ever viewing figures for a series-opening live show since the programme began. “The future is orange” is the headline for the Daily Star. It reports on Donald Trump’s comments that he will “colonise Mars” with Elon Musk if he wins the US presidential election. Sign up for our morning newsletter and get BBC News in your inbox.

The campaign’s comment did not link the staff departures to the bombshell CNN report alleging Robinson, a Republican, made antisemitic and racist comments years ago on a porn website, and it did not say why the staffers were stepping down. The campaign said the staff members who stepped down are Chris Rodriguez, campaign manager; Heather Whillier, finance director; Jason Rizk, deputy campaign manager; and Conrad Pogorzelski III, general consultant and senior adviser. “I appreciate the efforts of these team members who have made the difficult choice to step away from the campaign, and I wish them well in their future endeavors. I look forward to announcing new staff roles in the coming days,” Robinson said in a statement. He added that he is “confident our campaign remains in a strong position to make our case to the voters and win on November 5.” Robinson has denied the allegations in the CNN report and vowed to stay in the race. Some Republican lawmakers have expressed concern over the allegations, but the North Carolina Republican Party emphasized in a statement shortly after the story was published that Robinson “has categorically denied the allegations.” Democrats have sought to link Robinson to former President Donald Trump, releasing new advertisements highlighting Trump’s previous praise for Robinson, who is North Carolina’s lieutenant governor. Trump endorsed Robinson in the governor’s race and said he has no plans to withdraw his support. Democrats see North Carolina as a state that can possibly be flipped in the presidential race. They have unleashed resources on the state after Trump won it in 2020 by a narrow margin. Polls indicate that the race remains tight. Trump’s running mate, Sen. JD Vance of Ohio, has said it would be “very hard” for his ticket to win the presidential race without North Carolina.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nFour top staff members of Mark Robinson&#8217;s campaign for North Carolina governor&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Four members of Mark Robinson&#8217;s team resign from struggling campaign first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/news/us/four-members-of-mark-robinsons-team-resign-from-struggling-campaign/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/rewrite-this-title-Four-Mark-Robinson-staffers-step-down-from.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-22 23:08:12","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.219},{"id":257030412,"title":"Lindsey Graham gives take on ‘beyond unnerving’ allegations against NC pol Mark Robinson","text":"Sen. Lindsey Graham on Sunday said he is shocked by the “beyond unnerving” accusations against neighboring North Carolina gubernatorial hopeful and fellow GOPer Mark Robinson. “If they’re true, he’s unfit to serve for office,” the South Carolina pol bluntly told NBC’s “Meet the Press.” “If they’re not true, he has the best lawsuit in the history of the country for libel.” Last week, Robinson, North Carolina’s first black lieutenant governor in the swing presidential state, denied a story from CNN claiming he made incendiary sexual and racially charged posts in the message board of the porn site Nude Africa between 2008 and 2012. Among the litany of claims were accusations that Robinson fashioned himself as a “Black Nazi,” said, “Slavery is not bad…I wish they would bring it back” and recalled “peeping” in on women the shower of a gym when he was a teenager. Robinson blasted the report as “salacious tabloid trash” in a firm denial. “Let me reassure you, the things that you will see in that story, those are not the words of Mark Robinson,” he said, vowing to stay in the race. Many top Republicans have echoed Graham’s sentiment that these are merely accusations against Robinson. But Graham also added, “He needs to do more, in my view. “He has a right to defend himself. He has an obligation to defend himself. This is hanging over his campaign. He’s a political zombie if he does not offer a defense to this that’s credible.” Republican vice presidential hopeful JD Vance, asked by an NBC reporter about the scandal, said of Robinson, “I don’t believe him, I don’t not believe him. “I just think that you have to sometimes let these things play out in the court of public opinion,” Vance said. The bombshell story rocked Republicans in North Carolina, where Robinson has long been trailing in the contest for governor. North Carolina is widely seen as one of the top seven battleground states in the presidential contest. The state last backed a Democrat in 2008. Former President Donald Trump has a threadbare lead of about 0.1 percentage points in the latest RealClearPolitics aggregate of a two-way race between him and Veep and Democratic foe Kamala Harris. Robinson is trailing Noth Carolina Attorney General Josh Stein by 9.4 points, according to the latest RCP average. Stein has publicly doubted Robinson’s denial. “If you look at what he said on the posts, it was in keeping on what he has said publicly on Facebook that are still on his Facebook page,” Stein told CNN’s “State of the Union” on Sunday. “Mark Robinson is absolutely unfit to be the governor of North Carolina,” he continued. “Mark Robinson could not exist without the support of Donald Trump.” Incumbent North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper (D), is term-limited, which had raised Republican hopes ahead of the election that they could flip the governor’s office red. Democrats have rejoiced over the scandal engulfing Robinson. “It’s great news for Democrats,” Sen. John Fetterman (D-Pa.) told NBC’s “Meet the Press” on Sunday. “I mean, Robinson is actually, he’s the new dream candidate to run against.”","summary":"\"He's a political zombie if he does not offer a defense to this that's credible,'' Graham said of Robinson.","url":"https://nypost.com/2024/09/22/us-news/lindsey-graham-gives-take-on-allegations-against-mark-robinson/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/09/sen-lindsey-graham-says-embattled-90225516.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/l0Ig0r8V-RyIcpnTz.mp4","publish_date":"2024-09-22 23:04:48","author":"Ryan King","authors":["Ryan King"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.321},{"id":257030484,"title":"Pandemic fallouts","text":"AP/THE CONVERSATION – Kansas in the United States (US) faces the worst teacher shortfall in its history. The 4,000 teaching vacancies Florida faces as the new school year approaches “is more than the population of teachers in 19 of Florida’s smallest counties combined”, the state’s teachers union says. In Vermont, there are days when whole grades of students are sent home because there’s no teacher or sub available. The teaching profession faces a morale – and staffing – crisis. A National Education Association survey of members found that, as of late 2022, a staggering 55 per cent of educators were thinking of calling it quits. This is a legacy of COVID-19. Teachers were already unhappy before the pandemic, but the public’s reaction to the education their kids got during that crisis continues to haunt the profession. A Brown University study found teachers’ job satisfaction in 2022 hovered near its lowest level since the 1970s. As a researcher focused on education policy, along with my colleague Sara Dahill-Brown, we spent the pandemic researching how teachers felt as events unfolded. Between 2020 and 2022, we interviewed 164 leaders of teachers unions and associations from 14 states and 45 schools. They represented urban, suburban and rural districts and an array of partisan leanings. The results, published in our new study in Teaching and Teacher Education, show how damaging the pandemic was for K-12 teachers. Thousands subsequently left the profession. COVID-19 RESPONSE ERODES TEACHERS’ SENSE OF SAFETY Many teachers were already worried about security because of school shootings. With COVID-19, those fears were compounded by the public’s demand for a fast return to in-person class before public health officials deemed it safe and before money flowed to put best practices in place. In the summer of 2020, most teacher leaders told us they were “terrified” and “scared to death” because there was “no established criteria or expectations. It was just jump into the deep and do your best”. Vaccines and other scientific developments eased that particular anxiety, but as recently as April 2023, nearly four in 10 teachers told researchers they were considering looking for another job because they didn’t feel safe at work. AN INTENSE AND UNRELENTING WORKLOAD Throughout the 2020-21 school year, parents balanced jobs with children sitting – or running and yelling – alongside them for “Zoom school”. Teachers found themselves with two jobs, thanks to hybrid models in which they taught in person for some students and via videoconference for others. According to one respondent, they were “expected to teach students in person, but also deliver a meaningful education experience to those same students when they were at home”. Another shared that “teachers were working many, many, many more hours than they had ever put into a face-to-face environment”, clocking “12 to 16 hours a day and weekends” and providing feedback “until 10 o’clock at night”. The result was exhaustion that one leader described as “June-tired in October”. And that was merely an unusual bump in their already intense workloads; teachers in nonpandemic times typically work 53 hours per week on average. That’s seven more hours than the average working adult. LACKLUSTER LEADERSHIP AND CHANGING EXPECTATIONS The pandemic also exacerbated festering dissatisfaction with school and district leadership. Teachers felt misled, ill-informed and unconsidered. They were rarely asked for input and forced to make radical changes to education, respondents told us. Teachers wanted “consistency”, “straight answers” and to stop “switching on a dime”, they told us. Plans changed so frequently that one said “an email written on Monday” was “stale by Wednesday”. Another said administrators would say “the right things in public” to signal “compassion and care for teachers. But the actions are different. And it’s really taking a toll on teachers”. One union leader told us: “You see parents’ comments on social media, there are a lot more of ‘You just need to shut up and get back to the classroom. You’re lazy. You’re not doing your job’.” Another echoed this: “Historically educators have been an under-respected profession. But it’s much, much worse now. It’s not just that they’re disrespected, they’re villainised.” JOBS AND BUDGET CUTS RAISE NEW FEARS The majority (68 per cent) of study respondents were concerned from early in the pandemic about budgets or job security. Forty per cent feared enrollment losses related to COVID-19 would make those worries worse. And many worried that “schools don’t have the budget to do all of the safety procedures that science tells us is necessary”. All of this persisted even as Congress, in April 2020, set aside more than USD13 billion for K-12 emergency relief. By the end of 2020, then-US president Donald Trump pledged USD50 billion more to help schools reopen. These funds did hold off catastrophic cuts, but researchers and policymakers both warned of a fiscal cliff facing districts if they didn’t prepare for the point at which that spigot would run dry. And, indeed, examples now abound of just that reality, as seen by mass job cuts in St Paul, Minnesota, Houston and Ann Arbor, Michigan, among others. With the worst of the pandemic behind us, resources are being reduced despite ongoing needs. This recipe – burned-out teachers quitting and some who chose to stay being fired – has the entire profession reeling. AVENUES FOR BOOSTING MORALE There are several ways to boost morale, but most require more investment, not less. Teachers say they need better pay – to the tune of a minimum starting salary of USD60,000 a year – along with stability in health and retirement benefits. The National Education Association said the average starting salary now is USD44,530. The NEA is also advocating for better conditions for the paraprofessionals who assist them in the classrooms. And teachers want more say in what they teach. Short of these changes, we don’t see school systems being able to stop the exodus of educators from the profession – and they will continue to lose their best and brightest as a result. – Lesley Lavery","summary":"","url":"https://borneobulletin.com.bn/pandemic-fallouts/","image":"https://borneobulletin.com.bn/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/page-21-a_23092024.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-22 23:04:30","author":null,"language":"en","catgory":"business","source_country":"bn","sentiment":-0.001},{"id":257030874,"title":"Why preserving presidential papers at the National Archives is critical","text":"Before classified documents were found at the homes of President Biden and former President Donald Trump, most people only knew of the National Archives because of the movie \"National Treasure.\" Both men held onto records when they left the vice presidency and presidency, respectively, that should have been sent to the National Archives. Keeping documents from the public impedes historians, oversight entities, and the American people from understanding history, Deputy Archivist Jay Bosanko, who runs day-to-day operations at the National Archives, said. \"When an individual controls the records, they control the story,\" Bosanko said. \"They control what the American people can know or not know about their presidency.\"Watergate and presidential recordsRecords used to belong to the presidents who created them until after the Watergate scandal, when burglars tied to then-President Richard Nixon's campaign committee broke into Democratic Party headquarters at the Watergate office building. In the aftermath of the 1972 incident, when President Nixon sought to have audio tapes holding evidence of potential crimes destroyed, Congress acted to protect presidential records. The Presidential Records Act was signed into law in 1978. The act also governs the official records of vice presidents.The National Archives: a small agency with a big responsibility safeguarding American and world history\"Starting with President Reagan, now the records of a presidency belong to the American people and not to the president,\" Bosanko said. Trump, Biden and presidential recordsTrump tested the law in 2021 when he took dozens of boxes of presidential papers, including almost 340 documents bearing classification markings, to his home in Florida. Trump was eventually charged with 40 felonies, including for allegedly refusing to turn over some of the papers.The case was dismissed this past July, but the Justice Department is appealing. Biden was also investigated over more than 80 documents with classification markings that he had, from when he was vice president and a senator. He cooperated with the investigation and was not charged.Jay Bosanko said that the National Archives are simply custodians of the records all presidents are required to turn over, and that enforcing the law is up to the Justice Department.Deputy Archivist Bosanko explained what he thinks is lost when presidential records are not transferred at the end of an administration.\"That strikes at the very heart of the historical record, the completeness of it, the ability to understand decisions,\" Bosanko said. \"And so it's important for historians, and ultimately the American people to understand all of the pieces that came in and made up that decision making.\"Public access to federal records Those pieces of history start to become available to reporters and scholars at the 15 presidential libraries in the National Archives system five years after a presidency ends. \"When that five-year window hits, almost immediately we have a backlog of thousands of FOIA requests that we can't possibly respond to within the 10 days under the Freedom of Information Act,\" Bosanko said. When Archivist Colleen Shogan was sworn in last year, she inherited a flat budget and a mountain of FOIA requests. At the George W.

After former President Donald Trump and then-Vice President Biden held on to records when they left office that should have been sent to the Archives… we wanted to know more… about the small federal agency in charge of safeguarding America's past.After a few months inside, we came to appreciate that the Archives are the country's safety deposit box, reading room, and paper shredder rolled into one.At the heart of the institution are the documents that have been at the heart of the nation, for nearly 250 years.Colleen Shogan: (footsteps) There's 39 steps here that lead up to the entrance. And that's 39 framers who signed the Constitution.Norah O'Donnell: Oh, wow. Look at this.Colleen Shogan, the archivist of the United States, is responsible for America's records. The main attractions are in a building in Washington that was inspired by ancient Rome, and built to be a temple to history.Each year, more than a million people make the trip to see these national treasures in person.Norah O'Donnell: This building, the Rotunda, was built as a shrine for many of these documents. But they didn't arrive until later.Colleen Shogan: That's correct. The building was completed in 1937. But the Declaration and the Constitution did not arrive till 1952. They were in the possession of the Library of Congress, which refused to turn them over, until President Truman got involved...and they were delivered from Capitol Hill by the U.S. military.Norah O'Donnell: Ah, the Declaration of Independence.Colleen Shogan: Yes. Norah O'Donnell: Why is it so faded?Colleen Shogan: It was exposed to considerable light and the elements. In the 19th Century, the U.S. Patent office put the declaration on display near a window. that and other missteps did so much damage, nearly all you can make out today is John Hancock's \"John Hancock.\"To preserve them, these original documents that are a beacon for democracy are now intentionally kept in the dark. They are guarded around the clock, in bulletproof cases designed to remain sealed for 100 years.All federal employees are required to take an oath to defend the Constitution. But for Colleen Shogan, it's literally her job – and the founding documents are just the start.Colleen Shogan: We have approximately 13.5 billion paper records here at the National Archives.Norah O'Donnell: How many feet of film?Colleen Shogan: Oh, the film would go around the globe three and a half times.Norah O'Donnell: How many photographs?Colleen Shogan: We have millions and millions of photographs as well. Norah O'Donnell: And how many artifacts?Colleen Shogan: Over 700,000 artifacts.Most of that massive collection is kept outside of Washington, stored at dozens of facilities all across the country that span millions of cubic feet, including four underground cave complexes in the Midwest.Colleen Shogan: For our civilian records center in Valmeyer, Illinois, our archivists actually use bikes (laugh) because it's about a mile from one end of the facility to the other. Then there's the stuff they don't even keep – only about 3% of government paperwork is deemed important enough to preserve for posterity. Documents can sit for years before being retained or more likely, destroyed. At the Washington National Records Center outside DC, there are 20 football fields of files, stacked floor to ceiling, awaiting their fate.Until 1934, federal agencies stored their own records, with varying degrees of success. When the Archives was created, work began to restore 158 years' worth of dusty, forgotten documents.To see how some of America's oldest paper records have held up, we met Trevor Plante, who is in charge of more than two billion written documents in Washington.Norah O'Donnell: So this is original from 1778?Trevor Plante: Yes. During the Revolutionary War, the Continental Congress wanted George Washington and his officers to pledge allegiance in writing to their new nation, after they survived a brutal winter at Valley Forge.Trevor Plante: So the irony is that the Army can barely afford to feed them, clothe them, house them, supply them with arms and ammunition. But, like, \"here's all this paperwork we wanted filled-out and returned.\"Norah O'Donnell: And so that--Trevor Plante: So these--Norah O'Donnell: --is George Washington's handwriting and--Trevor Plante: Yes.Norah O'Donnell: --signature?Trevor Plante: Yes-- correct, yep. Yep. Norah O'Donnell: And then, here.Trevor Plante: This officer became very popular a couple years ago, Alexander Hamilton. We don't often think of him as \"Alex Hamilton,\" but he had signed his name \"Alex Hamilton\"--Norah O'Donnell: Wow.Trevor Plante: --on his oath.Trevor Plante has a theory about why one of his favorite documents looks so unique. Trevor Plante: This is a resolution-- passed by Congress in-- early 1865. It-- once it was ratified, it became the 13th Amendment to the Constitution. And if you notice on here, there's several different handwritings for the 13th Amendment. So we speculate that these clerks realized what a big deal this was at-- at the time, and literally wanted to have a hand in history. Norah O'Donnell: Because the 13th Amendment abolished slavery.Trevor Plante: Abolished slavery in the United States, exactly.Plante likes to say Archives keeps the nation's receipts, and he means it – like the treaty for the Louisiana Purchase –– signed by Napoleon Bonaparte himself.There's also the deed of gift that came with the Statue of Liberty from France in 1884.And the check Russia cashed when the U.S. bought Alaska in 1867 for $7.2 million.In 1988, after Archives' main building in Washington ran out of room, Congress funded the construction of a state-of-the-art facility in College Park, Maryland.From there, Deputy Archivist Jay Bosanko runs day-to-day operations.He invited us into their most restricted vault, where cameras usually aren't allowed, to see relics of a dark chapter in world history – Hitler's last will and testament; and Eva Braun's diary.Jay Bosanko: This happens to be from 1935.Norah O'Donnell: How is it that the U.S. government got its hands on Hitler's mistress's diary?Jay Bosanko: So this was-- quite literally sort of the-- the-- the spoils of war. This was captured-- by U.S. Armed Forces. Then it transferred to us at the National Archives.Some of the items inside this vault only became historically significant with age, like this letter from a young Fidel Castro to President Franklin D. Roosevelt.Norah O'Donnell: So there may be treasures like this buried in boxes--Jay Bosanko: Yet--Norah O'Donnell: --in lots of places.Jay Bosanko: --yet to be discovered. You never know when you're opening a box what you might find next.… or who might be opening it. Researchers, writers, and history buffs from around the country and the world come to the archives to make discoveries. We saw a group from Japan cataloging the American occupation that followed World War II.And a U.S. Army unit on a special mission - combing through a million old Army files looking for Black and Native American soldiers, who were once overlooked, but might now be awarded the Medal of Honor.Jay Bosanko: The records that we hold-- need to be made available. We need to bring the stories that are captured in those records alive.Norah O'Donnell: There's a record here at College Park that I want to show you and our viewers. This is the resignation letter of Richard Nixon, August 9th, 1974. Jay Bosanko: This is an incredibly important document.Before the Watergate scandal, records belonged to the presidents who created them. But after President Nixon sought to destroy audio tapes with evidence of potential crimes, Congress took action.Jay Bosanko: When an individual controls the records, they control the story, they control what the American people can know or not know about their presidency.Norah O'Donnell: When did individual presidents stop owning the records that they created?Jay Bosanko: Not until 1978 when the Presidential Records Act was signed. And so starting with President Reagan, now the records of a presidency belong to the American people and not to the president.In 2021, former President Trump tested that law when he took dozens of boxes, including almost 340 documents bearing classification markings, to his home in Florida. Mr. Trump was eventually charged with 40 felonies, including for allegedly refusing to turn over some of the papers. The case was dismissed, but the Justice Department is appealing. President Joe Biden was also investigated over more than 80 documents with classification markings that he had from when he was vice president and a senator. Mr. Biden cooperated with the investigation and was not charged.Jay Bosanko told us the Archives is simply the custodian of the documents all presidents are required to turn over. Enforcing the law is up to the Justice Department.Norah O'Donnell: What is potentially lost when presidential records are not transferred to the National Archives?Jay Bosanko: That strikes at the very heart of-- the historical record, the completeness of it, the ability to understand decisions. And so it's important for historians, and ultimately the American people to understand all of the pieces that came in and-- and made up that decision-making.Those pieces of history start to become available to reporters and scholars five years after a presidency ends, at the 15 presidential libraries in the Archives system.Jay Bosanko: When that five-year window hits, almost immediately we have a backlog of thousands of FOIA requests that we can't possibly respond to within the ten days under the Freedom of Information Act.When Colleen Shogan became archivist last year she inherited a flat budget, and a mountain of Freedom of Information Act requests.Norah O'Donnell: At the George W. Bush Presidential Library, for example, a FOIA request might come back with a 12-year wait.Colleen Shogan: Uh-huh (affirm). That's because of the-- the-- the-- the extreme interest in those records. And I think the way that we are gonna make headway on this in the near future is going to be through technology.The Archives' goal to scan and digitize all 13-and-a-half billion paper records in its collection seems ambitious. Only 2% of their holdings are currently available online. We obtained a recent memo drafted by senior leaders at the agency, who are concerned limited resources have put it at \"serious risk\" of \"mission failure.\"Norah O'Donnell: Is it even possible to bring the Archives into the 21st century before the start of the 22nd century without some significant increase of resources?Colleen Shogan: I think we can do it. We will do it-- we'll-- gonna have to reprioritize, we're gonna have to look at our budget. But we will rely upon our institutions, upon Congress, and of course upon the executive branch to support us along the way.While the Archives' path to digital transformation will be a work in progress for decades, a big change is coming soon to the rotunda. In 2026, the Emancipation Proclamation and the 19th Amendment will be put on permanent display. They are the first major additions to the rotunda in 72 years. It was the archivist's decision. She says it's not just to honor the nation's past, but a reminder that America's next chapter is not yet written. Produced by Keith Sharman and Roxanne Feitel. Broadcast associate, Callie Teitelbaum.

Her pursuit of big business represents a policy shift after a decades-long FTC hands-off approach allowing most mergers and acquisitions. Under President Biden, however, the FTC and Justice Department have unleashed a crackdown and sued scores of big companies, including TicketMaster, Nvidia, Meta, Microsoft, Apple and Amazon. Some worry going after tech giants could have a domino effect, destabilizing the economy.\"But we also should worry about the destabilizing effect that can arise from companies believing that they're above the law, and they can be reckless, take massive risks in ways that can crash the economy and then they can get away with just a slap on the wrist,\" Khan said in a recent 60 Minutes interview with correspondent Lesley Stahl. \"And that creates a destabilization, too.\"The shift in antitrust policyThe Federal Trade Commission was established to protect consumers and promote competition between businesses.Since President Ronald Regan's time in the White House, antitrust regulators have done little to interfere in many mergers and acquisitions. It was a policy adopted by all presidents since then, including former Presidents Bill Clinton and Barack Obama. Then President Biden put an end to it. FTC trustbuster Lina Khan: feared in boardrooms, cheered on by progressives - and even some MAGA Republicans\"We are now 40 years into the experiment of letting giant corporations accumulate more and more power, and what have we gotten from it? Less growth, weakened investment, fewer small businesses,\" Mr. Biden said in 2021 — the same year he appointed Khan to the FTC. It's a revolution and Khan is its face. While still a law student, she wrote a paper for the Yale Law Journal called \"Amazon's Antitrust Paradox,\" contending that even though its prices are low, Amazon is still a monopoly. Less than five years later, President Biden made Khan, 32 at the time, head of the agency that polices Amazon. Taking on the Big Five tech companiesLast year, the Federal Trade Commission and 17 state attorneys general filed an antitrust case against Amazon, alleging the retailing giant illegally wields monopoly power to maintain higher prices, hurting customers and weakening competition.\"Our investigation uncovered that Amazon's illegal practices were actually raising prices for consumers because it had illegally muscled out rivals, locked them out of the market in ways that if you had more competition that Amazon hadn't squashed, consumers would be even better off,\" Khan told 60 Minutes. Amazon denies doing anything illegal and says if Khan wins, prices will go up.Khan and the FTC have blocked, or tried to block, a number of Silicon Valley's big companies from buying smaller companies. \"In the technology markets, we went through a couple of decades where we saw over 800 acquisitions by the five big players, not a single one of which was blocked. And some of those we realize ended up leading to significant harm,\" Khan said. Khan said the FTC has identified a string of mergers that were not blocked or challenged by previous FTC administrations, even though the current FTC under her leadership — and operating under Biden's mandate — believe they are illegal.Confronting pushback from companies The courts don't always side with the FTC, and Khan lost a couple of big cases, including one against Microsoft and another against Meta.While Khan is feared and loathed in many corporate boardrooms, and even viewed by some as a zealot and a bully, she says the FTC is doing its job by enforcing the law, adding that of the thousands of deals proposed every year, the FTC and DOJ collectively investigate \"maybe 2% or 3%.\"That might not sound like a lot, but startup founders complain that she's spooking investors so much that she's stifling innovation. Others fear Khan chasing the tech giants will cause a domino effect. Earlier this month, the stock market plunged after it was reported that Khan's counterpart at the Justice Department subpoenaed chip maker Nvidia.Khan is also facing lawsuits from corporations who want the FTC to be reined in, setting up a possible showdown at the Supreme Court over the fate of the agency.\"I think one challenge that agencies can face is when they shrink their own powers and authorities by not actually using the authorities that Congress has given them,\" Khan said.Khan's fans — both liberals and conservativesEven while dealing with pushback, Khan has fervent admirers. She attends events around the country that she calls her \"listening tours.\" She's often swarmed by young people taking selfies, small business owners giving her cards, progressive politicians and union members. She's also surprisingly popular with some MAGA Republicans. Sen. JD Vance, the Republican nominee for vice president, has expressed some admiration for Khan. \"I don't agree with Lina Khan on every issue, to be clear, but I think that she's been very smart about trying to go after some of these big tech companies,\" he previously said.There's even a nickname for conservatives who support Khan: Khan-servatives. Still, Khan is unlikely to keep her job if former President Donald Trump wins the election. It's also unclear if Khan would keep her job if Vice President Kamala Harris wins. Some of Harris' biggest donors are people who want Khan out of the FTC. \"My focus is not listening to what CEOs are saying on TV,\" Khan said. \"It's important in these jobs to really stay focused and block out a lot of the noise.\"","summary":"Federal Trade Commission Chair Lina Khan has gone after some of the biggest companies in the U.S. Under President Biden, the FTC has cracked down on big companies they say are hurting consumers.","url":"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/federal-trade-commission-lina-khan-60-minutes/","image":"https://assets1.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2024/09/22/95c757d8-8cee-4844-9656-43a591702e2b/thumbnail/1200x630/03607233944f28ec876a25167d048397/lina-khan-article1.jpg?v=159d4576ec63c034c87559bf5085176a","video":"https://prod.vodvideo.cbsnews.com/cbsnews/vr/hls/2024/09/22/2374307395936/3212896_hls/master.m3u8","publish_date":"2024-09-22 23:00:31","author":"Aliza Chasan,Lesley Stahl","authors":["Aliza Chasan","Lesley Stahl"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.042},{"id":257030892,"title":"U.S. \"losing a generation\" to deadly fentanyl, DEA head says","text":"We are in the midst of the worst drug crisis in U.S. history. The drug is fentanyl, and unlike cocaine and heroin, it's a purely chemical, man-made drug. It's cheap to produce, easily smuggled, and packs an incredibly addictive punch – 50 times more powerful than heroin. Nearly all the fentanyl flooding into the U.S. is made in Mexico by two powerful drug cartels, with chemicals primarily purchased from China. And as you're about to hear, it is frequently hidden in counterfeit pills made to look just like prescription drugs. It's the scourge of our time. Last year more than 70,000 Americans died from fentanyl; that's a higher death toll than U.S. military casualties in Vietnam, Iraq and Afghanistan combined.Angela King: We were so naive to fentanyl. We thought fentanyl, you hear about it, but you think 'Oh that's just affecting people on the streets, homeless people, drug addicts.' No. It is so insidious.Angela King and Mike O'Kelley lost their 20-year-old son, Jack, to fentanyl last Thanksgiving. A junior at the University of Georgia, Jack had come home for the long weekend and was out late partying.What's fueling the fentanyl crisis is \"not a whodunit,\" but \"there's so much more that needs to be done,\" DEA leader saysMike O'Kelley: He was at a friend's house. So I had gone to bed a little worried.The next morning he couldn't reach Jack, so he used \"Find My iPhone.\"Mike O'Kelley: I could see where he was. I texted the mother of the house who basically sent me a message back, 'Oh, we're not there. Door's unlocked. They're asleep.'At eleven o'clock Thanksgiving morning, Mike went upstairs and found his son in bed… unresponsive. Mike O'Kelley: I noticed his chest wasn't moving. So immediately pulled him out of the bed. Had, had performed CPR for 30-plus minutes.Angela King: Mike called me and, screaming in the phone, \"Jack's gone. Jack's gone.\" And I immediately rushed over there with one of our children. And the EMT had arrived and was working on Jack upstairs. And it was the most horrific, traumatic -- there's, there's not words.Jack O'Kelley was captain of his high school football and lacrosse teams. He was studying business at Georgia, and was a popular member of his fraternity.Bill Whitaker: Have you been able to piece together why take a pill? Was this his first time?Angela King: I think he was just out having a good time and making, made a stupid mistake.Mike O'Kelley: You know, the experimental days of taking drugs in college are over. They're all-- you know, all the pills are laced with fentanyl. \"They die too quickly:\" Reversing a fentanyl overdose with naloxoneMike and Angela found text messages between Jack and a drug dealer. He bought what he thought was Xanax, Oxycodone, and a gram of cocaine. But the death certificate states fentanyl was the cause of death.Mike O'Kelley: He wasn't seeking fentanyl.Angela King: He made a really bad decision. Not one that should have taken his life, though.Bill Whitaker: Sounds like you've had a crash course in learning about fentanyl.Mike O'Kelley: Absolutely.Angela King: Absolutely. Which is shocking to me because at the rate that fentanyl is killing people in this country, it is absolutely ludicrous that this is not on the front page of every newspaper and every news broadcast daily.Fentanyl is a synthetic opioid – a chemical cousin to morphine – originally designed for hospital patients in extreme pain. Now it is in cities and towns in all 50 states. Frequent users heat up fentanyl powder and inhale it. But more often it's sold in pill form – deliberately made to look like real prescription drugs – the one on the left contains fentanyl. Just two milligrams, an amount that fits on the tip of a pencil, can kill. Anne Milgram: The cartels don't sell fentanyl as fentanyl. They hide it in other drugs like cocaine or methamphetamine or heroin. They make it into these fake pills that look identical to pharmaceutical drugs that Americans would recognize, like Oxy or Xanax, Percocet, Adderall. It will be a very massive high that is very short. And that person, they're betting if they survive, will come back again and again and again to buy more.Three years ago, Anne Milgram – a former attorney general of New Jersey – took over the Drug Enforcement Administration. Since then fentanyl has claimed more than 200,000 American lives, although deaths appear to be leveling off.Anne Milgram: Fentanyl is impacting every part of the United States. It's impacting our communities. It's impacting our kids. It's impacting our economy. One of the things that I've learned over the last few years that really stays with me is every single week we lose 22 teens between the ages of 14 and 18.Bill Whitaker: Every week.Anne Milgram: Every single week we're basically losing a high school class somewhere in America.She started putting pictures of people who died from fentanyl in the lobby of DEA headquarters, a daily reminder of the drug's catastrophic impact.Anne Milgram: We're losing a generation.Bill Whitaker: That's what this says.Anne Milgram: Yes. You can see it so clearly when you look, and you see Americans from all walks of life, all states, all communities, young and old, every background possible. We have folks in military uniforms, we've got babies.Bill Whitaker: Oh my God!Bill Whitaker: Someone who just picks up the pill that a parent dropped.Anne Milgram: Yes. The DEA is part of the Department of Justice and conducts intelligence gathering and counter-drug operations worldwide. Milgram oversees 10,000 employees.Anne Milgram: As complex and as massive a problem as this is, it's also not a whodunit. We know who's responsible. It's the Sinaloa Cartel and the Jalisco Cartel that are based in Mexico. They dominate and control the entire global fentanyl supply chain, starting in China, going to Mexico, coming into the United States.Milgram told us this crisis began 10 years ago… when the cartels started to wrestle control of the supply chain from China and began making fentanyl in clandestine labs in Mexico.Bill Whitaker: So these two drug cartels from our neighbor, from Mexico, are responsible for almost 70,000 American deaths a year?Anne Milgram: Yes.Bill Whitaker: How do you fight that?Anne Milgram: We've taken action over the last three years against every single part of that global supply chain, charging Chinese nationals with selling fentanyl precursors, charging and indicting, investigating, members of these cartels at every level and then finally taking hundreds of millions of deadly doses of fentanyl off American streets. And we are making progress but there's so much more that needs to be done.Troy Miller: The majority the fentanyl that we're seeing, about 90%-plus is coming in passenger vehicles.Commissioner Troy Miller, a 30-year veteran of U.S. Customs and Border Protection, told us almost all the fentanyl coming into the country is smuggled through legal ports of entry like here at San Ysidro, between San Diego and Tijuana. It's the busiest land port in the Western Hemisphere. Bill Whitaker: What percentage of the smuggled fentanyl do you think you are catching?Troy Miller: You know, Bill, I, I don't know what percentage we're, we're catching. But I can tell you we've seized 27,000 pounds of fentanyl in fiscal year of 2023.Miller took us for a bird's eye view to see the magnitude of the challenge.Troy Miller: So this, this is the wall. It comes right up to the port of entry and resumes here. That's Mexico. More than 60,000 cars snake through 34 lanes 24-7. Officers have a minute or less to decide who gets a second look, and they only have the resources to search 8% of the cars. Dogs trained to sniff out fentanyl are some of their best assets. The cartels are constantly adapting, for example, hiding pills in gas tanks to mask the scent.Troy Miller: So we're in the seizure vault...Commissioner Miller showed us rack after rack of seized drugs locked in this massive vault. For security reasons, we agreed not to divulge its location. Bill Whitaker: So explain to me why the smugglers would use the busiest port as their main smuggling route. I mean, it seems counterintuitive. Why not do it some place much less conspicuous? Why not come across the desert?Troy Miller: Well, in the San Diego field office, we're seeing 200,000 people a day. Every one of these 200,000 people is presenting themselves as a legitimate traveler. We were astonished to learn two-thirds of the people arrested smuggling fentanyl are American citizens paid by the cartels.Troy Miller: We've seen terrible trends. We've seen high school and middle schoolers smuggling fentanyl and dropping it off to a cartel member at a high school.Bill Whitaker: Do you have the budget and the manpower you need?Troy Miller: I've been very clear that Customs and Border Protection needs more officers. We need more agents. We need more intel research specialists to distill that information.We asked him about the bipartisan border bill killed by the Senate at the urging of former President Donald Trump. It would have provided 1,500 new border and customs officers and 100 high tech detection machines. Bill Whitaker: …The bill had money for much of the stuff you're talking about. Is the political inaction, is that costing lives? Troy Miller: Again what I can say is we need more resources to do our jobs. And we need to all get on the same page and tackle this together.Sherri Hobson saw the fentanyl crisis coming. As an assistant U.S. attorney in San Diego she prosecuted Mexican cartel cases for 30 years before retiring in 2020.Sherri Hobson: Cartels are very business-oriented. They look for profit. They look for perpetual power. They're institutionalized.Bill Whitaker: So it sounds like you're saying they're very sophisticated.Sherri Hobson: They are. They do their homework. They do their analysis. She says the cartels' move into fentanyl was entirely predictable. When the U.S. opioid crisis triggered a crackdown on the drug industry and many companies were sued by ravaged communities, the supply of legal opioids dried up – but the demand from Americans addicted to the drugs did not.Sherri Hobson: It's very strange to think that the pharmaceutical industry basically set the table for the Mexican cartels to come in and dominate.Bill Whitaker: That's, that's, that's incredible.Sherri Hobson: It is. So I think what happened was they said, \"You know what? We have an open market. We have millions of people that are addicted to Oxycodone. We can do fentanyl. We can create these counterfeit pills and we can, we can sell them.\"Bill Whitaker: So the Mexican cartels just filled this vacuum.Sherri Hobson: Filled the void, filled the vacuum.Anne Milgram: So the opioid epidemic definitely started this arc that we're on. The head of the DEA, Anne Milgram, agrees the U.S. drug industry bears a lot of blame for igniting the crisis, but says social media companies are fueling it today. The companies say they're taking steps to combat this.Anne Milgram: And what's happening on social media? The cartels use it to organize themselves to get individuals who will carry the drugs across the border from Mexico, to post ads for drugs, and to sell drugs. Whether it's SnapChat, Instagram, TikTok, there are drugs being sold there every single day. And seven out of 10 of those counterfeit pills the DEA tests have a potentially deadly dose of fentanyl. Angela King and Mike O'Kelley say that's information every American needs to know.Mike O'Kelley: It's a war. It's, it's a new drug war. And that drug war is totally different than anything we've ever dealt with before 'cause now we're losing our young ones. Whatever the government's trying to do, I'm glad they're doing something.

Kennedy Jr.’s supporters in the swing state of Nevada are nonplussed about his reported sexting scandal — and that’s good news for the presidential hopeful he’s backing, Donald Trump. Kennedy, 70, got top billing at a Trump-sponsored “Restore America” rally in Vegas on Saturday night, drawing a standing-room-only crowd who either didn’t care — or didn’t even know — about the bombshell allegation. “I’m not familiar with that particular issue. I am with a lot of issues, but that one’s new to me,” said local Ken Czech, who was wearing a “Kennedy 24” t-shirt, a nod to the Kennedy scion’s failed attempt to run for president in November on the independent ticket. Kennedy, 70, who is married to “Curb Your Enthusiasm” actress Cheryl Hines, 59, was allegedly involved in a newly revealed, seamy sexting relationship with New York magazine’s star political scribe Olivia Nuzzi, 31. Czech said he is more interested in Kennedy’s efforts to help Trump form a “unity party.’’ Retired Las Vegas court reporter Christine Johnson said reports of the scandal meant little to her, too. “I support RFK, and whatever his headlines are, they are,” she said of the politician, who threw his support behind Trump after backing out of the race. “People are going to put their own spin on it.” Charles Atwood Hightower, a retired US army sergeant first class and a contractor, said those criticizing Kennedy’s private life should “drop dead. “Your personal life is your personal life,” Hightower said. “God gave you that right.’’ Retired Judge Charles Weinberg slammed the sexting story as a joke. “I mean, there’s so much propaganda and false information out now. I think this guy’s a legit guy,’’ he said of Kennedy. Lawyer Gregory Brittain of Redlands, Cali., said that if the married Kennedy was “coming on to someone else, that would be inappropriate.” But “no one is perfect, and least of all the Democrats on the other side who do this, who, I was saying, the real racists and the real sexists are the Democrats who, who so strongly profess right, maybe for women and for the minorities,’’ Brittain said. The event, moderated by race-car driving personality Danica Patrick at a Las Vegas rec center, was Kennedy’s first public appearance since the scandal broke last week. He did not address it at the event. But he did wear his wedding ring, while Hines reportedly ditched hers for at least part of her Italian vacation at the same time. Former Rep. Tulsi Gabbard, an ex-Democrat from Hawaii, appeared with Kennedy at the rally for Trump, who faces an expected bruising battle against Democratic nominee and Vice President Kamala Harris. Gabbard told The Post it was the kind of “distraction” she expects will increase as Election Day draws near. “The elitist, permanent Washington establishment, the military-industrial complex, the national security state, this whole cabal of the power elite are so terrified of President Trump winning this election that they will continue to do what they have been doing for years and throw everything they possibly can at it,” she said. “I know that Bobby Kennedy is focused, as I am, on saving our country,’’ Gabbard said. “President Trump is focused on his mission of saving our country, and none of us are going to allow any of these distractions to get in the way.”","summary":"LAS VEGAS — Robert F.

Lawmakers have struggled to get to this point as the current budget year winds to a close at month’s end. At the urging of the most conservative members of his conference, House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., had linked temporary funding with a mandate that would have compelled states to require proof of citizenship when people register to vote. But Johnson could not get all Republicans on board even as the party’s presidential nominee, Donald Trump, insisted on that package. Trump said Republican lawmakers should not support a stop-gap measure without the voting requirement, but the bill went down to defeat anyway, with 14 Republicans opposing it. Bipartisan negotiations began in earnest shortly after that, with leadership agreeing to extend funding into mid-December. That gives the current Congress the ability to fashion a full-year spending bill after the Nov. 5 election, rather than push that responsibility to the next Congress and president. In a letter to Republican colleagues, Johnson said the budget measure would be “very narrow, bare-bones” and include “only the extensions that are absolutely necessary.” “While this is not the solution any of us prefer, it is the most prudent path forward under the present circumstances,” Johnson wrote. “As history has taught and current polling affirms, shutting the government down less than 40 days from a fateful election would be an act of political malpractice.” House Democratic leader Hakeem Jeffries said Democrats would evaluate the bill in its entirety before this week’s vote, but with the agreement, “Congress is now on a bipartisan path to avoid a government shutdown that would hurt everyday Americans.” Rep. Tom Cole, the House Appropriations Committee chairman, had said on Friday that talks were going well. “So far, nothing has come up that we can’t deal with,” said Cole, R-Okla. “Most people don’t want a government shutdown and they don’t want that to interfere with the election. So nobody is like, ‘I’ve got to have this or we’re walking.’ It’s just not that way.” Johnson’s earlier effort had no chance in the Democratic-controlled Senate and was opposed by the White House, but it did give the speaker a chance to show Trump and conservatives within his conference that he fought for their request. The final result — government funding effectively on autopilot — was what many had predicted. With the election just weeks away, few lawmakers in either party had any appetite for the brinksmanship that often leads to a shutdown. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer said the same agreement could have been reached two weeks ago, but “Speaker Johnson chose to follow the MAGA way and wasted precious time.” As I have said throughout this process, there is only one way to get things done, with bipartisan, bicameral support,” Schumer said. Now a bipartisan majority is expected to push the short-term measure over the finish line this week. The agreement on the short-term measure does not mean getting to a final spending bill will be easy in December. The election results could also influence the political calculations if one party fares much better than the other, potentially pushing the fight into early next year.","summary":"The spending bill will fund federal agencies for about three months, pushing final decisions until after the November election.","url":"https://fortune.com/2024/09/22/government-shutdown-deal-spending-bill-secret-service-funds/","image":"https://fortune.com/img-assets/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/AP24262005068159.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-22 22:58:53","author":"Kevin Freking,The Associated Press","authors":["Kevin Freking","The Associated Press"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.393},{"id":257030458,"title":"Hollywood actor says Democratic Party has been ‘hijacked by an extreme woke ideology’","text":"Davi, known for movies like Die Hard and Licence to Kill, cited how he has worked in Hollywood for 46 years and said there used to be a “balance” between celebrities and their political ideologies. However, he argued there is now a “disconnect” between celebrities and the rest of Hollywood, citing that the majority of the Teamsters union who work on film sets support former President Donald Trump. “So there’s a huge disconnect in terms of money and the understanding of what the problems of our nation are,” Davi said on Fox News’s One Nation with Brian Kilmeade. “The Left, the Democratic Party has been hijacked by an extreme woke ideology from the Left, as we’ve even seen from AOC the other day. Her comment on probably one of the biggest, interesting combats against terrorism. She criticized that, and many of the Left is doing that, and continues to do that.” The actor was referring to Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) being one of several Democrats to condemn the exploding pagers and walkie-talkies in Lebanon and Syria, which killed 32 people. She argued there needs to be a “full accounting of the attack,” including whether the United States had any involvement.

On Sunday, Harris urged Trump to accept a proposal to debate on CNN on Oct. 23, as a follow-up to their Sept. 10 debate on ABC. “He should accept because I feel very strongly that we owe it to the American people and to the voters to meet once more before Election Day,” Harris told supporters at a fundraiser in New York City. “We should have another debate,” she added. “My opponent is looking for a reason to avoid.” A representative for Trump’s campaign referred to the presidential candidate’s comments at a rally on Saturday when asked about Harris’ remarks. Speaking to supporters at a North Carolina rally on Saturday, Trump said: “The problem with another debate is that it’s just too late. Voting has already started.” Harris on Sunday acknowledged that early voting had started in some U.S. states but noted that it is a close contest with more than a month to go. “This race is as close as it could be. This is a margin of error race,” she said.","summary":"Speaking to supporters at a North Carolina rally on Saturday, Trump said: \"The problem with another debate is that it's just too late.

The campaign's comment did not link the staff departures to the bombshell CNN report alleging Robinson, a Republican, made antisemitic and racist comments years ago on a porn website, and it did not say why the staffers were stepping down. The campaign said the staff members who stepped down are Chris Rodriguez, campaign manager; Heather Whillier, finance director; Jason Rizk, deputy campaign manager; and Conrad Pogorzelski III, general consultant and senior adviser. \"I appreciate the efforts of these team members who have made the difficult choice to step away from the campaign, and I wish them well in their future endeavors. I look forward to announcing new staff roles in the coming days,\" Robinson said in a statement. He added that he is \"confident our campaign remains in a strong position to make our case to the voters and win on November 5.\" Robinson has denied the allegations in the CNN report and vowed to stay in the race. Some Republican lawmakers have expressed concern over the allegations, but the North Carolina Republican Party emphasized in a statement shortly after the story was published that Robinson \"has categorically denied the allegations.\" Democrats have sought to link Robinson to former President Donald Trump, releasing new advertisements highlighting Trump's previous praise for Robinson, who is North Carolina's lieutenant governor. Trump endorsed Robinson in the governor's race and said he has no plans to withdraw his support. Democrats see North Carolina as a state that can possibly be flipped in the presidential race. They have unleashed resources on the state after Trump won it in 2020 by a narrow margin. Polls indicate that the race remains tight. Trump's running mate, Sen. JD Vance of Ohio, has said it would be \"very hard\" for his ticket to win the presidential race without North Carolina.","summary":"Four top staff members of Mark Robinson's campaign for North Carolina governor have stepped down, the campaign announced as the candidate faces calls from Republicans to do the same.","url":"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2024-election/four-mark-robinson-staffers-step-embattled-campaign-rcna172172","image":"https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-1500w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2024-09/240922-gov-mark-robinson-wm-313p-09a320.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-22 22:51:02","author":"Megan Lebowitz","authors":["Megan Lebowitz"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.219},{"id":257030062,"title":"Cheryl Hines is all smiles as she celebrates her birthday amid husband RFK Jr’s sexting scandal","text":"Actress Cheryl Hines recently celebrated her 59th birthday - and her scandal-plagued husband was nowhere to be found. The Curb Your Enthusiasm alum shared various posts on her Instagram stories of people wishing her a happy birthday. “Me and my girls,” she wrote alongside an image of her daughter Catherine and stepdaughter Kyra while the three of them were sitting at a restaurant together, noticeably without her husband Robert F Kennedy Jr. Catherine also made her own post on her Instagram story at the same restaurant as her mother was about to blow out the candle on top of her dessert. “Happy birthday to the best mother,” she wrote. “I really don’t know how I got so lucky.” Kenndey was not present for any of the birthday festivities as he was participating in a campaign rally for Donald Trump in Las Vegas that same night. The two of them have been married since 2014, 10 years before his “personal relationship” with New York Magazine reporter Olivia Nuzzi that allegedly included them sexting each other. On Thursday, September 19 the outlet had released a statement explaining that the 31-year-old reporter would be placed on leave. “Recently our Washington Correspondent Olivia Nuzzi acknowledged to the magazine’s editors that she had engaged in a personal relationship with a former subject relevant to the 2024 campaign while she was reporting on the campaign, a violation of the magazine’s standards around conflicts of interest and disclosures,” the statement read. “Had the magazine been aware of this relationship, she would not have continued to cover the presidential campaign. An internal review of her published work has found no inaccuracies nor evidence of bias. She is currently on leave from the magazine, and the magazine is conducting a more thorough third-party review. We regret this violation of our readers’ trust.” An editor of the publication released in a staff memo one day later that they would be hiring an “independent third-party” to review Nuzzi’s 2024 writing to see if there is anything the publication must disclose or correct with the reporter’s “relationship” to the former presidential candidate. Nuzzi’s partner Ryan Lizza, a reporter at Politico, released a statement which referred to Nuzzi as his “ex-finacée,” indicating the pair have broken up. It is not clear when the couple parted ways. “Because of my connection to this story through my ex-fiancée, my editors and I have agreed that I won’t be involved in any coverage of Kennedy in Playbook or elsewhere at POLITICO,” Lizza said. After New York Magazine’s announcement, Nuzzi released a statement denying the relationship with RFK Jr was physical. “Earlier this year, the nature of some communication between myself and a former reporting subject turned personal,” she said. “During that time, I did not directly report on the subject nor use them as a source. She added: “The relationship was never physical but should have been disclosed to prevent the appearance of a conflict. I deeply regret not doing so immediately and apologize to those I’ve disappointed, especially my colleagues at New York.” A Kennedy spokesperson told The New York Times that he had met Nuzzi “once in his life for an interview she requested, which yielded a hit piece.”","summary":"‘Happy birthday to the best mother,’ Hines’s daughter Catherine wrote on her Instagram story","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/cheryl-hines-birthday-rfk-jr-scandal-b2617141.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2024/09/22/22/gettyimages-2115717000-594x594.jpg?width=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-22 22:47:13","author":"Brittany Miller","authors":["Brittany Miller"],"language":"en","catgory":"entertainment","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.116},{"id":257029740,"title":"Sebastian Stan from ‘The Apprentice’ reveals lack of sleep while portraying Donald Trump","text":"As Sebastian Stan promotes his most controversial role yet, hopefully he’s getting some well-deserved rest. The Golden Globe nominee recently opened up about how he got into character as Donald Trump for the upcoming Ali Abbasi-helmed film The Apprentice, which premieres Oct. 11 in US theaters, just in time for the undecided voters ahead of Election Day. “It’s a Marvel film,” he joked on the Today show before explaining his process. “Well, [you] try to get sleep, which I didn’t. There’s a lot of research out there, there’s a lot of footage and documentary. It’s pretty much been very well documented, his sort of rise into what we see today. And to me, it’s like playing an instrument. You sit at the piano, you get better at it with practice, and eventually you can just kinda do it in your sleep.” Let’s just hope he didn’t get too lost in the character, especially starring alongside Emmy, Golden Globe winner and noted method actor, Jeremy Strong. Written by Gabe Sherman, The Apprentice charts a young Donald Trump’s ascent to power through a Faustian deal with the influential right-wing lawyer and political fixer Roy Cohn (Strong). The movie also stars Martin Donovan as Fred Trump Sr., and Maria Bakalova as Ivana Trump. After the film had its world premiere at Cannes Film Festival in May, where it received an 11-minute ovation, Trump’s campaign issued a cease-and-desist attempting to stop the film from screening in the US. But the letter appears to have been fruitless as the title went on to screen at Telluride Film Festival last month. The first trailer for the film dropped earlier this month, coinciding with Trump’s ABC News debate against his opponent, Vice President Kamala Harris.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nAs Sebastian Stan promotes his most controversial role yet, hopefully he’s getting&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Sebastian Stan from &#8216;The Apprentice&#8217; reveals lack of sleep while portraying Donald Trump first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/news/sebastian-stan-from-the-apprentice-reveals-lack-of-sleep-while-portraying-donald-trump/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/rewrite-this-title-‘The-Apprentices-Sebastian-Stan-Says-He-Didnt.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-22 22:41:09","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.207},{"id":257029894,"title":"Strictly Come Dancing 'suffers yet another devastating blow as scandal-plagued show's first live episode sees ratings plummet to lowest EVER'","text":"Home News Royals U.S. Sport TV Showbiz Femail Health Science Money Travel Podcasts Shopping Best Buys Discounts My Profile Logout Login Headlines Showbiz Kim Kardashian Victoria Beckham Harry Styles Amanda Holden Britain's Got Talent My Profile Logout Login Privacy Policy Feedback Sunday, Sep 22nd 2024 10PM 13°C 1AM 13°C 5-Day Forecast Advertisement Now Angela Rayner hires £68,000-a-year 'vanity photographer': Deputy PM is the first to have taxpayer-funded staffer to burnish her image - as sleaze controversy grows Israel 'is probing whether it has killed Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar in Gaza airstrike', say reports: IDF 'cannot confirm or deny' taking out October 7 attack mastermind Rachel Reeves comes out fighting following union revolt over her 'cruel' cuts to winter fuel payments for 10million pensioners DAN HODGES: Starmer imagined he could be the new Tony Blair.

Following last week's pre-recorded launch, The Sun reported that Saturday's episode saw a peak of 6.7M viewers, down from 7.3M for the same episode last year and 10.2M in 2020. The show has found itself embroiled in controversy over how the professional dancers teach the celebs, with multiple accusations emerging of bullying and abusive behaviour. All fifteen celebrities and their pro partners took to the dancefloor for the first live show following last weekend's launch, where the pairings were first revealed. A source told the publication that after bosses were fretting after already being 'worried' following the pre-recorded show losing nearly a million viewers on the previous year. Strictly has reportledy been hit with yet another blow after it's first live episode of the latest series saw ratings plummet to it's lowest in the show's 20-year history. Following last week's pre-recorded launch, its been reported that Saturday's episode saw a peak of 6.7M viewers, down from 7.3M for the same episode last year and 10.2M in 2020 Saying: 'The fact that the first live show saw a drop too will be of concern to them — particularly if the drop continues into next week, which is the first elimination show. 'They now face an anxious wait to see whether the drop in on-the-night viewers is made up for by an increase in fans watching Strictly on iPlayer, but those figures take days and weeks to compile. 'These live figures really matter to the Beeb, because Strictly is still seen as one of the few shows that provide the shared TV experience where people come together to watch a programme at a set time.' MailOnline have contacted BBC for comment. The Strictly scandal erupted in January when actress Amanda Abbington accused her Strictly partner Giovanni Pernice of abuse after she unexpectedly quit the show just five weeks in. Sherlock actress Amanda, 50, a has made a series of accusations about Giovanni's teaching methods and has described his behaviour as 'unnecessary, abusive, cruel and mean'. He strongly denies all of the claims. Then, in July, it emerged that Graziano Di Prima had been sacked from Strictly for 'kicking' his partner, Love Island star Zara McDermott. On Saturday judge Shirley Ballas apologised after shocking audiences by kissing fellow judge Motsi Mabuse during the first live show on Saturday night.

Shirley explained that the style was 'all in the posture' as she asked Motsi to help her illustrate the point. Read More Strictly fans convinced bosses purposely cutaway from Zara McDermott as she made her return to the BBC show after her 'distressing' training sessions with sacked pro Graziano DiPrima Anton Du Beke encouraged them as she shouted 'go on girls' - just as Shirley moved her head a certain way and accidentally locked lips with Motsi. Breaking her silence on the moment on Instagram on Sunday morning after the show Shirley joked: 'Sorry @motsimabuse you moved your head too soon! @bbcstrictly what did you think of last night's show?' Strictly returned for its 20th series as it shrugged off the bullying scandal with fan favourites Amy Dowden and Aljaz Škorjanec making their return. The BBC dancing show has been through a tough year after numerous previous contestants alleged abuse by professional dancers. Fans were delighted as Amy returned to the dancefloor for a stunning Waltz with her partner, JLS star JB. Meanwhile Aljaz performed an equally incredible routine with his partner Tasha Ghouri, as they stunned the judges with an upbeat Cha Cha. Surprisingly, one star spotted in the audience was Zara - who was at the heart of the scandal - as she turned up for the show to support her pal Pete Wicks. On Saturday judge Shirley Ballas apologised after shocking audiences by kissing fellow judge Motsi Mabuse during the first live show on Saturday night The dancing expert, 64, was giving advice to Olympic swimmer Tom Dean and his dance partner Nadiya Bychkova about their tango performance when she gave an impromptu demonstration Amy, 34, made a glorious comeback and told host Claudia 'I'm so happy I could burst' after scoring an impressive 31 points on the dancefloor. The fan favourite performed a moving Waltz to When I Need You by Leo Sayer, leaving both judges and fans emotional. Overnight ratings for last week's show revealed that 5.5 million viewers tuned in to see a string of celebrities paired up with professional dancers compared to 6.2 million in 2023. The BBC dodged any mention of the show's string of scandals during its launch episode. Hosts Claudia Winkleman and Tess Daly excitedly introduced this year's celebrities and announced which dancers they would be paired with - but the controversies of the last year went unmentioned.

Email tips@dailymail.com By Geraint Llewellyn For Mailonline Published:23:37 BST, 22 September 2024 |Updated:23:40 BST, 22 September 2024 e-mail View comments Strictly has reportledy been hit with yet another blow after it's first live episode of the latest series saw ratings plummet to it's lowest in the show's 20-year history. Following last week's pre-recorded launch, The Sun reported that Saturday's episode saw a peak of 6.7M viewers, down from 7.3M for the same episode last year and 10.2M in 2020. The show has found itself embroiled in controversy over how the professional dancers teach the celebs, with multiple accusations emerging of bullying and abusive behaviour. All fifteen celebrities and their pro partners took to the dancefloor for the first live show following last weekend's launch, where the pairings were first revealed. A source told the publication that after bosses were fretting after already being 'worried' following the pre-recorded show losing nearly a million viewers on the previous year. Strictly has reportledy been hit with yet another blow after it's first live episode of the latest series saw ratings plummet to it's lowest in the show's 20-year history. Following last week's pre-recorded launch, its been reported that Saturday's episode saw a peak of 6.7M viewers, down from 7.3M for the same episode last year and 10.2M in 2020 Saying: 'The fact that the first live show saw a drop too will be of concern to them — particularly if the drop continues into next week, which is the first elimination show. 'They now face an anxious wait to see whether the drop in on-the-night viewers is made up for by an increase in fans watching Strictly on iPlayer, but those figures take days and weeks to compile. 'These live figures really matter to the Beeb, because Strictly is still seen as one of the few shows that provide the shared TV experience where people come together to watch a programme at a set time.' MailOnline have contacted BBC for comment. The Strictly scandal erupted in January when actress Amanda Abbington accused her Strictly partner Giovanni Pernice of abuse after she unexpectedly quit the show just five weeks in. Sherlock actress Amanda, 50, a has made a series of accusations about Giovanni's teaching methods and has described his behaviour as 'unnecessary, abusive, cruel and mean'. He strongly denies all of the claims. Then, in July, it emerged that Graziano Di Prima had been sacked from Strictly for 'kicking' his partner, Love Island star Zara McDermott. On Saturday judge Shirley Ballas apologised after shocking audiences by kissing fellow judge Motsi Mabuse during the first live show on Saturday night. All fifteen celebrities and their pro partners took to the dancefloor for the first live show following last weekend's launch, where the pairings were first revealed A source said: 'The fact that the first live show saw a drop too will be of concern to them — particularly if the drop continues into next week, which is the first elimination show' The dancing expert, 64, was giving advice to Olympic swimmer Tom Dean and his dance partner Nadiya Bychkova about their tango performance when she gave an impromptu demonstration. Shirley explained that the style was 'all in the posture' as she asked Motsi to help her illustrate the point. Read More Strictly fans convinced bosses purposely cutaway from Zara McDermott as she made her return to the BBC show after her 'distressing' training sessions with sacked pro Graziano DiPrima Anton Du Beke encouraged them as she shouted 'go on girls' - just as Shirley moved her head a certain way and accidentally locked lips with Motsi. Breaking her silence on the moment on Instagram on Sunday morning after the show Shirley joked: 'Sorry @motsimabuse you moved your head too soon! @bbcstrictly what did you think of last night's show?' Strictly returned for its 20th series as it shrugged off the bullying scandal with fan favourites Amy Dowden and Aljaz Škorjanec making their return. The BBC dancing show has been through a tough year after numerous previous contestants alleged abuse by professional dancers. Fans were delighted as Amy returned to the dancefloor for a stunning Waltz with her partner, JLS star JB. Meanwhile Aljaz performed an equally incredible routine with his partner Tasha Ghouri, as they stunned the judges with an upbeat Cha Cha. Surprisingly, one star spotted in the audience was Zara - who was at the heart of the scandal - as she turned up for the show to support her pal Pete Wicks. On Saturday judge Shirley Ballas apologised after shocking audiences by kissing fellow judge Motsi Mabuse during the first live show on Saturday night The dancing expert, 64, was giving advice to Olympic swimmer Tom Dean and his dance partner Nadiya Bychkova about their tango performance when she gave an impromptu demonstration Amy, 34, made a glorious comeback and told host Claudia 'I'm so happy I could burst' after scoring an impressive 31 points on the dancefloor. The fan favourite performed a moving Waltz to When I Need You by Leo Sayer, leaving both judges and fans emotional. Overnight ratings for last week's show revealed that 5.5 million viewers tuned in to see a string of celebrities paired up with professional dancers compared to 6.2 million in 2023. The BBC dodged any mention of the show's string of scandals during its launch episode. Hosts Claudia Winkleman and Tess Daly excitedly introduced this year's celebrities and announced which dancers they would be paired with - but the controversies of the last year went unmentioned.

Kennedy Jr.’s supporters in the swing state of Nevada are nonplussed about his reported sexting scandal — and that’s good news for the presidential hopeful he’s backing, Donald Trump. Kennedy, 70, got top billing at a Trump-sponsored “Restore America” rally in Vegas on Saturday night, drawing a standing-room-only crowd who either didn’t care — or didn’t even know — about the bombshell allegation. “I’m not familiar with that particular issue. I am with a lot of issues, but that one’s new to me,” said local Ken Czech, who was wearing a “Kennedy 24” t-shirt, a nod to the Kennedy scion’s failed attempt to run for president in November on the independent ticket. Kennedy, 70, who is married to “Curb Your Enthusiasm” actress Cheryl Hines, 59, was allegedly involved in a newly revealed, seamy sexting relationship with New York magazine’s star political scribe Olivia Nuzzi, 31. Czech said he is more interested in Kennedy’s efforts to help Trump form a “unity party.’’ Retired Las Vegas court reporter Christine Johnson said reports of the scandal meant little to her, too. “I support RFK, and whatever his headlines are, they are,” she said of the politician, who threw his support behind Trump after backing out of the race. “People are going to put their own spin on it.” Charles Atwood Hightower, a retired US army sergeant first class and a contractor, said those criticizing Kennedy’s private life should “drop dead. “Your personal life is your personal life,” Hightower said. “God gave you that right.’’ Retired Judge Charles Weinberg slammed the sexting story as a joke. “I mean, there’s so much propaganda and false information out now. I think this guy’s a legit guy,’’ he said of Kennedy. Lawyer Gregory Brittain of Redlands, Cali., said that if the married Kennedy was “coming on to someone else, that would be inappropriate.” But “no one is perfect, and least of all the Democrats on the other side who do this, who, I was saying, the real racists and the real sexists are the Democrats who, who so strongly profess right, maybe for women and for the minorities,’’ Brittain said. The event, moderated by race-car driving personality Danica Patrick at a Las Vegas rec center, was Kennedy’s first public appearance since the scandal broke last week. He did not address it at the event. But he did wear his wedding ring, while Hines reportedly ditched hers for at least part of her Italian vacation at the same time. Former Rep. Tulsi Gabbard, an ex-Democrat from Hawaii, appeared with Kennedy at the rally for Trump, who faces an expected bruising battle against Democratic nominee and Vice President Kamala Harris. Gabbard told The Post it was the kind of “distraction” she expects will increase as Election Day draws near. “The elitist, permanent Washington establishment, the military-industrial complex, the national security state, this whole cabal of the power elite are so terrified of President Trump winning this election that they will continue to do what they have been doing for years and throw everything they possibly can at it,” she said. “I know that Bobby Kennedy is focused, as I am, on saving our country,’’ Gabbard said. “President Trump is focused on his mission of saving our country, and none of us are going to allow any of these distractions to get in the way.”","summary":"Robert F.

Temporary spending bills generally fund agencies at current levels, but an additional $231 million was included to bolster the Secret Service, and additional money was added to replenish a disaster relief fund and aid with the presidential transition, among other things. Lawmakers have struggled to get to this point as the current budget year winds to a close at month’s end. At the urging of the most conservative members of his conference, House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., had linked temporary funding with a mandate that would have compelled states to require proof of citizenship when people register to vote. But Johnson could not get all Republicans on board even as the party’s presidential nominee, Donald Trump, insisted on that package. Trump said Republican lawmakers should not support a stop-gap measure without the voting requirement, but the bill went down to defeat anyway, with 14 Republicans opposing it. Bipartisan negotiations began in earnest shortly after that, with leadership agreeing to extend funding into mid-December. That gives the current Congress the ability to fashion a full-year spending bill after the Nov. 5 election, rather than push that responsibility to the next Congress and president. In a letter to Republican colleagues, Johnson said the budget measure would be “very narrow, bare-bones” and include “only the extensions that are absolutely necessary.” “While this is not the solution any of us prefer, it is the most prudent path forward under the present circumstances,” Johnson wrote. “As history has taught and current polling affirms, shutting the government down less than 40 days from a fateful election would be an act of political malpractice.” House Democratic leader Hakeem Jeffries said Democrats would evaluate the bill in its entirety before this week’s vote, but with the agreement, “Congress is now on a bipartisan path to avoid a government shutdown that would hurt everyday Americans.” Rep. Tom Cole, the House Appropriations Committee chairman, had said on Friday that talks were going well. “So far, nothing has come up that we can’t deal with,” said Cole, R-Okla. “Most people don’t want a government shutdown and they don’t want that to interfere with the election. So nobody is like, ‘I’ve got to have this or we’re walking.’ It’s just not that way.” Johnson’s earlier effort had no chance in the Democratic-controlled Senate and was opposed by the White House, but it did give the speaker a chance to show Trump and conservatives within his conference that he fought for their request. The final result — government funding effectively on autopilot — was what many had predicted. With the election just weeks away, few lawmakers in either party had any appetite for the brinksmanship that often leads to a shutdown. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer said the same agreement could have been reached two weeks ago, but “Speaker Johnson chose to follow the MAGA way and wasted precious time.” As I have said throughout this process, there is only one way to get things done, with bipartisan, bicameral support,” Schumer said. Now a bipartisan majority is expected to push the short-term measure over the finish line this week. The agreement on the short-term measure does not mean getting to a final spending bill will be easy in December. The election results could also influence the political calculations if one party fares much better than the other, potentially pushing the fight into early next year.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nWASHINGTON – Congressional leaders announced an agreement Sunday on a short-term spending&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Government funding approved to prevent shutdown and support operations until December first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/local-news/government-funding-approved-to-prevent-shutdown-and-support-operations-until-december/","image":"https://res.cloudinary.com/graham-media-group/image/upload/f_auto/q_auto/c_thumb,w_700/v1/media/gmg/DPIJRRVHIVFWHDLL5IIIW45J2M.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-22 22:37:01","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.356},{"id":257029900,"title":"Spending deal averts a possible federal shutdown and funds the government into December","text":"WASHINGTON — Congressional leaders announced an agreement Sunday on a short-term spending bill that will fund federal agencies for about three months, averting a possible partial government shutdown when the new budget year begins Oct. 1 and pushing final decisions until after the November election.

Though the sources did not provide specifics on the new economic policies, Harris’s 2020 presidential run and the Biden administration have released strategies aimed at achieving similar goals. In 2020, Harris proposed significant pay hikes for public school teachers during her campaign, while the Biden-Harris administration has pushed to eliminate bias in home appraisals and use the $700 billion federal contracting budget to boost minority businesses. Harris has released a few economic policies so far, such as pushing for the construction of 3 million new housing units and a tax incentive for builders who construct homes for first-time buyers, as well as a $40 billion fund to help local governments find solutions to the problem of supply. The vice president also broke away from Biden’s stance on hiking up the top capital gains rate, claiming as president she would call for a tax rate of 28% as opposed to the president’s 44.6% rate. Her campaign previously told the Washington Examiner that she no longer supports a federal job guarantee, something that many proponents of a Green New Deal have pushed for. She has also reversed course on eliminating private healthcare plans as part of a Medicare for All plan and banning fracking.","summary":"Vice President Kamala Harris is reportedly unveiling a string of economic proposals this week related to helping people build wealth, the latest step by the vice president as she seeks to elevate public perception over her ability to handle the economy should she win the 2024 presidential election.

I think that will be, that will be it,” Trump said when journalist Sharyl Attkisson asked him if he’d run again. The comment was notable both because Trump seemed to rule out a fourth bid for the White House and because he rarely admits the possibility he could legitimately lose an election. Trump normally insists that could only happen if there were widespread cheating, a false allegation he made in 2020 and he’s preemptively made again during his 2024 presidential campaign. Trump would be 82 in 2028, a year older than President Joe Biden is now. Biden bowed out of the race in July following his disastrous debate performance and months of being hammered by Trump and other conservatives as being too old and erratic for the job. Attkisson interviewed Trump for her show “Full Measure.” Also during the 22-minute interview, Trump defended his record on the coronavirus pandemic. He took credit for the development of the COVID-19 vaccines developed during his presidency while also saying “they’re doing studies on the vaccines and we’re going to find out” if they are safe. Trump said Republicans have become skeptical about the vaccines even as Democrats trust them. The statement about 2028 came at the very end of the interview, which also included a question about how Trump stays in good health. “I try and eat properly,” the former president said, drawing an incredulous reaction from Attkisson, who noted that Trump has become infamous for his fondness for hamburgers. “Proper hamburgers,” Trump said.","summary":"The comment was notable both because Trump seemed to rule out a fourth bid for the White House and because he rarely admits the possibility he could legitimately lose an election.","url":"https://fortune.com/2024/09/22/donald-trump-last-election-2024-campaign-kamala-harris-white-house/","image":"https://fortune.com/img-assets/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/AP24265722065882-e1727043688974.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-22 22:29:14","author":"The Associated Press","authors":["The Associated Press"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.021},{"id":257029564,"title":"Speaker Mike Johnson unveils new plan to fund government","text":"Washington — Speaker Mike Johnson unveiled the latest plan to temporarily fund the government on Sunday after Congressional leaders reached an agreement following the House's rejection of Johnson's opening gambit last week, with an end-of-month deadline to avert a government shutdown approaching.\"Since we fell a bit short of the goal line, an alternative plan is now required,\" Johnson said in a letter to colleagues announcing the new plan on Sunday.Last week, Johnson moved forward with a vote on a six-month continuing resolution to keep the government funded that was paired with a controversial non-citizen voting measure that Democrats saw as a nonstarter. And with opposition from a small group of House Republicans in the razor-thin GOP majority, the measure fell short of the support necessary for passage. On Sunday, Johnson outlined that the House will now move forward with a vote on a three-month stopgap measure to keep the government funded without the voting measure attached, teeing up a funding fight ahead of the holidays that has become typical for Congress.Johnson said he made the move on Sunday to prevent the Senate from \"jamming us with a bill loaded with billions in new spending and unrelated provisions,\" saying the three-month continuing resolution is \"the only option that remains.\"After the speaker's plan fell short last week, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer teed up a legislative vehicle for a Senate vote in the event the House is unable to find a path forward. Johnson said in contrast to a Senate-led bill, the House legislation \"will be a very narrow, bare-bones [continuing resolution] including only the extensions that are absolutely necessary.\"The legislation also includes around $230 million in additional funding for the Secret Service, which comes after an apparent second assassination attempt against former President Donald Trump. Lawmakers have been considering how to address the funding after the Secret Service said its resources are being stretched thin by heightened protection levels in the aftermath of the first attempt on Trump's life.For many House conservatives, who generally oppose continuing resolutions, the new plan represents a situation they hoped to avoid. Johnson acknowledged that it would come as a disappointment to some, but he urged that \"it is the most prudent path forward under the present circumstances.\"With such a narrow majority in the lower chamber, Johnson faced few options after he was unable to coalesce House Republicans around the original funding bill, making working across the aisle necessary to avoid a government shutdown. A suggestion by Trump that Republicans should shut down the government if they weren't able to get the non-citizen voting measure approved further complicated matters for Johnson. But on Friday, the speaker signaled that he expected Trump to soften on his calls for a shutdown. \"As history has taught and current polling affirms, shutting the government down less than 40 days from a fateful election would be an act of political malpractice,\" Johnson wrote in the letter to colleagues. Schumer on Sunday criticized Johnson in a statement, accusing the speaker of wasting \"precious time\" to come to an agreement on how to fund the government, though he celebrated the bipartisan negotiations that he said have occurred over the last four days.\"While I am pleased bipartisan negotiations quickly led to a government funding agreement free of cuts and poison pills, this same agreement could have been done two weeks ago,\" Schumer said. \"The government will run out of funding just over a week from today. Time is of the essence, and I hope Speaker Johnson and House Republicans will not waste any more time.\"The New York Democrat said he is hopeful both chambers can approve the continuing resolution this week. Congress has until Oct. 1 to fund the government.House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries said in a statement that House Democrats would \"evaluate the spending legislation in its entirety in advance of its consideration on the Floor\" upon their return to Washington this week.\"Congress is now on a bipartisan path to avoid a government shutdown that would hurt everyday Americans,\" Jeffries said.","summary":"The new plan to avert a government shutdown comes after the House rejected Speaker Johnson's opening gambit in the funding fight last week.","url":"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/government-shutdown-mike-johnson-continuing-resolution-plan/","image":"https://assets3.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2024/09/22/fd09a430-284b-4105-9808-946cddfb5407/thumbnail/1200x630/23802c9bd9117d9c4860c1ed224ec47c/gettyimages-2172901314.jpg?v=159d4576ec63c034c87559bf5085176a","video":"https://prod.vodvideo.cbsnews.com/cbsnews/vr/hls/3206036_hls/master.m3u8","publish_date":"2024-09-22 22:29:00","author":"Kaia Hubbard","authors":["Kaia Hubbard"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.197},{"id":257030002,"title":"Donald Trump eyes ban to stop China threat to US farmers, food supply in swing-state stop","text":"Donald Trump will address China’s potential threat to America’s farms and food supply during a Monday event in rural Pennsylvania, a host of the event told The Post. The 45th president has vowed to ban Chinese nationals from buying US farmland or owning telecommunications, energy, technology and medical supplies companies, if he retakes the White House. Trump will be joined by former Long Island Congressman and 2022 gubernatorial candidate Lee Zeldin and his former Ambassador to Germany Richard Grenell, at a family farm in rural Westmoreland County. “China’s Communist Party is threatening our food supply,” said Zeldin, who is affiliated with the Protecting America Initiative, which is hosting the event.. Zeldin said the United States has lax reporting and enforcement of foreign-owned companies that purchase farms. “President Trump understood this threat when he was in the White House,” he said. “China wants us to be dependent on the supply chain.” US dependence on China was exposed during the worst of the COVID-19 pandemic. There was a dramatic shortage of personal protective equipment across the country, because most of the supply was manufactured in China — not in the US. Some nurses even resorted to wearing trash bags because of a shortage of PPE. The cruel irony, Zeldin said, is that America was dependent on protective masks from China, the origin of the worst pandemic in a century that spread across the globe killing millions in America and globally. The Trump-Republican Party platform includes a plank calling for securing “strategic independence from China.” “Republicans will revoke China’s Most Favored Nation status, phase out imports of essential goods, and stop China from buying American Real Estate and Industries,” the Trump-GOP platform states. Zeldin said China’s investment or purchase of US assets would also trigger more espionage. Chinese-based firms must abide by compliance requirements that they turn over sensitive information to the communist government. Linda Sun, a former top aide to Gov. Kathy Hochul who previously worked for ex-Gov.

While 58 percent of registered voters think the threat of political violence will be greater under Trump if he is elected, 21 percent say it will fall, a poll from CBS News released Sunday reveals. Another 21 percent say there will be no change. Just over 40 percent of registered voters say the threat of political violence will be greater if current Vice President Kamala Harris is elected, while 27 percent say it will decrease and 30 percent expect it to stay the same, according to the poll. Roughly 83 percent of Harris voters believe the threat of political violence will be greater under the former president, while 63 percent of Trump voters say it will rise under the vice president if she wins. The poll comes as GOP leaders blame Democratic rhetoric for the two assassination attempts against Trump this summer. Last week, Republican vice president nominee Senator JD Vance said that the lack of assassination attempts against Harris are evidence that Democratic rhetoric is fueling violence against Trump. “No one has tried to kill Kamala Harris in the last couple of months, and two people now have tried to kill Donald Trump in the last couple of months,” Vance said at a Faith and Freedom Coalition event. “I think that’s pretty strong evidence that the left needs to tone down the rhetoric or somebody is going to get hurt.” Trump has similarly blamed Harris for the attempts on his life. “The Rhetoric, Lies, as exemplified by the false statements made by Comrade Kamala Harris during the rigged and highly partisan ABC Debate...has taken politics in our Country to a whole new level of Hatred, Abuse, and Distrust,” he wrote on Truth Social. Others, such Trump’s attorney Alina Habba, have blamed President Joe Biden as well. “No president in this country, and I mean, no president, Republican or Democrat should be in this situation, not once, but twice,” Habba told Fox News on Friday. “It’s an embarrassment to our country. It’s an embarrassment to President Trump,” she continued. “It’s an embarrassment frankly, to Harris and Biden, because they’re the ones in charge right now, and denying assets to a president and future, frankly, future president and the candidate that’s doing the best right now is a serious concern of mine.” Harris and Biden have both denounced political violence, with the president even noting the Secret Service needs additional resources as Trump faces threats to his life. “Thank God the president is okay,” Biden said last week. “But one thing I want to make clear: the Service needs more help.” The first attempt on Trump’s life came in July, when Thomas Crooks opened fire at a rally in Butler, Pennsylvania. Crooks, 20, shot Trump in the ear. He killed one attendee and injured two others. Then, last weekend, officers arrested Ryan Wesley Routh for allegedly aiming an SKS-style rifle through the bushes at Trump National Golf Club in West Palm Beach, Florida, while the former president was playing a round.","summary":"Donald Trump and JD Vance have both blamed threats to the former president’s life on Democratic rhetoric","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/trump-kamala-harris-political-violence-poll-b2617126.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2024/09/21/04/trump-harris.jpg?width=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/jobnTLVd-4VHSaSK0.mp4","publish_date":"2024-09-22 22:23:27","author":"Katie Hawkinson","authors":["Katie Hawkinson"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.369},{"id":257028902,"title":"US House Republicans unveil 3-month stopgap bill to avert government shutdown","text":"Republican US House of Representatives Speaker Mike Johnson on Sunday proposed a three-month stopgap funding bill that excludes an immigration-related measure demanded by Donald Trump, as lawmakers look to avert a month-end partial government shutdown. Johnson laid out the plan in a letter to colleagues released just eight days before the government’s current US$1.2 trillion in discretionary funding runs out on September 30. The chamber will aim to vote on the measure on Wednesday, according to a source with knowledge of the plan. Failure to act by then would furlough thousands of federal workers and shut down a wide swathe of government operations weeks before the November 5 election. Congress is now on a bipartisan path to avoid a government shutdown that would hurt everyday Americans House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries The proposal, which excludes a Trump demand to impose new requirements that people provide proof of citizenship to register to vote, is aligned with what Democratic Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer had urged, a basic extension of government funding to December. It runs until December 20. “As history has taught and current polling affirms, shutting the government down less than 40 days from a fateful election would be an act of political malpractice,” Johnson said in the letter. Democrats, including Schumer and House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, expressed optimism a bipartisan deal could be reached. Jeffries welcomed the proposal unveiled on Sunday. He said in a statement that House Democrats would evaluate it after a previous proposal which Republicans had “inappropriately attempted to jam” with partisan policy. “Congress is now on a bipartisan path to avoid a government shutdown that would hurt everyday Americans,” Jeffries said. The House, which Republicans control by a narrow 220-211 margin, on Wednesday rejected Johnson’s prior proposal for a six-month funding extension including the voter-registration measure, which Democrats and democracy advocates call unnecessary as it is already illegal for non-citizens to vote in federal elections. Congress faces an even more critical deadline on January 1, by which time lawmakers will have to raise the nation’s debt ceiling or risk defaulting on more than US$35 trillion in federal government debt. The bill proposes US$231 million in additional funding for the US Secret Service after a gunman attempted to assassinate Trump in July, grazing his ear, and another gunman was discovered this month lying in wait just outside the fence of a Florida golf course where Trump was playing. The additional funds would be made available “for operations necessary to carry out protective operations including the 2024 presidential campaign”, the bill said.","summary":"Chamber aims to vote on measure on Wednesday.

The bus tour, which kicked off in Palm Beach, Florida, on Sept. 3, has been cruising through key states like Michigan, where stops include Madison Heights, Flint, Ann Arbor, Lansing, Grand Rapids and Marquette. According to the Democratic presidential candidate’s campaign, each stop will “emphasize the stark contrast between Vice President Harris and Gov.Walz, who will restore the protections of Roe v.

Chris Christie appeared as part of the political panel on ABC’s This Week on Sunday where the former New Jersey governor explained that Trump “needs” another go at debating Democratic rival Kamala Harris given her successful performance against him at the September presidential debate in Philadelphia. Harris has already accepted the October 23 debate proposal, while Trump has said it is “too late” for another match-up. Christie, who helped prep Trump for the debates in 2020, said the former president’s polling is why he will eventually agree, as it was trending “away” from the former president’s favor and risked showing him sliding into a firm second place if trends were not corrected in the weeks ahead. “[T]hese debate decisions, George, are tactical, they’re not philosophical. They’re tactical,” Christie told host George Stephanopoulos. “And if the polls continue to move a bit away from Trump, you know how much he focuses on that. And he’s going to need something to change it and in today’s media landscape, absent a big mistake by one or the other, this is the only way.” Christie added that Trump would “convince himself” of his ability to deliver a knockout performance against Harris in a debate, even after missing that chance already. “He will convince himself that if she gets in the ring with him again, that he’ll knock her out. That will be his mindset,” Christie said. “Now, whether he’ll do the work that’s gonna be necessary to be prepared which he clearly did not do the last time is a completely open question. But I’ll say this, he needs it.” Christie added: “I think he’ll eventually capitulate.” Trump has not put out a statement at any length addressing the CNN invitation, but at a rally in North Carolina on Saturday appeared to dismiss the proposed debate as “too late” in the election season. Polling and other metrics have shown Harris taking a clear grasp of the race’s momentum in the wake of her September 10 showdown with Trump in Pennsylvania as well as generally since the beginning of her campaign for president in July. On Friday, that trend was underscored once more by the posting of August’s fundraising numbers; Harris’s campaign blew past her opponent’s for the second straight month. On Sunday, the release of a new NBC News national poll outlined how the race has shifted dramatically since President Joe Biden stepped aside as the Democratic nominee. In the first survey from this pollster since Biden’s announcement, Harris has rebuilt her party’s standing and now leads her opponent by five percentage points, buoyed by her soaring favorability ratings. Harris’s campaign is still calling the race a dead heat and encouraging supporters view it the same way. Campaign chair Jen O’Malley Dillon attacked Trump for his apparent refusal to accept the CNN debate stage in a statement on Saturday. “It would be unprecedented in modern history for there to just be one general election debate. Debates offer a unique chance for voters to see the candidates side by side and take stock of their competing visions for America,” she said. “Vice President Harris is ready for another opportunity to share a stage with Donald Trump, and she has accepted CNN’s invitation to a debate on October 23. Donald Trump should have no problem agreeing to this debate. It is the same format and setup as the CNN debate he attended and said he won in June, when he praised CNN’s moderators, rules, and ratings,” O’Malley Dillon continued. “We look forward to Vice President Harris again having the opportunity in the CNN debate to show her command of the issues and why it’s time to turn the page on Donald Trump and chart a new way forward for America.”","summary":"Harris campaign says having just one debate between final candidates would be ‘unprecedented’","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/trump-harris-second-debate-chris-christie-b2617136.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2024/09/22/22/christie_abc_sept2024.jpg?width=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-22 22:12:02","author":"John Bowden","authors":["John Bowden"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.36},{"id":257028884,"title":"Robert F.

Lawmakers have struggled to get to this point as the current budget year winds to a close at month’s end. At the urging of the most conservative members of his conference, House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., had linked temporary funding with a mandate that would have compelled states to require proof of citizenship when people register to vote. But Johnson could not get all Republicans on board even as the party’s presidential nominee, Donald Trump, insisted on that package. Trump said Republican lawmakers should not support a stop-gap measure without the voting requirement, but the bill went down to defeat anyway, with 14 Republicans opposing it. Bipartisan negotiations began in earnest shortly after that, with leadership agreeing to extend funding into mid-December. That gives the current Congress the ability to fashion a full-year spending bill after the Nov. 5 election, rather than push that responsibility to the next Congress and president. In a letter to Republican colleagues, Johnson said the budget measure would be “very narrow, bare-bones” and include “only the extensions that are absolutely necessary.” “While this is not the solution any of us prefer, it is the most prudent path forward under the present circumstances,” Johnson wrote. “As history has taught and current polling affirms, shutting the government down less than 40 days from a fateful election would be an act of political malpractice.” Rep. Tom Cole, the House Appropriations Committee chairman, had said on Friday that talks were going well. “So far, nothing has come up that we can’t deal with,” said Cole, R-Okla. “Most people don’t want a government shutdown and they don’t want that to interfere with the election. So nobody is like, ‘I’ve got to have this or we’re walking.’ It’s just not that way.” Johnson’s earlier effort had no chance in the Democratic-controlled Senate and was opposed by the White House, but it did give the speaker a chance to show Trump and conservatives within his conference that he fought for their request. The final result – government funding effectively on autopilot – was what many had predicted. With the election just weeks away, few lawmakers in either party had any appetite for the brinksmanship that often leads to a shutdown. Now, a bipartisan majority is expected to push the short-term measure over the finish line. Temporary spending bills generally fund agencies at current levels, but some additional money was included to bolster the Secret Service, replenish a disaster relief fund and aid with the presidential transition, among other things.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nWASHINGTON &#8212; Congressional leaders announced an agreement Sunday on a short-term spending&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Government funding extended till December as spending deal avoids federal shutdown first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/news/us/government-funding-extended-till-december-as-spending-deal-avoids-federal-shutdown/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/rewrite-this-title-Spending-deal-averts-a-possible-federal-shutdown.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-22 22:10:12","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.326},{"id":257029434,"title":"Trump Says He Won’t Run Again If He Loses in 2024","text":"Former President Donald Trump said in a new interview that he likely will not run for president again if he loses the 2024 election against Democratic Vice President and presidential nominee Kamala Harris. Trump, 78, made the comments during an interview with former CBS News journalist Sharyl Attkisson published on Sunday. “If you’re not successful this time, do you see yourself running again in four years?” she asked the Republican nominee. Trump stated, “No, I don’t. I think that that will be—that will be it. I don’t see that at all.” “I think that hopefully we’re going to be successful,” he said of the 2024 General Election, about a month and a half away. In the wide-ranging interview with Attkisson, Trump was also asked about a number of issues, including the economy, inflation, illegal immigration, and the two recent assassination attempts against him. When asked about his plan to deal with inflation, Trump said, “They come down with energy and they come down with interest rates. We’re going to get, as I told you, we’re going to get energy down by 50 percent in 12 months.” “I’m not just talking about cars. I’m talking about air conditioning, heating, your basic energy, operating a bakery, operating any kind of a business—it’s all having to do with energy,” he added. Trump also spoke separately to Fox News’s Brian Kilmeade Saturday about whether he’s concerned with his family’s security in light of the two assassination attempts. “I do. I do. I don’t talk about it, but I do. I have to worry about family. I have to worry about everybody. I worry about you,” he responded. Trump then pivoted to illegal immigration, suggesting that millions of people, including convicted criminals, who have come into the United States in recent years have made the country a more dangerous place to live. He made similar, immigration-related comments in his interview with Attkisson. The former president in the two interviews provided few details about the two assassination attempts, the most recent of which occurred on Sept. 15 while he was golfing at his Florida golf course. In July, Trump narrowly escaped death and was shot in the ear when a 20-year-old shooter fired at a rally while the former president was speaking in Butler, Pennsylvania. The FBI is investigating both incidents as assassination attempts against the former president. There have not been any reports indicating that members of Trump’s family have been targeted in similar incidents. Ryan Routh, the suspect who allegedly tried to assassinate Trump in Florida, is scheduled to make his second court appearance at a federal court on Sept. 23. Prosecutors charged him with firearms-related charges, but he’s likely to face more in connection with the apparent assassination attempt. While Trump was golfing at his West Palm Beach course a week ago, a Secret Service agent spotted a gun barrel sticking through a perimeter fence before shots were fired at Routh, who allegedly fled the scene and was captured on Interstate 95 in one county away. The FBI and prosecutors say an SKS-style rifle with a scope, backpacks, food, and a camera were recovered at the site. Routh, 58, is believed to have been camped at the golf course perimeter for 12 hours, according to prosecutors, citing his cellphone data. Authorities have not publicly commented on a motive. Numerous social media posts indicate that Routh was an ardent backer of Ukraine in the Russia-Ukraine conflict and had made critical comments about Trump. In the Pennsylvania shooting, Thomas Matthew Crooks was identified as the shooter. He was shot and killed soon after opening fire at the former president.","summary":"'I don't see that at all,' he said.","url":"https://www.theepochtimes.com/us/trump-says-he-wont-run-again-in-2028-if-hes-not-successful-in-2024-post-5728225","image":"https://img.theepochtimes.com/assets/uploads/2024/09/16/id5725006-Donald-Trump-13_JF_09132024-OP-300x180.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-22 22:08:50","author":"Jack Phillips","authors":["Jack Phillips"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.188}]}
