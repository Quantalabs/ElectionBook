No names were immediately released. The bodies were in Israel and were being taken to the country's National Institute of Forensic Medicine. Israel announced earlier Saturday that Gaza’s sole crossing with the outside world, Rafah , would stay closed “until further notice,” tying it to Hamas’ release of remains. On Thursday it had said the crossing likely would reopen Sunday. Hamas has now handed over the remains of 12 of the 28 dead hostages in Gaza, a key step in the week-old ceasefire process meant to end two years of war. The militant group says devastation and Israeli military control of certain areas of Gaza have slowed the handover. The statement by Netanyahu ’s office on the Rafah crossing came shortly after the Palestinian embassy in Egypt said it would reopen Monday for people returning to Gaza. Hamas called Netanyahu’s decision a violation of the ceasefire deal. The Rafah crossing has been closed since May 2024, when Israel took control of the Gaza side. A fully reopened crossing would make it easier for Gazans to seek medical treatment, travel or visit family in Egypt, home to tens of thousands of Palestinians. Anxiety on both sides over remains Israel has been returning the bodies of Palestinians with no names, only numbers. Gaza’s Health Ministry posts photos of them online, hoping families will come forward. ”Just like they took their captives, we want our captives. Bring me my son, bring all our kids back,” said a tearful Iman Sakani, whose son went missing during the war. She was among dozens of anxious families waiting at Nasser hospital. One woman knelt, crying over a body after identifying it. As part of the ceasefire agreement, Israel on Saturday returned 15 bodies of Palestinians to Gaza, bringing the total it has returned to 135. Meanwhile, Gaza’s ruins were being scoured for the dead. Newly recovered bodies brought the Palestinian toll above 68,000, according to Gaza’s Health Ministry. Thousands of people are still missing, according to the Red Cross. The ministry, part of the Hamas-run government, doesn’t distinguish between civilians and combatants in its count. But the ministry maintains detailed casualty records that are seen as generally reliable by U.N. agencies and independent experts. Israel has disputed them without providing its own toll. Hamas-led militants killed around 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and abducted 251 people in the attack on southern Israel that sparked the war on Oct. 7, 2023. A push for hostages’ remains Israel also said the remains of a 10th hostage that Hamas handed over Friday were identified as Eliyahu Margalit. The 76-year-old was abducted from kibbutz Nir Oz during the Oct. 7 attack. His remains were found after bulldozers plowed areas in the southern city of Khan Younis. U.S. President Donald Trump has warned that he would greenlight a resumption of the war by Israel if Hamas doesn’t return the remains of all dead hostages. Hamas has said it is committed to the ceasefire deal, but that the retrieval of remains is also hampered by the presence of unexploded ordnance in the territory’s vast ruins. The U.S. State Department on Saturday said it had credible reports of an imminent planned attack by Hamas against residents of Gaza. “This planned attack against Palestinian civilians would constitute a direct and grave violation of the ceasefire agreement and undermine the significant progress achieved through mediation efforts,\" it said in a statement. ”The guarantors demand Hamas uphold its obligations under the ceasefire terms. “Should Hamas proceed with this attack, measures will be taken to protect the people of Gaza and preserve the integrity of the ceasefire” forged by Trump to end the two-year war between Israel and Hamas, it added. There were no additional details. The Israeli organization supporting families of those abducted said it will continue holding weekly rallies in Tel Aviv until all are returned. “We don’t want to go back to fighting, God forbid, but this whole ordeal must end, and all the hostages must be returned,” said Ifat Calderon, aunt of freed hostage Ofer Calderon. Aid remains limited Hamas has urged mediators to increase the flow of aid into Gaza as closures of crossings and Israeli restrictions on aid groups continue. “Vast parts of the city are just a wasteland,”...","summary":"Israel announced earlier Saturday that Gaza’s sole crossing with the outside world, Rafah , would stay closed “until further notice\"","url":"https://www.deccanchronicle.com/world/middle-east/israel-hamas-hands-over-bodies-of-2-hostages-1911203","image":"https://www.deccanchronicle.com/h-upload/2025/10/19/1969112-iss.webp","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-10-19 01:09:07","author":null,"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"in","sentiment":-0.272},{"id":370531504,"title":"Bank heads to open up before 'urgent' rate cut talks","text":"Central bank chiefs could set the table for an interest rate cut when they speak after a shock unemployment jump.\n\nReserve Bank Governor Michele Bullock and key lieutenant Brad Jones will address events this week, a fortnight before they meet and ponder a fourth interest rate cut for 2025.\n\nAustralia's jobless rate jumped to 4.5 per cent in September, the four-year high far exceeding predictions from analysts and economists.\n\nHeightened expectations of an interest rate put the local share market into overdrive and record its highest-ever close on Thursday.\n\nA cut would be welcome news for the Australian Council of Social Service, which pointed out there are now two people unemployed for every job vacancy.\n\n\"Keeping interest rates high is hammering jobs and livelihoods,\" CEO Cassandra Goldie said.\n\n\"The greatest risk to the economy now is not a resurgence in inflation but the further loss of jobs and incomes.\n\n\"Urgent rate cuts are essential to support job creation and prevent further rises in unemployment.\"\n\nMs Bullock will deliver the Bradfield Oration on Friday.\n\nBefore the surprise jobs data, she described the jobs market as a bit tight, meaning there are more jobs than available workers.\n\n\"But we look at a lot of different indicators of the labour market, so those two things (inflation and employment) suggest to us that maybe it's a little tight but it's close to balance,\" she said.\n\nLabour force figures contributed to the Reserve Bank keeping the cash rate on hold at September's meeting, with the recent data appearing to pave the way for a 0.25 per cent trim.\n\n\"The underemployment rate had edged lower while other measures of labour under-utilisation had been broadly stable,\" minutes from the meeting read.\n\nWilliam Buck chief economist Besa Deda said good news was on the way for borrowers.\n\n\"Governor Bullock's description of monetary policy as 'marginally tight' at a Washington forum reinforces our view that further easing is ahead,\" she said.\n\n\"We maintain our forecast for two more rate cuts before mid-next year, with the next cut in November.\"\n\nWall Street investors are meanwhile assessing Donald Trump's latest remarks on tariffs.\n\nThe US president says his proposed 100 per cent impost on goods from China won't be sustainable but is blaming Beijing for the latest impasse in trade talks.\n\nThe S&P 500 climbed 0.53 per cent on Friday to end the session at 6,664.01 points.

People carrying signs with slogans such as “Nothing is more patriotic than protesting” or “Resist Fascism\" packed into New York City’s Times Square and rallied by the thousands in parks in Boston, Atlanta and Chicago. Demonstrators marched through Washington and downtown Los Angeles and picketed outside capitols in several Republican-led states, a courthouse in Billings, Montana, and at hundreds of smaller public spaces. Trump's Republican Party disparaged the demonstrations as “Hate America” rallies , but in many places the events looked more like a street party. There were marching bands, a huge banner with the U.S. Constitution’s “We The People” preamble that people could sign, and demonstrators wearing inflatable costumes, particularly frogs, which have emerged as a sign of resistance in Portland, Oregon. It was the third mass mobilization since Trump's return to the White House and came against the backdrop of a government shutdown that not only has closed federal programs and services but is testing the core balance of power, as an aggressive executive confronts Congress and the courts in ways that protest organizers warn are a slide toward authoritarianism. In Washington, Iraq War Marine veteran Shawn Howard said he had never participated in a protest before but was motivated to show up because of what he sees as the Trump administration’s “disregard for the law.” He said immigration detentions without due process and deployments of troops in U.S. cities are “un-American” and alarming signs of eroding democracy. “I fought for freedom and against this kind of extremism abroad,” said Howard, who added that he also worked at the CIA for 20 years on counter-extremism operations. “And now I see a moment in America where we have extremists everywhere who are, in my opinion, pushing us to some kind of civil conflict.” Trump, meanwhile, was spending the weekend at his Mar-a-Lago home in Florida. “They say they’re referring to me as a king. I’m not a king,” the president said in a Fox News interview that aired early Friday, before he departed for a $1 million-per-plate MAGA Inc. fundraiser at his club. Later that day a Trump campaign social media account mocked the protests by posting a computer-generated video of the president clothed like a monarch, wearing a crown and waving from a balcony. Nationwide demonstrations In San Francisco hundreds of people spelled out “No King!” and other phrases with their bodies on Ocean Beach. Hayley Wingard, who was dressed as the Statue of Liberty, said she too had never been to a protest before. Only recently she began to view Trump as a “dictator.” “I was actually OK with everything until I found that the military invasion in Los Angeles and Chicago and Portland — Portland bothered me the most, because I'm from Portland, and I don't want the military in my cities. That's scary,” Wingard said. Salt Lake City demonstrators gathered outside the Utah State Capitol to share messages of hope and healing after a protester was fatally shot during the city’s first “No Kings” march in June. And more than 1,500 people gathered in Birmingham, Alabama, evoking and the city’s history of protests and the critical role it played in the Civil Rights Movement two generations ago. “It just feels like we’re living in an America that I don’t recognize,” said Jessica Yother, a mother of four. She and other protesters said they felt camaraderie by gathering in a state where Trump won nearly 65% of the vote last November. “It was so encouraging,” Yother said. “I walked in and thought, ‘Here are my people.’” Organizers hope to build opposition movement “Big rallies like this give confidence to people who have been sitting on the sidelines but are ready to speak up,” Democratic U.S. Sen. Chris Murphy said in an interview with The Associated Press. While protests earlier this year — against Elon Musk's cuts and Trump’s military parade — drew crowds, organizers say this one is uniting the opposition. Top Democrats such as Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and Independent Sen. Bernie Sanders are joining what organizers view as an antidote to Trump's actions, from the administration's clampdown on free speech to its military-style immigration raids. More than 2,600 rallies were planned Saturday, organizers said. The national march against Trump and Musk this spring had 1,300 registered locations, while the first...","summary":"People carrying signs with slogans such as “Nothing is more patriotic than protesting” or “Resist Fascism\" packed into New York City’s Times Square","url":"https://www.deccanchronicle.com/world/americas/no-kings-protests-against-trump-bring-street-party-vibe-to-cities-1911202","image":"https://www.deccanchronicle.com/h-upload/2025/10/19/1969111-aa-5777008.webp","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-10-19 00:51:48","author":null,"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"in","sentiment":-0.016},{"id":370531080,"title":"State Department Alerts: Potential Ceasefire Breach by Hamas Threatens Palestinian Civilians","text":"On Saturday, the U.S. Department of State issued a warning about “credible reports” indicating that Hamas might violate the current peace agreement with an intended assault on Palestinian civilians.\n\nIn a statement released on social media, the department emphasized, “This planned attack against Palestinian civilians would represent a severe breach of the ceasefire agreement and jeopardize the substantial progress made through diplomatic efforts.

He's the brash chef who serves £700 gold-encrusted steaks to A-listers, but now ex-employees are making damaging claims about a toxic culture at his theatrical restaurant empire","text":"Just two years ago, Nusret Gokce had never had it so good. The most famous – and richest – butcher on the planet, he flitted round the world in his eight-seater private jet, cigar in hand, and counted Leonardo DiCaprio, Mark Wahlberg, Roger Federer and rapper Drake as friends.\n\nThe source of his vast wealth, a dining empire consisting of 31 restaurants across the globe, was flourishing and he was an internet phenomenon thanks to his distinctive salt-sprinkling technique.\n\nIt was first showcased in a 36-second clip titled ‘Ottoman Steak’ that went viral in 2017. Dressed in his now-iconic dark sunglasses, white T-shirt and black trousers, the then little-known Turkish restaurateur dramatically sliced through a boned steak before performing his signature flourish: grabbing a generous pinch of rock salt, raising his muscular arm high, and letting it cascade down his forearm on to the meat below.\n\nWhen singer Bruno Mars tweeted the video, it had 2.4 million views overnight and within days, Gokce was reborn as the global meme ‘Salt Bae’.\n\nHe wasted no time cashing in on his fame. Within a year, the diminutive chef had opened the restaurant NusR-et in Miami, followed swiftly by two others: New York in 2018 and London in 2021.\n\nAs his profile rocketed he added outposts in Beverly Hills, Dallas, Las Vegas, Dubai, Qatar, Abu Dhabi and Mykonos, Greece. A-listers flocked to meet him, including David Beckham, Jason Statham, Naomi Campbell, Snoop Dogg, Lionel Messi and Donald Trump Junior.\n\nBut it seems that Salt Bae’s 15 minutes of fame may be at an end. This month it emerged that his American empire is collapsing: His US business posted losses of £5.4million last year and, of his seven American steakhouses, just two remain – branches in Midtown Manhattan and Miami.\n\nYet in the eyes of many friends and former staff, his fall from grace was inevitable.\n\nEmbittered ex-employees paint him as a ruthless and greedy boss, who demanded massages from female staff and charged obscene prices for mediocre food, while other critics have accused him of developing a ‘god complex’.\n\nA high-profile friendship with disgraced rapper P Diddy only added to a sense that fame went to Gokce’s slickly ponytailed head.\n\nAnd his restaurants have been dogged by a series of lawsuits.\n\nThe recipe for Gokce’s success was simple. NusR-et offered vulgar excess: extortionately priced meat with a side of showmanship.\n\nOn the menu at the opening of his swish London restaurant was a chargrilled tomahawk steak wrapped in 24-carat gold leaf priced at more than £700. There was also ‘meat spaghetti’ – thin strips of steak designed to be eaten like pasta – for £95 and a gold-leaf hamburger for £100. Desserts included a £50 baklava, again wrapped in gold.\n\nGokce, 42, gained a name for theatrically carving steaks with a sword before feeding a slice to his guest from the blade’s tip. Diners queued in the hope of being granted a few moments with him.\n\nIn reality, that experience was reserved for the lucky ones. He would spend the start of the week in Turkey, working the lunch service in his home city of Istanbul before dinner in Ankara.\n\nHe would then travel to Dubai, where he would spend Thursdays and Fridays, before returning to Istanbul on Saturday and then jetting to Miami on Sunday. By 2023, however, the first cracks started to appear in the international chain Gokce had created with such speed. He was facing several active lawsuits, with others quietly settled. In London, former staff described being forced to work gruelling hours for a boss who would fire people on the spot for the smallest infractions. And in New York, employees complained of unpaid overtime and accused managers of skimming their tips.\n\nGokce’s lawyer dismisses the accusations, saying: ‘High-profile restaurants and popular chefs are often targets for salacious and meritless claims.’\n\nBut The Mail on Sunday last week spoke to a former worker at one of his US restaurants whose testimony bore out previous complaints about Gokce’s behaviour.\n\nSpeaking on condition of anonymity, she said: ‘It was very intense. They expected you to work very long hours and everything was extremely strict.\n\n‘One time I got in trouble for drinking water. If you needed to go to the toilet, you needed to make it extremely quick.\n\n‘That culture came from him. It was hostile and intimidating. He would make very strange requests, like getting employees to give him foot massages while the dinner service was underway.’\n\nShe added: ‘He’s very full of himself. He interviewed me personally and asked if I wanted to take a picture with him. He thought anyone would want a selfie or an autograph. A lot of time he’d be shooting content for his social media.\n\n‘After almost every dinner shift there would be a woman waiting for him at the end of the day – often different girls.’\n\nShe also accused him of money-grabbing stunts. ‘He would raise the prices or add more gimmicky things,’ she said. ‘They decided to stick gold paper on to the steaks and sell them for hundreds of dollars more. Just because it was wrapped in this cheap edible gold foil. Business went slow after that photo of Salt Bae with Nicolas Maduro [the despotic ruler of Venezuela]. And they started getting more and more desperate for sales.’\n\nVideos emerged in 2018 of Gokce and Maduro at NusR-et in Istanbul. The chef served the tyrant and his wife Cilia Flores before Gokce and Maduro smoked cigars and posed for photos.\n\nAs Venezuela was in the grip of a devastating food crisis, with millions struggling to afford basic goods let alone red meat, Gokce suffered a furious backlash when he posted clips of the encounter online to his millions of followers.\n\nBy the time he deleted them, the damage was done. Protests erupted outside his Miami restaurant and Senator Marco Rubio condemned him for ‘feeding a dictator while Venezuelans starved’.\n\nTroubling claims of a toxic workplace culture first emerged in a 2021 court case in New York.\n\nFormer bartender Elizabeth Cruz filed a discrimination suit against Gokce, alleging she was demeaned on her first day at his Manhattan restaurant in 2019. According to her Supreme Court filing, a manager told her to go home and change into ‘short skirt, high heels and a revealing top’ after she arrived in the standard uniform of ‘long pants, a button-down shirt, an apron and a tie’.\n\nMs Cruz, from the Dominican Republic, said she was ‘degraded, offended, humiliated and sexually harassed’ by the remark.\n\nThe case dragged on until May 2023, when a judge ordered both parties to enter into private arbitration. The outcome of that has not been made public.\n\nBut while his restaurants have long been under fire from former staff, Gokce has faced growing scrutiny over company he keeps.\n\nVideos from US rapper DJ Khaled’s birthday party in June 2017 show Gokce consorting with disgraced Sean ‘Diddy’ Combs.\n\nIn December 2017, Combs flew Gokce to his mansion to cook dinner for him, friends and family. ‘My brother Salt Bae,’ Diddy says, as the two men embrace and clink glasses. The chef was flown in again later that month for the rapper’s New Year’s Eve party in Miami.\n\nIn 2018, Combs and Gokce appeared together at a Dubai nightclub opening and in 2022, the music mogul was pictured at NusR-et in London.\n\nOn Instagram, Gokce gushed over his famous friend: ‘A serial entrepreneur, GOAT [greatest of all time] of music and entertainment industry, a genius and a true friend. Happy birthday king. Love you.’\n\nGiven what happened next, this soon looked like a colossal error of judgment.\n\nDiddy’s girlfriend singer Cassie Ventura launched a bombshell lawsuit which became one of the most talked-about cases in America.\n\nThis month Diddy was jailed for four years for prostitution-related offences and handed a $500,000 fine after what the court heard was the ‘savage’ abuse of Cassie.\n\nHe was acquitted of more serious charges of sex trafficking and racketeering but prosecutors claimed women were drugged and secretly filmed having sex at Combs’ celebrity parties, often attended by global stars.\n\nIt’s possible Gokce didn’t know about the impending legal storm when hanging out with Diddy but at the time of writing, the chef, who regularly uses Instagram and has 52 million followers, still counts Diddy’s as one of the 380 accounts he follows on the app.\n\nGokce also attracted controversy for his infamous appearance at the 2022 World Cup final in Qatar. As Argentina celebrated their victory, Gokce slipped past security and on to the pitch.\n\nIn a bizarre show of hubris, he posed for photos, grabbed players by the arm and kissed the World Cup trophy, despite strict FIFA rules allowing only winners, officials and heads of state to touch it.\n\nAt one point, he repeatedly tried to pull Lionel Messi into a selfie as the bewildered Argentine captain tried to celebrate with teammates.\n\nThe footage quickly went viral, sparking outrage among fans and officials. FIFA swiftly launched an investigation into how he gained access to the pitch and Gokce later apologised, insisting he had been ‘carried away by the excitement’.Asked why he did it, Gokce said: ‘There were two billion people watching the World Cup… how many people are speaking about me? Five billion. The whole world.’\n\nMany might argue that these are the actions of a man swept up by a world he never grew up in.\n\nGokce is one of five children born to a miner and a housewife in the poor north-eastern Turkish city of Erzurum, where average incomes are around £6 a day.\n\nMoney was so tight that when he was growing up, Gokce wore ‘someone else’s clothes, two sizes too big’. By his own account, he left school early to help support the family, taking work in local meat shops where he first learned his butchery skills.\n\nDetermined to better himelf, in 2007 he obtained a bank loan and flew to Argentina – with its huge beef industry – to work in steakhouses and study how chefs there prepared and presented meat.\n\nWhen he was satisfied he had picked up enough experience, he returned to Turkey in 2010 and opened his first restaurant in Istanbul, a tiny venture with just eight tables.\n\nToday he has a net worth in the tens of millions, owns a £1million car collection including two Rolls-Royces worth at least £250,000 each, which he keeps in Dubai and Miami, and a speedboat for cruising Turkey’s Bosphorus. Oh, and there’s that private jet.\n\nGokce has also quietly built up an impressive property portfolio. In 2019, he bought the historic Macka Palas building in Istanbul for around £42.5million.\n\nThe property, which houses the Park Hyatt Istanbul hotel, includes a lavish penthouse featuring a rooftop pool, spa and views over the Bosphorus, which serves as Gokce’s personal residence.\n\nOutside Turkey, Gokce is reported to have bought a £1.8million white-washed villa on the Greek island of Mykonos as a holiday home, later spending about £850,000 more on renovations.\n\nHis latest acquisition is a sprawling ‘residential and dining complex’ in a prime location on the Spanish island of Ibiza, complete with apartments and restaurants.\n\nAccording to reports, work on the complex got under way in 2023 and is still unfinished.\n\nBut when completed it will include 51 residential units, 80 underground parking spaces and four gourmet restaurants – one of them, of course, an outpost of NusR-et.\n\nOne two-bedroom apartment in the complex, which went on sale early this year, has been listed at £1.5million.\n\nNo one could deny that the canny Gokce has made the most of his viral moment eight years ago.\n\nBut if it teaches us anything, it’s that, while all fame is fleeting, social media stardom is the most fickle of all.","summary":"Nusret Gokce had it so good.

There were marching bands, a huge banner with the U.S. Constitution's \"We The People\" preamble that people could sign, and demonstrators wearing inflatable costumes, particularly frogs, which have emerged as a sign of resistance in Portland, Oregon.\n\nIt was the third mass mobilization since Trump's return to the White House and came against the backdrop of a government shutdown that not only has closed federal programs and services but is testing the core balance of power, as an aggressive executive confronts Congress and the courts in ways that protest organizers warn are a slide toward authoritarianism.\n\nTrump himself was spending the weekend at his Mar-a-Lago home in Florida.\n\n\"They say they're referring to me as a king. I'm not a king,\" Trump said in a Fox News interview that aired early Friday, before he departed for a $1 million-per-plate MAGA Inc. fundraiser at his club.\n\nLater Friday a Trump campaign social media account mocked the protests by posting a computer-generated video of the president clothed like a monarch, wearing a crown and waving from a balcony.\n\nNationwide demonstrations\n\nPeople packed into New York City's Times Square, Boston Common and Chicago's Grant Park; outside state capitols in several Republican-led states and a courthouse in Billings, Montana; and at hundreds of smaller public spaces.\n\nIn Washington, Iraq War Marine veteran Shawn Howard said he had never participated in a protest before but was motivated to show up because of what he sees as the Trump administration's \"disregard for the law.\" He said immigration detentions without due process and deployments of troops in U.S. cities are \"un-American\" and alarming signs of eroding democracy.\n\n\"I fought for freedom and against this kind of extremism abroad,\" said Howard, who added that he also worked at the CIA for 20 years on counter-extremism operations. \"And now I see a moment in America where we have extremists everywhere who are, in my opinion, pushing us to some kind of civil conflict.\"\n\nIn San Francisco hundreds of people spelled out \"No King!\" and other phrases with their bodies on Ocean Beach. Hayley Wingard, who was dressed as the Statue of Liberty, said she too had never been to a protest before. Only recently she began to view Trump as a \"dictator.\"\n\n\"I was actually OK with everything until I found that the military invasion in Los Angeles and Chicago and Portland - Portland bothered me the most, because I'm from Portland, and I don't want the military in my cities. That's scary,\" Wingard said.\n\nSalt Lake City demonstrators gathered outside the Utah State Capitol to share messages of hope and healing after a protester was fatally shot during the city's first \"No Kings\" march in June.\n\nAnd more than 1,500 people gathered in Birmingham, Alabama, evoking and the city's history of protests and the critical role it played in the Civil Rights Movement two generations ago.\n\n\"It just feels like we're living in an America that I don't recognize,\" said Jessica Yother, a mother of four. She and other protesters said they felt camaraderie by gathering in a state where Trump won nearly 65% of the vote last November.\n\n\"It was so encouraging,\" Yother said. \"I walked in and thought, 'Here are my people.'\"\n\nOrganizers hope to build opposition movement\n\n\"Big rallies like this give confidence to people who have been sitting on the sidelines but are ready to speak up,\" Democratic U.S. Sen. Chris Murphy said in an interview with The Associated Press.\n\nWhile protests earlier this year - against Elon Musk's cuts and Trump's military parade - drew crowds, organizers say this one is uniting the opposition. Top Democrats such as Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and Independent Sen. Bernie Sanders are joining what organizers view as an antidote to Trump's actions, from the administration's clampdown on free speech to its military-style immigration raids.\n\nMore than 2,600 rallies were planned Saturday, organizers said. The national march against Trump and Musk this spring had 1,300 registered locations, while the first \"No Kings\" day in June registered 2,100.\n\n\"We're here because we love America,\" Sanders said, addressing the crowd from a stage in Washington. He said the American experiment is \"in danger\" under Trump but insisted, \"We the people will rule.\"\n\nRepublican critics denounce the demonstrationsRepublicans sought to portray protesters as far outside the mainstream and a prime reason for the government shutdown, now in its 18th day.\n\nFrom the White House to Capitol Hill, GOP leaders called them \"communists\" and \"Marxists.\" They said Democratic leaders including Schumer are beholden to the far-left flank and willing to keep the government shut to appease those liberal forces.\n\n\"I encourage you to watch - we call it the Hate America rally - that will happen Saturday,\" said House Speaker Mike Johnson of Louisiana.\n\n\"Let's see who shows up for that,\" Johnson said, listing groups including \"antifa types,\" people who \"hate capitalism\" and \"Marxists in full display.\"\n\nMany demonstrators, in response, said they were meeting such hyperbole with humor, noting that Trump often leans heavily on theatrics such as claiming that cities he sends troops to are war zones.\n\n\"So much of what we've seen from this administration has been so unserious and silly that we have to respond with the same energy,\" said Glen Kalbaugh, a Washington protester who wore a wizard hat and held a sign with a frog on it.\n\nNew York police reported no arrests during the protests.\n\nDemocrats try to regain their footing amid shutdown\n\nDemocrats have refused to vote on legislation that would reopen the government as they demand funding for health care. Republicans say they are willing to discuss the issue later, only after the government reopens.\n\nThe situation is a potential turnaround from just six months ago, when Democrats and their allies were divided and despondent. Schumer in particular was berated by his party for allowing an earlier government funding bill to sail through the Senate without using it to challenge Trump.\n\n\"What we are seeing from the Democrats is some spine,\" said Ezra Levin, a co-founder of Indivisible, a key organizing group. \"The worst thing the Democrats could do right now is surrender.\"\n\nAssociated Press journalists Gary Fields, Lisa Mascaro and Kevin Freking in Washington, Jill Colvin and Joseph Frederick in New York, Jeffrey Collins in Columbia, South Carolina, Hannah Schoenbaum in Salt Lake City, Terry Chea in San Francisco, Chris Megerian in West Palm Beach, Florida, Bill Barrow in Birmingham, Alabama, and Safiya Riddle in Montgomery, Alabama, contributed.","summary":"Protesting the direction of the country under President Donald Trump, people gathered Saturday in the nation's capital and communities big and small across the U.S. for \" No Kings \" demonstrations that the president's Republican Party disparaged as \"Hate America\" rallies.","url":"https://abc7.com/post/no-kings-protests-pres-donald-trump-bring-street-party-vibe-cities-nationwide/18035042/","image":"https://cdn.abcotvs.com/dip/images/18035078_101825-ap-no-kings-protests-us-img.jpg?w=1600","video":"https://vcl.abcotv.net/video/kgo/101825-kgo-4p-no-kings-national-vid.mp4","publish_date":"2025-10-19 00:27:16","author":"The Associated Press","authors":["The Associated Press"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.105},{"id":370533478,"title":"World News | US: Nationwide 'No Kings' Protests Target Trump Administration's Policies Amid Government Shutdown","text":"Washington [US], October 19 (ANI): A huge number of demonstrators gathered in cities and towns across the United States as part of the \"No Kings\" protests, a coordinated nationwide movement voicing strong opposition to President Donald Trump's administration and policies, CNN reported on Saturday (local time).\nAccording to CNN, more than 2,500 events took place in all 50 states, drawing large crowds in major urban centres and centres of communities alike.\nAlso Read | '67' Meme Takes Over Schools and Internet: From TikTok Viral Hit to South Park Parody, How a Random Number Became the Defining Joke of Gen Alpha's Brainrot Culture.\nThe protests were organised as a national day of action aimed at rejecting authoritarianism and defending democratic principles.\nWhile demonstrators expressed frustration over a wide range of Trump-era policies, several recurring themes emerged.\nAlso Read | Alaska Airlines Flight Diverts to Boise After Female Passenger Attacks Flight Attendants Mid-Air; Woman Arrested, Banned From Flying.\nAccording to CNN, concerns are over the erosion of democratic norms, outrage over aggressive immigration enforcement and ICE raids, the deployment of federal troops in US cities, and cuts to essential government programmes, especially in healthcare.\nIn Atlanta, protestors began the day at the city's Civic Centre before marching to the Georgia State Capitol, where they rallied under the \"No Kings\" banner, as reported by CNN.\nThe event emphasised a peaceful yet urgent call to safeguard American democracy and resist authoritarian leadership.\nLos Angeles also saw a significant turnout, with a particular focus on immigrant rights.

Email: money@mailonsunday.co.uk \nBy HOLLY MEAD \n Updated:01:20 BST, 19 October 2025 \n\nBarely a day goes by without another financial expert or major institution warning of a stock market downturn on the horizon.\nBank of England Governor Andrew Bailey warned this month that the risk was growing of a ‘sharp correction’ to stock markets, the International\nMonetary Fund said odds were rising of a ‘disorderly’ global correction, and the boss of JP Morgan, Jamie Dimon, said that he was ‘far more worried than others’.\nReasons for concern include the soaring value of artificial intelligence (AI) stocks – which some fear could be in bubble territory – spiralling government debt across the globe, and ongoing political tensions.\nInvestors wishing to protect themselves against what lies ahead face a challenge.\nFirst, trying to time the stock market is a fool’s errand, and it is virtually impossible to know when the next crash will come.\nThose who take dramatic steps, such as selling out, could come to regret it if stock markets continue to rise.\nFurthermore, if there is a crash it is hard to pre-empt how it would play out and which investments would be most affected.\n\nMonetary Fund said odds were rising of a ‘disorderly’ global correction, and the boss of JP Morgan, Jamie Dimon, said that he was ‘far more worried than others’\nHowever, there are some investments that experts believe are likely to fare less badly if there is a major market correction. Some could provide a safe haven for worried investors to stash their wealth in – and even offer some growth in the meantime.\nHowever, it is worth remembering that no asset type is guaranteed to be safe and no one can predict the future.\nSo one of the best insurance policies is spreading your money across different geographies, sectors and asset types, such as bonds, equities and property.\nThat way, you are not overly exposed to one area of the stock market if it suffers a large drop. It is unlikely that all of your holdings will fall dramatically at once, so you should be protected from the worst of it.\n‘Finding a true safe haven is extremely difficult. When markets panic and liquidity dries up, people will sell anything – even assets traditionally seen as safe,’ says Darius McDermott, managing director at investment firm FundCalibre. ‘Therefore, the best defence against a market retreat is genuine diversification across investment styles, themes and geographies.’\nHere are five ideas that could help to protect your portfolio in a market meltdown.\n\n1. Government bonds\nUS government bonds, known as Treasuries, are generally considered to be the ultimate safe haven, and are usually where investors flock in times of uncertainty.\nThat is because they are debt issued by the US Government and things would have to go very badly wrong for it to default and not pay back its lenders.\n\nThere may be some doubts over the state of Britain’s finances, but the Government has never yet defaulted on its debts, says James Harries, manager of the Troy Trojan fund\nThe bonds currently pay an attractive 4.25 per cent a year yield (or interest) over ten years. However, some investors are concerned that they are not as safe under Donald Trump’s administration as they used to be.\nDavid Coombs, head of multi-asset investments at investment firm Rathbones, believes that Treasuries deserve to keep their safe haven status, but he is also diversifying into other government bonds.\nThe appeal of these investments is that they pay a reliable income and, if they are issued by a financially robust government, are unlikely to fail.\n‘Given that we have a US President who tends to tweet on a Sunday night and cause all sorts of kerfuffles, we have been looking around the world to other safe haven countries and currencies,’ Coombs says.\n\n How to build a fortune in the booming commercial property sector \nHe owns bonds issued by the governments of Norway and Portugal, both of which he views as robust and unlikely to default on any debt. Switzerland and Singapore are other potential bond safe havens, but Coombs is not currently investing in these.\nAnd don’t forget UK Government bonds (or gilts), says James Harries, manager of the Troy Trojan fund. There may be some doubts over the state of Britain’s finances, but the Government has never yet defaulted on its debts.\nAn added attraction for investors who hold gilts directly is that any capital gains are tax-free. Ten-year gilts are currently paying a yield of 4.54 per cent.\nThese assets can be accessed through specific government bond funds or strategic bond funds.\nThe latter have the flexibility to invest in bonds issued by both companies and countries, according to where the manager spies the best opportunities.\nThe TwentyFour Dynamic Bond fund, for example, has about 20 per cent of its portfolio in government bonds, including those issued by the US and Germany. It is up 17 per cent over five years and currently yields 5.11 per cent a year.\nEren Osman, from Arbuthnot Latham, suggests the Vanguard UK Gilt exchange-traded fund (ETF) as a low-cost option which tracks an index of gilts. The fund, which charges just 0.05 per cent annually, currently yields about 4.5 per cent a year. However, because the prices at which bonds trade rises and falls, it is down in value 30 per cent over five years, although it has risen 1.9 per cent over the past year.\n\n2. All-weather firms\nThere are some products that people buy all the time.\nOne option is to identify the companies that make these products, as they are likely to prove resilient even in an economic downturn.\nJob Curtis, manager of the City of London investment trust, favours this approach.\n\nIt’s not just enough to identify all-weather companies. Job also looks for those with strong balance sheets that do not have too much debt, so they can weather a storm\nIn a downturn, he says: ‘Companies that are dependent on discretionary spending will suffer as people cut back, but we will all continue to go to the supermarket and buy everyday goods.’\nIt’s not just enough to identify all-weather companies. Job also looks for those with strong balance sheets that do not have too much debt, so they can weather a storm.\nHe also likes those that pay a reliable dividend because, in market slumps when share price growth is harder to come by, an income becomes even more attractive.\nHe likes Tesco, which is competitively priced and the biggest supermarket in the UK, with more than 28 per cent market share.\n‘The Clubcard gives it a big advantage,’ he says. ‘Tesco knows its customers better than any other supermarket.’\nUnilever, the company behind brands such as Dove, Domestos, Cif and Vaseline, is another favourite. It makes products that consumers continue to need regardless of the economic environment, and owns a stable of brands that customers tend to be loyal to.\nHarries agrees that looking for companies that produce a reliable income is a good approach.\nHe suggests the soft drinks company Pepsi, the healthcare group Coloplast, the food distribution firm Sysco and Guinness brewer Diageo.\n‘These are robust, solid businesses with identifiable, sustainable competitive advantages,’ he says. ‘They generate lots of cash, have sound management teams and do not have too much debt.’\n\nGold has had an incredible run in 2025, and is up 54 per cent so far this year, prompting some to ask whether it is in bubble territory.\nBut the precious metal still deserves a place in most investment portfolios, says Harries.\nGold has historically been viewed as an insurance policy for investors as it tends to rise in price during times of uncertainty.\nFor example, it gained about 25 per cent during the 2008 financial crisis and more than 30 per cent between 2018 and 2020 when markets wobbled.\n\nGold has had an incredible run in 2025, and is up 54 per cent so far this year, prompting some to ask whether it is in bubble territory \nThe main appeal of gold is as a physical store of value, which people flock to during difficult market conditions. However, it does have downsides – its price is largely driven by sentiment, which means it can be volatile, and it pays no income, so is less attractive when interest rates are high and investors can earn money on cash in the bank.\n‘But gold gives you a lot of protection, and you could still argue it has some catching up to do compared with other assets,’ says Harries.\nThe easiest way to invest is through an exchange-traded commodity (ETC), a low-cost fund that simply tracks the price of the metal. For example, the iShares Physical Gold ETC is up 108 per cent over five years and charges 0.12 per cent annually.\nIt is also possible to buy physical gold. Bullion from The Royal Mint starts at about £125 for the smallest 1g bar. But many UK investors prefer to invest in coins because they are exempt from capital gains tax due to their status as legal British currency.\nThere are plenty of other gold dealers, and most will store and insure it for you at a cost.\nPhysical gold is not regulated by the Financial Conduct Authority. That means the protections offered by the Financial Ombudsman Service and Financial Services Compensation Scheme are not applicable, so tread carefully before buying and check reviews on websites such as Trustpilot.\nIf you’re keeping gold at home, make sure you tell your home contents insurer and buy a safe.\n\n4. Multi-asset funds\nIn uncertain times, investors who don’t feel confident shifting their own portfolio can enlist an expert to do it for them.\nMulti-asset funds have the flexibility to invest in a range of investments, including equities, bonds and alternatives such as gold, property and infrastructure, depending on where the manager thinks the opportunities and risks lie.\n‘These flexible, all-weather strategies can be powerful anchors in volatile markets,’ says McDermott.\nHe likes the Orbis Global Balanced fund, which aims to balance capital growth with protecting against losses.\nTop holdings include a gold ETC, Icelandic government bonds and shares in the electronics giant Samsung and chipmaker Taiwan Semiconductor. It is up 112 per cent over five years.\nHe also rates the Aegon Diversified Monthly Income fund, which aims to provide a reliable dividend income as well as delivering capital growth.\nIts top holdings include UK Government bonds and US Treasuries, shares in software giant Microsoft and mining firm Rio Tinto, and Greencoat UK Wind, the renewable energy investment company.\nIt is up 37 per cent over five years, and currently yields almost 5.5 per cent.\n\nIf protecting your money from any loss is the priority then cash is worth considering, says Coombs.\n\nRemember that inflation is running at 3.8 per cent, so unless your savings account beats that you’re losing value in real terms\n\n‘Cash is not to be sniffed at. It’s not a strategic investment – you’re not there for the long term – but it’s a safe haven while the world melts down,’ he says.\nYou can get up to 4.51 per cent from an easy-access cash Isa. This top rate is currently paid by Trading 212, while Plum pays 4.45 per cent and Moneybox 4.38 per cent.\nWatch out for accounts with short-term bonuses, and either remember to switch when your rate falls or pick an account with a consistently good rate instead.\nRemember that inflation is running at 3.8 per cent, so unless your savings account beats that you’re losing value in real terms.\nInvestors could also consider a Money Market fund as a place to park their cash. These hold cash and cash-like investments such as bonds that will mature soon. These are low risk and should provide protection in a downturn.\nFor example, the Royal London Short Term Money Market fund is up 16 per cent over five years, and has an annual charge of just 0.1 per cent.\nA further advantage of keeping some of your money in cash is that it is ready to deploy when a new investment opportunity arises.\n‘Keeping some powder dry can be tactically advantageous, allowing flexibility for timely investments during market downturns,’ says McDermott.\n\n...And one to buy today\nThere are still opportunities that should deliver regardless of what is on the horizon and should be\n\n The outrageous reason why millions of victims of the car loan scandal may be unable to claim payouts \nrelatively unaffected by the global economy. McDermott suggests the Regnan Sustainable Water And Waste fund as one option.\nIt invests in companies set to benefit from long-term trends, including urbanisation, growing global wealth and improving infrastructure in developing markets, all of which drive the need for water supply and better management of waste.\nIts top holdings include the Brazilian waste management firm Sabesp, the British water supply firm Watts Water Technologies, and the American water tech firm Xylem. Some 60 per cent of the portfolio is in US stocks, with other investments in Japan, Europe and Asia.\nMcDermott says: ‘These companies operate largely at a local level, making them much less exposed to tariffs or geopolitical disruption.’ The fund, which was launched in 2021, has returned 35.7 per cent over five years.\n\nShare or comment on this article: \nFive safe haven investments if the global economy goes into meltdown (and one under the radar fund to buy RIGHT NOW): As more and more experts warn of a devastating fall in share prices...\n\nAdd comment\n\n Share what you think\n\nNo comments have so far been submitted.

(AP pic)\nWASHINGTON: Protesters spanning all age groups, many with children and pets in tow, took to the streets en masse for \"No Kings\" rallies across the US on Saturday, denouncing what they view as authoritarian tendencies and unbridled corruption of US President Donald Trump.\nOrganizers expected millions of people to turn out by day's end at more than 2,600 planned rallies in major cities, small towns and suburbs, challenging a Trump-led agenda that has reshaped the government and upended democratic norms with unprecedented speed since he took office in January.\nBy all accounts, the demonstrations were largely festive, many featuring inflatable characters and marchers dressed in red, white and blue. The demographically mixed crowds included many parents pushing youngsters in strollers alongside elderly participants.\nLittle, if any, lawlessness was reported.\n“There is nothing more American than saying, 'We don’t have kings’ and exercising our right to peacefully protest,” said Leah Greenberg, co-founder of Indivisible, a progressive organization that led planning of Saturday's events.\nThe New York Police Department said more than 100,000 people protested peacefully across all five boroughs and that the NYPD \"made zero protest-related arrests.\" Events in Boston, Chicago and Atlanta also drew crowds.\nThe protests reflected growing unease among many Americans, mainly on the ideological left, with developments such as the criminal prosecution of Trump's perceived political enemies, his militarised immigration crackdown and the sending of National Guard troops into US cities - a move Trump has said was aimed at fighting crime and protecting immigration agents.\nAs his administration has tried to rapidly implement its policies, Trump has installed inexperienced loyalists throughout the ranks of his administration and sought to apply pressure on the news media, law firms and higher education.\nThe rallies were boisterous but orderly, with police largely keeping a low profile.\nIn Washington, demonstrators filled the street as they marched toward the US Capitol, chanting and carrying signs, US flags and balloons. Many people - and their dogs - wore costumes in a relaxed, carnival-like atmosphere.\nProtester Aliston Elliot, wearing a Statue of Liberty headpiece and holding a \"No Wannabe Dictators\" sign, said: \"We want to show our support for democracy and for fighting (for) what is right. I'm against the overreach of power.\"\nIn downtown Houston, US Marine Corps veteran Daniel Aboyte Gamez, 30, joined a crowd that officials said numbered about 5,000 at city hall on Saturday afternoon.\n\"I don't understand what's going on in this nation right now,\" said Gamez, who served in Iraq, Afghanistan and Syria.\nKevin Brice, 70, a military veteran among thousands of protesters streaming into the riverfront area of Portland, Oregon, wore a black sweatshirt emblazoned with the slogan \"No Kings since 1776.\"\n“Everything that I thought that I stood for while I was serving in the military seems to be at risk,\" Brice said. \"So even though I’m a lifelong Republican, I don’t support the direction the party is going.”\nSteve Klopp, 74, a Houston-based oil industry retiree, expressed similar sentiments as he wore a shirt with the words \"Former Republican\" on it.\n\"I've been a Republican forever,\" Klopp said. \"My family's been Republican forever and ever. And the idea that one individual could have turned me away from the Republican Party is insane.\"\nKelly Kinsella, 38, standing among several thousand people gathered outside the Colorado statehouse in Denver, was dressed as the Statue of Liberty, with bloody tears dripping down her face, and carried a \"No Kings\" sign.\n“Everyone comes to work stressed, and it's because of the current conditions,\" said Kinsella, who said she was motivated to turn out largely because of renewed inflation that she blamed on Trump's tariff policies.\nTrump says he is not a king\nTrump has said little about Saturday’s protests. But in an interview with Fox Business aired on Friday he said that “they’re referring to me as a king - I’m not a king”.\nMore than 300 grassroots groups helped organise Saturday’s marches, Greenberg said. The American Civil Liberties Union said it provided legal guidance and \"de-escalation\" training to tens of thousands of people to act as marshals at the various marches.\nWhile the Democratic Party has coped with internal divisions over the best way to oppose Trump, party establishment figures such as Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and progressive firebrands like US Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez both voiced their support for the \"No Kings\" movement.\nSaturday's protests were aimed at building on grassroots momentum gained by organisers of some 2,000-plus \"No Kings\" protests that were staged on June14, coinciding with Trump's 79th birthday and a rare military parade in Washington.\nRepublicans claim protests are anti-American\nHouse of Representatives Speaker Mike Johnson, a Republican, on Friday echoed a common refrain among his party, labeling the \"No Kings\" protests \"the hate America rally\".\nOther Republicans have accused organizers of the rallies of stoking an atmosphere that might spur more political violence, especially in the wake of the September assassination of right-wing activist and Trump ally Charlie Kirk.\nDana Fisher, a professor at American University in Washington and author of several books on American activism, forecast that Saturday could see the largest protest turnout in modern US history.\nShe expected that over 3 million people would take part based on registrations and participation in the June events.\nOverall turnout for the June 14 \"No Kings\" rallies was estimated at 4 million to 6 million, according to a crowd-sourcing analysis published by the prominent data journalist G. Elliott Morris on his Strength in Numbers blog site.\nFisher said the protests were “not going to change Trump’s policies. But it might embolden elected officials at all levels who are in opposition to Trump”.","summary":"Protesters denounce what they view as the authoritarian tendencies and unchecked corruption of US President Donald Trump.","url":"https://www.freemalaysiatoday.com/category/world/2025/10/19/no-kings-protesters-emerge-en-masse-for-anti-trump-rallies","image":"https://www.freemalaysiatoday.com/cdn-cgi/image/quality=75,format=auto,fit=scale-down,dpr=1,width=1600,height=1000/https://media.freemalaysiatoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/36f1712d-ap25291681067722.webp","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-10-19 00:18:19","author":"Reuters","authors":["Reuters"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"my","sentiment":-0.097},{"id":370528294,"title":"State Department warns Hamas may violate ceasefire with attack on Palestinian civilians","text":"The U.S. Department of State on Saturday warned there are \"credible reports\" that Hamas may break the peace agreement with a \"planned attack\" on Palestinian civilians. \"This planned attack against Palestinian civilians would constitute a direct and grave violation of the ceasefire agreement and undermine the significant progress achieved through mediation efforts,\" the department said in a statement on social media. \"The guarantors demand Hamas uphold its obligations under the ceasefire terms.\" The statement concluded, \"The United States and the other guarantors remain resolute in our commitment to ensuring the safety of civilians, maintaining calm on the ground, and advancing peace and prosperity for the people of Gaza and the region as a whole.\" A ceasefire between Israel and Hamas went into effect last weekend after two years of war in the region following the Oct. 7, 2023, attacks in southern Israel. HAMAS DEFENDS EXECUTIONS OF PALESTINIANS AFTER TRUMP ISSUES STERN WARNING TO TERROR GROUP On Monday, the 20 remaining surviving Israeli hostages were returned to Israel per the agreement, but more than a dozen remains of hostages who were killed are still under Hamas control. The State Department added that \"measures will be taken to protect the people of Gaza and preserve the integrity of the ceasefire\" if Hamas proceeds with the attack. On Thursday, President Donald Trump issued a warning on Truth Social after footage circulated online showing Hamas fighters executing Palestinians in Gaza City’s main square. \"If Hamas continues to kill people in Gaza, which was not the deal, we will have no choice but to go in and kill them,\" he wrote. ISRAELI TROOPS 'OPEN FIRE' ON SUSPECTS WHO APPROACHED SOLDIERS IN NORTHERN GAZA According to Reuters, at least 33 people were executed by Hamas in recent days in what officials described as a campaign to \"show strength\" after the ceasefire.

The uplifted rubble is recycled after being pulverized to be further utilized in paving roads and building foundations for tents and interim facilities, as part of broader efforts to recycle resources and mitigate the environmental impact, Cilliers said.\n\nIn this regard, UNDP hopes that these efforts will pave the way for accelerating recovery projects, although officials warn that the operation will require much more resources and time.\n\nCilliers added that this process is extremely exhausting and will take many years to be completed.\n\nNoteworthy, a ceasefire deal between Hamas and Israel came into force in Egypt's Sharm El-Sheikh city on Oct. 10, following the approval of the Israeli occupation government and the initiation of its forces' pullback from populated sites in the enclave.\n\nThis was marked by the return of displaced people to northern Gaza and the implementation of the term related to the prisoner swap deal within the first phase of US President Donald Trump's initiative to end the two-year-old war.

This warning comes amid the fragile peace established to halt the ongoing conflict.\n\nSuch an act, if it occurs, would represent a severe and direct violation of the ceasefire agreement brokered by former President Donald Trump, which sought to bring an end to the two-year conflict between Israel and Hamas. The specifics of the potential threat remain undisclosed at this time.\n\nThe State Department emphasized that any aggressive move by Hamas would trigger actions aimed at safeguarding Gaza’s civilian population and maintaining the ceasefire’s integrity. “Should Hamas proceed with this attack, measures will be taken to protect the people of Gaza and preserve the integrity of the ceasefire,” their statement reiterated.\n\nIn a previous social media post, Trump issued a stark warning to Hamas, stating that continued violence in Gaza would leave the U.S. with no alternative but to intervene decisively. “If Hamas continues to kill people in Gaza, which was not the Deal, we will have no choice but to go in and kill them,” Trump wrote.\n\nHowever, the former president later clarified his stance, assuring that he would not deploy U.S. troops to Gaza, despite his earlier threats. This clarification aims to de-escalate tensions while emphasizing the importance of respecting the ceasefire terms.\n\nThe U.S. president later clarified he won’t send U.S. troops into Gaza after launching the threat against Hamas.\n\n“It’s not going to be us,” he told reporters. “We won’t have to.

Newsom wants people to think this is an absurd show of force. The Marine Corps says it’s part of routine training at Camp Pendleton.\n\n'If Gavin Newsom wants to oppose the training exercises that ensure our Armed Forces are the deadliest and most lethal fighting force in the world, then he can go right ahead.' \n\nThe highway closures on Saturday caused around an hour of delays and led to huge lines of drivers sat in traffic. \n\nGregory Dreibelbis, a spokesman for the 1st Marine Expeditionary Force at Camp Pendleton said practice fire of M777 Howitzers was tested at a nearby beach on Friday evening to make sure it was safe. \n\n'M777 artillery pieces have historically been fired during routine training from land-based artillery firing points west of I-5 into impact areas east of the interstate within existing safety protocols and without the need to close the route,' Dreibelbis said. \n\nHe described the move as an 'established and safe practice.' \n\nOceanside’s assistant police chief John McKean added to the LA Times that although authorities did not expect the artillery fire to hit traffic, the dramatic move could still distract motorists. \n\n'It’s not like they’re going to get hit by explosives or anything like that, it’s just loud booms, and it may frighten [drivers when the rounds are] going to go off, because it’s going to be going off for about a good 15 or 20 minutes,' McKean said. \n\nThe artillery fire event was attended in California by Vance, who told Marines in a speech to around 15,000 servicemen that the US would 'always need' their 'warrior spirit.' \n\nVance also remarked on the ongoing government shutdown, telling recruits that 'despite the Schumer Shutdown, (Trump) is going to do everything he can to make sure you get paid exactly as you deserve.","summary":"The California Governor branded the plan 'profoundly absurd' and said it was a 'show of force that could put Californians directly in harm's way.'","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-15205369/Gavin-Newsom-California-highway-artillery-fire-marines-JD-Vance.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/10/19/00/103109759-0-image-m-44_1760830954790.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-10-18 23:46:31","author":"Editor,Will Potter","authors":["Editor","Will Potter"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.357},{"id":370525534,"title":"About 7 million people took part in nationwide No Kings protest in US — organizers","text":"NEW YORK, October 19. /TASS/.

On Thursday, it had said the crossing likely would reopen on Sunday.\n\nHamas has now handed over the remains of 12 of the 28 dead hostages in Gaza, a key step in the week-old ceasefire process meant to end two years of war. The militant group says devastation and Israeli military control of certain areas of Gaza have slowed the handover.\n\nThe statement by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office on the Rafah crossing came shortly after the Palestinian embassy in Egypt said it would reopen on Monday for people returning to Gaza. Hamas called Netanyahu's decision a violation of the ceasefire deal.\n\nThe Rafah crossing has been closed since May 2024, when Israel took control of the Gaza side. A fully reopened crossing would make it easier for Gazans to seek medical treatment, travel or visit family in Egypt, home to tens of thousands of Palestinians.\n\n Anxiety on both sides over remains \n\n Israel has been returning the bodies of Palestinians with no names, only numbers. Gaza's Health Ministry posts photos of them online, hoping families will come forward.\n\n\"Just like they took their captives, we want our captives. Bring me my son, bring all our kids back,\" said a tearful Iman Sakani, whose son went missing during the war. She was among dozens of anxious families waiting at Nasser hospital.\n\nOne woman knelt, crying over a body after identifying it.\n\nAs part of the ceasefire agreement, Israel on Saturday returned 15 bodies of Palestinians to Gaza, bringing the total it has returned to 135.\n\nMeanwhile, Gaza's ruins were being scoured for the dead. Newly recovered bodies brought the Palestinian toll above 68,000, according to Gaza's Health Ministry. Thousands of people are still missing, according to the Red Cross.\n\nThe ministry, part of the Hamas-run government, does not distinguish between civilians and combatants in its count. But the ministry maintains detailed casualty records that are seen as generally reliable by UN agencies and independent experts. Israel has disputed them without providing its own toll.\n\nHamas-led militants killed around 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and abducted 251 people in the attack on southern Israel that sparked the war on October 7, 2023.\n\n A push for hostages' remains\n\n Israel also said the remains of a 10th hostage that Hamas handed over on Friday were identified as Eliyahu Margalit. The 76-year-old was abducted from kibbutz Nir Oz during the October 7 attack. His remains were found after bulldozers plowed areas in the southern city of Khan Younis.\n\nUS President Donald Trump has warned that he would greenlight a resumption of the war by Israel if Hamas does not return the remains of all dead hostages.\n\nHamas has said it is committed to the ceasefire deal, but that the retrieval of remains is also hampered by the presence of unexploded ordnance in the territory's vast ruins.\n\nThe Israeli organisation supporting families of those abducted said it will continue holding weekly rallies in Tel Aviv until all are returned.\n\n\"We don't want to go back to fighting, God forbid, but this whole ordeal must end, and all the hostages must be returned,\" said Ifat Calderon, aunt of freed hostage Ofer Calderon.\n\n Aid remains limited \n\n Hamas has urged mediators to increase the flow of aid into Gaza as closures of crossings and Israeli restrictions on aid groups continue.\n\n\"Vast parts of the city are just a wasteland,\" UN humanitarian chief Tom Fletcher said on Saturday while visiting Gaza City, where international food security experts declared famine earlier this year.\n\nUN data on Friday showed 339 trucks have been offloaded for distribution in Gaza since the ceasefire began. Under the agreement, about 600 aid trucks per day should be allowed to enter.\n\nCOGAT, the Israeli defense body overseeing aid in Gaza, reported 950 trucks -- including commercial trucks and bilateral deliveries -- crossing on Thursday and 716 on Wednesday, the UN said.\n\nIsrael has said it let in enough food and accused Hamas of stealing much of it, which the UN and other aid agencies deny.\n\n Hamas accuses Israel of violations \n\nHamas again accused Israel of continuing attacks and violating the ceasefire, asserting that 38 Palestinians had been killed since it began. There was no immediate response from Israel, which still maintains control of about half of Gaza.\n\nOn Friday, Gaza's Civil Defense, first responders operating under the Hamas-run Interior Ministry, said nine people were killed, including women and children, when their vehicle was hit by Israeli fire in Gaza City. The Civil Defense said the car crossed into an Israeli-controlled area in eastern Gaza.\n\nIsrael's army said it saw a \"suspicious vehicle\" crossing the so-called yellow line and approaching troops. It said it fired warning shots, but the vehicle continued to approach in a manner that posed an \"imminent threat.\" The army said it acted in accordance with the ceasefire.","summary":"Hamas has now handed over the remains of 12 of the 28 dead hostages in Gaza","url":"https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/israel-says-hamas-hands-over-2-coffins-of-deceased-hostages-to-red-cross-in-gaza/article70180532.ece","image":"https://th-i.thgim.com/public/incoming/ktr4kn/article70180644.ece/alternates/LANDSCAPE_1200/Israel_Palestinians_59989.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-10-18 23:24:46","author":null,"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"in","sentiment":-0.401},{"id":370522570,"title":"Bill Maher says Trump deserves ‘credit’ for Gaza peace deal","text":"Late-night host Bill Maher is giving credit “where credit is due,” congratulating President Donald Trump on brokering the Gaza peace deal.

I mean, a lot of people tried to pull this off. He did,” Maher said Friday.\n\nEarlier this month, the White House finalized an agreement between Israel and Hamas to end years of conflict in Gaza.

I mean, if there’s one thing he’s good at, it’s sending people back where they came from,” the host joked.\n\nHis quip referred to Trump’s latest push to deport illegal immigrants convicted of crimes out of the United States.\n\nEarlier this month, Hamas released the final 20 living hostages and began returning the bodies of those killed.

Gavin Newsom and the White House. The event — titled \"America’s Marines 250: From Sea to Shore: A Review of Amphibious Strength\" — featured a range of festivities at the Marine Corps base, including a large-scale live-fire demonstration that was attended by Vice President JD Vance. Newsom blasted the display of military power as \"dangerous\" and \"an absurd show of force,\" announcing on Saturday that a section of Interstate 5 near the base would be temporarily closed during the celebration. \"Because of the Trump Admin’s plans, drivers should expect delays on Interstate 5 and other state routes throughout Southern California before, during and after the event,\" Newsom posted to X.

Earlier in the week, the California governor called the anniversary celebration a \"vanity parade.\" \"Donald Trump and JD Vance think that shutting down the I-5 to shoot out missiles from ships is how you respect the military,\" Newsom posted to X Wednesday, while reposting an X post from left-leaning outlet MeidasTouch that claimed the White House planned to close parts of the I-5 during the event. \"PUT ASIDE YOUR VANITY PARADE AND PAY OUR TROOPS INSTEAD.\" However, William Martin, special assistant to the president and communications director to the vice president, quickly pushed back against Newsom. \"This is complete fake news,\" Martin declared in a post on X, which was reposted by the @VP X account. \"The Marine Corps said they are NOT shutting down the I-5 highway and that the event at Camp Pendleton is a training exercise.

Since then, Trump has deployed National Guard troops to Washington, D.C., and Memphis, Tennessee, and attempted to deploy troops to Portland, Oregon, and Chicago.\n\nRecent court cases determined that Trump has the authority to federalize the National Guard but not necessarily to deploy the guard, with further decisions in those cases to come.\n\nChicago Mayor Brandon Johnson (center) speaks during the “No Kings” national day of protest at Grant Park in Chicago on October 18.

It’s why we join our A.G. [Attorney General] and cities around the country in court against this administration’s illegal attempts to roll back our rights,” Wu, the first woman and woman of color to serve as mayor of the city, said.\n\nBoston Mayor Michelle Wu speaks at a “No Kings” national day of protest in Boston on October 18.

We will never surrender.”\n\n“Throughout history, we have learned that tyranny doesn’t arrive with dramatic proclamations: Most times, it comes quietly, wrapped in the language of law and order, with fingers pointed at someone who doesn’t look like you, promising safety while demanding we sacrifice our neighbors,” he continued.\n\n“Today we are here to say with one voice that there is a threat to our constitutional republic. This is not a political choice – this is a moral imperative,” he added. Pritzker also marched with the protesters, joining them at one point in a chant of “Hey, hey, ho, ho, Donald Trump has got to go.”\n\nCleveland Mayor Justin Bibb addressed the crowd in his city, asking if the crowd believed in “freedom in this city.”\n\n“If we learned from this last election, we cannot afford to sit on the couch.

Demonstrations took place in New York, Washington DC, Chicago, Miami, Los Angeles, and other major cities. In New York City, Times Square saw thousands of people holding signs that read slogans like, “Democracy not Monarchy” and “The Constitution is not optional.” Protesters Call For Peace And Democracy Organizers said that the rallies were meant to be peaceful. The No Kings movement, which coordinated the protests, urges participants to avoid confrontations. In New York, chants of “this is what democracy looks like” were frequent, accompanied by drums, cowbells, and noisemakers. Police reported over 100,000 people participated across the city’s five boroughs, with no arrests made related to the protests. Many protesters expressed concern about what they see as Trump’s overreach of presidential power. Actions cited included executive orders that block Congress-approved funding, deploying the National Guard to cities, and imposing tariffs. Beth Zasloff, a protester in New York, said she joined because she feared a “move toward fascism and an authoritarian government.” Protests were not limited to the US demonstrations also took place in European cities, including Berlin, Madrid, Rome, and London, showing solidarity with American protesters. In Toronto, demonstrators waved signs such as “Hands off Canada” near the US consulate. Political Leaders Join March Several Democratic leaders joined the protests. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer participated in New York, holding a sign calling for healthcare reform. In Washington DC, Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders addressed the crowd, saying, “We’re not here because we hate America, we’re here because we love America.” Some Republican governors activated National Guard troops ahead of the protests. Texas Governor Greg Abbott and Virginia Governor Glenn Youngkin placed troops on standby, though their presence at protests was limited or not visible. Democrats criticized the move as an unnecessary show of force.

US Warns Hamas May Be Planning Attack in Gaza","text":"The United States has said it has received \"credible reports\" suggesting that Hamas may violate the current ceasefire in Gaza with an attack targeting Palestinian civilians. In a statement on Saturday, the US State Department warned that any such assault \"would constitute a direct and grave violation\" of the agreement brokered by President Donald Trump to end the two-year conflict between Israel and Hamas. No additional details were provided about the alleged threat. \"Should Hamas proceed with this attack, measures will be taken to protect the people of Gaza and preserve the integrity of the ceasefire,\" the department said. The department further added: \"The United States and the other guarantors remain resolute in our commitment to ensuring the safety of civilians, maintaining calm on the ground, and advancing peace and prosperity for the people of Gaza and the region as a whole.\" Also Read: Israel-Hamas Ceasefire - What Comes Next After Egypt Summit President Trump earlier cautioned on social media that \"if Hamas continues to kill people in Gaza, which was not the Deal, we will have no choice but to go in and kill them.\" He later clarified, however, that he did not intend to deploy US forces. \"It's not going to be us,\" Trump told reporters. \"We won't have to. There are people very close, very nearby that will go in and they'll do the trick very easily, but under our auspices.\" This comes at a time when Israel said the Rafah border crossing between Gaza and Egypt will remain closed \"until further notice\". Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, too, reiterated that the war in Gaza would end only after Hamas disarms, according to news agency AFP. Netanyahu said that the completion of the second phase of the ceasefire was essential to ending the fighting in Gaza. \"Phase B also involves the disarming of Hamas - or more precisely, the demilitarisation of the Gaza Strip, following the stripping of Hamas of its weapons,\" the Israeli PM said. He added that when that is \"successfully completed\", the war would end \"hopefully in an easy way, but if not, in a hard way.\" To date, Hamas has handed over 10 hostages' bodies, with the Palestinian group saying it would return two more bodies Saturday night, news agency AP reported.","summary":"President Trump earlier cautioned on social media that \"if Hamas continues to kill people in Gaza, which was not the Deal, we will have no choice but to go in and kill them.\"","url":"https://www.timesnownews.com/world/middle-east/us-hamas-planning-attack-in-gaza-israel-ceasefire-donald-trump-article-153021480","image":"https://images.timesnownews.com/thumb/msid-153021479,thumbsize-195440,width-1280,height-720,resizemode-75/153021479.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-10-18 23:08:04","author":"Rounak Bagchi","authors":["Rounak Bagchi"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"in","sentiment":-0.09},{"id":370523268,"title":"Netanyahu Says Rafah Crossing Will Remain Closed Until Further Notice","text":"Shortly after the Palestinian embassy in Cairo, Egypt announced that the main Egypt-Gaza crossing point will be open on Monday, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu announced it “will not be opened until further notice.”\n\nThe announcement comes over a week after Hamas and Israel agreed to President Donald Trump’s 20-point Gaza peace plan, and amid rising tensions and reports of alleged violations of the agreement on both sides.\n\nIn a statement obtained by Reuters late on Saturday, Hamas said Netanyahu’s decision “constitutes a blatant violation of the ceasefire agreement and a repudiation of the commitments he made to the mediators and guarantor parties.”\n\nWhy It Matters\n\nTrump’s proposal marks the most substantial effort yet toward a lasting agreement in the over two-year-long war, after earlier deals yielded only temporary cease-fires. Trump has been applauded by Israelis and Palestinians on the matter, as well as world leaders, however, there is concern that it may unravel.\n\nHamas attacked Israel on October 7, 2023, and took around 250 hostages, and their release has been a central tenet of the peace agreement. All living hostages were handed over to Israel early Monday, and as of Saturday afternoon 12 of the 28 dead hostages in Gaza have been recovered, according to the Associated Press.\n\nSince October 2023, Israel’s ground and air offensives in Gaza have displaced more than 2 million people and killed more than 68,000 Palestinians, according to the AP. Israel, which controls aid into Gaza, has repeatedly halted and blocked entry points, which critics have called inhumane leverage. The United Nations reported in August that more than half a million people in Gaza “are trapped in famine, marked by widespread starvation, destitution and preventable deaths.”\n\nWhat To Know\n\nIsrael’s announcement comes as it was widely believed that the crossing would reopen in the coming days. The Rafah crossing has largely been closed since May 2024, with some exceptions, and is essential for food and medical aid, as well as Palestinian mobility. Its closure blocks hundreds of trucks from entering and providing food aid to thousands of returning Palestinians. \n\n“Its opening will be considered based on the manner in which Hamas fulfills its part in the return of the deceased hostages and in implementing the agreed-upon framework,” Netanyahu said.\n\nThe continued closure of the Rafah crossing is preventing delivery of equipment needed to find dead hostages and will therefore delay recovery efforts, Hamas said, according to Reuters.\n\nHamas handed over the 12th hostage body on Saturday, with Israel currently having identified 10 of them. So far, Israel has returned 135 bodies of Palestinians to Gaza as part of the ceasefire agreement, according to the AP.\n\nAccusations of violations of the agreement have circulated from both sides, with Gaza’s media office accusing Israel of 47 violations resulting in killing 38 Palestinians and wounding 143 since early October.\n\nOn Saturday night, the U.S. State Department wrote in a social media post, “The United States has informed the guarantor nations of the Gaza peace agreement of credible reports indicating an imminent ceasefire violation by Hamas against the people of Gaza.”\n\nEgyptian Red Crecent members monitor trucks carrying humanitarian aid as they enter the Rafah crossing between Egypt and the Gaza Strip, following an agreement between Israel and Hamas on a ceasefire, Sunday, Oct. 12, 2025. (AP Photo/Mohamed Arafat)\n\nWhat People Are Saying\n\nThe U.S. Department of State said in an X post on October 18: “This planned attack against Palestinian civilians would constitute a direct and grave violation of the ceasefire agreement and undermine the significant progress achieved through mediation efforts. The guarantors demand Hamas uphold its obligations under the ceasefire terms. Should Hamas proceed with this attack, measures will be taken to protect the people of Gaza and preserve the integrity of the ceasefire.”\n\nTom Fletcher, U.N. humanitarian chief, told CBC on October 17 about his visit to Rafah: “It was quite an emotional visit for me. Because for months and months, our supplies have been piling up. And we’ve been desperate to get them moving, desperate to see those lorries heading into Gaza…We want to see Rafah opened. We want to see all the crossings opened. You know, aid can never be a bargaining chip. That’s not just me saying that. That’s the rules.

Millions of Americans gathered in cities across the country on Saturday to protest Trump's sweeping, second-term agenda. While marching through Times Square with almost two weeks until Election Day, New York City voters explained why they are voting for Mamdani for mayor. \"He represents everything they're not,\" Edgar, a New York City voter who lives in Rockaway Beach, Queens, told Fox News Digital. Edgar explained that democracy is \"under attack,\" and New York City needs a leader, like Gov. Gavin Newsom, D-Calif., to similarly fight back against the Trump administration. FINAL STRETCH: MAMDANI'S LARGE LEAD SHRINKING AS CUOMO GAINS GROUND IN NYC MAYORAL RACE Mamdani himself has applauded Newsom's leadership rejecting Trump's second-term through judicial action, particularly when Trump sent the National Guard to Los Angeles during protests rejecting U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement deportations. Trump has since sent the National Guard to major cities, including Washington, D.C., Chicago, Portland, Oregon, and Memphis, Tennessee, to combat crime. He has also threatened to cut federal funding to New York City if Mamdani is elected mayor. \"I don't think he's afraid of Trump in the least,\" Gail Kelly, a lawyer who lives in Breezy Point, Queens, who said she is voting for Mamdani, told Fox News Digital in Times Square. Kelly said she is \"tired\" of former Gov. Andrew Cuomo, who lost the Democratic primary to Mamdani in June and is now running as an independent candidate, said she is \"not that thrilled with Curtis Sliwa,\" the Republican nominee. NEW POLLS REVEAL MAMDANI HAS COMMANDING LEAD OVER RIVALS WEEKS FROM ELECTION DAY Brad, another Mamdani voter who lives in Gowanus, Brooklyn, and attended Saturday's \"No Kings\" rally, said Trump and Cuomo are \"fascists.\" \"Cuomo is a fascist as well,\" Brad said. \"He is also a sexual abuser. Mamdani, honestly, I don't know if he's got good ideas. I don't think a lot of ideas are gonna work, but he's got optimism, he cares about the people in the city, he cares about people's lives. That's good enough.\" Cuomo resigned as New York governor in 2021 following multiple sexual harassment allegations that he has denied. Rich Azzopardi, a Cuomo campaign spokesperson, fired back at Brad's charge when reached for comment. \"Andrew Cuomo passed a $15 minimum wage, paid family leave, made marriage equality the law of the land, made college tuition free for nearly 80 percent of CUNY students and protected a women’s right to choose by codifying Row vs. Wade into state law. Whomever said that clearly doesn’t know what any of that word salad means. Send me their address, I’ll be happy to send them a dictionary on me,\" Azzopardi said. Annelice Morales, a Mamdani voter who lives on Manhattan's Upper East Side, said Mamdani's transparency is refreshing. \"I just think people, like Cuomo, have been in power for a really long time, and they abuse power,\" Morales told Fox News Digital while marching in the \"No Kings\" rally. Morales said she \"100%\" hopes Mamdani will fight back against Trump. \"He has a message to improve lives, the material needs of the New Yorkers,\" Lenny, a Lower East Side resident who is voting for Mamdani in November, said on Saturday. When asked if he wants Mamdani to fight back against Trump, Lenny said, \"Just uphold the law. It's that simple.\" Mamdani has a 21-point lead among New York City registered voters: 49% back Mamdani, while 28% go for Cuomo and 13% favor Sliwa, according to the latest Fox News poll. Voters will elect a new mayor of New York City on Nov. 4 as Mayor Eric Adams suspended his re-election campaign last month. While those who spoke to Fox News Digital at Saturday's \"No Kings\" rally in Manhattan said they were voting for Mamdani in the upcoming election, the democratic socialist candidate did not advertise that he was attending. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Mamdani's campaign did not respond to inquiries about whether he was attending any \"No Kings\" rallies. Meanwhile, Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., who has endorsed and campaigned for Mamdani, headlined a \"No Kings\" rally in Washington, D.C., on Saturday. Fox News Digital reached out to the White House for comment but did not immediately hear back.","summary":"Protesters at Manhattan&apos;s &quot;No Kings&quot; rally explain their support for mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani as New York City prepares for the November election.","url":"https://www.foxnews.com/politics/nyc-voters-no-kings-rally-say-zohran-mamdani-represents-everything-trump-not","image":"https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2025/10/register-to-vote-mamdani.png","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-10-18 23:02:44","author":"Andrew Miller,Deirdre Heavey","authors":["Andrew Miller","Deirdre Heavey"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.023},{"id":370527596,"title":"Result expected in confidence vote on Oxford Union president-elect","text":"The result of a confidence vote on the Oxford Union’s incoming president George Abaraonye – who faced controversy over comments about the killing of US campaigner Charlie Kirk – is expected on Sunday.\n\nThousands of members of the Oxford Union were eligible to take part, including voting in person between 10am and 8pm on Saturday.\n\nMembers were also able to vote by proxy on Friday with a 10pm deadline.\n\nExtraordinary returning officer Donovan Lock will be responsible for the counting of the votes, “which shall be done as soon as practicable after the close of the poll”, according to the Oxford Union regulations document.\n\nThe result is expected on Sunday, although how and when this will happen remains unclear.\n\nMr Abaraonye said in an Instagram post that he had submitted a motion of confidence in himself in an attempt to reclaim “true accountability and (reaffirm) that the Oxford Union must remain a place where students can make mistakes, apologise sincerely, and learn from them”.\n\nIn another post published on Saturday, Mr Abaraonye told union members: “Today is your opportunity to affirm Free Speech, to stand against the racism of the Far Right, and to stand up for the principles the Union has championed for 200 years.\n\n“Two centuries later, the same people who claim to believe in the Union are now acting in stark opposition to the Union’s founding principles, by supporting a campaign of harassment, censorship, and abuse.

Instead of addressing the protestors’ main concern—President Donald Trump’s numerous abuses of power—Republicans have targeted the movement with over-the-top attacks.\n\nThe GOP smears “No Kings”\n\nHouse Speaker Mike Johnson has insisted that the anti-Trump rallies are evidence of a “hate America” movement and are part of a supposed “pro-Hamas wing” of the Democratic Party. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy complained in one Fox News interview that the rallies would feature “paid protestors” and members of the “antifa” movement.\n\nThese descriptions defy reality. The previous “No Kings” protests, which occurred in June, brought out an estimated 4-6 million people peacefully expressing their dissent, a far cry from the GOP’s nightmarish demagoguery.\n\nThe latest round of smears echoes previous Republican arguments depicting their political opposition as terrorists or allied with terrorists.\n\nThe smear isn’t new\n\nTrump loves to use this tactic.\n\nDuring the 2024 election cycle, Trump wasn’t satisfied with merely expressing his opposition to the Democratic Party. Instead, he insisted that an “enemy within” the country was a threat. Trump argued that the “enemy within” was such a problem that the “radical left lunatics” who were a part of it might need to be “handled” by the military and National Guard—a preview of his current policy.\n\nYears before that, in his first term, Trump promoted the false notion that public protests against him and investigations of his wrongdoing were the work of the so-called deep state. This theory, cribbed from fellow conspiracy theorists like Alex Jones, argues that entrenched bureaucracy is opposing his agenda and destabilizing the government, and that it is in cahoots with the Democratic Party and progressive movement.\n\nTrump and his acolytes are not alone in embracing this tactic and rhetoric.\n\nIn 2005, as the United States was deeply engaged in the Iraq War, then-President George W. Bush’s senior adviser Karl Rove made a similar charge. In a speech, Rove said, “Liberals saw the savagery of the 9/11 attacks and wanted to prepare indictments and offer therapy and understanding for our attackers.” \n\nThis was meant to characterize opposition to the war as giving aid and comfort to the al-Qaida terrorist group.\n\nIn reality, there was no connection between the Iraqi government and the 9/11 attacks, nor was the Middle Eastern nation in possession of weapons of mass destruction, which the Bush administration used to justify the war. The fearmongering was the product of disinformation by Rove, Bush, and others in the administration. \n\nSmears instead of an argument\n\nEquating political opposition with terrorism is part of the Republican scheme to squelch dissent and stigmatize those who deviate from GOP orthodoxy.\n\nThe party’s strategy against dissent can also be seen in its effort to gerrymander congressional districts in a manner that overrepresents Republicans in Congress. The same tactic was also recently showcased when the Trump-appointed head of the Federal Communications Commission sought to silence comedian Jimmy Kimmel, who regularly mocks Trump.\n\nBy invoking terrorism where it doesn’t exist, the GOP is nakedly attempting to deflect the public attention from the opposition’s arguments, without the party having to honestly confront and rebut them.\n\nConservatism’s support for violence and fakery\n\nAll the while, the conservative movement often has an element of fakery and extremism attached to it.\n\nIn the 2010s, the “tea party” movement meant to oppose the actions of the Obama administration were depicted as grassroots. But much of it was funded by wealthy Republican donors, like the Koch brothers, who sought to decrease government oversight of their business empires.\n\nConservatism, led by Trump at the moment, has regularly embraced bigoted stunts. And Trump allies himself with violent groups like the Proud Boys, infamously telling them in 2020 to “stand back and stand by.”\n\nRepublicans have struggled to persuade a majority of the public to embrace their extremist agenda. While the party has had success at winning elections, most people support a safety net, oppose racism and misogyny, and don’t want the government intruding on their personal lives.\n\nInstead of working to get voters on board with its far-right agenda, Republicans find it easier to brand peaceful, pro-democracy protesters as the real terrorists.\n\nBut that doesn’t make it true.","summary":"Explaining the Right is a weekly series that looks at what the right wing is currently obsessing over, how it influences politics—and why you need to know.\n\n\n\n\nRepublican lawmakers have been in overdrive the past two weeks, lashing out against Saturday’s “No Kings” protests.

THE DEAD HAVE NOT BEEN RETURNED, AS PROMISED!’\n\nEarlier this year, the terror group claimed to have handed over the body of Shiri Bibas, one of the hostages, but it was later confirmed to belong to a Palestinian.\n\nUnder Donald Trump’s 20-point peace plan, announced on Monday, Hamas was required to release all hostages, dead or alive, as a key condition of the deal. \n\nThe group’s failure to deliver the bodies sparked fears the fragile peace agreement could already be in jeopardy, with Israeli officials accusing Hamas of deliberately withholding the remains. \n\nEarlier this week, Israel refused to increase aid deliveries into Gaza after Hamas had released just eight bodies by Tuesday. \n\nPrime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu ruled out doubling the number of aid trucks, citing the group’s violation of the agreement.\n\nHamas was expected to hand over all 28 deceased hostages alongside 20 survivors by midday Monday. \n\nWhile the release of the living captives brought relief, only four bodies were initially returned – followed by another four last night.\n\nThe shortfall provoked fury in Israel, where the failure to recover the dead has been seen as a deep affront, given the central importance of burial rites in Judaism.\n\nOn Monday, Donald Trump brokered the landmark peace deal between Israel and Hamas, aimed at ending the devastating Gaza war that has killed tens of thousands and created a humanitarian disaster.\n\nIn emotional scenes, freed captives were reunited with their families, parents, and friends, some embracing through tears after years of fear and uncertainty.\n\n‘After so many years of unceasing war and endless danger, today the skies are calm, the guns are silent and the sirens are still,’ Donald Trump said in a historic speech at the Knesset, Israel’s parliament.\n\nBut the ordeal of two years in captivity was clear despite the celebrations – many hostages appeared frail and emaciated, bearing little resemblance to photos taken before their abduction on October 7, 2023.\n\nBehind the smiles, their physical and emotional scars offered a stark reminder of the suffering endured since that day.\n\nOn Thursday, the US President issued a stark warning to the group after it was caught executing fellow Palestinians amid the ceasefire with Israel.\n\n‘If Hamas continues to kill people in Gaza, which was not the Deal, we will have no choice but to go in and kill them,’ the President posted to Truth Social. ‘Thank you for your attention to this matter!’ \n\nHamas had previously returned four deceased hostages on Monday, who were later identified as Guy Illouz, 26, Bipin Joshi, 23, Yossi Sharabi, 53, and Daniel Peretz, 22.\n\nFour more bodies were handed over on Tuesday, with three of them having been identified as Uriel Baruch, 35, Tamir Nimrodi, 18, and Eitan Levi, 53.\n\nBut Israel has said the fourth ‘does not match any of the hostages’.\n\nHamas’ failure to immediately provide the remains of all of the 28 deceased hostages has led to fears the peace deal is already at risk.\n\nA spokesperson from the Hostages and Missing Families Forum told the Daily Mail: ‘Following the return of the last 20 live hostages on Monday, devastating testimonies are emerging – of people being caged, chained, starved, and having bags placed over their heads for extended periods.\n\n‘Every new account reveals yet another layer of deliberate psychological; and physical cruelty.\n\n‘Hamas used systematic torture and psychological terror as weapons of war to dehumanise, humiliate, and destroy.\n\n‘Today, we know that the remaining hostages still held in Gaza are no longer alive. For their families, the nightmare is far from over – many fear their loved ones’ bodies may be lost forever in Gaza.\n\n‘The world must confront the full horror of Hamas’ actions and stand with the families to demand the return the body of every last hostage, so they can finally be laid to rest in Israel, with dignity, and provide closure for the families.’\n\nBodies recovered in the ruins of Gaza since the ceasefire process began have brought the Palestinian death toll to above 68,000, according to the country’s Hamas-run health ministry.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nIsrael has announced the receipt of two more bodies of hostages from&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Israel Recovers Two More Bodies of Hostages from October 7 Incident, Intensifying International Focus first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/news/israel-recovers-two-more-bodies-of-hostages-from-october-7-incident-intensifying-international-focus/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Israel-has-received-two-further-bodies-of-October-7-hostages.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-10-18 22:41:16","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.357},{"id":370516134,"title":"Thousands Participate In 'No King' Protests Against Trump Across US, Europe, Canada","text":"Thousands of people on Saturday gathered across several cities in US such as New York, Washington DC, Chicago, Miami and Los Angeles, in Canada and across Europe to protest against US President Donald Trump’s policies.\nIn New York, Beth Zasloff, a freelance writer and editor, was quoted by BBC as saying that she feels outraged and distressed at what she called a “move toward fascism and an authoritarian government” happening in the Trump administration.\nNew York City’s iconic Times Square, streets and subway entrances were densely packed with people holding up signs with slogans like, “Democracy not Monarchy” and “The Constitution is not optional”.\nAccording to BBC, the group stated that non-violence is a core principle of No Kings events and urged all participants to de-escalate potential altercations.\nThe protests were joined by several political leaders as well.\nAccording to BBC, Senate Minority Leader and New York Democrat Chuck Schumer also joined in the protest.\n“We have no dictators in America. And we won’t allow Trump to keep eroding our democracy,” he wrote on X. He also shared photos of himself holding up a sign that read “fix the health care crisis”.\nIn Washington DC, Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders said: “We’re not here because we hate America, we’re here because we love America.”\nCNN quoted one of the protesters, retired government worker Peggy Cole of Flint, Michigan, as saying that she feels it’s a “scary time,” citing President Donald Trump’s rhetoric toward Democrats, arguing that he should be a president for all Americans.\n“It seems to me, (Trump is) taking our government, our democracy, and dismantling it piece by piece, slowly, but surely. If we sit by and don’t do anything about it,” Cole said.\n“I think our democracy is at risk, and I think that that’s extremely distressing, and that’s why we’re here,” Elizabeth Nee, 25, from Maryland, told CNN.\nIn Los Angeles, a crowd of people were seen with American flags and signs saying “we are the Constitution.”\nCNN reported people dressed in an array of colorful costumes, from fictional characters like Cookie Monster and unicorns to sharks, a frog and a dinosaur.\nSince returning to the White House, Trump has embraced an expansive view of presidential power, using executive orders to block funding approved by Congress and dismantle parts of the federal government, to introduce sweeping tariffs on other countries, and to deploy national guard troops to cities despite objections by state governors, BBC reported.\nTrump defended his actions as necessary to rebuild a country in crisis and dismissed claims he’s a dictator or fascist as hysterical.\nMassimo Mascoli, a 68-year-old retired electronic engineer and resident of New Jersey who grew up in Italy, said: “I am the nephew of an Italian hero that deserted the Mussolini army and joined the resistance. He was tortured and killed by the fascists, and after 80 years, I didn’t expect to find fascism again in the United States.”\n“We cannot count on the Supreme Court, we cannot count on the government. We cannot count on the Congress. We have all the legislative, the executive and judiciary that are all against the American people right now. So we are fighting,” he added.\nThe “No King” protests were also held throughout in Europe and Canada.\nIn Toronto, demonstrators near the US consulate general waved signs including “Hands off Canada”.\nAhead of the protests, Trump’s supporters had accused the protesters of being linked with the far-left Antifa movement, and condemned what they called “the hate America rally”.\nMeanwhile, in an interview with Fox News, Trump said: “A king! This is not an act. You know – they’re referring to me as a king. I’m not a king.”\nAccording to BBC, Texas Governor Greg Abbott on Thursday activated the state’s National Guard ahead of a protest scheduled in Austin, the state’s capital.\nHe said the troops would be needed due to the “planned antifa-linked demonstration”.\nCriticising the move, Democrats denounced the move, including the state’s top Democrat Gene Wu said: “Sending armed soldiers to suppress peaceful protests is what kings and dictators do – and Greg Abbott just proved he’s one of them.”\nLike Texas, Virginia’s Republican Governor Glenn Youngkin has also ordered the state National Guard to be activated.","summary":"Thousands protested Trump’s policies in US cities, Canada, and Europe, with leaders like Chuck Schumer and Bernie Sanders joining.","url":"https://www.news18.com/world/thousands-participate-in-no-king-protests-against-trump-across-us-europe-canada-ws-l-9645839.html","image":"https://images.news18.com/ibnlive/uploads/2025/10/Untitled-design-96-2025-10-76cdcb254f8b6e37baef7bf45a6bd6b3.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-10-18 22:40:53","author":"News18,Ranu Joardar","authors":["News18","Ranu Joardar"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"in","sentiment":0.074},{"id":370521760,"title":"‘No Kings’ protests against Trump bring a street party vibe to cities nationwide","text":"Protesting the direction of the country under President Donald Trump, people gathered Saturday in the nation’s capital and communities big and small across the U.S. for “No Kings” demonstrations that the president’s Republican Party disparaged as “Hate America” rallies.\n\nWith signs such as “Nothing is more patriotic than protesting” or “Resist Fascism,” in many places, the events looked more like a street party. There were marching bands, a huge banner with the U.S. Constitution’s “We The People” preamble that people could sign, and demonstrators wearing inflatable costumes, particularly frogs, which have emerged as a sign of resistance in Portland, Oregon.\n\nIt was the third mass mobilization since Mr. Trump’s return to the White House and came against the backdrop of a government shutdown that not only has closed federal programs and services but is also testing the core balance of power, as an aggressive executive confronts Congress and the courts in ways that protest organizers warn are a slide toward authoritarianism.\n\nPresident Trump himself was spending the weekend at his Mar-a-Lago home in Florida.\n\n“They say they’re referring to me as a king. I’m not a king,” the president said in a Fox News interview that aired early Friday, before he departed for a $1 million-per-plate MAGA Inc. fundraiser at his club.\n\nLater Friday, a Trump campaign social media account mocked the protests by posting a computer-generated video of the president clothed like a monarch, wearing a crown and waving from a balcony.\n\nNationwide demonstrations\n\nPeople packed into New York City’s Times Square, Boston Common, and Chicago’s Grant Park; outside state capitols in Tennessee and Indiana, and a courthouse in Billings, Montana; and at hundreds of smaller public spaces. More than 2,600 rallies were planned on the day, organizers said.\n\nMany protesters said that they were angered by attacks on their motives. In Washington, Brian Reymann said being called a terrorist all week by Republicans was “pathetic.”\n\n“This is America. I disagree with their politics, but I don’t believe that they don’t love this country,” Mr. Reymann said, carrying a large U.S. flag. “I believe they are misguided. I think they are power-hungry.”\n\nMore than 1,500 people gathered in Birmingham, Alabama, evoking and openly citing the city’s history of protests and the critical role it played in the Civil Rights Movement two generations ago.\n\n“It just feels like we’re living in an America that I don’t recognize,” said Jessica Yother, a mother of four. She and other protesters said they felt camaraderie by gathering in a state where Trump won nearly 65% of the vote last November.\n\n“It was so encouraging,” Ms. Yother said. “I walked in and thought, ‘Here are my people.’”\n\nIn San Francisco, hundreds of people spelled out “No Kings” and other phrases with their bodies on Ocean Beach. Salt Lake City demonstrators gathered outside the Utah State Capitol to share messages of hope and healing after a protester was fatally shot during the city’s first “No Kings” march in June.\n\nOrganizers hope to build an opposition movement\n\n“Big rallies like this give confidence to people who have been sitting on the sidelines but are ready to speak up,” Democratic U.S. Sen. Chris Murphy said in an interview with The Associated Press.\n\nWhile protests earlier this year — against Elon Musk’s cuts and Mr. Trump’s military parade — drew crowds, organizers say this one is uniting the opposition. Top Democrats such as Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and Independent Sen. Bernie Sanders are joining what organizers view as an antidote to Mr. Trump’s actions, from the administration’s clampdown on free speech to its military-style immigration raids.\n\n“We’re here because we love America,” Senator Sanders said, addressing the crowd from a stage in Washington. He said the American experiment is “in danger” under President Trump. But he insisted, “We the people will rule.”\n\nThe national march against Mr. Trump and Mr. Musk this past spring had 1,300 registered locations, while the first “No Kings” day in June registered 2,100.\n\nRepublican critics denounce the demonstrations\n\nRepublicans sought to portray protesters as far outside the mainstream and a prime reason for the government shutdown, now in its 18th day.\n\nFrom the White House to Capitol Hill, GOP leaders called the protesters “communists” and “Marxists.” They said Democratic leaders, including Senator Schumer, are beholden to the far-left flank and willing to keep the government shut to appease those liberal forces.\n\n“I encourage you to watch — we call it the Hate America rally — that will happen Saturday,” said Republican House Speaker Mike Johnson of Louisiana.\n\n“Let’s see who shows up for that,” Mr. Johnson said, listing groups including “antifa types,” people who “hate capitalism,” and “Marxists in full display.”\n\nMany demonstrators, in response, said they were meeting such hyperbole with humor, noting that Mr. Trump often leans heavily on theatrics such as claiming that cities he sends troops to are war zones.\n\n“So much of what we’ve seen from this administration has been so unserious and silly that we have to respond with the same energy,” said Glen Kalbaugh, a Washington protester who wore a wizard hat and held a sign with a frog on it.\n\nNew York police reported no arrests during the city’s protests.\n\nDemocrats try to regain their footing amid shutdown\n\nDemocrats have refused to vote on legislation that would reopen the government as they demand funding for health care. Republicans say they are willing to discuss the issue later, only after the government reopens.\n\nThe situation is a potential turnaround from just six months ago, when Democrats and their allies were divided and despondent. Senator Schumer, in particular, was berated by his party for allowing an earlier government funding bill to sail through the Senate without using it to challenge President Trump.\n\n“What we are seeing from the Democrats is some spine,” said Ezra Levin, a co-founder of Indivisible, a key organizing group. “The worst thing the Democrats could do right now is surrender.”\n\nThis story was reported by The Associated Press.\n\nAssociated Press journalists Matt Brown, Lisa Mascaro, and Kevin Freking in Washington, Jill Colvin and Joseph Frederick in New York, Jeffrey Collins in Columbia, South Carolina, Hannah Schoenbaum in Salt Lake City, Chris Megerian in West Palm Beach, Florida, Bill Barrow in Birmingham, Alabama, and Safiya Riddle in Montgomery, Alabama, contributed.","summary":"Saying U.S. President Donald Trump is testing the nation’s balance of power, protesters gathered in the nation’s capital and across the U.S. for “No Kings” demonstrations.","url":"https://www.csmonitor.com/USA/Politics/2025/1018/no-kings-protests-peaceful?icid=rss","image":"https://images.csmonitor.com/csm/2025/10/1201159_1_NKINGSPIC_standard.jpg?alias=standard_1200x800","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-10-18 22:38:25","author":"Mike Pelosi And Gary Fields","authors":["Mike Pelosi And Gary Fields"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.245},{"id":370532706,"title":"Leftist Protesters Spotted Wearing Frog, Cat, Dinosaur Costumes at 'No Kings' Protests","text":"Leftist protesters were spotted wearing inflatable frog, cat and dinosaur costumes during “No Kings” protests held at various locations around the United States on Saturday.\n\nIn a video posted to X by USA Today, one person was seen wearing a Halloween-like mask while holding a sign with the words, “It’d be less scary with us in office instead.” Behind that person was someone wearing a skull ghost Halloween mask.\n\nTwo people wearing inflatable dinosaur costumes with pink “No Kings” signs were also seen in the video.\n\nIn the video, another person can be seen wearing an inflatable cat costume.\n\nIn a post on X, Andrew Roth, a reporter with the Michigan Advance, shared several photos of protesters dressed in what appeared to be inflatable unicorn and cookie monster costumes during the “No Kings” protest in Lansing, Michigan.\n\nSenate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY), Sen.

ABC moderator David Muir immediately fact-checked him, claiming, “President Trump, as you know, the FBI says overall violent crime is coming down in this country … ”\n\nNearly every major media outlet echoed that narrative. National Public Radio ran the headline “Violent crime is dropping fast in the U.S.—even if Americans don’t believe it.” The Wall Street Journal declared, “Violent Crime Rate Falls Sharply After Pandemic Surge.” Vox insisted, “Violent crime is plummeting.” Axios reported, “New data shows violent crime dropping sharply in major U.S. cities.”\n\nHowever, a new Bureau of Justice Statistics report, which includes data through 2024, shows that Trump was right during the debate when he said, “Crime here is up and through the roof.” The National Crime Victimization Survey shows violent crime surged 59%, with rape and sexual assault up 67%, robbery up 38%, and aggravated assault up 62%. That’s the largest four-year increase in the survey’s 52-year history.\n\nThe contrast with Trump’s first term is stark. The National Crime Victimization Survey data shows that between 2017 and 2020, violent crime fell 15%, including a 6% drop in robbery and a 24% decline in aggravated assault. Although rape and sexual assault rose slightly, the increase was less than 10% of what occurred under former President Joe Biden.\n\nThe federal government tracks crime in two main ways. The FBI’s Uniform Crime Reports count the number of offenses reported to police each year. The Bureau of Justice Statistics’ National Crime Victimization Survey, by contrast, annually asks about 240,000 people living in the United States whether they were crime victims. The latter method captures both reported and unreported incidents.\n\nLast year, the media focused almost entirely on the FBI data.\n\nBefore 2020, the FBI and the Bureau of Justice Statistics trends generally moved in tandem. Since then, they’ve diverged sharply: The FBI reports fewer crimes, while more Americans say they’ve been victimized. Unreported crime was always a factor—and the reasons for it vary. They range from people reluctant to report being victimized by loved ones to a simple aversion by undocumented people to involve themselves with the criminal justice system.\n\nIn recent years, however, another factor appears to have skewed the FBI data: the breakdown of law enforcement in this country. When people believe police won’t catch or prosecutors won’t punish criminals, they’re simply less likely to report crimes. Between 2010 and 2019, victims reported 63.3% of violent crimes to police. In the last three years, that number plummeted to 48.8%. Arrests fell as well—from 26.5% before COVID-19 to just 16.6% afterward.\n\nOther factors also distort the FBI data. Many big-city police departments, such as D.C., have reclassified serious offenses, apparently in an effort to make the streets seem safer than they are. Downgrading aggravated assaults to simple assaults removes them from the FBI’s violent crime statistics, for example. Whether an attack counts as “aggravated” often depends on whether a weapon was used—but many progressive district attorneys now refuse to pursue weapons charges. That difference matters because the NCVS asks victims directly whether a weapon was involved, even if police reports omit it.\n\nProgressive prosecutors in cities like New York, Chicago, and Los Angeles have also made a habit of reducing felony charges. In Manhattan, for example, the district attorney’s office downgraded felonies 60% of the time—with 89% downgraded to misdemeanors and 11% to less serious felonies. Chicago has labeled some murders as “death investigations” rather than homicides. These practices appear to be spreading, and police may now be adjusting their own reports to reflect prosecutors’ leniency.\n\nThe latest federal data expose a stark reality: Violent crime has surged dramatically despite claims to the contrary. The growing gap between reported crimes and actual victimization reflects both a breakdown in law enforcement and the deliberate downgrading of offenses by progressive prosecutors. Until the justice system restores accountability and accurate reporting, Americans will continue to face rising violence that the FBI’s official statistics fail to capture.\n\nWe publish a variety of perspectives.

Thousands protest President Donald Trump at 'No Kings' rallies across Berkshire County","text":"PITTSFIELD — Thousands gathered across Berkshire County Saturday for the second round of national \"No Kings\" protests to stand up against President Donald Trump. \n\nThe Berkshire rallies were held in conjunction with 2,600 planned demonstrations across the nation. Millions of people showed up to challenge Trump's attacks on higher education, attempts to prosecute political enemies, immigration raids and attempts to have the National Guard police cities. \n\nAt The Common in Pittsfield, protesters were split between lining the streets and holding signs to passing traffic, while others gathered by the stage to listen to speakers, chants and musical performances.\n\nRobin O'Herin, an organizer with Stand Up Berkshires, said whenever people come together in solidarity with one another, like they did Saturday, she is excited.\n\n\"Action is the antidote to fear, it’s the only way,\" O'Herin said. \"We are saying no kings, yes to democracy, yes to freedom.\"\n\nSeveral protesters wore inflatable animal costumes, referencing an anti-ICE protester in Portland, Ore., who went viral after being pepper-sprayed while wearing an inflatable frog costume. It inspired others to wear similar costumes through a movement called Operation Inflation, which hopes to lower the political temperature through humor. \n\n\"It looks funny to try to paint anti-fascist frogs as a threat,\" said Amber LaPointe, 28, who wore a frog costume at the Pittsfield rally.\n\nThough LaPointe and others have found ways to find joy in their resistance, she said that doesn't take away from how serious the current state of democracy is. \n\n\"I’m here to use my voice because we are losing all our rights,\" LaPointe said. \"Jokes lower the tension, but it is important to be serious and know that what is happening is very real.\"\n\nA majority of the thousands of attendees held handmade signs. Some said \"No Kings,\" while others were more unique, like \"Alexa, change the president\" and \"I like my democracy neat, no ICE.\"\n\nEmily Day, 60, of Pittsfield, held a sign that said \"The best Tylenol is Rapid Release the Epstein Files\" — a nod to Trump's claim that Tylenol causes autism and the continued call to release the files related to convicted sex offender Jefferey Epstein, who died in 2019. \n\nShe said she decided to spend her Saturday protesting to express her displeasure with what the federal government is doing — a list of concerns too long to name.\n\n\"We will lose our right to free speech if we don’t use it,\" Day said. \"It's important to send a message that we will not sit back and watch.\"\n\nLois Prew, a volunteer with Stand Up Berkshires, said attending protests like this is a way to \"keep her sanity,\" and it's motivating to see how many others are standing with her. \n\n\"We are fighting tyranny and we are saying no to a person who wants to be king,\" Prew said. \"I'm pumped after today, this is great.\"\n\nO'Herin said that, since the first \"No Kings\" rally in June, there has been some heartening developments. \n\n\"They are losing in courts, they are losing their base, and we are gaining, gaining and gaining momentum,\" she said.\n\nElsewhere, Great Barrington saw a crowd of more than 1,000. It was South County Resistance's largest gathering to date, the organization said. There were also rallies in Dalton, Stockbridge, West Stockbridge, Lee, North Adams and Adams.\n\nIn North Adams, a thousand people lined the sidewalks outside City Hall and Main Street with posters, paper crowns, frog hats and dinosaur suits in a “peaceful, joyous resistance” against Trump’s One Big Beautiful Bill Act. \n\nThe rally was organized by the Northern Berkshire chapter of Greylock Together Indivisible and local group I Lean for Justice, which has been protesting outside City Hall every Saturday since March.\n\n“We’re taking to the streets by the million to show that our grassroots movement against this regime is only growing,” said Greylock Together organizer Jess Dils, a Williamstown resident.\n\nThe rally included speakers from Greylock Together, local business owner Jess Sweeney, state Rep. John Barrett III, and sing-alongs led by local playwright and director Peter Glazer. Glazer led the crowd in “The Times They Are A-Changin'” and ended the program with “This Land Is Your Land.”\n\nMount Greylock high school student Drew Zuckerman, 15, spoke to a roaring crowd about being a youth under the current federal administration. He called it a “weird” moment to be taking classes about 20th-century authoritarian regimes when the current administration students live under felt parallel.\n\n“Teens like me are wondering what their life is going to look like at 35 because they are being hunted for who they are,” Zuckerman said. “It doesn’t take a political science major to realize that this is not what our country is supposed to look like,” said Zuckerman.\n\nBright green frog visors dotted the heads of protesters, many made by Theresa Zelazo, 73.\n\n“It’s to let people know we’re not here to start any trouble, we’re here to say we love America,” said Zelazo.\n\nThe Rev. Doug McCusker, 68, a retired pastor who moved to North Adams from Virginia last year, was at the June “No Kings” rally to support the event and “unite” with like-minded people.\n\n“I’m out here because we need to unite all the people who feel that what’s going on is wrong; it’s against ethical, moral values our country is founded on,” he said. “The administration is trying to pick people off one at a time, but now we need to unite, and that’s what scares them.\"","summary":"Thousands gathered across Berkshire County Saturday for the second \"No Kings\" day of protests, standing up against President Donald Trump and his agenda.","url":"https://www.berkshireeagle.com/news/local/no-kings-protest/article_b6111124-1362-4d0f-b0c9-47c09f79aafc.html","image":"https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/berkshireeagle.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/e/5d/e5dcd2a2-bd33-4b5d-8227-8f388b95c051/68f3e9bf24331.image.jpg?crop=1763%2C926%2C0%2C124&resize=1200%2C630&order=crop%2Cresize","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-10-18 22:30:00","author":"By Talia Lissauer and Izzy Bryars,Gillian Heck — The Berkshire Eagle,The Berkshire Eagle","authors":["By Talia Lissauer and Izzy Bryars","Gillian Heck — The Berkshire Eagle","The Berkshire Eagle"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.01},{"id":370525528,"title":"Over 100,000 take to streets of New York to protest against Trump’s policies","text":"NEW YORK, October 19. /TASS/.

Russell Vought, the director of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), made the announcement Friday while pinning the shutdown on Democrats, whose actions he said left him with no choice but to halt the spending. \"The Democrat shutdown has drained the Army Corps of Engineers' ability to manage billions of dollars in projects,\" Vought posted to X. TRUMP IS USING THE GOVERNMENT SHUTDOWN TO DO SOMETHING NO PRESIDENT HAS EVER DONE \"The Corps will be immediately pausing over $11 billion in lower-priority projects and considering them for cancellation, including projects in New York, San Francisco, Boston, and Baltimore. More information to come from the Army Corps of Engineers.\" New York will be hit hardest, with about $7 billion being frozen while other affected projects are in Illinois, Maryland, Oregon, New Mexico, New Hampshire, Massachusetts, New Jersey, Rhode Island and Delaware, the OMB said, according to Reuters. The money includes $600 million for two aging, federally owned bridges spanning the Cape Cod canal in Massachusetts, which are slated for replacement and carry millions of travelers annually. The OMB told the outlet that President Donald Trump \"wants to reorient how the federal government prioritizes Army Corps projects.\" New York Gov. Kathy Hochul responded to Vought on X, simply writing, \"Good luck with that, Russ. We’ll be in touch,\" while Maryland Rep. Kweisi Mfume wrote on X that the move is \"another example of the Trump Administration placing partisan politics over the welfare of the American people.\" WHITE HOUSE ESCALATES SHUTDOWN CONSEQUENCES AS DEMOCRATS SHOW NO SIGNS OF BUDGING: ‘KAMIKAZE ATTACK’ Meanwhile, Massachusetts leaders also pushed back, with Gov. Maura Healey saying senators had received no official notice from Washington and that the bridge replacement project remains funded and legally approved by Congress. Vought has already targeted Big Apple funds, freezing nearly $18 billion in federal money on the first day of the shutdown for two of New York City’s biggest infrastructure projects — the Hudson Tunnel and the Second Avenue Subway. Vought said that money was stalled \"to ensure funding is not flowing based on unconstitutional DEI principles.\" The Trump administration has already frozen at least $28 billion in earlier rounds of infrastructure and climate-related projects. Trump has also vowed to cut what he called \"Democrat agencies\" and sought to eliminate 4,100 federal jobs. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP The pause in funding stems from the Oct. 1 shutdown after Senate lawmakers failed to reach a spending agreement in time for the end of fiscal year 2025 — after a short-term extension of fiscal year 2025 funding, aimed at keeping the government open through Nov. 21 — passed the House mainly along party lines earlier in September. Republicans like Vought have blamed the shutdown blame on Democrats, arguing they refused to fund the budget as an attempt to reinstate taxpayer-funded medical benefits for illegal immigrants through Democrat lawmakers' continuing resolution, which would include extending the expiring Obamacare tax credits. Democrat leadership has disputed the claims, saying that Trump and Republican lawmakers are really behind the shutdown.

No further details were disclosed about the potential attack.\n\nUS President Donald Trump has previously warned on social media that \"if Hamas continues to kill people in Gaza, which was not the deal, we will have no choice but to go in and kill them\".\n\nHe later clarified he would not send US troops into Gaza after launching the threat against Hamas.\n\nMr Trump's hostile rhetoric represented a shift after initially expressing nonchalance about Hamas killings, saying they had taken out \"a couple of gangs that were very bad\".\n\nHamas hands over remains\n\nThe US State Department alert came hours after Israel said Hamas had handed over \"two coffins of deceased hostages\" from Gaza, while Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu increased pressure on the militant group to share the remaining bodies more quickly under their ceasefire.\n\nNo names for the hostages were immediately released by Mr Netanyahu's office.\n\nIsrael announced earlier on Saturday that Gaza's sole crossing with the outside world, Rafah, would stay closed \"until further notice\", tying it to Hamas's release of remains.\n\nOn Thursday, it had said the crossing likely would reopen on Sunday.\n\nHamas has handed over the remains of 12 of the 28 dead hostages in Gaza, a key step in the week-old ceasefire process meant to end two years of war.\n\nThe militant group says devastation of the Gaza Strip and Israeli military control of certain areas have slowed the handover.\n\nThe latest transfer followed Israel receiving the remains of a 10th hostage, identified as Eliyahu Margalit. The 76-year-old was abducted from kibbutz Nir Oz during the October 7 attack.\n\nHis remains were found after bulldozers ploughed areas in the southern city of Khan Younis.\n\nThe statement by Mr Netanyahu's office on the Rafah crossing came shortly after the Palestinian embassy in Egypt said it would reopen on Monday for people returning to Gaza.\n\nHamas called Mr Netanyahu's decision a violation of the ceasefire deal.\n\nThe Rafah crossing has been closed since May 2024, when Israel took control of the Gaza side.\n\nA fully reopened crossing would make it easier for Gazans to seek medical treatment, travel or visit family in Egypt, which is home to tens of thousands of Palestinians.\n\nPalestinian bodies returned unidentified\n\nMeanwhile, Israel has been accused of returning the bodies of Palestinians with no names, only numbers. Gaza's Health Ministry posts photos of them online, hoping families will come forward.\n\n\"Just like they took their captives, we want our captives.

Then, several explosions are seen, with at least one over the back of the vessel.\nThe Republican president said two people on board were killed – one more than was previously reported – and the two who survived are being sent to their home countries “for detention and prosecution”.\n\nHowever, the press office for Ecuador’s government said on Saturday it was not aware of the plans for repatriation. Meanwhile, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the presidential press office in Colombia did not immediately return messages seeking comment.\nWith Trump’s statement on social media about the death toll, that would mean US military action against vessels in the region have killed at least 29 people.\nThe president has justified the strikes by asserting that the United States is engaged in an “armed conflict” with drug cartels.\nHe is relying on the same legal authority used by the George W. Bush administration when it declared a war on terrorism after the September 11 attacks, and that includes the ability to capture and detain combatants and to use lethal force to take out their leadership.\nTrump is also treating the suspected traffickers as if they were enemy soldiers in a traditional war.\nThe repatriation would avoid questions for the Trump administration about what the legal status of the two would have been in the US justice system. It may also sidestep some of the legal issues that arose out of the detention of enemy combatants in the global war on terrorism as well as challenges to the constitutionality of the current operation.\nTo some legal scholars, Trump’s use of such military force against suspect drug cartels, along with his authorisation of covert action inside Venezuela, possibly to oust President Nicolas Maduro, stretches the bounds of international law.\nOn Friday, Trump seemed to confirm reports that Maduro has offered a stake in Venezuela’s oil and other mineral wealth in recent months to try to stave off mounting pressure from the United States.\nVenezuelan government officials have also floated a plan in which Maduro would eventually leave office, according to a former Trump administration official. That plan was also rejected by the White House.\nThe strikes in the Caribbean have caused unease among members of Congress from both parties and complaints about receiving insufficient information on how the attacks are being conducted.\nBut most Republican senators backed the administration last week on a measure that would have required Trump’s team to get approval from Congress before more strikes.\nMeanwhile, another resolution to be considered would prevent Trump from outright attacking Venezuela without congressional authorisation.","summary":"The two survivors of an American military strike on a suspected drug-carrying vessel in the Caribbean will be sent to Ecuador and Colombia, their home countries, US President Donald Trump said on Saturday.\nThe military rescued the pair after striking a submersible vessel on Thursday, in what was at least the sixth such attack since early September.\n“It was my great honor to destroy a very large DRUG-CARRYING SUBMARINE that was navigating towards the United States on a well known narcotrafficking...","url":"https://www.scmp.com/news/world/americas/article/3329543/us-send-survivors-strike-suspected-drug-vessel-back-ecuador-and-colombia","image":"https://cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2025/10/19/d17558dc-832a-4cff-a830-8627eeada46d_347af956.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-10-18 22:18:15","author":"Associated Press","authors":["Associated Press"],"language":"en","source_country":"cn","sentiment":-0.301},{"id":370515540,"title":"Jimmy Kimmel, Robert De Niro, Glenn Close and More Speak Out in Support of No Kings Protests: ‘We’re Rising Up Again’","text":"Hollywood is speaking out in support of the No Kings protests.

Tarrio also attended counter protests at first “No Kings” demonstrations in June.\n\nOrganizers repeatedly warned demonstrators not to engage, The Miami Herald reported. \n\n“Walk away from the agitator,” they said through megaphones. “Please do not engage with any outside agitators.”\n\nTarrio, who lives in Miami, smiled into his camera and said: “I support all these people, especially her with the bullhorn.”\n\nTarrio was among four members of the far-right gang convicted of seditious conspiracy and other crimes for their role in the Capitol attack, fueled by Trump’s ongoing false claim that the 2020 presidential election was stolen from him.\n\nTarrio was not in Washington, D.C., on January 6, 2021, but prosecutors argued that he helped organize members of the group, which breached barricades and broke windows into the halls of Congress,and then bragged about their actions on social media and in group chat messages that were later shared with jurors.\n\nBroward Proud Boys member Barry Ramey joined Tarrio as they livestreamed their way through the crowd Saturday.\n\n“These protesters are 100 percent expressing the same rights as during January 6,” Ramey said.\n\nAt one point, Tarrio confronted a protester who questioned his presence. \n\n“You don’t believe in free speech?” he said. “Welcome to free speech!”\n\nAs Tarrio and Ramey continued through the crowd, some attendees shouted “pedophile defender,” “loser,” and “fascist.” \n\nTarrio lit a cigarette as two Miami police officers approached.\n\nMiami Police Sergeant K. Williams reportedly exclaimed “very peaceful crowd” as he escorted Tarrio and Ramey out of the area. \n\nTarrio, who led the far-right group from 2018 to 2021, received the longest prison sentence among any convicted Capitol rioter. \n\nBut Tarrio was among more than 1,500 other defendants charged in connection with the attack who received pardons and commutations from Trump on his first day in office.\n\nMore than 7 million people participated in demonstrations against the Trump administration Saturday, with more than 2,000 cities and towns across the country joining a second round of “No Kings” rallies after massive protests in June.","summary":"Miami’s second ‘No Kings’ protest drew an estimated 4,000 attendees","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/proud-boys-enrique-tarrio-no-kings-protest-miami-b2847948.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/10/18/22/29/Former-Proud-Boy-leader-Enrique-Tarrio.png?crop=2388,1592,x233,y0&trim=0,233,0,233&width=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/iPTVBRh6-OhrQWqOm.mp4","publish_date":"2025-10-18 22:10:50","author":"Andrea Cavallier","authors":["Andrea Cavallier"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":0.089}]}
