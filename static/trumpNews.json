The former president is also barred from using social media or contacting other individuals under investigation by the Supreme Court, including his son, Eduardo Bolsonaro, a Brazilian lawmaker who currently lives in the United States and is known for his close ties to U.S. President Donald Trump.\n\nBolsonaro is currently on trial at the Supreme Court accused of leading an alleged attempt to stage a coup to overturn the 2022 election in which he was defeated by left-wing president Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva.\n\n“It is a supreme humiliation,” Bolsonaro told journalists in Brasilia after putting on the ankle monitoring. “I never thought about leaving Brazil, I never thought about going to an embassy, but the precautionary measures are because of that.”\n\nOn Thursday, Trump wrote to Bolsonaro describing his ally’s treatment by the Brazilian legal system as terrible and unjust. “This trial should end immediately!,” the U.S. President said, adding that he “strongly voiced” his disapproval through his tariff policy.\n\nOn Friday, the U.S. State Department announced visa restrictions on Brazilian judicial officials.\n\n“President Trump made clear that his administration will hold accountable foreign nationals who are responsible for censorship of protected expression in the United States,” Secretary of State Marco Rubio said in a statement. \"Brazilian Supreme Federal Court Justice Alexandre de Moraes’s political witch hunt against Jair Bolsonaro created a persecution and censorship complex so sweeping that it not only violates basic rights of Brazilians, but also extends beyond Brazil’s shores to target Americans.\n\n“I have therefore ordered visa revocations for Moraes and his allies on the court, as well as their immediate family members effective immediately,” Rubio said.\n\nThe Supreme Court's restrictions on Bolsonaro are part of a second investigation against Eduardo for allegedly working with U.S. authorities to impose sanctions against Brazilian officials.\n\nMoraes, who is also the rapporteur of the case, said that the former president and his son's recent actions were “blatant confessions of criminal conduct,” such as coercion during legal proceedings, obstruction of investigations and attacks on national sovereignty.\n\n“Alexandre de Moraes doubled down,” Eduardo said on X, mentioning the order to the Supreme Court justice ahead of the criminal cases against his father. His elder brother, Sen. Flávio Bolsonaro, said on X: “Prohibiting a father from speaking to his own son is the greatest symbol of the hatred that has consumed Alexandre de Moraes.”\n\nLive aerial footage from local broadcasters showed federal police vehicles outside Bolsonaro’s residence in Brasília.\n\nCongressman Sóstenes Cavalcante, the leader of Bolsonaro’s party in the lower house, told The Associated Press that officers also searched Bolsonaro’s office at the party’s headquarters. He described the operation as “another chapter in the persecution of conservatives and right-wing figures” in Brazil.\n\nA lawyer for Bolsonaro did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nOn Tuesday, Brazil’s Prosecutor-General Paulo Gonet said in a report to the Supreme Court that the “evidence is clear: the defendant acted systematically, throughout his mandate and after his defeat at the polls, to incite insurrection and the destabilization of the democratic rule of law.”\n\nBolsonaro has described the trial on X as a “witch hunt,” echoing a term used by Trump when he came to his South American ally’s defense last week.\n\nLast week, Trump imposed a 50% import tax on Brazil, directly tying the tariffs to Bolsonaro’s trial. The U.S. president has hosted the former Brazilian president at his Mar-a-Lago resort when both were in power in 2020. Trump compared the Brazilian’s situation to his own.

The defamation lawsuit, filed in federal court in Miami, saw the 79-year-old Republican hitting back at a scandal threatening to cause serious political damage. \"We have just filed a POWERHOUSE Lawsuit against everyone involved in publishing the false, malicious, defamatory, FAKE NEWS 'article' in the useless 'rag' that is, The Wall Street Journal,\" Trump posted on Truth Social late Friday. The Journal reported Thursday that in 2003, the then-real estate magnate wrote a suggestive birthday letter to Epstein, illustrated with a naked woman and referring to their shared \"secret.\" The lawsuit, which also names two reporters and Murdoch's company News Corp. as defendants, claims that no such letter exists and that the Journal intended to malign Trump with an article already viewed by hundreds of millions of people. \"And given the timing of the Defendants' article, which shows their malicious intent behind it, the overwhelming financial and reputational harm suffered by President Trump will continue to multiply,\" it said. - Alleged cover-up - ==================== In another bid to dampen outrage among his own supporters about an alleged government cover-up of Epstein's activities and 2019 death, Trump ordered his attorney general, Pam Bondi, to seek the unsealing of grand jury testimony from the prosecution against the disgraced financier. In a filing in New York, Bondi cited \"extensive public interest\" for the unusual request to release what is typically secret testimony. Epstein, a longtime friend of Trump and multiple high-profile men, was found hanging dead in a New York prison cell while awaiting trial on charges that he sexually exploited dozens of underage girls at his homes in New York and Florida. The case sparked conspiracy theories, especially among Trump's far-right voters, about an alleged international cabal of wealthy pedophiles. Epstein's death -- declared a suicide -- before he could face trial supercharged the narrative. When Trump returned to power for a second term this January, his supporters clamored for revelations about Epstein's supposed list of clients. But Bondi issued an official memo in July declaring there was no such list. The discontent in Trump's \"Make America Great Again\" base poses a rare challenge to the Republican's control of the political narrative in the United States. It remained unclear whether a court would authorize the unsealing of the grand jury testimony. But even if such material were made public, it was also unclear whether it would shed much, if any, light on the main questions raised in the conspiracy theories -- particularly the existence and possible contents of an Epstein client list. Asked Friday by reporters if he would pursue the broader release of information related to the case, Trump did not answer. - Naked woman and signature - ============================= Trump was for years close with Epstein and the two were photographed and videoed together at parties, although there has never been evidence of wrongdoing. The Wall Street Journal article published late Thursday was damaging because it indicated a shared interest in sex. The Journal reported that Trump had wished Epstein a happy 50th birthday in 2003 with a \"bawdy\" letter, part of an album of messages from rich and well-known figures. According to the Journal, the Trump letter contained the outline of a naked woman, apparently drawn with a marker, and had the future president's signature \"Donald\" mimicking pubic hair. It ends, according to the newspaper, with \"Happy Birthday -- and may every day be another wonderful secret.\" Trump reacted in a series of furious social media posts, saying \"it's not my language. It's not my words.\" \"I never wrote a picture in my life. I don't draw pictures of women,\" he said. US media has published multiple drawings done by Trump in the past, with several dating to the early 2000s when he used his celebrity status to donate sketches for charity.","summary":"The defamation lawsuit, filed in federal court in Miami, saw Trump hitting back at a scandal threatening to cause serious political damage","url":"https://www.deccanchronicle.com/world/americas/trump-sues-murdoch-wall-street-jornal-over-reporting-on-epstein-ties-1892391","image":"https://www.deccanchronicle.com/h-upload/2025/07/19/1939514-aa-5155399.webp","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-07-19 01:00:44","author":"AFP","authors":["AFP"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"in","sentiment":-0.308},{"id":343059980,"title":"World News | Trump Once Again Threatens 10 Pc Tariffs on BRICS Nations over Dollar Dominance","text":"Washington DC [US], July 19 (ANI): US President Donald Trump has warned that countries aligning with the BRICS economic bloc will face additional 10 per cent tariffs on their goods, as he seeks to protect the dollar's global dominance.\nSpeaking at a White House event on Friday, Trump accused the group of trying to \"take over\" the US dollar and said he would not allow America's currency to \"slide\".\nAlso Read | 'There Should Be No Double Standards on Energy Trade': India Rejects EU's 18th Sanctions Package on Russia, Reaffirms Commitment to Energy Security.\n\"We have this little group called BRICS, which is fading out fast,\" the president said during a ceremony where he signed cryptocurrency legislation into law. \"BRICS, they wanted to try and take over the dollar, the dominance of the dollar and the standard of the dollar.\"\nTrump claimed that after issuing his tariff warning, a subsequent BRICS meeting saw poor attendance. \"They didn't want to be tariffed,\" he said.\nAlso Read | US Designates Lashkar Proxy TRF As 'Foreign Terrorist Organisation': A Glance at How Terror Outfit Operates With Pakistan Army.\nBRICS is an economic alliance originally comprising Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa.

Trump said he would send letters to countries detailing tariff rates if agreements are not reached.\n\"I hit them very, very hard, and it will end very quickly. I don't think they'll do it.

Maduro described Friday as “a day of blessings and good news for Venezuela.\" He called it “the perfect day for Venezuela.”\n\nCentral to the deal are more than 250 Venezuelan migrants freed by El Salvador, which in March agreed to a $6 million payment from the Trump administration to house them in its notorious prison.\n\nThat arrangement drew immediate blowback when Trump invoked an 18th century wartime law, the Alien Enemies Act, to quickly remove the men that his administration had accused of belonging to the violent Tren de Aragua street gang, teeing up a legal fight that reached the U.S. Supreme Court. The administration did not provide evidence to back up those claims.\n\nThe Venezuelans have been held in a mega-prison known as the Terrorism Confinement Center, or CECOT, which was built to hold alleged gang members in Bukele’s war on the country’s gangs. Human rights groups have documented hundreds of deaths as well as cases of torture inside its walls.\n\nLawyers have little access to those in the prison, which is heavily guarded, and information has been locked tight, other than heavily produced state propaganda videos showing tattooed men packed behind bars.\n\nPhotos and videos released by El Salvador’s government on Friday showed shackled Venezuelans sitting in a fleet of buses and boarding planes surrounded by officers in riot gear. One man looked up and pointed toward the sky as he climbed aboard a plane, while another made an obscene gesture toward police.\n\nAfter arriving in Venezuela, some of the migrants crossed themselves, cried and hugged one another. They wore face masks and street clothes.\n\nMaduro alleged that some of them were subjected to various forms of abuse at the Salvadoran prison, and one of them even lost a kidney “due to the beatings he received.”\n\nInterior Minister Diosdado Cabello told reporters the men would undergo medical tests and background checks before they can go home.\n\nIn April, in a heated exchange of diplomatic letters with Venezuela, Bukele proposed exchanging the Venezuelans for the same number of what he called “political prisoners” held by Maduro. It provoked a harsh response from Venezuelan authorities, who called his comments “cynical” and referred to Bukele as a “neofascist.\"\n\nThe State Department office responsible for negotiating the release of American detainees posted a photo Friday evening of the newly released prisoners smiling for the camera inside an airplane bringing them home, some clutching an unfurled American flag.\n\nAmong those released was 37-year-old Lucas Hunter, whose family says he was kidnapped in January by Venezuelan border guards from inside Colombia, where he was vacationing.\n\n“We cannot wait to see him in person and help him recover from the ordeal,” his younger sister Sophie Hunter said.\n\nVenezuelan authorities detained nearly a dozen U.S. citizens in the second half of 2024 and linked them to alleged plots to destabilize the country.\n\n“We have prayed for this day for almost a year. My brother is an innocent man who was used as a political pawn by the Maduro regime,\" said a statement from Christian Casteneda, whose brother Wilbert, a Navy SEAL, was arrested in his Caracas hotel room last year.\n\nGlobal Reach, a nonprofit organization that had advocated for his release and that of several other Americans, said Venezuelan officials initially and falsely accused him of being involved in a coup but backed off that claim.\n\nThe release of the Venezuelans, meanwhile, is an invaluable win for Maduro as he presses his efforts to assert himself as president despite credible evidence that he lost reelection last year.\n\nLong accused of human rights abuses, Maduro for months has used the migrants' detention in El Salvador to flip the script on the U.S. government, forcing even some of his strongest political opponents to agree with his condemnation of the migrants’ treatment.\n\nTheir return will allow Maduro to reaffirm support within his shrinking base, while demonstrating that even if the Trump administration and other nations see him as an illegitimate president, he is still firmly in power.\n\nJust a week ago, the U.S. State Department reiterated its policy of shunning Maduro government officials and recognizing only the National Assembly elected in 2015 as the legitimate government of the country. Signed by Rubio, the cable said U.S. officials are free to meet and have discussions with National Assembly members “but cannot engage with Maduro regime representatives unless cleared by the Department of State.”\n\nThe Americans were among dozens of people, including activists, opposition members and union leaders, that Venezuela’s government took into custody in its brutal campaign to crack down on dissent in the 11 months since Maduro claimed to win reelection.\n\nBesides the U.S., several other Western nations also do not recognize Maduro’s claim to victory. They instead point to tally sheets collected by the opposition coalition showing that its candidate, Edmundo González, won the July 2024 election by a more than a two-to-one margin.\n\nThe dispute over results prompted immediate protests, and the government responded by detaining more than 2,000 people, mostly poor young men. González fled into exile in Spain to avoid arrest.\n\nMore than 7.7 million Venezuelans have migrated since 2013, when its oil-dependent economy came undone and Maduro became president. Most settled in Latin America and the Caribbean, but after the COVID-19 pandemic, many saw the U.S. as their best chance to improve their living conditions.\n\nDespite the U.S. not recognizing Maduro, the two governments have carried out other recent exchanges.\n\nIn May, Venezuela freed a U.S. Air Force veteran after about six months in detention. Scott St. Clair's family has said the language specialist, who served four tours in Afghanistan, had traveled to South America to seek treatment for post-traumatic stress disorder.\n\nThree months earlier, six other Americans whom the U.S. government considered wrongfully detained in Venezuela were released after Richard Grenell, Trump’s envoy for special missions, met with Maduro at the presidential palace.\n\nGrenell, during the meeting in Caracas, urged Maduro to take back deported migrants who have committed crimes in the U.S. Hundreds of Venezuelans have since been deported to their home country, including 251 people, including seven children, who arrived Friday.\n\nMaduro’s government had accused the Trump administration of “kidnapping” the children by placing them in foster care after their parents were deported.\n\n© Copyright 2025 The Associated Press.

Dow Jones, the parent of the newspaper, is a division of News Corp.\n\n\"I look forward to getting Rupert Murdoch to testify in my lawsuit against him and his 'pile of garbage' newspaper, the WSJ. That will be an interesting experience!!!\" Trump said in a post on Truth Social on Friday morning.\n\nRepresentatives of Dow Jones, News Corp and Murdoch could not be reached for comment.\n\nDisgraced financier and sex offender Epstein died by suicide in a New York jail cell in 2019.\n\nThe case has generated conspiracy theories that became popular among Trump's base of supporters who believed the government was covering up Epstein's ties to the rich and powerful.\n\nSome of Trump's most loyal followers became furious after his administration reversed course on its promise to release files related to the Epstein investigation. A Justice Department memo released on July 7 concluded that Epstein killed himself and said there was \"no incriminating client list\" or evidence that Epstein blackmailed prominent people.\n\nAttorney General Pam Bondi had pledged months earlier to reveal major revelations about Epstein, including \"a lot of names\" and \"a lot of flight logs.\"\n\nWith pressure to release the Epstein files building, Trump on Thursday said he directed Bondi to ask a court to release grand jury testimony about Epstein.\n\nThe U.S. government on Friday filed a motion in Manhattan federal court to unseal grand jury transcripts in the cases of Epstein and his former associate Ghislaine Maxwell, who in 2021 was convicted of five federal charges related to her role in Epstein's sexual abuse of underage girls. She is serving a 20-year sentence.\n\n\"Public officials, lawmakers, pundits, and ordinary citizens remain deeply interested and concerned about the Epstein matter,\" Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche said in the filing. \"After all, Jeffrey Epstein is the most infamous pedophile in American history.\"\n\nBlanche called the transcripts \"critical pieces of an important moment in our nation's history,\" and said \"the time for the public to guess what they contain should end.\"\n\nHe said prosecutors would work to redact all victim-identifying information before making anything public.\n\nBAWDY LETTER\n\nThe Journal said the letter bearing Trump's name was part of a leather-bound birthday book for Epstein that included messages from other high-profile people. The newspaper said the letter contains several lines of typewritten text framed by the outline of a naked woman, which appeared to be hand-drawn with a heavy marker. The newspaper said the letter concludes \"Happy Birthday - and may every day be another wonderful secret,\" and featured the signature \"Donald.\"\n\nAllegations that Epstein had been sexually abusing girls became public in 2006 - after the birthday book was allegedly produced - and he was arrested that year before accepting a plea deal. Epstein died just over a month after he was arrested for a second time and charged with sex-trafficking conspiracy.\n\nTrump, who was photographed with Epstein multiple times in social situations in the 1990s and early 2000s, told reporters in 2019 that he ended his relationship with Epstein before his legal troubles became apparent.\n\nIn 2002, Trump, a Florida neighbor of Epstein's, was quoted in New York magazine as saying, \"I've known Jeff for 15 years. Terrific guy. He's a lot of fun to be with. It is even said that he likes beautiful women as much as I do, and many of them are on the younger side.\"\n\nSpeaking to reporters in the Oval Office in 2019, Trump said he and Epstein had a \"falling out\" before the financier was first arrested.\n\nTrump said he \"knew him like everybody in Palm Beach knew him\" but that, \"I had a falling out with him. I haven't spoken to him in 15 years. I was not a fan of his, that I can tell you.\"\n\nWHAT THE TRANSCRIPTS COULD SHOW\n\nThe release of the grand jury documents may fall short of what many of Trump's supporters have sought, including case files held by the administration.\n\nGrand juries review evidence from prosecutors to determine whether people should be indicted for crimes. This includes hearsay, improperly obtained information and other evidence that prosecutors would not be allowed to present at trial.\n\nTranscripts of grand jury proceedings are generally kept secret under federal criminal procedure rules, with limited exceptions.\n\nA judge may allow disclosure of grand jury matters in connection with judicial proceedings, or at the request of defendants who believe it could lead to the dismissal of their indictments.\n\nIt is likely that some material released from grand jury proceedings would be redacted, or blacked out, because of privacy or security concerns.\n\n© Thomson Reuters 2025.","summary":"U.S. President Donald Trump sued the Wall Street Journal and its owners including Rupert Murdoch on Friday, seeking at least $10 billion in damages over the newspaper's report that…","url":"https://japantoday.com/category/world/trump-sues-wall-street-journal-over-epstein-report-seeks-10-billion","image":"https://media.japantoday.com/img/store/99/6a/1051463f664a1022c7a4859c814b6091160e/tag-reuters/_w1700.jpeg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-07-19 00:28:28","author":"Japan Today Editor,Jonathan Stempel","authors":["Japan Today Editor","Jonathan Stempel"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"jp","sentiment":-0.149},{"id":343057126,"title":"Steve Bannon shares chilling theory about why Murdoch's Wall Street Journal revealed Trump's letter to Epstein","text":"Steve Bannon believes that the Wall Street Journal's publishing of an alleged letter from Donald Trump to Jeffrey Epstein is part of a Rupert Murdoch plot to take down the president. \n\nThe former White House advisor made the claim on his War Room broadcast before Trump filed a $10billion lawsuit against the Wall Street Journal, Murdoch and the reporters involved.\n\n'Last night, we saw it in all its ugliness. The Murdochs hate Trump. The Murdochs want to take down Trump.

And of course, Fox News is for RINOs. But the Wall Street Journal is the neoliberal neocon sharp end of the stick that they come after Trump. And last night they tried to actually destroy him with what looks like a phony and fake letter,' Bannon wrote.\n\nHe went further, calling the letter an attempted 'kill shot on President Trump because he 'had the stones to stand up to the Murdochs.' \n\nBannon advised Attorney General Pam Bondi to release 'all of the evidence' regarding Epstein. \n\n'In fact, we made the recommendations that are the best for President Trump in this movement, which is President Trump is best when it’s attack, attack, attack,' he said.\n\nBannon predicted the lawsuit would be 'incredible' and reveled in getting Murdoch to testify. \n\n'He can’t wait to get Rupert Murdoch on the stand.

Estudillo ruled the priests were \"likely to succeed\" in their lawsuit and issued a preliminary injunction blocking that part of the law.\n\n\"There is no question that SB 5375 burdens plaintiffs’ free exercise of religion,\" Estudillo wrote. \"In situations where Plaintiffs hear confessions related to child abuse or neglect, SB 5375 places them in the position of either complying with the requirements of their faith or violating the law...\n\n\"As [the plaintiff] stated, any priest who directly violates the sacramental seal incurs automatic excommunication, and thereby risks eternal damnation...\n\n\"Ultimately, Washington’s failure to demonstrate why it has an interest of the highest order in denying an exemption to clergy while making such exemptions available to other professionals who work with underserved children is likely fatal.\"\n\nPresident Donald Trump stands with foreign leaders and monarchs as he attends the funeral of Pope Francis in the Vatican City on April 26, 2025 (Mandel Ngan / AFP via Getty Images))\n\nIt comes after the Trump administration cut funding for investigating child sexual abuse, and refused to release promised documents about the crimes and associates of Jeffrey Epstein, as it seeks to define transgender rights and healthcare for under-18s as a form of \"child abuse\".\n\nSB 5375 was signed into law in May by Washington's Democratic governor Bob Ferguson, and will take effect on July 27. Ferguson told reporters he had no hesitation about signing it. Ferguson is Catholic and has been to confession.\n\nAs state attorney general, Ferguson had accused the Catholic Church of refusing to cooperate with an investigation into whether it unlawfully used charitable funds to cover up sexual abuse by priests.\n\nThe new law adds religious leaders and priests to a list of professions that can be criminally charged if they do not report suspected abuse or neglect, alongside teachers, doctors, nurses, childcare providers, and many others.\n\nPreviously, priests were only required to report if the suspected perpetrator was someone they had authority over, and were exempted from doing so if they learned about it through a \"privileged communication\" such as confession.\n\nWashington's Catholic leadership objected, saying the Church's prohibition on breaking the \"seal of confession\" is absolute and threatens to excommunicate any Catholic priests who follow the law.\n\n\"All Catholics must know and be assured that their confessions remain sacred, secure, confidential, and protected by the law of the Church,\" said Archbishop Paul D. Etienne, citing a Bible passage in which St Peter says: \"We must obey God rather than men.\"\n\nWashington Governor Bob Ferguson, at the time the state's attorney general, speaking at a pro-choice rally in Seattle in May 2022 (Jason Redmond / AFP via Getty Images)\n\nThe priests' lawsuit argued that SB 5375 infringed upon their first amendment rights and treated them differently than other professions. They cited a separate bill that exempts some lawyers and their employees if the information was obtained through confidential dealings with clients.\n\nEstudillo's judgement zeroed in on that contrast, writing: \"The government interest at issue in both statutes — protecting children from abuse and neglect — is the same. Nevertheless, one law eliminates the privilege for clergy while the other expands the privileges available to secular professionals.\"\n\nTrump's Justice Department weighed in too, calling the law \"anti-Catholic\" and saying \"a more direct burden on the exercise of religion would be difficult to imagine\".\n\nThe judge did not block any other part of the law, which means clergy will still be required to report abuse they learn about outside confession, even if they have no authority over the suspected perpetrator.\n\nThe case is ongoing and the final outcome could still change. Washington's Eastern Orthodox Christian leaders have also filed a similar lawsuit.","url":"https://uk.news.yahoo.com/trump-administration-intervenes-help-block-002033438.html","image":"https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_independent_577/177e217b844d2b49a4d9b13d1756aafd","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-07-19 00:20:33","author":"Io Dodds","authors":["Io Dodds"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.338},{"id":343057136,"title":"EPA eliminates research and development office, begins layoffs","text":"The Environmental Protection Agency said Friday it is eliminating its research and development arm and reducing agency staff by thousands of employees.\n\nThe agency’s Office of Research and Development has long provided the scientific underpinnings for EPA’s mission to protect the environment and human health. The EPA said in May it would shift its scientific expertise and research efforts to program offices that focus on major issues like air and water.\n\nThe agency said Friday it is creating a new Office of Applied Science and Environmental Solutions that will allow it to focus on research and science “more than ever before.\"\n\nOnce fully implemented, the changes will save the EPA nearly $750 million, officials said.\n\nEPA Administrator Lee Zeldin said in a statement that the changes announced Friday would ensure the agency “is better equipped than ever to deliver on our core mission of protecting human health and the environment, while Powering the Great American Comeback.''\n\nThe EPA also said it is beginning the process to eliminate thousands of jobs, following a Supreme Court ruling last week that cleared the way for President Donald Trump’s plans to downsize the federal workforce, despite warnings that critical government services will be lost and hundreds of thousands of federal employees will be out of their jobs.\n\nTotal staffing at EPA will go down to 12,448, a reduction of more than 3,700 employees, or nearly 23%, from staffing levels in January when Trump took office, the agency said.\n\n\"This reduction in force will ensure we can better fulfill that mission while being responsible stewards of your hard-earned tax dollars,” Zeldin said, using a government term for mass firings.‘\n\nRep. Zoe Lofgren of California, the top Democrat on the House Science Committee, called the elimination of the research office “a travesty.''\n\n“The Trump administration is firing hardworking scientists while employing political appointees whose job it is to lie incessantly to Congress and to the American people,'' she said. “The obliteration of ORD will have generational impacts on Americans’ health and safety.\"\n\nThe Office of Research and Development \"is the heart and brain of the EPA,'' said Justin Chen, president of American Federation of Government Employees Council 238, which represents thousands of EPA employees.\n\n“Without it, we don’t have the means to assess impacts upon human health and the environment,'' Chen said. “Its destruction will devastate public health in our country.”\n\nThe research office — EPA’s main science arm — currently has 1,540 positions, excluding special government employees and public health officers, according to agency documents reviewed by Democratic staff on the House science panel earlier this year. As many as 1,155 chemists, biologists, toxicologists and other scientists could be laid off, the documents indicated.\n\nThe research office has 10 facilities across the country, stretching from Florida and North Carolina to Oregon. An EPA spokeswoman said Friday that all laboratory functions currently conducted by the research office will continue.\n\nIn addition to the reduction in force, or RIF, the agency also is offering the third round of deferred resignations for eligible employees, including research office staff, spokeswoman Molly Vaseliou said. The application period is open until July 25.\n\nThe EPA's announcement comes two weeks after the agency put on administrative leave 139 employees who signed a “declaration of dissent” with agency policies under the Trump administration. The agency accused the employees of “unlawfully undermining” Trump's agenda.\n\nIn a letter made public June 30, the employees wrote that the EPA is no longer living up to its mission to protect human health and the environment.

But elevated to leadership positions in the FBI, both Patel and Bongino signed off on a memo stating that no such list existed -- angering some of Trump's most vocal supporters.\n\nThat changed on Thursday, when the Wall Street Journal published a letter it alleged Trump had sent Epstein in 2003 for his 50th birthday. ABC News has not been able to confirm the existence of the letter.\n\nTrump, who had been friendly with Epstein for around 15 years before they had a falling out in 2004, denied to the Journal that he had written the letter, and on Friday filed a defamation lawsuit against the paper claiming damages of not less than $10 billion.\n\nLeading Trump supporters rallied to the president's side.\n\nFollowing the Journal article, MAGA voices who had been some of Trump's most vocal critics over the last week, including Megyn Kelly, Charlie Kirk, Jack Posobiec, Laura Loomer, Benny Johnson and even Elon Musk rushed to defend the president.\n\nPosobiec, a MAGA podcaster who had been one of the loudest voices pushing the Epstein issue, told former Trump adviser Steve Bannon, \"We're so back. Everyone is firing on all cylinders. The MAGA movement is completely united behind this fight.\"\n\n\"We have to be on offensive all the time,\" Bannon told his online audience, saying of Trump, \"They tried to actually destroy him.\"\n\nTrump also announced Thursday that he was asking Attorney General Pam Bondi to \"produce any and all pertinent Grand Jury testimony, subject to Court approval\" in regard to the Epstein case -- prompting accolades from supporters who had been pushing for the release of more Epstein material.\n\nJohnson, another MAGA podcaster, tweeted \"victory\" in response to the news.\n\nKirk, on his show, urged his viewers to \"thank President Trump\" for pushing his administration to release the testimony.\n\n\"So for any of you in the audience that were a little uneasy, that were a little anxious, I think it's morally incumbent on you to say thank you President Trump, thank you for stepping up and for doing this,\" Kirk said. \"Thank you President Trump, for fulfilling what you said you were going to do, because he does deserve credit.\"\n\nThe Journal story appears to have redirected MAGA supporters' criticism and unified them against a familiar target: the media. But whether the shift in support will hold is unclear. While figures like Kirk and Bannon have framed the grand jury promise as a major win, the release of the testimony itself could take time, as officials must first assess its impact on victims then win the approval of a federal judge.\n\nAnd because the grand jury transcripts represent only a small fraction of the files on Epstein, it's unclear if the contents will satisfy members of Trump's base who have been demanding the release of all Epstein materials. The last time the administration released Epstein-related files in February, the move sparked further questions and contributed to the backlash the president and his administration are still dealing with today.\n\nFor now, though, Kirk said on his show that \"it was very fun to see\" the MAGA base rallying around Trump following the publication of the Journal's story.\n\nSeemingly to underscore the point, Kirk opened his show with a snippet of Joe Cocker's performance of the song \"With a Little Help From My Friends\" -- in an apparent wink and a nod to the story helping to unite the MAGA movement behind the president once again.","summary":"Some leading voices in President Trump’s MAGA base who criticized his handling of the Epstein files are now rallying to his defense after a Wall Street Journal story.","url":"https://abcnews.go.com/US/back-maga-supporters-rally-trump-wsj-article/story?id=123872097","image":"https://i.abcnewsfe.com/a/050f4f79-bc77-46ff-ae90-27fa9922ba3c/trump-3-rt-er-250715_1752605248756_hpMain_16x9.jpg?w=1600","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-07-19 00:19:06","author":"Will Steakin","authors":["Will Steakin"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.291},{"id":343059716,"title":"Trump Fulfills Pledge to File Lawsuit Against Wall Street Journal Regarding Epstein Card","text":"Donald Trump has acted on his intention to file a $10 billion lawsuit against the Wall Street Journal and its owner Rupert Murdoch. This legal action comes after the newspaper published a story about Trump’s alleged involvement in a birthday gift for Jeffrey Epstein’s 50th birthday.\n\nThe lawsuit, as acquired by DailyMail.com, has been filed in the Southern District of Florida. It targets WSJ, Dow Jones, Rupert Murdoch, and the reporters responsible for the article. Trump referred to this lawsuit as a ‘powerhouse’ on his Truth Social platform.\n\nTrump is seeking a jury trial, demanding compensation for damages, punitive damages, court costs, and any other relief deemed appropriate by the court, with a minimum request of $10 billion.\n\nA bombshell report in the Wall Street Journal on Thursday claimed Trump wrote a ‘bawdy’ 50th birthday card to Epstein which concluded: ‘Happy Birthday – and may every day be another wonderful secret’. \n\nThe newspaper said it had reviewed a typewritten letter bearing Trump´s signature, framed by the seemingly hand-drawn outline of a naked woman, that Ghislaine Maxwell included in a 2003 birthday album. \n\nTrump has denied writing the letter or drawing the picture, calling it ‘false, malicious, and defamatory.’\n\nHe posted to Truth Social Friday: ‘We have just filed a POWERHOUSE Lawsuit against everyone involved in publishing the false, malicious, defamatory, FAKE NEWS “article” in the useless “rag” that is, The Wall Street Journal. This historic legal action is being brought against the so-called authors of this defamation, the now fully disgraced WSJ, as well as its corporate owners and affiliates, with Rupert Murdoch and Robert Thomson (whatever his role is!) at the top of the list.’ \n\nTrump cited his successes against ABC News and CBS News’ 60 Minutes in prior lawsuits. \n\nHe added: ‘This lawsuit is filed not only on behalf of your favorite President, ME, but also in order to continue standing up for ALL Americans who will no longer tolerate the abusive wrongdoings of the Fake News Media.

I don’t draw pictures of women,’ Trump told the WSJ. ‘It’s not my language. It’s not my words.’\n\nBut it once again raises questions about the friendship between Trump and Epstein.\n\nBut last week following the memo from his DOJ, which sparked a MAGA civil war, Trump became irate and said during a cabinet meeting that everyone should move on.\n\nHe has now called his supporters ‘weaklings’ for believing a Democrat-run ‘hoax’.\n\nThe Wall Street Journal bombshell, which Trump thoroughly denounced on social media, comes amid major MAGA outrage over a DOJ and FBI report published last week indicating no further Epstein-related files will be released.\n\nSince then, Republicans in Congress have faced pressure from their constituents to force the DOJ to release the files and conservative influencers have been pressuring lawmakers to act. \n\nTrump has also urged Attorney General Pam Bondi to release additional documents, though the push from Capitol Hill could obtain documents the AG or Trump does not want released. \n\nThe late financier was charged in 2008 for soliciting prostitution with an underaged girl and received a modest jail sentence in Florida. He was later charged with federal sex trafficking crimes in 2019. He hung himself in prison awaiting his trial, feds say. \n\nHowever, his socializing with the likes of Prince Andrew, Bill Clinton, Bill Gates, hordes of other A-list celebrities, including Trump, have prompted many to believe that these ‘elites’ could have been involved in Epstein’s crimes. \n\nThe president’s allies began to defend the president saying he would never be caught drawing in such a fashion.\n\nDonald Trump Jr., the president’s son, declared on social media, ‘in 47 years I’ve never seen him doodle once. Give me a break.’ \n\nVice President JD Vance posted on X defending his boss that the story is ‘complete and utter bulls***.’\n\n‘The WSJ should be ashamed for publishing it,’ the 40-year-old VP continued. ‘Where is this letter? Would you be shocked to learn they never showed it to us before publishing it? Does anyone honestly believe this sounds like Donald Trump?’ \n\n‘Anyone who believes Trump got markers out to draw the figure of a woman and write what sounds like some weird Democrat fan fiction inside it to Jeffrey Epstein is an imbecile with a room temperature IQ,’ Conservative commentator Robby Starbuck wrote.\n\n‘I think that @WSJ is gonna have to write President Trump a really fat check,’ Starbuck predicted. \n\nDemocrats have put Republicans in a bind over the matter, seizing on the bizarre explanation that Trump doesn’t draw despite there being myriad examples of the president’s sketches. \n\nCalifornia Gov. Gavin Newsom hit back on Trump’s claim he never drew with a picture by posting one that he donated to charity. \n\n‘Trump loves to draw,’ former congressman Adam Kinzinger posted alongside a dozen of the president’s drawings. ‘Just saying.’ \n\nProgressive Pramila Jayapal, D-Wash., wrote on X: ‘I don’t know what’s in the Epstein files, but Trump being so desperate to make this story go away is making me wonder: what’s he hiding?’\n\n‘Give the American people the transparency they deserve,’ she added. ‘Release the full files.’\n\nThe Department of Justice announcement that Epstein did not in fact have a ‘client list’ has prompted a bipartisan push on Capitol Hill for the DOJ to release any files on the sex offender and human trafficker.\n\nReps. Thomas Massie, R-Ky., and Ro Khanna, D-Calif., have begun the process to force a vote on the files release.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nDonald Trump has acted on his intention to file a $10 billion&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Trump Fulfills Pledge to File Lawsuit Against Wall Street Journal Regarding Epstein Card first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/news/trump-fulfills-pledge-to-file-lawsuit-against-wall-street-journal-regarding-epstein-card/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Trump-delivers-on-promise-to-sue-Wall-Street-Journal-over.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-07-19 00:17:50","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.145},{"id":343060006,"title":"Entertainment News | US President Donald Trump Praises CBS's Decision to Axe 'The Late Show with Stephen Colbert'","text":"Washington DC [US], July 19 (ANI): 'The Late Show with Stephen Colbert,' one of the most popular American talk shows, will end its 10 years long run on CBS, stated the network.

On July 18, 2025, Trump took to Truth Social to announce a “POWERHOUSE Lawsuit” over a WSJ story claiming he sent Jeffrey Epstein a “bawdy” 2003 birthday letter, complete with a hand-drawn outline of a naked woman and a “Donald” signature mimicking a questionable doodle. Trump’s response? “These are not my words, not the way I talk. Also, I don’t draw pictures,” he said, calling the story “false, malicious, and defamatory” and the WSJ a “useless rag.” The lawsuit, filed in Miami’s federal court, comes amid a firestorm over Epstein’s files, with Trump’s MAGA base clamouring for transparency while he’s simultaneously dodging the fallout from this alleged letter. Trump claims he personally warned Murdoch and WSJ editor Emma Tucker that the story was a “scam,” but they published it anyway. Vice President JD Vance backed him up on X, calling the report “complete and utter bullshit,” while White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said the WSJ didn’t even have the letter in hand. Murdoch vs. Trump: A Frenemy Feud Rupert Murdoch, 94, a longtime Trump ally through News Corp’s conservative outlets like Fox News, has navigated a rocky relationship with the president. While Murdoch’s media empire bolstered Trump’s rise, tensions flared after Fox distanced itself post-January 6, 2021, per CNN. Recent Oval Office meetings and Lachlan Murdoch’s presence at Trump’s events show continued ties, yet the WSJ’s editorial independence has clashed with Trump’s expectations, as seen in its criticism of his tariff policies, per The Guardian. The lawsuit, dubbed a “historic legal action” by Trump, sets the stage for a high-stakes showdown, with analysts sceptical of its success due to defamation law’s high bar for public figures, per Reuters. The case could drag on, with Trump relishing the prospect of deposing Murdoch, stating, “That will be an interesting experience!!!”. Epstein Files and Political Heat This legal slugfest dovetails with Trump’s push to unseal Epstein grand jury testimony, a move ordered hours after the WSJ story broke to appease his base’s demands for a supposed “client list”—which the DOJ says doesn’t exist. Attorney General Pamela Bondi filed to unseal the records on July 18, but legal experts warn the process could take months, with heavy redactions likely to protect victims’ privacy.

When he was speaker of the House in 2023, Democrats “never once” requested an investigation into Epstein, McCarthy said. \n\n“They tried to hide from it,” the former speaker told Watters. “You know, they’ve got nothing going. It shows in the poll, they have no leader, they have no message, they have no policy. So they’re lashing out at this. “\n\n“But what I love, even watching CNN, they are failing. We think about it for one moment. This is the most transparent president we’ve had, Donald Trump. He’s before the press every single day. Look what he’s accomplished, exactly what we elected him to do,” McCarthy continued. “[Trump] didn’t hide from this, he had the authorities investigate this.”\n\nHis comments reiterate Trump’s statement on Friday that criticized Democrats for not releasing more files related to the Epstein case when they controlled the Senate and White House during the Biden years. \n\n“If there was a ‘smoking gun’ on Epstein, why didn’t the Dems, who controlled the ‘files’ for four years, and had [former Attorney General Merrick] Garland and [ex-prosecutor Maureen] Comey in charge, use it,” Trump wrote on Truth Social. “BECAUSE THEY HAD NOTHING!!!”\n\nThe president’s statement follows efforts this week by Democrats in both chambers of Congress to investigate Epstein. \n\nIn the upper chamber, Sen. Chris Van Hollen (D-MD) is pushing a measure to help preserve records related to the Epstein case. Sens. Jon Ossoff (D-GA) and Ruben Gallego (D-AZ) are among others in the Senate accusing Trump of “hiding the Epstein list.” \n\nIn the lower chamber, House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries (D-NY), House Judiciary Committee ranking member Jamie Raskin (D-MD), and Reps. Pramila Jayapal (D-WA), Marc Veasey (D-TX), and Ro Khanna (D-CA) are among a flock of lawmakers calling for the Trump administration to release all documents and other information related to Epstein.\n\n“The American people deserve to know the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth as it relates to this whole sordid Jeffrey Epstein matter,” Jeffries said Monday. “Democrats didn’t put the Epstein matter into the public domain. This was a conspiracy that Donald Trump, Pam Bondi, and these MAGA extremists have been fanning the flames of for the last several years, and now the chickens are coming to roost.”\n\nMany Republican lawmakers, including House Majority Leader Mike Johnson (R-LA) and Rep. Thomas Massie (R-KY), as well as MAGA supporters, are also clamoring for more information related to the case as the Justice Department faces more criticism for its handling of the Epstein files. \n\nAsked by reporters Thursday if he supports using congressional authority to investigate the Epstein matter, Johnson replied, ”Look, we’ll see how it all develops.”\n\n“We’re for transparency. I’ve said that repeatedly, so has the president,” he continued. “And all the credible information needs to come out, and the American people need to make their own decisions.”\n\nTrump has long promised to release the files, and at his direction, Attorney General Pam Bondi began leading the DOJ in releasing information on Epstein. \n\nBut the rollout stirred controversy when the DOJ and FBI issued a joint memo earlier this month concluding Epstein’s 2019 death was a suicide and that he did not have a “client list” of powerful individuals he was blackmailing by bribing them with sex with minors. \n\nTrump has said in recent weeks that claims that there was a client list were spread by the “fake news” and Democrats looking to sabotage his administration. \n\n“Their new SCAM is what we will forever call the Jeffrey Epstein Hoax, and my PAST supporters have bought into this ‘bulls***,’ hook, line, and sinker. They haven’t learned their lesson, and probably never will, even after being conned by the Lunatic Left for 8 long years. I have had more success in 6 months than perhaps any President in our Country’s history, and all these people want to talk about, with strong prodding by the Fake News and the success starved Dems, is the Jeffrey Epstein Hoax,” he said on Wednesday.\n\nHowever, the Justice Department’s move to release surveillance camera footage outside of Epstein’s cell from Aug. 9, 2019, the day he died, has also fueled debate about transparency. \n\nWhile Bondi called the footage “raw,” or unedited, journalists at Wired discovered that the video uploaded by the DOJ “was modified” and “assembled from at least two source clips, saved multiple times, exported, and then uploaded to the DOJ’s website.”\n\nWHAT THE GOVERNMENT STILL WON’T REVEAL ABOUT JEFFREY EPSTEIN\n\nAmid the growing divisions, Trump ordered Bondi to release relevant grand jury testimony on Thursday evening in Epstein’s case.\n\n“Based on the ridiculous amount of publicity given to Jeffrey Epstein, I have asked Attorney General Pam Bondi to produce any and all pertinent Grand Jury testimony, subject to Court approval,” he said. “This SCAM, perpetuated by the Democrats, should end, right now!”","summary":"Former House Speaker Kevin McCarthy on Thursday suggested that Democrats attacking President Donald Trump over his handling of investigations into convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein are hypocrites.&#160; Democrats have ramped up pressure against Trump for not releasing Epstein’s “client list” and other information, even as the Department of Justice says no such list exists and [&#8230;]","url":"https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/house/3476288/kevin-mccarthy-democrats-never-asked-epstein-files-speaker/","image":"https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Kevin-McCarthy-Biden-scaled-1024x682.webp","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-07-19 00:04:49","author":"Emily Hallas","authors":["Emily Hallas"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.345},{"id":343057776,"title":"Trump sues Wall Street Journal and Murdoch over reporting on Epstein ties","text":"President Donald Trump filed a lawsuit on Friday against The Wall Street Journal and media mogul Rupert Murdoch, a day after the newspaper published a story reporting on ties to wealthy financier Jeffrey Epstein.\n\nThe lawsuit was filed in federal court in Miami.

Symptoms like swollen ankles, unexplained bruises, or a persistent limp may appear minor, but they could be the body's way of signalling something more serious beneath the surface,\" Bansal told ANI.\nHe explained that while CVI is a common age-related vascular issue, it can mask underlying causes like deep vein thrombosis, heart failure or renal dysfunction.\nAlso Read | Odisha Higher Education Department Orders Mandatory Display of Women Helpline Number and Urgent Sensitisation on Sexual Harassment Laws Across All Universities and Colleges Following Student's Tragic Death.\nHe pointed out that proactive clinical evaluation, not photo speculation, is essential to rule out serious pathology and prevent delays in care.\n\"While occasional swelling or bruising may be harmless, recurring or unexplained symptoms deserve attention. A timely medical evaluation can help uncover underlying causes and prevent complications. Your body whispers before it screams, listen early,\" he said.\nHe stated that in CVI, timely interventions, such as compression therapy, elevation, or exercise, can prevent progression.\n\"Early detection transforms what could become serious into a manageable condition. For older adults (like Trump, age 79), this vigilance becomes even more important,\" Dr Bansal said.\nDr Virender K Sheorain, Associate Director, Peripheral Vascular and Endovascular Sciences, Medanta, Gurugram, said swelling and pigmentation in the legs are ideally the first step or warning signs. \"The first step when one notices swelling and pigmentation in the legs is to consult a physician, ideally a vascular specialist. They may recommend a duplex ultrasound scan with colour Doppler of the legs to assess blood flow, health of veins and valves in the leg veins. Ignoring symptoms for long can lead to progression of disease and complications like skin wounds or venous ulcers and persistent leg swelling,\" Sheorain said.\nHe said that lifestyle plays a significant role in managing Chronic Venous Insufficiency (CVI), adding that daily use of compression stockings improves blood return and reduces swelling, while elevating one's legs whenever possible helps drain pooled blood.\n\"Regular walking or calf exercises boost circulation via the 'muscle pump,' and weight management reduces pressure on leg veins. Additionally, it's important to avoid long periods of sitting or standing by moving every 30-60 minutes,\" he said.\n\"As CVI is a slowly progressive disease, it usually starts as minor leg fatigue or swelling and can evolve into skin changes, pigmentation, varicose veins, or even non-healing ulcers. Hence, early consultation with a Vascular Specialist and appropriate timely intervention can prevent irreversible skin damage, improve quality of life, and avoid more invasive treatments,\" he added. Dr Pankaj Kumar Hans, Director & Head Unit (II)- General, Laparoscopic, Bariatric, Laser & Robotic Surgery, Asian Hospital, told ANI that CVI, particularly in a septuagenarian such as former President Trump, is neither rare nor inherently dangerous.\n\"It reflects age-related weakening or damage of the venous valves, leading to blood pooling and ankle swelling. The key concern is ruling out deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and arterial blockage, both of which appear to be absent based on the available reports. Management is straightforward: compression therapy, leg elevation, regular walking and weight control,\" he said.\n\"For many, conservative measures suffice, though minimally invasive interventions like endovenous ablation may be necessary in persistent or advanced cases. It's important to emphasise to patients that early diagnosis and consistent use of compression stockings aren't cosmetic; they prevent long-term skin changes, ulcers, and significant discomfort,\" he added.

For the late-night genre, there are unique factors to consider.\n\nAs recently as 2018, broadcast networks took in an estimated $439 million in advertising revenue for its late-night programs, according to the advertising firm Guidelines. Last year, that number dwindled to $220 million.\n\nOnce a draw for young men, now they’ve turned away\n\nLate-night TV was a particular draw for young men, considered the hardest-to-get and most valuable demographic for advertisers. Increasingly, these viewers are turning to streaming services, either to watch something else entirely or catch highlights of the late-night shows, which are more difficult for the networks to monetize.\n\nMore broadly, the much-predicted takeover of viewers by streaming services is coming to pass. The Nielsen company reported that during the last two months, for the first time ever, more people consumed programming on services like YouTube and Netflix than on ABC, CBS and NBC or any cable network.\n\nNetworks and streamers spent roughly $70 billion on entertainment shows and $30 billion for sports rights last year, said Brian Wieser, CEO of Madison & Wall, an advertising consultant and data services firm. Live sports is the most dependable magnet for viewers and costs for its rights are expected to increase 8% a year over the next decade. With television viewership declining in general, it’s clear where savings will have to come from.\n\nWieser said he does not know whether Colbert’s show is profitable or not for CBS and parent company Paramount Global, but he knows the direction in which it is headed. “The economics of television are weak,” he said.\n\nIn a statement announcing the cancellation, George Cheeks, Paramount Global’s president and chief executive officer, said that “This is purely a financial decision against a challenging backdrop in late night. It is not related in any way to the show’s performance, content or other matters happening at Paramount.”\n\nCheeks’ problem is that not everyone believes him.\n\nColbert is a relentless critic of Trump, and earlier this week pointedly criticized Paramount’s decision to settle Trump’s lawsuit against CBS over a “60 Minutes” interview with Kamala Harris. He called Paramount’s $16 million payment to Trump a “big fat bribe,” since the company is seeking the administration’s approval of its merger with Skydance Media.\n\nOn Friday, the Writers Guild of America called for an investigation by New York’s attorney general into whether Colbert’s cancellation is itself a bribe, “sacrificing free speech to curry favor with the Trump administration as the company looks for merger approval.”\n\nCBS’ decision made this a pivotal week for the future of television and radio programming. Congress stripped federal funding for PBS and NPR, threatening the future of shows on those outlets.\n\nJourney Gunderson, executive director of the National Comedy Center, called the decision to end Colbert’s show the end of an era.\n\n“Late-night television has historically been one of comedy’s most audience-accessible platforms — a place where commentary meets community, night after night,” Gunderson said. “This isn’t just the end of a show. It’s the quiet removal of one of the few remaining platforms for daily comedic commentary.\n\nTrump celebrates Colbert’s demise\n\nTrump, who has called in the past for CBS to terminate Colbert’s contract, celebrated the show’s upcoming demise. “I absolutely love that Colbert got fired,” the president wrote on Truth Social. “His talent was even less than his ratings.”\n\nSome experts questioned whether CBS could have explored other ways to save money on Colbert. NBC, for example, has cut costs by eliminating the band on Seth Meyers’ late-night show and curtailing Jimmy Fallon’s “Tonight” show to four nights a week.\n\nCould CBS have saved more money by cutting off the show immediately, instead of letting it run until next May, which sets up an awkward “lame duck” period? Then again, Colbert will keep working until his contract runs out; CBS would have had to keep paying him anyway.\n\nCBS recently cancelled the “After Midnight” show that ran after Colbert. But the network had signaled earlier this year that it was prepared to continue that show until host Taylor Tomlinson decided that she wanted to leave, noted Bill Carter, author of “The Late Shift.”\n\n“It is a very sad day for CBS that they are getting out of the late-night race,” Andy Cohen, host of Bravo’s “Watch What Happens Live,” told The Associated Press. “I mean, they are turning off the lights after the news.”\n\nColbert, if he wanted to continue past next May, would likely be able to find a streaming service willing to pay him, Wieser said. But the future of late-night comedy on the entertainment networks is genuinely at risk. Trump, in fact, may outlast his fiercest comic critics. Jon Stewart, once a weeknight fixture, works one night a week at “The Daily Show” for Paramount’s Comedy Central, a network that seldom produces much original programming any more.\n\nABC’s Jimmy Kimmel, who was chided on social media by Trump on Friday — “I hear Jimmy Kimmel is next” — has a contract that also runs out next year. Kimmel, 57, openly wondered in a Variety interview before signing his latest three-year contract extension how long he wanted to do it. He’s hosted his show since 2003.\n\n“I have moments where I go, I cannot do this anymore,” Kimmel told Variety in 2022. “And I have moments where I go, what am I gonna do with my life if I’m not doing this anymore?’ It’s a very complicated thing … I’m not going to do this forever.”\n\nColbert, Kimmel and Stewart were all nominated for Emmy awards this week.\n\nAP journalist Liam McEwan in Los Angeles contributed to this report.

Recent polling shows Americans have mixed views on the best immigration policies.\n\n Never miss a story — sign up for PEOPLE's free daily newsletter to stay up-to-date on the best of what PEOPLE has to offer​​, from celebrity news to compelling human interest stories.\n\n The history of Sánchez's legal status in the U.S. is complicated, according to her attorney.\n\n Fleeing Cuba, she first applied for U.S. asylum in 2019, during Trump's first term. At the time, his administration required asylum-seekers to wait in Mexico for an immigration hearing. Sánchez appeared before a judge in the U.S. once and was sent back to Mexico but then missed her second scheduled hearing in America.\n\n Not long after, while in Mexico, she went to a port of entry at the U.S. border and told the agents she had missed her appointment, at which point she learned that an order of removal was issued for her — which would have blocked her asylum claim — for having missed the previous appointment, according to Cañizares.\n\n The attorney says Sánchez was placed in detention in the U.S. for nine months and initially faced deportation back to Cuba. But she was ultimately released on a provisional basis and allowed to join her relatives in Tampa, Cañizares says, because Cuba refused to take her back.\n\n She was released on what's known as an order of supervision, which required that she check in with ICE once a year, Cañizares says.\n\n While in Tampa, Sánchez, 44, met her husband, Valle, a naturalized citizen also from Cuba, and she studied to become a nursing assistant. \n\n Sánchez underwent multiple rounds of in vitro fertilization, and the couple welcomed Kailyn in November 2023.\n\n Cañizares says Sánchez, who worked as a home health aide before she was deported in the spring, was scheduled to have a check-in appointment at an ICE office in Tampa at the end of April, but it was moved up.\n\n On the day of her appointment, Sánchez took Kailyn, Valle and another attorney from Cañizares' firm with her. Her husband was not allowed to attend the meeting, and federal agents told her she was being taken into custody and that she should hand over her daughter to relatives, Cañizares alleges.\n\n \"She told them, 'I want to take my daughter,' and they said, 'No, your daughter is a U.S. citizen. She has to stay,' \" Cañizares says. \"And they told the attorney that was inside with her, 'You need to take the baby outside to the dad.' \"\n\n Sánchez's absence has been traumatizing for Kailyn, Cañizares says, including because she was still breastfeeding when Sánchez was deported.\n\n For now, they speak multiple times a day, every day, when Sánchez is able to get an internet signal given that Cuba experiences regular power outages.\n\n Cañizares says the family is seeking humanitarian parole for Sánchez or for her to obtain an immigrant visa, either of which would allow her back into the country.\n\n Rep. Kathy Castor, a Democrat who represents Tampa, asked Trump in a letter to allow for Sánchez's return, according to a copy which was shared with PEOPLE.\n\n Castor wrote, in part, asking that the president grant Sánchez humanitarian parole: \"Due to the suffocating oppression in Cuba and lack of essentials like food and clean water, Ms. Sánchez should not be trafficked to a country where she will be harmed and suffer.\"","summary":"Heidy Sánchez's husband, Carlos Valle, and their daughter, Kailyn, are both U.S. citizens and remain in Tampa, Fla.","url":"https://people.com/woman-deported-to-cuba-says-she-wasnt-given-option-to-bring-daughter-11775309","image":"https://people.com/thmb/7wpElLOgbOdVqkOeqU11LfA6H6c=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(761x399:763x401)/Heidy-Sanchez-Kailyn-Carlos-Valle-071825-4db006ab329842839660fae599e7a625.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-07-18 23:54:30","author":"Janelle Griffith","authors":["Janelle Griffith"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.249},{"id":343054634,"title":"World News | Trump Sues Wall Street Journal and Rupert Murdoch over Reporting on Epstein Ties","text":"Washington, Jul 19 (AP) President Donald Trump filed a lawsuit Friday against media mogul Rupert Murdoch and The Wall Street Journal over the newspaper's reporting on ties between Trump and disgraced financier Jeffery Epstein.

Jeffrey Epstein loved collecting prominent men as friends and revelling in their approval.\n\nSo when it came to his 50th birthday in 2003, his long-time friend and sidekick Ghislaine Maxwell knew that nothing would please him more as a present than a tribute to these connections – to remind the multi-millionaire son of a park groundsman from working-class Coney Island just how far he'd come.\n\nMaxwell, an Oxford-educated socialite, asked dozens of Epstein's friends and associates to contribute letters and notes about him to go into a leather-bound album.\n\nAnd they were only too happy to oblige. This, after all, was still three years before his arrest for sexually abusing underage girls in his Palm Beach mansion and the truth about his sordid criminality was yet to emerge.\n\nThis book, whose existence has previously never been disclosed – even though it is reportedly in the hands of the US Department of Justice – has now been seen by the Wall Street Journal.\n\nAnd according to the newspaper, it contains one particular entry that has sent shockwaves across the US and prompted furious threats of a lawsuit from the Oval Office. A letter bearing Donald Trump's name was included in the tome. Like others, it was 'bawdy', the Journal said.\n\nThis letter, which the newspaper did not publish but only described, was said to contain 'several lines of typewritten text framed by the outline of a naked woman, which appears to be hand-drawn with a heavy marker'.\n\nAccording to the WSJ: 'A pair of small arcs denotes the woman's breasts, and the future president's signature is a squiggly \"Donald\" below her waist, mimicking pubic hair.'\n\nThe letter – which ends 'Happy Birthday – and may every day be another wonderful secret' – is an imaginary conversation between Trump and Epstein. It's a strange, very cryptic exchange which, given the storm it's caused, is worth reporting in full\n\nIt begins: 'Voice Over: There must be more to life than having everything. \n\nDonald: Yes, there is, but I won't tell you what it is.\n\nJeffrey: Nor will I, since I also know what it is.\n\nDonald: We have certain things in common, Jeffrey.\n\nJeffrey: Yes, we do, come to think of it.\n\nDonald: Enigmas never age, have you noticed that?\n\nJeffrey: As a matter of fact, it was clear to me the last time I saw you.\n\nDonald: A pal is a wonderful thing. Happy Birthday – and may every day be another wonderful secret.'\n\nTrump has denied writing the birthday letter or drawing the picture and has said he will sue the Journal for ignoring his demands not to publish the story, which he described as 'false, malicious, and defamatory'.\n\nHe told the newspaper: 'This is not me. This is a fake thing. It's a fake Wall Street Journal story.\n\n'I never wrote a picture in my life. I don't draw pictures of women. It's not my language. It's not my words.'\n\nYesterday, the President upped the ante in characteristic style, stating on social media that he planned to sue Rupert Murdoch, owner of the Journal.\n\n'I look forward to getting Rupert Murdoch to testify in my lawsuit against him and his \"pile of garbage\" newspaper,' Trump wrote on his Truth Social platform. 'That will be an interesting experience!!!'\n\nThe President's claim that he doesn't draw was disputed yesterday by those who supplied sketches he'd done of skyscrapers and recalled him writing of his 'new talent' of drawing in his 2008 book, How I Turned My Biggest Challenges Into Success.\n\nHe must be hoping that the scepticism ends there.\n\nMeanwhile, the lewd birthday greeting and the suggestion that the two men shared a 'secret', couldn't have surfaced at a worse moment for the US President, who has spent recent days fighting off accusations from his own supporters that his government is involved in a huge cover-up over the Epstein scandal.\n\nTrump has called them 'stupid' and accused them of being dupes of a Democrat-spun 'hoax' to undermine him.\n\nBut he and some of his cronies – including, ironically, two who are now running the FBI – have only themselves to blame for this MAGA backlash as they have themselves long encouraged speculation about a conspiracy to protect the identities of powerful men who were supplied with girls by Epstein.\n\nTrump pledged in his 2024 election campaign to declassify Epstein files, including a much-anticipated 'list' of clients of the financier's sex-trafficking ring.\n\nHowever, the Trump administration has now claimed that no such evidence exists.\n\nThe Department of Justice and FBI released a joint review on Thursday concluding that Epstein had 'no incriminating client list' that could implicate high-profile associates.\n\nAlthough the Wall Street Journal reported that it was unclear whether his 50th birthday album was among the Epstein evidence recently reviewed by the Justice Department and FBI, some will inevitably be speculating that if anyone's been covering up over Epstein, it's the current President.\n\nTrump has now backtracked and said he had asked Pam Bondi, his attorney-general, to release the grand jury testimony on Epstein.\n\nWhatever this might disclose, the alleged birthday note has shifted the focus back on the Trump-Epstein relationship little more than a month after Elon Musk astonishingly claimed that his former close friend and ally was 'in the Epstein files', stating that was 'the real reason they have not been made public'.\n\nTrump has long attempted to play down the extent of his association with Epstein, who died in a New York jail cell in 2019 while awaiting a sex-trafficking trial.\n\nHowever, it's no secret they were friends when they moved in the same moneyed social circles in Palm Beach, Florida, from the late 1980s until 2004 (just a year after the birthday greetings message) when they reportedly fell out over a property they both wanted to buy.\n\nThey attended numerous parties together and it's claimed that in 1992, Trump arranged for a 'calendar girl' competition for 'VIP guests' to be held at his Palm Beach home, Mar-a-Lago, where he and Epstein were the only two men watching the 28 glamorous contestants.\n\nTrump's name appeared seven times in the passenger logs of Epstein's private jets. In fact, Epstein was recorded boasting to biographer Michael Wolff that the first time Trump slept with his future wife Melania 'was on my plane'.\n\nWolff also claimed that Trump and Epstein challenged each other as to who could be the first to sleep with Princess Diana.\n\nLast month, the author said he'd seen photos of Trump and Epstein in the company of topless girls.\n\nIt's a matter of record that Trump was sufficiently acquainted with Epstein to know about his preference for 'younger' women. In 2002, he was quoted in a magazine article about the mysterious financier as saying: 'I've known Jeff for 15 years. Terrific guy.\n\n'He's a lot of fun to be with. It is even said he likes beautiful women as much as I do, and many of them are on the younger side.'\n\nNowadays, Trump remembers Epstein as a 'creep' of whom 'I wasn't a fan', but he's hardly the only one who has spent the years since Epstein's death doing his level best to distance himself from the paedophile predator.\n\nWho else might be embarrassed by the full contents of Epstein's 50th birthday album being made public? Apart from mentioning an unnamed but now deceased Harvard University economist, the Wall Street Journal names only two others who submitted letters: billionaire fashion retailer Les Wexner and lawyer Alan Dershowitz. Both have been connected to Epstein for years.\n\nWexner, the former chief executive of lingerie company Victoria's Secret, hired Epstein to manage his money for 20 years until 2007. They had a close but puzzling relationship in which Epstein obtained his mansion home in New York, a private plane and a property in Ohio – altogether worth $100 million – from Wexner.\n\nWexner has since claimed he 'severed all ties with Epstein in 2007 and never spoke with him again'. However, according to the Journal, just four years earlier, Wexner wrote a short birthday message to Epstein: 'I wanted to get you what you want… so here it is…' After the text was a line drawing of what appeared to be a woman's breasts. Wexner declined to comment to the newspaper.\n\nDershowitz, a celebrated Harvard legal expert, was one of Epstein's highly paid defence lawyers and was also part of the team that defended Trump from 2020 impeachment charges. He was involved in a long-running legal battle with Virginia Giuffre, an accuser of both Epstein and Prince Andrew, over allegations he engaged in sexual misconduct. Ms Giuffre later said she had misidentified the lawyer.\n\nDershowitz's contribution to the birthday album was a mock-up page of a magazine titled 'Vanity Unfair' containing headlines such as 'Who was Jack the Ripper? Was it Jeffrey Epstein?'. Dershowitz 'joked that he had convinced the magazine to change the focus of an article from Epstein to Bill Clinton', the Journal said. He told the newspaper: 'It's been a long time and I don't recall the content of what I may have written.'\n\nOther contributors to the birthday album sent poems, photos and 'greetings', and the senders included 'businesspeople, academics, Epstein's former girlfriends and childhood pals', it's claimed.\n\nGiven that many of Epstein's friends – including Prince Andrew – continued to associate with him even after he was convicted of procuring a child for prostitution in 2009, the possibilities of who might have sent birthday greetings before he was ever engulfed in scandal are almost endless.\n\nMany of the women who accused Epstein of abusing them have since testified how he used the respectability of many of his contacts to lure them into his web.\n\nThe most famous among his friends included Bill Clinton, Microsoft founder Bill Gates, filmmaker Woody Allen and music superstar Michael Jackson. Joanna Sjoberg, one of Prince Andrew's accusers, testified that Epstein had told her Clinton 'likes them young, referring to girls'.\n\nHowever, Epstein – a former maths teacher who insiders say considered himself an intellectual – didn't just court celebrities but also scientists and academics whose research he often financed.\n\n'As some collect butterflies, he collects beautiful minds,' gushed a US magazine profile of Epstein in 2002.\n\nHe even knew Professor Stephen Hawking, the illustrious British physicist, who was almost completely paralysed for more than 40 years by motor neurone disease.\n\nProf Hawking died in 2018 but others who had far closer associations with Epstein are very much still alive.\n\nWhen sweet-talking Ghislaine Maxwell came looking for gushing tributes to dear Jeffrey at the height of his power and influence in 2003, who could possibly have refused?\n\nDonald Trump cannot be the only one now anxiously hoping that curious Americans will move on again from the Epstein scandal.","summary":"The US President has been accused of sending Jeffrey Epstein a 'bawdy' message on his 50th birthday containing 'several lines of typewritten text framed by the outline of a naked woman'.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-14920237/Donald-Trump-message-Jeffrey-Epstein-50th-birthday.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/07/19/00/100445475-0-image-m-73_1752881728262.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-07-18 23:53:50","author":"Editor,Tom Leonard","authors":["Editor","Tom Leonard"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":0.049},{"id":343053820,"title":"Trump sues Wall Street Journal over Epstein report, seeks $10 billion","text":"NEW YORK/WASHINGTON - U.S. President Donald Trump sued the Wall Street Journal and its owners including Rupert Murdoch on Friday, seeking at least $10 billion in damages over the newspaper's report that Trump in 2003 sent Jeffrey Epstein a birthday greeting that included a sexually suggestive drawing and a reference to secrets they shared.Trump filed the lawsuit in federal court in the Southern District of Florida against Dow Jones, News Corp., Rupert Murdoch and two Wall Street Journal reporters, accusing the defendants of defamation and saying they acted with malicious intent that caused him overwhelming financial and reputational harm.Trump has vehemently denied the Journal report, which Reuters has not verified, and warned Murdoch, the founder of News Corp., that he planned to sue.

Maduro described Friday as “a day of blessings and good news for Venezuela” during his address to a gathering of agriculture producers.\n\n“Today is the perfect day for Venezuela,” he said. “Today has been a splendid day.”\n\nVenezuelans leave El Salvador’s mega-prison\n\nCentral to the deal are more than 250 Venezuelan migrants freed by El Salvador, which in March agreed to a $6 million payment from the Trump administration to house them in its notorious prison. \n\nThat arrangement drew immediate blowback when Trump invoked an 18th century wartime law, the Alien Enemies Act, to quickly remove the men that his administration had accused of belonging to the violent Tren de Aragua street gang, teeing up a legal fight that reached the U.S. Supreme Court. The administration did not provide evidence to back up those claims.\n\nThe Venezuelans have been held in a mega-prison known as the Terrorism Confinement Center, or CECOT, which was built to hold alleged gang members in Bukele’s war on the country’s gangs. Human rights groups have documented hundreds of deaths as well as cases of torture inside its walls.\n\nLawyers have little access to those in the prison, which is heavily guarded, and information has been locked tight, other than heavily produced state propaganda videos showing tattooed men packed behind bars.\n\nPhotos and videos released by El Salvador’s government on Friday showed shackled Venezuelans sitting in a fleet of buses and boarding planes surrounded by officers in riot gear. One man looked up and pointed toward the sky as he climbed aboard a plane, while another made an obscene gesture toward police.\n\nIn April, in a heated exchange of diplomatic letters with Venezuela, Bukele proposed exchanging the Venezuelans for the same number of what he called “political prisoners” held by Maduro. It provoked a harsh response from Venezuelan authorities, who called his comments “cynical” and referred to Bukele as a “neofascist.”\n\nFamilies say the Americans released are innocent\n\nThe State Department office responsible for negotiating the release of American detainees posted a photo Friday evening of the newly released prisoners smiling for the camera inside an airplane bringing them home, some clutching an unfurled American flag.\n\nAmong those released was 37-year-old Lucas Hunter, whose family says he was kidnapped in January by Venezuelan border guards from inside Colombia, where he was vacationing.\n\n“We cannot wait to see him in person and help him recover from the ordeal,” his younger sister Sophie Hunter said.\n\nVenezuelan authorities detained nearly a dozen U.S. citizens in the second half of 2024 and linked them to alleged plots to destabilize the country.\n\n“We have prayed for this day for almost a year. My brother is an innocent man who was used as a political pawn by the Maduro regime,” said a statement from Christian Casteneda, whose brother Wilbert, a Navy SEAL, was arrested in his Caracas hotel room last year.\n\nGlobal Reach, a nonprofit organization that had advocated for his release and that of several other Americans, said Venezuelan officials initially and falsely accused him of being involved in a coup but backed off that claim.\n\nThe three-country swap gives Maduro a boost \n\nThe release of the Venezuelans, meanwhile, is an invaluable win for Maduro as he presses his efforts to assert himself as president despite credible evidence that he lost reelection last year. \n\nLong accused of human rights abuses, Maduro for months has used the migrants’ detention in El Salvador to flip the script on the U.S. government, forcing even some of his strongest political opponents to agree with his condemnation of the migrants’ treatment.\n\nTheir return will allow Maduro to reaffirm support within his shrinking base, while demonstrating that even if the Trump administration and other nations see him as an illegitimate president, he is still firmly in power.\n\nJust a week ago, the U.S. State Department reiterated its policy of shunning Maduro government officials and recognizing only the National Assembly elected in 2015 as the legitimate government of the country. Signed by Rubio, the cable said U.S. officials are free to meet and have discussions with National Assembly members “but cannot engage with Maduro regime representatives unless cleared by the Department of State.”\n\nMaduro’s crackdown on dissent spurs detentions\n\nThe Americans were among dozens of people, including activists, opposition members and union leaders, that Venezuela’s government took into custody in its brutal campaign to crack down on dissent in the 11 months since Maduro claimed to win reelection.\n\nBesides the U.S., several other Western nations also do not recognize Maduro’s claim to victory. They instead point to tally sheets collected by the opposition coalition showing that its candidate, Edmundo González, won the July 2024 election by a more than a two-to-one margin. \n\nThe dispute over results prompted immediate protests, and the government responded by detaining more than 2,000 people, mostly poor young men. González fled into exile in Spain to avoid arrest.\n\nMore than 7.7 million Venezuelans have migrated since 2013, when its oil-dependent economy came undone and Maduro became president. Most settled in Latin America and the Caribbean, but after the COVID-19 pandemic, many saw the U.S. as their best chance to improve their living conditions.\n\nThe US and Venezuela have agreed on other releases\n\nDespite the U.S. not recognizing Maduro, the two governments have carried out other recent exchanges. \n\nIn May, Venezuela freed a U.S. Air Force veteran after about six months in detention. Scott St. Clair’s family has said the language specialist, who served four tours in Afghanistan, had traveled to South America to seek treatment for post-traumatic stress disorder.\n\nThree months earlier, six other Americans whom the U.S. government considered wrongfully detained in Venezuela were released after Richard Grenell, Trump’s envoy for special missions, met with Maduro at the presidential palace. \n\nGrenell, during the meeting in Caracas, urged Maduro to take back deported migrants who have committed crimes in the U.S. Hundreds of Venezuelans have since been deported to their home country, including 251 people, including seven children, who arrived Friday.\n\nMaduro’s government had accused the Trump administration of “kidnapping” the children by placing them in foster care after their parents were deported.\n\nTucker reported from Washington and Janetsky from Mexico City.

The EPA said in May it would shift its scientific expertise and research efforts to program offices that focus on major issues like air and water.\n\nThe agency said Friday it is creating a new Office of Applied Science and Environmental Solutions that will allow it to focus on research and science “more than ever before.”\n\nOnce fully implemented, the changes will save the EPA nearly $750 million, officials said.\n\nEPA Administrator Lee Zeldin said in a statement that the changes announced Friday would ensure the agency “is better equipped than ever to deliver on our core mission of protecting human health and the environment, while Powering the Great American Comeback.”\n\nThe EPA also said it is beginning the process to eliminate thousands of jobs, following a Supreme Court ruling last week that cleared the way for President Donald Trump’s plans to downsize the federal workforce, despite warnings that critical government services will be lost and hundreds of thousands of federal employees will be out of their jobs.\n\nTotal staffing at EPA will go down to 12,448, a reduction of more than 3,700 employees, or nearly 23%, from staffing levels in January when Trump took office, the agency said.\n\n“This reduction in force will ensure we can better fulfill that mission while being responsible stewards of your hard-earned tax dollars,” Zeldin said, using a government term for mass firings.‘\n\nRep. Zoe Lofgren of California, the top Democrat on the House Science Committee, called the elimination of the research office “a travesty.”\n\n“The Trump administration is firing hardworking scientists while employing political appointees whose job it is to lie incessantly to Congress and to the American people,” she said. “The obliteration of ORD will have generational impacts on Americans’ health and safety.”\n\nThe Office of Research and Development “is the heart and brain of the EPA,” said Justin Chen, president of American Federation of Government Employees Council 238, which represents thousands of EPA employees.\n\n“Without it, we don’t have the means to assess impacts upon human health and the environment,” Chen said. “Its destruction will devastate public health in our country.”\n\nThe research office — EPA’s main science arm — currently has 1,540 positions, excluding special government employees and public health officers, according to agency documents reviewed by Democratic staff on the House science panel earlier this year.

It seeks at least $10 billion in damages.\n\nTrump promised a lawsuit after The Wall Street Journal described a sexually suggestive letter that the newspaper says bore Trump’s name and was included in a 2003 album for Epstein’s 50th birthday. Trump denied writing the letter, calling the story “false, malicious, and defamatory.”\n\nThe letter revealed by The Wall Street Journal was reportedly collected by disgraced British socialite Ghislaine Maxwell as part of a birthday album for Epstein years before the wealthy financier was first arrested in 2006 and subsequently had a falling-out with Trump.\n\nThe letter bearing Trump’s name includes text framed by the outline of what appears to be a hand-drawn naked woman and ends with, “Happy Birthday — and may every day be another wonderful secret,” according to the newspaper.\n\nThe outlet described the contents of the letter but did not publish a photo showing it entirely or provide details on how it came to learn about it.\n\nTHIS IS A BREAKING NEWS UPDATE. AP’s earlier story follows below.\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) — The Justice Department asked a federal court on Friday to unseal grand jury transcripts in Jeffrey Epstein’s case at the direction of President Donald Trump amid a firestorm over the administration’s handling of records related to the wealthy financier.\n\nThe move — coming a day after a Wall Street Journal story put a spotlight on Trump’s relationship with Epstein — seeks to contain a growing controversy that has engulfed the administration since it announced that it would not be releasing more government files from Epstein’s sex trafficking case.\n\nDeputy Attorney General Todd Blanche filed motions urging the court to unseal the Epstein transcripts as well as those in the case against British socialite Ghislaine Maxwell, who was convicted of luring teenage girls to be sexually abused by Epstein. Epstein killed himself in 2019 shortly after his arrest while awaiting trial.\n\nThe Justice Department’s announcement that it would not be making public any more Epstein files enraged parts of Trump’s base in part because members of his own administration had hyped the expected release and stoked conspiracies around the well-connected financier.\n\nTrump’s demand to release the grand jury transcripts came after The Wall Street Journal reported Thursday on a sexually suggestive letter that the newspaper says bore Trump’s name and was included in a 2003 album for Epstein’s 50th birthday.\n\nThe letter bearing Trump’s name includes text framed by the outline of what appears to be a hand-drawn naked woman and ends with, “Happy Birthday — and may every day be another wonderful secret,” according to the newspaper. The outlet described the contents of the letter but did not publish a photo showing it entirely.\n\nTrump denied writing the letter, calling it “false, malicious, and defamatory” and promised to sue. Trump said he spoke to both to the paper’s owner, Rupert Murdoch, and its top editor, Emma Tucker, and told them the letter was “fake.”\n\n“These are not my words, not the way I talk. Also, I don’t draw pictures,” the president wrote on social media.\n\nThe Justice Department said in the court filings that it will work with with prosecutors in New York to make appropriate redactions of victim-related information and other personally identifying information before transcripts are released.\n\n“Transparency in this process will not be at the expense of our obligation under the law to protect victims,” Blanche wrote.\n\nBut despite the new push to release the grand jury transcripts, the administration has not announced plans to reverse course and release other evidence in its possession. Attorney General Pam Bondi had hyped the release of more materials after the first Epstein files disclosure in February sparked outrage because it contained no new revelations.\n\nA judge would have to approve the release of the grand jury transcripts, and it’s likely to be a lengthy process to decide what can become public and to make redactions to protect sensitive witness and victim information.\n\nThe records would show testimony of witnesses and other evidence that was presented by prosecutions during the secret grand jury proceedings, when a panel decides whether there is enough evidence to bring an indictment, or a formal criminal charge.\n\nNeumeister reported from New York.\n\n(Copyright (c) 2024 The Associated Press.

For them, the price tag isn't measured in billions of dollars, but in broken lives and uprooted communities.\n\n'Scores of people are set to see their homes flooded,' read a previous report on the project's local impact, which has been more than 45 years in the making.\n\nIf completed, the Sites Reservoir would become California's eighth-largest, holding 1.5 million acre-feet of water, or nearly 490 billion gallons - intended primarily for use in Southern and Central California, as well as the Bay Area.\n\nConstruction is still slated to begin next year with completion by 2033, Brown said. \n\nBut rising costs may force tough decisions on funding and prioritization.\n\nAlthough the Sites project received backing from both Congress and the Biden administration, with nearly $365 million in federal grants over the past three years, the newly projected cost spike has become a political lightning rod particularly as Trump-era tariffs are now being identified as a contributing factor.\n\nOn Wednesday, Brown presented the updated cost to the nine-member State Water Commission, which has already set aside $875 million in Proposition 1 bond funds for the project. \n\nCommissioner Daniel Curtin said 22 water agencies have committed planning money, with 16 more on a waiting list seeking extra water capacity.\n\n'The rubber hits the road when the money comes,' Curtin said. 'But it sounds like the commitments are pretty strong.'\n\nCommissioner Jose Solorio added: 'All of the state would benefit from the construction of this project.'\n\nCalifornia Republicans have largely avoided commenting on the tariff connection, while environmental groups are using the moment to revive their long-standing opposition to the plan.\n\n'The Sites Reservoir would harm the Sacramento River ecosystem, threaten already imperiled fish species, and release greenhouse gas pollution,' argued a lawsuit filed by conservationists, later dismissed in Yolo County Superior Court.\n\n'The project will cause much environmental harm, which falls on the public, and a small amount of good, which primarily benefits the project investors,' added Stork, senior policy advocate at Friends of the River. \n\n'Among other harms, the reservoir will be a major greenhouse gas emitter. A recent analysis estimated that Sites would emit the equivalent of 80,000 gasoline-powered cars each year.'\n\nOpponents lost their appeal last year, but they aren't backing down. 'It's not surprising,' said Ron Stork, policy director at Friends of the River. \n\n'Large mega-projects typically escalate in costs considerably from their initial estimates. There's a reason why these dams haven't been built yet.'\n\nStork added, 'We'll have to see if the wealthy urban water districts in Southern California and the Bay Area want to continue to invest in this project.' He estimated that the Sites Reservoir's odds of being built now stand at 'about 50-50.'\n\nThe backlash hasn't deterred Governor Newsom, who has thrown his full support behind the project as part of his broader water resilience strategy.\n\n'We are going to need more storage projects with climate change,' said Matt Keller, a spokesperson for the Santa Clara Valley Water District, one of the project's backers. 'Our board is evaluating several different water supply projects from around Northern California and locally, and has been following this one for a while.'\n\n'The longer we wait and the longer it takes to get this done, the more expensive it becomes,' Brown told reporters. 'Even though it is costing more, it is still something we need to do badly.'\n\nHe compared Sites to a savings account for future droughts: 'People look at all the water running through rivers in wet winters and say why can't we save more of that?'\n\nProponents argue that Sites is uniquely positioned to capture 'excess water from major storms' and store it for drier years, which are increasingly common as global temperatures rise.\n\nBut for critics, the project epitomizes the high environmental and social cost of mega-infrastructure in an era of climate uncertainty.\n\n'It's very difficult to justify the expense and environmental costs of big surface storage infrastructure projects,' said John Buse, an attorney at the Center for Biological Diversity. 'The Sites Reservoir will cause far more harm than good.'\n\nIronically, the project's price hike comes after a rare string of wet winters that have filled existing reservoirs to capacity. \n\nShasta Lake and Lake Oroville both overflowed for a third consecutive year in 2025.\n\nHad the reservoir already existed, Brown noted, Sites could have captured runoff from the past two wet winters. 'It would have filled to the top,' he said, adding that it would have diverted only about 3% of Delta flows during the wettest months. \n\nBut experts warn that complacency is dangerous. With California's precipitation increasingly concentrated into short, intense bursts followed by prolonged dry spells, the need for storage remains urgent.\n\n'Water scarcity is always just around the corner,' the project's website warns.\n\nBrown acknowledged that the project has drawn sharp scrutiny - but said history is on its side. \n\n'Rarely when looked back upon 20, 40 or 60 years later are these projects regretted in terms of the benefits to society,' he said. 'These are hard decisions to make as a society, but we are building this for ourselves and future generations.","summary":"The cost of California's massive Sites Reservoir project has surged by over $2 billion, with planners blaming Trump-era tariffs and pandemic fallout.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-14920023/trump-blamed-surge-cost-building-california-reservoir.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/07/18/23/84658265-0-The_13_mile_long_basin_in_Colusa_County_will_eventually_provide_-a-11_1752878400795.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-07-18 23:19:39","author":"Editor,James Gordon","authors":["Editor","James Gordon"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.12},{"id":343049556,"title":"Stephen Colbert: The death of the late night US chat show?","text":"Colbert told viewers The Late Show's cancellation was ultimately a financial decision - which is certainly a credible explanation.\n\nTelevision is expensive to make, with huge teams of producers, directors, camera operators and other technical staff, not to mention the large fee for the presenter. \n\nAnd while YouTubers can now offer an increasingly professional operation themselves, they can do so at a fraction of the cost.\n\nBut the cancellation still puzzled some.

The latest change came as uncertainty has mounted and there have been several delays in the TikTok deal now at the center of U.S.-China trade talks. Blackstone had planned to take a minority stake in the TikTok U.S. business in a deal orchestrated by President Donald Trump. The consortium is led by Susquehanna International Group and General Atlantic, current investors in TikTok's Chinese owner ByteDance. The group had emerged as the front-runner to secure TikTok’s U.S. business in a deal under which U.S. investors would own 80 per cent of TikTok, while ByteDance would retain a minority stake, Reuters reported.Blackstone’s exit highlights the complexities and uncertainties involved in the deal, as the ongoing talks over TikTok’s fate have now become part of Trump’s broader trade negotiations with China, and Trump said he would speak to President Xi Jinping about it.TikTok US DeadlineThe deadline for ByteDance to divest the popular social media app in the U.S. has been repeatedly postponed, creating uncertainty for investors. Last month, Trump signed a third executive order extending the deadline for ByteDance to sell TikTok or face a ban, moving the cutoff to September 17. In April 2024, Congress passed a law mandating a sale or shutdown of TikTok by January 19, 2025.Extensions to the deadline have drawn criticism from some lawmakers, who argue the Trump administration is “flouting the law” and ignoring national security concerns related to Chinese control over TikTok.Live EventsOptions for ByteDanceByteDance is exploring various options to address these concerns, including selling or restructuring its U.S. operations.

Oracle is also likely to take a stake. It is unclear whether other bidders in the consortium are still involved.A deal had been in the works this spring to spin off TikTok’s U.S. operations into a new U.S.-based firm. Talks were put on hold after China indicated it would not approve the transaction, following Trump’s announcement of steep tariffs on Chinese goods.If a sale is finalized, the new U.S. app is expected to be owned by a joint venture formed by an American investor consortium and ByteDance, which would maintain a minority stake.

Casper granted on June 13 in a case filed by Democratic state attorneys general. The judge said Friday that the part of Trump's order directing certain federal agencies to assess people's U.S. citizenship when they ask for voter registration forms will now only be blocked in the 19 states that filed the lawsuit. Also Read | 'There Should Be No Double Standards on Energy Trade': India Rejects EU's 18th Sanctions Package on Russia, Reaffirms Commitment to Energy Security. Election law experts said the modification will have little, if any, practical effect because a judge in a different lawsuit filed against the executive order also blocked the federal agencies from obeying the mandate in all 50 states. “If there are two partially overlapping orders, the effect of changing one of them would not change what is binding in the other,” said Rick Hasen, a law professor at the University of California, Los Angeles. Also Read | US Designates Lashkar Proxy TRF As 'Foreign Terrorist Organisation': A Glance at How Terror Outfit Operates With Pakistan Army. Friday's order follows a U.S. Supreme Court decision in an unrelated case that judges are limited in granting nationwide injunctions. Government lawyers pointed to that ruling in arguing the court needed to “narrow the scope” of the injunction in the elections case. The 19 Democratic attorneys general who filed the case told the judge they wouldn't object to the narrower scope. The rest of Casper's initial preliminary injunction against other aspects of the election executive order remains intact. In June, the judge blocked various parts of Trump's sweeping order, including a documentary proof-of-citizenship requirement on the federal voting form and a requirement that mailed ballots be received, rather than just postmarked, by Election Day. The government continues to fight the attorney generals' lawsuit, which was filed in federal court in Boston, and has a motion to dismiss it. The Department of Justice on Friday did not reply to multiple requests for comment. The development comes as other lawsuits challenging Trump's executive order on elections continue to play out. That includes the one with the other preliminary injunction, filed by Democrats and civil rights groups. It also includes another from Washington and Oregon, where voting is done almost entirely by mail ballot.

Dow Jones, the parent of the newspaper, is a division of News Corp.\n\n\"I look forward to getting Rupert Murdoch to testify in my lawsuit against him and his 'pile of garbage' newspaper, the WSJ. That will be an interesting experience!!!\" Trump said in a post on Truth Social on Friday morning.\n\nRepresentatives of Dow Jones, News Corp and Murdoch could not be reached for comment.\n\nDisgraced financier and sex offender Epstein died by suicide in a New York jail cell in 2019.\n\nAdvertisement · Scroll to continue\n\nThe case has generated conspiracy theories that became popular among Trump's base of supporters who believed the government was covering up Epstein's ties to the rich and powerful.\n\nSome of Trump's most loyal followers became furious after his administration reversed course on its promise to release files related to the Epstein investigation. A Justice Department memo released on July 7 concluded that Epstein killed himself and said there was \"no incriminating client list\" or evidence that Epstein blackmailed prominent people.\n\nAttorney General Pam Bondi had pledged months earlier to reveal major revelations about Epstein, including \"a lot of names\" and \"a lot of flight logs.\"\n\nWith pressure to release the Epstein files building, Trump on Thursday said he directed Bondi to ask a court to release grand jury testimony about Epstein.\n\nThe U.S. government on Friday filed a motion in Manhattan federal court to unseal grand jury transcripts in the cases of Epstein and his former associate Ghislaine Maxwell, who in 2021 was convicted of five federal charges related to her role in Epstein's sexual abuse of underage girls. She is serving a 20-year sentence.\n\n\"Public officials, lawmakers, pundits, and ordinary citizens remain deeply interested and concerned about the Epstein matter,\" Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche said in the filing. \"After all, Jeffrey Epstein is the most infamous pedophile in American history.\"\n\nBlanche called the transcripts \"critical pieces of an important moment in our nation's history,\" and said \"the time for the public to guess what they contain should end.\"\n\nHe said prosecutors would work to redact all victim-identifying information before making anything public.\n\nBAWDY LETTER\n\nThe Journal said the letter bearing Trump's name was part of a leather-bound birthday book for Epstein that included messages from other high-profile people. The newspaper said the letter contains several lines of typewritten text framed by the outline of a naked woman, which appeared to be hand-drawn with a heavy marker. The newspaper said the letter concludes \"Happy Birthday - and may every day be another wonderful secret,\" and featured the signature \"Donald.\"\n\nAllegations that Epstein had been sexually abusing girls became public in 2006 - after the birthday book was allegedly produced - and he was arrested that year before accepting a plea deal. Epstein died just over a month after he was arrested for a second time and charged with sex-trafficking conspiracy.\n\nTrump, who was photographed with Epstein multiple times in social situations in the 1990s and early 2000s, told reporters in 2019 that he ended his relationship with Epstein before his legal troubles became apparent.\n\nIn 2002, Trump, a Florida neighbor of Epstein's, was quoted in New York magazine as saying, \"I've known Jeff for 15 years. Terrific guy. He's a lot of fun to be with. It is even said that he likes beautiful women as much as I do, and many of them are on the younger side.\"\n\nSpeaking to reporters in the Oval Office in 2019, Trump said he and Epstein had a \"falling out\" before the financier was first arrested.\n\nTrump said he \"knew him like everybody in Palm Beach knew him\" but that, \"I had a falling out with him. I haven't spoken to him in 15 years. I was not a fan of his, that I can tell you.\"\n\nWHAT THE TRANSCRIPTS COULD SHOW\n\nThe release of the grand jury documents may fall short of what many of Trump's supporters have sought, including case files held by the administration.\n\nGrand juries review evidence from prosecutors to determine whether people should be indicted for crimes. This includes hearsay, improperly obtained information and other evidence that prosecutors would not be allowed to present at trial.\n\nTranscripts of grand jury proceedings are generally kept secret under federal criminal procedure rules, with limited exceptions.\n\nA judge may allow disclosure of grand jury matters in connection with judicial proceedings, or at the request of defendants who believe it could lead to the dismissal of their indictments.\n\nIt is likely that some material released from grand jury proceedings would be redacted, or blacked out, because of privacy or security concerns.\n\nReporting by Jonathan Stempel in New York, Nandita Bose, Trevor Hunnicutt and Jasper Ward in Washington, Jarrett Renshaw in Philadelphia, and Ismail Shakil in Ottawa; Writing by Daniel Trotta; Editing by Matthew Lewis, Diane Craft and Rosalba O'Brien\n\nPurchase Licensing Rights","summary":"Trump sues Wall Street Journal over Epstein report, seeks $10 billion  Reuters","url":"https://www.reuters.com/world/us/trump-sues-wall-street-journal-over-epstein-report-seeks-10-billion-2025-07-18/","image":"https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/DFD7LMVIMFPXXPD5MYMHHBX5BY.jpg?auth=52a891cc1cad9bca8624019dd3652f1ec4f812e2e109afb610faa7e7e5b2791a&height=1005&width=1920&quality=80&smart=true","video":"https://ajo.prod.reuters.tv/v3/playlist/697757/master.m3u8","publish_date":"2025-07-18 23:08:59","author":"Jonathan Stempel,Nandita Bose","authors":["Jonathan Stempel","Nandita Bose"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.158},{"id":343049452,"title":"Trump Files Lawsuit Against Wall Street Journal Over Report on Jeffrey Epstein Birthday Card","text":"Share this @internewscast.comFacebookXRedditPinterestIn federal court in South Florida, a docket shows that Trump is filing a lawsuit for libel, assault, and slander. The actual lawsuit document is not included with the docket.\n\nTrump has denied that he wrote the note.\n\nJeffrey Epstein and Donald Trump pictured together in the 1990s. Trump has since sought to distance himself from the convicted sex offender. (CNN)\n\nTrump had almost immediately threatened legal action after a story written by Journal reporters Khadeeja Safdar and Joe Palazzolo was released late Thursday afternoon. Both of these reporters are listed in the docket as defendants.\n\n“The Wall Street Journal and Rupert Murdoch were explicitly cautioned by President Donald J. Trump that their claim of a letter from President Trump to Epstein was a fraud. They were told that if they went ahead and published it, they would face a lawsuit,” President Trump declared in a Truth Social post.\n\nThe president added in that post that Murdoch, the owner of News Corp, the Journal’s parent company, “stated that he would take care of it.”\n\n“But, obviously, did not have the power to do so,” Trump added.\n\nCNN has reached out to the Wall Street Journal for comment.\n\nDonald Trump is under pressure over his long friendship with Jeffrey Epstein. (AP)\n\nThe president’s relationship with Epstein, the late convicted sex offender who died in a New York City jail in 2019 while awaiting trial on federal sex trafficking charges, has come under increased scrutiny in recent weeks.\n\nTrump said during his 2024 campaign that he would consider releasing additional files on Epstein, vowing to fulfill the demands of influential right-wing figures who have long pushed for increase governmental transparency around the case and publicly casted doubt on whether his death was a suicide, as was ruled by multiple official investigations.\n\nA memo released by his Justice Department earlier this month claimed there is no evidence that Epstein, who rubbed shoulders with some of the most influential men in politics and business during the late 20th century, maintained a “client list” that named or implicated these men in alleged sex crimes.\n\nThat revelation has disappointed some of the president’s most loyal followers and was the catalyst of a split that threatened to fracture his MAGA coalition.\n\nDonald Trump is suing a newspaper owned by Australian billionaire Rupert Murdoch.
