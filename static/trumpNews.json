The decision was published in the journal of Brazil’s lower house.\n\nSince his move to Texas in February, Eduardo Bolsonaro has missed more than 80% of this year’s lower house sessions, which violates its rules. The 41-year-old claims to be politically persecuted at home, and has lobbied members of the Trump administration to help his father reverse his conviction and put pressure on President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva.\n\n“As everybody knows, he is living abroad by his own decision,” Motta told journalists after his decision was announced. “He has not attended our house’s sessions and it is impossible to serve one’s term as a lawmaker if that person is not in our territory.”\n\nThe removal of Ramagem, who recently fled to the U.S. to avoid serving his 16-year jail sentence in the same case that put Bolsonaro behind bars in November, had been ordered by Brazil’s Supreme Court. Earlier this month, Motta, who has often sided with Bolsonaro allies, said he was going to put the decision to remove Ramagem from his seat to a full-house vote.\n\nIf Eduardo Bolsonaro returns to Brazil, he will face a trial on charges of obstructing justice in connection with his father’s attempted coup case. The former president’s son was accused of using violence or serious threats to interfere with a legal proceeding. If convicted, he could face one to four years in prison and a fine. \n\nNeither Eduardo Bolsonaro nor Alexandre Ramagem made comments about losing their seats.\n\nEduardo Bolsonaro has repeatedly said he influenced U.S. President Donald Trump’s decision in July to order a 50% tariff hike on Brazilian imported goods. Trump has said the move was due to Bolsonaro’s case, which he called a “witch hunt.” \n\nLater, when Trump and Lula started speaking, most of those higher tariffs on Brazil were revoked.\n\nFollow the AP’s coverage of Latin America and the Caribbean at https://apnews.com/hub/latin-america","url":"https://apnews.com/article/brazil-eduardo-bolsonaro-intelligence-agency-lower-house-56c3ee4871191850c925c12d185c5988","image":"https://dims.apnews.com/dims4/default/2a57e6c/2147483647/strip/false/crop/2921x1947+0+0/resize/1486x990!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fassets.apnews.com%2F05%2F38%2F33b30cf72c7c5b3b0b92a5dca14c%2Ff2929dad1a5b43d4becbbc0485eb98f8","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-18 23:48:20","author":"Mauricio Savarese","authors":["Mauricio Savarese"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.286},{"id":387347226,"title":"Trump's blockade of sanctioned Venezuelan oil raises questions","text":"WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump’s “blockade” of sanctioned oil tankers off Venezuela’s coast is raising new questions about the legality of his military campaign in Latin America, while fueling concerns that the U.S. could be edging closer to war. \n\nThe Trump administration says its blockade is narrowly tailored and not targeting civilians, which would be an illegal act of war. But some experts say seizing sanctioned oil tied to leader Nicolás Maduro could provoke a military response from Venezuela, engaging American forces in a new level of conflict that goes beyond their attacks on alleged drug boats.\n\n“My biggest fear is this is exactly how wars start and how conflicts escalate out of control,” said Rep. Jason Crow, a Colorado Democrat who fought in Iraq and Afghanistan. “And there are no adults in the room with this administration, nor is there consultation with Congress. So I’m very worried.” \n\nClaire Finkelstein, a professor of national security law at the University of Pennsylvania, said the use of such an aggressive tactic without congressional authority stretches the bounds of international law and increasingly looks like a veiled attempt to trigger a Venezuelan response.\n\n“The concern is that we are bootstrapping our way into armed conflict,” Finkelstein said. “We’re upping the ante in order to try to get them to engage in an act of aggression that would then justify an act of self-defense on our part.”\n\nRepublicans largely are OK with the campaign\n\nTrump has used the word “blockade” to describe his latest tactic in an escalating pressure campaign against Maduro, who has been charged with narcoterrorism in the U.S. and now has been accused of using oil profits to fund drug trafficking. While Trump said it only applies to vessels facing U.S. economic penalties, the move has sparked outrage among Democrats and mostly shrugs, if not cheers, from Republicans. \n\nRep. Michael McCaul, R-Texas, said Trump going after sanctioned oil tankers linked to Venezuela is no different from targeting Iranian oil.\n\n“Just like with the Iranian shadow tankers, I have no problem with that,” McCaul said. “They’re circumventing sanctions.”\n\nThe president has declared the U.S. is in “armed conflict” with drug cartels in an effort to reduce the flow of drugs to American communities. U.S. forces have attacked 26 alleged drug-smuggling boats and killed least 99 people since early September. Trump has repeatedly promised that land strikes are next, while linking Maduro to the cartels. \n\nThe campaign has drawn scrutiny in Congress, particularly after it was revealed that U.S. forces killed two survivors of a boat attack with a follow-up strike. But Republicans so far have repeatedly declined to require congressional authorization for further military action in the region, blocking Democrats’ war powers resolutions. \n\nSen. Roger Wicker, Republican chairman of the Senate Armed Service Committee, has essentially ended his panel’s investigation into the Sept. 2 strike, saying Thursday that the entire campaign is being conducted “on sound legal advice.”\n\nVenezuela pushes back\n\nTrump announced the blockade Tuesday, about a week after U.S. forces seized a sanctioned oil tanker off Venezuela’s coast. The South American country has the world’s largest proven oil reserves and relies heavily on the revenue to support its economy. \n\nThe U.S. has been imposing sanctions on Venezuela since 2005 over concerns about corruption as well as criminal and anti-democratic activities. The first Trump administration expanded the penalties to oil, prompting Maduro’s government to rely on a shadow fleet of falsely flagged tankers to smuggle crude into global supply chains. \n\nThe state-owned oil company Petróleos de Venezuela S.A., or PDVSA, has been largely locked out of global oil markets by U.S. sanctions. It sells most of its exports at a steep discount on the black market in China.\n\nNicolás Maduro Guerra, Maduro’s son and a lawmaker, on Thursday decried Trump’s latest tactic and vowed to work with the private sector to limit any impact on the country’s oil-dependent economy. He acknowledged that it won’t be an easy task.\n\n“We value peace and dialogue, but the reality right now is that we are being threatened by the most powerful army in the world, and that’s not something to be taken lightly,” Maduro Guerra said.\n\nPentagon prefers the term ‘quarantine’ \n\nIt wasn’t immediately clear how the U.S. planned to enact Trump’s order. But the Navy has 11 ships in the region and a wide complement of aircraft that can monitor marine traffic coming in and out of Venezuela.\n\nTrump may be using the term “blockade,” but the Pentagon says officials prefer “quarantine.”\n\nA defense official, who spoke on condition of anonymity to outline internal reasoning about the policy, said a blockade, under international law, constitutes an act of war requiring formal declaration and enforcement against all incoming and outgoing traffic. A quarantine, however, is a selective, preventive security measure that targets specific, illegal activity.\n\nRep. Adam Smith, the ranking Democrat on the House Armed Services Committee, said he was unsure of the legality of Trump’s blockade. \n\n“They’re blockading apparently the oil industry, not the entire country,” said Smith, who represents parts of western Washington state. “How does that change things? I got to talk to some lawyers, but in general, a blockade is an act of war.” \n\nThe U.S. has a long history of leveraging naval sieges to pressure lesser powers, especially in the 19th century era of “gunboat diplomacy,” sometimes provoking them into taking action that triggers an even greater American response.\n\nBut in recent decades, as the architecture of international law has developed, successive U.S. administrations have been careful not to use such maritime shows of force because they are seen as punishing civilians — an illegal act of aggression outside of wartime.\n\nDuring the 1962 Cuban missile crisis, President John F. Kennedy famously called his naval cordon to counter a real threat — weapons shipments from the Soviet Union — a “quarantine” not a blockade.\n\nMark Nevitt, an Emory University law professor and former Navy judge advocate general, said there is a legal basis for the U.S. to board and seize an already-sanctioned ship that is deemed to be stateless or is claiming two states.\n\nBut a blockade, he said, is a “wartime naval operation and maneuver” designed to block the access of vessels and aircraft of an enemy state.\n\n“I think the blockade is predicated on a false legal pretense that we are at war with narcoterrorists,” he said.\n\nNevitt added: “This seems to be almost like a junior varsity blockade, where they’re trying to assert a wartime legal tool, a blockade, but only doing it selectively.”\n\nGeoffrey Corn, a Texas Tech law professor who previously served as the Army’s senior adviser for law-of-war issues and has been critical of the Trump administration’s boat strikes, said he was not convinced the blockade was intended to ratchet up the conflict with Venezuela. \n\nInstead, he suggested it could be aimed at escalating the pressure on Maduro to give up power or encouraging his supporters to back away from him.\n\n“You can look at it through the lens of, is this an administration trying to create a pretext for a broader conflict?” Corn said. “Or you can look at it as part of an overall campaign of pressuring the Maduro regime to step aside.”\n\nGoodman reported from Miami.

It’s unclear how long it will take. \n\nSo far, electoral authorities had counted 99.80% of the ballots, but the election is marked by razor thin margins and accusations of a number of regularities, which have prompted the special count. \n\nAna Paola Hall, president of the National Electoral Council, said the count was being carried out in the “presence of national and international observers.”\n\nThe process had been paralyzed due to disputes over the final count, fueling wider political uncertainty and U.S. demands to wrap up vote tallies. On Wednesday night, the U.S. State Department warned Honduran electoral authorities to “immediately” finalize results and that any calls to disrupt the process would “be met with consequences.”\n\n“The voices of 3.4 million Hondurans must be respected and upheld,” the department said on X.\n\nThe country’s two leading candidates, both conservatives, are neck-and-neck, in a clear repudiation of the country’s ruling leftist President Xiomara Castro and her LIBRE, or Liberty and Re-foundation party.\n\nNasry Asfura, of the conservative National Party, leads with 40.54% of the vote, while Salvador Nasralla, of the also conservative Liberal Party, has 39.3%. \n\nRixi Moncada, who ran for the ruling progressive LIBRE, or Liberty and Re-foundation party, is in third place with 19.28% of the votes.\n\nU.S. President Donald Trump backed Asfura in the lead up to the election, fueling accusations of election intervention by his opponents, namely Castro. \n\nFor Castro, the election was a political reckoning — she was elected in 2021 on a promise to reduce violence and root out corruption in Honduras. Castro, is the wife of former President Manuel “Mel” Zelaya, who was removed from power in a 2009 coup. \n\nShe was among a group of progressive leaders in Latin American elected on a hopeful message of change, but are now being cast out after failing to deliver on their vision.\n\n“LIBRE paid the price of finally getting to the presidency, to the driving seat and not being able to deliver what it promised,” said Tiziano Breda, a senior analyst for Latin America and Caribbean at Armed Conflict Location & Event Data.\n\nIn addition to supporting Asfura, Trump also pardoned former Honduras President Juan Orlando Hernández, sentenced last year to 45 years in prison for his role in a drug trafficking operation by a U.S. court.\n\nLIBRE has previously called for the election results to be annulled because of Trump’s curveballs thrown in the midsts of its election, and analysts warned that the party may be slow-walking the vote counting process in a push to milk any political leverage it has left. But they added there’s little the ruling party can do because their loss was so definitive.\n\nOn Thursday, Castro announced in a speech that she would honor the results of the election.\n\n“Even in these difficult circumstances, I have been respectful of the law and the Constitution of the Republic, and to maintain peace in our country ... I will respect the winner,” Castro said.\n\nJanetsky reported from Mexico City.","url":"https://apnews.com/article/honduras-presidential-election-special-count-73f142db3a87a85494bf70887e0ecb24","image":"https://dims.apnews.com/dims4/default/18be15a/2147483647/strip/false/crop/8640x5760+0+0/resize/1486x991!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fassets.apnews.com%2Fee%2F42%2F0932fa6cbe1c42a51b13879065dd%2F7299dd85575049769fb8208788ad738a","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-18 23:28:15","author":"Marlon González,Megan Janetsky","authors":["Marlon González","Megan Janetsky"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.05},{"id":387347792,"title":"Maine businesses criticize  new work permit limits for asylum seekers","text":"Maine business leaders and immigrant advocates say new restrictions on work permits for asylum seekers will hurt companies, consumers and other workers across a state that relies on new Mainers to fill jobs amid a chronic labor shortage.\n\nThe Trump administration this month reduced the valid period for work permits issued to asylum seekers and other migrants from five years to just 18 months — a move that’s expected to increase a yearslong backlog of applications to U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services.\n\nCritics say this policy change and others will make it nearly impossible for some companies to stay fully staffed, especially in Maine’s seasonal, food production, agricultural and health care sectors.\n\nBen Conniff, co-founder of Luke’s Lobster, a lobster processing, specialty food production and restaurant company, urged the administration to “walk back” the changes.\n\n“People might think that they’re proposing or inputting new rules that just target folks from immigrant populations — they are not,” Conniff said Thursday during an online media briefing that included the Maine State Chamber of Commerce in Augusta.\n\n“They will harm business, create unnecessary red tape and harm communities up and down the supply chain,” Conniff said, “all the way from the original harvester to the end consumer, who either can’t get food on the shelves in the supermarket or will pay vastly more for it.”\n\nConniff said about 70% of Maine’s lobster harvest is processed at production facilities that depend on workers from immigrant communities. Requiring employed asylum seekers to reapply for work permits every 18 months would create an immense administrative burden for employers, increase an already significant backlog in permit applications and leave companies without enough workers to operate, he said.\n\n“When you cannot staff roles in these production facilities, you cannot produce seafood,” Conniff said. “You will see people in seafood production facilities and all sorts of other production facilities close their doors.”\n\nREACTION TO RECENT SHOOTING\n\nThe Trump administration imposed a variety of restrictions on asylum seekers, green card applicants and other immigrants following the Nov. 26 shooting in Washington, D.C., that killed one National Guard member and critically wounded another.\n\nThe alleged gunman is an Afghan national who worked with a CIA-organized counterterrorism group before coming to the U.S. in 2021. He was granted asylum in April.\n\nUSCIS Director Joseph Edlow said the attack showed that his agency “must conduct more frequent vetting of aliens.”\n\nNow, work permits issued or renewed after Dec. 4 are valid for 18 months instead of five years. The shortened timeline applies to asylum seekers, refugees and other migrants with humanitarian protections.\n\nUSCIS also halted all asylum decisions and paused all immigration applications from 19 nations it has deemed high risk: Afghanistan, Myanmar (also known as Burma), Chad, Republic of Congo, Equatorial Guinea, Eritrea, Haiti, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Yemen, Burundi, Cuba, Laos, Sierra Leone, Togo, Turkmenistan and Venezuela.\n\nBusiness leaders say these restrictions will impact hundreds of thousands of migrants and particularly hurt industries such as construction, transportation and food services.\n\nPatrick Woodcock, president and CEO of the Maine State Chamber, said asylum seekers are a critical resource in a state with a labor shortage and no sign of employment growth through 2029.\n\nThe loss of those workers will be especially difficult for Maine communities where asylum seekers make up a significant portion of the workforce, he said.\n\n“Ultimately, we need a regulatory framework that makes it easy for our current workforce to continue to participate in our economy,” Woodcock said. “This workforce is working for Maine. It’s working for the United States. We need to ensure that we don’t have unnecessary lapses (in work permits) that are held up in red tape.”\n\nASYLUM SEEKERS AT WORK\n\nThere are at least 3 million asylum seekers in the U.S., including children, and roughly 1.4 million are working, according to fwd.us, an immigration advocacy group.\n\nMaine had about 10,000 foreign-born residents in 2023 who were asylum seekers, humanitarian parolees or had another protected status, according to an October report from the Migration Policy Institute, a nonpartisan immigration policy think tank.\n\nMichael Gagné has hired many asylum seekers, and he openly admits he’s no fan of President Donald Trump or his immigration policy changes. He owns Gagné Foods, a Bath pastry company where about 70% of his 50 employees are asylum seekers and other immigrants.\n\n“I find all of these things are anti-American and run counter to the founding principles of our country,” Gagné said in an interview. “Once you scrape away the racist, anti-immigrant rhetoric and the pretense of a problem, you’re left with the vilification of a whole class of people for the purpose of political gain and the satisfaction of his base.”\n\nGagné said making his company a welcoming space for immigrants solved a 15-year struggle to fill jobs amid a chronic labor shortage. He helped to establish public bus route between Bath and Lewiston, where many of his workers live. He also provides interpreter services, pays $18 to $28 an hour and just doled out Christmas bonuses. \n\n“I have a fairly stable and consistent work force because of asylum seekers and other immigrants,” Gagné said. “I just hired three more.”\n\nGagné said he audits his employees’ work permits every two weeks to make sure they’re up to date in case immigration officials show up.\n\nBut in his mind and in this job market, he said, asylum seekers and other immigrants “should be allowed to work and fast-tracked to citizenship.”\n\nMOUNTING IMMIGRATION RESTRICTIONS\n\nThursday’s media briefing was hosted by WorkPermits.US, which is a project of ASAP (Asylum Seekers Advocacy Project), a nonprofit made up of asylum seekers and advocates that helps them through and lobbies for changes in the asylum process.\n\nConchita Cruz, ASAP’s co-executive director, said shorter validity periods for work permits could create longer processing backlogs, “making it more and more likely asylum seekers will fall out of the workforce and not be able to support themselves and their families,” the Washington Post reported.\n\nThese are only the latest restrictions to the asylum program, which was established for migrants fleeing persecution in their home countries based on race, religion or other factors. Earlier this year, U.S. Customs and Border Protection was authorized to deport most migrants seeking asylum at the U.S.-Mexico border, which has been legally challenged and is expected to go before the U.S. Supreme Court.\n\nThe administration also has raised fees for asylum applications and related work permits, including a new $550 fee to apply for an initial work permit, which had been free, according to ASAP.\n\nMany asylum seekers who entered the country via the U.S.-Mexico border under President Joe Biden have obtained work permits while waiting for their asylum claim to be processed, which can take several years.\n\nLisa Parisio, policy director of the Immigrant Legal Advocacy Project in Portland, said the administration’s changes further extend an already protracted asylum review process and add unnecessary complications and costs for everyone involved.\n\n“These changes to work permit validity periods are very clear examples of the administration’s massively cruel, chaotic and baseless moves on immigration,” Parisio said. “Ultimately, they impact and harm all of us.”","summary":"Business leaders say restrictions imposed by the Trump administration will make it nearly impossible for some companies to stay fully staffed, especially in Maine's seasonal, food production and agricultural sectors.","url":"https://www.centralmaine.com/2025/12/18/maine-businesses-criticize-new-work-permit-limits-for-asylum-seekers/","image":"https://www.centralmaine.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/12/39099983_20240723_Gagne_11.jpg?w=780","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-18 23:18:37","author":"Kelley Bouchard","authors":["Kelley Bouchard"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.468},{"id":387347246,"title":"TikTok signs agreements with investors to form new US venture","text":"SAN FRANCISCO (AP) — TikTok has signed agreements with three major investors — Oracle, Silver Lake and MGX — to form a new TikTok U.S. joint venture, ensuring the popular social video platform can continue operating in the United States.\n\nThe deal is expected to close on Jan. 22, according to an internal memo seen by The Associated Press. In the communication, CEO Shou Zi Chew confirmed to employees that ByteDance and TikTok signed the binding agreements with the consortium.\n\n“I want to take this opportunity to thank you for your continued dedication and tireless work. Your efforts keep us operating at the highest level and will ensure that TikTok continues to grow and thrive in the U.S. and around the world,” Chew wrote in the memo to employees. “With these agreements in place, our focus must stay where it’s always been—firmly on delivering for our users, creators, businesses and the global TikTok community.”\n\nHalf of the new TikTok U.S. joint venture will be owned by a group of investors — among them Oracle, Silver Lake and the Emirati investment firm MGX, who will each hold a 15% share. 19.9% of the new app will be held by ByteDance itself, and another 30.1% will be held by affiliates of existing ByteDance investors, according to the memo. The memo did not say who the other investors are and both TikTok and the White House declined to comment. \n\nThe U.S. venture will have a new, seven-member majority-American board of directors, the memo said. It will also be subject to terms that “protect Americans’ data and U.S. national security.” \n\nU.S. user data will be stored locally in a system run by Oracle. \n\nTikTok’s algorithm — the secret sauce that powers its addictive video feed — will be retrained on U.S. user data to “ensure the content feed is free from outside manipulation,” the memo said. The U.S. venture will also oversee content moderation and policies within the country.\n\nAmerican officials have previously warned that ByteDance’s algorithm is vulnerable to manipulation by Chinese authorities, who can use it to shape content on the platform in a way that’s difficult to detect.\n\nThe algorithm has been a central issue in the security debate over TikTok. China previously maintained the algorithm must remain under Chinese control by law. But the U.S. regulation passed with bipartisan support said any divestment of TikTok must mean the platform cuts ties — specifically the algorithm — with ByteDance.\n\nThe deal marks the end of years of uncertainty about the fate of the popular video-sharing platform in the United States. After wide bipartisan majorities in Congress passed — and President Joe Biden signed — a law that would ban TikTok in the U.S. if it did not find a new owner in the place of China’s ByteDance, the platform was set to go dark on the law’s January 2025 deadline. For a several hours, it did. But on his first day in office, President Donald Trump signed an executive order to keep it running while his administration tries to reach an agreement for the sale of the company.\n\nThree more executive orders followed, as Trump, without a clear legal basis, continued to extend the deadline for a TikTok deal. The second was in April, when White House officials believed they were nearing a deal to spin off TikTok into a new company with U.S. ownership that fell apart after China backed out following Trump’s tariff announcement. The third came in June, then another in September, which Trump said would allow TikTok to continue operating in the United States in a way that meets national security concerns.\n\nTikTok has more than 170 million users in the U.S. About 43% of U.S. adults under the age of 30 say they regularly get news from TikTok, higher than any other social media app including YouTube, Facebook and Instagram, according to a Pew Research Center report published this fall.","url":"https://apnews.com/article/tiktok-divestment-deal-trump-2fdb915cac5b6d06907a5a2de6764376","image":"https://dims.apnews.com/dims4/default/a7b7c7a/2147483647/strip/false/crop/4593x3153+0+0/resize/1486x1020!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fassets.apnews.com%2Fff%2F81%2Fb62ce5a3c15f2efbf591386e97e9%2F47f858632b5047f1b617d115e35c15f6","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-18 22:51:33","author":"Barbara Ortutay","authors":["Barbara Ortutay"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.081},{"id":387347816,"title":"Donald Trump backs former Maine Gov.

Incumbent Democrat Jared Golden announced in November that he would not seek reelection.\n\nBoth Trump and Johnson endorsed Austin Theriault, a state representative and former NASCAR driver, in his bid to unseat Golden last year. Theriault closely aligned himself with Trump, but the strategy didn’t pay off, and Golden won another close election.\n\nLePage has been lavishing praise on Trump since entering the race. On Thursday, LePage welcomed Trump’s endorsement in a statement of his own.\n\n“”I look forward to working with President Trump in growing our economy, increasing jobs and wages, fighting high prices and protecting our citizens from crime with the removal of criminal illegal aliens,” LePage said.\n\nHis handling of Trump is starkly different from LePage’s 2022 bid to unseat Janet Mills as governor, when he deflected questions and sought to distance himself from the former president. At the time, Trump was under federal investigations for allegedly tampering with the 2020 elections and helping to incite the 2021 riot at the Capitol.\n\nAs governor, LePage racked up a $22,000 bill on the state dime to pay for stays at the Trump International Hotel in Washington, D.C. LePage’s trips coincided with efforts to land a job in the administration when his term ended in 2018. Trump no longer owns the hotel.\n\nLePage, who grew up in Lewiston, has a built-in advantage in the Republican-leaning district, which has voted for Trump in all three of his presidential elections. The former governor won a majority there against Mills in 2022.\n\nThere is no clear Democratic successor to Golden.\n\nState Auditor and former Secretary of State Matthew Dunlap of Old Town announced a primary challenge before Golden dropped out. And Jordan Wood, a Lewiston native who lives in Bristol, ended his U.S. Senate campaign to run for the congressional seat.\n\nTrump predicted that Dunlap would win the primary, calling him “a Radical Left Democrat,” even though he recently had to explain an anti-abortion vote he took years ago as a state lawmaker. Dunlap is also a former board member and director of the Sportsman’s Alliance of Maine, which pushes pro-gun policies at the State House.","summary":"Trump said in a social media post that the two-term governor who once described himself as 'Donald Trump Before Donald Trump' would be a 'tremendous Congressman.'","url":"https://www.centralmaine.com/2025/12/18/donald-trump-backs-former-maine-gov-paul-lepage-for-u-s-congress/","image":"https://www.centralmaine.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/09/Trump-and-LePage-1663452756.jpg?w=780","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-18 22:39:19","author":"Randy Billings","authors":["Randy Billings"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.022},{"id":387347410,"title":"What to know about Trump's executive order on marijuana","text":"President Donald Trump has directed his administration to work as quickly as possible to reclassify marijuana as a less dangerous drug.\n\nTrump’s executive order on Thursday does not legalize marijuana under federal law.

That would not change. \n\nRather, Trump is proposing to reclassify marijuana from a Schedule I drug, alongside heroin and LSD, to a less dangerous Schedule III substance, which includes such things as ketamine and some anabolic steroids. \n\nThe federal government defines a Schedule I drug as having no accepted medical use and a high potential for abuse. Schedule III drugs are defined as having moderate to low potential for physical and psychological dependence.\n\nThe U.S. Justice Department had proposed to reclassify marijuana under President Joe Biden, eliciting nearly 43,000 formal public comments. The Drug Enforcement Administration was still in the review process when Trump succeeded Biden in January, triggering a re-examination of the policy.\n\nWhat did Trump say?\n\nTrump said he has long taken a just-say-no approach to drugs.\n\n“I’ve always told my children, ‘Don’t take drugs, no drinking, no smoking,’” Trump said at a White House event Thursday.\n\nBut he added: “At the same time, the facts compel the federal government to recognize that marijuana can be legitimate in terms of medical applications when carefully administered.”\n\nTrump said he has been swamped with calls urging him to make marijuana more accessible for people struggling with health problems such as severe pain. \n\n“This reclassification order will make it far easier to conduct marijuana-related medical research, allowing us to study benefits, potential dangers and future treatments,” Trump said.\n\nHis executive order directs the attorney general to “take all necessary steps” to complete the rule-making process to reclassify marijuana as a Schedule III drug “in the most expeditious manner” allowed under federal law. \n\nWhat would reclassification mean for cannabis shops? \n\nFederal income tax deductions for business expenses aren’t available to enterprises involved in “trafficking” any Schedule I or II drug. \n\nChanging marijuana to a Schedule III drug could save hundreds of millions of dollars in taxes for businesses licensed to sell marijuana in states where it is legal, said Rachel Gillette, a Denver attorney at Holland & Hart who leads the firm’s cannabis industry practice. \n\nReclassification could allow marijuana businesses to claim tax deductions for expenses such as advertising, marketing, rent or labor costs associated with sales, she said. \n\nThough some marijuana advocates would prefer it to be fully legalized, “I think the industry is willing to take whatever incremental steps they can in order to put themselves in a better financial position,” Gillette said. \n\nOpponents of the change say that’s cause for concern. \n\n“My worry is that we will supersize the commercialization of this industry, which is going to lead to more people using and more damage,” said Kevin Sabet, a former drug policy adviser under President Barack Obama who now is CEO of the group Smart Approaches to Marijuana.\n\nHow does the public view marijuana?\n\nSupport for marijuana legalization has grown significantly over the past several decades, from just 23% support in 1985 to 64% this year, according to polling from Gallup. \n\nBut that’s down from 70% support just two years ago, primarily because of declining enthusiasm among Republicans. \n\nSupport among Republicans for legalizing marijuana dropped from 55% to 40% since 2023, Gallup said. By comparison, support shifted only slightly among Democrats, from 87% to 85% during that same period, and inched down from 69% to 66% among independents. \n\nMore than 20 Republican U.S. senators, several of them staunch Trump allies, had signed a letter this year urging the president to keep marijuana a Schedule I drug. They asserted that marijuana remains dangerous and argued that reclassifying it would “undermine your strong efforts to Make America Great Again.”\n\nHow has marijuana use changed?\n\nThe medical use of marijuana already is allowed in 40 states and Washington, D.C. Over the past dozen years, the number of jurisdictions legalizing recreational marijuana for adults rose rapidly to 24 states and Washington, D.C.\n\nAs more states have embraced marijuana, more people have used it.\n\nMore than 64 million Americans age 12 and older — 22% of people — used marijuana during the previous year, according to a 2024 national survey released earlier this year by the federal Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration. That was up from 19% of people in 2021. \n\nReclassifying marijuana could cause that figure to keep growing.\n\n“The biggest impact would be further normalizing marijuana use, especially among our young people,” Sabet said.","url":"https://apnews.com/article/trump-reclassify-marijuana-cannibas-legal-marijuana-federal-ab2aec5865dd140bac00b7cef5de89c5","image":"https://dims.apnews.com/dims4/default/fbe0804/2147483647/strip/false/crop/4032x2688+0+0/resize/1486x991!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fassets.apnews.com%2F1e%2F9e%2F4bb48c5282933107a5cab24f09e4%2F8818cb0c336d45788a5e9ee8d3dc822d","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-18 22:37:06","author":"David A.

If you wonder whether they are petty, but also deeply strange and erratically capitalized, the answer is: Yes! Of course!\n\nSurely they cannot really be that bad, you say. All right. See if you can guess the real ones! Then scroll to the bottom for the answer key. \n\n25. Joseph Biden: Nicknamed both “Sleepy” and “Crooked,” Joe Biden was dominated by his Radical Left handlers. They and their allies in the Fake News Media attempted to cover up his severe mental decline, and his unprecedented use of the Autopen.\n\n24. Barack Obama: Barack Hussein Obama was the first Black President, a community organizer, one term Senator from Illinois, and one of the most divisive political figures in American History. As President, he passed the highly ineffective “Unaffordable” Care Act, resulting in his party losing control of both Houses of Congress, and the Election of the largest House Republican majority since 1946.\n\n23. George W. Bush: President Bush created the Department of Homeland Security, but started wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, both of which should not have happened.\n\n22. John F. Kennedy: Kennedy suffered a painful setback during the failed Bay of Pigs Invasion, and was President when the Soviet Union built the Berlin Wall, but skillfully navigated the threat of nuclear war during the Cuban Missile Crisis.\n\n21. Harry S. Truman: Harry S. Truman dropped the nuclear bombs. The Fat Man and the Little Boy. Boy, was that a mistake! If Donald Trump dropped a bomb he would make certain it was an elegant, slim bomb. He would also come up with a different name for the plane.\n\n20. Herbert Hoover: A self-made man who rose from humble beginnings, Herbert Hoover was a successful mining engineer who became known as the “Great Humanitarian.”\n\n19. Warren G. Harding: Right out of central casting, this guy! Groundbreaking in many ways. Those letters he sent to his mistress. Hot to trot, this guy! Jerry. We’re not allowed to talk about Jerry nowadays. The Ohio Gang. Teapot Dome. Teapot Dome, what happened to Teapot Dome? You never see any Teapot Domes anymore. Warren “Gamaliel” Harding. What a name! Gamaliel, Gamaliel, like some elf from Lord of the Rings. But he was a president, not an elf! Maybe better to be an elf. Then he could have gone into the West instead of dying in office. Better luck next time, Gamaliel.\n\n18. Woodrow Wilson: On the one hand, he did the League of Nations, but on the other hand, he used to show Birth of a Nation in the White House and he segregated the federal government. This just goes to show there are good and bad sides to everyone. Thank goodness we never got into the League of Nations.\n\n17. Theodore Roosevelt: Speak softly and carry a big stick was Theodore Roosevelt’s idea of a good foreign policy, which is only “good” if you have a weak voice and want your arm to get really tired. Can you imagine? You sit down with Vladimir Putin and he says, Who is that guy in the corner whispering with the stick? I guess it was a different time. Yet they gave him the Nobel Peace Prize?\n\n16. William McKinley: What do you say about William McKinley?\n\n15. Grover Cleveland: We love Grover Cleveland! He was president once and then he came back, which Donald Trump would also do, but better. He married his ward. Donald Trump hasn’t done that yet. But that ward wasn’t the only love of his life. “Ma, ma, where is my pa? Gone to the White House, ha ha ha!” That’s what they sang. Gone to the White House! They didn’t care about the illegitimate child. “Ha ha ha!” We need a song like that. America doesn’t make songs like that anymore.\n\n14. James Garfield: Some say Charles Guiteau assassinated him, but actually the doctors killed him. Not Charlie, sad to say! It wasn’t Charles Guiteau who did it. Guiteau, Git-Out, that’s what they called him at the Oneida Free Love Colony. He wanted some of that free love but his energy was just bad. And Garfield paid the price!\n\n13. Rutherford B. Hayes: Boy, they had a lot of these guys with beards! Even the voters took one look at this little guy and said, Nah, we want to go with Samuel Tilden. Poor Sammy Tilden. Didn’t have what it took. He won the popular vote, but they gave the election to Hayes in the so-called Corrupt Bargain of 1876! At least they ended Reconstruction, which, frankly, never should have happened. But they didn’t get rid of the Fourteenth Amendment. Donald Trump has to do it himself.\n\n12. Ulysses S. Grant: He beat the late, great Robert E. Lee. “Never fight uphill, me boys!” Was it fair and square? Hard to know. But they put him on the money. Not such a good president. He didn’t have great people around him. Sad. \n\n11. Andrew Johnson: Some say he was drunk at inauguration. Maybe he was, maybe he wasn’t. Did you know they impeached him? Crooked Thaddeus Stevens and his Radical Republican cronies! They didn’t like old Andy J. They never like the Andrews. Jackson, Johnson, they’re not big fans. Issued a lot of great pardons, though. They said, Don’t do the pardons, Mr. Johnson. These men are traitors! They fought against the Union! They were begging him, Don’t do the pardons. But he did the pardons anyway. Good!\n\n10. Abraham Lincoln: Lincoln succeeded for numerous reasons. He was a man who was of great intelligence, but he was also a man that did something that was a very vital thing to do at that time. Ten years before or 20 years before, what he was doing would never have even been thought possible. So he did something that was a very important thing to do, and especially at that time.\n\n9. James Buchanan: Donald Trump has a little bit of affection for James Buchanan because as long as Buchanan is on the list of presidents, they can never put Trump last. Instead it’s little Jimmy B., or as Andrew Jackson called him, “Miss Nancy.” Not so nice of Andrew Jackson! \n\n8. Franklin Pierce: Franklin Pierce! “We Polked You in ’44, We Shall Pierce You in ’52!” They don’t make slogans like that anymore, because of Woke. \n\n7. Zachary Taylor: They called him a war hero but he got defeated by cherries. By cherries and a little bit of milk. Mexican War couldn’t do it, but a little tiny fruit, that got him. George Washington defeated the cherry, but Zachary Taylor, not so much. So-called general who was weaker than fruit.\n\n6. William Henry Harrison: Gave such a long inaugural address that he died! Donald J. Trump gave a much longer address and did not die. Tippecanoe didn’t have what it takes! “Tippecanoe and Tyler Too,” that’s a slogan for you. You feel a little bad for Tyler, the way they tacked him on there at the end.\n\n5. Andrew Jackson: “Old Hickory” served as a U. S. Congressman, Judge, General, Senator, and Military Governor. Before becoming President, Jackson was best known for leading the victory at the Battle of New Orleans during the War of 1812. Jackson was often called “The People’s President” for championing the common man, but was unjustifiably treated unfairly by the Press, but not as viciously and unfairly as President Abraham Lincoln and President Donald J. Trump would, in the future, be.\n\n4. James Monroe: Tall guy, but weird-looking. They say he ushered in the “Era of Good Feelings,” actually very BAD feelings for the Federalists! We love the Monroe Doctrine, though. And his wife was very good in Some Like It Hot.\n\n3. James Madison: Presided over a little demolition at the White House but not on purpose. The British paid for it. Liddle Jemmy!\n\n2. Thomas Jefferson: The Declaration of Independence, very overrated! Very overrated document. “Transported beyond seas for pretended offenses”? Sometimes you have to transport people beyond seas for pretended offenses. “Quartering troops”? Sometimes it’s nice to quarter a little troop. He didn’t get it.\n\n1. George Washington: We like that he put his name on all the things: the monument, the city, even a state. Now if you put your name on the things, they say it’s tacky, but with him, not so much! The name wasn’t enough; he’s also on a bill and a coin. Two different forms of legal tender. Not the penny, fortunately, which is trash.\n\nReal: 5, 20, 22, 23, 24, 25\n\nFake: 1–4, 6–19, 21\n\n(No. 10 is a real quote from the president, but not on the plaque as far as I know.)","url":"https://www.theatlantic.com/newsletters/2025/12/presidential-walk-of-fame-plaque-quiz/685323/","image":"https://cdn.theatlantic.com/thumbor/Z1VZSeRDvCA8nsmr6_tWd2wsD8s=/0x0:2000x1125/720x405/media/img/mt/2025/12/2025_12_18_Plaques_mpg/original.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-18 22:03:00","author":"Alexandra Petri","authors":["Alexandra Petri"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.164},{"id":387347240,"title":"The top photos of the week by AP’s photojournalists","text":"President Donald Trump, from left, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs Air Force Gen.

(AP) — A federal judge on Thursday denied a request for a preliminary injunction to close an immigration detention center in the Florida Everglades dubbed “Alligator Alcatraz,” saying a detainee who asked for the order hadn’t shown he was suffering irreparable harm at the facility.\n\nU.S. District Judge Kyle Dudek said the detainee, known as M.A. in court papers, hadn’t met the high burden required for a preliminary injunction while his challenge to the facility is litigated in federal court in Fort Myers, Florida.\n\n“While there may indeed be deficiencies at Alligator Alcatraz that ultimately justify its dissolution, plaintiff has not made the extraordinary showing needed to justify immediate relief of such magnitude,” said Dudek, who was nominated by President Donald Trump.\n\nM.A.'s lawsuit is one of three federal lawsuits challenging practices at the immigration detention center that was built this summer at a remote airstrip in the Florida Everglades by the administration of Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis. \n\nHis lawsuit claims immigration is a federal issue, and Florida agencies and private contractors hired by the state have no authority to operate the facility under federal law. Detainees who enter the facility disappear from the normal detainee tracking system and have difficulty accessing legal help, the lawsuit said.\n\n“The statute requires federal control over all delegated enforcement activities. Yet Florida asserts that it has total control over detention decisions,” M.A. said in his request for a preliminary injunction.\n\nThe judge said he was proceeding with caution in denying the request since “plaintiff is essentially asking this court to close a sizable and expensive detention facility, all before any decision on the merits of its legality.” \n\nIn a separate case, a federal judge in Miami last summer ordered the facility to wind down operations over two months because officials had failed to do a review of the detention center’s environmental impact. But an appellate court panel put that decision on hold for the time being, allowing the facility to stay open. \n\nIn the third lawsuit, detainees were seeking a ruling that would ensure that they have access to confidential communications with their attorneys. They claimed that detainees’ attorneys had to make an appointment to visit three days in advance, unlike at other detention facilities where the lawyers can just show up during visiting hours; that detainees often were transferred to other facilities after their attorneys had made an appointment to see them; and that scheduling delays had been so lengthy that detainees were unable to meet with attorneys before key deadlines.\n\nA federal judge in that case ordered the detainees’ lawyers and attorneys for the state and federal government defendants to meet Tuesday in an effort to resolve the case. But they notified the court on Wednesday they were unable to reach a resolution despite nine hours of talks.\n\nFollow Mike Schneider on the social platform Bluesky: @mikeysid.bsky.social","url":"https://apnews.com/article/florida-immigration-alligator-alcatraz-desantis-ac9664190a4b25afbb9f3926b84411dc","image":"https://dims.apnews.com/dims4/default/adb2f11/2147483647/strip/false/crop/5382x3588+0+0/resize/1486x991!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fassets.apnews.com%2F3d%2F9a%2F05ff4fdf9e87039dd1807790c62d%2Fb6b56138f8f649309a8aca005955e715","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-18 21:48:43","author":"Mike Schneider","authors":["Mike Schneider"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.497},{"id":387347224,"title":"Democrat Eileen Higgins sworn in as Miami's first female mayor","text":"MIAMI (AP) — Democrat Eileen Higgins was sworn in Thursday as Miami’s first female mayor, two weeks after defeating a Republican endorsed by President Donald Trump.\n\nHiggins also becomes the first Democrat in almost 30 years to lead the city of 487,000 people.

Trump’s executive order would speed up the Drug Enforcement Administration’s process that would shift the drug’s current classification as a Schedule I drug, alongside heroin and LSD. Cannabis would instead be a Schedule III substance, like ketamine and some anabolic steroids.\n\nThe move could spark momentum for an industry that has been struggling under a hodgepodge of state regulations and the constant threat of harsh enforcement of federal laws.\n\nTilray Brands slipped 4.2% to $12.33 following the executive order. The stock is well below its price of $17 when it went public in 2008.

One real estate expert wagered that the parcel — one of the last undeveloped lots on a palm tree-lined stretch of Biscayne Boulevard — could sell for hundreds of millions of dollars more.\n\nCircuit Judge Mavel Ruiz had initially sided with Marvin Dunn, the retired professor and chronicler of local Black history who filed the case. In October, Ruiz temporarily blocked the college from formally transferring the land while the challenge played out, setting a trial for next August.\n\nBut on Thursday, Ruiz ruled in favor of the college, dismissing Dunn’s complaint without prejudice after the board redid the vote on the land giveaway earlier this month at a more than four-hour-long public meeting that included fiery testimony on the issue.\n\nRuiz said her decision was not political but solely based on the narrow facts of the case and the confines of the open government law.\n\n“This court is not deciding whether this is wise, whether the transaction is appropriate for one president or another, or for a library, or for a petting zoo. That is not what the court is here to decide,” Ruiz said. \n\nAttorneys for the college maintain that the board did not violate state law, but argued that any alleged violation had been “fully cured” following the redo vote.\n\n“The board has redone the vote just as plaintiff asked, and has considered this anew, truly deliberated on it and has again conveyed the land to the state,” said Jennifer Hernandez, an attorney for the college.\n\nThough Ruiz dismissed Dunn’s complaint, the judge acknowledged his decision to leverage his home to pay a court-ordered bond as part of the terms of her order temporarily blocking the land transfer.\n\nRuiz described Dunn as someone “willing to put themselves, their money and their home on the line for the better good,” adding, “and I thank you.”\n\nAfter the college first voted in September to transfer the property to a fund controlled by Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis and the Florida Cabinet, the GOP officials voted to transfer the land again, effectively putting the property under the control of the Trump family when they deeded it to the foundation for Trump’s library. That foundation is led by three trustees: Eric Trump; Tiffany Trump’s husband, Michael Boulos; and the president’s attorney, James Kiley.\n\nEric Trump has pledged the future library will be “one of the most beautiful buildings ever built” and “an Icon on the Miami skyline.” Under local zoning rules, the best use of the property would be a towering condo building, according to one Miami real estate expert, who described the site as a potential “cash cow.”\n\nKate Payne is a corps member for The Associated Press/Report for America Statehouse News Initiative.

Sergio Aguiar, Alice's father, expressed his gratitude: \"Thank you everyone for the award it means a lot to me, my wife, and my princess Alice. I want to dedicate this award to our three girls: Alice, Elsie and Bebe. Keep dancing.\" He added, \"I want to spread Alice's magic across the world. I'm going to keep running and raising money for her foundation.\" Elsie's father, Stancombe, shared: \"I'm very grateful to accept the award tonight, but I'm just a dad who's keeping his promise to his little girl. Elsie wanted me to run the London Marathon and I did. It gave me a massive focus during the hardest times I've ever lived through.\" He continued, \"It also gave me an opportunity to demonstrate a fraction of the bravery and determination Elsie showed. I'd just like to thank everyone who made it possible. My wife Jenny, too. She runs a marathon every day. I couldn't do it without her.\" McIlroy is in contention for the main prize of Sports Personality of the Year, following an extraordinary year on the golf circuit. He finally brought an 11-year wait for the Grand Slam to a close, overcoming Justin Rose in a nail-biting finale to claim the Masters. When asked how fatherhood has altered his perspective on this year's accomplishments, McIlroy struggled to contain his emotions, stating: \"I think being a father of a little girl, seeing the dads up there tonight, they are absolute heroes.\" After gathering himself, he continued: \"Being a dad, it makes the losses a lot easier. It makes the wins even more special to be able to share that with Erica [wife] and Poppy [daughter]. \"My family, they've watched me go through all of this like I'm sure a lot of the public has. I feel like everyone's been on this journey with me.\" He becomes only the sixth golfer in the modern era to secure a career Grand Slam, entering an exclusive group featuring Gene Sarazen, Ben Hogan, Gary Player, Jack Nicklaus and Tiger Woods. The 36-year-old also delivered dominant displays during Europe's Ryder Cup victory, withstanding a barrage of hostile comments from the crowd. Luke Donald's team overcame the hosts in a rare away success, with their united squad defeating a talent-packed USA team whilst US president Donald Trump looked on - alongside millions of television viewers. He also clinched titles at the Players Championship, the AT&T Pebble Beach Pro-Am and the Irish Open, before capping off an extraordinary year with his seventh Race to Dubai title.","summary":"Rory McIlroy struggled to hold back tears during the BBC Sports Personality of the Year awards after being asked about being a father to daughter Poppy","url":"https://www.dailystar.co.uk/sport/rory-mcilroy-tears-spoty-interview-36425642","image":"https://i2-prod.dailystar.co.uk/article36425640.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200b/0_Rory-McIlroy.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-18 20:30:42","author":"Cameron Winstanley,Matty Hewitt","authors":["Cameron Winstanley","Matty Hewitt"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":0.409},{"id":387345432,"title":"Person of interest sought in Brown shooting; link to MIT killing probed","text":"PROVIDENCE, RI - Law enforcement is pursuing a new person of interest in Brown University shooting that killed two, injured nine and sparked a manhunt for a man caught on video casing the area moments before the assault in an engineering building, according to multiple media outlets.\n\nAdding to the revelations of the case are that authorities on Dec. 16 were also probing a possible connection between the Brown killings and the shooting death of a Massachusetts Institute of Technology professor. That's according to reporting from The Providence Journal, part of the USA TODAY Network, citing law enforcement sources with knowledge of the investigation but who asked to remain anonymous.\n\nCBS News, the New York Times and the Associated Press, citing unnamed sources, reported that a person of interest has been identified by New England law enforcement and is being sought.\n\nFive days after the perpetrator of a mass shooting at Brown University escaped amid chaos, law enforcement officials and experts said the investigation is progressing and the escaped killer will have a hard time evading justice.\n\nJust a day earlier, officials said they faced a difficult investigation and had little information about the shooter.\n\n\"He could be anywhere,\" Providence Police Chief Col. Oscar Perez said in a Dec. 17 news conference. \"We don’t know where the person is or who he is.\"\n\nBut law enforcement experts say it's unlikely the killer can stay off the radar forever. Widespread surveillance methods, improving technology and the likelihood that somebody will recognize him all make it likely he will be caught eventually, experts told USA TODAY.\n\n\"It's always possible for someone to slip away,\" said Dan Linskey, former chief of the Boston Police Department. \"And, it's likely that they will find him through these methods.\"\n\nHow did the Brown shooting suspect escape?\n\nIt's not unprecedented for a shooting suspect to evade capture in the immediate aftermath of a shooting, experts said. Take as examples the suspect in the killing of Charlie Kirk, Tyler Robinson, who allegedly jumped off a rooftop and ran away in a wooded area after the attack at Valley University in September; or Luigi Mangione, accused of shooting a health care CEO and then fleeing on foot and on a bike.\n\n\"They have the advantage of chaos in their favor,\" said Joseph Giacalone, a retired New York Police Officer sergeant, Supervisor Detective Squad, and adjunct professor at the John Jay College of Criminal Justice. In the Brown case, \"the police are driving right by,\" Giacalone said.\n\nThere were no clear surveillance images of the killer going in or out of the building where the shooting took place, the Barus and Holley building. The building is equipped with some cameras, but the shooting took place in an \"older\" portion of the building that has \"few, if any\" security cameras, Rhode Island Attorney General Peter Neronha has said.\n\nVideo footage from the incident shows only \"chaos,\" and not a shot of the suspect leaving the scene or inside the building, he said.\n\n\"You have a situation brewing where the person at the time of the event is as close to your crime scene as possible, and now here we are days later, and they're saying he could be anywhere,\" Giacalone said.\n\nThe lack of security footage of the shooter on campus has drawn criticism from the campus community and even President Donald Trump. But Linskey said the absence of cameras in the building is \"not a failure.\"\n\n\"Most likely the person was still going to be masked up, and still we would have not been able to have focused on their face, and we'd be in a similar place that we are now,\" said Linskey, now a managing director at financial and risk advisory solutions provider Kroll.\n\nInvestigators still have tools to track down the killer\n\nWithout footage from the crime scene, investigators can still work with the footage they can gather from the community, where businesses and residents have their own cameras. Linskey said police are likely combing through that footage to track the shooter’s movements in the days before and after the attack. That could lead them to wherever the suspect is hiding or uncover a clearer picture of their face captured on surveillance footage.\n\nSurveillance footage can help investigators identify a potential suspect based on a tip from the public or through the use of artificial intelligence and facial recognition software, Linskey said. Once they have a name, police can use investigative tools like geofence warrants to determine if that person left a digital footprint near the crime scene.\n\nAuthorities also announced they recovered DNA from the crime scene, which Linskey said they can run against criminal databases and even commercial databases where people upload their DNA to find out about their heritage.\n\nGiacalone calls the three biggest tools used in manhunts the \"three forensic horsemen\": cell phone records, internet records and surveillance. Investigators can use available footage to see the suspect's movements in as many places as possible, and check cell phone records through cell towers to find out who was there at that time.\n\n\"The individual was dressed as they were, their efforts to disguise themselves with the hat and the mask, that's been effective for him so far,\" Linskey said. \"But at some point hopefully they get a piece of data that identifies that face or allows people to identify the face.\"\n\nSomeone who knows the perpetrator can also recognize and turn them in, Giacalone said.\n\n\"He has a specific gait... anybody who knows him and saw that walk would be able to identify him,\" he said.\n\nCan a shooter really just disappear? How long will the search take?\n\nIt's technically possible for someone to stay on the run and slip away altogether, Linskey said, that's not likely in this case. The widespread use of surveillance cameras, including traffic cameras and home surveillance cameras, and the advancement of technology that can assist investigators in scanning footage and locating additional images of the suspect make it much harder for a shooter to vanish completely. It would take a very skilled perpetrator and lots of planning to evade law enforcement forever, said Linskey, who served as incident commander during the manhunt for the perpetrators of the 2013 Boston Marathon bombing.\n\nGiacalone said he expects investigators will have nabbed the suspect within the next week, if not sooner. But until then, the killer still poses a danger, he said. It's not a case that will ever be \"over,\" Giacalone said, adding that investigators will keep pursuing the suspect for as long as it takes.\n\nWhile the public rightfully wants someone to be held accountable for the shooting as soon as possible, manhunts like this can take time, Linskey said.\n\nHe pointed out that it took police days to track down Mangione, the suspect in the killing of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson. Meanwhile, he noted the FBI searched for years before arresting a suspect accused of planting pipe bombs in Washington, D.C., ahead of the Jan. 6, 2021 mob at the U.S. Capitol.\n\n“It all depends on the information, cooperation and sometimes, quite frankly, luck,” said Linskey.","url":"https://eu.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2025/12/18/brown-university-shooting-suspect-search/87827817007/","image":"https://www.gannett-cdn.com/authoring/authoring-images/2025/12/18/USAT/87833426007-brown-university-01.jpg?auto=webp&crop=5999,3375,x0,y312&format=pjpg&width=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-18 20:19:37","author":"Usa Today","authors":["Usa Today"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.285},{"id":387347286,"title":"How Trump's new $1,776 ‘Warrior Dividend’ is being paid for","text":"WASHINGTON (AP) — The “Warrior Dividend” that President Donald Trump announced during his televised address to the nation Wednesday is not a Christmas bonus made possible by tariff revenues, as the president suggested.\n\nInstead, the $1,776 payments to troops are coming from a congressionally-approved housing supplement — money they were already set to receive — that was a part of tax cut extensions and expansions bill signed into law in July. Trump’s administration identified the source of the “dividend” payments Thursday. \n\nIn his remarks, Trump alluded to his “One Big Beautiful Bill Act” playing a role, but suggested that tariffs were largely responsible for the payments already on the way to 1.45 million members of the military.\n\n“We made a lot more money than anybody thought because of tariffs and the bill helped us along. Nobody deserves it more than our military,” he said in announcing what he described as a “dividend.”\n\nTrump has teased the idea of using his sweeping tariffs on imports to give Americans dividends ever since he imposed them in April. But these new payments are being disbursed by the Pentagon from a $2.9 billion military housing supplement that was part of Trump’s “One Big Beautiful Bill Act” to augment existing housing allowances, according to a senior administration official who requested anonymity to describe the payments.\n\nThe amount of the payments is a nod to next year’s 250th anniversary of the signing of the Declaration of Independence in 1776. In total, the measure is expected to cost $2.6 billion. \n\nTrump’s announcement comes as he’s faced pressure to show he’s working to address rising costs for Americans, with prices remaining stubbornly high as the president has imposed double-digit tariffs on imports from almost every country. Trump has promised to lower prices, but he has struggled to do so. Inflation hit a four-decade high in June 2022 during Joe Biden’s presidency and then began to fall. But inflation has stayed elevated under Trump in part because of his tariffs.\n\nSeparately, members of the U.S. Coast Guard will be getting a similar one-time payment, the Department of Homeland Security announced Thursday. The “Devotion to Duty” payments, authorized by Secretary Kristi Noem a day earlier, will be $2,000 because, unlike the “Warrior Dividend,” they are subject to taxes. The amount Coast Guard members take home will be closer to $1,776. \n\nThe payments, according to the Coast Guard, will be classified as “special duty pay.” They will be paid for with money in a measure Trump signed in November, after a 43-day shutdown, that funds the government through January. \n\nIt’s not the first time Trump has brandished ‘dividends’\n\nSending money to voters is a timeworn tool for politicians and one that Trump has repeatedly tried to use, including this year. \n\nTrump has for months suggested every American could receive a $2,000 dividend from the import taxes — an effort that seemed designed to try to shore up support for tariffs, which the president has said protect American industries and will lure manufacturing back from overseas.\n\nBut that particular pledge appeared to exceed the revenues being generated by his tariffs, according to a November analysis by the right-leaning Tax Foundation. The analysis estimated that the $2,000 payments being promised to taxpayers could add up to between $279.8 billion and $606.8 billion, depending on how they were structured.\n\nThe analysis estimated that Trump’s import taxes would produce $158.4 billion in total revenue during 2025 and another $207.5 billion in 2026. That’s not enough money to provide the payments as well as reduce the budget deficit, which Trump has also claimed his tariffs are doing.\n\nEarlier this year, as his Department of Government Efficiency was slashing the U.S. government and its workforce, Trump had briefly proposed sending a DOGE “dividend” back to U.S. citizens.\n\nNeither the tariff dividend or DOGE dividend has come to fruition, and members of Trump’s own party as well as officials in his administration have expressed some skepticism about the idea. There is also the risk that the payments being promised by Trump could push up inflation, as they would likely spur greater consumer spending. Republican lawmakers argued in 2021 that the pandemic relief package from then-President Biden — which included direct payments — helped trigger the run-up in inflation.\n\nAssociated Press writers Rebecca Santana, Konstantin Toropin and Lisa Mascaro contributed to this report.","url":"https://apnews.com/article/trump-military-dividend-housing-5990b3810a704e46e2b93152253f439c","image":"https://dims.apnews.com/dims4/default/84deccc/2147483647/strip/false/crop/2668x1779+0+0/resize/1486x991!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fassets.apnews.com%2Fd7%2F7f%2F6890f76466c89dc42c32aa4ab14d%2Fee83f42dfed243bf8456cc193482875f","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-18 20:18:20","author":"Josh Boak","authors":["Josh Boak"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.455},{"id":387347430,"title":"House backs bill to speed permitting reviews for new energy and infrastructure projects","text":"WASHINGTON (AP) — The House approved legislation Thursday aimed at speeding up permitting reviews for new energy and infrastructure projects that now take five or more years to complete, as lawmakers seek to meet growing demand for electricity and other forms of energy. \n\nThe bill, dubbed the SPEED Act, would also limit judicial review as Congress seeks to enact the most significant change in decades to the National Environmental Policy Act, a bedrock environmental law that requires federal agencies to consider a project’s possible environmental impacts before it is approved. \n\nThe bill was approved, 221-196, and now goes to the Senate.\n\nRepublicans and many Democrats believe the 55-year-old environmental policy law has become mired in red tape that routinely results in years-long delays for major projects. The law requires detailed analysis for major projects and allows for public comments before approvals are issued. A recent study found that environmental reviews often total nearly 600 pages and take nearly five years to complete.\n\nThe House bill would place statutory limits on environmental reviews, broaden the scope of actions that don’t require review and set clear deadlines. It also limits who can bring legal challenges and legal remedies that courts can impose. \n\n“The SPEED Act is a focused, bipartisan effort to restore common sense and accountability to federal permitting,’' said Rep. Bruce Westerman, R-Arkansas, the bill’s chief sponsor.\n\nClearing a ‘bureaucratic bottleneck’\n\n While NEPA was passed “with the best of intentions,” it has become unwieldly in the decades since, said Westerman, who chairs the House Natural Resources Committee and has long pushed for permitting reform.\n\n“Unfortunately, what was meant to facilitate responsible development has been twisted into a bureaucratic bottleneck that delays investments in the infrastructure and technologies that make our country run,’' Westerman said Thursday on the House floor.\n\nDemocrats agreed that the permitting process has become unwieldy, but said the House bill does not address the real causes of delay and undercuts public input and participation while overly restricting judicial review.\n\n“The SPEED Act treats environmental reviews as a nuisance rather than a tool to prevent costly, harmful mistakes,” said California Rep. Jared Huffman, the top Democrat on the Natural Resources panel. \n\n“Weakening environmental review won’t fix permitting challenges (and) won’t help us build the clean energy future that we need,” Huffman said. “Gutting NEPA only invites more risk, more mistakes, more litigation, more damage to communities that already face too many environmental burdens.”\n\nEleven Democrats voted for the bill, while one Republican, Rep. Brian Fitzpatrick of Pennsylvania, opposed it.\n\nGOP amendment would block offshore wind \n\nHuffman and other critics also complained that the bill could harm wind and solar projects that ae being shut down by the Trump administration. A last-minute change this week allows the administration to continue to block some offshore wind projects, bending to demands by conservatives who oppose offshore wind.\n\nThe American Clean Power Association, which represents wind developers, pulled its support for the bill because of the changes, which were demanded by Republican Reps. Andy Harris of Maryland and Jeff Van Drew of New Jersey.\n\nThe GOP amendment “fundamentally changed legislation that represented genuine bipartisan progress on permitting reform,’' said Jason Grumet, the group’s CEO. “It’s disappointing that a partisan amendment .... has now jeopardized that progress, turning what should have been a win for American energy into another missed opportunity.”\n\nHarris, who chairs the conservative House Freedom Caucus, defended the change, which he said “will protect legal actions the Trump administration has taken thus far to combat the Biden offshore wind agenda,” including a project in Maryland that the administration has moved to block. \n\nWesterman called the change minor and said that without it, “we probably would not have gotten permitting reform done.” \n\nRep. Jared Golden, D-Maine, the bill’s co-sponsor, said lawmakers from both parties have long agreed that “America’s broken permitting system is delaying investments in the basics we need — energy, transportation and housing.”\n\nSupport for the measure “gives me hope that Congress is finally ready to take the win’’ on permitting reform, Golden said.\n\nA win for business, but environmentalists raise alarm \n\nBusiness groups, including the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, hailed the vote.\n\n“Permitting reform is not just a business issue — it is a national priority,’' said Rodney Davis, senior vice president for government affairs. \n\n“Delays in project approvals hinder economic development, increase costs for consumers and undermine America’s ability to build and maintain critical infrastructure,” Davis said. “Modernizing this process will enable timely construction of projects that deliver affordable and reliable energy ... expand broadband connectivity (and) strengthen our ability to compete in the global race for AI innovation.”\n\nEnvironmental groups said the bill undermines a fundamental environmental law while empowering the Trump administration to quickly permit polluting projects without adequate review.\n\n“We urgently need to build the infrastructure necessary to address the climate crisis and to transition to a clean energy economy, but this bill is not the solution,” said Stephen Schima, a senior lawyer for Earthjustice Action.\n\n “Far from helping build the clean energy projects of the future, the SPEED Act will only result in an abundance of contaminated air and water, dirty projects and chronic illnesses, with fewer opportunities to hold polluters accountable in court,” he said.\n\nHouse approval of the permitting measure shifts focus to the Senate, where a broader deal that includes changes to the Clean Water Act to facilitate pipeline projects and transmission lines is being considered. \n\nDemocrats, including Sens. Martin Heinrich of New Mexico and Sheldon Whitehouse of Rhode Island, also are pursuing legislation to make it harder for President Donald Trump to cancel permits for clean-energy projects.","url":"https://apnews.com/article/nepa-energy-projects-environmental-review-speed-02fcdd02031a03f85f6d066c42ecc906","image":"https://dims.apnews.com/dims4/default/80de600/2147483647/strip/false/crop/4000x2667+0+0/resize/1486x991!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fassets.apnews.com%2Ffd%2F1a%2Fc7b2125084b3dd70a02e02f8ba0d%2F549fba3496e94ef3bcfb6397250a72b4","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-18 20:11:38","author":"Matthew Daly","authors":["Matthew Daly"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.084},{"id":387347366,"title":"Rob Reiner urges Holocaust survivors to show 'resilience' in recorded Hanukkah message","text":"JERUSALEM (AP) — In a video message recorded weeks before he was killed, Hollywood icon Rob Reiner urged Holocaust survivors participating in a Hanukkah ceremony on Thursday to “be resilient” during difficult times.\n\nReiner and his wife, Michele, were found stabbed to death Sunday at their home in Los Angeles, law enforcement officials said. Their 32-year-old son, Nick Reiner, has been charged with two counts of first-degree murder and is being held without bail.\n\nReiner, who was Jewish, recorded the message for the Hanukkah event in the beginning of October. He noted that his wife’s extended family was killed at Auschwitz during the Holocaust, giving the ceremony special meaning for him.\n\n“We’re living in a time where what’s happening in our country is scary and reminiscent of what we’ve seen happen in the past, and we just hope that we can all survive this and that we can hold on to our democracy,” Reiner, who was an outspoken advocate for liberal causes, said in his message.\n\nThe video was broadcast as part of a virtual candle lighting ceremony honoring Holocaust survivors internationally on the fifth night of Hanukkah. The event is an initiative of the Conference on Jewish Material Claims Against Germany, an organization that advocates for Holocaust survivors.\n\nAround 100 Holocaust survivors gathered at the Western Wall in Jerusalem on Thursday afternoon for a candle-lighting ceremony.\n\nIn Hebrew, Hanukkah means “dedication,” and the holiday marks the rededication of the Temple in Jerusalem in the second century B.C., after a small group of Jewish fighters liberated it from occupying foreign forces.\n\nJews celebrate the eight-day holiday, which this year began on Sunday, by lighting a nightly candle in honor of the tiny supply of ritually pure oil that they found in the Temple that lasted for eight nights, instead of just one.\n\nMany Jewish communities are reeling from the attack on a Hanukkah event in Sydney, Australia, where 15 people were killed. \n\n“Even in these difficult days, when antisemitism is rising and Jewish communities around the world are under attack — this very week on the first night of Hanukkah in Sydney, Australia — we draw strength and inspiration from you, the survivors, from your personal and collective resilience,” Greg Schneider, the executive vice president of the Claims Conference, told the group of survivors in Jerusalem.\n\nIn addition to Reiner, Barbra Streisand, Billy Crystal, Jason Alexander, Julianna Margulies, Debra Messing, Adam Arkin and Jamie Lee Curtis were among those who made prerecorded videos for the event. Journalists Wolf Blitzer and Dana Bash also recorded messages.\n\n“If ever we needed to be resilient, it’s now,” Reiner said in his message. “Let’s be resilient.”\n\nReiner was a vocal critic of U.S. President Donald Trump, calling him in a 2017 interview with Variety “mentally unfit” to be president and “the single-most unqualified human being to ever assume the presidency of the United States.” In a shocking post after Reiner’s death, Trump suggested that Rob Reiner’s outspoken opposition was partially responsible for his murder.","url":"https://apnews.com/article/rob-michele-reiner-hanukkah-holocaust-jerusalem-09a6e73630805abb0745aef29abc042d","image":"https://dims.apnews.com/dims4/default/31a082f/2147483647/strip/false/crop/1152x768+0+0/resize/1152x768!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fassets.apnews.com%2F23%2F85%2Fa5a84a9d10f5cd5a9ae2fc770630%2Fc2d3f0362edb41fcb639d5da7845caf0","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-18 20:11:23","author":"Melanie Lidman","authors":["Melanie Lidman"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.054},{"id":387347600,"title":"Kennedy Center Board Votes Unanimously to Add Donald Trump's Name to Iconic D.C.

He will meet in Miami with officials from Qatar, Egypt and Turkey, said the State Department official, who spoke on condition of anonymity to preview a meeting that has not yet been publicly announced.\n\nThere, the officials will review the implementation of Phase 2 of the ceasefire agreement between Israel and Hamas.\n\nThe U.S.-brokered truce took effect on Oct. 10, pausing more than two years of war.\n\nIn the first phase, Hamas returned the hostages it was holding while Israel returned thousands of Palestinian prisoners and allowed greater quantities of humanitarian aid into war-battered Gaza. The ceasefire has since stalled, with both sides accusing each other of violations.\n\nThe second phase, one far more challenging, is supposed to involve the deployment of an international security force, an internationally supervised technocratic governing body for Gaza, the disarmament of Hamas and further Israeli troop withdrawals from the territory. The process is to be overseen by a “Board of Peace” chaired by President Donald Trump.\n\nNeither the board nor the international force have yet assembled. Israel has expressed opposition to the potential participation of various countries, including Turkey.\n\nTurkey’s Foreign Ministry confirmed the participation of Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan at Friday’s talks in Miami. The Qatari prime minister, who doubles as the country’s foreign minister, said in an interview in Al Jazeera that he, too, would be joining the meeting. \n\nSheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani added that there was an “urgent need” to advance to the next phase and form a Palestinian civil administration in Gaza. He said that the international force must not “protect one party at the expense of another.”\n\nHe also accused Israel of repeated violations, saying they risk undermining the agreement and placing mediators in an “embarrassing position.” \n\nHamas is calling for more international pressure on Israel to open key border crossings, cease deadly strikes and allow more aid into the strip. Israel is demanding the militants return the remains of a final hostage, Ran Gvili.\n\nMeanwhile, Palestinians in Gaza are struggling with a lack of aid.

The Drug Enforcement Administration describes Schedule I substances as having no \"medical use and a high potential for abuse.\"\n\nInstead, Trump ordered that marijuana be classified as a Schedule III drug, which the DEA describes as having \"a moderate to low potential for physical and psychological dependence.\"\n\n\"Today, I'm pleased to announce that I will be signing an executive order to reschedule marijuana from a schedule one to a schedule three controlled substance with legitimate medical uses,\" Trump said.\n\nHe added that the order \"is not the legalization − does it legalize marijuana in any way, shape or form, and no way sanctions its use as a recreational drug.\"\n\nWhat did Trump's order do?\n\nTrump’s order directed Attorney General Pam Bondi to \"take all necessary steps to complete the rulemaking process\" to reclassify marijuana as a Schedule III drug. His order also said the administration would work with Congress to redefine hemp-derived cannabinoid products so that Americans can get access to CBD products.\n\n\"This gives (rescheduling) a big push forward and sends a pretty clear signal about the likely outcome,\" said David Pozen, a law professor at Columbia University who wrote the book \"The Constitution of the War on Drugs.\" Pozen added: \"It's a big deal for the rescheduling debate but it's by no means going to bring closure to our marijuana policy fights.\"\n\nMarijuana businesses expect to benefit from reclassification\n\nTrump’s change doesn't make marijuana legal at the federal level. But the reclassification could lower tax burdens for firms, accelerate research, enable standardized drug development and improve access to capital.\n\nAn immediate advantage for the industry is a business-tax break for companies making Schedule III drugs, in contrast to no tax breaks for those making Schedule I drugs. But unless the Food and Drug Administration approves of marijuana for medical uses, companies will still be unable to sell their products across state lines.\n\n\"The main effect of rescheduling will be a tax cut for marijuana firms,\" Pozen said. \"This won’t authorize medical marijuana at the federal level.\"\n\nShares of cannabis firms rose in premarket trading Dec. 18 because of expectations about Trump’s action. Tilray shares gained nearly 5%, SNDL rose 3%, Canopy Growth was up more than 5% and AdvisorShares Pure US Cannabis was up 6.5% before the bell.\n\nTrump is considering a Medicare pilot program that would provide some seniors access to CBD, according to reports.\n\nRescheduling and Medicare coverage would likely attract investments from financial institutions and other investors.\n\nNearly all states regulate marijuana but it remains contentious\n\nThe federal Controlled Substances Act lumped marijuana with the most dangerous drugs in 1970.\n\nSince then, two dozen states, three territories and the District of Columbia have allowed or regulated recreational use of marijuana, according to Reuters. Nearly all states – 45 – allow the medical or recreational use of marijuana.\n\nNearly two-thirds of Americans supported legalization in a Gallup survey from October, up from 36% two decades ago.\n\nBut the push to decriminalize marijuana by removing criminal penalties associated with it or to legalize it at the state level remains contentious.\n\nOhio Gov. Mike DeWine has said he would sign legislation approved this month further restricting where marijuana can be grown. Businesses have sued DeWine over a ban on over-the-counter sales of products infused with THC, the intoxicating element in marijuana.\n\nA Florida ballot initiative in 2024 aimed to legalize marijuana for people at least 21 years old, and allow them to possess up to 3 ounces. Supporters spent hundreds of millions of dollars advocating for the measure, but Gov. Ron DeSantis strongly opposed it. Despite support from nearly 56% of voters, the measure fell short of the 60% majority needed for approval.\n\nTrump's stance on marijuana contrasts with enforcement against other drugs\n\nFormer President Joe Biden ordered the Department of Health and Human Services to review marijuana's classification in 2022. The administration in 2024 proposed a rule to reschedule marijuana, but it has been on hold since March.\n\nTrump has considered the change for a while. He said in August he was \"looking at reclassification\" of marijuana, noting the issue has supporters and detractors.\n\n\"Some people like it, some people hate it. Some people hate the whole concept of marijuana,\" he said.\n\nTrump’s stance on marijuana contrasts with his aggressive approach to drug enforcement against fentanyl and cocaine. During his second term, the Pentagon has been striking alleged drug boats off the coast of Venezuela.\n\nBut during the 2024 campaign, Trump supported a Florida ballot measure that would have legalized the drug in the Sunshine State. The measure failed.\n\n\"I believe it is time to end needless arrests and incarcerations of adults for small amounts of marijuana for personal use,\" Trump said in his statement about the Florida ballot initiative.\n\nThis story has been updated to add new information.","url":"https://eu.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2025/12/18/trump-reclassifies-marijuana-less-dangerous/87827108007/","image":"https://www.gannett-cdn.com/authoring/authoring-images/2025/12/18/USAT/87830705007-2252588732.jpg?auto=webp&crop=5885,3311,x0,y0&format=pjpg&width=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-18 19:15:22","author":"Usa Today","authors":["Usa Today"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.165},{"id":387346840,"title":"NASCAR icon Greg Biffle and family killed in fireball plane crash, friend says","text":"NASCAR legend Greg Biffle and his family including his five-year-old son are among those killed in a plane crash today in North Carolina, his close friend has announced.\n\nMultiple fatalities have been reported after a Cessna C550 private jet, which was owned by Biffle, smashed into the runway at Statesville Regional Airport.

Cannabis would instead be a Schedule III substance, like ketamine and some anabolic steroids.\n\nReclassification by the Drug Enforcement Administration would not make it legal for recreational use by adults nationwide, but it could change how the drug is regulated and reduce a hefty tax burden on the cannabis industry.\n\nThe Republican president said he had received a deluge of phone calls supporting the move and its potential to help patients. “We have people begging for me to do this. People that are in great pain,” he said.\n\nMedical marijuana is now allowed by 40 states and Washington, D.C., and many states have also legalized it for recreational use. But U.S. laws have remained stricter, potentially leaving people subject to federal prosecution.\n\nThe Justice Department under Trump’s Democratic predecessor, Joe Biden, previously proposed reclassifying marijuana to a Schedule III substance. Unlike Biden, Trump did not have open encouragement from across his party for the move. Some Republicans have spoken out in opposition to any changes and urged Trump to maintain current standards.\n\nSuch a switch typically requires an arduous process, including a public comment period that has drawn tens of thousands of reactions from across the U.S. The DEA was still in the review process when Trump took office in January. Trump ordered that process to move along as quickly as legally possible, though an exact timeline remained unclear.\n\nPolling from Gallup shows Americans largely back a less restrictive approach: Support for marijuana legalization has grown from just 36% in 2005 to 64% this year. Yet that’s down slightly from a couple of years ago, primarily because of declining support among Republicans, Gallup said.\n\nTrump’s order also calls for expanded research and access to CBD, a legal and increasingly popular hemp-derived product whose benefits to treat things like pain, anxiety and sleep issues are debated by experts. \n\nA new Medicare pilot program would allow older adults to access legal hemp-derived CBD at no cost, if recommended by a doctor, said Dr. Mehmet Oz, who heads the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. \n\nStill, the marijuana changes are not universally welcomed. More than 20 Republican senators, several of them staunch Trump allies, signed a letter this year urging the president to keep marijuana a Schedule I drug. \n\nLed by North Carolina Sen. Ted Budd, the group argued that marijuana continues to be dangerous and that a shift would “undermine your strong efforts to Make America Great Again.” They argued, too, that marijuana negatively affects users’ physical and mental health, as well as road and workplace safety. \n\n“The only winners from rescheduling will be bad actors such as Communist China, while Americans will be left paying the bill,” the letter said, referring to China’s place in the cannabis market.\n\nIn the early days of the second Trump administration, the Justice Department showed little interest in discussing marijuana rescheduling, which had encountered strong resistance from inside the DEA under Biden, according to a former U.S. official who spoke on the condition of anonymity in an effort to avoid retaliation.\n\nTrump has made his crusade against other drugs, especially fentanyl, a feature of his second term, ordering U.S. military attacks on Venezuelan and other boats the administration insists are ferrying drugs. He signed another executive order declaring fentanyl a weapon of mass destruction.\n\nJack Riley, a former deputy administrator of the DEA, backed the focus on the drug war as a national security priority, but said marijuana rescheduling sends a conflicting message. \n\n“He’s blowing up boats in Latin America that he says are full of fentanyl and cocaine but on the other hand loosening the restrictions that will allow wider exposure to a first-level drug,” said Riley, who was in the running to lead the DEA upon Trump’s return to the White House. “That is clearly a contradiction.”\n\nOpponents like the group Smart Approaches to Marijuana vowed to sue if the reclassification goes through. \n\nOn the other end of the spectrum, some pro-marijuana advocates want to see the government go further and treat cannabis more like alcohol. Trump hasn’t committed to bigger steps like decriminalizing marijuana, and said Thursday that he encouraged his own children not to use drugs. \n\nStill, he said “the facts compel” the government to recognize that marijuana can have legitimate medical applications. And it has become a part of the health care environment in many states. \n\nCurrently, 30,000 licensed health care practitioners are authorized to recommend its use for more than 6 million patients for at least 15 medical conditions, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services found. \n\nThe Food and Drug Administration has found credible scientific support for its use to treat anorexia-related medical conditions, nausea, vomiting and pain. Older adults, in particular, are using it for chronic pain, which afflicts 1 in 3 from that age group.\n\nBarrow reported from Atlanta.

Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts in Washington is now known as the the \"Trump-Kennedy Center,\" according to the White House.\n\nThe Kennedy Center's board of trustees voted unanimously on Dec. 18 to rename the national music, arts and cultural institution after President Donald Trump, White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said in a statement. The board, which Trump chairs, is made up of mostly members handpicked by the president.\n\nThe full name is The Donald J. Trump and The John F. Kennedy Memorial Center for the Performing Arts, Roma Daravi, the center's vice president of public relations, told USA TODAY.\n\nYet an official name change appears to require action from Congress. A law passed in 1964, months after President John F. Kennedy's assassination, established the construction of \"a building to be designated as the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts.\" The law did not grant the board authority to change its name.\n\nLeavitt said the board renamed the facility in Trump's honor \"because of the unbelievable work President Trump has done over the last year in saving the building. Not only from the standpoint of its reconstruction, but also financially, and its reputation.\"\n\n\"Congratulations to President Donald J. Trump, and likewise, congratulations to President Kennedy, because this will be a truly great team long into the future! The building will no doubt attain new levels of success and grandeur,\" Leavitt said.\n\nOne month into his second term in office, Trump in February terminated the Kennedy Center's board and installed himself as the new chairman while tapping several political allies as new board members. Trump chose Ric Grenell, his envoy for special missions, as the center's president.\n\nThe Kennedy Center, which opened in 1971 in honor of the late 35th president of the United States, serves as the nation's arts and cultural center, offering a wide assortment of concerts, plays and other live acts to paying customers. The facility is owned by the federal government.\n\nMore: 'I never liked 'Hamilton' very much,' President Trump says in visit to Kennedy Center\n\nTrump has promised to transform the center with new upgrades, improve its financial standing, eliminate what he called \"woke\" programming and bring \"Broadway hits\" back to the center. Trump has claimed the center declined under \"bad management\" and characterized a $250 million expansion project prior to his second White House term as a waste.\n\n\"I was surprised by it, and I was honored by it,\" Trump said on Dec. 18 from the Oval Office when asked about the board's name change. \"We saved the building. That building was in such bad shape, both physically and financially and every other way. Now it's very solid, very strong.\n\n\"We saved the Kennedy Center,\" the president added.\n\nDemocrat on Kennedy board disputes 'unanimous' vote\n\nRep. Joyce Beatty, D-Ohio, one of the board's ex-officio members not appointed by Trump, disputed Leavitt's claim of a \"unanimous\" vote. In a video posted on X, Beatty said she was not allowed to speak during the board's meeting, which was conducted by phone, as members voted on the name change.\n\n\"As I tried to push my button to voice my concern to ask questions ‒ and to certainly not to vote in support of this ‒ I was muted,\" Beatty said. \"Each time I tried to speak, I was muted.\"\n\nReferencing the 1964 federal law, Beatty said, \"Clearly, the Congress has a say in this,\" calling the name change \"just another attempt to evade the law and not let the people have a say.\"\n\nOther Democrats also slammed the move. Rep. Steve Cohen, D-Tennessee, called the board's name change \"outrageous\" and said it \"must be repealed.\"\n\n\"The Kennedy Center was named for President John F. Kennedy, a martyred hero and patron of the arts,\" Cohen said. \"To slap Trump’s shiny name on the iconic structure is a sacrilege, an insult to his memory and an offense to the American people. What’s next, the Trump Washington Monument? The Trump Lincoln Memorial?”\n\nSenate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-New York, in a statement said: \"At a time when costs are at an all-time high and Americans are paying more and getting less, Trump proves once again that he cares about his ego ‒ not your family.\"\n\nTrump secured $257 million for Kennedy Center upgrades in his \"One Big Beautiful Bill\" law approved by Congress last summer. About 16% of the Kennedy's Center annual $268 million operating budget comes from the federal government, with the rest coming through private donations.\n\nDuring his first year back in the White House, Trump has frequented the center more often than his first term.\n\nTrump attended a performance of \"Les Misérables\" at the Kennedy Center in June, igniting both boos and cheers from the crowd. He opened the Kennedy Center on Dec. 5 for the 2026 FIFA World Cup Final Draw. And after skipping the annual Kennedy Honors during his first term, Trump on Dec. 7 hosted the star-studded event from the Oval Office.\n\nReach Joey Garrison on X @joeygarrison.","url":"https://eu.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2025/12/18/trump-kennedy-center-takeover-white-house/87829719007/","image":"https://www.gannett-cdn.com/authoring/authoring-images/2025/12/18/USAT/87829907007-20250317-t-212956-z-268085538-rc-29-fdac-1-aqe-rtrmadp-3-usatrumpkennedycenter.JPG?auto=webp&crop=6499,3656,x0,y339&format=pjpg&width=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-18 18:48:40","author":"Usa Today","authors":["Usa Today"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.224},{"id":387347572,"title":"Ecuador Launches Joint-U.S. Military Operation to Fight 'Narco-Terrorism'","text":"The president of Ecuador, Daniel Noboa, announced on Wednesday that his country would be welcoming members of the United States Air Force for a temporary joint operation intended to fight drug trafficking and narco-terrorism.\n\nThe American Embassy in Quito confirmed the arrival of U.S. forces to the port city of Manta, where the Ecuadorian military maintains air force units in facilities where U.S. forces were formerly stationed — prior to the country banning permanent foreign military bases.\n\nThe news arrives shortly after Department of Homeland Security (DHS) chief Kristi Noem visited the Manta air force base alongside Noboa in November and follows months of Noboa publicly asking President Donald Trump for reinforcements to help the country fight its increasingly powerful drug trafficking gangs. Trump has prioritized Latin America in his foreign policy during his second term in office, approving “Operation Southern Spear,” a military mission in the Caribbean Sea intended to destroy and otherwise neutralize drug-shipping vessels operating illegally in the area. A presence in Manta would expand these operations into the Pacific Ocean, located strategically on the coast across from the country’s Galápagos Islands.\n\nNoboa offered few details on Wednesday regarding the operation, stating only that it would help limit the scope of illicit drug trafficking.\n\n“With the backing of the United States, we activated a temporary operation alongside the Ecuadorian Air Force in Manta, as part of a bilateral, long-term security strategy,” the president announced. “This operation will allow the identification and disarticulation of drug trafficking routes and to subdue those who believed they could take over the country.”\n\nIn a separate statement, the American embassy in Ecuador confirmed the operation, also referring to it as “temporary.”\n\n“This joint, short-term effort is part of a long-term bilateral security strategy,” the embassy said, echoing Noboa’s language, “in line with the agreements currently active conforming to Ecuadorian law.”\n\n“The operation will improve the Ecuadorian armed forces’ capacity to combat narco-terrorists, including the strengthening of information gathering and capacity to fight drug trafficking,” the statement added, “and is designed to protect the United States and Ecuador before our shared threats.”\n\nThe U.S. military was actively present in Manta, Ecuador until 2009, when then-president Rafael Correa, an ardently anti-American socialist, banned cooperation with America. Correa was later accused of widespread corruption costing Ecuador billions of dollars in oil revenues through shady deals with China. He is currently a fugitive, avoiding a warrant for his arrest by living in Belgium.\n\nNoboa, 38, was re-elected with a solid 11-percent lead in April on a platform vowing to end organized criminal violence in the country. Upon taking over following a special election in 2023, Noboa faced an outburst of gang violence that threatened to destabilize the country. His presidential campaign repeatedly made use of his positive relationship with President Donald Trump — notable given Noboa’s first presidential campaign framing him as a center-left outsider focused on climate change — and he personally advocated for more American involvement in the country.\n\nNoboa visited Trump’s Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida shortly before the April elections, reportedly asking the president for more joint cooperation in fighting drug trafficking. During that visit, Noboa told reporters that he also approved of Trump’s efforts in the Atlantic Ocean to contain the nefarious effects of drug traffickers allied with the socialist regime in Venezuela.\n\n“He asked me what I thought of what he had done with Venezuela and I told him that I thought it was good,” Noboa said at the time, prior to the launching of Operation Southern Spear, “because it cannot be that the United States has an anti-dictatorship, anti-terrorism stance and at the same time an American company is buying oil from Venezuela. It was my opinion.”\n\n“We would like to cooperate with U.S. forces, and I think there are many ways to do that,” Noboa said after his re-election, “especially in tracking illegal operations moving out of Ecuador.

Kennedy in 1964, after his assassination. Donald A. Ritchie, who served as Senate historian from 2009-2015, said that because Congress had first named the center it would be up to Congress to “amend the law.” \n\nRitchie said that while Trump and others can “informally” refer to the center by a different name, they couldn’t do it in a way “that would (legally) stick.”\n\nBut the board did not wait for that debate to play out, immediately changing the branding on its website to reflect the new name: \n\nHouse Democratic leader Hakeem Jeffries told reporters that legislative action was needed, “and we’re going to make that clear.” The New York Democrat is an ex officio member of the board because of his position in Congress. \n\nTrump has teased the name change for some time\n\n“The Kennedy Center Board of Trustees voted unanimously today to name the institution The Donald J. Trump and The John F. Kennedy Memorial Center for the Performing Arts,” said Roma Daravi, the institution’s vice president for public relations. \n\nShe said the vote recognized that Trump saved the center from “financial ruin and physical destruction,” a pair of claims denied by the venue’s ousted leadership. \n\n“The new Trump Kennedy Center reflects the unequivocal bipartisan support for America’s cultural center for generations to come,” Daravi said.\n\nWhite House press secretary Karoline Leavitt announced the vote on social media, attributing it to the “unbelievable work” Trump has done on the center since he returned to office in January.\n\nTrump, a Republican who’s chairman of the board, said at the White House that he was “surprised” and “honored” by the vote. \n\n“The board is a very distinguished board, most distinguished people in the country, and I was surprised by it and I was honored by it,” he said. \n\nTrump had already been referring to the center as the “Trump Kennedy Center.” Asked Dec. 7 as he walked the red carpet for the Kennedy Center Honors program whether he would rename the venue after himself, Trump said such a decision would be up to the board.\n\nEarlier this month, he talked about a “big event” happening at the “Trump Kennedy Center” before saying, “excuse me, at the Kennedy Center,” as his audience laughed. He was referring to the FIFA World Cup soccer draw for 2026, in which he participated.\n\nThe name change isn’t sitting well with some Kennedy family members.\n\nMaria Shriver, a niece of John F. Kennedy, said it is “beyond comprehension” that Trump has sought to add his name to the memorial to her uncle and “beyond wild” that he would think doing so is acceptable. “It is not,” she said in a social media post.\n\nShriver said Kennedy was a president who brought the arts into the White House and she speculated that Trump might next seek to rename John F. Kennedy International Airport in New York or any of the other memorials to presidents in Washington.\n\nEarlier this year, Trump renovated the Kennedy-era Rose Garden at the White House to replace the lawn with paving stones. \n\nIn his own post on the social platform X, Shriver’s brother, Tim Shriver, called the renaming an “insult to a great president.”\n\nAnother Kennedy family member, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who is cousins with the Shrivers, serves in Trump’s Cabinet as secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services.\n\nTrump is more focused on the Kennedy Center \n\nTrump showed scant interest in the Kennedy Center during his first term as president, but since returning to office in January he has replaced board members appointed by Democratic presidents with some of his most ardent supporters, who then elected him as board chairman.\n\nHe has criticized the center’s past programming and current physical appearance and has vowed to overhaul both. \n\nTrump secured more than $250 million from the Republican-controlled Congress for renovations of the building, including the promise of fresh paint, new seats in the theaters and other upgrades.\n\nHe attended opening night of the musical “Les Misérables,” and last week he served as host of the Kennedy Center Honors program after not attending the show during his first term as president. The awards program is scheduled to be broadcast by CBS and Paramount+ on Dec. 23.\n\nSales of subscription packages are said to have declined since Trump’s takeover of the center, and several touring productions, including “Hamilton,” have canceled planned runs there. Rows of empty seats have been seen in the Concert Hall during performances by the National Symphony Orchestra. \n\nSome performers, including actor Issa Rae and musician Rhiannon Giddens, have scrapped scheduled appearances, and Kennedy Center consultants including musician Ben Folds and singer Renée Fleming have resigned.\n\nAP National Writer Hillel Italie in New York and Associated Press writer Kevin Freking in Washington contributed to this report.","url":"https://apnews.com/article/trump-kennedy-center-performing-arts-8b7159067174f3a0070b877c149ff0a7","image":"https://dims.apnews.com/dims4/default/5aee35d/2147483647/strip/false/crop/3778x2833+0+0/resize/1486x1114!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fassets.apnews.com%2F90%2F22%2F855366b9d69b065edb9920fd4570%2Ff2ac0963954648ffa7242d241baf6fca","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-18 18:31:53","author":"Darlene Superville","authors":["Darlene Superville"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.116},{"id":387347252,"title":"House Democrats release more Epstein photos","text":"WASHINGTON (AP) — House Democrats released several dozen more photos Thursday from the estate of the convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, showing his associations with the rich and famous, as the Department of Justice faces a deadline to release many of its case files on the late financier by the end of the week.\n\nThe photos released Thursday were among more than 95,000 that the House Oversight Committee has received after issuing a subpoena for the photos that Epstein had in his possession before he died in a New York jail cell in 2019. Congress has also passed, and President Donald Trump has signed, a law requiring the Justice Department to release its case files on Epstein, and his longtime girlfriend and confidante Ghislaine Maxwell, by Friday. Anticipation about what those files will show is running high after they have been the subject of conspiracy theories and speculation about his friendships with Trump, former President Bill Clinton, the former Prince Andrew, and others.\n\nHouse Democrats have already released dozens of photos from Epstein’s estate showing Trump, Clinton and Andrew, who lost his royal title and privileges this year amid scrutiny of his relationship with the wealthy financier. The photos released Thursday showed Epstein cooking with Sultan Ahmed bin Sulayem, an Emirati businessman. The photos also include the billionaire Bill Gates and images of a 2011 dinner of notable people and wealthy philanthropists hosted by a nonprofit group. The committee made no accusations of wrongdoing by the men in the photos.\n\nThere were also images of passports, visas and identification cards from Russia, the Czech Republic, Ukraine, South Africa and Lithuania with personally identifying information redacted, as well as photos of Epstein with women or girls whose faces were blacked out. The committee has said it is redacting information from the photos that may lead to the identity of victims being revealed.\n\nRep. Robert Garcia, the top Democrat on the oversight panel, said in a statement that the “new images raise more questions about what exactly the Department of Justice has in its possession.

A screenshot of text messages lists details about an 18-year-old Russian woman, including her height and weight, with the phrases “But she asks 1000$ per girl” and “I will send u girls now.”\n\nThe pictures with phrases from Vladimir Nabokov's \"Lolita,\" which was about a man's obsession with a 12-year-old girl, show phrasing from the book on a woman's cleavage or on a foot.\n\n\"She was Lo, plain Lo, in the morning, standing four feet ten in one sock,\" one line reads on a foot, with the book in the background.\n\nThe Democratic release came a day before the Justice Department is scheduled to release more documents from the criminal investigations against Epstein. He died by suicide in jail awaiting trial in 2019 on sex trafficking charges.\n\nTens of thousands of pages of records, including pictures from Epstein's private Caribbean island, depositions and email exchanges have already been released through civil lawsuits and Congress.\n\nBut Epstein’s victims and lawmakers have advocated for the release of all Epstein files, to potentially find others among his rich and famous acquaintances who could be charged with crimes. Congress passed a law President Donald Trump signed last month demanding the Justice Department release more of its files.\n\nThree federal judges have allowed the release of grand jury transcripts and other evidence that is traditionally kept confidential. The cases dealt with investigations when Epstein wasn’t charged federally in 2008, when he was charged in 2019 and of his associate Ghislaine Maxwell. She was convicted of conspiring with him and is serving a 20-year prison term.\n\nThe law also called on the department to release internal emails and memos about decisions about whether to charge people in the investigations. But Attorney General Pam Bondi could withhold documents that name victims, portray child sexual abuse or could hurt criminal prosecutions.\n\nHouse Democrats have been dribbling out pictures from a collection of 95,000 from Epstein’s estate in an effort to pressure the administration to release more of its files. Republicans have accused Democrats of \"cherry-picking\" which documents to release rather than provide a comprehensive view of the investigations.\n\n“We will continue releasing photographs and documents to provide transparency for the American people,” Democratic lawmakers said on social media. “It’s time for the Department of Justice to release the files.”","url":"https://eu.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2025/12/18/new-jeffrey-epstein-released-photos-lolita-passports/87828803007/","image":"https://www.gannett-cdn.com/authoring/authoring-images/2025/12/09/USAT/87684909007-20200702-t-000000-z-452327111-rc-24-lh-9-lo-0-cr-rtrmadp-3-peopleghislainemaxwell.JPG?auto=webp&crop=5131,2886,x0,y258&format=pjpg&width=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-18 17:59:18","author":"Usa Today","authors":["Usa Today"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.191},{"id":387344404,"title":"'Russian army is battle-hardened': Putin issues chilling nuke warning, vows to achieve Ukraine goals","text":"Russian President Vladimir Putin warned Wednesday that Moscow will seek to extend its gains in Ukraine if Kyiv and its Western allies reject the Kremlin’s demands in peace talks.

Kennedy Jr. in a press conference on Thursday, Dec. 18, signed a declaration that says “sex-rejecting procedures are neither safe nor effective treatment for children with gender dysphoria.”\n\nKennedy said that the Department of Health and Human Services is starting an administrative process to prohibit hospitals that provide children with \"sex-rejecting procedures\" from participating in Medicare and Medicaid — a move that would affect virtually every hospital in the United States.\n\nKennedy also said the administration will attempt to stop Medicare from funding \"sex-rejecting procedures,\" a move that could have ripple effects nationwide because commercial insurance companies generally choose what to reimburse based on Medicare's policies.\n\nThe Food and Drug Administration will also send warning letters to 12 manufacturers of breast binders telling them not to market the devices to children, Kennedy said. He said the devices are designed for women recovering from breast cancer surgery, not for children.\n\nThe HHS released a report in May that determined there’s a lack of evidence supporting interventions such as puberty blockers, sex hormones and surgery. The report emphasized their potential risks despite most medical organizations and professionals backing their benefit.\n\n\"So-called gender-affirming care has inflicted lasting physical and psychological care on vulnerable young people,\" Kennedy said. \"This is not medicine. This is malpractice.”\n\nGender-affirming care is a range of social, psychological, behavioral and medical interventions designed to support a person in affirming their gender identity, according to the World Health Organization.\n\nLetitia James, the Democratic attorney general of New York, issued a statement calling the announcement a \"reprehensible\" action that would hurt and isolate adolescents.\n\n“This president would rather target young people than lower costs or expand access to health care,\" she wrote. \"I will use every tool at my disposal to fight this proposal and protect transgender Americans and their families.”\n\nPresident Donald Trump during the 2024 presidential election made opposition to transgender rights a focus of his campaign. \n\nContributing: Adrianna Rodriguez","url":"https://eu.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2025/12/18/transgender-health-care-minors-banned-trump-admin-rules/87826202007/","image":"https://www.gannett-cdn.com/authoring/authoring-images/2025/12/18/USAT/87826552007-20251029-t-172542-z-1610108812-rc-2-tlhah-4-lq-2-rtrmadp-3-usahealthdrugpricing.JPG?auto=webp&crop=6499,3656,x0,y338&format=pjpg&width=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-18 16:30:32","author":"Usa Today","authors":["Usa Today"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.601},{"id":387347436,"title":"Trump administration moves to cut off transgender care for children","text":"WASHINGTON (AP) — The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services on Thursday unveiled a series of regulatory actions designed to block access to gender-affirming care for minors, building on broader Trump administration restrictions targeting transgender Americans.\n\nThe sweeping proposals — the most significant moves this administration has taken so far to restrict the use of puberty blockers, hormone therapy and surgical interventions for transgender children — include cutting off federal Medicaid and Medicare funding from hospitals that provide gender-affirming care to children and prohibiting federal Medicaid dollars from being used to fund such procedures. \n\n“This is not medicine, it is malpractice,” Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. said of gender-affirming procedures in a news conference on Thursday. “Sex-rejecting procedures rob children of their futures.”\n\nThursday’s announcements would imperil access in nearly two dozen states where drug treatments and surgical procedures remain legal and covered by Medicaid, which is funded by federal and state dollars. \n\nThe proposals run counter to the recommendations of major U.S. medical societies. And advocates for transgender children strongly refuted the administration’s claims about gender-affirming care, saying Thursday’s moves would put lives at risk.\n\n“The multitude of efforts we are seeing from federal legislators to strip transgender and nonbinary youth of the health care they need is deeply troubling,” said Rodrigo Heng-Lehtinen, of The Trevor Project, a nonprofit suicide prevention organization for LBGTQ+ youth.\n\nProposed rules would threaten youth gender-affirming care in states where it remains legal \n\nMedicaid programs in slightly less than half of states currently cover gender-affirming care. At least 27 states have adopted laws restricting or banning the care. The Supreme Court’s recent decision upholding Tennessee’s ban means most other state laws are likely to remain in place.\n\nThe proposals announced by Kennedy and his deputies are not final or legally binding. Officials must go through a lengthy rulemaking process, including periods of public comment and document rewrites, before the restrictions become permanent. They are also likely to face legal challenges.\n\nBut the proposed rules will likely further discourage health care providers from offering gender-affirming care to children and many hospitals have already ceased such care in anticipation of federal action.\n\nHannah Edwards, executive director of Transforming Families, a support organization for families of transgender youth in Minnesota, said she expects some patients will still be able to get care at private clinics that don’t participate in Medicaid and Medicare.\n\nBut that won’t be a solution for all kids seeking care.\n\nEdwards has a 15-year-old transgender daughter and said that there’s a growing sense of fear because of federal government actions, even in a state that’s become a destination for families with transgender children.\n\n“The conversation that constantly happens for my family personally is: Where is our red line when we need to flee the country?” she said.\n\nNearly all U.S. hospitals care for patients enrolled in Medicare and Medicaid, the federal government’s largest health plans that cover seniors, people with disabilities and low-income Americans. Losing access to those payments would imperil most U.S. hospitals and medical providers. \n\nThe same funding restrictions would apply to a smaller health plan, the State Children’s Health Insurance Program, when it comes to care for people under the age of 19, according to a federal notice posted Thursday morning.\n\n“This sets a very dangerous precedent for all areas of health care, if the government can cherry-pick one area of medicine to use to withhold necessary funding from entire groups of people,” said Dr. Scott Leibowitz, a psychiatrist and board member for the World Professional Association for Transgender Health. The group develops standards of care for transgender patients globally.\n\nKennedy also announced Thursday that the HHS Office of Civil Rights will propose a rule excluding gender dysphoria from the definition of a disability. Gender dysphoria is a formal medical diagnosis that describes the distress felt when someone’s gender expression does not match their sex assigned at birth.\n\nYoung people who persistently experience gender dysphoria are first evaluated by a team of professionals. Some may try a social transition, involving changing a hairstyle or pronouns. Some may later also receive hormone-blocking drugs that delay puberty, followed by testosterone or estrogen to bring about the desired physical changes sought by patients. Surgery is rare for minors.\n\nMoves contradict advice from medical organizations and transgender advocates\n\nDr. Mehmet Oz, the administrator of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, on Thursday called transgender treatments “a Band-Aid on a much deeper pathology,” and suggested children with gender dysphoria are “confused, lost and need help.” \n\nPolling shows many Americans agree with the administration’s view. An Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research survey conducted in May found that about half of U.S. adults approved of how Trump was handling transgender issues.\n\nChloe Cole, a conservative activist known for speaking about her gender-transition reversal, spoke at the news conference to express appreciation. She said cries for help from her and others in her situation, “have finally been heard.” \n\nBut the approach contradicts the recommendations of most major U.S. medical organizations, including the American Medical Association, which has urged states not to restrict transgender care and services. The American Academy of Pediatrics called on HHS to reverse course Thursday, saying “children and families will bear the consequences.”\n\n“These rules are a baseless intrusion into the patient-physician relationship. Patients, their families, and their physicians—not politicians or government officials —should be the ones to make decisions together about what care is best for them,” said Dr. Susan Kressly, AAP president. \n\nActions build on a larger effort to restrict transgender rights \n\nThe announcements build on a wave of actions President Donald Trump, his administration and Republicans in Congress have taken to target the rights of transgender people nationwide.\n\nOn his first day in office, Trump signed an executive order that declared the federal government would recognize only two immutable sexes: male and female. He also has signed orders barring transgender athletes from participating in girls’ and women’s sports and cutting federal spending for transition-related care, which prompted Thursday’s announcement. \n\nOn Wednesday, a bill that would open transgender health care providers to prison time if they treat people under the age of 18 passed the U.S. House and heads to the Senate. On Thursday, House lawmakers passed a different bill intended to ban Medicaid coverage for gender-affirming care for children. \n\nShastri reported from Milwaukee.

By comparison, between 2017 and this year to date, there had been just over 120 cases filed, according to the Justice Department,” the Times reports:\n\nUnder federal law, people may be denaturalized only if they committed fraud while applying for citizenship, or in a few other narrow circumstances. But the Trump administration has shown a zeal for using every tool at its disposal to target legal and illegal immigrants, leading activists to warn that such a campaign could sweep up people who had made honest mistakes on their citizenship paperwork and sow fear among law-abiding Americans.

We look forward to continuing to work with the Department of Justice to restore integrity to America’s immigration system.” [Emphasis added]\n\nIn a prior interview with Breitbart News, Edlow criticized the Biden administration’s deregulation of the naturalization process, where security questions, for instance, were shortened in order to speed up the process for foreign nationals seeking naturalized American citizenship.\n\nIn fewer than four years, the Biden administration awarded citizenship to almost 3.5 million foreign nationals, which the Migration Policy Institute notes is “by far the most [naturalizations] of any single presidential term.”\n\nFor perspective, the number of foreign nationals who secured citizenship under Biden eclipses those who were awarded citizenship under former Presidents Jimmy Carter, Ronald Reagan, and George H.W. Bush, combined.\n\nEdlow said at the time that there ought not to be quotas set for USCIS adjudicators regarding naturalizations.\n\n“I don’t believe we should have quotas for how many naturalizations we do, how many adjustments we do,” Edlow told Breitbart News. “I want to make sure that the adjudicators are taking the proper amount of time to really screen and vet these individuals to make the determination that they are, in fact, qualified for the benefits that they are applying, including and most importantly, for naturalization.”\n\nJohn Binder is a reporter for Breitbart News.

Here's why","text":"Pope Leo XIV has accepted the resignation of New York's conservative Archbishop Timothy Dolan and named a little-known, pro-migrant bishop from his native Chicago to replace him, the Vatican said Thursday. In a significant shift for the Catholic Church in the United States, Leo replaced Dolan, who stepped down after reaching the Church's retirement age of 75, with Ronald Hicks, a 58-year-old bishop from Illinois.Leo, the first U.S. pope, appointed Bishop Ronald Hicks from Illinois, to replace Dolan as leader of the nation's second-largest Catholic diocese, home to some 2.8 million Church members.Dolan, Archbishop of New York since 2009 and a former president of the U.S. Catholic bishops' conference, offered to resign in February upon turning 75, as required by Church law. Cardinals often serve until 80, the mandatory retirement age.The New York archdiocese is among the largest in the US and the pick ends months of speculation about who would follow Dolan, widely regarded as being close to US President Donald Trump. The New York archdiocese is among the largest in the US and the pick ends months of speculation about who would follow Dolan, widely regarded as being close to US President Donald Trump.This is the most important bishop appointment Leo has made since his election to head up the world's Catholics in May and signals a desire to take a firmer stance on the US administration's decisions, particularly on human rights.Live EventsHicks shares several similarities with Leo including solidarity with migrants, in contrast with Trump's deportation drive.In November, he endorsed a rare statement from the US Conference of Catholic Bishops which heavily criticised the administration's zero-tolerance immigration policies.Hicks spent five years of ministry in El Salvador in Central America, heading a church-run orphanage programme that operated across nine Latin American and Caribbean countries. Leo spent two decades in service in Peru.The outgoing bishop of Joliet, Illinois, also served in several parishes in the Archdiocese of Chicago, the city where Leo was born -- though the pair only met for the first time in 2024.Dolan oversaw the fallout from a major sexual abuse scandal in the diocese. Just a couple of weeks ago, the archdiocese announced the creation of a $300 million fund to compensate victims of sexual abuse who had filed complaints against the Church.At the time, Dolan said that a \"series of very difficult financial decisions\" were made, including layoffs within the archdiocese and a 10-percent reduction of its operating budget.Hicks is no stranger to managing the fallout of the abuse scandal. The Joliet diocese he now leaves was criticised under his predecessors for its handling of paedophile priests.The scandal was \"something that is never going to be behind us\", Hicks told Vatican News.Add as a Reliable and Trusted News Source Add Now!\n (You can now subscribe to our Economic Times WhatsApp channel)\n\nRead More News ontimothy dolanbishop ronald hickscardinal dolan resignationronald hickscardinal timothy dolanwhy did cardinal dolan resignpope leo\n\n(Catch all the US News, UK News, Canada News, International Breaking News Events, and Latest News Updates on The Economic Times.)

Even during World War II, German state assets were not seized, analysts note.\n\nBelgium’s Prime Minister Bart De Wever told parliament on Thursday that he remained deeply concerned about the legal and financial risks, having previously opposed the measures over fears Belgium could be forced to compensate Russia if courts later rule the use of the frozen assets is unlawful.\n\nBelgium is demanding binding commitments from other EU states to cover all potential liabilities, and wants assurances that Russian assets held outside Belgium would also be used.\n\nThe majority of frozen Russian assets in Europe – about $185bn – are held by Euroclear, a Brussels-based financial services company.\n\nSome countries, including Germany and the Netherlands, have said they are prepared to back up the loan, while others, such as Italy and Bulgaria, remain hesitant.\n\nAlthough the plan requires only a qualified majority rather than unanimity, EU officials are keen to secure Belgium’s support. A Belgian vote against the proposal would be politically damaging, given Brussels’s role as the EU’s institutional centre.\n\nRisk of antagonising Russia\n\nRussia’s central bank said on Thursday it would sue European banks in Russian courts over any attempt to use frozen Russian assets to finance Ukraine.\n\nChris Weafer, chief executive of the consultancy Macro-Advisory, told Al Jazeera that Moscow would likely see such a move as the start of a financial war with the EU.\n\n“Moscow is now drawing a line on this issue,” Weafer said, adding that Russia would likely “retaliate based on what Europe does”.\n\nRussia’s central bank has already launched legal proceedings against Euroclear, which holds most of the frozen assets, as well as against institutions in France, Austria and the United Kingdom, Weafer said.\n\nHe added that the EU was unlikely to proceed without Belgium’s backing and that many EU states were increasingly reluctant or financially unable to continue funding Ukraine directly.\n\n“So the EU is desperately looking for an alternative source of money,” Weafer said.\n\nAttacks continue along the front line\n\nInside Ukraine, Russian forces carried out attacks across multiple regions, injuring dozens of people, including in Kryvyi Rih, as well as the Zaporizhia, Cherkasy and Odesa regions.\n\nIn Russia, three people – including two crew members of a cargo vessel – were killed in Ukrainian drone attacks on the port of Rostov-on-Don and the nearby town of Bataysk, according to the regional governor.\n\nRussia shelled Ukraine’s Donetsk region 18 times, killing three residents, Governor Vadym Filashkin said.\n\nUkraine’s acting Energy Minister Artem Nekrasov said Russian attacks overnight cut electricity supplies in five regions, affecting about 180,000 people.\n\nUkrainian shelling in Russian-occupied Kherson killed a 72-year-old woman and injured six others, according to regional Governor Volodymyr Saldo.\n\nHeavy ground and air fighting continues across eastern Ukraine, including around Kupiansk, Lyman and Sloviansk.\n\nUkraine said it shot down 330 drones during what it described as major Russian air attacks, while Russia said its air defences intercepted 47 Ukrainian drones overnight.","url":"https://stvincenttribune.com/eu-summit-on-knife-edge-over-plan-to-fund-ukraine-using-russian-assets/","image":"https://stvincenttribune.com/app/uploads/2025/12/reuters_6943efbd-1766059965-rAVreW.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-18 15:33:00","author":"Cb_usr","authors":["Cb_usr"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"vc","sentiment":0.088},{"id":387344410,"title":"US inflation sees largest monthly decline in 2 years.

US consumer inflation slowed unexpectedly in November, delayed government data showed today although levels remained higher than earlier in the year before President Donald Trump's tariffs flowed through the economy. The consumer price index (CPI) climbed 2.7 percent from a year ago in November, the Department of Labor said, notably below analysts' predictions of a 3.1 percent uptick. The latest figure was also down from the 3.0 percent rise in September, the most recent month for which fuller data was available due to a lengthy government shutdown.Inflation in the US just unexpectedly posted one of the largest monthly declines since 2023, The Kobeissi Letter reported.Consumer Price Index (CPI) ImpactInflation has ticked up this year as Trump slapped new tariffs on goods from US trading partners, causing many firms to flag a hike in business costs. But the impact on consumers has been more muted, as companies rushed to stock up on inventory before steeper import prices kicked in. Many opted not to fully pass on the cost increases.Food prices were 2.6 percent higher from a year ago in November, with the index for meats, poultry, fish and eggs up 4.7 percent over this period.Live EventsEnergy costs also jumped 4.2 percent over the past 12 months.Excluding the volatile food and energy sectors, 'core' CPI was up 2.6 percent in November from a year ago -- still above the Federal Reserve's longer-run target of two percent.CPI Data - What This Means for YouWhat stands out from the data that is in the report is utilities, home furnishings and used cars and trucks are driving some of the ongoing inflation pressures. This is the result of tariff pressures and the AI boom, Heather Long, chief economist at the Navy Federal Credit Union, said.Americans continue to feel the squeeze in their monthly budgets, Long added.These are good numbers, and basically the core rate moving to 2.6 per cent on a year-over-year is really good news, and we saw the top line inflation year-over-year down to 2.7 per cent. So this is good news for the Fed, good news for the markets, and this should begin to perhaps indicate the Fed is likely to be more generous going into the new year. In other words, these numbers, if they stick, will pave the way for not one, but possibly two, rate cuts sometime in the first quarter of 2026, Peter Cardillo, Chief Market Economist, Spartan Capital Securities, New York.FAQsQ1.

He also has demanded that Ukraine withdraw from some areas in eastern Ukraine that Moscow’s forces haven’t captured yet.\n\nThe Kremlin also insists that Ukraine abandon its bid to join NATO and warns that Moscow won’t accept the deployment of any troops from NATO members and will view them as a “legitimate target.”\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has expressed readiness to drop Ukraine’s bid to join the trans-Atlantic alliance if the U.S. and other Western nations give Kyiv security guarantees similar to those offered to NATO members. But Ukraine’s preference remains NATO membership as the best security guarantee to prevent further Russian aggression. \n\nAt the same time, Zelenskyy has rejected Moscow’s demands that it pull back its troops from other areas that Russia hasn’t been able to take by force.\n\nZelenskyy said that Ukrainian officials were expected to hold negotiations in the U.S. on Friday or Saturday.\n\n“We have progress in our dialogue with the American side regarding some of our points, they also speak with Russian side,” Zelenskyy said during a visit to Brussels where EU leaders were set to decide whether to use tens of billions of euros in frozen Russian assets to underwrite a loan to meet Ukraine’s military and financial needs over the next two years.\n\n“We are in the war and United States are decision-makers, who can really stop Putin and I count on this,” Zelenskyy said. “I really count on pressure from United States. Putin does not want to stop this war, but he can if United States will pressure more.”\n\nAs European allies gathered for the high-stakes summit, Russia and Ukraine exchanged more aerial attacks.\n\nUkraine’s air force said that Russia fired 82 drones of various types at Ukraine overnight, 63 of which were intercepted or jammed.\n\nIn Cherkasy, Russian drones that targeted critical infrastructure wounded six people and left parts of the city without electricity, regional administration head Ihor Taburets said. Russian drones also wounded four people in Kryvyi Rih and seven near Odesa, according to local officials.\n\nIn Russia’s Rostov region, three people were killed by Ukrainian drones overnight, including two crew members of a cargo ship that was hit in Rostov-on-Don and another man who died in Bataysk. At least 10 others were wounded, according to local officials.\n\nThe Russian Defense Ministry said that its air defenses intercepted 47 Ukrainian drones overnight.\n\nFollow AP’s coverage of the war in Ukraine at https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine","url":"https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-war-peace-us-plan-miami-dc775dc61aa1e455d32d2213f1ce0a72","image":"https://dims.apnews.com/dims4/default/775a4ce/2147483647/strip/false/crop/6162x4109+0+0/resize/1486x991!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fassets.apnews.com%2Fd1%2F27%2Fc1bf1030953b5bb137374ad15083%2F1d67349e7db2489b9a1f5c764d971745","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-18 15:09:40","author":"Illia Novikov,Matthew Lee","authors":["Illia Novikov","Matthew Lee"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.208},{"id":387345782,"title":"“I Would Stomp Him”: AOC Laughs About Idea of Running Against JD Vance","text":"But, like a shining city on a hill, one president remains above criticism: Ronald Reagan. “Ronald Reagan won the Cold War, and transformed American politics and the Conservative Movement,” the plaque reads. “He was a fan of President Donald J.

Short videos and viral posts suggest the federal government is preparing a last-minute stimulus payment to help Americans cope with rising living costs. For many households still feeling pressure from inflation, rent increases, and higher borrowing costs, the idea of a pre-Christmas deposit sounds reassuring.But a closer look at the facts tells a different story. Despite political speeches and proposals earlier this year, no federal law authorizing a $2,000 stimulus check has been passed. There is also no confirmed payment date, no IRS rollout plan, and no official announcement from Congress or the Treasury. In short, the widely shared claims are not supported by legislative action.Understanding where the rumor started, what Congress has actually discussed, and how to spot payment-related scams is critical. With misinformation spreading rapidly online, financial clarity matters more than ever—especially during the holiday season, when scams peak and household budgets are already stretched.Below is a clear, data-based breakdown of what is real, what is pending, and what Americans should watch out for.The rumor traces back to policy discussions in mid-2025, not to an approved stimulus program. During the summer, President Donald Trump floated the idea of using tariff revenues to support American workers. Shortly after, Senator Josh Hawley introduced the American Worker Rebate Act.Live EventsThe proposal outlined payments of $600 per adult and $600 per dependent child, allowing a family of four to receive up to $2,400. While the figures fueled headlines and online speculation, the bill was referred to a Senate committee and stalled. By November 2025, it had no clear path to passage and lacked bipartisan backing.Is There a $2,000 Stimulus Check in December 2025?No. As of now, there is no approved $2,000 stimulus payment scheduled for December 2025. For any direct deposit to be issued, Congress must pass legislation and the IRS must formally implement it. Neither step has occurred, and no federal agency has announced a rollout plan or eligibility rules.Lawmakers are currently focused on government funding and budget negotiations, not direct cash transfers. Without new legislation, claims of a pre-Christmas payment remain unfounded. Treasury payment calendars and IRS guidance for December also show no stimulus-related activity.In addition, the White House has not requested emergency stimulus funding, which is typically required before any large-scale payment program can move forward. This further reduces the likelihood of a late-year deposit.Capitol Hill’s agenda is centered on avoiding shutdowns, finalizing spending bills, and managing long-term fiscal pressures. Key debates involve discretionary spending caps, defense and domestic funding levels, and debt-related concerns ahead of the new fiscal year.Emergency stimulus programs like those seen during the pandemic are not part of current negotiations. Lawmakers from both parties have emphasized targeted relief over broad cash payments, making a surprise December payment extremely unlikely.With limited time left in the legislative calendar, any new stimulus proposal would face procedural delays even if introduced, pushing potential payments well into 2026 at the earliest.How to Avoid Stimulus and IRS Payment ScamsFederal agencies warn that false payment rumors often lead to fraud, especially during the holidays. The IRS does not send texts, emails, or social media messages announcing surprise deposits or asking for banking details.Legitimate notices arrive only by official U.S. mail, and verified information is published on .gov websites. Any message promising instant payments, early access, or requiring upfront fees should be treated as a scam.Consumers are advised to report suspicious messages to the IRS and the Federal Trade Commission, as scam reports typically rise sharply when viral stimulus rumors spread online.As Christmas 2025 approaches, millions of Americans are searching for answers about a possible $2,000 stimulus check rumored to arrive before the holidays. Social media posts, viral videos, and clickbait headlines claim the IRS is preparing a surprise pre-Christmas payment. Some posts say the money is already approved. Others suggest deposits are “pending” or tied to tariffs, inflation relief, or executive action.But the facts tell a different story.As of mid-December 2025, no federal stimulus check has been approved, authorized, or scheduled for distribution. The U.S. Congress has not passed any legislation approving a new round of direct payments. The IRS and U.S. Treasury have issued no official guidance confirming a $2,000 check. There is also no payment calendar, eligibility list, or enrollment process in place.FAQs:Q: Is the federal government sending a $2,000 stimulus check in December 2025? A: No. There is no approved legislation authorizing a $2,000 stimulus payment. Congress has not passed a bill, and the IRS has not issued any payment schedule. Without formal approval and implementation, no December 2025 deposit is planned.Q: When could a new stimulus payment realistically happen, if approved? A: Any new payment would require a bill to pass both chambers of Congress and be signed into law. The IRS would then need several weeks to set eligibility and distribution. That process makes a 2025 payment timeline highly unlikely.Add as a Reliable and Trusted News Source Add Now!\n (You can now subscribe to our Economic Times WhatsApp channel)\n\nRead More News onIRS $2000 Stimulus Check December 2025$2000 stimulus check December 2025December 2025 paymentsstimulus check rumorsIRS payment schedulehow to avoid payment scams\n\n(Catch all the US News, UK News, Canada News, International Breaking News Events, and Latest News Updates on The Economic Times.)

The move sidelines one of the country’s most recognizable church figures and signals a fresh direction for the influential archdiocese. A relatively little-known Illinois bishop will now step into one of American Catholicism’s most powerful roles.ALSO READ: 40-year mystery solved: Who is Michelle Newton, found alive after decades missing?

Dolan stepped down after reaching the mandatory retirement age of 75, as required under Church law, as per a report by Reuters.Live EventsAlthough cardinals are permitted to serve until age 80, bishops are required to submit their resignation at 75. Dolan, who has led the Archdiocese of New York since 2009, offered to resign in February upon reaching that milestone. Pope Leo’s acceptance of that resignation ended months of speculation over who would be chosen to succeed one of the most prominent voices in American Catholicism.ALSO READ: Quote of the Day by Franz Kafka: 'Start with what is right rather than…'— Top quotes by the Absurdist fiction novelistThe move also sidelines a figure widely regarded as being close to U.S. President Donald Trump.

The diocese is the nation’s second-largest, serving approximately 2.8 million Catholics across Manhattan, the Bronx, Staten Island, and seven counties to the north.\"Hicks represents not just a new chapter for New York but for the American church as a whole,” said David Gibson, a U.S. Church expert, reported Reuters.ALSO READ: Quote of the Day by Sylvia Plath: 'But life is long…' — Top quotes by the poet defined by deathArchbishop-designate Hicks is a native of Illinois and graduated from Niles College of Loyola University in Chicago in 1989. He was ordained into the priesthood five years later and spent much of his early ministry serving parishes in and around the Chicago area, as per a report by AMNY.In January 2015, Hicks became vicar general of the Archdiocese of Chicago under Cardinal Blase Cupich. In 2020, Pope Francis named him the sixth bishop of the Diocese of Joliet, which oversees Catholic parishes across much of suburban Chicago.What is Bishop Ronald Hicks’ background and ministry?Ronald Hicks’ biography shares notable similarities with Pope Leo’s own path. Both men grew up in the south Chicago suburbs and spent years working as missionaries in Latin America.ALSO READ: Quote of the Day by Michael Jackson: 'The greatest education…' — Top quotes by the king of popHicks ministered for five years in Mexico and El Salvador as regional director of Nuestros Pequeños Hermanos, an organization that cares for orphans and abandoned children across nine Latin American and Caribbean nations.

His pastoral work and administrative experience later led to senior leadership roles within the Church, including his appointment as auxiliary bishop and eventually bishop of Joliet.“(Leo) is elevating to the most prominent American see an Illinois native very much like himself,” said Gibson, director of Fordham University’s Center on Religion and Culture, as per a report by Reuters.How does Ronald Hicks align with Pope Leo’s vision?Ronald Hicks is widely seen as a supporter of the reform-minded direction championed by Pope Francis, who led the Church for 12 years until his death in April. Francis sought to make Catholicism more inclusive and attentive to marginalized communities, often drawing resistance from conservative cardinals.Gibson described Hicks as “a soft-spoken Midwesterner who embraces the reformist line of Pope Francis and who is respected by many across the divides in a polarized church.”ALSO READ: \"Mentally unfit,\" Rob Reiner’s past sharp remarks about Trump resurface after his death—here's what Reiner said about the president in the pastHicks has expressed solidarity with migrants, a position that contrasts with Trump’s zero-tolerance immigration policies.

During his tenure, he sought to address shrinking Church membership by embracing the archdiocese’s growing Hispanic Catholic population.A theological conservative firmly opposed to abortion, Dolan also presided over one of the most difficult chapters in the diocese’s history: the fallout from widespread sexual abuse allegations.Just weeks ago, the Archdiocese of New York announced the creation of a $300 million compensation fund for abuse survivors. The fund is intended to address claims filed by approximately 1,300 alleged victims, as per a report by Reuters.At the time, Dolan said a “series of very difficult financial decisions” were required, including staff layoffs, a 10% reduction in the operating budget, and the sale of Church properties.ALSO READ:What Amy Schumer discovered that reportedly ended her marriage overnightDolan remains a prominent public figure, known for his frequent appearances on Fox & Friends and his weekly program on SiriusXM’s The Catholic Channel. He also delivered one of the invocations at Trump’s second inauguration and praised conservative activist Charlie Kirk as a “modern-day St. Paul,” prompting criticism from many Catholics.What challenges await Archbishop-designate Ronald Hicks?One of Hicks’ most immediate and demanding responsibilities will be overseeing the implementation of the abuse settlement fund finalized under Dolan’s leadership. The archdiocese has entered mediation with survivors and is seeking to raise more than $300 million through budget cuts and asset sales, as per a report by The Independent.Hicks is no stranger to managing abuse-related fallout. After he was appointed bishop of Joliet in 2020, the Illinois Catholic Church came under scrutiny following a five-year investigation by the state’s attorney general. The report found that 451 clergy abused 1,997 children between 1950 and 2019.While the investigation acknowledged improved child protection policies under current leadership, it documented cases in which past bishops moved known abusers, dismissed victims, and failed to take responsibility, as per a report by The Independent.ALSO READ: What does 67 mean, who made the 67 meme and why is it so popular?When will Ronald Hicks take office?Cardinal Christophe Pierre, the apostolic nuncio to the United States, will formally install Archbishop-designate Hicks at St. Patrick’s Cathedral on February 6.

(AP) — When the funding for Shannon Johnson’s job as a school mental health counselor came to an abrupt end, two years into a five-year grant, she thought about the work left to be done.\n\nJohnson taught elementary and middle-school students in rural Kentucky how to navigate conflict, build resilience and manage stress and anxiety before a crisis happens. Few districts, especially rural ones, can dedicate a full-time role to early intervention amid a national shortage of mental health staff. \n\nBut the Trump administration discontinued her grant, giving her a sudden end date. So when another job opened in Shelby County Public Schools — this one not reliant on federal grants — she took it.\n\nThe district 30 miles east of Louisville does not plan to fill her former position. Without the federal money, it cannot.\n\nFederal dollars make up roughly 10% of education spending nationally, but the percentage is significantly higher in rural districts, which are not able to raise as much money on property taxes. \n\nWhen the funding is reduced, many districts have no way to make up the lost money. \n\nSince President Donald Trump’s administration began its sweeping examination of federal grants to schools and universities, millions of dollars for programs supporting mental health, academic enrichment and teacher development have been withheld or discontinued. The Republican administration says the grants do not focus on academics and they prop up diversity or inclusion efforts that run counter to White House priorities.\n\nSome grant cancellations have been temporarily paused during legal challenges. But for schools whose states are not fighting Washington’s decisions, there is little relief to be found.\n\nThat is the case in Kentucky. Nine rural school districts that received grants to hire counselors will have to decide whether they can afford to keep them. Already, more than half those counselors have left for other jobs.\n\nTo keep jobs supported by lost grants, schools must make other cuts\n\nFederal money supports school programs for the most disadvantaged students, such as those with disabilities, kids learning the English language and children living in poverty. Some is appropriated by Congress for bipartisan priorities such as reducing barriers to education and improving youth mental health. \n\nIn Shelby County, where federal spending makes up about 18% of schools’ budgets, it also helps pay for teacher development opportunities — a key to staff retention — plus expanded after-school offerings that include tutoring, clubs and transportation. \n\nThe programs are not political, Superintendent Joshua Matthews said, and the funding loss only hurts students.\n\n“I don’t know about everywhere in the country,” Matthews said. “But I can tell you in Shelby County, our teachers show up every day to make for sure that our kids are well taken care of, and we’re not promoting anything one way or the other.” \n\nEven current levels of funding sometimes do not feel like enough, Matthews said. The district could try to use state or local money to help sustain the programs, but at the cost of paying for field trips or keeping class sizes small, he said.\n\nFor the counselors leaving districts that cannot afford to extend their positions, their youth mental health work is left unfinished. \n\n“We had our minds and our goals and our plans really prepped for five-year work,” Johnson said. “We can’t really see a lot of change through systems in a year.”\n\nThe deep uncertainty has required educators to be prepared for an abrupt halt to their work while they look for ways to keep momentum, said Brigitte Blom, president and CEO of the Prichard Committee for Academic Excellence, which administers a federal grant for Shelby County and other school systems in Kentucky to expand engagement with the community and families. \n\n“We have encouraged them to think about sustainability two years sooner than we would have,” she said.\n\nIn December, Blom learned that the administration would discontinue the federal grant.\n\nRural schools have few other places to turn for help\n\nIn Washington County, a rural district south of Shelby County with roughly 1,800 students, the grant helped launch a mentoring program, a career exploration class and expanded after-school academics. Schools with those programs have seen reductions in absenteeism, said Tracy Abell, the district’s community schools director. \n\nAs federal money begins to dwindle, the effects will not be immediate. Superintendent Robin Cochran said it may take years for districts to see the gaps that emerge from programs that end today. Eventually, rural schools run out of options.\n\nWhen larger districts lose funding, they may need to scale back programs. “For us, it means that it goes away,” Cochran said.\n\nShelby County has used funding from the same federal grant to expand its community schools program, seeking out new partnerships with city government and local businesses for more classroom and after-school learning. In Simpsonville, when the city parks department noticed a shortage of fresh vegetables at its farmers market, the district saw an opportunity for Simpsonville Elementary School, just down the street. \n\nThere, students in Katie Strange’s class now learn about agriculture, biology and ecology by growing produce for the market. Strange incorporated the work of the garden — germination, planting and harvesting — into her lessons, while parents and community organizations volunteered supplies and time to build a set of garden beds, funded by the community schools grant. \n\nAlthough deer ate much of the lettuce, Strange said the school cafeteria was able to collect enough leafy greens to serve the students for lunch — a highlight for the kids. In November, long after the growing season had ended, members of the school’s garden club still spoke over each other with rushed excitement, recounting the harvest. \n\nFourth grader Stefan Viljoen explained how they treated the garden with deer repellent and listed out their crops.\n\n“We grew cherry tomatoes, regular tomatoes,” he started to say. \n\n“Cucumbers!” second grader Raylee Longacre interjected. “And we tried to make them into pickles.” \n\n“They didn’t taste too good,” said Savannah Cull, a third grader.\n\nNate Jebsen, the district’s community schools director, said that without dedicated funding for a role like his, the work to pursue such partnerships would fall to administrators who are already stretched thin.\n\nSchools see a difficult path to bringing back grant-funded staff\n\nIn Eminence Independent Schools, just north of Shelby County, Emily Kuhn hopes her district will be able to extend her role as a school counselor beyond the end of this school year, when the money for the position runs out. In her district, with two schools and just under 1,000 students, the grant-funded role came without the administrative tasks most counselors juggle and focused on working with students on their mental health and emotional skills. \n\n“It takes more than one year to build that with people here, because they’re a very tight-knit, small community,” Kuhn said. “I’ve noticed a huge difference this year compared to last, of kids coming in and trusting me.” \n\nThe Ohio Valley Educational Cooperative, which manages the grant that funded Kuhn and Johnson’s jobs, unsuccessfully appealed the administration’s decision to discontinue the funding, said Jason Adkins, chief executive officer. The federal lawsuit filed to challenge the grant’s termination temporarily restored the funding, but only for a subset of districts, not including those in Kentucky. \n\nThis fall, the U.S. Education Department announced it would seek new applicants for the school mental health grants it pulled back. The Ohio Valley cooperative reapplied but was not awarded the new grant, Adkins said. Even if the cooperative had won the money, that would not have helped the staff originally hired. The new guidance limits recipients to hiring school psychologists and not counselors.\n\nIn the initial grants, the organization focused on hiring counselors, in part because of a shortage of psychologists in rural areas, Adkins said. School psychologists require more training and are in high demand in larger, urban districts.
