{"offset":0,"number":50,"available":10403,"news":[{"id":359062976,"title":"Trump gently rebukes Israel for striking US ally in zeal to get Hamas","text":"Donald Trump told the media that he was “not thrilled” and “very unhappy” after Israel’s strike targeting Hamas leadership in Doha, Qatar, but offered only mild condemnation of the attack itself as the United Nations called it a “flagrant” violation of international law.\n\nIsrael confirmed that it struck a target in Doha on Tuesday in an effort to kill Hamas negotiators and leaders. Initial statements from Hamas indicated that only junior members of the militant group were killed.\n\nThe president made his first on-camera remarks about the strike during a gaggle with members of the White House press pool Tuesday evening as he stepped into a swanky D.C. eatery, Joe’s Stone Crab. He’d previously issued a statement on Truth Social, and told reporters that more complete remarks would come on Wednesday.\n\n“I'm not thrilled about the whole situation, not a good situation, but I will say this, we want the hostages back, but we are not thrilled about the way that went down,” said Trump. “I'll be giving a full statement tomorrow, but I will tell you this: I was very unhappy about it. Very unhappy about every aspect; we’ve got to get the hostages back. But I was very unhappy about the way that went down.”\n\nOn Truth Social, the only other tidbit of note was the president’s declaration that he’d informed Qatari leaders that such a strike wouldn’t be carried out again.\n\nBut it’s unclear how Trump will do that, given his total unwillingness thus far to take any noticeable measure to rein in Israel, which remains his administration’s closest political ally in the Middle East. \n\nTuesday’s development likely did more than just figuratively blow up peace talks (less than 48 hours after the U.S. president raised hopes for a deal)-- it also likely killed any lingering momentum for an expansion of the Abraham Accords and could very well set back efforts for normalization of relations around the region for years.\n\nTrump, speaking to reporters on Sunday evening after returning from the U.S. Open, renewed optimism around the idea that a deal could be reached to secure both the return of living Israeli hostages held by Hamas as well as the remains of those killed by the militant group or dead in captivity. He’d threatened on Truth Social that Hamas was facing his “last warning”: accept a deal to end the war, or else.\n\n“I have warned Hamas about the consequences of not accepting,” he posted. “This is my last warning, there will not be another one!”\n\nIsrael’s targeting of Hamas negotiators on Tuesday will once again force the president and his team to answer whether Benjamin Netanyahu and, by extension, his U.S. allies truly support a peace deal. Netanyahu’s government has faced scathing criticisms from families of hostages for focusing on eradicating Hamas and securing territory over securing the return of hostages; it has been months since a ceasefire deal led to the return of 25 hostages in February.\n\nAt Tuesday’s White House press briefing, spokesperson Karoline Leavitt read from an official statement as she condemned the strike as running counter to the interests of both Israel and the United States, while stopping short of any further criticism of the Netanyahu government or insinuating that it was not approaching peace talks in good faith.\n\nHer statement also indicated that the U.S. was now running damage control to protect its relationship with the Qatari government, which Trump and Leavitt both indicated was only notified minutes before the strike took place.\n\nThe president “feels very badly about the location of this attack,” said Leavitt almost apologetically on Tuesday.\n\nTrump “spoke to the Amir and Prime Minister of Qatar and thanked them for their support and friendship to our country,” and “assured them that such a thing will not happen again on their soil,” she continued.\n\nA spokesman for the Foreign Ministry of Qatar, meanwhile, said that the attack “constitutes a blatant violation of all international laws and norms, and poses a serious threat to the security and safety of Qataris and residents in Qatar.”\n\nThe U.S. president’s frustration with the two main focuses of his campaign for a Nobel Peace Prize, the wars in Gaza and Ukraine, could be on the verge of boiling over.\n\nAs the White House issued statements about the Israeli strike on Tuesday, news also broke that the president had reportedly phoned in to a call with European leaders with a startling demand: raise tariffs on India and China to 100% in a move to pressure Vladimir Putin.\n\nThat news broke just hours after another post from the president on Truth Social claimed that the U.S.-India relationship was strong, that Trump would be speaking with Prime Minister Narendra Modi soon, and that trade barriers between the two countries would potentially disappear.","summary":"Qatar, U.N. and U.K.’s Keir Starmer all condemn strike Trump says he ‘feels very badly’ about through a spokesperson","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/trump-qatar-strike-israel-ceasefire-b2823549.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/09/10/0/27/SEI265415407.jpg?width=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/Sj69bXiF-4VHSaSK0.mp4","publish_date":"2025-09-10 00:59:53","author":"John Bowden","authors":["John Bowden"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.468},{"id":359062992,"title":"Israel attacks Hamas leaders in Qatar, Trump says he's 'very unhappy' about strike","text":"SummaryAdds Trump commentsQatar calls Israel treacherousHamas leader's son killed in Israeli attackUS feels badly about location of attack, Trump saysTrump spoke to Israeli leader afterwards\n\nDOHA/DUBAI/WASHINGTON, Sept 9 (Reuters) - Israel attempted to kill the political leaders of Hamas with an airstrike on Qatar on Tuesday, escalating its military action in the Middle East with what the U.S. described as a unilateral attack that does not advance American and Israeli interests.\n\nU.S. President Donald Trump said he was \"very unhappy about every aspect\" of the Israeli strike and would be giving a full statement on the issue on Wednesday.\n\nAdvertisement · Scroll to continue\n\n\"I'm not thrilled about it,\" Trump said as he arrived at a Washington restaurant. \"It's not a good situation but I will say this: We want the hostages back, but we're not thrilled about the way it went down today.\"\n\nWhile Israel defended the attacks as being justified, Qatar said Israel was treacherous and engaged in \"state terrorism.\" Qatari Prime Minister Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman al-Thani said the airstrikes threatened to derail the peace talks Qatar has been mediating between Hamas and Israel.\n\nTrump said he considered hitting Hamas was a worthy goal, but he felt badly that the attack took place in the Gulf Arab state, which is a major non-NATO ally of Washington and where the Palestinian Islamist group has long had its political base.\n\nAdvertisement · Scroll to continue\n\nThe attack drew condemnation from Saudi Arabia, Egypt, the United Arab Emirates and the European Union, and risks derailing Gaza ceasefire talks and Trump's push to achieve a negotiated end to the nearly two-year-old conflict.\n\nQatar is a security partner of the United States and host to al-Udeid Air Base, the largest U.S. military facility in the Middle East. It has acted as a mediator alongside Egypt in talks between Israel and Hamas for a ceasefire in Gaza, which appears to be increasingly elusive.\n\nHamas said five of its members had been killed in the attack, including the son of Hamas's exiled Gaza chief and top negotiator Khalil al-Hayya. It said Israel had failed in what Hamas called an attempt to assassinate the group's ceasefire negotiation team.\n\nThe Trump administration received warning of the attack from the U.S. military just before it took place, Trump said in a statement on social media earlier. He did not say if it was Israel that notified the U.S. military.\n\n\"Unilaterally bombing inside Qatar, a Sovereign Nation and close Ally of the United States, that is working very hard and bravely taking risks with us to broker Peace, does not advance Israel or America's goals,\" Trump wrote. \"However, eliminating Hamas, who have profited off the misery of those living in Gaza, is a worthy goal.\"\n\nHamas political bureau member Suhail al-Hindi told Al Jazeera TV the group's top leadership had survived the Israeli attack. The airstrike followed Israel warning Palestinians to leave Gaza City, an area once home to about a million people, as it tries to destroy what is left of Hamas, which has been decimated by Israel's military since October 2023.\n\nTrump said he directed his envoy Steve Witkoff to warn Qatar the attack was coming but Qatar contradicted those comments, saying that reports that it got a heads-up before the attack were false and the phone call from a U.S. official came when blasts were already being heard in the Qatari capital, Doha.\n\n\"Qatar reserves the right to respond to this blatant attack and will take all necessary measures to respond,\" al-Thani told reporters. Israel killed one member of Qatar's internal security forces in its attack and injured others, Qatar said.\n\nTrump assured the emir of Qatar in a phone call after the attack that \"such a thing will not happen again on their soil.\"\n\nThe U.S. president also spoke with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.\n\nIsraeli officials told Reuters the strike was aimed at top Hamas leaders including Hayya. Israel is still gathering information on the strike and is yet to determine whether any Hamas officials or leaders were killed, a person briefed on the matter told Reuters.\n\nTwo U.S. officials, speaking to Reuters on condition of anonymity, said the U.S. military had been notified by Israel shortly before the strike but there was no coordination with or approval from Washington.\n\nItem 1 of 3 A damaged building, following an Israeli attack on Hamas leaders, according to an Israeli official, in Doha, Qatar, September 9, 2025.

Many countries around the world have warned Israel's plan would spell catastrophe for Palestinians.\n\nThe plan has also provoked concern inside Israel, where public support for the war has wavered. Israel's military leadership has warned Netanyahu against expanding the war, according to Israeli officials.\n\nFamilies of Israeli hostages fear the attack could endanger the captives. Netanyahu says he is acting out of Israel's interest by moving to finish off Hamas in order to safeguard his country against any more attacks.\n\nIsrael has been accused of genocide, including this month by the world's biggest group of genocide scholars, over its nearly two-year campaign in the Palestinian enclave that has killed more than 64,000 people, according to local authorities.\n\nReporting by Andrew Mills in Doha, Jana Choukeir in Dubai and Alex Cornwell, Steven Scheer and Maayan Lubell in Jerusalem, and Jeff Mason in Washington; Additional reporting by Phil Stewart, Idrees Ali, Kanishka Singh and Andrea Shalal in Washington, Writing by Michael Georgy, David Brunnstrom and Jonathan Allen; Editing by William Maclean, Gareth Jones, Nia Williams and Himani Sarkar\n\nPurchase Licensing Rights\n\nJeff MasonThomson ReutersJeff Mason is a White House Correspondent for Reuters.

President Donald Trump said last month that he would not spend the money, invoking disputed authority that was last used by a president roughly 50 years ago.\n\nThe high court order is temporary, though it suggests that the justices will reverse a lower court ruling that withholding the funding was likely illegal. U.S. District Judge Amir Ali ruled last week that Congress would have to approve the decision to withhold the funding.\n\nThe Supreme Court case will continue unfolding, and Roberts asked the plaintiffs to respond to the Trump administration's appeal on Friday.\n\nTrump told House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., in a letter on Aug. 28 that he would not spend $4.9 billion in congressionally approved foreign aid, effectively cutting the budget without going through the legislative branch.\n\nHe used what's known as a pocket rescission. That's when a president submits a request to Congress toward the end of a current budget year to not spend the approved money. The late notice means Congress cannot act on the request in the required 45-day window and the money goes unspent.\n\nThe Trump administration has made deep reductions to foreign aid one of its hallmark policies, despite the relatively meager savings relative to the deficit and possible damage to America's reputation abroad as foreign populations lose access to food supplies and development programs. The administration turned to the high court after a panel of federal appellate judges declined to block Ali's ruling.\n\nJustice Department lawyers told a federal judge last month that another $6.5 billion in aid that had been subject to the freeze would be spent before the end of the fiscal year on Sept. 30.\n\nThe case has been winding its way through the courts for months, and Ali said he understood that his ruling would not be the last word on the matter.\n\n\"This case raises questions of immense legal and practical importance, including whether there is any avenue to test the executive branch's decision not to spend congressionally appropriated funds,\" he wrote.\n\nIn August, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit threw out an earlier injunction Ali had issued to require that the money be spent. But the three-judge panel did not shut down the lawsuit.\n\nAfter Trump issued his rescission notice, the plaintiffs returned to Ali's court and the judge issued the order that's now being challenged.","summary":"Chief Justice John Roberts on Tuesday temporarily kept in place the Trump administration's decision to freeze nearly $5 billion in foreign aid.","url":"https://abc7.com/post/chief-justice-john-roberts-keeps-place-president-donald-trump-funding-freeze-threatens-billions-foreign-aid/17782353/","image":"https://cdn.abcotvs.com/dip/images/17782358_AP25252729918084.jpg?w=1600","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-09-10 00:35:30","author":"Mark Sherman","authors":["Mark Sherman"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.62},{"id":359062592,"title":"Texas A&M ripped by lawmaker after student allegedly removed from class for challenging transgender lesson","text":"A Texas state representative is speaking out after a Texas A&M student was allegedly removed from a class for questioning transgender-related course content.\n\n“After serving under President Trump, I was shocked after I got elected in ‘21 to learn that Texas government might be the biggest funder of DEI and LGBTQ indoctrination in America,” Texas state Rep.

The original Joe's Stone Crab is a Miami Beach staple and was designated a historic landmark in 1975. \n\nAt the D.C. locale, Trump was joined by Vice President J.D. Vance, Secretary of War Pete Hegseth and Secretary of State Marco Rubio. \n\n'But here I am, standing out in the middle of the street,' he told reporters before heading in. 'I wouldn't have done this three months ago, four months ago, I certainly wouldn't have done it a year ago. This is one of the most unsafe cities in the country, now it's as safe as it is in the country.'\n\n'So we're here with Cabinet members having dinner, so everybody should go out,' the president continued. \n\nLast month, Trump announced he was federalizing D.C.'s police and sending in the National Guard to help with crime. \n\nHe has since declared D.C. 'safe' since making the move - one in opposition to most of the District's Democratic residents. \n\n'The restaurants now are booming,' he boasted. 'People are going out to dinner where they didn't go out for years, and it's a safe city. And I just want to thank the National Guard.' \n\nWhile D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser has cooperated with the federal takeover, last week D.C.'s independently elected Attorney General Brian Schwalb filed a lawsuit arguing armed soldiers should not be involved in policing. \n\nTrump has criticized Schwalb's move. \n\nHe commended Bowser to reporters Tuesday night. \n\n'We all worked together and the outcome is really spectacular,' he said. 'We have a capital that's very, very safe.' Last week in the Oval Office, Trump was asked why he had never eaten at a restaurant in D.C. outside of BLT Prime, the steakhouse located inside the former Trump International Hotel, while in office.\n\nDuring his first term, he would motorcade the five blocks and hold court at the restaurant, which overlooked the hotel's grand lobby and bar. \n\n'How do you know? How do you know?' the president pressed the journalist. \n\n A pool of reporters follows the president everywhere he goes, so Trump's moves are well-documented.\n\n'Do you want me to prove you wrong?' Trump asked. \n\nThe president said he was open to the idea. \n\n'I think it's something we could consider doing. Love to do it. I love the White House food, but after a while, I could see going to a nice restaurant. It's safe,' Trump said. \n\nTrump's comments sparked speculation about where the president might be welcome in the liberal city. \n\nDuring the first administration, several of his top aides were heckled and faced protesters at D.C. establishments. \n\nThe choice of Joe's makes sense for its downtown location, politically mixed clientele and Florida origins. \n\nTrump declared himself a Florida resident in 2019, moving his primary address from Trump Tower in New York City to Mar-a-Lago in Palm Beach. \n\nWhile crime statistics show a downtick in D.C., the city's restaurant owners have said they've suffered a drop in business since Trump deployed the National Guard last month.","summary":"President Donald Trump finally voyaged to a restaurant in Washington, D.C. that wasn't his own - choosing to eat dinner Tuesday night at Joe's Seafood, Prime Steak & Stone Crab.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-15082693/trump-washington-dc-restaurant-joes.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/09/10/01/101991339-0-image-a-31_1757463797155.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-09-10 00:26:53","author":"Editor,Nikki Schwab","authors":["Editor","Nikki Schwab"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":0.115},{"id":359062626,"title":"Israel kills dozens in Gaza; Qatar calls Israel’s attack ‘state terror’","text":"As the world’s attention was focused on Israel’s attack on Hamas leaders in Doha, Israeli forces continued their unrelenting bombardment of Gaza, killing more than 50 people on Tuesday.\n\nAmong the dead are nine Palestinians, who had gathered in the enclave’s south seeking aid. Israel pressed on with its offensive in Gaza City after Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu threatened Palestinians to flee to the south for their lives.\n\nThe Wafa news agency reported that a drone strike on a makeshift tent sheltering displaced families at Gaza’s port killed two civilians and injured others. Warplanes also hit several residential buildings, including four homes in the al-Mukhabarat area and the Zidan building northwest of Gaza City, it reported.\n\nAnother house was reportedly bombed in the Talbani neighbourhood of Deir el-Balah in central Gaza, while two young men were killed in an attack on civilians in the az-Zarqa area of Tuffah, northeast of Gaza City.\n\nAl Jazeera’s Sanad fact-checking agency confirmed footage showing an Israeli strike on the Ibn Taymiyyah mosque in Deir el-Balah. The video captured a flash of light before the mosque’s minaret was enveloped in smoke. Despite the blast, the minaret appeared to remain standing.\n\nIsrael issued new evacuation threats on Monday, releasing maps warning Palestinians to leave a highlighted building and nearby tents on Jamal Abdel Nasser Street in Gaza City or face death. It told residents to move to the so-called “humanitarian area” in al-Mawasi, a barren stretch of coast in southern Gaza.\n\nBut al-Mawasi itself has been repeatedly bombed, despite Israel insisting it is a safe zone. At the start of the year, about 115,000 people lived there. Today, aid agencies estimate that more than 800,000 people – nearly a third of Gaza’s population – are crammed into overcrowded makeshift camps.\n\nPhilippe Lazzarini, the chief of the United Nations agency for Palestinian refugees, UNRWA, described al-Mawasi as a vast camp “concentrating hungry Palestinians in despair”.\n\n“There is no safe place in Gaza, let alone a humanitarian zone. Warnings of famine have fallen on deaf ears,” he said.\n\nThe Palestinian Civil Defence warned that “Gaza City is burning, and humanity is being annihilated”.\n\nThe rescue agency said that in just 72 hours, five high-rise towers containing more than 200 apartments were destroyed, leaving thousands of people homeless.\n\nMore than 350 tents sheltering displaced families were also flattened, it added, forcing nearly 7,600 people to sleep in the open, “struggling against death, hunger, and unbearable heat”.\n\nMore than 64,000 Palestinians have been killed, some 20,000 of them children, in the Israeli offensive, which has been dubbed a genocide by numerous scholars and activists. The International Criminal Court has also issued an arrest warrant for Netanyahu for alleged war crimes.\n\n‘The crime of forced displacement’\n\nThe Government Media Office in Gaza said that more than 1.3 million people remain in Gaza City and surrounding areas, despite Israeli attempts to push them south. It described the evacuation orders as an effort to carry out “the crime of forced displacement in violation of all international laws”.\n\nMore than 90 percent of Gaza’s 2.3 million people have been displaced multiple times in 23 months of genocidal war, and an Israeli curb on aid entry, including food items, has led to starvation deaths. Last month, a UN agency declared famine in Gaza, affecting half a million people.\n\nOn Tuesday morning, Palestinians in central Gaza staged a protest against the latest evacuation orders.\n\nReporting from Deir el-Balah, Al Jazeera’s Hind Khoudary said that demonstrators carried banners reading, “We will not leave”, and “Not going out”.\n\n“The primary goal of the [Israeli] occupation is displacement,” said Bajees al-Khalidi, a displaced Palestinian at the protest. “But there’s no place left, not in the south, nor the north. We’ve become completely trapped.”\n\nViolence also flared in the occupied West Bank, where Israeli forces killed two teenagers in the Jenin refugee camp, according to the Wafa news agency.\n\nMourners on Tuesday buried 14-year-old Islam Noah, who was shot while attempting to enter the besieged refugee camp. A funeral was also held for another 14-year-old, Muhammad Alawneh. Two others were wounded in the same incident.\n\nIsrael targets Hamas leaders\n\nIsrael sent missiles at Doha as Hamas leaders were meeting in the Qatari capital for talks on the latest ceasefire proposal from the United States to end the war in Gaza.

The Prime Minister condemned the attack as a “terrorist act” intended to derail ongoing diplomatic efforts and ignite further chaos in the region.\n“Qatar will not tolerate any violation of its sovereignty and territorial integrity, and reserves the right to respond appropriately,” Al-Thani said in a televised statement. He added that the government has assembled a legal team to examine all options for response under international law.\nWhile details about casualties remain limited, Al-Thani confirmed that there were fatalities and injuries from the attack, praising Qatari security forces for their swift and professional response. “Security forces responded immediately to the incident, in which there were dead and wounded,” he noted.\nThe Prime Minister also pushed back against claims by US officials that Qatar had been warned in advance. According to Al-Thani, there was a delay of at least 10 minutes between the time the message was sent and the moment explosions occurred. “By the time the communication reached Qatari authorities, the strike had already begun,” he said, rejecting assertions that the incident could have been avoided.\nDirectly blaming Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Al-Thani accused Israel of deliberately provoking instability. “This attack is a message to the region that there is a rogue actor causing political chaos. Netanyahu is leading the region toward irreversible escalation,” he said.\nAl-Thani further characterised Israel’s actions as violations of both international law and basic moral principles. Referring to the incident as a “betrayal,” he reaffirmed Qatar’s commitment to mediating peace, especially at the request of the US.\nMeanwhile, reports suggest that US President Donald Trump spoke with the Emir of Qatar following the strike. Trump reportedly condemned the attack, expressed solidarity with Doha, and urged Qatar to continue its role in mediating a ceasefire in Gaza.","summary":"The Prime Minister also pushed back against claims by US officials that Qatar had been warned in advance.","url":"https://www.news18.com/world/right-to-respond-qatari-pm-warns-of-measured-retaliation-against-israeli-strike-in-doha-ws-l-9561130.html","image":"https://images.news18.com/ibnlive/uploads/2025/09/Untitled-design-6-2025-09-4b373e30034a00c663201deff7935845.png","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-09-10 00:17:32","author":"New.storytailors,News18,World Desk","authors":["New.storytailors","News18","World Desk"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"in","sentiment":-0.442},{"id":359057208,"title":"Trump Signs Order Targeting Drug Ads On TV—But Stops Short Of Ban RFK Jr. Proposed","text":"President Donald Trump signed an order Tuesday aimed at tightening restrictions on direct-to-consumer drug advertising, expanding his administration’s scrutiny against big pharmaceutical companies and their business practices.\n\nThe order was signed by Trump on Tuesday.

I feel certain that there will be no difficulty in coming to a successful conclusion for both of our Great Countries!” he said. Trump’s comments signal a significant thaw in bilateral relations as ties between the two countries reeled under possibly the worst phase in over two decades amid tensions over tariffs and Delhi’s purchases of Russian oil. Trump has doubled tariffs on Indian goods to a whopping 50 per cent, including a 25 per cent additional duty for India's purchase of Russian crude oil. India described the US action as \"unfair, unjustified and unreasonable\". After months of critical rhetoric against India, Trump had last week said that India and the US have a “special relationship” and there's nothing to worry about as the two countries \"just have moments on occasion”. \"I always will. I'll always be friends with Modi, he’s a great Prime Minister. He's great. I'll always be friends, but I just don't like what he's doing at this particular moment,\" Trump had said in the Oval Office Friday. \"But India and the United States have a special relationship. There's nothing to worry about. We just have moments on occasion,\" Trump said, with a smile. Responding to the comments, Modi on Saturday said that he deeply appreciates Trump's positive assessment of India-US relations. “Deeply appreciate and fully reciprocate President Trump's sentiments and positive assessment of our ties,\" Modi said. \"India and the US have a very positive and forward-looking Comprehensive and Global Strategic Partnership,\" he said. Trump had also said that he is “very disappointed\" that India would be buying so much oil from Russia. “...I've been very disappointed that India would be buying so much oil… from Russia, and I let them know that. We put a very big tariff on India, 50 per cent tariff, very high tariff. I get along very well with Modi, he's great. He was here a couple of months ago,” he said in response to a question on his social media post that the US has lost India and Russia to China. Defending its purchase of Russian crude oil, India has been maintaining that its energy procurement is driven by national interest and market dynamics. India turned to purchasing Russian oil sold at a discount after Western countries imposed sanctions on Moscow and shunned its supplies over its invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. In the Truth Social post, Trump had said that “Looks like we’ve lost India and Russia to deepest, darkest, China. May they have a long and prosperous future together!” Trump had also posted an old photo of Prime Minister Modi with Russian President Vladimir Putin and Chinese leader Xi Jinping. The post came days after the bonhomie among Modi, Xi and Putin at a summit of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) in the Chinese city of Tianjin drew global attention.

It has evacuated tens of thousands of American citizens from Afghanistan. It has been designated a U.S. “major non-NATO ally.” It has even lavished a $400 million jumbo jet on President Donald Trump for use as Air Force One.\n\nNone of that protected this quiet peninsula in the Persian Gulf from coming under an Israeli aerial attack on Tuesday as it mediated U.S.-backed negotiations to end the Israel-Hamas war.\n\nIsrael struck a meeting of Hamas’ exiled political leadership in Qatar’s capital of Doha, sending plumes of smoke and debris rising over a city of air-conditioned World Cup stadiums and luxury malls typically shielded by U.S. interceptor batteries.\n\nSince Hamas’ Oct. 7, 2023, attack on southern Israel ignited its war in Gaza, the Israeli military has targeted Hamas leaders far afield. \n\nBut while Tehran and Beirut were seen as fair game, Israel had refrained from striking Hamas’ political office in Qatar, the key mediator and U.S. ally that Israeli leadership relied on as a back channel to the Palestinian militant group.\n\nOn Tuesday, Israel made a dangerous gamble, analysts say, poisoning Israel-Hamas ceasefire talks, sending political shock waves through the region and raising doubts about historical U.S. security guarantees for its Gulf Arab allies. \n\nIt didn’t immediately pay off for Israel: Hamas claims its senior leadership survived the strike. \n\n“This is a broader shock for the international order, raising questions about sovereignty and the free rein being given to Israel,” said Sanam Vakil, the director of the Middle East and North Africa Program at Chatham House. “The reliability of the United States in the Middle East will be questioned.\" \n\n U.S. knowledge of attack roils its alliance with Qatar \n\nQatar has long come under fire for hosting Hamas and faced rising pressure to evict its top leadership. \n\nBut it was a U.S.-supported arrangement that allowed Hamas to open its political office in Doha in 2012 as Washington sought to establish indirect lines of communication with the Palestinian militant group it designates as a terrorist organization.\n\nHosting Hamas and other armed groups, such as the Taliban, has helped Qatar carve out an influential position in global conflict mediation. Qatari officials believed that the emirate's designation as a major U.S. non-NATO ally and its Al Udeid Air Base, regional headquarters of the U.S. Central Command, lent it security cover that would restrain Israel. \n\nIsraeli strikes shattered that illusion on Tuesday, crashing into central Doha despite all the U.S. missile batteries and radar systems tracking aerial threats from Al Udeid.\n\nThe U.S. said Israel alerted it before striking. Whatever warning the White House said it passed to Qatar was too little, too late: Qatari Foreign Ministry spokesman Majed al-Ansari said his country was only notified as the bombs were falling.\n\n Shock reverberates across Gulf Arab states \n\nThe apparent U.S. disregard for Qatari security and sovereignty rattled nerves across the sheikdoms of the Persian Gulf, which, despite past ideological disputes over Qatar's Islamist sympathies, marshaled a strong show of unity.\n\n“The security of the Arab Gulf states is indivisible, and we stand heart and soul with the sisterly Qatar, condemning the treacherous Israeli attack,” said Anwar Gargash, a diplomatic adviser to the rulers of the United Arab Emirates.\n\nAlthough the U.S. remains the only country willing to station thousands of troops across the Persian Gulf, the perception of Washington as an unreliable ally to Gulf Arab nations has grown in recent years, analysts say. The UAE and Saudi Arabia in particular have sought to diversify their relationships, growing closer to China and Russia.\n\n“They don't want to rely solely on the U.S. for security, they want ties with a range of global actors,” said Will Todman, a senior fellow with the Middle East program at the Washington-based Center for Strategic and International Studies. “(Israel's) strikes will accelerate that trend.” \n\nGulf Arab countries — with small militaries and oil-dependent economies uniquely vulnerable to shocks of any kind — now see Israel’s belligerence as a source of growing concern, even more so than Iran’s.\n\nWhile Emiratis and Saudis view political Islam as a threat and loathe Hamas, experts say they’d prefer a detente with their weakened rivals to the continuation of an ever-widening war that could trigger strikes on their soil.\n\n“The Gulf states are not secretly happy about the strikes on Hamas,” said Vakil. “They see Israel’s continued military activities as destabilizing for the region. Traditionally, Iran was the most serious threat, but now — with Iran weakened but not defeated — it’s Israel they are worried about.\" \n\n Israel's \"Abraham Accords\" thrown into doubt \n\nThat doesn’t bode well for Israel’s ambitions to expand the so-called “Abraham Accords,” which established ties between Israel and four Arab countries, first among them the UAE and Bahrain in 2020. \n\nBefore the Israel-Hamas war, there were signs that regional powerhouse Saudi Arabia might join as well, regarding such an alliance as a bulwark against Iran and its unruly regional proxies.\n\nBut Israel has since pummeled Iran and its allies. Its devastating campaign in Gaza has ignited anger across the Arab world, prompting Saudi Arabia to revive its insistence on Palestinian statehood as a condition for normalizing ties with Israel.\n\nTuesday's strike now dashes any lingering hopes that Israel might have of cozying up to other Arab countries, analysts say.\n\n“For all intents and purposes, normalization is dead for Gulf Arab states today,\" said Dina Esfandiary, the lead Middle East analyst at Bloomberg Economics, a research group. “How do you normalize with the country that’s attacking one of your brothers?”\n\n A ceasefire further out of reach \n\nDoha has been a focal point since the war started for delicate negotiations with Israel to end the fighting and free dozens of Israeli hostages still held captive in Gaza. \n\nThe Hamas leaders targeted in Israel’s attack had been meeting to discuss the Trump administration’s latest ceasefire proposal, which called for Hamas to immediately release the 48 Israeli hostages still in Gaza — 20 of whom are believed to be alive. \n\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, beholden to his far-right political allies, has resisted calls to end the war and planned a new ground offensive to seize Gaza City — an escalation that many fear will doom remaining Israeli hostages and exacerbate a humanitarian crisis for Palestinians.\n\nQatari Prime Minister Shaikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani said he thought it wasn't worth continuing the ceasefire negotiations in light of the attack. Even without killing top Hamas leaders or altering the course of the war, the strike confirmed the worst fears of risk-averse Gulf Arab states, experts said.\n\n“The attack was a message not just to Hamas but to the region,” Vakil said. “Military pressure will continue, with Washington seeing Israeli dominance as effective.”","summary":"The tiny, wealthy Gulf Arab state of Qatar has long hosted the biggest American military base in the Middle East","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/hamas-israeli-middle-east-qatar-donald-trump-b2823539.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/09/09/15/Qatar_Israel_Hamas_13875.jpg?width=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-09-09 23:57:33","author":"Isabel Debre","authors":["Isabel Debre"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.173},{"id":359056802,"title":"Trump having dinner at a restaurant near the White House to promote his Washington crackdown","text":"By WILL WEISSERT\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump is having dinner Tuesday night at a seafood restaurant near the White House, promoting his deployment of the National Guard and federalizing the police force in an effort to crack down on crime in the nation’s capital.\n\nHis motorcade speeding the short distance to Joe’s Seafood, Prime Steak & Stone Crab on 15th Street in the northwestern quadrant of the city follows weeks of the president boasting about mobilizing federal authorities and the military that he says have made Washington “a safe zone.”\n\nSome restaurants have reported drops in reservations since Trump first announced the federal crackdown on Aug. 7, while there have been frequent street protests decrying his actions.

And you know, the way in which, under the guise of a reform process, it really has turned into more of a campaign of retribution and creating fear,” said Burns, who spent decades as a diplomat before becoming a spy. “Fear in the sense of creating a culture that’s about looking over your shoulder and, you know, ‘Should I speak truth to power? Should I convey information very directly that might be contrary to what the policymakers want to hear?'” \n\nBurns warned of a “chilling effect” on CIA employees. \n\n“I have great faith in the integrity of officers who are still serving their analysts and operations officers, and their determination to continue to do that,” Burns added. “But if you continue to take some of the steps which really are about retribution and sowing fear, you can have a very chilling effect on people over time, and that’s something that I think, you know, we have to be really careful about.”\n\nDirector of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard has radically reshaped the intelligence community in the first several months on the job. Gabbard has frequently accused her predecessors in the IC of what Burns is accusing her of doing: politicizing the intelligence community.\n\n“The fact that former CIA Director Burns, and other intelligence bureaucrats, find accountability and transparency ‘chilling’ speaks volumes and is a clear indication of how deeply weaponization and politicization are entrenched in the Intelligence Community’s core,” a DNI spokesperson told the Washington Examiner. “This is exactly the type of rot that DNI Gabbard is working day in and day out to eliminate. Those who abuse their access to our nation’s secrets by weaponizing, politicizing, manipulating, or leaking information should not have access to classified material. It really is that simple.”\n\nIn March, Gabbard revoked security clearances for former Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg, former Secretary of State Antony Blinken, and former national security adviser Jake Sullivan, along with other Biden administration officials. She also revoked the security clearances of the 51 signers of the Hunter Biden laptop “disinformation” letter, though two of them have since died.\n\n“Unfortunately, in my short tenure here, so far, we have already seen too many examples of politicization, weaponization of intelligence throughout our country’s history. We look at where we are now,” she said at the National Conservatism Conference last week.\n\nIn May, Gabbard removed acting National Intelligence Council Chairman Mike Collins and his deputy, Maria Langan-Riekhof, from their posts. Both were holdovers from the Biden administration.\n\nThe Washington Post reported that the Collins and Langan-Riekhof firings came weeks after they wrote an assessment concluding that the Venezuelan government is likely not directing Tren de Aragua members abroad, contradicting the administration’s public stance, though an ODNI spokesperson denied that reporting at the time.\n\n“You are genuinely bad at your job, but that is likely a prerequisite for WaPo. No one from ODNI told you that, so of course you inject your own politically motivated opinion,” Gabbard’s deputy chief of staff, Alexa Henning, said. “That’s wrong, but who cares about facts, right? These Biden holdovers were dismissed because they politicized intelligence. Also, it shouldn’t be lost on you that the leak of classified info was a NIC product, which is against the law; that is the issue.”\n\nGabbard announced in August that the ODNI would undergo a transformation that would reduce personnel by 40% by the end of fiscal 2025 and save taxpayers more than $700 million annually.\n\nThe administration has also removed multiple senior leaders in charge of agencies that work closely with the intelligence community but fall under the Department of War. Secretary of War Pete Hegseth fired Lt. Gen. Jeffrey Kruse, who had served as the director of the Defense Intelligence Agency, last month. \n\nHis dismissal, which was announced without explanation, came weeks after a preliminary assessment from the agency found that the U.S. Air Force’s strikes on three of Iran’s nuclear facilities were less impactful than what President Donald Trump and Hegseth declared. \n\nThe president also fired Gen. Timothy Haugh, the head of the National Security Agency, and his deputy, Wendy Nobel, in April. MAGA-adjacent activist Laura Loomer advocated for Trump to fire them and has continued to identify government officials she claims are trying to sabotage the president’s agenda.\n\nHEGSETH EXHORTS TROOPS IN PUERTO RICO TO PREPARE FOR ‘REAL WORLD’ BATTLE WITH DRUG CARTELS IN CARIBBEAN\n\nIn July, Gabbard referred former President Barack Obama and several of his top aides to the Department of Justice for criminal prosecution, though she stopped short of recommending any specific charges, including treason.\n\nShe accused Obama, former CIA Director John Brennan, and ex-Director of National Intelligence James Clapper of illegally conspiring to fabricate links between Trump and the Russian government.\n\n“There is irrefutable evidence that details how President Barack Obama and his national security team directed the creation of an intelligence community assessment that they knew that was false,” Gabbard claimed then. “The evidence that we have found and that we have released directly point to President Obama leading the manufacturing of this intelligence assessment. There are multiple pieces of evidence and intelligence that confirm that fact.”","summary":"William Burns, the previous Central Intelligence Agency director, accused the Trump administration of enacting &#8220;a campaign of retribution&#8221; under &#8220;the guise of a reform process&#8221; on Tuesday.

A significant strike against the drug lord could potentially wreak havoc in Guadalajara, one of the three main venues hosting international matches. Instead, Mexico plans to enforce a ceasefire during the World Cup. In practical terms, this would mean suspending the search for cartel members provided they maintain peace during the world's biggest sporting event, reports the Mirror . However, the crux of the issue is that any ceasefire relies on the so-called goodwill of the cartels, rather than the government's ability to tackle them. It's not uncommon for the World Cup to be marred by violence, with paramilitary and terrorist groups often exploiting the event. Trump recently commanded a strike on a boat off the Venezuelan coast, with his administration alleging that it was carrying 11 suspected gang members. The legality of this strike has been called into question by several legal experts. The strike is seen as an attempt to provoke Venezuela's dictator, Nicolas Maduro. There's been speculation among some analysts about whether the Trump administration would be willing to instigate regime change in Venezuela. On 18 June 1994, during a World Cup match between Italy and Ireland, authorities discovered the scene of a massacre. The loyalist Ulster Volunteer Force, who wished to remain part of the UK union, stormed into a pub in Loughinisland, County Down, and opened fire. Six civilians were killed and five others injured in the massacre. The pub was known to be frequented by Catholics.

Maura Healey in the general election have come out in “strong support” of a proposal before the Legislature to do away with the state’s cash-free bail system.\n\nThe proposal — An Act relative to eliminating cashless bail — was among the dozens of bills heard the Joint Committee on the Judiciary on Tuesday, though the committee adjourned without anyone offering testimony for or against the idea.\n\nAhead of the hearing, Republican gubernatorial candidate Brian Shortsleeve announced his backing of the bill offered by state Rep. Steven Xiarhos, which he said would help address a revolving-door at Bay State courthouses.\n\n“Massachusetts families deserve to feel safe in their communities. The current cashless bail policies are failing victims, emboldening repeat offenders, and undermining the trust people place in our justice system. It’s time to end this dangerous experiment,” Shortsleeve said.\n\nShortsleeve, a former Baker Administration official, said that making the change is a matter of common sense that gives judges the ability to hold people accountable for returning to court. It’s better for judges to have the option to establish that accountability, according to the Republican, “not to blindly release them without considering the risk to the public.”\n\nHis thoughts were echoed by fellow Baker Administration alum and Republican gubernatorial candidate Mike Kennealy.\n\n“I strongly support Rep. Xiarhos’ efforts to end cashless bail in Massachusetts. Cashless bail protects criminals, fuels repeat offenses, especially in cases like domestic violence, and undermines public safety. It’s reckless policy and only serves offenders, not the communities they harm. Victims deserve protection,” Kennealy said.\n\nTheir endorsement comes after President Donald Trump, in August, signed a pair of executive orders taking aim at the cashless bail practice, which more and more jurisdictions have begun adopting in recent years.\n\nTrump has instructed Attorney General Pam Bondi to develop a list of jurisdictions that have implemented a cashless bail system, which he indicated may put them at risk of losing federal funding.\n\nMassachusetts does not have a true cashless bail system, but judges are supposed to consider if a defendant has the ability to actually pay a bail set, so as not to hold poorer defendants simply because they cannot pay bail. Pretrial release is supposed to be the normal course of action when dealing with non-violent offenses.","summary":"One of the Republicans hoping to challenge Gov.

Democratic Party nominee James Walkinshaw defeated Republican nominee Stewart Whitson in Virginia's left-leaning 11th Congressional District, according to The Associated Press. Walkinshaw will succeed late longtime Democratic Rep. Gerry Connolly, who died in June after a battle with cancer. Heading into Tuesday's special election, Republicans controlled the House 219-212, with three seats controlled by Democrats vacant, as well as one held by the GOP. Walkinshaw's victory in the left-leaning district that Republicans haven't won in nearly two decades further narrows the GOP's fragile House majority. TRUMP NOT ON BALLOT BUT FRONT-AND-CENTER IN 2025 ELECTIONS The district is home to tens of thousands of government workers and contractors, and the federal jobs cuts by Trump's Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) and crime and immigration, transgender policies and even the push to release the Justice Department's files on the late convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein were all in the spotlight on the campaign trail.

They were not told details about the procedure, or did not give their consent.\n\nThe victims described traumatic experiences that left some with feelings of shame as well as physical side effects, ranging from pain and bleeding to serious infections.\n\nThe governments of Denmark and Greenland officially apologized in a statement last month for their roles in the historic mistreatment in an apparent attempt to get ahead of the highly anticipated report. An official apology event in Greenland’s capital is set for Sept. 24.\n\nNearly 150 Inuit women last year sued Denmark and filed compensation claims against its health ministry, saying Danish health authorities violated their human rights. That case remains ongoing.\n\nWhile Tuesday’s report covers the experiences of more than 350 women who came forward to speak to the investigators, Danish authorities say more than 4,000 women and girls — reportedly half the fertile women in Greenland at the time — received IUDs between the 1960s and mid-1970s.\n\nThe alleged purpose was to limit population growth in Greenland by preventing pregnancies. The population on the Arctic island was rapidly increasing at the time because of better living conditions and better health care.\n\nGreenland took over its own health care programs on Jan. 1, 1992.\n\nCenturies of dehumanizing policies\n\nThe investigation’s conclusion comes as Greenland is in the headlines alongside U.S. President Donald Trump, who has repeatedly said he seeks U.S. jurisdiction over Greenland. He has not ruled out a military force to take control of the mineral-rich, strategically located Arctic island.\n\nThe leaders of Denmark and Greenland say the island is not for sale. Denmark’s foreign minister recently summoned the top U.S. diplomat in the country for talks after the main national broadcaster reported that at least three people with connections to Trump have been carrying out covert influence operations in Greenland.\n\nGreenland, which remains part of the Danish realm, was a colony under Denmark’s crown until 1953, when it became a province in the Scandinavian country. In 1979, the island was granted home rule, and 30 years later Greenland became a self-governing entity.\n\nThe forced contraception of Indigenous women and girls was part of centuries of Danish policies that dehumanized Greenlanders and their families.\n\nThe policies included the removal of young Inuit children from their parents to be given to Danish foster families for reeducation and controversial parental competency tests that resulted in the forced separation of Greenlandic families.\n\nThe report’s findings\n\nThe investigators received reports from 354 Greenlandic women who were between 48 and 89 years old when they spoke to authorities for the independent investigation, which began June 1, 2023 following a media outcry.\n\nAlmost all victims were between 12 and 37 years old at the time.

The seat that had been vacant since Rep. Gerry Connolly, who had esophageal cancer, died in May at age 75. Walkinshaw spent a decade as a top aide to Connolly. See live results here Democrats will have 213 representatives in the House once Walkinshaw is sworn in, while Republicans have 219 representatives, with three seats still vacant because of deaths and resignations. A number of key votes loom on the horizon. Walkinshaw could bring Democrats and a handful of Republicans closer to forcing a vote to release all files related to convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. As of last Wednesday, lawmakers were just two members away from being able to force a vote on whether to release the documents. Government funding is also set to expire at the end of the month, another source of conflict in Washington. Walkinshaw faced off against Republican Stewart Whitson, who served in a top role at an advocacy group, for the seat just outside Washington in northern Virginia, which Vice President Kamala Harris carried with about two-thirds of the vote last year. Walkinshaw was Connolly’s chief of staff from 2009 to 2019, and he earned Connolly’s endorsement before he died. Walkinshaw also served on the Fairfax County Board of Supervisors since 2020. “James brings unmatched experience, a depth of knowledge about federal issues, and a steadfast commitment to progressive values,” Connolly said in an endorsement touted by the Walkinshaw campaign. “When I took office in 2009, appointing him Chief of Staff was one of the best decisions I made.” Walkinshaw leaned into criticism of President Donald Trump’s cuts to the federal workforce during his campaign. The district has a particularly high concentration of federal workers. “Federal employees, know that millions of us honor your service and sacrifice,” Walkinshaw wrote on X in August. “I’ll fight to end Trump’s attacks on our nonpartisan civil service and build a government that works for all.” More special elections to fill vacant seats in Congress are on tap for later this year.

Video released on X showed the vessel engulfed in flames, with officials confirming that seven suspected smugglers were detained across three interdictions in one night. The seizure is part of Operation Pacific Viper, a joint US Coast Guard and Navy effort launched in August 2025 to crack down on drug and human smuggling in the Eastern Pacific and Caribbean. Since its launch, the operation has netted more than 76,000 pounds of drugs, including 61,740 pounds of cocaine, marking the largest offload in Coast Guard history at Port Everglades, Florida. Shift to Lethal Force The fiery interdiction followed a more controversial action earlier in the week: a US military strike authorised by President Donald Trump against a suspected Tren de Aragua cartel boat. The attack, described by Secretary of State Marco Rubio as a “lethal strike,” killed 11 individuals aboard a vessel departing Venezuela. This move marks a stark shift in US counter-narcotics operations from traditional interdictions, which prioritise arrests, to outright destruction of cartel vessels. Trump has vowed to “completely destroy” drug cartels, aligning the strategy with his February 2025 executive order that increased trafficking penalties and authorised expanded military action at sea. Rubio reinforced this position, warning that cartels will be targeted “wherever they are.” Military Build-Up in the Caribbean The US has deployed significant military assets to support the campaign: 4,500 troops, seven warships, a nuclear attack submarine, and maritime patrol aircraft, according to reports. Assets include the USS Lake Erie and destroyer USS Jason Dunham. The deployment, described as a “strike force,” is designed to dominate smuggling routes in the Caribbean and Eastern Pacific. The reliance on naval firepower underscores Washington’s intent to project power and deter cartel operations. However, it also risks confrontation with Venezuela, where President Nicolás Maduro denounced the deployments as a “criminal and bloody threat.” Venezuelan Air Force flyovers of US naval vessels have heightened tensions, and Colombia has criticised the lethal strike as “a murder in international waters.” Tren de Aragua: Terrorist Designation and Growing Threat Tren de Aragua, a Venezuelan-origin syndicate, has rapidly grown into a transnational network involved in cocaine trafficking, extortion, and human smuggling. The group was formally designated a foreign terrorist organisation by Washington in February 2025, providing the legal basis for escalated operations. The latest seizure alone—13,000 pounds of cocaine—was valued in the millions and, according to Coast Guard estimates, equates to nearly five million potential lethal doses. Homeland Security officials emphasised the “strategic imperative” of preventing such shipments from reaching US shores.

The lawsuit, which was filed on Tuesday in the United States District Court for the Central District of California, alleged the plaintiffs \"have suffered sex discrimination, including sexual harassment, unsafe and unfair athletic environments, viewpoint discrimination, and infringements on their religious liberty and safety\" as a result of Jurupa Valley rostering the trans athlete. The plaintiffs in the case are current players Alyssa McPherson, Hadeel Hazameh, former player and McPherson's older sister Madison McPherson, and their families. Hazameh and Alyssa McPherson recently withdrew themselves from the team in protest of the trans athlete, they previously told Fox News Digital. The lawsuit alleged that Hazameh and Alyssa McPherson were recently removed from the team group chat after telling their coach they were \"uncomfortable sharing the volleyball court and locker room with a male student.\" The plaintiffs also claimed that the school's practices have violated the girls' religious liberities. READ: EXCLUSIVE: TRANSGENDER ATHLETE AB HERNANDEZ DOMINATES FOR JURUPA VALLEY AGAINST CHAFFEY GIRL'S VOLLEYBALL TEAM \"Plaintiffs have been intimidated by an intentionally hostile environment created by Defendants wherein they were bullied by school officials to censor their objections to competing with, and against, a male and to sharing intimate and private spaces with a male,\" the lawsuit reads. The McPherson family, who identify as practicing Catholics, claimed to \"believe that God created human beings as male and female and that gender is a fixed characteristic that cannot be changed. Their faith informs their understanding of human identity and shapes their views regarding the importance of recognizing and honoring the distinctives of male and female as created by God,\" per court documents. Meanwhile, Hazameha and her family identify as practicing Muslims \"whose religious obligations prevent H.H. from exposing her hair or body to males, including by wearing a hijab. Guided by Islamic teachings, they believe that men and women have distinct biological differences, roles, and responsibilities, which should be respected and upheld,\" per court documents. \"Their faith emphasizes modesty, dignity, and the honoring of gender distinctions which must conform with one’ biological sex in both practice and identity.\" The lawsuit seeks monetary damages and to have the trans athlete, AB Hernandez, removed from the team, claiming the athlete's presence has led other schools to forfeit games to Jurupa Valley this season. So far, four confirmed opponents have forfeited matches to Jurupa Valley amid national scrutiny over Hernandez's participation in girls' sports. READ THE LAWSUIT HERE. (NOTE: There’s salacious parts throughout) Hazameh and Alyssa McPherson competed alongside Hernandez throughout their entire high school volleyball careers. Madison McPherson is a former teammate of Hernandez. But this season, Hernandez's final high school season, opened with widespread controversy after the trans athlete claimed two girls' state championships in track and field last spring. The postseason meets that Hernandez competed in were met with protests by female athletes and their families, who often wore the \"Save Girls Sports\" T-shirts. In the days leading up to Hernandez's state championship victories, President Donald Trump sent a post on Truth Social warning California officials and Governor Gavin Newsom not to allow a trans athlete to compete in the state finals. The CIF amended its policies to reward any female athlete that finished behind Hernandez, but still allowed the trans athlete to compete, and ultimately win the girls' high jump and triple jump, and second place in long jump. The female athletes who finished one spot behind Hernandez shared the podium spots alongside the trans athlete. Then in July, the Department of Justice filed a lawsuit against the CDE and CIF for its policies that have allowed biological males to compete in girls' sports across the state despite Trump signing an executive order in February to prohibit it. That lawsuit is ongoing. Fox News Digital has reached out to the CDE, CIF and JUSD for a response to the lawsuit filed by the McPhersons and Hazameh, but has not received a response. The school district previously provided a statement exclusively to Fox News Digital, suggesting blame for the ongoing controversy involving Hernandez should be directed toward government officials and lawmakers. \"School districts do not write laws for the state of California, nor do they have the power to ignore them or change them. However, as primarily state-funded agencies, they are required to follow them. As these issues play out in our courts and the media, any advocacy on these matters should be directed at state and federal officials elected to make laws and policies that affect public education,\" the statement said. \"We empathize with all students who are impacted by issues beyond their control. JUSD is committed to upholding the law, which prohibits discrimination on the basis of, among other characteristics, gender, gender identity, gender expression and sexual orientation in any program or activity, ensuring that all pupils feel safe, supported and affirmed for who they are at school.\"A bipartisan survey by the Public Policy Institute of California found a majority of California residents oppose biological male trans athletes competing in women's sports. That figure included more than 70% of the state's school parents. \"Most Californians support requiring transgender athletes to compete on teams matching the sex they were assigned at birth,\" the poll stated. \"Solid majorities of adults (65%) and likely voters (64%) support requiring that transgender athletes compete on teams that match the sex they were assigned at birth, not the gender they identify with. An overwhelming majority of public school parents (71%) support such a requirement.\" Follow Fox News Digital’s sports coverage on X, and subscribe to the Fox News Sports Huddle newsletter.","summary":"","url":"https://www.outkick.com/sports/california-girls-high-school-volleyball-players-file-lawsuit-over-transgender-teammate","image":"https://static.outkick.com/www.outkick.com/content/uploads/2025/09/ab-hernandez.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-09-09 23:30:34","author":"Jackson Thompson","authors":["Jackson Thompson"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.328},{"id":359057242,"title":"Letters: AB 715 would stifle speech in classrooms","text":"Bill aims to stifle\nspeech in classrooms\n\nRe: “California must make schools safer for Jews” (Page A8, Sept. 7).\n\nDaniel Klein claims AB 715 will make California public schools safer for Jewish students.

As has been pointed out, Republican led cities such as Memphis, Tennessee, have a higher crime rate than Washington, D.C.\n\nNo, it was simply a show of force and the first step toward normalizing the presence of armed forces in American cities.\n\nBirth rates aren’t\nin favor of liberals\n\nMost East Bay Times readers likely already know that overall birth rates are falling and are now lower than the “replacement” rate in the United States and in most developed countries around the world.\n\nA fascinating article in the Financial Times of London, however, broke down U.S. Census data from 1980 through 2024 in a different way, and it discovered that birth rates among women self-identifying as “conservative” are above replacement rate, while birth rates among women identifying as “progressive” are below replacement rate. This split in birth rates is true not only for the U.S. but in most European countries as well.\n\nIn other words, it’s mainly liberal women who aren’t with the baby program.

Billions of animals are trapped in cages or barns, often killed painfully, just to produce cheap meat. According to the United Nations, factory farming also produces about 14.5% of global greenhouse gas emissions, making it a major driver of climate change. It pollutes water, destroys forests and harms nearby communities.\n\nI care about this because it hurts both animals and the planet.

The court swiftly acted after the administration last week asked it to review the case, which implicates trillions of dollars in customs duties over the next decade.\n\nThe court, which begins its next nine-month term on Oct 6, placed the case on a fast track, scheduling oral arguments for the first week of November.\n\nThe US Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit in Washington ruled on Aug 29 that Trump overreached in invoking a 1977 law known as the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, or IEEPA, to impose the tariffs, undercutting a major priority for the president in his second term. The tariffs, however, remain in effect during the appeal to the Supreme Court.\n\nThe appeals court ruling stems from two challenges. One was brought by five small businesses that import goods, including a New York wine and spirits importer and a Pennsylvania-based sport fishing retailer. The other was filed by 12 US states - Arizona, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Maine, Minnesota, Nevada, New Mexico, New York, Oregon and Vermont - most of them governed by Democrats.\n\nThe Supreme Court also agreed to hear a separate challenge to Trump's tariffs brought by a family-owned toy company, Learning Resources.\n\nThe levies are part of a global trade war instigated by Trump since he returned to the presidency in January that has alienated trading partners, increased volatility in financial markets and fueled global economic uncertainty.\n\nTrump has made tariffs a key foreign policy tool, using them to renegotiate trade deals, extract concessions and exert political pressure on other countries. Trump in April invoked the 1977 law in imposing tariffs on goods imported from individual countries to address trade deficits, as well as separate tariffs announced in February as economic leverage on China, Canada and Mexico to curb the trafficking of fentanyl and illicit drugs into the US.\n\nThe law gives the president power to deal with \"an unusual and extraordinary threat\" amid a national emergency. It historically had been used for imposing sanctions on enemies or freezing their assets. Prior to Trump, the law had never been used to impose tariffs.\n\n\"The fact of the matter is that President Trump has acted lawfully by using the tariff powers granted to him by Congress in IEEPA to deal with national emergencies and to safeguard our national security and economy. We look forward to ultimate victory on this matter with the Supreme Court,\" White House spokesperson Kush Desai said.\n\nJeffrey Schwab, a lawyer with the Liberty Justice Center legal group representing small business challengers to Trump's tariffs, said he is confident that the Supreme Court will recognise that the president does not have unilateral tariff power under this law.\n\n\"Congress, not the president alone, has the constitutional power to impose tariffs,\" Schwab said.","summary":"","url":"https://www.channelnewsasia.com/world/us-supreme-court-decide-legality-trump-tariff-5340941","image":"https://dam.mediacorp.sg/image/upload/s--iBBccg8K--/c_fill,g_auto,h_338,w_600/fl_relative,g_south_east,l_mediacorp:cna:watermark:2024-04:reuters_1,w_0.1/f_auto,q_auto/v1/one-cms/core/2025-09-09T203238Z_1_LYNXNPEL8810X_RTROPTP_3_USA-TRUMP.JPG?itok=NamSYNqx","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-09-09 23:29:00","author":null,"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"sg","sentiment":0.252},{"id":359062630,"title":"Israeli-Russian researcher freed in Iraq after two years in captivity","text":"Israeli-Russian academic and Princeton University student Elizabeth Tsurkov has been freed in Iraq after spending more than two years in the custody of an Iraqi armed group, US President Donald Trump has announced.\n\n“I am pleased to report that Elizabeth Tsurkov, a Princeton Student, whose sister is an American Citizen, was just released by Kata’ib Hezbollah (MILITANT Hezbollah), and is now safely in the American Embassy in Iraq after being tortured for many months. I will always fight for JUSTICE, and never give up. HAMAS, RELEASE THE HOSTAGES, NOW!” Trump posted on TruthSocial on Tuesday, referring at the end to the captives held in Gaza, who were taken from Israel during Hamas’s October 7, 2023, attack.\n\nKataib Hezbollah, which is a separate entity from the armed group Hezbollah in Lebanon, is part of Iraq’s security apparatus under the umbrella of the state-funded Popular Mobilisation Forces (PMF), a Shia paramilitary dominated by Iran-backed armed groups.\n\nTsurkov, who was accused of being a spy, disappeared in Baghdad in March 2023, while conducting academic research. She was last seen in the Karrada district before reports surfaced that Kata’ib Hezbollah had abducted her. Her case remained secret for months until Israel’s prime minister’s office confirmed in July 2023 that she had been abducted. It said the Iraqi government was responsible for her safety.\n\nThe 37-year-old holds both Israeli and Russian passports and had entered Iraq on her Russian travel documents, according to Israeli authorities.\n\nIraqi Prime Minister Mohammed Shia al-Sudani confirmed that Tsurkov had been released and said, “We reaffirm, once again, that we will not tolerate any compromise in enforcing the law and upholding the authority of the state, nor will we allow anyone to undermine the reputation of Iraq and its people.”\n\nIn November 2023, Iraqi state television aired footage of Tsurkov in which she claimed to be working for both Mossad and the CIA, allegations her family rejected as coerced confessions.\n\nThe precise terms of her release remain unclear. Earlier this year, reports suggested that Washington and Baghdad were engaged in negotiations over her case.\n\nThere were reports of a possible deal for the release of Tsurkov in January.\n\nAfter Trump’s announcement, her sister Emma Tsurkov, who has campaigned publicly for her freedom, expressed relief in a post on X.\n\n“My entire family is incredibly happy. We cannot wait to see Elizabeth and give her all the love we have been waiting to share for 903 days. We are so thankful to President Trump and his Special Envoy, Adam Boehler. If Adam had not made my sister’s return his personal mission, I do not know where we would be,” she wrote.\n\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu also confirmed her release, crediting months of work led by Gal Hirsch, Israel’s coordinator for captives and missing people. “Through a team effort … after great efforts, we succeeded in bringing about her release,” Netanyahu said.","summary":"US President Trump confirms Elizabeth Tsurkov freed after being held by Iraqi group amid spy claims.","url":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/9/9/israeli-russian-researcher-freed-in-iraq-after-two-years-in-captivity?traffic_source=rss","image":"https://www.aljazeera.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/000_33MU7ML-1757455906.jpg?resize=1200%2C675","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-09-09 23:28:09","author":"Al Jazeera,Apps Support","authors":["Al Jazeera","Apps Support"],"language":"en","source_country":"QA","sentiment":-0.134},{"id":359057424,"title":"The subpoenaed Epstein files: Everything we know about latest release, including 50th birthday book with ‘Trump sketch’","text":"A trove of documents from the investigation into late pedophile Jeffrey Epstein was released Monday by a congressional committee. \n\nThe bombshell document drop included a 238-page book compiled for Epstein’s 50th birthday in 2003, with dozens of contributions from the disgraced financier’s rich and powerful friends, along with “girl-friends.” Among the biggest revelations was a sexually suggestive hand-drawn naked woman and cryptic message, allegedly by President Donald Trump. Epstein’s last will and testament, and lengthy address book were also released.\n\nThe documents were made public by the House Oversight Committee, after it subpoenaed Epstein’s estate last month, amid ongoing outcry over the Trump administration’s failure to keep a promise made by the president and release all the files related to the case. \n\nEpstein, 66, died by suicide in a New York City jail cell in 2019 while awaiting trial on sex trafficking charges involving abuse of girls as young as 14. Epstein was previously arrested and charged with soliciting prostitution in Florida in 2006. The charge sparked a federal investigation, but Epstein struck a plea deal that protected him from further charges. In exchange, he pleaded guilty to state charges and registered as a sex offender.\n\nEpstein’s former girlfriend, Ghislaine Maxwell, was convicted in connection with the sex trafficking investigation in 2021. She is serving 20 years after being found guilty on several charges, including sex trafficking of a minor.\n\nThe document dump comes as:\n\nEpstein’s 50th birthday book, from 2003, includes a letter that is allegedly signed by Trump. \n\nThe note describes an imagined conversation between Trump and Epstein, framed by a sketched outline of a woman’s torso and breasts. The text reads like a script, detailing a cryptic, imagined conversation between “Donald” and “Jeffrey.” It begins with a “Voice Over” that says: “There must be more to life than having everything.” \n\n“Happy Birthday—and may every day be another wonderful secret,” the letter concludes.\n\nThe letter is signed “Donald,” in the sketched woman’s pubic area. It appears to have been written in thick black marker with angular letters and a long trail after the last “D.”\n\nContemporaneous, authenticated letters from Trump, such as a note he sent to Larry King in 1999, have signatures that appear similar.\n\nThe Wall Street Journal first reported on the letter in July, prompting a vehement denial from the president who said he “never wrote a picture.” Trump filed a $10 billion defamation lawsuit against the paper, its publisher and owner, Rupert Murdoch.\n\nIn a statement on X, White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt wrote that “this entire ‘Birthday Card’ story is false.”\n\n“As I have said all along, it’s very clear President Trump did not draw this picture, and he did not sign it,” she wrote. “President Trump’s legal team will continue to aggressively pursue litigation.”\n\nOn another page, Trump’s name appears in a photo, as the signature - “D J TRUMP” - on a giant check for $22,500 being held by Epstein and two other men, who are smiling at the camera. A fourth person, whose face has been blacked-out, is also holding onto the check.\n\nThe photo is captioned: “Jeffrey showing early talents with money + women! Sells ‘fully depreciated’ [redacted] to Donald Trump for $22,500. Showed early ‘people skills’ too. Even though I handled the deal I didn’t get any of the money on the girl!”\n\nIn a section titled “Assistants,” one note also names Trump alongside several other famous people that the writer claimed to have encountered after meeting Epstein. Others named include Prince Andrew, Naomi Campbell and Michael Jackson.\n\nTrump was friends with Epstein in the Nineties and early 2000s, once calling him a “terrific guy.” The pair were pictured partying together at glamorous events in Palm Beach and New York. However, they fell out and Trump barred Epstein from his Mar-a-Lago estate in 2007.\n\nTrump has not been accused of any wrongdoing related to the Epstein case.\n\nThe birthday book contains several contributions from high-profile people, listed in the “friends” section of the contents page. The list includes Trump, former President Bill Clinton, and Peter Mandelson, the British Ambassador to the U.S. \n\nOne message signed “Bill Clinton,” describes Epstein as having “childlike curiosity.”\n\nThe note reads: “It’s reassuring, isn’t it, to have lasted as long, across all the years of learning and knowing, adventures and [illegible word], and also to have your childlike curiosity, the drive to make a difference and the solace of friends.”\n\nA contribution, attributed to Mandelson, includes a collection of photos, such as shots of a tropical island and a yellow parachute gliding through the air. Mandelson included a photo of himself wrapped in a towel or robe, speaking to Epstein outdoors on a porch. \n\nThere is also note for Epstein, which praises him as an “intelligent” and “sharp-witted man.” \n\nIt concludes: “But wherever he is in the world, he remains my best pal! Happy Birthday, Jeffrey. We love you!!” \n\nAnother submission includes a hand-drawn cartoon of Epstein, which is unsigned. The sketch is of a man handing a lollipop and balloons to three girls, with a caption which reads: “1983.” \n\nIt also includes a man, who resembles Epstein, lounging on a beach and receiving a massage from several women, one of whom has the initials “J.E.” tattooed on her body. A jet is seen flying in the background. The caption reads: “2003 what a great country!”\n\nThe book also features a poem, signed by “Stuey”. The table of contents suggests this could be a submission from Stuart Pivar, an art collector and scientist. \n\n“Jeffrey at half century, with credentials plenipotentiary, though up to no good whenever he could, has avoided the penitentiary,” the poem reads, in part.\n\nOther sections are titled “Family,” “Brooklyn,” “Science,” and “Business.” The “Family” section includes several old photos of Epstein and his relatives, including a portrait that appears to show Epstein and his younger brother Mark as children. \n\nThe “Brooklyn” section has photos of Epstein, who was raised in Coney Island, throughout his childhood and as a young man. One photo shows two boys, who may be Epstein and his brother, with an elderly relative. Another shows a young boy holding an accordion and a small guitar. Epstein played the accordion as a child, according to other entries in the birthday book.\n\nThis section includes a note titled: “Girls On My Boat.” The handwritten note reads: “We picked up girls on beach—went out on boat. I tell them with knife in my hand to take suits off.” It’s unclear who wrote it.\n\nAnother letter, signed by “Johnny Boy”, and written on a letterhead that reads “Johnny Boy Kafka,” includes a sexually explicit story about how Epstein’s parents conceived him. The letter goes on to recount stories from the writer’s youth involving Epstein, including a trip to Europe.\n\nThe “Science” section features contributions from at least five people and includes several references to mathematics.\n\nThe first entry is a handwritten note signed by Gerry Edelman, a Nobel Prize-winning scientist who died in 2014.\n\nThe first sentence reads: “On this occasion, I am reminded of our many conversations, fueled by both your curiosity and your skepticism.” \n\nAnother note features a diagram titled “Jeffrey E.” accompanied by a caption praising his “intellect.” \n\nThe note references Marvin Minsky, a renowned cognitive and computer scientist, who died in 2016. The note’s signature is redacted.\n\nThe “Business” section includes a letter signed “Ace Greenberg,” who served as CEO of the investment bank Bear Stearns when Epstein worked there in the 1970s. He died in 2014.\n\n“Working with Jeffrey has been a pleasure and watching his meteoric success has given me many vicarious thrills,” the note reads.\n\nThe book includes a section titled “girlfriends”, and another titled “girl-friends.” \n\nThe names and faces of women in both sections are redacted. Attorneys for Epstein’s estate redacted the names and photos of women and children who appeared in the book to protect any potential victims’ identities, according to a letter to the House Oversight Committee, reviewed by The New York Times.\n\nOne letter in the “girlfriends” section is from an unknown person who recalled that Epstein tutored her in high school math, and that they ran into each other years later, after college. The letter’s signature is redacted.\n\n“​​From lessons in algebra to lessons in life, the lessons l've learned from you during the past 35 years haven't always been easy or even ones that I would have chosen to learn, but they were always important,” the letter reads. \n\nOther contributions in the “girlfriends” section included old photos of Epstein, notes about classmates and musical scores.\n\nThe “girl-friends” section is far more explicit. The section includes handwritten notes from women, including one that recounts meeting Epstein in 1985. \n\n“I have loved most every minute I’ve had knowing you these past years,” the note reads.\n\nIt also features a collage of photographs, featuring dozens of photos of women whose faces are redacted. Some are pictured with Epstein, while others are seen alone in bathing suits or posing for the camera. \n\nAnother note from an unknown individual recounts how she met Epstein through Maxwell.\n\n“I received a call from Ghislaine, who I had worked on (massaged) twice in the last few months, to work on her ‘employer,’” the note reads.\n\n“‘He is a business man and wants you to work on his feet at his desk,’ she said. My first thought was, ‘Corns and bunions and a curmudgeon of a man.’”\n\nMaxwell compiled the book, and she wrote both the prologue and final note.\n\n“Jeffrey, the idea behind the book was simply to gather stories and old photographs to jog your memory about places and people and different events,” the prologue reads.\n\nThe note concludes: “I know you will enjoy looking through the book, and I hope you will derive as much pleasure looking through it as I did putting it together for you. Happy Happy Birthday. Love, Ghislaine.”\n\nThe book’s final pages are titled “The Next Fifty Years.” The last note, signed by Maxwell, reads: “To the next fifty years. ‘Know when you are winning.’ The next fifty years will be even more wonderful.” \n\nIncluded with the note is a photo of Epstein in a hammock and another image of a placard that says: “Know when you are winning.” \n\nEpstein’s last will and testament from 2019 was also released. In the document, Epstein identified himself as a resident of St. Thomas, U.S. Virgin Islands. \n\nHis executors are Darren K. Indyke and Richard D. Kahn. Indyke was Epstein’s former personal attorney, while Kahn formerly worked as Epstein’s accountant, according to Reuters. \n\nThe will was signed on January 18, 2019, two days before Epstein’s 66th birthday. Epstein died months later, on August 10. \n\nEpstein’s estate also released his non-prosecution agreement with Florida prosecutors.\n\nIt was signed in September 2007 by the financier, Epstein’s attorney, Lilly Ann Sanchez, and an assistant U.S. attorney for the Southern District of Florida.\n\nThe agreement required Epstein to plead guilty to two state charges, and specified he could not enter a “nolo contendere” plea. This plea allows defendants to accept a conviction and subsequent sentence without admitting guilt. \n\nIn June 2008, he pleaded guilty to state charges of soliciting prostitution and soliciting prostitution from a minor in Florida. He was sentenced to 18 months in a minimum-security facility and registered as a sex offender.\n\nEpstein’s address book and contact list contains hundreds of names. Certain entries were circled, including several titled “Massage” alongside locations like “Paris” and “Island.” Some names were also circled, including high-profile attorney Alan Dershowitz and retail billionaire Les Wexner.\n\nTrump’s late ex-wife, Ivana, appears on the list, as well as their daughter, Ivanka.","summary":"Lawmakers released a trove of Epstein-related documents including a book that celebrated his 50th birthday in 2003 with contributions from Ghislaine Maxwell, Bill Clinton - and allegedly Donald Trump","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/epstein-birthday-book-trump-note-b2823328.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/09/09/17/18/Screenshot-2025-09-09-at-1-08-25-PM.png?width=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/Ybl1TFET-4VHSaSK0.mp4","publish_date":"2025-09-09 23:27:23","author":"Katie Hawkinson","authors":["Katie Hawkinson"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.202},{"id":359050820,"title":"Meta CFO explains CEO Mark Zuckerberg's $600 billion White House pledge","text":"Imagine your boss goes to the White House and says your company will spend $600 billion in the US through 2028.

But some of the members of the committee don’t want to talk about the card that Trump is alleged to have signed and sent. \n\n“I am so goddamn sick of being asked about a f*****g birthday card,” Rep. Nancy Mace (R-S.C.) told The Independent on Tuesday. \n\n“Give me a break. What about the women who've been fighting for justice for 30 years and still don't have it? How does writing about a birthday card do anything to get them justice? It doesn't.”\n\nMace is one of only three Republicans who co-signed a discharge petition to release files related to Epstein. She did so after she met with victims of Epstein who visited Capitol Hill last week and was moved to tears. \n\nMace, who is running for governor of South Carolina — and who could use Trump’s endorsement to win the primary — has been careful not to say the president was at fault for any of Epstein’s wrongdoing.\n\n“Donald Trump is the one who banned Jeffrey Epstein from Mar-a-Lago,” she told The Independent last week. “He was an FBI informant, and he talked to the feds to get this guy turned over. So Donald Trump is a hero in this.”\n\nLater, House Speaker Mike Johnson would repeat that Trump was an informant, though little to no evidence exists that this was the case and the White House has said Johnson misspoke. Johnson would later clarify his remarks. \n\nRepublicans have sought to balance the anger that their base has felt at the lack of transparency surrounding Epstein’s operations, subsequent arrest and his eventual death. In July, the Justice Department and FBI released a two-page memo saying no “client list” of Epstein’s patrons existed and that the disgraced financier who long escaped justice likely killed himself in his prison cell. \n\nPresident Donald Trump has also called the investigation a “hoax” by Democrats, even though survivors of Epstein’s came to Capitol Hill asking for the files to be released. Trump also denied reports from The Wall Street Journal that he sent a note to Epstein that featured a doodle of a woman’s naked body that featured his signature mimicking a woman’s pubic hair.\n\nRep. Anna Paulina Luna (R-Fla.) focused on another one of Epstein’s famous friends who occupied the White House. \n\n“I also saw a very interesting one from Bill Clinton,” she told The Independent. “But I know the White House has been refuting that with the signatures, and it looks like the signatures don't match.”\n\nThe committee published a note Clinton sent in the infamous “birthday book” on Monday. The note remarked on Epstein’s “childlike curiosity.” \n\nRep. Ralph Norman, who is running against Mace in the Republican primary for governor, said he had not seen it. \n\n“I have not,” he told The Independent. “I’m sure the president will report on it.” \n\nFellow House Freedom Caucus member Rep. Andy Biggs of Arizona said he wanted to see more. \n\n“I haven’t been able to see all of them yet,” he told The Independent. When asked about the supposed Trump card, he said “that’s primarily what I want to see.” \n\nAfter the story initially published in July, Trump sued The Wall Street Journal, the paper’s parent company News Corps and its owner Ruper Murdoch for defamation.\n\n“I would say that the White House has gone forward and President Trump has a defamation case currently alleging that that card is not real, and I'm inclined to believe that he's not, you know, playing to lose that case,” Luna said. \n\nTrump and House Speaker Mike Johnson have opposed efforts from Khanna and Massie to release the files. The petition needs a majority of members to sign to receive a floor vote. Along with Massie and Mace, only two Republicans–Reps. Lauren Bobert of Colorado and Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia–have co-signed while almost every Democrat has signed the petition. \n\nHouse Oversight Committee Chairman told The Independent he planned to focus on financial transactions. \n\n“Those aren’t important items of evidence,” Comer said of the notes from Trump and Clinton. “None of the women have implicated with Trump or Clinton.”\n\nComer said that Ghislaine Maxwell, Epstein’s former partner and longtime associate, told Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche that she never saw Trump do anything inappropriate. \n\nBut the investigation is unlikely to go away for the time being. \n\n“They’re clearly lying,” Rep. Robert Garcia, the top Democrat on the Oversight Committee, told The Independent, calling Republicans’ behavior “shameful.” \n\nOn Tuesday, Virginia will hold a special election for the late Rep. Gerry Connolly’s old seat that will likely be filled by a Democrat, most assuredly giving the discharge petition another signature. Later in the month, Arizona will hold another special election to fill the seat of the late Raúl Grijalva, which will notch another signature.","summary":"From Bill Clinton to feigning ignorance, Republicans would rather not talk about the birthday card","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/republican-epstein-birthday-card-nancy-mace-b2823532.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/02/12/19/50/GettyImages-2153410444.jpg?width=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/VLnzfDgN-4VHSaSK0.mp4","publish_date":"2025-09-09 23:25:11","author":"Eric Garcia","authors":["Eric Garcia"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.316},{"id":359056638,"title":"Will Trump’s Tariffs Be Ruled Illegal? US Supreme Court Sets Urgent Hearing In November","text":"The US Supreme Court on Tuesday granted President Donald Trump’s request to fast-track a high-stakes appeal over the legality of tariffs imposed during his administration, according to a report by AFP.\nThe decision marks a significant development in a legal battle that could ultimately impact hundreds of billions of dollars in government revenue. The court agreed to hear oral arguments in the first week of November and has allotted one hour for the session. Notably, the case will proceed on an expedited timeline, a rare move underscoring its national importance. In the meantime, the tariffs will remain in place while the court hears the case.\nAt the centre of the case are “reciprocal tariffs” introduced by Trump on April 2, which include a 10% baseline tariff on imports from various countries, with some duties climbing as high as 50%, targeting imports from Brazil. In addition, the administration implemented 25% tariffs on selected imports from Canada, China, and Mexico, citing those countries’ alleged failure to curb the flow of fentanyl into the US.\nThe Supreme Court consolidated two separate lawsuits challenging the tariffs. The plaintiffs include seven small businesses and a coalition of twelve US states, all of whom argue that the tariffs exceed presidential authority and are thus unconstitutional, reported CNBC.\nIn a significant blow to Trump’s trade policies, the US Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit ruled on August 29 that the president had overstepped his executive powers. The court found that Trump had bypassed Congress in imposing sweeping, indefinite tariffs on a global scale under the guise of national emergency provisions.\nThe appellate ruling upheld a prior decision by the Court of International Trade, which concluded that while presidents can regulate imports during emergencies, they cannot unilaterally impose broad, open-ended tariffs without congressional approval.\nThe Trump administration warned that a delay in ruling could force the Treasury Department to refund between $750 billion and $1 trillion in previously collected tariffs if the duties are ultimately found to be illegal.\nAccording to the Tax Foundation, only about 16% of total US imports would be affected by a ruling invalidating the specific tariffs challenged in the current cases.","summary":"The US Supreme Court consolidated two separate lawsuits challenging the tariffs.","url":"https://www.news18.com/world/will-trumps-tariffs-be-ruled-illegal-us-supreme-court-sets-urgent-hearing-in-november-ws-l-9561122.html","image":"https://images.news18.com/ibnlive/uploads/2025/09/donald-trump-tariffs-2025-09-cc9ed08d3bf42817ae941bfbb138831a.png","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-09-09 23:25:11","author":"New.storytailors,News18,World Desk","authors":["New.storytailors","News18","World Desk"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"in","sentiment":-0.052},{"id":359054102,"title":"Trump condemns Israeli attack on Qatar","text":"President Donald Trump has criticized Israel’s airstrike on a Hamas compound in Doha, stressing that the decision to carry out the operation inside Qatar was made unilaterally by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and not by Washington.\n\nAround 15 Israeli warplanes fired at least ten munitions during the operation on Tuesday, reportedly killing several Hamas members, including the son of senior official Khalil al-Hayya. Hamas said its top leadership survived the attack, which it described as an attempt to assassinate negotiators working on a potential settlement.\n\nIn a statement posted Tuesday on Truth Social, Trump said the Israeli bombing inside “a Sovereign Nation and close Ally of the United States” did not “advance Israel or America’s goals.”\n\n“I view Qatar as a strong Ally and friend of the U.S., and feel very badly about the location of the attack,” he wrote, emphasizing that the strike was “a decision made by Prime Minister Netanyahu, it was not a decision made by me.”\n\nTrump said that as soon as he was informed about the operation, he directed US Special Envoy Steve Witkoff to warn Qatari officials, but noted the alert came “too late to stop the attack.” The president claimed that eliminating Hamas was a “worthy goal,” but expressed hope that “this unfortunate incident could serve as an opportunity for PEACE.”\n\nTrump has since spoken with Netanyahu, who told him he wanted to make peace, and with Qatari leaders, whom he thanked for their support and assured that “such a thing will not happen again on their soil.”\n\nQatar’s prime minister, Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman al-Thani, denounced the strike as an act of “state terrorism” and warned that the emirate “reserves the right to respond.” He accused Netanyahu of undermining regional stability for personal gain and said the incident had derailed ongoing US-brokered mediation efforts aimed at securing a ceasefire in Gaza and the release of Israeli hostages.\n\nThe White House called the strike an “unfortunate” incident.

One answer is that he is running out of options and needs quick wins. While Israel has air supremacy across the Middle East, it is fighting a bitter war of attrition on the ground in Gaza.\n\nYesterday, the Israel Defence Forces admitted four soldiers had been killed by Hamas. The steady drip of Israeli blood, without any clear defeat of the gunmen in prospect, seems to have driven Netanyahu to lash out. \n\nHad he destroyed the Hamas leadership in Qatar, Netanyahu might have claimed he had ‘decapitated’ the group, a welcome offering to the bellicose Right-wing coalition partners who keep him in power.\n\nNothing else is working, after all.\n\nBattered and bruised as it might be, Hezbollah has managed to survive the exploding pagers and the subsequent armed assault by the IDF. Iran still has nuclear technology despite Israel’s surprise air attack in June and the bunker-busting US bombs dropped on its underground sites.\n\nLashing out has not shut down Israel’s hardline enemies. Rather, they are learning lessons about how to survive and hit back. And it all comes at a huge financial cost.\n\nThe Pentagon has admitted that it gave a quarter of its anti-aircraft missile stock to Israel to combat the drones and missiles fired in retaliation by Iran. How long can that rate of destruction be sustained?\n\nNetanyahu’s belligerence across the Middle East is not making Israel more secure. Rather, it risks leaving it as isolated in its own region as it was for 30 years before the peace process with Egypt began in 1979.\n\nHe might have missed the Hamas leaders with yesterday’s strike on Qatar, but Netanyahu has certainly assassinated normal relations with Israel’s Arab neighbours. He has dismissed the idea that friendly states such as Britain could see terrorist reprisals thanks to his recklessness. But it is unlikely that our security services are quite so blase.\n\nIn Tehran, meanwhile, the Ayatollah must be rubbing his hands with glee as the Israelis achieve the seemingly impossible and unite Shiite Iran with its traditional Sunni Arab enemies across the Persian Gulf.\n\nNetanyahu risks a regional backlash against Israel, a nation surrounded by antagonists yet increasingly detached from any sense of its true vulnerability.\n\nIf the big money in the Gulf turns against Israel, tottering economies like Britain and France will face tough decisions about how to support a longstanding, important ally.\n\nBut Israel, isolated and alone, must start to think about a battle for survival. \n\nMark Almond is the director of the Crisis Research Institute, Oxford","summary":"Yesterday's air strike on Hamas leaders in Qatar was a rarity - the first time in recent years that one of Israel 's dramatic attacks on its regional enemies has failed to achieve its planned result","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-15082217/Israel-missed-enemies-assassinated-relations-Arab-neighbours-MARK-ALMOND.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/09/09/21/101987211-0-image-a-43_1757451057877.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-09-09 23:18:52","author":"Editor,Mark Almond","authors":["Editor","Mark Almond"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.305},{"id":359056430,"title":"Latest Revelations Complicate Trump’s Sweeping Denials About Epstein","text":"Throughout his presidency, Donald Trump has proved himself adept at evading the controversies that have dogged him on a near-daily basis.

During the election campaign he insisted that not only was this absolutely feasible, it would reduce average household energy bills by £300 a year.\n\nIn reality, his own department this summer authorised a ‘maximum strike price’ for new offshore wind farms of £113 per megawatt hour, three times what the Climate Change Committee claimed would be the future cost – and compared to an average cost of electricity last year of £72 per megawatt hour.\n\nWorse still, it is us, not the wind farm owners, who will also have to meet the additional costs of keeping our homes warm (and our industries humming) when the wind isn’t blowing – with what would amount to emergency supplies of gas.\n\nBut not with our own supplies, as Miliband wants to see an end to all that sinful hydrocarbon exploration, too – simultaneously destroying thousands of well-paid jobs in the British sector of the North Sea.\n\nAs one in that industry told me: ‘There are a hundred times the number of jobs in the North Sea at risk than what the government is preserving by keeping open the Scunthorpe steel plant. And the problems of our steel industry are anyway the result of Britain’s crazy energy policy, with the highest prices in the developed world.’\n\nMiliband constantly insists we should be proud of ‘leading the world on climate change policy’. But instead of being an example to other nations, we will be a warning.\n\nFascinatingly, one of those who has made this point is the American economist Noah Smith. It’s fascinating because Smith is, in his own country, a passionate supporter of renewable energy, and an eloquent critic of Donald Trump’s hostility to wind and solar power. Yet on his Substack platform last week, Smith wrote: ‘To see how a mismanaged and misguided push for green energy can hurt a country’s economy, you have to look no further than the UK…\n\n‘The UK was one of those small special cases where it really did make sense to keep using fossil fuels. The UK is a relatively small nation, so this wouldn’t have made much of a difference to climate change. Now, expensive energy is causing a political backlash in the UK. And why shouldn’t it? The UK chose to deprive its citizens and companies in order to produce a totally performative emissions reduction, setting an example that almost no other countries followed.’\n\nYes, it’s performative, because we have simply offshored our emissions: for example by taking colossal quantities of ‘renewable’ wood from North America to burn in the mighty Drax power station, rather than British coal it used to burn.\n\nAs for no other countries following, it’s more than that: countries or leaders who previously took a similar line, have smartly reversed.\n\nNew Zealand, which under Jacinda Ardern in 2018, instituted a ban on drilling in the country’s substantial subsea gas reservoirs, has re-started exploration. The new government’s resources minister, Shane Jones, had taken note of the New Zealand national grid bosses warning that the country was at risk of blackouts because renewables had not been generating sufficient power during cold snaps. Believe it or not, we have cold snaps too, frequently on the stillest of days.\n\nMost strikingly, Mark Carney who, as Governor of our own Bank of England made ‘fighting climate change’ part of the Bank’s remit and then set up something called the Net-Zero Banking Alliance, has – upon becoming Canada’s prime minister –scrapped the hated carbon tax he once eulogised. And he declared that Canada should boost conventional as well as ‘clean’ energy: ‘Yes, that does mean oil and gas. It means using our oil and gas here in Canada, to displace imports wherever possible.’\n\nUnsurprisingly, Carney’s Net-Zero Banking Alliance has disintegrated. And a few days ago, Lloyd’s of London, our great insurance market, followed suit on its carbon-reducing ambitions. The new chief executive, Patrick Tiernan, scrapped his predecessor’s pledge to make the market ‘net zero’ by 2050, and said insurers who operate at Lloyd’s will no longer have to hit targets requiring them gradually to stop underwriting fossil fuel projects.\n\nCommercially, it would have been suicidal for Lloyd’s to continue with its Milibandism. A fact underlined by BP, which under its previous boss, Bernard Looney, had decided its traditional business was incompatible with its ‘environmental, social and governmental’ objectives, and went full pelt into renewable energy. It was a disaster, its share price plummeting relative to its rivals. This year its new chief, Murray Auchincloss, bluntly announced: ‘We have completely decapitalised renewables.’\n\nAnd look what happened last week at BP’s arch-rival, Shell. It ditched the construction of a colossal bio-fuel plant in Rotterdam, as part of its own retreat from ‘green’ energy. This had been designed to make so-called sustainable aviation fuel out of crops more suitable for making into food. But, as Shell’s boss, Wael Sawan, pointed out, not only was this still up to four times more expensive than kerosene, there had been ‘backsliding on [biofuel] mandates in multiple countries’.\n\nThis makes a mockery of Rachel Reeves’ claim in January, when giving the go-ahead to Heathrow expansion, that it would all be compatible with comrade Miliband’s policies, because sustainable aviation fuel would be a ‘game-changer’.\n\nMeanwhile, Sir Jim Ratcliffe on Monday announced that his Ineos Energy company had ‘stopped investing in Britain’ because ‘the problem is that the UK has become one of the most unstable fiscal regimes in the world from a perspective of natural resources and energy’.\n\nI’ve got little sympathy for Ratcliffe, given he declared his backing for Labour during last year’s General Election campaign. What else did he imagine Ed Miliband would do, as the man committed to the extinction of exactly the sort of businesses Ratcliffe owns (petrochemicals)?\n\nIt seems Keir Starmer is belatedly queasy about Miliband’s agenda: the PM tried to persuade him to take charge of the department previously run by the defenestrated Angela Rayner. But Miliband refused to move.\n\nThe problem for Starmer is that Miliband is the most popular cabinet minister among Labour Party members, with a rating of +74 per cent. So he could stare down his own leader, a man vastly less admired within the party. Or as ‘a senior TUC figure’ told the Independent: ‘Ed is the last Left-wing person left in the Cabinet, so he has our support.’\n\nThe trouble is, Miliband is also ensuring that the UK has the last government in the world to see what way the wind is blowing on energy production. The West’s rush to net zero, as some of us have long predicted, is being abandoned because the claims it would benefit the consumer have been exposed as fantasy.","summary":"Will the last person to leave Britain please turn out the lights… That was a front page headline on April 9 1992, warning of the consequences should Neil Kinnock's Labour win that day's election.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/debate/article-15082405/One-one-energy-giants-turning-backs-green-power-leaving-Ed-Miliband-swinging-wind-DOMINIC-LAWSON.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/09/09/22/101988393-0-image-a-59_1757453768329.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-09-09 23:17:29","author":"Dominic Lawson,Editor","authors":["Dominic Lawson","Editor"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.019}]}
