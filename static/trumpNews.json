I want you to know that it’s a conscious decision,\" Healy told the crowd. \"We honestly don’t want our legacy to be one of politics. We want it to be that of love and friendship. I’m not trying to be too earnest, but you can go out into the world and there’s loads of politics everywhere. And I think we don’t need more politics.

Months after using the label to promote the sweeping tax cuts, President Donald Trump expressed his desire to rebrand the bill during a Cabinet meeting on Tuesday, citing the need to better communicate its benefits to working-class Americans.\nTrump emphasised that while the original name served its purpose during the bill’s approval process, it lacks clarity for the public. “Last month, in a landmark achievement, I also proudly signed the largest working-class tax cuts in American history. So the bill that — I’m not going to use the term ‘great, big, beautiful’ — that was good for getting it approved, but it’s not good for explaining to people what it’s all about,” Trump said. “It’s a massive tax cut for the middle class.”\nThe comments mark the first time Trump has publicly acknowledged the need to rebrand a major policy initiative. It also signals a strategic shift in how he and Republican allies plan to pitch their economic agenda ahead of the crucial 2026 midterm elections. The bill has become a cornerstone of GOP campaign messaging as they look to secure voter support by highlighting tax relief and economic growth.\nDuring the Cabinet session, Trump spoke at length about the legislation, praising its passage through Congress last month. He pointed out that it prevented a looming $4 trillion tax hike set for January, when his 2017 tax cuts were scheduled to expire. “That’s a number nobody ever heard of before,” he remarked.\n\n.@POTUS: “Last month, in a landmark achievement, I also proudly signed the largest working class tax cuts in American history… it’s a MASSIVE tax cut for the middle class.” pic.twitter.com/EtEd0sYxwF\n— Rapid Response 47 (@RapidResponse47) August 26, 2025\n\nThe legislation’s central feature is the permanent extension of Trump-era tax cuts for individuals and small businesses. It also introduces temporary tax breaks designed to deliver on key campaign promises. The Social Security relief will be issued through refunds.\nThe rebranding decision follows another announcement made by Trump on Monday, in which he reiterated his intention to rename the US Department of Defense. For the third time, he proposed reverting to its pre-1947 name, the ‘Department of War’.","summary":"The legislation’s central feature is the permanent extension of Trump-era tax cuts for individuals and small businesses.","url":"https://www.news18.com/world/trump-thinks-one-big-beautiful-bill-needs-rebranding-ahead-of-midterm-elections-ws-l-9530417.html","image":"https://images.news18.com/ibnlive/uploads/2025/08/trump-2025-08-1e663578f21a27c3311b43bb0bc09ee6.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-08-27 00:53:57","author":"New.storytailors,News18,World Desk","authors":["New.storytailors","News18","World Desk"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"in","sentiment":0.056},{"id":354630664,"title":"Why America’s Natural Ally, India, Is Pulling Closer to Russia and China","text":"Editor’s note: This is a lightly edited transcript of today’s video from Daily Signal Senior Contributor Victor Davis Hanson. Subscribe to our YouTube channel to see more of his videos.\n\nHello, this is Victor Davis Hanson for The Daily Signal. We’re currently in a little rough patch with India. \n\nNarendra Modi, who’s been the prime minister for 11 years—a very powerful figure within India and a player on the national scene—he’s a center-right politician, if not, you know, unabashedly right-wing. So, he would be a natural partner for the United States under President Donald Trump. And they did have very close relations in the first term.\n\nAnd Trump sees India as a large, English-speaking counterweight to China. It’s got 1.4 billion people. China’s a little bit bigger, but China has a falling—drastically falling—birth rate. India’s pretty steady. \n\nSo, India seems like it’s going to be more ascendant in the future, even more than China. And they’ve had a lot of border disputes along the Himalayan area, as they have with Islamic Pakistan. It’s also the largest democracy in the world.\n\nSo, you add up all of these ingredients and it seems like a natural ally of the United States in general and Donald Trump in particular: conservative governance, suspicious of China, democratic, English-speaking, closer to the United States than Islamic Pakistan, which has given us, you know, that was the sojourn or a base for Osama bin Laden.\n\nAnd then, more importantly, Indian Americans are now numbering 5 million or 6 million people. We’ve opened the borders wide open to people immigrating from India. And they immigrate often with a lot. They have English facility—gets them a leg up on other immigrants. And more importantly, they come with capital and skills. And they’re a very influential minority, very successful minority in the United States. And we welcome them with open arms.\n\nSo, you would think that the Modi-Trump, Indian-American relationship would be great, but it’s not. And why isn’t it? Well, one reason is that India traditionally ran large surpluses with us, given their tariffs and our lack of tariffs for India. But recently, that has closed. \n\nAnd now Indian economists and American economists and politicians disagree whether India has a big surplus with the United States in trade or a small—depending on how you count material goods, services, remittances, etc.\n\nBy the way, there’s about $35 billion to $40 billion in remittances that go to India. It’s right behind Mexico and Central America.\n\nSo, it should be a very profitable relationship, especially for India to have all of its citizens free to come to the United States. And millions apparently do, and they get billions of dollars in remittances. They run a trade surplus with us. And we have a lot of commonalities as English-speaking democracies. But we’re not.\n\nAnd so, why aren’t we? One of the greatest problems is Donald Trump slapped a tariff. And he said, “India’s tariffs are too high.” And they replied, “Well, if you look at services and the other intangibles that I mentioned, maybe it’s not that bad. And we’re working on it.” But Trump really did put high tariffs on India.\n\nThe second thing is, India buys a huge amount of Russian oil, along with China. We’re talking about secondary boycotts in the Trump administration and the United States. And what I mean by that is Trump will put high tariffs, if not sanctions, on countries that buy oil—buy Russian oil. Not just Russia itself that sells its oil. \n\nThis is very controversial because in the Indian mind, we’re not going to, necessarily, sanction Germany or some Europeans that buy Russian energy, natural gas and oil. Nor have we taken on the Chinese juggernaut that buys Russian oil. \n\nSo, India is saying, “Why are you picking on us, a rival of China, and so much commonality?”\n\nAnd Trump would reply: “Because you’ve been buying Russian oil for over three and a half years and fueling the Russian war machine that invaded Ukraine. And we’re now at delicate, critical periods in the Ukraine-Russian war. And if you were just to back off, voluntarily, the purchases of Russian oil, and maybe we could then pressure China and maybe I could consider tariffs.”\n\nAnd Prime Minister Modi said, “No.” And he not only said no, but he wasn’t going to be bullied around. And one of the results is now he is triangulating with China and Russia. So, he’s developing better relations with his traditional rival and enemy, China, and he’s cementing his relations with Russia.\n\nRemember, during the Cold War, Russia was very close to India. India was a veritable proxy of Russia. We backed Islamic Pakistan. So, in those wars between Pakistan and India, there was a Russian-American dimension. We were on the wrong side of it, in my opinion, because India was an English-speaking democracy. Pakistan was an Islamic autocracy, de facto.\n\nBut my point is that it has strong ties, historically, with Russia and it’s developing ties with China, and it’s pulling away from us, despite the fact that we allow them trade concessions, asymmetrical tariffs, generous remittances to be sent back. And it’s the second-largest immigrant group in the United States.\n\nHow’s it all going to end? We’ll see. A lot depends on the fate of the Ukraine war. If the Ukraine war were to end, we would restore friendly relations very quickly. If it doesn’t, things are gonna get worse.\n\nWe publish a variety of perspectives.

We promised to listen, and we have. Our new logo will be replaced, and the familiar ‘old timer’ will stay,’ the company announced.\n\nShares rose as much as 2.3 percent in after-hours trading following the news. \n\nThe uproar started last Tuesday (August 19) when the chain unveiled a new logo for the first time in 48 years. The redesign removed the image of an elderly man leaning on a barrel, leaving only the name in a refreshed font.\n\nIt also eliminated the pinto bean shape behind the name, a nod to one of the original side dishes offered when Cracker Barrel first opened in 1969.\n\nCritics argued that the changes removed the brand’s essence and allure, leading to a loss of almost $100 million in the company’s market value last week. \n\nSome critics compared the rebrand to Bud Light’s infamous Dylan Mulvaney campaign. \n\nEven President Donald Trump weighed in on the change today, telling Cracker Barrel bosses to scrap the new logo. \n\nTrump later congratulated the brand for listening to consumers. \n\nWriting on Truth Social, he said: ‘Congratulations “Cracker Barrel” on changing your logo back to what it was. \n\n‘All of your fans very much appreciate it. Good luck into the future. Make lots of money and, most importantly, make your customers happy again!’\n\nThis logo controversy coincides with the company’s efforts to revamp its 650 restaurants nationwide, replacing the rustic southern-style interiors with a more contemporary design. \n\nThat shift, too, has sparked backlash, with customers complaining the chain is ‘just turning into any other restaurant.’ \n\nThe chain’s name traces back to barrels that were once used to deliver crackers to country stores, which later served as makeshift tables for local gatherings. \n\n‘This rebrand says nothing about history or tradition and everything about marketing consultants making quick money,’ one Reddit user wrote. . \n\n‘The brief: ‘remove all personality from the logo, and ensure our brand blends into and disappears into the competitive landscape,” a Reddit user wrote. \n\n‘So they got rid of the cracker and the barrel,’ another person commented.\n\nAmericans also took to X to share memes. Some featured Mulvaney alongside the ‘new’ Cracker Barrel logo, while others recycled images from her 2023 Bud Light promotion — swapping beer cans for the barrels dropped from the logo. \n\nAnother image going viral featured another mocked up image showing Sydney Sweeney in a t-shirt showing the old logo. Users joked: ‘There’s only one person on the planet who can save Cracker Barrel.’ \n\n‘If I ever go to my local Cracker Barrel and they roll out this sign and the new interior, I genuinely won’t be going back,’ a guest revealed.\n\nFans are now calling on the 56-year-old chain to ‘revert to the original logo.’ \n\nHowever, Cracker Barrel is adamant in going through with the revamp.\n\n‘People like what we’re doing,’ Cracker Barrel president and CEO Julie Felss Masino told Good Morning America on Tuesday. \n\n‘Cracker Barrel needs to feel like the Cracker Barrel for today and for tomorrow — the things that you love are still there. We need people to choose us, and we want people to choose us.’\n\nShe added that the top question Florida-based managers asked her during a recent meeting was ‘How can I get a remodel, when can I get a remodel and how do I get on the list?.’\n\nCracker Barrel’s new fall menu and ‘all the more’ campaign could make up for fans’ disappointment in its new logo.\n\n‘We believe in the goodness of country hospitality, a spirit that has always defined us. Our story hasn’t changed. Our values haven’t changed,’ said chief marketing officer Sarah Moore. \n\n‘With ‘All the More,’ we’re honoring our legacy while bringing fresh energy, thoughtful craftsmanship and heartfelt hospitality to our guests this fall.’\n\nAmong the foods featured in its new fall menu include Sausage & Egg Hashbrown Casserole, Herb Roasted Chicken and Butter Pecan Sticky Buns. \n\nChains like Krispy Kreme and Dunkin’ have also dropped fall menus early. \n\nChick-fil-A was one of the latest to do so on August — introducing Pretzel Cheddar Club Sandwiches.\n\nThe Daily Mail has reached out to Cracker Barrel for comment on the customer backlash, and is awaiting response.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nCracker Barrel is scrapping its new logo after a social media backlash&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Cracker Barrel Makes Bold U-Turn, Shares Soar first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/news/cracker-barrel-makes-bold-u-turn-shares-soar/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Cracker-Barrel-screeching-U-turn-and-shares-skyrocket.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-08-27 00:39:42","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.195},{"id":354628174,"title":"Donald Trump: PM Modi says make and spend in India as 50% tariffs kick in","text":"GST, which was introduced eight years ago, replaced a maze of indirect taxes to reduce compliance and the cost of doing business.\n\nBut experts say it has too many thresholds and exemptions, making the system extremely complicated. They've repeatedly called for it to be revamped. \n\nNow, Modi has precisely promised that, with India's finance ministry putting out a proposal for a simplified two-tier GST system.\n\n\"Combined with the income tax cut in place from April 2025... the GST rate reforms [likely worth US$20bn; £14.7bn] should together provide a meaningful push to consumption,\" analysts from Jeffries, a US brokerage house, said after the announcement.\n\nPrivate consumption is a mainstay of India's economy, contributing to nearly 60% of the country's GDP. While rural spending – supported by a bumper harvest – has remained strong, demand for goods and services in cities has continued to slow down due to lower wages and job cuts in major sectors like IT, post the pandemic.\n\nModi's \"fiscal stimulus\" or tax cuts should help ensure a consumption recovery, according to investment banking firm Morgan Stanley. It will push GDP up and drag inflation down.\n\n\"This is particularly crucial amid headwinds from ongoing global geopolitical tensions and adverse global tariff-related developments that might impair external demand,\" Morgan Stanley said.\n\nAmong the sectors most likely to benefit from the tax breaks are consumer-facing ones such as, scooters, small cars, garments and even things like cement that goes into making homes, where demand typically picks up pace around Diwali.\n\nWhile the specifics are unknown, most analysts estimate that the revenue loss on account of a lower GST would be offset by surplus levy collections and higher than budgeted dividends from India's central bank.\n\nAccording to Swiss investment bank UBS, the GST cuts will also have a larger \"multiplier effect\" than the previous corporate and income tax cuts undertaken by Modi, as they \"directly affect consumption at the point of purchase, potentially leading to higher consumer spending\".","url":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c5ykznn158qo","image":"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/3e40/live/5f28ff50-81c8-11f0-b1b7-d5227004453f.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-08-27 00:39:41","author":"Nikhil Inamdar","authors":["Nikhil Inamdar"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.304},{"id":354629598,"title":"World News | 2 New Polio Cases in Pakistan Raise 2025 Tally to 23","text":"Islamabad [Pakistan], August 27 (ANI): Two more poliovirus cases have been reported in southern Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP), raising Pakistan's total to 23 this year, Dawn reported, citing the National Institutes of Health (NIH).

The latest target is Justice Minister Ricardo Lewandowski, a move Lula described as “irresponsible” by the US.Speaking during a cabinet meeting, Lula said, “I wanted to express my solidarity and the government’s solidarity with my colleague Lewandowski, who was faced with the irresponsible gesture of the United States in revoking his visa,” Al Jazeera added.Lula stressed that Brazil would not tolerate being treated as lesser by other countries, stating, “We are willing to sit at the table on equal terms. What we are not willing to do is be treated as if we were subordinates. We will not accept that from anyone,” Al Jazeera reported.Relations between Brazil and the US have been strained during US President Donald Trump’s second term. Trump has expressed support for Brazil’s former far-right president Jair Bolsonaro, who served from 2019 to 2023, while Trump has been in office since 2025. Bolsonaro is currently under house arrest as he faces trial for allegedly plotting a coup after narrowly losing to Lula in the 2022 presidential election, Al Jazeera reported.Trump has described the trial against Bolsonaro as a “witch hunt,” posting on his social media platform Truth Social on July 7: “He is not guilty of anything, except having fought for THE PEOPLE,” Al Jazeera noted.In a separate move, Trump sent a letter to President Lula threatening 50-percent tariffs on all Brazilian exports to the US, citing Bolsonaro’s treatment. “The way that Brazil has treated former President Bolsonaro, a Highly Respected Leader throughout the World during his Term, including by the United States, is an international disgrace,” Trump wrote. “This trial should not be taking place. It is a Witch Hunt that should end IMMEDIATELY!”The US had earlier targeted Brazilian Supreme Court Justice Alexandre de Moraes over his role in Bolsonaro’s investigation, revoking his visa and imposing financial sanctions. “De Moraes is responsible for an oppressive campaign of censorship, arbitrary detentions that violate human rights, and politicised prosecutions–including against former President Jair Bolsonaro,” Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said, according to Al Jazeera.Commenting on the attacks against Lewandowski, de Moraes, and other officials, President Lula said during the cabinet meeting, “These attitudes are unacceptable — not only against Minister Lewandowski, but also against Supreme Court justices or any Brazilian official,” Al Jazeera reported.The revocation of Lewandowski’s visa marks the latest in a series of US actions targeting Brazil’s government and judiciary amid ongoing political tensions between Brasilia and Washington.

In recent weeks, images of starving Palestinians, including children, in Gaza have shocked the world and fueled criticism of Israel over the worsening conditions.KEY QUOTESWhen asked on Fox News' \"Special Report with Bret Baier\" show if there is a post-war plan for Gaza, Witkoff said: \"Yes, we've got a large meeting in the White House tomorrow, chaired by the president, and it's a very comprehensive plan we're putting together on the next day.\"(function(v,d,o,ai){ai=d.createElement(\"script\");ai.defer=true;ai.async=true;ai.src=v.location.protocol+o;d.head.appendChild(ai);})(window, document, \"//a.vdo.ai/core/v-ndtv/vdo.ai.js\");When asked \"should Israel be doing anything differently to end the war and get the hostages home,\" Witkoff said: \"We think that we're going to settle this one way or another, certainly before the end of this year.\"Witkoff said Israel was open to continuing discussions with Palestinian militant group Hamas. He also said Hamas had signaled they were open to a settlement.CONTEXTU.S. ally Israel's devastating assault on Gaza since October 2023 has killed over 62,000 Palestinians, Gaza health authorities say. It has also caused a hunger crisis, internally displaced Gaza's entire population and prompted accusations of genocide and war crimes at international courts that Israel denies.The latest bloodshed in the decades-old Israeli-Palestinian conflict was triggered in October 2023 when Hamas attacked Israel, killing 1,200 and taking about 250 hostages, Israeli tallies show.(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)","summary":"U.S. special envoy Steve Witkoff said on Tuesday President Donald Trump will chair a meeting on Gaza at the White House on Wednesday and added that Washington expected Israel's war in the Palestinian territory to be settled by the end of the year.","url":"https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/donald-trump-to-chair-large-meeting-on-post-war-gaza-today-9165545","image":"https://c.ndtvimg.com/2025-04/l5qravvc_donald-trump-afp_625x300_04_April_25.jpeg?im=FeatureCrop,algorithm=dnn,width=1200,height=738","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-08-27 00:24:03","author":"Reuters","authors":["Reuters"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"in","sentiment":-0.414},{"id":354627790,"title":"Trump aide sets new timeframe for ending Ukraine conflict","text":"US special presidential envoy Steve Witkoff has said that Washington hopes to see the Ukraine conflict resolved by the end of 2025, citing Moscow’s “peace proposal on the table” and ongoing meetings with Russian and Ukrainian representatives.\n\nSpeaking at a cabinet meeting with President Donald Trump on Tuesday, Witkoff said he will be “having meetings all this week” on Ukraine and other global conflicts, “and we hope to settle them before the end of this year.”\n\nIn a follow-up interview with Fox News, Witkoff said that although Trump had expressed frustrations with both Moscow and Kiev, the Russian side has at least “put a peace proposal on the table.” He acknowledged that territorial concessions “may not be something that the Ukrainians can take,” but argued that the Trump administration had brought the sides closer to agreement than ever before.\n\n“There’s a peace proposal on the table,” Witkoff reiterated. “We’re at this place where we think the end is in sight... we have technical teams working on it and we're hopeful that by the end of this year, and maybe quite a bit sooner, we actually can find the ingredients to get to that peace deal.”\n\nAccording to Witkoff, President Putin expressed a clear desire to end the conflict and discussed Moscow’s position in depth with Trump during a historic Alaska summit earlier this month. While no details of any deal were made public, Moscow has long insisted that a sustainable settlement can only be achieved if Kiev agrees never to join NATO, undergoes demilitarization and denazification, and recognizes the new reality on the ground. This includes the status of Crimea, Donetsk, Lugansk, Kherson, and Zaporozhye as part of Russia – territories that voted to join the country in referendums in 2014 and 2022.\n\nWitkoff emphasized that any decision on territorial concessions would be for Ukraine to make, and suggested the issue would be tied to long-term security guarantees. He noted that he would meet Ukrainian officials in New York this week and stressed that Washington maintains daily communication with Moscow. Recent reports have indicated that ongoing discussions include Kiev potentially ceding its remaining positions in Donbass in exchange for yet-to-be-defined Western commitments.\n\nWitkoff further claimed “we may end up seeing a bilateral meeting” between Russian President Vladimir Putin and Ukraine’s Vladimir Zelensky, adding that Trump might be “needed at the table to finish a deal.”\n\nPutin has not ruled out meeting Zelensky, but insisted such a meeting could only follow tangible progress in negotiations. Moscow has also questioned Zelensky’s legitimacy, citing his expired term and warning that any deals he signs could be overturned by his successor.","summary":"US special presidential envoy Steve Witkoff has said that Washington hopes to see the Ukraine conflict resolved by the end of 2025 \nRead Full Article at RT.com","url":"https://www.rt.com/news/623561-witkoff-ukraine-peace-deal/","image":"https://mf.b37mrtl.ru/files/2025.08/article/68ae4f4220302708822f6686.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-08-27 00:23:33","author":null,"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"ru","sentiment":-0.008},{"id":354628250,"title":"'Like a sales mission:\" White House continues its push to embed American AI worldwide","text":"The White House is continuing to push forward on a three-pillar strategy announced in July to innovate, power and export American-made AI products.Michael Kratsios, director of the White House's Office of Science and Technology Policy, explained the administration's goals and progress in a Tuesday interview with Scripps News.\"For most countries around the world, the volumes of chips and the types of AI that we'll be needing aren't of real national security concern in the U.S. What we're most concerned about is us not being there, and adversaries having their chips and their AI in those countries,\" Kratsios said. \"So our biggest step right now is how do we get more people to use American AI?\"President Donald Trump has sought to boost U.S. chip production and increase federal control of some operations.

Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer has taken a victory lap in August for using an array of procedural roadblocks to drag out the confirmation process for Trump’s picks as long as possible. (RELATED: ‘Everything Is Under Consideration’: Senate GOP Vows Action To Steamroll Dems’ Obstruction)\n\n“President Trump has more than 1,000 senior-level appointments that require Senate confirmation. Under a radical Democratic resistance strategy, the Senate has so far confirmed only 135,” Barrasso wrote. “Confirming even the most routine nominees is now a bitter fight.”\n\n“It is time to change Senate confirmation rules,” Barrasso added.\n\nBarrasso has excoriated Schumer for forcing Senate GOP leadership to burn through hours of floor time to process nominees who would have been confirmed swiftly via unanimous consent or voice vote under previous presidents.\n\n“Democrats have forced multiple roll-call votes on more than 40 nominees for posts never subject to a single one,” Barrasso wrote. “These confirmations used to take seconds. Now, each can take days.”\n\nSchumer, however, has been unapologetic for dragging out the confirmation process by requiring multiple roll call votes to approve each nominee individually.\n\nThe lead Democrat publicly bragged about his caucus’ obstruction after a deal with the president to expedite the confirmation process for certain nominees collapsed. Trump objected to Schumer’s demand to unfreeze funding for certain agencies in exchange for providing consent.\n\n“Damn straight we’re blocking these nominees,” Schumer told “The Parnas Perspective” podcast on Aug. 14. “We can use every tool in the toolbox to delay them, and we have.”\n\n“Historically bad nominees need a historic response,” Schumer said. “And so we did. We blocked them all, and they were frustrated. Trump howled.”\n\nSenate Majority Leader John Thune has also expressed openness to reforming Senate rules to speed up the confirmation of the president’s nominees.\n\n“If you’re sitting here in August and you’ve only got 10 or 11 percent of the people that you’ve nominated for these positions actually confirmed, something is broken,” Thune told ABC affiliate KOTA-TV on Thursday.\n\nThough Barrasso does not detail specific rule changes that he would support, GOP senators floated a variety of potential reforms before leaving Washington for the August state work period.\n\n“One change would be to eliminate cloture motion on nominees and eliminate a motion to proceed and just have one vote and leave committee and have one vote,” Republican Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul told the DCNF in July.\n\n“And I think, really, the caucus is inclined to do something like that,” Paul added. “The push is going to come to shove if there is no negotiation and no settlement before that — I believe that the rules will change.”\n\nAll content created by the Daily Caller News Foundation, an independent and nonpartisan newswire service, is available without charge to any legitimate news publisher that can provide a large audience.

Sabraw cited that gap in services, and the additional time it will take to restore those services, as a reason for extending by one year certain deadlines related to asylum claims.\n\nThe judge also granted one-year extensions of deadlines dealing with registering families to be part of the class-action settlement and the final termination date of the agreement. He granted six-month extensions of deadlines dealing with certain services the government must provide class members, as well as immigration parole and work authorization grants.\n\nAttorneys from the American Civil Liberties Union, who represent the roughly 9,000 people covered by the settlement, hope the newly ordered extensions will provide enough time for the previously separated families to complete their asylum applications, while in the meantime being protected from deportation, as Sabraw has ordered.\n\n“The court once again rejected the Trump administration’s efforts to undermine this critical settlement and made clear these families must have an opportunity to get the services they need and to remain together,” Lee Gelernt, the deputy director of the ACLU’s Immigrants’ Rights Project, said in a statement Tuesday.\n\nIn a related ruling issued Tuesday, Sabraw ordered the government to provide the ACLU with identifying information for all those who are covered by the settlement who are also required to report for check-ins with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement.\n\nIn that order, the judge reminded the Trump administration that several federal agencies are parties to the settlement agreement, and that as such the administration has “an equal responsibility to ensure that class members receive the relief to which they are entitled, and to ensure that Class Members and (qualifying additional family members) are neither wrongfully detained nor removed.”\n\nLater on Tuesday, government attorneys filed a notice that they’ll appeal to the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals to overturn two of Sabraw’s previous orders that the government alert the ACLU within 24 hours if it detains anyone covered by the settlement agreement.\n\nThe settlement is part of a lawsuit the ACLU filed in February 2018 in San Diego federal court. After Sabraw ruled it was unconstitutional to systematically separate families arriving at the U.S.-Mexico border, the focus of the litigation turned to reunification. The Biden administration inherited the case and reached a settlement with the ACLU in 2023.\n\nOne component of the agreement barred the federal government from reenacting for at least eight years immigration policies that separate children and parents. The other component mandated that the government provide certain services to the families it had separated, including legal support for immigration and work authorization claims, and other social services.\n\nSabraw has ruled repeatedly in recent months that the current administration has breached the settlement by canceling contracts with Acacia Center for Justice and Seneca Family of Agencies, two of the main nonprofit organizations involved in providing the settlement-mandated services.\n\nLast month, the judge ordered the government to renew the lapsed contracts with Acacia, which was coordinating legal assistance for the families, and Bay Area-based Seneca, which had been coordinating case management, behavioral health services, medical services and outreach to the class members.\n\nEarlier this month, the ACLU attorneys argued that due to the lapse of those services and the months it will take Acacia and Seneca to restaff and rebuild their programs, “hundreds of class and family members have lost their parole status, leaving them vulnerable to detention, removal, and reseparation.”\n\nThe ACLU attorneys argued that the lapse in legal services came at an especially inopportune time since families who were part of the class-action lawsuit when it settled in December 2023 had a two-year deadline to apply for asylum approaching this December.\n\nWithout the extension of that deadline and others, the ACLU attorneys argued, the Trump administration’s “breaches will continue to frustrate the purpose and terms of the settlement.”\n\nGovernment attorneys argued that the extension of the asylum-application deadline and others would be premature since the government is following court orders by negotiating new contracts with Acacia and Seneca.\n\n“Moreover, extending the deadlines would constitute an unsubstantiated expansion of the terms negotiated by the parties and approved by the Court,” Daniel Schutrum-Boward, a trial attorney with the Department of Justice’s Office of Immigration Litigation, wrote in a motion opposing the deadline extensions.\n\nSabraw sided with the ACLU attorneys. Among the key deadline extensions he ordered was a one-year extension of the deadline by which class members have to complete their asylum applications or seek relief related to removal proceedings.\n\nThe judge also extended by one year, from December 2026 to December 2027, the deadline by which previously separated families can register to be considered for acceptance into the class.\n\nSabraw also extended the final termination date of the settlement agreement from December 2029 to December 2030.","summary":"Judge Dana Sabraw has ruled twice that Trump administration is breaching settlement","url":"https://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/2025/08/26/citing-settlement-breaches-san-diego-judge-extends-asylum-deadlines-for-separated-families/","image":"https://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/SUT-L-Icon-Fed-Courthouse-002.jpg?w=1600&resize=1600,900","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-08-27 00:15:16","author":"Alex Riggins","authors":["Alex Riggins"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.246},{"id":354629798,"title":"NextEra Energy Rallies Despite Big, Beautiful Bill's Blow to Clean Energy: Is the Stock Still a Buy?","text":"President Donald Trump on July 4 signed into law the \"big, beautiful bill,\" which rolls back over $200 billion in clean energy tax credits, in a move some have described as a \"disaster\" for the clean energy industry.\n\nFlorida-based utility company NextEra Energy (NEE -0.54%), which provides 12 million people with electricity and is America's largest provider of clean energy, stands to lose potentially hundreds of billions of dollars in tax credits that directly offset as much as 60% of the cost of new clean energy projects. The stakes were so high for the company that its CEO, John Ketchum, penned an open letter pleading with Congress to preserve clean energy incentives.\n\nBut a surprising thing has happened since the bill's passage: NextEra Energy shares have ticked up as part of a broader rally for clean energy stocks.\n\nDespite the setback from Washington, NextEra Energy is well positioned to outperform markets and continue increasing its dividend for years to come. Here's why.\n\nA large pipeline of early- and late-stage projects\n\nNextEra Energy got a break from the Treasury Department on Aug. 15 when it released guidance saying that companies would be eligible for remaining clean energy tax credits, even with less than 5% of the total project cost paid by the July 5, 2026, deadline. Beginning physical work will be enough to qualify.\n\nSolar stocks soared on the news, with NextEra shares rallying roughly 5% that day. That's in part because NextEra already has a 7.2-gigawatt backlog in solar projects, and Ketchum is well aware of what's needed to qualify for those tax credits. As he put it in the late July second-quarter 2025 earnings call: \"... our view is pretty simple and pretty straightforward. The begin construction term has been around for well over a decade.\"\n\nFor context, a gigawatt of electricity is enough to power 750,000 homes. NextEra is still planning an expansion of clean energy projects that could serve perhaps 10 million new customers in the years ahead.\n\nFor instance, the company's Florida Power & Light business, the largest electric utility provider in Florida, plans to add 8 gigawatts of solar and battery storage capacity by 2029. The company is also planning to expand its nuclear generation portfolio, and is in talks with regulators on restarting Iowa's only nuclear power plant, the Duane Arnold Energy Center, to add to its four nuclear units in Florida.\n\nAnd while Ketchum didn't specify exactly how many of these clean power projects already meet the \"begin construction\" standard to qualify for the credits, the company has almost a year to bring them to that threshold.\n\nA healthy, growing dividend while investors wait for more growth\n\nIn addition to having one arm of its business, Florida Power & Light, provide electricity to millions, NextEra Energy's other business, NextEra Energy Resources, is one of the largest energy infrastructure developers in the United States. With America's energy demand set to skyrocket thanks largely to power-hungry artificial intelligence (AI) data centers, rising demand for electricity will be an important tailwind for the company.\n\nOf course, only time will tell whether NextEra can lay claim to those lucrative tax credits by next July. And the \"inflection point\" that Goldman Sachs is warning of in electricity demand from the AI revolution is still a few years away. But as investors wait for surging electricity demand to boost NextEra's earnings and, ultimately, share price, the company looks well positioned to continue its decades-long streak of increasing dividends.\n\nIn the Q2 earnings call, Ketchum reiterated his expectation that NextEra will hike its dividend by around 10% next year. The company has now raised its dividend every year since 1994, including a 10% increase this year.\n\nAs you can see below, the company has maintained double-digit percent dividend growth in each of the last four quarters, which roughly tracks its earnings and revenue growth (the exception, a 17% dip in revenue in Q2 2024, came as higher interest rates ramped up NextEra's borrowing costs).\n\nData source: Company quarterly filings.\n\nNextEra's payout ratio of 75% means that the company already pays out 75% of its earnings in dividends, which is higher than income investors like to see. However, the company grew earnings by 25% year over year last quarter, which suggests earnings growth is exceeding the rate of dividend hikes.\n\nAll told, NextEra has raised its dividend by 629% in the 31 years since 1994, including annual hikes during the collapse of the dot-com bubble, the 2008-2009 financial crisis, and the pandemic-era lockdowns.

Earlier this month, Trump signed an executive order extending a tariff truce, delaying a sharp rise in duties on Chinese goods to allow more time for talks. Without the extension, tariffs would have jumped to 145 percent.\n\n[See more: China supports Brazil in fight against ‘arbitrary’ US tariffs]\n\nMagnets, made from rare earth elements, are a critical component in products ranging from smartphones to semiconductor chips.

It is my distinct honour to be here in New Delhi to make some remarks on the Ocean of Peace concept, of which I am probably the principal advocate during this decade. There have been many who have tried to promote the concept of the Pacific as an Ocean of Peace.\"\nAlso Read | India-US Reaffirm Commitment to Enhancing Cooperation Amid Tensions Over Additional 25% Tariffs on Indian Products.\nHe underlined the vastness of the Pacific and its geostrategic importance. \"While our island state might be small and scattered in the Pacific Ocean, collectively we have sovereign rights over 32 million square kilometres of the blue Pacific. This area alone is only slightly smaller than the combined land areas of Russia, China and the United States of America.\"\nSpeaking about regional identity, he added, \"Yet Pacific peoples have remained resilient. We are united by a shared identity and a deep guardianship of our ocean, although it is the world's ocean, the Pacific. This resilience and unity inspired the Ocean of Peace concept and its vision for the future.\"\nAlso Read | 'This Must End Now': Donald Trump to Impose Additional Tariffs on Nations Imposing Digital Taxes on US Tech.\nRecalling the history of Pacific peoples, the Fijian leader noted, \"Our forebears journeyed into the unknown some 3,000 years ago in great outrigger canoes. They steered by brilliant navigation using the stars only at the time. These pioneers sailed infinite miles month after month, finally settling on the islands and atolls that they discovered.\"\nCalling this \"one of the most remarkable migrations of a people,\" Rabuka also pointed to the region's vulnerabilities. \"The blue Pacific has been a theatre of external wars. It has been treated as a testing ground for the most dangerous weapons. It has endured catastrophic calamities caused by climate change and its rich resources exploited by many. This is the current reality of the blue Pacific.\"\nHe stressed that Fiji has already incorporated these challenges into its policy. \"Recognising these security dynamics, in September 2024, Fiji launched its inaugural foreign policy white paper, which carefully articulates that our most significant security threat lies in the prospect of a wider region driven by division, insecurity and instability.\"\nDrawing on his personal journey, Rabuka said, \"As I farewell the draft of peacekeepers, when I was commander of the Fiji Army, I told them we cannot give anybody anything we do not have. And we have been peacekeeping in the Middle East since 1978. And people ask, where are you from, Fiji? Where is that in the Pacific? So I thought one of the very basic things we must create in the homeland, home area of these peacekeepers is to take abroad a peace that we already feel at home.\"\n\"That is why I have advocated for the Pacific to be a zone or an ocean of peace. This challenge for peace has faced me squarely for the past few years, and in fact, since I became a peacekeeper and a politician,\" he added.\nAddressing wider global concerns, he remarked, \"We live in a time where there is growing economic uncertainty throughout the world, and that is felt very keenly in our geographically dispersed Pacific states. The global rules-based international order has been tested to its limits. And multilateralism is eroding in the face of prolonged conflicts and humanitarian catastrophes. Further exacerbating the situation is the existential threat posed by the impact of climate change. Rising sea levels, increasingly severe weather events and the changing ecosystem threaten our ways of life and our very existence in the blue Pacific.\"\nRabuka emphasised the importance of collective action. \"That brings me to what we can do as a Pacific family through the Ocean of Peace concept, which is founded on the Pacific way of dialogue, diplomacy and consensus. I have always believed in the Pacific approach to security, to stability and to prosperity. We are stronger when we stand together.\"\nHe recalled his proposal at the Pacific Island Forum in 2023, stating that he had urged \"that regional leaders agree on a set of principles that embed peace as the cornerstone of our individual and collective policies in the region.\"\nExplaining the core of the idea, he said, \"At the core of the concept is a shared aspiration rooted in our traditions and guided by a collective commitment to regional cooperation and stability. It reaffirms our commitment to ensuring our people can lead free, healthy and productive lives. In effect, the Ocean of Peace concept is a signal that we seek a region in which strategic competition is managed, where stability is the touchstone of regional relationships, and where coercion is kept in check.\"\nHe further underlined that peace must go hand in hand with development. \"This concept also calls for us to remain committed to peaceful development because lasting peace across our countries requires a careful balance between national security and sustainable development. This elusive peace is not something achieved through our police or security forces alone. It also requires families and communities, societies and nations that are built on the foundation of harmony, stability, satisfaction with life, and freedom from want and fear.\"\nConcluding his address, Rabuka outlined the guiding values. \"The Ocean of Peace stands on core principles of the concept which primarily draws our foundational tenets of Pacific regionalism. It is our opportunity to weave the threads of our Pacific past with our vision for our Pacific future. The Ocean of Peace concept is based on the following twelve principles: a shared commitment to peaceful resolution of disputes based on the Pacific way; respect for international law and norms--we recall the United Nations General Assembly Declaration on the Rights of People to Peace that was adopted on the 12th of November 1984; rejection of coercion as a means to achieve security, economic or political advantage; freedom to determine our own security and strategic policies; upholding freedom of navigation and overflights; and a commitment to the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons.\" (ANI) (This is an unedited and auto-generated story from Syndicated News feed, LatestLY Staff may not have modified or edited the content body)","summary":"Get latest articles and stories on World at LatestLY.

Charlamagne, a self-described Democrat, questioned the motives of protesters who burn the flag. \"I understand it's free speech, but it's just, like, I always wondered, why would you want to do that if you are an American, if you're a patriot, you know?\" the radio host asked. \"I mean, if you consider yourself a patriot, like, why would you want to burn the American flag?\" TRUMP FLAG BURNING EXECUTIVE ORDER COULD FLIP FIRST AMENDMENT ON ITS HEAD WITH NEW COURT \"You want the country to actually be better, and you want the country to, you know - that flag symbolizes what that country stands for. You want that country to actually stand up for that flag and to stand up for the creed that it puts out there. That's what you actually want, right?\" he asked. \"I don’t know, it just reminds me of like when people, you know, burn the jerseys of their favorite players like just because you're mad,\" he said, \"But you still love the team.\" When one listener called in, arguing that a ban on flag burning is a violation of constitutionally guaranteed free speech, the radio host turned the question around and asked why protesters would burn the flag of the very country they depend upon for freedom. \"I agree, but what I was saying is, I understand free speech, of course, I'm all for free speech,\" Charlamagne said. \"But it's just wild to burn the flag, but then use the Constitution to say you can burn the flag. Because burning the flag means you don't give a damn about America. So if you don't give a damn about America, you shouldn't care about the Constitution, either!\" TRUMP BANS FLAG BURNING AFTER YEARS OF RIOTING, LEFT-WING DESECRATION: TIMELINE OF OLD GLORY OFFENDERS The caller pressed his objection further. \"For the president to tell me that I can’t do something in this country means he is a dictator,\" the caller said. \"Otherwise, the Constitution doesn’t matter.\" \"I'm not agreeing with what the president is doing,\" Charlamagne said. \"I'm just simply saying, ‘Let's look at all sides of it,’ because the American flag represents a symbol of freedom, and we want this country to uphold that freedom that it promises. So, it's just weird to burn the flag, but then still point to the Constitution, democracy, and freedom, and say, ‘That's what we want.’\" In a statement to Fox News Digital, White House spokesperson Taylor Rogers said, \"President Trump will not allow the American Flag – a special symbol of our country’s greatness – to be used as a tool to incite violence and riots that jeopardize the safety of everyday Americans. President Trump will always protect the First Amendment, while simultaneously implementing commonsense, tough-on-crime policies to prevent violence and chaos.\" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP The Supreme Court ruled in the 1989 case Texas v. Johnson that burning the American flag is a form of symbolic speech that is protected by the First Amendment.

His trip to India, Pakistan and Afghanistan reinforced China’s pivotal role in the emerging global power dynamics. While it reaffirmed China’s close strategic ties with Pakistan, Wang Yi’s visit to India also signified improvement in relations with the latter country. His day trip to Kabul marked Beijing’s efforts towards regional cooperation and connectivity. \n\nThe visit assumes greater significance in view of the recent conflict between India and Pakistan, which heightened tensions in the region, and the breakdown in New Delhi’s strategic relations with Washington, driven by President Donald Trump’s tariff war. The latest development has dramatically changed regional power dynamics, highlighting China’s central role in propelling the shift towards a multipolar world order. Being a major global investor and trading partner, it is reshaping global trade dynamics. \n\nAlthough Wang Yi did not make any specific comment about the India-Pakistan conflict, he stressed the need for increasing regional cooperation. Speaking to the media in Islamabad, he emphasised that China’s partnerships with both India and Pakistan “were not targeted at any third party, nor were they affected by any third party”. The Chinese foreign minister described Islamabad as the “most important stop”, underscoring a “stronger internal drive” behind Pak-China ties.\n\nDuring his three-day stay in Islamabad, the Chinese foreign minister co-chaired the Pak-China Strategic Dialogue, besides meeting the top Pakistani civil and military leadership. The dialogue reportedly reviewed the entire spectrum of the relationship between the two countries — from defence to connectivity and economic cooperation. While close cooperation in defence has been the hallmark of Pakistan and China’s long-standing strategic partnership over the years, the economic dimension has become equally important.\n\nWhereas Pakistan’s success in the four-day conflict against India owes, to a large extent, to the defence cooperation with China, support from its all-weather friend has also helped keep this country financially afloat. China has become the biggest investor in Pakistan with its multibillion-dollar projects under CPEC. The Islamabad dialogue also discussed the second phase of CPEC, widening the scope of the project to agriculture, mining and industrial production. \n\nThere may be some questions in Beijing over the warming of relations between Islamabad and Washington and the increasing security cooperation between them, but there is no sign of the development affecting the strategic alliance between China and Pakistan. Despite its ongoing trade war with the US, it is not a zero-sum game for China. Soon after his highly publicised luncheon meeting with President Trump at the White House in June, the army chief flew to Beijing where discussions on developments in the regional and global political landscape were on the agenda.\n\nThere seems to be a clear understanding in Beijing about the transactional nature of the new ties between Islamabad and Washington and that it would not in any way impact its strategic partnership with Pakistan. But we need to be careful as we try to balance these two relationships. It’s extremely useful to have good relations with the most powerful country in the world, but one has to be cautious about the ‘business deals’ given Trump’s impetuousness and unpredictable policy approach.\n\nThere are, however, some irritants in Pak-China relations that need to be resolved. A major concern for Beijing is the deteriorating security situation and the targeting of Chinese nationals working on various CPEC projects in Balochistan and KP by militants fighting the Pakistani state. Chinese officials have often publicly spoken about their concerns. It’s extremely important to address the security concerns, particularly as Islamabad negotiates the next CPEC phase. There is huge potential for Pakistan to expand its bilateral trade with China but for that, there needs to be a clear and long-term policy. \n\nBefore coming to Pakistan, the Chinese foreign minister spent three days in New Delhi meeting senior government officials. It was the first visit by a top Chinese diplomat to India in three years amid a thaw in icy relations between the world’s two most populous nations. The shift in India’s stance came after growing acrimony with the Trump administration in the tariff face-off. \n\n Pak-China relations have not been affected by Islamabad’s improved ties with Washington.\n\nIn the latter instance, tensions between the two allies have taken a vicious political turn, with Trump slapping a 50 per cent tariff on all Indian exports to the US. India is now among the countries subjected to the highest US tariff rates. Interestingly, 25pc of the tariff is on account of India’s import of Russian oil. \n\nThere have been other political reasons behind Trump’s ire as well, including India’s refusal to acknowledge America’s role in mediating a ceasefire in its conflict with Pakistan. Cracks in its decades-long alliance with Washington are becoming visible, which is a major geopolitical setback for India, a key partner in the US-led anti-China coalition. Previous US administrations had projected India as a counterweight to China. \n\nNew Delhi is now moving to reset its foreign policy options by trying to mend fences with its rival. India’s foreign minister and national security adviser had earlier visited Beijing — before the Chinese minister came to New Delhi, where, setting aside protocol, Prime Minister Narendra Modi met Wang Yi, and also accepted the invitation to attend the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) to be held in China at the end of this month.\n\nIt will be the first visit of the Indian prime minister to China in seven years. It is being seen as India’s move to defuse the tension aggravated by border clashes between the two countries in 2020, soon after the Modi government annexed occupied Kashmir. The summit will also be attended by Russian President Vladimir Putin and Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif. Importantly, the conference will provide an opportunity for the leaders to hold meetings on the sidelines. According to some media reports, a meeting between Modi and Chinese President Xi Jinping is expected, with Putin joining in. \n\nThe SCO conference has assumed great importance in view of the shifting sands of global politics. The forthcoming gathering of over 20 countries from Asia and the Middle East is being seen as a powerful show of Global South solidarity in the age of global disorder.\n\nThe writer is an author and journalist.\n\nzhussain100@yahoo.com\n\nX: @hidhussain\n\nPublished in Dawn, August 27th, 2025","summary":"LAST week, the Chinese foreign minister visited South Asia amidst changing regional geopolitics and realignments in international politics.

If it comes, recognition will be little more than an acknowledgement of their impotence on the global stage.\n\n Canberra just might be focused on placating Israel.\n\nYesterday, Australia decided to expel the Iranian ambassador, accusing his country of propelling antisemitic attacks in Australia. Whether or not the charge is credible, Canberra just might be focused on placating Israel. Even initially, Anthony Albanese was pathetically mild in his response to Netanyahu’s undiplomatic tirade, and the wretched Israeli leader isn’t exactly wrong in calling out his Australian counterpart as “weak”. Albanese’s weakness, though, revolves around the reluctance of his government to acknowledge Israel’s genocide, despite the sharp shift in public opinion since October 2023.\n\nFrancesca, barred from the Zionist terror zone and sanctioned by the US, saw the light from the get-go. Her Australian namesake, like most Western politicians, hedges his bets. He won’t dare go as far as France, which summoned the US ambassador for a potential dressing-down at the foreign ministry after Charles Kushner — Ivanka Trump’s father-in-law — complained about antisemitism, alleging it had been reinforced by the imminent recognition of a Palestinian state.\n\nThese are purely US/ Israel bullying tactics, and they may yet prevent the Western nations that have pledged to recognise a Palestinian state at the UN next month from actually doing so, given that they have mostly hedged their bets by conditioning their token gesture on Hamas’s exit from Gaza and/ or disarmament, so that all its ca--dres can remorselessly be slaughtered. Never mind that, even according to Israeli statistics, fewer than 20 per cent of its victims have been Hamas or Islamic Jihad affiliates.\n\nThe meaningless Palestinian Authority, which serves merely as a handmaiden of the Israeli occupation forces in the West Bank, and neighbouring Arab states have also focused mainly on Hamas as an obstacle. Palestinians justifiably see the donkeys that have facilitated their movements from one death zone to another as more reliable allies than the Arab leadership. The rest of the Muslim world, beginning with Egypt and Jordan, has proved as useless as the European states did during the Nazi-led Judeocide.\n\nThey remain not just equally useless but, in most cases, complicit even as the ‘never again’ slogan from 80 years ago is being violated by an ally that brooks no criticism — and, when inevitably faced with calls for restraint, screams ‘antisemitism!’ des-p-ite having struggled long and hard to associate an ancient religion, more than 3,000 years old, with a fas-cistic politic ideology that stretches back for around 140 years.\n\nMany of the supposed revelations that have recently been emerging about deadly Israeli actions and intentions ought to have been obvious ages ago. Targeting children? Tick. Targeting journalists — five of whom were slaughtered in an attack on a hospital on Monday, bringing the total closer to 200 — also gets a tick. How dare they try to chr-onicle the nitty-gritty of a genocide? If the truth can set you free, then it must not be told.\n\nDonald Trump and Benjamin Netanyahu love to wallow in the murk of untruth. The likes of Emmanuel Macron, Friedrich Merz, Keir Starmer and Anthony Albanese aren’t far behind. It’s far too late for recognition of a Palestinian state by a small bunch of Israel’s collaborators to meaningfully shift the dial. Had this kind of courtesy been shown to South Africa 40 years ago, we would still be living with apartheid. And we are, in another country and a different century, where sanctions apply to the critics rather than the perpetrators of genocide. \n\nmahir.dawn@gmail.com\n\nPublished in Dawn, August 27th, 2025","summary":"ONE of the placards in evidence at the rally against genocide in Sydney last Sunday declared something along the lines of: ‘There’s only one Albanese I respect: Francesca.’\n\n\n\nThe acknowledgement of the Italian le­­g­al expert serving admirably as the UN’s spe­­cial rapporteur on the Israeli-occupied territories for more than three years, who is excluded from those territories and sanctioned by the US for daring to speak truth to power, contrasts with opinions about Au­­s­­tralian Prime Minister Anthony Alba­n­ese (no relation) who has consciously been as mealy-mouthed in his response to the genocide in Gaza as any other Western leader.\n\n\n\nHardly anyone is impressed by his tiff with his Israeli counterpart after the rabidly anti-humanitarian Benjamin Netan­yahu accused the Australian PM of promoting antisemitism by holding out the pros­­pect of recognising a Palestinian state, after the government in Canberra sensibly denied a visa to Simcha Rothman, one of the many fascist members of the Knesset under Netany","url":"https://www.dawn.com/news/1937496/killing-time","image":"https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/68ae3f4dadb8f.png","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-08-26 23:55:25","author":"Mahir Ali","authors":["Mahir Ali"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"pk","sentiment":-0.212},{"id":354632660,"title":"US envoy says to meet Ukrainian representatives in New York this week","text":"Washington, Aug 27 (SocialNews.XYZ) US president's special envoy Steve Witkoff said that he will meet with representatives from Ukraine in New York this week as diplomatic efforts continue to seek an end to the Ukraine conflict.\n\n\"I'm meeting with the Ukrainians this week.

Chuck Grassley, announced the resolutions of 10 cases, including eight settlements in the last two weeks. Most of the cases concern agents who had accused the FBI of politicizing its work during President Joe Biden’s administration, a claim leadership denied.\n\nThree of the agents are returning to duty at the FBI. Others are being permitted to voluntarily retire, and some are receiving restoration of back pay and benefits, the organization said in a statement announcing the deals. The FBI did not return an email seeking comment, though Director Kash Patel said on social media last week that agreements had been reached.\n\nThe resolutions come even as the FBI under Patel has moved to reassign and outright dismiss experienced senior executives for unclear reasons. The bureau this month fired, among others, a former acting director who had resisted a Trump administration demand to produce the names of agents who participated in Jan. 6 investigations. The head of its Washington field office, who had played an important role in those probes, was also forced out.\n\nThe FBI Agents Association has warned that those terminations were done without due process.\n\nThe settlements announced Tuesday include agents who were held up by Republican lawmakers looking to establish that the FBI during the Biden administration had become intolerant of the expression of conservative viewpoints — something Patel’s predecessor, Chris Wray, vigorously denied.

The designation is a “security feature” for voter applications, it said – not an indication that voters could submit ballots without proper ID.\n\nTrump narrowly lost Pennsylvania in the 2020 election, with Democrat Joe Biden edging him out by less than 1 percent.\n\nIn Arizona, another critical battleground swing state that Trump lost in 2020, Honey participated in a partisan audit of election results in Maricopa County, a populous area containing the city of Phoenix.\n\nDespite searching for fraud for nearly six months, the audit turned up no evidence that the outcome in Biden’s favour was erroneous. Still, experts say that audit was filled with errors and biased methodology.\n\nIn the years since, former Maricopa County Recorder Stephen Richer, a Republican, told The Associated Press that he had received dozens of public records requests related to elections from Honey.\n\nRicher served in the role from 2021 to 2025, and said that such requests occupied “scores of hours of staff time”.\n\nHe told The Associated Press he was surprised to hear Honey was in a position of such “authority and responsibility” and said that she was “not a serious auditor”.\n\nHoney is not the first Trump official to face public scrutiny for her role in his administration. Other appointees, like Emil Bove, have faced intense public questions about whether they would prioritise their loyalty to Trump over their commitment to government ethics.\n\nSince his victory in the 2024 election, Trump has also opened investigations into critics and officials who probed his false claims about the 2020 election.\n\nHe has said he will do away with things like mail-in ballots and voting machines, demands shared by others who push anti-election conspiracies on the US right.","summary":"Heather Honey, who supported Trump&#039;s false claims about the 2020 race, has been named to oversee &#039;election integrity&#039;.","url":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/8/26/trump-loyalist-who-pushed-false-election-claims-takes-on-government-role?traffic_source=rss","image":"https://www.aljazeera.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/2025-04-01T155422Z_834626356_RC23PDAL8OE5_RTRMADP_3_USA-ELECTION-FLORIDA-HOUSE-1756251200.jpg?resize=1920%2C1440","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-08-26 23:47:04","author":"Al Jazeera,Apps Support","authors":["Al Jazeera","Apps Support"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"QA","sentiment":-0.45},{"id":354623614,"title":"FBI Agents Who Alleged Bureau Politicization Under Biden Administration Settle","text":"WASHINGTON – The Justice Department has come to terms with several current and former FBI agents who claimed they faced disciplinary actions due to their personal and political beliefs, concerning matters such as the January 6, 2021 Capitol events and views on the COVID-19 vaccine, or due to conflicts with supervisors regarding investigative strategies, according to their attorneys on Tuesday.\n\nEmpower Oversight, an organization established by past aides of Republican Sen. Chuck Grassley, reported the resolution of 10 cases, with eight final settlements occurring over the past fortnight.

The FBI was unavailable for comment via email, although last week Director Kash Patel confirmed via social media that settlements had been reached.\n\nThis development occurs even as the FBI, led by Patel, is reportedly reassigning and terminating senior officials without transparent justification.

Residents Divided on Trump's Response Following Local Homicide","text":"WASHINGTON — Following the city’s first homicide in nearly two weeks early Tuesday, locals in the area where the event occurred have differing opinions on the deployment of federal law enforcement forces by President Donald Trump. \n\nNBC News spoke to more than a dozen residents and workers in the vicinity of the 300 block of Anacostia Road in Southeast D.C. Metropolitan Police reported responding to a deadly shooting there shortly after midnight, marking the first homicide in D.C. since August 13. \n\nOn Tuesday afternoon, with the school day ended, several children lingered on the steps of an apartment complex at the site of the shooting.\n\nOpinions on Trump’s “federal takeover” of D.C. were mixed among residents; some praised his commitment to public safety, while others felt the increased law enforcement presence was unnecessary or not focused on the right areas of the city.\n\n“I really don’t have no problem with police presence,” said Brian Williams, 56, who noticed National Guard, FBI, and local police in the area. “It’s much-needed in certain neighborhoods of the district. Not all of them is needed, but some of them is needed.”\n\nBut, Williams added, “the ones that’s needed, you don’t see the presence in there.”\n\nSome residents noted they hadn’t observed any National Guard or federal agents in their area. A Washington Post map from August 15 showed a stronger presence in wealthier, more tourist-frequented wards west of the Anacostia River.\n\nTrump had boasted Monday that it had been “many years since we went a week without having a murder.” (D.C. had a 16-day streak earlier this year.) National Guard troops began arriving in D.C. on Aug. 12 in response to Trump’s declaration of a “crime emergency” in the nation’s capital. \n\nFederal agents are focused on arresting violent offenders, including drug dealers — often by executing warrants — rather than patrolling neighborhoods, according to a White House official.\n\n“Thanks to President Trump’s bold action, federal and local officers have been going into high-crime areas all across the Washington, D.C., to stop dangerous criminals,” White House spokesperson Taylor Rogers said. “In fact, the violent crime plaguing the city’s communities is exactly why President Trump is cracking down on crime and restoring law and order. The Trump ministration will not rest until D.C. is the safest city in the country.”\n\nMost of the people in the neighborhood surrounding Tuesday’s shooting declined to give their full names out of fear of retribution. Several said they saw police on Anacostia Road after the homicide.\n\nA 77-year-old man who identified himself only as Ray said police show up “only when something like that happens.” He said he has not seen much change in the weeks since Trump’s policy went into effect — that he feels no difference in his level of safety.\n\n“I don’t mess with nobody,” he said. “I speak to [people], they speak to me, and then I go in the house.”\n\nFor some residents, the increased law enforcement presence has the perverse consequence of creating fear and anxiety among people who are not committing crimes.\n\n“When I saw the police presence, I felt threatened here in this neighborhood, right across the street,” said Juan, who declined to give his last name, pointing to 37th Street SE, which runs roughly parallel to Anacostia Road in D.C.’s 7th Ward.\n\nJuan, who identified himself as a member of the LGBTQ community, said he has sporadically seen a federal presence, including agents from Immigration and Customs Enforcement. He is opposed to that presence.\n\n“Don’t come to neighborhoods where people are in their residence. Don’t go and harass the Hispanic people that are on their way home from work,” he said. “Because you’re targeting the citizens, you’re targeting the law-abiding citizens who are taxpayers, who are working people, working citizens of the community, instead of the people who are causing the riffraff, the drama.”\n\nA woman who gave her name as Israel, who works in the area around Tuesday morning’s shooting but lives in the River Turn section of the city on the west side of the Anacostia River, said she is comfortable with the stepped-up federal presence Trump has ordered. \n\n“I’m not mad at him,” she said. “People are scared to come outside. Your kids can’t play outside.” \n\nIsrael added that she wants juveniles to be prosecuted as adults to deter crime.\n\n“Right now, they’re getting a slap on the wrist,” she said. “They need to get more of a sentence, like an adult. … They need to be locked up.

NBC News talked to more than a dozen people Tuesday who live and work in the area surrounding the 300 block of Anacostia Road in Southeast D.C., where, according to the Metropolitan Police Department, city officers had responded to a fatal shooting shortly after midnight. It was the first homicide reported in D.C. since Aug. 13. On Tuesday afternoon, after schools had let out for the day, more than a half-dozen children loitered on the front steps of an apartment complex on the block where the shooting occurred. The local response to Trump's \"federal takeover\" of D.C. was mixed, with some crediting him for taking an active interest in public safety in the city and others criticizing him for a buildup they described as unnecessary or aimed at the wrong parts of the city. “I really don’t have no problem with police presence,” said Brian Williams, 56, who reported seeing National Guard, FBI and local police forces in the neighborhood. “It’s much-needed in certain neighborhoods of the district. Not all of them is needed, but some of them is needed.” But, Williams added, \"the ones that's needed, you don't see the presence in there.\" Some residents said they had not seen National Guard or federal agents in their neighborhood at all, and a Washington Post map of such sightings, published Aug. 15, showed a much heavier presence in the wealthier and more tourist-trafficked wards west of the Anacostia River. Trump had boasted Monday that it had been “many years since we went a week without having a murder.” (D.C. had a 16-day streak earlier this year.) National Guard troops began arriving in D.C. on Aug. 12 in response to Trump’s declaration of a “crime emergency” in the nation’s capital. Federal agents are focused on arresting violent offenders, including drug dealers — often by executing warrants — rather than patrolling neighborhoods, according to a White House official. “Thanks to President Trump’s bold action, federal and local officers have been going into high-crime areas all across the Washington, D.C., to stop dangerous criminals,\" White House spokesperson Taylor Rogers said. \"In fact, the violent crime plaguing the city’s communities is exactly why President Trump is cracking down on crime and restoring law and order. The Trump Administration will not rest until D.C. is the safest city in the country.” Most of the people in the neighborhood surrounding Tuesday's shooting declined to give their full names out of fear of retribution. Several said they saw police on Anacostia Road after the homicide. A 77-year-old man who identified himself only as Ray said police show up \"only when something like that happens.\" He said he has not seen much change in the weeks since Trump's policy went into effect — that he feels no difference in his level of safety. \"I don't mess with nobody,\" he said. \"I speak to [people], they speak to me, and then I go in the house.\" For some residents, the increased law enforcement presence has the perverse consequence of creating fear and anxiety among people who are not committing crimes. \"When I saw the police presence, I felt threatened here in this neighborhood, right across the street,\" said Juan, who declined to give his last name, pointing to 37th Street SE, which runs roughly parallel to Anacostia Road in D.C.'s 7th Ward. Juan, who identified himself as a member of the LGBTQ community, said he has sporadically seen a federal presence, including agents from Immigration and Customs Enforcement. He is opposed to that presence. \"Don't come to neighborhoods where people are in their residence. Don't go and harass the Hispanic people that are on their way home from work,\" he said. \"Because you're targeting the citizens, you're targeting the law-abiding citizens who are taxpayers, who are working people, working citizens of the community, instead of the people who are causing the riffraff, the drama.\" A woman who gave her name as Israel, who works in the area around Tuesday morning's shooting but lives in the River Turn section of the city on the west side of the Anacostia River, said she is comfortable with the stepped-up federal presence Trump has ordered. \"I'm not mad at him,\" she said. \"People are scared to come outside. Your kids can't play outside.\" Israel added that she wants juveniles to be prosecuted as adults to deter crime. \"Right now, they're getting a slap on the wrist,\" she said. \"They need to get more of a sentence, like an adult. ... They need to be locked up. Because as long as they keep letting them out, they're going to keep stealing cars, they're going to keep robbing stores.\" Trump said Monday that he is so pleased with the results in D.C. that he wants to expand the program — which features federal agents focusing on local law enforcement and a National Guard presence — to other cities, including Chicago. “Within one week, we will have no crime in Chicago, just like we have no crime in D.C.,” he told reporters Monday.

We can conclude from how quickly California’s elected Democrats embraced the disenfranchisement of millions of California voters that these politicians are innately dishonest and have been and will continue to work to destroy our democracy in any way they can — all in the name of saving it.\n\nThe proof that politicians like Lofgren have been rigging California elections for decades is the highly disproportionate percentage of Democrats in the California Legislature and the U.S. House.\n\nNewsom is fond of proclaiming California a leader in many areas.

Newsom and the California Legislature is a slap in the face to the will of California voters, who passed Proposition 10 to establish an independent, nonpartisan redistricting commission to draw our congressional districts. And now, for political reasons, we are asked to suspend this process for the next eight years.\n\nThe fact that this act was literally rammed through with hardly any public hearing or real debate is in itself downright criminal. In other words, they are destroying democracy in order to save it.\n\nI will end with this: Though a registered Republican, I have never been a fan of Donald Trump, who himself acts as if arrogance is a virtue. That said, our governor has taken that same arrogance and turned it into a science.\n\nJohn F.

I still see that potential. But the way we are building AI today is taking us further from that vision.\n\nTraining large-scale AI models consumes massive energy and water. A 2023 University of Massachusetts-Amherst study found that a single model could emit over 626,000 pounds of carbon dioxide.\n\nWe also overlook the labor behind AI. Thousands of underpaid workers in countries like Kenya and the Philippines label toxic content so others can use so-called safe systems. Their trauma is invisible.\n\nIn school, we talked about bias but rarely about climate or labor. That needs to change.\n\nI still hold hope for AI, but hope is not enough. If we do not build ethically now, we may not get another chance.\n\nAadya Madgula\n\nInstead of respect,\nTrump gets laughter\n\nDonald Trump is a bully. His brutal cruelty is usually directed at people who are defenseless against him. Dealing with people like Vladimir Putin, he melts like an ice cube left on a picnic table.\n\nPutin cleaned his clock last week at their meeting in Alaska. Putin then told Trump that his election was stolen because of mail-in ballots. What a laugh they must have had back at the Kremlin.\n\nI don’t think our allies respect him either. They shower him with lavish praise, really over-the-top stuff, and he eats it up. After he’s gone, they probably have a good laugh too.\n\nJim Peterson\nWalnut Creek\n\nTrump’s actions work\nagainst stated goals\n\nDoes anybody see the irony? Donald Trump fires the director of the Bureau of Labor Statistics because the weak jobs report has to be fraudulent — the Trump economy must always be great! At the same time, he is pressuring the Federal Reserve to reduce interest rates, but the Fed is reluctant because of the strength of the economy and strong job growth.\n\nNow that job growth is weakening — the Fed knows that the report is accurate — it is willing to consider cutting interest rates, while Trump undercuts his own goals by looking for a BLS director who will falsify future reports and always show job growth, reducing the Fed’s incentive to cut interest rates.\n\nMerlin Dorfman","summary":"Also: Wrong move &#124; Slap in face &#124; AI and ethics &#124; Trump's 'reward' &#124; Against goals.

All were convicted felons, and Eswatini says it is holding them in solitary confinement until they can be repatriated.\n\nThe applicants in the case, led by the Eswatini Litigation Centre, say that the agreement made with the U.S. was illegal because it was not submitted to parliament for approval and the terms were not disclosed.\n\nThey also say they do not know the condition of the deportees because no one has been allowed access to them.\n\n\"We want the executive to be held accountable, we want transparency dealing with matters of state importance, (and) respect for the rights of all individuals who are in Eswatini regardless of who they may be,\" said lead applicant and lawyer Mzwandile Masuku.\n\nEswatini, an absolute monarchy ruled by King Mswati III, has previously said the deportees pose no threat and that the agreement was based purely on its good relations with Washington.\n\nThe International Organization for Migration told Reuters it had received a request from Eswatini to provide \"post-arrival assistance\" for the deportees, but did not say whether it would accept or what that might entail.\n\n\"We are discussing with Government of Eswatini, their request,\" a spokesperson for the U.N. agency said on Thursday.\n\nTrump aims to deport millions of immigrants who entered the U.S. illegally and his administration has sought to increase removals to third countries.","summary":"Human rights lawyers and activists have sued the government of Eswatini for making a secretive deal with President Donald Trump's administration to accept third-country deportees from the U.S., which they claim was unconstitutional.","url":"https://www.myjoyonline.com/eswatini-govt-faces-court-challenge-for-accepting-us-deportees/","image":"https://www.myjoyonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/image-2105.png","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-08-26 23:29:00","author":"Abubakar Ibrahim,Reuters 29pm","authors":["Abubakar Ibrahim","Reuters 29pm"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gh","sentiment":-0.408}]}
