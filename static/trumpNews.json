Donald’s daughter-in-law, 41, isn’t letting her prominent political position deter her musical aspirations. The Republican National Committee’s co-chair and Florida-based singer Madeline Jaymes collaborated on the new single, “Hero,” paying tribute to emergency first responders. A clip of the three-and-a-half music video went viral on Labor Day, ten days after the song’s release. Sings Trump in the second verse, “Without your bravery, we’re all out of luck/ No, this can’t be denied /You got to be special/ It takes a lot to put you last and everybody first /With your heart they could make gold.” Critics on X clamored to take down Trump’s vocal prowess. Responding to a post by Medias Touch editor-in-chief Ron Filipowski, a Kansas-based Navy veteran groaned, “My dogs were rough-housing until I turned up the volume to hear the voice. They stopped and howled. This is some tone-deaf s—t.” “Autotune doing a lot of heavy lifting here,” noted independent journalist Kelly Scaletta on X. Conservative social media pundit Croaky Caiman responded simply with an image of Donald Trump voters at a Republican rally with gauze taped to their ears. Some claimed Trump’s vocal stylings were so bad that they ought to be made illegal. “Every note is a violation of the Geneva Convention,” dissed comedian Mrs. Betty Bowers while another critic insisted the song was worthy of “a few months” sentencing amid the Trump family’s latest battles in federal court. The Veterans For Responsible Leadership advocacy group mocked the musical hopeful’s earnest attempt, writing, “Pretty brave of Lara Trump to release a music video when she can’t sing. That’s only normal if you’re a nepo RNC Chairwoman.” Trump’s foray into politicized pop stardom comes as the GOP sets its sights on beating their 11th-hour Democratic opponent Kamala Harris in November’s presidential election.","summary":"Donald's 41-year-old daughter-in-law and RNC co-chair is out of tune with social media.","url":"https://nypost.com/2024/09/02/entertainment/lara-trumps-new-song-panned-on-social-media/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/09/Untitled-1.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-02 23:47:59","author":"Hannah Sparks","authors":["Hannah Sparks"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.007},{"id":255489904,"title":"Donald Trump Says He Had 'Every Right' to Interfere in 2020 Presidential Election","text":"Donald Trump may be facing federal and state charges for allegedly trying to interfere with the 2020 presidential election, but he believes his actions were justified. The twice-impeached former president, who lost the 2020 election to President Joe Biden, said in an interview on Fox News’ Life, Liberty & Levin on Sunday, Sept. 1, that he had \"every right\" to interfere with the presidential race. \"It’s so crazy, that my poll numbers go up.

That same month, the state of Georgia also presented a 41-count, 98-page indictment against Trump and 18 other defendants related to the case. Although the former president initially faced 13 felony counts, including racketeering (violation of the Georgia RICO Act), Fulton County Judge Scott McAfee threw out three of the charges in March. Trump went on to say during his appearance on Fox News’ Life, Liberty & Levin that \"this is the worst case of election interference that anyone’s ever seen, certainly in our country.\" \"They do this in Third World countries; they have some of it in South America, but they don’t do it a lot, believe it or not.

The information you need to know, sent directly to you: Download the CTV News App Her comments came during a rally before cheering union members marking Labour Day in the industrial city of Pittsburgh, where Harris said U.S. Steel was \"an historic American company and it is vital for our country to maintain strong American steel companies.\" \"U.S. Steel should remain American-owned and American-operated, and I will always have the backs of America’s steelworkers,” she said. That echoes Biden, who repeated Monday what he's said since March — that he opposes U.S. Steel's would-be sale to Nippon, believing it would hurt the country's steelworkers. It's little surprise that Harris would overlap with Biden on the issue, but nonetheless constitutes a major policy position for the vice-president, who has offered relatively few of them since Biden abandoned his reelection bid and endorsed his vice-president in July. Biden took the stage first and was met with chants of “Thank You, Joe” as he and Harris appeared in an International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers hall. The president called Harris the only “rational” choice for president in November. He said choosing her to be vice-president was the “single best” decision of his presidency and told the union members that electing her will be “the best decision you will ever make.” Biden also started to say, “Kamala Harris and I are going to build on this” as if he were still running and she was his running mate — but he corrected himself. It underscored just how much the race has changed and how Harris has been careful to balance presenting herself as “a new way forward” while remaining intensely loyal to Biden and the policies he has pushed. Her delivery is very different — and in some cases she's pushed to move faster than Biden's administration — but the overall goal of expanding government programs to buoy the middle class is the same. “We know this is going to be a tight race till the very end,” Harris told the Pittsburgh crowd. The joint rally with Biden was Harris' second of the day and followed Pittsburgh's Labor Day parade, one of the country's largest. It was their first joint appearance at a campaign event since the election shakeup six weeks ago. Democratic presidential nominee U.S. Vice-President Kamala Harris speaks at a campaign rally in Savannah, Ga., Thursday, Aug. 29, 2024. (Jacquelyn Martin/AP Photo) Harris opened her Labor Day campaigning solo with an event in Detroit, where hundreds of audience members wore bright yellow union shirts and hoisted “Union strong” signs. The vice-president said “every person in our nation has benefited” from unions' work. \"Everywhere I go, I tell people, ‘Look, you may not be a union member, you’d better thank a union member,” Harris said, noting that collective bargaining by organized labor helped secure the five-day work week, sick pay and other key benefits and solidify safer working conditions. “When unions are strong, America is strong,” she said. The 81-year-old Biden has spent most of his lengthy political career forging close ties with organized labor. The White House said he asked to introduce Harris in Pittsburgh — instead of the usual other way around — because he wanted to highlight her record of supporting union workers. In addition to opposing the Nippon Steel sale, Biden has endorsed expanding tariffs on imported Chinese steel — a rare instance of political overlap with Donald Trump, the Republican presidential nominee, who has cheered steeper foreign tariffs on many imports. Still, in a statement Monday, U.S. Steel said it remains “committed to the transaction with Nippon Steel, which is the best deal for our employees, shareholders, communities, and customers.” America Votes: Latest U.S. election news and analysis from a Canadian perspective “The partnership with Nippon Steel, a long-standing investor in the United States from our close ally Japan, will strengthen the American steel industry, American jobs, and American supply chains, and enhance the U.S. steel industry’s competitiveness and resilience against China,” the company said, noting that it employs nearly 4,000 people in Pennsylvania alone. David B. Burritt, U.S. Steel’s president and CEO, said Nippon Steel has announced plans to invest “approximately $1.3 billion in U. S. Steel union-represented facilities, on top of the $1.4 billion capital commitment they previously announced.” The Harris campaign released a statement countering that sentiment from David McCall, president of the United Steelworkers union, who said Harris' opposition to the sale “once again made it clear that she will always stand up for steelworkers.” The 59-year-old Harris has sought to appeal to voters by positioning herself as a break from former president Trump's acerbic rhetoric while also looking to move beyond the Biden era. Harris events feel very different from Biden's, which usually featured small crowds. But the vice-president's agenda includes the same issues he's championed: capping the cost of prescription drugs, defending the Affordable Care Act, growing the economy, helping families afford child care — and now her position on the sale of U.S. Steel. The vice-president has promised to work to lower grocery store costs to help fight inflation. She's moved faster than Biden in some cases, calling for using tax cuts and incentives to encourage home ownership and ending federal taxes on tips for service industry employees. But she's also offered relatively few specifics on major policies, instead continuing to side with Biden on top issues. Harris appeared onstage with Biden after the president addressed the opening night of last month's Democratic National Convention, but they had not shared a microphone at a political event since Biden himself was running against Trump. At that time, the campaign was using Harris mostly as its chief spokeswoman for abortion rights, an issue they believe can help them win in November as restrictions grow and health care worsens for women following the fall of Roe v. Wade. Top headlines on Canadian politics, all in one place For more than 3 1/2 years, Harris has been one of Biden's chief validators. Now the tables are turned, as Harris looks to lean on Biden — a native of Scranton, Pennsylvania — to help win the potentially decisive state. Although the vice-president has appeared more forceful in speaking about the plight of civilians in Gaza, as Israel's war against Hamas there nears the 11-month mark, she also has endorsed Biden's efforts to arm Israel and bring about a hostage deal and ceasefire. Israel said Sunday that it had recovered the bodies of six hostages captured during Hamas’ Oct. 7 attack that ignited the Gaza war, including Israeli-American Hersh Goldberg-Polin. The revelation prompted thousands of Israelis to demonstrate in the streets, demanding a cease-fire deal. Before appearing together in Pittsburgh, Biden and Harris met in the White House Situation Room with the U.S. hostage deal negotiating team. From there she went to Detroit before their joint appearance later Monday. “History will show what we here know: Joe Biden has been one of the most transformative presidents,\" Harris said in Pittsburgh. “And as we know Joe still has a lot of work to do.”","summary":"Kamala Harris says they oppose U.S. Steel's sale to Japan during a campaign event with Joe Biden in Pittsburgh on Monday.","url":"https://www.ctvnews.ca/world/harris-says-she-opposes-u-s-steel-s-sale-to-japanese-firm-during-campaign-event-with-biden-1.7022912","image":"https://www.ctvnews.ca/content/dam/ctvnews/en/images/2024/9/2/kamala-harris-joe-biden-cammapgin-event-1-7022914-1725320258577.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-02 23:41:26","author":"Colleen Long, Erin B.

The song, “Hero”, was first released in May but Trump, and co-singer Madeline Jaymes, only released the music video late last month. It features moody shots of Trump and Jaymes singing in a music studio and, at times, also on a fire escape. The video is cut with a photo montage of real firefighters, and what seems to be staged footage of firefighters rescuing people. It’s unclear when Trump filmed the music video (the earliest sneak peek was posted in July.) The duo makes a heartfelt tribute to firefighters, over some heavy autotune. “You’re going through the fire, and the flames getting higher. You’re my hero. You’re my hero,” they sing. “You’re climbing up the ladder and the screams getting louder. You’re my hero. You’re my hero.” Despite the emotional lyrics, some on social media appeared to find Trump’s voice distracting. On YouTube, the top comments were less than complimentary. “Someone who cares about Lara needs to be honest and tell her she can’t sing,” one person wrote. “After hearing this, I miss Yoko Ono,” another person commented. On Instagram, a commenter called out Trump for being “the rich adult version” of “kids who got participation trophies.” “Guys, I’m starting to think Lara Trump has a “music career” only because her last name is Trump,” an X user joked. Trump, who is married to Eric Trump, has been releasing music for nearly a year now, starting with her infamous rendition of Tom Petty’s “I Won’t Back Down”. Since then, she has released two original songs, “Hero” and “Anything is Possible”. In between her musical releases, Trump has been busy with her political career. Earlier this year, she was tapped to co-chair the RNC with former North Carolina Republican Party chair Michael Whatley. That was thanks to an influential endorsement from her father-in-law, the Republican Party nominee for president. During her RNC acceptance speech, Trump promised to “work hard” to get her father-in-law re-elected and promised to spend “every single penny” toward getting him back in the White House. For the first half of the year, polling showed the former president ahead of President Joe Biden in most swing states.

Trafalgar, which polled between Aug. 28-30, sees Trump sweeping 44 electoral votes from the pivotal Blue Wall states in November, eking out narrow wins in Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin inside the polls’ margins of error. Insider Advantage handled polling in four other battlegrounds between Aug. 29-31, with Arizona, Nevada and North Carolina going to Trump. To be sure, each of these states remains a statistical dead heat — meaning they could ultimately go either way come election day. However, the polling is a departure from recent polling that shows Vice President Kamala Harris making gains in the states that will decide the election. In the Wolverine State, Trafalgar has the former president scoring a narrow victory, 47% to 46.6%. Pennsylvania shows a wider Trump lead: 47% to 45%. While winning by 2% wouldn’t constitute a landslide, it would be a bigger win than Trump’s modest 0.72% victory in the state eight years ago. Meanwhile, Wisconsin splits the two extremes, with Trump over Harris 47% to 46%. Though that margin seems narrow, considering that Trump won the state by 0.77% in 2016 and lost it by 0.63% in 2020. It’s worth noting that the RealClearPolitics polling average currently shows all three of these states going toward Harris, with Michigan having shifted on Aug. 29. In Arizona, Trump leads 49% to 48% in the race for 11 electoral votes, a smaller margin than the 0.3% Biden win four years ago, and one that would trigger an automatic recount in the state. Trump leads by more than 12 points with independents. A 9.5% lead with independents buoys Trump in Nevada to a 48%-47% lead, where six electoral votes are at stake. Trump lost the state in both 2016 and 2020. Meanwhile, Trump leads Harris 49% to 48% in North Carolina, less than the 1.34% margin of victory he secured in 2020, and despite Harris leading with independents 50% to 46%. He could take 16 electoral votes in the Tar Heel state. Georgia represents the only deviation, with Harris up 48% to 47.6% in the race for 16 electoral votes. She holds the smallest possible lead with independents, 45.2% to 45.1%.","summary":"The surveys have Trump narrowly winning six of the seven swing states that will decide the 2024 election.","url":"https://nypost.com/2024/09/02/us-news/latest-swing-state-polls-suggest-trump-could-score-decisive-victory-against-kamala-harris/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/09/latest-swing-state-polls-suggest-88818449.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/YqMTVu0D-RyIcpnTz.mp4","publish_date":"2024-09-02 22:44:35","author":"A.g.

Pritzker, 59, argued that Trump, 78, bested former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton in at least one of their three 2016 presidential debates and that despite Harris being a “tremendous person with great capability” she should be cautious on stage with the former president. “We saw that he won the debate against Hillary Clinton when he ran the first time,” the governor said. “He’s not to be underestimated.” “We shouldn’t be thinking that somehow Kamala Harris has a greater ability to win a debate than Donald Trump,” Pritzker continued. “They’re going to come in as significant rivals with very, very different points of view.” Pritzker explained that one of Harris’ keys to victory in the showdown will be conveying her message without “getting flummoxed” by Trump.

This lack of concern serves as a reminder of the apparent disregard by the Biden administration for the victims of preventable crimes committed by illegal immigrants. Like many others, the Morin family deserves recognition and action from their leaders to prevent such tragedies from happening again. [Emphasis added] Oppositely, Morin’s brother spoke at the Republican National Convention (RNC) in July at the invitation of former President Donald Trump, and Morin’s mother recently joined Trump at a campaign press conference at the United States-Mexico border. On August 5, 2023, Morin went for a walk at the Ma & Pa Heritage Trail in Harford County, Maryland. When Morin did not return home, her boyfriend, Richard Tobin, reported her missing. The following day, her body was found on the side of the trail. On June 15, 2024, the Tulsa Police Department arrested 23-year-old Victor Antonio Martinez Hernandez, an illegal alien from El Salvador with ties to the MS-13 gang, in connection to Morin’s murder. Prosecutors have alleged that Martinez Hernandez brutally raped, bludgeoned, and strangled Morin to death in what they say is the most horrific case in Harford County history. Martinez Hernandez was indicted in July on first and second-degree murder charges, and on rape, sexual offenses, and kidnapping charges. Martinez Hernandez, who remains in police custody, will stand trial in October. Martinez Hernandez is among more than two million known illegal alien got-aways who have successfully crossed the border on Biden and Harris’s watch. On three occasions in 2023, Border Patrol agents apprehended Martinez Hernandez — twice in January in New Mexico and Texas, as well as once in February in New Mexico. On each occasion, he was returned to Mexico. Sometime after he was last returned to Mexico, Martinez Hernandez crossed the border and made his way to California, where he allegedly assaulted a woman and her child. He later traveled to Maryland, where he was accused of raping and murdering Morin. Before crossing the border, Martinez Hernandez was accused of murdering a woman in his native El Salvador after leaving a bar with the victim. The woman’s body was discovered days later.

How can people vote for this..\" The meme is just the latest in a series of Trump's attempts to paint himself as a superhero. In 1996, Trump was featured as Superman in a diorama next to the cake at his 50th birthday party. 20 years later, in 2016, a pro-Trump super PAC even spent $25,000 on a digital billboard depicting the former president as the Man of Steel. Trump's eldest son, Donald Jr., in 2017, also posted a bizarre image of a fake Time cover featuring his father as a bearded Superman. According to The Daily Beast, Trump's associates have long attempted to link the real estate magnate-turned-political firebrand to the Man of Steel. In late 2022, the Republican leader released a set of digital trading cards that featured him in a superhero costume (complete with a capital 'T'). According to Variety, his eyeballs also fired lasers. Interestingly, Trump was apparently the inspiration for the 1980s reboot of Superman's arch-enemy, the corporate villain, Lex Luthor. John Byrne, the writer who changed Luthor from a standard mad scientist to a depiction of Wall Street greed, stated in 2017, \"Of course, Donald Trump was our model.\" Trump's habit of posting AI-generated or altered images of himself as a superhero is also part of a bigger trend. He has flooded his Truth Social account with various manipulated images. This includes ones depicting him riding a lion, sitting with Jesus Christ in court, and smiling with Black supporters to appeal to his base and provoke his opponents.","summary":"The image shows Trump&#39;s head pasted onto a member of the Justice League, and as one would have expected, the internet chimed in with mixed reviews.","url":"https://www.inquisitr.com/donald-trump-posts-poorly-edited-meme-of-himself-elon-musk-and-jd-vance-as-superheroes","image":"https://dab57h0r8ahff.cloudfront.net/713666/uploads/b615ca10-6931-11ef-8574-a967d9ae1c06_1200_630.jpeg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-02 22:15:01","author":"INQUISITR,Shraddha","authors":["INQUISITR","Shraddha"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.038},{"id":255486798,"title":"Tim Walz compares Donald Trump to school bullies with ‘politics of fear’","text":"Tim Walz compared Donald Trump to school bullies as he criticised the former president for running on \"the politics of fear.\" Kamala Harris's VP pick drew on his background as a high school social studies teacher and football coach in his Labor Day speech on Monday, 2 September. \"Donald Trump has been running on the politics of fear.

The judge will decide on Sept. 16 Trump’s request to set aside the jury’s verdict based on immunity claims. The attorneys made reference to special counsel Jack Smith’s reworked indictment in Trump’s election interference case issued in response to a U.S. Supreme Court opinion in July that found presidents are immune from prosecution over their official acts. “There is no good reason to sentence President Trump prior to November 5,” the letter stated. Trump’s lawyers said the sentencing is on a “needlessly accelerated timeline” compared to other special counsel-related cases that are addressing similar issues. The special counsel’s office received a superseding indictment from a “new grand jury that had not previously heard evidence in this case,” the letter stated. Trump last week asked a federal court in Manhattan to take up his state criminal case after the Supreme Court’s decision, adding that the state court should not sentence him until that issue is resolved. Trump’s attorneys argued in the letter to Merchan that his court should not make any “substantiate orders” until the federal court renders its decision to move the case. A notice posted on the federal court’s docket on Aug. 31 showed that the request was rejected as “deficient.” The court said it sent back the filing because attorneys did not include written permission from prosecutors or the court and failed to meet other requirements.

But by Monday, more of them — us — were able to branch out a little bit and catch up on lesser-known titles that don’t yet have a backer. One such film, the fest’s second screening of which just let out at the Werner Herzog Theatre, is called September 5. (It had its world premiere at the Venice Film Festival last Thursday and its North American premiere here last Saturday, shortly after which its relevance and timeliness was reinforced by tragic real-world events.) And here’s the kicker: it might be the strongest narrative film of the entire fest! It certainly left many festivalgoers — industry insiders and civilians — absolutely buzzing as they left the venue. If/when this 94-minute flick — the story of ABC Sports’ coverage of the 1972 Munich Olympics terrorist attack on Israeli athletes — lands a top-tier distributor, it could seriously contend in numerous Oscar categories. I’m talking about best picture (it’s hard to find 10 worthy nominees this year, but this film, which counts Sean Penn as a producer, would certainly be one), best director (Tim Fehlbaum, a young Swiss filmmaker who I had never heard of before), best actor (Peter Sarsgaard, who plays the legendary ABC Sports chief Roone Arledge, and has rather criminally never been nominated before), best supporting actor (John Magaro, who plays the network’s young coordinating producer for Olympics coverage, Geoff Mason), best original screenplay (Fehlbaum and Moritz Binder) and best production design, at least. Distributors have, of late, disappointingly avoided many worthy sales titles that touch on politically-sensitive topics like abortion, Ukraine and Donald Trump, and so some may be hesitant to go anyhwere near the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. But I am confident that at least one of them is going to be smart enough to nab this film, in which there is no argument about who wronged who — and in which one is also offered a fascinating, thrilling, haunting look at journalists, journalism and journalistic ethics.

Harris “is expected to say that U.S. Steel should remain domestically owned and operated and stress her commitment to always have the backs of American steel workers,” her campaign says. That's similar to Biden, who has said that he opposed U.S. Steel's would-be sale to Nippon in order to better “maintain strong American steel companies powered by American steel workers.\" But it still constitutes a major policy position for the vice president, who has offered relatively few of them since Biden abandoned his reelection bid and endorsed Harris in July. Harris has been careful to balance presenting herself as “a new way forward” while remaining intensely loyal to Biden and the policies he has pushed. Her delivery is very different — and in some cases she's pushed to move faster than Biden's administration — but the overall goal of expanding government programs to buoy the middle class is the same. The vice president began marking Labor Day with a rally at a high school gymnasium in Detroit, where hundreds of audience members wore bright yellow union shirts and hoisted “Union strong” signs. She noted that one of the nation's first Labor Day parades happened in Detroit around 140 years ago and that “every person in our nation has benefited” from unions' work. \"Everywhere I go I tell people, ‘Look, you may not be a union member, you’d better thank a union member,” Harris said, noting that collective bargaining by organized labor helped secure the five-day work week, sick-pay and other key benefits and solidify safer working conditions. “When unions are strong, America is strong,” she said. In addition to opposing the Nippon Steel sale, Biden has endorsed expanding tariffs on imported Chinese steel — a rare instance of political overlap with Republican former President Donald Trump, who has cheered steeper foreign tariffs on many imports. Still, in a statement Monday, U.S. Steel said it remains “committed to the transaction with Nippon Steel, which is the best deal for our employees, shareholders, communities, and customers.” “The partnership with Nippon Steel, a long-standing investor in the United States from our close ally Japan, will strengthen the American steel industry, American jobs, and American supply chains, and enhance the U.S. steel industry’s competitiveness and resilience against China,” the company said, noting that it employs nearly 4,000 people in Pennsylvania alone.

You better thank a union member for sick leave, paid family leave, and vacation time pic.twitter.com/DHu3oRVXuo— Kamala HQ (@KamalaHQ) September 2, 2024 Harris said that as president, she will strengthen labor laws, including a ban on union-busting activity, some of which is already outlawed. She also touted her goal of creating an “opportunity economy,” which she claimed would allow citizens “not just to get by” but to “get ahead.” Former President Donald Trump wants to pull the United States back to a time “before workers had the freedom to organize,” Harris warned her supporters. The vice president harped on Trump administration policies, accusing the former president of blocking overtime benefits “for millions of workers.” Trump supported “so-called right to work laws,” Harris said, to loud boos aimed at Trump. Harris’s claim about Trump and overtime pay is one she and Walz have perpetuated, but PolitiFact recently deemed it “misleading.” The claim stems from a judge blocking an Obama administration policy on overtime rules during the Trump administration. Instead of challenging the judge, Trump set his own policy that extended overtime benefits to workers. However, it included millions fewer than what the Obama-era policy would have had. Harris’s busy day on the campaign trail also included a stop at a labor union hall in Pittsburgh with President Joe Biden. Meanwhile, Walz spoke to a friendly crowd in Milwaukee in front of a podium with a sign that read “Laborfest.” Trump, for his part, wrote in a Labor Day message on Truth Social that “under Comrade Kamala Harris,” average citizens are acutely feeling the painful effects of high inflation on a holiday weekend. He also boasted about his administration’s achievements for workers.

For sick leave, you better thank a union. For paid leave, you better thank a union for vacation time.\"How Harris Regained Momentum With UnionsRepublicans have made inroads with union members in recent election years, despite labor leadership consistently endorsing Democrats at the top of the ticket. Exit polling in 2016 found that union households supported then-Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton over Trump by only 8 points—in comparison, in the 2012 election, Democrats won union households by 18 points, per the Roper Center for Public Opinion Research at Cornell University.President Joe Biden improved Democrats' numbers among union households when he beat Trump in 2020, winning the voting block by 16 points, according to exit polls. But polling earlier this election season showed that Biden and Trump were nearly neck-and-neck for the union vote this fall, posing risks for Democrats in some key battleground states that Biden flipped by a narrow margin just four years prior.Harris, however, has secured endorsements from some of the biggest unions in the U.S., including the United Auto Workers Union, the American Federal of Teachers and the National Education Association, all of which joined her on stage in Detroit, Michigan, on Monday, where the vice president again vowed to fight for union workers if elected to the Oval Office.\"We celebrate unions because unions helped build America, and unions helped build America's middle class,\" Harris told attendees.Recent polling has also shown Harris reclaiming the Democrats' lead with union voters. A survey from Emerson College released on August 16 found that the vice president was ahead of Trump by 14.8 percentage points among union voters in Pennsylvania (56.8 percent to 42 percent). Back in July, a similar poll found the former president leading union voters by 5 percentage points while Biden was still in the race.Harris also received promising numbers out of Michigan in an Emerson College poll released late last week—while 30.1 percent of union households said they would vote for Harris if the election were held today, Trump trailed by double digits, earning 20 percent of the vote. The survey was based on the responses of 800 likely voters with a margin of error of 3.4 percent.Despite the momentum, the race between Trump and Harris remains tight—RealClearPolling reports that Harris has just a 0.5 percent lead across polling in Pennsylvania, and is beating Trump on average by 1.1 percentage points in Michigan. As of Monday, the vice president was leading the race across national polls by 2.3 percent (47.1 percent to 44.8 percent), per RealClearPolling's aggregate.\"Let's not pay too much attention to the polls,\" Harris told rally-goers in Detroit. \"Let's know, like labor always does, we are out here running like we are the underdog in this race because we know what we are fighting for.\"Biden is slated to join Harris in Pittsburgh later in the day Monday at the city's Labor Day parade, alongside Pennsylvania Democrats Governor Josh Shapiro and Senator Bob Casey.Newsweek reached out to Trump's campaign via email for comment on Harris' campaign stops.","summary":"Union households could play a key role in either candidate securing the battlegrounds states of Michigan and Pennsylvania this fall.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/where-kamala-harris-donald-trump-stand-union-workers-polls-1947726","image":"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2462757/where-harris-trump-stand-among-union-voters.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-02 21:32:29","author":"Kaitlin Lewis","authors":["Kaitlin Lewis"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.092},{"id":255484614,"title":"Several cars in Tim Walz’s motorcade involved in crash leaving one staffer with broken arm","text":"Several cars in vice presidential candidate Tim Walz’s motorcade crashed on Monday afternoon, leaving one person injured. The crash happened just before 1pm local time as Kamala Harris’s running mate was en route to a Labor Day celebration in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. A staff member of the traveling press pool who was inside the press van appears to have a broken arm. Other reporters suffered scrapes and bruises, while one reported a bloody nose. Another person in the van was concerned they had a concussion but continued on to the event, the Associated Press reports. Walz’s vehicle was not involved in the crash. The press van was hit from behind, which caused it to lurch forward into the next car, according to the pool report. President Joe Biden later called Walz from Air Force One to check in following the crash. Harris also checked in with Walz as she left a Labor Day event in Detroit, Michigan. A similar incident happened as the Harris-Walz motorcade traveled through Georgia last week. On August 28, Savannah, Georgia police officer David Bates crashed while riding a motorcycle as part of the motorcade. He was injured and transported to a local hospital. Bates was reportedly in stable condition as of late last week. The Harris-Walz campaign is out in full force this Labor Day to win over voters in swing states. Harris was set to appear in Pennsylvania after her event in Detroit. Her husband, Second Gentlemen Doug Emhoff, was also set to appear in Newport News, Virginia. Meanwhile, Donald Trump’s campaign is holding a single virtual event to celebrate Labor Day with the United Auto Workers union. The union, however, has endorsed Harris. The Democratic National Committee is also running 19 digital billboards in the swing states of Michigan, Wisconsin, and Pennsylvania this Labor Day. The billboards, which will appear in both English and Spanish, feature a photo of Trump with the caption, “Trump’s an anti-union scab!” The billboards are an homage to UAW President Shawn Fain’s appearance at the DNC in Chicago, Illinois last month. During his speech at the convention, Fain wore a shirt that read, “Trump is a scab. Vote Harris”. “We were really kind of channeling Shawn Fain with that choice,” Brad Woodhouse, a senior adviser to the DNC, told HuffPost. Harris currently has a 3.2-point lead over Trump, according to the latest average of national polls. The vice president has a growing lead in six major swing states, including those that she and her team are visiting this Labor Day.","summary":"Several reporters were said to have suffered cuts and bruises, while one had a bloodied nose and another thought they may have sustained a concussion","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/tim-walz-motorcade-crash-injuries-b2605898.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2024/09/02/22/newFile-1.jpg?width=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-02 21:20:31","author":"Katie Hawkinson","authors":["Katie Hawkinson"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.361},{"id":255484640,"title":"Ex Cop Attacked At Capitol Harry Dunn Stunned By Planned Jan. 6 Awards Event At Trump Golf Club","text":"Former police officer Harry Dunn, who was attacked during the violent storming of the Capitol at the end of the Trump administration, is furious about the planned January 6 insurrectionist awards gala and fundraiser at Donald Trump's New Jersey golf club.The former president had \"expressed interest\" in attending the controversial event that was to hosted at his Bedminster club to honor and raise money for lawbreakers who stormed the Capitol after Trump lost the 2020 presidential election, a spokesperson told NBC last week.But the event, scheduled to take place this Thursday, was suddenly postponed over the weekend, with no future date announced, according to the website for the \"awards gala,\"which prominently features the former president.

Frank Luntz appeared on CNN, where he was asked what the presidential candidates had left to do in the final stretch between now and the election. “The debate is everything,” Luntz said. CNN anchor John Berman then asked him to elaborate. “Everything,” Luntz repeated. “When the voter sees side by side the two candidates and they listen to what they say, not just the answers, it’s the body language. Is there contempt? Does someone fold their arms? Do they look at the individual when they’re speaking? Do they seem presidential in their approach?” The upcoming debate has been scheduled for September 10 in Philadelphia. There has been some recent controversy over the debate's rules, as the Trump and Harris campaigns disagreed over microphones. Harris's campaign wants the microphones to remain live throughout the debate, which is a departure from previous debate rules. The Associated Press obtained the debate rules from a senior Trump official, which reportedly said there would be no live audience, no written notes and that the mics would be muted when the other candidate is speaking. The Harris campaign told the AP that they are still discussing the mic issue with ABC. “It’s interesting that Trump’s handlers keep insisting on muting him, despite the candidate himself saying the opposite,” Harris spokesman Ian Sams told the AP. “Why won’t they just do what the candidate wants?” If the mics are live, Trump will have the opportunity to interrupt Harris and potentially derail the debate, a point Luntz highlighted during his CNN segment. “For Trump, can he keep quiet? Can he actually listen to a response, or does he have to respond to everything,” Luntz said. “For Harris, does she seem open-minded? Does she seem willing to take in information not just project?” Trump recently said he didn't care if the mics were muted, and went on to talk about his disdain for ABC News. “Each of them has different goals for that debate, but each one, in the end, has to prove that they’re ready, not just for that moment, but voters are thinking ‘who do I want to represent me two years from now, three or four years from now?” Luntz continued. As for Harris, Luntz said the vice president would have to show the public that she has improved since her 2020 Democratic primary debate - where she was panned. “She has to prove she has the capability to do it and Trump has to prove that he doesn’t treat her rudely, obnoxiously, because he lost a lot of female voters in 2020 who would have voted for him over policy but would not vote for him because of his persona,” Luntz said.","summary":"“When the voter sees side by side the two candidates and they listen to what they say, not just the answers, it’s the body language,” a pollster said. “Do they seem presidential in their approach?”","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/republican-pollster-trump-harris-debate-b2605906.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2024/08/31/15/SEI219322298.jpg?width=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/mrXN5kfu-4VHSaSK0.mp4","publish_date":"2024-09-02 21:11:31","author":"Graig Graziosi","authors":["Graig Graziosi"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.258},{"id":255488210,"title":"Kamala Harris Loses Support in Post-Democrat Convention Poll","text":"Vice President Kamala Harris has lost support after the Democratic National Convention (DNC) in Chicago, according to a Redfield & Wilton Strategies poll.

This marks a net one-point swing Trump’s way, showing no bump for Harris since she accepted her party’s nomination. The current poll also shows that Trump’s latest indictment over his challenge of the 2020 election results has not harmed his prospects. Moreover, the survey reveals how Robert F.

The share of undecided Americans in this poll is four points higher than the August 21 poll, which had Kennedy at three percent of support. The option “other” has also increased by four percent, indicating lesser-known third-party candidates have drawn some of Kennedy’s support.

During former President Donald Trump ‘s administration, her office under the U.S. Department of Agriculture was told it would be moving. About 75 people were going to be relocated to Kansas City, Missouri, Dodson said, but less than 40 actually moved. A rushed process that failed to consider the need to find homes, jobs for spouses and schools for children prompted some retirements, she said, and some took other federal jobs, hurting the agency in the end. Now, with Trump proposing the relocation of up to 100,000 federal jobs from Virginia, Maryland and the District of Columbia under his Agenda 47 plan, concerns about being abruptly moved are again troubling federal workers. The Republican’s proposals stir anxiety in the midst of an unusually competitive U.S. Senate race in heavily Democratic Maryland that could determine control of the Senate, with even the Republican candidate calling the plans “crazy.” The proposals also could hinder Trump’s chances to win Virginia, a state he lost in 2016 and 2020, where a U.S. Senate seat widely seen as safely Democratic is also on the ballot. “It’s causing a lot of anxiety, a lot of discomfort within the workforce, as you are faced with these strong, negative, anti-federal worker stances and this uncertainty of what might happen to your job, your home and your livelihood,” said Dodson, who is acting vice president of American Federation of Government Employees local 3403, which represents the USDA’s Economic Research Service. And concerns don’t end there. Federal workers also are worried about “Project 2025,” a proposed overhaul of the federal government crafted by longtime Trump allies that would eliminate thousands of jobs and remove civil service protections for some federal workers. The former president has repeatedly distanced himself from the proposal this summer. But the plan still worries Michael Knowles. He said it calls for making the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services’ D.C. presence “skeletal, and agency employees with operational or security roles should be rotated out to offices throughout the United States.” Knowles, who is president of AFGE local 1924, said most of his members took an oath to uphold the Constitution and faithfully administer the laws of the United States. He said the members, who all work in the National Capital Region, are committed to the mission of government service. “And they would do what they need to do to carry out that mission,” Knowles said. “But I think the employees would look dimly on arbitrary or capricious decisions that didn’t seem to make any business or operational sense.” Trump’s campaign did not return requests for comment. The District of Columbia has the largest number of federal civilian employees, with about 160,700 jobs, according to the Congressional Research Service. Maryland and Virginia are in the top four jurisdictions, with about 138,940 in Maryland and 140,400 in Virginia. California has about 142,040. The proposals to move a large number of federal workers infuriate local leaders in the suburbs of Washington in both Maryland and Virginia. In Maryland, a heavily blue state where Trump is deeply unpopular, it’s viewed by many as retaliation by the former president, who received only 32% of the vote there in 2020. Trump made headlines while he was in office when he denigrated Baltimore, Maryland’s largest city, as a “disgusting, rat and rodent infested mess.” Angela Alsobrooks, the chief executive of Prince George’s County who is the Democratic nominee in the Maryland U.S. Senate race, described Trump’s positions on the federal workforce “as yet another reason that we absolutely must put Donald Trump in the rearview mirror.” “Former President Trump is a ruthless leader, retaliatory in all his ways, and what he talks about in terms of really harming federal workers is evil,” Alsobrooks said after returning from the Democratic National Convention last month. Former Gov. Larry Hogan, her Republican opponent, condemned the relocation proposals as “crazy.” He said they “would be devastating to the region, the state of Maryland and bad for the federal government.” “It’s like, you know, Trump trying to turn the federal government into one of his failed casinos, where he thinks he can do whatever he wants,” Hogan, who has long been one of the GOP’s fiercest Trump critics, said in an interview. “I think it would undermine our entire democracy.” Businesses that provide services to the thousands of federal workers fear the ripple-effect threat of the proposed changes. At Census Auto Repair & Sales, for example, across the street from the U.S. Census Bureau’s headquarters in Suitland, Maryland, service manager Tay Gibson says his shop would feel the impact directly. “I would hate to see the federal workers leave,” Gibson said. “That would be business leaving as well, and that would affect small businesses like myself.” Libby Garvey, chair of the Arlington County Board in the Virginia suburbs of Washington, emphasized the potential hit on the local economy. “If a large proportion of (tax payers) suddenly lose their jobs (or have to) move away, that takes a terrible, major hit to our local budget, which impacts our ability to pave the roads, make sure the water is clean, provide public safety, fire, police, emergency personnel and provide good schools,” Garvey said. Karen Hult, a political science professor at Virginia Tech, said the move could harm Trump’s chances in Virginia. “Federal workers around Northern Virginia, and in the D.C. metro area generally, are, in fact, a bit of a voting bloc,” Hult said “The other thing, of course, are all the contractors — the beltway bandits. They make a big difference, too.” But Hult also said the idea of relocating federal workers could resonate with Virginians outside of the northern part of the state, who may feel a distrust of the D.C. bureaucracy. Filipe Campante, a Bloomberg Distinguished professor at Johns Hopkins University who focuses on political economy and urban and regional issues, noted that there’s a reason why capital cities exist, with the presence of federal employees nearby. Physical presence, he said, is necessary for face-to-face interactions that are important to maintaining accountability. While Trump and his supporters see the relocation as a positive in terms of moving the “deep state” away from the seat of government, Campante said it also has a downside. “I think it is a positive factor for accountability that you have civil servants also operating as a check on political appointees, and this would be weakened by moving these people away from where the center of the government is, so I think from that perspective it would reduce accountability,” Campante said. “Obviously, then, it depends on whether you think this accountability is good or not.”","summary":"Worries of being uprooted from their jobs have returned with Donald Trump proposing the relocation of up to 100,000 federal jobs if he wins in November.","url":"https://www.centralmaine.com/2024/09/02/federal-workers-around-nations-capital-worry-over-trumps-plans-to-send-some-of-them-elsewhere/","image":"https://w2pcms.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2024/09/Election_2024_Federal_Jobs_16047.jpg?w=1000","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-02 21:09:42","author":"Olivia Diaz And Brian Witte,OLIVIA DIAZ and BRIAN WITTE - Associated Press","authors":["Olivia Diaz And Brian Witte","OLIVIA DIAZ and BRIAN WITTE - Associated Press"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.089},{"id":255484416,"title":"Is JFK's great niece the woman to make Ben Affleck smile again after his split with J-Lo?","text":"It is a truth universally acknowledged that a single Hollywood star in possession of a good fortune must be in want of a wife. And so it is that – even though his second wife Jennifer Lopez filed for divorce only last month – Ben Affleck is reportedly being paired off with a new woman. She is Kathleen Kennedy, universally known as Kick: a petite, sparky scion of the Kennedy dynasty who loves beer, boats, shooting pool, smoking and dogs. We'll come to the hoo-ha over the exact nature of their relationship shortly – though, in deliciously Hollywood phrasing, well-placed sources tell me they are 'intimate but not romantic' and have been seeing each other since June. Ben's team, however, denies any suggestion they are dating. But the fact is that Kick Kennedy, 36, would appear to be perfectly suited to the role of pulling Affleck, 52, from the -wreckage following the end of his 'forever', second-time-around, fairytale romance with singer and actress J-Lo. There's the lustre of the Kennedy name, impossibly attractive to someone raised in Boston, such as Affleck. Her grandfather was Robert Kennedy, brother of President John F. Kennedy, both of whom were shot by assassins. Her father, Robert F. Kennedy Jr, is a controversial figure in US politics who recently appalled most of the Kennedy clan by endorsing Donald Trump in his bid for President. There's also been some funny business with a sawn-off whale head, more of which later. It's fair to say that the power, money and influence of the -Kennedys is dazzling, even to a recipient of two Oscars. Would Ben Affleck like to spend the summer hanging out at the Kennedy compound in Hyannisport, -Massachusetts? You bet he would. He would also probably be the least interesting person around the table. Then there's Kick's sad history of being surrounded by addicts. Her stepmother Mary took her own life in 2012 after a long struggle with drugs and drink. An interior designer and philanthropist, she was RFK Jr's second wife. Kick also dated the banking millionaire Matthew Mellon, who died in 2018 of a heart attack, aged 54, after experimenting with the hallucinogenic plant ayahuasca. He had been struggling for years with an addiction to opoids, -latterly Oxycontin, and had been due to go to rehab. Kick described her time with him as 'magic' and was apparently broken-hearted by his sudden death. Affleck, of course, has his own notorious struggles with sobriety, having been to rehab three times for alcohol addiction, most recently in 2018. Kick probably understands the addict's struggle to remain sober better than many – possibly better than J-Lo, who has never really enjoyed alcohol and whose lifestyle was always super-healthy. And then there's Kick's interesting position both inside and -outside the celebrity firmament. She's not – yet – been successful enough at acting to be famous, but she is a celebrity of sorts thanks to her name, and many of her friends are A-listers. Indeed, her younger brother Conor went out with Taylor Swift (who has a house across the street from the Kennedy compound). She has had a number of fairly minor acting roles, including in the comedian Larry David's smash hit TV show Curb Your Enthusiasm, drama series The Newsroom, and comic film Teacher Of The Year. Socialite Kick also appeared as herself in a 2010 episode of Gossip Girl. She has expressed her ambitions to break into films. As she said nearly ten years ago: 'I'm not famous. I'm still just trying to make it, to be an artist, and follow my dreams. Hopefully one day people will come to see me for something that doesn't have to do with my last name. For me, it's just two different things. This is a job. That is my life.' She's nonplussed when people ask what it's like to be a Kennedy – saying that she doesn't know what it would be like not to be one. 'I was born with a sticker – a name – that has made me totally uninterested in the fame factor of success,' she once said. 'I see all my actor friends really going for it in that way because it's such a big part of the job, but it kind of turns me off. I'm frightened of it, or at least . . . unamused.' It appears that her path crossed with Affleck's some time ago. According to the New York Post's Page Six gossip column, the two of them had a fling in early 2020. Reportedly, Kick and Ben were hanging out until he fell for Ana de Armas, his movie co-star in the thriller Deep Water. 'Their friendship has been going on for a while, even before Ana,' one Hollywood insider told Page Six. 'When Ben started seeing Ana in 2020 and chose to quarantine with her during Covid, Kick was less than thrilled.' In the end, Ben and Ana broke up in January 2021. 'Ben is no longer dating Ana,' a source told People magazine at the time. 'She broke it off. 'Their relationship was complicated. Ana doesn't want to be Los Angeles-based and Ben -obviously has to since his kids [with ex-wife Jennifer Garner] live in Los Angeles.' Another source said they were at different points in their lives and Affleck wanted time to 'work on himself'. Then, at some point this year when his two-year marriage to J-Lo, 55, failed, the friendship with Kick was apparently rekindled. In court papers, J-Lo dated their separation to April 26 and reports suggest that Kick and Ben started hanging out, discreetly, in late spring following the split. In mid-May, reports emerged suggesting Affleck had moved out of the £60 million marital home in Beverly Hills and was renting a property in Brentwood, close to where his former wife Garner lives with their three children. On May 31, Lopez announced she was cancelling her summer tour and within a couple of weeks Ben and Kick were spotted together at the Polo Lounge, -Beverly Hills, looking 'very couply'. It's said they have been seen together at other times, with an anonymous article on the celebrity gossip site DeuxMoi claiming he was seen coming and going with an overnight bag with Kick from an apartment complex 'owned by an A-list friend' 'since at least June'. Since then Affleck has bought a home in Pacific Palisades, LA. Multiple outlets in America have claimed that Affleck has been spending time with Kick. However, Jen Allen, a spokes-person for the actor and -filmmaker, said: 'There is no truth to any of it. I don't know if they even know each other.' Kick's representatives have said nothing, and surely will not. As someone who has grown up in the -Kennedy family, she is very wary of the media. As she told Town & Country magazine in 2012, reading stories about the -Kennedys was 'kind of like reading a cartoon strip and there's a character, but it's not me. It's a story that's loosely related to mine.' But in the few interviews she has given, Kick paints herself as a free spirit who smokes and is not averse to using the odd expletive. Born to RFK Jr and his first wife Emily Black in 1988, she has a keen interest in conservation and nature which she attributes to her -controversial father. She shared that when she was six, her father – once a prominent figure of America's environmental movement – heard that a dead whale had washed up in Hyannisport. RFK Jr, who was interested in -studying anatomy, cut the dead whale's head off with a chainsaw and strapped it to the roof of the family car. They then drove five hours to New York. 'Every time we accelerated on the highway, whale juice would pour into the windows of the car, and it was the rankest thing on the planet,' she said. 'We all had plastic bags over our heads with mouth holes cut out. 'People on the highway were giving us the finger, but that was normal day-to-day stuff for us.' As well as attending Stanford University, she made her society debut at the Crillon Ball for debutantes in Paris. Novelist Christopher Buckley, whose daughter has been friends with Kick since kindergarten, told a magazine: 'Our Kick very much takes after her -predecessor [great-aunt Kathleen]: lively, funny, pretty, bright, and full of mischief. If she can manage the -mischief, then the world will be her stage, and it will be a grand entertainment.' That, at least, seems assured.","summary":"It is a truth universally acknowledged that a single Hollywood star in possession of a good fortune must be in want of a wife.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-13805943/inside-life-kick-kennedy-jfk-ben-affleck-j-lo.html?ns_mchannel=rss&ns_campaign=1490&ito=1490","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2024/09/02/22/89201753-0-image-m-64_1725311026996.jpg","video":"https://videos.dailymail.co.uk/video/mol/2024/08/21/3325653533593222000/1024x576_MP4_3325653533593222000.mp4","publish_date":"2024-09-02 21:07:54","author":"Alison Boshoff,Editor","authors":["Alison Boshoff","Editor"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":0.301},{"id":255483362,"title":"Election 2024: Here’s Why North Carolina Has Suddenly Become A Key Swing State","text":"Share to Facebook Share to Twitter Share to Linkedin Topline Vice President Kamala Harris could become only the second Democratic presidential candidate to win North Carolina in more than 40 years as the state has slowly shifted more to the left over the past decade—thanks in part to a growing high-tech corridor. US Vice President and Democratic presidential candidate Kamala Harris speaks at a Labor Day event at ... [+] Northwestern High School in Detroit, Michigan, September 2, 2024. (Photo by JEFF KOWALSKY/AFP via Getty Images) AFP via Getty Images Key Facts Polls show former President Donald Trump and Harris in a virtual tie, with Trump beating her by only a 0.4-point margin in FiveThirtyEight’s polling average and by 0.6 points in RealClearPolitics’ polling average, with a recent Emerson College poll showing Harris trailing by one, and two Morning Consult polls taken last month showing them tied. The Cook Political Report moved North Carolina from “lean Republican” to a “toss up” last week, writing that the state “looks more competitive than ever” since Harris’ entrance into the race, and the Cook Political Report Swing State Project survey taken in late July/early August shows Harris leading Trump by one point, 48% to 47%, after Biden trailed Trump by seven points, 41% to 48%, in the Cook survey taken in May. If Harris wins the state, she has a 96.7% chance of winning the election, according to political analyst Nate Silver’s Voter Power Index, which found Trump would have a 76.6% chance of winning the electoral college if he wins North Carolina. Harris has a 38.5% chance of winning North Carolina, similar to her odds in Georgia (37.4%), and there’s an 86% chance the states will vote together, according to Silver’s model, which considers various demographic characteristics, including age, income, race and education level and the states’ voting history in the past two elections. North Carolina’s shift to the left has largely been credited to a population increase among potential voters who typically back Democrats—including the highly educated—especially from a 5.6% increase since 2020 near the “research triangle” area of Raleigh-Durham-Chapel Hill, according to the Brookings Institution. That area hosts three major research universities—Duke University, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, and North Carolina University—that have also sparked related industries in high tech and the life sciences, and made it the tenth-fastest growing area in the country, according to Brookings. And the overall percentage of North Carolinians with a bachelor’s degree—a Democratic-leaning demographic—has also increased by 1.4 million since 1990, according to a study by the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. Big Number 16. That’s how many electoral college votes North Carolina has, after gaining a vote after the 2020 census. The state has the eighth most electoral votes in the country, tied with Georgia. Surprising Fact North Carolina has only voted for one Democratic presidential candidate since 1980: Barack Obama in 2008. Key Background Harris holds an advantage over Trump in almost all of the seven battleground states, according to a recent Bloomberg News/Morning Consult survey, the latest to show she has essentially erased Trump’s lead over President Joe Biden in the must-win states. Overall, she leads by two percentage points across the seven states (Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, North Carolina, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin) and she either leads Trump or is tied with him in each of them, the poll found. Harris has also pulled ahead of Trump in most recent national surveys and now leads him by 1.8 points overall, according to RealClearPolitics’ polling average. Biden won six of the seven states, with the exception of North Carolina in 2020, solidifying his win.

The hard-right Federalist Society types Trump stuffed the courts with are not there to be independent or to ensure justice. Rather, these jurists are there to ensure right-wing policy preferences get enacted while Democratic goals get thwarted. That’s leading to sweeping and sloppy rulings that take a sledgehammer to regulations issued by President Joe Biden’s administration. And Donald Trump's victory in 2024 would make this landscape even worse. Let’s start with the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit, which has been unbalanced for decades. Democratic appointees haven’t outnumbered Republican ones since 1985, and Trump got to fill four vacancies. Now, the Eighth Circuit has only one Democratic appointee, Jane Kelly, who was put on the bench by President Barack Obama in 2013. While it would be improbable that Kelly would step down during a second Trump administration, a 2024 Trump victory would likely give Trump the chance to shore up his stranglehold on the courts by swapping out some older jurists. James B. Loken was put on the bench by George H. W. Bush in 1990, and is 84 years old. Loken could choose to take senior status. Senior status lets a judge have a reduced caseload and opens a vacancy on the court. Judges Duane Benton and Bobby Shepherd, both George W. Bush appointees, are both over 70 and could choose to do the same. Of course, the current composition of the Eighth Circuit is bad enough, and it just gave us an incomprehensible ruling on the Biden administration’s latest student debt relief plan. Red states have continued to race to friendly courts to attack the administration’s efforts to provide student loan forgiveness after getting the Supreme Court to block a plan to discharge $10,000 of federal student loan debt for millions of borrowers last year. After that loss, the administration pivoted, issuing a rule that wasn’t across-the-board loan forgiveness, though some would receive loan forgiveness under the rule. For many people, though, all that changed was how payments would be calculated based on income, how accrued interest was dealt with, and how periods of loan deferments were considered when calculating loan forgiveness. But even that was too much for Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, Missouri, North Dakota, Ohio, and Oklahoma, which promptly sued to stop the plan. A lower court’s ruling blocked only the loan forgiveness portion of the rule, but earlier this month, the Eighth Circuit enjoined all of it. As Chris Geidner explained at Law Dork, how the order is written “appears to block the government from implementing loan forgiveness under any other rule [and] under past plans … In other words, if you are a borrower in an income-contingent repayment plan, Friday’s order appears to block the government from doing virtually anything to forgive your loan while the injunction remains in place.” The problem here is that there are already long-approved, income-contingent repayment plans, ones where people have made payments for years, which are supposed to result in loan forgiveness after a certain point. Now, as Secretary of Education Miguel Cardona explained, the injunction as written could deny forgiveness guaranteed to people who have repaid their loans faithfully for 25 years. Because this is confusing, potentially devastating for borrowers, and seems well beyond the scope of the lawsuit, the government requested that the court clarify the scope of the injunction. And on Aug. 19, in a one-line, unsigned order, the Eighth Circuit denied the request. In theory, a sloppy, dismissive ruling like this would be addressed by the Supreme Court. However, conservative jurists have very little to fear, given the highest court in the land is also engaged in the same practice. Earlier this month, the conservative majority on the Supreme Court blocked the entirety—all 423 pages—of the administration’s Title IX sex discrimination rule from going into effect. Twenty-six red states had challenged the rule in a variety of lawsuits because it provides protections for transgender students and added discrimination based on gender identity and sexual orientation to the definition of “sex discrimination” in an education setting. Two lower courts had blocked the entirety of the rule despite the challenges being focused only on the provisions relating to transgender, gender identity, and sexual orientation protections. The Biden administration asked the federal appeals courts to allow the remainder of the rule to go into effect while those challenges played out, but the appeals courts refused. The rule then met a similar fate at the Supreme Court. Justice Sonia Sotomayor’s dissent from the denial of a request for a stay highlights how absurd this is, pointing out that the unchallenged provisions in the rule have nothing to do with any of the things that make this a culture-war fixation for conservatives. The rule requires, for example, that schools provide pregnant students with things like breaks during class for breastfeeding. Another portion bans schools from retaliating against people who file complaints under Title IX. The states that sued did not allege they would be harmed by the whole of the rule or by these provisions. Instead, their alleged harms flow only from the provisions they challenged, such as believing their free-speech rights would be violated if they can’t make bigoted statements about gender identity. Regardless, just as with the Eighth Circuit’s treatment of student loan forgiveness, the Supreme Court doesn’t care. There’s no penalty for this behavior, no downside to the court or the justices. Unless we manage to keep Trump out of the Oval Office again while also getting Democrats to rally around court reform, the federal courts will continue to be helmed by outcome-driven ideologues who don’t care what chaos they create.","summary":"It’s hard to overstate how broken the federal judiciary is.

I voted Democrat in the past,” he told The Epoch Times. This year, however, he leans toward former President Donald Trump, the Republican nominee—a notable shift from 2020 when he wrote in Tulsi Gabbard, former Democrat congresswoman, as his preferred candidate. Yet Domanick remains cautious. Before casting his vote this year, he wants to hear Trump’s plan for tackling inflation, which he believes is a key issue for many Americans. Neither candidate, according to him, has provided a concrete plan on how they will achieve their campaign promises. “They say what they’re going to do. They don’t say how they’re going to do it,” he said. “I think the No. 1 thing I would need to hear from Trump is gas prices. That’s where we got to start.” “Drill, baby, drill,” Domanick said, referencing a 2008 Republican campaign slogan frequently echoed by Trump in recent years. Lower gas prices, according to the math teacher, would lower transportation costs and, ultimately, reduce prices on store shelves. Domanick worries that the country is headed in the wrong direction, especially when he thinks about the future of his two high school-aged daughters. “Just think about college education. What I’m going to have to pay for them is going to be six figures in some cases, if I want them to go to a decent school,” he said. “I’m a math teacher, so I know all about compound interest,” he said, noting his concern about predatory student loans. He is not opposed to student loan forgiveness. However, he believes the government shouldn’t be selective in forgiving student debt based on political motivations. There needs to be a stronger and fair plan for families burdened by large school loans, he said. His 77-year-old mother, Linda Domanick, supports Trump and believes that the current state of the economy and her strong support for Israel are key factors influencing her decision to vote for the former president. “There’s so much wrong going on,” she said. “As a senior citizen living on disability, it’s becoming next to impossible to live. I’m going to put my house up for sale.” With just about 60 days remaining until the election, both the Trump and Harris campaigns are ramping up their outreach efforts to connect with voters in the Peach State. Last week, Vice President Kamala Harris, the Democratic Party’s presidential candidate, and her running mate, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, took a two-day bus tour, visiting rural communities and suburbs in South Georgia to rally support in the state. Harris wrapped up her tour with a solo campaign speech in Savannah on Aug. 29, encouraging thousands of supporters to work hard until election day. A week earlier, Trump’s running mate, Sen. JD Vance (R-Ohio), held a rally in Valdosta, a town in southern Georgia located about 15 miles north of the Florida state line. “I left teaching because it just wasn’t working for me anymore,” she said. “I couldn’t sustain myself independently as a single woman, as a public-school educator.” Gibbons wishes to hear more about Harris’s stance on education policy. Gibbons believes current trends are putting educators in the crossfire between policymakers and parents. “I’ve had parents ask me to make sure their child is using the bathroom correctly. That’s not my job. That’s not what I do. That’s not what I had signed up for,” she said, referring to parents’ concerns about gender identity issues and policies in schools. She said that teachers are expected to take on many roles in the classroom, including acting as mediators between parents and children, as well as serving as mentors, psychologists, and counselors to their students and parents. “You have to work overtime because you’re with the students for 90 percent of the workday,” she said, noting that teachers also need time to plan lessons. Gibbons said she didn’t feel safe as an educator because of shooting incidents in schools around the country. “We would have to have intruder drills where all the children hide in the corner of the room with the lights off. And how do you explain that to a 6-year-old?” she said. Autumn Boyd, an 18-year-old student from Valdosta, is one of them, but she will not cast a vote in the upcoming election. Like many Gen-Zers, politics doesn’t interest her. “I don’t pay attention. I prefer not to because I don’t want to get wrapped up,” she said. Boyd is also worried about being bullied for her voting choice. She says that if she votes for one candidate, she‘ll face criticism; if she votes for the other, she’ll face the same. “I just rather not vote,” she said. She believes there is a huge political divide in the country and dislikes the misinformation spread by both campaigns. If Boyd ultimately decides to cast her ballot on Nov. 5, she said she would “probably vote for Trump” because she knows “more about him” than Harris. “Whoever wins, I just hope that we don’t get killed. That’s my biggest fear,” she said. “I don’t want war with another country.” Other eligible Gen Z voters are not enthusiastic about voting. Gallagher, who voted Democrat in 2016 and 2020, is currently leaning toward Harris but says he knows little about her work as vice president. He believes the more she can get out and interact with voters, the better. He notes that neither Harris nor Trump’s campaigns are active in his area. However, he sees negative ads every time he opens YouTube. “There are always those negative ad campaigns. That’s all you ever see,” Gallagher said. Robert Whalen, a 71-year-old retiree from Ludowici, Georgia, is concerned about taxes if Harris wins. “If she wins, we’re done,” he said. “Our taxes are going to go up again.” Whalen, a lifelong Republican, said he will vote for Trump in 2024, as he has in previous years. His main concerns are inflation, wars, and border security. He believes that Harris has not effectively addressed any of these issues during her tenure as vice president, whereas he is confident that Trump would tackle them from day one. Rising living costs are a particular worry for Whalen and his wife, Loisann Morey. The couple feels that Trump should prioritize the inflation problem, urging him first to bring down the gas prices. “I know he will,” Whalen said. “The nice thing about Kamala is that she knows how to communicate on everyone’s level. You know, she doesn’t talk down to people,” Mies said. She believes the United States is ready for a woman president. “It’s time. We need that change.” While she acknowledges the importance of the economy, Mies emphasizes that women’s rights, health care, and what she calls the imbalance in the Supreme Court are equally critical issues. Amber Ealy, 44, another rallygoer, shares the sentiment. She believes the right to abortion is the most critical issue. “I have a 4-year-old daughter, and it is absolutely ridiculous that she has fewer rights than I do,” she said, referencing the 2022 Supreme Court Roe v. Wade decision. Ealy anticipates the Harris campaign becoming much more active in Georgia. She notes that Chatham County, where Savannah is located, has traditionally been a Democrat stronghold. She hopes to see a shift from red to blue in neighboring counties across South Georgia. “Georgia will be blue,” she said.","summary":"With about 60 days remaining until the election, Trump and Harris are ramping up their efforts to connect with voters in the key swing state.","url":"https://www.theepochtimes.com/us/in-battleground-georgia-voters-demand-solutions-to-inflation-key-issues-5716992","image":"https://img.theepochtimes.com/assets/uploads/2024/08/28/id5714557-08282024-DSC07073-Jon-Domanick-Linda-Domanick-300x180.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-02 20:34:04","author":"Emel Akan","authors":["Emel Akan"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.022},{"id":255483546,"title":"U.S. seizes plane in Dominican Republic bought illegally in Florida by Venezuela's Maduro","text":"Sept. 2 (UPI) -- The United States has seized an aircraft owned by Venezuela's hard-line President Nicolas Maduro and which allegedly was purchased and smuggled out of the country in violation of U.S. law, the Justice Department said Monday. \"This morning, the Justice Department seized an aircraft we allege was illegally purchased for $13 million through a shell company and smuggled out of the United States for use by Nicolás Maduro and his cronies,\" Attorney General Merrick Garland wrote Monday in a news release. The Dassault Falcon 900EX aircraft, a three-engine corporate jet, had been seized by authorities in the Dominican Republic on the island of Hispaniola before it was -- at the request of American officials -- transferred to U.S. control in Florida's Southern District based on alleged violations of U.S. export and sanctions laws. U.S. officials contend the aircraft had been illegally exported from the United States and was used for the benefit of Maduro and his official representatives. Garland says the U.S. government will continue pursuing those who violate U.S. sanctions and exports and \"prevent them from using American resources to undermine the national security of the United States.\" The Justice Department's Office of International Affairs and Homeland Security Investigations in Santo Domingo had provided \"significant assistance\" working with authorities in the Dominican Republic leading up to the aircraft's seizure. The French-built aircraft had a $13 million value at the time when it had been illegally purchased allegedly by individuals affiliated with Venezuela's president, DOJ says. A U.S. investigation that extended from late 2022 to early 2023 discovered how individuals affiliated with Maduro had allegedly used a Caribbean-based shell company to conceal involvement in the plane's illegal purchase from a Florida company, after which it made its way to Venezuela in April last year. The plane's U.S. registration was canceled in January 2023. And often with Maduro on board, the aircraft had been documented as previously visiting St. Vincent and the Grenadines, Cuba and Brazil and appears to be currently registered in the small European republic of San Marino, the Miami Herald reported. DOJ says since May of last year the plane, bearing the tail number T7-ESPRT, had flown \"almost exclusively to and from\" a Venezuelan military base and was allegedly used to transport Maduro on out-of-country visits. The U.S. Department of Commerce Bureau of Industry and Security's Miami Field Office is investigating the case along with the Homeland Security Investigations' El Dorado Task Force in Miami of the Department of Homeland Security. A Commerce Department official said it does not matter \"how fancy the private jet or how powerful the official\" is and that the U.S. \"will work relentlessly\" with global allies \"to identify and return any aircraft illegally smuggled outside\" America. \"Let this seizure send a clear message: Aircraft illegally acquired from the United States for the benefit of sanctioned Venezuelan officials cannot just fly off into the sunset,\" the Commerce Department's Assistant Secretary for Export Enforcement Matthew S. Axelrod, said. President Joe Biden had imposed a series of sanctions on the South American leader. An August 2019 executive order signed by former President Donald Trump placed a series of other sanctions on the country and prohibits U.S. citizens from engaging in transactions with those who have directly or indirectly acted on behalf of the government of Venezuela and Maduro's regime. \"This successful seizure was the result of planning, coordination, and execution by the United States government, with invaluable assistance by the authorities in the Dominican Republic,\" U.S. Attorney Markenzy Lapointe for the Southern District of Florida, said. \"Our office, along with our law enforcement partners, will continue to work to forfeit this plane and all other assets that circumvent the law,\" Lapointe added. This comes as world leaders have recently called on Maduro to peacefully restore democratic norms in Venezuela following mass protests over last month's presidential election results which the U.S. claims were not free and fair.","summary":"The United States has seized an aircraft owned by Venezuela's hard-line President Nicolas Maduro and which allegedly was purchased and smuggled out of the country in violation of U.S. law, the Justice Department said.","url":"https://www.upi.com/Top_News/World-News/2024/09/02/Venezuela-airplane-Nicolas-Maduro-seized-Dominican-Republic-Justice-Department-Merrick-Garland/2311725301152/","image":"https://cdnph.upi.com/ph/st/th/2311725301152/2024/upi_com/8b343e6dbe465c9af6c0a738a1542ba6/v1.2/US-seizes-plane-owned-by-Venezuelas-president-bought-illegally-in-Florida.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-02 20:32:35","author":"Chris Benson","authors":["Chris Benson"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.047},{"id":255482406,"title":"[Eric Posner] Is a pro-labor Republican Party possible?","text":"Following a speech by Sean O’Brien, the president of the Teamsters union, at the Republican National Convention last month, a New York Times analysis considered whether the party could really carry out a populist agenda in support of workers. While Donald Trump has never shown much interest in workers’ rights, many of his acolytes have. Republican Sens. Josh Hawley, Roger Marshall, Marco Rubio and JD Vance (the party’s vice-presidential candidate) have all sided with workers in policy debates about labor organizing, the minimum wage, and worker protections. Hawley, for example, recently declared that “it’s time Republicans embraced the trade unions of the working man. … I’ve been on the picket line with the Teamsters. I voted to help them unionize Amazon. I supported the railway strike and the autoworkers’ strike. And I’m proud of it.” Hawley coupled his encomium to labor with a paean to Christian nationalism that will trouble many worker advocates, who tend to be liberals. He was drawing on a long Republican tradition of attracting workers by appealing to their moral and religious commitments. But his support for labor organization and other worker protections -- including the minimum wage and enhanced antitrust enforcement -- really does represent a fundamental departure from the Republican Party of the last century. This strategy seems to fill an empty box in the matrix of American politics. Voters can be classified along two dimensions: socially conservative versus liberal/progressive; and pro-market versus market-skeptical. While there are pro-market liberals and anti-market liberals (like New Deal Democrats), social conservatives have long remained in the Republican coalition alongside free marketeers who celebrate wealth accumulation, and sometimes outright hedonism and greed. Yet such values are out of step with Christianity, which teaches its followers to reject vanity and materialistic values. By advocating Christian nationalism, Hawley seeks to pair social conservatism with market skepticism. One can see the political logic. Before the 1990s, the Democratic Party itself was liberal on social issues and skeptical of markets. But at least since President Bill Clinton’s administration, it has made peace with big business. Clinton accepted the pro-market philosophy that Ronald Reagan had made respectable, and so did Barack Obama. Most of their appointees to economic-policy positions were skeptical of regulation. This bipartisan embrace of markets came to define an era in which workers’ wages stagnated while corporate titans grew richer. As some libertarians drifted toward the Democratic Party, Republicans like Hawley recognized that they could peel off working-class votes by repudiating the wealthy who had defected to the other side, exchanging the money of the few for the votes of the many. When Hawley condemns “woke corporations,” he is tapping into rank-and-file Republicans’ growing distaste for monied elites. Many Republican politicians complain that businesses have breached their implicit quid pro quo: firms would be free to make money as long as they deferred to the party’s religious wing on moral and religious matters. But this unnatural alliance could last only so long, because, in order to maximize profits, many corporations have followed customers and investors as the broader culture has moved left. A reconciliation of Republicanism and workers’ interests is also conceivable on philosophical grounds. During the Reagan era, economists assumed that labor markets are inherently competitive, implying that unions must be cartels that push wages above the competitive rate, ultimately reducing production and harming consumers. By the same token, minimum-wage laws would necessarily lead to higher unemployment. As economists advocated labor-market deregulation, businesses turned the theory into orthodoxy, and Republicans (and eventually Democrats) vied for business support by promising to turn the new orthodoxy into policy. In practice, however, deregulation -- along with other forces, such as globalization and advances in technology that favored scale economies -- benefited large firms. Soon enough, just a few companies dominated a broad range of markets, which had two major implications. First, it meant that corporations were less innovative and productive than they would have been in competitive markets. Second, surpluses generated by economic activity accrued more to investors, and less to consumers and workers. As economic growth weakened, inequality widened, exemplified by the massive increase in the difference between workers’ and executives’ compensation. A flood of research in recent years has shown that labor markets are not so competitive after all. Workers cannot move seamlessly from job to job, because they face a variety of obstacles such as high search costs and the absence of competing employers who are hiring. And because workers cannot easily change jobs, employers gain by underpaying and under-employing them. In this world, unions do not necessarily reduce productivity (moreover, the evidence for such an effect was always exceedingly thin); minimum-wage laws can push up wages without reducing employment; and antitrust enforcement can restore competition to labor markets, leading to higher wages and productivity. Hawley wants to force traditional pro-market Republicans to make a choice. They must either accept that free-market economics has failed and endorse government intervention to help workers, or they must acknowledge themselves as corporate stooges who advance the interests of business over workers to keep the donations flowing to the party from the capital-owning class. Hawley’s vision of a Christian society with legal restrictions on the excesses of capitalism could hardly be more different from Trumpian capitalism, which is unbridled rather than restrained. In this respect, Trump is a Republican in the classic mold. His appointments to the National Labor Relations Board, the Department of Labor, and the Supreme Court all sided with corporations on every major issue, and his signature policy achievement as president was a corporate tax cut. The Silicon Valley and Wall Street billionaires are flocking to his standard bet that he will support them, not labor. Contrary to MAGA ideologists, Trump is a nationalist and a plutocrat, not a populist, let alone a religious conservative. Whether and how Hawley will find support for his vision in a secularizing, money-mad country is the question of the day.

Trump recently spoke about these allegations during an interview on Fox News’ Life, Liberty, and Levin. In conversation with Mark Levin, he insisted that he had \"every right\" to interfere in the election process. His remarks soon went viral, with netizens and legal experts urging the U.S. Justice Department and Special Counsel Jack Smith to take notice. Federal prosecutor, Joyce Vance, said, \"There's no right to ‘interfere’ with a presidential election. This is the banality of evil right here—Trump asserting he can override the will of the voters to claim victory in an election he lost. And, he will do it again. We must vote against him in overwhelming numbers.\" Psychologist Dr. David A. Lustig also penned, \"We’re now at that remarkable point where Trump’s sociopathic narcissism is working synergistically with his advancing dementia, leaving us with an incredibly nasty, malevolent, and Machiavellian bowl of oatmeal.\" Another attorney echoed, \"No one has the right to interfere with an election. Either 1) Trump believes his lies, or 2) Trump is old and delusional. Either way, he is unfit to be president.\" In a similar vein, an X user asked, \"Isn't there a procedure where the prosecutor can simply request that the judge make a summary judgment because the evidence is so overwhelming?\" Another comment read, \"You do not, in fact, have the right to interfere with a presidential election. Also, can we skip all the trials about this, please, and move straight to sentencing?

When people get indicted, their poll numbers go down,\" as reported by Raw Story. Trump's indictment was updated following a Supreme Court ruling that presidents are only immune from prosecution for official duties, not private actions. Trump argued his actions were official, but prosecutors say he was acting as a private citizen. Meanwhile, during the interview, Trump also warned that a Kamala Harris presidency would eliminate fracking in key battleground states such as Pennsylvania. As reported by Fox News, he said, \"I call her comrade Kamala because she is radical Left. She's a radical Left Marxist. And that's what she is. And she'll destroy our country.

The first ballots will go out within days","text":"It might feel like the presidential election is still a long way off. It’s not. Election Day on Nov. 5 is only about two months away, and major dates, events and political developments will make it fly by. The stretch between now and then will go as fast as summer break from school in most parts of the country. The first mail ballots will be sent to voters this Friday. The first presidential debate is set for Sept. 10. Former President Donald Trump, the Republican nominee, is scheduled to be sentenced in his New York hush money case on Sept. 18. And early in-person voting will start as soon as Sept. 20 in some states. Here’s a look at why the calendar will move quickly, with the Democratic and Republican conventions over and Labor Day signaling the traditional start of campaign season. Who’s ready to vote? The first batch of ballots typically sent out are ones to military and overseas voters. Under federal law, that must happen at least 45 days before an election — which this year is Sept. 21. Some states start earlier. North Carolina will begin sending mail ballots to all voters who request them, including military personnel and overseas voters, on Sept. 6. Voter registration deadlines vary by state, with most falling between eight and 30 days before the election, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. The deadline is Oct. 7 in Georgia, one of this year’s most prominent presidential battlegrounds. Nearly all states offer some version of in-person voting, though the rules and dates vary considerably. In Pennsylvania, another of the major presidential battleground states, voters can visit their local election office to request, complete and return a mail ballot beginning Sept. 16. For those counting, that’s a little over two weeks from now. The gloves come off Whether, where and under what rules the Democratic and Republican presidential and vice presidential nominees will debate has been a point of contention for weeks. But for now, two match-ups are on the calendar. Trump and Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris have accepted an invitation from ABC News to debate Sept. 10 in Philadelphia. Harris’ pick for vice president, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, and Trump’s, Ohio Sen. JD Vance, have agreed to an Oct. 1 debate hosted by CBS News in New York City. Harris has forecast a possible second debate with Trump, but her proposal appeared to be contingent on the GOP nominee’s participation in the Sept. 10 debate. Trump has proposed three presidential debates with different television networks. Vance has challenged Walz to another vice presidential debate on Sept. 18, although it’s not been set. A possible criminal sentence for Trump Trump is scheduled to be sentenced Sept. 18 in his hush money criminal case, though his lawyers have asked the judge to delay the proceeding until after Election Day. A decision is expected early this month. In a letter to Judge Juan M. Merchan, Trump’s lawyers suggested that holding the sentencing as scheduled, about seven weeks before Election Day, would amount to election interference. On Sept. 16, Merchan is expected to rule on Trump’s request to overturn the guilty verdict and dismiss the case because of the U.S. Supreme Court’s July presidential immunity ruling. Trump was convicted in May on 34 counts of falsifying business records to conceal a $130,000 hush money payment to porn actor Stormy Daniels just before the 2016 presidential election. Falsifying business records is punishable by up to four years in prison. Other potential sentences include probation, a fine or a conditional discharge that would require Trump to stay out of trouble to avoid additional punishment. Next steps in Trump’s other New York cases On Friday, the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals will hear arguments in Trump’s appeal of a jury’s verdict last year ordering him to pay $5 million to writer E. Jean Carroll after it found him liable for sexually assaulting and defaming her. Trump also is appealing a verdict in a second trial in January in which a jury found him liable on additional defamation claims and ordered him to pay Carroll $83.3 million. Trump’s lawyers have until Sept. 13 to file a brief in that appeal. On Sept. 26, a New York appeals court will hear oral arguments in Trump’s challenge of a nearly $500 million civil fraud judgment in state Attorney General Letitia James’ lawsuit against him. The court typically rules about a month after arguments, meaning a decision could come before the November election. Trump’s lawyers argue that a judge’s Feb. 16 finding that the former president lied for years about his wealth as he built his real estate empire was “erroneous” and “egregious.” State lawyers responded in court papers this week that there’s “overwhelming evidence” to support the verdict. What about Trump’s election and document cases? A state case in Georgia that charged Trump and 18 others in a wide-ranging scheme to overturn his 2020 loss in the state is stalled with no chance of going to trial before the election. Federal prosecutors have brought two criminal cases against Trump, but one was dismissed by a judge last month and the other is likely to be reshaped by the recent U.S. Supreme Court opinion that conferred broad immunity on former presidents for official acts they take in office. Special counsel Jack Smith has appealed the dismissal by U.S. District Judge Aileen Cannon of an indictment charging Trump with hoarding classified documents at his Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida and obstructing the FBI’s efforts to get them back. But even if a federal appeals court reinstates the case and reverses the judge’s ruling that Smith’s appointment was unconstitutional, there’s no chance of a trial taking place this year. In light of the Supreme Court’s immunity ruling, a federal judge in Washington is now tasked with deciding which allegations in a separate case charging Trump with plotting to overturn the 2020 election can remain part of the prosecution and which ones must be discarded. Deciding which acts are official and which are not is likely to be an arduous process. Fights over voting and the election Before the first ballots are even cast, both camps are gearing up to fight over voting. Battles over election rules have become a staple of American democracy, but they’re expected to reach new heights this year. Trump installed his own leadership team at the Republican National Committee, including a director of election integrity who helped him try to overturn Biden’s win in 2020. The RNC has filed a blizzard of lawsuits challenging voting rules and promises that more are on the way. Democrats also are mobilizing and assembling a robust legal team. Among other things, they are objecting to GOP efforts to remove some inactive voters or noncitizens from voter rolls, arguing that legal voters will get swept up in the purges. Republicans have particularly escalated their rhetoric over the specter of noncitizens voting, even though repeated investigations have shown it almost never happens. Some also are pushing to give local election boards the ability to refuse to certify election results. All indications are these efforts are laying the groundwork for Trump to again claim the election was stolen from him if he loses and to try to overturn the will of the voters. But there’s no way to know if that will happen until the ballots are cast. ___ Associated Press writers Kate Brumback and Christina A.

In a rally in Michigan, the former President said, \"Under the Trump administration, your government will pay for— or your insurance company will be mandated to pay for— all costs associated with IVF treatment. We want more babies...And for the same reason, we will also allow new parents to deduct major newborn expenses from their taxes.\" The IVF process often leads to excess production of embryos. Hence, anti-abortion activists have argued how several embryos end up being disposed of. Earlier this year, in February, amidst growing pressure, the Alabama Supreme Court ruled that fertilized embryos are to be considered children under the state law which makes the wrongful handling or harm to them, subject to legislative dealing like the death of a minor. This led to the shutting down of many in-vitro fertilization clinics. However, in a Truth Social post, the ex-POTUS assured that he wouldn't make it harder for wishful parents to have babies. He penned, \"We want to make it easier for mothers and fathers to have babies, not harder! Like the OVERWHELMING MAJORITY of Americans, including the VAST MAJORITY of Republicans, Conservatives, Christians, and Pro-Life Americans, I strongly support the availability of IVF for couples who are trying to have a precious baby.\" The ruling reads, \"The Wrongful Death of a Minor Act applies to all unborn children, regardless of their location [including] unborn children who are located outside of a biological uterus at the time they are killed.\" The ruling would now allow the future parents to sue clinics for the wrongful death of their embryos. In light of the same, the University of Alabama at Birmingham's Division of Reproductive Endocrinology and Infertility— the largest hospital in the state— has paused all IVF treatments. The National Fertility Association, on the other hand, announced that the shipping of embryos from and to the state won't take place for the time being. \"We are saddened that this will impact our patients' attempt to have a baby through IVF, but we must evaluate the potential that our patients and our physicians could be prosecuted criminally or face punitive damages for following the standard of care for IVF treatments,\" a statement from the health system, read, as reported by Newsweek. Meanwhile, President Joe Biden deemed the ruling \"outrageous and unacceptable.\" \"Make no mistake, this is a direct result of the overturning of Roe v. Wade. Until we restore the protections of Roe v. Wade in federal law for all women in every state.\" Recently, Trump has signaled that he would oppose Florida's abortion ban as well. \"Well, I do know, but I do want more than six weeks. I think six weeks is a mistake. And I’ll be expressing that soon, but I want more than six weeks. In Florida, we have a six-week program, and that’s what I believe that you’re voting on, and I think it should be more than six weeks,\" Trump said in an interview with the Daily Mail.

Harris “is expected to say that U.S. Steel should remain domestically owned and operated and stress her commitment to always have the backs of American steel workers,” her campaign says. That’s similar to Biden, who has said that he opposed U.S. Steel’s would-be sale to Nippon in order to better “maintain strong American steel companies powered by American steel workers.” But it still constitutes a major policy position for the vice president, who has offered relatively few of them since Biden abandoned his reelection bid and endorsed Harris in July. Harris has been careful to balance presenting herself as “a new way forward” while remaining intensely loyal to Biden and the policies he has pushed. Her delivery is very different – and in some cases she’s pushed to move faster than Biden’s administration – but the overall goal of expanding government programs to buoy the middle class is the same. The vice president began marking Labor Day with a rally at a high school gymnasium in Detroit, where hundreds of audience members wore bright yellow union shirts and hoisted “Union strong” signs. She noted that one of the nation’s first Labor Day parades happened in Detroit around 140 years ago and that “every person in our nation has benefited” from unions’ work. “Everywhere I go I tell people, ‘Look, you may not be a union member, you’d better thank a union member,” Harris said, noting that collective bargaining by organized labor helped secure the five-day work week, sick-pay and other key benefits and solidify safer working conditions. “When unions are strong, America is strong,” she said. Harris later was set to attend Pittsburgh’s Labor Day parade, marking the first time she and Biden will both speak at a campaign event since the surprising election shakeup that provided a fresh jolt of Democratic enthusiasm to the 2024 election. The 81-year-old Biden has spent most of his lengthy political career forging close ties with organized labor but the White House said that the president has asked to introduce Harris at the joint appearance – rather than the usual other way around – because he wanted to highlight her record of helping deliver for union workers at one of the largest Labor Day gatherings in the country. In addition to opposing the Nippon Steel sale, Biden has endorsed expanding tariffs on imported Chinese steel – a rare instance of political overlap with Republican former President Donald Trump, who has cheered steeper foreign tariffs on many imports. Still, in a statement Monday, U.S. Steel said it remains “committed to the transaction with Nippon Steel, which is the best deal for our employees, shareholders, communities, and customers.” “The partnership with Nippon Steel, a long-standing investor in the United States from our close ally Japan, will strengthen the American steel industry, American jobs, and American supply chains, and enhance the U.S. steel industry’s competitiveness and resilience against China,” the company said, noting that it employs nearly 4,000 people in Pennsylvania alone. David B. Burritt, U.S. Steel’s president and CEO, said Nippon Steel has announced plans to invest “approximately $1.3 billion in U. S. Steel union-represented facilities, on top of the $1.4 billion capital commitment they previously announced.” Referencing Trump during her speech in Detroit, Harris said some have suggested “the measure of the strength of a leader is based on who you beat down instead of what we know, the true measure of the strength of a leader is based on who you lift up.” Harris, 59, has sought to appeal to voters by positioning herself as a break from Trump’s acerbic rhetoric while also looking to move beyond the Biden era. Harris events feel very different from Biden’s, which usually featured small crowds. But the vice president’s agenda is chock-full of the same issues he’s championed: capping the cost of prescription drugs, defending the Affordable Care Act, growing the economy, helping families afford child care — and now her position on the sale of U.S. Steel. “We fight for a future where we build what I call an opportunity economy, so that every American has the opportunity to own a home, start a business and to build wealth and intergenerational wealth,” Harris said at a recent rally, echoing Biden’s calls to grow the economy “from the bottom out and the middle up.” Harris has promised to work to lower grocery store costs to help fight inflation. She’s also moved faster than Biden in some cases, calling for using tax cuts and incentives to encourage home ownership and end federal taxes on tips for service industry employees. But she’s also offered relatively few specifics on major policies, instead continuing to side with Biden on top issues. The vice president briefly appeared on stage with Biden after the president delivered his remarks on the opening night of last month’s Democratic National Convention, but the two haven’t shared a microphone at a political event since Biden himself was running against Trump. At that time, the campaign was using Harris mostly as its chief spokeswoman for abortion rights, an issue they believe can help them win in November as restrictions grow and health care worsens for women following the fall of Roe v. Wade. They both have appeared at official events and met together at the White House since the ticket-swap. For more than 3-1/2 years, Harris has been one of Biden’s chief validators. Now the tables are turned, as Harris looks to lean on Biden – a native of Scranton, Pennsylvania – to help win the potentially decisive state. Although the vice president has appeared more forceful in speaking about the plight of civilians in Gaza, as Israel’s war against Hamas there nears the 11th month mark, the vice president has also endorsed Biden’s efforts to arm Israel and bring about a hostage deal and ceasefire. Israel said Sunday that it had recovered the bodies of six hostages captured during Hamas’ Oct. 7 attack that ignited the Gaza war, including Israeli-American Hersh Goldberg-Polin. The revelation prompted thousands of Israelis to demonstrate in the streets, demanding a ceasefire deal. Before appearing together in Pittsburgh, Harris joined Biden in the White House’s Situation Room to meet with the U.S. hostage deal negotiating team and discuss continuing efforts on a deal that would secure the release of the remaining hostages.","summary":"The vice president began marking Labor Day with a rally at a high school gymnasium in Detroit, where hundreds of audience members wore bright yellow union shirts and hoisted “Union strong” signs.","url":"https://www.centralmaine.com/2024/09/02/harris-set-to-oppose-sale-of-u-s-steel-to-a-japanese-firm-during-joint-pennsylvania-event-with-biden/","image":"https://w2pcms.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2024/09/Election_2024_Harris_58589.jpg?w=1000","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-02 20:29:42","author":"Colleen Long And Will Weissert,COLLEEN LONG and WILL WEISSERT - Associated Press","authors":["Colleen Long And Will Weissert","COLLEEN LONG and WILL WEISSERT - Associated Press"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.199},{"id":255482128,"title":"The consequences of women voting against what is best for them","text":"Throughout the past decade, numerous opportunities have arisen for women to advocate for themselves and support each other. Surprisingly, many have not seized these chances, particularly in terms of safeguarding their legal rights. During the 2016 U.S. presidential election, Hillary Clinton’s campaign presented the possibility of electing the first female president. However, her candidacy faced significant criticism. One notable point of contention was her competence to lead a nation based on her gender, a critique that was notably voiced by other women. Now, here we are again, with the chance to have a female as the country’s leader, with built-in support to ensure the rights of women and other underrepresented groups are upheld. We’ve already experienced what is at stake when the wrong person is in power. But will women vote in support of their fundamental rights? There’s a lot on the line with every election, and here are several laws affecting women that everyone should be mindful of come November. Attack on reproductive rights: Abortion, contraception and IVF In 2018, during the confirmation hearings for then-Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, Kamala Harris, a Senator at the time, memorably asked: “Can you think of any laws that give the government the power to make decisions about the male body?” And his response was, essentially, I cannot. “I’m not thinking of any right now, Senator,” he said at the time. Yet, there is a growing number of laws that allow the government to make decisions about the female body. In 2022, the Supreme Court overturned Roe V. Wade, ending the right to abortion, a judgment that was upheld for nearly a half-century. All conservative justices, including the three appointed by former President Donald Trump, joined Chief Justice Samuel Alito in his opinion, with the exception of Chief Justice John Roberts, who concurred with the judgment only and would have banned abortions after 15 weeks. Alito contended abortion is a matter to be decided by the states, a sentiment that has been echoed by Trump. This puts women living in more than half the country at risk. As of July 2024, 21 states have abortion bans or early gestational limits in effect; 6 states have no health exceptions; and 10 states have no rape or incest exception when it comes to the legality of abortion. As a further attack on women’s reproductive rights, several states have introduced personhood bills in 2024 that could make it illegal to destroy embryos during the process of in vitro fertilization, or IVF. In a February 2024 ruling, the Alabama Supreme Court ruled that frozen embryos can be considered children under state law. This ruling has halted IVF treatments in many state clinics, leaving patients without care and chances of becoming pregnant. Additionally, eight states so far in 2024 have proposed restrictions on contraceptive access. A law passed in Indiana limits the types of contraceptive care available to those with Medicaid coverage, based on misinformation by anti-abortion groups that IUDs cause abortions. Similarly, a bill proposed in Oklahoma sought to enact restrictions with the intention to ban IUDs and emergency contraception. Despite the differing opinions women have regarding abortions, all women should be fearful of their legal rights being in jeopardy, as they do not stop with their physical bodies. To vote against female body autonomy seems like there’s a lack of awareness of how much of an impact this has for them, as well as their friends, family members, and colleagues. Efforts to roll back no-fault divorce Many conservatives are now also focused on efforts to make it more difficult for women to end marriages based on irreconcilable differences. Many leaders have come out against no-fault divorce including Speaker of the House Mike Johnson and Ohio Senator-turned-vice-presidential-candidate J.D. Vance. If the idea is that these efforts will not come to fruition, Missouri law already requires women seeking divorce to disclose whether they’re pregnant, and state judges won’t finalize divorces during a pregnancy. Though the ruling was originally established to make sure men were held financially accountable for the children they fathered, it puts women at risk who are in domestically violent, emotionally abusive, and other risky spousal situations. Women’s health care General health care access for women also remains in danger. Harvard research has found women who received coronary bypass surgery were only half as likely to be prescribed painkillers compared to men who had undergone the same procedure. There’s also been evidence women wait an average of 65 minutes before receiving treatment for acute abdominal pain, while men only wait 49 minutes. Though Congress has made efforts to reduce health disparities through the Health Equity and Accountability Act of 2022, these are but a few examples of health care discrepancies women, especially women of color, face every day compared to men. Again, the hope is women will vote in favor of governing officials who are going to provide more accessibility, affordability, and opportunity for equitable health care, which is not likely going to be those who are voting against women’s reproductive rights. Widening gender wage gap The gap in equal rights between women and men continues in the workplace as well. Despite pay equity laws, women earn 82 cents for every dollar earned by men, and the number is reduced even further with Hispanic women earning only 65% as much as white men, and Black women earning 70% in comparison. Everyone rightly wants a seat at the table, and if females only get one, then everyone is going to fight for that spot. However, what most women have found is working together as a collective boosts opportunities and makes it easier to achieve their respective goals. It’s beneficial to be in someone’s corner rather than being viewed as a threat. It’s simple: protect women’s legal rights When put into a position to make real change, why is it hard to get women to support other women and their initiatives, and more importantly, how can we put a stop to it? Women supporting women creates a ripple effect and opens a space where meaningful changes can occur. Speaking up in favor of women’s rights is important. And voting in local, state, and federal elections is a crucial part of that. The time is now to insist on equity to preserve your own best interests, as well as for the generations of women who will come after.

On Monday, Kamala Harris’ campaign charged that the comments were evidence that Trump believed he was “above the law.” In the Fox News interview that aired Sunday, Trump went on a long screed about the Department of Justice and its treatment of him, charging he had been targeted. Trump marveled that criminal charges facing him did nothing but boost his poll numbers, he surmised, because his supporters didn’t buy the charges in the first place. “Whoever heard you get indicted for interfering with a presidential election where you have every right to do it, you get indicted, and your poll numbers go up?” Trump said. “When people get indicted, your poll numbers go down. But it was such, such nonsense.” Last week, Trump was indicted again in his efforts to overturn his 2020 election loss. Trump is accused of trying to carry out a multi-pronged effort, that included trying to disenfranchise voters in certain states, of interfering with the election results by repeatedly claiming it was stolen, even though he knew those claims were false. Authorities say Trump’s false claims served as a catalyst to the violence attack on the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021. The former president faces similar charges of election interference in Fulton County, Georgia. On Monday, Harris campaign spokesperson Sarafina Chitika blasted Trump’s comments to Fox News and asserted it was another example of the “chaos, fear, and division” Americans experienced under Trump. “Everything Donald Trump has promised on the campaign trail — from ‘terminating’ the Constitution, to imprisoning his political opponents and promising to rule as a dictator on ‘day one’ — makes it clear that he believes he is above the law. Now, Trump is claiming he had ‘every right’ to interfere in the 2020 election. He did not,” Chitika said in a statement. Trump's comments come after a July Supreme Court ruling granted expanded immunity powers to president against prosecution if their conduct is related to official acts. Last week's new indictment of Trump was crafted in a way that took the new ruling into account.","summary":"Former President Donald Trump said on Sunday that he had “every right” to interfere with the 2020 election, even as two criminal cases involving those allegations hang over him.","url":"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/trump-every-right-interfere-2020-election-rcna169245","image":"https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-1500w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2024-08/240825-donald-trump-election-wm-446p-93a245.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-02 20:21:22","author":"Natasha Korecki","authors":["Natasha Korecki"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.604},{"id":255482396,"title":"‘My Black Job is voting’: Politicians and others urge voters to turn out at Labor Day parade","text":"CLEVELAND, Ohio — More than 4,000 people marched down Kinsman Road for the 11th Congressional District’s Labor Day parade, an annual event that’s a political rally of sorts, just ahead of the November election. The crowd had girl scouts and grandparents, high school bands and elected officials. And among the pageantry and music, one thing that stood out: T-shirts. There were, of course, campaign T-shirts like “Harris-Walz” or “Bibb for Mayor.” Fraternity and sorority members wore shirts with big Greek letters. But the shirts, and day, were full of political messages in the heavily Democratic area. “Make History Again.” “Stand against hate” “Black Votes Matter” and “#My Black Job is voting.” “As a Black woman and a Black person, my job is to vote,” said Deanna Jarvis, of Euclid, who marched with her sorority, Alpha Kappa Alpha. She was one of several people wearing a shirt with that message. Getting out the vote was a big part of the 11th Congressional District Community Caucus’ Labor Day festiva at Luke Easter Park in Cleveland. The event traces its roots to former Cleveland Mayor Carl Stokes and his brother and former 11th District Rep. Louis Stokes, who expanded it from an annual picnic into a parade in 1971. Elected Democrats like U.S. Sen. Sherrod Brown and U.S. Rep. Shontel Brown took the stage and urged people to vote. Voting was also on the minds of many in the crowd, like Jarvis. Her shirt is a reference to the former President Donald Trump’s comments in June, where during the presidential debate he claimed migrants were taking “Black jobs” from Americans. Many criticized him for it, and many have also clapped back, like Michelle Obama at the Democratic National Convention. “Who’s going to tell [Trump] that the job he’s currently seeking might be one of those ‘Black jobs’?” Michelle Obama said in August. Jarvis said voting is always important, but it’s especially important now and she wants people to know what’s at stake in this upcoming election. Shontel Brown, also the parade’s grand marshal, shared a similar message. She said voters had a chance to make history in 2016 when Hillary Clinton was running against Trump. Some people stayed home and others voted third party, she said. “And we ended up with Donald Trump,” Shontel Brown told the crowd. She said that 2016 allowed Trump to appoint three U.S. Supreme Court Justices and that led to the overturning of Roe V. Wade. Issues like a women’s right to bodily autonomy are on the ballot, Shontel Brown told the crowd. “We need you to vote up and down the ticket,” Shontel Brown. Sherrod Brown, who is in a competitive race against Republican Bernie Moreno, also took to the stage. Playing of the theme of Labor Day, which is to recognize the American labor movement, he told the crowd he’s fought for workers his whole career. He then said Moreno was a car dealer, and repeated attacks his campaign has made before saying that Moreno was guilty of wage theft. Moreno has denied wrongdoing in these lawsuits. “That’s the difference between him and me,’ Sherrod Brown said. “Elect somebody you trust.” The event was full of non-political fun, too. Food trucks and barbeque smokers were scattered across Luke Easter Park. So were bouncy castles and other inflatable games for kids. Bands from Euclid High School and Warrensville Heights High School marched in the parade and then faced off in the middle of the park, going back and forth with tunes. In the past, the event has attracted national political figures, like Hilary Clinton in 2016, John Kerry in 2004 and Jesse Jackson in 1984. Ahead of 2024 Vice President Kamala Harris and former president Donald Trump’s campaigns don’t have a huge presence in Ohio. The Buckeye State had long been thought of as a swing state, but Trump won Ohio in 2016 and 2020 by 8 percentage points.

The banking giant unveiled a billboard campaign in Times Square Monday just a block from ABC global headquarters, where the televised debate will take place. The billboards are part of the bank’s nonprofit,10,000 Small Businesses initiative and call for the debate moderators to give small business policy airtime at the debate. “The issues that matter most to us most have been largely overlooked by candidates running for office this November,” Jessica Johnson-Cope, chair of the national leadership council of Goldman Sachs 10,000 Small Businesses Voices told The Post. “Candidates for president need to be asked to provide more detail on their proposals to support Main Street.” 10,000 Small Businesses also sent ABC leadership a memo that outlines six key questions local business owners want to know about Kamala Harris and Donald Trump, The Post has learned. “Small businesses are the backbone of the American economy, accounting for 44% of America’s gross domestic product and employing nearly 50% of American workers,” the memo reads. Despite a huge contribution to the economy, business owners’ concerns are often overshadowed by more controversial topics. In June, candidates addressed abortion, immigration and the overall economy at CNN’s 90 minute debate between then-Democratic candidate Joe Biden and Donald Trump — but did not address small business. Biden’s slow performance at the debate is credited as one of the key reasons which made him decide not to seek a second term as president. The advertising campaign and letter come after a recent Goldman survey revealed 55% of local business owners are dissatisfied with the way candidates are addressing small business issues; including inflationary pressures, small business tax policy, regulatory burden, workforce training, and access to affordable capital. Given 78% percent of business owners say small business policy is a factor in their vote, this could be a key issue for both Trump and Harris to win over voters. Goldman’s philanthropy placed the billboard less than a block from ABC News headquarters and also drafted a detailed memo with six different questions the network could ask at the first debate between Kamala Harris and Donald Trump. Suggested questions focus on how candidates will address topics like expanding the number of qualified workers, helping small businesses adopt artificial intelligence, and bringing affordable childcare to small business employees. “Small businesses are struggling with inflation, workforce, and access to capital… What specific policy proposals will your administration implement to support America’s small businesses and help them compete?” One question reads. “High interest rates and limited loan options are making it challenging for small business owners to access the capital they need to grow their businesses. What is your plan to make it easier for small businesses to access an affordable loan or line of credit?” Asks another. Goldman Sachs launched the 10,000 small business initiative in 2009 as a philanthropic venture. It supplies local business owners with educational programs, mentors, and access to capital. More than $200 million in funds have gone to small business owners at LaGuardia Community College in Queens. Many of Goldman Sachs’ executives have left the bank to work in politics — earning the bank the nickname “Government Sachs.” Biden’ Securities and Exchange Commission chair Gary Gentler was a Goldman partner. Under Trump, Goldman alums including the bank’s former chief operating officer Gary Cohn served as head of the National Economic Council while Goldman partner Steve Mnuchin was Treasury Secretary. Mnuchin was instrumental in passing the Paycheck Protection Program that gave small businesses forgivable loans of up to eight weeks of payroll costs during the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic. While Johnson-Cope acknowledges ABC may not include their proposed questions, she wants to make it as easy as possible for the network to slip them in. “Who knows?” she added, saying she was hopeful.","summary":"Goldman Sachs' small business initiative is pushing ABC's moderators to give small business policy some airtime at the Sept. 10 debate.","url":"https://nypost.com/2024/09/02/business/trump-and-harris-urged-to-debate-small-business-by-goldman-sachs-campaign/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/09/goldman-sachs-ad-2.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&1725293514&w=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-02 20:17:07","author":"Lydia Moynihan","authors":["Lydia Moynihan"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.252},{"id":255481582,"title":"US Wants to Send 'Clear Message' With Maduro Plane Seizure","text":"The United States sent a \"clear message\" with its seizure of Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro's plane, a Commerce Department official said Monday.The U.S. seized a Dassault Falcon 900EX aircraft owned by Maduro and used by him and his associates, the Department of Justice announced Monday. The plane was seized in the Dominican Republic and brought back to Florida after it was illegally sold by a Florida-based company for $13 million and smuggled out of the U.S. to Venezuela in an April 2023 deal in violation of U.S. export control and sanction laws, the DOJ said.\"Let this seizure send a clear message: aircraft illegally acquired from the United States for the benefit of sanctioned Venezuelan officials cannot just fly off into the sunset,\" said Matthew Axelrod, the Commerce Department's assistant secretary for export enforcement, in a statement.He continued: \"It doesn't matter how fancy the private jet or how powerful the officials—we will work relentlessly with our partners here and across the globe to identify and return any aircraft illegally smuggled outside of the United States.\"Newsweek reached out to the Commerce Department via email and the DOJ via an online form for comment on Monday afternoon.In August 2019, President Donald Trump issued an executive order to prohibit dealings between the U.S. and the Venezuelan government.The U.S. has placed extensive sanctions on Maduro's regime \"for extensive corruption, economic mismanagement, and violation of international norms,\" according to the U.S. Department of State's website.Meanwhile, the Commerce Department has imposed \"export controls for items intended, entirely or in part, for a Venezuelan military or military-intelligence end user,\" according to the DOJ's Monday press release.In late 2022 and early 2023, Maduro's associates allegedly used a Caribbean-based shell company to hide their involvement in the illegal aircraft purchase and then smuggled it through the Caribbean.

Harris will make these statements alongside President Joe Biden as she and Gov. Tim Walz (D-MN), her running mate, separately embark on a tour of the Midwest on Labor Day to tout their commitment to workers. Harris “is expected to say that U.S. Steel should remain domestically owned and operated and stress her commitment to always have the backs of American steelworkers,” a campaign official said. Last December, Nippon agreed to buy U.S. Steel and later said the merger would be completed in the “second half of 2024, subject to the fulfillment of the remaining, customary closing conditions, including the receipt of required U.S. regulatory approvals.” Her expected remarks mirror those of the president. Before Biden exited the presidential race, he visited United Steelworkers headquarters, where he expressed his opposition to the plan. “U.S. Steel has been an iconic American company for more than a century, and it should remain a totally American company,” Biden said during an April visit to Pittsburgh. “American-owned, American-operated by American union steelworkers, the best in the world. And that’s going to happen. I promise you.” Pittsburgh has a long history with the steel industry, dating back to the Gilded Age. The city was once the center of the booming steel industry and is the headquarters of some of the largest mills in the country, including U.S. Steel and Ampco Pittsburgh. Harris and Biden will attend Pittsburgh’s Labor Day parade. The Harris campaign said Biden would be deployed “strategically” to states he won in 2020, such as Pennsylvania, and those with voting demographics Biden bodes well in, such as laborers and older voters. Pennsylvania has the most electoral votes of all the swing states, with 19, and is seen as a “must-win” state by Harris and former President Donald Trump. In 2016, Trump flipped the state red for the first time since 1988, while in 2020, Biden turned the state blue once again by more than 80,000 votes.","summary":"Vice President Kamala Harris is expected to announce that U.S. Steel should remain domestically owned and not move forward with an overseas merger at a campaign event in Pennsylvania on Monday.  Her planned statement coincides with an earlier sentiment from the White House opposing U.S. Steel’s planned sale to the Japan-based Nippon Steel.

The event had been scheduled for Thursday but an update on the gala's website now shows the date as postponed and location \"to be announced,\" suggesting the organizers may also have to change venue. Trump and former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani were among the invited speakers but it remains unclear whether the former president actually planned to show up. Giuliani had confirmed his attendance, according to the website. The website had no explanation for the postponement on Monday, and did not provide a timeline for when updated information would become available. Sarah McAbee, who runs the Stand in the Gap Foundation in support of Jan 6 rioters who have been criminally charged, is trying to reschedule the event after the November election, according to the New York Times citing text messages it had obtained. “I want you to know that we fought until the absolute last minute to have the event but there were multiple issues outside of our control, the main one being safety concerns of attendees and staff,” a text message reportedly said. The event is personal for McAbee as her husband, Ronald Colton McAbee, is serving five years in prison for attacking police officers during the riot at the Capitol. The Independent has contacted the Stand in the Gap Foundation for comment. The gala billed itself as a celebration of 20 defendants who formed a prison choir and recorded a song called \"Justice For All\", a version of the National Anthem featuring Trump's voice speaking the Pledge of Allegiance. The gala website says the event was also to pay tribute to “all J6 defendants who have shown incredible courage and sacrifice”. The big draw for the event, aside from a potential Trump appearance, was the chance to win a “Justice For All' Donald J Trump & J6 Prison Choir\" plaque. The item celebrated the song's brief moment at the top of the Billboard Music Charts shortly after it was released. The plaque was part of an auction, the proceeds of which would have gone to \"directly support the January 6th defendants and their families, providing much-needed assistance during these challenging times.\" \"This is a rare opportunity to own a piece of history while making a significant impact on the lives of those who have shown incredible bravery and sacrifice,\" the website stated. There had been a previous attempt to hold the gala. A flyer for that event showed ticket prices ranging from $2,500 for an individual to $50,000 for a table of 12 with a speaker seated at the table, according to MediasTouch. The second attempt at the gala had been planned ahead of Trump formally becoming a felon later this month. The Republican presidential candidate will be sentenced on September 18 after being found guilty on 34 felony counts in the Stormy Daniels hush money case in New York in July. Once he officially becomes a felon, the former president will be \"legally prohibited from associating with other felons,\" according to Tristan Snell, an attorney that prosecuted the Trump University case.","summary":"The event organizer’s husband was sent to prison for attacking police officers on January 6, 2021","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/capitol-riot-gala-postponed-election-b2605869.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2024/06/06/16/Capitol_Riot_Retired_NASCAR_Driver_23574.jpg?width=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/AN9nNncq-4VHSaSK0.mp4","publish_date":"2024-09-02 20:11:01","author":"Graig Graziosi","authors":["Graig Graziosi"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.095},{"id":255483184,"title":"Ekin-Su Cülcüloğlu is forced to CANCEL book signing events over security fears after receiving threats online that left her 'extremely unsettled'","text":"Home News Royals U.S. Sport TV Showbiz Femail Health Science Money Travel Podcasts Shopping Best Buys Discounts My Profile Logout Login Headlines Showbiz Kim Kardashian Victoria Beckham Harry Styles Amanda Holden Britain's Got Talent My Profile Logout Login Privacy Policy Feedback Monday, Sep 2nd 2024 10PM 17°C 1AM 16°C 5-Day Forecast Advertisement Dine and dashers will put me out of business!
