Petlin’s mission heralded the dawn of Sino-Russian diplomacy.\n\nJust decades later, in 1654, 10 years after the collapse of the Ming dynasty, Tsar Alexis sent Fyodor Baykov as the first Russian ambassador to China, marking the first formal diplomatic missions between the fledgling Qing dynasty and Russia.\nThrough the late 17th century, trade between the two countries grew, particularly via the gateway of Kyakhta, located on the present-day border between Russia and Mongolia.\nBut peace and commerce had fragile foundations. On the banks of the Amur River, known as Heilongjiang in Chinese, both Qing and Russian forces clashed. The Qing’s Siege of Albazin (1685-1686) ultimately pushed the Russians from the Amur, paving the way for negotiations.\nThe result was the landmark 1689 Treaty of Nerchinsk, the first Sino-Russian accord that defined the borders separating Qing-dynasty China and the Tsardom of Russia. Although Russia suffered territorial losses, it was granted trading access to Chinese markets under negotiated terms.\nIn the 19th century, the Qing dynasty’s grip on power gradually weakened with the onslaught of internal rebellion and foreign pressure, and its rulers’ ineptness in turning things around. For several countries with imperialist ambitions, of which Russia was one, China became a low-hanging fruit, ripe for the taking.\nSeizing the opportunity, Russia in 1858 coerced the enfeebled Qing dynasty into signing the Treaty of Aigun.\n\nThis agreement superseded the earlier Nerchinsk treaty and forced China to surrender over 600,000 square kilometres (230,000 square miles) of territory north of the Amur River to Russia. This was one of the most significant territorial losses in Chinese history, and it laid the groundwork for the modern Sino-Russian border.\nThis cession of vast tracts of land was confirmed in 1860 as part of the Convention of Peking, a series of unequal treaties that the Qing dynasty was forced to sign with Great Britain, France and Russia, following China’s humiliating defeat in the Second Opium War.\nAmid the military conflicts and fraught diplomacy, individuals from both countries quietly engaged in cultural exchanges.\nDuring the 1700s and into the 19th century, Orthodox Christian missions in Beijing became conduits of learning. Scholars like the monk Bichurin translated Chinese classics, compiled dictionaries and laid the foundation for Russian sinology, a branch of knowledge that is quite different from its Western European and North American counterparts.\nRussian literature, art and architecture influenced Chinese artists and educators, especially in the late 19th and early 20th centuries.\nAfter both countries ditched their monarchies, China in 1912 and Russia in 1917, Sino-Russian ties swung from revolutionary camaraderie to bitter rivalry before settling into cordial rapprochement.\n\nAfter the founding of the People’s Republic of China in 1949, the Soviet Union became China’s closest ally, providing economic aid, military technology and ideological guidance.\nBy the late 1950s, however, disputes over doctrine, leadership and national interests led to the Sino-Soviet split, culminating in armed clashes along the Ussuri River in 1969. Relations remained frozen until the late 1980s, when Soviet president Mikhail Gorbachev’s reforms paved the way for normalisation.\nToday, relations between China and Russia are very friendly. Russia’s belligerent role in China’s “century of humiliation”, while never forgotten, is all but forgiven. For now.","summary":"Compared to American President Donald Trump’s on-again, off-again bromance with his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin, the relationship between the latter and Chinese President Xi Jinping is on a much more even keel.\nIn recent years, China and Russia have forged a deepening strategic partnership marked by expanding trade, closer military cooperation and shared opposition to United States-led international norms, or what passes for norms in these bewildering, topsy-turvy times.\nThe relationship...","url":"https://www.scmp.com/lifestyle/chinese-culture/article/3321869/brief-history-china-russia-relations-bitter-rivals-close-allies","image":"https://cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2025/08/14/e4b8d4f0-4f99-4179-afd3-c688dee91917_ae2b0baa.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-08-16 00:45:08","author":"Wee Kek Koon","authors":["Wee Kek Koon"],"language":"en","source_country":"cn","sentiment":0.497},{"id":351479690,"title":"Trump says no agreement on ending Russia's war in Ukraine","text":"Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson, Alaska, Aug 16 (AP) President Donald Trump said he and Vladimir Putin didn’t reach a deal to end Russia’s war in Ukraine after meeting on Friday — despite Putin saying they had come to “an understanding” — as the two leaders offered scant details on what was discussed while heaping praise on each other.\nIn brief remarks as they shared a stage after meeting for about 2 ½ hours in Alaska, Putin said he and Trump had reached an “understanding” on Ukraine and warned Europe not to “torpedo the nascent progress.” But Trump then said, “There’s no deal until there’s a deal” and said he planned to speak with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and European leaders soon, to brief them on the discussions.\n“We had an extremely productive meeting, and many points were agreed to,” Trump said. “And there are just a very few that are left. Some are not that significant. One is probably the most significant, but we have a very good chance of getting there.” He continued: “We didn’t get there.” The high-profile summit ended without a deal to end, or even pause, the brutal conflict — the largest land war in Europe since 1945 — which has raged for more than three years. The two were expected to hold a joint news conference but instead took turns giving brief remarks. Putin went first and then Trump, but both left without taking questions.\nJust getting back to the U.S. for the first time in a decade was a win for Putin, whom the U.S. and much of the world had long been attempting to isolate. Agreeing to come to Alaska to meet with Trump also stalled economic sanctions that Trump had promised unless Moscow worked harder to bring fighting to a close.\nThe outcome could also benefit Russia’s leader since Friday may simply lead to more meetings in the future. Russia’s forces are making fair progress on the battlefield, and more discussions with Trump gives them more time to keep that up while avoiding sanctions.\nPutin thanked Trump for the “friendly” tone of their conversation and said Russia and the United States should “turn the page and go back to cooperation.” He praised Trump as someone who “has a clear idea of what he wants to achieve and sincerely cares about the prosperity of his country, and at the same time shows understanding that Russia has its own national interests.” “I expect that today’s agreements will become a reference point not only for solving the Ukrainian problem, but will also mark the beginning of the restoration of businesslike, pragmatic relations between Russia and the U.S.,” Putin said.\nTrump ended his remarks by thanking Putin and saying, “we’ll speak to you very soon and probably see you again very soon.” When Putin smiled and offered, “next time in Moscow,” Trump said “that’s an interesting one” and said he might face criticism but “I could see it possibly happening.” (AP) HIG HIG","summary":"","url":"https://www.news18.com/agency-feeds/trump-says-no-agreement-on-ending-russias-war-in-ukraine-9508182.html","image":"https://images.news18.com/ibnlive/uploads/2025/07/News18_World_Section_Default_Image_1600x900-2025-07-4401653589b9d10b46b8abb07f758342.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-08-16 00:45:01","author":"News18","authors":["News18"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"in","sentiment":-0.145},{"id":351481580,"title":"Alaska Summit: ‘No Deal Till There’s A Deal’, Says Trump As Putin Hails Ukraine 'Understanding'","text":"Russian President Vladimir Putin said on Friday that he hoped the \"understanding\" reached with US President Donald Trump will bring both countries closer to peace in Ukraine. Meanwhile, Trump said no final agreement had been reached on ending Russia’s war in Ukraine. Speaking at a joint press briefing after their summit in Alaska, Putin warned Kyiv and European leaders not to derail progress with “provocations or backroom moves.” The two leaders met for more than two and a half hours in a summit that focused on the Ukraine war and the future of European security. Talks began in a three-on-three format with close advisers before moving into a larger meeting over lunch. Trump was accompanied by Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Special Envoy Steve Witkoff, instead of the initially planned one-on-one session, according to White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt. Putin Praises Trump's Efforts On Ukraine During the press briefing, Putin spoke about Russia’s position on Ukraine. “We see the strive of the administration and President Trump personally to help facilitate the resolution of the Ukrainian conflict and his strive to get to the crux of the matter to understand this history is precious,” Putin said. He said the situation in Ukraine is a “fundamental threat” to Russia’s security. He added that the peace would only last if all the root causes of the conflict were resolved. “We have said it multiple times, to consider all legitimate constraints of Russia and to reinstate a just balance of security in Europe and in the world as a whole,” Putin said. “I agree with President Trump, as he has said today, that naturally, the security of Ukraine should be ensured as well. Naturally, we are prepared to welcome that,” he added. The Russian President said that he hoped that the understanding reached in Alaska would pave the way for a political solution. “I would like to hope that the agreement we have reached together will help us bring closer that goal and will pave the path towards peace in Ukraine. We expect that Kyiv and European capitals will perceive that constructively and they won’t throw a wrench in the works. They will not make any attempts to use some back-room dealings to conduct provocations to torpedo the progress,” he said. “During the last contact with the previous administration, I tried to convince my previous American colleague that the situation should not be brought to the point of no return when it comes to hostilities. I said it directly back then that it is a big mistake,” he added. Putin said, \"Today, when President Trump says had he been the President back then, there would have been no war, and I am quite sure it would indeed be so.\" Trump Calls Alaska Talks 'Productive' Trump called the Alaska talks “very productive,” saying that progress had been made on several key issues. “We had a very productive meeting, there were many points that we agreed on. Couple of big ones that we haven’t quite gotten there but we made some headway,” Trump said. The US President said that discussions were still ongoing and that no final deal had been reached on Ukraine yet. “There’s no deal until there’s a deal,” he said. “I’ll of course call President Zelenskyy and tell him about today’s meeting. We made some great progress today. We’ll probably speak to you soon and hopefully see you again very soon,” Trump said. “Next time in Moscow,” Putin said during the press conference. “I could see it happening,” Trump said.

He next wants to bring Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization into the talks. \n\nDuring a joint press conference after a more than three-hour closed-door meeting, the two leaders spoke in vague terms and did not take questions from the press. That’s an unusual circumstance for Trump, who frequently engages in long news conferences and impromptu press gaggles. \n\nPutin spoke in Russian through an interpreter for about six minutes, while Trump spoke for just over three minutes.\n\nHere are the top takeaways from what’s known about the meeting. \n\n1. Putin: No Invasion Had Trump Been President\n\nDuring the 2024 presidential campaign and during his second term, Trump has said the Russian-Ukraine war would not have happened had he been in office at the time. \n\nTrump blamed weak leadership from President Joe Biden. \n\nInterestingly, Putin confirmed Trump’s assertion. \n\n“In 2022, during the last contact with the previous administration, I tried to convince my previous American colleague that the situation should not be brought to the point of no return when it should come to hostilities,” Putin said. “I said it quite directly that it’s a big mistake. Today, when President Trump says if he was the president back then, there would be no war, I’m quite sure it would indeed be so.”\n\nHe later added, “President Trump and I have built a very businesslike and trustworthy contact.” \n\n2. What’s Next?\n\nTrump said he would next reach out to Zelenskyy and U.S. allies. \n\nHe acknowledged sticking points but said he and Putin agreed on most points. Neither leader elaborated on what points they agreed or disagreed on. \n\n“There were many, many points we agreed on, most of them I would say. A couple of big ones, we haven’t quite gotten there, but we made some headway,” Trump said. \n\n“There is no deal until there is a deal,” Trump continued. “I will call up NATO in a little while. I will call up the various people that I think are appropriate. I will, of course, call up President Zelenskyy and tell him about today’s meeting. It’s ultimately up to them.” \n\nHe later added, “We have a very good chance of getting there. We didn’t get there. But we have a very good chance of getting there.”\n\nTrump spoke about the death toll for both countries. \n\n“We are going to stop really five, six, seven thousands of people a week from being killed. President Putin wants to see that as much as I do,” Trump said. \n\n3. US-Russia Trade\n\nTrump and administration officials have alluded to economic incentives to persuade Russia to end the war. \n\nWithout specifics of a deal, Putin talked about the potential for increased cooperation and commercial trade between the two countries. \n\n“It is clear U.S. and Russia cooperation has tremendous potential,” Putin said. “Russia and the U.S. can offer each other so much in trade, digital, high-tech, and in space exploration. We see Arctic cooperation is also possible.”\n\nWhile speaking, Trump had positive things to say about Putin. \n\n“I’ve always had a fantastic relationship with President Putin, with Vladimir,” Trump said. “We had many, many tough meetings, good meetings. We were interfered with by the ‘Russia, Russia, Russia‘ hoax. That made it a little bit tougher to deal with.”\n\nToward the end, after Trump brought up a follow-up meeting, Putin said: “Next time in Moscow.” \n\nTrump replied: “That’s an interesting one. I’ll get a little heat on that one. But I can see it happening.” \n\n4. Putin Drops ‘Neighborly’ on US\n\nPutin, known for his ruthlessness on the world stage, used some of the softest language during the press conference.\n\nTrump and Putin met at the Anchorage airport with a warm handshake, speaking to one another with smiles. \n\nThey went to a platform that said “Alaska 2025,” before exiting the airport in a limousine together. \n\nWhile their words weren’t audible, during the news conference, Putin recalled telling Trump, “When I came out of the plane, I said, ‘Good afternoon. You are a neighbor.’ … It was very neighborly. I think those are kind words we can say to each other.”","summary":"President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin both professed to have made progress, but did not reach an agreement on how to end Russia’s...

Translation by Reuters. ON RUSSIA-U.S. TIESAs is known, Russian-American summits have not been held for more than four years. This is a long time. The past period was very difficult for bilateral relations. And, let's be honest, they have slid to the lowest point since the Cold War. And this is not good for our countries, or the world as a whole. Obviously, sooner or later, it was necessary to correct the situation, to move from confrontation to dialogue. And in this regard, a personal meeting of the heads of the two states was really overdue... ON UKRAINEAs you well know and understand, one of the central issues has become the situation around Ukraine. We see the desire of the U.S. administration and President Trump personally to facilitate the resolution of the Ukrainian conflict, his desire to delve into the essence and understand its origins. I have said more than once that for Russia the events in Ukraine are associated with fundamental threats to our national security. Moreover, we have always considered and consider the Ukrainian people, I have said this many times, brotherly, no matter how strange that may sound in today's conditions. We have the same roots and everything that is happening for us is a tragedy and a great pain. Therefore, our country is sincerely interested in putting an end to this. But at the same time, we are convinced that in order for the Ukrainian settlement to be sustainable and long-term, all the root causes of the crisis must be eliminated... Live Events All of Russia's legitimate concerns must be taken into account, and a fair balance in the security sphere in Europe and the world as a whole must be restored. I agree with President Trump - he spoke about this today - that Ukraine's security must, without a doubt, be ensured. We are ready to work on this. I would like to hope that the understanding we have reached will allow us to get closer to that goal and open the way to peace in Ukraine. We expect that Kyiv and the European capitals will perceive all of this in a constructive manner and will not create any obstacles. That they will not attempt to disrupt the emerging progress through provocation or behind-the-scenes intrigue. ON ECONOMIC TIESIt is obvious that Russian-American business and investment partnership has enormous potential. Russia and the United States have something to offer each other in trade, energy, the digital sphere, high tech and space exploration. Cooperation in the Arctic, resumption of interregional contacts, including between our Far East and the American West Coast, also seem relevant... I expect that today's agreements will become a reference point not only for solving the Ukrainian problem, but will also launch the restoration of business-like, pragmatic relations between Russia and the United States. ON COOPERATION WITH TRUMPOverall we have established very good business-like and trusting contact with President Trump. And I have every reason to believe that by moving along this path, we can - the quicker the better - reach an end to the conflict in Ukraine.(You can now subscribe to our Economic Times WhatsApp channel)\n\nRead More News onDonald TrumpVladimir PutinPutin statement after summitbilateral relations Russia USATrump Putin summit highlights\n\n(Catch all the Business News, Breaking News, Budget 2025 Events and Latest News Updates on The Economic Times.)

But we had an extremely productive meeting, and many points were agreed to, and there are just a very few that are left,' Trump said. \n\nHe added, 'Some are not that significant. One is probably the most significant.' \n\nIn his opening statement, Putin flattered Trump by saying his assessment about the Ukraine war was true and that it never would have happened under Trump's watch. \n\n'Today when President Trump's saying that if he was the president back then there will be no war. I'm quite sure it would indeed be so, I can confirm that,' Putin said in Russian through a translator.\n\nPutin also placed blame on former President Joe Biden for the U.S.-Russia relationship unraveling, not his February 2022 invasion of America's ally Ukraine. \n\n'I'd like to remind you that in 2022, during the last contact with the previous administration, I tried to convince my previous American colleague that the situation should not be brought to the point of no return when it would come to hostilities,' Putin said, adding it was a 'big mistake.' \n\nPutin noted that the U.S.-Russia relationship had soured 'to the lowest point since the Cold War.'\n\n'I think that's not benefiting our countries and the world as a whole,' Putin said. 'It's apparent that sooner or later we had to amend the situation and move on from the confrontation to dialogue.' \n\nBut Putin's comments were mostly backward-looking, a glaring indication that the U.S. and Russia remained apart on the crucial issues that could lead to a ceasefire in Ukraine. \n\nThe Russian leader didn't back down on his claims that the Ukrainian invasion was justified. \n\n'As I've said the situation in Ukraine has to do with frontal threats of our security,' Putin said. \n\n'At the same time we're convinced, that in order to make this settlement lasting and long-term, we need to eliminate all the primary roots, the primary causes of that conflict,' the Russian leader added. \n\nPutin added that the U.S. needed to 'consider all legitimate concerns in Russia' and he agreed with what President Trump said at the meeting 'that naturally the security of Ukraine should be insured as well.' \n\nWhen Putin announced his 'special military operation' in February 2022 - which has now dragged on for three and a half years - he claimed Ukrainians were being 'subjected to abuse and genocide' by their democratically-elected government that, under Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, became more western-aligned. \n\nPutin, a former KGB agent, has long set his sights on increasing Russia's borders to more closely resemble those of the USSR. \n\n'I'm going to hope that the agreement we've reached together will help us to that goal and will pave the path toward peace in Ukraine,' Putin continued, warning against provocations from Ukraine and Europe.\n\nTrump was set to call Zelensky and NATO leaders immediately after the meeting but details were not immediately available if that occurred.\n\nPutin opened by calling the U.S. and Russia 'neighbors' and referencing their WWII alliance.\n\n'It's very important for our countries to turn the page, to go back to cooperation,' he said.\n\nHe noted their geographic proximity, saying the nearby international dateline means 'you can step over, literally, from yesterday into tomorrow.'\n\n'I hope that we will succeed in that in [the] political sphere,' Putin added.\n\nThe meeting, their first since June 2019, appeared friendly from the start, with red carpets set up for both leaders as Trump walked off Air Force One first.\n\nTrump clapped his hands several times and then greeted the Russian leader with a handshake. \n\nBoth Trump and Putin ignored reporters' shouted questions as the U.S. president presented the Russian leader with a show of American military might - a flyover that included a B-2 bomber, used in June's bombing campaign to disable Iran's nuclear facilities. \n\n'Mr. Putin, did you underestimate Ukraine?' one journalist asked. \n\n'President Putin, will you stop killing civilians?' a reporter yelled. \n\nPutin appeared to shrug. \n\nTrump then invited Putin to ride with him in the Beast, the presidential limo, to where negotiations would kick off. \n\nUpon arrival to Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson, the White House changed the format of the meeting, to include Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Special Envoy Steve Witkoff after initially signaling the summit would be a one-on-one affair.\n\nHe told reporters that he believed Putin continued attacking Ukraine to put himself in a stronger bargaining position. \n\n'I think they're trying to negotiate. He's trying to set a stage. I think in his mind, that helps him make a better deal,' Trump said. 'It actually hurts him,' the president added. \n\nIn recent months, Trump has been more publicly critical of Putin's continued missile and drone strikes on Ukraine, crediting First Lady Melania Trump for calling out the Russian leader's violence against Ukrainian civilians. \n\nAhead of Friday's trip to Anchorage, Trump tempered expectations about what he might accomplish in Alaska, giving himself a '25 percent' failure rate. \n\n'The second meeting is going to be very, very important, because that's going to be a meeting where they make a deal,' Trump said. \n\n'But there is a 25 percent chance this meeting will not be a successful meeting,' Trump added.","summary":"President Donald Trump left the world hanging by announcing no details and answering no questions about his 'extremely productive meeting' with Russian President Vladimir Putin.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-15004811/donald-trump-vladimir-putin-no-ukraine-deal-alaska.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/08/16/01/101275187-0-image-a-122_1755303873810.jpg","video":"https://videos.dailymail.co.uk/video/mol/2025/08/15/1529546319434564775/1024x576_MP4_1529546319434564775.mp4","publish_date":"2025-08-16 00:33:45","author":"Editor,Nikki Schwab","authors":["Editor","Nikki Schwab"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.609},{"id":351482670,"title":"'If Trump were president in 2022, there would be no war': Putin after Alaska meeting; US president says no deal with Russia over Ukraine conflict","text":"Russian President Vladimir Putin on Friday claimed that he would not have invaded Ukraine if Joe Biden had not been in office, a remark seen as courting Donald Trump, even as US tariff threats persist. “I’d like to remind you that in 2022, during the last contact with the previous administration, I tried to convince my previous American colleague the situation should not be brought to the point of no return when it would come to hostilities,” Putin said after his nearly three-hour summit with Trump in Alaska.“And I said it quite directly back then. “That's a big mistake today, when President Trump is saying that if he was the president back then, there will be no war — and I’m quite sure that it would indeed be, so I can confirm that.” “I think that, overall, me and President Trump have built a very good business-like [relationship],” he added. Trump has frequently expressed the belief that Putin would not have initiated the invasion had he been president in 2022, but he did not appear to engage with the dictator’s provocation on Friday.Ahead of the meeting in Alaska, Trump, while in his flight, told Fox News that this Ukraine war is Biden's war and he was the one who screwed up. \"I'm not doing it based on history, based on anything else — I'm doing it based on a deal. If we make a deal, great. If I see that there's no hope of making a deal, I'm out of there... This isn't my war. This is Biden's war. Biden screwed this up...\" Putin said.

We’ve become the hottest country anywhere in the world in a very short period of time,” he said. “We look forward to dealing — we’re going to try and get this over with. “… We’ll have a good chance when this is over.”Trump said that he and Putin did not reach an agreement to resolve Moscow’s war in Ukraine, though he characterized the meeting as “very productive.”“There were many, many points that we agreed on,” Trump said at a joint press conference with Putin. “I would say a couple of big ones that we haven’t quite got there, but we’ve made some headway.

I will MAKE OUR CAPITAL GREAT AGAIN!”\n\nSince then, the streets of DC have been swamped with federal agents, national guards and vehicles that would not look out of place on an actual battlefield.\n\nThe internet is awash with videos of raids, checkpoints and patrols that have driven the lefties, who mostly make up this city, round the bend.\n\nRough-sleeping encampments that have sprung up in cities across the west have been visibly dismantled, despite howls from roving protesters.\n\nSo far, so good, many normal and non-deranged residents have said.\n\nBut you know what really takes the biscuit? Those very same right-on types that have their rules about where never to stroll are the very same ones saying the President has overstepped the mark, overreacted, is playing a political game or — among the most hysterical — sliding into all-out fascism.\n\nBetter-off folk who live in nice bits of the city wax lyrical about how great things are, and how it’s all a big stunt. \n\nYet they are the same ones who shade out parts of the map, with warning signs, to new arrivals.\n\nBecause they personally may not have been victims of crime, everything is clearly tickety-boo.\n\nEveryone knows someone who has witnessed something shocking, or had their own car broken into or turned a blind eye to a drug-addled crazy on their walk to work\n\nBut drill down a little and everyone has a different story to tell.\n\nEveryone knows someone who has witnessed something shocking, or had their own car broken into or turned a blind eye to a drug-addled crazy on their walk to work.\n\nTrump’s political enemies have walked straight into another one of his traps, as they defend the rights of violent criminals and gang-fuelled youths to roam and rampage on the streets at will.\n\nWith him seizing control of the local police structures and deploying federal powers, the Democrats warn that the President’s actions in the capital are a mere overture for similar action in crime-ridden Los Angeles, Chicago and New York. \n\nBut most law-abiding residents seem either remarkably unfazed by it all, or actively welcome somebody finally getting a grip.\n\nWhile the row rages on American networks over whether crime is actually falling in DC, if murder rates are down, or if the number of shootings and carjackings have in fact slumped since the pandemic, most normal people I have met are not upset to see something finally being done.\n\nThe same arguments are being had in London and Washington. Yet it’s surely time to do something about it rather than bury our heads in the sand\n\nWhich got me thinking. If an American friend was landing in Britain, I would give them the exact- same briefing — which bits of town to avoid, where never to get your phone out and why it’s best not to talk to nutters on buses.\n\nThe same arguments are being had in London and Washington. Yet it’s surely time to do something about it rather than bury our heads in the sand. \n\nPeople can see a marked decline in living standards due to muggings, snatchings, shoplifting, graffiti and all the rest.\n\nAll the while, coppers are either dancing in the street, for clout on TikTok, or seemingly kicking in the doors of all the wrong people.\n\nShovel a shelf of Greggs pastries into a bin bag in broad daylight and walk out, or tweet something daft and repent in haste . . . guess who is going to prison?\n\nPublicly, ministers and well-off commentators point to fig-leaf statistics that overall crime is falling, while normal people use just their eyes and ears to tell a different story.\n\nTake the princeling of woke, podcaster Lewis Goodall, who frothed this week: “London is being set up as this dystopian hellhole where you can barely walk out of your door . . . it’s a Trump import!”\n\nAccusing anyone of calling out the noticeable rise in crime as a “far-right” goon, he went on: “London lives rent-free in their heads as it’s living proof of how completely wrong they are — they have to lie about it!”\n\nYet these virtue-signalling types, who tell Brits they’ve never had it so good, are falling into the exact-same traps as Trump’s critics. \n\nWhile no one can accuse Sir Keir Starmer of having Donald Trump’s flair, turn of phrase or gumption, the UK government could do worse than take a leaf out of the President’s playbook this week\n\nThe argument about whether sending in the heavies is mere theatrics, or will have a lasting effect, is still playing out here.

Here's what to know","text":"Federal troops are patrolling the National Mall and neighborhoods across Washington while President Donald Trump's administration exerts extraordinary power over law enforcement in the nation's capital. \n\nBut the administration backed down from an attempt to take over the city's police department by installing its own emergency police commissioner after a federal judge indicated she would rule against it. The partial retreat interrupted one aspect of the most sweeping uses of federal authority over a local government in modern times.\n\nHow it will play out and whether the federal government will use this experience as a potential blueprint for dealing with other cities remains up in the air. Here's what to know about the situation and what might come next: \n\n Why is Trump taking over the police in DC? \n\nThe Republican president this week announced he’s taking control over Washington’s police department and activating National Guard troops to reduce crime, an escalation of his aggressive approach to law enforcement. But District of Columbia officials say the action isn't needed, pointing out that violent crime in the district reached historic 30-year lows last year and is down significantly again this year.\n\n Can he do that? \n\nD.C.'s status as a congressionally established federal district gives Trump a window to assert more control over the district than other cities. D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser didn't offer much resistance at first, allowing city workers to clear homeless encampments and work closely with federal immigration agents. But on Friday, the heavily Democratic district asked for an emergency court order blocking Trump officials from putting a federal official in charge of D.C. police. \n\n So, who is in charge of police in Washington? \n\nThe Trump administration on Friday agreed to leave the Washington, D.C., police chief in control of the department. That came one day after Attorney General Pam Bondi said the head of the Drug Enforcement Administration would take over the police chief’s duties, including authority over orders issued to officers. \n\nThe two sides sparred in court for hours before U.S. District Judge Ana Reyes after the city sued to stop the order. The judge indicated the law likely doesn’t grant the Trump administration power to fully take over city police, but it probably does give the president more power than the city might like. She pushed the two sides to compromise, promising to issue a court order temporarily blocking the administration from naming a new chief if they couldn’t agree.\n\nBut while Attorney General Pam Bondi agreed to leave the police chief in charge, she directed the District’s police to cooperate with federal immigration enforcement regardless of any city law.\n\n What's at stake \n\nThe showdown in Washington is the latest attempt by Trump to test the boundaries of his legal authority to carry out his tough-on-crime agenda, relying on obscure statutes and a supposed state of emergency to speed up the mass deportation of people in the United States illegally.\n\n What are the federal troops doing in DC? \n\nAbout 800 National Guard troops are being activated, with Humvees parked along the Washington Monument and near Union Station. Troops have been spotted standing outside baseball's Nationals Park and neighborhood restaurants. The White House says guard members aren’t making arrests but are protecting law enforcement officers who are making arrests and helping deter violent crime. Trump says one of the objectives will be moving homeless people far from the city. \n\n How long can this go on? \n\nTrump has the authority to do this for 30 days and says he might look into extending it. But that would require congressional approval. Whether Republicans in Congress would go along with that is unclear. Some D.C. residents have protested against the increased police presence. For some, the action echoes uncomfortable historical chapters when politicians used language to paint predominantly Black cities with racist narratives to shape public opinion and justify police action.\n\n Will Trump try to take control in other US cities? \n\nWashington is very different from any other American city, and the rules that govern it give the federal government much more control than it would have anywhere else. Whether Trump is using this as a blueprint for how to approach cities — largely Democratic cities — that he wants to exert more control over remains to be seen.","summary":"Federal troops are

City amid its tanking tourism industry. \n\nDrinks in the party hotspot are through the roof despite dwindling tourism numbers, with one horrified reveler sharing his shock at the prices in front of him at the Flamingo pool. \n\nA bucket of six Coors lights was priced at a staggering $76.99, with 24 cold ones running up to $290.99 – a near 15 times markup from its usual $20 price. \n\n‘I can keep going here,’ the partier who filmed his menu said as he listed off the pricey options. \n\nCases of Topo Chico or Truly hard seltzers, which typically cost around $30 to $35, were also sold for almost $300. \n\nFor drinkers who want a mixed cocktail, a large Bloody Mary would set them back $40 per drink. \n\nAnd six shots, a total of just 9 fluid ounces, costs $99.99 in the party hub on the iconic Vegas strip. \n\nFood options at the pool weren’t any more reasonable, with a chicken tender platter or a cheeseburger slider plate running up to $89.99. \n\n‘Get ready to spend if you want to go to the Go Pool,’ the shocked partier added. \n\nIt comes after a shock new report to Las Vegas’s Convention and Visitors Authority warned that the number of airline passengers arriving at the city will continue to plummet in the coming months. \n\nThe tourism body was told in the report by Ailevon Pacific Aviation Consulting that capacity rates at the gambling hotspot’s Harry Reid International Airport are forecast to drop dramatically in the second half of 2025. \n\nThey warned the number of inbound passengers will plunge to around 95,000 seats per day for the rest of the year – a worrying prediction that represents a 2.3 percent fall from 2024 numbers. \n\nThe decline is largely being fueled by a sharp 18.5 percent drop-off in traffic from Canada, which typically comprises the largest share of international visitors to the Nevada city, per the Las Vegas Review Journal. \n\nThe loss of Canadian tourists has cancelled out gains from other continents, including a 31.7 percent increase in airline capacity from Asia and a 21.6 percent increase jump from Europe excluding the United Kingdom. \n\nThe shock report cemented a steep decline in tourism to Las Vegas, with previous statistics from April showing it was losing upwards of 300,000 visitors per month since the start of 2025. \n\nThe number of Canadian passengers flying to Las Vegas fell to an average of 2,412 per day this year, according to the report – blamed by some on the election of Donald Trump to the presidency in January and his subsequent jibes at Canada. \n\nTrump quickly launched a hostile attack on the country and threatened to make it America’s ’51st state’ if it did not submit to his tariff demands.\n\nWith Canadians making up a large part of all tourism to Sin City, Trump’s antagonism of its residents may have played a role.\n\nAs the downward trend was beginning to snowball in February, Las Vegas Convention and Visitors Authority President and CEO Steve Hill told the Journal that he was hearing from many angry Canadians about the president.\n\n‘There’s an awful lot of the anecdotal conversation around Canadians being angry and upset about tariffs and talk around annexing the country,’ he said.\n\n‘We’ve seen consumer confidence numbers drop pretty significantly over the past couple of months.’ \n\nIn May, the World Travel & Tourism Council also reported that in its forecasts for 2025, the US was set to lose $12.5 billion in international visitor spending.\n\n‘While other nations are rolling out the welcome mat, the U.S. government is putting up the ‘closed’ sign,’ Julia Simpson, the council’s president and CEO, said in a news release at the time.\n\nAnother reason for the recent drop in Las Vegas is due to a maintenance issue with Spirit Airlines, the second busiest carrier at Reid International Airport.\n\nThe maintenance issues have grounded 50 planes in Spirit’s fleet, which has significantly reduced its capacity, according to Ailevon Pacific Aviation Consulting senior director Joel Van Over.\n\n‘They have an issue with their (jet) engines,’ Van Over said.\n\n‘They have to pull that engine off the plane, fix the cracks, put it back on the plane, and that whole process takes about 300 days.\n\n‘So obviously they can’t just do a plane a year because it would take them 100 years to get that done.’","summary":"Internewscast

Bunch III, explaining that the goal of the internal review was to ensure the exhibits “celebrate American exceptionalism, remove divisive or partisan narratives, and restore confidence in our shared cultural institutions.”\n\n Michaels argued that Trump is \"not whitewashing slavery,\" adding, \"You cannot tie imperialism and racism and slavery to just one race, which is pretty much what every single [museum] exhibit does.\"\n\n After some of her panelists wanted to chime in, Michaels said, \"Do you realize that only less than 2% of White Americans owned slaves? You realize that slavery is thousands of years old?\"\n\n Phillip, in response, told Michaels, \"I’m surprised that you’re trying to litigate who was the beneficiary of slavery. In the context of American history, what are you saying is incorrect by saying that it was White people oppressing Black people?\"\n\n “Every single thing is like, 'Oh, no, no, no, this is all because white people are bad and that's just not the truth,' \" she said. \"Every single exhibit, I have a list of every single one like people migrated from Cuba because White people are bad, not because of Castro. Yes. No, it’s in there.\"\n\n She then discussed a Smithsonian installation she called Change Your Game that highlights the complexities of gender testing in sports, declaring, \"Is it fair to have biological men competing against biological women in sports? No. But why is this in the Smithsonian?”\n\n After Phillip said there wasn't enough time to debate everything Michaels was saying, she claimed that \"everything is racialized.\"\n\n A confused Phillip answered, \"This was a conversation about the arts. And you brought up race.\" Michaels insisted that her point was that \"when you make every single exhibit about White imperialism when it isn't relevant at all, that is a problem.\"\n\n “So when you’re talking about Cubans leaving Cuba and you make it about White people bad, that’s not accurate,” said Michaels.\n\n Never miss a story — sign up for PEOPLE's free daily newsletter to stay up-to-date on the best of what PEOPLE has to offer, from celebrity news to compelling human interest stories. \n\n After the segment aired, Michaels doubled down on her comments on X, by showing a photo of one of the exhibits and writing, \"Trump is not trying to 'erase slavery' by suggesting some of the instillations there are inaccurate and bias.\"","summary":"“Every single thing is like, 'Oh, no, no, no, this is all because White people are bad,' and that's just not the truth,\" said Michaels","url":"https://people.com/jillian-michaels-defends-donald-trump-and-white-people-during-heated-debate-about-slavery-11792167","image":"https://people.com/thmb/NgsNA5InLZS3V5ysVedQ2E87pCo=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(999x0:1001x2)/Jillian-Michaels-081525-2-595664e3c0774fe98adfe1284248b171.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-08-16 00:09:40","author":"Ingrid Vasquez","authors":["Ingrid Vasquez"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.347},{"id":351473312,"title":"World News | Trump, Putin Arrive in Alaska for Summit Focused on Russia-Ukraine War","text":"Alaska [US], August 16 (ANI): US President Donald Trump on Friday (local time) landed at the Elmendorf Air Base in Anchorage, Alaska, to meet Russian President Vladimir Putin, CNN reported. Putin has also arrived in Anchorage, according to Russian state media. The meeting is scheduled at Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson.

Trump's one-on-one meetings with Putin during his first term were clouded with mystery. With only a translator inside the room, it was often unclear what exactly was discussed. Aides had a difficult time ascertaining if the two reached any agreements. After one such meeting, in Germany, Trump asked his interpreter to discard his notes. Also Read | US To Work With India To Face Modern Challenges and Ensure Brighter Future, Says US Secretary of State Marco Rubio.\nThe addition of two aides to today's session -- Secretary of State Marco Rubio and US special envoy Steve Witkoff -- could allow for greater clarity once the meeting concludes, particularly if Russia offers an accounting of events that differs from the US perspective, as per CNN.\nOne of them will also be able to take notes, which is often an essential factor in the real-time record of high-level summits. On Air Force One en route to Alaska, Trump told reporters that he wasn't having the meeting to broker a deal on behalf of Ukraine, but said instead, his goal was getting Putin to the table. He also stopped short of promising security guarantees for Ukraine as part of a deal to end the war. Trump said he spoke to Belarus' President Alexander Lukashenko -- a staunch Putin ally -- ahead of the summit. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, who is not attending the meeting, emphasized that Ukraine will be \"counting on America.\" If the summit goes well, Trump has suggested organizing a trilateral meeting with Zelenskyy, which the Ukrainian leader expressed support for, as per CNN. Russian Ambassador to the US, Alexander Darchiev, said he expected a positive outcome but no breakthrough from the Trump-Putin summit, Russian state media RIA Novosti reported, as quoted by CNN. Instead, Moscow expects \"constant and gradual movement,\" Darchiev said, according to RIA. Russian President Putin and his US counterpart Trump would \"discuss the entire agenda,\" RIA quoted Darchiev as saying, without elaborating. The talks will focus on exploring ways to end the Russia-Ukraine war, including ceasefire arrangements, prisoner exchanges, arms-control measures, and possible economic or security guarantees. Trump has vowed to \"end the Ukraine war quickly,\" while Putin is seeking recognition of Russia's territorial gains and relief from Western sanctions. Zelenskyy has refused to surrender territory and hasn't been invited to the summit. The summit's outcome could reshape global energy flows and influence India's import strategy. If a peace deal is reached, India might benefit from reduced energy prices and eased trade pressure. However, a breakdown in talks could keep commodity markets volatile and US trade pressure intact. The meeting's outcome could have significant implications for global markets, with investors awaiting clues about the health of the US economy and potential shifts in US-Russia relations.

Some are not that significant. One is probably the most significant, but we have a very good chance of getting there.” He continued: “We didn’t get there.” The high-profile summit ended without a deal to end, or even pause, the brutal conflict — the largest land war in Europe since 1945 — which has raged for more than three years.\nIt was an abrupt ending to an otherwise friendly meeting in which a red carpet was rolled out for Putin as he landed at Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson. The two leaders greeted each other with a handshake and a smile, and Putin even got a ride in the presidential limousine — an unusually warm reception for a U.S. adversary.\nWhile the two leaders were still on the tarmac, reporters nearby yelled, “President Putin, will you stop killing civilians?” Russia’s leader put his hand up to his ear as though to indicate he couldn’t hear them. Trump and Putin then shared the U.S. presidential limo known as “The Beast” for a short ride to their meeting site, with Putin offering a broad smile as the vehicle rolled past the cameras.\nZelenskyy and European leaders were excluded from Trump and Putin’s discussions, and Ukraine’s president was left posting a video address in which he expressed his hope for a “strong position from the U.S.” “Everyone wants an honest end to the war. Ukraine is ready to work as productively as possible to end the war,” he said, later adding, “The war continues and it continues precisely because there is no order, nor any signals from Moscow, that it is preparing to end this war.” Trump had both raised and lowered expectations for the summit, at turns characterizing it as a “feel-out meeting” but also warning of “very severe consequences” for Russia if Putin didn’t agree to end the war.\nHe boasted before taking office that he could end the war in 24 hours, a comment he later said was in jest. The opportunity to talk to Putin face-to-face gave him his best chance to date to get the fighting to stop, but he came up short.

We have always considered the Ukrainian nation a brotherly nation. Everything that’s happening is a tragedy for us. Therefore, the country is sincerely interested in putting an end to it. At the same time, we are convinced that in order to make the settlement lasting and long-term, we need to eliminate all the primary roots and causes of that conflict,” the Russian President said.\nHe said that there is a need to consider all the concerns of Russia and agreed that the security of Ukraine should be ensured as well.\n“We have said it multiple times to consider all legitimate concerns of Russia and to reinstate just balance of security in Europe and in the world as a whole.

On Thursday night. his administration escalated its intervention into the city’s law enforcement by naming a federal official as the new emergency head of the department.\n\nThe attorney general’s new order represents a partial retreat for the Trump administration in the face of intense skepticism from a judge over the legality of Bondi’s earlier directive that sought to put the police force under the full control of the federal government. But Bondi also signaled the administration would continue to pressure D.C. leaders to help federal authorities aggressively pursue immigrants in the country illegally, despite city laws on the books that limit cooperation between police and immigration authorities.\n\nThe District of Columbia’s police chief said Trump’s earlier move to sideline her would threaten law and order by upending the command structure. “In my nearly three decades in law enforcement, I have never seen a single government action that would cause a greater threat to law and order than this dangerous directive,” Chief Pamela Smith said in a court filing.\n\nThe two sides sparred in court for hours Friday before U.S. District Judge Ana Reyes, who is overseeing the lawsuit. She indicated the law likely doesn’t grant the Trump administration power to fully take over city police, but it probably does give the president more power than the city might like.\n\n“The way I read the statute, the president can ask, the mayor must provide, but the president can’t control,” said Reyes, who was nominated to the bench by Democratic President Joe Biden.\n\nThe judge asked the two sides to hammer out a compromise, and promised to issue a court order temporarily blocking the administration from naming a new chief if they couldn’t agree.\n\nAn attorney for the Trump administration, Yaakov Roth, said in court that the move to sideline Smith came after an immigration order that still held back some aid to federal authorities. He argued that the president has broad authority to determine what kind of help police in Washington must provide.\n\nWashington officials were pushing in court to halt U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi’s order Thursday to put the head of the Drug Enforcement Administration, Terry Cole, in charge of Washington police.\n\nThe police takeover is the latest move by Trump to test the limits of his

It represented a direct U.S.–Russia engagement that could determine whether a ceasefire would be negotiated in Europe's deadliest conflict since World War II, while raising concerns among Ukrainian and European leaders that Ukraine might be sidelined in any agreement.Observers flagged that any agreement reached without Ukraine's direct participation risked freezing gains Moscow had made on the battlefield and could redraw security arrangements in Europe.During the news conference, Trump said he would get on the phone with NATO and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy to brief them on the talks.What To KnowWhile speaking to a host of international media outlets, Putin slammed Biden, saying in part that, \"In the end, I would like to add one more thing. I'd like to remind you that in 2022, during the last contact with the previous administration, I tried to convince my previous American colleague...that the situation should not be brought to the point of no return when it would come to hostilities.\"I said it quite directly back then that it's a big mistake,\" Putin added. \"Today when President Trump [said] that if he was the president back then, there would be no war. And I'm quite sure that it would indeed be so, I can confirm that. I think that overall, me and President Trump have built a very good businesslike and trustworthy contact. And I have every reason to believe that moving down this path we can come...the sooner the better, to the end of the conflict in Ukraine.\"Putin's remarks were translated via CNN.What Happens NextTrump said that the two countries agreed on various points, but ultimately, no deal was made. Trump added, though, that \"great progress\" was achieved during the summit.

The much-anticipated meeting, which included Americans Donald Trump , Steve Witkoff and Marco Rubio, as well as Russians Vladimir Putin , Sergei Lavrov and Yuri Ushakov, was centred around negotiating a ceasefire to end the war with Ukraine that has been ongoing since February 2022. Until now, Russia had shown reluctance in making any concessions amidst its continued occupation and assault on Ukraine. However, following the meeting with Trump, this stance seems to have shifted, with Russia agreeing to several key points, although not enough to secure a ceasefire. While it may not be the result many were hoping for, it is undeniably a sign of progress and brings us one step closer to ending a conflict that has already claimed over a million lives. Yet the lack of a ceasefire will no doubt have come as a blow to Trump, who has always lauded himself as a savvy businessman who can secure any deal. Speaking at a press conference, despite the setback Trump remained optimistic about the progress made and seemed to share a positive rapport with Putin, who suggested that their next meeting should take place in Moscow, reports the Express . Although no specifics were shared regarding the agreed points, Trump hinted at his future course of action. He plans to engage with NATO and Ukrainian President Volodomyr Zelensky to discuss the way forward - something President Putin also appears to have in mind. During his opening address to reporters, Putin claimed he is \"sincerely interested\" in putting an end to the conflict, which he described as a \"tragedy\", yet in the same speech he also urged Kyiv and European Leaders not to interfere. We expect that Kyiv and European capitals will perceive all this in a constructive manner and will not create any obstacles, will not make attempts to disrupt the emerging progress through provocations and behind-the-scenes intrigues,” he said.","summary":"A meeting between US President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin has taken place in a bid to negotiate a ceasefire to end the war with Ukraine, yet despite lauding 'progress' , no deal was secured","url":"https://www.dailystar.co.uk/news/us-news/art-no-deal--donald-35740866","image":"https://i2-prod.dailystar.co.uk/article35740865.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200b/0_COMBO-US-POLITICS-VOTE-RUSSIA-INTELLIGENCE-TRUMP.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-08-15 23:47:45","author":"Phoebe Tonks","authors":["Phoebe Tonks"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.068},{"id":351480498,"title":"‘Next time in Moscow’: Trump and Putin end more than 2.5 hour meeting (Video)","text":"President Donald Trump and Russias Vladimir Putin said they reached an understanding on ending the war in Ukraine after meeting for about 2 1/2 hours in Alaska.

Poignée de main énergique, sourires et brèves amabilités ont marqué la rencontre. Donald Trump a brièvement applaudi l’arrivée de son invité et lui a tapoté la main, signe d’une volonté affichée de réchauffer les relations bilatérales. Ce geste tranche avec la ligne dure adoptée par son prédécesseur Joe Biden, qui avait tenté de faire de Poutine un paria après l’invasion de l’Ukraine en février 2022.\n\nCe déplacement de Vladimir Poutine hors de Russie est rare. Sous sanctions dans de nombreux pays, il n’avait pas foulé le sol américain depuis le début de la guerre en Ukraine. Le choix de l’Alaska, avant-poste stratégique depuis la Seconde Guerre mondiale et la Guerre froide, n’est pas anodin. Située à proximité du détroit de Béring, la base Elmendorf-Richardson symbolise l’équilibre des forces entre Washington et Moscou.\n\nSi la mise en scène a séduit les partisans de Donald Trump, qui y voient une démonstration de force destinée à impressionner Poutine, elle a été vivement critiquée par l’opposition américaine, dénonçant une déférence excessive envers le Kremlin. Le président russe, réputé pour manier la pression psychologique, a bénéficié d’un accueil habituellement réservé aux alliés stratégiques des États-Unis.\n\nAprès la cérémonie, les deux chefs d’État se sont rendus dans un bâtiment de la base, accompagnés de leurs conseillers, pour une séance photo. Aucune réponse n’a été donnée aux questions des journalistes, notamment sur la guerre en Ukraine. Une conférence de presse commune est prévue, un format inhabituel depuis le début du conflit. Les discussions se tiendront sous le slogan « Œuvrer pour la paix », affiché derrière les pupitres.\n\nLe chef de la diplomatie russe, Sergueï Lavrov, a attiré l’attention à Anchorage en arborant un sweat-shirt frappé du sigle « URSS », une provocation vestimentaire qui a largement circulé sur les réseaux sociaux. Ces détails renforcent l’idée que cette rencontre est autant une opération diplomatique qu’une démonstration de communication politique, où chaque geste est calculé pour envoyer un message au monde.","summary":"Donald Trump a réservé à Vladimir Poutine un accueil spectaculaire vendredi sur la base militaire Elmendorf-Richardson, en Alaska.
