The White House is working to fulfill President Donald Trump’s campaign promise to conduct mass deportations of immigrants who entered the country illegally during the past four years of the Biden administration. \"We've cut illegal border crossings by well over 95%, and frankly, I think those numbers are going to continue to come down,\" Vance told \"The Ingraham Angle\" Thursday in an interview from the White House. ICE SCOOPS UP ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS WITH MURDER, ROBBERY CONVICTIONS IN WEEKEND CRACKDOWN \"You have immigration detention facilities that were underfunded,\" he said. \"You have ICE, which does most of the actual deportations, that was radically underfunded, really sort of in some ways destroyed by the Biden administration. We're building that capacity up.\" Trump signed a number of executive orders relating to immigration when he took office in late January, including declaring an \"invasion\" at the southern border and deploying U.S. troops. BLUE STATE SUING SHERIFF'S OFFICE FOR HELPING ENFORCE IMMIGRATION LAW Reuters reported last month that the administration deported 37,660 people during Trump’s first month in office, which is below the monthly average of removals in the last full year of Biden's administration. Vance told Fox News host Laura Ingraham it will take time for deportations to increase, but the administration is making progress and working to ramp up the numbers. He praised Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Secretary Kristi Noem for her public information campaign calling on illegal migrants to self-deport and \"border czar\" Tom Homan for repurposing the CBP One app to meet Trump’s immigration goals. \"Do you remember that? It actually facilitated illegal entry under the Biden administration,\" Vance said. \"We're repurposing it to facilitate self-deportation. So what we're going to encourage a lot of people to do is we don't have to come and knock on your door and send you home. We're going to do that, of course. But before that happens, why don't you get on a plane and go home yourself? So it's an all-of-the-above approach. We're going to use everything that we can.\" The White House is struggling to increase the number of deportations due to limited U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement detention space. DHS officials told NBC News they are working with the Marshals Service, Department of Defense and Federal Bureau of Prisons to increase bed space while they ask for more resources from Congress. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth told \"The Will Cain Show\" in late January that some criminal migrants would be moved to Guantánamo Bay, a U.S. Naval base in Cuba, in the interim as the process to repatriate them to their homelands plays out. Two U.S. defense officials told Fox News that 40 migrants who were held at Guantánamo Bay, commonly known as Gitmo, were sent back to the United States and are now being held in Louisiana. It’s unclear why they were sent back and whether the United States will continue to hold migrants at that location.

The DOGE team was gracious enough to ask for big problems they can help us with.”\n\nDOGE is working across government to cancel contracts and shrink agencies.\n\nDeJoy cited a number of issues including management of retirement assets and its workers’ compensation program by other government agencies, unfunded mandates and burdensome regulatory requirements.\n\nDeJoy has led a dramatic effort to restructure the post office over the last five years — including cutting forecasted losses from $160 billion to $80 billion over a decade– that has used similar tactics to the DOGE team including shrinking the workforce and canceling or renegotiating contracts.\n\nHe said the Postal Regulatory Commission “is an unnecessary agency that has inflicted over $50 billion in damage to the Postal Service by administering defective pricing models and decades-old bureaucratic processes.”\n\nRepresentative Gerald Connolly, top Democrat on the committee overseeing USPS, said DeJoy was allowing DOGE to “infiltrate” the agency, suggesting DOGE would “undermine it, privatize it, and then profit off Americans’ loss.”\n\nGSA and DOGE did not immediately comment.\n\nLast month, two media outlets reported President Donald Trump was preparing to issue an executive order to fire the Postal Service board of governors. \n\nThe White House denied the plan but Trump said he was considering merging the Postal Service with the U.S. Commerce Department, a move Democrats said would violate federal law.\n\nMusk, a billionaire top adviser to Trump, said last week he thought USPS should be privatized.\n\nCommerce Secretary Howard Lutnick has said the Postal Service could help shrink the department’s costs by providing workers to conduct the U.S. census and handle tasks performed by 20,000 Social Security employees.\n\nThe Postal Service is adopting new service standards that will save the agency at least $36 billion over 10 years.\n\nThe Postal Service has lost more than $100 billion since 2007. \n\nLast month, it reported a fourth-quarter profit of $144 million.\n\nAs electronic communications have proliferated, the agency has been hurt by an 80% decline in first-class mail volume since 1997. \n\nVolumes are now at the lowest level since 1968.\n\nDeJoy announced last month he plans to leave after about five years on the job.","summary":"U.S. Postmaster General Louis

slams wild Jacqui Lambie call on Pine Gap","text":"A former top Canberra boffin has blasted senator Jacqui Lambie as “grossly irresponsible” following her shock call to boot the Americans from Pine Gap in retaliation for US President Donald Trump’s tariff hit on Australia.\n\nSenator Lambie recommended the dramatic move in an interview with the ABC on Thursday, saying the government needed to hit the US “back where it hurts” in response to Mr Trump’s imposition of steel and aluminium tariffs on Australian exporters.\n\n“Even though in the rule book it says we have to give them (the Americans) 12 months’ notice if we are going to remove their communications, why would we do that?” she said.\n\n“Because the hurt that they have done to Australia, through our loyalty and our mateship, and our sacrifices we have made with them in the Vietnam War, we followed them into the Middle East, and this is the way they treat their mates.\n\n“I think we need to put our foot down here.”\n\nPine Gap is a signals intelligence asset in the Northern Territory near Alice Springs that is jointly operated by Australia and the US.\n\nFormer Home Affairs secretary Mike Pezzullo said Senator Lambie’s idea to shut off US access to the facility was “grossly irresponsible” and would put Australia’s security at risk.\n\n“It is as essential to Australia’s security as it is to American security,” he told Sky News on Friday.\n\n“Threatening to shut down Pine Gap would be grossly irresponsible in terms of our own security beliefs.”\n\nSenator Lambie also suggested American Marines stationed in Darwin should be shipped out of the country.\n\n“These are the measures you can take that will not hurt our own trade,” she said.\n\n“There’s no good doing a trade war with the US, we’re not big enough.\n\n“These are the measures we can make and we can make them today and show we mean business.”\n\n“We can no longer trust our US allies.”\n\nAustralia secured an exemption from the duties during Mr Trump’s first term, but this week the Trump administration confirmed Australia would be hit.\n\nThe US imported about $638m worth of Australian steel in 2024, the UN’s COMTRADE database shows, and major ASX-listed companies like Rio Tinto will be exposed to the new taxes.\n\nPrime Minister Anthony Albanese said the decision was “unjustified” and “not a friendly act”.\n\nOn Friday, former Labor leader Bill Shorten called for retaliatory tariffs on the US.\n\n“At the end of the day, if they keep putting tariffs on all of our goods, then we’ve got to reciprocate dollar for dollar, tariff for tariff,” Mr Shorten told Channel 7’s Sunrise.\n\nMr Shorten warned that more sectors could be hit and the government needed to make it clear Australia was not a “soft mark”.\n\n“We cannot be pushed around,” he said. “And if this behaviour continues, Australia might be a bit smaller than America, but we’re not a soft mark and we need to consider putting everything on the table, as I’m sure the government will be, to fight back.”","summary":"A former top Canberra boffin has blasted a call from senator Jacqui Lambie to use Australia’s Pine Gap intelligence asset to hit back at

America","text":"Things have turned full circle after the invasion of Ukraine by Russia and more than three years of war. It makes for an interesting study in international relations or diplomacy and its cold realities, an area I comment on regularly on this page as one with a political science background. Ukraine started out seeking closer ties with Europe following the ousting of its previous pro-Russian president. Ukraine wanted to be a member of the military alliance, the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation. Former US leaders and European leaders agreed and set a process in motion. Russia warned against this and annexed Crimea from Ukraine so as to have strategic access to the Black Sea far south.\n\nRussia further warned of war as NATO continued to work towards Ukraine’s membership. Then it launched a full invasion of Ukraine three years ago, which I had condemned several times. NATO members assisted Ukraine and continued to promise membership. Now the current US President, Donald Trump, says Ukraine cannot be a member, it must talk peace, and be ready to lose 20 per cent of its land to Russia. The matter developed such that President Trump and President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine exchanged heated words in the White House, with Trump saying Ukraine’s leader would have no country left if he did not talk peace now.\n\nAfter a meeting of NATO leaders where they said they stood with Ukraine, but they would still need the US if they must support Ukraine’s war efforts, Zelensky said his nation was ready for peace talks. It was then agreed that the US and Ukraine officials would meet in Saudi Arabia for talks. The talks would include the signing of a mineral deal, a transactional arrangement to pay for US aid given to Ukraine, as well as to attract further US support for Ukraine. So, the circle is complete – moving from war to talking peace. There are colours and different hues to this diplomacy of war and peace, particularly as engaged in by the current US President.\n\nI take note of them against the backdrop of some of the submissions I made on this page in recent years regarding internal politics and how it links with international relations. Some submissions were outcomes of my observations, while others were responses to comments made by others. Here, I call attention to a few points by looking at the actions of the current occupant of the White House as they concern the war in Ukraine. I have submitted in several pieces here that institutions do not define themselves. People who work there define them, determining whether such institutions are strong or weak. Moments come in history when the actions of leaders impact their institutions and nations such that these become reference points. For instance, we know US presidents whose actions – internally and externally – are landmarks in the defining of the office and its powers. By my estimation, Trump is turning out to be one of them, and the Russia-Ukraine war is his chessboard.\n\nLately, observers have mentioned that Trump was changing the face of the US and the Western world’s diplomacy. They add that his action is changing the international order. Note, though, that Trump does not rewrite the powers of the US president. He exercises the same constitutionally allotted powers, using them the way his predecessors possibly did not. That is one way political leaders define, redefine, strengthen, and attract respect for their office, something I believe Nigeria’s President Bola Tinubu has done through some of his policies and executive orders since he arrived in office. If the actions these political leaders take are interpreted from the prism of emotion and political bias by anyone, it should not be students of political science or international relations. By training, we see these things across eras. We see international orders changing at intervals, and it is not the regular leaders who lead the process.\n\nFor instance, the 17th century Treaty of Westphalia in Europe ended a 30-year war and introduced a new order. Napoleon’s wars influenced new alliances. The end of World War 1 and WW2 changed an order. So, what drives Trump’s actions, which some see as changing the global order? He says he wants the best for his nation and people first. He wants to change the narrative of other nations taking more than the US gets in return. He wants what America gets from its relations with other nations to benefit Americans, whom he believes need it. Primarily, he wants to fulfil the promises he made to voters who sent him to the White House. This illustrates my past submission that politics and governance flow into each other, unlike the submission by some in Nigeria who often assert, “Politics has ended, and it is time to govern.” \n\nIn reality, there is no such clear dichotomy. What transpires during election campaigns guides what the winner does in office. In relating to other nations, what happens internally influences as well. National interest. It drives how nations behave in the manner they do. I agree with Trump regarding his focus on the interest of his nation and the assumptions that drive his approach, even as I have differing views on a few other issues. Nonetheless, from what he says publicly, I can see that there are no differing views from critics that the US president is not conscious of. I see that his actions are consciously taken, doing what his voters desire he does.\n\nMy reading is that Trump wants to, by any means possible, get more for his country; he wants a trajectory different from previous situations that he considers parasitic. Every political leader talks like he wants nothing in return. But Trump, the businessman, openly shows that national interest – what is in it for us – is the basis of most interactions on the international stage. So, he wants Ukraine to talk peace at any cost, one reason being that the war costs the US so much. It is a promise he made to voters. In his determination to fulfil that promise, the heated exchange between him and Zelensky in the White House happened. Then, everyone backpedals and wants to amend relations. This illustrates a few things.\n\nOne, and I explained this on this page, diplomacy is a tough job, not the all-fine-suits and smiles choreographed for TV cameras that we often see. Soldiers shoot to settle issues, diplomats sometimes engage in shouting bouts behind closed doors. That heated exchange between Trump and Zelensky is an example. The more important angle the exchange in the White House brings out is that if your nation is Ukraine in this kind of war episode, it can’t conduct itself as though it’s America. A nation is as powerful on the battlefield as its internal strengths. The same influences its negotiating power in diplomatic circles.\n\nI have supported Ukraine since this war began. But mid-February, after the US announced it was meeting with Russia in Saudi Arabia, leaving Ukraine out in the cold, I submitted thus online: “Ukraine is told it cannot join NATO, and would not get its 20 per cent seized territories back from Russia. It is a challenge when any nation depends on others in this kind of situation. On the international stage, you get a better part of the pie mainly when your nation operates from a position of independence and strength. So, what should Ukraine do? Accept the end of this war, settle to rebuild, and rebuild strategically and strongly, targeting aspects where the Kremlin would need its assistance one day in the post-Putin years. The return of its seized territories could then be Kyiv’s minimum demand. Internal and external fluidity happens to even the strongest of nations. Ukraine could wait for its opportunity.”\n\nWould the US continue supporting Ukraine to fight after a possible mineral deal is struck after it accused Ukraine of wanting to precipitate WW3? The situation does not look tidy from Ukraine’s standpoint anymore. A nation that depends on others to defend itself cannot dictate to its helpers. We should not forget too that many factors inform the extent to which nations assist others, like European nations that still depend on gas from Russia. And there are the popular wishes of voters at home. Politicians can be punished at the ballot. So, from where the effort to warm back to each other is between the US and Ukraine’s political leadership, Zelensky should get the best support that the US wants to offer. Then, Ukrainians should consider my mid-February advice.","summary":"Things have turned full circle after the invasion of Ukraine by Russia and more than three years of war.

But, unlike what many would have hoped – continued US support for Ukraine – the Trump government appeared to endorse a more Russia-friendly tone.A meeting between Trump and Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelenskyy earlier this month turned sour after Trump – together with Vice President JD Vance – berated and shouted at Zelenskyy in the White House’s Oval Office.Shortly after, Washington announced various cuts from its support for Kyiv, such as halting intelligence sharing and suspending military and financial aid to the embattled country, in an effort to pressure and force Zelenskyy to the negotiating table, with no favourable guarantees.Walesa expressed concern, warning that forcing Ukraine into a deal for the sake of achieving peace, may come with a detrimental price tag.\"I'm afraid they will force Ukraine to make a poor compromise, only that again looking at it logically, it will be a waste of 6-10 years according to my calculations and then it will all turn around,” Walesa told Euronews.The former Polish leader also noted that Ukraine is working on advancing civilisation, slamming Russia’s Vladimir Putin – and Trump – noting that their actions are regressive and backwards.\"What Ukraine is doing is due to the development of our civilisation, what Russia and even Trump are doing is retrograde, it is going backwards in development.\"Walesa also highlighted the need for European defences to step up to combat the Russian threat and prevent the war from spilling over into the wider region.\"We need to defend ourselves, we need to create protective umbrellas, but only so that there is room for reflection there, so that there is systemic change there, and so on.

And I’ve found that you can’t change anyone’s mind,” she said. “The best thing I can do is love them. That’s what I want to give to my fans, too. My music is there so hopefully they can find comfort.”\n\n As previously reported, Underwood performed at Trump's second inauguration in Washington, D.C. on Jan. 20, when she ultimately sang a cappella, asking attendees to join her. Other performers throughout Trump's inaugural events included the Village People, Nelly and Billy Ray Cyrus.\n\n As for Moroney, elsewhere in her Rolling Stone cover story, the country star opened up about her fandom of Justin Bieber and discussed her decision to remain single since last year following a split from “a regular finance dude.”\n\n “I feel like I’ve always had bad taste in men,” she said. “I had a really sweet boyfriend in fifth grade, and I broke up with him because I wanted to date the eighth-grade bad boy who had failed a bunch of times… I don’t know if this song will make my next album, but an opening line is ‘I know how to pick them. Copy, paste.’”\n\n As Moroney explained, when it comes to her own rising star, she could \"not imagine going through the past year if I was upset and crying over a dude.\"\n\n Never miss a story — sign up for PEOPLE's free daily newsletter to stay up-to-date on the best of what PEOPLE has to offer​​, from celebrity news to compelling human interest stories.\n\n Speaking with PEOPLE in July 2024, the \"No Caller ID\" singer shared that she had never “been more single.” “I really don’t have time for it right now,” she said. “I tried dating for a second and then I quickly realized that now is not the time. I think in the album you get that vibe. The love songs were very short-lived!”\n\n Moroney added, \"Unfortunately a lot of my personal life revolves around my work life, so that’s why dating right now is just not something that’s in the front of my mind. I don’t really worry about it too much.”\n\n The months to come will mark plenty of touring for Moroney, who kicks off a headlining run of shows in March and will remain on the road through October. Other highlights this year include her forthcoming Rulebreaker Award at the Billboard Women in Music Awards.","summary":"The country star shared that she's \"never happy tearing down another woman\" after her name began trending following Underwood's decision to perform in D.C.","url":"https://people.com/megan-moroney-responds-to-being-pitted-against-carrie-underwood-11696452","image":"https://people.com/thmb/U2-8gLDhVRHxZ7ZK-jkTU9B71fM=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(753x236:755x238)/megan-moroney-carrie-underwood-031325-f7d2db3cd31e4f838ba63041a7e98ca3.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-03-14 00:30:00","author":"Brenton Blanchet","authors":["Brenton Blanchet"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":0},{"id":299974004,"title":"Potential Reversal of Environmental Regulations: EPA’s Plans Raise Concerns Among States and Environmental Organizations","text":"CHICAGO (WLS) — There could be monumental changes coming to the federal agency tasked with protecting the nation’s environment, including the air we breathe and water we drink.\n\nIn the last 24 hours, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) announced what its administrator is calling the “biggest deregulatory action in U.S. history”: plans to reconsider existing and well-established environmental and climate rules and regulations.\n\nThe ABC7 I-Team has been tracking the potential significant changes that could be coming, and the impact those changes will have on local and state efforts to combat air and water pollution in Chicago.\n\nABC7 Chicago is now streaming 24/7. Click here to watch\n\nHundreds of grants to environmental nonprofits are now at risk of being canceled, all while the state of Illinois has been engaged in a court battle over $1 billion in federal funding awarded to the Illinois EPA, earmarked for clean water projects.\n\nEPA Administrator Lee Zeldin announced on Wednesday the 31 actions he’s planning to take, “driving a dagger straight into the heart of the climate change religion.”\n\nZeldin said the changes will “drive down the cost of living for American families, unleash American energy, bring auto jobs back to the U.S. and more.”\n\nAmong the established regulations that the EPA is considering undoing are rules on American power plants, the oil and gas industry, greenhouse gas emissions reporting, wastewater rules, and air quality standards.\n\nEnvironmental advocates say the moves would undo decades of combatting pollution nationwide.\n\n“I don’t think anybody voted for more toxic lead, or more forever chemicals in their drinking water, or to be having more kids having asthma or lead poisoning,” said Erik Olson, Senior Director for Health at the Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC). “Nobody wants that. But that’s going to be the result if a lot of these rollbacks go forward.”\n\nOlson said the new efforts by the EPA to roll back emission regulations on vehicles, coal, oil and gas production could have devastating health consequences for Americans.\n\n“There aren’t going to be the cops on the beat to protect against air pollution and water pollution and contaminated tap water and hazardous waste dumping,” Olson explained.\n\nThe proposed EPA deregulation initiatives still have to go through a rule making process before taking effect.\n\nBut many EPA employees fear they may lose their jobs in the coming days or weeks with President Donald Trump asking for a 65 percent reduction in staff.\n\nAlso at risk are Biden-era rules to remove forever chemicals from drinking water and hazardous lead pipes in Chicago and around the country.\n\nChicago has more lead water pipes than anywhere else in the country; a significant problem that will take years to fix.\n\nOfficials with the Chicago Department of Water Management (DWM) told the I-Team that only 10% of its lead-service line replacement funding comes from federal sources, but most of the federal funding it receives is funneled through the Illinois Environmental Protection Agency.\n\nMegan Vidis, a spokesperson for the DWM, said to date, the city has “not been notified of any freeze or revocation of federal funding for water infrastructure work.”\n\nBut the Illinois EPA has been in its own fight with the federal government over more than a billion-dollars in funding ever since President Trump took office.\n\nAccording to court filings reviewed by the I-Team, in the weeks after President Trump was sworn in, Illinois EPA officials said the agency’s allocated federal funding decreased from $1 billion to zero in a matter of days.\n\nThat funding has since been restored, and last week, a U.S. District Court judge in Rhode Island granted a preliminary injunction against the Trump Administration over its decision to freeze funding for essential federal agency grants, loans and other assistance programs, such as EPA funding.\n\nA spokesperson for the Illinois EPA told the I-Team that, “All of Illinois EPA’s federal funding continues to be available in the federal payment system at this time and we have not had issues accessing it since the preliminary injunction was granted.”\n\nThe spokesperson added that the, “Illinois EPA has not received any formal direction or guidance directly from the U.S. EPA and Illinois has no intention of ending our commitment to protecting the environment and the health of our residents in the implementation of our programs.”\n\nBut that court ruling has no impact on hundreds of grants relied upon by local environmental non-profits, like the Alliance for the Great Lakes based in Chicago, that could be frozen or cut all together.\n\nJoel Brammeier is the President and CEO of Alliance for the Great Lakes.\n\n“One of the programs that’s gotten caught up in the cuts, or indefinite deferrals is something called the ‘Great Lakes Environmental Justice grant program,'” Brammeier explained. “This is a program that’s designed to bring restoration projects to places where restoration has been few and far between over the years.”\n\nIf proposed program cuts or funding freezes are halted by litigation in court, state and city environmental advocates fear another bad scenario: Congress fully removing funding that had been previously allocated.\n\nGina Ramirez grew up on the Southeast Side of Chicago, and said she’s seen how much progress the city has made in past decades on air and water pollution.\n\nNow, Ramirez is the Midwest Director of Environmental Health for the NRDC. Ramirez said she worries that the burden of protecting the public from pollution will fall on already strained community nonprofit groups.\n\n“Streamlining the process to check for lead in your water, that might not happen anymore,” Ramirez said. “So, again, it’s on community groups that are already burned out.”","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nCHICAGO (WLS) &#8212; There could be monumental changes coming to the federal&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Potential Reversal of Environmental Regulations: EPA&#8217;s Plans Raise Concerns Among States and Environmental Organizations first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/news/us/potential-reversal-of-environmental-regulations-epas-plans-raise-concerns-among-states-and-environmental-organizations/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/ic_launcher.png","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-03-14 00:29:56","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.064},{"id":299971794,"title":"Musk Retweets ‘Hitler Didn’t Murder Millions’ Message Amid Ongoing Nazi Controversy","text":"Share to Facebook\n\nShare to Twitter\n\nShare to Linkedin\n\nTesla chief and presidential adviser Elon Musk shared a post Thursday that said public sector workers, not Nazi dictator Adolf Hitler, murdered millions of people, marking the billionaire’s latest Nazi-related post as he and his electric vehicle company face continued backlash and boycotts as critics say his embrace of right-wing politics is veering more extreme.\n\nMusk retweeted the post on Thursday.

He surprised the world when he suggested that the U.S. would look to \"demand that the Panama Canal be returned to us, in full, and without question,\" and he reiterated the issue during his Congressional address, saying he would try \"reclaiming\" the canal.Around 14,000 ships pass through the Panama Canal each year, according to figures compiled by Statista. The narrow route, first opened by the U.S. in 1914, allows cargo vessels to travel between the American continents rather than having to circumnavigate them, hugely reducing transit times and costs.What To KnowIn a memo sent to the Pentagon and viewed by CNN and NBC News, the Trump administration has ordered the department to seek \"credible military options\" that would allow the U.S. to partner with local security forces and establish a footprint on the canal.Two U.S. officials familiar with the planning told NBC that a less likely option—but one yet to be ruled out—would see the U.S. try to militarily seize the canal, but that will depend on how much the Panamanian security forces agree to partner with the U.S. The U.S. Southern Command is taking the lead on fulfilling the request, according to the reports.The goal, according to the officials, is to increase the U.S. military presence and diminish Chinese influence.CNN highlighted that the memo aligns this with the overall Trump administration emphasis on using the military to hit domestic security concerns, such as with the southern border.The outlet pointed to lines in the memo that instruct the Pentagon to \"seal our borders, repel forms of invasion including unlawful mass migration, narcotics trafficking, human smuggling and trafficking, and other criminal activities, and deport illegal aliens in coordination with the Department of Homeland Security.\"Panama has rejected accusation of Chinese influence, and the Chinese government in February accused the U.S. of \"pressuring\" Panama and using \"coercion\" to convince Panama to end an infrastructure development plan with Beijing.A Hong Kong-based conglomerate last week agreed to sell its stake in key Panama Canal ports to a consortium led by Blackrock Inc., but the Panama Canal Authority reaffirmed that the canal remains under Panamanian authority.What People Are SayingKyle Shideler, director for Homeland Security & Counterterrorism at the Center for Security Policy, wrote on X, formerly Twitter, on March 13: \"I'm sure there is an entire broom closet in the Pentagon dedicated to storing every conceivable plan for seizing the Panama Canal, which DoD has drawn up and revised yearly since 1977,\" adding in a subsequent post, \"if 1 out of 10 generals in the Pentagon can't draw up a plan to seize the Panama Canal on the back of a napkin, from memory, within 5 minutes, they should be fired.\"President Donald Trump told reporters last month: \"Panama right now. And we're talking about the Panama Canal. What they've done is terrible. They violated the agreement. They are not allowed to violate the agreement. China is running the Panama Canal. That was not given to China. That was given to Panama, foolishly. But they violated the agreement. And we're going to take it back or something very powerful is going to happen.\"What Happens NextThe Pentagon has not yet commented on the reported memo, but NBC reported that Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth is expected to visit Panama next month and has already reviewed some options that could fulfill the White House request.","summary":"The Trump administration has continued to focus on the Panama Canal as a vital asset for U.S. security.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/trump-administration-seeks-options-put-troops-panama-reports-2044631","image":"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2607054/panama-canal-shipping-container-locks.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-03-14 00:23:52","author":"Peter Aitken","authors":["Peter Aitken"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.088},{"id":299974742,"title":"‘Restrict the scope’: Donald Trump asks SC to allow order against birthright citizenship","text":"US President Donald Trump has asked the apex court to allow his administration's attempt to restrict birthright citizenship to proceed on Thursday (March 13).

Before the end of that day Ford backed off the surcharge and Trump backed down on doubling the steel and aluminum tariffs.\n\nBut still on Wednesday an additional 25 per cent import tariff was put on all steel and aluminum imports into the U.S., including from Canada.\n\nCanada responded with 25 per cent tariffs on another $29.8 billion worth of American goods, which took effect just after midnight Thursday. Canada last week applied 25 per cent tariffs to $30 billion in U.S. goods in response to the first round of tariffs from the U.S.\n\nThe meeting Thursday with Lutnick also included U.S. Trade Ambassador Jamieson Greer, and other officials from Commerce.

administration seeks Supreme Court releif on birthright citizenship injunctions","text":"March 13 (UPI) -- The Trump administration on Thursday sought permission from the Supreme Court to enforce President Donald Trump's executive order ending birthright citizenship for most people.\n\nActing Solicitor General Sarah Harris filed three nearly identical Supreme Court filings that ask the court to partially block temporary nationwide injunctions put in place by federal district court judges in Seattle, Massachusetts and Maryland.\n\n\"These cases ... raise important constitutional questions with major ramifications for securing the border,\" Harris says.\n\n\"But at this stage, the government comes to this court with a 'modest' request: while the parties litigate weighty merits questions,\" she says. \"The court should 'restrict the scope' of multiple preliminary injunctions that 'purport to cover every person in the country' [by] limiting those injunctions to parties actually within the courts' power.\"\n\nHarris says the three federal district courts have issued overlapping university injunctions on behalf of 22 states whose attorneys general sought injunctions, two organizations and seven individuals despite each court having limited jurisdictions.\n\nThe injunctions apply to hundreds of thousands of individuals who are not party to the cases before the respective courts, Harris says.\n\nThe injunctions also prevent enforcement anywhere in the country of Trump's executive order that greatly restricts application of the birthright citizenship section of the 14th Amendment.\n\n\"These overlapping injunctions prohibit federal agencies from even developing guidance about how they would implement the order,\" Harris says, adding that three federal courts of appeal refused to limit the injunctive relief in the matter.\n\nHarris says it's a \"relatively new phenomenon\" for federal district court judges to enter injunctions to \"'govern the whole nation from their courtrooms.'\"\n\nSuch universal injunctions are \"'legally and historically dubious'\" and \"transgress constitutional limits on courts' powers,which extend only to 'rendering a judgment or decree upon the rights of the litigants,'\" Harris says.\n\n\"Universal injunctions have reached epidemic proportions since the start of the current administration\" and \"compromise the executive branch's ability to carry out its functions,\" Harris says.\n\n\"Courts have graduated from universal preliminary injunctions to universal restraining orders, from universal equitable relief to universal monetary remedies,\" Harris adds, \"and from governing the whole nation to governing the whole world.\"\n\nFederal district court judges also have issued more universal injunctions and temporary restraining orders during February 2025 alone than through the first three years of the Biden administration,\" Harris says.\n\n\"That sharp rise in universal injunctions stops the executive branch from performing its constitutional functions before any courts fully examine the merits of those actions and threatens to swamp this court's emergency docket,\" she says.\n\nThe current injunctions also extend to all 50 states and to millions of aliens throughout the nation even though \"tailored interim relief for the plaintiffs to these suits would fully redress their alleged harms,\" Harris says.\n\nHarris filed the requests on Trump's behalf and said the way birthright citizenship currently is interpreted creates \"strong incentives\" for illegal immigration to the United States.\n\nFederal courts for more than 150 years have supported the birthright citizenship interpretation of the 14th Amendment to apply to anyone born in the United States, CNN reported.\n\nThe ACLU Immigrants' Rights Project and pro-immigrant advocacy group CASA are the two organizational plaintiffs in the matter.\n\n\"The president's executive order is outrageously illegal and cruel, and it should not be applied to a single baby in this country,\" attorney Cody Wofsy, deputy director of the ACLU Immigrants' Rights Project, told CNN.\n\n\"We are going to continue fighting to ensure that no child is denied their citizenship by this executive order,\" Wofsy said.","summary":"The Trump administration on Thursday sought permission from the Supreme Court to enforce

that stopped her from blaming the elderly president right before her initial debate with Trump","text":"Joe Biden simply told Kamala Harris ‘no daylight, kid’ as she prepared for her debate with Donald Trump – preventing the vice president from distancing herself from Biden’s unpopular policies.\n\nThe failed Harris-Tim Walz campaign has been passing around blame like a hot potato post-election, with everyone from the candidates themselves to top staffers taking the heat.\n\nHowever, already many have blamed Biden, 82, for being an albatross on the neck of his potential successor.\n\nA new book – FIGHT: Inside the Wildest Battle for the White House by Jonathan Allen and Amie Parnes – suggests that the president demanded complete loyalty from Harris.\n\nOn the day of Harris’ first debate with Trump, Biden allegedly called the vice president for a pep talk.\n\nHowever, it turned out to be more instructions to protect Biden’s legacy, with a three-word warning.\n\n‘No daylight, kid,’ Biden reportedly said to the then 59-year-old Harris. \n\nBiden would regularly use that phrase to tie John McCain to George W. Bush ahead of the 2008 election when he ran with Barack Obama. \n\nThe authors posit that whether Harris won or lost, ‘she would only harm him by publicly distancing herself from him.’\n\nBiden’s staffers remained with the Harris campaign, making it even more difficult to publicly refute the president. \n\nSean Clegg, a Harris advisor not trusted by the Biden staffers, was helping her prepare for a joint appearance with Walz when she started listing things that she and Biden accomplished when he stopped her. \n\n‘Wait, wait, wait! Let’s not do this. Let’s not go down memory lane,’ he said, according to an excerpt published by The Hill.\n\nClegg was reportedly disinvited from future media prep sessions by longtime Dem communications staffer Stephanie Cutter. \n\nHarris aides previously claimed that the Biden team was deliberately not working with them as a result of the president being forced to drop out..\n\nPreviously, Biden was blamed by senior Harris advisor David Plouffe, but for refusing to drop out earlier in the race after his June debate disaster.\n\nPlouffe claimed no Democratic candidate could have won without a proper primary process—what he called ‘the cardinal sin’ of this race.\n\nAnd he said he was shocked by the internal polling numbers when he finally joined the team after Joe Biden dropped out with less than four months to go, a situation he described as ‘catastrophic.’\n\n‘When I got in, it was the first time I saw the actual numbers under the hood. They were pretty gruesome,’ he told The Atlantic.\n\n‘The Sun Belt was worse than the Blue Wall, but the Blue Wall was bad. And, demographically, young voters across the board—Hispanic voters, Black voters, Asian voters—were in really terrible shape. \n\n‘When the switch happened, some of that stuff got a little bit better, but nowhere near where we ended up or where we needed to be. This was a rescue mission. \n\n‘It was catastrophic in terms of where it was.’ \n\nBiden finally bowed to pressure from allies and stood aside on July 21.\n\nThe party quickly coalesced around his vice president to become the candidate, avoiding a drawn out contest that some feared would divide Democrats and hand the election to Trump but to no avail.\n\n‘I’m not sure, given the headwinds, any Democrat could have won,’ said Plouffe. \n\n‘But if we had a primary in which a bunch of people ran and auditioned … through that process, whoever emerged … would have been a more fully formed person, would have had more time to mount a general election campaign. \n\n‘[Not having that process] is the cardinal sin.’\n\nAnd then they had to condense a campaign down into a little more than 100 days. \n\n‘Our first week, it was like, “Well, we need a biography ad, we need to talk about the border, we need to lay out an economic contrast, we need to get health care in there, abortion,'” Plouffe said. \n\n‘If you have six, seven, eight months, you storyboard all this stuff, you have a narrative arc. Everything was smashed and collided here.’\n\nBiden and Harris’ teams blamed each other for wasting over $1 billion in donor cash on a disastrous presidential campaign. \n\nVice Presidential flop Tim Walz blamed himself and Harris for the Democrats ‘ ‘mess’ after their losses at the top of the ticket in November. \n\nWalz and Harris lost every single swing state to Trump, leading to an electoral college blowout, becoming the first Democrat ticket to lose the popular vote since 2004 and just the second since 1988.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nJoe Biden simply told Kamala Harris &#8216;no daylight, kid&#8217; as she prepared for her&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Biden&#8217;s brief advice to Kamala Harris that stopped her from blaming the elderly president right before her initial debate with Trump first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/news/us/bidens-brief-advice-to-kamala-harris-that-stopped-her-from-blaming-the-elderly-president-right-before-her-initial-debate-with-trump/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/rewrite-this-title-Bidens-three-word-warning-to-Kamala-Harris.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-03-14 00:13:03","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.434},{"id":299975390,"title":"‘Breaking the Deadlock Was Crucial’ – NATO Chief Flatters Trump on Peace Initiative","text":"NATO chief Mark Rutte spoke flatteringly of Donald Trump’s effort to end the war in Ukraine, and about the US President in general when the two met in Washington on Thursday.\n\n“[On] Ukraine, you broke the deadlock, as you said; all the killing, the young people dying, cities getting destroyed,” Rutte said in his prepared remarks. “The fact that you did that, that you started the dialogue with the Russians and the successful talks in Saudi Arabia, now with the Ukrainians, I really want to commend you for this.”\n\nThe diplomatic former Dutch prime minister did not bring up the role he played in de-escalating tensions between team Trump and Ukrainian leader Volodymyr Zelensky after the latter was verbally ambushed in the White House, with insults ranging from his alleged lack of gratitude towards the US to his choice of attire.\n\nInstead, Rutte continued to soothe the mercurial president’s ego with compliments on his role in initiating the peace process with Ukraine and Russia, stressing, “Breaking the deadlock, that was crucial.” \n\nMost of their remarks centered around the recent push to ramp up defense spending on both sides of the Atlantic.\n\nWhat happened the last couple of weeks is really staggering,” Rutte noted. “The Europeans committing to a package of 800 billion in defense spending. The Germans now potentially up to half a trillion extra in defense spending. And then, of course, you have Keir Starmer here, the British Prime Minister, and others all committing to much higher defense spending. \n\nFor his part, Trump stared by congratulating himself, and then had praise for Rutte, one of the few European leaders for whom the president has many nice things to say.\n\n“When I first went to NATO ... I noticed that very few people were paying,” Trump said. “I was able to raise hundreds of billions of dollars... the money started pouring in and NATO became much stronger because of my actions.”\n\nHe added, “NATO is stepping up. This man is a man that only knows how to step up.”\n\nAnd then the conversation turned to the president’s plan to somehow pry Greenland out of Denmark’s control, and the Dutchman’s tone turned from charming to defensive.\n\n“I think it will happen,” Trump said, before gesturing towards Rutte with his thumb and adding: “I didn’t give it much thought before but I’m sitting with a man that could be very instrumental” in that.\n\n“You know, Mark, we need that for international security... we have a lot of our favorite players cruising around the coast and we have to be careful,” Trump said he said, referring to rising Chinese and Russian interest boosting their presence in the Arctic.\n\nAccording to an AFP reporter, the NATO chief “flashed an embarrassed grin and sat back in his armchair, legs crossed, as he said that he wanted to remain ‘outside this discussion’ of Greenland joining the United States or not.\n\n“I don’t want to drag NATO into that,” Rutte said.

Charging stations have been burned and dealerships vandalized.\n\nShots were fired at a Tesla showroom in Portland, Ore.\n\nA woman in Colorado who attacked a Tesla dealership, including with a Molotov cocktail, was subsequently arrested near the location with more makeshift bombs in her car. \n\nA Tesla charging station in South Carolina was also Molotov-cocktailed. The vandal spray-painted “LONG LIVE UKRAINE” on the ground.\n\nIn Ukraine, they prepared Molotov cocktails to blunt the advance of Russian tanks closing in on Kyiv; in America, progressive activists use them to stick it to an entrepreneur whose politics they don’t like. \n\nOf course, Teslas have been painted with swastikas, as if a streamlined federal government is an indicator of incipient fascism.\n\nAs always, the Left is bizarrely incapable of distinguishing between libertarianism — Musk wants more freedom and less government — and totalitarianism. \n\nOn the merits, the contrast between Musk and his enemies is a good one for him: He is the creator; they are the destroyers. \n\nThat doesn’t mean the protests and mayhem aren’t having an effect; Tesla sales had already been dropping, and the “Tesla Takedown” is likely to accelerate the trend. \n\nPart of the point is intimidation. The agitation is meant to exact a price on Musk for DOGE and get him to abandon the effort, as well as to make Tesla’s workers and the company’s consumers afraid.\n\nNo one wants to buy an expensive vehicle and then become a political target or have their car vandalized. \n\nMuch mockery was directed at President Donald Trump for touting the wonders of Teslas at a White House event, but the president was trying to counteract a campaign of harassment and vengeance directed at one of his top advisers, whom he believes is doing good and necessary work. \n\nAsked by a reporter if he’d consider the anti-Tesla violence domestic terrorism, Trump said “yes,” and rightly so. \n\nThe Code of Federal Regulations defines terrorism as “the unlawful use of force and violence against persons or property to intimidate or coerce a government, the civilian population, or any segment thereof, in furtherance of political or social objectives.”\n\nPart of the definition of domestic terrorism, according to the Patriot Act, is acts “dangerous to human life” intended “to influence the policy of a government by intimidation or coercion.”\n\nMusk enjoys being a provocateur. Yet, when he or his supporters talk of burning things down, they mean it metaphorically.\n\nHis witless and inflamed enemies, on the other hand, are willing to literally burn things down.\n\nIt is darkly amusing to see people who claim electric cars are necessary to save the planet attack the most successful EV brand in the country, and take out the kind of charging stations that President Joe Biden labored so mightily and futilely to build. \n\nThe left still doesn’t have an answer to Donald Trump, but they’ve sure found a cudgel against one of American industry’s most innovative products. \n\nTwitter: @RichLowry","summary":"The agitation is meant to exact a price on Musk for DOGE and get him to abandon the effort: No one wants to buy an expensive vehicle and then become a political target","url":"https://nypost.com/2025/03/13/opinion/tesla-terrorism-only-reveals-the-lefts-impotence/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/03/newspress-collage-wt7uswc11-1741905793152.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&1741891468&w=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-03-14 00:04:15","author":"Rich Lowry","authors":["Rich Lowry"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.303},{"id":299975104,"title":"Trump's US-Ireland trade deficit obsession is part of a wider battle, but how hurt could Ireland get?","text":"Advertisement\n\nWe need your help now\n\nSupport from readers like you keeps The Journal open.\n\nYou are visiting us because we have something you value.

All the normal, safe topics.\n\nThe one time when things seemed to take a bit of a turn was when Donald Trump brought up the supposed US trade deficit with Ireland.\n\n‘We have a massive deficit with Ireland. Because Ireland was very smart. They took our pharmaceutical companies… they made it very good for companies to move over there,” he said.\n\nMartin was forced to push back, arguing that it’s a ‘two-way street’ between the countries and highlighting US investments by the likes of Ryanair and AerCap.\n\nBut what is a trade deficit, and why does Trump care about it so much?\n\nA trade deficit is when there’s an imbalance in trade between two countries – where one is importing more than it exports.\n\nSo if Ireland sells (meaning exports) €100 billion of goods to the US, but the US only exports €90 billion to Ireland, there’s a trade deficit of €10 billion in Ireland’s favour.\n\nUnless trade is perfectly balanced between two countries, which basically doesn’t happen, there will always be something of a deficit on one side.\n\nWhat Trump seems to be annoyed about is the supposed size of the US trade deficit with Ireland.\n\nHe has implied that the reason for a big trade deficit between Ireland and the US is because so many US businesses have moved their production to Ireland.\n\nBasically, Ireland is doing very well from US companies, whereas the US doesn’t get much from Irish firms.\n\nSo, are Trump’s claims correct?\n\nWell, kind of. Exports cover two main areas – goods and services.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen it comes to goods, there is a big deficit in Ireland’s favour.\n\nUS figures show that the US had a trade deficit in goods with Ireland of $87 billion (€80 billion) in 2024.\n\nFigures from Ireland’s Central Statistics Office actually put this slightly higher, estimating a goods deficit of €93 billion for the year. This was up €18 billion compared to 2023.\n\nThe deficit likely mostly relates to pharmaceutical companies, as many US pharma firms have their production based in Ireland and then ship products back to the US.\n\nBut then there’s the other side of the coin – services.\n\nHere, it’s estimated there’s a €163 billion billion deficit in the US’s favour.\n\nThe picture here gets a bit skewed by multinational activities. Many of the services counted in this number are likely the Irish subsidiaries of US multinationals making payments to their parent companies.\n\nThis is because many big US firms have their intellectual property located in Ireland. This has traditionally been done to enable profit-shifting, which we looked at in more detail here.\n\nThis means talk of a trade deficit is more complicated than the goods figures would suggest. The CSO estimated that in the final three months of 2024, Ireland had a €54 billion deficit with the US when both goods and services were counted.\n\nBut – basically, Trump does not seem to notice or care about the services deficit in the US’s favour, and has repeatedly highlighted the goods deficit instead.\n\nWhy does Trump care anyway? \n\nWhen it comes down to it – Trump’s whole shtick is American jobs, for Americans.\n\nHe wants to put as much pressure as possible on US companies to make their products in the US.\n\nTrump likely isn’t poring over CSO data and checking how the Ireland-US goods deficit lines up with the service deficit.\n\nHe invokes the ‘trade deficit’ with Ireland so often as a way of putting pressure on companies to have more of their production in the US. This is also why he made his comments about Ireland ‘taking’ US pharma companies.\n\nThe real question is what concrete action will follow his words.\n\nAs outlined, a decent chunk of the US-Ireland trade deficit – when it comes to services – is likely due to multinational jiggery pokery.\n\nRelated Reads\n\n'Taking back what was stolen': How Trump is selling yesterday's Oval Office meeting to his followers\n\n'Trump ranted as Martin sat awkwardly next to him': What the world is saying about the US visit\n\nHamas welcomes Trump's 'nobody is expelling any Palestinians' comment during Taoiseach visit\n\nThis is something which is largely attributed to the US tax system – not the Irish one – as it has a unique way of allowing US companies to book their overseas profits.\n\nBut there is also the real consideration of a big chunk of American companies producing goods here and selling them back to the US.\n\nChanging some of the US rules on taxation could go some way towards making US companies operating in Ireland change their way of doing business. Produce more in the US, and less in Ireland.\n\nBut that is a change to the US’s own rules. And that would likely affect services more than goods.\n\nIf Trump wants American companies located in Ireland to produce more goods in the US, he’s more likely to turn to tariffs.\n\nThese would come in the form of the tariffs he’s threatened to impose on the EU. Even yesterday, he threatened to impose 200% tariffs on wine, champagne and other alcoholic products from European Union countries. \n\nThe two leaders in Washington on Wednesday.Alamy\n\nBy extension, this would make it more expensive for American companies in Ireland to sell their goods back to the US.\n\nTrump would hope, by making it more expensive to sell goods from Ireland, American companies would instead choose to produce more goods in the US. This is a particular concern for the huge number of US pharma firms here.\n\nSo when Trump raises the US-Ireland trade deficit, he doesn’t care too much about the specific number. It’s more what it represents in his eyes.\n\nWhich is US companies being lured to the EU, which then benefits from these American businesses. While the US supposedly doesn’t benefit as much from EU businesses.\n\nThis is why Martin was eager to highlight the likes of Ryanair and AerCap. To show that the US does benefit from Irish businesses.\n\nBut in this context, Trump seems more interested in raising Ireland’s ‘trade deficit’ as an example of an EU country ‘taking advantage of’ the US.\n\nThis in turn is meant to put more pressure on the EU, and justify Trump’s move to impose tariffs on the bloc.\n\nThe issue here is broader than Ireland and the US – it’s the US and the EU.\n\nIreland will just have to hope it doesn’t get caught too badly in the crossfire.\n\nReaders like you are keeping these stories free for everyone...\n\nA mix of advertising and supporting contributions helps keep paywalls away from valuable information like this article.\n\nOver 5,000 readers like you have already stepped up and support us with a monthly payment or a once-off donation.\n\nSupport The Journal\n\nPaul O'Donoghue\n\nView 7 comments\n\nSend Tip or Correction\n\nEmbed this post\n\nTo embed this post, copy the code below on your site\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEmail “Trump's US-Ireland trade deficit obsession is part of a wider battle, but how hurt could Ireland get?”.\n\nRecipient's Email\n\nFeedback on “Trump's US-Ireland trade deficit obsession is part of a wider battle, but how hurt could Ireland get?”.\n\nYour Feedback\n\nYour Email (optional)\n\nReport a Comment\n\nPlease select the reason for reporting this comment.\n\nPlease give full details of the problem with the comment...\n\nThis is YOUR comments community.

The Japanese defenders lost more than 18,000 men in the fighting for an island that covers less than 30 sq km, while the US lost over 6,800 personnel killed.\nIshiba, Hegseth and Nakatani are likely to visit the invasion beaches on the south coast of the island and memorials to the fallen, and drive to the top of Mount Suribachi, the active volcano at the far southwest tip of the island that was one of the key defensive positions that the US Marines had to overcome.\n\nThey are also expected to pay their respects at the US memorial at the top of the peak, close to where the iconic photo of marines raising the flag was taken in 1945.\nA Japanese government official told the Asahi newspaper that the joint visit would be “a symbol of the strong defence cooperation by two nations that once engaged in bloody fighting”.\nIshiba’s visit will be the first by a serving Japanese prime minister since Shinzo Abe in April 2013, with Fuji Television quoting a cabinet official as saying that Ishiba has “strong feelings about the 80th anniversary of the end of the war”.\nHegseth is expected to hold talks with his Japanese counterpart in Tokyo after the visit, with the Japanese side anticipating discussions on closer command-and-control operations between the two nations’ militaries and future “two-plus-two” policy meetings of the defence and foreign ministers.\nThe US side is likely to call on Tokyo to increase defence spending from the planned target of 2 per cent of GBP by financial year 2027. The Trump administration has demanded that all US allies should be spending at least 3 per cent of GDP on defence and has threatened not to come to the aid of nations that fail to meet that threshold.","summary":"Tokyo hopes joint memorial will underline commitment to security alliance, but Hegseth expected to ask Japan to do more to defend itself, analysts say.","url":"https://www.scmp.com/week-asia/politics/article/3302228/japan-us-mark-80th-anniversary-iwo-jima-battle-amid-trade-tensions","image":"https://cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2025/03/13/992635d2-ccc1-4071-9625-b2a8e68bbfae_57d0e054.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-03-14 00:00:20","author":"Julian Ryall","authors":["Julian Ryall"],"language":"en","source_country":"cn","sentiment":0.077},{"id":299967636,"title":"Ontario U.S. energy surcharge still suspended after ‘productive’ meeting","text":"A surcharge on energy exported from Ontario into the United States will continue to be suspended, according to the premier’s office, after a high-stakes meeting with President Donald Trump’s commerce secretary.\n\nPremier Doug Ford’s team confirmed Thursday afternoon the short-lived energy surcharge would not be reintroduced after a sit-down with Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, which Ford described as “the best meeting I’ve ever had” in Washington.\n\nDespite the premier’s glowing appraisal of the talks, the United States has not offered any tariff exemptions or carveouts for either Canada or Ontario as a result of the discussions.\n\nFord had previously said he would only drop Ontario tariff retaliation measures like the energy surcharge when there were “zero tariffs” on Canadian goods being imported to the United States.\n\nThursday’s discussions capped off a dramatic week in which Ford finally caught the attention of President Trump with a 25 per cent charge on all electricity sold from his province to New York, Minnesota and Michigan.\n\nTrump noticed the charge and threatened to pound Canada with economic measures in response, starting by doubling a tariff on steel and aluminum to 50 per cent. Hours later, Ford said the energy surcharge would be paused after a meeting with Lutnick was arranged,.\n\nFord said the meeting and a call with Lutnick were an “olive branch” from the White House. Trump also dropped his retaliatory tariff but did not exempt Canada or Ontario from 25 per cent global steel and aluminum tariffs.\n\nFord pointed out that Lutnick had called him to discuss the surcharge and said not pausing the measure for talks would be the “worst thing” he could do in a negotiation.\n\nTrump and Lutnick both characterized it as an embarrassing climbdown, calling the surcharge Ontario’s “little threat” and saying Ford was forced to back off within hours. “He knows he made a mistake and he withdrew it,” Lutnick said of Ford in one media interview.\n\nBefore the meeting took place, those close to Ford acknowledged heading down to Washington D.C. was “taking a chance” as the president took potshots at Canada and Ontario in the media.\n\nWhen he emerged from his meeting in Washington on Thursday afternoon, Ford hailed it as a success, although he acknowledged he had not managed to change the U.S. position on tariffs.\n\n“I just want to thank the secretary for the opportunity to go in there and stay this long and communicate,” Ford said.\n\n“We shared a tremendous amount of views back and forth and I’m feeling very positive… this I can honestly say was the best meeting I’ve ever had coming down here.”\n\nFederal ministers Dominic LeBlanc and François-Philippe Champagne also attended the meeting, along with the Canadian ambassador to the United States.\n\nAs a result of that sit-down, Ford’s team said the energy surcharge which sparked tensions at the start of the week would not be reintroduced.\n\n“Given today’s productive discussion and next week’s meeting to continue talking, surcharge will remain on pause,” the premier’s office said in a statement to Global News.\n\nWhat happens next is unclear. Ford hinted another meeting would take place but his team have said the next round of discussions will involve officials in Ontario, Canada and the United States, not the premier.\n\nFord’s spokesperson also clarified that the premier and commerce secretary had “set the priorities” and it was not “over to the officials” to move forward.\n\nWhile Ford described how well the meeting had gone in his view, he admitted nothing had changed on the tariff front.\n\n“We’re having very productive conversations — it turned out very, very well,” Ford said. “It was very, very good. Very, very civil.”\n\nThe decision to pause the energy surcharge while U.S. tariffs on steel and aluminum remain in place marks a change of stance for the premier. Previously Ford had he would not remove any of his retaliatory measures until there were “zero tariffs” from the U.S.\n\n“President Trump’s tariffs are a disaster for the U.S. economy. They’re making life more expensive for American families and businesses,” Ford said on Monday when he introduced the short-lived charge.\n\n“Until the threat of tariffs is gone for good, Ontario won’t back down. We’ll stand strong, use every tool in our toolkit and do whatever it takes to protect Ontario.”\n\nOther tariff response measures in Ontario, like a ban on U.S. companies bidding for public contracts and a prohibition on U.S. alcohol, are still in place.\n\nIt’s unclear how long the energy charge could remain paused or the metrics Ontario is using to evaluate success in its negotiations.\n\nA senior government source previously said the surcharge would be paused if the meeting led to tariff removal — or if they believed the conversations that took place during it would provide a route to achieving that.\n\nTrump has promised the next round of tariffs to hit on April 2, including across Canadian industries.","summary":"Premier Doug Ford's team confirmed Thursday afternoon the short-lived energy surcharge would not be reintroduced after a sitdown with United States Commerce Sec.

It is currently blocked nationwide.\n\nBirthright citizenship automatically makes anyone born in the United States an American citizen, including children born to mothers in the country illegally. The right was enshrined soon after the Civil War in the Constitution’s 14th Amendment.\n\nTrump and his supporters have argued that there should be tougher standards for becoming an American citizen, which he called “a priceless and profound gift” in his executive order.\n\nLegal scholars, though, have said its the 14th Amendment’s constitutional protections would make it it extremely difficult to overturn.\n\nHere is a look at birthright citizenship, what Trump has said about it and the prospects for ending it:\n\nWhat Trump has said about birthright citizenship\n\nTrump has said for years that he wants to end birthright citizenship.\n\n“It’s ridiculous. We are the only country in the world that does this with the birthright, as you know, and it’s just absolutely ridiculous,” he said in January. Dozens of countries, mostly in the Americas, have birthright citizenship.\n\nOpponents say the practice encourages people to come to the U.S. illegally so their children can have citizenship. Others argue that ending birthright citizenship would profoundly damage the country.\n\nIts elimination “could eventually place every single person in America in the precarious position of having to prove American citizenship,” Alex Nowrasteh, vice president for economic and social policy studies at the pro-immigration Cato Institute, wrote after Trump’s order.\n\nIn 2019, the Migration Policy Institute estimated that 5.5 million children under age 18 lived with at least one parent in the country illegally in 2019, representing 7% of the U.S. child population. The vast majority of those children were U.S. citizens.\n\nWhat does the law say?\n\nCongress ratified the 14th Amendment in July 1868, soon after the Civil War.\n\n“All persons born or naturalized in the United States and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States,” the amendment says.\n\nBut it didn’t always apply to everyone. It wasn’t until 1924, for example, that Congress granted citizenship to all Native Americans born in the U.S.\n\nSupporters of immigration restrictions, including Trump, have argued the words “subject to the jurisdiction thereof” allow the U.S. to deny citizenship to babies born to women in the country illegally.\n\nWhat is the basis of this legal appeal?\n\nThe emergency appeal does not focus directly on whether the presidential order is legally valid. Instead, it is aimed at the broad reach of orders issued by federal judges.\n\nThe Justice Department argues individual judges lack the power to make their rulings go into affect nationwide. Five of the Supreme Court’s conservative justices have raised concerns in the past about these nationwide injunctions. The high court, though, has never ruled on the matter.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nThe Trump administration is pushing for the the U.S. Supreme Court to&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: What is the Trump administration&#8217;s latest move to limit citizenship by birth? first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/news/us/what-is-the-trump-administrations-latest-move-to-limit-citizenship-by-birth/","image":"https://res.cloudinary.com/graham-media-group/image/upload/f_auto/q_auto/c_thumb,w_700/v1/media/gmg/YYBQX3M5CNHCFBS3KSORMH6QGA.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-03-13 23:53:10","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.324},{"id":299971548,"title":"Barely: House GOP passes government funding bill without help from Democrats","text":"We learned something on Capitol Hill this week. House Republicans can pass a government funding bill without Democratic assistance. Barely. 217-213. Republicans could only lose one vote. And that’s all they lost: Rep. Thomas Massie, R-Ky. THE HITCHHIKER'S GUIDE TO WHERE WE STAND WITH A POTENTIAL GOVERNMENT SHUTDOWN The GOP bill even picked up one Democratic yea: Rep. Jared Golden, D-Maine. Passing government funding bills on their own wasn’t always the case for the House GOP. Republicans have held the House majority for more than two years now. The GOP majority consistently leaned on Democrats – serving in the minority – for many of the votes to keep the government open and lift the debt ceiling. But that changed late Tuesday afternoon as House Republicans approved their own bill to keep the lights on. But before the vote, House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., berated Democrats for opposing the temporary spending package, known as a \"Continuing Resolution\" or \"CR.\" \"If Congressional Democrats refuse to support this clean CR, they will be responsible for every troop who misses a paycheck. For every flight delay from reduced staffing at TSA. For every negative consequence that comes from shutting down the government,\" said Johnson. It was unclear if Johnson could pass the bill with just Republicans. Especially as the Speaker upbraided Democrats for vowing to vote nay. \"You continually criticize the Democrats,\" yours truly said to the Speaker. \"Doesn't that imply that you don't have the votes on your side? Because you wouldn’t need Democratic assistance to keep the government?\" \"No. We will have the votes,\" responded Johnson. \"We’re going to pass the CR and we can do it on our own.\" A few hours later, the Speaker made good on his promise. But he had an assist. Vice President JD Vance came to the Capitol to assuage fears of skeptical House Republicans Tuesday morning. But Vance didn’t quite close the deal. \"I saw some looks in there that didn't leave me feeling good as to securing the votes of those who may be having questions,\" said Rep. Mark Alford, R-Mo., after the House Republican conclave with Vance. Rep. Kat Cammack, R-Fla., and others said they needed more assurances about future spending cuts. Rep. Tim Burchett, R-Tenn., said he would \"pray\" about how to vote on the bill. But heading into the meeting, Burchett conceded he hadn’t yet experienced any political intercession. \"I'm uncomfortable with giving the Pentagon more money, even though overall, we're cutting,\" said Burchett. By afternoon, Burchett told me he was \"closer,\" but still not there. And when the House voted, it passed the bill. REPORTER'S NOTEBOOK: HERE WE GO AGAIN (AGAIN) But what made the difference when it came to convincing skittish Republicans to vote yes? Rep. Eric Burlison, R-Mo., told Fox he was \"barely\" for the CR. \"What's the ‘barely’ part?\" I asked. \"The ‘barely\" is Donald Trump. He is the difference maker. I would never support this language. But I do trust Donald Trump,\" said Burlison. \"He's not let me down. I think that he is a man of his word. And so I believe him when he's when he says he's going to get it done.\" But that was only half of the battle. The bill earned the support of all but one Senate Republican. But 60 votes are necessary to break a filibuster. Republicans only have 53 GOP members. So that would entail assistance from Democrats. Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., said he opposed the bill because it didn’t cut spending. Paul said he didn’t get any blowback from the President or fellow Republicans on his position. \"People know kind of where I am. I'm pretty consistent on opposing debt and opposing spending,\" said Paul. Contrast the silence Paul has heard to how President Trump unloaded on his Bluegrass State colleague, Thomas Massie. Mr. Trump argued that Massie should face a primary for his defection. Sen. John Fetterman, D-Penn., is the only Democrat on the record support the stopgap spending bill. So, it’s about the math. With only 52 Republicans primed to crack a filibuster, that means the Senate needs eight Democrats to vote yes. That includes Fetterman. Note that they don’t have to vote yes on the bill. Just to overcome the filibuster. Republicans can pass the bill on their own with a simple majority. This leaves Democrats as badly torn as any party in recently on any issue. On one hand, Democrats don’t want to shutter the government. They fear that will imperil already skittish federal workers. And it could lead to additional cuts from Elon Musk and DOGE if federal workers aren’t on the job. On the other hand, they want to be seen as fighting for their base and rally against President Trump and Musk. But it is often the darkest before the dawn. TRUMP'S UNION-ENDORSED PICK CONFIRMED BY SENATE TO LEAD LABOR DEPARTMENT Democrats must either go to the mat or try to salvage something before the 11:59:59 pm et government funding deadline Friday. There are rattlings that Democrats may ask for votes on a universe of amendments – none of which would pass. But at least Democrats could save face – telling their loyalists that they fought for their values and tried to stand up to the President and Musk. They could also make the case that a shutdown is worse than keeping the government open. Fox is told senators would be interested in votes on the following subjects: Fetterman appeared to be the only Democrat willing to vote for the GOP interim spending bill, but Thursday, Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) announced he would vote for it. And it’s possible that a vote on a set of amendments could unlock a few Democratic votes to break a filibuster on the bill. But tensions are now running high. Reporters staking out a meeting of Senate Democrats talking about the shutdown heard who they believe was Sen. Kirstin Gillibrand, D-N.Y., screaming at her colleagues through he thick Capitol walls. Multiple Senate Democrats were utterly silent as they left a lengthy Senate Democratic Caucus. None of the senators approached by Fox were willing to talk – even though some are quite loquacious under other circumstances. In fact Fox even asked several of the Democrats if they were told not to say anything. Several replied \"no comment.\" Quiet on Capitol Hill often means something is up and that lawmakers are trying to broker a very fragile deal. It also means that lawmakers are fuming. There was genuine fear among Democrats that a government shutdown could permanently imperil the federal government and perhaps trigger additional layoffs of thousands of federal workers. Here’s the other problem: If the government shut down, no one is quite sure HOW it could re-open. It’s about the math. And the calculus under those circumstances simply did not work to for the House and Senate to eventually pass the same bill and re-open the government. That calculus simply did not seem to work. That’s why Schumer made the decision to support the Band-Aid spending bill – as risky as it is. This is why multiple Senate Democrats refused to comment on what Schumer told them at the closed-door caucus meeting today. That’s why tempers flared and Sen. Kirstin Gillibrand (D-N.Y.) was heard yelling through the thick Senate walls. But this is not without peril for Schumer. He needs to convince six other Democrats (for a grand total of eight) to support overcoming a filibuster. There are 53 Senate Republicans. 60 votes are needed to avert a filibuster. Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) is a no. So the deficit is eight. Schumer and Sen. John Fetterman (D-Penn.) are the first two Democrats to say they are willing to vote to overcome a filibuster. So Schumer needs six more. If he can’t find those votes, the government will close. And Schumer will have committed a tremendous tactical error. As the saying goes, a leader with no followers is just a man out for a walk. Former House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, used to say that \"nothing good\" ever happens when Congress has been in session for more than three consecutive weeks. Members grow angry. Antsy. Tempers are short. Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., noted that the Senate has met for ten consecutive weeks. \"Senators have been seeing a lot of each other lately. In fact, too much,\" said Thune. That includes three all-night sessions and weekend sessions. This period is the longest stretch of consecutive weeks for Senate activity in 15 years. The Senate is scheduled to be out next week for the first time this year. A government shutdown trashes the recess. Senators have barely seen their family members. It’s been a frenetic pace.

And if the Senate aligns with the House, they will have averted a government shutdown.

The alleged incidents occurred in the 1980s.\n\n An Oklahoma grand jury indicted Robert Preston Morris, 63, on five counts of lewd or indecent acts with a child on Wednesday, March 12. The alleged sexual misconduct began in December 1982, when Morris was visiting the child's family in Hominy, Okla., for Christmas, and continued for four years. The alleged victim was 12 years old at the time, the Oklahoma Attorney General said in a press release.\n\n “There can be no tolerance for those who sexually prey on children,” said Attorney General Gentner Drummond. “This case is all the more despicable because the alleged perpetrator was a pastor who exploited his position. The victim in this case has waited far too many years for justice to be done.”\n\n The press release noted that the statute of limitations does not apply in this case as Morris has never lived in Oklahoma.\n\n The indictment against Morris alleged the former pastor had \"lewd or lascivious\" contact with the child throughout the early 1980s.\n\n The victim's name is not disclosed in the press release or indictment.\n\n The charges come nearly a year after a woman named Cindy Clemishire alleged to ABC affiliate WFAA that Morris sexually abused her from 1982 to 1987.\n\n Clemshire said Wednesday, via her attorney, that she is grateful Morris has been indicted, per Texas Tribune.\n\n “After almost 43 years, the law has finally caught up with Robert Morris for the horrific crimes he committed against me as a child,” said Clemshire. “Now, it is time for the legal system to hold him accountable. My family and I are deeply grateful to the authorities who have worked tirelessly to make this day possible and remain hopeful that justice will ultimately prevail.”\n\n Morris, who served on Trump's evangelical advisory board during his 2016 campaign for President, could surrender to authorities soon and be arraigned as early as Monday, March 17, Drummond told The Dallas Morning News. Morris is facing up to 20 years in prison for each felony count.\n\n News of Morris' alleged misconduct surfaced last June, when he resigned from Gateway Church and issued a statement admitting he had “inappropriate sexual behavior\" with a \"young lady” in the 1980s, per WFAA.\n\n He did not mention the name or age of the \"young lady,\" but said the conduct began in his \"early twenties\" and occurred \"in a home where I was staying.\"\n\n “It was kissing and petting and not intercourse, but it was wrong. This behavior happened on several occasions over the next few years,” Morris said.\n\n He added that \"this situation was brought to light\" in March 1987 and \"it was confessed and repented of.\" He stepped down from ministry and underwent counseling at the request of the Elders of Shady Grove Church and the \"young lady's father,\" Morris said in his June 2024 statement.\n\n He and his wife sat down with the young lady and her family in 1989, Morris said, per CNN. “I asked their forgiveness, and they graciously forgave me,” he added.\n\n Clemishire told WFAA that her family forgave Morris, but they did not support him returning to the ministry.\n\n Want to keep up with the latest crime coverage? Sign up for PEOPLE's free True Crime newsletter for breaking crime news, ongoing trial coverage and details of intriguing unsolved cases. \n\n Gateway Church also said in June that Morris went through a \"two-year restoration process\" following the alleged misconduct.\n\n In November, Gateway Church removed four elders from leadership.\n\n Morris founded Gateway Church in the Dallas area of Texas in 2000, according to the church’s website. The church now has several locations across Dallas-Fort Worth.\n\n If you or someone you know has been a victim of sexual abuse, text \"STRENGTH\" to the Crisis Text Line at 741-741 to be connected to a certified crisis counselor.\n\n If you suspect child abuse, call the Childhelp National Child Abuse Hotline at 1-800-4-A-Child or 1-800-422-4453, or go to www.childhelp.org.

The lawsuit claims that this action represents an “effective dismantling” of the department.\n\nThe Department of Education made an announcement on March 11, revealing a reduction in force (RIF) of “nearly 50%.” Following this announcement, Secretary of Education Linda McMahon stated to The Hill on the same day that the layoffs were just the initial phase in the process aimed at eventually shutting down the entire department.\n\nThe plaintiffs, in their 53-page lawsuit, say the agency’s plans are “equivalent to incapacitating key, statutorily-mandated functions” that cause “immense damage” to the educational systems of several states. The complaint alleges the would-be federal firing spree is illegal — in violation of both the U.S. Constitution and federal law.\n\nMoreover, the filing argues, the ongoing and upcoming reductions in staffing amount to an unlawful end-run around congressional authority in order to advance President Donald Trump’s stated goal of shuttering the department in de facto if not de jure terms.\n\n“But the Trump Administration cannot dismantle the Department of Education,” the lawsuit reads. “It cannot override — whether through large-scale RIFs or otherwise — the statutory framework prescribing the Department’s responsibilities. As the Supreme Court put it nearly a century ago, ‘[t]o Congress under its legislative power is given the establishment of offices [and] the determination of their functions and jurisdiction.’ And, thus, administrative agencies ‘are creatures of statute.””\n\nIn other words, and in a recurring theme prevalent in litigation against the current government, statutory authority holds sway over presidential directives and agency interpretations of such directives, according to the plaintiffs.\n\nLed by New York Attorney General Letitia James, a Democrat, and joined by 20 other attorneys general, the lawsuit aims to enjoin McMahon from going through with the firings slated to occur on March 21. The litigation also seeks a declaratory judgment that plans to dismantle the agency are unlawful and an injunction barring both Trump and McMahon from effectuating the directive.\n\n“Because neither the President nor his agencies can undo the many acts of Congress that authorize the Department, dictate its responsibilities, and appropriate funds for it to administer, the President’s directive to eliminate the Department of Education — including through the March 11 decimation of the Department’s workforce and any other agency implementation — is an unlawful violation of the separation of powers, and the Executive’s obligation to take care that the law be faithfully executed,” the lawsuit goes on.\n\nThe core issue is basic constitutional governance, the lawsuit alleges.\n\n“It is a bedrock constitutional principle that the President and his agencies cannot make law,” the filing continues. “Rather, they can only — and indeed, they must — implement the laws enacted by Congress, including those statutes that create federal agencies and dictate their duties. The Executive thus can neither outright abolish an agency nor incapacitate it by cutting away the personnel required to implement the agency’s statutorily-mandated duties.”\n\nTo hear the plaintiffs tell it, the administration has not only telegraphed its intent to dismantle the agency in violation of federal law but has been “effectively nullifying” multiple mandates — also contained in federal law — through “severe and extreme” staff reductions.\n\nNotably, nearly 600 DOE employees have already parted ways with the agency by accepting earlier-issued buyout offers.\n\n“On information and belief, the RIF devastated important segments of the Department of Education, rendering the agency unable to perform its core functions,” the lawsuit claims.\n\nSeveral offices within the DOE have been “gutted” to the point of either nonexistence or “effective elimination” since staff reduction was started earlier this year, the plaintiffs allege.\n\nStudent loan-focused employees have been particularly hard hit by the administration’s plans, the lawsuit alleges.\n\n“On information and belief, the RIF has also seriously impacted the Department of Education’s [Office of Federal Student Aid],” the filing goes on. “FSA directs, coordinates, and recommends policies for programs that are designed to provide financial assistance to eligible students enrolled in postsecondary educational institutions. This assistance includes grants, loans, and work-study assistance to nearly 12.9 million students through approximately 6,100 postsecondary institutions.”\n\nThe plaintiffs elaborate on this office, at length:\n\nIncluded in this system is the administration of Pell Grants, work-study programs and subsidized loans. The Department awards more than $120 billion a year in grants, work-study funds, and low-interest loans to approximately 13 million students. Much of this funding is sent directly to colleges and universities, including public colleges and universities in the Plaintiff States. If Program Participation Renewals are not processed in a timely manner, it could impact the ability of institutions to operate and most of their student to attend the institution by functionally eliminating the availability of financial aid.\n\nThe lawsuit also argues the directive violates the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) because the extant and proposed staffing cuts “failed to consider” the vast array of problems that would result from such an extensive workforce depletion. The APA governs all administrative agencies and often works to halt actions deemed “arbitrary and capricious” by a reviewing court.\n\n“The Department’s RIF is arbitrary and capricious because the Department’s stated reasons for the RIF — to promote ‘efficiency’ and ‘accountability’ — are pretext for the President and Secretary McMahon’s stated goal of dismantling the Department from within,” the filing argues. “The Department’s RIF is arbitrary and capricious because the Agency Defendants’ actions impede their ability to perform the Department’s functions, both those that are required by statute and those that are not.”","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nPresident Donald Trump spoke as Robert F.

They’re not living together. She comes over maybe a few nights a week. They just love hanging out, having dinner and schmoozing together. \n\n\"They’re sticking close to home, have decided not to make it a thing and go out in public. Not just yet anyway.\"The PGA legend and Vanessa's lives have a lot of overlap in addition to Woods' connection to her former father-in-law. \n\nThey are said to live about 20 minutes apart from each other in Palm Beach, Florida. \n\nVanessa's 17-year-old daughter Kai, whom she shares with Donald Jr., and Woods' children – son Charlie, 16, and daughter Sam, 17 – are all students at The Benjamin School.Both Charlie and Kai are also promising young golfers, with the latter recently announcing her commitment to play collegiate golf at The University of Miami – and has been seen sporting clothing from Woods' Sun Day Red athletic line.\n\nVanessa's daughter has spent time with Woods thanks to her grandfather for several years. \n\nIn 2021, she posted a photo with Trump and Woods, who she wished a \"speedy recovery\" after he was severely injured in a single-car accident in California.In February, Vanessa took Kai to attend the TGL, which is a golf league formed by Woods and fellow PGA star Rory McIlroy. Kai even shared a video of Woods teeing off on her Instagram from the event. \n\nThe same month, Woods met up with Trump for a round of golf. \n\nVanessa filed for divorce from Don Jr. in 2018.

She additionally filed an appeal to nullify an NDA she signed when she started dating the 15-time major winner. \n\nA year later in 2023, Herman dropped her lawsuits and denied allegations Woods had sexually assaulted her.","summary":"PGA legend Tiger Woods and Donald Trump Jr.'s ex-wife were spotted at the Genesis Invitational together in February.","url":"https://radaronline.com/p/tiger-woods-vanessa-trump-dating-rumors-donald-jr/","image":"https://media.radaronline.com/brand-img/cp8dRIkHL/0x0/tiger-woods-and-vanessa-trump-spark-dating-rumors-1741905002268.png","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-03-13 23:45:00","author":"Haley Gunn","authors":["Haley Gunn"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.192},{"id":299967122,"title":"What is the Trump administration doing to limit birthright citizenship?","text":"The Trump administration is pushing for the the U.S. Supreme Court to allow some restrictions on birthright citizenship even as legal battles continue over President Donald Trump’s orders to end what has long been seen as a constitutional promise.\n\nOn Thursday, the administration filed emergency applications with the high court that would allow citizenship to be denied to people born in the U.S. after Feb. 19 if their parents are in the country illegally.\n\nDistrict judges in Maryland, Massachusetts and Washington have blocked the order, which Trump signed shortly after taking office in January. It is currently blocked nationwide.\n\nBirthright citizenship automatically makes anyone born in the United States an American citizen, including children born to mothers in the country illegally. The right was enshrined soon after the Civil War in the Constitution’s 14th Amendment.\n\nTrump and his supporters have argued that there should be tougher standards for becoming an American citizen, which he called “a priceless and profound gift” in his executive order.\n\nLegal scholars, though, have said its the 14th Amendment’s constitutional protections would make it it extremely difficult to overturn.\n\nHere is a look at birthright citizenship, what Trump has said about it and the prospects for ending it:\n\nWhat Trump has said about birthright citizenship\n\nTrump has said for years that he wants to end birthright citizenship.\n\n“It’s ridiculous. We are the only country in the world that does this with the birthright, as you know, and it’s just absolutely ridiculous,” he said in January. Dozens of countries, mostly in the Americas, have birthright citizenship.\n\nOpponents say the practice encourages people to come to the U.S. illegally so their children can have citizenship. Others argue that ending birthright citizenship would profoundly damage the country.\n\nIts elimination “could eventually place every single person in America in the precarious position of having to prove American citizenship,” Alex Nowrasteh, vice president for economic and social policy studies at the pro-immigration Cato Institute, wrote after Trump’s order.\n\nIn 2019, the Migration Policy Institute estimated that 5.5 million children under age 18 lived with at least one parent in the country illegally in 2019, representing 7% of the U.S. child population. The vast majority of those children were U.S. citizens.\n\nWhat does the law say?\n\nCongress ratified the 14th Amendment in July 1868, soon after the Civil War.\n\n“All persons born or naturalized in the United States and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States,” the amendment says.\n\nBut it didn’t always apply to everyone. It wasn’t until 1924, for example, that Congress granted citizenship to all Native Americans born in the U.S.\n\nSupporters of immigration restrictions, including Trump, have argued the words “subject to the jurisdiction thereof” allow the U.S. to deny citizenship to babies born to women in the country illegally.\n\nWhat is the basis of this legal appeal?\n\nThe emergency appeal does not focus directly on whether the presidential order is legally valid.

That something was the Tax Equity and Fiscal Responsibility Act of 1982, which closed income-tax loopholes and increased excise taxes on cigarettes and phone service. It also provided billions of dollars in new funding for “improved enforcement” by the Internal Revenue Service.\n\n“As chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, my obligation is to make certain that everybody pays the tax they owe before we go back and ask people to pay more tax,” Dole explained at the time. Give the IRS enough resources, his reasoning went, and you could collect more taxes without increasing the burden on law-abiding taxpayers. This philosophy was to hold sway for the rest of the Reagan years, with the number of IRS employees increasing 39% from 1982 to 1988.\n\nThe slide in IRS staffing that followed in the 1990s was partly the result of technological progress — you don’t need as many people to process electronic returns as paper ones — but continued employment declines after that began to cut sharply into the agency’s enforcement capabilities. The share of high-income tax returns that were audited collapsed in the 2010s, and while the rising numbers of taxpayers with incomes above $1 million drove some of the percentage decline, the number of audits of such taxpayers also fell 77% from 2010 to 2021.\n\nWith the U.S. facing even bigger deficits as a share of gross domestic product than those of the early 1980s, Dole’s theory of IRS enforcement made a comeback during Joe Biden’s presidency. The Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 included $80 billion in new IRS funding through 2031 to ramp up enforcement and improve customer service, and the end-of-fiscal year IRS employee total of 100,433 last September was the highest since 1996.\n\nThis has now all been thrown into reverse. The House GOP majority already forced a rollback of that additional IRS funding from $80 billion to $60 billion last year, and that was just the beginning. Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency forced out 6,700 probationary IRS employees, and House and Senate budget negotiators will surely be looking for more cuts.\n\nEmpowering the IRS was not universally popular with Republicans, even in the early 1980s, with rising star Newt Gingrich calling Dole “the tax collector for the welfare state.” Now it is anathema. The triumph of the Gingrich wing of the party in the 1990s led even Dole to call for IRS cutbacks when he ran for president in 1996, and a 2010s scandal in which the agency singled out conservative Tea Party groups for heightened tax scrutiny supercharged Republican resentment. “Should I audit the IRS into oblivion?” was the subject line of a fundraising email sent out under President Donald Trump’s name a couple of weeks ago.\n\nThe problem for Republicans is that they also have that big deficit to contend with. Reversing the Biden administration’s IRS upgrade — not to mention firing 6,700 people in the middle of tax season — will reduce the revenue collected by the agency by more than the decrease in payroll costs and enlarge the deficit.\n\nHow much bigger? Estimates of the payoff from the Inflation Reduction Act’s IRS spending increase range from $561 billion in cumulative additional revenue through 2031 (and $861 billion if the spending increase were extended to 2034) to roughly breakeven. The first of those comes from a February 2024 analysis by the Biden Treasury Department and IRS that makes some big assumptions about how service improvements and technological upgrades will increase revenue, so you’re welcome to give that a big haircut if you want. The second, which concluded that each additional $1.04 in enforcement spending so far has brought in only $1 in additional revenue, comes from a November 2024 brief by the Economic Policy Innovation Center, a conservative think tank, that counts only the money generated by two IRS enforcement campaigns — one targeting high earners who hadn’t filed taxes since 2017, and another focused on the collection of recognized tax debts — and ignores all other possible revenue benefits. It is clearly a lowball estimate, and I feel confident in saying the actual payoff is somewhere in between.\n\nThat’s what the Congressional Budget Office thinks, too. Before Congress rolled back the IRS funding increase by $20 billion last year, the CBO estimated that this would decrease tax revenue by $44 billion over 10 years and thus increase the cumulative deficit by $24 billion. In the CBO’s calculations, incremental IRS spending brings diminishing returns — you get more bang for the first $20 billion than the last $20 billion — so any further cutbacks would have a proportionately larger effect.\n\nWith a deficit projected by the CBO to hit $1.9 trillion in the current fiscal year, these aren’t make or break numbers. But turning down this free money by imposing cutbacks on the IRS is a yet another sign that, as political scientist and former Bloomberg Opinion columnist Jonathan Bernstein has argued again and again and again, modern Republicans, unlike Dole back in the day, aren’t actually interested in reducing the deficit.\n\nJustin Fox is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering business, economics and other topics involving charts.

'Coup' Case On March 25","text":"Brazil's Supreme Court on Thursday said it would consider on March 25 whether to try far-right former president Jair Bolsonaro on charges of masterminding an attempted coup.Bolsonaro, 69, has been the target of multiple investigations since his turbulent years as president of Latin America's biggest democracy from 2019 to 2023.Last month, he was charged with a failed plot to prevent his left-wing successor Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva from taking office after his victory in October 2022 elections.Bolsonaro is accused of heading a criminal organization which had also hatched a plan to assassinate Lula, his vice president, and a top Supreme Court judge.The five charges against the accused include the crimes of \"coup d'etat,\" the \"attempt to violently abolish the democratic rule of law\" and \"armed criminal organization,\" among others.If found guilty, Bolsonaro could face up to 40 years in prison.Prosecutors say that Bolsonaro greenlit a plot to assassinate Lula in December 2022 that went nowhere because the army chief refused to get on board.The following month, a week after Lula's inauguration, Bolsonaro's supporters attacked the presidential palace, Congress and Supreme Court in Brasilia.The rioting was reminiscent of the attack by President Donald Trump's supporters on the US Capitol two years earlier.Both Trump and Lula claimed they had been cheated out of another term in office.The Supreme Court on March 25 will examine whether there is sufficient evidence against Bolsonaro to launch criminal proceedings against him.The court may make its decision known on the same day or defer it to a later date, a court source told AFP.Bolsonaro, a former army captain who was dubbed the \"Trump of the Tropics\" when he first won office, says the case is a ploy by an \"authoritarian regime\" to silence opponents and prevent him making a Trump-style comeback.His lawyers argue that the Supreme Court is not competent to try the former president and that it has not been given full access to the evidence against him.In a 24-page document sent to AFP on Thursday, the prosecutor's office rejected each of the arguments.Bolsonaro has already been barred from holding elected office until 2030 for spreading misinformation about Brazil's voting system.He is lobbying Congress to revise the ban so he can run for president again when Lula's third term ends next year.Bolsonaro has called for a demonstration on Sunday on Rio de Janeiro's Copacabana beach to demand that Brazil follow Trump's example by pardoning the Brasilia rioters.","summary":"Brazil's Supreme Court on Thursday said it would consider on March 25 whether to try far-right former president Jair Bolsonaro on charges of masterminding an

No, he is not. The fact that the biggest Democratic Party story coming out of President Donald Trump’s address to Congress last week was the now-censured behavior of Texas Rep.

The City Council has not dealt with it in any way. In fact, it has done the opposite by passing a ceasefire resolution that did not condemn Hamas’ invasion of Israel and the atrocities and murder perpetrated on Israeli citizens. These are war crimes.\n\nThe Oakland City Council is supposed to represent all the citizens of Oakland. It has thus far failed to address this problem. The city must come out with strong words to oppose hatred of Jews and educate the public as to what antisemitism is in all its forms. Allowing vandalism, exclusion, violence in and out of our schools, and propaganda in our schools that supports hatred of Jewish people needs to be pointed out as undemocratic and destructive to a pluralistic democracy and for all minorities.\n\nDorothea Dorezn\n\nCSU’s AI initiative takes\nfrom the students\n\nRe: “Beleaguered Cal State University’s AI partnerships defended, attacked” (Page A1, Feb. 10).\n\nI was shocked to read the article about CSU’s $16.9 million AI initiative while students struggle with overcrowded classes, limited mental health services and budget cuts.

Operating on less than 1% of the federal budget, USAID has helped reduce extreme poverty, eradicate smallpox, curb HIV/AIDS, and decrease malaria and tuberculosis. It has also provided access to safe drinking water and empowered millions of girls through education.\n\nDomestically, USAID supports U.S. farmers and small enterprises while promoting economic stability globally and countering influence from countries like China and Russia. It also tackles the root causes of illegal immigration by creating jobs and offering training in high-migration areas.\n\nThe shutdown of USAID has caused the loss of American jobs and severed critical aid to vulnerable regions, undermining national security and America’s global credibility. Congress must act quickly to restore USAID and reaffirm the nation’s commitment to humanitarian aid and global leadership.\n\nAnastasia Bertolet\n\nDefeat SAVE Act for\ndemocracy’s sake\n\nMy mother integrated Woolworth’s as a teen employee.

Twenty-one million Americans do not have accessible birth certificates nor passports, especially college students. Sixty-nine million women don’t have birth certificates with their current legal names. Seniors might not have access to a passport or birth certificate. Veterans with military ID will be disenfranchised. Congress must reject the SAVE Act and pass the Freedom to Vote Act, the John R. Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act, and the Native American Voting Rights Act.

LeAnn, now 42, would have been roughly seven years younger than Tiger, now 49, at the time.\n\nRimes is now married to Eddie Cibrian after the pair's controversial affair that led to them both leaving their respective marriages and tying the knot themselves in 2011.\n\nElin Nordegren\n\nWoods first met Swedish model Nordegren in 2001, before proposing two years later. The couple then made it official at a lavish wedding the following year.\n\nThey welcomed daughter Sam in 2007 and son Charlie in 2009, a year prior to the infamous sex scandal that brought their marriage crashing down in shocking fashion. \n\nElin divorced Tiger in 2010 after six years of marriage when she discovered the golfing great was cheating on her during Thanksgiving week with a woman named Rachel Uchitel.\n\nWoods enjoyed a brief romance with Can't Fight the Moonlight popstar LeAnn Rimes (pictured)\n\nBut he later met and married Swedish model Elin Nordegren (pictured together in 2004)\n\nNordegren infamously divorced Woods after his numerous infidelities were revealed in 2010\n\nRachel Uchitel (pictured) was revealed as one of the women Tiger cheated on her with\n\nTwo days later, a car crash outside his own Florida mansion would unearth the truth.\n\nIn the aftermath of the crash, Woods was found by police asleep in the road without shoes and socks on after Nordegren tried to smash her way into the car with a golf club.\n\nElin's worst fears were then confirmed after she spotted a text on Woods' phone while he lay unconscious, dosed up on sleeping pills. What followed was one of the most dramatic collapses of a star's reputation across sport as a number of other women later came forward to claim they'd been intimate with him.\n\nAmong the other women that came forward was porn star Holly Sampson, who confirmed she had been 'intimate' with the Nike athlete after previously claiming she 'f****d Tiger Woods'.\n\nNot only did the scandal cost Tiger his marriage, but he also lost numerous lucrative sponsorship deals - even though Nike stood by him - and he went to rehab for sex addiction during a break from playing golf.\n\nLindsey Vonn\n\nFour years later, Woods finally bounced back from that ordeal with American alpine ski racer Vonn, with the pair's previous friendship slowly turning into something more.\n\nThey were seen out together on several occasions over the course of their unlikely romance, before parting company after three years together in 2015.\n\nLindsey told Entertainment Tonight after Tiger's car crash in 2022: 'We are friends and, of course, I'm happy that he is back and healthy.\n\n'And, you know, it was a tough time for him. So I am just happy that he is back with his kids.'\n\nWoods finally bounced back from that ordeal with American alpine ski racer Vonn in 2013\n\nKristin Smith \n\nWoods and Smith reportedly began dating in November 2016.\n\nIn April 2017 Radar Online reported that Kristin was stopped at Palm Beach Airport with $210,634 (£150,000) on her person — a gift from Woods, she claimed.\n\nSmith and Woods were also reportedly still dating when he was arrested in May 2017. \n\nShe was reportedly shopping in a store in Dallas, Texas when she learned that he'd been arrested after cops found him asleep at the wheel of his car in Jupiter, Florida, at about 3am ET. She's said to have been in hysterics over the news.\n\nKristin Smith and Woods were reportedly still dating when he was arrested in May 2017\n\nIt was reported that Woods had an affair with Erica Herman during his relationship with Smith\n\nTheir relationship ended some time before August 2017. It was reported that Woods had an affair with Erica Herman during his relationship with Smith.\n\nRadar Online reported that Smith 'suspected' Woods was cheating, but Woods denied it.\n\n'Kristin suspected it, but he would always deny it by belittling Erica,' a source told the outlet. 'Kristin eventually caught them together. It was a big mess.'\n\nBefore dating Woods, Smith was married to former Dallas Cowboys player Gerald Sensabaugh. He is the father of Smith's son, Isiah.\n\nErica Herman\n\nHerman, who worked as the general manager at Woods' Jupiter restaurant, started dating the golf legend in 2017. \n\nHowever, originally, the pair did not make the relationship official until a short time after.\n\nDuring the Presidents Cup in New Jersey back in September 2017, Herman was seen wearing a 'player spouse' badge, usually given to wives and girlfriends.\n\nSoon after, Woods and Herman went public about their relationship.\n\nShe went on to support Woods in person at numerous golf tournaments, including his incredible Masters win in 2019.\n\nWoods was previously in a relationship with Erica Herman - with the pair splitting up in 2022\n\nErica Herman's relationship with the five-time Masters champion became official back in 2017\n\nHerman went on to support Woods at numerous golf tournaments during their relationship\n\nAfter six years together, the pair ended their relationship in October 2022. \n\nHerman filed a lawsuit against Woods, alleging the golfer said she could live at his Florida mansion until 2026 only for him to kick her out unexpectedly in 2022.\n\nShe dropped her lawsuits against the trust that owns the house in November 2023, also denying allegations made by her attorney that Woods sexually harassed her.\n\nBefore meeting Woods, Herman is said to have had a sordid past. Radar Online reported that she was known as both a 'hard partier' and a 'gold digger'.\n\nThe outlet's source also alleged that Erica has had her sights set on dating Woods for about a decade.\n\n'Erica's been chasing Tiger around like a puppy for close to 10 years. I'm not sure if his wife knew, but I'm not sure how she couldn't know. I can't believe Tiger's out in public with her now,' the source said.\n\nFloridaTiger WoodsLindsey Vonn\n\nShare or comment on this article:\nInside Tiger Woods' complete relationship history: From LeAnn Rimes to Lindsey Vonn and now Vanessa Trump\n\nAdd comment","summary":"The golf legend, who has not been in a high-profile relationship for the last two years, is said to have struck up an unlikely romance with Vanessa Trump amid doubts over his future in the sport.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/golf/article-14496591/tiger-woods-relationship-history-girlfriends-wives-vanessa-trump.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/03/13/20/96172459-0-image-m-14_1741898069747.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-03-13 23:29:12","author":"Editor,Oliver Salt","authors":["Editor","Oliver Salt"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":0.442},{"id":299962736,"title":"Some Trudeau cabinet ministers out as Carney prepares to reveal a shorter bench (Canada)","text":"Mark Carney will be sworn in officially as prime minister and reveal the makeup of his first cabinet Friday morning — a team one government source said will not include Jean-Yves Duclos.\n\nThe source, who was not authorized to speak publicly, told The Canadian Press that Duclos was informed Thursday that he will no longer be minister of public services and procurement or the Liberal party's Quebec lieutenant.\n\nDuclos, who has been a member of cabinet since 2015, is already nominated to run in the next federal election.\n\nIn a statement issued Thursday evening, Duclos didn't confirm that he won't be in cabinet but said he would now be able to devote \"even more energy and time\" to his work as an MP.\n\nDuclos said he looks forward to working with Carney and that the incoming prime minister has his \"full confidence and gratitude.\"\n\nIn a social media post Thursday evening, Carney said he was \"building a government that will deliver what our country needs most.\"\n\nDuclos is likely not the only minister from Justin Trudeau's cabinet who will not be invited to Friday's 11 a.m. swearing-in ceremony at Rideau Hall.\n\n\"I think the signals have been coming forward that it will be a smaller cabinet,\" said Susan Smith, a Liberal commentator and the co-founder of Bluesky Strategy Group.\n\nTrudeau's last cabinet had 37 members, including Trudeau himself.\n\nMichael Wernick, the former clerk of the privy council, said in a recent interview that he expects several ministers will be \"double-hatting,\" or carrying more than one portfolio, for the time being.\n\nSome portfolios could be combined to reflect their departments.\n\nThe Heritage Department, for example, is home to five ministers responsible for heritage, sport, official languages, women and gender equality, and diversity, inclusion and persons with disabilities. Employment and Social Development Canada has six ministers.\n\nSmith said the decisions Carney makes public on Friday will send a signal about where he wants to take the country.\n\n\"I think in this case it will be possible to signal both stability and a change in economic direction,\" she said.\n\nThe ministers now playing key roles in Canada's response to U.S. President Donald Trump's trade war are expected to be part of Carney's cabinet, and Smith said it would make sense to keep them in their current roles.\n\nThose key ministers include Foreign Affairs Minister Mélanie Joly, Industry Minister François-Philippe Champagne, Finance Minister Dominic LeBlanc and Public Safety Minister David McGuinty.\n\nCarney also needs to decide whether to give ministerial roles to his leadership rivals, former ministers Chrystia Freeland and Karina Gould.\n\nDuring the leadership race, Freeland said she would offer Carney the position of finance minister in her government if she won. Carney hasn't made any such promises publicly.\n\n\"Both women acquitted themselves as ministers very effectively. Karina Gould is extremely well-liked, was very good as a House leader,\" Smith said.\n\nGould was invited to join Carney at an event with steelworkers in Hamilton on Wednesday, leading to speculation that she will have a cabinet seat.\n\nA report from Radio-Canada on Thursday said Environment Minister Steven Guilbeault would be removed from his portfolio. He refused to confirm that report for reporters at a news conference in Montreal on Thursday.\n\n\"It remains the prime minister’s prerogative to decide who will or will not serve in his cabinet,\" Guilbeault said.\n\nGuilbeault cited his track record, saying he thinks the government made historic progress on nature conservation and the fight against plastic pollution.\n\n\"I think we’ve truly changed the conversation in Canada on these issues in recent years,\" he said.\n\nGuilbeault and the Trudeau government's environment policies were deeply unpopular in parts of Western Canada. Smith said moving him out of the environment portfolio would send \"a huge message to the country, in particular to the energy sector — both the renewable energy and the traditional energy sector — that Mr. Carney's going to take a different approach, I think a more proactive and a more business approach.\"\n\nEight ministers from Trudeau's cabinet have said they won't run in the next election, and are unlikely to be on Carney's team.\n\nThey include Health Minister Mark Holland — who announced his plans not to run again late Thursday — Justice Minister Arif Virani, Women and Gender Equality and Youth Minister Marci Ien, Rural Economic Development Minister Gudie Hutchings, Trade Minister Mary Ng, Emergency Preparedness Minister Harjit Sajjan, Heritage Minister Pascale St-Onge and Agriculture Minister Lawrence MacAulay.\n\nAgriculture has gained prominence lately as Trump takes aim at Canada's supply management system in the trade war.\n\nSmith said MacAulay's departure creates an opening to add a minister from Alberta — something that also would send a signal that Carney's approach will be different.\n\nThis cabinet is almost certainly an interim cabinet that will be replaced after the spring election. Carney said during the leadership race that he will likely call an election before March 24, the date Parliament is set to resume.\n\nWhen the election campaign begins, the federal government will go into what's known as caretaker mode. Cabinet ministers and the prime minister will retain their posts throughout the campaign.\n\nIf the Liberals win the election, Carney will be sworn in again. If they lose, he will resign and the winner will be invited to form a government.\n\nThe convention ensures the core functions of government keep operating during an election campaign.\n\nCabinet can make decisions about responding to the U.S. tariffs during the campaign, for example. It can also spend money under existing laws.\n\nThe guidelines published by the Privy Council Office before the 2021 election state that a government in caretaker mode should, to the extent possible, restrict itself to matters that are \"routine, or non-controversial, or urgent and in the public interest, or reversible by a new government without undue cost or disruption, or agreed to by opposition parties.\"\n\nThe caretaker convention means that \"it is incumbent upon a government to act with restraint during an election period.\"\n\nCabinet ministers must also take care to distinguish between their government work and partisan activities on the campaign trail, the PCO guidance says.","summary":"Mark Carney will be sworn in officially as prime minister and reveal the makeup of his first cabinet Friday morning &mdash; a team one government source said will not include Jean-Yves Duclos.\n\nThe source, who was not authorized to speak publicly, told The Canadian Press that Duclos was informed T...","url":"https://www.castanet.net/news/Canada/538477/Some-Trudeau-cabinet-ministers-out-as-Carney-prepares-to-reveal-a-shorter-bench","image":"https://www.castanet.net/content/2025/3/56d4e213b01082a2cdbbbe95d166171c2ee272b12522629fb78d01d3e45469f2_p4163024.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-03-13 23:28:00","author":"Sarah Ritchie","authors":["Sarah Ritchie"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"ca","sentiment":0.142},{"id":299966706,"title":"Portland protest in support of Mahmoud Khalil planned for Thursday evening","text":"Columbia University activist Mahmoud Khalil and seven of his fellow students sued the school and Congress on Thursday for handing over thousands of disciplinary records to the federal government as President Donald Trump threatens to crack down on student protesters.\n\nKhalil, 30, a green card holder, was arrested Saturday night by federal immigration agents as he returned home to his Columbia-owned apartment with his wife, a U.S. citizen who is eight months pregnant.

DOGE’s seemingly draconian steps to lay off federal workers in large numbers are the inevitable result of federal workers’ union collective-bargaining agreements and civil-service protections that have made it almost impossible to fire any individual federal employee based on job performance. These agreements and protections have made a federal job a lifetime position immune from performance assessments and other measures of employee accountability present in the private sector. Unless Congress steps in to reform federal public-employee union agreements and the civil service system, President Donald Trump’s only choice to downsize the government is to proceed with large-scale reductions in force. Both men understand that deep cuts in the federal payroll are the only feasible way to win back control of the government so it can serve the president’s agenda that he ran on in 2024. Trusting that new agency heads can fix the workforce of one of the alphabet soup agencies is wishful thinking. THE FULL TRUTH ABOUT THE GREAT THINGS DOGE CAN AND CANNOT DO When I was a director at the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in 2010-2015, I saw firsthand how employees are nearly completely immune from performance evaluation or firing. And at that time, SEC employees could be evaluated on a performance scale of 1 to 5. The current publicly available 2023 union collective-bargaining agreement for the SEC states that employees will be evaluated on performance as \"acceptable\" or \"unacceptable,\" essentially pass/fail—and in many schools these days, everyone passes. During my tenure USA Today – not exactly conservative friendly – reported that federal workers are more likely to die on the job than be fired. Moreover, when I was with the SEC, in one of the rare instances when managers succeeded in firing an employee, the little-known Office of Special Counsel ordered reinstatement. President Trump has highlighted the importance of this obscure office by firing the Biden appointee that heads it. The president’s action is a necessary step to re-establish control over the federal bureaucracy. The D.C. Circuit Court lifted an injunction against the firing Thursday and the office head resigned. Leaving a Biden-era official in that job would have frustrated the administration’s attempt to shrink the bloated bureaucracy. LET DOGE SINK ITS TEETH INTO OUR BLOATED TECH INFRASTRUCTURE The Trump administration’s decision to fire all federal employees in their probationary period is also a direct result of the iron-clad job protection created by collective bargaining agreements and civil-service protections like the Office of Special Counsel. Federal employees in their first year generally do not enjoy the union and civil-service protections granted after one year on the job. Who pays the price for federal working conditions free of accountability? U.S. taxpayers. When I joined the SEC staff in 2010 and tried to reform the examination program that had missed Bernie Madoff’s fraud and massive Ponzi scheme despite numerous examinations, I received a plain manila envelope in my inbox with a copy of false accusations against my predecessor that had been shared with Congress and the press as a warning of what could happen to me if I pushed for change in the exam program. GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE What I soon learned was that although many federal workers join the government out of patriotism and a desire to serve, the unnatural working conditions steadily grind such employees down and they start to go along with the system where longer-tenured workers often discourage extra effort. Indeed, lifetime employment for employees in the federal government is contrary to the U.S. Constitution and is not available to workers in the private sector. In fact, the only lifetime position created by the Constitution is federal judges. In addition, the Constitution prohibits the creation of titles of nobility that created a lifetime aristocracy in the United Kingdom. No one in the private sector who is working and paying taxes has a lifetime position. Federal workers should be in the same situation as the taxpayers they serve. CLICK HERE TO READ MORE ON FOX BUSINESS As President Barack Obama was fond of saying, \"Elections have consequences.\" The November 2024 election showed that Americans are tired of unaccountable federal employees who fail to address their fundamental concerns, including inflation and massive spending on wasteful programs at home and abroad. With a federal budget that comprises almost 25% of the nation’s GDP, Congress needs to reform the rules governing federal employees to help rein in profligate government spending and waste. All Americans would be more comfortable with a federal workforce that plays by the same employment rules as the rest of working Americans.

America finds itself in dire straits in maritime power as the manufacturing base continues to shrink while China continues to outpace the U.S., with experts telling the Daily Caller News Foundation that Beijing’s dominance poses serious national security risks.\n\n“The U.S. is ranked 14th in the world. We are basically just barely above Iran, which I don’t think is some major shipbuilding power,” Colin Gabrow, policy analyst at the CATO Institute, told the DCNF. “Look at data from the last five years, the U.S. is behind Norway and the Netherlands, tiny countries. We’re well behind.” (RELATED: ‘Smartest Guy In The Room’: Meet The Man Trump Just Tapped To Head America’s Highest Military Office)\n\nCurrently, the office is only in its planning stages, with the executive order to officially create it still in the drafting stage, according to U.S. Naval Institute News (USNI). The National Security Council would lead the office.\n\nThe U.S. Trade Representative and the secretaries of Defense, Commerce, State, Transportation and Homeland Security would have six months after the order is signed to draft a plan to revive American shipbuilding, according to USNI. The order also calls for an investigation into China’s “unfair targeting of maritime logistics, and shipbuilding sectors.”\n\nChina’s market share for industries such as high-technology ships, maritime engineering equipment and “green” ship building have all ballooned since 2011, prompting Beijing to set even more ambitious goals. As a result, China’s shipbuilding market share has increased from approximately 5% in 2000 to over 50% today.\n\n“They have the world’s largest shipbuilding industry, and many of our allies rely on Chinese shipyards for fixing their commercial ships and building their commercial ships,” Brent Sadler, senior research fellow at the Heritage Foundation, told the DCNF. “So the Chinese, in many ways, control the terms of trade.”\n\nChina also holds a significant advantage in military shipbuilding, surpassing the U.S. Navy’s total ship count in 2020 with 360 ships compared to just 296 in the U.S. fleets, according to a January Congressional Research Service (CRS) report. Naval ship building in the U.S. has been plagued by massive delays, with some contractors extending their deadlines for ship delivery by up to three years.\n\nThe national security implications of commercial shipbuilding are also worth considering, albeit less than obvious, are also worth considering, Gabrow said.\n\n“This is perceived as a national security vulnerability,” Gabrow told the DCNF. “You want to have a vigorous, vibrant shipment industry, which has some military utility to repair and build ships in times of war. This needs to be turned around I think is the mentality, hence the talk of the establishment of the Office of Shipbuilding.”\n\nThe wider U.S industrial base has declined alongside maritime output, with manufacturing jobs declining from an all-time high of 19.6 million in 1979 to just 12.8 million jobs in 2019, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics.\n\n“In my view, nothing is more important than addressing the critical labor shortages that afflict all of the shipbuilding and public maintenance yards,” Dr. Eric Labs, senior analyst for naval forces and weapons at the Congressional Budget Office, told the House Armed Services Committee Tuesday. “For years, recruitment at the yards has been hard. Retention is even harder.”\n\nShipbuilding jobs have been virtually wiped out in the U.S., declining nearly 80% since the 1950s, with the number of shipyards rigged for large ships also declining at roughly the same rate, a McKinsey report concluded.\n\n“It’s more than just ship building,” Sadler told the DCNF. “I think it’s maritime industrial base, which is ship building, shipping, port infrastructure, and naval ship building and repair. But what’s missing is, and I think this is what the president was getting at in his speech, is there’s probably the need for something like a ‘maritime czar,’ someone who can coordinate from the economic side, the National Economic Council, but also the national security aspects of this through the National Security Council.”\n\nOne first step the office should implement is an update to National Security Directive 28 promulgated in 1989, which was intended at the time to combat the rising threat of the Soviet Union in maritime power, Sadler said.\n\n“I would have that signed by the President, that would make very clear what the priorities are in this industrial base, and then set some very clear goals,” Sadler told the DCNF. “How many ships will we get? Will we meet the need to have tankers in the Navy, and who will be responsible? Not just submit a plan, but more ‘I want this many ships per year.'”\n\n“President Trump has long discussed rebuilding America’s shipbuilding capabilities,” Anna Kelly, deputy White House press secretary, told the DCNF. “The White House, however, does not have any formal announcements to make at this time.”\n\nAll content created by the Daily Caller News Foundation, an independent and nonpartisan newswire service, is available without charge to any legitimate news publisher that can provide a large audience.
