It is also not known “what kind of pressure — either economic or diplomatic” Trump will place on the third countries to accept the immigrants.\n\nEarlier, Trump has said that he is willing to declare a state of emergency and utilise the military to carry out mass deportations.\n\nIn a Thursday statement, the office of Bahamian Prime Minister Philip Davis said it had “reviewed and firmly rejected” the scheme to have the Bahamas accept deportation flights.\n\nThe Turks and Caicos Islands will also not welcome the deported immigrants, Arlington Musgrove, the minister of immigration and border services for the archipelago neighbouring the Bahamas said on Thursday, the Miami Herald reported.\n\nDemocratic outgoing President Joe Biden had applied a similar immigration measure during his tenure. In 2022, he started negotiating with Suriname to accept Afghan refugees held at a US base in Kosovo after they failed to meet entry requirements to the US, the Wall Street Journal reported in 2022, citing unnamed officials. According to the Miami Herald, Suriname recently agreed to accept those refugees.\n\nIs this similar to the UK’s Rwanda plan?\n\nIn April 2022, under a Conservative Party government, the United Kingdom announced that it would send people seeking asylum in the UK to Rwanda.\n\nIn November 2023, the UK Supreme Court declared the plan unlawful, citing safety concerns. However, the UK government signed a new treaty with Rwanda, adding security safeguards. In April of this year, the treaty was ratified and the Safety of Rwanda Act became law.\n\nHowever, the Labour Party has since won the UK election in July and cancelled the Rwanda plan.\n\nAre there other precedents?\n\nSince 2016, Turkey has hosted refugees from Syria as a part of a deal with the European Union, where those fleeing the war in the Middle Eastern country were headed.\n\nIn May this year, 15 EU countries demanded that the bloc tighten its asylum policy to make it easier to transfer asylum seekers to third countries.\n\nThese countries included Austria, Bulgaria, Cyprus, the Czech Republic, Denmark, Finland, Estonia, Greece, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Malta, the Netherlands, Poland and Romania.\n\nIn February, Italy and Albania signed a five-year deal for the European nation to transfer asylum seekers from “safe” countries to detention centres in Albania. But in November, seven asylum seekers from Bangladesh and Egypt were taken from Albania to Italy after an Italian court rejected the government’s request to detain them in the Balkan nation.\n\nWhy is Trump’s plan controversial?\n\nTrump’s deportation plan intends to move people to countries to which they have no links.\n\nA mass deportation plan would need the cooperation of many foreign governments.\n\nIn addition, many lawyers and activists argue that turning away asylum seekers fleeing violence or persecution represents a violation of international law.\n\nDuring Trump’s first term, he carried out a similar measure between 2019 and 2020, placing immigrants on a plane to Guatemala. This move, smaller in scale than Trump’s current plan, was halted during the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nThe US civil rights nonprofit, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), and other pro-immigrant rights groups sued Trump over this plan. The case is still pending in federal court.\n\n“We sued over this type of policy during the first Trump administration because it was illegal and put asylum seekers at grave risk,” Lee Gelernt, a lawyer with the ACLU, told NBC.\n\nIn November, the ACLU released a statement, saying, “We are crystal clear that the next Trump administration will do everything in its power to make mass deportation raids a reality.”","url":"https://trinidadtribune.com/bahamas-setback-whats-trumps-plan-to-expel-migrants-to-third-countries/","image":"https://trinidadtribune.com/app/uploads/2024/11/2024-11-17T115230Z_1506904020_RC2X2BARLUS8_RTRMADP_3_ISRAEL-PALESTINIANS-LEBANON-1731844798-NNoVx8.jpeg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-12-07 01:15:46","author":null,"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"tt","sentiment":-0.06},{"id":271117394,"title":"'You're Disgusting:' Radio Host Unloads on Liberal After She Accuses Pete Hegseth of Being a Rapist","text":"Conservative radio host Ben Fergusen unloaded on a liberal activist after accusing President-elect Donald Trump’s pick for defense secretary, Pete Hegseth, of rape and sexual abuse despite there being only hearsay with no evidence or even a name of the woman he allegedly “raped.” \n\nFrancesca Fiorentini appeared on “Piers Morgan Uncensored” to say that although she views Hegseth as being a strong candidate to oversee the military, he is a “rapist” who doesn’t “practice consent.” \n\n“Can I just say that I do think that Pete Hegseth actually is a good choice to oversee the U.S. military?

According to Hegseth’s legal team, he settled the case to protect his career as a Fox News host. The unidentified woman alleged that Hegseth took her phone, blocked the door to the hotel room, and refused to let her leave. However, she waited nearly four days after she claimed she was raped to go to the hospital and report it. Her husband, who was in another room at the same hotel at the time of the incident, told police officers that his wife did not seem drunk, nor was she slurring her words when she arrived back to the room later that night, at 4 a.m.\n\nIn addition, liberal media outlets and anonymous “sources” are accusing Hegseth of having a drinking problem who would constantly show up to work drunk and hungover. \n\nFergusen continued his rant, calling Fiorentini a “sick person” who has not one ounce of decency to be able to go on television and call someone a rapist she knows nothing about. \n\nHegseth has maintained innocence and said that Trump told him to “keep fighting” despite reports saying he may replace Hegseth with Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis (R-FL).","url":"https://townhall.com/tipsheet/saraharnold/2024/12/06/youre-disgusting-radio-host-unloads-on-liberal-after-she-accuses-pete-hegseth-of-being-a-rapist-n2648690","image":"https://media.townhall.com/cdn/hodl/2024/317/01376cf5-3ca0-44cb-a794-b34dae536c3c.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-12-07 01:09:47","author":"Sarah Arnold","authors":["Sarah Arnold"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.509},{"id":271117396,"title":"Why Are the Deepest Red State 'Republicans' the Most Opposed to Trump’s Cabinet and Agenda?","text":"Republican Rep. Chip Roy (R-TX) is raising concerns that certain establishment GOP lawmakers may quietly undermine President-elect Donald Trump’s agenda despite publicly claiming to support it. As Trump gears up for another four years in the White House, Roy fears some of his colleagues, particularly those with strong ties to the D.C. establishment, will work behind the scenes to thwart his policies or derail his efforts. The Texas representative’s warnings reflect a broader anxiety within the GOP about the deepening divide between the incoming Trump Administration and those deep inside the swamp. In addition to Roy, others also fear these Republicans may prioritize their political futures. \n\nDuring a discussion with Todd Starnes, Roy accused some congressional Republicans of secretly undermining Trump’s agenda and stonewalling his cabinet picks. \n\n“I think that Republicans in Congress are going to give lip service to backing the President's agenda, and behind the scenes, they're going to be stonewalling it. Unless some of us can kick them right in the rear end and make them deliver,” Roy said. \n\nHe said his Washington colleagues have already made excuses for why Trump cannot follow through on his campaign promises, such as enacting the largest deportation of illegal immigrants the U.S. has seen. \n\n“Truth is, you’re already hearing excuses,” Roy continued. “Well, we don’t have 60 votes in the Senate. You’re already hearing some of my colleagues say, ‘Well, we can’t do, you know, broad mass deportations,’ which, by the way, I think effectively just call it what it is, repatriation.”\n\n\"I think that Republicans in Congress are going to give lip service to backing the President's agenda, and behind the scenes, they're going to be stonewalling it.

Chip Roy Press Office (@RepChipRoy) December 4, 2024\n\nThis comes when Republicans have openly expressed their opposition to Trump’s cabinet picks. \n\nSen. Susan Collins (R-Maine) recently said she has “questions” about Trump’s defense secretary pick, Pete Hegseth. She is “concerned about the allegations against him and his treatment of women.” Despite admitting she had never met with Hegseth, sat down with him, or heard him speak at length, she said this.\n\nSen. Joni Ernst (R-IA) also wouldn’t confirm that she’s a “yes” to Hegseth, another setback for the former Fox News host. Reports claim Ernst was eyeing the Pentagon post before Hegseth was tapped in. \n\nSen.-elect John Curtis (R-Utah) has also been critical of some of Trump’s cabinet picks, especially the incoming president’s first pick for attorney general, former Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-FL). Curtis said he expects the more controversial nominees to “resolve themselves”—similar to what happened with Gaetz. \n\nSean Parnell, best known for his bid for the U.S. Senate in 2022, pointed out several reasons why someone in the GOP would oppose Trump’s cabinet appointees. \n\n“Why it that the states that are the most Trumpy, that are the most republican and conservative Idaho, South Dakota, Kansas, Mississippi, why are they the ones that are seemingly the most hesitant about giving Trump his cabinet?” Charlie Kirk asked Parnell. \n\nParnell pointed out that those deep red states have moderate senators, suggesting that they have their own interests. \n\n“I've heard whispers of, of, you know, other senators have interests in the military-industrial complex threat, Pete Hegseth as a threat to those interests,” he said. “And because those senators have ties to those organizations, they don't want Pete because they want those organizations to be intact. Other senators, you know, probably wanted to be a Secretary of Defense themselves. So maybe that's why they oppose.”","url":"https://townhall.com/tipsheet/saraharnold/2024/12/06/why-are-the-deepest-red-states-the-most-opposed-to-trumps-cabinet-n2648660","image":"https://media.townhall.com/cdn/hodl/2024/337/5ac56256-558c-4637-9bda-f0804385518e.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-12-07 01:09:47","author":"Sarah Arnold","authors":["Sarah Arnold"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.177},{"id":271116076,"title":"California bill to admit slaves' descendants in university on priority","text":"SACRAMENTO, California: A bill introduced this week in the California Assembly would allow descendants of slaves to get admission on priority at the University of California and California State University. \n\nAssembly Member Isaac Bryan, a Democrat who represents parts of Los Angeles and authored the legislation, said it would help rectify past and current discrimination at universities, two of the largest public university systems in the nation.\n\n\"For decades, universities gave preferential admission treatment to donors and their family members, while others tied to legacies of harm were ignored and at times outright excluded,\" Bryan told The Associated Press. \"We have a moral responsibility to do all we can to right those wrongs.\"\n\nLawmakers held a special meeting to figure out how to protect the state's progressive policies as Donald Trump prepares for his second term as President. The new Trump administration is expected to target programs focused on diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI). Efforts to limit DEI initiatives in colleges and state institutions have gained support since the U.S. Supreme Court banned affirmative action in college admissions last year. This ruling changed how diversity programs are viewed legally.\n\nRepublicans against campus diversity programs argue that they are unfair and push left-wing ideas. Trump has suggested laws to fine universities for having diversity programs. At the same time, legacy admissions, which give advantages to children of alumni and donors (often benefiting wealthy white families), have faced criticism. Critics say that after banning affirmative action but keeping legacy preferences, the Supreme Court made it harder for students of color to get into selective colleges.\n\nLawmaker Bryan supports a proposal inspired by California's Black Reparations Task Force to address these issues. In 2023, Black students made up only about four percent of California State University students and 4.7 percent of University of California students. Bryan's measure is part of a response to Trump's remarks about paying \"reparations\" to white students who, he claims, were hurt by DEI programs. The proposal will need months of legislative review before it can be approved.\n\nTrump's administration will include Stephen Miller, who is known for challenging corporate DEI policies, as deputy chief of policy. Trump has promised to eliminate \"wokeness\" from schools and to cut funding for those that oppose his plans. However, even his supporters admit he might not have the power to make such drastic changes immediately. \n\nTrump has also criticized the federal Department of Education, calling it overrun by \"radicals,\" and picked Linda McMahon, a former wrestling executive, to lead it. Like other conservatives, Trump has talked about shutting down the department, but doing so would likely require Congress to act.","url":"https://www.nigeriasun.com/news/274828459/california-bill-to-admit-slaves-descendants-in-university-on-priority","image":"https://cdn.bignewsnetwork.com/cus1733282992560.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-12-07 00:58:47","author":"Xinhua Outgoing U.s","authors":["Xinhua Outgoing U.s"],"language":"en","source_country":"ng","sentiment":-0.053},{"id":271115432,"title":"National Police Association Endorses Kash Patel to be Trump’s FBI Director","text":"“The National Police Association (NPA) proudly expresses our full support for Kash Patel's nomination to serve as the next Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation,” the NPA announced Friday.\n\nThe endorsement by the NPA, a nonprofit organization supporting law enforcement, comes as President-elect Donald Trump’s pick to head the FBI is under heavy fire from Democrats and liberal media attempting to assassinate his character and disparage his qualifications.\n\nIn its endorsement, NPA lauds Patel’s credentials, including his accomplishments as a federal prosecutor, legal liaison to the Joint Special Operations Command, Senior Counsel to the House Intelligence Committee and Chief of Staff to the Acting Secretary of Defense:\n\n“Kash Patel's extensive career in national security, law enforcement, and public service has demonstrated his unwavering commitment to upholding the rule of law, defending justice, and protecting the American people.”\n\n“We firmly believe that Kash Patel's appointment as FBI Director will mark a pivotal moment for law enforcement and public safety across the United States,” the NPA says, expressing confidence that, as FBI director, Patel will bring about much-needed reforms at the bureau:\n\n“His leadership will bring a renewed focus on collaboration, ethical standards, and the relentless pursuit of justice.\n\n“The National Police Association strongly endorses Kash Patel and urges his confirmation as Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation.

In 2017, the president-elect signed an executive order banning travelers from Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria, and Yemen for a 90-day period. The ban affected some of the 17,000 international students studying in the US at the time.\n\nLawsuits managed to temporarily block the order but it was upheld by the US Supreme Court in 2018. President Joe Biden suspended the ban after taking office in 2021. \n\nIn April, Trump vowed to restore the travel ban to “keep radical Islamic terrorists out of our country.”\n\nCornell University is warning pupils and staff that a similar ban is “likely to go into effect” once Trump is sworn in. An advisory on the university’s website states Kyrgyzstan, Nigeria, Myanmar, Sudan, Tanzania, Iran, Libya, North Korea, Syria, Venezuela, Yemen and Somalia could be targeted, with new countries like China and India potentially added to the list.\n\nWhen entering the US, students should have evidence of their connection to the university while at the airport, like a certificate of enrollment, transcript and evidence of funding. They should also carry their passports, visas and a valid employment authorization document, if applicable. \n\nStudents from the listed countries who can’t return to the US before Inauguration Day should communicate with a university advisor about travel plans and be prepared for delays, the institution said. \n\nStudents from countries not on the list are not expected to experience difficulties when returning to the US. Neither are people in transit through them on their way to the US. \n\nMeanwhile, USC is asking pupils not to make decisions based on social media, news reports, and rumors about potential new policies. \n\n“Please rely only on official communications from US government agencies and guidance from the university’s Office of International Services,” USC said. If problems arise at a US port of entry, students and staff are encouraged to call the university’s Immigration Clinic Hotline for help.","summary":"Some international students should prepare for ‘delays’ if they are not back before Trump gets back into White House","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/universities-foreign-students-inauguration-trump-b2660387.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2024/04/16/18/USC-Speech_Canceled_86172.jpg?width=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/oGz6bD0z-OhrQWqOm.mp4","publish_date":"2024-12-07 00:40:47","author":"Michelle Del Rey","authors":["Michelle Del Rey"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.378},{"id":271113496,"title":"TikTok closer to US ban after losing court appeal","text":"TikTok edged closer to being banned in the United States after it lost an appeal on Friday against a law requiring the video-sharing app to divest from its Chinese parent company by January 19.\n\nThe potential ban could strain US-China relations just as president-elect Donald Trump prepares to take office on January 20.\n\nTikTok said it would now appeal to the Supreme Court, which could choose to take up the case or let the circuit court's decision stand.\n\n\"The Supreme Court has an established historical record of protecting Americans' right to free speech, and we expect they will do just that on this important constitutional issue,\" the company said.\n\nTikTok will also be looking to Trump, who has emerged as an unlikely ally, arguing that a ban would mainly benefit Facebook parent company Meta's platforms, owned by Mark Zuckerberg.\n\nTrump's stance reflects broader conservative criticism of Meta for allegedly suppressing right-wing content, including the former president himself being banned from Facebook after the January 6, 2021, Capitol riot by his supporters.\n\nThe US government alleges TikTok allows Beijing to collect data and spy on users.

New Councilmembers Shoshana O’Keefe and Brent Blackaby were also sworn in at the ceremony, along with re-elected Councilmember Terry Taplin.\n\nThis year has been a turning point for the council, where five of the nine seats have changed hands since January. Ishii’s unexpected victory as a relative political outsider in the mayor’s race was perhaps the most pivotal moment for the council, which also saw two members unexpectedly resign at the start of the year and two others opt not to seek re-election.\n\nSpeaking to an audience of supporters, family members and local leaders, Ishii said she would work as mayor to build more housing, improve the city’s infrastructure and give police and firefighters “the tools they need to keep us safe,” among other goals. Looming over the ceremony was the coming second presidential administration of Donald Trump, and the threat it could pose to liberal cities such as Berkeley.\n\n“Many of us want to see a kinder country, a better country, a more compassionate country — the first step toward that dream starts here at home,” Ishii said. “It’s time to unite against the kind of forces in our country that threaten our values. It’s time to come together as one and create an example, an example of what a progressive city can be in the 21st Century.\n\n“We are embarking on a movement for a livable, affordable, accessible and safe city for all our residents.”\n\nMany in the audience cheered as Ishii took note of the fact that she is the first Asian American mayor of Berkeley, a city where one in five residents are Asian, as well as the first woman of color to hold the office.\n\n“For too long Asian women have been seen as meek and subservient — certainly not leadership material,” she said. “Taking this oath is one step closer towards breaking this stereotype and showing young women and girls that they, too, can be leaders.”\n\nStill, the turnover in City Hall could prove challenging for the new council and Ishii, who was president of Berkeley’s local League of Women Voters chapter but had never before run for office when she launched her campaign. The departures of Mayor Jesse Arreguín and Councilmembers Susan Wengraf and Sophie Hahn has meant the loss of decades of institutional wisdom. At Hahn and Wengraf’s final meeting earlier this week, Councilmember Ben Bartlett joked it was “very alarming” that he is now the body’s most senior member, having been first elected in 2016.\n\nMeanwhile, the administrative side of Berkeley’s government is led by City Manager Paul Buddenhagen, who has held that job for less than three months.\n\n“Yesterday, we almost had a tsunami,” Buddenhagen said at Friday’s ceremony, referring to the brief period the prior morning when forecasters feared an offshore earthquake could send destructive waves to the Northern California coast. “Today we have a different kind of a metaphorical, democratic tsunami of an all-new group of people coming in to reshape the city in positive ways.”\n\nO’Keefe, the newly elected representative for North Berkeley, said she believes the new council will work together effectively.\n\n“Everyone at their core is a very kind, decent human being who wants the best for Berkeley,” O’Keefe said. “As long as we can stick with that as our basis of interaction, I think we can do a good job.”\n\nShe and fellow incoming Councilmember Brent Blackaby, who won the seat Wengraf has held since 2008 representing the Berkeley Hills, said they have worked extensively to prepare for their new roles.\n\n“I don’t think you’re ever fully ready, but we’re going to be as ready as we can” be, Blackaby said. “It’s a time of new ideas, new perspectives to help move the city forward.”","summary":"Ishii&apos;s inauguration on Friday marks a turning point for Berkeley politics: Five of the nine seats on the City Council are now held by members elected this year.","url":"https://nation.lk/online/new-mayor-adena-ishii-pledges-to-make-berkeley-a-progressive-beacon-286815.html","image":"https://newspack-berkeleyside-cityside.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/20241207-001050.webp","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-12-07 00:30:05","author":"City Manager Paul","authors":["City Manager Paul"],"language":"en","source_country":"lk","sentiment":0.351},{"id":271114950,"title":"Trump campaign paid law firm employing RFK Jr. weeks after he endorsed Trump","text":"Weeks after Robert F.

Russophobic sentiment in Washington may negatively affect the approach that US President-elect Donald Trump’s administration will adopt towards Russia and Ukraine, Richard Black, the Schiller Institute’s representative at the UN, told TASS.\n\nAccording to him, \"the implications of Donald Trump's victory for US-Russia relations and for opportunities to stop the war in Ukraine are unclear as of now.\" \"The unfortunate affliction of Russophobia is widespread among the so-called experts and politicians in Washington, D.C., that is, Russophobia among the pool of establishment figures from which Trump will choose,\" he stressed.\n\n\"Certain among his reported first choices for leading people in his new administration who have called for rapid negotiations to end the war in Ukraine - such as former Congress members Tulsi Gabbard (Trump's pick for National Intelligence director - TASS) and Matt Gaetz (nominated to lead the Department of Justice - TASS) - have come under blistering and baseless attack from the neocon establishment in Congress and the corporate-controlled mass media,\" Black noted.\n\n\"We hope that first, Trump's repeated, publicly stated fear of a nuclear war in the near term between the US and Russia, - nuclear war, following from the current rapid escalation of the Ukraine war - and secondly, Trump's stated intent to foster an end to the war, that these two factors will determine Trump's actions with respect to President Putin's clear statement of Russia's security requirements. We hope that Trump opts for peace,\" the expert concluded.\n\nOn November 27, Trump nominated Keith Kellogg for the position of US special envoy for Ukraine and Russia. Kellogg favors a negotiated settlement of the conflict in Ukraine. He suggests persuading Moscow and Kiev to resume dialogue by freezing the current frontline. His plan, among other things, reportedly includes the phased lifting of sanctions and normalization of relations with Russia, provided Moscow agrees to a peace agreement, as well as a delay in considering Ukraine's NATO membership in exchange for security guarantees for Kiev.\n\nMeanwhile, Russian President Vladimir Putin pointed out earlier that resolving the Ukraine conflict required Kiev to withdraw troops from Donbass and Novorossiya and abandon plans to join NATO. Ukraine also needs to ensure full respect for the rights, freedoms and interests of Russian-speaking citizens. In addition, Moscow believes that all Western sanctions on Russia must be removed and Ukraine’s non-bloc and non-nuclear status must be guaranteed.","summary":"According to Richard Black, \"the implications of Donald Trump's victory for US-Russia relations and for opportunities to stop the war in Ukraine are unclear as of now\"","url":"https://tass.com/world/1883713","image":"https://tass.com/img/blocks/common/tass_logo_share_ru.png","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-12-07 00:20:55","author":"Tass","authors":["Tass"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"ru","sentiment":-0.038},{"id":271114216,"title":"Court clears way for TikTok ban in US unless Chinese owners sell it","text":"New York, Dec 7 (IANS) An appeals court has cleared the way for shutting down TikTok in the US unless its Chinese owners sell it by January 19, upholding a law passed by Congress to safeguard national security.\n\nThe court on Friday threw out the appeal by TikTok against the law disagreeing with the company’s Chinese owner’s contention that the law violated the Constitution’s guarantee of freedom of expression.\n\n“The government acted solely to protect that freedom from a foreign adversary nation and to limit that adversary’s ability to gather data on people in the US,” Judge Douglas Ginsburg wrote in the majority opinion.\n\nAttorney General Merrick Garland, whose department defended the law, welcomed the ruling.\n\n“Today’s decision is an important step in blocking the Chinese government from weaponising TikTok to collect sensitive information about millions of Americans, to covertly manipulate the content delivered to American audiences, and to undermine our national security,” he said summarising the lawmakers’ opposition to TikTok.\n\nWhile it is ironic that a company operating under the iron fist of the Chinese Communist Party invokes the US Constitution’s free expression guarantee, ByteDance said it will appeal the ruling to the Supreme Court.\n\nThe social media for short videos is owned by ByteDance and has about 170 million users in the US.\n\nUnder the law passed in April and signed by President Joe Biden, app stores like Google and Apple cannot provide TikTok in the US, and internet hosting companies cannot support it from January 19.\n\nIf they do not comply, they could face fines running into billions of dollars because the penalty is $5,000 for each user given access to TikTok.\n\nThe January 19 date is significant because it is two days before Donald Trump, who once supported the ban but changed his mind, becomes President.\n\nHe can ask Congress to rescind the law and in the interim not enforce it or accept cosmetic changes in ByteDance’s ownership as complying with the law.\n\nIn 2020, Trump citing national security risks unilaterally ordered it sold or face a ban, and while several companies scrambled to buy it, a court stayed the order.\n\nJoe Biden, who succeeded him, revoked the order, but Congress enacted the law requiring its sale.\n\nTrump changed his mind while out of office because it did not ban or restrict him like several US social media gaints and said he was for allowing it to operate in the US.\n\nOf the three judges in the Washington DC Court of Appeals panel, two were Indian Americans.\n\nJudge Naomi Rao concurred with Ginsburg, while Chief Judge Srinath Srinivasan wrote a separate judgment also upholding the ban.\n\nIndia banned TikTok and 58 other apps in 2020 over national security concerns.","summary":"New York, Dec 7 (IANS) An appeals court has cleared the way for shutting down TikTok in the US unless its Chinese owners sell it by January 19, upholding a law passed by Congress to safeguard national security.

But it’s unclear what his options look like in that timeline.\n\nOn the campaign trail, Trump appeared to change his tune around the app, which he had previously supported banning. He had issued an executive order banning the platform in 2020 during his first stint in office but the company successfully challenged the order in court.\n\n“I was at the point where I could have gotten it done if I wanted to,” he told MSNBC’s Squawk Box on March 11. “There are a lot of young kids on TikTok who will go crazy without it.

But filings also showed that Musk was also behind a political action committee using the late Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg's namesake — \"RBG PAC\" — in advertisements with misleading claims that Ginsburg held views on abortion that were similar to Trump's. Ginsburg's granddaughter, Clara Spera, told The New York Times in October that the PAC was an \"affront to her grandmother's legacy,\" and it was \"nothing short of appalling\" that Ginsburg's name was being used to support Trump's reelection campaign. Ginsburg openly supported abortion rights, whereas Trump put three conservative justices on the Supreme Court who were part of the majority opinion in the case striking down the federal right to an abortion. Musk put $20.5 million into the PAC, the only contribution it received. The group ran advertisements emphasizing Trump's statements that he would veto a national abortion ban if elected, and pointing to Ginsburg's statements that the decision in Roe v. Wade went too far. Musk also donated $10 million to the Senate Leadership Fund, which supports Republican Senate candidates, and $3 million to the MAHA Alliance PAC, a group affiliated with Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s \"Make America Healthy Again\" message.Through the America PAC, his main campaign vehicle, Musk and a handful of other donors funded a get-out-the-vote effort through door-knocking, texting, phone calls, mailers and advertisements. By far, America PAC's biggest expense was a $40.5 million payment to United States of America, Inc, a company registered last month with an address associated with Musk. It's unclear how exactly those funds were used. In October, Musk also pledged to give away $1 million a day to a registered voter in Pennsylvania who signed his petition. The sweepstakes were challenged in court, but a judge ruled that they could proceed. Musk's lawyers said the winners were not chosen by chance, but instead based on their personal stories, and the funds were part of a contract they signed to become spokespeople for his America PAC. Musk is now facing multiple lawsuits from participants who claim it was falsely billed as a lottery. He rose as a major political donor rapidly. In March, he posted on X, the social media platform Musk owns, that he would not donate to either presidential candidate. And then on July 3, he made his first contribution of $5 million to America PAC. Ten days later, he publicly announced his endorsement of Trump and quickly became a key figure in the former president's campaign. At a rally Musk held in Pennsylvania for Trump on Oct. 20, he reiterated a message featured in many of his X posts. \"This is the most important election in your lifetime,\" he said. \"If there's any election where you ever vote, it should be this one.\"After Trump's victory, the president-elect tapped him to lead a new initiative called the Department of Government Efficiency with former Republican presidential hopeful Vivek Ramaswamy, advising the president on cutting $500 billion in annual spending and reducing federal government positions.","summary":"Elon Musk was the largest donor in the 2024 election cycle, spending at least $277 million to back President-elect Donald Trump and other Republican candidates.","url":"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/elon-musk-277-million-trump-republican-candidates-donations/","image":"https://assets3.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2024/12/05/5813770c-fa53-4bf8-a79a-e3938794a071/thumbnail/1200x630/4250ed99c97364ffb40324b6d42cd762/gettyimages-2185934057.jpg?v=d633d0331cc96a4353754b3de830df72","video":"https://prod.vodvideo.cbsnews.com/cbsnews/vr/hls/3353986_hls/master.m3u8","publish_date":"2024-12-07 00:16:21","author":"Julia Ingram,Steve Reilly","authors":["Julia Ingram","Steve Reilly"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.156},{"id":271116000,"title":"As Elon Musk funded Donald Trump, so a political donor aided rise of China’s first emperor","text":"The involvement of business interests in the politics of the United States, and the massive amount of money that it entails, put American elections in a class of their own.\nPolitical contributions to the recently ended US presidential and congressional elections totalled an eye-watering US$15.9 billion, much of which represented the interests of corporations and ultra-high-net-worth individuals.\nIn an ideal world, political donations come with no strings attached. You have a photo opportunity with the candidate whose campaign fund you contributed to, or get invited to a fundraising dinner with the candidate in attendance.\nBut it is another story when millions are involved.\nTech billionaire Elon Musk reportedly gave US$132 million to president-elect Donald Trump and the Republican Party to help them win the White House and control of Congress.\nHe backed the right horse. Trump has included him among his cabinet picks and key appointments, as the head of a planned Department of Government Efficiency.\nAround 2,300 years ago, a wealthy merchant in China also benefited greatly from a political investment he made.\nLü Buwei was conducting business in the state of Zhao when he became friends with Yiren, a princeling of the state of Qin. Yiren was the grandson of the reigning king of Qin and one of the many sons of the heir apparent.\nYiren was a down and out minor royal in a foreign state, but Lü saw something in him and decided to invest time and money on Yiren.\n\nLü gave Yiren a large sum of money for his living expenses and also one of his dancing girls, Zhao Ji. She became Yiren’s favourite consort and bore him a son, Ying Zheng. Lü also went to the state of Qin and showered the heir apparent, Yiren’s father, and his wife with cash, thus gaining their favour.\nNext, Lü bribed the siblings of the wife of the heir apparent, who persuaded their childless sister to adopt Yiren as her own son, which she did. By various machinations, Lü also convinced the heir apparent and his wife to make Yiren their heir.\nIn 251 BC, the king of Qin died and the heir apparent became king. Overnight Yiren, who had languished in poverty in a foreign state not too long ago, became next in line to the throne of Qin.\nThe new king died within a year and Yiren ascended to the throne. As king, Yiren rewarded his friend and patron handsomely, making Lü counsellor-in-chief, the most powerful man in the kingdom, second only to the king, and conferring on him lands and titles.\nUnfortunately, Yiren died after only three years as king. Ying Zheng, the son of Yiren and Zhao Ji, ascended the throne as a 13-year-old boy. Lü was now even more powerful as regent, and the boy king addressed him as “uncle” (zhongfu, or the oldest among the younger brothers of one’s father).\n\nAs Ying Zheng grew older, he began to resent Lü’s overbearing influence in government. He also became aware that Lü and his mother, Zhao Ji, had been carrying on an illicit affair.\nSensing danger, Lü ceased his dalliance with the king’s mother, but Ying Zheng was not placated. In 237 BC, his 10th year as king, Ying Zheng dismissed Lü as counsellor-in-chief and sent him to live in his own domain outside the capital.\nEven when Lü was no longer in government, he continued to wield considerable influence, hosting important guests and envoys from other states at his private residence.\nIn 235 BC, Ying Zheng decided to exile Lü to the remote region of Shu (present-day Sichuan). Believing that Ying Zheng was determined to kill him, Lü took his own life.\nIt was not the ending Lü Buwei had wished for, obviously, but he had had a few good years in which he reaped the returns on his initial investment.\nYing Zheng, the son of Lü’s protégé Yiren, went on to unify the multiple warring Chinese states in 221 BC and, under the name Qin Shi Huang, proclaimed himself the first emperor of the Qin dynasty.\nAnd so began China’s age of empire.","summary":"Political contributions are not new – 2,300 years ago a rich merchant helped the father of China’s first emperor gain power, and his son.","url":"https://www.scmp.com/lifestyle/family-relationships/article/3289623/elon-musk-funded-donald-trump-so-political-donor-aided-rise-chinas-first-emperor","image":"https://cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2024/12/06/161a8a55-3c1e-454e-aa6e-4981633f4db6_29afd9bb.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-12-07 00:15:08","author":"Wee Kek Koon","authors":["Wee Kek Koon"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"cn","sentiment":0.193},{"id":271113146,"title":"'First Buddy' Elon Musk's secret £185m spend on Donald Trump election campaign revealed","text":"Elon Musk blew more than a quarter of a billion dollars to ensure Donald Trump was elected. \n\n Documents show that the Tesla owner nicknamed the ‘First Buddy’ given how close he has become to the president-elect, opened his chequebook in the final months of the campaign. Newly released Federal Election Commission show that the Tesla and SpaceX executive gave a total of $238 million (£185.5 million) to a super PAC (Political Action Committee) that he founded this year, America PAC, which worked to turn out voters on Trump’s behalf in key states.\n\n But, he was also the financial backer of other groups that emerged in the election’s final days. Musk’s unprecedented spending spree included a series of targeted initiatives, from a $20 million (£15.65 million) PAC to reframe Trump’s stance on abortion to multi-million-dollar grassroots campaigns designed to energise voters and swing key states. \n\nREAD MORE: Exact date Donald Trump will release all secret files on 'UFO and potential ETs' revealed\n\nREAD MORE: Everyone Donald Trump could free from Joe Exotic to Julian Assange and Proud Boys head\n\nOne of his most brazen moves was creating the “RBG PAC,” named after the late Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg. Its mission was to soften Trump’s image on abortion, a contentious issue in the wake of the Supreme Court’s decision, which overturned Roe v. Wade that protected termination rights.\n\n The RBG PAC ran ads showing Trump and Ginsburg with the tagline “Great Minds Think Alike,” falsely suggesting the two aligned on abortion policy. Critics, including Ginsburg’s family, were outraged. Her daughter released a scathing statement calling the ads “nothing short of appalling.”\n\n Though the campaign was criticised as misleading, it showed Musk’s willingness to use such ploys to soften Trump’s vulnerabilities. Federal Election Commission (FEC) filings later revealed Musk’s role in funding the PAC, though its leader, May Mailman, had previously hinted at his involvement.\n\n Musk’s spending spree extended far beyond the RBG PAC. He funnelled $40.5 million (£31.73 million) into a sweepstakes initiative that awarded $1 million (£783,450) daily to petition signers pledging support for the Constitution, effectively mobilising Trump’s voter base. \n\n At one point, Musk was contributing $25 million weekly to his America PAC, which played a central role in ground-level voter engagement and staffing efforts. The funds helped Trump’s campaign carry out a grassroots strategy, ensuring a strong showing in key battleground states.\n\nMusk's wallet didn't stop \n\n Musk also contributed $12 million (£9.4 million) to Republican-aligned Super PACs, including the Senate Leadership Fund and the Sentinel Action Fund, to reclaim GOP control of the Senate.

This year’s theme was “pluralism.” In classic Obama style, he illustrated the concept with homey examples like a church and a mosque agreeing to share a parking lot. The kind of “pluralism” that seemed to most interest him, though, was that of divergent political factions that can “form coalitions, compete for support and elect representatives who will then go and negotiate and compromise and hopefully advance our interests.” He studiously avoided saying the name of the president-elect, but the presence of Donald Trump hung over the whole event like a particularly grotesque balloon at a Macy’s Thanksgiving parade. Obama’s remarks celebrating the way flourishing liberal democracies are supposed to work, in the context of the return to power of the man who tried to steal the last election, are a vivid reminder that in the United States of America today, the machinery isn’t exactly humming along in perfect order. Obama’s characteristic rhetorical virtues were on full display. He was a constitutional law professor before he was a politician, and he still sounds like one. At the same time, he was a once-in-a-generation talent as a political communicator. He knows how to convey a complex set of ideas in a digestible and appealing way. But there was a massive gaping hole at the center of his speech. He still doesn’t understand why his eight years in power culminated in the rise of Trump. Despite his considerable talents, his brand of centrist liberalism is fundamentally inadequate to the historical moment in which he now finds himself. And his speech in Chicago offered nothing but more of the same. In Obama's telling of the story of America’s experiment in political pluralism, the system worked pretty smoothly in the 20th century, but all wasn’t well beneath the surface. “Democracy,” he said, “was built on top of a deeply entrenched caste system — formal and informal, based on race and gender and class and sexual orientation.” One at a time, various marginalized and underrepresented groups got a “seat at the table.” When this happened, pluralism became far more difficult, because the political conflicts exposed by this enriching of our democracy went deeper than the old “fights about roads and taxes.” But if pluralism is now more challenging, he suggested, it’s therefore become that much more urgent. The word “inequality” appeared exactly twice in the nearly 5,000 words of Obama’s speech. One reference was too vague for it to be clear who exactly was “unequal” to whom. The other specified that he was thinking of the inequalities between “urban” and “rural” populations and “knowledge workers” and those who work with their hands. These are certainly real forms of economic imbalance. But the income gap between an office worker in a city and a rural manual laborer is a rounding error on the scale of the inequality between any of these people and, say, Capital One CEO Richard Fairbank, whose annual salary is in the tens of millions, and whose net worth seems to hover over a billion. To put that number in perspective, if we imagine an immortal vampire crossing the ocean with Christopher Columbus in 1492 and somehow earning the exact equivalent of one thousand dollars every day since then, the vampire would have only about $194 million today. (As one of the Obama Democracy Forum’s sponsors, the Capital One logo regularly appeared on the livestream’s lower-third graphics.) It should go without saying that the small number of Americans with that kind of wealth have a tremendously concentrated amount of power in the economic domain, where they can gain or forfeit power over the lives of vast numbers of employees by buying and selling companies, as well as far more political influence than ordinary citizens. This kind of inequality, though, seems to be entirely outside of Obama’s sphere of concern. Even the use of the word “class” in the phrase “race and gender and class and sexual orientation” is highly telling. The kind of centrist liberalism represented by Obama sees social justice in terms of making sure that the best and brightest members of each demographic group have an equal shot at rising to the top of society, where they can become CEOs themselves, or become politicians and participate in the process he rhapsodized about earlier, whereby bright and competent technocrats “negotiate and compromise and hopefully advance our interests.” When “class” is simply one more item on this list of identity characteristics, it’s clear that he’s talking about making sure that particularly bright and deserving individuals from working-class backgrounds can rise to the top. He’s not interested in giving the working class as a whole more structural power in our economy or our society. In other words, this is the same old centrism. Obama’s version of “pluralism” has always been integral to his message. He first came to national prominence with his speech at the 2004 Democratic National Convention, where he charismatically spoke about how we should resist the efforts of pundits to “slice-and-dice our country into Red States and Blue States” rather than seeing us simply as the United States. His message has always been anti-polarization. As president, Obama did get an incremental form of health care reform through Congress — the Affordable Care Act, aka “Obamacare” — but it was one that preserved the fundamental injustices of the system. Many Americans stay in jobs they hate for fear of losing their employer health insurance. Others don’t have insurance at all, which sometimes leads to grisly outcomes like diabetics dying when they try to ration out their insulin. And even those lucky enough to be insured often are often faced with a bureaucratic nightmare when they have medical emergencies. For-profit insurance companies have every incentive to “Delay, Deny and Defend” when clients make claims. This phrase is the title of a 2010 book on the industry by Rutgers law professor Jay Feinman. And the words “delay,” “deny,” and “depose” were reportedly written on the casings of the bullets found at scene where UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson was killed in New York the day before Obama’s speech. If you want an indication of whether the reforms in Obamacare were sufficient to allay ordinary Americans’ anger about our health care system, look no further than the online reactions to that shocking act of violence. During Obama’s eight years in power, America’s wars in the Middle East ground slowly onward. This was a crucial factor in the rise of Trump, who was able to (deceptively) market himself as “anti-war.” And on the economic front, Obama continued George W. Bush’s policy of bailing out “too big to fail” banks while leaving homeowners who lost their houses in the 2008 crash underwater. He oversaw eight years of mounting economic inequality. Those eight years saw flashes of left-wing populist outrage like Occupy Wall Street and the first Bernie Sanders campaign. These were handily defeated by the powers-that-be, though, from the NYPD clearing the protesters from Zuccotti Park to the Democratic Party quelling the Sanders insurgency. And at the end of the day there was nowhere for all that populist energy to go but Trump. Obama’s liberalism is far more concerned with shattering glass ceilings for deserving strivers than raising the floor of material security for everyone. And that’s exactly the kind of liberalism that failed the first time — so spectacularly that a grotesque pseudo-populist demagogue was Obama’s immediate successor. Now Obama’s vice president, Joe Biden, is running out the clock on his presidency, and Trump is returning to power, this time with far more working-class support. Meanwhile, more than a few Americans have despaired so thoroughly of fixing our society through politics that they’re willing to cheer for an assassin murdering a health care CEO in broad daylight on the streets of Manhattan. We urgently need a far better response to the current crisis than anything the dominant faction of the Democratic Party is offering. And the first step is to stop listening to Barack Obama.","url":"https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/barack-obama-democracy-forum-speech-trump-era-rcna183127","image":"https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-1500w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2024-12/241205-barack-obama-democracy-forum-ac-1019p-da3118.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-12-06 23:50:46","author":"Ben Burgis","authors":["Ben Burgis"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.059},{"id":271106558,"title":"Right-wing crypto investor David Sacks to steer Trump’s policies on AI and crypto","text":"Donald Trump announced Thursday he intends to make tech investor David Sacks his cryptocurrency and artificial intelligence “czar,” essentially giving Sacks the reins to steer the administration’s policy on both fronts. The position would enable Sacks to potentially recommend that artificial intelligence be used in ways that could allow Trump and his crypto bro backers to enrich themselves and worsen inequality. A former PayPal executive, Sacks is a part-time podcaster and member of the Big Tech oligarchy that has become a major financier of Republican politicians. He helped garner support from Silicon Valley elites for Trump, an effort that included hosting a ritzy fundraiser in June. Sacks has been obsessed with rooting out “wokeness” in American society and has also peddled the pro-Kremlin talking point that Russia was “provoked” to invade Ukraine. Sacks is an ally of Elon Musk and Peter Thiel, who, as Joy Reid highlighted in October, spent all or some of their youths in apartheid South Africa. Joy’s segment discusses how the conservative politics all three men are boosting here resemble the ones that dominated South Africa at that time. Sacks also sits on the board of directors for the far-right video platform Rumble. More relevant to his proposed portfolio, Sacks launched an artificial intelligence company called Glue this year and is known to be a major investor in cryptocurrencies, which would seem likely to create some conflicts of interest if he’s steering the administration’s AI and crypto policies. The New York Times, citing Sacks’ company, reports that the “position is not full time,” so it’s unclear right now whether Sacks’ role will carry any real weight or be simply advisory. Particularly when it comes to AI, it’s hard to understate the kind of influence Sacks could have on virtually every aspect of American life. In the coming months and years, an AI czar is likely to face questions of how the country should guard against AI-enabled attacks from foreign adversaries; of how the government could —or should — deploy AI to surveil American citizens and, potentially, crack down on abortion; and of the potential harms to nonwhite residents from AI algorithms, which have been shown to exacerbate housing discrimination, disparities in the criminal justice system and disproportionate auditing from the Internal Revenue Service. By giving a position like this to a Trump loyalist like Sacks, who’s already shown his commitment to the MAGA cause, it’s possible the administration will not put many guardrails around what is arguably the most powerful emerging technology — artificial intelligence. Earlier this year, President Joe Biden warned that “we must make certain that the awesome capabilities of AI will be used to uplift and empower everyday people, not to give dictators more powerful shackles on the human spirit.” With Sacks informing the administration’s AI and crypto policies, the U.S. might be the ones forging those chains.","url":"https://www.msnbc.com/the-reidout/reidout-blog/david-sacks-ai-crypto-czar-artificial-intelligence-trump-rcna183217","image":"https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-1500w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2024-12/241206-David-Sacks-ch-1318-f915cb.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-12-06 23:50:46","author":"Ja'han Jones","authors":["Ja'han Jones"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.036},{"id":271106552,"title":"What is going on in France? Macron's strategy backfires","text":"Emmanuel Macron rolled the dice and came up snake eyes. The French president took a big gamble six months ago, when he dissolved the parliament and called snap elections hoping to stem the growing power of the extreme right. But that decision appeared to backfire this week, when parliament passed a no-confidence measure against the prime minister and thus the entire Cabinet for the first time in decades. The inciting complaints included a distasteful budget, narrow tax increases and belt-tightening. But the real issues run far deeper. Ever since his arrival in office more than seven years ago, Macron has made it his mission to reform an ancestral French system that few of his voters seem to want to change. His two predecessors — right-wing Nicolas Sarkozy and the Socialist party's François Hollande — expended enormous political capital simply tinkering around the edges and ended up with one-term presidencies. Macron has had more success, twice defeating far-right opponent Marine Le Pen, but largely because not enough French people are yet willing to turn their nation over to someone with ties to France’s dark, fascist past. The French people protested en masse when Macron sought to raise gas taxes to force an unwelcome move toward green energy — but they returned him to office. Now term-limited, he started to try to turn up the heat on reform. Back into the streets went voters after Macron sought to raise the notoriously low retirement age from 62 to 64. Such a move could have helped drag the country out of the 17th century, where it has so long been mired. But there was still the question of a ballooning budget deficit and national debt. By choosing Michel Barnier to be his prime minister, Macron apparently felt he could finesse his problems with both the far right and the far left by choosing a neutral technocrat. But in France’s deeply polarized atmosphere, this compromise attempt did not work. As Macron has now experienced, the middle of the road is where folks in France simply get run over. Macron is known for his pitch-perfect political skills. But he seems to have misjudged the broad drift to the right sweeping across Europe. Germany will have its own snap elections in February, after the neo-fascist AfD swept local elections. In Romania, on Friday, two days before the second round of presidential elections, the nation’s constitutional court suddenly annulled the entire vote. An heir of the Iron Guard fascists of World War II and self-described Vladimir Putin acolyte took first place in the first round following allegedly widespread intervention by Kremlin allies. The French by and large recognize they are poised on the lip of a deep abyss — politically and financially — with few good routes back. The hardly united opposition has never agreed on much of anything except its distaste for Macron and his (sometimes unreasonably arrogant) methods. In his first speech to the nation following his government’s collapse, Macron offered little beyond “the need to work together for France,” and a promise to find another prime minister. He also suggested that a new government budget might not be cobbled together before the end of the year, proposing instead a continuing resolution like in the United States. Simply put, Macron has overreached, overplayed his hand and, though perhaps more adept than his predecessors, may well have to pay a similar price. Unable to bend the unbending French people to their will, these former presidents were each forced into a retirement bereft of influence. They left behind terms with few accomplishments. And the French people will likely be the ultimate victims — of higher taxes and an increasingly threadbare existence. In an overnight snap poll published Thursday by Toluna Harris, a very slim majority of French voters approved of the no-confidence vote. But more than 80% feared for the future of France, its economy and the ballooning public debt, which has now surpassed Greece, Italy and Spain. But this weekend, Macron will have another chance to try to reassure his anxious citizens and reclaim a degree of the political capital he has squandered. On Sunday, he presides over the grand unveiling of France’s landmark Notre Dame Cathedral — destroyed in a 2019 fire, now reborn. Macron urged this profoundly Catholic nation to come together and pledged what many at the time considered an impossible task — to rebuild the shattered landmark in five years. And it was done. Now, surrounded by 50 heads of state, including his longtime nemesis and soon-to-be counterpart President-elect Donald Trump, Macron will lead a ceremony every French voter will be watching with delight and awe. Will it be enough?","url":"https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/france-macron-strategy-backfires-far-right-lepen-rcna183211","image":"https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-1500w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2024-12/241206-emmanuel-macron-se-143p-bf84b5.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-12-06 23:50:46","author":"David A.

Most of that money went through Musk’s pro-Trump America PAC, to which the Tesla and X CEO donated $238 million. And $120 million of that came in the final weeks before Election Day, NBC News reported, citing the group’s latest campaign finance report. Filings also show that Musk donated more than $20 million to RBG PAC, a super PAC created just days before the election that aired ads claiming that Trump does not support a federal abortion ban. (Trump has made deeply inconsistent comments on the subject, but he did say in October that he opposes a federal ban.) RBG PAC was the subject of some controversy over its claim that Trump and the late Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg shared the same views on the issue. Ginsburg’s granddaughter Clara Spera told The New York Times in October, “The use of her name and image to support Donald Trump’s re-election campaign, and specifically to suggest that she would approve of his position on abortion, is nothing short of appalling.” Musk’s financial contribution to Trump’s re-election has made him the largest political donor this election cycle. NBC News reported last month that Musk stood to reap enormous returns on his investment in Trump: Some of that is already playing out: Musk has been named co-chair of the “Department of Government Efficiency” alongside businessman Vivek Ramaswamy, a nongovernmental task force (not an actual department of the government) that has proposed, among other things, cutting government spending, firing federal employees and ending remote-work policies. As part of that initiative, Musk and Ramaswamy met with lawmakers on Capitol Hill this week to discuss plans to shrink the federal government. What’s more, Musk seems to be positioning himself to have a direct influence on Trump’s policies and decisions. He has sat in on Trump’s calls with world leaders, like Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, and he has reportedly clashed with Trump aides over the president-elect’s Cabinet picks. NBC News reported in November that Musk has been by Trump’s side so much that his presence has begun to grate on some in the president-elect’s inner circle.","url":"https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/elon-musk-trump-donations-2024-election-rcna183231","image":"https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-1500w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2024-11/241107-donald-trump-elon-musk-greeting-ac-507p-5d7c6e.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-12-06 23:50:46","author":"Clarissa-Jan Lim","authors":["Clarissa-Jan Lim"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.036},{"id":271106550,"title":"Judge agrees to drop manslaughter charge against Daniel Penny in death of Jordan Neely","text":"The top criminal charge against Daniel Penny was dismissed on Friday in the 2023 death of Jordan Neely, which prosecutors argued at trial was the result of Penny going too far in restraining Neely on a New York City subway. The dismissal reported by NBC News came during jury deliberations, as jurors told the judge they couldn't come to agreement on that charge and the prosecution moved to dismiss it, so that jurors can now consider a lower charge of criminally negligent homicide. Penny faced up to 15 years had he been convicted of that top charge, second-degree manslaughter. The remaining charge he still faces, criminally negligent homicide, carries a maximum sentence of up to four years. If Penny is found guilty of the remaining charge then one of the issues he might raise on an appeal is a challenge to the judge’s decision to grant the prosecution’s request to drop the top count as opposed to declaring a mistrial when the jury couldn’t come to an agreement. The jury will resume deliberations on Monday. Penny had pleaded not guilty in the case that spotlighted issues of race, public safety, mental health and vigilantism in the city. The manslaughter count alleged that Penny, a white Marine veteran in his mid-20s, recklessly caused the death of Neely, a 30-year-old homeless Black man, while the second charge alleged Penny caused Neely’s death with criminal negligence. The New York Times recounted the facts of the case: As NBC News reported, “Penny and his attorneys have said that he acted to protect other passengers and that he did not intend to harm Neely, only to restrain him until police arrived.\" Penny’s defense counsel argued that the chokehold didn’t kill Neely, claiming Neely’s health issues and drug use led to his death. The state argued that, even if Penny’s initial actions were laudable, he broke the law by continuing to hold Neely after Neely was no longer a threat. Penny didn’t realize that Neely was also a person whose life needed protecting, the prosecutor told the jury. This is a developing story. Check back for updates.

During an appearance on MSNBC’s The Beat with Ari Melber, Carville dismissed claims that former Trump adviser Steve Bannon was behind the controversial picks. Instead, he pointed to someone he described as far more clever and connected. “Steve Bannon does not drive this,” Carville stated. “One person is driving this, I promise you. And it’s Tucker Carlson. Tucker’s an old friend of mine.” \n\nAccording to HuffPost, Carville, who once sparred with Carlson on CNN’s Crossfire, emphasized Carlson’s strategic influence, describing him as “40 times more clever than Steve Bannon” and “40 times more connected.” He further noted Carlson’s ties to tech mogul Elon Musk, calling him a “very bright man who should not be underrated.” \n\nCarville’s comments came in response to MSNBC journalist Jonathan Lemire discussing Trump’s nomination of Kash Patel as FBI director. Patel, a staunch Trump ally and vocal critic of the Justice Department, has been described as 'profoundly unqualified' by former FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe. Patel previously supported Trump during his impeachment investigation and advocated for sweeping changes within federal agencies. Carville argued that Patel’s nomination, alongside other contentious picks, underscores Carlson’s influence. “This is not Steve Bannon’s doing,” Carville reiterated. “This is Tucker Carlson, and the Kash Patel pick proves it.”\n\n“Everything that I see is the same thing I heard in the green room in 2002,” Carville said, referring to his past experiences with Carlson. Other nominations under scrutiny include Pete Hegseth for defense secretary, Robert F. Kennedy Jr. for health and human services secretary, and, initially, Matt Gaetz for attorney general. Gaetz withdrew his name following allegations of sexual misconduct and drug use, which he denies, as per NBC News. Critics have raised concerns about Hegseth’s suitability for the role, citing his alignment with far-right ideologies and previous misconduct allegations, but Carville argued that these choices reflect Carlson’s deep ties within Trump’s inner circle.\n\nCarville also addressed an erroneous claim he made during the segment in which he suggested a business partnership between Carlson and Patel, as reported by The Daily Beast. The connection he referenced was actually with Neil Patel, co-founder of The Daily Caller. Neil later posted online, criticizing Carville for the mix-up. However, this error did not deter Carville from reiterating his broader point about Carlson’s unparalleled influence. “Tucker is very, very, very powerful,” Carville emphasized. \n\n“He has more influence in this current administration—way more than Vernon Jordan had in the Clinton administration or any of the wise men that were around.” He also spoke about Trump tapping Musk to co-lead the newly proposed Department of Government Efficiency, a move reportedly motivated by the tech mogul's substantial campaign donations.","summary":"During an appearance on MSNBC, Carville dismissed claims that former Trump adviser Steve Bannon was behind the controversial picks.","url":"https://www.inquisitr.com/james-carville-says-a-very-powerful-person-is-behind-trumps-cabinet-picks-40-times-more","image":"https://dab57h0r8ahff.cloudfront.net/727343/uploads/5e0d1680-b2dc-11ef-8b2a-b1c012f70ac7_1200_630.jpeg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-12-06 23:45:00","author":"INQUISITR,Prachi Mallick","authors":["INQUISITR","Prachi Mallick"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.182},{"id":271109256,"title":"Iran set to boost uranium enrichment near weapons-grade amid tensions in Middle East","text":"Iran is on the brink of \"quite dramatically\" increasing its stockpile of near weapons-grade uranium - according to a chilling warning from the head of the International Atomic Energy Agency, Rafael Mariano Grossi. \n\nThis comes hot on the heels of Iran's successful space launch with its heaviest payload ever, a move that Western powers believe bolsters Tehran's ballistic missile programme.\n\nThe Simorgh rocket launch coincides with Iran's nuclear programme now enriching uranium at 60%, just a stone's throw away from weapons-grade levels of 90%. \n\nREAD MORE:Baba Vanga's chilling 'great war' prediction could mean World War 3 is just months away\n\nREAD MORE: UK's least safest places to live if nuclear strike launched on 'seat of power' – see full list\n\nDespite Iran's insistence that its programme is peaceful, officials in the Islamic Republic are increasingly threatening to potentially seek the bomb.

So we are going to see.\"\n\nHe continued: \"If they really make them turn - all of them - it's going to be a huge jump.\"\n\nShortly following Grossi's statements, an IAEA release confirmed that Iran had commenced supplying uranium, enriched up to 20%, to two string of advanced IR-6 centrifuges within its subterranean Fordo stronghold safeguarded beneath a mountain from aerial bombardments.\n\nThe International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) issued a warning in late November that Iran was gearing up to enrich uranium using thousands of advanced centrifuges. This move came as a response to the IAEA's Board of Governors condemning Iran for its lack of full cooperation with the agency.\n\nIran has yet to acknowledge these preparations, and the Iranian mission to the United Nations has not responded to requests for comment.","summary":"Iran is poised to 'quite dramatically' increase its stockpile of near weapons-grade uranium as it has started cascades of advanced centrifuges, the head of the International Atomic Energy Agency warned on Friday,","url":"https://www.dailystar.co.uk/news/world-news/iran-set-boost-uranium-enrichment-34267094","image":"https://i2-prod.dailystar.co.uk/news/world-news/article34266809.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/2_iran.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-12-06 23:44:27","author":"Vince Soodin","authors":["Vince Soodin"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":0.1},{"id":271109450,"title":"Donald Trump says he thinks Pete Hegseth can get confirmed in NBC News interview","text":"Former President Donald Trump expressed confidence in his pick to run the Pentagon, former Fox News host Pete Hegseth, amid allegations of excessive drinking and abuse of women. \"It looks like Pete is doing well now,\" Trump said in an exclusive interview with \"Meet the Press\" Moderator Kristen Welker that will air Sunday.\" \"I mean, people were a little bit concerned. He’s a young guy, with a tremendous track record actually. He went to Princeton and went to Harvard. He was a good student at both. But he loves the military and I think people are starting to see it so we’ll be working on his nomination along with a lot of others.\" Read more on this story at NBCNews.com and watch Kristen Welker’s full interview on “Meet the Press” on Sunday morning at 10:30 a.m. ET or check local listings. NBC News reported on Tuesday that Hegseth's nomination was in peril with as many as six Senate Republicans not currently comfortable with supporting his bid, three GOP sources with direct knowledge of the nomination process said, amid reports highlighting concerns from colleagues over his drinking and allegations of sexual misconduct. NBC News reported Tuesday that Hegseth's drinking worried his Fox News colleagues, 10 current and former employees of the network said. Two of those sources said Hegseth smelled of alcohol before he went on air more than a dozen times. A Trump transition spokesperson called the claims \"completely unfounded and false.\" Separately, Hegseth, an Army National Guard veteran, was accused of sexually assaulting a woman in California in 2017, as a police report that was made public after Trump nominated him detailed. He was not charged, and Hegseth said the encounter was consensual. He paid the woman an undisclosed amount as part of a settlement. This week, Hegseth took meetings on Capitol Hill in an effort to reassure senators — and the president-elect. \"Yes I do, I really do,\" Trump said when Welker asked if he maintained confidence in the pick. \"He’s a very smart guy. I’ve known him through Fox, but I’ve known him for a long time. And he’s basically a military guy. Every time I talk to him, all he wants to talk about is the military. He’s a military guy.\" Pressed on whether senators assured Trump that Hegseth can be confirmed, Trump said \"a lot of senators call me up saying he’s fantastic.\" Welker noted that Trump himself does not drink and has warned of the dangers of excessive drinking. She asked if he has concerns that his pick to oversee the U.S. military has struggled with drinking, according to those who've worked with him. \"But I’ve spoken to people that know him very well and they say he does not have a drinking problem,\" Trump responded.","summary":"Former President Donald Trump expressed confidence in his pick to run the Pentagon, former Fox News host Pete Hegseth, amid allegations of excessive drinking and abuse of women.","url":"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/trump-says-embattled-pentagon-pick-pete-hegseth-well-now-nbc-news-inte-rcna182856","image":"https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-1500w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2024-12/241206-MTP-Welker-Trump-5-ew-454p-926860.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-12-06 23:44:13","author":"Allan Smith","authors":["Allan Smith"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.004},{"id":271114588,"title":"U.S. federal judge rules Alabama city must allow gay pride float at Christmas parade","text":"Shopping Trends\n\n The Shopping Trends team is independent of the journalists at CTV News.

During a speech Thursday at the Obama Foundation's Democracy Forum, Obama made the case that if \"one side\" attempts to cement \"a permanent grip on power\" through \"suppressing votes,\" \"politicizing\" the military or weaponizing the judiciary and criminal justice system to target opponents, \"a line has been crossed.\" \"Pluralism is not about holding hands and singing ‘Kumbaya,’\" Obama said. \"It is not about abandoning your convictions and folding when things get tough. It is about recognizing that, in a democracy, power comes from forging alliances and building coalitions and making room in those coalitions not only for the woke, but the waking. \"Purity tests are not a recipe for long-term success.\" ‘DEPORTER-IN-CHIEF’ OBAMA SURPASSED DEPORTATIONS UNDER TRUMP’S FIRST TERM Obama’s speech quickly drew strong criticism from conservatives. \"It’s over for Obama,\" journalist Miranda Devine posted on X. \"The spell is broken.

Që nga mesi i tetorit, është rritur me gati 50% (shih grafikun), duke arritur gati 100 mijë dollarë.\n\nNuk është vetëm Bitcoin që ka pasur rritje. Duke përjashtuar monedhat e qëndrueshme “stablecoins”, të cilat janë krijuar për të shmangur luhatjet e çmimeve, 20 kriptomonedhat kryesore janë rritur edhe më shpejt në vlerë sesa bitcoin, gjatë javës së kaluar.\n\nDogecoin, një monedhë e reklamuar shpesh nga Elon Musk, përkrahës i Trump i kthyer në këshilltar të tijin, është rritur me 140% që nga dita e zgjedhjeve. Vlera e tregut global të kriptomonedhave, arriti në 3 trilionë dollarë për herë të parë më 12 nëntor.\n\nKjo shënon një rikthim mahnitës që nga periudha 2022-23, kur një stuhi e përsosur shkaktoi që kriptomonedhat të binin nga majat që kishin arritur gjatë manisë së vitit 2021. Në atë kohë, Rezerva Federale po rriste me shpejtësi normat e interesit, duke ftohur spekulimet që kishin pushtuar tregjet pas pandemisë Covid-19.\n\nPër shkak të menaxhimit të dobët dhe mashtrimeve, u shembën disa kompani kriptomonedhash që më parë kishin pasur prestigj të madh, midis të cilave FTX, një nga sistemet që mundëson shkëmbimet më të mëdha të kriptomonedhave, duke njollosur kështu të gjithë industrinë. Mbikëqyrësit financiarë filluan të vërsuleshin.\n\nNë fund të vitit 2023, kur do të mbaheshin zgjedhjet e ndërmjetme në Amerikë, industria e kriptomonedhave pa një mundësi për të kthyer faqe.\n\nNë muajt në vijim, Trump u kthye në një kampion të kriptomonedhave. Në internet ai i bëri reklamë projektit World Liberty Financial, i mbështetur nga familja e tij.\n\nNëpër mitingje, premtoi ta bënte Amerikën “superfuqinë e botës në bitcoin”. Lobistët e kriptomonedhave shpenzuan më shumë se 100 milionë dollarë për të mbështetur kandidatët e tyre të parapëlqyer gjatë zgjedhjeve të ndërmjetme për Kongresin.\n\nPërkrahja gjatë fushatës është një arsye pse investitorët e kriptomonedhave po brohorasin për kthimin e Trump në Shtëpinë e Bardhë. Ata gjithashtu shpresojnë se ndryshimi i qeverisë do të sjellë edhe zbutjen e ligjeve rregullatore ndaj kriptomonedhave.\n\nNë korrik, kur Trump iu drejtua një turme të madhe adhuruesish të kriptomonedhave, shpërthyen brohoritje të forta, kur ai premtoi të shkarkonte nga detyra Gary Gensler-in, kryetarin e Komisionit të Letrave me Vlerë (SEC). “Që tani e tutje, rregullat do të shkruhen nga njerëz që e duan industrinë tuaj”, tha ai.\n\nNë fakt, Trump nuk mund ta shkarkojë Gensler-in pa arsye para përfundimit të mandatit të tij, në vitin 2026, edhe pse është zakon që kryetarët e Komisionit të Letrave me Vlerë japin dorëheqjen kur merr detyrën një president i ri.\n\nLargimi i zotit Gensler do ta çlironte industrinë nga një armik i përsosur. Ai nuk është i bindur për meritat e kriptomonedhave dhe nuk mendon se ato do të fitojnë ndonjëherë pranueshmëri mes monedhave tradicionale. Me të drejtë, ai e ka përshkruar botën e kriptomonedhave si një fushë të mbushur me mashtrues dhe hajdutë.\n\nDhe ka hedhur në gjyq një listë të gjatë kompanish të shquara të kriptomonedhave, si Kraken dhe Coinbase (dy sisteme shkëmbimi të kriptomonedhave), Ripple (një emetues i kriptomonedhave) dhe Cumberland DRW (një ndërmjetës tregtar).\n\nKjo i ka detyruar shumë sipërmarrje të kriptomonedhave që të paguajnë tarifa të mëdha ligjore dhe të harxhojnë shumë për të arritur në një pajtim. Problemet ligjore dhe shpenzimet e mëdha kanë krijuar një re të errët mbi të ardhmen e industrisë.\n\nArmiqësia më e madhe ndaj zotit Gensler vjen ngaqë ai ka pohuar se shumë monedha dixhitale, janë në fakt letra me vlerë, rregullimi i të cilave bie nën sferën e Komisionit të Letrave me Vlerë dhe se firmat që emetojnë, tregtojnë ose i japin për shitje, duhet të jenë regjistruar në komision.\n\nEmetuesit dhe tregtarët e letrave me vlerë duhet të zbulojnë më shumë informacion te rregullatorët dhe të mundësojnë mbrojtje më të madhe për klientët, sesa do të dëshironin firmat e aseteve dixhitale.\n\nAta do të parapëlqenin që kriptomonedhat të rregulloheshin sipas një regjimi të posaçëm (dhe më të butë), ose të trajtoheshin si mallra, të cilat mbikëqyren nga Komisioni i Tregtisë së Mallrave (CFTC), që është shumë më pak i rreptë.\n\nGjatë mandatit të dytë të Donald Trump, ligjet rregullatore që rregullojnë asetet dixhitale, mund të jenë jo vetëm më të buta, por edhe më të qëndrueshme.\n\nVitet e fundit, Komisioni i Letrave me Vlerë dhe Komisioni i Tregtisë së Mallrave, janë grindur vazhdimisht mes tyre për të vendosur se cilat asete kripto duhet të jenë nën sferën e secilit.\n\nPër shembull, në të kaluarën, të dy kanë pretenduar se kanë juridiksion mbi eterin, kriptomonedhën e dytë më popullore, e cila përfundimisht ju dorëzua Komisionit të Tregtisë së Mallrave, pasi Komisioni i Letrave me Vlerë u tërhoq (bitcoin gjithashtu quhet një mall).\n\nFirmat e kriptomonedhave e kanë akuzuar zotin Gensler se po ndryshon pa pushim rregullat e komisionit për asetet dixhitale.\n\nQartësia është shpresa më e madhe për ata që shpresojnë ta zhvillojnë kriptomonedhën në një klasë asetesh të pëlqyer nga investitorët institucionalë, të cilët, në mungesë të rregullave të qëndrueshme dhe polemikave pa fund, kanë qëndruar larg kriptomonedhave.

The plan requires state-level legislation, so Albany would have to take up Adams’ proposal to get it done. The mayor projected confidence about the bill's fate and cited his close relationship with Gov. Kathy Hochul, though he’d need state lawmakers to pass it before it reaches her desk.\n\n“This is an important bill for all of us. $63 million is going to be returned back in the pockets of over 582,000 New York City residents and families,” he said. “We have great partners up there, like all the other initiatives that we push through.”\n\nThe mayor, a former state senator, has had some cool receptions in Albany, and now at least three state legislators are planning to run against him in the June primary. His rhetoric around key liberal priorities has troubled many left-leaning lawmakers.\n\nOn the issue of immigration in particular, the mayor has sounded more like Republican President-elect Donald Trump than current President Joe Biden. Adams has been known to criticize the Democratic president, while several of his recent public remarks resemble overtures to Trump — who could help him with his legal woes. The mayor has pleaded not guilty to his charges.\n\nJust this week, Adams erroneously suggested that undocumented immigrants are not entitled the right to due process under the U.S. Constitution, aligning himself with Trump.\n\n“The Constitution is for Americans,” Adams told reporters on Tuesday, drawing a contrast between criminal charges against migrants and his own criminal case. “I’m not a person that snuck into this country. My ancestors have been here for a long time.”\n\nOn Friday he tried to clarify his comments.\n\n“This is a city that's open to all, and everyone has a right to the protections of the Constitution,” he said. “Repeated criminal offenders, the small numbers who are coming here committing crimes, we need to ensure that they don't remain in our city in doing so, and our Constitution is for all of us.”\n\nIn another interview the same day, the mayor — a former Republican — did not rule out switching back to the GOP when asked.\n\n“I’m a part of the American party,” he told NY1. “I love this country.”","url":"https://gothamist.com/news/mayor-adams-presses-for-cut-to-city-income-tax-after-housing-victory","image":"https://api-prod.gothamist.com/images/348555/fill-1200x800|format-webp|webpquality-85/","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-12-06 23:30:46","author":"David Giambusso","authors":["David Giambusso"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.086},{"id":271110590,"title":"Heritage Launches $50K Ad Campaign Backing Hegseth’s Bid for Defense Chief","text":"The Heritage Foundation launched an ad campaign on Friday promoting President-elect Donald Trump’s nominee for secretary of defense, Pete Hegseth. \n\nOn Nov. 21, The Heritage Foundation and Heritage Action for America announced the launch of a $1 million campaign advocating for prompt Senate confirmation of Trump’s Cabinet nominees. Of that, $50,000 will go toward bolstering Hegseth’s nomination.\n\nThe conservative think tank will use the funding to hit 785,00 impressions over the course of the next week, a spokeswoman told The Daily Signal. The ad will be placed on platforms such as Hulu, Roku, Max, YouTube TV, and local news stations.\n\nHeritage also plans to send three text messages on behalf of Hegseth’s military record to targeted audiences throughout the week.\n\n“President Trump’s nomination of Pete Hegseth as secretary of defense has brought out the worst in the mainstream media and the radical Left,” Mary Vought, Heritage’s vice president of strategic communications, told The Daily Signal. “This is the first of many anticipated attacks on President Trump’s Cabinet nominees.”\n\n“Heritage is committed to educating the American people on the need for a fair confirmation process,” she continued. “These smears and accusations are nothing but a distraction from his solid military record and his commitment to the American people and our national security.”\n\nTrump announced Hegseth—whose military career included deployment to Iraq and Afghanistan and the awarding of two Bronze Stars—as his pick for secretary of defense on Nov. 12.\n\nFollowing the announcement of Hegseth’s nomination, reports of a sexual assault allegation surfaced, along with other outlets claiming the former Fox News host had abused alcohol. \n\nThe New York Times published on Nov. 29 a leaked 2018 email from Hegseth’s mother, criticizing her son for allegedly mistreating women. \n\nOn Wednesday, however, Penelope Hegseth told Fox News host Steve Doocy she wrote the message in the heat of the moment—and apologized to her son two hours later in a second email that hadn’t been leaked, The New York Post reported. She blasted The New York Times as “despicable.”\n\nHegseth told SiriusXM host Megyn Kelly on Wednesday that he thinks he’s the target of a “smear” campaign comparable to that of the Senate confirmation hearings for now-Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh.\n\n“I had a member [of Congress], not 45 minutes ago, look me in the eye in private, just he and I, and say, ‘That’s what they’re trying to do to you,’” Hegseth said. “‘That’s their playbook. Get ready for more, and they’re going to make it up, just like they have so far. All anonymous, all innuendo, all rumor, nothing sourced, no verification, and they’re just going to keep doing it, because you’re a threat to them. You’re a threat to their system. You’re a threat to all the things in Washington D.C., the swamp, the things that people have rejected. You’re a threat to that, and so they’re coming after you.’”\n\nSen. Joni Ernst, R-Iowa, who has been reported as being ambivalent at best about the Hegseth nomination, posted late Friday afternoon on X that she and the nominee “will continue our constructive conversations as we move forward together in this process,” adding: “We plan to meet again next week. At a minimum, we agree that he deserves the opportunity to lay out his vision for our warfighters at a fair hearing.”","summary":"The Heritage Foundation launched an ad campaign on Friday promoting President-elect Donald Trump&#8217;s nominee for secretary of defense, Pete Hegseth.

One of the first orders of business in the Senate will be the adoption of rules under which the Senate will operate for the next two years.\n\nOne of the proposed changes that will be debated is an attempt by the Republican minority to make it more difficult for the Senate to conduct late-night sessions. The makeup of the new Senate will consist of 36 Democrats and four Republicans.\n\nUnder current rules, a two-thirds roll call vote is required for the Senate to conduct its session beyond 8 p.m. A separate two-thirds roll call vote is required for the Senate to continue beyond midnight.\n\nFor the 2023-2024 session, the Republicans proposed two changes to those rules. The first would require a separate two-thirds vote for the session to continue after 10 p.m. and go until midnight. The second would require a unanimous vote for the Senate to meet beyond midnight.\n\n“I voted in favor of these amendments as a check on how the Senate operates beyond normal business hours,” said Sen. Ryan Fattman, R-Sutton. “It’s important that these [changes take place] … going into the next legislative session, in order to discourage the habit of debating and passing legislation under the cover of darkness and bring more transparency to the legislative process.” \n\n“The Senate rejected a couple of rule changes in order to justify more secrecy,” said Paul Craney, a spokesperson for the Massachusetts Fiscal Alliance. “It’s a tremendous disservice to the taxpayers and their constituents. The Senate should not be meeting in the very late or early morning hours to conduct their official business. Unfortunately, in Massachusetts, the legislative process is very broken.” \n\n Opponents of the two new rules say the current Senate rules are sufficient.\n\n“On rare occasions to complete critical work such as lowering housing costs or reforming the prescription drug industry, the Senate meets beyond regular business hours and into the evening,” said a spokesperson for Senate President Karen Spilka, D-Ashland. “Under the Senate rules approved by members for the [2023-2024 session], two-thirds of the members must vote in order to continue a session beyond 8 p.m. and two-thirds must also vote in order to continue beyond midnight.”\n\nThe Senate, 4-34, rejected an amendment that would require a two-thirds vote for the Senate to continue any session beyond 10 p.m. and continue the session until midnight. This would be in addition to a current Senate rule that requires a two-thirds vote to continue a session beyond 8 p.m. and a two-thirds vote to continue a session beyond midnight.\n\nAmendment supporters said requiring the two-thirds vote will ensure that late-night sessions between 10 p.m. and midnight, when legislators are tired and many citizens are already sleeping, do not become the norm but are allowed only when a vast majority of senators favor it.\n\nAmendment opponents said the current rules requiring a two-thirds vote to go beyond 8 p.m. and another two-thirds vote to go beyond midnight are sufficient and argued there is no need to add another layer.\n\nA “No” vote is against requiring a two-thirds vote to go beyond 10 p.m. and continue until midnight. \n\nSen. Joanne Comerford — No \n\nSen. Paul Mark — No \n\nThe Senate, 4-34, rejected an amendment that would require a unanimous vote for the Senate to continue any session beyond midnight. Current rules require a two-thirds vote to go beyond midnight.\n\nAmendment supporters said sessions after midnight, when taxpayers are sleeping and some members are barely awake, are irresponsible and should only be held if 100% of the senators agree there is a major emergency.\n\nAmendment opponents said going beyond midnight is only done when there is an emergency. They said it is often impossible to get a unanimous vote on anything and argued it is not wise to give a single member the power to essentially adjourn the Senate.\n\nA “No” vote is against requiring a unanimous vote to go beyond midnight. \n\nSen. Joanne Comerford — No \n\nSen. Paul Mark — No \n\nA trio of legislators announced they plan to co-sponsor legislation aimed at eventually ending the sale of all nicotine and tobacco products in Massachusetts. Sen. Jason Lewis, D-Winchester, and Reps. Tommy Vitolo, D-Brookline, and Kate Lipper-Garabedian, D-Melrose, said they will file the bill for consideration in the 2025-2026 legislative session.\n\nThe proposal will not take away the right to purchase nicotine and tobacco products from anyone who is already legally able to do so. Instead, the measure would prohibit people under 21 who are not currently old enough to legally purchase nicotine and tobacco products, from ever being lawfully able to purchase these products in Massachusetts.\n\n“We all know the devastating health effects of nicotine and tobacco products, especially on our youth who are targeted by Big Tobacco,” Lewis said. “This bill will save countless lives and create a healthier world for the next generation.” \n\n“This legislation treats everyone fairly,” Vitolo said. “Those who are not old enough now to obtain nicotine products will never be old enough to buy them in Massachusetts. Those who are old enough today will always be old enough. This problem is going to take a generation to solve, and with this legislation we can solve it, one day at a time.” \n\n“We already have laws that prevent tobacco retailers from selling to anyone under 21 — and they check IDs diligently,” responded Peter Brennan, executive director of the New England Convenience Store and Energy Marketers Association. “The current system works. Prohibiting adults from purchasing legal tobacco products in a regulated environment such as local stores is a misguided infringement on adults’ rights and will do nothing to address youth tobacco use.” \n\nAttorney General Andrea Campbell announced that her office has issued citations totaling more than $2 million against Northeast Foods LLC, a company that operates dozens of Burger King franchise locations across the state, for violating various state employment laws, including child labor laws. The citations include restitution for unpaid wages and penalties.\n\nCampbell alleges the operator violated Massachusetts’ child labor laws between January 2022 and March 2023 when it scheduled minors for work during legally prohibited hours and in excess of the state’s limit of nine daily working hours for workers that are 16 and 17 years old. She also alleges that the Burger King franchise operator failed to pay minimum wage and make timely payments to workers, and in some instances, failed to pay any wages to workers.\n\n“Our workplace laws exist to provide crucial rights and protections to our workforce,” Campbell said. “My office will continue to enforce these laws to protect and empower workers, including young workers who contribute to their communities and gain new skills and experiences.” \n\nState Auditor Diana DiZoglio released the results of an audit of the Department of Early Education and Care (EEC), reviewing the period from Jan. 1, 2021 to Dec. 31, 2022.\n\nEEC, which licenses approximately 9,000 child care-related programs that support an average of 55,000 children daily, has responsibilities including providing financial assistance for child care services to low-income families, providing parenting support to families, and providing professional development opportunities to employees in the field of early education and care.\n\nThe audit’s findings include charges that EEC did not conduct licensing visits to residential programs within the required time frames. The report noted that EEC cannot ensure that its residential programs operate within safe and healthy environments if it does not complete licensing visits within the required period.\n\nThe report also alleges that EEC did not review or initiate investigations of all reports of suspected child abuse and neglect in its licensed programs and failed to conduct all required background record checks for employees of its licensed residential programs.\n\n“Our Early Education and Care audit has identified serious issues that put children at risk,” DiZoglio said. “These concerns must be immediately addressed so children are protected. We urge the administration to respond with the urgency that this matter requires and look forward to our post-audit review in six months to track progress on our recommendations.” \n\nGov. Maura Healey announced that the state has awarded $3.8 million in state and federal funds to support state, local and nonprofit agencies working to combat intimate partner violence, sexual assault, human trafficking and stalking.\n\n“This grant funding reaffirms our deep commitment to ensuring a future where every individual can live with dignity, respect and without fear of abuse,” Healey said. “By investing in programs that support healing and justice, these grants will provide essential resources for survivors of domestic and sexual violence, human trafficking and stalking. Professionals across sectors will be empowered to deliver trauma-informed, accessible services to help survivors rebuild and thrive.” \n\n “Safe, reliable access to services is vital for survivors of sexual and domestic violence,” said Public Safety and Security Secretary Terrence Reidy. “By fostering strong partnerships among prosecutors, law enforcement and service providers, we create a network of life-saving support that reaches those who need it most. With these grants, state, local and nonprofit agencies are empowered to deliver critical interventions and services that help survivors on their path to healing and recovery.” \n\nThe Governor’s Council certified the results of the election of Massachusetts’ 11 electors for the offices of U.S. president and vice president. All 50 states have to certify their votes in the federal election and send them to Congress to be counted before the Electoral College gathers on Dec. 17 to cast their state’s electoral votes to make President-elect Donald Trump’s victory official.\n\nPreliminary results show Harris received more than 61% of the Massachusetts vote and Trump won 36.5%. Secretary of State William Galvin’s office announced that 3,512,866 Massachusetts voters participated in the Nov. 5 election, representing the second-highest number of ballots cast in Massachusetts history, just behind the 3,657,972 ballots cast in 2020.\n\n“I … want to commend the Secretary of State’s Office for their continued perfect administration of elections here in the commonwealth,” Healey said. “We thank you for your work in this election and all elections.” \n\n“The turnout in Massachusetts appears to reflect a national trend, with a significant drop in participation in several of our cities, especially those with larger minority populations, and a slightly smaller rise in turnout in the more rural and suburban areas of the state,” Galvin said.","url":"https://recorder.com/Beacon-Hill-Roll-Call-Nov-25-to-Nov-29-2024-58262454","image":"https://recorder.com//attachments/23/47490123.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-12-06 23:28:48","author":"Bob Katzen","authors":["Bob Katzen"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.038},{"id":271102342,"title":"Former top DHS lawyer assisting Bondi with DOJ transition - Live Updates - POLITICO","text":"As Pam Bondi prepares for confirmation as attorney general, she is working with a top lawyer from President-elect Donald Trump’s first term: Chad Mizelle, formerly acting general counsel at the Department of Homeland Security. Mizelle has been in meetings with Bondi in Florida as she prepares to lead the Justice Department, according to a person with knowledge of the preparations. At the beginning of Trump’s first term, he was counsel to Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein. Then, after a White House stint, he became a senior official at DHS. As the acting general counsel, he helped craft and defend Trump’s border security and deportation initiatives. Mizelle is a longtime ally of Stephen Miller, Trump’s hawkish immigration adviser who has long pushed for dramatically heightened immigration enforcement. Trump announced last month that Miller will serve as deputy chief of staff for policy in his incoming White House. The Justice Department will be instrumental in Trump’s effort to deliver on his promise of mass deportation. It houses the nation’s heavily backlogged immigration courts, which adjudicate immigrants’ appeals to stay in the country. And a significant portion of its criminal cases involve immigration-related crimes. In 2017, during Mizelle’s time at DOJ, then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions directed federal prosecutors to prioritize cases that could deter illegal immigration. The percentage of defendants charged with immigration crimes surged — cresting at more than one-third of defendants, according to the Congressional Research Service. Mizelle is general counsel for Affinity Partners, the investment firm helmed by Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner. And like Bondi, he has Florida roots: Kathryn Kimball Mizelle, his wife, is a Trump-appointed federal judge in Tampa.","url":"https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2024/12/06/congress/bondis-transition-team-00193071","image":"https://www.politico.com/dims4/default/f239159/2147483647/resize/1200x/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.politico.com%2F76%2F6c%2F1d0c0f4c4705a928338f06dc38be%2Fu-s-congress-23504.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-12-06 23:24:46","author":"Betsy Woodruff Swan","authors":["Betsy Woodruff Swan"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.013},{"id":271102996,"title":"Donald Trump is clearly trying to shake things up at NASA","text":"President-elect Donald Trump has made a bold choice for NASA's new leader.Trump announced in a Truth Social post on Wednesday that his choice for NASA Administrator is Jared Isaacman — a CEO, fighter-jet pilot, and two-time SpaceX astronaut.Isaacman is not exactly a traditional pick. For one, he would be the first billionaire to lead the agency. More importantly, though, he's on the cutting edge of the new commercial space age, where private companies are becoming the biggest actors in space.Some past NASA administrators were former NASA astronauts. Others were former executives from the aerospace industry. Many were politicians — including Trump's last NASA chief, Jim Bridenstine, and the current administrator, Bill Nelson.Isaacman is none of those things. He has, however, flown to space in a Crew Dragon spaceship, conducted the first-ever commercial spacewalk in a brand-new SpaceX spacesuit, and plans to fly on future missions with the company — aboard its Starship mega-rocket, no less.The nomination, which still has to be confirmed by the Senate, suggests that Trump wants to shake things up at NASA.\"He certainly has the potential to be a disruptor,\" Leroy Chiao, a former NASA astronaut and International Space Station commander who now works in consulting, told Business Insider. \"I think it's a great pick. It's much better than just status quo — another retiring member of Congress.\"It's also another signal that Trump might make a big push to put the next humans on the moon, and even the first humans on Mars.Isaacman's enthusiasm for space exploration isn't his only bona fide. He also has a businessman's mindset and a close relationship with Elon Musk. The two share the goal of getting humans to Mars.Chiao hopes Isaacman can speed up the process.Indeed, in a post on X accepting the nomination, Isaacman wrote that NASA would help make humanity \"a true spacefaring civilization.\"\"Americans will walk on the Moon and Mars and in doing so, we will make life better here on Earth,\" he added.NASA is already working on it. The Artemis program began as the last Trump administration's iteration of a multi-president effort to send humans to deep space again. Artemis aims to send astronauts back to the moon for the first time in over 50 years, and eventually to use the moon as a jumping-off point to send people to Mars.However, Artemis is years behind schedule and billions over budget, largely due to technical and programmatic challenges with the giant Space Launch System that NASA is building for moon missions. Many industry commentators see SLS as a waste of government funds, when NASA could instead lean on commercial heavy-lift rockets like Starship.\"Frankly, we have been at the status quo of this exploration program in one form or another over the last several presidents since 2004,\" Chiao said, \"and we're not even close to launching the first astronaut on a new vehicle.\"In fact, NASA just pushed back the launch date for its first crewed Artemis mission, set to fly around the moon using SLS. On Thursday the agency delayed the mission by another seven months, to April 2026, citing issues with the system's Orion spaceship.That's the slow-moving status quo that Trump might aim to shake up.To that end, efficiency may be a top priority for Isaacman. That could mean reassessing Artemis entirely or cutting back some of NASA's centers and facilities nationwide, according to Abhi Tripathi, a former NASA engineer and SpaceX mission director who now leads mission operations at the UC Berkeley Space Sciences Lab.\"I definitely think SLS will be on the chopping board,\" Tripathi told BI.First, though, Isaacman will have to go through Congress.\"He is going to ruffle a lot of feathers,\" Chiao said.Congress can be a formidable wall for anyone trying to revolutionize NASA.In places like Alabama and Southern California, a status quo NASA fuels the work of legacy aerospace contractors like Boeing and Northrop Grumman.\"The majority of members of Congress want jobs in their district, and they look at the space program primarily through that lens,\" Tripathi said.Plus, he added, \"the lobbying arms of all of those big contractors will be basically camped outside their congressional representative's office, asking them to thwart any big plans that would change the status quo greatly.\"It'll all come to a head when the Trump White House makes its budget proposal. That's when Congress will approve or deny any cuts or reprioritizations that Trump and his NASA Administrator try to make.If Trump wants to put boots on Mars fast, he'll have to convince individual Congress members to push those changes through.\"I think Jared is a very smart and capable individual,\" Tripathi said, \"but his ability to wield power will completely depend upon how much his president will back him up.\"","summary":"Billionaire CEO and SpaceX astronaut Jared Isaacman is not a traditional pick for NASA chief.

Elon Musk and Ramaswamy have repeatedly said they would seek to roll back telework usage at federal agencies, if not end it entirely, and have suggested the move as a tool to shed federal jobs.“Thousands of federal employees just landed a work from home deal ahead of [President-elect Trump] taking office,” said House Oversight and Accountability Committee Chairman James Comer, R-Ky., on X.“These midnight-hour maneuvers by the Biden administration are illegitimate and will be scrutinized,” Ramaswamy posted on Twitter. “All new proclamations made by executive fiat can be reversed by executive fiat.”\n\nOutside of some finding of malfeasance that could lead to a court voiding it, the Trump administration is stuck with this stinker of a deal. It was just the kind of chicken-poo move that wouldn't surprise anyone who lived through O'Malley's two terms in Maryland's statehouse. \n\nThis points to two major problems in the federal workforce. First, the idea that a union should represent federal employees is ridiculous. The whole thing is a gift. That's a subject for a different day. The second problem is that telework and its abuse are the norm, and there is no doubt it cheats taxpayers out of money and services.\n\nA new report by Iowa Senator Jode Ernst details just how the system is abused.\n\nA paltry 6% of the federal workforce “report in-person on a full-time basis” while almost one-third of federal workers are remote on a full-time basis, in a sharp turn-around from the pre-pandemic era in which only 3% teleworked daily, a report from Sen. Joni Ernst’s office found.Ernst (R-Iowa), who has long crusaded against the rise in remote federal work, is planning to reveal the fruits of her office’s year and a half inquiry to Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) co-heads Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy during their visit to the Capitol Thursday.\n\nWhile the reporter for GovExec claims SSA has a \"1.3%\" telework rate, in terms of numbers, that would mean only 780 people of SSA's 60,000 employees work from home. If that was the case, then it hardly seems like something that AFGE would make a big deal about. The truth is probably much worse. Ernst's investigation found a space utilization rate of just 7% at the SSA headquarters campus; see page 3. The union claimed that word-from-home was all that was holding back a cascade of resignations and retirements.\n\n“It is well documented that changing our [telework] levels would accelerate an ongoing staffing crisis,” the union wrote. “More than a quarter of employees are retirement-eligible and 60% say they will seek other jobs if telework ends. Eliminating telework while the agency is already at a 50-year staffing low threatens Social Security operations nationwide, which would harm vulnerable Americans. Arbitrarily removing a highly effective telework program would be an intentionally fatal strategy for the Social Security Administration.”\n\nI'm just a dumb-sh** infantryman from Southside Virginia, but that sounds like a helluva lot more people than approximately 728. \n\nThere are several areas of waste, fraud, and abuse at work here. The one most overlooked is the cost of leasing and operating massive buildings that only have, on average, a 12% utilization rate. And then there is flagrant abuse of a privilege.\n\nIn short, between lost productivity, overcapacity of office space, overstaffing, and outright fraud, telework costs billions of dollars each year while providing little beyond a cushy lifestyle for some federal employees.\n\nPresident Trump has sworn to crack down on this.\n\n“When Donald Trump is inaugurated on Jan. 20 and that new golden age of America begins, he’s going to tell the federal workers of this country who your viewers pay for to get back into the office and do their jobs or find another line of work,” Miller told Fox News’s Jesse Watters during an interview.\n\nHe should.

But doubts have emerged about future easing, especially as investors also looked to inflationary policies under President-elect Donald Trump.\r\n\r\n Positive corporate earnings continue \r\n\r\nOn the corporate side, a number of companies released quarterly earnings that were well received on Wall Street.\r\n\r\nUlta Beauty (NASDAQ:ULTA) stock rose 13% after the cosmetics retailer raised its annual profit forecast, signaling a revival in demand for perfumes and makeup during the holiday shopping season.\r\n\r\nLululemon Athletica (NASDAQ:LULU) stock climbed 16% after the sportswear maker increased its full-year forecasts, betting on resilient demand for its athletic wear in the U.S. during the holiday shopping season and continued strength in its international business.\r\n\r\nGitlab (NASDAQ:GTLB) stock rose 6% after the software company reported fiscal third-quarter results and guidance that topped expectations and announced a new CEO.\r\n\r\nDocuSign (NASDAQ:DOCU) stock climbed over 20% after the electronic signature company raised its 2025 revenue forecast, after a strong third-quarter earnings report.\r\n\r\n Brent on course for weekly loss \r\n\r\nOil prices slipped lower Friday, with the global benchmark Brent on course for substantial weekly losses on concerns of slowing demand after OPEC+ extended its current run of supply cuts until well into 2025.\r\n\r\nBy 09:50 ET, the US crude futures (WTI) dropped 1.3% to $67.42 a barrel, while the Brent contract fell 1.2% to $71.24 a barrel.\r\n\r\nFor the week, Brent was on track to drop around 1.5%, while WTI hung on to marginal gains.\r\n\r\nThe Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies, a group known as OPEC+, delayed the start of its oil output increases by three months until April and extended the full unwinding of cuts by a year until the end of 2026.","url":"https://news.az/news/us-stocks-rise-after-payrolls-grow-dec-rate-cut-still-likely","image":"https://news.az/photos/2024/12/1733508935.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-12-06 23:21:46","author":null,"language":"en","source_country":"az","sentiment":-0.089},{"id":271101884,"title":"US appeals court upholds TikTok law forcing its sale","text":"A U.S. federal appeals court on Friday upheld a law requiring Chinese-based ByteDance to divest its popular short video app TikTok in the United States by early next year or face a ban, News.az reports citing Reuters.\r\n\r\nThe decision is a win for the Justice Department and opponents of the Chinese-owned app and a devastating blow to ByteDance. The ruling now increases the possibility of an unprecedented ban in just six weeks on a social media app used by 170 million Americans.\r\n\r\nThe ruling is expected to be appealed to the Supreme Court.\r\n\r\nFree speech advocates immediately criticized the decision. The American Civil \r\n\r\nLiberties Union said it sets a flawed and dangerous precedent.\r\n\r\nBanning TikTok blatantly violates the First Amendment rights of millions of Americans who use this app to express themselves and communicate with people around the world,” said Patrick Toomey, deputy director of the ACLU's National Security Project.\r\n\r\nBut the appeals court said the law “was the culmination of extensive, bipartisan action by the Congress and by successive presidents. It was carefully crafted to deal only with control by a foreign adversary, and it was part of a broader effort to counter a well-substantiated national security threat posed by the PRC (People's Republic of China).\r\n\r\nU.S. appeals court Judges Sri Srinivasan, Neomi Rao and Douglas Ginsburg considered the legal challenges brought by TikTok and users against the law that gives ByteDance until Jan. 19 to sell or divest TikTok's U.S. assets or face a ban.\r\n\r\nThe decision -- unless the Supreme Court reverses it -- puts TikTok's fate in the hands of first President JoeBiden on whether to grant a 90-day extension of the Jan. 19 deadline to force a sale and then President-elect Donald Trump, who takes office on Jan. 20. But it's not clear whether ByteDance could meet the heavy burden to show it had made significant progress toward a divestiture needed to trigger the extension.\r\n\r\nTrump, who unsuccessfully tried to ban TikTok during his first term in 2020, said before the November presidential election he would not allow the TikTok ban.\r\n\r\nTikTok said it expected the Supreme Court would reverse the appeals court decision on First Amendment grounds.\r\n\r\nThe Supreme Court has an established historical record of protecting Americans' right to free speech, and we expect they will do just that on this important constitutional issue, TikTok said in a statement, adding the law will result in outright censorship of the American people.\r\n\r\nThe Justice Department did not have an immediate comment on the decision.\r\n\r\nThe decision upholds the law giving the U.S. government sweeping powers to ban other foreign-owned apps that could raise concerns about collection of Americans' data. In 2020, Trump also tried to ban Tencent-owned WeChat, but was blocked by the courts.\r\n\r\nShares of Meta Platforms (META.O), opens new tab, which competes against TikTok in online ads, hit an intraday record high following the ruling, last up over 3%. Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL.O), opens new tab, whose YouTube video platform also competes with TikTok, was up over 1% following the ruling.","url":"https://news.az/news/us-appeals-court-upholds-tiktok-law-forcing-its-sale","image":"https://news.az/photos/2024/12/1733509130.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-12-06 23:21:46","author":null,"language":"en","source_country":"az","sentiment":-0.063},{"id":271101876,"title":"Yellen warns against weakening financial risk watchdog","text":"U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen on Friday warned it was crucial that a panel charged with monitoring financial risks be able to continue its work as worries grow President-elect Donald Trump's administration will again weaken the body, News.az reports citing Reuters.\r\n\r\nSpeaking at Friday's Financial Stability Oversight Council (FSOC) meeting, the last of President Joe Biden's administration, Yellen said that under Trump's first term the panel's staff shrank to single digits and the infrastructure supporting interagency coordination was significantly scaled back.\r\n\r\nThis meant we were less equipped to identify and respond to risks to the financial system, she said, adding the Democratic Biden administration reinvested in the panel, which was created following the 2007-2009 crisis to monitor systemic risks.\r\n\r\nThis strengthened Council has delivered, helping make our financial system more resilient and our economy stronger. It is crucial that it continue to do so for the benefit of the American people, she said in prepared remarks.\r\n\r\nTrump has not laid out a vision for the financial regulators, but he has pledged to slash burdensome regulations.\r\n\r\nYellen's remarks came as the FSOC warned again in its annual report about potential risks posed by commercial real estate, private credit, and cryptocurrencies, and called on regulators and companies to be vigilant in monitoring vulnerabilities.\r\n\r\nWhile the 2024 report echoes risks flagged in prior reports, it warns they have evolved in consequential ways.\r\n\r\nThe group said there are signs of increasing commercial real estate risk, particularly in the office sector in large urban areas. Rises in office vacancies, slow rent growth, and higher borrowing costs were pressuring borrowers, leading to higher delinquencies and more provision expenses by banks.\r\n\r\nOn cryptocurrencies, the group warned that stablecoins could pose a risk to financial stability, and reiterated calls for legislation creating a comprehensive regulatory framework for the digital currency product. The group said that most other crypto firms and issuers either violate existing financial rules or operate outside their boundaries, creating heightened risks for significant fraud and manipulation. The group called for legislation giving federal regulators explicit authority to police spot crypto markets, similar to its 2023 recommendation.\r\n\r\nThe group also warned that while there has yet to be a major cybersecurity incident at a large financial institution, the issue is top of mind for regulators and industry with cyberattacks having nearly doubled since the COVID-19 pandemic.","url":"https://news.az/news/yellen-warns-against-weakening-financial-risk-watchdog","image":"https://news.az/photos/2024/12/1733509535.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-12-06 23:21:46","author":null,"language":"en","source_country":"az","sentiment":-0.221},{"id":271102154,"title":"Missing US Journalist Austin Tice Still Alive in Syria, Family Says","text":"An American journalist who has been missing in Syria for over a decade is still alive, according to his family.The mother of Austin Tice said at a news conference in Washington, D.C., on Friday that she was confident her son was alive based on information she said had come from a \"significant source.\" She did not identify the source but said they had been vetted by the U.S. government and treated as credible.\"He is being cared for and he is well—we do know that,\" Debra Tice told reporters following a White House meeting with national security officials.The meeting comes as Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's forces clash with insurgent fighters who seized the northern city of Aleppo on Saturday.\"The news we're hearing from the Middle East is the kind of thing that can unsettle a mom,\" Debra Tice said, later adding, \"When I think about war, I never have a happy moment.\"Who Is Austin Tice?Tice is a journalist from Houston whose work had been published by The Washington Post, McClatchy newspapers and other outlets.

He suggested in a Wall Street Journal op ed in 2020 that only up to 40,000 Americans would be killed by the pandemic. More than 1.2 million people died.\n\nWhile he hasn’t yet established how to measure academic freedom, he has been looking at the Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression and the nonprofit’s scoring of universities and their rankings based on freedom of speech. \n\nThe nonprofit bases its rankings on surveys of students’ views on whether they feel comfortable sharing ideas, with schools being negatively scored if their administrators punish faculty for opinions, or if they withdraw an invitation to a speaker following a possible controversy. \n\nSome of the schools that receive NIH grants but have bad rankings, according to the nonprofit, include the University of Pennsylvania, Columbia University, and the University of Southern California, The Journal noted. \n\nThose at the top of the rankings include the University of Virginia, Michigan Technological University, and Florida State University.\n\nBhattacharya also has plans to fund studies that recreate the work of other scientists in an attempt to take on scientific fraud. There are also plans to create a scientific journal to publish studies with comments by named reviewers, to urge a more open discussion. \n\nHe has also suggested limiting the amount of grant money that pays for publication in journals, and he would look eastablish a pause on research which creates new viruses for study purposes. \n\nIn addition, Bhattacharya has a goal of enacting term limits for those in charge of the research institutes run by NIH. He would would review a congressional Republican proposal to slash the number of institutes and centers from 27 to 15, those with a view into his thinking told The Journal. \n\nLizbet Boroughs, associate vice president of the Association of American Universities, told The Journal: “It’s not clear why we’d roadblock the best chances of finding a cure for cystic fibrosis or cancer or Alzheimer’s by adding potentially political, nonresearch factors into medical-research grant decisions.”\n\nFormer director of the National Cancer Institute Ned Sharpless told the paper that Bhattacharya might find it hard to implement his changes. While he could change the rubric used to review grant applications, it may be difficult to get grant reviewers to follow his guidelines, Sharpless told the newspaper. \n\n“It’s much more complicated than it appears from the outside,” he said of the top job at NIH. \n\nAs many as 174 scientists on the NIH staff or who have received its funding have won a Nobel Prize, The Journal noted. \n\nNIH doles out as much as $25 billion in grants each year, which have led to major advances, including immunotherapy cancer treatments.","summary":"Trump’s nominee to head the National Institutes of Health, Dr. Jay Bhattacharya, wants to target so-called ‘cancel culture’ at top universities","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/donald-trump-research-grants-woke-b2660318.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2024/12/06/17/2185037776.jpg?width=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/45Gw5Tvj-4VHSaSK0.mp4","publish_date":"2024-12-06 23:15:17","author":"Gustaf Kilander","authors":["Gustaf Kilander"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":0.068},{"id":271101342,"title":"Taylor Swift May Get Early Christmas Gift From Aileen Cannon","text":"Florida Judge Aileen Cannon could dismiss a copyright lawsuit against Taylor Swift before Christmas because the plaintiff has been unable to serve the singer.Kimberly Marasco, a Florida artist, is seeking more than $7 million in damages, alleging that Swift's songs and music videos have \"creative elements\" that copy Marasco's work without permission or credit. Marasco's complaint mentions several songs and videos from Swift's albums Lover, Folklore, Midnights and The Tortured Poets Department.Seven months after the suit was filed, Cannon, who became a household name during former President Donald Trump's classified documents case, is weighing dismissing it because Marasco hasn't properly served the singer. Marasco has asked Cannon for permission to bypass the usual means of serving someone and an extension to the deadline to do so.Swift's lawyers, Aaron S. Blynn and Katherine Wright Morrone, are asking Cannon to dismiss the case, something she declined to do in August and September.Blynn and Wright Morrone argued that Marasco does not have legal standing to apply for an extension to serve the singer. The court uses the \"good cause\" standard when evaluating whether an extension should be granted. Good cause is a legally sufficient reason for a judge's decision. Legal precedent has further defined good cause as \"factors outside a plaintiff's control, such as sudden illness, natural catastrophe or evasion of service of process.\"The lawyers argued that Marasco \"failed to satisfy her burden to demonstrate good cause.\"\"None of the excuses Plaintiff includes in her Response change this conclusion,\" Blynn and Wright Morrone said.Marasco cited \"factors beyond her control\" in her request for an extension to the deadline for serving Swift. Blynn and Wright Morrone countered that Marasco did not identify any \"factors beyond her control\" that satisfy the legal precedent.The lawyers argued that the court \"sets a high bar\" in establishing good cause and \"excuses that merely amount to neglect, lack of diligence, ignorance of the rules, inadvertences, or mistake are simply not enough.\"Blynn and Wright Morrone said Marasco has sought alternative methods multiple times to \"avoid the implications\" of failing to serve Swift.\"Nothing has changed since this Court last denied Plaintiff's requests.
