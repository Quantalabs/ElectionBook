Here’s What a New Poll Says","text":"Taylor Swift’s endorsement of Kamala Harris has not affected voter’s opinion on the 2024 presidential election, a new poll says. Per a new ABC News/Ipsos poll posted by The Hill, 81 percent of voters surveyed said Swift’s support for Vice President Harris will not influence how they vote. Only six percent said they are more likely to vote for Harris since Swift’s post, and 13 percent said it makes them less likely to do so. Swift took to social media last week to voice her support for the Harris campaign. Swift expressed her admiration for Harris, calling her a “steady-handed, gifted leader” and a “warrior” for causes including LGBTQ+ rights and women’s reproductive freedoms. She also called out Donald Trump for posting fake AI images that had falsely suggested she supported him. “It really conjured up my fears around AI, and the dangers of spreading misinformation,” she said about the doctored images. “It brought me to the conclusion that I need to be very transparent about my actual plans for this election as a voter. The simplest way to combat misinformation is with the truth.” Swift signed her Instagram post as “Childless Cat Lady,” aimed at Trump’s VP candidate JD Vance, who used that description to demean Democratic leaders without children.","summary":"A new poll shows if Taylor Swift’s endorsement of Kamala Harris has affected voter’s opinion on the 2024 presidential election.","url":"https://www.billboard.com/music/music-news/taylor-swift-kamala-harris-endorsement-impact-voters-a-new-poll-says-1235777093/","image":"https://www.billboard.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/taylor-swift-eras-tour-wembley-8-15-2024-billboard-gp2-espanol-1548.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-17 00:36:35","author":"Rania Aniftos","authors":["Rania Aniftos"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.081},{"id":256565244,"title":"Media AS namakan suspek dalam percubaan membunuh Trump","text":"WASHINGTON, 16 SEPT – Media Amerika Syarikat (AS) menamakan Ryan Wesley Routh, yang pernah ditemu bual AFP di Kyiv pada 2022 di mana dia menyokong usaha perang di sana, sebagai suspek dalam percubaan membunuh Donald Trump.

In a more than two-hour appearance before a panel of three judges at a federal appeals court in Washington, attorneys for the two sides – and content creators – were pressed on their best arguments for and against the law that forces the two companies to break ties by mid-January or lose one of their biggest markets in the world. Andrew Pincus, a veteran attorney representing TikTok and its parent company Bytedance, argued in court that the law unfairly targets the company and runs afoul of the First Amendment because TikTok Inc. – the U.S. arm of TikTok – is an American entity. After his remarks, another attorney representing content creators who are also challenging the law argued it violates the rights of U.S. speakers and is akin to prohibiting Americans from publishing on foreign-owned media outlets, such as Politico, Al Jazeera or Spotify. “The law before this court is unprecedented, and its effect would be staggering,” Pincus said, adding the act would impose speech limitations based on future risks. The measure, signed by President Biden in April, was the culmination of a yearslong saga in Washington over the short-form video-sharing app, which the government sees as a national security threat due to its connections to China. The U.S. has said it’s concerned about TikTok collecting vast swaths of user data, including sensitive information on viewing habits, that could fall into the hands of the Chinese government through coercion. Officials have also warned the proprietary algorithm that fuels what users see on the app is vulnerable to manipulation by Chinese authorities, who can use it to shape content on the platform in a way that’s difficult to detect. Daniel Tenny, an attorney for the Justice Department, acknowledged in court that data collection is useful for many companies for commercial purposes, such as target advertisements or tailoring videos to users’ interests. “The problem is that same data is extremely valuable to a foreign adversary trying to compromise the security of the United States,” he said. Pincus, the attorney for TikTok, said Congress should have erred on the side of disclosing any potential propaganda on the platform instead of pursuing a divesture-or-ban approach, which the two companies have maintained will only lead to a ban. He also said statements from lawmakers before the law was passed shows they were motivated by the propaganda they perceived to be on TikTok, namely an imbalance between pro-Palestinian and pro-Israel content on the platform during the war in Gaza. But the panel – composed of two judges appointed by Republicans and one appointed by a Democrat – expressed some skepticism, pressing the attorneys on TikTok’s side if they believe the government has any leeway to curtail an influential media company controlled by a foreign entity in an adversarial nation. In parts of their questions about TikTok’s foreign ownership, the judges asked if the arguments presented would apply in cases where the U.S. is engaged in war. Judge Neomi Rao, who was appointed by former President Donald Trump, said the creators suing over the law could continue speaking on TikTok if the company is sold or if they choose to post content on other platforms. But Jeffrey Fisher, their attorney, argued there are not “interchangeable mediums” for them because TikTok – which has 170 million U.S. users – is unique in its look and feel and in the types of audiences it allows creators to reach. Paul Tran, one of the content creators who is suing the government, told reporters outside the courthouse Monday that a skincare company he and his wife founded in 2018 was struggling until they started making TikTok videos three years ago. He said they had tried to market their products through traditional advertising and other social media apps. But the TikTok videos were the only thing that drove views, helping them get enough orders to sell out of products and even appear on TV shows. “TikTok truly invigorated our company and saved it from collapse,” Tran said. He noted the company – Love and Pebble – currently sells more than 90% of its products over TikTok, which is covering the legal fees for the creator lawsuit. In the second half of the hearing, the panel pressed the Justice Department on First Amendment challenges to the law. Judge Sri Srinivasan, the chief judge on the court who was appointed by former President Barack Obama, said efforts to stem content manipulation through government action does set off alarm bells and impact people who receive speech on TikTok. Tenny, the attorney for the DOJ, responded by saying the law doesn’t target TikTok users or creators and that any impact on them is only indirect. For its part, TikTok has repeatedly said it does not share U.S. user data with the Chinese government and that concerns the U.S. government has raised have never been substantiated. In their lawsuit, TikTok and ByteDance have also claimed divestment is not possible, and that even if it was, TikTok would be reduced to a shell of its former self because it would be stripped of the technology that powers it. Though the government’s primary reasoning for the law is public, significant portions of its court filings includes information that’s redacted. In one of the redacted statements submitted in late July, the Justice Department claimed TikTok took direction from the Chinese government about content on its platform, without disclosing additional details about when or why those incidents occurred. Casey Blackburn, a senior U.S. intelligence official, wrote in a legal statement that ByteDance and TikTok “have taken action in response” to Chinese government demands “to censor content outside of China.” Though the intelligence community had “no information” that this has happened on the platform operated by TikTok in the U.S., Blackburn said it may occur. But the companies have argued the government could have taken a more tailored approach to resolve its concerns. During high-stakes negotiations with the Biden administration more than two years ago, TikTok presented the government with a draft 90-page agreement that allows a third party to monitor the platform’s algorithm, content moderation practices and other programming. But it said a deal was not reached because government officials essentially walked away from the negotiating table in August 2022. Justice officials have argued complying with the draft agreement is impossible, or would require extensive resources, due to the size and the technical complexity of the platform. They say the only thing that would resolve the government’s concerns is severing the ties between TikTok and ByteDance.","summary":"TikTok argues that the law is unconstitutional, while the Justice Department says it is needed to eliminate a national security risk due to the platform's Chinese ties.","url":"https://www.centralmaine.com/2024/09/16/tiktok-u-s-government-face-off-in-court-over-law-that-could-ban-popular-platform/","image":"https://w2pcms.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2024/09/TikTok_Lawsuit_20476_abdbee.jpg?w=1000","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-17 00:25:41","author":"Haleluya Hadero,HALELUYA HADERO - Associated Press","authors":["Haleluya Hadero","HALELUYA HADERO - Associated Press"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.123},{"id":256564988,"title":"JD Vance reveals what Trump told him minutes after ex-president was target of second assassination attempt","text":"ATLANTA, Ga. — JD Vance revealed what Donald Trump told him over the phone just minutes after the ex-president became the target of a second assassination attempt on Sunday. “He says, ‘JD, you’re not going to believe this, but they tried to do it again,'” Vance said Trump told him on a phone call 10 minutes after Secret Service agents spotted the barrel of an AK-47-style rifle peeking into the former president’s West Palm Beach golf course. “I said, ‘No, you’re joshing me. But, what’s going on here sir?’” the VP contender said. Trump then informed him that a gunman — identified as Ryan Wesley Routh — planned to take him out in the second attempt on his life in roughly three months. “I was playing golf and the Secret Service found somebody who was trying to shoot me,” Vance said Trump told him. “I said, ‘Oh my Lord sir, I’m so glad you’re okay,'” he recounted.

The White House Office of Management and Budget submitted a so-called anomaly request to congressional committees amid the fallout of a second apparent assassination attempt on former President Donald Trump, this time, at his golf course in West Palm Beach, Florida. Short-term spending bills, known as a continuing resolutions or CRs, are used the fund the government at current levels for a brief period until appropriations bills for the entire fiscal year are passed. CRs often contain anomaly provisions for programs or activities that require support that departs from general funding levels, according to the Congressional Research Service. OMB warned in its request that without some flexibility to ratchet up Secret Service spending soon, “the Secret Service would have insufficient resources to sustain and enhance protective operations.” Congressional staffers say there are increasing concerns about Secret Service’s funding levels, and uncertainty over how much additional funding will be needed is part of what’s bogged down ongoing negotiations and deliberations over government spending for 2025 on Capitol Hill. Congress has until Oct. 1 to fund the government, risking a partial government shutdown a few weeks before Election Day. In the short term, OMB said in its request that granting special dispensation to boost Secret Service spending would enable the agency to “sustain current operations and address additional protective and campaign travel, operations, and overtime costs as they arise.” President Biden told reporters at the White House Monday morning that the Secret Service “needs more help.” He added, “And I think that Congress should respond to their needs if they in fact need more service people.” The Secret Service has separately notified Congress that it needs more resources to complete its mission. In a letter sent a week ago to a Senate subcommittee from Acting Secret Service Director Ronald Rowe said “increased mission requirements of the Secret Service necessitate additional resources.” The GOP vice chair of the Senate Appropriations Committee, Maine Sen. Susan Collins, told reporters, “If the Secret Service substantiates the need, I cannot imagine Congress not meeting that request.” She said that the Secret Service said after the first attempt on Trump’s life in July that inadequate resources “were not a factor.” But “given the level of protection that President Trump requires and that we’re still protecting other former presidents as we should, and President Biden and Vice President Harris, there are a lot of demands on the Secret Service, particularly in an election year when President Trump is going to be all over the country,” Collins added. Ryan Wesley Routh, the suspect in Sunday’s incident, was charged Monday with two firearm offenses in federal court. Routh, 58, was armed with an AK-47-style rifle and was allegedly 300-500 yards away from Trump at Trump International Golf Course when members of the Secret Service detail spotted him and opened fire, according to Palm Beach County Sheriff Ric Bradshaw. Routh, who did not fire his rifle, fled and was detained soon afterward. Trump was unharmed and thanked Secret Service agents and local law enforcement, calling them “absolutely outstanding.” This incident comes barely two months after Trump was shot in the ear during a rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, in mid-July. And Congress and federal agencies are still investigating this incident, which resulted in the death of one rally attendee. contributed to this report.","summary":"The Biden administration has asked Congress for special permission to increase spending on Secret Service in the weeks ahead, even if Congress only passes a short-term spending bill to avoid a government shutdown, multiple congressional and administration sources tell CBS News.  The White House Office of Management and Budget submitted a so-called anomaly request to &#8230;\n\n\nThe post Biden administration asks Congress to surge Secret Service funding in appeared first on WorldNewsEra.","url":"https://worldnewsera.com/news/politics/biden-administration-asks-congress-to-surge-secret-service-funding-in/","image":"https://assets2.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2024/09/16/c936cfc3-9a13-47a8-8139-75c000d32f5d/thumbnail/1200x630/4066a3edab05b82a49e203cb9e958ffc/ap24229732520309.jpg?v=d2d77bee90bcafa285fd6d60bd8b3612","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-17 00:14:06","author":"Cathy Biank","authors":["Cathy Biank"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.216},{"id":256564854,"title":"What can revive the American starter home?","text":"Felicia Ellis is actively looking to buy her first home by the end of the year. A three-bedroom, two-bathroom house on a tree-lined street in Houston seemed like it could be a perfect fit. But the starter home Ellis desperately wants seems to be priced like a forever home she can't afford. Someone else put in an offer, and it was accepted.\"[It was] the one that got away,\" Ellis said.Ellis says she has a good job earning around $70,000, but her student loans have made her debt-to-income ratio a turnoff for lenders. She's previously been approved for a $200,000 loan, which falls more than $150,000 short of the homes she's been looking at in an area with good schools for her young daughter. Currently Ellis and her daughter share a room in an apartment Ellis rents with her sister. Five years ago, one in three American families could afford a starter home in 63 of America's largest 100 cities, CBS News found. Now, it's down to just 10 cities. Buyers like Ellis need builders like Sharone Mayberry, who is committed to building affordable starter home projects by taking advantage of city zoning and subsidies. Mayberry is financing a 40-unit build in Houston using nearly $5 million in city reinvestment funds. The typical price of a 1,650-square-foot, three-bedroom, two and a half-bathroom home in the development costs $250,000, which is about average for a Houston starter home.Without those subsidies, the homes would average about $350,000 to $400,000, Mayberry said, due to the price of the land.This housing crisis is at least a decade in the making, according to Chris Vincent, vice president of government relations and advocacy for Habitat for Humanity. The nonprofit, one of America's largest builders of starter homes, now focuses on advocacy as much as building.\"A lot of this is from the tailwinds, even from the '08 financial crisis,\" Vincent said. \"We've essentially not been building enough homes for the last decade to keep up with demand.\"In Silver Spring, Maryland, Carolyn Hipkins got lucky. She was making $54,000 a year when she bought a starter home rehabbed by Habitat for Humanity. The sale price was $360,000 with a 0% mortgage. \"I was so happy when I got that call on the phone. I had to control myself because I wanted to scream,\" Hipkins said.Habitat for Humanity doesn't just build single family homes anymore, either. They're the ninth largest builder of starter homes in the U.S., offering condos and apartments to a range of incomes. One in six families now spend more than half of their income on housing, according to the organization. Vincent says they're advocating for access to credit and land in \"communities of opportunity.\"The housing shortage is also a key economic issue for American voters ahead of the Nov. 5 election. Vice President Kamala Harris has proposed providing $25,000 in down payment assistance for Americans who have paid their rent on time for two years. She has also proposed building 3 million affordable new homes and rentals by the end of her first term, offering tax incentives for developers who build starter homes, and a $40 billion fund to help local governments find solutions to the shortage. Former President Donald Trump has proposed making federal land available to help with housing supply, but his campaign hasn't offered any further details.Meanwhile, for every Hipkins, thousands of people like Ellis keep looking. Ellis is determined to buy a home, and a Post-It note in her bedroom serves as a reminder.\"You will be a homeowner,\" the note reads.It's the American dream on a Post-It note — and it has sticker shock.","summary":"Only one-third of American families can afford a starter home in just 10 of the 100 largest cities in the U.S., CBS News found.","url":"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/housing-market-first-time-homebuyers-priced-out-what-can-revive-the-american-starter-home/","image":"https://assets2.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2024/09/16/32d402f7-a84d-41e3-a4a0-27c1fbb4e773/thumbnail/1200x630/db4b8301fe9d693f4b1fb4b8149b660f/gettyimages-1237584740.jpg?v=d2d77bee90bcafa285fd6d60bd8b3612","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-17 00:14:03","author":"Alicia Hastey,Mark Strassmann","authors":["Alicia Hastey","Mark Strassmann"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.281},{"id":256564892,"title":"DAVID MARCUS: Just like that, the Left has normalized assassination attempts","text":"I was sitting in an empty horse-racing grandstand having a cigarette, about to order a steak at the Hollywood Casino in Washington, Pa., when I saw on my feed that a second assassination attempt on Donald Trump had been confirmed. After saying a prayer to St. Michael the Archangel, I walked back into the Bistecca steakhouse, took back my seat at the bar and told the bartender and two guys there, \"Another assassination attempt against Trump.\" TRUMP BLAMES BIDEN-HARRIS ‘RHETORIC’ FOR LATEST ASSASSINATION ATTEMPT, SAYS HE WILL ‘SAVE THE COUNTRY’ \"Are you surprised?\" one guy, a retired Teamster asked, a line that triggered a memory. \"It almost seems normal now,\" the bartender added. Then I ordered a ribeye and a glass of Merlot and we went back to watching the Chiefs against the Bengals. None of the networks cut away from the action for news coverage, my phone wasn’t blowing up with notifications, and my guess is that 90% of the people down on the floor of the casino, or in the sportsbook, had no idea anything had even happened. We all know that if such an attempt had been made on Vice President Kamala Harris’ life, the games would not only have been cut away for the news, they’d likely have been suspended. But this is about more than media bias, it’s about social callousness. Let’s take a step back and realize that this reaction to a former president and current candidate nearly being killed is absolutely bizarre, and was not the reaction just two months ago, the last time Trump was almost whacked by a loony leftist, if you are keeping track. That day, I was at a restaurant in Toledo interviewing some voters when news of the first attempt broke. People stopped in their tracks and assembled by the TVs at the bar to watch coverage. There was an electric air of shock and fear. And yet, this was the moment I was reminded of in Pennsylvania as news of the second attempt broke. One of the guys back in July, when we were watching Trump wipe blood from his face, said the exact same words: \"Are you surprised?\" To be fair, the horrible events in Butler were more dramatic. Corey Compatore tragically lost his life, and the imagery was heartstopping. But if the Palm Beach assassination attempt had happened on July 13, instead, then that Toledo restaurant would still have been stunned. The normalization of this assassination attempt on Sunday was palpable, regardless of every politician and pundit on all sides for the most part furrowing their well-plucked brows and decrying political violence. This desensitization of murder attempts against political opponents is a danger that cannot be overstated. It can only forebode a future in which not only do more attempts occur, but Americans' basic respect for the lives of those they disagree with diminishes. In the America of 25 years ago, when we did not hate each other quite so vociferously, the natural thing that would be occurring this week would be an event with Donald Trump, Kamala Harris and Joe Biden all teaming up to remind us of our core nonviolent values. That is very unlikely to happen though, because today the only thing that matters is winning the election. Both sides treat the other as an existential threat, not as a partner in governance, but what is the point of winning if the country is so bitterly divided that it can barely function? The younger of the two men at the steakhouse, a mustached friend of the Teamster, eventually weighed in. He had some sense of who I was, and where I am perceived to be on the political spectrum. \"I’m more to the right,\" he said.

West’s insurgent candidacy had been challenged in Pennsylvania by Democratic Gov. Josh Shapiro’s administration, with his secretary of state’s office arguing that the 71-year-old far-left candidate did not submit all the required paperwork on time. The state’s Supreme Court ruling affirmed a lower court order from last month knocking West off the November ballots. Monday’s ruling will allow Pennsylvania officials to begin the process of printing and sending out mail-in ballots to voters. The state has the earliest mail-in voting start date in the nation. “As soon as the court rules on that, we’ll certify the official list and then counties can complete their preparations to mail out ballots and to have voters, if they choose, go to a county election office to apply in person,” Pennsylvania Secretary of State Al Schmidt told the Associated Press prior to the state Supreme Court’s ruling. The Pennsylvania high court ruling means former President Donald Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris will appear on state ballots alongside Green Party candidate Jill Stein and Libertarian Party nominee Chase Oliver. In most state and national polls West is polling between 0% and 2%, and his left-wing policy positions threaten to siphon away votes from Harris. The race for the Keystone State is effectively tied, with the latest RealClearPolitics average of polls showing Harris with 0.1 percentage point edge over the former president. There are 19 Electoral College votes up for grabs in Pennsylvania this year. President Joe Biden defeated Trump in the battleground state by less than 100,000 votes in 2020, and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton lost in 2016 by an even slimmer margin to Trump, about 50,000 votes. West had been disqualified from appearing on Michigan presidential ballots last month by the state’s Bureau of Elections. However, the Michigan Court of Claims later overturned the ruling, certifying the far-left presidential hopeful for the Nov. 5 ballot. The Virginia Board of Elections also ruled earlier this month that West will be included on ballots despite previously disqualifying him over alleged faulty paperwork.","summary":"West is polling between 0% and 2% in most state and national 2024 polls, and his left-wing policy positions threaten to siphon away some votes from Harris. ","url":"https://nypost.com/2024/09/16/us-news/cornel-west-loses-bid-to-get-on-presidential-election-ballots-in-key-swing-state/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/09/2017-washington-dc-west-african-89830684.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/FpCpbTz5-RyIcpnTz.mp4","publish_date":"2024-09-17 00:11:24","author":"Victor Nava","authors":["Victor Nava"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.468},{"id":256564850,"title":"White House seeks to boost Secret Service funds after 2nd Trump shooting","text":"White House seeks to boost Secret Service funds after 2nd Trump shooting The Biden administration is asking Congress to increase Secret Service funding following Sunday's apparent assassination attempt on former President Donald Trump.

It’s just one incident in a long history of dangerous and unsettling behavior recounted by cops and neighbors in his hometown. Ryan Wesley Routh, 58, was charged with possessing a weapon of mass destruction after Greensboro, North Carolina, police arrested him during a traffic stop that escalated dramatically when he barricaded himself in the office of his roofing business. Tracy Fulk, the now-retired Greensboro cop who arrested Routh back then, told The Post the man was on cops’ radar when she spotted him driving with a revoked license and pulled him over. “When I got just about to the driver’s door, I saw him reach into the center of the car — so of course I shined my flashlight and looked and he opened a duffel back and there was a gun in it,” Fulk recalled. “He never picked it up. He just kind of held his hand over the duffel bag, so I backed up and I issued commands, and he just decided to put it in drive and he drove,” she added. Routh, who drove to his offices and barricaded himself from police, was also in possession of a binary explosive fitted with a 10-inch detonation cord and a blasting cap — the components of an explosive device, according to Greensboro police. Fulk said she was wary of the man, so she called for backup while taking cover behind her vehicle. “I think we were out there a couple hours, but it seemed like forever,” the former officer said. “I could see him inside pacing back and forth and every once in a while he would look out the window. “But he never pointed a gun at anybody that night,” she added. “Once they got him to surrender, that was it.” Fulk said she was shocked to learn that the man she encountered all those years ago was the same man accused of attempting to shoot Trump on Sunday while he was playing golf in his Florida course. Although the former cop described Routh as “polite” during his arrest, she said the charges he faces now make a certain amount of sense. “At first I was surprised but then, after I started remembering all the barometer reports and the incidents that other officers had with him,” she said, “I guess it’s kind of along his personality.” Fulk’s comment came after one of Routh’s neighbors, Josh Patrick, 30, told The Post of the multiple, unsettling run-ins he had with Routh back in March. Patrick described Routh as a “high-risk person,” claiming “there were warning signs” and “red flags” that he would eventually attack someone. David Atkinson, a former employee who worked at Routh’s United Roofing company, said he too was surprised by Sunday’s arrest since he knew his former boss as a good, family man. “For Ryan to do something to this, something triggered him or he was provoked, because I’m telling you personally, from my experience – and know a lot of people who have worked for the same man, and they would tell you the same thing – that Ryan Routh is not like this,” said Atkinson, a registered sex offender.

I know Congress will be looking at this again. It seems to me that they don't have enough resources, they don't have enough people.\"\"We have a unique situation,\" he continued. \"We have Donald Trump, who has been president, who is running again. He deserves the same type of security that the incumbent president does and that, you know, the Democrat vice president does, who is running for president.\"Secret Service acting director Ronald Rowe said during a news conference earlier on Monday that Trump already had the \"highest level of protection\" following the assassination attempt in July, with Rowe adding that the \"security plan worked\" in thwarting the apparent attempt on Sunday.DeWine also addressed Trump's pet-eating claim during his CNN interview on Monday, pointing out that the claim is not supported by evidence while defending a community of Haitian immigrants that has been facing repeated threats since the former president pushed the claim during his September 10 debate with Vice President Kamala Harris.\"My job is to reflect exactly on what's going on in Springfield,\" DeWine said. \"The mayor tells us, and the chief of police tells us, that there's been no evidence at all of anyone eating a dog or any Haitians doing any of that. These Haitians that are there are legal.\"\"They work very, very hard,\" he added. \"I met this morning with a number of businesspeople who employ these Haitians and they tell me they are really essential to getting the job done. They work hard, they're family-focused.\"Newsweek reached out for comment to the Trump campaign via email on Monday evening.Republican Springfield Mayor Rob Rue told Politico on Monday that he was \"frustrated\" by Trump's remarks and declined to commit to backing Trump and Vance in November.\"Any political leader that takes the national stage and has the national spotlight needs to understand the gravity of the words that they have for cities like ours, and what they say impacts our city,\" Rue said. \"We've had bomb threats the last two days. We've had personal threats the last two days, and it's increasing.\"\"It is a bit out of control,\" he added. \"And for what it's worth, your pets are safe in Springfield, Ohio.\"Politico also reported that two Republican county commissioners were declining to commit to voting for Trump following the pet-eating claim and the threats to local residents that followed.Trump insisted during a campaign stop in Las Vegas on Saturday that there was no connection between his claims about Springfield and the threats, while continuing to falsely claim that the town was full of \"illegal\" migrants.\"I don't know what happened with the bomb threats,\" Trump told reporters, according to CNN. \"I know that it's been taken over by illegal migrants, and that's a terrible thing that happened.

Amber Nicole Thurman, 28, developed a rare complication from abortion pills and died during emergency surgery in August 2022, with an official state committee blaming the fatal outcome on a \"preventable\" lag in performing a critical procedure. Georgia had just passed a law that made performing dilation and curettage (D&C) a felony offense with medical exceptions that doctors had warned were vague and difficult to interpret. \"Amber would be alive right now if it wasn't for Donald Trump and Brian Kemp's abortion ban,\" said Mini Timmara, president of Reproductive Freedom for All. \"They have blood on their hands.\" The US Supreme Court's 2022 decision to overturn national abortion rights unleashed a wave of bans and restrictions in 22 states, thrusting reproductive rights to the forefront of the upcoming presidential election. ProPublica said this was the first abortion-related death officially deemed \"preventable\" and plans to publish details of a second case soon. These official reviews are not made public, but ProPublica obtained copies of the reports. Thurman, an otherwise healthy medical assistant and mother of a six-year-old boy, made the decision to terminate a twin pregnancy to preserve her newfound stability, her best friend Ricaria Baker told ProPublica. She and her son had recently moved to a new apartment complex and she planned to enroll in nursing school. She wanted a surgical abortion, but Georgia's six-week abortion ban forced her to seek care at a clinic in North Carolina. On the day of the procedure, the hours-long drive was hampered by traffic, and Thurman missed her 15-minute appointment window. The clinic offered a medication abortion with mifepristone and misoprostol. While overwhelmingly safe, rare complications can occur. Thurman's condition worsened over several days, turning into heavy bleeding and vomiting blood. She was taken to Piedmont Henry Hospital in Stockbridge. Doctors found she had not expelled all the fetal tissue from her body and she was diagnosed with \"acute severe sepsis.\" But despite her rapidly deteriorating health, the hospital delayed Thurman's dilation and curettage procedure for 17 hours. By the time they operated, the situation was so dire it required open abdominal surgery. The doctor performed the operation and found a hysterectomy was also required -- but during the procedure, Thurman's heart stopped. Her mother recalled her last words: \"Promise me you'll take care of my son.\" The state committee found there was a \"good chance\" that an earlier procedure could have saved Thurman's life. \"Life of the mother\" exceptions have widely proven inadequate, forcing women to cross state lines in desperate bids for lifesaving care. \"She died in a hospital, surrounded by medical providers who could have saved her life,\" feminist author Jessica Valenti wrote on X. \"This is what abortion bans do.\" (Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)","summary":"Reproductive rights groups erupted in outrage Monday after ProPublica revealed that a Georgia woman died from delayed medical care caused by the US state's restrictive abortion law.","url":"https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/us-woman-died-after-abortion-ban-delayed-her-medical-care-report-6581828","image":"https://i.ndtvimg.com/i/2016-01/us-abortion-protest_650x400_81453750411.jpg?im=FeatureCrop,algorithm=dnn,width=1200,height=738","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-16 23:53:24","author":null,"language":"en","source_country":"in","sentiment":-0.572},{"id":256565396,"title":"‘Highly Inflammatory Language’:Trump blames Biden and Harris’ ‘rhetoric’ for assassination plot","text":"Washington, Sep 17 (IANS) Launching a fiery attack against Democrats, former US President Donald Trump has said that President Joe Biden and Vice-President Kamala Harris’ “rhetoric” is responsible for the second assassination attempt against him since July, media reported. Trump said on Monday that the suspected gunman “acted” on the “highly inflammatory language” of Democrats, CNN reported. The Republican nominee’s sharp remarks came a day after he escaped an attack at International Golf Club in West Palm Beach, Florida. During an interview with Fox News, the former President said that the suspect “believed the rhetoric of Biden and Harris, and he acted on it”. Trump added, “Their rhetoric is causing me to be shot at, when I am the one who is going to save the country, and they are the ones that are destroying the country — both from the inside and out.” The former President pointed to comments made by Biden and Harris that Trump is a threat to democracy, according to Fox News Digital, and said, “These are people that want to destroy our country.” He said that Biden and Harris, “They are the real threat.” “They use highly inflammatory language,” Trump said. “I can use it too — far better than they can — but I don’t,” he added. Harris, her running mate and Minnesota Governor Tim Walz, and Biden all quickly expressed relief that a person suspected of planning to target Trump at one of his Florida golf courses was spotted before he could get off a shot and that the former President was safe. Harris said she was briefed on the incident and wrote on social media: “I am glad he is safe. Violence has no place in America.” Biden and Harris have both argued Trump presents a clear threat to US democracy. When Biden began his 2024 campaign which he has since suspended, he pointed to the January 6, 2021, insurrection at the US Capitol that Trump incited and argued Trump was “willing to sacrifice our democracy, put himself in power”. Harris has argued Trump is a “threat to our democracy and fundamental freedoms”. The suspected gunman, Ryan Wesley Routh, possessed an AK-47-style rifle pointing through the chain-link fence out towards the green, a go-pro camera, and two backpacks. Routh escaped from the spot but was pulled over and arrested on I-95, according to Fox News report. Following the shooting incident near his Florida Golf Course on Sunday, former US President Trump said that he is absolutely “safe and well”. He was playing golf at West Palm Beach’s Trump International Golf Club. In a fundraising email, Trump wrote, “There were gunshots in my vicinity, but before rumours start spiralling out of control, I wanted you to hear this first: I AM SAFE AND WELL!” “Nothing will slow me down. I will NEVER SURRENDER! I will always love you for supporting me,” he said in the email. Trump is “safe following gunshots in his vicinity,” the Trump Campaign said in a statement on Sunday, according to CNN. Soon after the incident took place, Trump ally Republican Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina spoke with him, and said that he is “good spirits”. The second assassination attempt against Trump came after he was shot in the ear at a rally in Pennsylvania by a gunman who killed one person and injured others before being shot by police on July 13. –IANS khz","summary":"Washington, Sep 17 (IANS) Launching a fiery attack against Democrats, former US President Donald Trump has said that President Joe Biden and Vice-President Kamala Harris&#8217; &#8220;rhetoric&#8221; is responsible for the second assassination attempt against him since July, media reported.

Rice wrote in a statement on Facebook on Friday. “As of today, thousands of firefighters are on the front lines responding to wildfires throughout the state, and countless Californians are in harm’s way as they heed evacuation orders,” he added. “Nevertheless, former President Trump expressed that he would play with their lives and their homes if he doesn’t get what he wants.” Earlier that day, Trump tore into California and its governor Gavin Newsom, whom the former president refers to as “Newscum,” over the state’s water policies, which have come under fire from farmers in red-leaning areas. “The automobile industry is dead, the water coming here is dead, and Gavin ‘Newscum’ is gonna sign those papers,” Trump said at his Rancho Palos Verdes golf club. “And if he doesn’t sign those papers, we won’t give him money to put out all his fires. And if we don’t give him all the money to put out fires, he’s got problems. He’s a lousy governor.” The Independent has contacted the Trump campaign for comment. Newsom hammered Trump on X, saying the former president was putting lives at risk “to settle political vendettas.” “Today it’s California’s wildfires,” Newsom wrote. “Tomorrow it could be hurricane funding for North Carolina or flooding assistance for homeowners in Pennsylvania. Donald Trump doesn’t care about America — he only cares about himself.” The comments come as California faces 11 simultaneous active wildfires which have burned over 650,000 acres, according to Cal Fire. A combination of hot weather, climate change, and fuel built up in remote areas after a series of wet winters have primed the state for another deadly fire season. Trump’s remarks, Rice noted, echoed similarly controversial claims Trump made about California fires in 2018, when he downplayed the link between fires and climate and instead claimed the state needed to do a better job “raking and cleaning” forests. \"I was with the president of Finland and he said ... we’re a forest nation, he called it a forest nation, and they spend a lot of time on raking and cleaning and doing things. They don’t have any problem, and what it is, it’s a very small problem,\" Trump said in 2018. The Finnish president at the time said they never discussed raking. Trump’s comments from California last week touched on a long-running, if slightly obscure, state political debate. California moves large volumes of its water, much of which comes from snow in the Sierra Nevada Mountains, further south, dividing it between farmers in the Central Valley and residential areas throughout the state, including populous, water-starved cities like Los Angeles. Because of a series of court decisions, the state also allows some of its water to flow unused into the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta and out through the San Francisco Bay, in order to protect fish species that support larger ocean ecosystems. Some California farmers have pushed the state to divert more water for agriculture, and the Trump administration, working with an interior secretary who was a former Central Valley lobbyist, changed Obama-era rules to put more water in the fields. Environmental groups and the Newsom administration sued to stop the changes, and the Biden administration is reportedly racing to lock in wildlife protections for the water before the end of the year. Trump’s comments are unlikely to make much political difference in heavily blue California, where Biden carried a nearly 30-point lead over the Republican.","summary":"Fires have burned nearly 1m acres in California this year","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/trump-california-wildfire-union-funding-newsom-b2613938.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2024/09/13/17/2170855817.jpg?width=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/THDR7BKw-4VHSaSK0.mp4","publish_date":"2024-09-16 23:52:15","author":"Josh Marcus","authors":["Josh Marcus"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.077},{"id":256564178,"title":"Trump Speaks to Biden After Blaming Him for Apparent Assassination Attempt","text":"President Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump spoke in a \"cordial\" call on Monday, according to a White House official, following another apparent assassination attempt on Trump on Sunday, which the former President said was caused by Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris' \"rhetoric\".\"President Biden just spoke with former President Trump, and conveyed his relief that he is safe.

Among those deaths, more than 2,500 children (ages one through nine) and teens (10 through 17) died by a firearm — an average of seven deaths every day. That year, the report found that firearms accounted for 30 percent of all the deaths that occurred among young people ages 15 to 17. Guns were also the leading cause of death among children and teens, accounting for more deaths than car crashes, overdoses, or cancers, per the report. Notably, a distinction was made for this year’s data, with young people ages 18 to 19 categorized as “emerging adults” due to some states allowing 18 year olds to legally purchase certain firearms. “Since 2013, the gun death rate among children and teens (1–17) has increased 106 percent,” the Johns Hopkins Center for Gun Violence Solutions report stated. The report found that while the gun homicide rate dropped 7.5 percent in 2022, 19,651 people were killed by a gun that year — the second-highest number of gun homicide deaths recorded. The report also spotlighted how gun violence disproportionally affected Black and Hispanic/Latino young people. In 2022, Black children and teens suffered a gun homicide rate 18 times higher compared with white children and teens. That year, the gun homicide rate among Hispanic/Latino children and teens was three times higher than for white children and teens. While historically, white youth have had higher gun suicide rates than youth from other races and ethnicities, the report indicated that these numbers have begun to shift. Although gun suicide deaths were higher for white older teens than Black older teens and emerging adults (ages 15 to 19) in 2022, gun suicide rates have tripled among Black older teens and emerging adults and have doubled among Hispanic/Latinos in the same age group from 2013 to 2022. Gun violence accounted for 55 percent of deaths among older Black teens ages 15 to 17 in 2022, while American Indian/Alaskan Native people were five times more likely to die by firearm homicide compared with white people in the same age group. The report emerges amid a call among Democrats for stricter gun legislation and a contentious 2024 presidential race. Vice President Kamala Harris, the Democratic candidate, and former President Donald Trump, the Republican candidate, have offered wildly different approaches to gun control. Trump has strongly aligned with the National Rifle Association and has vowed to expand gun-owners rights. Meanwhile, Harris — a gun owner herself — has supported tighter gun restrictions, including an assault weapons ban and universal background checks. Recent months saw the tragic school shooting at a Georgia high school that left four dead, and a second assassination attempt of former President Trump in two months, according to the FBI. In its report, the Johns Hopkins Center for Gun Violence Solutions stated that it is the center’s “mission to provide policymakers and the public accurate and up-to-date data on gun fatalities and illustrate the enormous toll gun violence has on our country.”","summary":"More children and teens (ages one to 17) died from gun violence — accounting for more deaths than car crashes, overdoses, or cancers, Johns Hopkins Center for Gun Violence Solutions found","url":"https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-news/guns-leading-cause-of-death-children-teens-new-report-1235103693/","image":"https://www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/guns-leading-cause-death-children-teens-1.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-16 23:49:53","author":"Charisma Madarang","authors":["Charisma Madarang"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.166},{"id":256564286,"title":"TikTok Fights for Survival in American Legal Showdown","text":"On September 16, 2024, TikTok faces a critical moment in its legal battle against a potential U.S. ban. The popular social media platform will have just 15 minutes to present its case before a federal appeals court. This hearing marks a pivotal point in TikTok’s struggle to maintain its operations in the United States. The controversy stems from a law signed by President Joe Biden in April 2024. This legislation requires ByteDance, TikTok’s Chinese parent company, to divest its American operations by January 19, 2025. Failure to comply could result in TikTok’s ban in the U.S., affecting its 170 million American users. TikTok and ByteDance have filed lawsuits challenging the constitutionality of this law. They argue that it violates the First Amendment rights of both the company and its users. The case has bypassed the lower courts and moved directly to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. A panel of three judges will preside over the hearing. Chief Judge Sri Srinivasan, appointed by Obama, leads the panel. Trump appointee Neomi Rao and Reagan appointee Douglas Ginsburg complete the trio. Their decision, expected within weeks, could shape the future of social media regulation in the U.S. The core issue at hand is whether national security concerns justify potential infringements on free speech rights. The U.S. government argues that TikTok‘s Chinese ownership poses a significant threat to data security. They fear the Chinese government could access sensitive user information or manipulate the platform’s algorithm. TikTok counters these claims by highlighting its efforts to address security concerns. The company has implemented Project Texas, which involves storing U.S. user data on Oracle-managed servers. TikTok also claims that previous negotiations with U.S. officials were abruptly abandoned without explanation. The case has broader implications beyond TikTok’s fate. It could set the precedent for how courts interpret the First Amendment in relation to digital platforms. The outcome may influence future regulations of foreign-owned tech companies operating in the U.S. TikTok’s Legal Battle Political dynamics add another layer of complexity to the situation. Former President Donald Trump, who initially sought to ban TikTok, now opposes such efforts. Meanwhile, the Biden campaign maintains an active presence on the platform, recognizing its importance in reaching younger voters. As the January 2025 deadline looms, TikTok’s legal team faces immense pressure. They must convince the court that the law is unconstitutionally severe and that alternative measures exist to address security concerns. The company’s future in the U.S. hangs in the balance of this high-stakes legal battle. This case highlights the ongoing tension between national security interests and free speech protections in the digital age. It also underscores the challenges of regulating global tech platforms in an increasingly interconnected world. The court’s decision will likely have far-reaching consequences for the tech industry and U.S.-China relations.","summary":"On September 16, 2024, TikTok faces a critical moment in its legal battle against a potential U.S. ban.

The Postal Service already dealt with most concerns raised by election officials, he said, after they warned that properly addressed election mail was returned – a problem that can cause voters to be automatically placed on inactive status – and that mail-in ballots were postmarked on time but arrived after election deadlines. DeJoy said that training is already being beefed up for postal employees and that the Postal Service is already in constant contact with election officials and will work them to address quality problems that caused incorrect deliveries or mail to be returned to sender. He also said he’d work with them to avoid a repeat of “flawed ballot envelope designs,” though many envelopes were already designed and printed, officials said. The Postal Service also has teams in place to tackle mail flagged as “undeliverable as addressed,” or any other problem that might arise with election mail, DeJoy wrote. The concerns were raised by the National Association of Secretaries of State and the National Association of State Election Directors, even as former President Donald Trump continues to falsely claim he won in 2020 and seized upon the mail delivery troubles to sow doubts about the upcoming election. He repeated his claim Sunday on social media that the Postal Service is not up to the task. In 2020, amid the coronavirus pandemic, election officials reported sending just over 69 million ballots in the mail – a substantial increase from four years earlier. While the numbers this year may be smaller, many voters have embraced mail voting and come to rely on it. And both Democrats and Republicans have launched efforts to push supporters to vote early, either in person or by mail to “bank” their votes before Election Day on Nov. 5. In a sign of how quickly Election Day is approaching, the first batch of mail ballots were sent last week to absentee voters in Alabama. Steve Simon, president of the National Association of Secretaries of State, on Monday stood by his assessment that the Postal Service has been slow to respond to concerns. He said localized problems can be easily addressed, but “larger issues still remain.” “If the nation’s election officials felt these issues had been properly addressed with USPS staff over the last year, then there would have been no need” for the election groups to air their concerns last week, Simon said. Mandy Vigil, president of the National Association of State Election Directors, agreed “that the issues we’ve raised have not been resolved adequately going into the November election.” In his response, DeJoy acknowledged that a massive network reorganization caused some temporary problems but assured the two bipartisan election groups that changes are now being limited to avoid slowing election mail ahead of the November election. He suggested that Postal Service’s performance in past elections should speak for itself. Postal Service officials said that nearly 98% of ballots were returned to election officials within three days and that 99.9% of ballots were delivered within seven days in the last presidential election, at the height of the pandemic. “As demonstrated consistently in previous elections, election mail routinely outperforms our regular service performance due to our long-standing processes and procedures,” DeJoy wrote. First-class mail is currently averaging 2.7 days for delivery, DeJoy said, even though the two groups wrote in a letter last week that some election officials received timely postmarked ballots after Election Day and outside the three to five business days Postal Service sets as the standard for first-class mail. Nonetheless, DeJoy said, voters shouldn’t procrastinate with mail-in ballots this election season. Both the Postal Service and state election officials are urging anyone voting by mail to return their ballots well before Election Day or to use drop boxes where available.","summary":"Postmaster General Louis DeJoy says he’ll work with state election officials to address concerns about mail-in ballots after they warned of persistent problems during the primary season","url":"https://www.centralmaine.com/2024/09/16/postal-service-insists-its-ready-for-a-flood-of-mail-in-ballots/","image":"https://w2pcms.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2024/09/US_Election_2024_Postal_Service_46579_785ead.jpg?w=1000","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-16 23:42:45","author":"David Sharp,DAVID SHARP - Associated Press","authors":["David Sharp","DAVID SHARP - Associated Press"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.558},{"id":256563844,"title":"Robbins: Wheels come off Trump’s campaign at debate","text":"Donald Trump’s surrogates faced something of a challenge in the aftermath of last week’s presidential debate, obliged to insist that things had gone well for him, all evidence to the contrary. And there was plenty of contrary evidence provided by the former president’s responses to questions posed by the moderators, as Kamala Harris displayed debating skills that left him looking rattled. Harris mixed broad themes with zingers aimed at making Trump go postal. The military regards Trump as “a disgrace,” he was a convicted felon who was facing a sentencing hearing that would be “a big day” for him, he was “weak” and Putin et al would “eat him for lunch.” It’s been a long time since Trump seemed mentally suited to be president, but last week over 60 million Americans saw someone who needed to be guided off the stage, if not out of the building. There were the customary insults, which made him sound like a Not Ready For Prime Time Player. “She’s a Marxist,” Trump ranted. “Everybody knows she’s a Marxist. Her father’s a Marxist professor in economics. He taught her well.” Then “People don’t go to her rallies,” the product of wishful thinking, delusion or both. “And the people that do go, she’s busing them in and paying them to be there.” Stung by Harris’ jab about the empty seats at his rallies and the video of people leaving them, Trump sounded somewhere between infantile and untethered. “People don’t leave my rallies,” he insisted angrily. “We have the biggest rallies, the most incredible rallies in the history of politics.” Pressed about his boasts that he had overturned Roe v. Wade, Trump resorted to simple fiction. Democratic Vice Presidential nominee Tim Walz, Trump contended, “says abortion in the ninth month is absolutely fine. He also says execution after birth, it’s execution, no longer abortion, because the baby is born, is okay.” The nullification of Roe was opposed by the overwhelming majority of Americans, but not on Donald Trump’s planet. “Every legal scholar, every Democrat, every Republican, liberal, conservative, they all wanted this issue to be brought back to the states,” he claimed. On the issue of Afghanistan, Trump got some basic facts wrong, in the light most favorable to him, telling a story which sounded, well, made-up. The leader of the Taliban since 2016 has been Hibatullah Akhundzada. Not according to Trump. “Abdul is the head of the Taliban,” Trump declared. “He’s still the head of the Taliban. And I told Abdul don’t do it anymore, you do it again you’re going to have problems. And he said why do you send me a photo of my house. I said you’re going to have to figure it out.” Why Trump’s sending Abdul a picture of his house is something all of us are going to have to figure out, and not just Abdul. Trump was just warming up, bouncing from warnings about World War III (“just to go into another subject”) to what, supposedly, is “what’s happening in the towns all over the United States,” which “a lot of towns don’t want to talk about because they’re so embarrassed about it.” What is it that’s happening all over America? Immigrants are “eating the dogs. The people that came in. They’re eating the cats. They’re eating – they’re eating – they’re eating the pets of the people that live there. And this is what’s happening in our country.” Informed that this story is unfounded, Trump remained adamant. “The people on television say my dog was taken and used for food,” he insisted. There was a feeling post-debate that Americans have had enough. Narcissists or charlatans, even demagogues, are one thing. But seeming unhinged is something else. That’s the challenge they have at Mar-a-Lago.

Over the last five years, an estimated 15,000 new Haitian immigrants have moved into Springfield.

Doesn’t that mean I should shut up about the residents of Springfield? Don’t you realize you’re engaged in basic propaganda to silence the concerns of American citizens?” he shot back on CNN.

It could help Democrats","text":"DES MOINES, Iowa — Joe Wiederien was an unlikely candidate to challenge a Republican congressman in one of the nation’s most competitive House districts. A fervent supporter of former President Donald Trump, Wiederien was registered as a Republican until months earlier. A debilitating stroke had left him unable to drive. He had never run for office. For a time, he couldn’t vote because of a felony conviction. But he arrived last month at the Iowa Capitol with well over the 1,726 petition signatures needed to qualify for the ballot as a conservative alternative to first-term Republican Rep. Zach Nunn. After filing the paperwork, he flashed a thumbs up across the room at an operative he knew only as “Johnny.” Several other unorthodox candidates have emerged across the country – all backed by the same shadowy group, the Patriots Run Project. For the past year, the group has recruited Trump supporters to run as independent candidates in key swing districts where they could siphon votes from Republicans in races that will help determine which party controls the House next year, an Associated Press review has found. In addition to two races in Iowa, the group recruited candidates in Nebraska, Montana, Virginia and Minnesota. All six recruits described themselves as retired, disabled – or both. The group’s operation provides few clues about its management, financing or motivation. But interviews, text messages, emails, business filings and other documents reviewed by the AP show that a significant sum has been spent – and some of it traces back to Democratic consulting firms. While dirty tricks are as old as American elections, the efforts this year could have profound consequences in the fight to control Congress, which is expected to be decided by a handful of races. It’s also not an isolated example: allies of Trump have been working across the U.S. to get liberal academic Cornel West on the ballot in hopes he could play spoiler in the presidential election. “At that time I was thinking, well, it would be nice to be in Congress and get to work with President Trump,” Wiederien, 54, reflected in an interview outside the Veterans Affairs hospital in Des Moines, where he was seeking treatment for a leaking incision on his head from previous brain surgery. “It looks like it’s a dirty trick now.” Wiederien withdrew his candidacy last month after he says it became clear he’d been manipulated into running against Nunn. Now he wants an investigation to uncover the motives of those who made his candidacy possible. Nunn on Monday called the effort a plot “to steal this election.” “I am outraged to see anyone prey on hardworking Iowans or deceive voters,” he said. As with other recruits, Wiederien’s story begins with Facebook, where the Patriots Run Project operated a series of pro-Trump pages and ran ads that used apocalyptic rhetoric to attack establishment politicians in both parties while urging conservatives to run in November. “We need American Patriots like YOU to stand for freedom with President Trump and take back control from the globalist elites by running for office,” one such ad states. Some candidates say they were contacted because of their political posts on Facebook. Two others said the group reached out after they completed an online survey. Once recruited, they communicated with a handful of operatives through text messages, emails and phone calls. In-person contact was limited. Patriots Run Project advised them about what forms to fill out and how to file required paperwork. In at least three races, petition signatures to qualify for the ballot were circulated by a Nevada company that works closely with the Democratic consulting firm Sole Strategies, according to documents, including text messages and a draft contract, as well as the firm’s co-founder. In Iowa, a different Democratic firm conducted a poll testing attacks on Nunn, while presenting Wiederien as the true conservative. Despite the ties to Democratic firms, there is a scant paper trail to determine who is overseeing the effort. Patriots Run Project is not a registered business in the United States and it is not listed as a nonprofit with the IRS. It has not filed paperwork to form a political committee with the Federal Election Commission. The only concrete identifying detail listed on the group’s website is a P.O. Box inside a UPS store in Washington, D.C. Messages left at email addresses and phone numbers for the group’s operatives went unanswered. A spokesperson for the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, House Democrats’ campaign arm, said the organization had no knowledge of or involvement in the effort. House Majority PAC, the Democrats’ big spending congressional super PAC, was also not involved, a spokesman said. Jason Torchinsky, a prominent Republican election lawyer and former Justice Department official, said investigators should take interest. “Given what is described, there could be a wide variety of federal and state criminal violations,” he said. Rick Hasen, a law professor at the University of California, Los Angeles, said the effort “looks shady and unethical,” but added “it is hard to say whether any laws have been broken, which would depend not only on the facts, but also the statutes and precedents under state law.” In Iowa, it is a crime to deprive or defraud voters of “a fair and impartially conducted election process,” while in Virginia ”conspiracy against rights of citizens” is a felony. It’s not the first time Patriots Run Project has drawn attention. In June, the Center for Strategic Dialogue, a London-based watchdog, issued a report that found the network of Patriots Run Project pages on Facebook were likely controlled by a small number of people, deceiving users and violating Facebook’s policies on “coordinated inauthentic behavior.” The ads also violated the site’s standards because they did not include disclaimers showing who was responsible. Facebook took down the pages. But by then, the mystery operatives running the group were already working to get recruits on ballots. Meta, Facebook’s parent company, didn’t respond to a request for comment. The company reported receiving $48,000 for the group’s ads. Unlike Wiederien, other candidates said they believed the group had done nothing wrong. Thomas Bowman, 71 and disabled after a kidney transplant, said he believes he likely was recruited to run against Democratic Rep. Angie Craig of Minnesota to split the conservative vote and help Craig win reelection in the suburban Minneapolis district. But the self-described constitutional conservative expressed gratitude for free help getting signatures. “They got me on the ballot,” Bowman said. “If I had to do that all by myself, I couldn’t do it.” In Montana, Dennis Hayes was recruited to run as a Libertarian against GOP Rep. Ryan Zinke. The group found a donor to give him $1,740 to cover his candidate filing fee, Hayes recalled. The donor, whom Hayes would not identify, went to Hayes’ bank with him to deposit the check, which Politico previously reported. “I told them I didn’t have the money to run or I would. They got me a donor so I could run for Congress,” said Hayes, 70. Robert Reid, a widowed retiree running against Republican Rep. Jen Kiggans in southeastern Virginia, said he was contacted by Patriots Run Project after posting his views to Facebook. His sole in-person contact was when a man drove to his home in a Mercedes SUV to drop off his completed petition signature paperwork. “They seem to be nice people,” said Reid, a Trump supporter who will appear on November’s ballot for the swing district seat. The thought, however, did cross his mind that “these guys want me to run to draw votes away from” Kiggans. In Nebraska, Army veteran and Trump supporter Gary Bera said he was asked to run as an independent against Rep. Don Bacon, a Republican who is facing a challenge. The district, which includes Omaha, is the state’s most competitive. Bera was a truck driver and engineering draftsman before disability forced him from work. After he was recruited through an online survey, Bera said the group instructed him to open a business checking account, a requirement for declaring a federal candidacy. Because his car wouldn’t run, an operative agreed to pick him up to file paperwork with the state. But plans changed abruptly last month when he was informed that the group had not collected enough signatures for him to qualify. “Now I’m putzing around,” Bera said. In Iowa, the group recruited longtime GOP activist Stephanie Jones to run as an independent against Republican Rep. Mariannette Miller-Meeks, even though Jones does not live in that eastern Iowa district. Jones said the group paid to gather signatures for her but fell short. Jones, a Trump supporter who is on disability due to post-traumatic stress disorder, then unsuccessfully sought the Libertarian Party nomination with an operative’s encouragement. She said she believes those behind the effort are genuine but desire anonymity because “they don’t want to be targets of the deep state.” Wiederien, however, thinks the group had ulterior motives. The Iowa district he was recruited to run in has been fiercely contested in recent years. Nunn won by roughly 2,000 votes in 2022, while the Democrat who held the seat, Cindy Axne, eked out victories in two prior races that drew third-party candidates. The Patriots Run Project identified Wiederien through Facebook last fall, and an operative calling himself “Knox” urged him to run: “God bless you. You’re a true patriot. We are gonna save our country!” Wiederien, who has a collection of Trump merchandise and attended several Trump rallies, had text and phone conversations over the ensuing months with operatives who identified themselves as “Will Haywood” and “Johnny Shearer.” The AP was unable to confirm whether Haywood and Shearer were real identities. A John Shearer who Wiederien said was involved said he would not confirm or deny any participation. “If I were in this covert political organization I wouldn’t really admit to it, would I?” he said. The operatives convinced Wiederien to change his party affiliation from Republican to unaffiliated so he could qualify. They assured him his 2013 felony conviction for his third operating while intoxicated offense, which cost him his right to vote and run for office until 2016, wasn’t disqualifying. They urged him to list his affiliation on the ballot as “America First.” They arranged for a firm to gather signatures across the district, which includes Des Moines, its suburbs and rural southern Iowa. Those signatures were gathered by Common Sense America, a Nevada limited liability company created in February. A company disclosure filing in Colorado, which requires signature gatherers to register, lists a phone number for a co-founder of the Democratic consulting firm, Sole Strategies. “We work very closely with Common Sense America,” Zee Cohen-Sanchez, the co-founder, said when contacted. Lisa Cohen, the registered agent for Common Sense America who appears to be Cohen-Sanchez’s mother, didn’t return messages. Sole Strategies has earned nearly $1.8 million over the past four years working for Democratic candidates and causes, including numerous Democratic House members and candidates, records show. Jones said Common Sense America gathered signatures for her campaign. A draft contract shows the firm was set to receive $3,300 for collecting signatures for Bera in Nebraska. A philanthropist listed on the document as the proposed buyer of those services is Carolyn Cohen of Nyack, New York, a registered Democrat who has a history of supporting liberal causes. “She doesn’t comment on her political donations,” her partner, Larry Miller, said. Last month, a poll attacked Nunn as soft in his opposition to abortion, terrorists and Democrats – calling him “an errand boy for the uniparty elite”– while painting Wiederien as the pro-Trump conservative in the race. A spokeswoman for the firm that operated the poll, Dynata, said that its client was Patinkin Research, which says it “has worked to elect dozens of Democratic candidates.” The spokeswoman later said she identified Patinkin in error and urged AP not to publish its identity. Patinkin’s founder didn’t return messages. When it was time to submit his petitions, Wiederien said “Johnny” agreed to drive him the 75 miles to Des Moines and arrived in an electric car. The car needed to be charged before they could make the trek, so Wiederien said he entertained the operative with video clips of Trump while they waited. Later, he said they met a man wearing a suit in an office near the Iowa Capitol who gave them paperwork and a binder full of his signatures. All Wiederien had to do was sign a form. Wiederien’s statement of candidacy was notarized by a Des Moines paralegal whose firm has done some campaign-related work for Democrats. Firm representatives didn’t return messages. Wiederien said he found it suspicious “Johnny” appeared to avoid a Capitol surveillance camera and declined to have his picture taken with him. Afterward, the group paid for an Uber to drive Wiederien home. Soon, he heard from Republicans who convinced him he’d been tricked into thinking the Patriots Run Project had Trump’s support and withdrew his name from the ballot.","summary":"Several little-known pro-Trump candidates are running for Congress in key races as independents, and an Associated Press review finds they were recruited and backed by the same shadowy group","url":"https://www.centralmaine.com/2024/09/16/a-secretive-group-recruited-far-right-candidates-in-key-u-s-house-races-it-could-help-democrats/","image":"https://w2pcms.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2024/09/Election_2024_Ballot_Deception_59093_9c20ff.jpg?w=1000","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-16 23:35:05","author":"Ryan J.

He went 10-0 with 108 strikeouts, 13 walks and 2.39 ERA 79 innings. In 2023, however, he slumped to 7-6 with a 4.75 ERA and fell on the draft board. “He made some mechanical adjustments that, probably, he didn’t need to make,” Rockies general manager Bill Schmidt said a year ago. “He was trying to get better, making some tweaks. But he’s got to tweak them back.” He has. The right-hander fanned 10 or more in four of his 14 starts for Spokane, going 4-1 with a 2.63 ERA. In 118 innings over 23 starts overall, he is 6-2 with a 2.59 ERA, allowing 94 hits and 47 walks while striking out an eye-popping 169.

In six innings, the lefty fanned 13 without a walk, yielding one run on five hits. He also whiffed 10 or more four times before being called up, going 7-2 with a 2.16 ERA. Overall, Sullivan has a 9-2 record, 2.11 ERA in 21 starts. In115 1/3 innings, he has yielded 90 hits and only 15 walks while striking out 125. He got a $1.7 million signing bonus as the Rockies’ second pick, No. 46 overall, in the 2022 MLB Draft out of Wake Forest. “He struck out guys,” Schmidt said then. “Hitters had problems picking up his stuff. He’s left-handed with a very quality slider and angle to his fastball.” The 6-4, 190-pounder has an odd delivery that helps confounder batters. A Matter Of Odd Anatomy It is physically impossible though an absolute given that the Rockies’ arms have been the franchise’s Achilles’ heel. In 32 seasons, they have finished above .500 only eight times. The best team ERA mark was 4.14 in 2010. That was only ninth-best in the National League that year though helped Colorado go 83-79. The worst ERA was a lofty 6.01 in 1999. The 2023 club that had a 59-103 record had the next-worst ERA at 5.67. A Nied From The Start Colorado’s altitude and ballpark have traditionally frustrated pitchers and helped hitters. From their inception, the Rockies have continually sought better pitching and seldom struck the mother lode.

Mandatory Credit: Tim de Frisco /Allsport Getty Images On Nov. 17, 1992, the fledgling franchise made what was universally acclaimed as a bright move by making right-hander David Nied the first pick of the expansion draft. At age 23 that year, he had a 3-0 record and 1.17 ERA as a rookie for the Atlanta Braves. Atlanta already has future Hall of Famers Tom Glavine and John Smoltz in its rotation was negotiating to add a third, which they did two weeks later in Greg Maddux. Nied started the Rockies’ historic first game, a 3-0 loss to the New York Mets. He beat the Mets in his third start, a complete game. He developed a sore arm and pitched in only 30 games the next three years, retiring at age 27. A Never-Ending Search Mike Hampton had a 91-60 record for the Houston Astros and New York Mets over seven seasons. The Rockies signed him to an eight-year, $121 million deal. The lefty went 21-28 with a 5.75 ERA and was traded to Atlanta. The next three years, he had a combined 32-20 record.

Kudos to 1,000 Grandmothers speaking at the Port of Oakland about the distressing signs of global heating. 2024 was the hottest summer on record. The Line and Airport fires burn in Southern California. The heat in Phoenix was unbearable. Air pollution in East Oakland is making the community sick. Flying is the fastest way to fry the planet. Planes burn tons of fuel. Each flight spews hundreds of tons of pollution into our sensitive atmosphere, heating our planet 2-3 times more than ground travel due to high altitude effects. We can’t afford to let airports and air travel expand. Don’t believe the green hype on low-carbon airports; the ground operations are nil compared to the toll of the flights. Sustainable Aviation Fuel currently fuels 0.01% of flights worldwide and there’s not enough cropland to fuel the rest. We’ve got to fly less if we want a livable future. Ariella Granett Berkeley Airport expansion will exacerbate pollution Re: “Plans to expand Oakland airport draw criticism” (Page A1, Sept. 15). I so appreciate the article for keeping our attention on possible airport expansion. I only wish it had been clearer about greenhouse gas emissions. Already aviation is responsible for 11% of Bay Area emissions. Adding 16 gates to the Oakland airport would greatly increase the climate emissions its planes produce. The airport administration likes to draw attention to its plans to reduce emissions caused by ground operations — moving planes around on the ground and attending to them and to passengers. But that constitutes only 1% of the emissions the airport is responsible for by providing facilities for planes to take off and land. It’s a distraction. By modernizing but not expanding, the airport can protect the health of its workers, East Bay residents and the planet. It needs to end mindless growth. It can make Oakland airport a leader to be proud of. Lin Griffith Oakland A vote for Trump is a vote for chaos We are a country known to be a beacon of hope to people all over the world. It pains me to see Donald Trump and JD Vance actively dimming that light and causing needless unjustified suffering. The false “eating cats and dogs” racist accusation by former President Trump against hard-working Haitian immigrants in Springfield, Ohio, was disgraceful. Trump’s rant echoed claims of the most extreme and violent right-wing groups (including neo-Nazis) in a community now terrorized with harassment and bomb threats that are causing schools to close as the people fear for their safety. Enough is enough. Chaos, violence and continuous lies — that is what is in store for all of us if Trump is elected. Please vote to save us from this ordeal. Please think hard before you vote. Your and your children’s well-being will depend on it. Matthew O’Donnell Castro Valley Trump fears another bad debate performance It is painfully obvious why Donald Trump does not want another debate with Kamala Harris. In an embarrassing nationally televised rant, Trump displayed for all to see that he is an angry compulsive liar with no redeeming qualities. His unfitness for office laid bare, the GOP has no time to pivot away from a November disaster. While some predict a close election for president, I sense a sea swell of momentum rising in the Harris-Walz campaign. Positivism and hopefulness will overcome constant chaos, negativity and conspiracy theories. Kamala Harris will become the first woman to serve as a U.S. president and a pitiful, angry old man will skulk back to Mar-a-Lago. We will have moved on. Jon James Pleasanton Pope makes false equivalence in race Trump has been impeached for crimes against our Constitution, convicted in civil court of assault against a woman, and convicted of fraud. His lying rhetoric has led to violence against immigrants. His support of White supremacists makes him a racist without a moral center There is only one evil choice on the ballot: Donald Trump.

The network’s statement came after it declined to directly address allegations—made in an allegedly sworn statement, purportedly by one of its staff—that it helped Harris in the debate. The claims are made in a document which has itself become a viral sensation among MAGA influencers and been amplified by leading Trump allies like Marjorie Taylor Greene. The document was first published Sunday—by an X account with nearly 100,000 followers, and the name “Black Insurrectionist”—as a six-page “affidavit,” which claimed to have been written by an ABC technical worker the day before the debate. The name of the person who signed the document is obscured, but in the six pages they makes claims which—if true—would be explosive. The allegations include that Harris’ team allegedly negotiating specific camera angles to portray her more favorably than Trump. The document also claims the campaign negotiated rules with ABC without involving the Trump team, and it managed to get the network to avoid specific topics including President Joe Biden’s health; Harris’ tenure as “Attorney General in San Francisco”; and her brother-in-law and advisor Tony West. In a statement to the Daily Beast, ABC News did not address any of the specific allegations: “ABC News followed the debate rules that both campaigns agreed on and which clearly state: No topics or questions will be shared in advance with campaigns or candidates.” The alleged whistleblower’s claims have received support and online bolstering from right-wing figures like billionaire Bill Ackman; a pinned post on X by him is an open letter to Disney CEO Robert Iger demanding an investigation into the matter. Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX), and Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-GA) also rushed to amplify the claims. “If this is accurate—and I do not know that it is—it would constitute one of the gravest violations of journalist ethics in presidential debate history,” Cruz wrote on X. “If true, multiple senior people at @abc should be fired.” The existence of the affidavit was first raised by the “Black Insurrectionist” on Thursday which posted that they would be “releasing an affidavit from an ABC News whistleblower regarding the debate.” On the same day, a website called “Leading Report,” which traffics in misinformation, boosted the claim on X that alleged Harris received questions ahead of the debate and received “assurances” only Donald Trump would be fact-checked. Ackman shared that post to his 1.4 million X followers—such as Elon Musk, who responded to the website’s post with “!!” As many conspiracy theories do, it made its way to Trump’s Truth Social feed. ABC categorically denied to The Daily Beast last week that Harris was given any questions ahead of last week’s debate, shooting down one of the talking points that Trump and other right-wingers tried to use to explain the former president’s dismal debate performance. “Absolutely not,” an ABC News spokesperson told The Daily Beast. “Harris was not given any questions before the debate.” The network’s debate rules stated that “no topics or questions will be shared in advance with campaigns or candidates.” The spokesperson also said no aides were in contact with moderators David Muir and Linsey Davis. Trump aides have attacked the moderators as “agents of the Harris campaign” following their efforts, which have been almost universally lauded. A source familiar with the matter also dismissed the purported fact-check “assurances” as untrue. Harris’ campaign did not respond to a request for comment on Monday. The “Black Insurrectionist” account, having grown by nearly 30,000 followers, eventually shared the six-page “affidavit” on Sunday. The document is dated Sept. 9, the day before the debate. The person—whose name, address, and signature are blacked out, other than they live in “Manhattan New York”—alleges they have been with “ABC news” for over 10 years, but they have somehow observed “significant transformations in the nature of news reporting at the organization” since it was acquired by Disney in 1996. The person then makes their claims, including that Harris was given a “significantly smaller podium” than Trump’s and would be given “split-screen television views” that would “favorably” present her better than Trump. It also alleged it was “widely known” throughout ABC that Trump would be fact checked and that Harris’ camp demanded he would be—without looping in his team. It also alleged the network agreed not to raise certain topics, including Biden’s age and allegations that Tony West, an Obama Justice Department official and her brother-in-law, embezzled billions of dollars in “taxpayer funds.” The document also claims to have been verified by a notary public, though the document does not provide a notary seal. An article on a little-known blog indicated the alleged whistleblower had been killed in a car crash before they could unveil the affidavit. That proposition was pushed by Greene on X, who claimed that the whistleblower had died “according to news reports.” She then retracted the claim and demanded a “serious investigation” into the document. Even the Gateway Pundit, a far-right website that delves in misinformation and false stories, warned its readers: “It’s clear to us that this is a complete hoax.” (The “Black Insurrectionist” account later claimed they put the website in touch with the whistleblower’s attorney.) Still, the “Black Insurrectionist” account has doubled down on the claims and has insulted users who’ve cast doubt. When one user questioned why the document had no notary seal, the account responded angrily: “It was notarized you jagoff (sic), it was blocked out. But that's OK more to come on this, even though ABC moderators have started to admit it's true, you can keep groveling.” Even that claim, however, was untrue. The account later cited a Breitbart article that claimed, “Linsey Davis Admits: ‘Fact-checking’ Was Only Planned for Trump.” It pointed to her comments in an Los Angeles Times interview—though Davis never said she wanted to limit her fact checks to Trump, or excuse Harris from fact checks. Instead, Davis said she wanted to make sure fact checks were done because “people were concerned that statements were allowed to just hang and not [be] disputed by the candidate Biden, at the time, or the moderators.”","summary":"Win McNamee/Getty ImagesABC News has again insisted that no topics or questions were shared with either Vice President Kamala Harris or Donald Trump, and their respective campaigns, in advance of last week’s presidential debate.\n\nThe network’s statement came after it declined to directly address allegations—made in an allegedly sworn statement, purportedly by one of its staff—that it helped Harris in the debate.\n\nThe claims are made in a document which has itself become a viral sensation among MAGA influencers and been amplified by leading Trump allies like Marjorie Taylor Greene.\n\nRead more at The Daily Beast.","url":"https://www.thedailybeast.com/abc-news-denies-maga-affadavit-claims-that-it-helped-harris-win-debate","image":"https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1383,w_2459,x_0,y_69/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1726525390/GettyImages-2171258280_esw0ud","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-16 23:28:30","author":"Corbin Bolies","authors":["Corbin Bolies"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.06},{"id":256563396,"title":"Would-be assassin charged","text":"WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. — The man suspected in an apparent assassination attempt targeting Donald Trump camped outside a golf course with food and a rifle for nearly 12 hours, lying in wait for the former president before a Secret Service agent thwarted the potential attack and opened fire, according to court documents. Ryan Wesley Routh did not fire any shots, never had Trump in his line of sight and sped away after being shot at by an agent who spotted him, officials said. He was arrested in a neighboring county. Routh, 58, appeared in federal court in West Palm Beach to face federal firearms charges, starting a criminal case in the final weeks of a presidential race already touched by violence and upheaval. Though no one was injured, the episode marked the second attempt on Trump’s life in as many months, raising questions about the security provided to him during a time of amped-up political rhetoric and what the Secret Service chief called an “unprecedented and hyper-dynamic threat environment.” Even as Trump’s Republican allies and some Democrats demanded answers about how a would-be shooter was able to get so close to Trump, Ronald Rowe Jr., the Secret Service’s acting director, offered a fiery defense of the agents he said were “rising to this moment” despite needing additional resources. “Right now, we are redlining them, and they are rising to this moment, and they are meeting the challenges right now,” Rowe said, citing recent political conventions and other major events that required protective details. Authorities continued to examine Routh’s potential motive and movements in the days and weeks leading up to Sunday, when a Secret Service agent assigned to Trump’s security detail spotted a firearm poking out of shrubbery on the West Palm Beach golf course where Trump was playing. The agent fired, and Routh escaped into a sport utility, leaving behind a digital camera, a backpack, a loaded SKS-style assault rifle and a plastic bag containing food. He had been at the golf course’s tree line from 1:59 a.m. to 2:31 p.m., according to an FBI affidavit that cited cellphone data. The FBI is continuing to investigate how long the Hawaii man had been in Florida, said Jeffrey Veltri, the special agent in charge of the FBI’s Miami field office. Body camera footage posted Monday on Facebook by the Martin County sheriff’s office showed Routh’s arrest. The video shows him walking backward with his hands over his head on the side of a road before being handcuffed and led away by law enforcement. Coming just weeks after a July shooting at a Pennsylvania campaign rally in which Trump was wounded by a gunman’s bullet, the latest assassination attempt accelerated concerns that violence continues to infect American presidential politics. Both President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris, Trump’s challenger in the November election, denounced the thwarted attack, with Harris saying in a post on X: “I am glad he is safe. Violence has no place in America.” “We will work tirelessly to ensure accountability, and we will bring every available resource to bear in this investigation,” Attorney General Merrick Garland said in a statement. The FBI has interviewed family members, friends and colleagues and has served a battery of search warrants to collect evidence. No motive has been disclosed, and Routh invoked his right to an attorney when questioned. Authorities did not immediately reveal any new details about Routh’s background or allege a particular motive in charging documents. Investigators are also examining Routh’s large online footprint, which suggests a man of evolving political viewpoints, culminating in an apparent disdain for Trump and intense outrage at global events concerning China and especially Ukraine. One of the two counts he faces alleges that he illegally possessed his gun in spite of multiple felony convictions, including two charges of possessing stolen goods in 2002 in North Carolina. The other charge alleges that the serial number was obliterated and unreadable to the naked eye, in violation of federal law. Routh was ordered held after prosecutors argued that he was a flight risk, with additional hearings set for later this month. He spoke in a soft voice as he answered perfunctory questions from a federal magistrate, saying that he was working and making around $3,000 a month, but has zero savings. Routh said that he has no real estate or assets, aside from two trucks worth about $1,000, both located in Hawaii. He also said that he has a 25-year-old son, whom he sometimes supports. Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, one of Trump’s rivals in the GOP primary, said his state will conduct its own investigation into how Routh was able to get so close. “I understand that the feds are involved but we do believe that there were multiple violations of state law. We also believe that there’s a need to make sure that the truth about all this comes out in a way, you know, that’s credible,” he said during a news conference Monday morning. “I mean I look at the federal government, with all due respect to them, those same agencies that are prosecuting Trump in that jurisdiction are now going to be investigating this?”","summary":"The man suspected in an apparent assassination attempt targeting Donald Trump camped outside a golf course with food and a rifle for nearly 12 hours, lying in wait for the former president before a Secret Service agent thwarted the potential attack and opened fire, according to court documents filed Monday.","url":"https://www.bostonherald.com/2024/09/16/would-be-assassin-charged/","image":"https://www.bostonherald.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/GettyImages-2171592164.jpg?w=1024","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-16 23:26:12","author":"Associated Press","authors":["Associated Press"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.403},{"id":256563850,"title":"Officials give new details on apparent Trump assassination attempt","text":"Officials give new details on apparent Trump assassination attempt Ryan Wesley Routh, the suspect in what officials are calling an apparent assassination attempt of former President Donald Trump, is facing two federal gun charges after U.S. Secret Service agents allegedly saw the muzzle of his automatic rifle poking out from the shrubbery along Trump's golf course in Palm Beach, Florida.

The governor, meanwhile, said resources would be surged to Springfield to help city officials deal with the fallout. Springfield’s two-day CultureFest, which highlights diversity, arts and culture, had been scheduled to begin Sept. 27 but was canceled “in light of recent threats and safety concerns,” the city announced. “We deeply regret having to cancel CultureFest, as we know it is a beloved event for our community,” City Manager Bryan Heck said in a statement. “However, the safety of our residents and visitors must come first.” Springfield has been the focus of intense attention in recent days after former President Donald Trump, his running mate JD Vance and their Republican presidential campaign have amplified false and debunked claims about Haitian immigrants eating domestic pets and waterfowl. Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine, a Republican, has denounced the false rumors, saying there is no evidence of it. He said at a news conference in Springfield on Monday that dozens of members of the Ohio State Highway Patrol will be stationed in Springfield schools starting Tuesday, sweeping each building every morning before the arrival of faculty or students. Security cameras have also been stationed at various spots in the city. Springfield City Hall, several schools and state motor vehicle offices in Springfield were forced to evacuate last week after receiving bomb threats. At least 33 separate bomb threats were made in recent days, all of them hoaxes, DeWine said. He said some of the threats came from overseas, but he declined to name the country. “We cannot let the bad guys win. Our schools must remain open. They are going to remain open,” DeWine said. Two colleges in Springfield held classes virtually Monday. Wittenberg University said it received two threats over the weekend, “both of which were targeted toward members of the Haitian Community.” Clark State College said it would operate virtually through Friday “due to recent events in Springfield.” Thousands of Haitian immigrants have settled in recent years in the predominantly white, blue-collar city of about 60,000, about 45 miles from the state capital of Columbus, where they have found work in factories and warehouses that had been struggling to fill job openings. The sudden influx has strained schools, health care facilities and city services and driven up the cost of housing. President Biden, appearing in Philadelphia at the National HBCU Week Conference on Monday, addressed the situation in Springfield, condemning what he called the “lies and hate.” “It’s wrong. It’s simply wrong. And it must stop,” he said.","summary":"Springfield City Hall, several schools and state motor vehicle offices in Springfield were forced to evacuate last week after receiving bomb threats.","url":"https://www.centralmaine.com/2024/09/16/ohio-town-cancels-cultural-festival-after-furor-over-haitians/","image":"https://w2pcms.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2024/09/Haitian_Immigrants_Springfield_00954.jpg?w=1000","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-16 23:24:43","author":"Patrick Aftoora Orsagos And Michael Rubinkam,PATRICK AFTOORA ORSAGOS and MICHAEL RUBINKAM - Associated Press","authors":["Patrick Aftoora Orsagos And Michael Rubinkam","PATRICK AFTOORA ORSAGOS and MICHAEL RUBINKAM - Associated Press"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.278},{"id":256563786,"title":"Let’s make a big change in our approach.","text":"The acting Secret Service director says the agency needs to undergo a complete overhaul of how it protects presidents — a remarkable admission following the second attempt on former President Donald Trump’s life in the past two months. “Coming out of Butler, I have ordered a paradigm shift,” Ronald Rowe said at a press conference Monday, referring to the assassination attempt in Butler, Pennsylvania, in July. “The Secret Service’s protective methodologies work and they are sound, and we saw that yesterday.” But, he added, “We need to get out of a reactive model, and get to a readiness model.” Rowe did not go into detail about his vision for the nearly 160-year-old agency. His comments come at a pivotal moment for the Secret Service. The agency has been under heavy scrutiny since a gunman managed to fire several rounds at Trump at the rally in Pennsylvania, striking his ear, in what was the Secret Service’s biggest security failure since President Ronald Reagan was shot and wounded in 1981. One person was killed at the July 13 rally, and two others were injured. The incident on Sunday, which the FBI called an apparent attempted assassination of Trump, unfolded at his golf club in West Palm Beach, Florida, after a Secret Service agent spotted a rifle poking out of the bushes outside the course, according to officials. The suspect, Ryan Wesley Routh, 58, had been in the vicinity for nearly 12 hours, according to a criminal complaint. Routh was taken into custody later Sunday and charged with federal gun crimes. The Trump campaign asked the Secret Service for increased security on Monday morning, two sources familiar with the request told NBC News. It’s not clear how the Secret Service has responded to that request. When asked about it, Rowe sidestepped the question. “I’ve had a conversation with the former president,” he said. “The president is aware that he has the highest levels of protection that the Secret Service provides.” “We constantly evaluate based on threat,” he added. “If we need to ratchet it up additionally, we will.” The Secret Service has dramatically increased Trump’s security since the shooting on July 13, according to two sources familiar with the agency’s response. The increased security includes more people and more technology. One said the Secret Service is doing all it can to protect Trump while also preparing for the United Nations General Assembly next week and protecting President Joe Biden, Sen. J.D. Vance, Vice President Kamala Harris, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz and other protectees. That source said that additional resources would require additional funding from Congress. Rowe conceded as much at the press conference. “The Secret Service operates under a paradox of zero fail mission but also that we have done more with less for decades,” he said. “And this goes back many, many decades. What I can tell you is we have immediate needs right now.” Protecting the former president at an outdoor venue like a golf course poses particular challenges, especially when Trump makes an impromptu decision to play a few holes. But multiple former FBI agents questioned how a man was able to take a position so close to the former president and stay hidden there for so long. “That to me is really unsettling,” said Evy Poumpouras, a former Secret Service agent who protected multiple presidents, including Barack Obama and George W. Bush, during her 12 years with the agency. “How did he get there, take that position for 12 hours and nobody saw that? Nobody did a perimeter sweep?” she added in an interview on MSNBC. The Secret Service is chronically understaffed: The arm of the agency that protects presidents, vice presidents and their families is nearly 10% smaller than it was a decade ago. Yet while the requests for extra personnel and equipment from Trump’s agents have been repeatedly declined over the past two years, no resource requests were denied for the Pennsylvania rally where Trump was shot, a Secret Service official told NBC News in July. The problem does not appear to be a financial issue: government filings show the Secret Service’s budget nearly doubled over the last decade while staffing agencywide rose by nearly 25%. Anthony Cangelosi, a former Secret Service agent who has worked on protective details for presidential candidates, including Sen. John Kerry in 2004, said it was “pretty clear at this point that we need extra personnel for President Trump.” “If this had been President Biden and he was golfing on the golf course, there would be a several-block security buffer around that golf course,” he said on Monday. “Yes, former presidents don’t get that same level of protection, but that level of protection adjusts based on known threat level.” “Why at this point, seven weeks out from an election, a major presidential candidate doesn’t have additional security personnel to secure the perimeter of his golf course?” Cangelosi added. “That’s the question that should be asked at this point.”","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nThe acting Secret Service director says the agency needs to undergo a&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Let&#8217;s make a big change in our approach. first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/news/us/lets-make-a-big-change-in-our-approach/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/rewrite-this-title-We-need-a-‘paradigm-shift.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-16 23:21:45","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.392},{"id":256564832,"title":"Judge rejects former Trump aide Mark Meadows’ bid to move Arizona election case to federal court","text":"By JACQUES BILLEAUD PHOENIX (AP) — A judge has rejected a bid by Mark Meadows, a former chief of staff to President Donald Trump, to move his charges in Arizona’s fake elector case to federal court, marking the second time he has failed in trying to get his charges out of state court. In a decision Monday, U.S. District Judge John Tuchi said Meadows missed a deadline for asking for his charges to be moved to federal court, didn’t offer a good reason for doing so and failed to show that the allegations against him related to his official duties as chief of staff to the president. Meadows faces charges in Arizona and Georgia in what authorities allege was an illegal scheme to overturn the 2020 election results in Trump’s favor. He had unsuccessfully tried to move charges in the Georgia case last year. It’s unknown whether Meadows will appeal the decision. The Associated Press left phone and email messages for two of Meadows’ attorneys. While not a fake elector in Arizona, prosecutors said Meadows, while chief of staff, worked with other Trump campaign members to submit names of fake electors from Arizona and other states to Congress in a bid to keep Trump in office despite his November 2020 defeat. Meadows has pleaded not guilty to the charges in Arizona and Georgia. In 2020, Democrat Joe Biden won Arizona by 10,457 votes. The decision sends Meadows’ case back down to Maricopa County Superior Court. In both Arizona and Georgia, Meadows argued his charges should be moved to federal court because his actions were taken when he was a federal official working as Trump’s chief of staff and that he has immunity under the supremacy clause of the U.S. Constitution, which says federal law trumps state law. Arizona prosecutors said Meadows’ electioneering efforts weren’t part of his official duties at the White House. Meadows last year tried to get his Georgia charges moved but his request was rejected by a judge whose ruling was later affirmed by an appeals court. Meadows has since asked the U.S. Supreme Court to review the ruling. The Arizona indictment says Meadows confided to a White House staff member in early November 2020 that Trump had lost the election. Prosecutors say Meadows also had arranged meetings and calls with state officials to discuss the fake elector conspiracy. Meadows and other defendants are seeking a dismissal of the Arizona case. Meadows’ attorneys said nothing their client is alleged to have done in Arizona was criminal. They said the indictment consists of allegations that he received messages from people trying to get ideas in front of Trump — or “seeking to inform Mr. Meadows about the strategy and status of various legal efforts by the president’s campaign.” In all, 18 Republicans were charged in late April in Arizona’s fake electors case. The defendants include 11 Republicans who had submitted a document falsely claiming Trump had won Arizona, another Trump aide and five lawyers connected to the former president. In August, Trump’s campaign attorney Jenna Ellis, who worked closely with former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani, signed a cooperation agreement with prosecutors that led to the dismissal of her charges. Republican activist Loraine Pellegrino became the first person to be convicted in the Arizona case when she pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor charge and was sentenced to probation. The remaining defendants have pleaded not guilty to the forgery, fraud and conspiracy charges in Arizona. Trump wasn’t charged in Arizona, but the indictment refers to him as an unindicted coconspirator. The 11 people who were nominated to be Arizona’s Republican electors met in Phoenix on Dec. 14, 2020, to sign a certificate saying they were “duly elected and qualified” electors and claimed Trump had carried the state.

Home, for the author of the new novel “Guide Me Home” — the final installment in a critically acclaimed trilogy of crime novels — is Los Angeles, where she lives, and where she wrote and produced for series including “Empire” and “Little Fires Everywhere.” Home is also East Texas, where she was born and raised, and where her Highway 59 series of novels takes place. The trilogy, which started in 2017 with the award-winning “Bluebird, Bluebird,” and continued two years after that with “Heaven, My Home,” follows Darren Mathews, a Black Texas Ranger with a complicated life. “Guide Me Home” finds Mathews investigating the disappearance of a college student while navigating America under President Donald Trump. : Bestsellers, authors, books and more can be found in the Books section “The whole thing is about home for me because it’s about my East Texas roots,” Locke says of her latest novel. “It’s a literal home in that I was born and raised in Houston, but I also mean home in the sense of home, my best self; home, where my integrity lies; home, where my fortitude lies; home, where my courage lies.” There’s a reason, Locke says, that the word “home” appears in two of the novels’ titles. “Home for me represents all of these things,” she explains. “It is a literal place in the world, and it’s a figurative container for my value system, the East Texas values I was raised with. But it’s also a place inside of me where I know who I am and I know my voice and I know what I’m trying to say.” Locke answered questions about “Guide Me Home” via telephone from Los Angeles. This conversation has been edited and condensed for clarity and length. Q: How did it feel to write again about Darren Mathews? Like going home, so to speak. The thing about this series is that it kind of inadvertently became a comment on the Trump era in a way that I had not intended as an artist. When I wrote “Bluebird, Bluebird,” he was running for office, but I didn’t think he would become president, and I don’t think any of us could have predicted a lot of the things that happened on the other side of his election: insurrections and the pandemic and George Floyd and all these things. What this book series gave me is a space to kind of process my feelings about what’s been going on in our country. In that sense, there was a way to return to a space where I could process where we are, at what I hope is the end of the Trump era. So in that sense, it was good. I had all the nerves, I will say, because I had not intended this book series to be a trilogy. I made that decision at some point during the pandemic lockdown. I thought it was going to be a book series that would go on for a while, at least five books. But during lockdown, the third book in the series, I actually wanted to go to Laredo. Laredo is a town on the U.S.-Mexican border that’s also off Highway 59. And I’m sitting during lockdown where none of us knows if we’re ever leaving our house again. I thought, “Well, I can’t research that. I have no way of going to Laredo to even get a sense of the place, so that feels like something I can’t do.” I started to think that I could be writing Darren Mathews until I’m 70 because the space between the books felt like it was growing. So I just got this sense that I wanted to close it out where it began in rural East Texas. And that’s when I knew I wanted this last book to be the final book, and that it would be a trilogy. Q: East Texas really is a whole other world. I would say that was part of the fun of the book. What I mean by that is it is something to have your culture represented in literature. I think everybody at some point has felt this before. I think there are young people who discover queer YA and then feel seen, and feel like, “My way of looking at the world, the way that I live in my body, the way that I love, is being represented in literature.” And I think this is a part of Texas from a Black perspective that I don’t feel like had really been written down, or at least I wanted to add my little piece to it. So there was actually great pleasure luxuriating and inviting people into this very particular subculture in Texas. I felt like I was writing a love letter to Black Texas. Q: You grew up in Houston. Did you frequently go up and down Highway 59 when you were a kid? Absolutely. I have said before that I became a writer on Highway 59 because I was always a daydreaming kind of kid. All of my people on my mom’s side, my dad’s side, going back to slavery, they all come from little towns off of this one highway in East Texas. So I spent a good part of my childhood going up and down to all these little towns visiting people, and there were no cell phones back then. I’m just sitting in the back seat looking at the kind of craggy woods and the pine trees and the bayou and the creeks and people selling stuff out of their trailer. It’s just a kind of rural fantasia, as I’ve called it. SEE ALSO: Sign up for our free Book Pages newsletter about bestsellers, authors and more Q: When you were writing “Bluebird,” did you end up doing a lot of research into the Texas Rangers? I did, because I didn’t really know what they did. [Laughs.] I lived in Texas for the first 18 years of my life and have visited numerous times. I’ve seen Texas Rangers in the wild one time because there’s just not that many of them. When you see them in the wild, it’s like you kind of gasp because it’s just the iconography of the hat and the badge and the whole thing. I was very, very lucky in that there was a gentleman who worked for the Rangers, Kip Westmoreland, who was willing to do an interview with me. And then I read a lot of books about Rangers and a lot of contemporary reporting about Rangers. The Dallas Morning News has done a lot of great reporting, the Houston Chronicle, Texas Monthly. And that’s when I learned that they’re like an FBI for Texas. And when I learned about the work that they had been doing to take down the Aryan Brotherhood of Texas, that felt like just a ripe playground to find a story.

Trump's known to poll worse than he performs in elections and he's greatly expanded his lead with white evangelicals over the years, a key voting group for the Republican candidate.FiveThirtyEight's polling average gives Harris a 3-point advantage over Trump, slightly above former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton's 1.6 lead in 2016. In 2020, Biden had a nearly 7-point advantage at the same point in the election.\"Generally speaking Trump is currently polling between where he was in '16 and '20 as Election Day approached. That could change. The more it tightens up in the swing states—not nationally—the more likely he is to win,\" Michael Gordon, a principal at The Gordon Group and a Democratic strategist, told Newsweek.Polling from the New York Times paints a similar picture of the race. In 2020, Biden had an 8-point lead in September, a significantly greater lead than Clinton's 2-point lead in 2016. Harris is currently trailing Trump by 2 points, according to a New York Times poll from September 8.The poll was conducted before the presidential debate and Nate Cohn, chief political analyst for the New York Times noted that Harris leads in the New York Times polling average. Harris was widely regarded as the winner of the presidential debate and he noted it could be another week before any post-debate bump is realized in polls. However, it's possible the benefit she may have gotten from the debate could be tempered if people turn their attention to Sunday's assassination attempt on Trump instead of the debate.After the July shooting at Trump's rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, many expected Trump to see a major boost in his polling like other presidents had after assassination attempts. Trump got promising news from some polls in the wake of the shooting, but overall, it didn't create a massive surge in support for him.Since 2020, Trump's increased his appeal with both men and women. Men were split evenly between Biden and Trump at this point in the 2020 election, but now, Trump has a 7-point lead over Harris with men, according to New York Times polling. Marist polling indicates a similar trend. In 2016, Trump had an 11-point advantage with male voters and in 2020, that lead shrunk to a 4-point lead. It's since increased to a 12-point lead, according to a September Marist poll.Harris still has a commanding lead when it comes to female voters, with a 15-point advantage over Trump. However, that's lower than Biden's 22-point lead at this point in the election and Clinton's 20-point advantage, according to Marist polling.Sabrina Karim, an associate professor at Cornell University, said in July she expects the gap between male and female voters to \"become starker\" as the election gets closer.\"Younger female voters might be more attracted to Vice President Harris, who stands in strong opposition to the hyper-masculine personality and policies of the Trump-Vance ticket. She appeals to younger women, who don't want to lose their rights and see in Harris someone who will fight for them,\" Karim said.Ross K. Baker, a professor of political science at Rutgers University, told The Hill that Minnesota Governor Tim Walz, Harris' vice president pick, could help her win over male voters. Seen as a \"man's man,\" Baker said Walz is the type of person who could connect with male voters who feel alienated by policies that have been \"very much tilted in favor of women.\"Trump prided himself on being the \"most pro-life president\" in America's history and evangelicals were critical of his 2016 election victory. He's taken credit for the overturning of Roe v. Wade because of his Supreme Court justice nominees and he's seen his support among evangelicals increase since the 2016 election. His support among white evangelicals went from 73 percent in 2016, down to 70 percent in 2020, according to Marist polling. That support has since jumped to 82 percent, according to a September Marist poll.The Republican candidate is expected to retain his evangelical supporters, but he's sparked some anger among the key voting bloc as he tries to soften his stance on abortion.\"It's disastrous that he's attempted to run against his own track record,\" said Albert Mohler, a prominent evangelical and head of the Southern Baptist Theological Seminary, told Politico. \"There is a real danger to the Trump campaign that pro-life voters just don't turn out for him with the intensity that he needs.\"Trump said last week that he'll vote no in November on the ballot measure that would enshrine abortion rights in Florida after implying he may vote to overturn the state's six-week abortion ban.Going too far on the issue of abortion, though, runs the risk of Trump losing the more moderate voters he needs to win in critical swing states.While polling can give an insight into the presidential election, Gordon said Trump's changed the game when it comes to predicting who will win.\"Among other things in the current political era, Trump has upended modern presidential polling. Both in 2016 when he won and 2020 when he lost, Trump outperformed the polls leading up to Election Day,\" Gordon said.","summary":"Trump's upended presidential polling and he finds himself somewhere between his standing in 2016 and in 2020.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/donald-trump-presidential-polls-election-2024-1954820","image":"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2473005/donald-trump-polling-50-days-out-election.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-16 23:08:38","author":"Jenni Fink","authors":["Jenni Fink"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.304},{"id":256564186,"title":"Interviewing Would-Be Trump Assassin Was ‘Like a Scene Out of a Coen Brothers Movie,’ Reporter Says","text":"Reporter Tanya Lukyanova said interviewing Donald Trump’s would-be assassin Ryan Routh felt like talking to a character from a Coen Brothers movie. Lukyanova, who writes for the The Free Press, spoke with Routh a year ago about his desire for America to do more in the war in Ukraine. She explained to Fox News on Monday that even back then the interview had a weird energy. “He seemed off,” Lukyanova said. “If you look at the video interview it looks like the scene out of a Coen Brothers movie. He seems distraught, but then at the same time he wasn’t even the most colorful of the personalities that I spoke to as part of the story.” When asked if the man expressed any political views during the interview, Lukyanova said it was mostly just support for the Ukrainian cause and advocating for the U.S. to do more. Watch the full interview with Fox News, below. She went into a bit more detail while talking to her publication The Free Press about the interaction. Routh reminded her specifically of Brad Pitt’s character from “Burn After Reading” – a personal trainer who thinks he can pull off blackmailing a CIA analyst. “A guy who is overzealous and goes a little overboard on the conspiratorial side of things,” she said. “But until he does something terribly wrong, nobody quite thinks of him that way.” Routh – a 58-year-old who was apprehended Sunday under suspicion of making a second assassination attempt against Trump – was allegedly pointing a rifle through a fence that was 300-500 yards away from the former president at Trump International golf course in West Palm Beach, Florida. On Monday, he was charged with possession of a firearm as a convicted felon and possessing a firearm with an obliterated serial number.","summary":"\"He reminds me of Brad Pitt in ‘Burn After Reading,'\" Free Press reporter Tanya Lukyanova shares of Ryan Routh\n\n\nThe post Interviewing Would-Be Trump Assassin Was ‘Like a Scene Out of a Coen Brothers Movie,’ Reporter Says appeared first on TheWrap.","url":"https://www.thewrap.com/trump-assassin-ryan-routh-reporter-interview/","image":"https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Routh2.png","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-16 23:07:35","author":"Jacob Bryant","authors":["Jacob Bryant"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.067},{"id":256562834,"title":"Trump golf club workers questioned by feds about whether they told friends ex-president would be there","text":"Federal agents investigating the latest assassination attempt against Donald Trump asked staffers at his West Palm Beach golf course whether they shared sensitive information with outsiders about when the former president would be at the club, The Post has learned. The workers at Trump International Golf Course were questioned by the feds after Ryan Wesley Routh, 58, hid outside the property for 12 hours in a sniper’s nest before he was spotted by Secret Service agents as the 45th president was golfing Sunday. Members of the FBI and Secret Service “asked a couple questions about who I tell when President Trump is here,” a golf club employee told The Post Monday. “They asked everyone if we tell our friends when he comes and goes,” the worker said. Federal authorities asked the employees if they recognized Routh, the would-be assassin who has since been hit with federal gun charges after lurking outside the course with an AK-style assault rifle. No one claimed to have recognized Routh in any of the pictures they were shown, the employee said. “Everyone was actually really nice to us; they said that we weren’t suspected of anything and they made sure I wasn’t too shaken up when they started talking to me,” the staffer continued. The FBI and Secret Service worked in tandem to interview everyone at the club around the time of the assassination attempt. Employees interviewed by the Post were adamant that they had followed their usual protocols, which include a strict phone and photography ban. “It’s a firing offense to be on our phones at work, and even worse if we take pictures of President Trump. A lot of people leave their phones in their car just so they can’t possibly get in trouble for it,” an employee said. “They’ve told us for a long time that we are putting him in danger if we text a friend to say that he’s here, even if the friends are fans of him. So I have never once done that, and I don’t think a lot of my coworkers have either.” The golf club staff were largely isolated from one another and were not permitted to use their phones when they were interviewed. Club directors surveyed the perimeter of the golf green on Sunday and are planning to plant more bushes and trees on the outskirts to close any gaps that could be used to look into the property, like the opening used by Routh. Following Sunday’s scare, the club was swarming with at least 100 to 150 agents from the FBI and Secret Service, an employee said. The club had already been busy before the assassination attempt, since Sundays are typically its best day of the week and additional high-profile members tend to come out when Trump is expected to be on the property. The employee estimated that there were roughly 60 other staff on the property and around 100 other visitors around the time the attempt took place. While there are no metal detectors, security carries wands to search people who enter the grounds. Sometimes, Trump’s friends will be permitted to enter without being checked with his permission, the employee claimed. The staff anticipates that there will be a greater emphasis placed on security at the club in the future, including new mandatory training. “It’s not just the president who golfs here. A lot of important people are here, businesspeople and big donors. So we all have to keep our eyes open for any threats,” the employee said. “They’re making it clear that you can be a maintenance worker or kitchen help, and you still are responsible to take security seriously. If you see something, say something. That’s going to be drilled into us, I think.”","summary":"Federal agents investigating the latest assassination attempt against Donald Trump asked staffers at his West Palm Beach golf course whether they shared sensitive information with outsiders about when the former president would be at the club, The Post has learned.

Sunday’s “aborted shooting raises questions” on the Secret Service’s “ability — and willingness — to protect Donald Trump.” “If this were a systemic issue” with the agency, “then why would Trump be the only candidate subject to not just one but two attempts?” Yet, “we have seen virtually no journalistic task forces” and “no searing investigations into the Secret Service.” Worse, “a precedent is being set where political violence against a candidate” who’s “been positioned by the media as an imminent threat to American democracy itself is met with a collective shrug.” Foreign desk: Stop Covering for Russia “Pulsed microwave standoff attacks by Russian military intelligence operatives” caused traumatic brain injuries to his family, notes Mark Lenzi at The Hill — for which “the U.S. government has paid my family more than $1 million.” The attacks “caused panic in Washington but have since been buried and the details withheld from Congress.” “The greatest disappointment”? The government “completely turned its back on me and my family.” “The American people have a right to know which country caused the injuries for which their tax dollars have compensated us.” Yet “the State Department and the Intelligence Community have gone to incredible lengths to try to silence me, to prevent me” from briefing Congress. Legislators “need to hear the truth to serve your constituents as they deserve.” Culture critic: Race Grifters Exposed “To see how debased ‘progressives’ have become, behold Robin DiAngelo stumping up 30 bucks in ‘reparations’ to an African-American gent,” snarks Spiked’s Brendan O’Neill of a scene “in Matt Walsh’s new film, Am I Racist?, a Borat-style mockumentary that sends up race grifters.” DiAngelo offered “a grovelling apology: ‘It is not you, it is us.” “This is the irony of the white shame that is so à la mode in cultural circles: it hides a new species of white pride, where educated whites fancy themselves as morally superior to both unlearned white people and pained black people.” “Black people and white people could find great common cause in opposing this top-down racialism that dehumanises us all” — and should unite to “tell DiAngelo and her dwindling band of acolytes where to stick it.” From the right: SCOTUS’ ‘Internal’ Attackers “Political attacks on the Supreme Court are escalating,” warn The Wall Street Journal’s editors — with “the latest” coming from a New York Times story that claims Chief Justice John Roberts steered the court to help Donald Trump. The piece minimizes constitutional arguments while highlighting “political benefits” to Trump, to make the court seem political. Yet most “damaging” are the leaks about internal discussions, which bear “the possible fingerprints of one or more” justices. A “larger progressive political campaign” seeks to undermine the court’s credibility “to justify Democratic legislation” that’ll “destroy its independence,” and the possibility of court insiders participating “is all the more worrying.” We’re at “a dangerous juncture in American constitutional history” — and Trump isn’t the “greatest” risk. Libertarian: Colleges Fail on Free Speech 101 “The actions of some” anti-Israel student protesters, “coupled with the reactions of some administrators, highlight a troubling lack of understanding of free speech principles,” argues John Bitzan at Reason. Per a “recent survey of college students nationwide,” “politically liberal students” show “the highest acceptance of anti-free speech actions”: 55% “think it is OK to disrupt campus by occupying buildings,” 37% deem it OK “to disrupt class with protests,” 26% say it’s “acceptable to shout down a speaker.” And 62% “of all students” believe that “professors should be reported for making controversial statements” on political issues. Schools must “stand firm and defend students’ rights to express their views,” but “ also need to teach students the limits of free speech: Violence, disrupting campus activities, shouting down speakers one disagrees with, and intimidating or harassing others are not free speech.” — Compiled by The Post Editorial Board","summary":"“It’s difficult to overstate how extraordinary it is to have two assassination attempts against a former president and presidential candidate coming within weeks of each other,” remarks Ashley Rindsberg at UnHerd.","url":"https://nypost.com/2024/09/16/opinion/medias-shrug-at-assassins-race-grifters-exposed-and-other-commentary/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/09/2024-donald-trump-hit-ear-85423274_553c83-e1726525986921.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-16 23:05:09","author":"Post Editorial Board","authors":["Post Editorial Board"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.328},{"id":256563398,"title":"Alleged Trump Gunman Was My Hawaii Pickleball Partner","text":"Before Ryan Wesley Routh allegedly became the second man to try and kill Donald Trump in as many months, he was something else entirely: A fiend on the pickleball court. “He was a reasonably good player. He played really hard,” Bryant Schultz told The Daily Beast in a phone interview. “He was the only one out at the courts who would dive for the ball. Most pickleball players do not dive to make a shot.” Schultz, 62, of Kaneohe, Oahu, played frequently with Routh, 58, over a period of several years as part of a loose coalition of residents who showed up at Swanzy Beach Park three mornings a week to get their pickleball on. Both on and off the court, Routh was “always personable and good-natured,” Schultz said, as well as chatty, on friendly terms with many of the park’s regulars. Hard on himself when he made mistakes, he never chastised his partners. “Except for his own errors, he was the most mild-mannered player out there.” Routh first appeared at the park after the worst of the pandemic had passed, Schultz recalled. “He never appeared to have a bunch of money,” he said. “He was often borrowing paddles. For quite a while, he played with a really chewed-up wooden paddle—because of his dive, you know.” During a federal court appearance on Monday, Routh was charged with two firearm possession counts. He told the court that he had “zero funds” in savings and had no assets beyond two trucks in Hawaii, according to CNN. It wasn’t totally clear to his teammates what Routh did for a living. Schultz heard that he “worked on building tiny houses” and would do odd-job repairs around the community, including on a local pier. “He wasn’t paid or contracted,” as far as Schultz knew, he said. “He just went out and made the surface safe for people to walk on.” On his LinkedIn page, which remained live on Monday, Routh advertised his work with a company called Camp Box Honolulu, which he wrote builds storage units and “very simple housing structures for the less fortunate.” In 2019, a year after Routh moved to Oahu, the Honolulu Star-Advertiser reported that he’d pledged to build tiny homes for Kalaeloa’s homeless community. One thing Routh didn’t appear to be—at least on the pickleball court—was political. “I can’t recall him ever talking politics,” Schultz said. He’d had no idea Routh had self-published a 291-page book last year in which he called for Trump’s assassination, criticizing the former president for his 2018 withdrawal from the Iran nuclear deal. (Authorities have not yet laid out a possible motive in Sunday’s assassination attempt.) In a section apparently directed at Iran’s government, Routh wrote, “You are free to assassinate Trump as well as me for that error in judgment and the dismantling of the deal,” according to The Wall Street Journal. “No one here in the US seems to have the balls to put natural selection to work or even unnatural selection.” Routh has a scattered political history tracing back to his time in his native North Carolina, where he registered as an “unaffiliated” voter in 2012. In his book, he groused that he was “so tired of people asking me if I am a Democrat or Republican as I refuse to be put in a category and I must always answer independent.” On social media, he had professed support for Bernie Sanders, Tulsi Gabbard, President Joe Biden, and Trump, whom he disavowed in mid-2020. “I and the world hoped that president Trump would be different and better than the candidate, but we all were greatly disappointment and it seems you are getting worse and devolving…” he tweeted that June. “I will be glad when you gone.” Schultz and his fellow picklers were aware, however, that Routh left Hawaii for Ukraine shortly after the Russian invasion, intent on fighting for Kyiv. With no military experience and a lengthy criminal record, however, Routh was rebuffed by the Ukrainian defense ministry, he told Newsweek Romania in an article recently unearthed by CBS News. “My initial goal was to come fight… but I’m 56, so initially they were like, I have no military experience, so they were like, you're not an ideal candidate,” he told the magazine. “So they said, not right this minute. So plan B was to come here to Kyiv and promote getting more people here.” Routh spent some time in the city trying to act as an informal recruiter for Ukraine’s International Legion, and spoke to both The New York Times and Semafor last year about his efforts. But several foreign soldiers involved with the legion told Slate on Sunday night that Routh “was not associated with them, recruited nobody to the cause, and did little during his time in Ukraine aside from garner publicity for himself.” In a statement to NBC News, a spokesperson for the legion said, “We would like to clarify that Ryan Wesley Routh has never been part of, associated with, or linked to the International Legion in any capacity. Any claims or suggestions indicating otherwise are entirely inaccurate.” After failing in his recruitment efforts, Routh eventually made his way back to Hawaii, where he took up pickleball again. The last time Schultz saw him was around four or five weeks before the assassination attempt, he said. Nothing seemed out of the ordinary; it was just another day on the court.","summary":"Photo Illustration by Thomas Levinson/The Daily Beast/GettyBefore Ryan Wesley Routh allegedly became the second man to try and kill Donald Trump in as many months, he was something else entirely: A fiend on the pickleball court.\n\n“He was a reasonably good player.

Ryan Routh, the suspect who hid in the bushes at Trump’s West Palm Beach golf club waiting for his shot at former ex-president — AK-47-style rifled at the ready, serial number filed off — wasn’t some 20-year-old without a political paper trail, like the first would-be assassin, Thomas Crooks. Routh, 58, “frequently posted about politics” on X and other social media, had a Biden-Harris sticker on his truck, “and exclusively donated to Democratic candidates and causes dating back to 2019,” The Post reports. He even featured in a New York Times story last year highlighting his efforts to recruit Afghan soldiers to fight against Russia in Ukraine. Willing to fight in Ukraine himself — though the Ukrainians didn’t want him or his dubious recruits — Routh wanted to be a man of action, and he was prepared to kill for a cause. But if the cause of democracy in Ukraine was worth killing for, what about the safety of democracy right here in America? Routh took both literally and seriously Democrats and progressives who say Trump is a threat to America’s institutions and the rule of law itself. “DEMOCRACY is on the ballot and we cannot lose,” Routh wrote in a tweet to President Biden in April. You can’t lose if your opponent is dead — and if democracy itself is in danger, what conclusion can a desperate man of action draw? Instead of moderating their rhetoric, Trump’s critics only doubled down after the first assassination attempt. Days after the shooting, the anti-Trump Lincoln Project was again comparing Trump to Hitler. On July 19, Democratic Sen. Martin Heinrich called Trump “an existential danger to our democracy.” As recently as last week’s presidential debate, Kamala Harris accused Trump of “attacking the foundations of our democracy.” Democrats cut Trump no slack for calling on his supporters to protest “peacefully and patriotically” on Jan. 6, 2021, when some of them ran amok and invaded the Capitol. But Trump’s enemies don’t hold themselves to the same standard, when their own apocalyptic language incites a man like Routh to plan political murder. A man with a gun who wants to stop Vladimir Putin might well think slaying Trump would save lives — if, as Democrats and liberals in the media say, Trump is Putin’s stooge and would let him do whatever he wants to Ukraine. The political climate that inspired Routh encourages others like him. The media have been recklessly uncritical of the incendiary characterizations that Trump’s opponents — and many members of the media itself — have employed for years. Listening to the Democrats and watching MSNBC, a terrified man or woman might think the country is on the brink of dictatorship, and if ever there was a time when for pre-emptive violence, it must be now. For Democrats to denounce political violence while leading their supporters to think that freedom is finished if Trump wins isn’t just hypocritical, it’s culpable. Progressives have to find a way to argue against Trump without giving ammunition to the paranoid, self-righteous, and impulsive. Trump’s life is already in danger — just think about what happens if he wins. On election night, what will the people convinced Trump is a dictator do? This is the moment to bring the temperature down. It should have happened after the former president almost lost his life to an assassin in Butler, Pennsylvania. But little changed after that horrific incident: Democrats certainly didn’t treat it anything like January 6. They apparently aren’t examining their consciences now, either. Rachel Vindman, sister-in-law of the Democrats’ nominee for Virginia’s 7th Congressional District — and the wife of Alexander Vindman, a key figure in the first impeachment effort against President Trump in 2019 — tweeted after Routh’s attempted ambush of Trump, “No ears were harmed.” An audience member, Corey Comperatore, was killed in Butler on July 13, and the GOP nominee came within an inch of death — is this something Democrats like the Vindmans find funny? Too few Democrats take seriously the implications of their own words. They act as if Trump’s intemperance excuses greater intemperance on their part. If Trump goes too far — and sometimes he does — the Democrats have a duty not to go farther still, but to pull back. Yet they haven’t, so Trump remains in assassins’ sights.

Musk, who owns the platform, formerly known as Twitter, put up the post after a man suspected of planning to assassinate Republican former President Donald Trump at his golf course in West Palm Beach was arrested on Sunday. A Trump supporter and the CEO of Tesla, Musk wrote on Sunday: \"And no one is even trying to assassinate Biden/Kamala,\" a post he ended with an emoji of a face with a raised eyebrow. He was quickly criticised by X users from the left and right, who said they were concerned his words to nearly 200 million followers could incite violence against Biden and Harris. Musk deleted the post but the Secret Service, tasked with protecting current and former presidents, vice presidents and other notable officials, took notice. \"The Secret Service is aware of the social media post made by Elon Musk and as a matter of practice, we do not comment on matters involving protective intelligence,\" a spokesperson told Reuters in an email. \"We can say, however, that the Secret Service investigates all threats related to our protectees.\" The spokesperson declined to specify whether the agency had reached out to Musk, who seemed to suggest in follow-up posts that he had been making a joke.","summary":"","url":"https://www.channelnewsasia.com/world/trump-assassination-attempt-elon-musk-secret-service-joe-biden-kamala-harris-4611821","image":"https://onecms-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/s--iXft_P1I--/fl_relative,g_south_east,l_mediacorp:cna:watermark:2024-04:reuters_1,w_0.1/f_auto,q_auto/c_fill,g_auto,h_338,w_600/v1/one-cms/core/2024-09-13t023113z_2_lynxmpek8c00s_rtroptp_3_xai-tesla.jpg?itok","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-16 23:01:00","author":null,"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"sg","sentiment":-0.292},{"id":256562764,"title":"'Depraved and disgraced Huw Edwards betrayed family, BBC, audiences and young victims'","text":"Depraved and disgraced, Huw Edwards betrayed his family, the BBC, audiences who trusted him and, most of all, the young victims of a despicable crime.

The BBC has questions to answer about its treatment of a fallen star, including a salary rise and £200,000 paid after his arrest. But above all else, this is the fall of a calculating, manipulative man who conned the country into inviting him into their living rooms – without knowing how warped he was. Poison politics The poisonous state of US politics is putting lives at risk on both sides of the divide, evidenced by another apparent attempt to assassinate Donald Trump. Ryan Routh, the man charged over the latest incident, is a disillusioned former Trump supporter who voted for him in 2016. This will make little difference to Trump and his more extreme supporters, who will continue to spew their hateful rhetoric at his Democrat rival, Kamala Harris. We await a definitive verdict on what -motivated the latest gunman.

Melissa is a dedicated advocate for education, with a proven track record of involvement in our community. Her commitment to student success and her collaborative approach make her an ideal candidate to address the challenges facing our schools. Melissa understands the importance of creating inclusive learning environments where all students can thrive.

Pragati Grover Saratoga Passing Prop. 6 will benefit state, economy Re: “Prop. 6 is not actually about inmate slavery” (Page A6, Sept. 12). The editorial recommending a no on Proposition 6 is incredibly disappointing and I’d very much argue misleading. These bills aren’t some bizarre push to allow prisoners to refuse to do any chores but an effort to finally expunge the last vestiges of de jure involuntary servitude and slavery from our system. The reasons are both moral (as we all agree slavery has no place in modern society), justice driven (as forced prison labor has historically been used to exploit minority groups for profit) as well as economic (studies by the ACLU have found that forced prison labor suppresses wages in the surrounding area). So this goes far beyond chores. In addition, this push isn’t new or untested. Six other states have already banned the practice, and forced prison labor isn’t a thing in the EU. It’s time for California to catch up; vote yes on Proposition 6. Christopher Dooner Sunnyvale Electoral College keeps coastal states in line For you nonbelievers let me say this about the Electoral College: Without it, a vast and significant number of Americans would have no say in our politics.

Because her platitudes for the multitudes will melt away and she will try to lead us so far left that you will be sorry. She may not be Marxist but her record is very far left.

Navarro hosted fellow ex-con Steve Bannon’s “Real America’s Voice” show on Monday, and took the opportunity to relay a whiny story about a “middle-aged, chubby housewife” who was mean to him while they were getting off of a plane. \"We're blocked from getting out because there's people ahead of us,” Navarro recounted. “So when she thinks that there's enough people between us that she can somehow get away out the door, she screams at me, 'Go back to prison.'\" \"What's my point?” he continued. “If a middle-aged, middle-class housewife thinks that she has the right or the license to speak that way to other people in public, and wants to take my freedom away from me—anybody in this country now thinks they can say anything the hell they want to anybody, anywhere.\" It wouldn’t be a true MAGA sob story without ginning up a persecution complex, so Navarro proceeded to claim that Manhattan juries are made up of \"scumbag Democrats\" and complain that he and fellow convicts Trump and Bannon have been victimized and are now targets for violence. “Kamala Harris, do not apologize or say there's no place for any violence when you are the perpetrator,” Navarro said. “When Merrick Garland is a perpetrator when, Jack Smith is the perpetrator, when Fani Willis is the perpetrator, when Juan Merchan is the perpetrator,” he continued, listing the attorney general and prosecutors who are carrying out investigations, as well as the judge who is set to sentence Trump on 34 felony counts. “These people are scum. You are scum. You are violent scum. It's time to put that to rest.” Navarro isn't a stranger to being derided by Americans.

Navarro hosted fellow ex-con Steve Bannon’s “Real America’s Voice” show on Monday, and took the opportunity to relay a whiny story about a “middle-aged, chubby housewife” who was mean to him while they were getting off of a plane.\n\n\n\n\"We're blocked from getting out because there's people ahead of us,” Navarro recounted. “So when she thinks that there's enough people between us that she can somehow get away out the door, she screams at me, 'Go back to prison.'\"\n\n\n\n\"What's my point?” he continued. “If a middle-aged, middle-class housewife thinks that she has the right or the license to speak that way to other people in public, and wants to take my freedom away from me—anybody in this country now thinks they can say anything the hell they want to anybody, anywhere.\"&nbsp;\n\n\n\nIt wouldn’t be a true MAGA sob story without ginning up a persecution complex, so Navarro p","url":"https://www.dailykos.com/story/2024/9/16/2270713/-Convicted-ex-Trump-adviser-fumes-after-he-s-shamed-on-a-plane?pm_campaign=blog&pm_medium=rss&pm_source=","image":"https://cdn.prod.dailykos.com/images/1346308/story_image/GettyImages-2162460592.jpg?1726519026","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-16 23:00:04","author":"Walter Einenkel","authors":["Walter Einenkel"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.277},{"id":256562998,"title":"Trump Is No Gerald Ford","text":"Every American has the right to participate in public life without violence, and that includes Donald Trump. Personally, I think he probably belongs in jail, but that is a matter for the justice system. I also think he is easily the worst president in American history and one of the very worst people in our national life. But my feelings have no bearing on his rights or his safety. He is an American, and I want him to be treated fairly in court. He is my fellow citizen, and I want him to walk our streets without being in danger. He is a candidate for public office in the United States, and I want our government to ensure his safety—I am willing to be taxed to pay for his security. If only Trump and his homunculus, J. D. Vance, cared as much about the safety of others as so many others care about theirs. My colleague David A. Graham has already noted the misery that Vance is bringing down on his own constituents in Ohio, using hatred against immigrants to set neighbors against one another, a conflict that has led to the closure of schools and the lockdown of two hospitals. Vance is a product of such a working-class town, but in reality he is an utterly synthetic politician, a power-seeking drone who will do almost anything to further his political fortunes. In this case, he is casting the innocent people of Springfield, Ohio, in his own obscene little drama about migrant savages roaming the streets of the heartland trying to sink their teeth into Fluffy and Fido. Sure, it’s a pack of lies—Vance admitted on CNN that he and Trump are “creating stories”—but it’s all for the greater good, you see, of advancing the career of the Hillbilly Senator. Trump, meanwhile, is turning the violence against him into fuel for more political hatred. In July, a young man—a loner with no obvious political agenda—tried to kill Trump in Pennsylvania, and almost did. And now another man is under arrest for a possible assassination attempt after being discovered near Trump’s golf course, apparently lying in wait for the former president. Once again, the suspect seems to be something of a weird loner who said on X that he voted for Trump in 2016 but in subsequent elections, according to federal campaign-finance records, began donating to Democrats. One might hope that these brushes with death would bring Trump a moment of reflection and, perhaps, even something like grace. But if Trump were capable of such a response, he wouldn’t be the man he is. After the attack in July, Trump engaged in a self-indulgent ramble at the GOP convention, but he did not blame the Democrats; he left that for his surrogates in the party. This time, he’s not even bothering with any of that outsourcing and is instead using this latest incident to blame his political opponents, Joe Biden and Kamala Harris, for putting him in danger. He also blames the justice system and the charges brought against him—charges in multiple venues that have been filed in the name of the State of Georgia, the People of New York State, and the United States of America—for encouraging others to try to kill him. He posted this today on Truth Social and X, and I offer it here verbatim and in its entirety: In other words, Trump is blaming two possible attempts to kill him on pretty much anyone who isn’t an open partisan on his side, and that includes Biden, Harris, me, and millions of other Americans. Self-awareness is not part of Trump’s personality: He is complaining about overheated rhetoric while constantly spewing such rhetoric himself. He has called Harris various names, and he refers to everyone else he doesn’t like as “vermin” and “scum” and other insults. (Today he called the sitting president and vice president of the United States “the enemy from within.”) Many of Trump’s political opponents and public critics have been the targets of plots and threats, including a pipe-bombing campaign. At this point, with two apparent plots against him foiled, a more thoughtful person would consider what he could do to help turn down the temperature in the nation. But again, Trump is not that kind of man. America, however, has had such leaders. Many of Trump’s supporters on social media, afflicted with short memories and a lack of historical awareness, seem to believe that the attacks on Trump are unprecedented. Two assassination attempts in about two months is indeed horrifying, but it is not unprecedented: In 1975, President Gerald Ford survived two such attempts in fewer than three weeks. One assailant was a woman from West Virginia named Sara Jane Moore. The other was an acolyte of the murderer Charles Manson, Lynette “Squeaky” Fromme. Both of them came within feet of killing Ford. Ford was a decent man and an underrated president, and he certainly had enemies, especially after pardoning Richard Nixon. (Moore was obsessed with the Vietnam War and thought that assassinating Ford would spark a violent national revolution.) But he did not blame his opponents for the attempts on his life. He did not blame America, or the courts, or anyone else. He also did not use the attacks by Moore and Fromme to fundraise: Trump used his attacks to beat the bushes for money within a few hours. Instead, Ford acceded to the Secret Service’s request that he start wearing a trench coat with a zip-in Kevlar vest. (It was very uncomfortable and he disliked wearing it.) He then went back out in public and conducted a presidential campaign, which he lost. Trump doesn’t deserve to be the target of violence any more than his opponents do, even if his own rhetoric has inspired multiple threats against public figures—and, of course, a seditious riot. We are a better country, and a better people, than Trump, and every good American citizen should insist on his protection and his safety. But he and Vance seem unable to insist on ours—a fundamental duty of elected officials—and this makes them unfit to hold any American public office.
