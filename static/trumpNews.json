President-elect Donald Trump was way out of line when he immediately used the attack on people celebrating the new year in New Orleans for his own cheap political purposes. He and his Republican allies blamed the truck attack on President Joe Biden&apos;s border policies even though the attacker was an American citizen. \"When I said that the criminals coming in are far worse than the criminals we have in our country, that statement was constantly refuted by Democrats and the Fake News Media, but it turned out to be true,\" Mr Trump posted on his own social media channel. The president-elect&apos;s eldest son, Donald Trump Jr, posted a news article that said, \"Biden&apos;s parting gift to America - migrant terrorists.\" False. False. False. The attacker who was killed in the resulting shoot-out was born in the United States and was indeed a veteran of the US Army. The difficulty is that for all the millions of words pointing these truths out, millions of people will not see them or choose not to see them. Mr Trump&apos;s initial falsity will remain. The truth is much more complicated than the simple narratives that Mr Trump favours. Just as the perpetrator in New Orleans was an army veteran, so was the man inside the Tesla truck that exploded outside the Trump International Hotel in Las Vegas. The attacks have not been linked - but there are similarities that ought to be considered, particularly by people wanting to lead the world&apos;s most powerful country. Both terrorists - and the word is appropriate because of their extreme Islamist motivations - were deeply troubled individuals, with a succession of failures, including of relationships, behind them. The New Orleans attacker, according to CNN, talked in videos of gathering his family together with the intention of killing them. The Las Vegas perpetrator, according to the AP news agency, \"may have gotten into a fight with his wife about relationship issues shortly before he rented the Tesla and bought the guns\". This implies that there was more to these attacks than out-and-out ideology. Both attackers espoused extreme, violent Islamism but there were clearly mental stability issues, too. The attacks had some similarities with other gun violence in the United States. There are clearly a lot of very angry people in the country who are armed. It is important that Muslims or migrants aren&apos;t demonised. The media has a great responsibility in not allowing that to happen. Mr Trump may have got his initial false view from a report on Rupert Murdoch&apos;s Fox News which, according to NBC, had reported that the New Orleans truck driver had crossed the border from Mexico. It later backtracked, saying: \"To be clear, the suspect was born in the United States.\" Not that the truth stopped Mr Trump. He continued to link the attack with what he alleged was the ease of entering the United States. It would be nice to think that Mr Trump will show more responsibility when he is in the Oval Office - but we are not hopeful. It would be nice to think that Mr Murdoch will exert more control over the family business - but we are not hopeful. In Australia, politicians should look at America - and conclude that the American way is not the Australian way. There is an election coming up. Peddling false narratives is not the way to win it.","url":"https://www.canberratimes.com.au/story/8858722/trumps-false-narrative-on-new-orleans-attack/?cs=27763","image":"/images/transform/v1/crop/frm/3BUUzmFAhrhLyX9rFCubPq5/4a710be2-0bfc-43aa-9769-bcccb148693a.jpg/r291_270_3505_2413_w3796_h2531_fmax.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-01-06 01:12:12","author":"The Canberra Times","authors":["The Canberra Times"],"language":"en","source_country":"au","sentiment":-0.203},{"id":278535160,"title":"Security audit underway as MP threats surge","text":"Politicians confronted a wave of security threats in the months after the attempted assassination of Donald Trump triggered fears for the safety of local federal MPs, according to new data released by federal police. The Australian Federal Police received 402 reports of harassment, nuisance, offensive and threatening communications against parliamentarians between July and October 2024. The figures signal a concerning trend in reported threats of violence and aggression towards elected officials, which reached record levels in the last financial year. Australian National University academic Dr Richard Frank, who researches politically motivated violence, said an increasingly polarised public debate and a cost-of-living crisis have contributed to a spike in vitriol against policymakers. \"Given the wider availability of social media, the cost-of-living constraints, and increasing inequality, there has been widespread dissatisfaction, and the literature suggests trust in government in most Western democracies has declined,\" he said. \"There is broader literature to suggest female politicians are targeted more than men, but polarising rhetoric, polarising political figures, the election cycle ramping up, as well as specific policies that politicians are perceived to support are all drivers.\" This year, protesters defaced a string of electorate offices belonging to several senior MPs as divisions over the devastation in Gaza dominated public debate. Victoria police charged two teenagers in July after they defaced Labor MP Josh Burns&apos;s office with slogans including \"Zionism is fascism\" and lit fires at the front of the building. In October, Labor MP and government envoy for social cohesion Peter Khalil had his Melbourne office vandalised with a symbol associated with terrorist group Hamas. An attempted assassination of Donald Trump during a campaign rally in July sparked a wave of concerns it would further escalate political tensions in Australia. While an increase in anti-government sentiment can be seen across both the US and Australia, significant differences around gun culture and voting systems mean the likelihood of serious incidents of political violence locally remains comparatively low, according to Dr Frank. \"The Australian and American systems are quite different, the temperature of the rhetoric is nowhere near the same,\" he said. \"Politics isn&apos;t perceived to be as life or death here than in some other contexts, so while there is an increase in threats and the challenges here have gone up substantially - that&apos;s from a lower base.\" The Department of Home Affairs and AFP are in the final stages of reviewing the security measures in place for politicians in preparation for the 2025 federal election. The review was ordered after authorities reported a surge in threats to federal MPs last year in the aftermath of the Voice referendum. The audit, which has not yet been provided to government, is due to be finalised by Christmas. \"Due to the sensitive material relating to security arrangements, it is not expected that the review will be made publicly available,\" a department spokesperson confirmed.","url":"https://www.canberratimes.com.au/story/8838754/security-audit-underway-as-mp-threats-surge/?cs=27845","image":"/images/transform/v1/crop/frm/237852436/5b1dd4cc-2fa9-446a-9c67-bc837a7d1c4a.jpg/r307_204_3694_2462_w4000_h2667_fmax.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-01-06 01:12:12","author":"Eleanor Campbell","authors":["Eleanor Campbell"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"au","sentiment":-0.098},{"id":278534768,"title":"War, climate, & AI: World’s three big challenges of 2025 | Mint","text":"Let us look at some events that made headlines this New Year’s day. In the US city of New Orleans, Shamsud-Din Jabbar, a former US army personnel, rammed his car into a group of revellers, killing 15 people and injuring dozens. The police gunned him down when he tried to open fire at the crowd.\n\n Jabbar had a criminal past, but escaped scrutiny. Innocent US civilians paid the price for the laxity on the part of American intelligence agencies.\n\n For the US, tragedy didn’t end here. Within hours, a truck exploded in front of a Las Vegas hotel, where president-elect Donald Trump had been staying. A passer-by was killed in the explosion. Interestingly, the truck involved in the explosion was a Tesla, manufactured by Trump’s close associate Elon Musk. The third incident was a shootout at a night club in Queensborough, New York, which left 11 people injured. Both incidents are being investigated.\n\nAlso read | A dirty game for votes, in the name of Dr Ambedkar\n\nThe US police hadn’t declared the last two incidents as terrorist acts till press time, but they have once again brought to light the growing unease in American society.\n\n Meanwhile, two other incidents that occurred in other parts of the world threaten to have long-term adverse consequences: The first was an Israeli air raid on Gaza that killed 12 people, and the second was Ukraine’s seizure of a gas pipeline that cut supply from Russia to the rest of Europe.\n\n What do these headlines suggest?\n\nTrumps uneasy crown\n\nA crown of thorns awaits Donald Trump in his second innings at the Oval Office. He needs to contend with international and domestic challenges. New Orleans, New York, and Las Vegas have again shown that US invincibility is a veneer. It faces threats from within. In this scenario, how can Trump satisfactorily resolve Israel-Hamas, and Russia-Ukraine conflicts?\n\n The Russia-Ukraine conflict, nearing its third year, is raising doubts about Russian military might and superiority. The past three years have eroded the strongman image Vladimir Putin had assiduously built over the years. History has shown that an autocrat on the decline tries every trick in the trade to destroy others. The gas pipeline incident raises concerns about the likelihood of a rash decision by Putin.\n\nAlso read | Fundamentalism portends to drag Bangladesh down\n\nDoes it mean the top priority for 2025 is to stop the wars?\n\n How wars have bled humanity is clear from the data the human rights department of the United Nations has released. UN data from 2024 till 21 October shows 11,973 citizens, including 622 children, were killed in the Russia-Ukraine war. The Palestinian health ministry claims 45,000 people, including 17,000 children, have died in the past 14 months in the Israel-Hamas war.\n\n Now let’s look at the most important issue facing the human race–climate change. The year 2024 was the warmest in recorded human history.\n\n Since the Doha round failed, speculation is rife that challenges for a consensus on climate change actions will intensify in the years ahead. But Trump’s win could weaken the effort to tackle this challenge. Another issue that has piqued our interest and attention is artificial Intelligence (AI). Debates are raging globally about its strengths and pitfalls.\n\nPertinent questions\n\nYuval Noah Harari, a professor at Jerusalem’s Hebrew University and historian of world renown, raises some pertinent questions on the issue. He insists that AI can lie, too. Professor Harari gave an example that when Open AI launched ChatGPT4 they asked it to solve a Captcha to test its efficacy. ChatGPT4 couldn’t crack the Captcha. It was later given access to a web page called taskrabbit. ChatGPT4 outsourced the task of cracking the Captcha telling the service provider that it was blind. The engineers who created the algorithms were stunned. They couldn’t fathom how AI learned to tell lies. This is why Harari and other intellectuals are questioning the role of AI. They insist that AI will be lethal as this tool can think and make decisions.\n\nAlso read | Separatist sparks in Punjab must be promptly doused\n\nThere’s no doubt that people with malicious intentions will misuse AI. On 21 January 2024, AI was used to clone the voice of the US president Joe Biden and employed to make thousands of automated calls to voters in New Hampshire.\n\n US authorities imposed a fine of $1 million on Lingo Telecom, the company that undertook this operation. India, too, has had actor Rashmika Mandana’s case. So, has science created a Frankenstein’s monster for the human race? And will 2025 be able to create a consensus on the three challenges threatening humanity—wars, climate change, and AI?\n\n Shashi Shekhar is editor-in-chief, Hindustan.

Maybe better to do it afterwards when the operation is over?” Ukrainian MP Oleksiy Goncharenko said.\n\nThe head of Ukraine’s Center for Countering Disinformation, Andriy Kovalenko, said on Telegram defence forces were “working” in the area, without elaborating.\n\n“In the Kursk region, the Russians are very worried because they were attacked from several directions, and it was a surprise for them,” he said.\n\nKyiv seized dozens of villages in the Kursk region shortly after its incursion started on August 6, 2024, but its advances stalled after Moscow rushed reinforcements to the area, including thousands of troops from its ally North Korea.\n\nA Ukrainian army source told AFP last November that Kyiv still controlled 800 square kilometres of the Russian border region, down from previous claims it controlled almost 1400 square kilometres.\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said last year the Kursk operation has boosted Kyiv’s “exchange fund” – its negotiating position on swapping prisoners of war – and diverted tens of thousands of Russian troops away from the eastern front.\n\nHe said on Saturday evening that “up to a battalion of North Korean infantry soldiers and Russian airborne troops” had been lost in battles in the Kursk region on that day and the day before.\n\nBut Kyiv has so far been unable to halt Moscow’s advances in Ukraine, which were seven times higher in 2024 than the year prior, according to an AFP analysis of data from the Institute for the Study of War.\n\nRussia said on Sunday it downed dozens of Ukrainian drones overnight in a barrage that damaged homes and triggered air alerts, while Kyiv said Moscow fired 103 drones into its territory.\n\nFour Russian airports briefly suspended traffic early on Sunday for “safety” reasons, forcing at least eight planes to divert course, a spokesperson for Russia’s civil aviation authority Rosaviatsia said.","summary":"Ukraine has launched a surprise new counter-attack on a Russian region after Kyiv’s forces began a shock ground offensive last year.","url":"https://www.news.com.au/world/europe/getting-what-it-deserves-ukraine-issues-stern-warning-to-russia-amid-surprise-counterattack/news-story/75c3e3572968624490dd0173244e4a88?from=rss-basic","image":"https://content.api.news/v3/images/bin/69c8b247fe1198573002d43159829333","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-01-06 01:06:12","author":"Brielle Burns","authors":["Brielle Burns"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"au","sentiment":-0.185},{"id":278532844,"title":"The Golden Globes kick off award season","text":"How will ‘Wicked’ fare?\n\n“Emilia Perez” may have be favored over “Wicked” for the best comedy or musical award, but Jon M.

In an embarrassing moment, he called someone up on stage to sing happy birthday to them. That's when things went all sorts of wrong, and believe it or not, this is just a warm-up for what happened afterward.\n\nThe good news? We've only got a few more weeks left insanity of this. \n\nALSO SEE: The Press Are Astonished that Biden's Senility Was 'Underreported'\n\nLadies and Gentlemen, the President of the United States. I'm just trying to help here, but maybe his handlers shouldn't be letting him sing happy birthday to people if he can't even say their names. Who am I kidding, though? His handlers have long since given up trying to hide what has become obvious to all. The current president is senile. Everyone knows it, and while we justifiably laugh at moments like this, it's what is happening behind the scenes that truly concerns me and so many other Americans. \n\nBut as I said, that senior moment was just the warm-up. After his speech, Biden was confronted by reporters. He responded by cussing them out. \n\nIs that a threat to democracy? Because I've been assured that verbally abusing the press is a threat to democracy. Surely, Jim Acosta and John Harwood will be wringing their hands over this, right? Remember, this is the same guy who recently lectured Donald Trump on \"decency\" during a eulogy for the now-deceased former President Jimmy Carter.\n\nRegardless, if you've been reading my writings for any length of time, you know that I try to go deeper than just mockery, as deserved as it is given Biden's outburst. What does it tell us that the outgoing president believes simply meeting \"more world leaders than any one of you\" gives him credibility? It tells us that Washington is riddled with meaningless credentialism whereby politicians are granted \"expertise\" simply by virtue of existing. \n\nBiden has been around for a long time. Thus, in his mind, and the minds of many Democrats and the national press, he must know what he's talking about. Is that true, though? That's rhetorical because we all know it's not true. Biden is perhaps the worst foreign policy mind in American history when you consider the length of his tenure within the federal government. While his deadly Afghanistan withdrawal will go down in history as one of the country's darkest moments, that is just one of many insanely bad decisions he has made, from advising against killing Osama Bin Laden to his more recent insanity dealing with Hamas. \n\nCredentialism has destroyed the federal government. It has turned it into a jobs program for mediocrities who leech off of taxpayers for decades at a time, never having to deliver anything positive for the American people. Joe Biden is the epitome of that culture, and it is somewhat poetic that he'll be leaving Washington as a disgrace.","url":"https://redstate.com/bonchie/2025/01/05/increasingly-senile-biden-has-embarrassing-moment-and-then-cusses-out-reporters-for-good-measure-n2183985","image":"https://media.townhall.com/cdn/hodl/2025/1/15bd5c84-e200-4618-acc1-05214984e506.jpeg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-01-06 00:48:12","author":"Bonchie","authors":["Bonchie"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.338},{"id":278532288,"title":"Nearly Half a Million 'Anchor Babies' Born in U.S. in 2024","text":"The two top issues for voters during the 2024 election cycle were the economy and illegal immigration. During Joe Biden's four years in office, his administration has allowed millions of illegal immigrants from all over the world into the country. President-elect Donald Trump has vowed on Day One to deport those millions back to their home countries. The onslaught of illegal immigrants has wreaked havoc on the nation's public assistance, medical, and educational systems. It has also brought attention to a problem that is not new, but it is growing rapidly. That is the issue of \"anchor babies.\"\n\nAnchor babies are children born in the U.S. to illegal immigrant parents, and the number of them born in 2024 is staggering. Nearly 400,000 babies were born in 2024 to illegal immigrant parents. These are not just illegal immigrants who come across the southern border but include tourists and foreign visa workers, people who have no direct ties to the U.S., but their children automatically become U.S. citizens. While some of these births might not be planned, some of them are, and it is becoming not just a matter of legality and constitutionality but also a strong argument for Donald Trump's mass deportation plan.\n\nREAD MORE: Mexico Braces for Trump’s Mass Deportations, Set to Open 25 New Shelters for Illegals on Inauguration Day\n\nThe sheer number of births is a problem now, but it becomes more of a problem once those anchor babies become adults. They then can sponsor their parents or other relatives for green cards. For 2024 alone, the breakdown goes like this: 300,000 babies were born to illegal immigrant parents, and 72,000 were born to foreign tourists, foreign visa workers, and foreign students. \n\nAlong with the mass deportation of illegal immigrants, Trump has promised to end birthright citizenship in his second term. It is a move that is supported by a large number of Americans. That support includes 48 percent of whites and 42 percent of Hispanics. In a May 2023 campaign video, he stated,\n\n“On day one of my new term in office, I will sign an executive order making clear to federal agencies that under the correct interpretation of the law going forward the future children of illegal aliens will not receive automatic U.S. citizenship.\"\n\nTrump's promise to end birthright citizenship has renewed legal and constitutional debates on the subject. The 14th Amendment was ratified on July 9, 1868, and was designed to ensure that formerly enslaved people would be granted full rights of citizenship. Section one states,\n\n\"All persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the State wherein they reside. No State shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States; nor shall any State deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law; nor deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.\"\n\nBirthright citizenship might become the new political football. It has been long debated by Constitutional scholars from both ends of the political spectrum. The key phrase in the clause is \"subject to the jurisdiction thereof.\" Conservative scholars have maintained that the citizenship clause in the 14th Amendment does not grant automatic citizenship to the children of those here illegally because they are not subjected to U.S. jurisdiction. The United States Supreme Court has also never ruled expressly on the children of illegal immigrants. \n\nThe bottom line is this: the American people elected Donald Trump to secure the border and deport those here illegally. Simple math says that as more illegal immigrants are deported, the incidence of anchor babies goes down, and America finally gets a handle on illegal immigration.\n\nRELATED: ICE Data Confirms 1.4 Million Unaccounted-For Illegals Remain in US...

Let's back up a little before getting to that, though.\n\nHoman has more than held his own since President-elect Trump announced his nomination after the election, speaking in clear and no-nonsense language about what the administration plans to do about the border crisis and the millions of illegal aliens scattered across the country during Biden's disiastrous four years in the White House.\n\nIn one interview, with NewsMax just before New Year's, Homan easily demolished Democrat Rep. Jasmine Crockett's verbal attack on his credibility, which she threw out during a cozy interview on an MSNBC program.\n\nTough Enough:\n\nDuring this week's \"Face The Nation,\" Brennan's questioning strategy seemed to be discrediting the incoming president's promise to implement mass deportations and restore the integrity of the southern border. Here was one stab at that goal during Homan's interview: [emphasis mine]\n\nHoman directed the conversation to the Biden administration, which took action earlier this year to limit the number of asylum-seekers entering the country through the U.S.-Mexico border. Homan argued that 80 percent of the Biden administration’s deportation numbers are from Border Patrol arrests that were moved back across the southern border.“They weren’t interior enforcement arrests,” he said, adding the Biden administration is “playing a numbers game.”\n\nHere was Brennan's talking point in response: Biden had more deportations than during Trump's first term. Homan pointed out why the fudged numbers don't add up to what Trump succeeded in doing:\n\nYou can compare the number of deportations under Trump versus Biden. When you consider a 45-year low in crossings, the number of deportations [is] going to be lower because we don’t have that population to process and deport.\n\nIn other words, Brennan's gotcha question on whether Donald Trump will actually deport the number of people he has promised accidentally gave Homan an opening to lay into Biden's disastrous failures on the border. As he masterfully said, so that even a child could understand it, of course Trump's numbers are lower--he did not allow in the millions that Biden and DHS Secretary Mayorkas have. He also reminded the host that ICE could do its great work much more efficiently, if the sanctuary cities would work with them. \n\nBrennan also concern-trolled about Trump's ability to deport violent criminals back to their home countries, if their leaders refuse to accept them:\n\nHoman disposed of that quickly, saying that Trump's been there, done that--and he's already gotten some grudging foreign leaders to walk back their pushback in recent weeks.\n\nAs we wrote earlier, new Senate Majority Leader John Thune of North Dakota spoke with the host about the prospects of Trump Secretary of Defense nominee, Pete Hegseth getting confirmed by the U.S. Senate.\n\nIn a separate part of the interview, Brennan again attempted to trip up a Republican with some fancy footwork about Trump and immigration--and fell on her face.\n\nThis brief excerpt reveals what happened:\n\nKRISTEN WELKER: When I spoke with President-elect Donald Trump, he said that his mass deportation plan was his top priority. He wants to deport everyone who is here illegally. Do you support that plan to deport everyone who is here illegally?SEN. JOHN THUNE: Well, I think there are certain – certainly there are categories, people who've committed crimes. There are over a million people that the current administration had targeted for deportation. And so I think that we have to take seriously the fact that there are a lot of people in this country today, over 10 million, who've come in just in the last four years under this administration's policies, many of whom are not here for good reasons. I mean, we know we've apprehended almost 300 people at the southern border that are on the terrorist watch list. And you've got criminals, and cartel members, and gang members, and all of the above.\n\nAbsolutely right, and this is how the GOP needs to go around far-left word games in the media. If Republican Senate leadership, House Speaker Mike Johnson, and those Trump plans to surround himself with in the White House remain singing from the same hymnal--especially in the tough fights ahead--the country might have a chance to remain the tattered border and our national sovereignty.\n\nReminder...There are so many great stories awaiting you, not only here at RedState, but if you join up for VIP Gold membership, you’ll have access to VIP articles across all of the Townhall Media sites, including Townhall, Twitchy, HotAir, Bearing Arms, and PJ Media.

The MAGA rabble-rouser said the visa issue is “central to the way they gutted the middle class in this country.” Trump — whose own personal wealth was recently estimated at $5.5 billion — took Silicon Valley’s side, astonishing many of his own supporters and even drawing criticism from moderates like his former UN ambassador, Nikki Haley.\n\nYet Donald Nieman, a political analyst and professor at Binghamton University in New York state, gives Trump credit for assembling a broader coalition than in the past, even if that makes conflict more likely. \n\n“He knows he has to deliver on the economy — the issue that brought him to the White House — so kicking the tech sector in the teeth is bad politics,” Nieman told AFP. Some analysts predict that the contretemps will end badly for Musk, with Trump keenly aware that his real power has always resided in his working-class support.\n\nOthers think the lure of Silicon Valley lucre may have changed MAGA permanently, and that Trump — ever the pragmatist — will lead his base to the center rather than allowing his base to drag him to the right.","summary":"WASHINGTON: With Donald Trump’s allies in open warfare ahead of his inauguration, analysts see the latest hostilities between his billionaire backers and working-class base as a preview of tensions that threaten to shatter his fragile coalition.\n\n\n\nThe furore over whether to welcome skilled foreign workers has exposed deep fault lines between the hardcore immigration hawks who have been with Trump from the start and the “tech bros” who spent a fortune getting the Republican re-elected.\n\n\n\nThreatening to grow into an irreparable schism, the row has prompted leading lights in Trump’s “Make America Great Again” (MAGA) crusade to highlight what they see as the absurdity of a supposedly populist movement where the mega-rich call the shots.\n\n\n\n“I think this most recent war of words between traditional MAGA and big-tech MAGA was an opening salvo in a long-running battle over the future of the MAGA movement,” political analyst Flavio Hickel told AFP.\n\n\n\nLeading the Silicon Valley faction is Elon Musk, the South Afric","url":"https://www.brecorder.com/news/40341219/maga-civil-war-sparks-fears-of-chaotic-trump-white-house","image":"https://i.brecorder.com/large/2025/01/677b10f9ed635.gif","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-01-06 00:47:14","author":"AFP","authors":["AFP"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"pk","sentiment":0.043},{"id":278533262,"title":"Musk says Farage should step down as leader of Reform UK","text":"LONDON: US billionaire Elon Musk said on Sunday that Nigel Farage should step down as the leader of Britain’s right-wing Reform UK party in an abrupt withdrawal of support.\n\n“The Reform Party needs a new leader.

Growth in exports is losing steam, and imports are growing, expanding the trade deficit. The country’s imports of goods in December 2024 crossed $5 billion for the first time in two years and reached $5.29bn, depicting a big 14 per cent year-on-year increase. On the other hand, exports of goods totalled $2.84bn with only a 0.67pc annualised growth. The monthly trade deficit soared 34.8pc on-year to $2.44bn.\n\nThis indicates that the current account surplus may soon start shrinking. Overall balance of payments is already negative and if the promised foreign investment does not come in time or if foreign funding dries up, it may expand further. The rupee remained strong in the first half of this fiscal year (July-December 2024), but it may start losing strength gradually.\n\nThe State Bank of Pakistan’s foreign exchange reserves have also begun to fall due to external debt servicing. These reserves of $11.7bn, equivalent to just two months of imports, are not large enough to embolden the central bank to intervene in the forex market in case of the rupee’s decline — which the International Monetary Fund (IMF) will not allow either.\n\nThe hybrid regime doesn’t want to let the trade deficit widen, but the room for boosting exports is limited amidst the rising cost of production and weak demand for Pakistani products in major export markets.\n\n The country’s internal issues paired with potential external challenges merit a charter of economy as emphasised by the finance minister\n\nThe treatment of PTI by the hybrid regime and gross violations of human rights also threaten preferential treatment of Pakistani exports in the European Union while Donald Trump’s inauguration as the US president on Jan 20 poses additional challenges for increasing exports to the US market. \n\nImports, meanwhile, cannot be contained this time through tariff or non-tariff measures as Pakistan managed to do before signing a $7bn loan agreement with the IMF in July 2024. The IMF has clearly communicated that under its current $7bn funding programme, this cannot be done.\n\nHome remittances that grew impressively in the first half of this fiscal year may also witness slower growth in the second half due to changing economic and labour market conditions in the main host countries (Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, the UK and the US).\n\nA slower growth in remittances combined with an increasing trade deficit will test the rupee’s resilience even more if Pakistan fails to get Chinese funds rolled over. The country had secured these funds earlier to avoid default. The monetary easing of the recent past is also going to keep the exchange rates under pressure by making import financing cheaper and causing a decline in the return on rupee-based financial assets.\n\nOverall economic growth in Pakistan in July-September this year remained too slow — just 0.92pc — primarily due to a contraction in industrial output, and the manufacturing sector is still struggling. The resultant rise in joblessness is making it difficult for financially challenged individuals and households to celebrate the fall in headline inflation to a record 81-month low of 4.1pc in December.\n\nSince inflationary pressures have subsided partly due to a decline in aggregate demand, evident from slow economic growth in the first quarter, an uptick in inflation cannot be ruled out if economic recovery accelerates on the back of favourable outcomes of the ongoing efforts to attract foreign investment and spur domestic demand.\n\nThe geopolitical complexities Pakistan is currently facing cannot be overstated. With Donald Trump in the White House, Israeli aggression in the Middle East, and ‘do-more’ demands coming from China regarding security present complex challenges.\n\nThe growing involvement of the establishment under the hybrid regime’s governance remains a subject of debate, though political parties seem to have accepted this phenomenon. However, the length of time these political parties, particularly the main opposition party PTI, will support this governance model is unpredictable.\n\nUnder these circumstances, Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb’s emphasis on the need for a charter of economy is no surprise. For years, the establishment has been pressing politicians to sign a charter of the economy to ensure the continuity of economic policies and reforms. \n\nThe events of May 9, 2023, and November 26, 2024, and the resurgence of militancy and terrorism in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan that threaten the foreign investment regime make the need for such an agreement more obvious.\n\nThe economic gains made in 2024 in terms of lower inflation, reduction in the cost of domestic debt servicing, increase in tax revenues and removal of some anomalies in electricity and gas pricing have set the stage for second-tier reforms.\n\nHowever, those reforms targeting sustainable economic growth in the medium term and fuller exploitation of national resources would go nowhere unless all stakeholders, including political parties, businesses, industries, and the establishment, do not jointly produce a roadmap acceptable for all. \n\nPublished in Dawn, The Business and Finance Weekly, January 6th, 2025","summary":"Pakistan’s external sector is in trouble.

Lourenco Goncalves, CEO of steelmaker Cleveland-Cliffs , which made a failed $7 billion bid for U.S. Steel in August 2023, participated in at least nine calls assuring investors that President Joe Biden would scuttle the Nippon Steel merger months before he did so on Friday, according to summaries of investor calls included in a Dec. 17 letter from lawyers for Nippon Steel and U.S. Steel to the Committee on Foreign Investment in the U.S. (CFIUS) and confirmed to Reuters by two participants in the calls. I can't force U.S. Steel to sell to me, but I can work my magic to make a deal that I don't agree with not to close, he told investors on a March 13 call hosted by JP Morgan, the letter quoted Goncalves as saying. It's not closing, and Biden hasn't spoken yet. He will. The next day, Biden announced his opposition to the tie-up. CFIUS, which reviews foreign investments in the U.S. for national security risks, could not reach consensus on whether to greenlight the Nippon Steel transaction and referred the matter to Biden in late December, setting the stage for his Friday block. Goncalves declined to comment and a representative from Cleveland-Cliffs did not respond to a request for comment. Nippon Steel and the Treasury Department, which leads CFIUS, also declined to comment. U.S. Steel said the company will continue to fight for this deal in response to questions for this story. The White House said neither Goncalves nor his comments played a role in Biden's decision to kill the deal. It said on Friday that the proposed purchase presented national security concerns. JP Morgan declined to comment, but a note to clients summarizing its March 2024 industrials conference mentions the event with Goncalves, saying management reiterated its expectation that the deal will not close. A participant in the call confirmed Goncalves' forecast Biden would soon take aim at the deal. While Goncalves made similar comments about the deal to analysts on three earnings calls this year, his private remarks made throughout 2024 about the deal process show the extent of his effort to cast doubt on Nippon's bid for U.S. Steel. His comments sometimes preceded drops in the U.S. Steel share price, Nippon Steel and U.S. Steel told CFIUS. Cleveland-Cliffs has previously expressed interest in making another bid. The steelmaker, which has been led by Brazilian-born Goncalves for over a decade, made the unsolicited bid for U.S. Steel with support from the United Steelworkers union, arguing the companies combined would create a lower-cost, more innovative, and stronger domestic supplier. But U.S. Steel raised concerns a tie-up with Cleveland-Cliffs risked being shot down by antitrust regulators because it would consolidate the supply of steel to U.S. automakers and put up to 95% of U.S. iron ore production under the control of one company. U.S. Steel's board rejected the offer. Nippon Steel's December all-cash offer was valued at twice Cleveland-Cliffs' price, and Nippon later promised to revitalize U.S. Steel's aging mills with investment from an allied nation. But the offer became politicized, with both Biden and Republican President-Elect Donald Trump pledging to kill the deal as they wooed voters in the swing state of Pennsylvania where U.S. Steel is headquartered. Trump and Biden both asserted the company should remain American-owned after USW President David McCall expressed his opposition to the tie-up. Biden's objections led to impermissible undue influence from the White House on CFIUS's national security review of the tie-up, the companies alleged in a letter obtained by Reuters last month that also contained the summaries of the investor calls with Goncalves.Goncalves previously disputed CFIUS was considering the merits of the deal. In a March 15 call with a top investor in U.S. Steel confirmed by a participant in the call, he said, here's no process. This is not going to be a process. CFIUS is just cover for a President to kill a deal. CFIUS is a bunch of bureaucrats, second and third level, inside the cabinet...It means the President can do whatever he wants.","summary":"Nippon Steel's $14.9 billion bid for U.S. Steel faces opposition from Biden amid national security concerns and skepticism from Cleveland-Cliffs' CEO Lourenco Goncalves.

In a series of posts on his social media platform, Truth Social, President-elect Donald Trump linked the massacre to “criminals coming in” and drew connections between “radical Islamic terrorism” and immigration.\n\nThese statements have heightened concerns among immigrant communities, particularly Pakistani Americans, who face increased scrutiny due to their significant presence within the US Muslim population.\n\nAccording to the Pew Research Centre, Pakistani Muslims make up 14pc of first-generation Muslim immigrants in the US, making them the largest ethnic group among Muslims. As a result, any shifts in US immigration policies are likely to affect them more significantly than any other Muslim immigrant group.\n\n Trump’s hardline stance spurs anxiety among immigrant communities, with many university students having skipped winter break trips home \n\nDr Farah Abbasi, a psychiatrist of Pakistani origin at Michigan State University, warns of a growing mental health crisis among immigrants. Writing for Planet Detroit, Dr Abbasi noted that fear of an uncertain future is exacerbating anxiety and depression within Muslim communities. “American Muslims are twice as likely to attempt suicide compared with people from other faiths,” she wrote, cautioning that undocumented immigrants are particularly vulnerable to Trump’s renewed calls for mass deportations.\n\nFor Pakistani Americans, the stakes are particularly high. Many rely on programmes like the H-1B visa, which provides professional opportunities for skilled workers. While Indian professionals dominate this category, Pakistani Americans also benefit significantly from the programme. Changes to visa policies could have ripple effects, impacting both livelihoods and professional mobility within this community.\n\nSome Pakistani students enrolled in American universities have been advised to return to campus before January 20, when the new Trump administration takes office. Many others chose to forgo their winter break trips home, fearing they might face difficulties returning to the United States.\n\nH-1B visas and internal divisions\n\nImmigration has long been a contentious issue in US politics, but Trump’s hardline stance on asylum, border control, and deportation has further polarized the debate. A new dimension emerged recently when Trump aligned himself with Elon Musk’s call to expand the H-1B visa programme, which aims to attract skilled foreign workers. This position has divided his supporters, with figures like Steve Bannon opposing any expansion of immigration programmes.\n\nBannon, in his War Room podcast, derided H-1B visas as a “scam” and argued that American jobs should go to US-born workers. However, proponents like Musk and Mansoor Qureshi, a member of Virginia Governor Glenn Youngkin’s Asian Advisory Board, counter that H-1B workers fill critical gaps in sectors like IT and engineering, contributing significantly to the US economy. Qureshi emphasised the economic contributions of these professionals, warning that restricting the programme could push companies to relocate jobs overseas.\n\nImpact on immigration enforcement\n\nThe broader immigration debate has also reignited discussions about deportations. The National Immigrant Justice Centre (NIJC) has warned that the incoming administration could expand the expedited removal programme, allowing immigration officers to deport individuals without due process. This policy disproportionately affects undocumented immigrants, many of whom live in urban centres and are integral to local economies.\n\nPakistani Americans fear that these measures could lead to a rise in hate crimes and targeted violence, echoing sentiments voiced at a recent gathering in Springfield, Virginia. “We Pakistanis are also on the map,” said Faiz Rehman, a business consultant. “Any changes to immigration policy will impact us too.”\n\nA complex debate\n\nWhile Trump’s approach to immigration remains central to his political identity, it faces both political and practical challenges. The US government estimated the undocumented immigrant population at 11 million in 2022, and Customs and Border Protection reported a record 2.5 million apprehensions at the southern border in 2023. Yet, legal immigration remains robust, with over one million green cards issued in 2022 and four million applicants still waiting for family- and employer-related visas.\n\nPolicymakers remain divided over how to balance economic needs, security concerns, and humanitarian obligations. Advocates like Qureshi suggest that instead of curbing immigration, the US should focus on improving domestic education and training to reduce dependence on foreign workers. “Big companies hire foreign workers because our schools don’t always teach the skills they need,” he said.\n\nPreparing for change\n\nAs uncertainty looms, organisations like the NIJC are urging immigrant families to prepare for possible disruptions. Families are advised to have emergency plans, secure essential documents, and familiarize themselves with their rights during encounters with immigration officials.\n\nFor Pakistani Americans, these developments underscore the need for vigilance and proactive advocacy. With their significant representation in the US workforce and deep integration into local communities, any changes to immigration policy could have far-reaching consequences. As the political landscape evolves, Pakistani Americans are bracing for a challenging road ahead.\n\nPublished in Dawn, January 6th, 2025","summary":"WASHINGTON: The aftermath of the 2024 elections is intensifying concerns among immigrant communities, particularly Pakistani Americans, as discussions around immigration policy take centre stage in the United States.\n\n\n\nThe issue has gained renewed urgency following the New Orleans terrorist attack that claimed 15 lives.

What interviewer would want to talk politics with the guy who looks like a fuzzy Crayola crayon?\n\nStrong paired this velvet-bucket-hat-and-jacket look with a cozy, white turtleneck sweater and tinted glasses. And honestly? He low-key slayed. \n\nGlobe viewers on social media certainly thought so.\n\n“the velvet bucket hat goes insanely hard jeremy strong they could never call you boring,” wrote one X (formerly known as Twitter) user.\n\n“OBSESSED WITH JEREMY STRONG’S FIT,” exclaimed another.\n\nOn BlueSky, the sentiment was similar. “I love it. He looks like an evil birdwatcher,” wrote writer Kashana Cauley on BlueSky.\n\nStrong’s date for the night was his wife of nine years, Emma Wall, who opted for a more subdued look in an elegant white dress. \n\nStrong already has one Golden Globe win under his belt for Best Actor in a Television Series – Drama, from his critically-acclaimed performance in HBO’s Succession. Strong’s co-star in The Apprentice, Sebastian Stan, was also nominated for a 2025 Golden Globe for his performance as Trump, and is up for Best Actor for Best Performance in a Motion Picture – Drama.

A veteran diplomat, he focused on the US’ Asian affairs for decades and played a key role in former president Barack Obama’s pivot to Asia.\nThis interview first appeared in SCMP Plus. For other interviews in the Open Questions series, click here.\nIt has been more than seven years since you resigned as US assistant secretary of state amid waves of personnel departures in the early days of Donald Trump’s first term. How do you think about that decision now?\nI left with a clean conscience. I had 33 years of service to my country. During the last eight years, we worked directly for the wonderful US president Barack Obama, working on the Asia account.\nWhen Donald Trump was inaugurated [in 2017], I did stay on for several months to smooth the transition, support the new team and make sure people in the Bureau of East Asia and Pacific Affairs and in our embassies were well looked after. But I had no intention of staying under the Trump administration because it really wasn’t an option for me. I felt that the values and principles of US foreign policy that I had served under for decades were being undermined and contravened by many of the policies of the Trump administration.\n\nTrump has nominated key positions of the coming administration. He has chosen Marco Rubio, who would be the first US secretary of state sanctioned by China. What do you think his team means for China?\nThe Chinese government has the ability to set aside sanctions if it feels doing so can serve its interests. However, the choice of figures like Marco Rubio and Mike Waltz as national security adviser signals a very hard line on China, with a greater focus on zero-sum ideological confrontation. Beijing may find it difficult to engage with a team that has shown so much interest in decoupling and containment and so little interest in compromise and engagement.\nThat said, it is unclear how this hawkish perspective will fit with Donald Trump’s overall agenda.\nBeijing’s actions – towards its neighbours, minorities and Western countries – along with policies exploiting access to Western intellectual property and technology [and] militarisation of the South China Sea, have fuelled bipartisan mistrust of China in the United States.\nFigures like Marco Rubio and Mike Waltz don’t emerge in isolation; their views align with many of their colleagues in the Senate, the House and the broader policy community.\nWhile there are problems and flaws in this hardline approach, it reflects widespread and often legitimate concerns about some of China’s behaviours and policies. These concerns are not limited to the United States.\nDo you expect Trump’s second term to differ from his first? Where are US-China relations headed?\nOne thing that complicates the answer to that question is that there were different China policies under president Trump from 2017 to 2021. In 2017, Trump’s policy towards China was as friendly and affectionate as one could imagine. Let’s not lose sight of the fact that his first administration was not tough on China from the start. It became tough in stages, but didn’t begin that way.\nThis reflects the inconsistency, or perhaps the impulsive nature, of Donald Trump. Some aspects of his approach remain unchanged from his first term. He is confident in his instincts, highly transactional and strongly committed to the “America first” brand of nationalism. Policies like tariffs are examples of this.\nThat said, unlike in 2017 Donald Trump is no longer a beginner as president or commander-in-chief. Over four years he acquired substantial experience in governance and showed tremendous confidence in his instincts. He also appeared to have an aversion to relying on advice from his subordinates, which is a notable change from when he first took office.\nI suspect that, unlike his first term, Donald Trump is likely in a hurry. The midterm elections in the US are not kind to re-elected presidents. He got narrow majorities in both the House and the Senate, which will help him implement his policies, but the Democrats could flip either or both houses in 2026. That is an incentive to get as much done as quickly as he can. In a way, he has nowhere to go but down in the midterms.\nMoreover, he is almost 80 years old. It won’t be long before much of the political world starts turning its attention to his successor, especially because he’s not constitutionally eligible for another term, not to mention his age and other factors.\nAnother difference is that attitudes towards China, both in the United States and in much of the West, have significantly hardened.\nThere have been geopolitical shifts, and now China faces a less forgiving global environment. Additionally, China’s problems – the declining economic power, issues with neighbours and challenges with debtor countries throughout the Global South – have magnified.\nIt’s also pretty clear that Donald Trump values his personal relationship with [Chinese President] Xi Jinping and seems to have some fondness for President Xi. However, he also remembers that during his first term, many of Beijing’s actions – handling of Covid, crackdown on Hong Kong protests and treatment of Uygurs – cemented frustration and mistrust in Washington. It’s a very different environment than it was eight years ago.\nTrump seems to suggest Taiwan should pay more for its defence – or might not even be worth the US defending. What should we make of his comments and his policy towards Taiwan, which has been a thorny issue between Beijing and Washington?\nTrump wants every US ally and partner to spend more on its own defence. His comments are consistent with what he has said to Nato, South Korea and Taiwan specifically. He seems to be messaging that the United States can’t want your security more than you do. The message is clear: the US will not do more to support Taiwan’s defence and its right to exist as a democratic community than Taiwan itself is willing to do.\nThis message is not inconsistent with what the Biden, Obama or Bush administrations conveyed to authorities in Taiwan, though they did so privately.\nIt is challenging to convey this publicly without risking the credibility of US commitments, undermining deterrence or opening the door to misinterpretation by decision-makers in Beijing. How Trump himself feels about Taiwan is unclear.\nHowever, it is clear that he values his image as a strong leader and America’s image as a strong power. My expectation is that he would perceive any aggressive move against Taiwan by Beijing as a direct challenge to him, and he would not simply let it pass. While he might not act on principle, that doesn’t mean he wouldn’t act.\nEscalating military pressure by Beijing could make Taiwan’s security an issue he cares about, especially if he sees it as a test of not just America’s but also his own credibility\nWashington signed an intelligence-sharing deal with Manila recently and plans to deploy more missiles to Japan. How would these play out in US management of tension in the Taiwan Strait during Trump’s second term?\nAll the moves we see in national security by the United States, in cooperation with allies like Japan and the Philippines, are aimed at strengthening deterrence.\nThe issue, however, is that it’s difficult for one country to show resolve without potentially signalling to the other side that it has aggressive intentions. This is what experts refer to as a “security dilemma”.\nOne side feels threatened and defensive, so any defensive measures it takes are perceived by the other side, which also feels threatened, as actions that need to be countered. This leads to mutual suspicion, fear and an escalating cycle of tension – that’s the essence of the security dilemma.\nYou can take actions to reassure your own side, but it’s very challenging to do so in a way that doesn’t make Beijing feel threatened. That being said, if you compare the activities of the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) in the Taiwan Strait over the years – say, in 2024, compared to 2020, 2016, 2012 or 2008 – you can clearly see a sharp escalation in military threats and pressure. Given this, governments in the United States, Japan and other nations can be forgiven for thinking that Beijing is using the threat of military force to intimidate and eventually coerce or dominate Taiwan.\nThis is unacceptable to the international community and Taiwan’s security, for a variety of reasons, has now become a global concern, extending well beyond just the Asia-Pacific region.\nWhat risks do you see in the South China Sea in Trump’s second term? Is there any way to avoid major conflict?\nThe primary risk isn’t necessarily the arrival of another Trump administration but rather the possibility of China testing the limits of what its neighbours and the US are willing to tolerate.\nThere’s a significant danger of accidents, miscalculations and a lack of mechanisms to prevent incidents from escalating into crises or outright conflict. Even without direct conflict, instability in the South China Sea – a vital artery for global trade – has severe economic consequences which the world can ill afford.\nChina’s use of “grey zone” tactics has escalated over the years. These include deploying vessels that appear to be coastguard ships but perform military functions like harassment and intimidation. While the Philippines has been a primary target, Vietnam, Malaysia and Indonesia have also faced such actions, raising the risk of a broader crisis.\nAvoiding conflict is possible. Many territorial disputes worldwide have been resolved or shelved. For example, [former Chinese leader] Deng Xiaoping once suggested postponing the resolution of a territorial dispute between China and Japan until a wiser generation could address it. This approach of shelving disputes or resolving them diplomatically remains viable.\nMoreover, adherence to international law, specifically the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS), is crucial. Both China and the Philippines are signatories, and the UNCLOS tribunal has ruled that China’s territorial claims in the Philippines’ exclusive economic zone are invalid. This ruling undermines the legal basis for China’s actions and highlights the need for it to withdraw paramilitary vessels from the area.\nVietnam stands out for its resolute defence of sovereignty, showing no signs of submission to Beijing. While Vietnam is unlikely to align as a US treaty ally, it will continue to safeguard its national interests.\nIncreased pressure on countries like Vietnam and the Philippines could lead to greater resistance and potentially stronger regional unity among Southeast Asian nations, particularly those in Asean. Though countries like Laos, Cambodia and Brunei may abstain, others could form a formidable bloc, a prospect likely concerning Beijing.\n\nYou were a major figure behind the “pivot to Asia” strategy to relocate US resources and attention back to the Asia-Pacific region during the Obama administration. After more than a decade, how do you see this strategy working?\nThe credit for the “pivot to Asia” belongs to Barack Obama. It wasn’t an abstract policy experiment but a recognition of the US’s vital interests in the Asia-Pacific region. Obama, having spent part of his youth in Southeast Asia and Hawaii, understood the need for a strong US presence in the region. The policy emerged as a response to the overemphasis on Middle East conflicts during the Bush administration, shifting focus to the dynamic and innovative economies of East Asia.\nThe rebalance prioritised strengthening alliances, fostering new partnerships and engaging with China’s rise constructively. Obama welcomed a stable and prosperous China, provided it adhered to international norms. However, efforts to engage China were often met with frustration as the country turned increasingly authoritarian.\nCongress, especially under Republican control, underfunded many initiatives tied to the rebalance. A significant regret was the US’ failure to finalise its participation in the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP), which would have cemented American leadership in trade and regional standards. Trump’s withdrawal from the TPP and his America first approach further undermined US influence, alienating allies by prioritising unilateralism over shared values.\nDespite this, Beijing’s assertive actions have pushed countries like Japan, South Korea and others in the region closer to the US. The sustainability of US commitments remains a concern, but China’s behaviour has encouraged stronger alignment with Washington.\nThe potential of alliances like Aukus and the Quad depends on whether future administrations will invest the effort needed to realise their promise.\nNorth Korean leader Kim Jong-un said his past negotiations with the US only confirmed that Washington bore “unchangeable” hostility towards his country, and said his nuclear build-up was the only way to counter external threats. What might be the bottom line for Kim when it comes to dealing with the US?\nWell, first of all, North Korea’s rhetoric about the US “hostile policy” has been something I’ve heard now for decades, not just from Kim Jong-un, but from [his father and grandfather] Kim Jong-il and Kim Il-sung as well. It’s simply an alibi for why North Korea can do whatever it wants, including illegally pursuing weapons of mass destruction.\nThe “bogeyman” image of a US hostile policy, this external threat, is a very convenient tool for domestic propaganda. It’s an excuse the Kim family uses for why its promises have been broken and why its domestic policies have failed. Everything is blamed on the American hostile policy.\nKim’s basic bottom line is regime survival, and nuclear weapons are non-negotiable for him. The United States has been very elastic in its approach.\nEach of the three Kims sought a meeting with the sitting president of the United States because of the status they would gain. At the end of his term, Clinton came close to agreeing to meet Kim Jong-il but a meeting did not take place, although after leaving office he travelled to Pyongyang to gain the release of two American hostages. Kim Jong-un jumped at the opportunity to meet Donald Trump and was ready to make deals, albeit on his terms.\nThe way to think about Kim Jong-un’s ambition is that he seeks to develop his nuclear and missile systems through what’s called nuclear second-strike capability. Essentially, he wants to make his arsenal large and diversified enough that he feels the US cannot risk retaliating against North Korea for any act of aggression. Even if the US decided to launch a punitive strike against North Korea, it would know that some of Kim’s missiles would survive and have the ability to strike the US after Pyongyang is wiped out. That’s what second-strike capability is.\nIf Kim can reach a point where he believes he can act with relative impunity, where he feels that the US deterrent has been neutralised, I think, ironically, he’ll want to negotiate. But these negotiations will be strictly on his terms. He will want to negotiate the reduction of US forces in Asia, not the reduction of his nuclear stockpile. We’ve already seen the results of Trump’s experiment with diplomacy, and it proved that North Korea is absolutely determined to retain and expand its nuclear programme.\nWhat that means for the rest of the world is that the only realistic options are to bolster defence against North Korea and to strengthen deterrence so that North Korea never decides it’s safe to commit aggression.\nAs for the possibility of a world war involving Korea, nobody wants a nuclear war. I tend to think the probability of war is low, but it’s not zero. There is a significant risk of miscalculation by Kim Jong-un that could lead to a crisis that spirals out of control. There can be no effective restraint on Kim Jong-un without US-China collaboration – absolutely impossible.\nIf the Ukraine war truly could be ended as quickly as Trump says, how would this play out in relation to North Korea and China?\nThat’s pretty far out of my area of expertise, but I think Trump’s claim that he could end the war in a day, or on his first day, is highly implausible. If he could somehow get President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine to surrender, maybe it would happen, but he can’t. That said, the withdrawal of US military and financial support to Ukraine would cause a lot more death and suffering for the victims of Russia’s aggression.\nIt’s conceivable that Trump as the US president could engineer a ceasefire in place, but the concern is that this would only buy time for Russian forces to recover, regroup, and launch a more powerful assault against Ukraine. Putin has made clear that his goal is not just to peel off a few pieces of Ukrainian territory but to dominate and subjugate the entire nation.\nRight now, the war is not going well for Putin – thousands of Russians are being killed. If you have to turn to North Korea for soldiers to fight your war, it shows that your military is not doing well.\nPutin’s aggression against Ukraine has put Beijing in a terrible position. Respect for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of a sovereign nation, a UN member, is a very fundamental principle for the [People’s Republic of China], and there’s just no way of viewing Putin’s attack as anything other than a violation of that principle.\nFrom the very beginning, Beijing has been in an impossible situation – unable to really help Moscow, but unwilling to not help. So it’s the worst of both worlds, and Beijing has lost immense credibility with Europe. It’s hard to see how the Chinese government could use its strategic leverage with Moscow in concert with Europe and the United States to help broker a durable settlement.\nUnfortunately, I don’t think the prospects for a durable resolution of the war in Ukraine look good any time soon.\nRussia and North Korea are becoming closer allies, with Putin bringing North Koreans in to fight for Moscow in the Ukraine war. How much influence does China still have in the Korean peninsula? How would the changing dynamics affect Japan and South Korea’s ties with China?\nThe only two people who benefit from the enhanced relationship between North Korea and Moscow are Vladimir Putin and Kim Jong-un. Everyone else is a loser, including China, the US and the rest of the world.\nFrom my experience, Beijing has always been very reluctant to use its leverage over North Korea, even though it has tremendous leverage. This reluctance has resulted in Beijing having very little influence. You only have influence if the other side believes in you or believes that you’re willing to use it. Pyongyang has always tried to play Moscow and Beijing off against each other, but it’s never been particularly successful – until now.\nNow, the situation has changed. First, Russia desperately needs help. Putin isn’t paying North Korean mercenaries because the war in Ukraine is going well, but it is because he is desperate.\nSecond, Pyongyang has become more successful because China’s relationship with the United States is so poor. The US and China are finding it impossible to coordinate or cooperate, and these two factors have made North Korea much more powerful in terms of its ability to manipulate major powers.\nThere’s no question that an empowered North Korea hurts Beijing’s interests. It dramatically raises risks, complicates China’s foreign policy, and undermines regional stability. It also drives Japan and South Korea closer together and fosters more trilateral security cooperation. Furthermore, it encourages European involvement in the Asia-Pacific region, which is the last thing Beijing wants.\nThe Moscow-Pyongyang connection creates serious complexities for China. It risks dragging China into conflicts that it doesn’t want to be involved in and has badly damaged China’s relationship with Europe. At a minimum, this association saddles China with reputational costs, without any tangible benefits. Beijing is not profiting in any way.\nIn the end, China seems stuck in this association with Moscow and Pyongyang, but is clearly on the losing end of this equation.\n\nHow much influence could Elon Musk have on US China policy? Will he help generate new, game-changing momentum in the space race between the two countries?\nThat’s an interesting question, and honestly, I’m not sure I’m the right person to answer it. Elon Musk has certainly achieved phenomenal success, especially in space. We have to give him immense credit for his innovation and technological expertise, not just in space but across many fields. His work has been truly impressive.\nWe’re in a complicated time because, in some ways, the private sector is outpacing governments in space technology. This is also true for other emerging tech sectors. The old pattern of military inventions flowing to the commercial sector is no longer the case; now, innovation is often coming from private companies and labs.\nAs for how much influence Elon Musk will have, or how he might interact with the Trump administration, it’s hard to predict. In US politics, there’s a saying: “The United States only has one president at a time.” This typically applies to the transition period when the president-elect Donald Trump doesn’t take office until January 20, and until then, President Joe Biden is in charge.\nI think that saying could apply to the relationship between Trump and Musk as well. Both are huge figures, but only one can hold the presidential office. I suspect they both feel equally qualified, and maybe, over time, the pressure will be too much, and Trump and Musk will go their separate ways. But again, it’s really anyone’s guess.","url":"https://www.scmp.com/news/china/diplomacy/article/3293481/how-trumps-self-image-strong-leader-and-us-strong-power-may-play-out-taiwan","image":"https://cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2025/01/05/373bfc7c-e789-443b-a1df-9b20c808403f_c3bf6609.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-01-06 00:41:13","author":"Sylvie Zhuang","authors":["Sylvie Zhuang"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"hk","sentiment":0.095},{"id":278531454,"title":"Editorial | Strong gains in MPF provide a measure of relief for Hong Kong pensioners","text":"Good news has been a long time coming for Hong Kong’s compulsory retirement savers.\nAfter a meagre investment gain of 3.5 per cent in 2023, which hardly offset a loss of 15.7 per cent in 2022, the Mandatory Provident Fund scheme is on course to report its best performance in four years in 2024, thanks partly to strong gains by stock funds.\nMoreover, most analysts believe the MPF will maintain a positive trajectory next year.\nMid-December, the MPF’s 379 investment funds had an estimated gain of HK$102.8 billion for this year, the third time the fund’s gain had exceeded HK$100 billion, according to MPF Ratings, an independent research firm.\nDespite the bumper result, the question remains whether retirement and social welfare protection are adequate. The answer remains “no”.\nMid-year the MPF had an average of HK$258,000 for each of its 4.7 members, based on assets of HK$1.23 trillion, according to MPF Ratings.\nThat is hardly enough for a decent living standard in Hong Kong, even counting welfare for those who meet a means test.\nThe US stock funds were the best performers so far this year, boasting a 21.5 per cent gain, followed by Japanese stock funds at 18.7 per cent, with China and Hong Kong stock funds ranked third at 15.5 per cent.\nAnalysts predict investor appetite for such higher risk assets in the coming year, given the tax and trade policies of president-elect Donald Trump.\nApart from a more positive socio-economic approach to an ageing population, the government has taken measures to enhance the MPF scheme, including a one-stop online platform that makes active, informed management of retirement savings more convenient.\nIt is now up to often-criticised fund managers to play their part in maximising the social and economic benefits of compulsory retirement savings schemes, subject to the limitations of relatively low contribution rates.\nThe lack of an official retirement age in a fast ageing society also opens the way for employers to adopt more flexible work practices.\nAmid a rocky recovery, it is not surprising to hear that many Hongkongers might have to work past the usual retirement age to cover a shortfall in their pension savings.\nAccording to investment manager Schroders, the average Hongkonger faces a HK$2.4 million gap between expected post-retirement expenses and the money available in pension funds.\nNearly three-quarters of respondents expected to have to work beyond retirement, compared with 40 per cent who expect to do so in the United States.","url":"https://www.scmp.com/opinion/comment/article/3293516/strong-gains-mpf-provide-measure-relief-hong-kong-pensioners","image":"https://cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2025/01/05/d095d8bd-9ea5-4fcf-8a68-d8e45d215f1e_8b41dafd.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-01-06 00:41:13","author":"Scmp Editorial","authors":["Scmp Editorial"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"hk","sentiment":0.025},{"id":278531456,"title":"Hongkongers’ start-up eyes 100,000 global investment pros as market for AI tool","text":"A technology start-up led by Hongkongers including a former Goldman Sachs analyst aims to help finance professionals and investors globally make better investment decisions with its artificial-intelligence (AI) chatbot that can perform rounds of “thinking and reasoning”.\nArbor’s AI chatbot ArborChat leverages large language models (LLMs) to analyse text and extract investment ideas to enhance fundamental stock analysis, the company said. About 100 firms have used it in trials, and a few have paid for the system, which was launched two months ago, according to Cheney Cheng, Arbor co-founder and CEO. The goal is to grow the client base to 100,000 in three years, targeting the global fund industry, he said.\n“We believe this wave of AI is unlocking a big blue ocean in the investment area given the ability of AI to understand and analyse tasks efficiently beyond human capability,” Cheng said. “There will be a lot of uncaptured, profitable ideas.”\nInvestment has traditionally been “the crystal of humanity’s wisdom”, given the amount of information and the complex analysis skills required, making it one of the hardest areas for AI to conquer, said Cheng, a former banker in mergers and acquisitions who started his career in fundamental equity investment at Goldman Sachs Asset Management.\nAs the technology evolves, AI can now help with more sophisticated tasks.\nFor example, when asked how US president-elect Donald Trump’s policies will impact companies, or a list of thousands of stocks, ArborChat would go through various steps to break down the question and collect appropriate data before providing answers backed by databases within a few minutes.\nThe process is what the firm calls a “ThoughtTree” approach, emulating how humans would answer a question. ArborChat typically performs two rounds of questioning and three layers of analysis, and the company plans to increase this as the chip industry matures and computational power increases, Cheng said.\n“To answer an investment question – or basically to answer anything that requires some thinking – we need multiple steps and to gather new information in each of the steps,” he said. The basic AI models lack that ability, as “they do not search and follow up”, Cheng added.\nChatGPT creator OpenAI and a slew of Chinese technology firms have rushed to unveil advanced AI models that claim to have reasoning skills in recent months.\nArbor’s AI tool is more tailored to the investment community and will be invaluable amid market uncertainties, Cheng said.\n“The market is going to be very unpredictable, with a lot of major events that could impact it,” he said. “This kind of AI not only saves [analysts] a lot of time but also enables them to have a real-time response no matter what happens in the market.”\n\nA portfolio adjusted according to ArborChat’s buy/sell/hold signals delivered a 41.75 per cent profit from October 2023 to September 2024, higher than the 34.25 per cent return in a benchmark, the Bloomberg 100 Index, Arbor said in November.\nThe AI chatbot currently covers US, Chinese and Japanese stocks, cryptocurrencies and foreign exchange, with plans to expand into other asset classes, including bonds and funds.\nLast week, Arbor launched a feature that allows users to upload private documents. Fund managers can upload investment memos and private equity investors can upload deal documents to use the AI chatbot as an investment due diligence tool in a secured environment.\nEstablished in 2018 by Cheng and his team, Arbor has provided AI solutions to banks and fund houses.

And a large number of people in the United States, under those conditions, look to firearms to reestablish some sense of safety and security,” he said.\n\nMatthew Thompson, of Oakland, NJ, told the outlet he was inspired to buy his first gun after the 2016 mass shooting at Pulse — a gay nightclub in Orlando, Fla. — in which 49 people were killed.\n\nThe Pulse attack, which stands as the worst mass shooting in US history, was carried out by a homegrown Islamic terrorist sympathizer named Omar Mateen. \n\nBoth then-President Barack Obama and then-presidential candidate Donald Trump denounced the horrific slaughter as a direct attack on the LGBTQ community. However, evidence unearthed in the years that followed indicates Mateen had no idea Pulse was a gay nightclub when he started opening fire.\n\nThompson, who the outlet writes travels the country to attend “leather and bear events,” has been working to sharpen his gun skills at home, including wearing his gun around the house and quickly drawing it upon the completion of a timer on his phone.\n\n“The people I’ve been seeing on the left and the gay people who are out purchasing guns for the first time, it’s all about self-defense and fear,” said Thompson, 36. “We’re not looking to arm up and storm the capital. We just don’t want to be put in concentration camps.”\n\nMeanwhile, a recent Gallup poll shows the number of Republican women packing heat is also on the rise, with 33% saying they own a gun between 2019-2024 compared to just 19% in the period between 2007-2012.\n\nAt the same time, the proportion of Democratic men who own guns has declined in recent years, falling from 36% between 2007-2012 to just 29% between 2019-2024.","summary":"Gay and transgender liberals around the country are arming themselves over perceived concerns they'll be rounded up and placed in \"concentration camps\" under a second Trump administration.","url":"https://nypost.com/2025/01/05/us-news/lgbtq-liberals-start-arming-themselves-over-baseless-fear-of-being-placed-in-concentration-camps-report/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/01/96269190.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/o057uYdx-RyIcpnTz.mp4","publish_date":"2025-01-06 00:35:35","author":"Chris Nesi","authors":["Chris Nesi"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.107},{"id":278530678,"title":"Aussie dollar crashes to five-year low","text":"The AUD hit 61.84 US cents during Thursday morning’s trading – a dip not seen since April 7, 2020, when it hit 61.85 US cents – but has since risen slightly to 61.89 cents. \n\nAt the same time, the AUD has also fallen against the pound, buying just 0.49 British pence. \n\nMore and more experts are now predicting the Aussie dollar will soon sink to 60 US cents and below, with Macquarie Bank Ltd Singapore foreign exchange and rates strategist Gareth Berry telling Bloomberg that “A slide all the way to 60 cents is conceivable in the risk case where US equities take fright at an unfolding global trade war, China’s fiscal counter-stimulus is inadequate, and the RBA is forced to cut quickly to lend support”.\n\nMeanwhile, Westpac’s head of foreign exchange strategy Richard Franulovich told the publication there were signs the RBA could potentially cut interest rates at its February meeting, claiming the minutes from the RBA’s December meeting hinted it could soon be “relaxing the degree of monetary policy tightness”.\n\nMORE: Sign RBA is creating ticking time bomb\n\nExperts say the weakness in the Aussie dollar reflects overseas factors in China and the US.\n\nChief strategist at the MB Fund and MB Super, David Llewellyn-Smith, recently said that Australia’s economic prospects have “rarely been more gloomy”, while the US economy “is in rude health”. \n\n“Its household sector is deleveraged.

Here are 5 things to look for","text":"After a rocky few years and the disbanding of the Hollywood Foreign Press Association, the Golden Globes have seemingly stabilized. Now the question is: Can they still put on a good show?\n\n\r\n The 82nd Golden Globes, beginning Sunday night at 8 p.m. EST, will hope to rekindle some of the frothy comic energy of the days when Ricky Gervais or Tina Fey and Amy Poehler hosted. Last year's comeback edition, hosted by Jo Koy, was widely panned, but it delivered where it counted: Ratings rebounded to about 10 million viewers, according to Nielsen. CBS signed up for five more years.\n\n\r\n\r\n The information you need to know, sent directly to you: Download the CTV News App\r\n\n\r\n This time, comedian Nikki Glaser will be emceeing the ceremony from the Beverly Hilton in Beverly Hills, California. The Globes, now owned by Todd Boehly's Eldridge Industries and Dick Clark Productions, will be broadcast live by CBS and available to stream live for subscribers to Paramount+ with Showtime beginning at 8 p.m. Eastern.\n\n\r\n While Glaser doesn't have as widely seen contenders as last year, when “Oppenheimer” and “Barbie” were the headliners, the show does promise about as much star power as Hollywood can muster. Nominees including Zendaya, Timothée Chalamet, Angelina Jolie, Daniel Craig, Denzel Washington, Ariana Grande, Cynthia Erivo and Selena Gomez.\n\n\r\n Jacques Audiard's Netflix musical “Emilia Pérez” comes in as the lead nominee, with 10 nods, followed by Brady Corbet's postwar epic “The Brutalist,” with seven, and Edward Berger's papal thriller “Conclave,” with six. Among the top-nominated series are “The Bear,” “Shogun\" and “Only Murders in the Building.”\n\n\r\n Here are a few things to look for heading into Sunday's Globes:\n\n\r\n Will Timothée Chalamet win his first Globe?\n\n\r\n The best actor in a drama category is a bruiser, with a field of Ralph Fiennes (\"Conclave\"), Adrien Brody (\"The Brutalist\"), Daniel Craig (\"Queer\"), Colman Domingo (\"Sing Sing\"), Sebastian Stan (\"The Apprentice\") and Chalamet, for the Bob Dylan film “A Complete Unknown.” While Fiennes or Brody might take it, a win for Chalamet would be the first major award for the 29-year-old star — and surely would get the Oscar talk going.\n\n\r\n How soon until someone mentions Hollywood's biggest feud?\n\n\r\n Just days before the Globes, Blake Lively sued “It Ends With Us” director Justin Baldoni and several others tied to the romantic drama, alleging harassment and a coordinated campaign to attack her reputation for coming forward about her treatment on the set. Baldoni, who has denied it, joined in a suit accusing The New York Times for libel in its story on her allegations.\n\n\r\n Whether or not any of this gets mentioned on the Beverly Hilton Ballroom stage, it will surely be on the minds of many attendees. Among the nominees for box-office achievement is “Deadpool & Wolverine,” which star and was co-produced by Ryan Reynolds, Lively's husband. Glaser, whose sharply barbed jokes at a roast of Tom Brady helped catapult her to this moment, isn't known for biting her tongue.\n\n\r\n How will ‘Wicked’ fare?\n\n\r\n “Emilia Pérez” may have be favored over “Wicked” for the best comedy or musical award, but Jon M. Chu’s theatrical hit is also in the mix for the Globes’ nascent cinematic box office achievement award. Either, or both, of the leading ladies of ”Wicked” could also win: Erivo in the leading actress category, and Grande in supporting.\n\n\r\n Will politics play a starring role?\n\n\r\n The Globes, taking place about two weeks before the inauguration of President-elect Donald Trump, could get very political if presenters and winners are so inclined to continue what's been a mutually antagonistic relationship between Hollywood and Trump. That may be unlikely, though; so far in Hollywood's awards season, most nominees have tried to stay out of the fray.\n\n\r\n That's with a major exception, though, in “The Apprentice,” the young Trump drama starring Sebastian Stan and Jeremy Strong. Both were nominated by the Globes. Stan was also nominated a second time for his performance in “A Different Man.”\n\n\r\n\r\n Top entertainment headlines, all in one place\r\n\n\r\n Is there an Oscar frontrunner?\n\n\r\n It's been an unusually uncertain awards season so far in many respects. No one movie has really stepped forward as the leading best picture contender, though several films — including “Conclave,” “Anora,” “Wicked,\" “Emilia Pérez” and “The Brutalist” — can all make a decent case. The Globes don't typically do much to sort out the field, but a strong showing from any of the above could add fuel to their Oscar campaign.","summary":"After a rocky few years and the disbanding of the Hollywood Foreign Press Association, the Golden Globes have seemingly stabilized.

war’","text":"Israel risks triggering a large-scale war if it launches another military attack on Tehran, Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi told Chinese media, emphasizing his country’s commitment to diplomatic efforts alongside full readiness to respond to any aggression.\n\nThe longstanding shadow conflict between Israel and Iran has escalated into several direct military confrontations over the past year, which could potentially spiral out of control unless diplomacy prevails, Araghchi stated during a December interview with China’s CCTV, aired on Saturday.\n\n“We are fully prepared for the possibility of further attacks by Israel,” Araghchi said. “I hope Israel will refrain from taking such reckless actions, as it could lead to a large-scale war.”\n\n“We believe that reason will ultimately prevail and prevent actions that could have serious consequences,” he added, stressing Iran’s dedication to engaging with regional and international allies, including China, to mitigate tensions and pursue peaceful resolutions.\n\nWhile Tehran-allied Houthi forces have launched multiple ballistic missiles at central Israel in recent weeks and the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) bombed Yemen in response – the most recent direct exchange of fire occurred in October. During that confrontation, Israel conducted a large-scale airstrike targeting Iran’s radar and air defense systems, in retaliation for an Iranian ballistic missile attack on Israel. That Iranian assault was itself a response to the assassinations of key figures allied with Tehran, including Hamas political leader Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran and Hezbollah’s Hassan Nasrallah in Beirut.\n\nEarlier, in April, the sides exchanged fire after an Israeli airstrike on the Iranian consulate in Damascus, Syria, which reportedly resulted in the deaths of two Iranian generals and several officers of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC). In retaliation, Iran launched over 300 drones and missiles in an unprecedented direct attack on Israel.\n\nRecent developments in the Middle East, including the fall of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad and the substantial weakening of Hezbollah, have significantly altered the region’s strategic balance. Israeli and US officials reportedly perceive Tehran as increasingly vulnerable, sparking discussions about potential preemptive military actions.\n\nThe Israeli Air Force reportedly enhanced its operational readiness in December, capitalizing on the neutralization of Syrian air defenses to facilitate unimpeded access to Iranian airspace. Israeli defense officials assess that current conditions present a strategic window for a potential strike.\n\nLast month, US President Joe Biden reportedly convened a high-level meeting to discuss possible military action against Iran, amid concerns that Tehran might accelerate its nuclear weapons development due to its weakened regional position.\n\nIran has consistently denied pursuing nuclear weapons, maintaining that its nuclear program is intended solely for peaceful purposes. In a separate interview published on Thursday, Araghchi reiterated Tehran’s stance on peaceful nuclear energy, emphasizing that negotiations remain possible if Iran is treated with “respect.”\n\n“The more they impose sanctions and pressure on Iran, the more Iran will show resistance,” Araghchi said, warning that coercion would be ineffective. He specifically referenced the ‘maximum pressure’ policy employed by the US during President-elect Donald Trump’s first term.","summary":"Israel risks triggering a large-scale war if it launches another military attack on Tehran, Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi has said \nRead Full Article at RT.com","url":"https://www.rt.com/news/610480-iran-warns-israel-war/","image":"https://mf.b37mrtl.ru/files/2025.01/article/677b1f7585f54049ec4002ca.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-01-06 00:15:55","author":null,"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"ru","sentiment":0.119},{"id":278527088,"title":"RuPaul’s Drag Race star The Vivienne dies aged 32","text":"RuPaul’s Drag Race star The Vivienne has died aged 32, their publicist has said.\n\nJames Lee Williams, who performed as the drag queen, won the first series of RuPaul’s Drag Race UK and came third on the 2023 edition of Dancing On Ice.\n\nWilliams, who was born in Wales, adopted the drag name as they were known for wearing Vivienne Westwood clothing.\n\nTheir publicist, Simon Jones, announced the news on Sunday evening, writing that Williams was an “incredibly loved, warm-hearted and amazing person”.\n\nIn a post on Instagram, Mr Jones added: “It is with immense sadness that we let you know our beloved James Lee Williams – The Vivienne, has passed this weekend.\n\n“Their family are heartbroken at the loss of their son, brother and uncle. They are so proud of the wonderful things James achieved in their life and career.\n\n“We please ask that James’s family are given the time and privacy they now need to process and grieve.”\n\nMr Jones added that Williams would be remembered for their “immense talent” and “the light they brought to every room was astonishing”.\n\nIn a tribute on Instagram, he added: “These are words I never ever wanted to write. Viv was a close friend, a client and someone I loved very much.\n\n“Their comic genius and quick wit was like no other.”\n\nRuPaul’s Drag Race judge Michelle Visage paid tribute to Williams, saying they were “a beacon to so many”.\n\nAlongside pictures of them together, Visage wrote on Instagram: “Heartbreaking, I don’t know how to say how I feel.\n\n“My darling @thevivienne_ we go back to when I started coming over here to the UK. You were always there, always laughing, always giving, always on point.\n\nYou were a beacon to so manyMichelle Visage\n\n“Your laughter, your wit, your talent, your drag. I loved all of it but I loved your friendship most of all.\n\n“You were a beacon to so many. Seeing you make your West End debut was amazing for me to witness your dream come true right in front of my eyes, I’m the lucky one to have known you and to have laughed together with you so many times.”\n\nWilliams performed as the Wicked Witch of the West in a UK and Ireland tour of The Wizard Of Oz musical and reprised the role in the West End at the Gillian Lynne Theatre last year.\n\nThey were due to be back on tour next month performing in the Chitty Chitty Bang Bang musical in the role of the Childcatcher.\n\nThe Vivienne also competed on an all-winners season of the RuPaul franchise in the US in 2022, the only UK contestant for that series.\n\nThey also starred in BBC Three show The Vivienne Takes On Hollywood in 2020, which saw them make their first music video.\n\nThey were joined each week by a different celebrity who helped them, with guests including Broadway star Marissa Jaret Winokur and American comedian Bruce Vilanch.\n\nSpeaking in 2019 ahead of competing in the first series of RuPaul’s Drag Race UK, The Vivienne explained their name saying: “I love Vivienne Westwood and when I moved to Liverpool everyone used to call me Vivienne as I was head to toe in Westwood.\n\n“So when I started doing drag it was a natural progression, but I didn’t want one of those cheap, nasty, slutty drag names so I thought of ‘The Vivienne’ and here she is, there’s only one of them.”\n\nThe Vivienne said of their drag style: “My style is like a Scouse wife who has come into money, she moved to LA and blew it all and then she’s had to move back to Liverpool.\n\n“I like to have a really fierce look, but I like to be hilarious on stage so I’m kind of an old school and the new school put together which I think works.\n\n“Comedy is definitely my trump card. My favourite trick in drag is my vocal impersonations so I do everyone from Kim Woodburn, Cilla Black, Donald Trump – you name it, I’ll do it – for the right price.”\n\nFollowing their win in 2019, The Vivienne said they were “made up” adding: “That crown is going to look gorgeous, I can see me there washing the dishes in it.”\n\nThe Vivienne landed in the finale alongside Baga Chipz and Divina De Campo, with judge Graham Norton saying in the final critique ahead of the winner being named that The Vivienne had “it all”.\n\nNorton explained: “You know she can serve a look, she can deliver a line, she’s without doubt a terrific drag queen, drag act.”\n\nJudge Alan Carr said: “She’s got that trademark wit, when she was Trump, oh my god, that was the best Trump I’ve ever seen. It was a comedy masterclass.”\n\nRuPaul’s Drag Race said it was “deeply saddened to learn of the passing of The Vivienne”.\n\nIn a post on social media, the television show said Williams’s “talent, humour, and dedication to the art of drag was an inspiration”.\n\nFiona Campbell, BBC controller of youth audience, said the news was “deeply sad”, adding that the broadcaster was “fiercely proud of The Vivienne’s achievements”.\n\nRuPaul’s Drag Race UK star Bimini Bon Boulash responded to the news on Instagram, writing: “I’m so sorry I’m in total shock.”\n\nCoronation Street star Antony Cotton said it was “unbelievably sad” and Emmerdale actress Lisa Riley referred to The Vivienne as an “incredible human” who will be missed.\n\nThe Vivienne was among the line-up for Channel 4’s Celebrity Hunted for Stand Up To Cancer in 2022.\n\nAhead of being seen on screen, they spoke about Lily Savage, the late Paul O’Grady’s drag character, being an inspiration.\n\nThey said at the time: “I still watch all the old Lily shows on YouTube. Obviously, coming from this neck of the woods as well (Liverpool). Lily at the heart of it, is a stand-up comedian, she’s a character, she’s fun and that’s what I love.\n\n“Drag is fun, but drag is serious as well, but it’s finding a nice mix of the two. Drag Race shows the humans behind the make-up.\n\n“We’re just people with the same struggles as everyone else. But we get to kind of paint on a persona and make people laugh, give people a good time and put on a good show.

Mr Musk claimed on Jan 3 that Prime Minister Keir Starmer was “complicit in the rape of Britain” and should face charges for his actions as the country’s chief prosecutor.\n\nIn that role from 2008 to 2013, Mr Starmer began the prosecution of so-called grooming gangs in British towns. In his final year in office, he ordered a wholesale restructuring of how Britain deals with child abuse cases, saying the legal system had failed victims.\n\nHealth secretary Wes Streeting pushed back against Mr Musk’s attacks in broadcast interviews with Sky News and the BBC on Jan 5, arguing that the Trump confidante can do more to combat abuse in his role as a social media platform owner.\n\n“It’s a ridiculous thing to say. It’s ill-informed,” Mr Streeting said. “If he wants to roll his sleeves up and actually do something about tackling violence against women and girls, then online platforms, whether X or any of the other platforms, have got a role to play in keeping people safe.”\n\nIt is not the first time that Mr Musk has waded into British politics. Since Mr Starmer won the general election in July 2024, Mr Musk has regularly criticised the Labour government and is now calling for a new vote and urging Britons to back Mr Nigel Farage’s Reform party.\n\n“He’s got a big platform, he’s got a big voice, so he can say what he likes,” Mr Streeting said about Mr Musk. “What we’re focused on is making sure we deliver justice to make sure we tackle violence against women and girls.”\n\nMr Musk has also targeted safeguarding minister Jess Phillips with inflammatory language, calling for her to resign. That is over her decision to reject a request by Oldham Council in northern England to launch a government-led inquiry into child sexual abuse in the town, favoring a local investigation instead. Ms Phillips’ decision was in line with similar probes set up in Rochdale and Telford.\n\nIn a letter to the Oldham administration seen by the BBC, Ms Phillips said council-run inquiries had greater legitimacy because they were locally commissioned and delivered.\n\nOn Jan 5, Mr Streeting said it was “a disgraceful smear of a great woman who has spent her life supporting victims of the kind of violence Musk and others say they’re against”.\n\nBefore becoming an MP, Ms Phillips worked for the charity Women’s Aid to develop services for victims of domestic abuse, sexual violence, human trafficking and exploitation.

The 119th Congress has been sworn in and Senate confirmation hearings are set to begin January 14, with Trump's nominee for Secretary of Defense, Pete Hegseth. \n\nTrump's nominees have already faced a significant amount of scrutiny (#BecauseTrump), so I thought it might be interesting to compare how President Joe Biden's Cabinet nominees were treated by the Senate (then-controlled by his own party 50-48, plus two Independents who largely caucused with the Democrats) to how Trump's were (and ultimately, will be). \n\nThe first thing to note is that all but two of Biden's nominees were confirmed. Neera Tanden's nomination for Director of the Office of Management and Budget was withdrawn on March 2, 2021, after significant opposition was raised during the confirmation process. And Acting Secretary of Labor Julie Su's nomination to the role has largely stalled out, though not for lack of trying. \n\nREAD MORE: Neera Tanden Got the Clemenza Treatment at the Hands of the Socialist Godfather Bernie Sanders\n\nOf those confirmed, the only ones that went straight party-line were Xavier Becerra as Secretary of Health and Human Services (confirmed March 18, 2021, 50-49), Jared Bernstein as Chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers (confirmed June 13, 2023, 50-49). Deb Haaland narrowly made the cut (51-40) as Secretary of the Interior on March 15, 2021, but that included four Republican \"yes\" votes, making up for three Democrat abstentions. \n\nIt bears noting, however, that none of Biden's nominees received Democrat \"no\" votes. \n\nAlright, so how did the votes go down for Trump's nominees in his first term? That was, of course, the 115th Congress, and Republicans held a 52-48 majority to start. One nominee (Andy Puzder for Secretary of Labor) was withdrawn once it became clear he did not have sufficient Republican support. Another, John Ratcliffe, for Director of National Intelligence, was initially withdrawn after his 2019 nomination to replace Dan Coats but then resubmitted in February 2020 and ultimately squeaked by 49-44 in May of 2020. \n\nMick Mulvaney just managed to make the cut as Director of the Office of Management and Budget 51-49, with John McCain (R) joining ranks with the Democrats to vote against him. In fact, six Republicans voted against at least one Trump nominee, with Susan Collins (ME), Rand Paul (KY), and McCain (AZ) each opposing two, and Lisa Murkowski (AK), Ben Sasse (NE), and Cory Gardner (CO) each opposing one. \n\nUltimately, while there were multiple instances of Democrats voting \"yes\" on Trump's picks, there were also several instances of Republicans voting \"no.\" Unlike the Democrats of 2021, the Republicans of 2017 were willing to buck their party leader/president. \n\nIt's eight years later — and in some ways, a whole different world. One suspects there will be fewer instances of Republicans voting against Trump's nominees this time around. Will Democrats follow suit? Or prove even more resistant to the Trump picks this time around? My instinct is that we'll see more party-line (or close to it) votes. The saving grace for Trump (and his nominees) is that the Republicans have a 53-47 advantage this time. And John Fetterman (D-PA) has signaled an inclination to step into the role of the recently retired Joe Manchin (I-WV), so may provide an added cushion.","url":"https://redstate.com/smoosieq/2025/01/05/on-senate-confirmation-votes-n2183970","image":"https://media.townhall.com/cdn/hodl/2024/318/af652c90-77d0-4de1-85f2-e936823c8f08.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-01-05 23:48:12","author":"Susie Moore","authors":["Susie Moore"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.122},{"id":278526704,"title":"Blinken Seeks Stability In Crisis-hit Ally South Korea","text":"US Secretary of State Antony Blinken holds talks Monday in crisis-riven South Korea, seeking to encourage policy stability in the US ally, including in its complicated relationship with Japan. Blinken, starting what will likely be his last trip as the top US diplomat, will be meeting his counterpart on the day an arrest warrant for impeached President Yoon Suk Yeol expires.Raucous protests were audible even before dawn from Blinken's hilltop hotel as crowds rallied in the snowy capital either in support or against the conservative president.Yoon, until recently a darling of President Joe Biden's administration for his pro-US policies on the international stage, stunned South Korea by briefly imposing martial law on December 3.Yoon quickly backed down faced with street protests and quick action by the opposition-dominated parliament, but the crisis was far from over with lawmakers also impeaching his acting successor.Investigators seeking to arrest Yoon failed on Friday after a six-hour standoff with his security service.Blinken is not scheduled to meet Yoon and will hold a joint news conference with Foreign Minister Cho Tae-yul, who is not under threat of impeachment.Blinken is expected to steer clear of taking partisan sides in the deeply divided country but instead will focus on policy continuity.Yoon delighted the United States by seeking to turn the page on decades of friction with Japan, a fellow US ally that is also home to thousands of US troops.Yoon in 2023 joined Biden and Japan's then prime minister Fumio Kishida for a landmark three-way summit that included a promise to step up intelligence cooperation on the key challenge of North Korea.South Korea's progressive opposition, which has made Yoon's life miserable from parliament and is increasingly ascendant since the president's power grab, historically has taken a harder line on Japan over the legacy of its brutal 1910-1945 colonial rule of the Korean peninsula.Opposition leader Lee Jae-myung -- who himself faces election disqualification in a court case -- also favours more diplomatic outreach with North Korea than the hawkish Yoon.Before the crisis, South Korea had been looking at providing weapons to Ukraine, breaking an earlier taboo in response to North Korea sending troops to fight alongside Russia in its invasion. The turmoil and lack of a clear leader in Asia's fourth-largest economy comes just as the United States is in the midst of its own political transition.While Biden has focused on nurturing US alliances, President-elect Donald Trump, who takes over on January 20, has been dismissive of what he sees as unfair commitments by the United States.Trump during his latest presidential run said that if he were in power he would have strong-armed South Korea into paying $10 billion a year for the US troop presence, nearly 10 times what it contributes now.But paradoxically, Trump forged a bond with the last progressive South Korean president, Moon Jae-in, who encouraged his attempts at deal-making with North Korea.Trump, who once threatened \"fire and fury\" against North Korea, went on to meet three times with strongman Kim Jong Un and said they \"fell in love\".Trump's unusually personal diplomacy managed to lower tensions on the Korean peninsula but brought no lasting deal to end Pyongyang's nuclear programme.Blinken will head later Monday to Japan and then to France as he bids farewell by focusing on US alliances.","summary":"US Secretary of State Antony Blinken holds talks Monday in crisis-riven South Korea, seeking to encourage policy stability in the US ally, including in its complicated relationship with Japan.","url":"https://www.ibtimes.com/blinken-seeks-stability-crisis-hit-ally-south-korea-3757928","image":"https://d.ibtimes.com/en/full/4573157/us-secretary-state-antony-blinken-making-what-will-likely-his-last-trip-top-us-diplomat.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-01-05 23:45:15","author":"Shaun Tandon","authors":["Shaun Tandon"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.069},{"id":278524556,"title":"Cicero, the Founders, and Modern America’s Lack of Gratitude","text":"It is true that America is waking up — Donald Trump and the Republicans carried the 2024 election, and, in Trump’s case, it wasn’t even close. Even demographics that are usually heavily Democrat such as young people, black Americans, and Hispanics swung toward Trump. That said, American society has a lot of moral and political examination, reform, and renewal to do, and, like our own Founding Fathers, we could not do better than learn from one of the greatest philosophers of history: Marcus Tullius Cicero.\n\nCicero was born in January of 106 BC, but though he was separated from the Founders by religion, nationality, time, and many other things, the great natural law-inspired principles he espoused — among them the natural equality of man, the value of freedom, and the excellence of republicanism — resonated as much with 18th century Americans as with Cicero’s admirers in pre-Christian Rome. \n\n‘Gratitude is not only the greatest of virtues, but the parent of all the others.’ —Marcus Tullius Cicero pic.twitter.com/zRMIi6pgty— Catherine Salgado (@CatSalgado32) January 5, 2025\n\n“Gratitude is not only the greatest of virtues, but the parent of all the others,” wrote Cicero. In our society now, we see many illustrations of what happens when his maxim is not applied. Ever since the Boomers were young, since the sexual revolution, Americans have glorified selfishness and treated self-esteem as the greatest of virtues. Gratitude has been abandoned in favor of unmitigated arrogance and self-indulgence. Young people for multiple generations have been encouraged to indulge in sexual licentiousness, and so America suffers from divorced couples, broken families, out-of-wedlock births, sexual perverts, etc. Kids are encouraged to believe their actions are fabulous and praiseworthy no matter the quality of their work, and so employers can’t find good, steady employees. Teenagers who march in support of Hamas or transgenders or baby killers (abortionists) or who vilify everyone who has made their lives prosperous and free believe they are brave, virtuous heroes even though they support evil and are cowards or abusers or jack*sses in their personal lives. \n\nThere is no gratitude here, no humility (for gratitude and humility go hand-in-hand). How many of us regularly count our blessings? How many of us are grateful for living in the greatest nation in the world? For with all its faults and failings and periods of authoritarianism, it is still much better to live here in the U.S. than in genocidal Nigeria or tyrannical China or jihadi Iran.\n\nRelated: J.R.R. Tolkien and Fighting the Battle of Our Times\n\nThe pro-Hamas activists are the more extreme examples of this mentality of ingratitude, of the hatred of this country and all the people who have funded and facilitated their lifestyle. Incredibly corrupt politicians like Kamala Harris and Joe Biden are praised by media as good because they express what wokies consider the “correct opinions.” Yet the view that words are in themselves virtuous, that goodness is a mere show or sham, that gratitude and an awareness of others are unnecessary, has invaded even the right. Elon Musk is raved about as an unparalleled champion of free speech even as he makes deals with the censorship-obsessed CCP and as his X platform continually censors Americans. I can hardly attend a church liturgy anymore that isn’t rendered complete chaos by a mob of children racing about screaming at top volume and smashing things while their young parents watch in placid disinterest. \n\nIf Putin or Robert E. Lee or some other war criminal is called bad by an equally wicked Western leftist, there will always be a horde of conservatives immediately praising the criticized criminal as the most noble of heroes, completely regardless of that person’s actual deeds. That is no way to have a society; to be free, we must be rational. We must also be grateful. Even many conservatives know next to nothing about the lives and achievements of great heroes in American history. We have been given great gifts of freedom and equality in America, and it not enough that we say we value these goods; we must work to safeguard and expand them or our vaunted gratitude is empty.\n\nAs I noted above, the Founding Fathers were great admirers of Cicero. From Washington to Hamilton to Adams, the Founders saw themselves as the New Rome, in the tradition of the Roman Republic (hence we are a republic rather than a democracy), only better in being Judeo-Christian and eschewing aristocracy altogether, among other points. They would advise us to listen well to Cicero’s advice on gratitude and apply it to our lives. John Adams declared, “as all the ages of the world have not produced a greater statesman and philosopher united in the same character [than Cicero], his authority should have great weight.” Thomas Jefferson dubbed Cicero “the father of eloquence and philosophy.” And Adams’ son John Quincy Adams imbibed his father’s enthusiasm, stating that “to live without having a Cicero and a Tacitus at hand seems to me as if it was a privation of one of my limbs.” Meanwhile, Alexander Hamilton adopted the pen name “Tully,” in tribute to Marcus Tullius Cicero.\n\nNo one thinker in history has ever been right on every single point, especially a pagan.

Stock prices remained in the doldrums for the first five months of the year, but after the National Democratic Alliance secured a majority in the Lok Sabha election in May, the markets shot up dramatically.The Nifty touched its all-time high of 26,277 in September, though profit booking and FII (foreign institutional investor) selling pulled down the index in October. FIIs have sold equities worth almost ₹1.7 lakh crore in the past three months. Even as FIIs were selling, retail investors were busy diversifying their portfolios beyond traditional assets. SIPs (systematic investment plans) in mutual funds crossed the ₹25,000 crore monthly contribution mark in October.It was a mega year for other segments of the financial markets as well. There was a surge in the primary market, with 317 IPOs raising a record ₹1.8 lakh crore during the year. Landmark listings, such as the ₹27,800 crore Hyundai Motor India, underscored the dynamism of the market. medium116964507 medium116964521 medium116964530 medium116964536 medium116964543What does 2025 have in store? Experts are advising equity investors to be cautious because corporate earnings growth is likely to decelerate. They are also advising investors to focus on the large-cap segment and lighten positions in the mid- and small-cap space.The 10 smart money moves listed below can help safeguard your finances and grow your wealth in the New Year.1. Be conservative in equity investmentsDomestic equities posted gains for the ninth consecutive year in 2024. However, earnings growth, which has been robust over the past three years, is now moderating. GDP growth has also softened. There is no let-up in geopolitical conflicts and tariff wars could be in the offing. The recent correction has removed some of the excesses in certain pockets, but markets are still trading at higher valuations compared to historical averages.With multiple headwinds on the horizon, a cautious stance is warranted. Experts suggest investors should moderate return expectations in the coming year. Focus on diversifying risk and maintaining prudent asset allocation. Diversifying the portfolio across multiple asset classes like equities, bonds and gold should help tide over the expected higher volatility.Sankaran Naren, executive director & CIO, ICICI Prudential AMC, asserts, “In this dynamic environment, spreading one’s investments across different asset classes is an effective way to capitalise on the unique opportunities each offers.”Hybrid strategies, including multi-asset allocation funds and dynamic asset allocation funds, are best suited for this environment, say experts.Nippon India AMC suggests investors seeking downside protection may consider asset allocation products such as multi-asset funds and dynamic equity schemes.Within equities, experts suggest that investors bet on pockets of resilience and shun adventurism. Somnath Mukherjee, CIO & senior managing partner, ASK Private Wealth, insists, “2025 is a year of recalibration, where precision in investment strategy is crucial. Investors should focus on quality and growth factors, which have historically demonstrated resilience in challenging conditions.”Bajaj Broking outlines in its report, “The ‘buy on dips’ strategy has been effective in the Indian market in recent years, and we recommend continuing this approach by selectively accumulating quality stocks.”Further, experts maintain that large-caps continue to offer a better risk-reward proposition. “The latest correction in the Indian markets has cooled off valuations in large-caps, even as mid- and small-caps continue to trade at premium to their historical averages. In the near term, we suggest maintaining an overweight position in large-cap stocks, while selectively allocating to mid- and small-caps,” Motilal Oswal Wealth Management observes in its note.Some suggest a conservative approach to large-cap investing may be warranted in the coming months. The past few years have seen a significant shift in market dynamics. The share of top 50 or top 10 stocks relative to the total market capitalisation is hovering near all-time lows. This presents a rare opportunity for investors, says Sahil Kapoor, head of products and market strategist, DSP Mutual Fund. “A conservative approach to large-cap investing could provide a strategic advantage,” he says.At the same time, investors should not ignore mid- and small-caps altogether. After the recent correction, certain pockets in these segments appear attractive. Among small-cap stocks (stocks ranked 251-500 by market cap), 56% have declined by more than 20% from their 52-week highs. Similarly, 47% of mid-cap stocks are down by over 20% from their 52-week highs.Nippon India AMC suggests that long-term investors with appropriate risk appetite consider investing in mid- and small-caps in a staggered manner through SIPs. medium116964357 medium1169643592. Stay away from option trading and cryptosFor risk-lovers who have enjoyed a good run in the rising markets, it may be time to temper greed and exercise caution. As rising volatility in the domestic markets and surging global uncertainties are likely to continue in 2025, risky instruments are set to become exponentially riskier.“There is uncertainty in the economic environment in terms of the GDP, inflation and interest rates. The markets are going to be volatile due to all of these,” says Dinesh Rohira, founder & CEO, 5nance.com.Agrees Abhijit Bhave, MD & CEO, Equirus Wealth. “Risky investments, which are already unpredictable, could become even more volatile. While F&O trading can multiply your gains, it can also multiply your losses, wiping out years of savings in moments,” he says.Given that the top 3.5% of individual F&O traders lost ₹28 lakh per person between 2020-21 and 2023-24, it’s a dire warning. More so because 75% of the lossmakers persisted with the trading despite losses in preceding two years, as per a Sebi study.“Though the government is taking steps to improve controls in F&O, it’s best to focus on steady, proven investments like SIPs in mutual funds and beaten down blue-chip stocks,” says Bhave.“Some of the risky asset classes like small-caps have done reasonably well in the past year compared to the Nifty, but market volatility doesn’t augur well for them and there is a strong possibility that small-caps may go into the negative terrain in the next year,” says Rohira.Similarly, the fluctuation and volatility in cryptos since November has been decidedly higher. Bitcoin has topped $107,000 and has risen 50% since the US election. Given the new US government policies and global war situation, this volatility may spike. “It’s best to focus on capital preservation rather than making sizeable gains in risker assets like these,” says Rohira. medium116964372 medium1169643763. Stick to short-term funds to avoid shocksThe interest rate cuts that many had anticipated did not come through in 2024. Even as the US Federal Reserve has started its own rate-cutting cycle, the RBI remains circumspect about taking this path. Over the year, the RBI has changed its stance from ‘withdrawal of accommodation’ to ‘neutral’. However, it has kept the policy rate unchanged, choosing to wait for more clarity on the evolving inflation scenario.The rate cuts are now expected to start in the first half of 2025, but the picture remains muddied. The Fed has already poured cold water on the bond market’s previous calculations. In its latest monetary review, the Fed indicated that it would ‘be more cautious’ while considering more easing. The extent and timing of the cuts would depend on data, it suggested. It has revised its own projections, with only two cuts now forecast in 2025, half of what was expected in September. The year 2026 is also likely to see just two cuts (versus four earlier). A ‘higher for longer’ scenario is a distinct possibility now, with uncertainty over incoming US President Donald Trump’s policy actions.This is likely to cast a shadow on emerging markets, including India. Suresh Darak, founder, Bondbazaar, remarks, “This move by the Fed is expected to keep other countries’ central bankers wary of cutting rates materially, apart from exerting pressure on their currencies.”Besides, the Indian economy is facing a challenging scenario of stagflation. Experts are now convinced that the extent of the rate-cutting cycle in India could be modest. Franklin Templeton India AMC suggests in a note, “We expect a shallow rate cycle domestically, and it could only begin sometime in the next calendar year.”This makes investing in long-tenure bonds a tricky proposition. Already, the yield on the benchmark 10-year government bond has eased from 7.35% in October 2023 to 6.75% in December 2024. Given the elevated uncertainty and high possibility of interest rate shocks, experts warn against adding duration in the portfolio.“With the evolving interest rate scenario, the fixed-income portfolio should be overweight on accrual strategies and neutral on duration strategies,” suggests Motilal Oswal Private Wealth.For investors, this means retaining the bulk of the portfolio in low-duration or short-term debt funds or bonds for now. If bond yields spike due to any unforeseen development, investors can switch partially to duration strategies such as gilt funds or long-duration funds. medium1169643814. Invest in pharma stocks and fundsAnalysts are favouring defensive sectors at a time when the equity markets are clouded by uncertainties. Pharma tops the list of defensive sectors.The key growth drivers of Indian pharma companies in the future include rising healthcare spending, an ageing population, supportive government policies, growth in R&D spending, and benefits to CDMO (contract development and manufacturing organisation) companies from the anticipated US Biosecure Act (which aims to put restrictions on China-based biotech companies involved in US government-funded research). In addition, a weaker rupee will also benefit many Indian pharma companies, which earn sizeable revenues from exports.Government policies such as PLI, bulk drug parks and Promotion of Research & Innovation (PRIP) will aid long-term growth, according to a recent Centrum Broking report. While the bulk drug parks will reduce the manufacturing cost of bulk drugs, the PLI scheme will enhance India’s manufacturing capabilities.Segment-wise, sustained growth momentum in chronic therapies, stable pricing and in-licensing opportunities are supporting the domestic formulations segment. On the other hand, the US generics segment is doing well amid a better segmental mix, niche launches and weakening intensity of price erosion in the base portfolio.Looking at the hospital space, the considerable demand-supply gap, growth in medical tourism, increase in payor mix, led by growing insurance penetration and bed expansion by private players, are some of the factors that support performance in the future. Further, traction in high-growth therapies like cardiac and cancer care will boost ARPOB and occupancy.Apart from direct equities, investors can also gain exposure to the sector through pharma funds. Such funds offer a better alternative as investing through the mutual fund route provides diversification. medium1169643985. Harvest tax-free capital gainsThe 2024-25 Budget increased the long-term capital gains (LTCG) tax rate from 10% to 12.5%, but also increased the annual tax exemption limit on LTCG from ₹1 lakh to ₹1.25 lakh. These changes mean investors should pay more attention to optimising their tax outgo and harvest tax-free gains.Tax experts say this should be done every year to reduce the tax outgo in later years. If you hold investments for several years without booking gains, the accumulated profit could push you into a higher taxable slab, leading to a larger tax outgo. If you strategically harvest tax-free gains each year, you can reduce the tax liability to a certain extent. By selling investments and booking profits up to ₹1.25 lakh annually, you can enjoy tax-free gains, maximising the benefit of the enhanced exemption limit.“Any unutilised exemption in a financial year is effectively lost,” says chartered accountant Karan Batra.Regularly harvesting gains not only resets your cost to the current market value, but also reduces the portfolio risk. Reviewing and rebalancing the portfolio involves selling outperforming assets, which restores the desired asset allocation and reduces the overall risk in the portfolio. Experts advise that investors should review and rebalance their investment portfolios at least once in a year or after any big up or down movement in asset prices.If you have incurred losses, it is time to book them as well. Sell your loss-making investments and buy them back the next day. The losses so booked will be adjusted against gains from other investments. Keep the first-in, first-out rule in mind and an eye on the calender when you do this. Short-term gains from stocks and equity funds are now taxed at 20%, while gains from other funds are taxed at the slab rate.6. Buy personal cyber security insuranceCyber scams have increased 300% in the past year, with ₹11,333 crore lost in the first nine months of 2024 alone.“Indians spend an average of 194 minutes daily on social media, with teenagers spending 3-6 hours. Besides cybercrimes like phishing and identity theft faced by individuals, cyber threats also include hacktivists, terrorist groups and amateur hackers (script kiddies),” says Najm Bilgrami, senior vice-president, financial lines, TATA AIG General Insurance.In the past year, scammers posing as officials from banks or government agencies have exploited fear and urgency to extract Aadhaar details, OTPs, or credit card information. Social media posts and geotagged photos aid them in collecting personal data.While personal vigilance is critical in avoiding such scams, buying cyber insurance in the coming year could enhance the digital security net.“Cyber security insurance safeguards an individual against financial losses and legal liabilities arising from online fraud, unauthorised transactions or data breaches,” says S Brahmajosyula, chief product & marketing officer, SBI General Insurance.“While the ideal cover depends on an individual’s risk profile and extent of digital activities, one should also assess the potential costs of recovering from a cyber incident, including data recovery, legal liabilities and reputational damage,” says Bilgrami.Personal cyber security covers typically range from ₹10,000 to ₹1 crore for individuals and families, and cover a range of risks, including identity theft, theft of funds, cyber stalking, bullying, etc.Besides insurance, personal preventive measures are crucial. “Since many scams originate from abroad, prevention remains the best defence. Stay informed, exercise caution and remain one step ahead of cybercriminals,” says Prashant Mali, president and founder, Cyber Law Consulting.“Use strong, unique passwords, keep devices and software updated, place transaction limits and verify all communications before sharing sensitive details,” recommends Venugopal Parameswara, chief information security officer of CSB Bank. medium116964443 medium1169644567. Maintain allocation to gold and silverGold shot up 18.5% in 2024, driven by sustained central bank buying across the world, rising geopolitical tensions, and the initiation of a global rate-cutting cycle. Additionally, the rupee depreciated from around ₹83 to a dollar at the beginning of 2024, to above ₹85, amplifying returns for domestic investors.Experts believe the continued central bank demand will support gold prices in 2025 as well. “If volatility in risk assets like equities and inflationary pressures persist in 2025, gold’s status as a safe-haven asset positions it favourably for steady performance relative to other asset classes,” says Vikram Dhawan, head of commodities and fund manager at Nippon India AMC.However, the pace is likely to moderate, warns Naveen Mathur, director, commodities & currencies at Anand Rathi Wealth. He says the dollar’s strength in the first half of 2025 could partially offset the gains for gold.Analysts at Motilal Oswal Financial Services estimate that gold could reach ₹86,000 levels over the next two years and recommend a ‘buy on dips’ strategy. They suggest investors use periods of volatility as opportunities to build a diversified portfolio, with gold as a key component.Mathur further highlights ETFs as the best gold investment option, given their favourable tax treatment, high liquidity, and ease of trading in smaller denominations. medium1169644778. Opt for NPS benefit by employerTax benefits for the NPS have progressively increased in the past few years, each change making the pension scheme more advantageous for investors. The 2024-25 Budget has enhanced the tax deduction for those opting for the new tax regime. Under Section 80CCD(2), up to 10% of the basic pay put in NPS is tax-free. This has been increased to 14% of the basic pay under the new tax regime.This makes the NPS a compelling investment. A person with a basic salary of ₹1 lakh can potentially save ₹52,000 in tax by opting for the NPS benefit. High income earners with large investible surpluses will find it especially beneficial. If your company offers you the NPS benefit, you should certainly opt for it.Apart from saving tax and building a retirement corpus, the NPS can also be used for short-term goals. With fund management charges ranging from 0.03% to 0.09% per year, the pension scheme is ultra-cheap compared to the charges of mutual funds and insurance companies. The ultra-low charges of the NPS translate into higher returns for investors. NPS debt funds have done better than debt mutual funds.Use the NPS Tier II to save for short-term goals. There are no tax benefits on contributions to NPS Tier II, but there are also no restrictions on withdrawals. You can invest today and withdraw the money the next day. There is also no exit charge.Please note that investing in NPS Tier II works well for gilt and corporate bond funds, but not so much for equity funds because of ambiguity in the tax rules.“With no specific mention of how they will be taxed, the gains from NPS Tier II will be treated as income from other sources and taxed at the slab rate,” says Nishant Khemani, managing partner, Saturn Consulting Group.So, gains from NPS Tier II funds will not get the tax exemption that gains from stocks and equity funds enjoy.9. Keep pace with emerging technologyWith technology changing on a daily basis, it is going to define careers across the board in the coming year. “Even 3-5 years ago, we couldn’t have known about the jobs being created today. By 2030, 70-80% of jobs would be the ones that don’t exist today. Everyone will need to upskill themselves in emerging technology irrespective of their roles and sectors,” says Neeti Sharma, CEO, Teamlease Digital.Agrees Devashish Chakravarty, founder, Salarynext.com, and author of Get Hired in 30 Days. “Since the context of workplace is changing so fast in terms of AI, technology and cost-cutting, employees will have to stop measuring their worth in terms of years of experience, but in their ability to deliver value,” he says.The good news is that India’s job market is poised for a 9% growth in 2025, according to the foundit Insights Tracker. The growth and industry expansion will be led by IT, retail, telecommunications and BFSI sectors. “IT and data will continue to grow and attract higher salaries, especially with GCCs (global capability centres) coming to India, but you will need to treat AI like a tool in all sectors and roles,” says Chakravarty. Agrees Sharma: “IT is no longer computer science. It is being increasingly used in healthcare, life sciences, auto engineering and semiconductors.”To stay relevant and ensure career progression in 2025, here’s what you will need to keep in mind.Upskill in emerging tech: AI is no longer a tech product, but a consumer product, says Sharma. It is used in every sector to improve productivity and efficiency. So, make sure to upgrade your digital tech skills via online courses.Upgrade continuously: With tech shelf-life shrinking, you can no longer rely on just one professional degree all your life. Know that you will need to acquire new skills, adapt to new technology and AI on a continuous basis.Improve soft skills: “Since skill domains will keep changing, more and more employers are looking for behavioural and cultural fitment,” says Sharma. These attributes include adaptability, attitude, communication and willingness to learn. So, work on improving your softer skills as much as upgrading on emerging tech. medium11696448410. Rethink your kids’ foreign education“In 2024, around 13 lakh students went overseas for higher education, draining about $6bn from India’s foreign exchange reserves,” lamented Vice-President Jagdeep Dhankhar recently. Many Indian parents don’t quite share his sentiment. In a fad that has been raging for a few years now, students have made a beeline for undergrad and postgrad courses abroad, with the number going up from 6.75 lakh in 2019 to 13.35 lakh in 2024. While most travel to the US, UK, Australia and Canada, cheaper European and Asian destinations have also found favour.Yet, in the past year or so, geopolitical uncertainties, falling job options, surging living expenses and tightening visa regulations have begun to demand a rethink.“There is a dearth of jobs and the geopolitical-economic situation is changing every day. So, you need to be very selective and conduct thorough research about which course, university and country you want to go to. You should have a road map for the next 10 years on the return on your investment,” says Alok Bansal, premium consultant, Study Abroad.For instance, if you study digital marketing from the UK, you won’t get a job. The best return on investment is currently from the US, he adds.“However, Trump’s America-first policy will probably bring down migrant jobs. The American dream is obviously dying and parents need to be very clear that the kids may or may not get a job,” says Sharma of Teamlease Digital.The UK, Australia and Canada, meanwhile, have started to cap the number of foreign students, increase visa fees and proof of funds requirement, and reduce post-study work visa period. Even in cheaper European destinations like Ireland, Netherlands and Germany, jobs are becoming scarce while living expenses are surging.Chakravarty of Salarynext.com cuts to the chase. “Education is the easiest route to migrate abroad and, in a downturn like this, the real reason for sending kids overseas gets exposed. If, however, getting a job is the only goal, you can save money by studying in India and can always apply for overseas jobs later on,” he says.So, if you were set on sending your child for higher education with the aim of finding a job, either conduct extensive research about the course and the country that is likely to ensure this, or hold the plans for the near future. Don’t send the child abroad just because everyone else is doing it. medium116964492","url":"https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/toi-plus/wealth/here-are-10-ways-to-protect-your-wealth-and-grow-richer-in-2025/articleshow/116964077.cms","image":"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/resizemode-4,width-1280,height-720,msid-116964260/116964260.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-01-05 23:42:12","author":"Team Et Wealth","authors":["Team Et Wealth"],"language":"en","source_country":"in","sentiment":0.079},{"id":278524330,"title":"Meloni makes a surprise visit to Florida to meet Trump, boost ties","text":"WEST PALM BEACH/ROME: Italian PM Giorgia Meloni made a surprise trip to Florida to meet with Donald Trump late on Saturday, as the key European leader sought to strengthen ties with the president-elect before his inauguration on Jan 20.No details of the talks were released, but Italian deputy PM Matteo Salvini said on Sunday they covered a range of issues including the plight of Cecilia Sala, an Italian journalist detained last month in Iran. \"Well done Giorgia Meloni for visiting Donald Trump to talk about peace, industrial and commercial cooperation, security, and the freeing of Cecilia Sala,\" Salvini posted on X.Members of Trump's Mar-a-Lago resort welcomed Meloni with applause. \"This is very exciting.

Kathy Hochul refuses to even contemplate a huge potential boon to the state’s economy: lifting the ban on fracking.\n\nInstead, last month she extended New York’s hydraulic-fracturing ban by prohibiting a new technique to use carbon dioxide to extract natural gas harmlessly.\n\nThis, when fracking is used across the country with no sign of the harms cited by its critics; the ban rests on nothing but pseudo-science and green bigotry against any and all fossil fuels — even though the technique and the abundant natural-gas drilling it has allowed is responsible for the US energy revolution of the last two decades and most of the nation’s progress in reducing carbon emissions. \n\nIt’s in wide use right next door in Pennsylvania, and a key reason why electric bills there run about half what they do here; it’s brought billions in economic benefits to the Keystone State.\n\n “If New York were able to produce just half the natural gas Pennsylvania does,” notes energy expert Jonathan Lesser, it could create “upwards of 50,000 direct jobs” and “many more indirect ones.” The resulting “tax bonanza” would bring Albany several hundred million dollars a year, “plus over $100 million annually in impact fees for local communities.”\n\nAnd the Empire State might be able to harvest more gas than its neighbor: New York’s natural-gas reserves in the Marcellus and Utica Shale regions could be worth $1 trillion.\n\nBut ideologues used fearmongering and deceit to ban it starting in 2008, with then-Gov. Andrew Cuomo cynically signing the idiocy into law in 2014.\n\nCuomo, Hochul and state Democrats have instead inflicted New York with the wildly expensive and impractical “Climate Leadership and Community Protection Act,” which pretends wind and solar can provide most of the state’s power needs. \n\nThis crusade slams quality of life across the state, outlawing new gas hook-ups for homes and businesses and pushing up power prices even as it makes future blackouts a near-certainty. \n\nAnd Hochul late last month tripled down on the nonsense by signing the so-called “Polluters Pay” Act, which aims to raise $75 billion with new charges on energy producers — costs that will inevitably be passed on to energy consumers, namely every man, woman and child in the state. \n\nNew York will fall even further behind the saner parts of the county as natural-gas production skyrockets after President-elect Donald Trump takes office.\n\nIs it any wonder that United Van Lines ranks New York third on its annual list of the “Most Moved From States” in 2024?\n\nThe state won’t stop losing ground ’til it reverses course, and allowing fracking is the simplest first step: It won’t cost Albany a dime, but instead provide a windfall that could easily replace the MTA’s “congestion pricing” toll income and allow cutting many other taxes. \n\nYes, lifting the ban likely requires a huge political fight, but no Albany battle is more worth waging.\n\nIf New York is ever to rise from its economic doldrums and enter a new era of prosperity and affordability, it must face reality and join the rest of America in embracing fracking.","summary":"For all her talk of wanting to make New York more affordable and livable, Gov.

According to Reuters, neighbours reported hearing a massive explosion at around 2 am and found the house reduced to rubble, with many women and children among the victims. Medics continued searching for survivors, but several children were confirmed dead. Another airstrike on a Gaza City home later killed five more people, with at least 10 others feared trapped under the debris.

US President-elect Donald Trump’s administration, along with Qatar and Egypt, is working to bring an end to the 15-month-long war and secure the release of Israeli hostages. Meanwhile, Israeli officials have vowed to continue efforts to bring all hostages back, warning those who harm them will be held fully accountable. The ongoing conflict, which began after Hamas attacked Israel on October 7, 2023, has resulted in over 45,000 Palestinian deaths, according to Gaza's health ministry.","url":"https://www.dnaindia.com/world/report-israeli-airstrikes-in-gaza-kill-at-least-70-as-new-ceasefire-talks-begin-3125604","image":"https://cdn.dnaindia.com/sites/default/files/styles/half/public/2025/01/05/2670133-image-2025-01-05t112316.315.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-01-05 23:36:13","author":"Shivam Verma","authors":["Shivam Verma"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"in","sentiment":-0.445},{"id":278523298,"title":"'I'm here with a fantastic woman': Donald Trump meets Italian PM Giorgia Meloni in Florida amid global","text":"Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni traveled to Florida on Saturday to meet with U.S. President-elect Donald Trump, aiming to strengthen ties with him ahead of his inauguration on January 20. Meloni, a key European leader, received a warm welcome at Trump’s Mar-a-Lago resort, where members applauded her after Trump introduced her, as seen in videos shared on social media. This visit comes just days before Meloni is scheduled to host current U.S. President Joe Biden in Rome between January 11 and 12. Trump defeated Biden in the November election and is preparing to return to the White House. The meeting between Trump and Meloni reportedly included discussions on major global issues such as Russia's war in Ukraine, trade relations, the Middle East, and the case of Cecilia Sala, an Italian journalist detained in Iran. However, Meloni’s office did not confirm these reports. Meloni is viewed as a strong potential ally for Trump due to her conservative policies and the stability of the right-wing coalition she leads in Italy. She also has a close connection with billionaire tech CEO Elon Musk, who supported Trump’s election campaign financially. Trump expressed admiration for Meloni, calling her a “fantastic woman” and noting her impact on European politics. During the visit, the two leaders watched a documentary about John Eastman, Trump’s former lawyer, who faced legal scrutiny for his role in trying to overturn the 2020 U.S. election results. Meloni also faces a significant challenge in the case of Cecilia Sala, who was detained in Iran on December 19. Sala’s arrest came after an Iranian businessman, Mohammad Abedini, was detained in Italy on U.S. charges of allegedly supplying drone parts linked to a deadly attack on U.S. service members in Jordan. Iran denies involvement in the attack and has summoned Italy’s ambassador in response to Abedini’s detention. Meloni’s visit follows similar trips by other global leaders, including Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, and Argentinian President Javier Milei, to meet Trump since his election victory.","url":"https://www.dnaindia.com/world/report-i-m-here-with-a-fantastic-woman-donald-trump-meets-italian-pm-giorgia-meloni-in-florida-amid-global-challenges-and-3125656","image":"https://cdn.dnaindia.com/sites/default/files/styles/half/public/2025/01/05/2670186-image-2025-01-05t171930.626.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-01-05 23:36:13","author":"Pravrajya Suruchi","authors":["Pravrajya Suruchi"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"in","sentiment":0.032},{"id":278523294,"title":"Ryan Routh, Trump's alleged shooter, wishes to become Hamas hostage in SHOCKING letter: 'Will you go with me","text":"Ryan Routh, who is accused of attempting to assassinate US President-elect Donald Trump, has made unexpected claims in a jailhouse letter obtained by the New York Post.

Deep-seated conflicts such as economic inequality, racial conflicts, and culture wars are becoming more acute, and social trends are becoming more conservative,\" she said.\n\n\"Diplomatically, the new Trump administration will put more emphasis on 'America first' and be more unilateral and economically nationalistic ... which may push Sino-U.S. relations into a new high-risk period.\"\n\nDespite anticipating bumpy ties ahead, Shen said China would take a long-term view of bilateral relations, improving its own strength while \"adhering to win-win cooperation\" with the U.S., rather than playing zero-sum games and taking a lead role in global governance.\n\nFollowing Trump's election victory last month, Chinese scholars and officials were generally pessimistic about the future of Sino-American ties despite stabilization earlier this year.\n\nChina's top diplomat Wang Yi last week called on the incoming Trump administration to \"make the right choice and work with China in the same direction to avoid disruptions\" amid what he described as \"a world of turbulence and conflicts.\"\n\nChinese President Xi Jinping also delivered a message for Trump during a meeting with Biden in Lima, Peru last month, just days after the U.S. presidential election.\n\n\"China is ready to engage in dialogue, expand cooperation, and manage differences with the U.S. to sustain the hard-won momentum towards stability\" in bilateral ties, Xi said.\n\nPang Zhongying, chair professor in international political economy at Sichuan University in Chengdu, said an inadequate understanding of American politics may hamper Beijing's efforts to seek better ties with the Trump administration.\n\n\"It is unfortunate but true that most of us do not understand American politics well enough to grasp Trump's rise and his return,\" he said.\n\nAlthough Beijing has had some experience dealing with the first Trump administration and has closely followed his return to power, it remained unclear if this would put China in a better position to cope with the imminent challenges, he said.\n\nRead the full storyat SCMP.","url":"https://www.nation.lk/online/why-trump-2-0-could-push-china-us-relations-into-high-risk-territory-290404.html","image":"https://img.koreatimes.co.kr/upload/thumbnailV2/5b749182e3eb4726b50db3435eaa0022.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-01-05 23:33:12","author":null,"language":"en","source_country":"lk","sentiment":-0.066},{"id":278522824,"title":"1st Korean American senator stresses commitment to being 'bridge' between S.

Creators are left in limbo","text":"Will TikTok be banned this month? \n\nThat’s the pressing question keeping creators and small business owners in anxious limbo as they await a decision that could upend their livelihoods. The fate of the popular app will be decided by the Supreme Court, which will hear arguments on Jan. 10 over a law requiring TikTok to break ties with its Chinese-based parent company, ByteDance, or face a U.S. ban. \n\nAt the heart of the case is whether the law violates the First Amendment with TikTok and its creator allies arguing that it does. The U.S. government, which sees the platform as a national security risk, says it does not. \n\nFor creators, the TikTok doomsday scenarios are nothing new since President-elect Donald Trump first tried to ban the platform through executive order during his first term. But despite Trump's recent statements indicating he now wants TikTok to stick around, the prospect of a ban has never been as immediate as it is now with the Supreme Court serving as the final arbiter.\n\nIf the government prevails as it did in a lower court, TikTok says it would shut down its U.S. platform by Jan. 19, leaving creators scrambling to redefine their futures. \n\n“A lot of my other creative friends, we're all like freaking out. But I'm staying calm,” said Gillian Johnson, who benefited financially from TikTok’s live feature and rewards program, which helped creators generate higher revenue potential by posting high-quality original content. The 22-year-old filmmaker and recent college graduate uses her TikTok earnings to help fund her equipment for projects such as camera lens and editing software for her short films “Gambit” and “Awaken! My Neighbor.”\n\nJohnson said the idea of TikTok going away is “hard to accept.” \n\nMany creators have taken to TikTok to voice their frustrations, grappling with the possibility that the platform they’ve invested so much in could soon disappear. Online communities risk being disrupted, and the economic fallout could especially be devastating for those who mainly depend on TikTok and have left full-time jobs to build careers and incomes around their content. \n\nFor some, the uncertainty has led them to question whether to continue creating content at all, according to Johnson, who says she knows creators who have been thinking about quitting. But Nicla Bartoli, the vice president of sales at The Influencer Marketing Factory, said the creators she has interreacted with have not been too worried since news about a potential TikTok ban has come up repeatedly over the years, and then died down. \n\n“I believe a good chunk think it is not going to happen,\" said Bartoli, whose agency works to pair influencers and brands. \n\nIt's unclear how quickly the Supreme Court will issue a decision. But the court could act swiftly to block the law from going into effect if at least five of the nine justices deem it unconstitutional. \n\nTrump, for his part, has already asked the justices to put a pause on the ban so he could weigh in after he takes office. In a brief — written by his pick for solicitor general — Trump called the First Amendment implications of a TikTok ban “sweeping and troubling\" and said he wants a “negotiated resolution” to the issue, something the Biden administration had pursued to no avail. \n\nWhile waiting for the dust to settle in Washington, some creators are exploring alternatives ways to promote themselves or their business, encouraging users to follow them on other social media platforms or are investing more time producing non-TikTok content. \n\nJohnson says she is already strategizing her next move and exploring alternative opportunities. While she hasn’t found a place quite like TikTok, she’s begun to spend more of her time on other platforms, such as Instagram and YouTube, both of whom are expected to benefit financially if TikTok vanishes. \n\nAccording to a report by Goldman Sachs, the so-called creator economy, which has been fueled in part by TikTok, could be worth $480 billion by 2027. \n\nBecause the opportunity to monetize content exists across a range of platforms, a vast amount of creators have already diversified their social media presence. However, many TikTok creators have credited the platform — and its algorithm — with giving them a type of exposure they did not receive on other platforms. Some say it has also boosted and provided opportunities for creators of color and those from other marginalized groups. \n\nDespite fears about the fate of TikTok, industry analysts note creators are generally avoiding making any big changes, like abandoning platform, until something actually happens.\n\n“I’m anxious but also trying to be hopeful in a weird way,\" said Brandon Hurst, who credits TikTok with rescuing his business from obscurity and propelling it into rapid growth. \n\nA year after joining TikTok, the 30-year-old Hurst, who sells plants, said his sales doubled, outpacing the traction he’d struggled to gain on Instagram. He built his clientele through the live feature on TikTok, which has helped him sell more than 77,000 plants. The business has thrived so much that he says he now employs five people, including his husband and mom.\n\n\"For me, this has been my sole way of doing business,\" Hurst said. \n\nBillion Dollar Boy, a New York-based influencer marketing agency, has advised creators to download all of their TikTok content into a personal portfolio, which is especially important for those who post primarily on the platform, said Edward East, the agency’s founder and group CEO. This can help them quickly build their audiences elsewhere. Plus it can serve as a resume for brands who might want to partner with them for product advertisements, East said. \n\nBut until the deadline of Jan. 19 comes around, East said creators should continue to post regularly on TikTok, which has 170 million month U.S. users and remains highly effective in reaching audiences. \n\nIf the Supreme Court does not delay the ban, as Trump is asking them to do, app stores and internet service providers would be required to stop providing service to TikTok by Jan. 19. That means anyone who doesn't have TikTok on their phone would be unable to download it. TikTok users would continue to have access, but the prohibitions — which will prevent them from updating the app — will eventually make the app \"unworkable,” the Justice Department has said. \n\nTikTok said in court documents that it estimates a one-month shutdown would cause the platform to lose approximately a third of its daily users in the U.S. The company argues a shutdown, even if temporary, will cause it irreparable harm, a legal bar used by judges to determine whether to put the brakes on a law facing a challenge. In under three weeks, Americans will know if the Supreme Court agrees.","summary":"The fate of TikTok is keeping creators and small business owners in anxious limbo as they await a decision from the Supreme Court that could upheld their livelihoods","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/tiktok-ban-creators-future-supreme-court-b2674158.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2024/12/06/15/TikTok_18212.jpg?quality=75&width=1200&auto=webp","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/rcCZqoO3-OhrQWqOm.mp4","publish_date":"2025-01-05 23:31:27","author":"Jonathan Landrum Jr,Jonathan Landrum Jr and Haleluya Hadero","authors":["Jonathan Landrum Jr","Jonathan Landrum Jr and Haleluya Hadero"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.032},{"id":278522270,"title":"Trump and the blindness of America’s elites","text":"In a few days, what liberal Americans described as a “mortal danger” to democracy will come to be: Donald Trump will be sworn in for a second term as president of the United States. The many different interpretations of this defeat in the Democratic Party, in the “progressive media” and in academia now constitute a vast and contradictory literature – from fierce self-criticism for the failure to listen to the anxieties of the working class to the complacent reading that racism and sexism are to blame for everything. In the din of confusion over this electoral loss, one voice stands out: that of Musa al-Gharbi.\r\nAl-Gharbi is a sociologist and assistant professor at the School of Communication and Journalism of Stony Brook University, and a fellow in sociology at Columbia. He is the author of “We Have Never Been Woke: The Cultural Contradictions of a New Elite” (Princeton University Press), published last October. In the book, as well as his doctoral dissertation published in 2023, al-Gharbi, scion of a military family who almost became a Catholic priest before converting to Islam, explains how the embrace between the new elites who produce and manage symbolic values – rather than material wealth – and the Democrats has contributed significantly to their rupture with the majority of American voters.\r\nIn this exclusive interview with Kathimerini, he explains why this happened, how Trump took advantage of it and how Democrats can restore their relationship with the average voter.\r\nCould you briefly explain the concept of symbolic elites and how their takeover of the Democratic Party lies at the heart of its problems?\r\nSo, symbolic capitalists are people who work in fields like consulting and finance, technonogy, education, media and so on. People who make a living by manipulating data and symbols instead of producing physical goods and services for people. What I show in my book is that, over the past 50 years especially, symbolic capitalists have gained a lot more power and influence over society, and over that period of time, a lot of inequalities have grown, a lot of social problems have persisted or grown worse, and so there are a lot of people who are dissatisfied with the way that the economy and the country is going. Starting in the late 60s, accelerating in the 90s and then even more after the 2010s, these symbolic capitalists have been consolidated in the Democratic Party. Today, professors are voting for the Democrats over Republicans by five to one; in the humanities and social science fields [the ratio] is 10 to one. Only about 3% of contemporary journalists are Republicans. The Democratic Party, in turn, has transformed a lot of its messaging, platform and priorities to cater to symbolic capitalists. We are a compelling constituency because we make more money than other people, we donate more, we’re more politically engaged, we vote consistently.\r\nWhat we saw after 2010, though, is what I call a “Great Awokening”: symbolic capitalists shifted radically in terms of how we think about politics, how we talk and think about social justice, and the Democratic Party shifted radically at the same time. We became a lot more militant during this period about mocking, censoring, condemning and villainizing anyone who didn’t agree with us about a lot of these issues. And so people noticed these gaps more, they resented us more and the political party that’s really tightly oriented around us became increasingly alienating for large numbers of voters.\r\nIn the meantime, income and wealth inequality continued to grow.\r\nCorrect. A lot of our institutions didn’t seem to be delivering the goods. We talked about social justice, but that wasn’t the reality that a lot of people were experiencing. This led to dissatisfaction with us and our preferred political party, and led a lot of people to shift towards the Republican Party. The way that we often like to think about this is as a kind of backlash to all the progress that was made during the “Great Awokening”: a bunch of rich, heterosexual white men who were dissatisfied with the patriarchy being threatened aligned themselves with a reactionary Republican Party in the name of white supremacy and so on.\r\n\r\nThe problem with this narrative is that when you look at who actually shifted in which direction, the backlash is actually being driven by the very people we think of ourselves as champions of. The people who shifted the most towards the Republican Party over the past 10 years are actually racial and ethnic minorities, religious people, less affluent and less educated people, and young people. So the less privileged among us are the people who have actually been the most alienated from the Democrats and who have been shifting most towards the GOP. And it’s really tough to understand a backlash that’s driven largely by racial and ethnic minorities, for instance, as being motivated by racism. Whites, relatively affluent, highly educated people, shifted more towards the Democratic Party over the same period.\r\nDo you think that the rejection of the Democrats in the November 5 US election is more related to what is called “culture” – with the alienation of ordinary voters on a range of social issues – rather than the economy?\r\nYeah, I think it’s both. If people feel like they can’t get ahead and they feel like their life prospects are going to be worse and the political discourse is focused on this niche cultural stuff and one party is taking these really extreme positions that are far out of step, it makes the cultural distance even more degrading than it would be under other circumstances […] I think it’s definitely the case since 2010.\r\nYou have written about the socialist in George Orwell’s “Road to Wigan Pier” who is, of all people, the further removed from the working class. To what extent is this a new development and not just another case of the traditional divide between party elites and intellectuals versus the masses?\r\nI think it’s a divide that’s been long-standing between – especially knowledge-oriented professionals – people like academics and media, people who work in cities and other workers. This gap has become in some ways more salient because the people who work in these kinds of professions have more power and influence over society than before. And in some ways, we are even more out of touch than we used to be. If you look at changes in the global economy from the time when Orwell was writing, these professionals were about 3% of all workers and were more evenly distributed throughout the country. Now we are about a third of all workers, concentrated in a small number of hubs, further removed from other people. This creates an opportunity for political entrepreneurs usually associated with the right to campaign against symbolic capitalists, to pledge to bring people like us back under control, to return our institutions to their proper function. Narratives about […] how the media has become a propaganda machine instead of telling you the truth become popular, in part because there are actual shifts that have occurred during these periods. It’s not purely a moral panic or people being delusional. We actually do conduct ourselves in a different way, and people react to that negatively.\r\nHow did a real estate magnate who inherited his wealth, with a track record as president that can hardly be called progressive on economic policy, become the tribune of the American working class? Do you think it’s just about his promise to take on the symbolic elites or is it something else as well?\r\nI view it as a glaring indictment of the Democratic Party and of symbolic capitalists that growing numbers of Americans would trust this person more than us and our party. But I think there’s also a sense in which, culturally, even though Trump is a billionaire who went to an Ivy League school, he is also in some senses closer to the median American voter than most of us and the politicians that we tend to gravitate towards. Look at the weird role that McDonald’s has played in these elections since Trump took office. Trump famously hosted a college football team and served them McDonald’s on silver trays. Many progressives at the time called it an insult, called it condescending, absurd or whatever. But a lot of other folks, including the athletes that he was serving, thought it was kind of great and funny. Or the stunt [in the 2024 campaign] where he worked at McDonald’s. No one sees Trump working at McDonald’s with his expensive suit underneath his apron and thinks that he’s just a regular guy. But what this stunt was really good at doing is generating terrible responses from symbolic capitalists […] who went on disparaging McDonald’s and the kind of people who work and eat there. That’s useful for Trump. And Trump has a genuine passion for the product. He forces other people, including RFK [Robert F. Kennedy Jr], to eat it.\r\nYou come from a military family. How effective was Trump’s message against US entanglements in foreign wars in attracting the votes of non-symbolic elites?\r\nIt’s been very effective. If you look at some of the places in 2016 that shifted the most [towards] Donald Trump, there were areas that had large concentrations of military people who had been deployed abroad. People who’ve lost someone, who have known the sacrifices of war, who don’t want to see their loved ones dying in pointless struggles. He was helped by the fact that his main opponent was a hawk who had never met a war she didn’t like. Hillary Clinton was in fact talking about escalating conflict in Ukraine and Syria and lots of other places during that campaign. And so this was an important driver of success for him in 2016 and even more so in 2024, with the US enabling these horrific policies in Gaza at the risk of being dragged more fully into [the conflict in the Middle East] because we just do whatever [Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin] Netanyahu wants.\r\nOne of the striking things [of the November election] is that we saw a lot of Muslims and Arab-Americans shifting towards the GOP in places like Dearborn [Michigan]. You might think, Trump is very pro-Israel so why on Earth would these folks vote for him instead of Joe Biden? But the thing is, if you look at the last year, Biden has just done whatever Netanyahu wanted, he hasn’t checked him in any way. And Kamala Harris, although she thinks it’s sad what’s happening in Gaza, policy-wise, there’s no change. I phrase it sometimes as such: if you have to choose between someone who’s definitely gonna cut off your arm or someone who might cut off your arm, might kill you or might give you 2 million dollars and cut off no part of your body, people would rather not have to risk losing their arm at all, but for a lot of people, they would rather roll the dice with option two than take a guaranteed amputation of their arm.

That'll Cost You, as New Congestion Toll Starts Sunday","text":"NEW YORK—New York’s new toll for drivers entering the center of Manhattan debuted Sunday, meaning many people will pay $9 to access the busiest part of the Big Apple during peak hours.\n\nThe toll, known as congestion pricing, is meant to reduce traffic gridlock in the densely packed city while also raising money to help fix its ailing public transit infrastructure.\n\n“We’ve been studying this issue for five years. And it only takes about five minutes if you’re in midtown Manhattan to see that New York has a real traffic problem,” Metropolitan Transportation Authority Chair and CEO Janno Lieber told reporters late Friday after a court hearing that cleared the way for the tolls.\n\n“We need to make it easier for people who choose to drive, or who have to drive, to get around the city.”\n\nThe cost to drivers depends on what time of the day it is and if drivers have an E-ZPass, an electronic toll collection system that’s used in many states.\n\nMost drivers with E-ZPasses will get dinged the $9 fee to enter Manhattan south of Central Park on weekdays between 5 a.m. and 9 p.m. and on weekends between 9 a.m. and 9 p.m. During off hours, the toll will be $2.25.\n\nThat’s on top of tolls drivers pay for crossing various bridges and tunnels to get to the city in the first place, although there will be a credit of up to $3 for those who have already paid to enter Manhattan via certain tunnels during peak hours.\n\nOn Sunday morning, hours after the toll went live, traffic moved briskly along the northern edge of the congestion zone at 60th Street and 2nd Avenue. Some motorists appeared unaware that the newly activated cameras, set along the arm of a steel gantry above the street, would be charging them a $9 fee.\n\n“Are you kidding me?” said Chris Smith, a resident of Somerville, New Jersey, as he drove against traffic beneath the cameras, avoiding the charge. “Whose idea was this? Kathy Hochul? She should be arrested for being ignorant.”\n\nPhil Bauer, a surgeon who lives just above 60th Street, said he was hopeful the program would lessen the bottlenecks and frequent honking that comes from the nearby bridge connecting Manhattan and Queens.\n\n“I think the idea would be good to try to minimize the amount of traffic down and try to promote people to use public transportation,” he said. “The Queensboro Bridge is pretty brutal.”\n\nPresident-elect Donald Trump has vowed to kill the program when he takes office, but it’s unclear if he will follow through. The plan had stalled during his first term while it waited on a federal environmental review.\n\nIn November, Trump, whose namesake Trump Tower is in the toll zone, said congestion pricing “will put New York City at a disadvantage over competing cities and states, and businesses will flee.”\n\n“Not only is this a massive tax to people coming in, it is extremely inconvenient from both driving and personal booking keeping standards,“ he said in a statement. ”It will be virtually impossible for New York City to come back as long as the congestion tax is in effect.”\n\nOther big cities around the world, including London and Stockholm, have similar congestion pricing schemes, but it is the first in the United States. Proponents of the idea note the programs were largely unpopular when first implemented, gaining approval as the public felt the benefits.\n\nIn New York City, even some transit riders voiced skepticism of a plan intended to raise much-needed funds for the subway system.\n\n“With my experience of the MTA and where they’ve allocated their funds in the past, they’ve done a pretty poor job with that,” said Christakis Charalambides, a supervisor in the fashion industry, as he waited for a subway in Lower Manhattan. “I don’t know if I necessarily believe it until I really see something.”\n\nThe toll was supposed to go into effect last year with a $15 charge, but Gov. Kathy Hochul abruptly paused the program before the 2024 election, when congressional races in suburban areas around the city—the epicenter of opposition to the program—were considered to be vital to her party’s effort to retake control of Congress.\n\nNot long after the election, Hochul rebooted the plan but at the lower $9 toll. She denies politics were at play and said she thought the original $15 charge was too much, though she had been a vocal supporter of the program before halting it.\n\nCongestion pricing also survived several lawsuits seeking to block the program, including a last-ditch effort from the state of New Jersey to have a judge put up a temporary roadblock against it. A spokesperson for New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy, Natalie Hamilton, said in an email Saturday, that they would” continue fighting against this unfair and unpopular scheme.”","url":"https://www.theepochtimes.com/us/driving-into-manhattan-thatll-cost-you-as-new-congestion-toll-starts-sunday-5786617","image":"https://img.theepochtimes.com/assets/uploads/2025/01/05/id5786670-New-York-congestion-pricing-GettyImages-2191962850-300x180.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-01-05 23:08:13","author":"The Associated Press","authors":["The Associated Press"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.274}]}
