Recently, I have gotten into a relationship, and it's great, and it feels very different to anything I've had before, which is a good sign to me.\n'It's the first person I've met in four years that I've introduced to my family. I'm happy. I've not done probably what I should-slash-did do - which is not really go to restaurants, not really do this and want to keep it on the quiet - I've done the opposite.\n\nThe duo made the most of their time in Florence, taking in the sights, enjoying fine dining and soaking up stunning sunset views\n\nHe captioned the post: 'A few days in florence with you' \n'I've been so blatant about it no one's noticed, which I'm sort of a little bit cocky at and I'm going to own.\n'But I thought I'm not going to... just because of my job and i don't want people finding out, I'm not going to miss out on this part.\n'I'm loving what I've got at the minute and I want to keep it that way.'\nLater in the chat, Louis gave Rylan advice on a long-lasting relationship, as he revealed that you have to figure things out more when you have children.\n'Is that something you've been thinking about?' Louis asked, to which Rylan replied: 'Yeah, I want kids. He wants kids.'\nRylan first shared he was in a new relationship on the BBC Radio 2 show last week, after playing a clip from his podcast interview with Louis. \nAs the clip came to an end, Lottie cheekily asked him if there was 'something else' that was mentioned, sparking a cheeky exchange where Rylan jokingly brushed off his co-host's questions, before confirming he was indeed seeing someone.\nHe said: 'I might have said that I'm... it feels weird saying it on the radio!' before admitting he'd 'kept it a secret for so long,' but he was indeed 'seeing someone.'\n\nThe holiday snaps come several weeks after Rylan revealed that his new boyfriend is the first man he's introduced to his family since his divorce \n\nThe former X Factor star was married to Dan Neal for six years before they divorced in 2021, after Rylan admitted he had cheated on him (both pictured 2016)\n\n Rylan Clark looks more loved-up than ever with fairground worker boyfriend as couple are spotted at Radio 2 In The Park alongside his mum Linda \nLottie added that she and her colleagues had met Rylan's new partner and thought he was 'lovely,' with the former X Factor star adding he is 'happy' and 'very content' in his new relationship. \nRylan also joked that sharing the romance would bring an end to speculation that he was dating his longtime pal Robert Rinder.\nThe This Morning star is said to have been quietly dating funfair employee Kennedy for several months, and the pair have been 'inseparable' over the summer. \n'This new man has certainly put a smile back on Rylan's face, and they have enjoyed spending lots of time together,' a source said.\n'Rylan's family and friends have all met him, and they've been attending lots of gigs together this summer, including Oasis. \nThe insider told The Sun on Sunday: 'They're inseparable, they make a lovely couple.' \nDaily Mail contacted Rylan's representatives for comment at the time.\nRylan Clark-Neal\n\nShare or comment on this article: \nRylan Clark goes Instagram official with new boyfriend Kennedy during romantic getaway to Florence\n\nAdd comment\n\n Share what you think\n\nNo comments have so far been submitted.

Rep. Jasmine Crockett (D-Texas), who sits on the committee, recently described her exchange with him over his handling of convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein's first criminal investigation.\n\nDuring a Friday interview with CNN host Jake Tapper, Crockett said she mainly wanted to get to the bottom of why Acosta decided on his plea agreement with Epstein, which Crockett called a \"sweetheart deal.\" That non-prosecution agreement allowed Epstein to serve just 13 months in prison — avoiding a possible life sentence for the sex trafficking of minors — while also being able to leave prison regularly on a work release program.\n\nCrockett said that Acosta — who was also briefly secretary of labor in President Donald Trump's first administration — insisted that he viewed the case against Epstein as too weak to win over a jury, and wanted to instead settle on at least some prison time and requiring Epstein to register as a sex offender. He also told Crockett that he had concerns about witnesses' willingness to testify. Crockett responded that the \"one witness rule\" makes it possible for a jury to convict a defendant based on the testimony of just one witness, and recounted hammering Acosta on agreeing to the plea deal despite a 53-count charging memo and reams of evidence.\n\n\"So I was really getting at him and he said, 'well, 2006 was a different time' ... I said, 'let me tell you something. I've been practicing law since 2006, so I know what was happening in 2006.' So I was really ready to tear in and really get down to some other things, because I've dealt with child sex cases and based on the little information that I know about what he had back then, in my opinion he had more than enough evidence, but he was arguing that he didn't.\"\n\nAccording to the Texas Democrat, Acosta also cited several child psychology experts who said that children can sometimes be unreliable witnesses, as their minds can block out traumatic memories as a protection mechanism. She responded that as an attorney, she had prosecuted sex offenders and was familiar with that issue, and then openly questioned Acosta's competency as a prosecutor given his unwillingness to take the case to trial.\n\nAcosta also reportedly insisted the plea agreement wasn't a \"sweetheart deal,\" given the guaranteed prison time, restitution payments to victims and him being required to register as a sex offender. Crockett noted that the former U.S. attorney told her that \"even today, looking back ... this deal was a good deal.\" Tapper remarked that Acosta's characterization of the deal was \"preposterous.\"\n\n\"I'm just telling you what the man said,\" Crockett said.\n\n - YouTube www.youtube.com","summary":"Former U.S. Attorney Alex Acosta recently participated in a closed-door deposition with members of the House Oversight Committee.

Jasmine Crockett (D-Texas), who sits on the committee, recently described her exchange with him over his handling of convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein's first criminal investigation.\n\nDuring a Friday interview with CNN host Jake Tapper, Crockett said she mainly wanted to get to the bottom of why Acosta decided on his plea agreement with Epstein, which Crockett called a \"sweetheart deal.\" That non-prosecution agreement allowed Epstein to serve just 13 months in prison — avoiding a possible life sentence for the sex trafficking of minors — while also being able to leave prison regularly on a work release program.\n\nCrockett said that Acosta — who was also briefly secretary of labor in President Donald Trump's first administration — insisted that he viewed the case against Epstein as too weak to win over a jury, and wanted to instead settle on at least some prison time and re","url":"https://www.alternet.org/jasmine-crockett-epstein-prosecutor/","image":"https://www.alternet.org/media-library/image.jpg?id=61625991&width=1200&height=600&coordinates=0%2C100%2C0%2C100","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-09-20 00:09:40","author":"Carl Gibson","authors":["Carl Gibson"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.213},{"id":361947508,"title":"Jimmy Kimmel cracks a smile on the way to orthodontist visit as Disney bosses decide his future","text":"Kim Kardashian\n\nVictoria Beckham\n\nHarry Styles\n\nAmanda Holden\n\nBritain's Got Talent\n\nPrivacy Policy\n\nSaturday, Sep 20th 2025\n\n5-Day Forecast\n\nAdvertisement\n\nInside Britain's deportation flight fiasco: Colouring books, 'treats' and violence - whistleblower guards reveal all to SUE REID\n\n'Besotted' Oscar Pistorius's new life with heiress lover... as tragic Reeva's British mother lies critically ill in hospital\n\nMan 'climbs out' hot air balloon and falls to his death: Tragedy as body is found hours later in sleepy village\n\nWilliam's had a rotten 18 months.

Email tips@dailymail.com \nBy ASHLEIGH GRAY \n Published:00:45 BST, 20 September 2025 |Updated:01:06 BST, 20 September 2025 \n\nJimmy Kimmel cracked a smile as he was seen on an orthodontist visit in Los Angeles on Friday, days after his late night show was pulled from the air.\nOn Wednesday his eponymous program, Jimmy Kimmel Live!, was suspended 'indefinitely' amid MAGA backlash over his comments regarding the death of conservative activist Charlie Kirk.\nKirk was shot dead while debating students at Utah Valley University campus on Wednesday, September 10. The suspected shooter is 22-year-old Tyler Robinson, who was raised in a Republican, gun-toting household.\nKimmel said during his opening monologue on Monday: 'We hit a new low over the weekend with the MAGA gang desperately trying to characterize this kid who murdered Charlie Kirk as anything other than one of them, and doing everything they can to score political points from it.'\nHe then showed a clip of President Donald Trump bizarrely directing a reporter's attention to White House construction after being asked how he was doing in the wake of Kirk's death.\nAhead of the weekend Kimmel was spotted in the driver's seat of a black car, wearing a button-up white shirt and black sunglasses as he entered a medical plaza with security in tow.\n\nJimmy Kimmel was seen on an orthodontist visit in Los Angeles on Friday, days after his late night show was pulled from the air\n\nAhead of the weekend Kimmel was spotted in the driver's seat of a black car, wearing a button-up white shirt and black sunglasses as he entered a medical plaza with security in tow\nHis 54-year-old right-hand-man Guillermo Rodriguez was also seen in LA this week, appearing downcast following the show's cancellation.\nHe wore black athletic shorts, a gray graphic T-shirt, and black sneakers. \n\n Sydney Sweeney was already in Hollywood's bad books for being a poster girl for Trump... now she's dating the music mogul loathed by Taylor Swift's army of fans \nPoking fun at Trump's reaction to the shooting during Monday's episode, Kimmel said: 'This is not how an adult grieves the murder of someone he calls a friend; this is how a four-year-old mourns a goldfish.'\nShortly after ABC announced Kimmel's show had been suspended, Trump said: 'The ratings challenged Jimmy Kimmel Show is CANCELLED.\n'Congratulations to ABC for finally having the courage to do what had to be done.'\nStaff of the Jimmy Kimmel Show! were seen packing up their gear from the Los Angeles studio on Wednesday, hours after the show was halted.\nHollywood unions SAG-AFTRA and WGA showed their support for Kimmel — who is a member of both — in the wake of the news.\nHe was spotted on Thursday afternoon, wearing black sunglasses and a navy button down in the drivers seat of his Audi. \nPhotos of the host were taken at a Century City location where several law firms are based.\n\nHis 54-year-old right-hand-man Guillermo Rodriguez was also seen in LA this week, appearing downcast following the show's cancellation. He wore black athletic shorts, a gray graphic T-shirt, and black sneakers\n\nCharlie Kirk was shot dead while debating students at Utah Valley University campus on Wednesday, September 10\n\nProtesters gathered outside the El Capitan Theater in Hollywood, where Jimmy Kimmel Live! is filmed, on Thursday\nA statement from the acting guild read: 'SAG-AFTRA condemns the suspension of Jimmy Kimmel Live! Our society depends on freedom of expression. Suppression of free speech and retaliation for speaking out on significant issues of public concern run counter to the fundamental rights we all rely on.\n'Democracy thrives when diverse points of view are expressed. The decision to suspend airing Jimmy Kimmel Live! is the type of suppression and retaliation that endangers everyone’s freedoms. SAG-AFTRA stands with all media artists and defends their right to express their diverse points of view, and everyone’s right to hear them.'\nThe Writers Guild of America West and Writers Guild of America East also condemned the decision: 'The right to speak our minds and to disagree with each other – to disturb, even – is at the very heart of what it means to be a free people. It is not to be denied. Not by violence, not by the abuse of governmental power, nor by acts of corporate cowardice.\n'As a Guild, we stand united in opposition to anyone who uses their power and influence to silence the voices of writers, or anyone who speaks in dissent. If free speech applied only to ideas we like, we needn’t have bothered to write it into the Constitution. \n'What we have signed on to — painful as it may be at times — is the freeing agreement to disagree. Shame on those in government who forget this founding truth. As for our employers, our words have made you rich. Silencing us impoverishes the whole world.' \nLos AngelesJimmy KimmelCharlie Kirk\n\nShare or comment on this article: \nJimmy Kimmel cracks a smile on the way to orthodontist visit as Disney bosses decide his future\n\nAdd comment\n\nComments 17\n\n Share what you think\n\nWorst rated\n\nThe comments below have not been moderated.\n\nThe views expressed in the contents above are those of our users and do not necessarily reflect the views of MailOnline.\n\nAdd your comment\n\nEnter your comment\n\nBy posting your comment you agree to our house rules.\n\nSubmit Comment\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual.\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual\n\nWe will automatically post your comment and a link to the news story to your Facebook timeline at the same time it is posted on MailOnline.

Mikie Sherrill, D-N.J., the far-left Democratic nominee for governor, called Charlie Kirk a Christian nationalist who wanted to roll back the rights of women and Black people following the passage of a House resolution honoring the conservative activist. The House adopted a resolution to honor Kirk's \"life and legacy\" on Friday, just over a week after he was shot and killed during a college campus speaking event in Utah. The measure got bipartisan support in a 310-58 vote, with both Democrats and Republicans having quickly risen to condemn political violence in the wake of Kirk's assassination. The vote divided Democrats, however, with 95 lawmakers voting to adopt the resolution, 58 voting against it and 22 not voting at all. LAWMAKER WHO TIED KIRK TO ‘DOMESTIC TERRORISM’ FACING EXPULSION CALLS AMID POLITICIAN BLOWBACK NATIONWIDE \"I take my oath to the Constitution seriously. I believe in free speech. And that the First Amendment wouldn’t be necessary if it were only meant to cover language we agreed with,\" Sherrill said in a statement. \"It is meant to protect people like Charlie Kirk who present vile dissenting views. But it is also meant to protect teachers, doctors, and TV comedians who may express views the president doesn’t like.\" \"Charlie Kirk was advocating for a Christian nationalist government and to roll back the rights of women and Black people — this flies in the face of every value I hold dear and that I fight for,\" she added. \"But the Constitution protects free speech, even for those I vehemently oppose.\" In addition, the lawmaker said President Donald Trump continues to \"define hypocrisy.\" \"On one hand, he denounced Kirk’s politically motivated killing, while on the other hand, he is instigating a witch hunt worthy of Joseph McCarthy to shut down the free speech rights of anyone who disagrees with Kirk’s racist, anti-American views,\" she said. 58 HOUSE DEMS VOTE AGAINST RESOLUTION HONORING 'LIFE AND LEGACY' OF CHARLIE KIRK While condemning Kirk's murder, she said she will continue to \"condemn political violence, racism, attacks on women, and the hypocrisy coming from Trump and his acolytes.\" Sherrill has been criticized by Republicans for embracing Zohran Mamdani, a socialist who is the Democratic nominee for the 2025 New York City mayoral election. \"It’s not that hard to disavow socialism, and Mikie Sherrill’s official comments saying she shares the goals of Socialist Zohran Mamdani is not only absurd, but it is disqualifying.

The card features a portrait of the president, the Statue of Liberty and the American flag underneath a gold background, with \"Trump Gold Card\" stamped on the left side. \"For far too long, we have had millions of Illegal Aliens pouring into our Country, and our Immigration System was broken,\" Trump wrote in a Truth Social post. \"It is beyond time that the American People, and American Taxpayers, are benefitting from our LEGAL Immigration System.\" FOREIGN TRAVELERS SOON TO PAY 'VISA INTEGRITY FEE' TO VISIT THE U.S. COSTING $250 Individuals are now able to purchase the card for $1 million, and corporations will later be able to purchase a card for $2 million. \"We anticipate THE TRUMP GOLD CARD will generate well over $100 Billion Dollars very quickly,\" Trump wrote. \"This money will be used for reducing Taxes, Pro Growth Projects, and paying down our Debt.\" Interested parties can apply for the \"exclusive privileges\" on the official website, trumpcard.gov. TRUMP TOUTS ‘WORKER-FIRST’ ECONOMY ON LABOR DAY AS INTERNET SPECULATION OF HIS WHEREABOUTS SPIRALS According to the site, applicants will submit their documents and pay a nonrefundable processing fee, triggering an accelerated probe by the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services. From there, officials will conduct an in-depth background check and vet the potential cardholder. Once an applicant is approved, a Trump Gold Card will be available for use throughout all 50 states and territories. They will be given lawful permanent resident status as an EB-1 or EB-2 visa holder. POPULAR DESTINATION MAY EXPAND 'GOLDEN' VISA PERKS, OPENING MORE DOORS FOR WEALTHY The website notes that the Trump Gold Card status acts as a visa, and may be revoked due to national security and other risks.

However polished things may look today, that history still lingers in the background.\"\n\nIn 1994, Trump told the New York Times Charles and Diana had applied to join his newly opened Palm Beach club, Mar-a-Lago, and that he had personally handled their $500,000 membership checks. \n\nThe royals responded bluntly, saying: \"It's complete nonsense. They have not joined the club.\"Trump Pushed Diana As His 'Ultimate Trophy Wife'Trump later admitted he had only offered honorary memberships. Charles declined, suggesting Trump make a donation to one of his environmental charities instead.\n\nRumors also swirled in the 1980s and 1990s the couple was considering a Trump Tower apartment in New York. \n\nThose reports, too, were dismissed by the palace, but the publicity was invaluable for Trump, whose real estate empire was weathering multiple bankruptcies at the time.\n\nMore damaging were Trump's attempts to woo Diana in the mid-1990s. Broadcaster Selina Scott, a friend of the princess, later recalled Trump sent her huge bouquets of flowers and saw her as the \"ultimate trophy wife.\"Trump Admitted Regret Over Not Dating DianaDiana confided, \"he gives me the creeps,\" Scott wrote. Trump himself admitted in his 1997 book Art of the Comeback his one regret in the \"women department\" was not dating Diana, though he denied pursuing her.\n\nA source said: \"This second state visit is highly significant for the transatlantic relationship, with issues like trade and defense front and center. But the royals are well aware that Trump has often exploited speculation about Charles and Diana to serve his own interests. That's why the memory of Diana still shadows the occasion.\"\n\nTrump revisited the Mar-a-Lago claim in 1995, saying, \"I didn't say they signed. I said they were members.\" Yet Charles' only confirmed visit to the resort was in 1988 for a cocktail party before a polo match.Author Says Trump Sees Himself Above RoyaltyLaurence Leamer, author of Mar-a-Lago: Inside the Gates of Power at Donald Trump's Presidential Palace, said Trump's fascination with royalty is about self-image. \n\n\"Trump loves royalty because that's what he wants to be – a democratic king. He's enthralled by them, and he sees himself as their equal, if not their superior.\"\n\nLeamer added: \"He's the luckiest man alive. Anyone else with his history would be disgraced, but he always comes back. For Trump, this visit isn't about diplomacy. It's about attention. He sees himself as the king of the world.\"","summary":"Princess Diana's ghost was said to have haunted Donald Trump's visit to King Charles, following several awkward exchanges with the beloved royal.","url":"https://radaronline.com/p/princess-diana-ghost-haunted-donald-trump-charles-visit/","image":"https://media.radaronline.com/brand-img/BEGg0ve9Y/0x0/princess-diana-ghost-haunted-donald-trump-charles-visit-1758321575653.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-09-19 23:55:00","author":"Matthew Acton","authors":["Matthew Acton"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.126},{"id":361945584,"title":"Trump demands $100,000 fee for coveted tech-centric H-1B work visas","text":"President Donald Trump has signed a proclamation imposing a $100,000 fee on H-1B visa applicants.\n\nH-1B visas are designed to bring highly-skilled foreign workers to the U.S. for jobs that are deemed difficult to fill, particularly in tech.

The program instead has turned into a pipeline for overseas workers who are often willing to work for as little as $60,000 annually. That is far less than $100,000-plus salaries typically paid to U.S. technology workers.\n\nTrump on Friday insisted that the tech industry would not oppose the move. “I think they’re going to be very happy,” he said.\n\nRepresentatives for the biggest tech companies, including Amazon, Apple, Google and Meta, did not immediately respond to messages for comment on Friday. Microsoft declined to comment.\n\n“So no longer will you put trainees on an H-1B visa,” Lutnick said on a call with reporters. “That it’s just not economic anymore. If you’re going to train people, you’re going to train Americans. … If you have a very sophisticated engineer and you want to bring them in … then you can pay $100,000 a year for your H-1B visa.”\n\nTrump also announced he will start selling a “gold card” visa with a potential pathway to U.S. citizenship. The “Trump Gold Card” will be available for a processing fee and a $1 million contribution after vetting. For companies, it will cost $2 million. The “Trump Platinum Card,” meanwhile, will be available for a $5 million contribution and will allow foreigners to spend up to 270 days in the U.S. without being subject to U.S. taxes on non-U.S. income. Trump announced a $5 million gold card in February to replace an existing investor visa — this is now the platinum card. Applicants can sign up now for a waitlist for the platinum card, but it still needs to be approved by Congress.\n\nThe actions appear intent on reshaping the visa system for wealthy and high-skilled foreigners despite near-certain legal challenges and widespread criticism that Trump is going beyond presidential authority by sidestepping Congress. The changes, if they survive legal muster, will deliver staggering price increases for high-skilled and investor visas created by Congress in 1990.\n\nFirst lady Melania Trump, the former Melania Knauss, was granted an H-1B work visa in October 1996 to work as a model. She was born in Slovenia.\n\nThe H-1B program was created in 1990 for people with a bachelor’s degree or higher in fields where jobs are deemed hard to fill, especially science, technology, engineering and math. Critics say they allow companies to pay lower wages with fewer labor protections.\n\nHistorically, these visas — 85,000 per year — have been doled out through a lottery system. This year, Amazon was by far the top recipient of H-1B visas with more than 10,000 awarded, followed by Tata Consultancy, Microsoft, Apple and Google. Geographically, California has the highest number of H-1B workers, according to UCIS.\n\nCritics say H-1B spots often go to entry-level jobs, rather than senior positions with unique skill requirements. And while the program isn’t supposed to undercut U.S. wages or displace U.S. workers, critics say companies can pay less by classifying jobs at the lowest skill levels, even if the specific workers hired have more experience.\n\nAs a result, many U.S. companies find it cheaper simply to contract out help desks, programming and other basic tasks to consulting companies such as Wipro, Infosys, HCL Technologies and Tata in India and IBM and Cognizant in the U.S. These consulting companies hire foreign workers, often from India, and contract them out to U.S. employers looking to save money.\n\nDoug Rand, who served as the director of U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services during the Biden administration, said this amounts to a “split personality disorder” for the program, with only about half of the visas each year going to traditional companies that offer long-term employment and can put immigrants on a track to citizenship. The other half go to staffing or consulting firms — and while many are established and well-known companies, others are just one-person operations that wouldn’t exist without the H-1B program.\n\n“They’re basically entering the lottery so they can hire people that they then rent out to other larger companies doing actual work,” Rand said. “And so there’s a lot of misbehavior and chicanery in this part of the system.”\n\nIn 2024, lottery bids for the visas plunged nearly 40%, which authorities said was due to success against people who were “gaming the system” by submitting multiple, sometimes dubious, applications to unfairly increase chances of being selected.\n\nMajor technology companies that use H-1B visas sought changes after massive increases in bids left their employees and prospective hires with slimmer chances of winning the random lottery. Facing what it acknowledged was likely fraud and abuse, USCIS this year said each employee had only one shot at the lottery, whether the person had one job offer or 50.\n\nCritics welcomed the change but said more needs to be done. The AFL-CIO wrote last year that while changes to the lottery “included some steps in the right direction,” it fell short of needed reforms. The labor group wants visas awarded to companies that pay the highest wages instead of by random lottery, a change that Trump sought during his first term in the White House.\n\nCopyright 2025 The Associated Press.

United States Secretary of Commerce, Howard Lutnick, noted that through the gold card plan, the US will only allow “extraordinary people at the very top” to come to the US who can create business and jobs for Americans. Lutnick called the employment-based green card programme “illogical”, noting that under that programme, the country was taking in “bottom quartile” people who earned only USD 66,000 a year. “Historically, the employment-based green card programme led in 2,81,000 people a year. And those people, on average, earned $66,000 a year, and they were five times more likely to go on government assistance programmes. So we were taking in the bottom quartile, below the average American. It was illogical. The only country in the world that was taking in the bottom quartile,” Lutnick said. “We are going to stop doing that. We’re going to only take extraordinary people at the very top, instead of those trying to take jobs from Americans. They’re going to create businesses and create jobs for Americans. And this programme will raise more than $100 billion for the Treasury of the United States of America,” he added. White House Staff Secretary Will Scharf emphasised the US commitment to preventing illegal immigration and opening pathways for people who can contribute to the US. “A major focus of your Administration has been shifting the conversation and shifting the policy dynamics around the issue of immigration, closing the border, preventing illegal immigration, but also, as is the case with the executive order in front of you, opening new pathways ways for truly extraordinary people to come contribute to America instead of taking away from it,” Will Scharf said. “So this executive order is entitled the Gold Card. It will set up a new visa pathway for foreigners of extraordinary ability who are committed to supporting the United States, for a payment of $1 million to the US Treasury, or if a corporation is sponsoring them, $2 million by that corporation,” he added. Additionally, Trump issued a proclamation imposing a USD 100,000 fee on H-1B visa applications.The action aims to curb the overuse of the program, allowing companies to bring in only “highly skilled” workers from other countries. The Trump administration believes that this move will create and protect jobs for US workers.The H-1B is a non-immigrant visa which allows US-based companies to hire and employ foreign workers for speciality jobs like science, technology, engineering, mathematics (STEM), and IT (High skills and at least a bachelor’s degree).United States Secretary of Commerce, Howard Lutnick, said, “The whole idea is that no more will these big tech companies or other big companies train foreign workers. They have to pay the government $100,000, then they have to pay the employee. So it’s just not economic. If you’re going to train somebody, you’re going to train one of the recent graduates from one of the great universities across our land, train Americans, stop bringing in people to take our jobs. That’s the policy here. All of the big companies are on board.” (ANI)","summary":"","url":"https://www.news18.com/agency-feeds/trump-announces-usd-1-million-gold-card-visa-program-for-residency-9584570.html","image":"https://images.news18.com/ibnlive/uploads/2025/05/News18_India_Section_Default_Image_1600x900-2025-05-b4faf46d67a95708181b01e36cf20c4b.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-09-19 23:45:02","author":"News18","authors":["News18"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"in","sentiment":-0.109},{"id":361947484,"title":"It's time to drop these endless probes into the SAS's actions during the Troubles: Col Nick Kitson","text":"It's disappointing – and not a little worrying – that after the very informative July veterans debate in Westminster about the Legacy Act, ex-soldiers hear nothing from the government until a Friday afternoon press conference with a foreign government launching renewed proposals.\n\nIt is hard to understand how it is in the UK's national interest to keep hauling over the coals of the Troubles, which the previous Labour government gave so much to try to draw a line under over 20 years ago.\n\nReleasing convicted murderers and terrorists, letters of immunity, decommissioning of weapons (which were also potential evidence) and all the rest that came with the 1998 Good Friday Agreement.\n\nWhy are we deferring to the Irish government – are they an honest broker in these matters and is their national interest aligned with our own?

And now he smells money prostituting himself to, and collaborating with, the right wing,” Olbermann wrote in a post on X. \n\nOlbermann has been under scrutiny in recent days for a controversial X post targeting Kirk and Sinclair Broadcast Group criticizing Kimmel. \n\nOlbermann responded to Sinclair’s statement, which said that Kimmel’s suspension from his ABC late-night show was “not enough.” \n\nSinclair called for ABC to air a remembrance for Kirk in lieu of Kimmel’s show after the conservative influencer was shot and killed last week.\n\n“Burn in hell, Sinclair,” Olbermann wrote on X. \n\n“Alongside Charlie Kirk.”\n\nSocial media users slammed Olbermann’s post.\n\nThe former MSNBC talking head continued to share thoughts about the Kimmel situation. \n\nHere’s the latest on Jimmy Kimmel’s suspension after Charlie Kirk comments\n\nJimmy Kimmel raged against Trump almost every night for a year before ABC pulled him off air\n\nDisney bosses want Jimmy Kimmel to ‘de-escalate’ before putting show back on air: reports\n\nHow late-night hosts handled Jimmy Kimmel suspension in first shows since ABC yanked him from air\n\nJimmy Kimmel’s suspension just latest example of Disney yanking celebrities off the air\n\nHe referenced the remarks that led to Kimmel’s discipline, posting that “Nothing Jimmy Kimmel said was untrue.”\n\nOn Monday, Kimmel accused conservatives of reaching “new lows” in trying to pin a left-wing ideology on 22-year-old suspect Tyler Robinson, even though prosecutors reaffirmed those ties in Tuesday’s indictment.\n\n“We hit some new lows over the weekend with the MAGA gang desperately trying to characterize this kid who murdered Charlie Kirk as anything other than one of them and doing everything they can to score political points from it,” Kimmel said.\n\nSmith, while criticizing Kimmel’s attempted joke, expressed sympathy for the “comedian” but still insisted Kimmel’s antagonism toward President Donald Trump is not “wise.” \n\n“To hear the news of Jimmy Kimmel being taken off the air, I was not happy about it. Not at all,” Smith said.\n\n“Because I do think he’s a good man. I do think his heart is in the right place. I do think he’s done an incredible service to the ABC and Walt Disney family spanning decades.”\n\n“I certainly hope that ultimately he ends up back on the air, and if he doesn’t end up back on the air, I hope he lives a very long and well and prosperous life.”\n\n“Having said all of that, that doesn’t mean I’m not entitled to say that what transpired between him and [President Donald Trump] didn’t appear to be the wisest move in the world.”\n\nKimmel’s comments came one day after both FBI officials and Utah Gov.

The figures offer an early gauge of what is shaping up as a major enforcement effort that comes after similar operations were launched in Los Angeles and Washington, D.C.\n\nThe figures released by Homeland Security include arrests by Immigration and Customs Enforcement as well as other federal agencies assisting in the operation.\n\nICE launched its Chicago area operation dubbed “Midway Blitz” on Sept. 8, drawing concern from activists and immigrant communities who say there’s been a noticeable uptick in immigration enforcement agents. That has deepened dread in communities already fearful of the large-scale arrests or aggressive tactics used in other cities targeted by President Donald Trump ’s hardline immigration policies.\n\nThe operation has brought allegations of excessive force and heavy-handed dragnets that have ensnared U.S. citizens, while gratifying Trump supporters who say he is delivering on a promise of mass deportations.\n\nThe Trump administration has promised to send an influx of immigration agents and National Guard troops to Chicago, over the fierce of objections of local leaders and residents. A military deployment to Chicago has yet to materialize even as immigration enforcement operations continue.\n\nOfficials and activists in the Chicago area opposed to the enforcement surge argue the approach is dangerous and imprecise, pointing to accounts of two U.S. citizens who were briefly detained this week by federal officers focused on immigration enforcement. Advocates also have protested the death of a man shot by an ICE officer on Sept. 12 after authorities said he tried to flee during a traffic stop, dragging the officer.\n\nMarcos Charles, the acting head of ICE's Enforcement and Removal Operations, said in an interview with the Associated Press Friday that as of Thursday roughly 50% to 60% of the Chicago operation arrests were targeted arrests, meaning they were specific people that ICE was trying to find because they had committed a crime, had a final order of removal or had done something that put them on ICE’s radar.\n\nThe rest were what’s often referred to as “collateral arrests,” meaning people that ICE comes across during their operations who aren’t the person they’re looking for but are in the country illegally, so ICE can arrest them.\n\nCollateral arrests were not allowed during the Biden administration but the Trump administration threw out those restrictions almost immediately after coming into office as part of Trump’s efforts to beef up deportations.\n\n“It doesn’t mean that the collateral arrests are non-criminal. Some of our collateral arrests ... also have criminal convictions and arrests. They just weren’t the people we were looking for at the time,” said Charles.\n\nThe Department of Homeland Security launched “Midway Blitz” after months of Trump administration criticism of Chicago and Illinois over state and local policies that restrict law enforcement cooperation with ICE.\n\nICE says these policies mean that immigrants who’ve committed crimes in the U.S. and can be deported as a result are instead released into the community. ICE says it then has to go out into the community and track them down to remove them.\n\nMany local officials and activists have said that immigration enforcement is a federal responsibility and that if they cooperate with ICE, it makes it less likely that immigrants who are victims or witnesses to crime will come forward to work with police.","summary":"Immigration enforcement officials have arrested almost 550 people as part of an operation in the Chicago area that launched a little less than two weeks ago, the Department of Homeland Security said Friday.

The program instead has turned into a pipeline for overseas workers who are often willing to work for as little as $60,000 annually. That is far less than $100,000-plus salaries typically paid to U.S. technology workers.\n\nTrump on Friday insisted that the tech industry would not oppose the move. “I think they're going to be very happy,” he said.\n\nFirst lady Melania Trump, the former Melania Knauss, was granted an H1-B work visa in October 1996 to work as a model. She was born in Slovenia.\n\nThe H1-B program was created in 1990 for people with a bachelor’s degree or higher in fields where jobs are deemed hard to fill, especially science, technology, engineering and math. Critics say they allow companies to pay lower wages with fewer labor protections.\n\nHistorically, these visas — 85,000 per year — have been doled out through a lottery system. This year, Amazon was by far the top recipient of H-1B visas with more than 10,000 awarded, followed by Tata Consultancy, Microsoft, Apple and Google. Geographically, California has the highest number of H-1B workers, according to UCIS.\n\nCritics say H-1B spots often go to entry-level jobs, rather than senior positions with unique skill requirements. And while the program isn’t supposed to undercut U.S. wages or displace U.S. workers, critics say companies can pay less by classifying jobs at the lowest skill levels, even if the specific workers hired have more experience.\n\nAs a result, many U.S. companies find it cheaper simply to contract out help desks, programming and other basic tasks to consulting companies such as Wipro, Infosys, HCL Technologies and Tata in India and IBM and Cognizant in the U.S. These consulting companies hire foreign workers, often from India, and contract them out to U.S. employers looking to save money.\n\nDoug Rand, who served as the director of U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services during the Biden administration, said this amounts to a “split personality disorder” for the program, with only about half of the visas each year going to traditional companies that offer long-term employment and can put immigrants on a track to citizenship. The other half go to staffing or consulting firms — and while many are established and well-known companies, others are just one-person operations that wouldn’t exist without the H1-B program.\n\n“They’re basically entering the lottery so they can hire people that they then rent out to other larger companies doing actual work,” Rand said. “And so there’s a lot of misbehavior and chicanery in this part of the system.”\n\nIn 2024, lottery bids for the visas plunged nearly 40%, which authorities said was due to success against people who were “gaming the system” by submitting multiple, sometimes dubious, applications to unfairly increase chances of being selected.\n\nMajor technology companies that use H-1B visas sought changes after massive increases in bids left their employees and prospective hires with slimmer chances of winning the random lottery. Facing what it acknowledged was likely fraud and abuse, USCIS this year said each employee had only one shot at the lottery, whether the person had one job offer or 50.\n\nCritics welcomed the change but said more needs to be done. The AFL-CIO wrote last year that while changes to the lottery “included some steps in the right direction,” it fell short of needed reforms. The labor group wants visas awarded to companies that pay the highest wages instead of by random lottery, a change that Trump sought during his first term in the White House.","summary":"President Donald Trump on Friday signed a proclamation that will require a new annual $100,000 fee for H-1B visa applications, among other changes to the program for highly skilled foreign workers that has come under scrutiny by the administration.

AP’s earlier story follows below.\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump said Friday that a federal prosecutor in Virginia whose monthslong mortgage fraud investigation into New York Attorney General Letitia James has not resulted in criminal charges should be removed from his position.\n\n“It looks to me like she’s really guilty of something, but I really don’t know,” Trump told reporters in the Oval Office on Friday without citing any evidence.\n\nTrump also said he was bothered that Erik Siebert, a career federal prosecutor in the prestigious Eastern District of Virginia whom he nominated this year to serve as the office’s U.S. Attorney, had been supported by the state’s two Democratic senators.\n\n“Yeah, I want him out,” Trump said.\n\nThe discussions about replacing Siebert come amid a push by Trump administration officials to bring charges against James, a perceived adversary of the president who has successfully sued him for fraud. Siebert was earlier informed that the administration was preparing to remove him, a person familiar with matter told The Associated Press, though no personnel change had been announced by the Justice Department or White House as of Friday evening.\n\nSpokespeople for Seibert’s office and the Justice Department declined to comment.\n\nTrump administration officials have been aggressively pursuing allegations against James arising from alleged paperwork discrepancies on her Brooklyn townhouse and a Virginia home. The Justice Department has spent months conducting the investigation but has yet to bring charges, and there’s been no indication that prosecutors have managed to uncover any degree of incriminating evidence that could support bringing an indictment.\n\nTo the extent the effort to replace Siebert is designed to hasten criminal charges, the move is likely to deepen concerns that the department — already investigating other public figures President Donald Trump regards as foes — is being weaponized by a White House seeking to have its prosecutorial powers used for purposes of retribution.\n\nJames’ lawyers have vigorously denied any allegations and characterized the investigation as an act of political revenge.\n\nABC News was first to report that Trump administration officials were pressuring prosecutors to bring charges and that the Republican administration was preparing to oust Siebert, who was nominated by Trump to the top job in the office after having worked there for more than a decade.\n\nJames has long been a particular source of outrage for Trump, in part because of a lawsuit she filed against him and his company that resulted in a massive financial penalty. That penalty was thrown out last month by an appeals court that narrowly upheld a judge’s finding that Trump had engaged in fraud by exaggerating his wealth for decades.\n\nThe case has taken a series of unorthodox turns. It emerged last month that Ed Martin, who helms the Justice Department’s Weaponization Working Group and is helping coordinate the investigation, had sent a letter urging James to resign from office “as an act of good faith” after starting his mortgage fraud investigation of her. He later turned up outside James’ Brooklyn townhouse in a “Columbo”-esque trench coat. A New York Post writer at the scene observed him tell a neighbor: “I’m just looking at houses, interesting houses. It’s an important house.”\n\nJames’ lawyer, Abbe Lowell, told Martin in a letter that the request for James’ resignation defied Justice Department standards and codes of professional responsibility and legal ethics.\n\nThe Justice Department “has firm policies against using investigations and against using prosecutorial power for achieving political ends,” Lowell wrote. “This is ever more the case when that demand is made to seek political revenge against a public official in the opposite party.”\n\nA former District of Columbia police officer, Siebert joined the Eastern District of Virginia — an elite Justice Department prosecution office with a history of sophisticated national security and criminal cases — in 2010. He was nominated to the role of U.S. attorney by Trump this year with the backing of the state’s two Democratic senators, Mark Warner and Tim Kaine.\n\nThe office has separately been involved in investigating matters related to the years-old investigation into potential ties between Russia and Trump’s 2016 presidential campaign, a longstanding grievance of the president. No charges have been announced as part of that work.\n\nAlthough U.S. attorneys are presidential appointees, they are rarely fired. But the Trump administration has repeatedly disregarded norms and traditions meant to insulate Justice Department prosecutors from White House political influence. Prosecutors and other support personnel who worked on the special counsel team of Jack Smith that investigated and prosecuted Trump have been fired, as was Maurene Comey, whose father, former FBI Director James Comey, was terminated by Trump months into his first term amid the Russia election interference investigation.\n\nMartin’s investigation stems from a letter Federal Housing Finance Agency Director William Pulte sent to Attorney General Pam Bondi in April asking her to investigate and consider prosecuting James, alleging she had “falsified bank documents and property records.”\n\nPulte, whose agency regulates mortgage financiers Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, cited “media reports” claiming James had falsely listed a Virginia home as her principal residence, and he suggested she may have been trying to avoid higher interest rates that often apply to second homes.\n\nRecords show James was listed as a co-borrower on a house her niece was buying in 2023. Lowell said records and correspondence easily disproved Pulte’s allegation.

Kathy Hochul, Assembly Speaker Carl Heastie and Senate Majority Leader Andrea Stewart-Cousins — have now all endorsed the 33-year-old leftist for NYC mayor.\n\nThey’re opening the floodgates for Mamdani’s extreme agenda to take root across the state.\n\nBut standing in the way is Jay Jacobs, the party’s state chair and a sworn enemy of its socialist wing.\n\nHe bluntly rebuffed the prospect of an endorsement: “I reject the platform of the so-called ‘Democratic Socialists of America’ and do not believe that it represents the principles, values or policies of the Democratic Party.”\n\nNassau County Reps. Tom Suozzi and Laura Gillen likewise refused to back Mamdani.\n\nInstead, they doubled down on their concerns about his radical views on public safety and Israel.\n\nThese regular Democrats recognize the danger that the young radical poses to the wider party: Their reelection bids could be early casualties of a Mamdani mayoralty.\n\nBoth hail from purple districts that voted in Republicans in 2022, when then-Rep. Lee Zeldin ran an impressively close race against Hochul on a tough-on-crime message.\n\nIn total, Democrats lost four New York House seats in 2022, three of which they regained last year.\n\nThe GOP’s pitch to voters writes itself: Don’t want socialist extremism to spread near you? Vote Republican.\n\nFor all of his charm, Mamdani is an extremely polarizing figure.\n\nIf his extreme criminal-justice agenda cuts down a police headcount hovering near three-decade lows, New Yorkers are going to feel increasingly unsafe as response times climb.\n\nAs they will if social workers replace cops and fail to deal adequately with violent mentally ill and homeless people.\n\nZeldin showed that’s a recipe for Republicans to flip swing House seats yet again.\n\nA Manhattan Institute poll conducted in January showed 70% of New York City voters want more police officers; 81% want more on subways. \n\nDon’t expect those numbers to decrease in swing districts like Suozzi’s and Gillen’s.\n\nWorse, if civil unrest occurs on Mamdani’s watch, how will he restore order — if he even tries?\n\nHe’s vowed to disband the NYPD’s Strategic Response Group, the unit responsible for responding to large protests and mass shootings like the July atrocity at 345 Park Ave.\n\nScrapping the SRG would give President Donald Trump a reason to send troops to New York to quell disturbances — and allow Republicans to take credit for bringing order to chaos, as happened in Washington, DC.\n\nDemocrats’ embrace of Mamdani will also drive moderate and center-left Jews who fear and detest his antisemitism to vote for the GOP next year, including for Hochul’s likely general-election challenger, Rep. Elise Stefanik.\n\nThey have nowhere else to go. \n\n(Remember, Nassau County is about twice as Jewish as the Big Apple, which itself is home to more Jews than any other city in the world.)\n\nHow can Jews stand behind a party that’s championing someone who’s repeatedly refused to condemn globalizing the intifada?\n\nIs it now suddenly OK for Democrats to back arresting Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu?\n\nLittle wonder pro-Israel House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer are still holding out on their endorsements.\n\nFearing for their safety, New Yorkers might move to other states, accelerating the outmigration that already threatens to cost New York up to three House seats in the 2030 redistricting.\n\nThey’ll join others who’ll avoid the state in the face of new taxes on the wealthy.\n\nHeastie said last week that he’d push to raise taxes for Mamdani’s agenda, calling millionaire taxes “popular.”\n\nBy Democrats’ new logic, they expect to win elections by raising taxes.\n\nAs fiscal expert E.J. McMahon and the Citizens Budget Commission have shown, however, an increasing share of the nation’s millionaires have already made their home outside of New York.\n\nWith a projected $34.3 billion state budget gap through 2029, Albany is also going to feel the pinch when New York’s biggest taxpayers bail.\n\nJacobs, Suozzi and Gillen prove that it wasn’t necessary for the state’s top brass to back Mamdani after he won a closed primary with about 32% voter turnout.\n\nAfter all, he didn’t endorse Joe Biden or Kamala Harris last year. \n\nState Dems could have reciprocated the cold shoulder.\n\nInstead, Mamdani’s record will be tied to his endorsers.\n\nHochul, in particular, has ceded her chance to be the adult in the room with Mamdani.\n\nShe could’ve ensured that the city is still governed responsibly and its residents are safe.\n\nIf Mamdani wins in November, there’s little to prevent him from making the state a bellwether for democratic socialism nationwide.\n\nBut Americans as a whole aren’t going to embrace his radical agenda like New York City and its leaders have.\n\nThey’ll make it known at the ballot box.\n\nJohn Ketcham is director of cities and a legal policy fellow at the Manhattan Institute.

The plaintiffs, meanwhile, say the policy violates the rights of transgender and nonbinary Americans.\n\nThe State Department changed its passport rules after Trump, a Republican, handed down an executive order in January declaring the United States would “recognize two sexes, male and female,” based on what it called “an individual’s immutable biological classification.”\n\nTransgender actor Hunter Schafer, for example, said in February that her new passport had been issued with a male gender marker, even though she submitted the application with the female gender marker she’s used for years on her driver’s license and passport.\n\nA judge blocked the Trump administration policy in June after a lawsuit from nonbinary and transgender people, some of whom said they were afraid to submit applications. An appeals court left the judge’s order in place.\n\nThe Trump administration on Friday asked the Supreme Court to put the order on hold while the lawsuit plays out.\n\n“The Constitution does not prohibit the government from defining sex in terms of an individual’s biological classification,” Solicitor General D. John Sauer wrote.\n\nHe pointed to the high court’s recent ruling upholding a ban on transition-related health care for transgender minors. The courts conservative majority found that law doesn’t discriminate on the basis of sex, and Sauer argued that finding also supports the Trump administration’s decision to change passport rules issued in 2021.\n\nAn attorney for the plaintiffs, on the other hand, said the passport rules are discriminatory.\n\n“This administration has taken escalating steps to limit transgender people’s health care, speech, and other rights under the Constitution, and we are committed to defending those rights,” said Jon Davidson, senior counsel for the LGBTQ & HIV Project at the American Civil Liberties Union.\n\n(Copyright (c) 2024 The Associated Press.

The program instead has turned into a pipeline for overseas workers who are often willing to work for as little as $60,000 annually. That is far less than $100,000-plus salaries typically paid to U.S. technology workers.\n\nTrump on Friday insisted that the tech industry would not oppose the move. “I think they’re going to be very happy,” he said.\n\nRepresentatives for the biggest tech companies, including Amazon, Apple, Google and Meta, did not immediately respond to messages for comment on Friday. Microsoft declined to comment.\n\nTrump also announced he will start selling a “gold card” visa with a potential pathway to U.S. citizenship. The “Trump Gold Card” will be available for a processing fee and a $1 million contribution after vetting. For companies, it will cost $2 million.\n\nThe “Trump Platinum Card,” meanwhile, will be available for a $5 million contribution and will allow foreigners to spend up to 270 days in the U.S. without being subject to U.S. taxes on non-U.S. income. Trump announced a $5 million gold card in February to replace an existing investor visa — this is now the platinum card.\n\nFirst lady Melania Trump, the former Melania Knauss, was granted an H-1B work visa in October 1996 to work as a model. She was born in Slovenia.\n\nThe H-1B program was created in 1990 for people with a bachelor’s degree or higher in fields where jobs are deemed hard to fill, especially science, technology, engineering and math. Critics say they allow companies to pay lower wages with fewer labor protections.\n\nHistorically, these visas — 85,000 per year — have been doled out through a lottery system. This year, Amazon was by far the top recipient of H-1B visas with more than 10,000 awarded, followed by Tata Consultancy, Microsoft, Apple and Google.\n\nGeographically, California has the highest number of H-1B workers, according to UCIS.\n\nCritics say H-1B spots often go to entry-level jobs, rather than senior positions with unique skill requirements. And while the program isn’t supposed to undercut U.S. wages or displace U.S. workers, critics say companies can pay less by classifying jobs at the lowest skill levels, even if the specific workers hired have more experience.\n\nAs a result, many U.S. companies find it cheaper simply to contract out help desks, programming and other basic tasks to consulting companies such as Wipro, Infosys, HCL Technologies and Tata in India and IBM and Cognizant in the U.S. These consulting companies hire foreign workers, often from India, and contract them out to U.S. employers looking to save money.\n\nDoug Rand, who served as the director of U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services during the Biden administration, said this amounts to a “split personality disorder” for the program, with only about half of the visas each year going to traditional companies that offer long-term employment and can put immigrants on a track to citizenship. The other half go to staffing or consulting firms — and while many are established and well-known companies, others are just one-person operations that wouldn’t exist without the H-1B program.\n\n“They’re basically entering the lottery so they can hire people that they then rent out to other larger companies doing actual work,” Rand said. “And so there’s a lot of misbehavior and chicanery in this part of the system.”\n\nIn 2024, lottery bids for the visas plunged nearly 40%, which authorities said was due to success against people who were “gaming the system” by submitting multiple, sometimes dubious, applications to unfairly increase chances of being selected.\n\nMajor technology companies that use H-1B visas sought changes after massive increases in bids left their employees and prospective hires with slimmer chances of winning the random lottery. Facing what it acknowledged was likely fraud and abuse, USCIS this year said each employee had only one shot at the lottery, whether the person had one job offer or 50.\n\nCritics welcomed the change but said more needs to be done. The AFL-CIO wrote last year that while changes to the lottery “included some steps in the right direction,” it fell short of needed reforms. The labor group wants visas awarded to companies that pay the highest wages instead of by random lottery, a change that Trump sought during his first term in the White House.\n\nOrtutay reported from Oakland, Calif.

According to US Secretary of Commerce Howard Lutnick, the initiative is designed to benefit “extraordinary people at the very top.”\nThe Trump Gold Card comes with exclusive privileges for both individuals and businesses. The official website for applications is already live, and prospective applicants can begin the process immediately. In addition to the Gold Card, the Trump administration is preparing to launch a Trump Platinum Card in the near future. This option will allow individuals to reside in the US for up to 270 days per year without being subject to tax on non-US income, and without needing a travel visa.\n\n.@POTUS signs an Executive Order to create the Gold Card visa program, facilitating expedited immigration for aliens who make significant financial gifts to the United States. pic.twitter.com/l0kMUdQh3f\n— Rapid Response 47 (@RapidResponse47) September 19, 2025\n\nWhat Is The Trump Gold Card And Who Can Apply?\nThe Trump Gold Card is a new premium immigration visa designed for individuals who can demonstrate a substantial benefit to the US. Unlike the traditional Green Card, which involves a longer and more complex path to residency, the Gold Card offers a fast-tracked route to US residency.\nTo qualify, applicants must make a $1 million “gift” to the US as part of their commitment to contributing significant value to the country. This program is intended for elite individuals, such as investors, entrepreneurs, and global influencers, who bring measurable benefit to the US economy or society.\nHow To Apply For The Trump Gold Card?\nApplicants must begin the process by paying a non-refundable processing fee. Once the fee is received, their application enters the visa adjudication process, provided all necessary supporting documents are submitted in a timely manner. The US Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) will also conduct an extensive background check. If approved, the applicant will be required to make the $1 million contribution.\nGold Card vs Corporate Gold Card vs Platinum Card: Know The Difference\nTrump Gold Card requires a $1 million contribution from individuals. Approved applicants are automatically granted US residency. Meanwhile, Trump Corporate Gold Card is designed for companies, and requires a $2 million contribution. It allows the sponsoring business to offer US residency to employees.\nThese cards are transferable within the organisation upon payment of a transfer fee and Department of Homeland Security (DHS) clearance. An annual maintenance fee applies.\nTrump Platinum Card is set to launch soon, and demands a $5 million contribution. It allows individuals to reside in the US for up to 270 days per year without being subject to tax on global income, and without requiring a visa.","summary":"The Trump Gold Card and Corporate Gold Card comes with exclusive privileges for both individuals and businesses, respectively.","url":"https://www.news18.com/world/trump-gold-card-is-here-know-application-fees-eligibility-and-how-to-apply-aa-ws-l-9584563.html","image":"https://images.news18.com/ibnlive/uploads/2025/09/Untitled-design-3-2025-09-4e9b127862fdc7df4a3fd9225ebefb6a.png","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-09-19 23:11:48","author":"New.storytailors,News18,World Desk","authors":["New.storytailors","News18","World Desk"],"language":"en","source_country":"in","sentiment":0.299},{"id":361937934,"title":"Penny Lancaster, 54, opens up on marriage to Sir Rod Stewart, 80, as she declares: 'I'm on the oldest person Rod's ever slept with!'","text":"Kim Kardashian\n\nVictoria Beckham\n\nHarry Styles\n\nAmanda Holden\n\nBritain's Got Talent\n\nPrivacy Policy\n\nFriday, Sep 19th 2025\n\n5-Day Forecast\n\nAdvertisement\n\nInside Britain's deportation flight fiasco: Colouring books, 'treats' and violence - whistleblower guards reveal all to SUE REID\n\nFashion's nastiest split: Net-a-Porter founder's indulgent life implodes as she goes to war with ex... with insiders comparing them to Johnny Depp and Amber Heard\n\nMan 'climbs out' hot air balloon and falls to his death: Tragedy as body is found hours later in sleepy village\n\nWilliam's had a rotten 18 months.

My pocket rocket (love heart emoji).'\nPete and Love Island star Maura were first linked in August last year, but the former couple went their separate ways in February, and Maura was later seen kissing McFly's Danny Jones at the BRITs.\nAt the time, Pete distanced himself from the drama this caused by going on his already planned luxury holiday to Dubai.\nA source told the Daily Mail: 'Pete has moved on and couldn't care less about Maura. He feels indifferent about the drama currently surrounding her.\n'He is focusing on himself and enjoying a break in the sun before getting back into work.'\nJowita PrzystalLondonPete WicksMaura Higgins\n\nShare or comment on this article: \nPete Wicks and Jowita Przystal confirm romance as they share a passionate kiss on stage after months of relationship rumours\n\nAdd comment\n\nComments 13\n\n Share what you think\n\nWorst rated\n\nThe comments below have not been moderated.\n\nThe views expressed in the contents above are those of our users and do not necessarily reflect the views of MailOnline.\n\nAdd your comment\n\nEnter your comment\n\nBy posting your comment you agree to our house rules.\n\nSubmit Comment\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual.\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual\n\nWe will automatically post your comment and a link to the news story to your Facebook timeline at the same time it is posted on MailOnline.

The action aims to curb the overuse of the program, allowing companies to bring in only “highly skilled” workers from other countries. The Trump administration believes that this move will create and protect jobs for US workers. White House Staff Secretary Will Scharf emphasised that the proclamation will ensure that companies bring very high-skilled workers who are not replaceable by American workers.“One of the most abused visa systems is the H1-B non-immigrant visa programme. This is supposed to allow highly skilled labourers who work in fields that Americans don’t work in to come into the United States of America. What this proclamation will do is raise the fee that companies pay to sponsor H-1B applicants to $100,000. This will ensure that the people they’re bringing in are actually very highly skilled and that they’re not replaceable by American workers,” he said. The H-1B is a non-immigrant visa which allows US-based companies to hire and employ foreign workers for speciality jobs like science, technology, engineering, mathematics (STEM), and IT (High skills and at least a bachelor’s degree).United States Secretary of Commerce, Howard Lutnick, said, “The whole idea is that no more will these big tech companies or other big companies train foreign workers. They have to pay the government $100,000, then they have to pay the employee. So it’s just not economic. If you’re going to train somebody, you’re going to train one of the recent graduates from one of the great universities across our land, train Americans, stop bringing in people to take our jobs. That’s the policy here. All of the big companies are on board.”The move marks the latest in a series of efforts from the administration to crack down on immigration and could significantly impact industries that depend heavily on H-1B workers.People born in India are the largest beneficiaries, accounting for more than 70% of all approved H-1B petitions annually since 2015.Earlier, Florida’s Governor Ron DeSantis slammed the H-1B visa program, calling it a “total scam” and arguing that it allows companies to replace American workers with foreign labour.During an interview on Fox News on Wednesday (local time), he claimed that companies often train American workers alongside H-1B visa holders, only to lay off the Americans and hire the foreign workers. DeSantis added that this practice is unacceptable and hurts American workers.United States Secretary of Commerce Howard Lutnick also criticised the current H1B visa system, calling it a scam.In a post on X, he said, “The current H1B visa system is a scam that lets foreign workers fill American job opportunities. Hiring American workers should be the priority of all great American businesses. Now is the time to hire American.” (ANI)","summary":"","url":"https://www.news18.com/agency-feeds/trump-imposes-100000-application-fee-on-h-1b-visa-9584561.html","image":"https://images.news18.com/ibnlive/uploads/2025/05/News18_India_Section_Default_Image_1600x900-2025-05-b4faf46d67a95708181b01e36cf20c4b.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-09-19 23:00:02","author":"News18","authors":["News18"],"language":"en","source_country":"in","sentiment":-0.296},{"id":361934940,"title":"NATO warplanes intercept Putin's jets over Estonia, while Russian fighters buzz Polish oil rig after drone incursion - as ex-RAF chief calls for a 'lethal' and 'ruthless' response to incursions","text":"Russia flew three fighter jets into neighbouring Estonia today in a 'reckless' and 'brazen' attempt to intimidate the Baltic state.\n\nThe powerful MiG-31 warplanes spent 12 minutes violating Estonian airspace as they conducted combat operations to test the country's defences.\n\nThe move sparked an emergency response from Nato, which sent in F-35 fighters to intercept the Russian aggression.\n\nIn further provocation by Vladimir Putin, two Russian jets also made a show of force over a Polish oil platform in the Baltic Sea, breaching its safety zone.\n\nIt comes as a former RAF commander last night called on Nato to draw a 'red line' in the sand - and hinted at shooting down future Russian jets. \n\nAir Marshal Greg Bagwell wrote on social media platform X: 'NATO needs to make some clear and public statements as to what it considers a red line.'\n\nThe veteran, who served in the force for 36 years and retired as its deputy commander, continued: 'When it is crossed, the promised response is given, which should be lethal force after a clear warning.\n\n'NATO has to be united now, with a clear and unequivocal statement about what will not be tolerated. \n\n'Right now we don't know where our red lines are, why should we expect Russia to? And if that red line is crossed then the response must be decisive and ruthless.' \n\nIt came as MI6 chief Sir Richard Moore blasted the Russian president, calling him a 'liar' who wants to 'impose his imperial will by all means at his disposal'.\n\nThe breach was condemned by European leaders. A Nato spokesman said: 'This is yet another example of reckless Russian behaviour and Nato's ability to respond.'\n\nEstonian foreign minister, Margus Tsahkna, said Russia had already entered Estonian airspace four times this year.\n\nHe added: 'That is unacceptable in itself, but today's violation, during which three fighter jets entered our airspace, is unprecedentedly brazen. Russia's ever-increasing testing of borders and aggressiveness must be responded to by rapidly strengthening political and economic pressure.'\n\nThe prime minister of Estonia, Kristen Michal, said his government had 'decided to request Nato Article 4 consultations'. \n\nArticle 4 is a call to the 32-member Nato alliance, including the US, to come to consult on collective defence in response to specific threats.\n\nThe RAF's Mr Bagwell called the Russian incursion into Estonia 'a deliberate provocation to sow doubt and confusion amongst Nato nations'. \n\n'Today these aircraft were only armed with air-to-air missiles but tomorrow it could be something more sinister,' he warned. \n\n'Putin could have a few objectives here: one) to provoke a response in order to support his argument that Nato is the aggressor; two) to sow discord amongst Nato nations in formulating a response; three) to push the boundaries of the 'grey zone'. Of course he could be trying all three!' \n\nThe air marshal, who oversaw operations in Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya and Syria, continued: 'The grey zone has become a convenient term to hide all manner of \"ills\". \n\n'We need to turn that zone into a clear delineation of black and white - and act accordingly when that line is crossed. It's time to stop Putin calling the shots.'\n\nIt comes a week after Kremlin drones flew more than 100 miles inside Poland on a reconnaissance mission. Both incidents have exposed holes in Nato defences.\n\nEstonia became the third member state to be 'invaded' by Russia in just a month after an incursion into Romanian aerial territory last weekend.\n\nThe latest incident comes after US President Donald Trump said Vladimir Putin had 'really let him down' over Ukraine.\n\nWhile the incursions into Poland and Romania were by drones, this time Russia sent manned frontline jets bristling with weapons.\n\nItalian F-35s were scrambled to intercept the MiG-31s which then returned to Kremlin airspace. They had encroached five miles inside Estonia. \n\nAfterwards, Estonia summoned Russian officials in Tallinn for an explanation. The Russian charge d'affaires was summoned and given a protest note, a ministry statement said.\n\nThe Russian MiG-31 fighters entered Estonian airspace in the area of Vaindloo Island, located in the Gulf of Finland in the Baltic Sea. The aircraft did not have flight plans and their transponders were turned off, according to Estonian officials.\n\nSeparately, Russian planes flew parallel to the Estonian border from east to west and did not head toward the country's capital Tallinn. \n\nIn another intimidating move today, two Russian jets conducted a low pass over the Polish-owned Petrobaltic offshore production facility in the Baltic. Polish armed forces were alerted as the platform's safety zone was violated.\n\nOther alliance countries have reported similar incursions and drone crashes on their territory. The developments have increasingly rattled European governments as US-led efforts to stop the war in Ukraine have come to nothing.\n\nEstonia, along with other Baltic states Lithuania and Latvia, are seen as being among the most likely targets if Russia one day decides to risk an attack on Nato. \n\nNeighbouring Poland, though much larger, also feels vulnerable. All four countries are staunch supporters of Ukraine.\n\nThe European Union's foreign policy chief, Kaja Kallas, called Friday's incursion 'an extremely dangerous provocation' that 'further escalates tensions in the region'.\n\nMs Kallas, who is Estonian, said the EU will 'continue to support our member states in strengthening their defences with European resources.' She added that Putin was 'testing the West's resolve' and said 'we must not show weakness'.\n\nLithuanian defence minister Dovile Sakaliene said Nato's border in the north east of Europe was being tested 'for a reason'. She added: 'We need to mean business.'\n\nFormer Lithuanian foreign minister Gabrielius Landsbergis also weighed in on the row.\n\nHe said: 'Russia escalates, we do nothing, Russia escalates more, we do nothing, Russia escalates even more, we do nothing... I think I am starting to see a pattern here.'\n\nUkraine President Volodymyr Zelensky described the menace as 'outrageous' and insisted it was 'not an accident'.\n\nHe added: 'It requires a systemic response. Strong action must be taken – both collectively and individually by each nation.\n\nForeign Secretary Yvette Cooper posted on social media that the UK 'stands with our Estonian allies'. \n\nThe Kremlin has not commented on the incident.","summary":"The powerful warplanes spent 12 minutes violating Estonian airspace as they conducted operations to test the country's defences.

Because when you fall down that cliff, down there, there is no democracy. We have to be very, very careful. I think it's very important that we turn this around and that we show people power. \n\n\"Because the people can turn this around, the people have the ultimate power.\"\n\nOne longtime Republican strategist claimed: \"Arnold has been telling people close to him that he can't just sit back and watch Trump bulldoze democracy. He knows the Constitution bars him from running for the presidency, but he's desperate to find a path – whether that's lobbying for reform or using his star power to rally voters against Trump.\" \n\nSchwarzenegger has described Kirk's death as \"unbelievable\" and a chilling sign of how far the nation has fallen.\"I was very, very upset that someone's life has was taken because they have a different opinion,\" he said. \"This was a great communicator, a great advocate for the right, for Republican causes. He had such a great way of communicating with the students who agreed or disagreed with him. \n\n\"And he was a great father, a great husband. I was thinking about his children. They will only be reading about him now, instead of him reading to them bedtime stories.\"\n\nThe gunman suspect, Tyler Robinson, 22, has been charged with aggravated murder. Schwarzenegger linked the killing to toxic divisions fueled online and in politics.Trump Fails To Unite Country\"We have to acknowledge that the cause of all this is the social media companies that are dividing us, the mainstream media companies that are dividing us. The political parties: the Democrats that are dividing us, the Republicans that are dividing us,\" he added. \n\n\"We're getting hit from so many different angles, and we have to be very careful that we don’t get closer to that cliff.\"\n\nTrump, 79, dismissed concerns about rising tensions across the nation in the wake of Kirk's execution, saying on Fox and Friends: \"I tell you something that is going to get me in trouble, but I couldn't care less. The radicals on the right are radical because they don't want to see crime. \n\n\"The radicals on the left are the problem – and they are vicious and horrible and politically savvy. They want men in women's sports, they want transgender for everyone, they want open borders – the worst thing that happened to this country.\"Would Schwarzenegger Win?Austrian native Schwarzenegger, who previously told CNN's Chris Wallace in 2023 he could \"so clearly\" win the presidency if allowed to run, remains blocked by the Constitution's natural-born citizen clause. But advisers insist this has not stopped him from floating the idea.\n\nA former aide claimed: \"He feels uniquely qualified to bring Americans together at a time when it's all about who you vote against rather than who you vote for. \"He's been telling people, 'If I can't run, then maybe I can at least inspire someone else who can beat Trump.'\"\n\nThough he insists he is \"not worried\" about Trump ultimately prevailing, Schwarzenegger has been clear about the stakes. \n\nHe added to Wallace: \"Look, it's a no-brainer.

The Independent understands the report leaked to the Times of Israel is an earlier draft of what is currently on the table. \n\nIt proposes creating a new body named the Gaza International Transitional Authority (Gita) which will govern Gaza during a transitional period, eventually handing over control to the PA. \n\nGita would be established via a UN Security Council resolution and would be governed by a board of 7–10 members, including at least one qualified Palestinian, a senior UN official, international figures with financial experience, as well as “strong representation of Muslim members”. \n\nPrevious reporting had linked Sir Tony’s initiative to the forcible displacement of Palestinians from Gaza, leaving the enclave open for international property development.\n\nBut sources told The Independent that the institute would not support or endorse any proposal that involves the transfer of Palestinians.\n\nIn the leaks published by The Times, the proposal envisions the establishment of a Property Rights Preservation Unit, “aimed at ensuring that any voluntary departure of Gazans does not compromise their right to return to the enclave or retain property ownership”.\n\nThe proposal reportedly also includes the creation of an multinational stabilisation force under international mandate that would aim to ensure border integrity, deter the resurgence of armed groups, protect humanitarian operations, and support – but not replace – local law enforcement in Gaza.\n\nThe Independent understands Hamas would not be part of either the transitional or future government of Gaza, which, again, is a key demand of the militant group. \n\nSir Tony and his team at the Tony Blair Institute for Global Change will face an uphill battle getting the extreme-right members of Israel’s cabinet on board.\n\nIsraeli’s prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu has repeatedly said “there will be no Palestinian state”. Last week he declared “this place belongs to us” as he signed a controversial plan for the massive expansion of Israeli settlements, which are illegal under international law, in the occupied West Bank.\n\nOn Wednesday, far-right finance minister Bezalel Smotrich told a conference in Tel Aviv that he was already in talks with the US about dividing up Gaza. The Strip is home to over 2 million people and largely laid to waste by Israel’s unprecedented two-year bombardment.\n\nMr Smotrich promised a “real estate bonanza” in the 25-mile-long enclave, adding that since Israel “paid a lot” for the war and needs to make a “percentage on the land marketing”.\n\n“We’ve done the demolition… now we need to build,” he said.\n\nThe Blair plan is said to be anchored on the dismantling of Hamas, and lays out a transitional administration for Gaza, in which the Palestinian Authority would have a role, albeit a diminished one at the start.\n\nThat was roundly rejected by Hamas officials, who told The Independent on Friday they had not seen the proposal. \n\n“No party has the right to dismantle any Palestinian faction. The one that needs to be dismantled is the occupation,” the official said anonymously, adding that Palestinians would not accept a deal they had not voted on or been consulted about.\n\n“We will not allow the Palestinians to have anything dictated to them against their will,” he said.\n\nDr Omar Awadallah, the deputy foreign minister for the rival PA which is anchored in the West Bank , told The Independent it had yet to see a draft of the Blair proposal. \n\n“We are ready to engage in good faith,” he said. “But Gaza is an integral part of the State of Palestine. We will not accept any plan that talks about Gaza as a real estate or financial investment for foreign companies where Palestinians are not present.\n\n“The only hope is our people and international law. Any plan that isn’t based on that is null and void.”\n\nFrustrated by the lack of progress with ceasefire talks, President Trump was reportedly briefed back in August on ideas for a post-war Gaza by Sir Tony and Mr Trump’s son-in-law and former Middle East envoy Jared Kushner – who has penned previous proposals for the region.\n\nSo far, the US president has suggested a myriad of sometimes contradictory visions for the besieged enclave, where more than 90 per cent of the population has been displaced, famine stalks the population and a UN commission of inquiry has said Israel has committed genocide. \n\nMr Trump at one point even suggested an American takeover of the strip using US troops as a way to bring an end to the war. In February, he posted an AI-generated video depicting a post-war Gaza as a lavish tourist destination complete with a Trump tower.\n\nIn the same month, he also suggested Palestinians could be relocated to one large or multiple smaller sites.\n\nHe later walked this back and is said to support Sir Tony’s vision and is even, according to the Times of Israel, tasking him with getting regional stakeholders on board.\n\nDr Awadallah said Palestinian authorities had discussed a similar initiative of a “stabilisation mission” earlier this year in a meeting in in New York. \n\nBut he said it could only be adopted if it came into being via an official request from the Palestinian government and a UN Security Council resolution.\n\n“The stabilisation mission would aim to support us in governance and stability, not to substitute us,” he said, adding: “We are ready to engage in good faith.”\n\nThe Blair proposal would also need to secure the support of nations bordering Israel. \n\nEgypt is reportedly already on high alert, as Mr Netanyahu has pushed ahead with his controversial, widened offensive on Gaza City, with Arabic media reporting that Egyptian armed forces fear the possibility of Palestinians crossing into Sinai.\n\nA Jordanian government source told The Independent that they had not seen a copy of the plan yet – but a key red line was the displacement of Palestinians.\n\nThey also said they would reject any “boots on the ground” in Gaza unless formally requested by a Palestinian government body – and that it would be unlikely to involve Jordanian troops.","summary":"The proposal has yet to be shared with regional actors and its central premise may not be accepted by Israel","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/middle-east/gaza-trump-tony-blair-plan-israel-b2830043.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/09/19/13/09/PALESTINIAN-ISRAEL-CONFLICT-i72nd5rc.jpeg?crop=5760,3840,x0,y0&trim=0,0,0,0&width=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/PfdCFdwL-OhrQWqOm.mp4","publish_date":"2025-09-19 22:42:00","author":"Bel Trew","authors":["Bel Trew"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":0.103},{"id":361943568,"title":"Alex Acosta Finally Reveals Why He Offered Plea Deal To Epstein","text":"Former U.S. Department of Labor Secretary Alex Acosta revealed to the House Oversight Committee why he offered a plea deal to Jeffrey Epstein, according to a press release.\n\nAcosta, who previously served as U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of Florida, testified before the committee Friday on his part in Epstein’s 2008 plea deal.

The program instead has turned into a pipeline for overseas workers who are often willing to work for as little as $60,000 annually. That is far less than $100,000-plus salaries typically paid to U.S. technology workers.\n\nTrump on Friday insisted that the tech industry would not oppose the move. “I think they’re going to be very happy,” he said.\n\nRepresentatives for the biggest tech companies, including Amazon, Apple, Google and Meta, did not immediately respond to messages for comment on Friday. Microsoft declined to comment.\n\nTrump also announced he will start selling a “gold card” visa with a potential pathway to U.S. citizenship. The “Trump Gold Card” will be available for a processing fee and a $1 million contribution after vetting. For companies, it will cost $2 million. The “Trump Platinum Card,” meanwhile, will be available for a $5 million contribution and will allow foreigners to spend up to 270 days in the U.S. without being subject to U.S. taxes on non-U.S. income. Trump announced a $5 million gold card in February to replace an existing investor visa — this is now the platinum card.\n\nFirst lady Melania Trump, the former Melania Knauss, was granted an H-1B work visa in October 1996 to work as a model. She was born in Slovenia.\n\nThe H-1B program was created in 1990 for people with a bachelor’s degree or higher in fields where jobs are deemed hard to fill, especially science, technology, engineering and math. Critics say they allow companies to pay lower wages with fewer labor protections.\n\nHistorically, these visas — 85,000 per year — have been doled out through a lottery system. This year, Amazon was by far the top recipient of H-1B visas with more than 10,000 awarded, followed by Tata Consultancy, Microsoft, Apple and Google. Geographically, California has the highest number of H-1B workers, according to UCIS.\n\nCritics say H-1B spots often go to entry-level jobs, rather than senior positions with unique skill requirements. And while the program isn’t supposed to undercut U.S. wages or displace U.S. workers, critics say companies can pay less by classifying jobs at the lowest skill levels, even if the specific workers hired have more experience.\n\nAs a result, many U.S. companies find it cheaper simply to contract out help desks, programming and other basic tasks to consulting companies such as Wipro, Infosys, HCL Technologies and Tata in India and IBM and Cognizant in the U.S. These consulting companies hire foreign workers, often from India, and contract them out to U.S. employers looking to save money.\n\nDoug Rand, who served as the director of U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services during the Biden administration, said this amounts to a “split personality disorder” for the program, with only about half of the visas each year going to traditional companies that offer long-term employment and can put immigrants on a track to citizenship. The other half go to staffing or consulting firms — and while many are established and well-known companies, others are just one-person operations that wouldn’t exist without the H-1B program.\n\n“They’re basically entering the lottery so they can hire people that they then rent out to other larger companies doing actual work,” Rand said. “And so there’s a lot of misbehavior and chicanery in this part of the system.”\n\nIn 2024, lottery bids for the visas plunged nearly 40%, which authorities said was due to success against people who were “gaming the system” by submitting multiple, sometimes dubious, applications to unfairly increase chances of being selected.\n\nMajor technology companies that use H-1B visas sought changes after massive increases in bids left their employees and prospective hires with slimmer chances of winning the random lottery. Facing what it acknowledged was likely fraud and abuse, USCIS this year said each employee had only one shot at the lottery, whether the person had one job offer or 50.\n\nCritics welcomed the change but said more needs to be done. The AFL-CIO wrote last year that while changes to the lottery “included some steps in the right direction,” it fell short of needed reforms. The labor group wants visas awarded to companies that pay the highest wages instead of by random lottery, a change that Trump sought during his first term in the White House.\n\nOrtutay reported from Oakland, Calif.

The projects now face uncertain futures under Trump.\n\nLast week, the Interior Department asked a federal judge in Baltimore to cancel a previous approval by BOEM to build an offshore wind project in Maryland. The ocean agency has concluded that its prior weighing of the project’s impacts was “deficient” and intends to reconsider that analysis to make a new decision, the department said.\n\nDeveloper U.S. Wind has not yet begun construction, but plans for the Maryland Offshore Wind Project call for up to 114 turbines to power more than 718,000 homes.\n\nBOEM had approved SouthCoast’s operations plan on Jan. 17, 2025, three days before Trump’s second term began.\n\n“Based on its review to date, BOEM has determined that the COP approval may not have fully complied with the law” and “may have failed to account for all the impacts that the SouthCoast Wind Project may cause,” Interior said in its legal filing. The agency asked a federal judge to allow reconsideration of the project.\n\nIn a statement, developer Ocean Winds said the company “intends to vigorously defend our permits in federal court.”\n\n“Stable permitting for American infrastructure projects should be of top concern for anyone who wants to see continued investment in the United States,” the statement said.\n\nJason Walsh, executive director of the BlueGreen Alliance, a coalition of labor unions and environmental groups, said Trump “is threatening good jobs while he pursues his senseless vendetta against offshore wind.”\n\nPulling energy project permits and canceling lease sales isn’t new. Biden revoked the permit to build the long-disputed Keystone XL oil pipeline on his first day in office, halting construction. He canceled scheduled oil and gas lease sales.\n\nBut Trump’s efforts to dismantle the offshore wind industry are much more extensive than the way Biden targeted fossil fuels, said Kristoffer Svendsen, assistant dean for energy law at the George Washington University Law School. He thinks offshore wind developers will now see the U.S. as too risky.\n\n“They have plenty of options. They can invest in Europe and Asia. There are good markets to invest in offshore wind. It’s just the U.S. is not a good market to invest in,” he said.\n\nThe Trump administration has stopped construction on two major offshore wind farms, so far. One of them, the Empire Wind project for New York, was allowed to resume construction. The Revolution Wind project for Rhode Island and Connecticut is paused, and both the developer and the two states sued in federal courts.\n\nThe Danish energy company Orsted is building Revolution Wind. The Danish government owns a majority stake in the company.\n\nBesides SouthCoast, the Trump administration has said it is reconsidering approvals for another wind farm off the Massachusetts coast, New England Wind. It previously revoked a permit for the Atlantic Shores project in New Jersey.\n\nThe Associated Press’ climate and environmental coverage receives financial support from multiple private foundations.

Reuters previously reported that the two sides were planning such a meeting.\n\n“He approved the TikTok deal,” Trump told reporters in the Oval Office, adding that there could remain a formal signing of the agreement. “The TikTok deal is well on its way.”\n\nTrump also suggested positive movement on trade, fentanyl and the Russia-Ukraine war during the call, which he said lasted for about two hours.\n\n“I believe he would like to see it ended,” Trump said of Xi’s view of the Russia-Ukraine war.\n\nBeijing’s final approval of a framework deal reached by the two sides earlier this week is one of the hurdles Trump needed to clear to keep TikTok open. Congress had ordered the app shut down for U.S. users by January 2025 if its U.S. assets weren’t sold by Chinese owner ByteDance.\n\nChina’s statement made no reference to a formal agreement on TikTok. Trump had signaled multiple times this week that a deal might be forthcoming.\n\n“China’s position on the TikTok issue is clear: The Chinese government respects the wishes of the company in question,” the government said in a statement that called for non-discriminatory treatment of its companies.\n\n“The U.S. will work with China on the economy and trade, and support their teams in reaching a proper deal on TikTok through consultation.”\n\nThe White House and the Chinese government did not immediately respond to requests for further comment.\n\n“Beijing is banking on optics and time, while Washington is chasing a TikTok headline and a summit, and hopes, I think, for more wins later,” said Craig Singleton, a senior fellow at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, a think tank. “I think the Chinese are very happy with the current dynamic.”\n\nTrump has declined to enforce the TikTok law while his administration looks for a new owner, but also because he worries a ban on the app would anger TikTok’s huge user base and disrupt political communications.\n\nKey questions about the deal remain. They include the precise ownership structure of the company, how much control China will retain over the app’s inner workings, what concessions Trump will demand from the parties involved or whether Congress will approve.\n\n“It’s all being worked out,” Trump told reporters, responding to a question over whether the United States or China would have control over the app’s algorithm. “We’re going to have very tight control.”\n\nAsked whether the U.S. government would control a board seat, Trump said, “We’re going to announce it.”\n\nHe also floated the possibility that the U.S. government might take a fee for helping broker a deal to keep TikTok online, but added that such a provision “hasn’t been fully negotiated.” The Wall Street Journal has reported it would be a multibillion-dollar fee.\n\nThe deal would transfer TikTok’s U.S. assets to U.S. owners from ByteDance, Reuters has reported. Sources familiar with the deal said U.S. TikTok would still make use of ByteDance’s algorithm. That arrangement worries lawmakers who think Beijing could spy on Americans or conduct influence operations through the app. China has said there is no evidence of a threat posed by the app.\n\nSince retaking office in January, Trump has sharply hiked tariffs across the board and singled out China’s export-oriented economy with especially punitive rates. That prompted China to respond in kind. Tariff rates on both sides of the Pacific rose to triple-digit percentages in April.\n\nA succession of limited agreements since May paused the tit-for-tat tariff war between the countries. Taxes on U.S. importers have been a key plank of Trump’s economic policy. He’s raised them to the highest levels in nearly a century while positioning his foreign policy approach as one of peace-seeking and deal-making.\n\nThe Republican has portrayed tariffs as a way to recoup lost manufacturing jobs, cut chronic federal government deficits, correct perceived trade imbalances and bend foreign countries to Washington’s will. Many economists regard across-the-board tariffs as inefficient, raising consumer prices and limiting their choices.\n\nDespite the tariffs, China remains America’s third-largest trading partner and the source of its largest bilateral trade deficit in goods. Recent data point to slowing economies in both China and the United States.\n\nTrump has threatened but so far withheld punitive tariffs against Chinese exports related to the country’s purchases of Russian oil. At the same time, regional worries are multiplying over Taiwan and the South China Sea, risky flashpoints that struggle to command as much attention in Washington as the Russia-Ukraine and Gaza wars. Neither country’s statements following the call mentioned Taiwan.\n\nOther key issues include U.S. demands that China crack down on the export of fentanyl-related chemicals, a cause of U.S. overdose deaths. Beijing has accused Washington of distorting the issue.","summary":"WASHINGTON >> President Donald Trump said he and Chinese President Xi Jinping made progress on a TikTok agreement and would meet face-to-face in six weeks in South Korea to discuss trade, illicit drugs and Russia&#8217;s war in Ukraine.","url":"https://www.staradvertiser.com/2025/09/19/breaking-news/trump-xi-discuss-tiktok-deal-plan-to-meet-in-south-korea/","image":"https://www.staradvertiser.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/web1_2025-06-02T212812Z_1213227969_RC2KUEADEX07_RTRMADP_3_USA-TRUMP-TARIFFS-CALL.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-09-19 22:37:00","author":"Reuters","authors":["Reuters"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.476},{"id":361947184,"title":"Trump says Xi Jinping has agreed to approve TikTok deal, but details unclear","text":"Donald Trump said on Friday that he and Xi Jinping had agreed to approve a deal over TikTok.\n\n“He approved the TikTok deal,” Trump said about Xi to reporters in the Oval Office, suggesting the leaders signed off on a preliminary agreement. But Trump offered no details about the agreement or when it would be signed.\n\nThe American and Chinese leaders had connected over a phone call earlier in the day, the first direct contact between the two leaders since June. China and the US have been at loggerheads over trade negotiations and the future of TikTok, a Chinese-owned social media platform that faces a ban in the US.\n\nTrump had said earlier this week that Washington and Beijing had agreed a deal on TikTok under which it would be transferred to US control, but details of the framework have been scant, and elements reportedly remain to be hashed out. Investors including the US software giant Oracle have been in talks to take a large stake in TikTok’s US operations, which would dilute the amount of China-based ownership to comply with a law Congress passed last year.\n\nThe Wall Street Journal reported on Friday that investors in the TikTok deal would pay the US a fee in exchange for negotiating the agreement with China.\n\nIn the call on Friday, the Chinese president “emphasised the vital importance of US-China relations”, according to a Chinese readout of Friday’s phone call.\n\n“China’s position on the TikTok issue is clear,” the readout said. “The Chinese government respects the wishes of companies and welcomes them to conduct commercial negotiations based on market rules and reach solutions that comply with Chinese laws and regulations and balance interests. China hopes that the US will provide an open, fair and non-discriminatory business environment for Chinese companies to invest in the US.”\n\nChina described the call as “pragmatic, positive, and constructive”.\n\nIn a post on Truth Social, Trump described the call as “very productive”. “We made progress on many very important issues including Trade, Fentanyl, the need to bring the War between Russia and Ukraine to an end, and the approval of the TikTok Deal,” Trump wrote.\n\nHe said he and Xi would meet at the Asia-Pacificeconomic cooperation summit in South Korea in late October and he would visit China “in the early part of next year”. China has not commented on when Trump and Xi might meet in person.\n\nThe TikTok deal was negotiated this week in Madrid, where the US treasury secretary, Scott Bessent, and the Chinese vice-premier He Lifeng met to negotiate a trade deal. The US and China have agreed to a temporary pause in the trade war and the deadline to reach an agreement is 10 November.\n\nThe call came as Trump returned from a state visit to the UK, which was accompanied by news of a multibillion-dollar investment deal for US tech companies in the UK. Microsoft will invest $30bn while Nvidia will invest £11bn.\n\nUS tech companies have been caught in the cross-hairs of the US-China trade war. This week it was reported that China had ordered its top tech firms to stop buying semiconductors from Nvidia, which makes the world’s most advanced chips. Nvidia’s most high-end models are already banned by the US from being exported to China, but it had developed less sophisticated chips specifically for the Chinese market.\n\nThe Chinese readout of the call said Trump had praised Beijing’s recent military parade – the biggest showcase of military might in decades – as “magnificent”. The second world war commemoration parade, which was attended by Vladimir Putin and Kim Jong-un, was widely seen in the west as being a show of unity from an anti-American bloc.\n\nHowever, China has been keen to stress its cooperation with the allied forces in the second world war. According to the readout, Xi on Friday “pointed out that China and the United States were allies who fought side by side during world war two”.\n\nChina described US-China ties as “the most important bilateral relationship in the world”.","summary":"Trump’s statement suggests preliminary agreement between leaders in the first direct contact between them since June\n\nDonald Trump said on Friday that he and Xi Jinping had agreed to approve a deal over TikTok.\n\n“He approved the TikTok deal,” Trump said about Xi to reporters in the Oval Office, suggesting the leaders signed off on a preliminary agreement.

It struck a deal with unions to cut 35,000 jobs by 2030 at its namesake VW brand in Germany as it seeks to reduce costs.\nTrump's tariffs have only added to VW's headaches, with the group reporting a €3.1 billion hit from the levies in the first half of the year.\nChina, long a key source of sales, has become a fierce battleground for the carmaker as it fights back against rising competition from local rivals like BYD.\nBMW and Mercedes-Benz, as well as a host of German auto suppliers, have also been slashing costs as they struggle to keep up with a host of emerging rivals.","summary":"The German sports car maker has long struggled, particularly due to falling demand for its luxury models in China’s key market.","url":"https://www.freemalaysiatoday.com/category/business/2025/09/20/porsche-slows-electric-shift-prompting-vw-profit-warning","image":"https://www.freemalaysiatoday.com/cdn-cgi/image/quality=80,format=auto,fit=scale-down,dpr=1,width=1600,height=1000/https://media.freemalaysiatoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/56a42876-porsche-1.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-09-19 22:31:48","author":"AFP","authors":["AFP"],"language":"en","source_country":"my","sentiment":-0.235},{"id":361935024,"title":"Abigail Spanberger smells victory in Virginia in early voting kickoff event","text":"“I look forward to the next 45 days of early voting for encouraging people to use their voices in casting their vote,” Spanberger said before reminding the crowd of the early voting window. “I know that at the end of these 45 days … early voting goes until November 1st.\n\nEARLY VOTING BEGINS IN VIRGINIA ELECTIONS: WHAT TO KNOW\n\n“On November 4, I am excited about what the next chapter is, which is the part where we get to go to Richmond and we start to do the good work of governing well on behalf of all Virginians,” she continued of the Democratic ticket that includes Ghazala Hashmi, the lieutenant governor candidate, and Jay Jones, the attorney general candidate.\n\nThe Democratic candidate has consistently led Earle-Sears in polling and fundraising this year.\n\nBut Earle-Sears has recently narrowed the polling gap after a campaign shake-up over the summer that helped her campaign focus its attacks against her Democratic competitor.\n\nSpanberger has consistently tied Earle-Sears to President Donald Trump and the Department of Government Efficiency’s job cuts, which affected many Virginia residents.\n\n“We want someone to stand up for the federal workforce, our neighbors, our friends, our fellow Virginians who have lost their jobs in service to our country because of DOGE and all of the other community members, small business owners, restaurant owners who have been impacted,” Spanberger said to loud applause. \n\nSpanberger cast her vote early Friday morning in Henrico County before her Fairfax event in the afternoon. Virginia will have its first female governor if either candidate wins.\n\n“At this moment in time, I am excited about what is possible. I am excited about the fact that today, on early voting, September 19, we have brought people out to the polls all across Virginia who want to cast their ballot,” Spanberger said.\n\nAfter she cast her ballot, John Reid, the Republican lieutenant governor candidate, crashed a press gaggle and shook hands with Spanberger in a show of professionalism. \n\n“In these times, even a quick handshake goes a long way — at the end of the day, we’re all Virginians. As leaders, we can cool the temperature, ease the rhetoric, and focus on finding the best solutions for the future of our Commonwealth,” Reid wrote on X. \n\nReid is expected to attend a unity event with the Earle-Sears, Youngkin, and Vivek Ramaswamy, the former head of DOGE, on Friday night in Chesterfield, Virginia. Spanberger called on Earle-Sears to cancel the event due to Ramaswamy’s DOGE affiliation as a co-head with tech billionaire Elon Musk.\n\nThe Democratic Party of Virginia will also advertise a billboard slamming Earle-Sears for the event with Ramaswamy.\n\n“The reality is, the attacks on our federal workforce are significant. Virginia has had rising unemployment rates every single month over the past eight months,” Spanberger told reporters after her speech. “Estimates are that for 2026, we will see virtually no growth in employment numbers in Virginia. The impacts of DOGE are real.”\n\n“And Vivek Ramaswamy was the architect — original architect before, I suppose, he was DOGED by Elon Musk — the original architect of the DOGE efforts,” she added.\n\nEarle-Sears is mobilizing endorsements and GOP support during the early voting period and ahead of the Ramaswamy event.\n\n“The choice could not be more clear,” Earle-Sears wrote on social media. “My opponent will transform Virginia into something unrecognizable. I will champion the successes we have and continue commonsense, conservative policies.”\n\nTrump was asked in the Oval Office on Friday whether he’d campaign for Earle-Sears in Virginia. The president said he’d consider it.","summary":"FAIRFAX COUNTY, Va. — Virginia Democratic gubernatorial nominee Abigail Spanberger appeared confident that she would succeed Gov.
