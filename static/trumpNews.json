One of the hornets’ nests is Trump’s dismantling of the U.S. Agency for International Development. The agency, which was established in 1961, has been instrumental in providing development assistance, humanitarian aid, and supporting democratic initiatives worldwide. Its assignments include health services for HIV patients in Sub-Saharan Africa, famine relief in Latin America, and environmental conservation efforts in the Amazon. The world’s richest man, Elon Musk, was appointed by Trump to oversee the restructuring of many government agencies. Touted the ‘Prime Minister’ of the US, Musk recently announced the closure of USAID, labelling it a “criminal organisation beyond repair”.\n\nOver decades, USAID has had a significant and wide-ranging impact on Nigeria, particularly in areas like health, education, governance, agriculture, and economic development. But, has any foreign aid tangibly enhanced progress in Nigeria’s health sector, helped with the security of lives and property, assisted in advancement in education, or other significant areas of the economy? Ordinary Nigerians need no consultation with clairvoyance to determine where much of the money from foreign aid flowing into our country must have gone. Corruption has swallowed it because, in Nigeria, a snake swallows raw cash with both the snake and the money disappearing into thin air. Foreign aid often goes through the government where all of it gets pocketed by politicians before it ever has the chance to reach the people. The most important question currently, however, is this: Does Nigeria need handouts from the West?\n\nNigerian leaders across all spectra should not have any shred of difficulty meeting the economic needs of its people with abundant natural blessings all over the country. Why must an island of wealth, a trough of tintinnabulating treasures, a penstock of prosperousness, and a depository of abundant and abounding natural resources need a handout from any country? What is the business of Nigeria begging for a handout when it is the home of innumerable sages, an arsenal of intellectuals, a harbour of highbrows, and a human assemblage of geeks and deft double-domes?\n\nNigeria is the 16th largest oil producer in the world and has the 10th largest proven oil reserves with about 37 billion barrels. Iron ore, coal, tin, columbite, limestone, lead, zinc, gold, silver and more litter our land. Our fertile soil, forests, and water resources make it suitable for crops like cocoa, rubber, palm oil, and tropical fruits to grow in abundance. Significant deposits of uranium are found in some parts of the north and large deposits of Bitumen are found in the Southwestern region. Nigeria is blessed beyond measure, why living a life of dependence on handouts in foreign aid?\n\nFrom Adamawa to Bauchi; stretching down to Osun into Ekiti; and spiralling eastward to Enugu and Abia; there is no single state in Nigeria that God has not blessed with natural resources. States that some ignorant Nigerians may deride and mock them as poor and parasitic and have abundant wealth buried under their soil. The Nigerian government has identified at least 37 mineral deposits across the land. Nigeria reportedly loses about N50tn from untapped resources that are tucked away in the crevices of virtually every state of the country. About 1.5 million hectares of land in south-eastern Nigeria holds the largest deposit of coal. 2.8 billion metric tonnes of coal are ready to be mined and flipped into abundant wealth in Nigeria’s coal axis. Why must Nigeria live a life of dependence on handouts? \n\nIlesha, a city in Osun State, is sitting on huge hectares of raw gold. For many years the natural resource has remained largely untapped. In unexploited gold alone, Nigeria loses a whooping N8tn annually. The World’s second-largest deposit of bitumen is in oil-producing Ondo State. The deposit is reported to be about 42.74 billion metric tonnes. The blackish viscous liquid, a by-product from the fractional distillation of crude oil is found in Edo; Lagos; and Ogun States; but the largest chunk is in Agbagbu, Ondo State with over 42 billion reserves. Do we need to beg for handouts from anyone?\n\nColumbite is a black ore of niobium, which has a submetallic lustre and a high density. It is used as an alloy of steel to form weldable high-speed steel for radio-transmitting valves and heat-sensitive detective devices. In Plateau, Kano, Kaduna, Bauchi, Kogi, and Nasarawa States, this precious gem is found in abundant proportion. The return on investment on columbite ore is placed at 10 to 15 per cent. The commercial value of Nigeria’s solid minerals has been estimated to run into hundreds of trillions of dollars. But the money remains buried. Nigeria, without a doubt, is on God’s schedule for economic paradise because of her immense natural endowment. How the country has found itself in the Grand Canyon of the Gully and Gehena remains a shock to the world that knows the weight and worth of Nigeria’s many blessings.\n\nNigeria daily haemorrhages treasure into trash bins through many outlets. The bleeding of our treasures into waste bins must stop. Power and vision to set Nigeria loose from poverty and hunger must continue with unwavering commitment. God has given the country the resources to stave off slavery and hunger; men in authority in our country must now put their brains to work for the public good. Nigeria does not need a handout from any country.\n\nA life of dependence on handouts does not bring elevation; it gives birth to slavery and slave ownership. A handout makes a nation subservient and slavishly submissive. The Nigerian nation, in my own opinion, is a “Makarios”; the self-sufficient Island that needs no dependence on handouts.\n\nNigeria does not need handouts; we only need collaboration. Collaboration means that a party in a structured relationship has something it can add as value to other parties, and vice versa. Nigeria has a lot to offer the world. We have values to add to other nations. We are already doing that with nations around us. With collaboration, it is a win-win. But with dependence on handouts, a nation loses its esteem. Shutting down USAID in faraway America should not make any difference to Nigeria thousands of miles away. We only need to put our house in order and wise up quickly.\n\nX-@Folaojotweet","summary":"With just a few weeks into his second coming as US President; Donald Trump has stirred up plenteous hornets’ nests around the world.

Also in attendance is US Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, marking the first visit to NATO by a member of the new Trump administration.

Day 1,087.\n\nRising Turmoil Around Ukraine's Peace Talks.\n\nOutlining his stance on the ongoing war in Ukraine and the potential for a diplomatic resolution, U.S. President Donald Trump suggested on February 12 that a meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin might soon take place in Saudi Arabia. He emphasized the role of Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman in facilitating the talks in what he described as an ideal location for such negotiations. Concurrently, China has offered to help organize a U.S.-Russia summit and assist in post-conflict peacekeeping. The initiative has met skepticism in both Europe and the U.S. in view of China's ties to the Kremlin.\n\nTrump reiterated that his administration's priority remains the cessation of hostilities, with continued U.S. assistance to Ukraine contingent on securing guarantees for the financial aid provided. Trump further asserted that while some Ukrainian territories might eventually return to Kyiv's control, he deemed the goal of restoring its internationally recognized borders as impractical. In a final note on the conflict's resolution, Trump stated that Ukraine might need to make difficult concessions for peace.\n\nTrump previously disclosed that he held a \"highly productive\" phone call with Putin, announcing an agreement to initiate talks aimed at ending the war in Ukraine. Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov confirmed that the call lasted nearly 90 minutes, with Putin inviting Trump to Moscow for a future meeting. The key details of the dialogue between the U.S. and Russian leaders were not coordinated with Ukraine, raising concerns in both Kyiv and European capitals.\n\nThe call is widely viewed by Western analysts as a diplomatic victory for Putin as it signals his return to global politics after a period of isolation. This outlook might leave Brussels and Kyiv feeling sidelined, while many analysts have expressed concern that the European Union and Ukraine could be excluded from the decision-making process.\n\nMORE FOR YOU\n\nRFK Jr.’s Health Secretary Confirmation Live Updates: Senate Confirms Trump’s Pick—McConnell Votes ‘No’\n\nToday’s NYT Mini Crossword Clues And Answers For Thursday, February 13th\n\nNetflix’s Best New Show Is A Surefire Emmy Contender\n\nSources cited by the Financial Times suggest that Trump and Putin might aim for a ceasefire in Ukraine by either Easter, April 20, when both Orthodox and Catholic Christians will celebrate the holiday, or by May 9. The Kremlin has confirmed that Putin would welcome Trump in Moscow that day for celebrations marking the 80th anniversary of the defeat of Nazi Germany in World War II.\n\nU.S. Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth declared on February 12 that Ukraine's hopes for NATO membership and restoration of its pre-2014 borders are unrealistic for a peaceful resolution to the war. Speaking at the Ramstein meeting in Brussels, Hegseth stressed that President Trump seeks to end the conflict diplomatically, based on a pragmatic assessment of the battlefield. Hegseth warned that pursuing the goal of a return to pre-2014 borders would only prolong the war and suffering. Instead, he proposed a peace agreement based on solid security guarantees backed by capable European and non-European forces without invoking NATO's Article 5, which obliges all member states to defend a member under attack. Additionally, he ruled out the deployment of U.S. troops in Ukraine as part of any security measures.\n\nKyiv region. A Russian strike on February 12 in Ukraine's capital killed one civilian and wounded four others, including a child.\n\nDonetsk region. A 46-year-old man died and five residents were wounded in a Russian glide bomb strike on the city of Kramatorsk on February 13.\n\nSumy region. On February 11, Russian forces launched 97 shelling attacks along this region's border, killing two civilians and wounding two others.\n\nKherson region. Sifting through the debris of a collapsed building, rescue teams recovered the body of a woman killed in an artillery strike in the regional capital on February 12.\n\nIn a controversial move, Ukraine's National Security and Defense Council imposed sanctions on the country's ex-president, Petro Poroshenko, on February 12. The sanctions include indefinite asset freezes, trade bans, suspension of economic and financial obligations, restrictions on capital withdrawals from the country and the revocation of state honors.\n\nThe action follows ongoing legal troubles for the former president of Ukraine, including accusations of treason linked to his alleged involvement in a scheme to disrupt coal supplies from South Africa and favor imports from Russian-occupied territories in the country's east. Sanctioned along with several of Ukraine's oligarchs, Poroshenko faces more than 20 criminal investigations, including charges related to corruption and ties to Moscow.\n\nAside from the coal-related accusations, some experts suggest that the sanctions could be tied to Ukraine's upcoming elections. The decision, made amid discussions of a ceasefire and potential stalemate, might be an effort to neutralize one of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy's most influential opponents, who remains a vocal critic of the government.\n\nPoroshenko, a current member of the parliament, has claimed that the decision was \"unconstitutional\" and \"politically motivated.\" The European People's Party, the largest political group in the European Parliament, has expressed concerns over the sanctions, raising questions about their timing and the intentions behind them.\n\nReconstruction of Ukraine will require 230 billion for rebuilding war-torn infrastructure and damaged buildings, with an expected $130 billion funding shortfall. If a durable peace accord emerges and sufficient financial support materializes, Ukraine's energy, manufacturing and construction sectors could flourish, easing economic pressures on the European Union over time. Meanwhile, Kyiv's vast reserves of critical resources such as uranium and lithium have drawn interest from President Trump and others, potentially affording the nation leverage to negotiate a more favorable settlement of the war.\n\nRussia has escalated the use of enhanced Iranian-designed Shahed drones, now armed with 200-pound warheads, nearly doubling their explosive capacity. Although their operational range has been curtailed to 400 miles, these drones have undergone continuous modifications to evade Ukrainian air defenses and amplify their destructive potential. Following trial runs in 2023, Russia has ramped up drone production, with plans to manufacture up to 10,000 Shaheds by year's end, incorporating various payloads, including thermobaric warheads. The frequency of Moscow's drone offensives has recently intensified, with more than 2,275 Shaheds launched from January to mid-June, 2024, followed by a surge to 4,300 in October. Nearly 4,000 more drones have been deployed so far in 2025. Of these, 59% have been shot down and 37% neutralized through electronic warfare systems.","summary":"Dispatches from Ukraine.

Before quitting, Danielle Sassoon told President Donald Trump’s new attorney general that she was “confident” Adams had committed the crimes.\n\nTwo senior Justice Department officials also resigned after the department leadership moved to seize control of the case. The acting deputy U.S. attorney general, former Trump personal lawyer Emil Bove, who had ordered the Adams case dropped, said in a letter accepting Sassoon’s resignation that the Justice Department in Washington would file a motion to drop the charges and bar “further targeting” of the Democratic mayor.\n\nSassoon, a Republican serving as interim U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York, announced her resignation in an email to her staff. The move, confirmed by a spokesperson for the office, came after a dayslong standoff between the Manhattan prosecutor and her superiors in Washington.\n\nThe dueling letters from officials in New York and Washington laid bare in starkly personal language the gravity of a simmering, behind-the-scenes dispute over the handling of one of the government’s most significant current public corruption cases. The outcome not only threatens to create an irrevocable fissure in the relationship between the department’s headquarters and its most prestigious prosecutorial offices, but also risks reinforcing the perception that Trump’s administration will employ a transactional approach to law enforcement decisions.\n\n“I remain baffled by the rushed and superficial process by which this decision was reached,” Sassoon wrote Wednesday in a letter to U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi, a copy of which was obtained by The Associated Press. Sassoon urged Bondi to reconsider the directive to drop Adams’ case.\n\nWith Sassoon refusing to comply with the Trump administration’s order, the department’s public integrity section was asked to take over the case, according to a person familiar with the matter. Two senior officials who oversee the unit, including the acting chief, resigned in response, according to the person, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss personnel matters.\n\nThe exits came days after Bove directed federal prosecutors in New York to end the case against Adams, who was accused of accepting illegal campaign contributions and bribes of free or discounted travel from people who wanted to buy his influence. He has pleaded not guilty.\n\nBove said in a memo Monday that the case should be dismissed so Adams could aid President Donald Trump’s immigration crackdown and campaign for reelection free from facing criminal charges. The primary is four months away and Adams has multiple challengers.\n\nBove scolded Sassoon in a letter accepting her resignation. He wrote that she was “incapable of fairly and impartially reviewing the circumstances of this prosecution.” Bove said he would open internal investigations into her “conduct” and that of prosecutors who worked on the Adam case. They will be placed on “off-duty, administrative leave,” he said.\n\nBove had directed Sassoon to drop Adams’ case as soon as “practicable,” but there have been no public statements or actions by the prosecution team. On Wednesday, Bondi said she would “look into” why the case had yet to be dismissed. As of Thursday afternoon, the charges remained in place.\n\nIn her letter to Bondi, Sassoon accused Adams’ lawyers of repeatedly and explicitly offering what amounted to a “quid pro quo” during a meeting with the Justice Department last month. She wrote that the lawyers had offered the mayor’s assistance with the Trump administration’s immigration enforcement priorities if the case were to be dismissed.\n\n“It is a breathtaking and dangerous precedent to reward Adams’s opportunistic and shifting commitments on immigration and other policy matters with dismissal of a criminal indictment,” Sassoon wrote. She calling the purported offer “an improper offer of immigration enforcement assistance in exchange for a dismissal of his case.”\n\nIn an email, Adams’ lawyer, Alex Spiro, said the allegation of a quid pro quo was a “total lie.”\n\n“We offered nothing and the department asked nothing of us,” Spiro said. “We were asked if the case had any bearing on national security and immigration enforcement and we truthfully answered it did.”\n\nThe department’s decision to end the Adams case because of political considerations, rather than the strength or weakness of the evidence, alarmed some career prosecutors who said it was a departure from long-standing norms.\n\nThe directive from Bove, was all the more remarkable because Bove had been a longtime prosecutor and supervisor in the Southern District and because department leaders are historically reluctant to intervene in cases where charges have been brought.\n\nBove’s memo also steered clear of any legal basis for the dismissal despite decades of department tradition dictating that charging decisions are to be guided by facts, evidence and the law.\n\nSassoon, a former clerk for the late U.S. Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia, was not the prosecutor who brought the case against Adams last year. That was then-U.S. Attorney Damian Williams, who stepped down after Trump’s election victory in November.\n\nSassoon had only been tapped to serve as acting U.S. attorney on Jan. 21, the day after Trump took office.\n\nHer role was intended to be temporary. Trump in November nominated Jay Clayton, the former chairman of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, to the post, an appointment that must be confirmed by the Senate. That has not happened yet.\n\nThe Southern District of New York is among the largest and most prominent prosecutor’s offices in the U.S., with a long track record of tackling Wall Street malfeasance, political corruption and international terrorism. It has a tradition of independence from Washington, something that has earned it the nickname “the sovereign district.”\n\nThis is the second Justice Department tussle in five years between Washington and New York officials to result in a dramatic leadership turnover.\n\nIn 2020, William Barr, who served as one of Trump’s attorneys general during his first term pushed out Geoffrey Berman, the U.S. attorney in Manhattan, in a surprise nighttime announcement. Berman initially refused to resign his position, creating a brief standoff with Barr, but did so after an assurance that his investigations into allies of Trump would not be disturbed.\n\nAdams was indicted in September on charges that while he worked as Brooklyn borough president, he accepted over $100,000 in illegal campaign contributions and lavish travel perks such as expensive flight upgrades, luxury hotel stays and even a trip to a bathhouse.\n\nThe indictment said a Turkish official who helped facilitate the trips then leaned on Adams for favors, including asking him to lobby the Fire Department to let a newly constructed, 36-story diplomatic building open in time for a planned visit by Turkey’s president.\n\nProsecutors said they had proof that Adams personally directed political aides to solicit foreign donations and disguise them to help the campaign qualify for a city program that provides a generous, publicly-funded match for small dollar donations. Under federal law, foreign nationals are banned from contributing to U.S. election campaigns.\n\nAs recently as Jan. 6, prosecutors had indicated their investigation remained active, writing in court papers that they continued to “uncover additional criminal conduct by Adams.”\n\nBove said in his memo that Justice Department officials in Washington hadn’t evaluated the evidence in the case before deciding it should be dropped — at least until after the mayoral election coming in November.\n\nBut he criticized “recent public actions” by Williams that he said had “threatened the integrity of the proceedings, including by increasing prejudicial pretrial publicity.” Williams hasn’t spoken publicly about the Adams case since his resignation, but wrote an editorial decrying corruption in politics.\n\nFederal agents had also been investigating other senior Adams aides. It was unclear what will happen to that side of the probe. __\n\nRicher and Tucker reported from Washington. Associated Press writers Jake Offenhartz and Michael R.

The announcement came during a joint press conference with Prime Minister Narendra Modi at the White House, where both leaders also discussed trade relations, security cooperation, and Indo-Pacific stability.\nF-35 Sale: A Strategic Shift in India’s Defense Procurement\nTrump confirmed that the U.S. would be increasing military sales to India by billions of dollars, with the eventual goal of providing India with F-35 fighter jets. This move aligns with India’s ongoing military modernization efforts, which include a $250 billion plan over the next decade.\n\"Starting this year, we will be increasing military sales to India by many billions of dollars. We are also paving the way to ultimately provide India with the F-35 stealth fighters,\" Trump stated.\nThe inclusion of India in the F-35 program would represent a strategic shift, given the country’s historical defense ties with Russia. However, the sale could face hurdles, particularly due to India's prior purchase of Russia’s S-400 missile defense system, which had earlier led to the U.S. canceling Turkey’s participation in the F-35 program.\nAero India 2025: Showcasing U.S.-India Defense Collaboration\nAs a precursor to the deal, an F-35 aircraft performed a demonstration at Aero India 2025 in Bengaluru, Karnataka, highlighting growing military cooperation between the two nations.

They charge more tariffs than any other country,\" Trump remarked.\nWhile Trump has previously imposed reciprocal tariffs on multiple nations, including India, New Delhi is hoping to negotiate relief through trade concessions. Ahead of the bilateral talks, India reduced duties on high-end motorcycles, benefiting U.S. manufacturers like Harley-Davidson.\nQuad and Indo-Pacific Strategy\nTrump reaffirmed U.S. commitment to the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue (Quad), comprising India, the U.S., Australia, and Japan. He emphasized the group’s role in maintaining peace and stability in the Indo-Pacific region.\n\"In our meeting today, the prime minister and I reaffirmed that strong cooperation among the United States, India, Australia, and Japan is crucial to maintaining peace and prosperity in the Indo-Pacific,\" Trump stated.\nWith increasing geopolitical tensions in the region, closer defense and strategic ties between India and the U.S. are seen as a counterbalance to China’s growing influence.

Modi assured Trump of India’s commitment to tackling illegal migration and human trafficking networks.\nA Strengthened Strategic Partnership\nThe sale of F-35 fighter jets, discussions on trade disputes, and enhanced Indo-Pacific cooperation highlight the strengthening U.S.-India partnership.

Trump has proposed a controversial approach to resolving the war between Russia and Ukraine, focused on engaging with Russian President Vladimir Putin directly and reconsidering Russia’s status on the global stage.\nA Call for Dialogue and a G7 Return\nTrump has long expressed skepticism about the effectiveness of isolating Russia, and his comments this week underline his belief that the G7’s decision to expel Russia in 2014, following its annexation of Crimea, was a mistake. In a statement from the White House, Trump voiced his desire for Russia to rejoin the Group of Seven (G7), an exclusive club of major global economies. “I’d love to have them back. I think it was a mistake to throw them out,” Trump said. He suggested that if Russia had remained in the G8, the current tensions in Ukraine might have been avoided.\nTrump’s belief is that having Russia at the table would foster more constructive dialogue and prevent the escalation of the war. According to him, excluding Russia from global discussions exacerbates tensions and leads to misunderstandings. The idea that “it’s not a question of liking Russia or not liking Russia” highlights Trump’s pragmatic approach to diplomacy. His focus is on ending conflicts, not on ideological differences.\nThe Saudi Summit and Neutral Ground\nTrump’s recent suggestion that Saudi Arabia could host his upcoming summit with Putin further reflects his unconventional approach. While European capitals have historically been venues for high-stakes talks between U.S. and Russian leaders, Saudi Arabia offers an alternative with its neutral stance on the Ukraine conflict. Unlike many Western nations, the Gulf kingdom has refrained from condemning Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, allowing it to be seen as a neutral party in a crisis that has sharply divided the international community.\nSaudi Arabia’s position on the International Criminal Court (ICC) is also significant. Since the ICC has issued a warrant for Putin’s arrest, many countries in the West would be hesitant to host the Russian president, fearing legal consequences. However, as Saudi Arabia is not a member of the ICC, Putin would be able to travel there for talks without such concerns.\nA Friendship with MBS\nTrump’s relationship with Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman (MBS) has been a cornerstone of his foreign policy. MBS has maintained a close bond with Putin throughout the Ukraine conflict, and his diplomatic efforts have even extended to prisoner swaps between the U.S. and Russia. This collaboration positions Saudi Arabia as an ideal neutral party for hosting a Trump-Putin summit.\n“We know the crown prince, and I think it’d be a very good place to be,” Trump remarked, referencing MBS’s strong ties with both the U.S. and Russia. MBS’s role in global peacekeeping, such as hosting a peace summit on Ukraine last year and facilitating significant U.S.-Russia prisoner swaps, enhances his credibility as a mediator.\nTrump’s Desire for a Ceasefire\nTrump’s vision for the Ukraine war involves an immediate cessation of hostilities, ideally through direct negotiations with Putin. In previous remarks, Trump has stated that he could negotiate a peace deal within 24 hours if he were in office, a claim that exemplifies his bold confidence in his ability to mediate high-level talks. Trump’s approach contrasts with the prevailing policy of the Biden administration, which has supported Ukraine’s resistance to Russian occupation and provided substantial military aid to Kyiv.\nTrump’s criticisms of the current U.S. approach are rooted in his belief that America should not be embroiled in another prolonged conflict. His primary goal is to bring an end to the fighting, reduce U.S. involvement, and shift the focus to diplomatic negotiations rather than military escalation.\nA Stronger Global Position\nTrump’s comments about the Ukraine conflict reflect his broader strategy of positioning himself as a strong international leader who can bridge divides. His efforts to revive the idea of Russia’s return to the G7 and his willingness to engage directly with Putin are part of his larger agenda to reshape U.S. foreign policy. As he seeks to bolster his stature as an international statesman, Trump is capitalizing on the opportunity to present himself as a peacemaker who can secure deals and stabilize global tensions.\nWhile Trump’s approach to the Ukraine conflict may be seen as controversial by some, his calls for dialogue and diplomatic solutions underscore his broader belief that international relations should prioritize negotiation over confrontation. Whether his strategy could lead to a breakthrough remains to be seen, but his unconventional ideas continue to challenge the prevailing foreign policy narrative.\nRead More : Trump Interrupts CNN Reporter During Press Briefing: 'We Haven't Asked You to Speak Yet","summary":"Former President Donald Trump has consistently positioned himself as a strong advocate for diplomacy, and his stance on the ongoing Ukraine conflict is no different.","url":"https://www.newsx.com/world/trump-pushes-putin-talks-wants-russia-back-in-g7-to-end-ukraine-war/","image":"https://www.newsx.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/donald-trump.webp","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-02-14 00:42:25","author":"Anirudh","authors":["Anirudh"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"in","sentiment":0.268},{"id":290286170,"title":"PM Modi On Illegal Immigration: Commitment To Repatriation And Anti-Trafficking Measures","text":"During his bilateral talks with former U.S. President Donald Trump today, Prime Minister Narendra Modi addressed the issue of illegal immigration, emphasizing India’s commitment to taking back verified immigrants and dismantling human trafficking networks. The discussion comes at a crucial time when several Indian nationals who had entered the U.S. illegally have been deported back to India in recent months. Modi’s remarks highlighted the socio-economic struggles of these migrants and stressed the need for global cooperation to combat trafficking.\nRecent Deportations of Indian Immigrants from the U.S.\nThe U.S. has ramped up its crackdown on illegal immigration, leading to the deportation of several Indian nationals in recent months. Many of these individuals had crossed into the U.S. through irregular routes, often paying human traffickers large sums to facilitate their journey. The deportations have drawn attention to the growing issue of illegal migration from India, particularly from states like Punjab and Gujarat, where economic distress has pushed people to seek better opportunities abroad.\nRepatriation of Verified Immigrants\nIn response to these developments, PM Modi assured that India would take back individuals identified as verified Indian nationals. He noted that many of these migrants come from economically disadvantaged backgrounds and were misled by traffickers who promised them better lives abroad. His statement reaffirmed India’s commitment to ensuring the safe return of its citizens and addressing the root causes of illegal migration.\nModi expressed concern that many of these migrants had been tricked into making dangerous journeys under false promises. He stressed that such individuals should not be treated as criminals but as victims of trafficking and fraudulent schemes. He also called for stronger measures to prevent further exploitation and ensure their rehabilitation upon return.\nCrackdown on Human Trafficking Networks\nA major focus of Modi’s statement was his government’s determination to dismantle human trafficking networks that facilitate illegal migration. He assured that India would strengthen legal frameworks and international cooperation to target these networks, preventing further exploitation of vulnerable individuals.\nDismantling the Ecosystem of Illegal Migration\nBeyond targeting traffickers, PM Modi emphasized the importance of eliminating the broader system that enables illegal immigration.

The notification was confirmed by a person familiar with the matter, who spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss it publicly.\n\nIt’s expected to be the first step in sweeping layoffs. President Donald Trump signed an executive order Tuesday that told agency leaders to plan for “large-scale reductions in force.”\n\nElon Musk, whom President Trump has given wide leeway to slash government spending with his Department of Government Efficiency, called Thursday for the elimination of whole agencies.\n\n“I think we do need to delete entire agencies as opposed to leave a lot of them behind,” Musk said via a videocall to the World Governments Summit in Dubai, United Arab Emirates. “If we don’t remove the roots of the weed, then it’s easy for the weed to grow back.”\n\nPaul Light, an expert on the federal government and professor emeritus of public service at New York University, said it seemed like the administration was “inventing new methods for destroying government capacity.”\n\n“You’re basically harassing your own workforce at the end of the day,” he said. “You’re undermining the engine that you want to run.”\n\nLayoffs are unlikely to yield significant deficit savings. When the Congressional Budget Office looked at the issue, it found the government spent $271 billion annually compensating civilian federal workers, with about 60% of that total going to workers employed by the departments of Defense, Homeland Security and Veterans Affairs.\n\nThe government could, in theory, have cut all those workers and still run a deficit of over $1 trillion that would continue to grow as tax revenues are needed to keep up with the growing costs of Social Security and Medicare.\n\nThursday’s order was an expansion of previous directions from OPM, which told agencies earlier this week that probationary employees should be fired if they weren’t meeting high standards. It’s not clear how many workers are currently in a probationary period. According to government data maintained by OPM, as of March 2024, 220,000 workers had less than a year on the job — the most recent data available.\n\nThe firing of probationary employees began earlier this week and has included Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and the Department of Education workers.\n\nAt least 39 were fired from the Education Department on Wednesday, according to a union that represents agency workers, including civil rights workers, special education specialists and student aid officials.\n\nThe layoffs also hit Department of Veterans Affairs researchers working on cancer treatment, opioid addiction, prosthetics and burn pit exposure, U.S. Sen. Patty Murray, a Democrat, said Thursday.\n\n“I’m hearing from longtime VA researchers in my home state of Washington who are right now being told to immediately stop their research and pack their bags,” Murray said in a statement, “not because their work isn’t desperately needed, but because Trump and Elon have decided to fire these researchers on a whim.”\n\nPublic Employees for Environmental Responsibility, a group that defends government workers, said the Agriculture Department’s Food Safety and Inspection Service would be hit especially hard by laying off probationary employees because it has trouble recruiting inspectors required to be present at all times at most slaughterhouses.\n\n“Firing any probationary employees would be a big kick in the gut to those that do very grueling and difficult work,” PEER’s executive director, Tim Whitehouse, said. “It would make our food system less safe and cause consumer confidence in the safety of our food supply to dip.”\n\nThe civilian federal workforce, not including military personnel and postal workers, is made up of about 2.4 million people. While about 20% of the workers are in Washington D.C., and the neighboring states of Maryland and Virginia, more than 80% live outside the Capitol region.\n\nTrump’s initial attempt to downsize the workforce was the deferred resignation program, commonly described as a buyout, which offered to pay people until Sept. 30 if they agreed to quit. The White House said 75,000 people signed up, and a federal judge cleared a legal roadblock for the program on Wednesday.\n\nHowever, the number of workers who took the offer was less than the administration’s target, and Trump has made it clear he would take further steps.\n\nEmployees at the National Science Foundation and Housing and Urban Development Department were told this week that large reductions, in some cases a halving of the workforce, would be coming, according to a person familiar with the situation who spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss it.\n\nThe National Science Foundation was told to expect a 25% to 50% reduction in force within two months, while the Housing and Urban Development Department was told to plan for a 50% reduction, the person said.\n\nEmployees at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration were also bracing Thursday for reductions in their workforce.\n\nThe order Trump signed Tuesday stipulated that government functions not required by law would be prioritized for cuts and hiring will be restricted. With exceptions for functions such as public safety, only one employee can be added for every four that leave. In addition, new hires would generally need the approval from a representative of the DOGE, expanding the influence of Musk’s team.\n\nTrump, speaking to reporters later at the White House, praised Musk’s work to slash federal spending.\n\n“We’re looking for waste, fraud and abuse,” he said. “That’s what Elon is working so hard on.”\n\nThe Republican president has also been sharply critical of federal workers, especially those who want to keep working remotely, though his administration is simultaneously working to cut federal office space and ordering the termination of worksite leases throughout the government.\n\n“Nobody is gonna work from home,” Trump said Monday. “They are gonna be going out, they’re gonna play tennis, they’re gonna play golf, they’re gonna do a lot of things. They’re not working.”\n\nPrice reported from New York.

Border communities also got N50bn, military barracks got N250bn and N120bn was appropriated for military aviation.\n\nAddressing the House of Representatives during Thursday’s plenary, the Chairman of the House Committee on Appropriations, Abubakar Bichi, who moved for the consideration of the budget proposal said, “The House do consider the Report of the Committee on Appropriations Bill for an Act to authorise the issue from the Consolidated Revenue Fund of the Federation the total sum of N54.99tn of which N3.65tn only is for Statutory Transfers.\n\n“N14.32tn only is for debt service, N13.06tn only is for recurrent (non-debt) expenditure while the sum of N23.96tn only is for contribution to the Development Fund for Capital Expenditure for the year ending on December 31, 2025.”\n\nOn December 18, 2024, the House received the committee’s report and on December 19, had the clause-by-clause consideration of the 2025 Appropriation Bill.\n\nA breakdown of the allocations obtained by The PUNCH revealed that the National Assembly allocated to itself a total sum of N344.85bn in the 2025 fiscal year. Others include the National Judicial Council, N521.63bn; Niger Delta Development Commission, N626.53bn and the North West Development Commission, N145bn.\n\nThe South-West, South-East, South-South, and North-Central Development Commissions were allocated N140bn each by the Appropriation Committee. Meanwhile, the North-East Development Commission was allocated N241bn.\n\nThe Independent Electoral Commission was allocated N140bn by the Committee on Appropriations, more than its request for N126bn.\n\nThe INEC Chairman, Mahmood Yakubu, had on January 10, 2025, while defending the commission’s 2024 budget performance, said, “Our proposal for 2025 is that the commission requires the sum of N126bn. So, we would like the support of the National Assembly members to ensure that we are adequately funded for the responsibilities we are required to discharge, and most of these responsibilities are constitutional. They are not just in the Electoral Act.”\n\nHeeding the plea, the Appropriation Committee allocated N140bn to the electoral umpire to fund its operations in the 2025 fiscal year.\n\nThe Presidency was allocated N111bn, the Ministry of Defence N2.5tn, while the Ministries of Foreign Affairs and Information and National Orientation were allocated N286.89bn and N75.88bn, respectively.\n\nOthers include the Ministry of Police Affairs, N1.2tn; Office of the National Security Adviser, N535.97bn; Office of the Secretary to the Government of the Federation, N140bn and the Ministry of Agriculture and Food Security, N155bn, among others.\n\nDuring the clause-by-clause consideration of the Appropriation Bill, the member representing Ikwo/Ezza South Federal Constituency, Ebonyi State, Chinedu Ogar, drew the attention of the House to the absence of a rail project in the South-East.\n\nHe said, “We are talking about the light rail project in this year’s budget, connecting Kaduna, Lagos, and Ogun States. The South-East region where I come from is not captured.”\n\nResponding, Speaker Tajudeen Abbas said the rail projects he referred to were ongoing, assuring however his observation would be made known to the President.\n\n“We will bring this to the attention of Mr President and this may be addressed in a supplementary budget,” the speaker said.\n\nMeanwhile, the Chairman of the House Committee on Appropriation, Bichi, had given reasons for the upward review of the 2025 budget proposal.\n\nBriefing newsmen shortly after the budget passage, the Kano lawmaker cited the recent policy reversals by United States President Donald Trump as a deciding factor.\n\n“The United States government has withdrawn its support for some countries in terms of providing health support, and Nigeria is among them. The president proactively requested an addition of $200m, which is about N300bn, to cater for the health sector and for people who have the challenge of tuberculosis, HIV, malaria, and polio.\n\n“We also have some genuine requests from some agencies like INEC, the Nigerian Financial Intelligence Unit, the Department of State Services and so on. That is what makes up the additional N700bn,” he explained.\n\n“There are some critical projects such as rail projects, road infrastructure, agriculture, as well as education. That’s where the money will go,” he added. \n\nThe lawmaker noted that the relevant revenue-generating agencies assured the National Assembly of their ability to meet the nation’s funding needs.\n\n“Before we increased the budget, we had a meeting with the Ministry of Finance, Nigeria Customs Service, and the Federal Inland Revenue Service. They confirmed to us that they will be able to come up with enough funding for the budget,” he said.\n\nEconomists react\n\nThe Group Managing Director of Cowry Assets Management Limited, Johnson Chukwu, observed that the budget had positive and negative economic implications, predicting the deficit could lead to borrowing from the Central Bank of Nigeria.\n\nChukwu argued that considering the budget was designed to increase revenue without burdening the average taxpayer, the government’s revenue targets, particularly in crude oil production, are overly ambitious and unlikely to be achieved.\n\n“The government budget was with the intention that it would increase the revenue of government enterprises and not impose a burden on the average taxpayer,” he pointed out. “But, it is nearly impossible for the budget to produce 2.06 million barrels of oil per day. The money budgeted for crude oil is not achievable.”\n\nChukwu warned that if the government fails to meet its revenue target and decides to borrow from the Central Bank of Nigeria or seek external funding to inject more money into the economy there is a risk of heightened inflationary pressures.\n\nHe explained, “An expansionary budget is a stimulus budget. When you have an expansionary budget, it means the government wants to inject liquidity into the hands of consumers by creating jobs and consumption to trigger or kickstart economic recovery and economic growth. It will drive inflationary pressures.\n\n“We are contending with inflation pressure of over 34.8 per cent, so ordinarily, the budget will worsen inflation and exchange rate pressure. Depending on how the budget is implemented, it could trigger pressure on exchanges but the positive is that it is supposed to create jobs and stimulate consumption.”\n\nSimilarly, the Chief Executive Officer of Economic Associates, Dr Ayo Teriba warned of heightened inflation, as he observed that the Federal Government’s attention needs to be fixed on funding the N54.99trn budget.\n\nTeriba warned against a situation where the National Assembly passes the budget but there is not enough money to fund it, quipping “It is not a matter of applauding or not applauding. It’s a matter of saying, ‘Okay, the government has successfully passed the budget through the National Assembly. It remains for the President (Tinubu) to sign it into law and when they do, let’s hope that the Ministries, Departments, and Agencies will deliver on the revenue expectations and the budget will turn out as planned.\n\n“(We are) hoping that they would be able to fund the budget so It won’t be like in the past, like in 2024 when the same National Assembly approved a budget that the president had proposed with a slight addition, and by the end of the year, they hadn’t been able to fund it.”\n\nTaking a different approach, the Chief Economist/ Managing Editor of Proshare Teslim Shitta-Bey noted that the outcome of the revised budget remains uncertain as it depends on revenue and expenditure dynamics.\n\nAccording to Shitta-Bey, the government has multiple sources of raising funds, including debt or a normal profit or loss statement. He submitted, “It is difficult to say. We are looking at revenue and expenditure for the revised side, and we don’t know if it will increase or not.”\n\n“The government has different sources of raising funds. It could be funded by debt or a normal profit or loss statement. It is not a troublesome issue if the funds raised are applied in a way that will stimulate the economy,” he said.\n\nHe added that the additional budget should have been larger, considering the need for government spending to stimulate the economy.\n\n“I think the additional budget should have been larger because the country needs to spend money. We can’t say much about it until we see the results. From what I’ve read, it’s going to increase the budget deficit, but that’s speculative. The government may have identified new sources of revenue,” he added.\n\nShitta-Bey cautioned that if the budget increase does not translate into real sector growth, it could lead to higher inflation. He explained that the CBN has refrained from funding the deficit through Ways and Means expenditure which would have involved printing money.\n\nFurther criticism came from the Chief Executive Officer of Cowry Treasurers Limited, Charles Sanni, who criticised the budget preparation process, stating that the frequent revisions reflect poor planning and a reactive approach.\n\nSanni noted that the early review of the budget highlights the government’s inability to anticipate economic challenges effectively. He argued that the budget process needs significant improvement to enhance fiscal discipline and economic stability.\n\n“It tells us one thing: our budget preparation needs improvement. I do not see why we did not get the process right. It is reactive and points to the fact that nothing is static. It is too early in the year to be making these reviews or recommendations,” he said.\n\nSanni expressed doubts about the government’s revenue projections, especially regarding company taxes, given the current economic climate.\n\n“Budget is a function of so many things, and we have the global economy that has its impact. For a country like Nigeria that is highly dependent on oil proceeds, I am not sure we can get as much company taxes from companies, but it is still part of the whole that makes up the revenue in the country,” he explained.\n\nMembers of the Organised Private Sector in separate telephone interviews gave mixed reviews to the N54.99trn budget, praising it as necessary for economic growth and decrying the cost of financing and how it poses the risk of heightened inflation.\n\nPresident of the Lagos Chamber of Commerce and Industry, Gabriel Idahosa, lauded the budget as a good effort in achieving President Bola Tinubu’s $1tn economy goal, noting that the Federal Government needs the budget to meet the targets.\n\nHe remarked, “The budget is a continuous effort towards the target of the $1tn economy. Every budget of the Federal Government for the next four years will move in that direction.”\n\nThe LCCI president observed that neither the 2025 budget nor subsequent ones would be adequate to achieve those broad targets of achieving economic growth but acknowledged it is one of several steps towards the government’s $1tn economy objective.\n\n“In that context, you cannot say this budget is enough but it is part of the effort to move in that direction. To that extent, it is a good effort,” Idahosa submitted. “It is a determined and measurable effort of moving the economy to those targets that are supposed to be the benefits from the reform.”\n\nIn his reaction, a Nigerian Economic Summit Group member, Dr Ikenna Nwosu, described the budget as good but worried that it would be challenging for the Federal Government to finance the deficit.\n\nAccording to Nwosu, “The jerk up and the raising of high revenue targets for revenue generating agencies is worrying.” He cautioned the government to reduce expectations of revenue inflows as citizens’ purchasing powers remain low.\n\nMoreover, the National President of the Association of Small Business Owners of Nigeria, Dr Femi Egbesola, recognised the budgetary increase as a standard practice, especially with the country’s wide infrastructural deficits.\n\n“It is good that the government is increasing the budget to support the social investment programs and fix critical infrastructures,” Egbesola noted. “Supporting agriculture through the Bank of Agriculture and the Micro, Small, and Medium Enterprises through the Bank of Industry will go a long way to help the real sector and catalyse the economy.\n\nHowever, ASBON’s president urged judicious spending of the budgetary allocations and warned against over-taxation, adding “We want to see the fund go to the expected sectors, (and the government) enable metrics to measure its impacts, build monitoring and evaluation to ensure transparency in the processes.\n\n“Caution must also be applied not to overtax and overstretch the already burdened and over-stretched Nigerians, driving them to more poverty and dilemmas through further levies and tax increments.”","summary":"The National Assembly on Thursday passed the 2025 Appropriation Bill of N54.99tn, allocating N14.32tn for debt servicing and N13.64tn for recurrent expenditure covering salaries, overheads, and government operations.

Kathy Hochul and Mayor Eric Adams will do themselves (and their constituents!) a big favor by boosting cooperation with Washington.\n\nOn Wednesday, Attorney General Pam Bondi sued New York for limiting that cooperation, citing the state’s Green Light law, which grants driver’s licenses to illegal immigrants and bans inquiries into immigration status, requiring a judge’s order for any release of state info.\n\nState officials even tip off drivers if immigration officials request their data.\n\n“Sovereign” states can opt out of immigration enforcement, conceded Bondi, but when “inaction crosses into obstruction, a State breaks the law” — since the Constitution’s Supremacy Clause makes New York law inferior to federal law.\n\nMeanwhile, border czar Tom Homan is “not happy” with Adams’ help so far.\n\nAfter the two met Thursday, the mayor vowed to issue an executive order letting ICE agents operate on Rikers Island, focusing on “violent criminals and gangs.”\n\nThat’s a start. \n\nIn fact, Hizzoner has repeatedly said he wants to help nab violent migrant criminals. But he’s constrained by sanctuary laws that the City Council refuses to amend.\n\nThose claim to bar federal agents from public buildings, for example, so the best a recent City Hall memo could do was remind city workers it’s a “federal crime” to “shield” an illegal from “detection” and urge them to cooperate with agents if “you reasonably . . . fear for your safety.”\n\nHoman, understandably, wants more.\n\nIndeed, the new Laken Riley Act boosts federal powers to go after criminal migrants, and so should force the city (and state) to give up even more “sanctuary” ground.\n\nLook, President Donald Trump was elected to clean up President Joe Biden’s migrant disaster, and he’s doing that, in part, by discouraging wannabe-migrants with a crackdown on criminal border-jumpers already here, as well as far tougher enforcement at the border that’s got crossings down to a six-decade low.\n\nYet open-border lawmakers have turned New York into a migrant sanctuary — protecting even criminally violent ones — in what increasingly has become outright defiance of federal law.\n\nThen again, state and city laws and policies are at odds with New Yorkers’ preferences: A recent Siena poll found a whopping 80% back deportations of illegals who’ve committed crimes.\n\nMore broadly, Empire State voters even support Trump’s overall deportation efforts by 48% to 31%\n\nSo Hochul needs to square her professed backing for “deporting violent criminals” with her fervent support for the Green Light law — which, ironically, she fiercely opposed two decades ago, as Erie County clerk.\n\n“No way I’m letting federal agents, or Elon Musk’s shadowy DOGE operation, get unfettered access to the personal data of any New Yorker in the [Division of Motor Vehicles] system,” huffed Hochul.\n\nThe gov should stand down, unless she wants a war on an issue where her own voters back Trump.\n\n(She should get her “villains” straight, too: DOGE isn’t the one on the DMV front; rather, it’s fighting the city over $80 million in FEMA money used for immigrants.)\n\nHochul and Adams need to work out their differences with Washington; the gov can take a huge step by rescinding the Cuomo “sanctuary” executive orders, while Adams welcomes ICE back to Rikers Island.\n\nRadicals will scream, but New York voters will stand behind leaders who embrace common sense.","summary":"Even so, Gov.

Musk, the head of DOGE, has dispatched subordinates throughout the government to radically overhaul or dismantle federal agencies with the backing of President Donald Trump. \n\nMany of the details around DOGE’s actions have remained secret, though it has moved to gain access to large swaths of data held in the computer systems of individual agencies. \n\nThat access has become contentious, and a federal judge issued a restraining order Saturday temporarily forbidding DOGE’s access to sensitive Treasury data, a case that does not involve the Labor Department. Democrats, labor unions and privacy advocates have filed lawsuits trying to halt data access at other government offices. Their concerns include the alleged use of artificial intelligence to analyze federal data and the alleged use of a computer server not familiar to government employees. \n\nTransferring government data outside established protocols could have high stakes for anyone whose information is in those databases, because of the chance that more people would have access to their information than originally intended, increasing chances of a breach. \n\nAfter the Labor Department approved DOGE to use PuTTY last week, the two department employees said that access was put on hold, at least temporarily, because of a lawsuit filed by several federal labor unions. NBC News was not able to determine whether Musk’s subordinates at DOGE had already used the software or transferred any data, but the possibility was enough to spark concern within the Labor Department about the security of sensitive information, the two employees said. \n\nThe two employees said that they considered the authorization to be a red flag because the DOGE members were new arrivals who, in their view, lacked sufficient vetting and experience for the access they were getting. \n\n“We don’t know who they are, and we’re giving them free rein to extract whatever they want,” one employee said. “This is completely opposite of what we’d do to protect privacy.”\n\nWhen reached for comment, a White House spokesperson did not directly answer questions about the software access but said that those working with Musk were doing so in full compliance with federal law, with appropriate security clearances and as employees of the relevant agencies, not as outside advisers. \n\nThe Labor Department’s press office did not respond to a request for comment. \n\nPuTTY is an open-source application that has been freely available for decades. Some technologists, including in government agencies, use it routinely in their jobs as a tool not only to transfer files but also to access computers remotely. \n\nBut government departments tightly control who may install and use the app on office machines because there are strict rules and laws about the security of federal data, the two Labor Department employees said. In general, people who want to use PuTTY or other controlled software must seek permission from system administrators to ensure their use would comply with security rules, they said. \n\nThe two Labor Department employees said that five DOGE workers were approved to use two pieces of software: PuTTY, commonly used for large file transfers, and an SQL studio program, used for editing and exploring certain databases. \n\nAccording to records seen by NBC News, the five people were: Sam Beyda, Derek Geissler, Cole Killian, Adam Ramada and Jordan Wick. Ramada identified himself as a DOGE employee in a sworn declaration in federal court last week, and Killian has been identified as a DOGE employee by news organizations, including NBC News. Wired magazine reported Saturday that Wick is affiliated with DOGE. The names of Beyda and Geissler have not been previously reported as working for either DOGE or the Trump administration. \n\nNBC News sent emails to DOGE email addresses and others with those names and did not receive responses. The White House declined to provide further information about the five people. \n\nThe Labor Department has more than 50 electronic systems that include a diverse array of personally identifiable information, according to the department’s chief information officer. The systems hold data for offices such as the Bureau of Labor Statistics, which tracks the health of the economy; the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, or OSHA, which enforces workplace rules; and the Employment and Training Administration, which provides billions of dollars in grant money annually, including to community colleges and apprenticeship programs. It is unclear which, if any, Labor Department databases the DOGE employees sought access to.\n\nRamada, one of the DOGE employees, wrote in his court declaration last week that he and his colleagues would comply with all data security and privacy rules. He submitted the declaration in opposition to a proposed temporary restraining order, and he said he was one of three DOGE employees detailed to the Labor Department. \n\n“USDS employees detailed to the Department of Labor are required to be familiar with the legal rules governing access to Department of Labor data systems and are required to comply with those rules,” he wrote. (USDS stands for United States DOGE Service.) \n\nHe also pledged to follow rules related to sharing data. \n\n“To the extent USDS-Department of Labor detailees wish to share information garnered during their work duties within the Executive Branch, they are required to comply with all applicable laws and regulations,” he wrote. \n\nHe did not say in the declaration why DOGE would need to share data elsewhere within the executive branch. He said DOGE’s overall goal was “to inform policy decisions.” \n\nMusk has said that DOGE needs access to federal data in order to search for waste, fraud and abuse. He has also said that his office doesn’t have any personal data of Americans — an assertion that has been met by skepticism among government workers and Democrats in Congress. \n\nThe Washington Post reported last week that DOGE had fed sensitive data from the Education Department into artificial intelligence software to examine the agency’s programs and spending, and citing two people familiar with the project, Wired magazine reported that DOGE was developing an AI chatbot about spending across the government. NBC News has not confirmed that reporting. \n\nThe Labor Department’s databases likely include information about Musk’s own companies such as SpaceX and Tesla, both of which have been subjects of publicly reported OSHA inspections, as well as about companies that compete with Musk’s. Neither SpaceX nor Tesla responded to a request for comment on the potential for a conflict of interests. SpaceX has defended its safety record by pointing to training that it calls extensive, according to a 2023 investigation by Reuters into injuries at the company. Tesla has said its goal “is to become the world’s safest company by continuously integrating safety into the way we work.” \n\nDOGE employees turned their attention to the Labor Department last week, after previously causing upheaval at several federal offices, including the Treasury Department and the U.S. Agency for International Development. \n\nSimon Tatham, a British coder who created PuTTY, said he wasn’t surprised to hear that DOGE employees might be using his software. The app is available to anyone under a creative-commons license, and it’s one of many apps that could be used to transfer data. He said it’s up to U.S. authorities to enforce data security laws if anyone violates them. \n\nWhether DOGE’s access to certain federal databases should be prohibited is now before U.S. District Judge John Bates, who’s hearing the lawsuit filed last week in Washington, D.C., by several labor unions. On Friday, Bates ruled against a request by the plaintiffs for a temporary restraining order, finding that they did not have legal standing to sue. \n\nBates wrote, though, that he “harbors concerns about defendants’ alleged conduct.” He ordered additional briefing in the case, and the plaintiffs filed an amended complaint Tuesday naming other defendants, including the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. \n\nThe plaintiffs say that the Labor Department’s systems contain personally identifiable information about employees and others, as well as classified information. \n\n“These employees face irreparable harm to their privacy interests if this information is improperly accessed or disseminated (such as by being downloaded to a private server). Once the information is improperly accessed and/or disseminated, recovery may be difficult, and information may already have been used for impermissible purposes,” the lawsuit says. \n\nThe lawsuit doesn’t mention specific software programs, but it asks the court to direct the government “to remove any software installed by DOGE personnel on agency systems.” \n\nJustice Department lawyers wrote in response to the lawsuit that any allegations about transferring data were speculative. \n\n“Whether or not a particular effort to share specific types of information is lawful will depend upon the statutes and regulations that govern the use of those systems,” the lawyers wrote. “There is no basis for concluding, at this juncture, that any violation of the Privacy Act is forthcoming.”","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nElon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency has received approval from the Labor&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Labor Department employees alarmed by DOGE software approval first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/news/us/labor-department-employees-alarmed-by-doge-software-approval/","image":"https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit_1500w/rockcms/2025-02/250210-Elon-Musk-aa-523-38ca0f.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-02-14 00:32:57","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.235},{"id":290289736,"title":"New York Doctor Fined After Sending Abortion Pills To Texas Patient, Report Says","text":"Share to Facebook\n\nShare to Twitter\n\nShare to Linkedin\n\nA Texas judge Thursday ordered a New York doctor to pay over $100,000 for mailing abortion pills to a patient in the Lone Star state, according to The New York Times, setting a precedent for telemedicine abortion shield laws protecting doctors who provide abortion pills to patients in states with abortion bans.\n\nThe judge handed down his order Thrusday.

The laws protect doctors from legal consequences if they send abortion pills to patients living in states with abortion bans, a service that has become popular as more states have instituted abortion bans or limitations since Roe v. Wade was overturned in 2022, ending the federal right to abortion. Abortion pill provider Plan C told The Washington Post there are over 24 organizations sending abortion pills into states with abortion bans. As of last year, at least 6,000 women per month were receiving pills from online clinic Aid Access, according to the Post. President Donald Trump said on the campaign trail last year he would not institute a federal ban on abortion, though experts have suggested the president could still target abortion pills. After signaling in August he was open to limiting access to the pills, Trump said in December it “would be my commitment” to ensure the Food and Drug Administration does not remove access to abortion pills. Medication abortions accounted for 63% of abortions in the U.S. in 2023, according to the Guttmacher Institute.\n\nFurther Reading\n\nTexas Sues N.Y.

The notification was confirmed by a person familiar with the matter, who spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss it publicly.\n\nIt’s expected to be the first step in sweeping layoffs. President Donald Trump signed an executive order Tuesday that told agency leaders to plan for “large-scale reductions in force.”\n\nElon Musk, whom President Trump has given wide leeway to slash government spending with his Department of Government Efficiency, called Thursday for the elimination of whole agencies.\n\n“I think we do need to delete entire agencies as opposed to leave a lot of them behind,” Musk said via a videocall to the World Governments Summit in Dubai, United Arab Emirates. “If we don’t remove the roots of the weed, then it’s easy for the weed to grow back.”\n\nEverett Kelley, the president of the American Federation of Government Employees representing federal workers, said the administration “abused” the probation status of workers “to conduct a politically driven mass firing spree, targeting employees not because of performance, but because they were hired before Trump took office.”\n\nThursday’s order was an expansion of previous directions from OPM, which told agencies earlier this week that probationary employees should be fired if they weren’t meeting high standards. It’s not clear how many workers are currently in a probationary period. According to government data maintained by OPM, as of March 2024, 220,000 workers had less than a year on the job — the most recent data available.\n\nThe firing of probationary employees began earlier this week and has included the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and the Department of Education workers.\n\nAt least 39 were fired from the Education Department on Wednesday, according to a union that represents agency workers, including civil rights workers, special education specialists and student aid officials.\n\nThe layoffs also hit Department of Veterans Affairs researchers working on cancer treatment, opioid addiction, prosthetics and burn pit exposure, U.S. Sen. Patty Murray, a Democrat, said Thursday.\n\nMurray said in a statement that she heard from VA researchers in her state who were told to stop their research immediately, “not because their work isn’t desperately needed, but because Trump and Elon have decided to fire these researchers on a whim.”\n\nPublic Employees for Environmental Responsibility, a group that defends government workers, said the Agriculture Department’s Food Safety and Inspection Service would be hit especially hard by laying off probationary employees because it has trouble recruiting inspectors required to be present at all times at most slaughterhouses.\n\nThe civilian federal workforce , not including military personnel and postal workers, is made up of about 2.4 million people. While about 20% of the workers are in Washington D.C., and the neighboring states of Maryland and Virginia, more than 80% live outside the Capitol region.\n\nLayoffs are unlikely to yield significant deficit savings. When the Congressional Budget Office looked at the issue, it found the government spent $271 billion annually compensating civilian federal workers, with about 60% of that total going to workers employed by the departments of Defense, Homeland Security and Veterans Affairs.\n\nThe government could, in theory, cut all those workers and still run a deficit of over $1 trillion that would continue to grow as tax revenues are needed to keep up with the growing costs of Social Security and Medicare.\n\nElaine Kamarck, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, said firing employees on probation is flawed because it targets younger workers.\n\n“Baby Boomers are retiring right and left, so actually the people you want to keep are probably most of the people who are right now on probation,” said Kamarck, who worked in former President Bill Clinton’s Democratic administration when about 426,000 federal jobs were cut over more than eight years in a deliberative effort aimed at reinventing government. “They’re younger and presumably have better skills, and that’s who you want.”\n\nTrump’s initial attempt to downsize the workforce was the deferred resignation program, commonly described as a buyout, which offered to pay people until Sept. 30 if they agreed to quit. The White House said 75,000 people signed up, and a federal judge cleared a legal roadblock for the program Wednesday.\n\nHowever, the number of workers who took the offer was less than the administration’s target, and Trump has made it clear he would take further steps.\n\nEmployees at the National Science Foundation and Housing and Urban Development Department were told this week that large reductions, in some cases a halving of the workforce, would be coming, according to a person familiar with the situation who spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss it.\n\nThe order Trump signed Tuesday stipulated that government functions not required by law would be prioritized for cuts and hiring will be restricted. With exceptions for functions such as public safety, only one employee can be added for every four that leave. In addition, new hires would generally need approval from a representative of the DOGE, expanding the influence of Musk’s team.\n\nTrump has praised Musk’s work to slash federal spending.\n\nThe Republican president has also been sharply critical of federal workers, especially those who want to keep working remotely, though his administration is simultaneously working to cut federal office space and ordering the termination of worksite leases throughout the government.\n\n“Nobody is gonna work from home,” Trump said Monday. “They are gonna be going out, they’re gonna play tennis, they’re gonna play golf, they’re gonna do a lot of things. They’re not working.”\n\n(Copyright (c) 2024 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved.

If the user is in the United States, the body of water appeared as Gulf of America. If the user was physically in Mexico, it would appear as the Gulf of Mexico. In many other countries across the world it appears as “Gulf of Mexico (Gulf of America).”\n\nSheinbaum has repeatedly defended the name Gulf of Mexico, saying its use dates to 1607 and is recognized by the United Nations.\n\nShe has also mentioned that, according to the constitution of Apatzingán, the antecedent to Mexico’s first constitution, the North American territory was previously identified as “Mexican America”. Sheinbaum has used the example to poke fun at Trump and underscore the international implications of changing the Gulf’s name.\n\nIn that sense, Sheinbaum said on Thursday that the Mexican government would ask Google to make “Mexican America” pop up on the map when searched.\n\nThis is not the first time Mexicans and Americans have disagreed on the names of key geographic areas, such as the border river between Texas and the Mexican states of Chihuahua, Coahuila, Nuevo León and Tamaulipas. Mexico calls it Rio Bravo and for the United States it is the Rio Grande.\n\nThis week, the White House barred AP reporters from several events, including some in the Oval Office, saying it was because of the news agency’s policy on the name.

Devastating. That’s how Tetiana Prykhodko reacted when she heard about U.S. President Donald Trump’s plans to end the war in Ukraine, following his telephone conversation this week with and Russian President Vladamir Putin.\n\nDuring the election campaign, Trump promised to quickly end the war.\n\nOn Wednesday, Trump said he and Putin spent an hour on the phone and agreed to begin peace negotiations — and they promised to meet soon face to face.\n\nAt first non-committal about Ukraine being given a seat at the negotiating table, on Thursday Trump said Ukraine would be there. But officials with his administration have also said NATO membership will not be on the table and it is unrealistic for Ukraine to expect to given back all the land it has lost to Russia during the war — about a fifth of Ukrainian territory.\n\nPrykhodko, one of tens of thousands of Ukrainians who fled to Canada following the start of the war, said all Ukrainians want peace, but she asks, “At what cost?”\n\n“People are still being killed and are suffering — especially in the eastern parts of Ukraine,” said Prykhodko who was forced to flee her home town of Chernihiv, near the border with Russia and Belarus, on the day Putin ordered his army to invade.\n\n“When all the talking on TV was about, ‘You have to pack,’ I didn’t actually take it seriously,” added Prykhodko. “After I heard the sirens, and after I saw smoke from my window (I realized) it’s not a joke and we decided to move out. I have a sister in the western part of Ukraine and she called me that day and said. ‘You are coming to our place,’ so that is what we did.”\n\n“Lots of nearby villages suffered. Little girls being raped, people were killed, those who were imprisoned — awful things. I know really bad stories and it’s really hard to talk about them,” said Prykhodko.\n\nRealizing the war would last a lot longer than Putin originally boasted about, her family applied for, and were granted, visas to come to Canada. “My husband has a sister here and she told us, ‘You are coming here.'”\n\nThe reception her family has received in Canada has been “amazing,” said Prykhokdo. “Canada has been a wonderful place to come, and we received so much support and care.”\n\nWhile she, like most Ukrainians, yearns to one day return home, she is not optimistic about the prospects for peace under Trump’s and Putin’s terms.\n\nIt is “like a feeling of no way out — it will never end in a good way and that makes me sad — that is frustrating and devastating,” said Prykhokdo.\n\n“An overwhelming sense of disappointment — utter betrayal,” is how Stephania Romaniuk, vice-president of the Ukrainian Canadian Congress, describes the reaction of Calgary’s Ukrainian community to Trump’s comments on the terms for peace.\n\n“There’s so many lives that have been lost, not just people who’ve been killed, civilians, the military in Ukraine, but lives that have been shattered and destroyed,” said Romaniuk.\n\n“Perhaps we’re going to negotiate a peace, but at the cost of everything that these people have been fighting for.”\n\nWhile she is pleased Ukraine will be at the negotiating table, she fears Trump is “falling into Putin’s trap” — adding NATO membership for Ukraine is really the only guarantee against future Russian aggression.\n\n“We know that Russian diplomacy means nothing when Putin comes to the table,” said Romaniuk. “You can probably be guaranteed that he’s going to do the exact opposite of what he commits to — any peace deals are only going to be temporary, they’re going to be an opportunity for Russia to strengthen its forces, to prepare once again to mobilize.\n\n“Whether it’s five, 10, 15 years from now, they’re going to come again.”\n\nRomaniuk believes what’s happening in Ukraine should also be a warning for Canada.\n\n“We share a border with Russia. As Russia feels emboldened, if the results of these peace talks show to them that they can take what they want, they are not going to stop there.\n\n“There are resources in the Arctic — certainly the changing environment is going to have an impact on what can be extracted from there, so I think that Canada needs to be prepared.”\n\nFor Prykhodko and her family, it’s like a horror movie that won’t stop.\n\n“The peace that the Russians are offering — my biggest fear is I will have nowhere to come back to.

The company disputes most labor-related citations, and did not respond to requests for comment Thursday.\n\nCalifornia’s workplace-safety regulator, Cal/OSHA, did not immediately respond to questions about Tesla’s payment of fines.\n\nThe U.S. Labor Department’s Occupational Safety and Health Administration, which reports both federal and state findings about workplace-safety violations, has not cited Tesla for any purported violations.\n\nThe state-level regulatory action comes as Tesla CEO Musk works as a special government employee for President Donald Trump to dramatically — and critics say illegally — slash federal government spending and programs, including in agencies responsible for regulating the operations of Tesla, and of federal government contractor SpaceX, the rocket company he leads as CEO.\n\nThe Fremont plant has been the focus of numerous lawsuits over alleged rampant anti-Black racism in the facility, including one legal action by the federal Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, an agency expected to receive new commissioners appointed by Trump, potentially affecting the case.\n\nMusk’s government position will likely shield him from federal regulatory action, said Stanford Law professor emeritus William Gould, a labor law expert.\n\n“Musk is much less likely to face scrutiny at the federal level,” Gould said. “The relatively limited resources of California appear to be his only concern.”\n\nCalifornia worker-safety regulators also fined Tesla $23,560 last year over two alleged violations connected to a vehicle accident at the Fremont factory. One purported violation, deemed “serious,” related to the driver moving the vehicle when a person was in its path, and netted a $22,500 penalty. The other related to failure to establish, implement and maintain an effective program to prevent injury and illness. Tesla disputed both findings, according to the Labor Department.\n\nIn 2023, state regulators fined Tesla $149,000 for 11 alleged worker-safety violations, four classed as serious, at the Fremont facility. Tesla disputed all of them.\n\nTesla in 2022 was fined $112,065 over 19 alleged workplace safety violations — nearly all contested by Tesla — and four accidents in the Fremont factory. State regulators accused the company of repeated failure to properly train workers and report accidents involving serious injury.","summary":"The regulatory action comes as Tesla CEO Musk works as a special government employee for President Donald Trump to dramatically -- and critics say illegally -- slash federal government spending and programs, including in agencies responsible for regulating the operations of Tesla.","url":"https://www.mercurynews.com/2025/02/13/elon-musks-tesla-fined-alleged-serious-failure-protect-fremont-workers-excessive-heat/","image":"https://www.mercurynews.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/SJM-L-TESLA-XXXX-02.jpg?w=1024&h=683","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-02-14 00:25:31","author":"Ethan Baron","authors":["Ethan Baron"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.468},{"id":290287728,"title":"Trump vows 'fairness and reciprocity' during Modi's visit amid tariff woes","text":"President Donald Trump met Thursday with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and vowed to bring “fairness and reciprocity\" to their countries' economic relationship, which he said would involve reducing U.S. trade deficits and likely raising tariffs.As he has in recent meetings with other foreign leaders, Trump said he wanted to ensure that the U.S. erases global trade deficits. He said both the U.S. and India would begin negotiations to increase trade in coming weeks, but also said more U.S. tariffs on Indian goods might be coming from his administration.“Whatever India charges, we charge them,” Trump said at a joint news conference. “So frankly, it no longer matters to us that much what they charge.”He added, “Really, we want a certain level playing field.”As he has in the past, Modi lavished praised on Trump, saying that he's determined to “Make India Great Again,” or “MIGA.” That's a play on the president's “MAGA” or “Make America Great Again” catch phrase and movement.Trump also said he'd back extraditing one of the plotters of the 2008 Mumbai attacks, appeared to be referencing Tahawwur Hussain Rana who was convicted in 2011 in the U.S. for plotting an attack on a Danish newspaper.“He’s going to be going back to India to face justice,” Trump said, latter adding that “we’re giving him back to India immediately.\"Trump said more extraditions could be coming.Trump also said the U.S. would soon increase military sales in India by “many millions of dollars,” paving the way to ultimately provide India with the F-35 stealth fighter planes — something the country has long sought.The U.S. and India have a trade deficit of $50 billion in India’s favor. The Indo-U.S. goods and services trade totaled around $190.1 billion in 2023. According to India’s External Affairs Ministry, the U.S. exports to India were worth nearly $70 billion and imports $120 billion.Before the news conference, Trump and Modi greeted each with a hug in the lobby of the West Wing, then met in the Oval Office. The president called Modi a “great friend” despite just signing an order to increase tariffs to match the tax rates that other countries charge on imports, which affects American trading partners around the world — including India.Modi is looking to avoid U.S. tariffs and to improve relations with Washington and the West overall, which have been frosty lately after Modi refused to condemn Russia for its war on Ukraine.“The world had this thinking that India somehow is a neutral country in this whole process,” Modi said, praising Trump for speaking with Russia and Ukraine's leaders on Wednesday. “But this is not true. India has a side, and that side is of peace.”Trump, a Republican, previously imposed tariffs on China and says more are coming against the European Union, while threatening similar against Canada and Mexico and expanding tariffs on steel and aluminum he initially imposed during his first term.The White House insists that in signing Thursday's round of what Trump called “reciprocal\" tariffs, he is leveling the playing field between U.S. manufacturers and foreign competitors — though these new taxes would likely be paid by American consumers and businesses either directly or in the form of higher prices.Even prior to signing the new round of reciprocal tariffs, however, Trump objected to Indian tariffs. He repeatedly dubbed Modi's country a “tariff king.” At the White House, Modi called India's existing tariffs “unfair and very strong.”Even before Modi arrived, New Delhi showed willingness to buy more American oil and lower its own tariffs on U.S. goods, including on some Harley-Davidson motorcycles, from 50% to 40% — moves it took prior to Modi's coming to Washington.Also, India in 2023 dropped retaliatory tariffs on U.S. almonds, apples, chickpeas, lentils and walnuts.Trump has decried U.S. trade deficits around the world and said he'll work to shrink them, including during his meetings at the White House last week with Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba.Modi is the fourth foreign leader to visit Trump since his inauguration last month, following Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Ishiba of Japan and Jordan's King Abdullah II.Prior to meeting with Trump, Modi sat down with national security adviser Mike Waltz. He also met with billionaire SpaceX founder and top Trump administration official Elon Musk.RELATED STORY | Trump announces plan for reciprocal tariffs on US trade partnersWhile signing the tariffs order in the Oval Office, Trump was asked if Musk spoke with Modi as a government worker or a tech magnate, amid concerns the meeting was related to the billionaire’s business dealings.“India is a very hard place to do business because of the tariffs. They have the highest tariffs, just about in the world, and it’s a hard place to do business,\" Trump said. \"No, I would imagine he met possibly because, you know, he’s running a company.”Modi and Trump were also likely to use their upcoming discussions to talk about immigration. There, the prime minister can point to India's having accepted the return of 104 migrants brought back on a U.S. military plane — the first such flight to the country as part of the Trump administration's crackdown on immigration and the U.S.-Mexico border.For the Trump administration, meanwhile, India is seen as integral to the U.S. strategy of containing China in the Indo-Pacific. Modi's country is hosting a summit of a group of countries known as the Quad — made up of the U.S., India, Japan and Australia — later this year.","summary":"President Donald Trump met Thursday with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and vowed to bring “fairness and reciprocity\" to their countries' economic relationship","url":"https://www.scrippsnews.com/politics/president-trumps-first-100-days/trump-vows-fairness-and-reciprocity-during-modis-visit-amid-tariff-woes","image":"https://ewscripps.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/efa0233/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3943x2070+0+21/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fewscripps-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F31%2Fa7%2F278b15f844b385bf6d9e5ae15beb%2Fap25044858029704.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-02-14 00:23:47","author":"AP via Scripps News","authors":["AP via Scripps News"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.046},{"id":290286368,"title":"Candace Owens Takes Australia to High Court Over Visa Ban","text":"Candace Owens is at the centre of a free speech battle, challenging the Australian government’s decision to ban her from entering the country, by taking her case to the High Court.\n\nThe prominent U.S. commentator was set to tour Australia in March 2024, but the Albanese government blocked her visa, citing concerns that her views could “incite discord.”\n\n“The bad news is that we have to bump that tour to the fall, but the good news is the reason why,” she said.\n\n“We appealed our case to the High Court, which is essentially their Supreme Court.

Ford on Wednesday in a discussion of waste, reviving complaints about the aircraft carrier's engineering.In remarks following the swearing-in of the new Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard, Trump deviated unexpectedly into carrier catapults and elevators, among other topics.\"Look at the Gerald Ford, the aircraft carrier,\" Trump said. \"It was supposed to cost 3 billion. It ends up costing like 18 billion.'The USS Gerald Ford is the world's largest aircraft carrier and the first ship of the new Ford-class carriers.The $13 billion vessel set sail on its first deployment in 2022 after years of delays and soaring costs, which stemmed from technological integration challenges.\"We had 23 new technologies on that ship, which quite frankly increased the risk … of delivery on time and cost right from the get-go,\" former Chief of Naval Operations Adm. Michael Gilday said in 2022, acknowledging the tech troubles.Issues included the electromagnetic aircraft launch system (EMALS) and the advanced weapons elevators. These systems now appear to work sufficiently. The carrier was able to complete a successful extended deployment in early 2024 that took it to the Eastern Mediterranean in the fall of 2023, just after the October 7 Hamas attack on Israel. But the president still has concerns about the technology.Trump knocked the ship's \"electric catapults\" as faulty on Thursday, telling listeners that they \"don't work.\" He has previously said the EMALS is too complicated and that sailors have to be Albert Einstein to work the system. He has pushed for steam catapults, which is what the Nimitz-class carriers use.The new EMALS technology hasn't been without problems. In 2020, the catapults failed inexplicably, hamstringing flight operations for the better part of a week.Naval Air Systems announced in the summer of 2022 that the EMALS and advanced arresting gear on the Ford had facilitated 10,000 aircraft launches and recoveries, indicating a shift away from earlier tech woes. Trump's concerns extend beyond the EMALS though.\"And they have all magnetic elevators,\" Trump continued in his remarks Thursday on the Ford's technology. \"They lift up 25 planes at a time, 20 planes at a time,\" he said, seemingly referring to the massive elevators designed to move military aircraft. The Ford has three aircraft elevators and 11 advanced weapons elevators, dedicated to moving heavy ordnance like bombs and missiles.The weapons elevators, which rely on electromagnetic motors instead of cables and pulleys, were a problem during his first term in office. The shipbuilder resolved the issues prior to delivering the carrier to the Navy.Trump has had a lot to say about the Ford over the years. Privately, he's also expressed concerns about the way it looks.The Navy has one Ford-class carrier in service, one being readied for later delivery, two under construction, and two in planning. It's unclear if the White House intends to make changes to naval engineering and construction efforts. The Navy did not provide comment on the president's remarks, and there was no immediate response from the White House.Trump has previously signaled his intent to have the new Department of Government Efficiency look into the military, adding Wednesday that when \"you look at the kind of waste, fraud, and abuse that this country is going through … we have to straighten it out.\" His National Security Advisor, Mike Waltz, criticized US shipbuilding over the weekend as an \"absolute mess.\"","summary":"Trump criticized the elevators and catapults on the US Navy aircraft carrier USS Gerald R.

Before quitting, Danielle Sassoon told President Donald Trump’s new attorney general that she was “confident” Adams had committed the crimes.\n\nTwo senior Justice Department officials also resigned after the department leadership moved to seize control of the case. The acting deputy U.S. attorney general, former Trump personal lawyer Emil Bove, who had ordered the Adams case dropped, said in a letter accepting Sassoon’s resignation that the Justice Department in Washington would file a motion to drop the charges and bar “further targeting” of the Democratic mayor.\n\nSassoon, a Republican serving as interim U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York, announced her resignation in an email to her staff. The move, confirmed by a spokesperson for the office, came after a dayslong standoff between the Manhattan prosecutor and her superiors in Washington.\n\nThe dueling letters from officials in New York and Washington laid bare in starkly personal language the gravity of a simmering, behind-the-scenes dispute over the handling of one of the government’s most significant current public corruption cases. The outcome not only threatens to create an irrevocable fissure in the relationship between the department’s headquarters and its most prestigious prosecutorial offices, but also risks reinforcing the perception that Trump’s administration will employ a transactional approach to law enforcement decisions.\n\n“I remain baffled by the rushed and superficial process by which this decision was reached,” Sassoon wrote Wednesday in a letter to U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi, a copy of which was obtained by The Associated Press. Sassoon urged Bondi to reconsider the directive to drop Adams' case.\n\nWith Sassoon refusing to comply with the Trump administration’s order, the department’s public integrity section was asked to take over the case, according to a person familiar with the matter. Two senior officials who oversee the unit, including the acting chief, resigned in response, according to the person, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss personnel matters.\n\nThe exits came days after Bove directed federal prosecutors in New York to end the case against Adams, who was accused of accepting illegal campaign contributions and bribes of free or discounted travel from people who wanted to buy his influence. He has pleaded not guilty.\n\nBove said in a memo Monday that the case should be dismissed so Adams could aid President Donald Trump’s immigration crackdown and campaign for reelection free from facing criminal charges. The primary is four months away and Adams has multiple challengers.\n\nBove scolded Sassoon in a letter accepting her resignation. He wrote that she was “incapable of fairly and impartially reviewing the circumstances of this prosecution.” Bove said he would open internal investigations into her “conduct” and that of prosecutors who worked on the Adams case. They will be placed on “off-duty, administrative leave,” he said.\n\nBove had directed Sassoon to drop Adams' case as soon as “practicable,” but there have been no public statements or actions by the prosecution team. On Wednesday, Bondi said she would “look into” why the case had yet to be dismissed. As of Thursday afternoon, the charges remained in place.\n\nIn her letter to Bondi, Sassoon accused Adams’ lawyers of repeatedly and explicitly offering what amounted to a “quid pro quo” during a meeting with the Justice Department last month. She wrote that the lawyers had offered the mayor’s assistance with the Trump administration’s immigration enforcement priorities if the case were to be dismissed.\n\n“It is a breathtaking and dangerous precedent to reward Adams’s opportunistic and shifting commitments on immigration and other policy matters with dismissal of a criminal indictment,” Sassoon wrote. She calling the purported offer “an improper offer of immigration enforcement assistance in exchange for a dismissal of his case.”\n\nIn an email, Adams' lawyer, Alex Spiro, said the allegation of a quid pro quo was a “total lie.”\n\n“We offered nothing and the department asked nothing of us,” Spiro said. “We were asked if the case had any bearing on national security and immigration enforcement and we truthfully answered it did.”\n\nThe department’s decision to end the Adams case because of political considerations, rather than the strength or weakness of the evidence, alarmed some career prosecutors who said it was a departure from long-standing norms.\n\nThe directive from Bove, was all the more remarkable because Bove had been a longtime prosecutor and supervisor in the Southern District and because department leaders are historically reluctant to intervene in cases where charges have been brought.\n\nBove’s memo also steered clear of any legal basis for the dismissal despite decades of department tradition dictating that charging decisions are to be guided by facts, evidence and the law.\n\nSassoon, a former clerk for the late U.S. Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia, was not the prosecutor who brought the case against Adams last year. That was then-U.S. Attorney Damian Williams, who stepped down after Trump’s election victory in November.\n\nSassoon had only been tapped to serve as acting U.S. attorney on Jan. 21, the day after Trump took office.\n\nHer role was intended to be temporary. Trump in November nominated Jay Clayton, the former chairman of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, to the post, an appointment that must be confirmed by the Senate. That has not happened yet.\n\nThe Southern District of New York is among the largest and most prominent prosecutor’s offices in the U.S., with a long track record of tackling Wall Street malfeasance, political corruption and international terrorism. It has a tradition of independence from Washington, something that has earned it the nickname “the sovereign district.”\n\nThis is the second Justice Department tussle in five years between Washington and New York officials to result in a dramatic leadership turnover.\n\nIn 2020, William Barr, who served as one of Trump’s attorneys general during his first term pushed out Geoffrey Berman, the U.S. attorney in Manhattan, in a surprise nighttime announcement. Berman initially refused to resign his position, creating a brief standoff with Barr, but did so after an assurance that his investigations into allies of Trump would not be disturbed.\n\nAdams was indicted in September on charges that while he worked as Brooklyn borough president, he accepted over $100,000 in illegal campaign contributions and lavish travel perks such as expensive flight upgrades, luxury hotel stays and even a trip to a bathhouse.\n\nThe indictment said a Turkish official who helped facilitate the trips then leaned on Adams for favors, including asking him to lobby the Fire Department to let a newly constructed, 36-story diplomatic building open in time for a planned visit by Turkey’s president.\n\nProsecutors said they had proof that Adams personally directed political aides to solicit foreign donations and disguise them to help the campaign qualify for a city program that provides a generous, publicly-funded match for small dollar donations. Under federal law, foreign nationals are banned from contributing to U.S. election campaigns.\n\nAs recently as Jan. 6, prosecutors had indicated their investigation remained active, writing in court papers that they continued to “uncover additional criminal conduct by Adams.”\n\nBove said in his memo that Justice Department officials in Washington hadn’t evaluated the evidence in the case before deciding it should be dropped — at least until after the mayoral election coming in November.\n\nBut he criticized “recent public actions” by Williams that he said had “threatened the integrity of the proceedings, including by increasing prejudicial pretrial publicity.” Williams hasn’t spoken publicly about the Adams case since his resignation, but wrote an editorial decrying corruption in politics.\n\nFederal agents had also been investigating other senior Adams aides. It was unclear what will happen to that side of the probe.","summary":"Adams has been accused of accepting illegal campaign contributions and bribes.","url":"https://www.syracuse.com/state/2025/02/prosecutor-who-quit-after-refusing-to-drop-eric-adams-case-is-confident-he-committed-the-crimes.html","image":"https://www.syracuse.com/resizer/v2/KRDJLFW4SJCNZKL6TKJZ6BK7N4.jpg?auth=4040b63c2ebabe4665d7db70b7ec58d32d24cdd63d7ca2ed2bc78d0e29077507&width=1280&quality=90","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-02-14 00:17:04","author":"The Associated Press","authors":["The Associated Press"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.198},{"id":290285584,"title":"Modi meets Trump amid tariff tensions","text":"Prime Minister Narendra Modi met Donald Trump on Thursday for the first time since Trump returned to the White House. The two leaders reaffirmed their strong bond amid concerns over Trump’s reciprocal tariff plans, which could significantly impact India.\n\nHours before the meeting, Trump unveiled a plan to raise US tariffs to match those imposed by other countries, singling out India as one of the highest tariff-charging nations. “They charge more tariffs than any other country,” he stated on Thursday. \n\nThe US is India’s largest trading partner, while India ranks as the US’s 10th-largest, according to data from the US Census Bureau and India’s Commerce Ministry. Bilateral trade exceeded $119.7 billion in fiscal 2023-24, with India posting a $32 billion surplus.\n\nAhead of Modi’s visit, Indian media reported that New Delhi hoped recent import duty cuts, announced in its annual budget, along with additional reductions, would help ease the Trump administration’s concerns that India is a “tariff abuser.” Reports indicated that India was preparing detailed fact sheets on import duties for major US exports and considering further reductions on “items of US interest” such as pecan nuts, primarily grown in the southwestern US.\n\nTrump, however, has not only announced reciprocal tariffs, but has also doubled down on his criticism of BRICS and its plans to trade while bypassing the US dollar. “BRICS was put there for a bad purpose... I told them if they want to play games with the dollar, they are going to be hit by a 100% tariff,” he warned. Reiterating his stance, he added, “BRICS is dead the minute I mentioned that if they mess with the dollar, they will get 100% tariffs. BRICS is dead.” These remarks were made just ahead of Trump’s scheduled meeting with Modi, despite India being a founding BRICS member.\n\nIllegal immigration was another topic expected to be discussed. Last week, the US deported 104 Indians on a military C-17 transport aircraft. A video released by US authorities showing deportees in handcuffs and leg restraints sparked outrage in India, prompting New Delhi to assure that it was engaging with the US federal government to ensure “the returning deportees are not mistreated.”\n\nDuring a White House press conference, Trump called Modi “a great friend of mine for a long time” and emphasized their “very big things to talk about,” particularly India’s energy imports. “We have more oil and gas than any other country in the world by far. They need it, and we have it,” he said.\n\nTrump also praised Modi: “It has been a real honor to see you. You have been my friend for a long time.

Like President Trump, it is a great fortune for me to keep the interests of India supreme and work.”\n\nModi is among the first world leaders to visit the US after Trump’s inauguration, having been invited within three weeks of the new administration taking office.\n\nDuring his visit, Modi held separate meeting with US National Security Advisor Michael Waltz, tech enterpeneaur and co-head of the Department of Government Efficiency or DOGE Elon Musk as well as Republican leader Vivek Ramaswamy.

On trade, Trump and Modi are expected to discuss ways to better the U.S.-India trade relationship and reduce the bilateral trade deficit.\n\nThe president notably signed a major memorandum just hours before the meeting announcing a plan to impose reciprocal tariffs against every country that imposes them on the United States.\n\n“And on trade, I have decided, for purposes of fairness, that I will charge a reciprocal tariff, meaning whatever countries charge the United States of America, we will charge them. No more, no less,” Trump said.\n\n“In other words, they charge us a tax or tariff, and we charge them the exact same tax or tariff,” he added.\n\nAs for regional partnerships, Trump administration officials said he and Modi are expected to discuss bolstering the Quad partnership between the United States, India, Japan, and Australia to foster Indo-Pacific peace and stability.\n\nOne official noted the significance of the U.S.-India relationship in America’s Indo-Pacific strategy, noting there are geopolitical and economic elements at play.\n\n“This is, some might argue, one of the most critical, if not the most critical bilateral relationship, of the 21st century,” the official said. “President Trump is going to do his part, I can assure, to ensure that that remains a foundational element moving forward in this term.”","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nWASHINGTON—Senior Trump administration officials say President Donald Trump and Indian Prime Minister&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Preview of the Meeting Between President Trump and Indian Prime Minister Modi by Trump Administration Officials first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/news/preview-of-the-meeting-between-president-trump-and-indian-prime-minister-modi-by-trump-administration-officials/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/ic_launcher.png","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-02-14 00:13:58","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.046},{"id":290282666,"title":"US deports 119 migrants from a variety of nations to Panama","text":"PANAMA CITY (AP) — Panama has received the first U.S. flight carrying deportees from other nations as the Trump administration takes Panama up on its offer to act as a stopover for expelled migrants, the Central American nation’s president said Thursday.\n\n“Yesterday a flight from the United States Air Force arrived with 119 people from diverse nationalities of the world,” President José Raúl Mulino said Thursday in his weekly press briefing.

The vote, 72-28, fell largely along party lines, although some Democrats who initially supported her, voted against her final confirmation.\n\nRollins' confirmation has been at the forefront of Senate conversations since her nomination, amid President Donald Trump's imposition of tariffs on countries that ship agricultural products to the United States, including Mexico. Given the tariff talks, the Senate was under some pressure to vote on her confirmation quickly.\n\nSen. Peter Welch, D-Vt., voted in favor of Rollins, but said \"a lot of Democrats\" have voted against most of Trump's Cabinet nominees in response to the president following through on his campaign promise to slash the size of the federal workforce.\n\n\"There's a lot of outrage about Trump's unlawful conduct,\" Welch told Politico.\n\nRollins is not a newcomer to the Trump administration. She was a high level domestic policy adviser to the president in his first term. This time around, her role will be much more high profile. She will oversee a department with 100,000 employees and a budget of more than $200 billion.\n\nShe will also be in charge of the USDA's nutrition programs, rural development initiatives, safety net programs for farmers and the country's response to the avian flu outbreak.\n\nAg industry leaders were encouraged by her confirmation, citing her position on free trade and export policies.\n\n\"At a time when the American agricultural economy is facing immense problems, including rising input costs, global competition, and uncertain market conditions, Secretary Rollins' leadership will be critical in ensuring that U.S. farmers and ranchers remain competitive,\" Brian Kuehl, Executive Director of Farmers for Free Trade said in a statement.\n\n\"Trade is central to American agriculture, with exports accounting for a significant portion of farm revenue. With key partners like Canada, Mexico, and China purchasing half of all U.S. agricultural exports, it is imperative that we maintain and expand our access to these markets.\"\n\nOther agriculture organizations were also supportive, including the National Farmers Union. President Rob Larew cited Rollins' rural Texas roots, her support for family farmers and ranchers and efforts to advance measures to require country-of-origin labeling for beef as reasons for the NFU's support.\n\nHer critics have called her \"deeply antagonistic\" to people seeking federal assistance, and say she will make it harder for people in need to get help.\n\n\"We are facing a growing hunger crisis in our country, and we have strong reason to believe that Rollins would use this perch to make poverty and hardship significantly worse,\" said Abby Leibman, president and CEO of MAZON, a Jewish group devoted to fighting, when Rollins was nominated to the post.\n\nHer supporters in the Senate, including W.V. Republican Jim Justice, praised her work ethic in a committee hearing prior to her advancing.\n\n\"She's stuck on on,\" Justice said during the hearing.","summary":"The Senate Thursday confirmed Brooke Rollins to be the U.S. Secretary of Agriculture.
