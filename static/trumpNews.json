Doocy, a senior White House correspondent, posted multiple videos to X on Wednesday showing him questioning Biden and the White House about the then-president's cognitive decline. \"I have some unique insight on President Biden, having dedicated six years of my life to covering him,\" he wrote. \"If you are wondering why nobody asked about his mental fitness, and why nobody asked if White House staffers were covering up his decline… then you weren’t paying attention.\" WASHINGTON POST URGES CONGRESS TO ACT TO PREVENT ANOTHER COVER-UP OF PRESIDENT'S HEALTH AMID BIDEN REVELATIONS In one video, Doocy is seen questioning Biden about Special Counsel Robert Hur's report that concluded that one of the reasons Biden wasn't charged for his handling of classified Obama-era documents found in his former office and at home was because he was a \"well-meaning, elderly man with a poor memory.\" \"I'm well-meaning and I'm an elderly man and I know what the hell I'm doing. I put this country back on its feet. I don't need his recommendation,\" Biden replied. Doocy then asked how bad Biden's memory was and would he be able to continue to serve as president. \"My memory is so bad, I let you speak,\" Biden shot back. Much of the media has been criticized for its reluctance to question Biden or the White House about his health concerns. The former president's health is once again in the headlines after CNN anchor Jake Tapper and Axios correspondent Alex Thompson's new book, \"Original Sin: President Biden's Decline, Its Cover-Up, and His Disastrous Choice to Run Again,\" was released on Tuesday. The book alleges that Biden’s inner circle concealed his cognitive decline for years and was released just days after news broke that Biden had been diagnosed with advanced prostate cancer. In one instance, during a news briefing, Doocy questioned then-White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre about a campaign event in which Biden was present. \"At a fundraiser this week, President Biden told donors about how Charlottesville inspired his campaign, and according to the pool, a few mins later he told the story again nearly word for word. What's up with that?\" CBS NEWS REPORTER SAYS WSJ'S 'COURAGEOUS' 2024 REPORT ON BIDEN'S DECLINE SHOULD HAVE WON THE PULITZER \"What I can tell you is, and I'm going to be careful not to talk about it because this was a campaign event,… the president was making very clear why he decided to run in 2019,\" Jean-Pierre responded. In another briefing, Jean-Pierre said Biden was making a \"light-hearted joke\" and \"speaking off the cuff\" when she was asked by Doocy about Biden's remarks that his \"health is fine. It's just his brain.\" In another video, Jean-Pierre was asked about Biden's gaffe when he appeared to mix up French President Emmanuel Macron with François Mitterrand, the former president of France who died in 1996. \"How is President Biden ever going to convince the three-quarters of voters who are worried about his physical and mental health that he's OK even though in Las Vegas he told a story about recently talking to a French president who died in 1996?\" WALL STREET JOURNAL CALLS OUT TAPPER FOR SNEERING AT PAPER'S STORY ABOUT BIDEN'S DECLINE \"I'm not even going to go down that rabbit hole with you,\" she replied. Doocy also asked if Biden had been tested for Parkinson's Disease or dementia following his disastrous debate performance against then-candidate Donald Trump. \"What we shared with you was comprehensive, but he's had a full physical. We've shown the results of those this past three years,\" Jean-Pierre said. \"We showed it just four months ago, and it is in line with what we have done, similar to President Obama, similar to George W. Bush. We are committed to continue to be transparent. We are committed to continue to show the results of those physicals, and look, it's the president's medical team that makes a decision.\" In another briefing, Jean-Pierre was questioned about why Biden was treated by White House staffers \"like a baby.\" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP \"No one treated the president of the United States, the commander-in-chief, like a baby,\" she replied. \"That's a ridiculous claim.\" Fox News Digital's Kristine Parks contributed to this report.","summary":"Insightful videos by Peter Doocy raise questions about Joe Biden&apos;s mental acuity and media&apos;s reluctance to address his health concerns.","url":"https://www.foxnews.com/politics/fox-news-peter-doocy-reveals-history-questioning-bidens-mental-fitness","image":"https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2024/05/931/523/president-biden-philadelphia.jpg?ve=1&tl=1","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-05-22 01:04:42","author":"Louis Casiano","authors":["Louis Casiano"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.236},{"id":323509868,"title":"China Warns Trump’s ‘Golden Dome’ Proposal Could Lead to Space Becoming a ‘Conflict Zone’","text":"The Chinese government has expressed concerns over US President Donald Trump’s proposed “Golden Dome” missile defense system, claiming it could lead to the militarization of space.

Trump also presented Ramaphosa with documents he claimed were accounts of killings of \"thousands\" of Afrikaners. Ramaphosa offered multiple denials to the claims and made it clear the statements made in the videos were not representative of his government's policies.

The announcement quickly led to multiple world leaders, including President Donald Trump, to state their support for Biden and his family and to wish for the former president's speedy recovery. But Biden's announcement has also led to confusion and speculation from journalists and the public over the president's disease history, including how long the Biden family has known about his diagnosis. \"President Biden’s announcement Sunday that he has stage 4 prostate cancer, which has spread to his bones, is a sad moment for the country, and we wish him and his family the best for treatment and prognosis,\" The Wall Street Journal editorial board wrote Tuesday. \"But Mr. Biden owes the public more information, given that he left office only 120 days ago, after telling voters he was fit to stay through 2029 and age 86.\" BIDEN'S 'LAST KNOWN' PROSTATE CANCER SCREENING WAS OVER A DECADE AGO, AS QUESTIONS MOUNT OVER DIAGNOSIS \"A spokesperson told the press Tuesday that Mr. Biden’s last known PSA blood test, which screens for prostate specific antigen, was in 2014,\" the editorial board continued, referring to a statement widely shared from Biden's press office. The PSA test is a blood test used primarily to screen for prostate cancer. The test measures the amount of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) in the blood, according to the Mayo Clinic. The editorial board pointed out that while some men do miss the symptoms of prostate cancer, Biden was campaigning for re-election, meaning that he would have stayed in office for another four years.

Fox News Digital took a look at what the key factions have been looking for. HOUSE FREEDOM CAUCUS HEADING TO WHITE HOUSE AFTER DELAY PLAY ON TRUMP'S 'BIG, BEAUTIFUL BILL' Conservative fiscal hawks The House Freedom Caucus and their allies have been pushing the bill to go further on curbing Medicaid’s Affordable Care Act (ACA) expansion, and implementing work requirements for able-bodied Americans on the government healthcare program sooner than the current bill’s 2029 deadline. There’s broad consensus among Republicans on needing work requirements for able-bodied Americans on healthcare, but cutting too deeply into the Obamacare-era expanded population has some moderate GOP lawmakers worried. The conservatives have consistently argued that they are only seeking to reshuffle the program to make it more available for vulnerable people who truly need it, including low-income women and children. That same group has argued in favor of a total repeal of President Joe Biden’s green energy tax credits in the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) – a push that has pitted them against Republicans whose districts have businesses that benefitted from those subsidies. DEMS WARN HOUSE REPUBLICANS WILL PAY PRICE AT BALLOT BOX FOR PASSING TRUMP'S 'BIG BEAUTIFUL BILL' Blue state tax critics Moderate Republicans in California, New York, and New Jersey have been taking a stand on raising the state and local tax (SALT) deduction cap. SALT deduction caps primarily benefit people living in high-cost-of-living areas like New York City, Los Angeles, and their surrounding suburbs. Republicans representing those areas have argued that raising the SALT deduction cap is an existential issue — and that a failure to address it could cost the GOP the House majority in the 2026 midterms. Several of the Republicans vying for higher SALT deduction caps have pointed out that their victories are critical to the party retaining control of the House in 2024. SALT deduction caps did not exist before Trump’s 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA), which notably instilled a $10,000 ceiling for married and single tax filers. That cap has been received positively by the majority of Republicans, however – and those in lower-tax, GOP-controlled states have dismissed the push for a higher SALT deduction cap as an unearned reward for Democratic states with high-tax policies. Republicans in places like Tennessee and Missouri have argued it was their tax dollars subsidizing wealthier, blue-leaning areas’ tax breaks. Blue state Republicans, meanwhile, have contended that they send more tax dollars back to the federal government which in turn helps pay for lower-tax states. Inflation Reduction Act hopefuls There is some overlap between Republicans looking for more modest cuts to the IRA and those seeking a higher SALT deduction cap – but not completely. Republicans in swing districts in Arizona and Pennsylvania have argued that upending those tax credits now would harm businesses in their districts that had begun changing their operations already to conform to those new tax breaks. In March, 21 House Republicans signed a letter urging their colleagues to preserve the green energy tax credit. \"Countless American companies are utilizing sector-wide energy tax credits – many of which have enjoyed broad support in Congress – to make major investments in domestic energy production and infrastructure for traditional and renewable energy sources alike,\" they wrote. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP But conservative fiscal hawks pushing for a total repeal said in their own letter that the U.S.' growing green energy sector was the product of government handouts rather than genuine sustainable growth. \"Leaving IRA subsidies intact will actively undermine America’s return to energy dominance and national security,\" they said. \"They are the result of government subsidies that distort the U.S. energy sector, displace reliable coal and natural gas and the domestic jobs they produce, and put the stability and independence of our electric grid in jeopardy.\"","summary":"GOP factions clash over Medicaid, SALT, and green energy tax credits as Speaker Mike Johnson seeks unity on major legislative bill.","url":"https://www.foxnews.com/politics/house-republicans-divided-trumps-comprehensive-bill-faces-critical-vote","image":"https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2025/01/931/523/trump-capitol-security.jpg?ve=1&tl=1","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-05-22 00:59:15","author":"Elizabeth Elkind","authors":["Elizabeth Elkind"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.032},{"id":323508136,"title":"World News | Netanyahu Promises New Gaza Aid Delivery Plan as Supplies Still Fail to Reach Palestinians","text":"Deir Al-Balah, (Gaza Strip), May 22 (AP) The U.N said Wednesday it was trying to get the desperately needed aid that has entered Gaza this week into the hands of Palestinians amid delays because of fears of looting and Israeli military restrictions. Israeli strikes pounded the territory, killing at least 86 people, according to Gaza's Health Ministry. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu announced that the country is days away from implementing a new aid system in Gaza that has come under heavy international criticism. He said Israel later plans to create a “sterile zone” there, free of Hamas, where the population, which has repeatedly evacuated and relocated throughout the war, would be moved and receive supplies. Also Read | US Deportations: Boston Judge Says Donald Trump Admin Violated Court Order on Deportations to Third Countries. With renewed ceasefire talks appearing to make little progress, Netanyahu said he will end the war only if Hamas releases all hostages and steps down from power — and if President Donald Trump's plan to relocate the territory's population outside Gaza is implemented. The Palestinians, along with nearly all of the international community, have rejected Trump's plan to empty Gaza of its Palestinian population and place the territory under U.S. control. Under international pressure, Israel has allowed dozens of aid trucks into Gaza after blocking all food, medicine, fuel and other material for nearly three months. But the supplies have been sitting on the Gaza side of the Kerem Shalom crossing with Israel. Also Read | US Shocker: Elderly Woman Shoots Son Over Loud Video Game Noise at Home, Dumps Gun in Canal in Arizona; Arrested. U.N. spokesman Stephane Dujarric said the majority of supplies that had entered since Monday had been loaded onto U.N. trucks, but they could not take them out of the crossing area. He said the road the Israeli military had given them permission to use was too unsafe. A U.N. official later said more than a dozen trucks that left the crossing area arrived at warehouses in central Gaza on Wednesday night. The official spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to talk to the press. Israel said 100 trucks had crossed into Gaza on Wednesday. Food security experts have warned that Gaza risks falling into famine unless the blockade ends. Malnutrition and hunger have been mounting. Aid groups ran out of food to distribute weeks ago, and most of the population of around 2.3 million relies on communal kitchens whose supplies are nearly depleted. At a kitchen in Gaza City, a charity group distributed watery lentil soup. Somaia Abu Amsha scooped small portions for her family, saying they have not had bread for over 10 days and she can't afford rice or pasta. “We don't want anything other than that they end the war. We don't want charity kitchens. Even dogs wouldn't eat this, let alone children,” she said. Aid groups say the small amount of aid that Israel has allowed is far short of what is needed. About 600 trucks entered daily under the latest ceasefire. Netanyahu says population will be moved south Israel has said its slight easing of the blockade is a bridge until the new aid system it demands is put in place. The U.N. and other humanitarian groups have rejected the system, saying it enables Israel to use aid as a weapon and forcibly displace the population. Netanyahu told reporters the plan will begin “in coming days.” He said in a later phase, the “sterile zone” in southern Gaza would be free of Hamas and the population would be moved there “for the purposes of its safety.” There, they would receive aid, “and then they enter – and they don't necessarily go back.” The plan involves small number of distribution hubs directed by a private, U.S.-backed foundation known as the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation. Armed private contractors would guard the distribution. Israel says the system is needed because Hamas siphons off significant amounts of aid. The U.N. denies that claim. Initially, four hubs are being built, one in central Gaza and three at the far southern end of the strip, where few people remain. A GHF spokesman said the group would never participate in or support any form of forced relocation of civilians. The spokesman, speaking on condition of anonymity in accordance with the group's rules. said there was no limit to the number of sites and additional sites will open, including in the north, within the next month. Israeli warning shots shake diplomats Israeli troops fired warning shots as a group of international diplomats was visiting the Jenin refugee camp in the Israeli-occupied West Bank. Footage showed a number of diplomats giving media interviews as rapid shots ring out nearby, forcing them to run for cover. No one was reported injured. The Israeli military said their visit had been approved, but the delegation “deviated from the approved route.” The military said it apologized and will contact the countries involved in the visit. The soldiers' actions were roundly criticized as officials from Italy, Austria and Germany were among those demanding that Israel investigate what happened. Foreign ministers in Canada and France called for the Israeli ambassador to be summoned to provide an explanation. Israeli troops have raided Jenin dozens of times as part of a crackdown across the West Bank. The fighting displaced tens of thousands of Palestinians. The trickle of aid is jammed Currently, after supplies enter at Kerem Shalom, aid workers are required to unload them and reload them onto their own trucks for distribution. Antoine Renard, the World Food Program's country chief for Palestine, said 78 trucks were waiting. He told The Associated Press that “we need to ensure that we will not be looted.” Looting has plagued aid deliveries in the past, and at times of desperation people have swarmed aid trucks, taking supplies. A U.N. official and another humanitarian worker said the Israeli military had designated a highly insecure route known to have looters. The military also set a short window for trucks to come to Kerem Shalom and rejected a number of individual truck drivers, forcing last-minute replacements, they said. Both spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to talk to the press. COGAT, the Israeli defense body overseeing aid for Gaza, did not immediately respond when asked for comment. Hospitals surrounded Israeli strikes continued across Gaza. In the southern city of Khan Younis, where Israel recently ordered new evacuations pending an expanded offensive, 24 people were killed, 14 from the same family. A week-old infant was killed in central Gaza. In the evening, a strike hit a house in Jabaliya in northern Gaza, killing two children and their parents, according to hospital officials. The Israeli military did not comment on the strikes. It says it targets Hamas infrastructure and accuses Hamas militants of operating from civilian areas. Israeli troops also have surrounded two of northern Gaza's last functioning hospitals, preventing anyone from leaving or entering the facilities, hospital staff and aid groups said this week. The war in Gaza began when Hamas-led militants attacked southern Israel, killing some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and abducting 251 others. The militants are still holding 58 captives, around a third believed to be alive, after most were returned in ceasefire agreements or other deals. Israel's retaliatory offensive has destroyed large swaths of Gaza and killed more than 53,000 Palestinians, mostly women and children, according to Gaza's Health Ministry, which doesn't differentiate between civilians and combatants in its count.

And you did damn well in the pros, too. He was great. Despite being on the Jets, you did damn well.\" Tebow was drafted 25th overall by the Denver Broncos in 2010, and in his sophomore season, he found the late Demaryius Thomas on an 88-yard touchdown in overtime of the NFL playoffs. Denver, though, signed Peyton Manning in the offseason, leading the team to trade him to Gang Green. His role with the Jets was heavily debated, with coaches saying he'd be used both on special teams and in a wildcat formation. He lasted just one season, during which he had just eight pass attempts and never touched an NFL field again.

Andrew Cuomo is the target of a criminal investigation by the Justice Department.\n\nApparently, Cuomo doesn’t believe that being investigated by President Donald Trump’s administration is a political liability. Quite the opposite, in fact. \n\nBy Wednesday, Cuomo – who is running to become the next mayor of New York City – was running a political advertisement touting the investigation as a badge of honor.\n\n“If Donald Trump doesn’t want Andrew Cuomo as mayor,” the ad concludes, “you do.”\n\nThe ad mentions the recent arrests of Judge Hannah Dugan in Wisconsin, accused of helping a man evade immigration authorities, and Rep. LaMonica McIver in New Jersey, charged with assault after a skirmish with federal officers outside an immigration detention center, as well as an investigation of New York State Attorney General Letitia James, accused of mortgage fraud.\n\n“Now, they’re attacking Andrew Cuomo, to interfere with New York City’s election,” the ad states. “Why? Because Andrew Cuomo is the last person they want as mayor.”\n\nThe investigation into Cuomo stems from a criminal referral to the Justice Department by Rep. James Comer, R-Ky., chairman of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee. The complaint alleges that Cuomo lied to a congressional committee about his handling of the coronavirus pandemic, specifically relating to nursing homes and long-term care facilities.\n\nA spokesperson for Cuomo told the website The Daily Beast that “Gov. Cuomo testified truthfully to the best of his recollection about events from four years earlier, and he offered to address any follow-up questions from the subcommittee—but from the beginning this was all transparently political.”\n\nCuomo, who resigned as governor in August of 2021 amid allegations of sexual harassment, was also the subject of a report by James concluding that his administration had undercounted nursing home deaths in the early days of the pandemic by 50 percent. A Syracuse.com investigation at the time found similar numbers.\n\nCuomo is returning to politics with his run for mayor of New York City. He is the frontrunner to win the Democratic nomination. New York’s current mayor, Eric Adams, was elected as a Democrat but has become an ally of Trump and is running for reelection as an independent. \n\nAdams’ term has been marked by accusations of corruption. In February, the Trump administration ordered federal prosecutors to drop corruption charges against Adams, a move which caused Manhattan’s top prosecutor and several high-ranking Justice Department officials to resign in protest.\n\nTrump’s press secretary answers question from young girl: ‘How many people has he fired?’Republicans reach deal on SALT deduction cap: See how much it will riseTrump administration official incorrectly defines ‘habeas corpus’ at Senate hearing","summary":"To this politician, being investigated by Trump's DOJ is a badge of honor.","url":"https://www.syracuse.com/politics/2025/05/longtime-foe-of-donald-trump-touts-justice-department-investigation-in-political-ad.html","image":"https://www.syracuse.com/resizer/v2/E7I2NDLTLBFRVOJEOQ3DPNAUBI.jpg?auth=c1f7f5a5c86a67834d6301a9888f05a7c4873fbc39758b6c3b39a89828b16992&width=1280&quality=90","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-05-22 00:48:40","author":"George Owens","authors":["George Owens"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.046},{"id":323508118,"title":"World News | Institute of Peace Reclaims Its Headquarters After Court Win over Musk's Cost-cutting Team","text":"Washington, May 22 (AP) The U.S Institute of Peace retook control of its headquarters Wednesday, two days after a federal judge said the firing of its board and employees by Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency was illegal. The institute's acting president, George Moose, entered the organization's headquarters with private security and the institute's outside attorney for the first time since being escorted off the premises during the DOGE takeover. Moose and most of the institute's board were fired in March, part of the mass slashing of the federal workforce spearheaded by Musk. Also Read | US Deportations: Boston Judge Says Donald Trump Admin Violated Court Order on Deportations to Third Countries. The institute and many of its board members filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration soon after, seeking to prevent their removal and stop DOGE from taking over its operations. U.S. District Court Judge Beryl A. Howell's opinion on Monday reversed DOGE's actions. Speaking after a short examination of the headquarters, Moose said all appeared to be in order. Also Read | US Shocker: Elderly Woman Shoots Son Over Loud Video Game Noise at Home, Dumps Gun in Canal in Arizona; Arrested. “We just did a quick walk-through — externally, visibly, things look to be in pretty good shape,” he said. “I didn't see anything, any destruction, if you will, no damage that I can see that is visible.” Moose, a former ambassador and career member of the U.S. Foreign Service, said a team of employees from human resources, technology and finance would be in the building Thursday getting the nonprofit ready to welcome back its workforce. He expected to bring back all the staff who want to return. In an email Wednesday, White House spokeswoman Anna Kelly did not comment on workers returning to the building, but signaled that the administration may challenge the decision. “President Trump is right to reduce failed, useless entities like USIP to their statutory minimum, and the rogue judge's attempt to impede on the separation of powers will not be the last say on the matter,” she said. The administration has 30 days after Monday's ruling to file a notice of appeal. Agencies across the federal government have been slashed or dismantled by Musk's DOGE team. Wednesday's low-key scene at the institute's headquarters marked a rare moment when a DOGE-targeted agency or organization has been able to begin reestablishing itself. The judge's ruling said the Trump administration did not have authority to unilaterally dismantle the institute, which was established by Congress in 1984 as an independent organization that would promote peace and seek to end conflicts around the world. It was operating in more than two dozen conflict zones at the time Musk's team took it over and shut it down. The saga began when Trump issued an executive order in February that targeted the institute and three other agencies for closure in an effort to deliver on campaign promises to shrink the size of the government. The first attempt by DOGE to take over the headquarters led to a standoff. Members of Musk's DOGE group returned days later with the FBI and District of Columbia Metropolitan Police to help them gain entry. DOGE installed new leadership, ordered a mass firing of nearly all the staff through their private emails, and handed over the institute's headquarters to the General Services Administration. The institute, concerned about liability and security of the building in the aftermath of the judge's ruling, reached out to the government attorneys earlier this week and again on Wednesday. George Foote, the institute's outside attorney, said the exchange was very smooth and orderly. Moose said the goal now is to get back to the work the institute was created to do 40 years ago and “projects, ideas that are, we believe, of interest to the American people.” (AP) (This is an unedited and auto-generated story from Syndicated News feed, LatestLY Staff may not have modified or edited the content body)","summary":"Get latest articles and stories on World at LatestLY.

The previous high was set at roughly the time of Trump’s inauguration on January 20. Smaller tokens such as Ether and XRP also gave back modest increases.\n\nBitcoin and the broader crypto market have rallied in recent weeks thanks to regulatory tailwinds including the stablecoin bill advancing in the US Senate after a group of Democrats dropped their opposition Monday. The industry-backed regulatory bill is now set for debate on the Senate floor with a bipartisan group hoping to pass it as soon as this week.\n\n“It’s the shift of approach from Gary Gensler and the SEC to this Trump administration, which has embraced our industry,” Michael Novogratz, founder and chief executive of Galaxy Digital, said during a Bloomberg TV interview on Wednesday.\n\n“That freed up the animal spirits both here and abroad.”\n\nThe terms of the proposed legislation were revised to include tighter restrictions on money laundering, foreign issuers, technology companies and improved consumer protections. It would also ensure domestic and foreign issuers both face the same rules.\n\nBitcoin was christened as a haven by some market participants during the financial markets turmoil spurred by the introduction of Trump’s trade tariffs. That narrative has gained traction as of late as fractious US budget negotiations keeps a focus on the growth in deficit spending.\n\n“We’re in a really hard position in this country when you have this kind of debt. And you’re seeing it with long ends of interest, yield curves selling off everywhere, the dollar is under pressure,” Mr Novogratz said. “That is all good for Bitcoin and crypto assets as well.”\n\nOptions traders have already built bullish positions on Bitcoin earlier this week with the $US110,000 calls, $US120,000 and $US300,000 expiring on June 27 seeing the most open interest, or the number of outstanding contracts on Deribit.\n\nDemand for short-dated calls that are expiring before late June with the strike prices above $US110,000 has surged in the past 24 hours, according to Amberdata.\n\nLiquidations in both bullish and bearish bets on crypto assets remain moderate amid the breakout with about $US200 million in the past 24 hours, according to data compiled by Coinglass.\n\nOpen interest — or outstanding contracts — for Bitcoin futures hosted by Chicago-based CME Group has seen a 23 per cent recovery from a year-to-date low in April, while investors have poured about $US3.6 billion into a group of a dozen US Bitcoin exchange-traded funds so far in May.\n\nBitcoin has risen about 14 per cent so far this year, outperforming other risk assets such as US stocks. The Nasdaq 100 index is down around 2 per cent since December.\n\nHelping to drive the outperformance has been surging demand from Michael Saylor’s Strategy and other companies seeking to emulate its Bitcoin buying strategy. The former software maker, until recently called MicroStrategy, has stockpiled over $US50b worth of the token.\n\nBitcoin miners, a flurry of obscure small-cap companies and public firms newly formed by crypto heavyweights are offering anything from convertible bonds to preferred stocks, giving different flavours of Bitcoin exposure to investors.\n\nAn affiliate of Cantor Fitzgerald is working with stablecoin issuer Tether Holdings and SoftBank Group to launch Twenty One Capital, a company that emulates Strategy’s business model. A subsidiary of Strive Enterprises co-founded by Vivek Ramaswamy is merging with Nasdaq-listed Asset Entities to form a Bitcoin treasury company.\n\nThe jump to a fresh record high comes as Trump prepares to meet with the biggest holders of his memecoin at a dinner at his golf club just outside Washington on Thursday. The event has raised concerns among ethics experts, who argue that it offers access through transactions that directly benefit the president, and has sparked criticism over the potential conflict of interest.","summary":"Bitcoin briefly hit an all-time high after the advancement of stablecoin legislation in the US stoked hopes of regulatory clarity under President Donald Trump. ","url":"https://thewest.com.au/business/money/bitcoin-touches-record-high-on-optimism-around-us-regulations-c-18775826","image":"https://images.thewest.com.au/publication/C-18775826/97ac71a3f3615dcc4a23952ba828574ef81e999e-16x9-x0y593w853h480.jpg?imwidth=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-05-22 00:46:12","author":"Suvashree Ghosh","authors":["Suvashree Ghosh"],"language":"en","source_country":"au","sentiment":-0.048},{"id":323509878,"title":"Kim Kardashian Steps Closer to Her Legal Dreams, Wearing Graduation Cap","text":"BEVERLY HILLS, Calif. – Kim Kardashian is a step closer to following in her father’s footsteps and becoming a lawyer.\n\nShe has completed a legal apprenticeship and is now eligible to take the California bar exam, her representative confirmed Wednesday.\n\nThe entrepreneur and reality TV personality shared an Instagram Story from a modest private gathering at the Beverly Hills Hotel, where she was all smiles wearing a graduation cap.\n\nJessica Jackson, a lawyer who mentored her in the program, called it “one of the most inspiring legal journeys we’ve ever seen.” \n\n“Six years ago, Kim Kardashian entered this program with nothing but a strong passion for justice,” Jackson remarked in a speech shown in the video. “No traditional law school experience, no easy routes, just sheer determination. And a vast array of case law books to study.”\n\nIn California, individuals have the option to study under a legal professional or judge as an alternative to attending law school. If Kardashian successfully passes the state’s notoriously challenging bar exam, she could earn her license to practice law.\n\nJackson said Kardashian spent “18 hours a week, 48 weeks a year for six straight years” on the program. \n\nHer late father, Robert Kardashian, was an attorney and counted O.J. Simpson among his clients.\n\nKardashian revealed the milestone roughly a week after she testified in a Paris courtroom about her fear of being killed during a 2016 armed robbery.\n\n“I was certain that was the moment that he was going to rape me,” she told a Paris court May 13 about the ordeal. “I absolutely did think I was going to die.”\n\nKardashian has in recent years been a criminal justice reform advocate and in 2018 successfully lobbied President Donald Trump to commute the sentence of Alice Marie Johnson, a grandmother who was serving a life sentence without parole for drug offenses.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nBEVERLY HILLS, Calif. – Kim Kardashian is a step closer to following&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Kim Kardashian Steps Closer to Her Legal Dreams, Wearing Graduation Cap first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/local-news/kim-kardashian-steps-closer-to-her-legal-dreams-wearing-graduation-cap/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Kim-Kardashian-dons-a-graduation-cap-and-marches-closer-to.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-05-22 00:45:35","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.23},{"id":323508126,"title":"World News | Zelenskyy Lauds EU's 17th Sanctions Package on Russia, Urges Stronger Measures Targeting Other Sectors","text":"Kyiv [Ukraine], May 22 (ANI): Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy on Wednesday (local time) expressed his gratitude for the European Union's adoption of its 17th sanctions package against Russia while advocating for even stronger measures to pressure Moscow into ceasing hostilities in the war.

These measures cover shipping companies responsible for the transportation of crude oil and oil products by sea and engaging in dangerous practices at sea while transporting Russian oil, including entities from the United Arab Emirates, Turkey and Hong Kong.

I think I'm trying to feel compassion for her but her hostility toward the guy is unbelievable,' he said.\n\nThe conservative pundit then went on to claim 'there's nothing more destabilizing than an unhappy marriage.'\n\nKelly agreed with Carlson, adding that 'everything Michelle says about her husband is negative.'\n\n'I almost never say negative things about Doug,' Kelly said of her own husband. 'He's not perfect but when I think about him, I don't immediately go to whatever is negative. I go to what's positive and what I love about him.'\n\nBut Michelle denied she and Barack are having marital problems when she appeared on a podcast with entrepreneur and investor Steven Bartlett earlier this month. \n\nThe podcast host brought up the ongoing speculation that she and her husband may have called it quits after she skipped out on Donald Trump's inauguration, saying her absence left some believing 'there's an issue with you and Barack, there's a divorce coming.'\n\n'Let me tell you, he would know it,' Michelle said, directing a finger at her brother. 'And everybody would know it.'\n\n'If I were having problems with my husband, everybody would know about it,' she said, laughing.\n\nMichelle then added that she is 'not a martyr' and joked about how she would address such marital strife publicly. \n\n'I would be problem-solving in public, like, \"Let me tell you what he did,\"' she said.\n\nRobinson took the joke one step further: 'If they were having a problem, I'd be doing a podcast with him.'\n\nStill, Michelle acknowledged that marriage is 'hard' for her and the former president but added that 'I wouldn't trade it,' calling President Obama, 'as the young people say... my person.' \n\n'The beauty of my husband and our partnership is that neither one of us was ever really, ever going to quit at it, because that's not who we are. And I know that about him. He knows that about me.'\n\nShe said that young people give up on marriage too soon, in part because they see a false image of a perfect union between herself and her husband. \n\n'I talk about these things because I think that people give up too quickly on marriage,' the 'Becoming' author said.\n\n'Because there is so much friction built into the equation. And if you're not getting help, talking about it, going to therapy, just understanding how things are changing, and how do you continuously renegotiate your relationship with your partner, I just see people quitting,' she said.\n\n'Because they look at me and Barack and go, '#couple goals.' And I'm like, it's hard,' Obama added.","summary":"Former First Lady Michelle Obama made an off-handed comment about being single on her podcast amid persistent rumors that her marriage is on the rocks.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-14737393/Michelle-Obama-single-divorce-rumors-Barack.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/05/22/01/98630317-0-image-a-16_1747873281938.jpg","video":"https://videos.dailymail.co.uk/video/mol/2025/04/30/8285978370563655925/1024x576_MP4_8285978370563655925.mp4","publish_date":"2025-05-22 00:41:51","author":"Editor,Melissa Koenig","authors":["Editor","Melissa Koenig"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.042},{"id":323508276,"title":"Canada in 'high level' talks to join US 'Golden Dome' missile defense plan: Mark Carney","text":"Canada Prime Minister Mark Carney told a press conference on Wednesday that \"high level\" talks are underway with the United States about joining US President Donald Trump's proposed \"Golden Dome\" missile defense system. \"We are conscious that we have an ability, if we so choose, to complete the Golden Dome with investments in partnership (with the US).

More \"Golden Dome\" missile defense system in the Oval Office at the White House on May 20, 2025 in Washington, DC. President Trump announced his plans for the \"Golden Dome,\" a national ballistic and cruise missile defense system. (Photo by Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images)\nGetty Images\n\nThe Trump administration has just announced its plans for the development of a multi-faceted “Golden Dome” missile defense system that will be designed to intercept everything from long-range intercontinental ballistic missiles to hypersonic weapons to drones large and small. The ultimate price of this quest for an all-purpose missile defense system is unknown, but president Trump has charged the Space Force to build one in three years at a price of $175 billion. Given that many of the relevant technologies have yet to be fully developed, nor is there a clear sense of how many interceptors will be needed to have even a minimal capability to intercept incoming missiles, the three year deadline is the very definition of wishful thinking.\n\nThe appeal of missile defense is obvious. If we had a foolproof technological shield against missile attacks, our security on that front would be assured without having to trust foreign adversaries to refrain from attacking the United States. But emotional appeal and the ability to develop realistic capabilities are two different thing. When Ronald Reagan announced his Strategic Defense Initiative (SDI) – popularly referrred to as Star Wars – in his famous 1983 speech on the subject, he promised an impenetrable shield that would prevent any enemy ICBM from hitting U.S. territory. But large numbers of scientists quickly pointed out that a foolproof missile defense was not possible, and 7,200 of them signed a petition saying they refused to work on the program for that reason. The scientists’ skepticism has proven to be wise, as tens, perhaps hundreds of billions of dollars spent over the past 40 years trying to develop a viable defense against intercontinenal ballistic missiles (ICBMs) have failed to produce a viable system.\n\nThe cold hard truth is that reliably intercepting an ICBM-launched warhead coming in at 15,000 miles an hour, and likely embedded among dozens of decoys, is a bridge to far for any conceivable defensive system. Our current system of ground-based interceptors has failed in nearly half of its tests. And none of those tests have been conducted under realistic conditions. Unlike in a real world attack, in tests to date the origin point of the attacking missile is known, as is the exact time it will be launched. And there are no decoys to complicate the issue.\n\nAn honest approach to Golden Dome would acknowledge that there is no perfect technological solution to the problem of a potential ICBM attack, and devote diplomatic energy to establishing communications channels and rules of the road that make sucn an attack as unlikley as possible. And work on other forms of attack, from hypersonic missiles to swarmds of drones, should be on a “fly-before-you-buy” basis, which would postpone production until some real capability has been demonstrated via realistic testing.\n\nMORE FOR YOU\n\nSamsung Surprises Galaxy Owners With Android Update Decision\n\n‘Thunderbolts’ Hits Milestone As The Second Lowest-Earning MCU Film\n\nMicrosoft Confirms Emergency Update For Windows Users\n\nMeanwhile, if an adversary engages in worst case planning and assumes that Golden Dome might create some ability to destroy some of their ICBMs, they may choose to invest in more offensive systems to make sure they are not vulnerable to a disarming first strike. Such an action would involve destroying much of the adversary’s nuclear arsenal in a surprise attack, and mopping up whatever is left with defensive systems. As unlikely as this may be, planners who deal in worst case scenarios might decide they need the ability to deal with such a situation. The result would be a classic offense/defense arms race that could push nuclear arsenals back towards Cold War levels while making the use of nuclear weapons more likely.\n\nAbsent a more realistic approach and an acknowledgement of the daunting challenges involved, Golden Dome looks more like a marketing concept than a carefully crafted plan to develop new capabilities that align with a sensible strategy. Congress, the media, and the public need to ask some hard questions before we sink billions of scarce resources into a system that will not perform as advertised, and yet might still spark an accelerated arms race.\n\nEditorial StandardsReprints & Permissions","summary":"The Trump administration just announced its broad plans for the development of a multi-faceted \"Golden Dome\" missile defense system but it is already doomed to fail..","url":"https://www.forbes.com/sites/williamhartung/2025/05/21/golden-dome-and-the-perils-of-techno-optimism/","image":"https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/682e71cfa3285cf44d6cde8d/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-05-22 00:39:14","author":"Chip Somodevilla,Contributor,William Hartung","authors":["Chip Somodevilla","Contributor","William Hartung"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.271},{"id":323510498,"title":"Bruce Springsteen releases EP featuring anti-Trump rants from UK concert","text":"Singer-songwriter Bruce Springsteen continued his criticism of President Donald Trump Wednesday by releasing a six-track digital extended play (EP) that included his political rants while performing in Manchester, United Kingdom, last week. \"The Boss\" included four songs on the 31-minute EP, \"Land of Hope & Dreams.\" The songs included \"Land of Hope and Dreams,\" \"Long Walk Home,\" \"My City of Ruins\" and \"Chimes of Freedom.\" All four songs were recorded live May 14, 2025, when Springsteen publicly lambasted Trump.

Mike Collins, R-Ga., received a devastating phone call from a sheriff in his home district while attending a Trump rally in South Carolina. The sheriff informed Collins that Laken Riley, a 22-year-old nursing student enrolled at Augusta University’s College of Nursing, had been murdered while jogging on the University of Georgia campus in Athens on Feb. 24.\n\nThe gruesome murder set off almost a year of policy debates and political calculus that culminated in President Donald Trump signing the Laken Riley Act into law. Collins, the leading House Republican on that piece of legislation, joined “The Signal Sitdown” to give a behind-the-scenes look at how Republicans got this major legislative accomplishment across the finish line.\n\nWhen Collins received that call in February 2024, he had a feeling the perpetrator was a criminal illegal alien. “I said, ‘Oh God, don’t tell me what you’re gonna tell me next,’” Collins recalled. In response, the sheriff told Collins, “Well, I can’t confirm it, but I can assure you.”\n\nThe illegal alien murderer, 26-year-old José Antonio Ibarra of Venezuela, was arrested the day after the heinous crime. Riley’s murder could have easily been prevented if America had anything close to a sane immigration system. \n\nIbarra, who was found guilty of all charges in November 2024, was apprehended by U.S. Customs and Border Protection after illegally entering the United States in September 2022, but he was released on parole while awaiting further immigration proceedings. A year later, Ibarra was arrested in New York City and charged with acting in a manner to injure a child under 17 but was released back onto the streets. A month later, Ibarra and his brother were arrested in Athens, Georgia, for shoplifting at a local Walmart. He was released while awaiting court proceedings, proceedings for which he failed to appear. \n\nSoon after learning about Riley’s murder, Collins said he “made a phone call to the family and told them that we were gonna be on top of this.”\n\nThe product was the Laken Riley Act, which Collins introduced in the last Congress on March 1, 2024. The legislation requires the Department of Homeland Security to detain illegal immigrants arrested for a number of crimes, such as theft, rather than letting criminal illegal immigrants out on the street and hoping they do not strike again.\n\nThe bill passed out of the Republican-controlled House with some Democrat support, but “when it got to the Senate, it just fell into that big black hole over there,” Collins said.\n\n“I told the family, uh, we talked after it went over there and I was told there’s no way it’s coming up,” Collins recalled. “And I told them it had gotten personal. I told them that I couldn’t let it go.”\n\n“No matter what, we were gonna get this passed if it’s the last thing that I ever do,” Collins said.\n\nThe strategy was straightforward: Say her name. “We were sitting around [thinking] how do we do this? We make sure that we keep this in the public, we make sure that we keep this in the media. We make sure that Laken Riley’s name becomes the face of this problem,” Collins told The Daily Signal. “We do that, we’ll be able to get some legislation that’ll impact and make a change.”\n\nDemocrats only changed their tune on legislation like the Laken Riley Act after thoroughly getting embarrassed in the November election. Collins went door to door on Capitol Hill to try to whip the votes in both the House and Senate to get the Laken Riley Act on Trump’s desk.\n\nSome Democrats, however, threatened to undermine the effectiveness of the bill while still taking credit for it, Collins said—even elected officials from his own state. “[Sen. Jon Ossoff] told me he was gonna dismantle the whole bill, make it his bill.” \n\n“That ought to tell you where people stood right then,” he recalled. “It wasn’t about the policy, it was about the politics. Because he’s up for reelection and he knows he’s in trouble.”\n\nCollins and Republicans managed to keep the bill intact and apply enough pressure so that Democrats caved. The House voted in favor, 264-to-159, and the Senate, 64-to-35.\n\nCollins was with Riley’s family when Trump signed the Laken Riley Act into law on Jan. 29, 2025. Collins recalled Riley’s mother asked to speak at the signing event, turning to him and saying, “Mike, I get pretty emotional,” Collins recalled.\n\n“I said, yeah, me too,” Collins replied, “but when I do, I just take in a deep breath, and when I do that, I can continue talking.”\n\nDuring her speech, “it was getting emotional,” Collins said. “She paused, and I could see out of the corner of my eye, President Trump … put his hand on her shoulder.”\n\n”You think about how that young lady fought for her life,” Collins said, “she fought to her last breath, and that’s the least that we could do for her.”","summary":"In February 2024, Rep.

South Africa rejects the allegation. Murder and violent crime rates are high in the country but the overwhelming majority of victims are Black.\n\nRelated: White farmers: how a far-right idea was planted in Donald Trump's mind\n\nBut Trump told Ramaphosa that white farmers were fleeing South Africa for the US and Australia.\n\n“You’re taking people’s land and those people in many cases are being executed,” he said.\n\n“They’re being executed. And they happen to be white, and most of them happen to be farmers.\n\n“We have thousands of people who want to come into our country. They are also going to Australia, in smaller numbers.”\n\nTrump later said vast numbers of white South African farmers were fleeing to Australia.\n\n“You take a look at Australia – they’re being inundated, and we’re being inundated with people that want to get out, and their farm is valueless.”\n\nThe Guardian has put questions to Ausgtralia’s Department of Home Affairs.\n\nThe former home affairs minister Peter Dutton – who, as opposition leader, lost his seat in this month’s federal election – proposed a special humanitarian intake of white South African farmers in 2018.\n\nThe dedicated program would have been modelled on the 12,000 additional places for Syrian and Iraqi refugees displaced by the Syrian civil war and the conflict against Daesh.\n\nDutton said in 2018 that white South African farmers “deserve special attention” and “need help from a civilised country like ours”.\n\n“I’ve asked the department to look at ways that we can provide some assistance. We could provide more visas for people potentially in the humanitarian program.”\n\nRelated: Memo from a South African: Peter Dutton is entrenching racist white privilege | Shelley Davidow\n\nThe South African government said at the time “that threat does not exist” and the home affairs department did not implement any dedicated program for white South Africans.\n\nSouth Africa is not in the top 10 of countries of origin for humanitarian entrants into Australia. Conflict-torn countries including Afghanistan, Iraq, Syria and Myanmar dominate that list. Australia’s South African-born population (not limited to humanitarian or refugee entrants) is the seventh-largest migrant community in Australia. It represents about 2.6% of Australia’s overseas-born population and 0.8% of Australia’s total population.\n\nThis year the US has started resettling white South Africans as refugees, with Trump saying Afrikaners were the victims of “genocide”. Fifty Afrikaners arrived in the US this month to take up Trump’s offer of “refuge”. He offered them asylum despite the US having halted arrivals of asylum seekers from most of the rest of the world as he dramatically limits immigration.\n\nThe US senator Chris Van Hollen accused the Trump administration of “making a mockery” of the country’s refugee process, turning it into a system of “global apartheid” by granting asylum status to Afrikaners while turning away refugees from war-torn countries, including Sudan.\n\nOn Wednesday US time, in the Oval Office, Ramaphosa pushed back against Trump’s statements, acknowledging South Africa’s high crime rate but stressing that most victims are Black.\n\nAs the meeting grew more chaotic and Trump’s tone more vociferous, Ramaphosa was resolutely calm.\n\n“We were taught by Nelson Mandela that whenever there are problems, people need to sit down around the table and talk about them,” he said. “And this is precisely what we would also like to talk about.”","url":"https://uk.news.yahoo.com/trump-falsely-claims-australia-being-003625208.html","image":"https://s.yimg.com/cv/apiv2/social/images/yahoo_default_logo-1200x1200.png","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-05-22 00:36:25","author":"Ben Doherty","authors":["Ben Doherty"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.021},{"id":323508114,"title":"World News | 1 Person Was Rescued and a Search is Underway for 3 Others After a Boat Sinks North of Seattle","text":"Seattle, May 22 (AP) One person was rescued by a good Samaritan and authorities were looking for three others after a boat took on water and sank in waters north of Seattle, the U.S Coast Guard said Wednesday.

Not only was it business as usual at the sprawling 300-acre campus of the Taiwanese contract manufacturer on Monday, the construction of dorms—an integral part of the Foxconn model—was also going on in full swing. The company is Apple’s biggest contract manufacturer.The world’s largest electronics manufacturer is investing $2.56 billion in its Devanahalli plant. Spread across Doddagollahalli and Chapparadahalli villages in Devanahalli taluk, it’s 34 km from Bengaluru’s Kempegowda International Airport. While Foxconn invested around Rs 3,000 crore in phase 1 (2023-24), the anticipated investment in the second phase (2026-27) is a similar amount. The manufacturing target is likely to be about 100,000 iPhones by December this year. 121324076Women to get preferenceThe dorms can house about 30,000 employees, making it the single largest such facility in India, people aware of the development told ET. Construction is expected to be completed by the year-end, they said. ET reported last week that Foxconn is likely to begin shipments from its Karnataka facility by June. This is expected to be among Foxconn’s largest facilities in the world, second only to China. In line with its China model, the company has also built dorms in Tamil Nadu to house employees at its Sriperumbudur unit. Those dorms can house around 18,000 workers.To be clear, the dormitories are for workers, not executives.Foxconn employees told ET women will be given preference for housing as they comprise 50-80% of the 30,000 workforce at the Devanahalli facility. On Monday, when ET visited the residential buildings in Devanahalli right behind the Foxconn iPhone assembly plant, a banner on the buildings read, “Safety alert month for the new dormitory project in area C&D of the Elephant Project.”That project name refers to the Devanahalli iPhone plant.Project Elephant is part of Foxconn's China+1 strategy to diversify production away from that country. Foxconn is one of the primary suppliers of iPhones and its components, apart from Tata Electronics, in India. The Tata unit has acquired the India units of Wistron and Pegatron, both Apple vendors. 121324096Employees said the assembly of some iPhone variants began in May while that of others will start in August. ET found several Wan Hai container trucks parked near the campus, presumably to help with shipments starting next month. Wan Hai Lines is a Taiwanese container shipping company known for its Asia network.Just as work is in full swing ahead of the iPhone 17 launch in September, the company is leaving no stone unturned to ensure that its dorm facility is on track.A male employee told ET, “Women travel from far and wide. The dorms will help them with avoiding that. Previously I worked with the Tatas (also an Apple supplier). It was the same model there.”Indian counterparts of Taiwanese employees at the plant said that senior-level Foxconn employees from Taiwan have rented homes nearby. A few other Taiwanese Foxconn employees are staying at hotels in Devanahalli.Expats working at Foxconn have been renting residences at prominent real-estate projects, said Sandeep Reddy, cofounder of Zapkey, which aggregates and organises publicly available properties registration data. “Rents start from Rs 2.5 lakh,” Reddy told ET.The assembly of iPhones has already started, said a female employee who works on the line. Women are working in shifts, including nights, on assembly operations. “It’s been only a year since everyone started working here, before which construction was still ongoing,” she saidApple and Foxconn did not respond to ET’s queries.In November last year, ET had reported that real estate firm BCD Group had leased 900 residential units, priced under Rs 45 lakh each, to Foxconn, in Hoskote, near Devanahalli, for a two-year period. Built with a total investment outlay of Rs 500 crore, the ready-to-move-in homes are located on a 75-acre site and will accommodate between 6,000 and 8,000 female workers.The project has been planned to include commercial spaces, schools, healthcare facilities and entertainment options, ensuring that residents have access to all essential services within the township, BCD Group MD Angad Singh Bedi had said then.BCD Group did not respond to fresh queries.ET reported on March 31 that Foxconn was planning to produce 25–30 million iPhones at its India plants in 2025, more than twice the number it made in the country last year.Apple’s Cook had said May 1 that in the June quarter, the company expects a majority of iPhones sold in the US to have India as their country of origin.Foxconn has operations in Tamil Nadu, Karnataka and Telangana. Apart from the Bengaluru unit, the Taiwanese major has opened a new one in Hyderabad to make AirPods, reflecting the widening of the Apple portfolio in India. This is in addition to its existing large-scale operations at its Sriperumbudur campus near Chennai where the bulk of iPhone assembly takes place currently.","summary":"Despite Trump's preference for US-based manufacturing, Apple is moving forward with iPhone production in India.

The judge’s statement was a notably strong rebuke to the government’s deportation efforts.\n\nIn an emergency hearing he called to address reports that immigrants had been sent to South Sudan, Judge Brian E. Murphy in Boston said the eight migrants aboard the plane were not given a meaningful opportunity to object that the deportation could put them in danger. Minutes before the hearing, administration officials accused “activist judges” of advocating the release of dangerous criminals.\n\n“The department actions in this case are unquestionably in violation of this court’s order,” Murphy said Wednesday, arguing that the deportees didn’t have “meaningful opportunity” to object to being sent to South Sudan. The group was flown out of the United States just hours after getting notice, leaving them no chance to contact lawyers who could object in court.\n\nGovernment attorneys argued that the men had a history with the immigration system, giving them prior opportunities to express a fear of being deported to a country outside their homeland. They also pointed out that the judge had not specified the exact time needed between notice and deportation, leaving room for misunderstanding.\n\nThe government calls the deported people ‘true national security threats’\n\nThe migrants’ home countries — Cuba, Laos, Mexico, Myanmar, Vietnam and South Sudan — would not take them back, according to Todd Lyons, the acting director of Immigration and Customs Enforcement, who spoke to reporters in Washington. He later said the migrants either came from countries that often do not take back all their deported citizens or had other situations that meant they could not be sent home.\n\n“These represent the true national security threats,” Lyons said at a news conference. Behind him was a display of photos of men he said had been convicted of rape, homicide, armed robbery and other crimes.\n\nAdministration officials, who have repeatedly clashed with the courts over their attempts to deport large numbers of immigrants, made their displeasure clear Wednesday.\n\nPresident Donald Trump and Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem “are working every single day to get these vicious criminals off of American streets — and while activist judges are on the other side, fighting to get them back onto the United States soil,” said Tricia McLaughlin, a department spokesperson. She pointed to the photographs and described them as “the monsters” that Murphy “is trying to protect.”\n\nHomeland Security officials released few specific details about the deportation flight. They said it left Tuesday with eight people on board and said they remained in the department’s custody Wednesday. Officials said they could not disclose the migrants’ final destination because of “safety and operational security.”\n\nThe case comes amid a sweeping immigration crackdown by the Republican administration, which has pledged to deport millions of people who are living in the United States illegally. The legal fight is the latest flashpoint as the administration rails against judges whose rulings have slowed the president’s policies.\n\nWith Congress largely silent or supportive, opponents of Trump’s agenda have filed hundreds of lawsuits and judges have issued dozens of orders against the administration. Immigration has been the most contentious issue. There was the mistaken deportation of an immigrant who was living in Maryland to a prison in El Salvador, as well as Trump’s push to swiftly deport alleged Venezuelan gang members without a court review.\n\nThe administration officials insisted that the deported men had received due process, but did not provide details. Immigration-rights attorneys argue they violated Murphy’s order, first handed down in March, that says people must have a chance to argue that going somewhere outside their homeland would put them in danger before being deported, even if they’ve otherwise exhausted their legal appeals.\n\n“The government is still refusing to provide due process to our clients, which means they are not giving them notice of the country to which they’re being deported, proper notice in a language that they understand, and not giving them a meaningful opportunity to claim fear based on those countries,” Trina Realmuto, the executive director of the National Immigration Litigation Alliance, said outside court.\n\n“These are countries that the State Department doesn’t want Americans to travel to. They are categorically not safe,” she added.\n\nIn court, Realmuto asked the judge to return the individuals to the United States. “They are no less deserving of protection than any other human beings on this planet,” she said.\n\nThe government argued the interviews with the men over their fears could be done where they are currently being held and confirmed with Murphy that they can be arranged. Realmuto called this a “logistical nightmare” that penalizes the men because the government violated the judge’s order. She said it would prove a challenge to get the men legal counsel and interpreters, an effort complicated by the time difference.\n\nMurphy, who raised the prospect of criminal contempt for anyone “involved in an illegal deportation,” later Wednesday ordered the government conduct a new set of interviews with the migrants if an appropriate place with appropriate privacy can be found. He said the government was welcome to bring the migrants back, but did not order they do so.\n\nAttorneys for the immigrants told the judge that immigration authorities may have sent as many as a dozen people from several countries to Africa.\n\nThe apparent removal of one man from the troubled Southeast Asian nation of Myanmar was confirmed in an email from an immigration official in Texas, according to court documents. He was informed only in English, a language he does not speak well, and his lawyers learned of the plan hours before his deportation flight, they said.\n\nA woman also reported that her husband from Vietnam and up to 10 other people were flown to Africa on Tuesday morning, attorneys from the National Immigration Litigation Alliance wrote.\nMurphy, who was nominated by Democratic President Joe Biden, previously found that any plans to deport people to Libya without notice would “clearly” violate his ruling.\n\nSouth Sudan’s police spokesperson, Maj. Gen. James Monday Enoka, told The Associated Press on Wednesday that no migrants had arrived in the country and that if they do, they would be investigated and “redeported to their correct country” if found not to be South Sudanese.\n\nEdmund Yakani, executive director of the South Sudanese group Community Empowerment for Progress Organization, questioned why people convicted of crimes in the United States would be sent there. “Is South Sudan a land of less human who deserve to receive perpetrators of human rights violations? Without any public explanation?” he asked.\n\nSome countries do not accept deportations from the United States. That has led the administration to strike agreements with other countries, including Panama, to house them. The U.S. has sent Venezuelans to a notorious prison in El Salvador under an 18th-century wartime law, an action being contested in the courts.\n\nSouth Sudan has endured repeated waves of violence since gaining independence from Sudan in 2011 amid hopes it could use its large oil reserves to bring prosperity to a region long battered by poverty. Just weeks ago, the country’s top U.N. official warned that fighting between forces loyal to the president and a vice president threatened to spiral again into full-scale civil war.\n\nThe State Department’s annual report on South Sudan, published in April 2024, says “significant human rights issues” include arbitrary killings, disappearances, torture or inhumane treatment by security forces and extensive violence based on gender and sexual identity.\n\nThe Homeland Security Department has given Temporary Protected Status to a small number of South Sudanese already living in the United States, shielding them from deportation because conditions were deemed unsafe for return. Noem recently extended those protections to November to allow for a more thorough review.\n\nThe U.S is one of the biggest donors to South Sudan’s humanitarian aid programs, with the total funding in 2024 standing at over $640 million.","summary":"The White House violated a court order on deportations to third countries with a flight linked to the chaotic African nation of South Sudan, a federal judge said Wednesday, hours after the Trump administration said it had expelled eight immigrants convicted of violent crimes but refused to reveal where they would end up. ","url":"https://www.bostonherald.com/2025/05/21/judge-blasts-south-sudan-flight/","image":"https://www.bostonherald.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/AP25141585380463.jpg?w=1024&h=650","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-05-22 00:28:18","author":"Associated Press","authors":["Associated Press"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.291},{"id":323508110,"title":"World News | EAM Jaishankar Discusses Indo-Danish Ties with Denmark's FM, Praises Its Support Against Terrorism","text":"Copenhagen [Denmark], May 22 (ANI): External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar held a productive meeting in Copenhagen on Wednesday (local time) with Danish Foreign Minister Lars Lokke Rasmussen to advance Indo-Danish relations.\nDuring the discussions, Jaishankar also lauded Denmark's solidarity and its support for India's fight against terrorism.\nAlso Read | US Deportations: Boston Judge Says Donald Trump Admin Violated Court Order on Deportations to Third Countries.\n\"Delighted to meet FM Lars Lokke Rasmussen in Copenhagen this evening.

The legislation, reintroduced in the senate last month, would combat deepfakes by holding individuals or companies liable if they produced an unauthorized digital replica of an individual in a performance. \n\n“AI technology is amazing and can be used for so many wonderful purposes,” McBride told the panel. “But like all great technologies, it can also be abused, in this case by stealing people’s voices and likenesses to scare and defraud families, manipulate the images of young girls in ways that are shocking to say the least, impersonate government officials, or make phony recordings posing as artists like me.” \n\nThe No Fakes Act would also hold platforms liable if they knew a replica was not authorized, while excluding certain digital replicas from coverage based on First Amendment protections. It would also establish a notice-and-takedown process so victims of unauthorized deepfakes “have an avenue to get online platforms to take down the deepfake,” the bill's sponsors said last month.\n\nThe bill would address the use of non-consensual digital replicas in audiovisual works, images, or sound recordings. \n\nNearly 400 artists, actors and performers have signed on in support of the legislation, according to the Human Artistry Campaign, which advocates for responsible AI use, including LeAnn Rimes, Bette Midler, Missy Elliott, Scarlett Johansson and Sean Astin.\n\nThe testimony comes two days after President Donald Trump signed the Take It Down Act, bipartisan legislation that enacted stricter penalties for the distribution of non-consensual intimate imagery, sometimes called “revenge porn,” as well as deepfakes created by AI.\n\nMitch Glazier, CEO of the RIAA, said that the No Fakes act is “the perfect next step to build on” that law. \n\n“It provides a remedy to victims of invasive harms that go beyond the intimate images addressed by that legislation, protecting artists like Martina from non-consensual deepfakes and voice clones that breach the trust she has built with millions of fans,” he said, adding that it “empowers individuals to have unlawful deepfakes removed as soon as a platform is able without requiring anyone to hire lawyers or go to court.”\n\nSuzana Carlos, head of music policy at YouTube, added that the bill would protect the credibility of online content. AI regulation should not penalize companies for providing tools that can be used for permitted and non-permitted uses, she said in written testimony, prior to addressing the subcommittee. \n\nThe legislation offers a workable, tech-neutral and comprehensive legal solution, she said, and would streamline global operations for platforms like YouTube while empowering musicians and rights holders to manage their IP. Platforms have a responsibility to address the challenges posed by AI-generated content, she added.\n\n“YouTube largely supports this bill because we see the incredible opportunity to of AI, but we also recognize those harms, and we believe that AI needs to be deployed responsibly,” she said.","summary":"Tech and music industry leaders testified about the dangers of deepfakes made with artificial intelligence on Wednesday, urging lawmakers to pass legislation that would protect people&rsquo;s voices and likenesses from replication without consent","url":"https://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory/industry-leaders-urge-senate-protect-ai-deepfakes-fakes-122053747","image":"https://i.abcnewsfe.com/a/36984eeb-8afe-47a6-a753-52b60a8fa7e5/wirestory_ec07483bac26818116b9b5a1713fe250_16x9.jpg?w=1600","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-05-22 00:24:01","author":null,"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.26},{"id":323503390,"title":"Education secretary defends 15.3% cut to agency in 'final mission'","text":"May 21 (UPI) -- Education Secretary Linda McMahon, testifying before a House subcommittee on Wednesday, defended a 15.3% leaner budget from last year as part of the department's \"final mission.\"\n\nPresident Donald Trump's budget request would cut funding to the Education Department by about $12 billion to wind down the agency.

Bonnie Watson Coleman, of New Jersey, also blasted states gaining greater authority.\n\n\"I'm asking you, do you realize that to send authority back to the states, to eliminate your oversight, to eliminate your accountability, to eliminate your determination as to resources going to schools that are teaching public schools that are teaching underserved communities, this will result in the very reason that we had to get the involvement of our government in this, and that's a yes or no,\" she said.\n\n\"It isn't a yes or no, but I will not respond to any questions based on the theory that this administration doesn't care anything about the law and operates outside it,\" McMahon responded.\n\nColeman said: \"From the president of the United States conducting himself in a corrupt manner to his family enriching him and himself corruptly ... I'm telling you, the Department of Education is one of the most important departments in this country and you should feel shameful [to] be engaged with an administration that doesn't give a damn.\"\n\nMcMahon said she is not trying to remove 8% to 10% that goes to states, and instead moving programs to other departments.\n\nShe described her agency as a federal funding \"pass-through mechanism\" and other agencies could take over the job of distributing allocations from Congress.\n\n\"Whether the channels of that funding are through HHS [Health and Human Services], or whether they're funneled through the DOJ (Department of Jusrtice], or whether they're funneled through the Treasury or SBA [Smal Business Administration] or other departments, the work is going to continue to get done,\" McMahon said.\n\nPlans are to move the student loan programs to the SBA, which McMahon was the administrator during the first Trump administration.\n\nThe reductions include eliminating two federal programs designed at improving college access for disadvantaged, TRIO, and low-income students, Gear Up, at a cost of $1.6 billion. Also, the federal Work-Study Program would shift responsibility to states, and funding would be eliminated for Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grants to undergraduate students.\n\nAnd funding would be reduced 35%, or about $49 million, for the already-scaled back Office for Civil Rights, which investigates harassment and discrimination on college campuses and in K-12 schools.\n\nThe budget shifts funding from programs supporting diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives.\n\nShe said full funding would remain for Title I-A, which allocates funds to schools with the highest percentages of children from low-income families, and those with the Disabilities Education Act for free public education and support services for children with disabilities.\n\n\"Here we are today with a Department of Education that was really stood up in 1980 by President Carter,\" McMahon said. \"We've spent over $3 trillion during that time, and every year we have seen our scores continue to either stagnate or fall. It is clear that we are not doing something right.\"\n\nOn March 20,, Trump signed an executive order directing McMahon to \"take all necessary steps to facilitate the closure of the Department of Education.\"\n\nSix days earlier, the agency announced a workforce reduction that would cut nearly 50% of employees, 1,315.\n\nThe department, already the smallest Cabinet-level agency before the recent layoffs, distributed roughly $242 billion to students, K-12 schools and universities in the 2024 fiscal year.

Appearing on “The Tucker Carlson Show,” Dhillon told Carlson how Trump’s anti-discrimination and anti-DEI agenda “catalyzed hundreds of lawyers to quit the civil rights division.”\n\n“Wait, they quit because you informed them of the law?” Carlson asked.\n\n“Yes, and the law and the priorities. Their pet projects had changed. They weren’t going to be able to do those the way that they wanted,” Dhillon said.\n\nBetween Trump’s inauguration in January and May, an estimated 250 attorneys in the DOJ’s civil rights division, which is roughly 70%, resigned, according to NPR.\n\nCarlson asked Dhillon if the lawyers who were upset about Trump’s victory believed that the DOJ “was just immune to democracy” and if elections “just had no bearing” on the department. (RELATED: EXCLUSIVE: Harmeet Dhillon Reveals What’s Next For ‘Notorious’ DOJ Office That Was Weaponized Under Biden)\n\n“There were career lawyers there who were doing the same thing, no matter who is the president. Suddenly, their little fiefdom that had remained untouched, like Shangri-La, was suddenly having to be responsive to elections.”\n\n“So that’s the definition of the deep state, what you just described? Elections have no effect? It’s like there’s no way to control these people. They act totally independently from the democratic system. That’s the problem,” Carlson said.\n\nIn December 2024, Dhillon was tapped by Trump to take up the DOJ’s Civil Rights Division. Her track record includes taking on physicians who performed transgender surgeries.\n\n“That’s what I found,” Dhillon said. “In response to my memos, it began leaking to the press. They began having unhappy hours, which they would invite supervisors, political supervisors, to make their point that they were unhappy. We got the point. And they had crying sessions, struggle sessions, crying sessions in the DOJ.”\n\nCarlson appeared shocked.\n\n“Oh, there was open crying in the halls,” Dhillon said. “Crying, yes. Then one of my colleagues described to me — it was the last day a couple of weeks ago for some of them — they lined up in a phalanx and approached the elevator together, and then they left the building together, to show their solidarity for one another there, as if they were persecuted.”\n\n“How old are these [people] — high school students or adults?” Carlson asked.\n\nDhillon said they were “30, 40 and 50-year-old career attorneys in the Department of Justice” who were a part of the “sessions” and pushback against Trump’s agenda.\n\n“It’s pathetic,” Carlson said.\n\nSince taking up her position in the DOJ, Dhillon’s division has aided in religious liberty. The DOJ has launched a task force to “eliminate” anti-Christian bias and opened an investigation into Washington’s “anti-Catholic” law. In May, Dhillon’s division also began to probe Chicago officials over potential racial discrimination in their hiring. This was due to Democrat Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson touting his diverse administration.\n\nAll content created by the Daily Caller News Foundation, an independent and nonpartisan newswire service, is available without charge to any legitimate news publisher that can provide a large audience.

Watson Coleman: 'You should feel shameful'","text":"Sparks flew on Capitol Hill Wednesday as Education Secretary Linda McMahon faced off with Rep. Bonnie Watson Coleman, D-N.J., in a fiery exchange during a House Appropriations subcommittee hearing in the latest clash over the Trump administration’s efforts to dismantle the Department of Education. The war of words began when Watson Coleman asked, \"Do you believe that there is illegal discrimination against people who are Black or brown, and other types of discrimination in jobs and education in this country?\" \"I think it still exists in some areas,\" McMahon replied. 'EDUCATORS WILL BE FIRED': REPUBLICANS CHEER TRUMP ORDER DISMANTLING EDUCATION DEPARTMENT AS DEMS SEETHE Watson Coleman pressed further: \"Then can you tell me why the Office of Civil Rights and the Department of Education is being decimated?\" McMahon responded, \"Well, it isn’t being decimated. We have reduced the size of it. However, we are taking on a backlog of cases that were left over from the Biden administration.\" Watson Coleman grew visibly frustrated and accused the administration of racial bias in immigration and education policies, saying its actions amounted to \"favoritism and prioritization of white over color.\" In a blistering rebuke, Watson Coleman said, \"Your rhetoric means nothing to me. What means something to me is the actions of this administration. I’m telling you, the Department of Education is one of the most important departments in this country. And you should feel shameful to be engaged with an administration that doesn’t give a damn.\" STUDENT LOANS, PELL GRANTS WILL CONTINUE DESPITE EDUCATION DEPARTMENT DOWNSIZING, EXPERT SAYS McMahon, remaining composed, replied, \"I am the secretary of Education who has been approved to run this agency by Congress. And I was appointed by the president. And I serve at his pleasure under his mandate. So, therefore, the direction of his administration is what I will follow.\" The exchange came as part of a larger hearing in which McMahon laid out President Donald Trump’s 2026 education budget proposal, which calls for a $12 billion cut to the Education Department, a 15% reduction. McMahon described her work as the department’s \"final mission\": to wind it down and restore education oversight to states, parents and local educators. \"Let’s focus on literacy. What we’re seeing in those scores is a failure of our students to learn to read,\" McMahon said. \"We’ve lost the fundamentals.\" Chairman Rep. Robert Aderholt, R-Ala., praised McMahon’s approach, noting, \"Despite $3 trillion in federal education spending since 1980, student achievement has not improved. The answer is not more money. It’s more accountability and local control.\" The plan consolidates 18 federal programs into a single $2 billion block grant to states. Democrats labeled the proposal as a backdoor effort to gut federal support for public schools. On student loans, McMahon said the department has begun recovering repayments after years of Biden-era pauses and confusion. \"Since we restarted collections in May, we have recovered nearly $100 million,\" she said. She also defended staffing cuts and administrative restructuring, stating, \"We’re delivering on all of our statutory requirements with fewer people and lower overhead.\" Republicans on the subcommittee shared their support for charter schools and school choice. McMahon, in agreement, pointed to a proposed $60 million increase in charter school funding. \"We’ve got about a million students on charter school waiting lists,\" she said. \"Parents should be deciding where their children can go to school and get the best education.\" Democrats also criticized McMahon for not defending early childhood education, particularly Head Start, even though the program technically falls under the Department of Health and Human Services. \"Every Head Start program in the country has three days of funding. That’s not someone else’s problem. It’s America’s children,\" said Rep. Josh Harder, D-Calif. McMahon responded, \"The earlier we can start education, the better, but I don’t believe the federal government is responsible for everything. That’s where states can lead.\" The Trump administration also defended its position forcefully outside the hearing room. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP \"On the topic of corruption, let’s not forget that the Department of Education was created by President Carter in an attempt to win voters,\" Savannah Newhouse, Education Department press secretary, said in a statement to Fox News Digital following the exchange. \"Since then, we have spent over $3 trillion pretending the department is necessary as student learning outcomes have not improved,\" she continued. \"While the congresswoman from New Jersey basks in her five minutes of fame, the Trump administration is working to improve student outcomes and ensure American families have access to the quality education that they deserve.\"","summary":"Education Secretary Linda McMahon clashes with Democrat Rep.

This acceptance comes amidst ongoing debates about the appropriateness and legality of receiving high-value gifts from foreign entities.\n\nThe Defence Department intends to “implement necessary security precautions” to ensure the jet is suitable for the president’s use, stated Pentagon spokesman Sean Parnell on Wednesday (Thursday AEST). He mentioned that the acceptance of the plane was conducted “in compliance with all federal statutes and guidelines.”\n\nTrump has defended the gift, which came up during his recent Middle East trip, as a way to save tax dollars.\n\nA Boeing 747 with the colour scheme of planes used by the Qatari royal family is seen on Friday, May 2, 2025 at San Antonio International Airport in San Antonio, Texas.

Democrats have been united in outrage, and even some of the Republican president’s GOP allies in Congress have expressed concerns.\n\n“This unprecedented action is a stain on the office of the presidency and cannot go unanswered,” said Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer.\n\n“Until Americans get transparency on this shady deal, which apparently includes a corrupt plot for Donald Trump to keep the plane at his library after leaving office, I’ll continue to hold all Department of Justice political nominees.”\n\nSchumer has introduced legislation that would prohibit any foreign aircraft from being used as Air Force One and forbid use of taxpayer money to modify or restore the aircraft. But on Wednesday, Republican Senator Roger Marshall objected when Schumer asked for a vote, thus blocking it.

Instead, he said, the plane would be donated to a future presidential library, similar to how the Boeing 707 used by former president Ronald Reagan was decommissioned and put on display as a museum piece.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nUS Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth has received a luxury Boeing 747 jet&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Qatar Gifts Luxury Jet to US Defense Department for Trump’s Use first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/news/au/qatar-gifts-luxury-jet-to-us-defense-department-for-trumps-use/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/US-Defence-Department-accepts-luxury-jet-from-Qatar-for-Trump039s.au2Ffs2Fde0619fd-d1eb-45ad-a748-b9984633b400.jpeg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-05-22 00:00:47","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.008},{"id":323504446,"title":"Trump critic admits the president put together a better working-class coalition than any Democrat","text":"MSNBC analyst John Heilemann, an outspoken critic of President Donald Trump, admitted the president has put together a working-class coalition that should make the Democratic Party jealous. During a panel discussion on MSNBC’s \"Morning Joe\" on Wednesday, panelists talked about how the Democratic Party has failed to truly reckon with why Trump has consistently won over so much of the working-class even 6 months into his second term in office. \"Certainly Democrats have struggled to handle Donald Trump, but they’ve even been worse at sort of identifying themselves and pitching a message going forward. A few exceptions. We know we see the crowds that Bernie Sanders and AOC have drawn, but as you speak to members of the party, you know, what are they saying here?\" Morning Joe co-host Jonathan Lemire asked Heilemann. \"Because some of the Democrats I’ve talked to are frustrated that - Even though they’re still doing it, there’s a party right now is still consumed with the past and not looking for the future and a new message.\" \"It is true and also not true that Democrats - and when I say Democrats here, I don’t mean the party, but liberals, the left, the left of center, whatever - aren’t part of the cultural conversation,\" Heilemann suggested. While he said there are multiple major conversations occurring in the country, Heilemann offered one key reason why so many Americans feel alienated by \"mainstream\" culture. DEMOCRATS NO LONGER 'PARTY OF THE PEOPLE' AS TRUMP TRANSFORMS REPUBLICAN PARTY: NY TIMES ANALYST \"One of the reasons why the cultural conversation on the right has gotten so much traction is because of the fact that the left, the Democrats, whatever you want to call them, has been seen as dominating the mainstream cultural conversation for so long. Who controls Hollywood? Who controls the media? You’d have to be kind of nuts to think that the mainstream media and the mainstream entertainment establishment in America isn’t largely left of center.\" The Democratic Party, he said, is now having to reckon with how it alienated so many of the very same working-class voters that propelled Trump’s victory once again in 2024. \"Right now, somehow the Democratic Party finds itself in a place where it is no longer the home of working Americans, largely,\" he said. \"And if Bobby Kennedy, the coalition that Bobby Kennedy was trying to put together in 1968 before he was killed, that coalition of working-class Whites, working-class Latinos, working-class African-Americans, that coalition has been put together more effectively by Donald Trump than by anybody in the Democratic Party. That’s a huge problem.\" CLICK HERE FOR MORE COVERAGE OF MEDIA AND CULTURE Heilemann reiterated his point that \"Bobby Kennedy’s coalition is being put together by Donald Trump more than by any of our leaders,\" and asked, \"How do we fix that problem?

Email tips@dailymail.com \nBy AMELIA WYNNE FOR MAILONLINE \n Published:00:57 BST, 22 May 2025 |Updated:00:59 BST, 22 May 2025 \n\nAnger is reportedly mounting behind the scenes after This Morning escaped the ITV cutbacks announced this week amid a schedule shake-up and overhaul at the channel.\nITV announced on Tuesday there would be dramatic changes to their daytime TV schedule, with Lorraine Kelly's show slashed from an hour to 30 minutes and, like Loose Women, will only air 30 weeks of the year.\nAnchors Ruth Langsford and Kaye Adams, both 65, and presenters Nadia Sawalha, 60, and Denise Welch, 66, are believed to be 'angered' and 'panicked' about their livelihoods being at stake, causing uproar behind the scenes.\nTop TV talents including Lorraine, 65, whose career spans over 40 years, are believed to be 'furious' and 'insulted' over the shake-up while the Loose Women are already fearing inevitable job losses.\nThe new regime, set to come into effect in January, will cost a potential 300 staff members their jobs as a consultation period begins as soon as today, lasting until September, before employees are finally let go in December.\nFrom A-list scandals and red carpet mishaps to exclusive pictures and viral moments, subscribe to the DailyMail's new Showbiz newsletter to stay in the loop. \n\nAnger is reportedly mounting behind the scenes after This Morning escaped the ITV cutbacks announced this week amid a schedule shake-up and overhaul at the channel (Ben Shephard Cat Deeley hosting This Morning)\n\nITV announced on Tuesday there would be dramatic changes to their daytime TV schedule, with Lorraine Kelly's show slashed from an hour to 30 minutes\nBut now there is reportedly growing resentment that This Morning is going to be unaffected despite scandals in recent years including Phillip Schofield's affair with a much younger colleague. \nA source told The Sun: 'The tension is unbearable. There's a lot of rage towards This Morning, which everyone feels is constantly favoured despite it being the lame duck of the daytime flock.\n'There's a feeling that Loose Women and Lorraine are delivering resilient, solid ratings while This Morning is always in the Press for its tumbling viewing figures. Loose Women is even winning awards.\n'Never mind the Phillip Schofield scandal and then Holly Willoughby leaving, This Morning is like the black sheep and yet that's the show that is not facing any cuts.\n'Everyone is absolutely furious that This Morning has got away with it yet again.' \nA source added that some of the older members of the ITV presenting teams are worried that bosses will favour younger stars for the roles that are left. \nITV has been contacted by MailOnline for comment.\nInsiders have revealed to MailOnline that it's Christine Lampard, 46, who fears she will be most affected given she presents for Lorraine when she is on holiday and also anchors Loose Women, meaning her yearly work is now in jeopardy. \n\nAnchors Ruth Langsford and Kaye Adams, both 65, and presenters Nadia Sawalha, 60, and Denise Welch, 66, are believed to be 'angered' and 'panicked' about their livelihoods being at stake, causing uproar behind the scenes\n\nA source told The Sun: 'The tension is unbearable. There's a lot of rage towards This Morning, which everyone feels is constantly favoured despite it being the lame duck of the daytime flock'\nA TV source told MailOnline: 'All of the presenters are in a state of panic and up in arms following ITV's announcement.\n'These shows make up a large part of their livelihoods, so they are just as stressed and angry as the production staff, who have been told over 300 jobs are at risk.\n'Ruth, Kaye, Nadia and Denise, in particular, have been reaching out to the production team in a panic and to express how angry they are that ITV had made this decision.\n'Lorraine is also furious that her show has been chopped to 30 minutes and moved to just 30 weeks of the year, the same as Loose Women.\n\nEXCLUSIVE Loose Women's day of panic: The stars left 'terrified' by ITV cuts - and the presenter who fears she will be the biggest loser of all \n'She thinks it's the ultimate insult after so many years at the channel, especially as Good Morning Britain is staying the same, with the current hours, airing every weekday of the year, as her show rates the same as they do.\n'Loose Women and Lorraine dropping down in their schedule will badly affect Christine Lampard, she anchors for both shows so most of her yearly work is now at stake.'\nMailOnline understands the cast of Loose Women, which includes over 20 presenters such as Charlene White and Coleen Nolan, feel there will be no option other than for the broadcaster to let go of key talent, who have worked on the production for decades.\nIt's also believed that younger panelists, like former Love Island contestant Olivia Attwood, 34, and influencer GK Barry, 25, could be favoured over veteran stars including Janet Street-Porter, 78, and Jane Moore, 63.\nA Loose Women insider added: 'At the moment there are about 20 presenters at the show, some are contracted, like Ruth, Kaye, Nadia, Denise, Janet, and Jane, and others are more ad hoc, like Myleene Klass and Sue Cleaver.\n'It is hard enough right now to give every contributor a fair number of shows and to keep everyone happy and on screen as much as they would like.\n\nThere is reportedly growing resentment that This Morning is going to be unaffected despite scandals in recent years including Phillip Schofield's affair with a much younger colleague (seen with co-host Holly Willoughby)\n'Now, the show will air just 30 weeks a year, so a lot of people are going to lose their jobs. There won't be enough shows to go around, so it means presenters who have been on the series for 25 years may be kicked off the panel.'\nLoose Women, which launched in 1999, currently airs on ITV during the week for an hour but from January 2026, the show will only broadcast 30 weeks of the year. \nIn recent months, the show has attempted to reach a younger audience by recruiting Olivia, who currently fronts her own dating series Bad Boyfriends for the broadcaster, and in March, the series launched its first podcast across ITVX and YouTube. \nAnchor Ruth, who previously co-hosted This Morning with ex-husband Eamonn Holmes until 2021, has been on the programme since the beginning, making her the longest serving panelist. \nLoose WomenITVThis Morning\n\nShare or comment on this article: \n'Anger mounts behind the scenes at ITV' after This Morning escapes channel's cuts and brutal schedule shake-up despite recent scandals\n\nAdd comment\n\n Share what you think\n\nWorst rated\n\nThe comments below have not been moderated.\n\nThe views expressed in the contents above are those of our users and do not necessarily reflect the views of MailOnline.\n\nAdd your comment\n\nEnter your comment\n\nBy posting your comment you agree to our house rules.\n\nSubmit Comment\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual.\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual\n\nWe will automatically post your comment and a link to the news story to your Facebook timeline at the same time it is posted on MailOnline.

They can all be overcome, but it will take focus and prioritization,\" said Melanie Marlowe, a nonresident senior associate in the Missile Defense Project at Washington's Center for Strategic and International Studies.\"The White House and Congress are going to have to agree on how much to spend and where the money will come from,\" Marlowe said, noting that \"our defense industrial base has atrophied,\" though \"we have begun to revive it.\"She also cited the need for more progress on sensors, interceptors and other components of the project.Trump on Tuesday announced an initial $25 billion in funding for Golden Dome, saying its eventual cost would be about $175 billion.(function(v,d,o,ai){ai=d.createElement(\"script\");ai.defer=true;ai.async=true;ai.src=v.location.protocol+o;d.head.appendChild(ai);})(window, document, \"//a.vdo.ai/core/v-ndtv/vdo.ai.js\");That figure is likely far lower than the actual price of such a system.Thomas Roberts, assistant professor of international affairs and aerospace engineering at the Georgia Institute of Technology, said the price estimate was \"not realistic.\"\"The challenge with the statements from yesterday is that they lack the details needed to develop a model of what this constellation would really look like,\" he said.- 'Not holding my breath' -Earlier this month, the non-partisan Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimated the cost of space-based interceptors to defeat a limited number of intercontinental ballistic missiles at between $161 billion and $542 billion over 20 years.A system such as that envisaged by Trump \"could require a more expansive SBI (space-based interceptor) capability than the systems examined in the previous studies. Quantifying those recent changes will require further analysis,\" the CBO said.The Golden Dome concept -- and name -- stem from Israel's Iron Dome air defense system. But the United States' missile threats differ significantly from the short-range weapons that Iron Dome is designed to counter.Beijing is closing the gap with Washington when it comes to ballistic and hypersonic missile technology, while Moscow is modernizing its intercontinental-range missile systems and developing advanced precision strike missiles, according to the Pentagon's 2022 Missile Defense Review.The document also said the threat of drones -- which have played a key role in the Ukraine war -- is likely to grow, and warned of the danger of ballistic missiles from North Korea and Iran, as well as rocket and missile threats from non-state actors.Countering all those myriad threats would be a major undertaking, and there are various issues that would need to be overcome for such a system to come online.\"There are a number of bureaucratic, political, science and technological milestones that will need to be achieved if Golden Dome is ever going to enter service in any meaningful capacity,\" said Thomas Withington, associate fellow at the Royal United Services Institute.\"It is an incredibly expensive undertaking, even for the US defense budget.

In March, President Donald Trump signed an executive order eliminating most of the agency’s funding as part of a sweeping cost-cutting agenda.\n\nEU foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas announced the bloc’s financial lifeline on Tuesday, describing it as “short-term emergency funding” to support what she called a “vital” mission. The €5.5 million package will act as a “safety net” to help RFE/RL maintain operations in countries within Brussels’s sphere of interest, including Russia, Belarus, Iran, and several Central Asian states.\n\n“In a time of growing unfiltered content, independent journalism is more important than ever,” Kallas said following a meeting of EU foreign ministers. She acknowledged that the EU could not fully replace the lost American funding but emphasized the symbolic value of the move, urging individual member states to offer further support.\n\nSince Trump’s defunding order, RFE/RL has furloughed staff, suspended programming, and launched legal challenges. Although a Washington judge temporarily halted the administration’s decision in April, a federal appeals court later blocked the release of funds pending further litigation. The broadcaster has warned that it faces permanent shutdown in multiple regions if its financial crisis is not resolved.\n\nThe Trump administration framed the defunding as part of a broader campaign to dismantle bureaucratic institutions that no longer align with US strategic interests. RFE/RL’s leadership has disputed that rationale, with its president, Stephen Capus, calling the funding cuts a “massive gift to America’s enemies.”\n\nAdministration officials and critics have argued that RFE/RL and its sister outlet, Voice of America (VOA), have lost their relevance and veered toward partisan editorializing.

The two leaders initially discussed the prowess of South African golfers before transitioning to a press conference with journalists. Trump proceeded to show President Ramaphosa images on a screen, which seemed to depict white South Africans grieving for their loved ones. The BBC reported that this presentation was meticulously planned beforehand. As the footage concluded and reporters began to overlap with their questions, a visibly taken aback Ramaphosa attempted to interject. It was then that Trump directed his ire towards an NBC journalist, bluntly telling him to \"get out.\" Trump berated the reporter, saying, \"What are you talking about? You've got to get out of here. What does this have to do with the Qatari jet? We are talking about a lot of other things - this is NBC trying to get off the subject of what you just saw. You're a terrible reporter.

No more questions from you. His name is Peterson or something. He's a terrible reporter.\" Before Trump's harsh remarks, the atmosphere had reportedly already tensed up when he surprised Ramaphosa with what seemed like an 'ambush'. While the video plays, Trump provides his thoughts, remarking, \"It's a terrible sight. I've never seen anything like it.\" Ramaphosa then inquires of Trump, \"Have they told you where that is, Mr. President?\" to which Trump responds with a no. Ramaphosa expresses his desire to identify the location of the footage, admitting he's never seen it before, and Trump informs him, \"It's in South Africa.\" After a confrontation with an NBC reporter, Trump proceeds to display a collection of papers featuring images of white South Africans who, according to the President, were victims of murder. The atmosphere quickly becomes tumultuous as reporters begin to shout over one another. Ramaphosa addresses the allegations before deftly shifting the discussion towards trade. The BBC reports that the South African President stated, \"South Africa has a democracy that allows people to express themselves.\" He continued by acknowledging the issue of crime in his country, saying, \"There is criminality in our country,\" and pointed out that \"and the people who get killed in South Africa are not only white people, but also include black people.\"","summary":"Donald Trump went on a furious rant at a journalist in the Oval Office as he hosted South African President Cyril Ramaphosa - before telling him to &quot;get out&quot;","url":"https://www.dailystar.co.uk/news/us-news/donald-trump-erupts-furious-oval-35267682","image":"https://i2-prod.dailystar.co.uk/article35267681.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200b/0_President-Trump-Holds-Law-Enforcement-Event-In-White-Houses-Oval-Office.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-05-21 23:51:02","author":"Alexandra Bullard,Ayeesha Walsh,Michael D.

Its lawyer levied the allegations on May 14 in court filings, claiming that Fox “orchestrated the destruction of text messages across all levels of their corporate hierarchy… despite a clear duty to preserve evidence.” Smartmatic previously said some of the evidence involved deleted texts from November to December 2020, after several Fox hosts repeated or did not challenge guests who repeated President Donald Trump election fraud allegations against the company.\n\nFox pushed back on the allegations that its own executives withheld documents, noting in its court filing on Wednesday that it “promptly and voluntarily” told Smartmatic about the mobile data it was missing.\n\n“There is zero evidence of any bad intent or culpability on the part of anyone at Fox to spoliate evidence or conceal anything,” Fox wrote.\n\nMeanwhile, each party has included a substantial number of redactions in recent court filings.\n\nErik Connolly, an attorney for Smartmatic, told the Washington Examiner that Fox is now making “baseless attacks” that are “nothing more than retaliation, a deliberate effort to avoid addressing its own destruction of evidence.\n\n“Fox continues to smear Smartmatic to distract from the truth: Fox lied following the 2020 election and has repeatedly lied to shield itself from accountability in this case,” Connolly said, claiming that contrary to the motion submitted Wednesday, the company has “preserved and produced evidence in accordance with New York law.”\n\nIn its court filing, Fox also emphasized Smartmatic’s past exposure to criminal and regulatory scrutiny, citing the company’s history of investigations “into bribery, tax evasion, and improper dealings with Hugo Chavez,” the late Venezuelan president who tapped Smartmatic to replace the country’s voting machines in 2004.\n\n“Smartmatic knew better,” Fox argued, saying the company had long been familiar with litigation and evidence preservation obligations.\n\nAccording to federal prosecutors, Piñate and other former Smartmatic officials paid $1 million in bribes to a former elections commissioner in the Philippines to secure $199 million in contracts for the country’s 2016 elections. During the end of the Biden administration, Piñate and three others were charged on Aug. 6 in South Florida with conspiracy to commit foreign bribery and money laundering.\n\nThe DOJ said the conspirators used inflated billing, sham contracts, and shell companies to move funds through bank accounts across Asia, Europe, and the U.S.\n\nSmartmatic, which denies criminal wrongdoing and previously placed Piñate and another executive on leave, said the company is not a party to the federal charges and that “no voter fraud has been alleged.” \n\nThe company maintains that Fox’s broadcasts falsely claiming Smartmatic helped rig the 2020 election severely damaged its business. Smartmatic is seeking $2.7 billion in damages and has vowed to take Fox to trial.\n\nThe case follows Fox’s record-setting $787.5 million settlement with Dominion Voting Systems in 2023. Earlier this year, Smartmatic also settled a parallel defamation lawsuit with Newsmax for $40 million, according to a regulatory filing.\n\nSMARTMATIC HEAD CHARGED WITH BRIBING PHILIPPINE ELECTION OFFICIALS FOR CONTRACTS\n\nBoth Smartmatic and Fox have filed motions asking the court to decide the case without a jury trial, and the voting tech company merely wants a jury to determine compensation. If those efforts fail and no settlement is reached, the lawsuit could proceed to trial later this year or by 2026.\n\nNow, with both sides locked in an intensifying pretrial battle, Fox is urging the court to weigh the alleged data deletions as grounds to limit Smartmatic’s claims sharply — potentially reshaping the trajectory of what remains one of the most consequential media defamation suits in U.S. history.","summary":"Fox News is asking a New York judge to impose sweeping sanctions against voting tech firm Smartmatic, accusing the company of systematically deleting mobile messages that undercut its $2.7 billion defamation claim.
