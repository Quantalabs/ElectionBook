China will firmly defend its sovereignty, security and development interests,\" the ministry said.\nThe response is notable at a time when both Beijing and Washington are signalling optimism and goodwill about reaching a deal to keep commercial ties between the world's two largest economies stable — after climbing down from sky‑high tariffs and harsh trade restrictions. It underscores China's confidence in playing hardball when dealing with the Trump administration, especially when trade is linked to its energy and foreign policies.\nUS Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, emerging from the talks, told reporters that when it comes to Russian oil purchases, the \"Chinese take their sovereignty very seriously\".\n\"We do not want to impede on their sovereignty, so they would like to pay a 100 per cent tariff,\" Bessent said.\nOn Thursday, he called the Chinese “tough” negotiators, but said China's pushback has not stalled the negotiations. \"I believe that we have the makings of a deal,\" Bessent told CNBC.\nGabriel Wildau, managing director of the consultancy Teneo, said he doubts President Donald Trump would actually deploy the 100 per cent tariff. \"Realising those threats would derail all the recent progress and probably kill any chance\" for Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping to announce a trade deal if they should meet this fall, Wildau said.\nIn seeking to restrict oil sales by Russia and Iran, a major source of revenue for both countries, the US wants to reduce the funding available for their militaries, as Moscow pursues its war against Ukraine and Tehran funds militant groups across the Middle East.\nChina plays hardball\nWhen Trump unveiled a sweeping plan for tariffs on dozens of countries in April, China was the only country that retaliated. It refused to give in to US pressure.\n\"If the US is bent on imposing tariffs, China will fight to the end, and this is China's consistent official stance,\" said Tu Xinquan, director of the China Institute for WTO Studies at the University of International Business and Economics in Beijing. WTO is the acronym for the World Trade Organization.\nNegotiating tactics aside, China may also suspect that the US will not follow through on its threat, questioning the importance Trump places on countering Russia, Tu said.\nScott Kennedy, senior adviser and trustee chair in Chinese business and economics at the Centre for Strategic and International Studies in Washington, said Beijing is unlikely to change its posture when it sees inconsistencies in US foreign policy goals toward Russia and Iran, whereas Beijing's policy support for Moscow is consistent and clear. It is also possible that Beijing may want to use it as another negotiating tool to extract more concessions from Trump, Kennedy said.\nDanny Russel, a distinguished fellow at the Asia Society Policy Institute, said Beijing now sees itself as \"the one holding the cards in its struggle with Washington\". He said Trump has made it clear he wants a \"headline-grabbing deal\" with Xi, \"so rejecting a US demand to stop buying oil from Iran or Russia is probably not seen as a deal-breaker, even if it generates friction and a delay\".\nContinuing to buy oil from Russia preserves Xi's \"strategic solidarity\" with Russian President Vladimir Putin and significantly reduces the economic costs for China, Russel said.\n\"Beijing simply cannot afford to walk away from the oil from Russia and Iran,\" he said. \"It is too important a strategic energy supply, and Beijing is buying it at fire-sale prices.\"\nChina depends on oil from Russia and Iran\nA 2024 report by the US Energy Information Administration estimates that roughly 80 per cent to 90 per cent of the oil exported by Iran went to China. The Chinese economy benefits from the more than one million (10 lakh) barrels of Iranian oil it imports per day.\nAfter the Iranian parliament floated a plan to shut down the Strait of Hormuz in June following US strikes on Iran's nuclear facilities, China spoke out against closing the critical oil transit route.\nChina also is an important customer for Russia, but is second to India in buying Russian seaborne crude oil exports. In April, Chinese imports of Russian oil rose 20 per cent over the previous month to more than 1.3 million (13 lakh) barrels per day, according to the KSE Institute, an analytical centre at the Kyiv School of Economics.\nThis past week, Trump said the US will impose a 25 per cent tariff on goods from India, plus an additional import tax because of India's purchasing of Russian oil. India's Foreign Ministry said on Friday its relationship with Russia was \"steady and time-tested\".\nStephen Miller, White House deputy chief of staff and a top policy adviser, said Trump has been clear that it is \"not acceptable\" for India to continue financing the Ukraine war by purchasing oil from Russia.\n\"People will be shocked to learn that India is basically tied with China in purchasing Russian oil,\" Miller said on Fox News Channel's \"Sunday Morning Futures\". He said the US needs \"to get real about dealing with the financing of this war\".","summary":"China has firmly rejected US demands to stop buying oil from Russia and Iran, stressing sovereignty and national interests, even as both nations continue trade talks to avoid heavy tariffs.","url":"https://telanganatoday.com/china-rejects-us-call-to-stop-oil-imports-from-russia-and-iran","image":"https://media.telanganatoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/China-and-US.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-08-04 01:22:13","author":null,"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"in","sentiment":0.062},{"id":347879714,"title":"What a marvel!

And with good reason: contact has almost always been disastrous for them, from enslavement during the 19th-century rubber boom to more recent land grabs by illegal loggers and cattle ranchers.\nBut that isolation has been interrupted in unusual fashion, thanks to the efforts of US-backed Christian evangelical groups turning to technological innovations to circumvent the restrictions.\n\nSubscribe to The Week\n\nEscape your echo chamber.

Uncontacted people do not have immunity to diseases common elsewhere, and \"it is not unusual for 50% of any one group to be wiped out within a year of first contact by diseases such as measles and influenza\".\nBut a joint investigation by The Guardian and the Brazilian newspaper O Globo discovered that \"solar-powered devices reciting biblical messages in Portuguese and Spanish\" have appeared among members of the isolated and mostly uncontacted Korubo people in the Javari valley, near the Brazil-Peru border. The \"yellow and grey mobile phone-sized unit\", seen by The Guardian, \"recites the Bible and inspirational talks by an American Baptist\".\nGovernment agents tasked with policing these regions say they have also spotted seaplanes and drones in the area. \"Missionary activity now threatens 13 of the 29 isolated peoples that Brazil officially recognises as definitively confirmed,\" said The Guardian, citing the federal prosecutor's office.\n'Destructive power'\nOne of the leading missionary organisations operating in the Javari territory is the New Tribes Mission of Brazil, an offshoot of the New Tribes Mission in the US. Established in 1942, it referred to uncontacted Indigenous people as \"brown gold\", also formerly the name of the organisation's newsletter. Renamed Ethnos360 in 2017, it has an annual budget of about $80 million (£59.5 million).\nDuring the Covid pandemic, it was reported that New Tribes Mission missionaries had been using seaplanes and a helicopter to fly over and map out uncontacted settlements in the Javari reserve.\nIn 2020, Brazil's highest court prohibited missionaries from entering the reserve, which Indigenous representatives had warned could bring about a \"genocide\".\nThe then president of Brazil, Jair Bolsonaro, a vocal vaccine sceptic, publicly sided with Christian evangelists. Earlier that year, he had appointed Ricardo Lopes Dias, a former evangelical missionary, to head the government's department for isolated and recently contacted tribes.\nAlthough the order remains in effect, Nelly Marubo, head of the Javari valley regional coordination office, told The Guardian that missionaries \"frequently\" visit the group's base in Javari, \"arriving directly by aircraft without passing government control posts\".\nIndigenous organisations and activists say it's crucial to reaffirm the non-contact policy. Technological outreach like audio Bibles might seem inoffensive curiosities, but Marubo said that the infiltration of outside religious and cultural beliefs has a \"destructive power\" for Indigenous groups. Exposure to \"colonising\" language and concepts \"ends up cutting through the essence of the culture\".\n\nExplore More\n\nChristianity\n\nSign up for Today's Best Articles in your inbox\nA free daily email with the biggest news stories of the day – and the best features from TheWeek.com\nContact me with news and offers from other Future brandsReceive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsorsBy submitting your information you agree to the Terms & Conditions and Privacy Policy and are aged 16 or over.\n\nGenevieve Bates\n\nAugust 3 editorial cartoons\n\nSunday’s political cartoons include a human data center, Donald Trump's enterprising spirit, and more\n\n5 darkly funny cartoons about Israel blocking aid to Gaza\n\nArtists take on forcing famine, avoiding aid, and more\n\nThe easy elegance of Cap Ferret\n\nThe Week Recommends\n'Elemental and otherworldly' destination is loved for its natural beauty\n\nYou might also like\n\nWhat has the Dalai Lama achieved?\n\nThe Explainer\nTibet’s exiled spiritual leader has just turned 90, and he has been clarifying his reincarnation plans\n\nThe Swedish church at the centre of a Russian spy drama\n\nUnder The Radar\nThe Russian Orthodox Church is accused of being an 'active tool' of Moscow's 'soft power'\n\nYes Band Aid, Ethiopians do know it's Christmas time\n\nIn the Spotlight\nEast African nation was one of the first to adopt Christianity, but celebrates with other Orthodox Christian churches on 7 January\n\nThe battlegrounds in Brazil’s presidential elections\n\nAnalysts fear democracy is under threat as violence erupts in run-up to ‘most polarised race in decades’\n\nWhat happened to Dom Phillips?\n\nBritish journalist feared dead after fisherman suspect led police to the remains of two men\n\nThe Russian religious leader providing ‘spiritual cover’ for Vladimir Putin’s war\n\nIn the Spotlight\nPatriarch Kirill I facing EU sanctions over support for Ukraine invasion\n\nGirl aged 12 is bishop for 45 minutes\n\nAnd other stories from the stranger side of life\n\nCoronavirus reaches remote Amazon tribe left devastated by flu deaths following first contact\n\nSix Covid cases recorded after activists warn of risk of repeating previous pandemics of viruses brought by outsiders\n\nView More ▸\n\nContact Future's experts\n\nTerms and Conditions\n\nPrivacy Policy\n\nCookie Policy\n\nAdvertise With Us\n\nThe Week is part of Future US Inc, an international media group and leading digital publisher.

The department said earlier this month that it had “sent more than 20 subpoenas to doctors and clinics involved in performing transgender medical procedures on children,” though it didn’t specify which individuals or entities it had subpoenaed.\n\n“These threats have no basis in law. No federal law prohibits, much less criminalizes, the provision or receipt of gender-affirming care for transgender adolescents,” the attorneys general argued.\n\nMore than two dozen states have passed bans on transgender care for children and teenagers, according to a CNN analysis of data from the Movement Advancement Project, a nonprofit think tank that advocates for LGBTQ rights. Those bans cover everything from puberty blockers and hormone therapy to surgeries, which are rarely performed on minors. But other states, including some that brought Friday’s lawsuit, have enacted laws seeking to protect access to such care for their residents.\n\nThe lawsuit argues in part that Trump’s actions are trampling over states’ “authority to regulate the practice of medicine and their considered judgment that access to this medical care for adolescents should be protected.”\n\nThe attorneys general behind the lawsuit are from New York, Massachusetts, Illinois, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Maine, Maryland, Michigan, Nevada, New Jersey, New Mexico, Rhode Island, Wisconsin and Washington, DC. Pennsylvania Democratic Gov. Josh Shapiro is also a plaintiff in the case.\n\nMajor mainstream medical associations — including the American Medical Association, the American Psychiatric Association, the Endocrine Society, the American Psychological Association, the American Academy of Pediatrics and the American Academy of Child & Adolescent Psychiatry — continue to advocate the practice of gender identity care and agree that it’s clinically appropriate care and can provide lifesaving treatment for children and adults.\n\nThe-CNN-Wire™ & © 2025 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.

Not between Russia and Ukraine, but with his own country. Don't go down the Sleepy Joe [a reference to former President Joe Biden] road!'\n\nResponding in a post on Truth Social, Mr Trump said: 'Based on the highly provocative statements of the Former President of Russia, Dmitry Medvedev, who is now the Deputy Chairman of the Security Council of the Russian Federation, I have ordered two nuclear submarines to be positioned in the appropriate regions. Words are very important and can often lead to unintended consequences. I hope this will not be one of those instances.\n\n'A threat was made… so we have to be very careful. We're going to protect our people. He's entering very dangerous territory!'\n\nOn Friday, in an interview with cable channel Newsmax, Mr Trump added: 'The subs are getting closer to Russia. We always want to be ready. I want to make sure his words are only words and nothing more than that.' \n\nDespite Russia and China both claiming no third country is being targeted by their military cooperation, Japan has objected to the joint drills - stating greater strategic coordination between Beijing and Moscow poses a 'strong concern' for its national security.\n\nWhilst announcing the drills on Wednesday, Zhang Xiaogang, a spokesman for Beijing’s defence ministry, criticised US Air Force drills with Japan and others in the western Pacific.\n\nMr Xiaogang said: 'The US has been blindly flexing its muscles in the Asia-Pacific region and attempting to use military drills as a pretext to gang up, intimidate and pressure other countries, and undermine peace and stability in the region.'\n\nChina and Russia have held military exercises together for over 20 years, with 'Joint Sea' exercises beginning in 2012.\n\nHowever, their cooperation, which was once sporadic, has deepened over the past decade, with Vladimir Putin and Xi Jinping having met more than 40 times.\n\nLast night, the White House, Pentagon and Downing Street refused to comment on the escalating tensions, which come just days before Mr Trump's August 8 deadline for Putin to declare a ceasefire in the war against Ukraine.\n\nThe US President has vowed to impose 'devastating' sanctions on Russia and her closest trading partners if his demands are not met.\n\nA source close to the President told the MoS: 'Trump is running out of patience with Russia. He promised to end the Ukraine war within 24 hours of taking office and clearly that has not happened.\n\n'Now he's threatening to impose sanctions if Putin doesn't declare a ceasefire and come to the negotiating table to discuss peace.'\n\nWhile the location of the subs is unknown, the US Navy has 71 nuclear-powered submarines in its fleet, all of which can travel thousands of miles without resurfacing.\n\nBy comparison, the Russian Navy fields fewer than 30 nuclear‑powered submarines. Military experts said Mr Trump will most likely have deployed two Ohio -class vessels.\n\nEach is armed with up to 20 Trident II D5 missiles that can deliver multiple thermonuclear warheads with a range of up to 7,000 miles.\n\nSources last night told the Washington Post that Russia is 'seeking clarity' from America about Mr Trump's 'actions and intentions', with Russian officials scrambling to assess the significance of the subs' deployment.\n\nRIA Novosti, a state-controlled news agency which has been called 'Putin's mouthpiece', confirmed it had sent enquiries to the White House, Pentagon, US Central Command and the National Security Council, but had not received a response.\n\nMr Trump's dramatic doubling down came after the deadliest Russian air strike on Kyiv this year, when 31 people were killed in a single missile strike on an apartment block in the early hours of Thursday morning.\n\nFive children, the youngest aged just two, were among the dead.\n\nMr Trump called the air strike 'disgusting' and announced he was sending his special envoy Steve Witkoff to the region to try and negotiate a ceasefire.\n\nRussian lawmaker Viktor Vodolatsky said there are enough Russian nuclear submarines in the high seas to tackle the two American subs.\n\n'The number of Russian nuclear submarines in the world's oceans is significantly higher than the American ones, and the subs that US President Donald Trump ordered to be redirected to the appropriate regions have long been under their control,' he said yesterday.\n\n'So no response from the Russian Federation to the American leader's statement about the submarines is required.'\n\nRetired US Marine Colonel Mark Cancian called Mr Trump's announcement that he had sent subs steaming towards Russian waters 'highly unusual'.\n\nHe said: 'This is signalling in its purest form.'\n\nOthers urged restraint, saying Mr Medvedev does not speak for Putin.\n\nOligarch Mikhail Khodorkovsky, now a Putin critic living in London, said: 'When you see his [Mr Medvedev's] latest apocalyptic tweet about turning European capitals to dust, remember: this isn't strategic communication from the Kremlin. It's the rambling of a man drowning his terror in vodka.","summary":"In retaliation to US President Donald Trump moving submarines closer to Russia, Putin has begun 'war game training' with China in a bleak display of their allied force.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-14967297/After-Trump-moves-nuclear-submarines-close-Russia-Putin-responds-beginning-war-game-training-China-bleak-combined-force.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/08/03/23/100892131-0-image-m-31_1754259234074.jpg","video":"https://videos.dailymail.co.uk/video/mol/2025/07/28/8104589310845762029/1024x576_MP4_8104589310845762029.mp4","publish_date":"2025-08-04 00:47:55","author":"Editor,Freya Barnes","authors":["Editor","Freya Barnes"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":0.005},{"id":347873434,"title":"Unsettling detail in Sydney protest photo","text":"About 90,000 people, including famous faces, braved the rain and descended on the iconic landmark with placards and flags in hand to call for an end to the war in Gaza after the Supreme Court rejected a last-minute application to block the protest on Saturday.\n\nThe rally, organised by the Palestine Action Group, was largely well-behaved despite police intervention over fears of a crowd crush.\n\nBut one protester has sparked outrage online after holding up a photo of Iranian dictator Ayatollah Ali Khamenei during the demonstration. \n\nPictures of the event show the large portrait of Khamenei with a rifle, held up behind WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange, activist Craig Foster and former journalist Mary Kostakidis. \n\nGet all the latest Australian news as it happens — download the news.com.au app direct to your phone.\n\nShortly after the protest, Jeremy Leibler, the President of the Zionist Federation of Australia, took to social media on Sunday to call out the “giant portrait of Ayatollah Khamenei – the dictator who jails women, executes gays, funds terror, and calls for Israel’s destruction” on display behind the prominent figures. \n\n“This wasn’t a march for justice. It was a mask drop,” he wrote on X.\n\nIsrael’s Foreign Minister Gideon Sa’ar further condemned the sight, accusing the “radical Left and fundamentalist Islam” of “dragging the West toward the sidelines of history”.\n\n“Radical protesters at Sydney Harbour Bridge today holding an image of Iran’s ‘Supreme Leader’ — the most dangerous leader of fundamentalist Islam, the world’s largest exporter of terror and a mass executioner,” Sa’ar wrote on X.\n\nKhamenei, the head of the Iranian regime and the religious leader of some 200 million Shia Muslims, has been in power for over three decades following the death of his predecessor, Ruhollah Khomeini, in 1989.\n\nIn 2022, he condemned protests which made international headlines following the death in custody of Kurdish-Iranian woman Mahsa Amini.\n\nIn July, US President Donald Trump called Khamenei an “easy target” and warned the US would not kill him “for now” amid Iran’s 12-day war with Isreael.\n\n90,000 march across iconic bridge\n\nIn Sydney, thousands of protesters started crossing the bridge about 2pm on Sunday, chanting “free, free Palestine” and waving placards.\n\nSome could also be heard chanting “death, death to the IDF”, a reference to the Israeli Defence Force.\n\nThe number of protesters far exceeded the 10,000 estimated to attend.\n\nSydney Lord Mayor Clover Moore lent her support to the protesters saying: “Discomfort from traffic can’t be compared to what’s happening in Gaza”.\n\nJewish Council of Australia Executive Officer Sarah Schwartz backed the protest saying the marchers were “crying out for moral leadership”.\n\n“It is a time for all of us, including those in positions of power, to do everything they can to halt an active genocide and stand with the people of Gaza.”\n\n‘Almost catastrophic’: Fears of crowd crush \n\nAt about 3pm, NSW Police issued an urgent request for protesters to stop marching on safety fears, citing a possible “crush” at the northern end of the bridge.\n\n“Participants have been asked to stop proceeding across the bridge to avoid a crowd crush at the northern end of the harbour bridge,” the police said in what they called a “protest safety intervention”.\n\n“Once the procession has come to a halt, protesters will be asked to turn around and walk back toward Wynyard to avoid a risk of injury due to the huge number of people taking part.\n\n“Police believe the safest route back is to walk back across the bridge given the huge numbers to avoid overwhelming the public transport system and a potential crowd crush scenario.”\n\nThe crowd started dispersing from the bridge about 3.30pm and traffic started crossing the bridge about 4.30pm.\n\nActing Assistant Commissioner Adam Johnson said police narrowly avoided a “catastrophic situation” and feared the incident would result in a “potential loss of life”.\n\n“I can honestly say in my 35 years of policing, that was a perilous situation,” Acting Assistant Commissioner Johnson said at a press conference after the protest. \n\n“I was honestly worried that we were going to have a major incident with potential loss of life.”\n\nHe commended the response of police who had “really think about how we could get people safely out of that confined space and back into the city safely”.\n\n“It came very close to us having almost a catastrophic situation”.\n\nSpeaking to ABC News Breakfast on Monday morning, he thanked the crowd for their behaviour.“They were very, very compliant. Minimal issues with no arrests. That went a long way to assisting us in resolving what could have been a very dire incident,” he said. \n\nThousands turn out in Melbourne\n\nAnother pro-Palestine protest formed outside Melbourne’s State Library, with organisers walking to the King Street Bridge in solidarity with the Harbour Bridge demonstration.\n\nThe Melbourne protesters reached a police barrier ahead of the bridge.\n\nOfficers in riot gear blocked the protesters from crossing the bridge, where the protesters themselves were planning to engage a blockade.\n\nOne protester at the rally was seen with a sign reading: “death, death to the IDF”.\n\nAnother burned an Australian flag on the road.\n\n– With NCA NewsWire","summary":"As tens of thousands of protesters marched across the Sydney Harbour Bridge on Sunday, one unsettling sight has been condemned online.","url":"https://www.news.com.au/national/nsw-act/news/unsettling-detail-in-sydney-propalestine-protest-photo/news-story/0cd0f074ea23cd940c3277af09ab2d74?from=rss-basic","image":"https://content.api.news/v3/images/bin/bc082caff77bea18406b5c67c5fc1d6b","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-08-04 00:30:49","author":"Brielle Burns","authors":["Brielle Burns"],"language":"en","source_country":"au","sentiment":0.039},{"id":347873344,"title":"‘Low key filth’ now tainting Panthers legacy","text":"Isn’t consigning the rest of the NRL to a cowering heap after four premierships enough to satisfy these power drunk megalomaniacs?\n\nWhy do they feel the need to resort to the type of antagonism and pubescent cheating you’d usually associate with carnival folk or Mick Ennis? \n\nFOX LEAGUE, available on Kayo Sports, is the only place to watch every game of every round in the 2025 NRL Telstra Premiership, LIVE with no ad-breaks during play.

Email tips@dailymail.com\nBy MELODY FLETCHER \n Published:00:56 BST, 4 August 2025 |Updated:01:05 BST, 4 August 2025 \n\nChristine McGuinness has made a thinly-veiled dig at her ex husband Paddy as she opened up about her sexuality.\nThe 37-year-old model is in the current line-up for the new series of E4's Celebs Go Dating after splitting the Top Gear star in 2022.\nChristine, who shares three kids with Paddy, 51, described her new way of dating as her being a 'free spirit' and she is 'enjoying' spending time with women.\n'Now I'm enjoying spending time with women,' she told The Sun. 'I can just have a deeper connection with a woman.\n'I like someone who knows what they want and isn't playing games.'\nChristine says she refuses to put a label on her sexuality, but Paddy knew about it when they were together. \n\nChristine McGuinness has made a thinly-veiled dig at her ex husband Paddy as she opened up about her sexuality\n\nChristine says she refuses to put a label on her sexuality, but Paddy knew about it when they were together (pictured in 2019)\nShe continued: 'My ex-husband knew about it from when we first met and was fine with it.'\nThe telly star admitted that for the past three years, she has been involved with women only, including the likes of DJ Roxxxan and Chelcee Grimes.\nIt comes after Christine gave an update on her relationship with former husband Paddy after they split.\nDiscussing the reality of co-parenting with Paddy, Christine told Amy Hart's podcast: 'I've been separated from my ex husband for three years. We get on really well.\n'We still live at home together, but of course, I want some adult company. I can't just sit and be with children all day, every day.\n'I like that time out - being away from home when I'm working - but I haven't got that time out being away from home not working and just enjoying some adult company.\n'I haven't had that, so I got the opportunity and thought, You know what? Why not? I understand myself, so I'll be fine.\n'I'll manage it and it was just a step too far.' \n\nThe telly star admitted that for the past three years, she has been involved with women only, including the likes of DJ Roxxxan and Chelcee Grimes\n\nThe model is in the current line-up for the new series of E4's Celebs Go Dating after splitting the Top Gear star in 2022\n'I found it quite overwhelming, so I listened to myself and I'm really, really proud that I recognised how I felt...\n'I went home to my children after two weeks. I was supposed to do 10 weeks of filming - and I'd done two weeks - and I'm really, really proud of myself that I did what was right for me.'\nShe added: 'If something doesn't feel right for you, physically, mentally, emotionally, it's okay to leave.\n'That's something I tell my children quite a lot, because being autistic, you can stay and do what other people want you to do.\n'I think it's really, really important to know that you can leave the party, you can leave the job, leave the event, you can leave the relationship at any time.'\nChristine McGuinnessAmy HartTop Gear\n\nShare or comment on this article: \nChristine McGuinness makes thinly veiled dig at ex husband Paddy and admits she 'wants to have a deeper connection with women'\n\nAdd comment\n\nComments 11\n\n Share what you think\n\nWorst rated\n\nThe comments below have not been moderated.\n\nThe views expressed in the contents above are those of our users and do not necessarily reflect the views of MailOnline.\n\nAdd your comment\n\nEnter your comment\n\nBy posting your comment you agree to our house rules.\n\nSubmit Comment\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual.\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual\n\nWe will automatically post your comment and a link to the news story to your Facebook timeline at the same time it is posted on MailOnline.

Colbert's character will host the fictional show, Way Late with Scotty Bristol, according to Vulture, which first reported the news.\n\n Representatives for Colbert did not immediately respond to EW's inquiries, while a rep for CBS declined to comment.\n\n The timing of Colbert's newest CBS collab is certainly auspicious. Late last month, the network announced that The Late Show With Stephen Colbert would conclude next year, ending the franchise — which began with David Letterman in 1993 — after 33 years on the air. \n\n EW has learned that plans for Colbert's appearance on Elsbeth were set in motion months before that announcement. Back in February, Colbert welcomed Elsbeth star Wendell Pierce to The Late Show and, during their conversation, said that he's been dying to appear on a procedural like Elsbeth.\n\n \"I want to be the body that’s found behind the pile of lettuce boxes or something like that,\" he joked.\n\n Pierce immediately offered to help out: \"I can make that happen,” he quipped. \"I know a guy who knows a guy. We can get you on.\"\n\n Whether Colbert will be a murderer, an ally, or a produce-stashed corpse remains to be seen, but it seems Pierce delivered on his promise to make a few calls. \n\n A spinoff of The Good Wife and The Good Fight, Elsbeth follows the astute but unconventional attorney Elsbeth Tascioni (Carrie Preston) as she uses her unique observations to solve a new murder each week. As a guest star, Colbert is in esteemed company; the series has also welcomed Nathan Lane, Keegan-Michael Key, Laurie Metcalf, Mary-Louise Parker, Laura Benanti, Matthew Broderick, and more.\n\n With the new season set to arrive in October, the comedian will remain busy hosting his actual late-night show until May.\n\n Sign up for Entertainment Weekly's free daily newsletter to get breaking TV news, exclusive first looks, recaps, reviews, interviews with your favorite stars, and more.\n\n In announcing the end of The Late Show, CBS said its decision to pull the plug on the franchise was \"purely a financial one\" and that it wasn't \"related in any way to the show's performance, content or other matters happening at Paramount.\"\n\n But many critics have questioned the timing of the announcement, pointing out that Colbert had recently criticized CBS' corporate parent, Paramount Global, for agreeing to pay $16 million to President Donald Trump over an interview with former Vice President Kamala Harris that aired on 60 Minutes in November. Trump has long disliked late-night hosts' jokes about his administration and celebrated news of The Late Show's cancellation on social media, writing that Colbert's \"talent was even less than his ratings.\n\n For his part, Colbert has not backed down, continuing to openly criticize Trump and his administration throughout the president's second term. Reacting to Trump's post about his cancellation, Colbert said, \"How dare you sir. Would an untalented man be able to compose the following satirical witticism: Go f--- yourself.\"","summary":"You can take the late-night show away from the host, but you can't drag the host away from late-night.","url":"https://ew.com/stephen-colbert-gets-new-cbs-late-night-gig-elsbeth-season-3-11783962","image":"https://ew.com/thmb/PpsjoVhwCTRybQlvvuIzPkWzSVU=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/stephen-colbert-080325-15f9350248834d599b844c62a382842e.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-08-04 00:03:36","author":"Shania Russell","authors":["Shania Russell"],"language":"en","category":"sports","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.105},{"id":347873520,"title":"'The View' co-host describes Harris interview as 'microcosm of everything that's wrong' with Democratic Party","text":"\"The View\" co-host Alyssa Farah Griffin described former Vice President Kamala Harris' interview with Stephen Colbert as a \"microcosm\" of everything that's wrong with the Democratic Party after the party lost in 2024. \"I was struck by, I’m going to try not be too harsh on this. This interview felt like a microcosm of everything that’s wrong with Democrats post-election. I’m going to CBS and this sort of trying to make a point that they fired Stephen Colbert, which many on the left called an attack on democracy, a man who was making $20 million a year, someone I hold in high esteem, but the economics of his show were not working,\" Griffin said during an appearance on CNN's \"Table for Five\" on Saturday. CBS announced in July that they would be ending Colbert's late-night show at the end of the next broadcast season, citing financial reasons. However, Colbert's liberal allies believe the cancellation was political, as it came days after he criticized CBS' parent company, Paramount, for settling with President Donald Trump. \"He was losing $40 million a year. He was in the Ed Sullivan Theater, which is expensive, to talk about the plight of democracy at CBS, a network that’s having its own struggles right now, rather than talking about the economics of the situation and playing to something a shrinking audience that is network television, not realizing it’s not where the American voters are,\" Griffin, an anti-Trump Republican who voted for Harris in 2024, continued. KAMALA HARRIS SCOLDS ‘PILING ON’ AGAINST JOE BIDEN WHEN ASKED ABOUT SEPARATING HERSELF DURING 2024 CAMPAIGN Griffin said Harris decision to appear on Colbert was like \"announcing your exploratory committee on the sinking deck of the Titanic.\" CNN data analyst Harry Enten dismissed Harris' comments during the interview about a broken system. \"Recently, I made the decision that I just – for now, I don’t want to go back in the system. I think it’s broken,\" Harris told Colbert after he asked about her declining a potential California gubernatorial run. \"I just can‘t possibly believe that someone who was attorney general for a good period of time, a United States senator for a good period of time, and then vice president for four years and then ran for president, all of a sudden believes that the best way to solve it is from being outside the system. Oh, please. Not a chance on God‘s green earth that that’s necessarily the case,\" Enten said, reacting to Harris' remarks. CNN PANEL SHREDS HARRIS' COLBERT INTERVIEW FOR HER LACK OF SOLUTIONS AFTER 'SIX MONTHS TO FIGURE IT OUT' \"What‘s probably going on is she saw what the polling numbers were, perhaps for her running for governor of California. Yes, she has left open the idea that maybe she could run in 2028 for the Democratic nomination. But I‘ll tell you Abby, I‘ve looked at those numbers. She would be the weakest front-runner since 1992.

I mean, Stephen A Smith, he's just like every other talk show host.”\n\nSmith made it clear that, while he disagreed with the parallel drawn, other remarks by the first lady had irritated him more.\n\n“You said a vote for Trump was a vote against you and a vote against y'all as women,” Smith said. “I want to stay for the record, I took major offense to that. Black men don't just love our black women, we revere y'all. \n\n“It's who we are. And to say what you said back then, I think to this day, is the only thing that I didn't like that you said, I didn't appreciate it.”\n\nAt a rally in Michigan in October, Obama told rally-goers that she was “a little frustrated” by things she had heard about why people were not fully getting behind Harris’ shot at the presidency.\n\nSpeaking directly to men, she emphasized how further restrictions on abortion and other aspects of women’s health care, proposed by the Trump campaign, would impact them and their sons, too.\n\n“I am asking y'all from the core of my being to take our lives seriously — please,” Obama said. “Do not put our lives in the hands of politicians — mostly men — who have no clue or do not care about what we, as women, are going through.”\n\nThis struck a chord with Smith, who pointed out in his podcast episode that there were many other reasons that such men may have chosen not to vote for Harris, including the economy, national security and even immigration.\n\n“You will never hear me utter a negative word about you, but I respectfully disagreed and still remain pretty salty about what you said about us.”\n\nHe added that he was “even more adamant about what your husband, Barack Obama said,” referring to the former president’s berating of young Black male voters, who he subtly accused of being misogynistic with their voting habits.\n\nHe pundit, who himself has been linked with a presidential run, added that he though Michelle Obama would have beaten Trump in 2024, and any other GOP candidate if she chooses to run for office.","summary":"The ESPN host said that the former First Lady’s rhetoric while campaigning for former vice president Kamala Harris had left him feeling ‘pretty salty’","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/stephen-a-smith-michelle-obama-trump-voters-b2801286.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/08/03/23/46/Smith-Obama-(1).png?width=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/wekzqR3H-4VHSaSK0.mp4","publish_date":"2025-08-03 23:47:29","author":"Mike Bedigan","authors":["Mike Bedigan"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.391},{"id":347868704,"title":"‘Racist sleazebag’: Trump lashes out","text":"President Donald Trump has lashed out at broadcaster Charlamagne tha God over his comments on the Jeffrey Epstein case.\n\n“I think this Epstein thing is going to be a way for traditional conservatives to take their party back.

The MAGA base isn’t letting this issue go. And for the first time, they know they can probably take their party back and not piss off the MAGA base.

He has directed his staff to assist the Texas lawmakers with any necessary support during their stay.Newsweek has reached out to Pritzker's office by email outside of normal business hours on Sunday.Why It MattersHistorically, the party in the White House loses seats, and Republicans currently have a slim majority in both the U.S. House and Senate, giving Democrats hopes of retaking at least one of the houses of Congress in next year's midterms.Texas Republicans have sought to redraw the districting map in an effort to bolster nationwide party chances of retaining the U.S. House of Representatives in the 2026 midterm elections. Republicans in other states with significant battleground contests coming up have also looked to follow a similar path.What To KnowMore than 51 Democratic members of the Texas House of Representatives departed the state on Sunday, aiming to deny the chamber a quorum and prevent passage of a proposed Republican map before a scheduled floor vote. The Texas House requires the presence of at least 100 of its 150 members to conduct business.With only 62 Democratic members in the chamber, their collective absence can halt legislative proceedings, according to the Associated Press.Texas Governor Greg Abbott, a Republican, had called a special session to address the flooding that killed 135 people last month in Texas Hill Country and the redistricting plan, which would redraw congressional boundaries and could potentially increase Republican-held seats from 25 to as many as 30 out of Texas' 38 districts.The AP reported that Trump urged Texas Republicans to redraw the map.The map targets Democratic-leaning areas in cities such as Austin, Dallas, Houston, and regions in south Texas. Republican leaders advanced their proposal through committee on Saturday and scheduled a key floor vote for Monday, prompting the Democrats' walkout.Texas Democrats had pulled a similar move in 2021 in order to block new voting restrictions that the state legislature was trying to pass.However, Texas House Speaker Dustin Burrows warned his colleagues across the aisle that should they deny his party a quorum, then \"all options will be on the table.\" Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton echoed that sentiment, writing on X that the party should use \"every tool at our disposal\" to deal with the runaway Democrats.Existing House rules allow for the arrest and fining of members for breaking quorum, including proposed $500-per-day fines, although they may prove difficult to enforce while lawmakers remain outside Texas, where state jurisdiction does not apply, according to ABC News.What People Are SayingTexas Attorney General Ken Paxton wrote on X on Sunday: \"Democrats in the Texas House who try and run away like cowards should be found, arrested, and brought back to the Capitol immediately. We should use every tool at our disposal to hunt down those who think they are above the law.\"Texas state Representative Gene Wu, chair of the House Democratic Caucus, in a statement: \"This is not a decision we make lightly, but it is one we make with absolute moral clarity. We're not walking out on our responsibilities; we're walking out on a rigged system that refuses to listen to the people we represent.\"Democratic Party Chair Ken Martin in a statement said: \"For weeks, we've been warning that if Republicans in Texas want a showdown—if they want to delay flood relief to cravenly protect Donald Trump from an inevitable midterm meltdown—then we'd give them that showdown. That's exactly what Texas Democrats did today: blowing up Republicans' sham special session that's virtually ignored the plight of flood victims in Kerr County.\"What Happens Next?Texas Republicans will attempt to find legal means of passing the proposed redistricting, though that may lead to a drawn-out legal battle.The U.S. Supreme Court is already reviewing a dispute over redistricting in Louisiana, and earlier this year overturned a lower court decision that ruled South Carolina's congressional map was unconstitutional.This article includes reporting by the Associated Press.","summary":"Democrats have left Texas for a second time in four years in an effort to block a vote by denying the legislature a quorum.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/texas-democrats-head-chicago-effort-block-redistricting-map-2108293","image":"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2695746/texas-representative-gene-wu-chicago.jpg?w=1600&h=900&q=88&f=06057cfb5eb22c328562395a15b306d9","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-08-03 23:27:30","author":"Peter Aitken","authors":["Peter Aitken"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.387},{"id":347869968,"title":"US Abandons Maglev Train Plans as China Rapidly Develops Technology","text":"President Donald Trump's administration pulled funding this week for a proposed high-speed magnetic levitation (Maglev) rail line connecting Washington D.C. and Baltimore.Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy told The Baltimore Sun on Friday that he couldn't \"in good conscience keep taxpayers on the hook\" for the 26.6-mile line and cancelled over $26 million in funding.Newsweek called the Department of Transportation on Saturday outside of regular office hours for comment.Why It MattersThe United States doesn't currently have any operational high speed rail lines as defined by the International Union of Railways (UIC), but two are currently under construction in California and other projects have been proposed across the nation.However, supporters of high-speed rail are nervous about the Trump administration's attitude after it revoked $4 billion in federal funding for an under-construction line intended to connect San Francisco and Los Angeles as well as a $63.9 million grant for a project in Texas.What To KnowThe Maglev line was planned to connect Baltimore to Washington D.C. with a journey time of less than 15 minutes using magnetic levitation, a technique that sees trains held above the track by electromagnets removing the friction associated with traditional wheels.On Friday Secretary Duffy told The Sun that federal funding for the project had been scrapped, commenting: \"This project lacked everything needed to be a success from planning to execution. This project did not have the means to go the distance, and I can't in good conscience keep taxpayers on the hook for it.\"Two federal grants totaling over $26 million for the project were cancelled, while support was also pulled for an environmental study needed to acquire a construction permit.Maglev technology has been developed in Japan since 2002 and testing has also taken place in China where one line achieved speeds of over 620 miles per hour, faster than many commercial aircraft.Maryland Governor Wes Moore was an enthusiastic backer of the project, and in April visited a team working on the technology in Japan where he said: \"You have in me, and you have in our team, very excited partners to be able to continue to push forward... We like moving fast, and 315 miles per hour feels about right.\"Federal figures show nearly $27 million had been spent on the Maglev project in Maryland.What People Are SayingSpeaking to Newsweek Professor R. Richard Geddes, a transportation infrastructure specialist at Cornell University, said: \"Secretary of Transportation Sean Duffy announced that the federal government will cancel $26 million in funds for Baltimore to DC maglev project. This is welcome news. The extremely expensive maglev train project between Baltimore and Washington D.C. has faced significant delays, cost overruns, and local opposition.\"The passenger rail route from Baltimore to Washington is already well served by both Amtrak and MARC trains. There are also several major highways serving the same route. It is unlikely that, even if completed, that revenue from ridership would be sufficient ridership to even cover that line's operational costs, much less its capital cost.\"There are higher-value passenger rail projects on which this money could be spent to improve Amtrak's service in the Northeast Corridor.

The scale of the Republican Party's triumph in November—taking the White House, flipping the Senate, and maintaining control of the House—has sparked soul-searching within the Democratic Party over what went wrong and how to rebuild.The Democratic Party has struggled with unpopularity and internal dissatisfaction since the sweeping defeat, facing pronounced ideological and generational divides, compounded by widespread voter frustration with congressional leaders and the party's overall direction.Democratic leaders have come under criticism from within, some for pushing the party too far left, and others for appearing too conciliatory toward Trump, and a number who have felt disillusioned with its agenda have left the party entirely to either identify as independent or as a Republican.What To Know An Associated Press-NORC poll of 1,437 adults found that many Democrats are dissatisfied with their own party. When asked to describe the Democratic Party, respondents frequently offered negative words such as \"weak,\" \"tepid,\" \"apathetic,\" \"ineffective\" and \"broken.\"Overall, 35 percent of Democrats used a negative term to describe their party, whereas 23 percent cited positive terms. Over 40 percent of Republicans cited positive terms related to their party, with 19 percent expressing dissatisfaction.However, among all the poll's participants, more people associated negative traits with the GOP, 43 percent, than with the Democratic Party, at 39 percent.The poll, which was conducted between July 10-14, was published on Sunday and has a margin of error of plus or minus 3.6 percentage points. The makeup of the poll was 35 percent Democrats, 27 percent independents, and 37 percent Republicans.The poll comes days after the Wall Street Journal published a poll finding that the Democratic Party's image has deteriorated to its lowest point in over three decades according to the newspaper's records that date back to 1990. It also comes shortly after July jobs report was released, which showed that the U.S. labor market has slowed over the past few months, with unemployment inching upward and prior job gains revised to be weaker than expected.What People Are Saying Democratic National Committee (DNC) chair Ken Martin said on NewsNation's The Hill Sunday on August 3: \"We are a party that needs to focus on getting back to an economic message that gives people a sense that we're fighting for them, but we don't need to abandon our values. We've been the party fighting for the working class and the poor, but we are also the party that's always fought against discrimination, bigotry, harassment, and people being bullied out of the conversation. We'll continue to do that.\"John Anzalone, a Democratic pollster who worked on the Wall Street Journal survey in July, said: \"The Democratic brand is so bad that they don't have the credibility to be a critic of Trump or the Republican Party. Until they reconnect with real voters and working people on who they're for and what their economic message is, they're going to have problems.\"Senator Cory Booker, a New Jersey Democrat, said in a speech on the Senate floor Tuesday about advancing a package of bills: \"This, to me, is a problem with Democrats in America right now, is we're willing to be complicit to Donald Trump, to let this pass through when we have all the leverage right now...We are standing at a moment where our president is eviscerating the Constitution of the United States of America, and we're willing to go along with it today. No. No. Not on my watch.\"What Happens Next?Democrats are continuing to work out the direction of the party as they prepare for the 2025 gubernatorial elections and the 2026 midterms, when they aim to win back voters who shifted toward Trump last year.New Jersey and Virginia will hold gubernatorial elections in November as both the incumbent governors are term-limited.","summary":"A newly released AP-NORC poll found that more than one-third of Democrats described their own party in negative terms.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/significant-number-democrats-view-party-negatively-poll-2108290","image":"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2695743/capitol-building.jpg?w=1600&h=900&q=88&f=ce4e73a6e91625bbb4208261168aa0ba","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-08-03 23:12:30","author":"Mandy Taheri","authors":["Mandy Taheri"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.204},{"id":347873868,"title":"Americans don't buy Netanyahu’s lie about Gaza hunger crisis","text":"Survey Says is a weekly series rounding up the most important polling trends or data points you need to know about, plus a vibe check on a trend that’s driving politics.\n\nA man-made famine in Gaza\n\nOn Tuesday, a United Nations-affiliated organization released a damning report about the “worst-case scenario for famine” occurring in the Gaza Strip. Over 20,000 children have been treated for severe malnutrition, and at least 16 child deaths have been tied to starvation. Israel’s blockade of aid is the primary cause of the crisis, with the director-general of the World Health Organization referring to the mass starvation as “man-made.” \n\nAnd yet, last Sunday, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu falsely claimed, “There is no starvation in Gaza”—a lie too brazen for even noted liar President Donald Trump.\n\n“Some of those kids are—that's real starvation stuff,” Trump said on Monday. “I see it, and you can't fake that.”\n\nAnd the vast majority of America sees it too. New polling from YouGov finds that 68% of Americans agree there is a hunger crisis in Gaza. That includes majorities of Democrats (84%), independents (65%), and Republicans (55%). Just 5% of Americans say there isn’t a crisis.\n\nPluralities of Americans also think Israel (46%) and the U.S. (43%) should be doing more to end the mass starvation.\n\nAll of this hits as fewer Americans than ever before support Israel’s military actions in Gaza, which have claimed the lives of 60,000 Gazans, including 18,500 children, though studies suggest the true number of deaths is higher.\n\nSixty percent of Americans disapprove of Israel’s military campaign in Gaza, according to new data from Gallup. Only 32% approve of it, beating the previous low of 36% in March 2024.\n\nRepublicans are most supportive of Israel’s campaign, with 71% approving. But support has tumbled among independents (25%) and cratered among Democrats (8%). In the previous poll, conducted last September, support among independents and Democrats was 16 percentage points higher for each.\n\nHowever, Gallup’s poll finished fielding on July 21, before the latest round of high-profile reporting on the budding famine in Gaza, and before a prominent Republican lawmaker called the crisis there a “genocide.” So it’s easy to imagine that support for Israel’s action in Gaza is even lower now.\n\nBurning down the house\n\nUnder Trump, the Environmental Protection Agency no longer wants to protect the environment or the people living in it. On Tuesday, the agency announced it will move to rescind the primary legal grounds it has used to curb the emissions that fuel climate change.\n\nBut the Trump administration is doing this with virtually no public mandate. \n\nMajorities of every demographic—men, women, every race, age group, and income bracket—want the government to maintain or expand its restrictions on greenhouse gas emissions, according to the latest YouGov/The Economist poll. \n\nWell, every demographic save one. Only Republicans are below majority level, with just 36% saying the government should maintain or expand emissions restrictions. Twenty-nine percent want to see them reduced, and 18% want them eliminated—which, when combined, is also not a majority of Republicans.\n\nMeanwhile, a plurality of every other demographic wants to see restrictions not just maintained but also expanded.\n\nThe same phenomenon repeats across other questions in the poll. \n\nIs the government doing too much or not enough to fight climate change? A majority or plurality of every demographic says “not enough”—except for Republicans, 32% of whom say it’s doing “too much” and 38% of whom say it’s doing “about the right amount.”\n\nIs the climate changing because of human activity, as the universal scientific consensus says is the case? A majority or plurality of every demographic thinks so—except for Republicans, a plurality of whom (46%) admits the climate is changing but claims that humans aren’t to blame.\n\nOne reason for this head-in-sand resistance to addressing climate change is that the issue cuts to the root of conservatism itself. To accept the gravity of the crisis requires people to see their actions as potentially harmful and to think outside of themselves. To address the crisis will require large-scale collective action—government action, to be specific. It will require us to change, which conservatism, in its very name, opposes.\n\nBut perhaps “conservatism” is a misnomer. Conservative actions on climate change, like those taken by Trump’s EPA, will lead to habitat collapse, environmental destruction, and the loss of human life. How does that “conserve” anything?\n\nThrough the looking glass\n\nA new poll shows Trump with his worst net approval rating yet: +2 points. Fifty percent of voters approve of the job he’s doing as president, and 48% disapprove.\n\nWait, what? \n\nYes, while most polls show Trump’s approval rating in the dumps, not every poll does. The results above are from a poll conducted by two right-wing pollsters, InsiderAdvantage and the Trafalgar Group. The latter firm has notoriously secretive methods, but it retains just enough credibility that mainstream polling averages, like those from The New York Times and election analyst Nate Silver, don’t outright disregard them. (Thankfully, those averages are smart and adjust polls for firms’ partisan bias.)\n\nHowever, these polls tell us something key about the right-wing media ecosystem: You gotta keep the big guy happy.\n\nIn the world of right-wing polls, Trump’s approval rating is underwater but just barely. In a simple average of polls in July, 47.4% of the country approves of Trump’s job as president, while 49.8% disapproves, according to polls that political analyst Mary Radcliffe aggregated and that Daily Kos identified as coming from Republican-aligned firms. (Radcliffe is a former colleague of mine at 538.)\n\nThe use of the decimal point in those numbers is important because in no month has this average of GOP-aligned polls shown that a majority of the country disapproves of Trump. \n\nMeanwhile, in a simple average of all polls from all pollsters, Trump hit majority disapproval in April, likely due to his reviled tariff plan. More complex averages, run by the Times and Silver, show this as well.\n\nIn fact, as Trump’s average approval rating has sunk, Republican pollsters have broken more and more with the mainstream average, as if to lift their guy’s spirits. In January, Trump’s average net approval rating stood at nearly +10 points among Republican pollsters and about 2 points better than among all pollsters. By April, though, the average difference between Republican pollsters and the overall aggregate was more than 5 points. In June and July, it’s been almost 7 points.\n\n“I have the best numbers I’ve ever had,” Trump said on July 23, as the scandal around his administration’s handling of the Jeffrey Epstein case hit fever pitch. “You know, it’s amazing I watch people on television: ‘Well, what about Donald Trump’s polling numbers?’ Yeah, they’re the best numbers I’ve ever had.”\n\nThese GOP-affiliated pollsters may be what Trump has in mind, but not even they show the supposed results he’s rambling on about. \n\nAny updates?\n\n It’s August 2025, the perfect time to fret about hypothetical polling for the 2028 presidential election. A new poll from Emerson College finds that former Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg is best positioned to take on Vice President JD Vance, if those two were to run and the election were held today. However, Buttigieg lags Vance by 1 point, but that’s within the margin of error. Meanwhile, New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and California Gov. Gavin Newsom trail Vance by 3 points each. However, in each hypothetical head-to-head, about 13% of voters are undecided. It’s anyone’s race!\n\n Zohran Mamdani, the Democratic nominee for mayor of New York City, won his primary after relentlessly messaging on the city’s cost-of-living woes—and new polling confirms that this messaging was integral to his victory. Among those who voted for Mamdani, 89% were swayed to do so because of his plans to lower costs, according to a poll Data for Progress conducted on behalf of the Institute for Middle East Understanding Policy Project. Other issues that swayed votes: Mamdani’s plan to tax the wealthy and take on corporations (86%), his support for Palestinian rights (62%), and his personality and energy (60%).\n\n Another week, another batch of Epstein polling. While Daily Kos covered the topline takeaways in a new YouGov/Economist poll earlier this week, the same poll also found that the vast majority of Americans (64%) oppose Trump potentially pardoning Epstein co-conspirator Ghislaine Maxwell, which Trump, being a bad man with a broken soul, is considering. Only 4% think he should pardon the convicted sex trafficker. All this comes as another new poll—this time from The Washington Post and SSRS—finds that only 16% of Americans approve of how Trump is handling the Epstein files issue. In fact, only 43% of self-described MAGA Republicans support him on the matter.\n\nNewly 79 years old, Trump is expected to exit the White House in January 2029 as the oldest president in the nation’s history, at age 82 and seven months. And if most Americans got their way, he’d be the oldest president the nation will ever have too.\n\nA newly released survey from YouGov, conducted in March, finds that 53% of Americans would limit people 80 years of age and older from being president, while only 25% say there should be no age limit, the current practice.\n\nRepublicans lead the way in thinking there should be no limit too, with a plurality of 36% thinking as much. Meanwhile, only 12% of Democrats and 27% of independents agree.\n\nOf the four activities YouGov polled—being president, driving a car, voting in federal elections, and gambling legally—the presidency was the one that voters most wanted to restrict to younger age groups.\n\nHowever, the poll also finds that 1 in 10 Democrats and 1 in 5 Republicans and independents think there should be no minimum age requirement on getting married, so Americans’ views on age limits can be questionable, to say the least.","summary":"Survey Says is a weekly series rounding up the most important polling trends or data points you need to know about, plus a vibe check on a trend that’s driving politics.\n\n\n\n\nA man-made famine in Gaza\n\nOn Tuesday, a United Nations-affiliated organization released a damning report about the “worst-case scenario for famine” occurring in the Gaza Strip. Over 20,000 children have been treated for severe malnutrition, and at least 16 child deaths have been tied to starvation.

Officials are wondering what they intend to do with it","text":"The Department of Justice is on a mission to collect election information, including sensitive voter information, from states as part of President Donald Trump’s executive order cracking down on voting accessibility – but it’s left state officials concerned.\n\nOver the last three months, the DoJ’s Voting Section has reached out to at least 15 states seeking their voter roll, information about individuals who may have violated federal voting laws, and questions about the state’s process for identifying and removing ineligible voters, the Associated Press reported. \n\nTraditionally, the Voting Section’s main focus is to protect citizens’ right to vote, but under Trump’s direction, it’s cracking down on voter fraud – a rare occurrence that Trump has mischaracterized as a major problem in the United States. \n\nBut some state officials have flagged concerns with the swath of information being requested, saying voter rolls contain private information about individuals and cannot be shared without congressional notification.\n\nUtah’s Lieutenant Governor Deidre Henderson, the state’s top election official, said she refused to provide expansive information on the state’s 2.1 million voters to the DoJ. \n\n“We’ve offered the public voter list. If they want protected data, there’s a process for government entities to request it for lawful purposes,” Henderson told The Salt Lake Tribune.\n\n“We’ll address that if it comes,” she continued, “but so far we haven’t identified any federal or state statute that would justify handing over to the federal government the personal identifying information of 2.1 million Utah voters,” Henderson added. \n\nOfficials in at least four California counties told the Associated Press that DoJ officials requested information about the number of people removed from rolls for being noncitizens, including their ID numbers, dates of birth, and voting records. \n\nTrump has sought to conduct the largest deportation of undocumented immigrants, in part by targeting individuals using government information.\n\nIn Colorado, DoJ officials demanded the state hand over “all records” pertaining to the 2024 election – a massive trove of documents that includes ballots and voting equipment information, as well as records retained from the 2020 election.\n\nLast year, the Colorado state Supreme Court tried to bar Trump from appearing on the presidential ballot, claiming he was ineligible because he violated the Fourteenth Amendment by inciting the January 6 attack on the Capitol. \n\nThe U.S. Supreme Court ultimately ruled in favor of Trump, declaring that states did not have the authority to determine a federal candidate’s eligibility. \n\nIn Maine, Secretary of State Shenna Bellows said she was denying the DoJ’s request for the state’s voter registration list, the names of officials who maintain the list, and the number of ineligible voters due to noncitizenship status. \n\nOfficials had sent multiple requests for information, one of which insinuated that Maine had an unusually high number of registered voters, the Maine Morning Star reported.\n\n“The nature of these questions suggest that the DOJ is more interested in keeping people that they don’t like from voting than promoting voter registration and participation,” Bellows told Maine Morning Star.\n\nAlready, DoJ officials had spoken to Bellows about a potential “information-sharing agreement” to provide the department with information on registered voters who are ineligible to vote.\n\nSimilar requests were made to Arizona, Connecticut, Michigan, Nevada, New Mexico, Rhode Island, and Wisconsin. \n\n“Why on Earth does the Department of Justice need the voter information from all 50 states?” Bellows asked. “If Congress thought it was appropriate that there be a national voter file, Congress could have authorized the Department of Justice to do that, but they have not.” \n\nThe DoJ’s motivation in collecting such information appears to be to assist its efforts to identify and prosecute those who violate federal election laws. \n\nTrump has directed the attorney general and DoJ to collect election information from states to add extra safeguards to elections. \n\nDespite no evidence of mass voter fraud or noncitizen voting in the last several elections, Trump has continually claimed the 2020 election was rigged with mass voter fraud and that undocumented migrants voted in the 2024 election.","summary":"Officials in several states have expressed concern over the DoJ requesting information on voters and elections","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/trump-doj-election-information-b2801259.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/08/03/22/41/GettyImages-2178247490.jpg?width=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/YUImveGc-4VHSaSK0.mp4","publish_date":"2025-08-03 22:53:25","author":"Ariana Baio","authors":["Ariana Baio"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.325},{"id":347864800,"title":"Texas Democrats flee state to block Trump-backed redistricting vote in dramatic legislative move","text":"Dozens of Texas Democrats are fleeing the state to block a redistricting vote that could benefit Republicans, marking a dramatic effort to derail an upcoming legislative process.

Defence, security and maritime cooperation are among the key pillars of the relationship and will top the agenda of Marcos' bilateral engagement with Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Tuesday, along with trade ties.Ahead of the president's visit, the chief of Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP), Romeo Brawner, said the Philippines is looking to purchase more weapon systems from India, citing the quality and affordability of Indian defence equipment. Talking about the ongoing delivery of BrahMos cruise missiles to Manila, Brawner also said two sets of the India-Russia jointly developed missile systems will arrive in the Philippines in the next few years. The Philippines' maritime dispute in the South China Sea (SCS), or what Manila calls the West Philippine Sea, has seen it scaling up defence cooperation with countries like India and Japan to blunt Chinese aggression and ensure peace and stability in the contested waters.India will also join the Philippines this week for a joint patrol in the South China Sea. In the middle of its own border tensions with China, India in 2023 joined Manila in explicitly asking China to abide by a 2016 arbitral tribunal award that refuted Beijing's expansive claims over SCS waters. Modi and Marcos are also expected to discuss India's offer for concessional Line of Credit to meet Philippines' defence requirements, acquisition of naval assets, and expansion of training and joint exercises on maritime security. According to Manila, six agreements in a range of areas like science and technology, law and culture are expected to be signed.The Modi-Marcos meeting, however, takes place in the middle of efforts by both India and China to rebuild their relationship and it will be interesting to see how much play the South China Sea issue can get in the meeting. During Marcos' recent visit to the US, President Donald Trump reportedly told him he wouldn't mind if Manila got along with China.The two countries will also discuss efforts to enhance trade ties, as they both look to conclude a bilateral trade deal with the US to avoid getting caught in the cross hairs of Trump's trade war. While the US president has announced 25% tariffs on imports from India, he has slapped Manila with a 19% levy.Bilateral trade crossed $3 billion for the first time in 2022-2023 and the two sides have agreed to commence negotiations for a bilateral Preferential Trade Agreement.According to the ministry of external affairs (MEA), development cooperation is another crucial aspect of bilateral relationship. \"India is implementing six Quick Impact Projects (QIPs) in the areas of agriculture, disaster risk reduction & management, health-care and livelihood support, in the Philippines, under an MoU on Indian Grant Assistance for the implementation of QIPs, signed on Feb 7, 2023,\" said an official.","summary":"","url":"https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/philippines-eyes-buying-more-defence-equipment-from-india/articleshow/123082592.cms","image":"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/resizemode-4,width-1280,height-720,msid-123082648/123082648.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-08-03 22:41:21","author":"TNN","authors":["TNN"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"IN","sentiment":0.272},{"id":347863510,"title":"Trump Aide Says India’s Purchase of Russian Oil Is Financing War With Ukraine","text":"White House deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller on Aug. 3 accused India of financing Russia’s war in Ukraine through its continued purchasing of oil from Moscow, weeks after President Donald Trump threatened secondary tariffs on nations that buy Russian oil.\n\nIn an interview with Fox News’ “Sunday Morning Futures,” Miller said the United States is now “in a position of economic strength to deal with Russia and to deal with this war.”","summary":"'People will be shocked to learn that India is basically tied with China in purchasing Russian oil,' the White House official said.","url":"https://www.theepochtimes.com/us/trump-aide-says-indias-purchase-of-russian-oil-is-financing-war-with-ukraine-5896012","image":"https://img.theepochtimes.com/assets/uploads/2025/04/28/id5849112-04282025-DSC07611-Stephen-Miller-300x180.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-08-03 22:40:14","author":"Jacob Burg","authors":["Jacob Burg"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.259},{"id":347872054,"title":"Sean Strickland proposes a ‘revolution’","text":"It is being reported by MMA Weekly, that the UFC’s Sean Strickland is reportedly calling for an ‘Armed Revolution.\n\nThe former middleweight champion isn’t afraid of a little controversy.

What do they think they are getting from this court?\"\n\n\"I think it is in many respects a vote of no-confidence in this court — that this court is not going to be a place that's just going to apply the law, at least all seven of us,\" he added.\n\n\"It's both sides that are pouring money into these races,\" Hagedorn said. \"But people increasingly see this court, and courts around the country, as an extension of the political branches. It is incumbent upon us to prove them wrong, to disabuse them of that notion.\"\n\nHagedorn says clashes between state Supreme Court justices are evidence of 'culture issue'\n\nAsked to address critics who believe the Supreme Court has become too politically divided, Hagedorn responded that such divisions predate the terms of the court's sitting justices.\n\n\"The court has been in some state of dysfunction for 30 years,\" Hagedorn said, later adding: \"It's a culture issue.\"\n\nIn past courts, previous Wisconsin justices have accused each other of shouting, slamming doors and being physically threatening. One high-profile interaction even led to a police investigation.\n\nHagedorn said he believes the court has a responsibility to earn the public's trust in its professionalism. He said he has made an \"intentional effort\" to attend events in support of his colleagues, including members of the court's liberal bloc.\n\nHe recently attended Crawford's inauguration, which conservative Justice Rebecca Bradley, who campaigned for Crawford's opponent, skipped.\n\nHagedorn 'inclined to' run for re-election\n\nAsked about his future plans, Hagedorn suggested that he is interested in seeking another term.\n\n\"I'm proud of my record and proud of where I stand at the moment,\" Hagedorn said. \"I'm inclined to (seek another term), but we've got three important races between now and then.\"\n\nHis term ends in July 2029.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Milwaukee Journal Sentinel: Wisconsin justice Brian Hagedorn decries spending in judicial races","url":"https://www.yahoo.com/news/articles/conservative-wisconsin-supreme-court-justice-223038982.html","image":"https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/TAcXuGrP2eoAfW.d3M5.VA--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTI0MDA7aD0zNjAwO2NmPXdlYnA-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/milwaukee-journal-sentinel/dcdf0de89bbcb7d2012cf55413b1c625","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-08-03 22:30:38","author":"Ariela Lopez, Milwaukee Journal Sentinel","authors":["Ariela Lopez, Milwaukee Journal Sentinel"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.023},{"id":347865814,"title":"Donald Trump-supporting soccer fan kicked out of MLS stadium for wearing a MAGA cap","text":"Shocking footage has emerged showing a soccer fan getting kicked out of a St. Louis City game for wearing a 'Make America Great Again' cap in the stands.\n\nThe clip, first shared by reporter Greg Keller on X, shows a man named Michael Weitzel filming himself as police escort him out of the team's stadium because of his clothing.\n\n'I am being evicted from the premises because of Donald Trump - because we can't wear Donald Trump hats in public,' Weizel says. 'Now I am being evicted from the premises. Trump is not welcome at St. Louis City SC club. Trump is not welcome here.\n\n'I'm being asked to leave by the police. I am being threatened with arrest. They are asking me to leave.' \n\nA police officer escorting Weitzel out of the stadium can be heard explaining that he is a Trump supporter too but has to carry out the club's rules banning political statements at the stadium. Booing and jeering can also be heard in the background.\n\n'He gets it, he's just following the rules,' Weitzel says of the officer dealing with him. 'It's not his fault. This is the stadium's rules here.'\n\nIt is unclear precisely when the incident happened. Keller posted the video on August 2, saying that it occurred 'last night' but the most recent St. Louis City game was held on July 30 - a friendly game against Premier League team Aston Villa.\n\nMajor League Soccer fan code of conduct rules state on their website that supporters are not allowed to make political gestures through their clothing at games. \n\nListed in the prohibited section of the MLS website, the rule says: 'Displaying signs, symbols or images for commercial purposes or for electioneering, campaigning or advocating for or against any candidate, political party, legislative issue, or government action.'\n\nSt. Louis City SC, when contacted for comment, directed Daily Mail to those guidelines and offered no further statement. \n\nThe fan appears to be told by security that his ban only covers the game in question and that he would be allowed back in the future. \n\nKeller, meanwhile, later said that the the video is being reviewed by the Civil Rights Division of the U.S. Department of Justice, who Daily Mail has contacted for comment. MLS has also been offered the chance to speak about the video.\n\nThe same issue has arisen in other sports across the United States. Last October, San Francisco 49ers fans said they were stopped from bringing Trump merchandise into Levi's Stadium before an NFL game.\n\nThe fans in question shared video to TikTok showing stadium security telling them to throw their hat away or to leave the stadium.\n\nThe woman who uploaded the footage said it caused a 45-minute dispute before security eventually relented and let the family in - although they missed the beginning of the game. \n\nIronically, after the 49ers beat the Dallas Cowboys on October 27, San Francisco guard Nick Bosa gatecrashed a post-game interview wearing a white MAGA cap. He was fined $11,255 by the NFL.\n\nAccording to league rules, players are prohibited from displaying a personal message or non-sponsored branding 'at any point throughout a game day when visible at the stadium and TV audience, including postgame interviews in the locker room or on the field.' \n\nBosa was unapologetic, telling reporters: 'I haven't got one (a fine) yet, but if it comes, it comes. It was well worth it.'\n\nAfter Trump won last November's election, Bosa largely stayed silent aside from saying: 'Clearly, the nation spoke. And we got what we got what we want.","summary":"'I'm being asked to leave by the police. I am being threatened with arrest.

After finishing her freshman year at Purdue University, where she is studying to become a pharmacist, Go was back home in Scarsdale, Westchester County, with her mother for the summer.However, conflicting accounts exist regarding her immigration status. Department of Homeland Security Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said Go \"overstayed her visa that expired more than two years ago\" and was placed in expedited removal proceedings following her July 31 arrest.Go's lawyer said the 20-year-old was ordered to appear in court on Thursday for a procedural hearing on her visa renewal application, ABC7 NY reported. However, after being given a date in October to return from the judge, she was detained by ICE agents once she left the building.A second woman, a 59-year-old named Ketty, a Peruvian asylum seeker, was also detained by federal agents as she left her routine asylum hearing the same day Go was.Ketty had worked at her family's successful bakery in Peru until \"organized thugs\" threatened them with violence and death if they didn't pay a large sum of money, forcing them to flee the country, according to the New York Daily News. After crossing the border alone and arriving in New York three years ago, Ketty applied for asylum and followed all required procedures.The two women are currently being held at 26 Federal Plaza, a facility that lacks basic amenities such as showers, beds, or hot food. Go has complained to her mother that agents \"barely let her have her glasses\" and hasn't been given a change of clothes, the newspaper reported.Both detentions sparked weekend protests, with approximately 75 faith leaders and advocates gathering outside 26 Federal Plaza on Saturday morning to demand their release.What People Are SayingDHS Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said in a statement: \"President Trump and Secretary [Kristi] Noem are committed to restoring integrity to the visa program and ensuring it is not abused to allow aliens a permanent one-way ticket to remain in the U.S.\"She added: \"Those who are in our country illegally have a choice—they can leave the country voluntarily or be arrested and deported. The United States taxpayer is generously offering free flights and a $1,000 to illegal aliens who self-deport using the CBP Home app. If they leave now, they preserve the potential opportunity to come back the legal, right way. The choice is theirs.\"Episcopal Diocese of New York Reverend Matthew Heyd told ABC7 NY: \"Her mother gets regular calls from Yeonsoo and she's staying at 26 Federal Plaza, which, as we know, is not actually a facility that has showers or beds or hot food. And so the detentions here are not only illegal, but they're immoral.\"New York Immigration Coalition President Murad Awawdeh told the New York Daily News: \"They are showing up, following the rules of the letter of the law. And what is this telling people? That if you go to your court hearing, you may not make it out, but if you miss it, you definitely will be deported? This is not a system of justice. This is a system of injustice.\"What Happens Next?Immigration advocates recommend that anyone with upcoming immigration court hearings contact the New York State Office of New Americans hotline, create a family preparedness plan, and work with lawyers to arrange virtual hearings when possible.Community members continue to rally for both women's release, while their cases proceed through the immigration system.","summary":"Yeonsoo Go, a South Korean native, immigrated from Seoul with her mother on a religious visa roughly four years ago and was switching to a student visa.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/priests-daughter-detained-ice-routine-visa-hearing-new-york-2108286","image":"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2695739/ice-agents.jpg?w=1600&h=900&q=88&f=083ccdffa8f18ce87266e5104e8c5fd3","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-08-03 22:20:27","author":"Adeola Adeosun","authors":["Adeola Adeosun"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.037},{"id":347870974,"title":"EU surrendered to Trump’s demands out of ‘fear’ – Sunday Times","text":"European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen agreed to a lopsided US trade deal without resistance out of fear that Washington might reduce military support for Ukraine or even withdraw American forces from Europe, the Sunday Times reported this weekend.\n\nThe paper described von der Leyen’s recent visit to President Donald Trump’s golf course in Scotland – where she accepted a 15% tariff on most EU exports – as a “surrender.” \n\nAccording to the report, officials inside the Commission initially prepared a strong countermeasure package in response to Trump’s proposed 20% tariffs announced in April. But when Trump threatened to raise the tariffs to 30%, von der Leyen pulled back.\n\nBehind her reversal was “the fear that Trump might use a dispute as a pretext to cut US military support for Ukraine or otherwise damage European security,” the Sunday Times wrote. Brussels was reportedly particularly concerned about the outcome of a pending American “posture review” that may result in the withdrawal of some of the roughly 80,000 US troops stationed across Europe.\n\nThe trade agreement finalized last week includes not only the 15% tariff on EU goods, but also commitments by Brussels to invest $600 billion in the US economy and purchase $750 billion worth of American energy over the next three years. In contrast, the UK – negotiating independently – secured a lower 10% tariff on its exports.\n\nAmid mounting internal backlash in Brussels, French President Emmanuel Macron reportedly criticized the outcome, saying the EU is “not feared enough.” Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban remarked that Trump “ate her for breakfast,” and accused von der Leyen of exceeding her authority by allegedly pledging to purchase large quantities of US arms.\n\nVon der Leyen has also faced growing political resistance at home, as she pushes to redirect a significant portion of the EU’s next €1.8 trillion seven-year budget from agriculture and regional development toward militarization. She narrowly survived a vote of confidence in the European Parliament last month amid criticism of her leadership style and controversies over her Covid-19 vaccine procurement deals. Some MEPs now view her current term as her “last chance,” according to lawmakers quoted by the Times.","summary":"The European Commission president was allegedly worried the US could stop military aid to Ukraine or even pull out troops from Europe \nRead Full Article at RT.com","url":"https://www.rt.com/news/622441-eu-trump-trade-fear/","image":"https://mf.b37mrtl.ru/files/2025.08/article/688fde8185f54050764e839b.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-08-03 22:20:17","author":null,"language":"en","source_country":"ru","sentiment":0.418},{"id":347876952,"title":"Stephen Colbert Lands New Late Night Role on CBS Crime Comedy ‘Elsbeth’","text":"Skip to main content\n\nAugust 3, 2025 3:17pm\n\nShare on Facebook\n\nShare to Flipboard\n\nSend an Email\n\nShow additional share options\n\nShare on LinkedIn\n\nShare on Pinterest\n\nShare on Reddit\n\nShare on Tumblr\n\nShare on Whats App\n\nPrint the Article\n\nPost a Comment\n\nStephen Colbert on 'The Late Show.'\n\nScott Kowalchyk\n\nShare on Facebook\n\nShare to Flipboard\n\nSend an Email\n\nShow additional share options\n\nShare on LinkedIn\n\nShare on Pinterest\n\nShare on Reddit\n\nShare on Tumblr\n\nShare on Whats App\n\nPrint the Article\n\nPost a Comment\n\nLate night television can’t get rid of Stephen Colbert that easily.\n\nAfter it was revealed that CBS canceled the comedian’s long-running late night talk show, The Late Show With Stephen Colbert, The Hollywood Reporter learned on Sunday that Colbert has landed another hosting gig on a separate CBS show.\n\nColbert is set to make a guest appearance on an upcoming season three episode of the crime comedy, Elsbeth, which returns Oct. 12. Vulture reported that Colbert will play the host of a fictional late night talk show called Way Late with Scotty Bristol.\n\nRelated Stories\n\nKamala Harris Opens Up About Next Political Chapter: \"I Don't Want to Go Back in the System. I Think It's Broken\"\n\nStephen Colbert Mocks \"Overreaction\" to Sydney Sweeney American Eagle Ad\n\nElsbeth, starring Carrie Preston, Wendell Pierce and Carra Patterson, is a murder-of-the-week show. It follows astute but unconventional attorney Elsbeth Tascioni (Preston), who utilizes her singular point of view to make unique observations and corner brilliant criminals alongside the NYPD.\n\nColbert’s episode was filmed this week; however, his guest appearance has been months in the making. In February, during Pierce’s appearance on The Late Show, Colbert asked the actor if he could help him land a role on Elsbeth, as he’s been wanting “to be a corpse on one of these shows.” Pierce happily responded, “I can make that happen. I know a guy who knows a guy. We can get you on.”\n\nColbert joins the list of other stars who have made appearances on the crime comedy, including Nathan Lane, Keegan-Michael Key, Laura Benanti, Matthew Broderick and Retta, among others.\n\nLast month, CBS cited a “financial decision” amid a declining linear TV landscape for the cancellation of The Late Show, which is set to conclude at the end of the 2025-26 season. However, the show’s cancellation announcement came after Colbert criticized Paramount Global, the parent company of CBS, for agreeing to pay $16 million to settle a lawsuit from President Donald Trump, who sued over former Vice President Kamala Harris’ 60 Minutes interview. The network said in a statement that it wasn’t a factor in the decision to end the show.\n\nSources previously told THR that Paramount believed the lawsuit posed a threat to the Paramount-Skydance merger, which was awaiting approval by the FCC under the Trump administration. After more than a year, the deal was approved by the federal agency at the end of July.\n\nVulture was first to report the news of Colbert’s guest role on Elsbeth.\n\nCBS declined to comment.\n\nTHR Newsletters\n\nSign up for THR news straight to your inbox every day\n\nJeffrey Epstein\n\nTrump Slams Charlamagne tha God for Fox News Interview Claiming a “Political Coup” in the Republican Party Is “Going on Right Now”\n\nTori Spelling\n\nLoni Anderson, ‘WKRP in Cincinnati’ Star, Dies at 79\n\nSarah Michelle Gellar\n\nSarah Michelle Gellar Teases Training for ‘Buffy the Vampire Slayer’ Reboot\n\n‘Summer I Turned Pretty’ Star Jackie Chung Unpacks Belly and Laurel’s Rift, Teases What’s Ahead in Season 3\n\nNetflix’s New Releases Coming in August 2025\n\nTaylor Swift\n\nMarc Maron Jokes He’s “Not Afraid to Die Anymore” as Long as This Taylor Swift Song Is Playing\n\nThe Hollywood Reporter is a part of Penske Media Corporation. © 2025 The Hollywood Reporter, LLC.

Refusing to attend legislative session is a civil violation, however, so Democrats legally could not be jailed and it’s unclear who has the power to carry out the warrants.\n\nDemocrats have cast the decision to leave the state as a last-ditch effort to stop Republicans who hold full control of the Texas government from pushing through a rare mid-decade redrawing of the congressional map at the direction of President Donald Trump.\n\n“This is not a decision we make lightly, but it is one we make with absolute moral clarity,” said Gene Wu, chair of the House Democratic Caucus, in a statement.\n\nTo conduct official business, at least 100 members of the 150-member Texas House must be present. Democrats hold 62 of the seats in the majority-Republican chamber. At least 51 Democratic members are leaving the state, said Josh Rush Nisenson, spokesperson for the House Democratic Caucus.\n\n“Apathy is complicity, and we will not be complicit in the silencing of hard-working communities who have spent decades fighting for the power that Trump wants to steal,” he said.\n\nThe move marks the second time in four years that Texas Democrats have fled the state to block a vote. In 2021, a 38-day standoff took place when Democrats left for Washington in opposition to new voting restrictions.\n\nRepublican Gov. Greg Abbott called a special session of the Legislature that started last month to take up the redistricting effort, as well as to respond to flooding in Texas Hill Country that killed at least 135 people in July. Trump has urged Texas Republicans to redraw the map to help the party net a handful of seats in the midterms next year.\n\nTexas Republicans last week unveiled their planned new U.S. House map that would create five new Republican-leaning seats. Republicans currently hold 25 of the state’s 38 seats.\n\nBy leaving the state, Democrats are looking to block Republicans from the needed quorum to hold votes on the map set for Monday. The Texas House has rules to fine lawmakers $500 each day they break a quorum. GOP Attorney General Ken Paxton has said previously that if Democrats break quorum, “they should be found and arrested no matter where they go.”\n\n“My office stands ready to assist local, state, and federal authorities in hunting down and compelling the attendance of anyone who abandons their office and their constituents for cheap political theater,” Paxton said on the social media platform X on July 15.\n\nA large chunk of the Texas Democrats are heading to Illinois, where Democratic Gov. JB Pritzker had been in quiet talks with them for weeks about offering support if they chose to leave the state to break quorum. Pritzker, a potential 2028 presidential contender, has been one of Trump’s most outspoken critics during his second term.\n\nLast week, Pritzker hosted several Texas Democrats in Illinois to publicly oppose the redistricting effort. California Gov. Gavin Newsom held a similar event in his own state.\n\nPritzker also met privately with Texas Democratic Chair Kendall Scudder in June to begin planning for the possibility that lawmakers would depart for Illinois if they did decide to break quorum to block the map, according to a source with direct knowledge who requested anonymity to discuss private conversations.\n\nNow, with Texas Democrats holed up in Illinois and blocking the Trump-backed congressional map, the stage may be set for a high-profile showdown between Pritzker and the president.\n\nTrump is looking to avoid a repeat of his first term, when Democrats flipped the House just two years into his presidency, and hopes the new Texas map will aid that effort. Trump officials have also looked at redrawing lines in other states, such as Missouri, according to a person familiar with conversations but unauthorized to speak publicly about them.","summary":"The dramatic move Sunday could expose Democrats to fines and other penalties — with the state's attorney general having previously threatened to arrest them if they took such an action. \n\n\nThe post Texas Democrats leave the state to block vote on redrawn House map backed by Trump appeared first on Boston.com.","url":"https://www.boston.com/news/politics/2025/08/03/texas-democrats-leave-the-state-to-block-vote-on-redrawn-house-map-backed-by-trump/","image":"https://bdc2020.o0bc.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Texas_Legislature_Redistricting_21638-688fcf19aed8e-768x432.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-08-03 22:15:56","author":"Associated Press","authors":["Associated Press"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.246},{"id":347867120,"title":"Texas Democrats leave state in effort to halt GOP redistricting plan","text":"On Sunday, they did just that, with more than 51 Democratic lawmakers reportedly headed to the Windy City, where they will hold a news conference later tonight with Gov.

The roughly 30 Democrats are expected to stay for the week in a plan brokered with Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker, who met with the Texas caucus late last month and has directed his staff to provide logistical support for their stay. “We’re leaving Texas to fight for Texans,” Texas House Democratic Caucus Chair Gene Wu said in a statement. “We will not allow disaster relief to be held hostage to a Trump gerrymander. We’re not walking out on our responsibilities; we’re walking out on a rigged system that refuses to listen to the people we represent. As of today, this corrupt special session is over.” Last week, Texas Republicans released a proposed congressional map that would give the GOP a path to pick up five seats in next year’s midterm elections. It followed President Donald Trump’s public pressure for a new map in the state as he works to retain a majority in Congress in what historically is a difficult year for the party holding the White House. The proposed map would shift district lines in ways that would target current Democratic members of Congress in and around Austin, Dallas and Houston, as well as two already endangered Democrats representing South Texas districts that Trump carried last year. Food trickles into Gaza, but not enough to stop a famine, aid groups say Humanitarian organizations say the amount of aid that has entered Gaza since Israel said it would pause military action in some areas is insufficient to stop a growing number of Palestinians dying from hunger. Israel has allowed only a limited amount of aid to enter the enclave since it lifted a total blockade this year. Most of the aid has been distributed by the Israel-backed group known as the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation, and other humanitarian organizations have said Israeli restrictions have hampered their efforts to distribute aid. “This is not an adequate response,” Jeanette Bailey, the International Rescue Committee’s global practice lead and director of research for nutrition, said in a phone interview. A gradual entry of aid “here or there,” she said, “is not going to be adequate to prevent us from entering into a full-blown famine where the numbers of deaths go way, way up.” Hamas sparked outcry in Israel over the weekend when it released video appearing to show a visibly gaunt Israeli hostage alongside images of emaciated Palestinian babies. Meet the Press White House economic adviser Kevin Hassett defended President Donald Trump’s decision to fire Bureau of Labor Statistics Commissioner Erika McEntarfer, as well as Trump’s claim that weaker-than-expected jobs reports were “rigged,” but he failed to produce any evidence to support the claim. Hassett said on NBC News’ “Meet the Press” that installing Trump’s “own people” will help achieve more “transparent and reliable” jobs reports in the future. “What we need is a fresh set of eyes over the BLS,” Hassett, the director of the National Economic Council, told moderator Kristen Welker. Several Republicans, including Sen. Rand Paul, of Kentucky, questioned the firing. “We have to look somewhere for objective statistics. When the people providing the statistics are fired, it makes it much harder to make judgments that, you know, the statistics won’t be politicized,” Paul told NBC News on Friday. Meanwhile, Sen. Alex Padilla, D-Calif., accused Trump of trying to “weaponize” labor statistics for his own agenda. Padilla said the Senate would evaluate the “independence” of a new BLS commissioner when it comes time to confirm a new one. “When [Trump’s] trying to weaponize the Bureau of Labor Statistics, that tells you a lot about their insecurity about the economy and the state of economic affairs,” Padilla told Welker.

They became indoctrination factories... There's absolutely no diversity of thought,\" Maher said in response to a viewer question about Trump’s efforts to reform American universities. Trump has been waging war against the country’s top colleges over antisemitism, DEI and lack of diverse thought. Trump has withheld billions of dollars in federal research funds from Columbia, Harvard, Yale and other top schools in efforts to get them to reform their campuses. Antisemitic incidents have sharply spiked at colleges across the country since Hamas' Oct. 7 attack. Additionally, studies show that intellectual diversity is in decline at universities, with liberals outnumbering conservatives. HARVARD PROFESSOR URGES UNIVERSITY TO EMBRACE IDEOLOGICAL BALANCE AMID CLASH WITH TRUMP ADMIN Trump restored research funds to Columbia after the Ivy League school settled with the administration, paying over $221 million to resolve various federal civil rights investigations against it. The deal includes $21 million to resolve antisemitism complaints. The Trump administration hailed the deal as the largest antisemitism settlement in history. Columbia also committed to several reforms to combat antisemitism and discrimination on its campus. Maher conceded that he didn’t think withholding scientific research funds wasn’t the right course of action, but countered that universities had become profoundly anti-American. He also said that professors, cloistered in their \"ivory towers,\" had become disconnected from basic moral decency. \"Why do you think they erupted so many of them in cheers for what happened On October 7th?

He is president of the UN Sustainable Development Solutions Network. He was a special adviser to the UN Secretary General and has advised multiple governments on economic transition, debt crisis solutions and poverty alleviation policies. Part 1 of the Sachs interview, published in July last year, can be found here. This interview first appeared in SCMP Plus. For other interviews in the Open Questions series, click here.\nThe tariff truce between China and the United States is set to end in August. What do you forecast will happen after that? And what will happen to trade relations between China and the US for the rest of US President Donald Trump’s second term?\nThe United States learned that it can’t impose its will on China. The rare earths threat by itself was enough to cause the US to reconsider. So, almost immediately after putting on the high tariffs, the US backed down. And both sides know that each has some chokeholds on the other. For that reason, we might expect the two sides to maintain certain limits on the trade frictions in the years ahead. There will be, therefore, some kind of agreement, but it won’t stick in the details, and frictions will continue to wax and wane, with neither side definitively imposing its will on the other. The basic reason is that both sides have a mutual gain from continued trade. I’m hopeful that a measure of rationality will therefore prevail.\nThe biggest challenge, of course, is the behaviour of the US. The US started this trade war. This is not two sides fighting each other, but rather the US fighting China. We should remember that. The US needs to show some prudence at this point. I do suspect that there is a chastened view among many senior US officials. Trump himself is unpredictable. He has a very short attention span. Agreements with Trump don’t stick. So, I don’t foresee a quiet period, but I do foresee some limits to the competition because each side can do damage to the other and both sides have a strong reason to achieve some cooperation.\n\nLet me add one more point. From a long-term point of view, China certainly should not regard the US as a growth market for its exports. The US is going to restrict China’s exports to the US one way or another. The relationship will not be harmonious. The US will not be friendly to China, or trustworthy. China should just take care that it’s expanding its exports to other markets, and should not be overly focused on trying to break through to the US market, or even to Europe for that matter. The rapid growth of China’s exports will be with Africa, Southeast Asia, South Asia, west Asia, Central Asia, Latin America – not with the US and western Europe.\nWhat is your forecast for the US midterm elections, and will it be a tough battle for Trump? Can you comment on how divided the US is compared to before the election of Trump last year?\nI think that the Democrats will likely regain control of one or both houses of Congress, because in midterm elections that is generally the pattern.\nEven without getting deeply specific about the current context, the prevailing party that holds the White House almost always loses ground in the midterms, and the Republican majority in both houses of Congress is very small. Having said this, we should also understand that Trump is ruling mainly by executive decree, not by legislation. Even if the Democrats regain one or both houses of Congress, Trump will continue with his decrees.\nThe US currently does not have a functioning constitutional system in my view. It is one-person rule by declarations of emergencies by Trump. The orders generally start with the statement: “By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, it is hereby ordered”. This is a kind of soft dictatorship, not a constitutional system. The lower courts object, but the Supreme Court lets Trump have his way. The Congress is nearly moribund.\nEven if the Democrats regain some control of the House or the Senate, it won’t stop a lot of what Trump is doing. I should also add that while Americans are polarised, they generally dislike both political parties. Most Americans are unhappy about the direction of the country. They’re distrustful of the politicians. Our political institutions are not functioning properly and that’s why there’s a high level of distrust.\nI don’t think that China can, or should, base its policies on a return to normal trade with the US\nJeffrey Sachs\nAnother point that I think is important to understand is that the swings between the Democrats and the Republicans do not change US foreign policy. [Former president Barack] Obama started the anti-China policies in his term. Then came Trump’s tariffs in his first term. Biden kept those Trump tariffs and had a hostile policy towards China. Now Trump is picking up where Biden left off. The deep state drives foreign policy, not public opinion or presidents.\nIn sum, I don’t have much hope that some change in the midterm elections will change the direction of US politics very much. Even a change in the White House in four years is not likely to change US politics very much. Our problems are deep seated. Our institutional failings are deep. It’s going to take perhaps 20 years to work through this. This is not a Trump phenomenon by itself.\nWhat effect will the One Big Beautiful Bill have on the US economy?\nThe One Big Beautiful Bill weakens the US in two ways. First, it adds to the already large budget deficits by making additional tax cuts that mainly benefit rich Americans and the corporate class. These tax cuts raise the budget deficit substantially and are partially offset by cuts in healthcare benefits for the poorest Americans. The bill, therefore, is dramatically unfair and unwise in its impacts on the deficit and inequality.\nSecond, the legislation phases out some of the modest earlier US efforts towards low-carbon energy and modernisation of infrastructure. So, the legislation marks a US retreat from leadership on 21st-century technologies. Basically, the Trump administration is a gift to China, with Trump’s policies saying to China, “China should lead the way on climate safety, low-carbon energy, electric vehicles and all of the green and digital technologies that the world needs, while the US will ignore the future”.\nSo, none of this is a big, beautiful bill. It is a mess that reflects the failures of the American political system.\n\nWhat are the implications of the fallout between billionaire Elon Musk and Trump?\nTrump doesn’t have long-term relations with any individual other than his immediate family. Trump falls out with everybody. Remember Steve Bannon? He was once Trump’s closest adviser. That came to an end quickly. Almost all Trump advisers get fired at one point or another. Trump is not a person with long-term loyalties to anybody.\nThe individual feuds don’t mean very much. Breaking with Musk does not mean breaking with Silicon Valley. Silicon Valley put Trump back into the White House with enormous financial backing for Trump’s campaign. There are still tens of billions of dollars of government contracts going also to Elon Musk, Peter Thiel and other Big Tech operators.\nThe basic relationship between Silicon Valley and Washington remains intact because the Pentagon believes that it needs AI and can’t pursue AI on its own. While Trump has cut support for EVs, including Tesla, the Pentagon will continue to rely on Musk’s SpaceX for many years to come. And the same is true of the Pentagon’s reliance on Big Tech’s AI capacities generally.\nYou have mentioned in other interviews that Trump lacked a coherent strategy in foreign policy, including his handling of China. Why do you think this? And what do you see ahead for China-US relations?\nThe most fundamental trend in the world economy is the rapid rise of the non-Western economies, led by China and including Russia, India, Southeast Asia and, in future decades, Africa. The US is flailing about trying to maintain its dominance in a world in which the emerging economies are rising rapidly. The US will not be able to prevent the emergence of multipolarity, but it will try. Trump will try one thing or another, but without success or coherence. Multipolarity has already arrived.\nThe broad pattern of economic convergence – in which the emerging economies narrow or close the income gap with the high-income countries of the West – means that Western hegemony is over. This is leading to deep frustration, not only in the US political class but in Europe as well.\nChina vastly outproduces the United States in advanced industrial goods, such as EVs, solar power, wind power, advanced nuclear power, batteries, low-cost 5G and many other key technologies. China incorporates AI into advanced manufacturing processes more than the US.\nMany European leaders feel that if they stick with the US against China and Russia, then maybe the Western hegemony will continue. This is delusional in my view, but nonetheless creates a lot of noise, friction and risks of conflict. None of it is a coherent strategy, however.\nThe US has no strategy to stay ahead of China. In fact, the US can’t succeed in that. We hear a lot of US sabre-rattling against China, Russia and the Brics countries. This is all dangerous. I think the heated rhetoric by itself can become a self-fulfilling prophecy of war. There are a lot of ignorant people in the US political leadership, and I worry very much about their naivety and delusions.\nThis, in my view, is essentially the origin of the “trade war”. The US decided during 2010-2015 that China is now a threat to US primacy. The US has tried a lot of things to block China’s continued rise, including: a military build-up in East Asia; export restrictions on hi-tech goods, especially advanced chips; economic sanctions on key Chinese companies; investment restrictions by US companies, and ownership restrictions on Chinese companies in the US; high tariffs against China’s exports; and others. But none of this stops China’s rise. China’s development results from hard work, ingenuity, high rates of saving, high rates of investment, very effective long-term planning and a very skilled, very entrepreneurial generation of business leaders, especially young business leaders. Those fundamental strengths continue despite America’s anti-China policies.\nTrump’s policies are accelerating the move of top scientists to China. My overall view is that Trump is creating a lot of noise and some real dangers, but with no real strategy and no likelihood of success in holding back China’s rise. That’s a good thing. The rest of the world benefits from China’s economic success, including the US.\n\nIn your last Open Questions interview, you talked about “the deep state”, a complex vested interest group in industry, the military and other spheres. Does the deep state want military conflict with China? And do foreign governments – such as China and Russia – believe in the existence of a deep state, which many dismiss as a conspiracy theory?\nThe deep state means the permanent security system of the United States and its partners in Europe and in East Asia, including Japan, Korea and other places where the US has military bases and other security institutions. It includes the military, the CIA, the military contractors and the politicians who serve the military-industrial complex.\nDoes such a deep state exist? Yes. The US has around 750 overseas military bases and many of them are in East Asia. The US has many major military contractors with hundreds of billions of dollars of annual business with the US government. The US fights overt and covert wars pretty much non-stop, some of which are proxy wars (in which the US arms and funds Ukraine to fight Russia), and sometimes open conflicts with heavy US involvement, as in Iraq and Afghanistan. The US has the extensive global networks of the CIA and other intelligence and covert institutions. All of this constitutes the deep state. Presidents come and go but the underlying foreign policy is consistent and set largely out of view of the public, and without any reference to public opinion.\nWhen Obama replaced [US president George] Bush Jnr, and Trump replaced Obama, and Biden replaced Trump, and Trump replaced Biden, on the PR level there was alleged to be change, but in fact very little policy change occurred. For example, how much foreign policy change was there when Obama succeeded Bush Jnr? Very little. Obama launched many wars, just as Bush had done. Obama’s team actively participated in the coup in Ukraine in 2014 that set the path for the Ukraine war. Obama went to war against Libya. Obama gave the CIA the order to overthrow the Syrian government. All of this was a continuation of the policies of the Bush period.\nTrump continued most of the same policies. Trump continued to build up the Ukraine military. The Trump administration dismissed the Minsk 2 agreement that could have prevented the escalation of the Ukraine war. There was not any major change between Obama and Trump.\nWhen Biden came in, their claim again was that there would be a new foreign policy, but it didn’t happen. What did Biden do with China? He continued Trump’s tariffs. He continued Trump’s hardline rhetoric. Biden absurdly divided the world between the so-called democracies and autocracies, which was an incredibly naive approach, as I said from the beginning.\nBiden escalated the Ukraine war. He rejected all attempts at peace negotiations, including the Istanbul process that could have ended the Ukraine war in 2022. When it came to the Middle East, Biden was complicit in Israel’s ongoing genocide. So, Biden did very little different from Bush Jnr, Obama and Trump before him.\nNow, Trump has returned. What’s the real difference? Trump is different in style, in his unpredictability, nastiness, self-dealing and endless flip-flops. Yet, in terms of basic foreign policy, Trump is not very different from his predecessors.\n\nThis is the sense in which deep state means an ongoing consistency of the US security institutions that run American foreign policy. American foreign policy is not determined by public opinion, or Congress, or even the president in large part. Look instead to the CIA, the Pentagon and the other parts of the deep state.\nThe deep state also determines the politics of US vassal states. Many observers consider Japan to be a US-occupied country, with Japan’s foreign policy basically subservient to the US. One can say the same about many other countries. Where the US has military bases, the host countries tend to act like occupied countries, bending their own foreign policy to that of the US.\nThe US deep state is profoundly arrogant, thinking that it can have its way around the world. The US deep state thinks that it can dominate not only US allies, which is typically true, but also China, Russia, Iran, Brazil and others. When US arrogance becomes too strong, we face the danger of disaster. That’s what happened in Ukraine. The US thought that it could push Russia around to its will. It could not. The attempt to assert US power in Ukraine led to war.\nUS arrogance deeply worries me. Trump certainly is not a strategist. There’s no long-term plan. The US is playing poker, but not very well or wisely. It often bluffs. The whole approach can lead to war.\nChina is now drafting its economic policies for the next five years. You have advised many countries before. What is your advice to China in the face of this tension and the global tariff war?\nMy main advice to China is look to the non-Western world for the strongest partnerships in trade, investment and diplomacy, at least for a while. The US-led alliance (US, Canada, Britain, EU, Japan, Korea, Australia and New Zealand) is around 13 per cent of the world population. China is another 17 per cent. The remaining 70 per cent of the world – in Asia, Africa and Latin America – wants good and strong economic and diplomatic relations with China. That 70 per cent of the world population wants to modernise, and China provides the means for those countries to achieve rapid growth and modernisation. China is key to the global energy transition to zero-carbon energy, especially in the markets outside the US and Europe.\nThe emerging and developing economies of Asia, Africa and Latin America will be the markets for China’s rapid export growth in the years ahead. China will play a vital global role in these economies in building advanced green and digital economies, using Chinese cutting-edge technologies.\nThis will be a great win-win for the world because China will continue to grow rapidly while also empowering rapid growth throughout the emerging and developing nations. Sadly, in my view, the US will not play much of a role in that modernisation in the next generation. The US under Trump is withdrawing from green technologies, and from global responsibility.\nThe US cannot compete with China for the global renewable energy market. The US can’t compete with China for the global digital connectivity market. The US can’t compete with China in fast rail or low-carbon ocean shipping. In all these sectors, Trump is handing world trade and leadership over to China.\nRegarding the US markets, China should certainly attempt to make a suitable trade deal with the US but China should not fret too much either way. The US is already a small part of China’s exports – perhaps around 10-12 per cent. That share of China’s exports will most likely decline further.\nI hope that I’m wrong and that the US regains some sense and rejoins the global effort for green transformation and re-establishes normal trade with China. Yet, I don’t think that’s going to happen for many years, and I don’t think that China can, or should, base its policies on a return to normal trade with the US.\nMore specifically, I advocate expanding [China’s] Belt and Road Initiative. I advocate that China should deal with regional groups, including Asean, the African Union, the Arab League and the Community of Latin America and Caribbean States (CELAC). China’s relations with these regional groups can be very strategic, as the regional groups can, and should, spur the interconnectivity of infrastructure among all the members of the group. For China, it will be easier to interact with regional plans rather than one country at a time.\nIn fact, no individual state in Asean, or the Middle East, or Latin America can modernise on its own without strong links with its neighbours through trade, finance and infrastructure. With Asean, for example, there really is the need for an Asean-wide energy system, not separate energy systems for Laos, Cambodia, Vietnam, Thailand, Malaysia, Indonesia etc. These countries need an interconnected power grid, and China will play a key role in achieving an Asean-wide grid. Therefore, China-Asean diplomacy is strongly win-win.\nI also believe that Hong Kong will have a huge and indeed unique leadership role in the global transformation. Hong Kong is vital for China’s growing links with Asean, the African Union, and beyond. The Greater Bay Area (GBA) combines Hong Kong’s world-class leadership in international finance, higher education and global management, with Shenzhen’s leadership in cutting-edge technologies, and the advanced manufacturing of Dongguan, Guangzhou and other GBA cities.\nPut these strengths together, and the GBA becomes the beating heart of the global green transformation, in zero-carbon energy, robotics, AI-based manufacturing, digital connectivity and much more. All of this will help to fuel China’s – and Hong Kong’s – rapid growth for the next generation.\n\nThis year marks the 80th anniversary of the end of World War II. How is the post-war world order changing and what will the new world order look like?\nThere are three scenarios.\nOne is that we create a truly multilateral world. For that, we need a United Nations 2.0. We need an upgraded international system in which all the major powers agree to invest in the international rule of law and peaceful resolution of conflicts. This will require an upgrade of the UN Security Council, and UN institutions more generally.\nI’d love to see a major UN campus in China, to help lead the green and digital transformation worldwide. I’d love to see China and India working together closely at the UN, including towards India’s seat in the UN Security Council. I’d like China to support the African Union to play a much larger role in global governance. I’d like to see China, Japan and Korea end the geopolitical divisions and form a strong alliance in northeast Asia. Most importantly in this scenario, the US and Europe accept the rising role of China, India and the rest of the non-Western world.\nA second scenario is that the Western world hunkers down. It goes protectionist and the US tries to divide the world into camps. This is perhaps the likely US strategy, but I think it is significantly worse for the US and the rest of the world than the first scenario. I think the US absolutely should abandon the idea of building competing camps.\nThe third scenario is that we don’t have a global system at all, but rather increasing chaos from climate change, wars and geopolitical conflicts. This dire scenario is a real possibility.\nAny of these three trajectories is possible. We should be aiming for the first. The United States and Europe should take a deep breath, sigh and welcome the non-Western world into a shared global leadership. The major powers – the US, Europe, Russia, China, India – should agree to prevent confrontations.\nThe US should stop Nato enlargement and should stop providing armaments to Taiwan. Such actions are provocative and lead to great-power conflicts that threaten the safety and security of the whole world.\nIn short, the West should stop asking “Who is Number One?” and instead ask, “How can the whole world work together for the global common good?” In my experience, China, Russia and other nations would enthusiastically back such a global, cooperative effort that is based on mutual respect and mutual security.","summary":"Jeffrey Sachs is an economics professor and director of the Centre for Sustainable Development at Columbia University.

Democrats hold 62 of the seats in the majority-Republican chamber. \n\nAt least 51 Democratic members are leaving the state, said Josh Rush Nisenson, spokesperson for the House Democratic Caucus.\n\n“Apathy is complicity, and we will not be complicit in the silencing of hard-working communities who have spent decades fighting for the power that Trump wants to steal,” he said.\n\nThe move marks the second time in four years that Texas Democrats have fled the state to block a vote. In 2021, a 38-day standoff took place when Democrats left for Washington, D.C. in opposition to new voting restrictions.\n\nRepublican Gov. Greg Abbott called a special session of the Legislature that started last month to take up the redistricting effort, as well as to respond to flooding in Texas Hill Country that killed at least 135 people in July. \n\nTrump has urged Texas Republicans to redraw the map to help the party net a handful of seats in the midterms next year.\n\n“For weeks, we’ve been warning that if Republicans in Texas want a showdown — if they want to delay flood relief to cravenly protect Donald Trump from an inevitable midterm meltdown — then we’d give them that showdown,” Democratic Party Chair Ken Martin said in a statement. “That’s exactly what Texas Democrats did today: blowing up Republicans’ sham special session that’s virtually ignored the plight of flood victims in Kerr County.”\n\nAttorney General Ken Paxton on X said the state should “use every tool at our disposal to hunt down those who think they are above the law.”\n\n“Democrats in the Texas House who try and run away like cowards should be found, arrested, and brought back to the Capitol immediately,” he wrote.\n\nAbbott’s office and House Speaker Dustin Burrows did not immediately respond to requests for comment Sunday afternoon.\n\nTexas Republicans last week unveiled their planned new U.S. House map that would create five new Republican-leaning seats. Republicans currently hold 25 of the state’s 38 seats.\n\nBy leaving the state, Democrats are looking to block Republicans from the needed quorum to hold votes on the map set for Monday. The Texas House has rules to fine lawmakers $500 each day they break a quorum. GOP Attorney General Ken Paxton has said previously that if Democrats break quorum, “they should be found and arrested no matter where they go.”\n\n“My office stands ready to assist local, state, and federal authorities in hunting down and compelling the attendance of anyone who abandons their office and their constituents for cheap political theater,” Paxton said on the social media platform X on July 15.\n\nA large chunk of the Texas Democrats are heading to Illinois, where Democratic Gov. JB Pritzker had been in quiet talks with them for weeks about offering support if they chose to leave the state to break quorum. Pritzker, a potential 2028 presidential contender, has been one of Trump’s most outspoken critics during his second term.\n\nLast week, Pritzker hosted several Texas Democrats in Illinois to publicly oppose the redistricting effort. California Gov. Gavin Newsom held a similar event in his own state.\n\nPritzker also met privately with Texas Democratic Chair Kendall Scudder in June to begin planning for the possibility that lawmakers would depart for Illinois if they did decide to break quorum to block the map, according to a source with direct knowledge who requested anonymity to discuss private conversations.\n\nNow, with Texas Democrats holed up in Illinois and blocking the Trump-backed congressional map, the stage may be set for a high-profile showdown between Pritzker and the president.\n\nTrump is looking to avoid a repeat of his first term, when Democrats flipped the House just two years into his presidency, and hopes the new Texas map will aid that effort. Trump officials have also looked at redrawing lines in other states, such as Missouri, according to a person familiar with conversations but unauthorized to speak publicly about them.","summary":"Texas Democrats left the state Sunday in an attempt to prevent the state House from holding a vote Monday on new congressional maps that Republicans hope will net them several additional U.S. House seats in the 2026 midterm elections.","url":"https://nypost.com/2025/08/03/us-news/texas-democrats-leave-state-to-block-vote-on-redrawn-house-map/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/08/newspress-collage-emn1yktwm-1754257745835.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&1754243379&w=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/3Pdhzb26-RyIcpnTz.mp4","publish_date":"2025-08-03 21:57:57","author":"Associated Press","authors":["Associated Press"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.557},{"id":347858164,"title":"Nintendo Increases Price of the Switch from $299 to $339","text":"Nintendo announced on Friday that its decision to increase prices was driven by “market conditions,” shortly after a similar price adjustment took effect in Canada on August 1st.

In a press conference on Thursday, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said that the new structure will not entirely replace the East Wing, but rather “modernize” it.\n\nThe construction is expected to cost $200 million, funded by President Donald Trump and other private donors, and is slated to begin in September. The House did not provide a completion date for the project but assured that the ballroom will open “long before the end of President Trump’s term.”\n\nThe ballroom construction plans show a massive addition where the East Wing is currently positioned and roughly mirrors the architectural style the rest of the House campus exhibits.\n\nA rendering of the ballroom’s design anticipates a sprawling great room and elaborate gold details. As depicted, the ballroom is set to include gold chandeliers, an ornate coffered ceiling, Greek Corinthian columns and tall, arched windows to each wall. The plans also include room for a number of round tables and gold chairs.\n\nUpdates about the project’s construction will be posted to the White House’s “visit” page, the release stated. The construction will be facilitated by McCrery Architects, with its CEO Jim McCrery calling the project a “beautiful and necessary renovation to The People’s House.”\n\nThe announcement of the ballroom comes amid other construction on the White House grounds, as the Trumps oversee the controversial removal of the Rose Garden lawn, which was installed under President John F. Kennedy.\n\nAccording to recent photos, the Rose Garden’s lawn has been converted to a concrete patio area, after the president previously complained that the grass could cause women’s heels to sink into the dirt.\n\nWhen the Rose Garden renovations began in early June, a White House official described the new construction as a “restoration” and told PEOPLE that the Trumps “have deep respect for the history of the White House and for the Rose Garden.”\n\n“This restoration to the Rose Garden preserves the beauty of the space and builds on the work done in 2020,” the official said, “with a focus on enhancing practical use and guest experience for those attending special events.”\n\nSource: People.com","summary":"The White House is reconstructing the East Wing to feature a large ballroom.

JB Pritzker, who previously met with the Texas delegation last month, ensuring logistical support for their visit. A press briefing featuring the governor and Texas Democrats is anticipated later on Sunday.\n\n“We’re leaving Texas to stand up for Texans,” declared Texas House Democratic Caucus Chair Gene Wu in a statement. “We refuse to let disaster relief be manipulated for a Trump gerrymander scheme. We’re not shirking our duties; we’re stepping away from a flawed system that ignores the electorate we represent. From this point forward, this corrupt special session is concluded.”\n\nRecently, Texas Republicans unveiled a new congressional map proposal designed to secure five additional seats for the GOP in the next year’s midterm elections. This move comes after President Donald Trump’s vocal encouragement for a favorable map in Texas as he strives to sustain a congressional majority during a historically challenging term for the White House incumbent’s party.\n\nThe proposed map would redraw district boundaries in a manner that jeopardizes current Democratic Congress members in regions surrounding Austin, Dallas, and Houston, as well as two vulnerable Democrats from south Texas districts, which Trump won last year.\n\nA House committee sanctioned the partisan congressional maps following a vote strictly along party lines on Saturday morning. Post-vote, committee chairman, Republican state Rep. Cody Vasut, informed NBC News that the maps were intentionally designed to secure more Republican seats.\n\n“This map was politically based, and that’s totally legal, totally allowed and totally fair,” Vasut said. “You got states like California and New York and Illinois that have these really large margins between the percentage of seats they have and the percentage of votes that they’re getting, and Texas is underperforming in that. And so it’s totally prudent, totally right, for Texas to be able to respond and improve the political performance of its map.”\n\nWu’s statement said Democrats’ move “is not a decision we make lightly, but it is one we make with absolute moral clarity.”\n\n“Governor Abbott has turned the victims of a historic tragedy into political hostages in his submission to Donald Trump,” Wu continued. “He is using an intentionally racist map to steal the voices of millions of Black and Latino Texans, all to execute a corrupt political deal. Apathy is complicity, and we will not be complicit in the silencing of hard-working communities who have spent decades fighting for the power that Trump wants to steal.”\n\nPolitically, the move puts Pritzker at the center of a high-profile national fight. The governor, who is running for his third term in office, is also widely viewed as a 2028 presidential contender. He has implored Democrats to resist Trump’s agenda.\n\nThe origins of Pritzker’s involvement began when the governor gave a keynote address to Oklahoma Democrats in June. Pritzker met privately in a “robust” meeting with the party chair to talk about the Texas redistricting, according to a person close to the governor. When Pritzker later met with Texas Democrats, he assured them they could come to his state and find support, including finding hotels, meeting spaces and other logistical assistance.\n\nThe Texas Democrats, however, face the risk of a $500-a-day fine and even possible arrest for fleeing the state. The Republican-controlled Legislature approved the measure in 2023, two years after state Democrats left the state for three weeks to block an elections bill from progressing.\n\n“Democrats have got to stand up at this point and tell every individual in this nation, ‘This is not normal. This is not democracy,’” Democratic state Rep. Ann Johnson told NBC News on Saturday.\n\n“You’ve got these Texas Republicans that are just rolling over and giving Trump what he wants because he’s asked for it,” Johnson said. “It’s an affront to every citizen, not only in Texas but the nation.”\n\nThe Texas House is scheduled to convene at 3 p.m. CT Monday. The redistricting bill is so far the only item on the calendar.\n\nNatasha Korecki reported from Chicago, and Ryan Chandler from Austin, Texas.","summary":"Internewscast

production by 547,000 bpd","text":"Saudi Arabia, Russia and six key members of the OPEC+ alliance said Sunday they will increase production by 547,000 barrels a day in a move which analysts say aims to regain market share amid resilient crude prices.\n\nIraq, United Arab Emirates, Kuwait, Kazakhstan, Algeria and Oman, along with the Saudis and Russians -- together nicknamed the Voluntary Eight (V8) -- currently produce about 41-42 million barrels a day, so the increase is about 1.5 percent.\n\nAnalysts said there was unlikely to be a major impact on prices, with the Brent reference oil currently selling at about $70 a barrel.\n\n\"The eight participating countries will implement a production adjustment of 547,000 barrels per day in September 2025 from August 2025 required production level,\" said a statement released after a meeting where the hike was agreed.\n\nThe eight key producers, who started increasing production in April, affirmed their commitment to market stability on \"current healthy oil market fundamentals,\" an OPEC statement read.\n\nOil prices have held up better than observers anticipated amid strong summer demand and a high geopolitical risk premium, notably owing to conflict between Iran and Israel.\n\n\"OPEC+ has passed the first test -- unwinding 2.2 million barrels per day (since April) without crashing prices or compromising unity,\" said Jorge Leon, analyst at Rystad Energy.\n\n\"But the next task will be even harder: deciding if and when to unwind the remaining 1.66 million barrels, all while navigating geopolitical tension and preserving cohesion,\" said Leon.\n\nThe post-meeting statement said the decision came \"in view of a steady global economic outlook and current healthy market fundamentals, as reflected in the low oil inventories.\"\n\nThe OPEC+ countries agreed in December to start a gradual return from last April of the 2.2 million barrels per day of previous production cuts.\n\nThe latest move, a year ahead of an initial 18-month schedule, completes the unwinding and also provides for a 300,000 barrels per day tranche granted specifically to the United Arab Emirates.\n\nThe statement said that \"the phase-out of the additional voluntary production adjustments may be paused or reversed subject to evolving market conditions\".\n\nThe eight added that they will hold monthly meetings for a regular review of market conditions.\n\nFor now, the return of other production cuts is to be discussed at the next OPEC+ ministerial meeting at the end of November, with all 22 members.\n\nBut OPEC said the V8 will first meet on September 7.\n\nIn a bid to boost prices, the wider OPEC+ group -- comprising the 12-nation Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and its allies -- in recent years had agreed to three different tranches of output cuts, amounting to almost six million bpd in total.\n\nAfter a long period of producers seeking to combat price erosion by implementing production cuts to make oil scarcer, recent months have seen a shift in strategy.\n\nPrior to the announcement, UBS analyst Giovanni Staunovo had suggested the quota increase was \"largely priced in\" on energy markets.\n\nWhat happens over the next few months is less certain but ING's Warren Patterson said that the \"base scenario\" will see the V8 pause output hikes for the time being.\n\nFor Patterson, a significant surplus may well emerge from the fourth quarter of this year, which OPEC+ would have to manage carefully.\n\n\"The alliance is striving to find a balance between regaining

plan to flee state to try to stop proposed congressional maps","text":"Democratic statehouse legislators are planning to leave Texas on Sunday in order to break the quorum of a special legislative session in which Republican state legislators are aiming to pass a new congressional map that could create up to five new GOP seats.\n\nThe move comes after a marathon public hearing on the plan in the state Capitol on Friday and less than a week after state Republican legislators proposed the new maps. Republicans hold a majority in the Texas state legislature; Democrats had said they would consider all options to stop the maps from being passed, although their options for striking back have been limited.\n\n“We’re not walking out on our responsibilities; we’re walking out on a rigged system that refuses to listen to the people we represent. As of today, this corrupt special session is over,” state Rep. Gene Wu, who chairs the House Democratic Caucus, said in a statement.\n\nAfter news broke of Democratic legislators breaking quorum, Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton wrote in a post on X that Democrats who left should be arrested and brought back to the state capitol.\n\n\"Democrats in the Texas House who try and run away like cowards should be found, arrested, and brought back to the Capitol immediately,\" he wrote. \"We should use every tool at our disposal to hunt down those who think they are above the law.\"\n\nThe walkout itself cannot stop the passage of the bill, but Democrats aim to run out the clock on the 30-day special legislative session, which would mean Texas Gov. Greg Abbott would have to call another one. Texas House Democrats previously broke quorum in 2021 to try to stop an elections bill and in 2003 to try to stop a similar redistricting effort by Republicans. Republicans eventually managed to pass the bills both times.\n\nPresident Donald Trump has previously said he wanted Texas legislators to draw five new Republican districts.\n\nMore than 51 legislators are leaving the state, denying the state House the two-thirds majority out of 150 legislators it needs to have a quorum. An exact number of how many of the 62 Democratic legislators from the state House were leaving was not immediately available.\n\nDemocrats who break quorum risk accruing a $500-a-day fine, according to the state House rules, and potential legal action.\n\nTexas Attorney General Ken Paxton, speaking with \"War Room\" host and former Trump adviser Steve Bannon said on Thursday, “The House rules and the Senate rules both allow for these people to be arrested if they leave ... The challenge is, if they go out of state, we lose jurisdiction, and that -- it's been a challenge in the past, but in the end, as long as the governor is willing to keep calling sessions, ultimately they have to come home.”\n\nPaxton also said he was not worried about defending the maps in court: “We've got, we've got good maps. And the legislature has the right to draw the maps they want. They're politically based, not race based. And if they're politically based, then they're defensible.”\n\nSome of the Democratic legislators fleeing the state will appear on Sunday evening with Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker at a press conference. Pritzker has been a staunch supporter of Texas Democrats and has floated the possibility of getting Illinois’ own congressional maps redrawn if Texas redraws its maps. Illinois’ maps have been criticized by outside observers as highly partisan in favor of Democrats.\n\nIn late June, the chair of the Texas Democrats, Kendall Scudder, flew from Dallas to Oklahoma to see Pritzker, who was giving remarks at the state Democratic Party's dinner. The pair had a private meeting during that to talk about the possibility of lawmakers fleeing the state to Illinois -- and if they were to flee the state, that they would have a place they would feel safe and supported.\n\nSince then, Pritzker and Texas Democrats have been in touch, and a small group of them traveled to Chicago in July when members of the delegation left for Illinois and California for brief meetings.\n\nPritzker and his team have been helping behind the scenes to help find hotels in the area for the Democrats, help their operation, and grease the wheels so things go smoothly for them as they head to Illinois.\n\nThe bill containing the maps had been scheduled to be taken up on the state House floor on Monday.","summary":"Texas state House Democrats plan to leave to break quorum of a special session in which Republicans aim to pass a new congressional map that could net the GOP five seats.","url":"https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/texas-house-democrats-plan-flee-state-stop-proposed/story?id=124326241","image":"https://i.abcnewsfe.com/a/7ab005b2-36c9-4a34-bf1e-6ffe15f272d9/TX-RESIDISTRICTING_1754243688463_hpMain_16x9.jpg?w=1600","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-08-03 21:18:59","author":"Brittany Shepherd,Oren Oppenheim","authors":["Brittany Shepherd","Oren Oppenheim"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.544}]}
