The 81-year-old president was isolating with COVID in his $3.4 million home in Rehoboth Beach, Delaware, when he and his shrinking inner circle composed a letter saying it was time to step aside. Donors had pulled millions of dollars in funds, the list of Democrats telling him to drop out was growing by the day, and polls suggested that his chances of beating Donald Trump were dwindling after his disastrous debate performance. Jill Biden was there when her husband made the historic call, giving into mounting pressure. The question now is what pushed him to finally make the extraordinary move that blindsided some of his White House staff and most of the people working on his re-election campaign. On Saturday evening, Biden summoned to his side two men who have been there since his political start: advisers Steve Ricchetti and Mike Donilon. They have been with him through the best of times – his first years as a senator – to the worst of times – the death of his son Beau Biden. Already with the president and the first lady were their closest aides Annie Tomasini and Anthony Bernal, who they refer to as ‘family.’ Biden asked Ricchetti and Donilon to start drafting a letter and begin the process of how to make a public announcement, DailyMail.com confirmed. And the president also told his family. It suggests that Biden ultimately weighed the evidence against him and made the call that he couldn’t move forward for the good of the party. He had insisted that he would only step aside if he was shown polling that proved Kamala Harris would fare better than him against Trump in the general election, or if he developed a ‘medical condition.’ Was he given statistics showing he was doomed in November? Did he decide he wasn’t healthy enough to serve another four years? Or did he make a selfless decision based on the good of the future of the party? At 1:45 pm on Sunday, Biden, still at the beach house in Delaware, began calling his senior staff at the White House and the campaign. He had already spoken with Vice President Kamala Harris and Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer. In each conversation, he dropped his bombshell: He was exiting the presidential race. At 1:46 pm, his campaign account posted a letter from the president announcing his decision even as he was still on the staff call. Most of his staff – both in the White House and at the campaign – were shocked. They learned the news online, getting the alert when the @JoeBiden account posted the president’s missive. ‘No one had a heads up before the tweet posted,’ a campaign staffer told DailyMail.com. ‘Which, to me, is an insane way to treat the 1300 people that work for you on the campaign.’ It capped a chaotic 48 hours for the Biden family as they hunkered in behind their patriarch with a small, inner circle of longtime aides supporting them. Some were even reporting back to Jill Biden about those staffers deemed disloyal. Meanwhile, Biden had veered from angry at the pressure from his party to acceptance of the situation. And once his final decision was made on Saturday night, the rest moved quickly. Biden called Harris directly to tell her the news. He also had one-on-one calls with White House chief of staff Jeff Zients and campaign chair Jen O’Malley Dillon, according to reports. He would also speak with his Cabinet, Members of Congress, governors, and supporters. But it all happened so fast many staff were hurt about the way they learned of the news, although they weren’t surprised by it. The writing has been on the wall. Almost 40 Democratic lawmakers had called on Biden to exit the race. Major donors were threatening to pull their support. Actor George Clooney wrote an op-ed in the New York Times calling on Biden to step down. And Barack Obama was reportedly working behind the scenes to get Biden to move aside. It ‘needed to happen,’ a Democratic aide said. ‘But he kinda just dropped a bomb. Like it’s not surprising but it’s shocking.’ Another staffer said people were feeling ‘a mix of relief, gratefulness, hope.’ The campaign held an all-hands on deck call at 5 pm ET to reassure staff they still had their jobs. Campaign Chair Jen O’Malley Dillon acknowledged that it was ‘hard for staff who may have gotten the news while they were working or door knocking, but it was important for the president to hear from him in his own words.’ Publicly, aides have been loyal to Biden. Many have gone on TV and taken to social media to defend the president since his disastrous debate performance against Donald Trump 24 days ago, arguing Biden was the party’s nominee and planned to stay the nominee. Since the June 26th debate, staff had been trying to go about business as usual, pushing back at reports Biden would drop out. ‘Fanfiction’ declared deputy press secretary Andrew Bates said of reports Biden would drop out this weekend, advising Democrats to ‘keep the faith.’ Even on Sunday morning, the message from the campaign was Biden was in it to win it. Campaign co-chairman Cedric Richmond, said on CBS Face the Nation on Sunday morning: ‘I want to be crystal clear. He’s made a decision and that decision is to accept the nomination and run for reelection, win reelection.’ Officials defended the manner in which the decision was announced. It was made at the ‘last minute,’ a White House official said. It was actually made in the last 24 hours, with only Biden’s family and a small circle of close aides knowing of his decision. And by withholding it from senior staff until the last minute – and not telling junior staff at all – the news didn’t leak. It came out on Biden’s terms. It all fits with a man said to be frustrated at what he saw as a public pressure campaign to force his hand. Biden has spent the past four days being isolated both physically and politically. He is at the beach house in Delaware, on the Atlantic Ocean as he recovers from COVID, still coughing and hoarse from the virus. First lady Jill Biden has been with him, although staying in a separate room. And, it has been from there the president has watched Democrat after Democrat call for his exit even as he spent the past three weeks trying to reassure the party he was mentally and physically up to a second term. But, despite everything he’s done – national TV interviews, local radio interviews, a press conference, and campaign stops – nothing had quelled the tide against him. In the aftermath of the decision, Biden’s family was loud and clear in their love and support, praising him for his service to the country. Jill Biden sent him her love on Sunday afternoon, retweeting his letter with two red hearts. Naomi Biden, the Bidens’ eldest granddaughter, wrote a long post on X, where she said she was ‘proud’ of her ‘pop,’ which is what the grandchildren call President Biden. She noted: ‘Our world is better today in so many ways thanks to him. To the Americans who have always had his back, keep the faith. He will always have ours.’ And Hunter Biden said in a statement of his father: ‘He is unique in public life today, in that there is no distance between Joe Biden the man and Joe Biden the public servant of the last 54 years. I’m so lucky every night I get to tell him I love him, and to thank him. I ask all Americans to join me tonight in doing the same. Thank you, Mr. President. I love you, Dad.’","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nFollowing weeks of crisis talks and a growing tidal wave of Democrats&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: The surprising decision that led Biden to step down: An inside look at the unexpected moment and key players involved first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/news/us/the-surprising-decision-that-led-biden-to-step-down-an-inside-look-at-the-unexpected-moment-and-key-players-involved/","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2024/07/21/23/87599581-13657081-image-a-18_1721601335491.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-07-22 00:27:13","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.289},{"id":252300622,"title":"NY Dems are already lining up behind Kamala Harris to replace Biden — with 3 big exceptions","text":"New York’s Democratic leaders quickly coalesced around Vice President Kamala Harris to be the party’s standard bearer for the White House after embattled President Biden announced he dropped out of the race. However, there were three big exceptions to the calls to unite around Harris. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, and Mayor Eric Adams were all silent Sunday night about who should replace Biden. “The winds are not just blowing toward Vice President Kamala Harris. It’s a hurricane for Kamala Harris for president,” said Manhattan Democratic leader and Harlemite Keith Wright. “She’s the most qualified. She’s been vice president, a U.S. senator, state attorney general. She’s got the training.” Gov. Kathy Hochul, meanwhile, endorsed Harris just before nightfall Sunday — becoming one of the later New York Dems to throw her support behind the vice president. “As Democrats, our mission remains the same: doing everything in our power to defeat Donald Trump,” she said in a statement sent shortly before 8 p.m. “When President Biden picked Kamala Harris to be his Vice President he unleashed incredible excitement for a new generation of political leadership. That same energy will carry us to November 5 with Vice President Harris leading our ticket.” Brooklyn Democratic Party chairman Rodneyse Bichotte — a close ally of Adams — also endorsed Harris as the presidential nominee. “Vice President Kamala Harris is a fierce fighter with a proven progressive track record, deep experience in the Oval Office, and the determined drive to defeat Trump at the ballot box,” Bichotte said. Queens Borough President Donovan Richards, a Biden delegate, said his allegiance is now with Harris. “In Vice President Kamala Harris, we are lucky to have yet another unshakable ally in Washington. This November, I wholeheartedly believe she will shatter that glass ceiling once and for all and I look forward to working with her in continuing to move America forward,” he said. Bronx Assemblyman Jeffrey Dinowitz, a Biden delegate, also said Harris will be the nominee. “Kamala has been the vice president. She’s ready for the job. I believe she’s the best choice,” Dinowitz, also secretary of the Bronx Democratic Party, said. Robert Zimmerman, a Democratic National Committee delegate from New York, said Harris is “fully prepared from day one to confront Donald Trump head-on. The stakes are at their highest; the threat he poses is more dire than ever. And the future we can forge together has never been brighter.” Two other key New York Democratic Party honchos with national influence — former President Bill Clinton and ex-Secretary of State and Sen. Hillary Clinton — were among the first in New York to endorsed Harris earlier Sunday. Sources said it was only a matter of time before key African-American members and others from the New York congressional delegation — including House Democratic Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries of Brooklyn and Queens Rep. Greg Meeks — officially endorse Harris. During an interview on 1010 WINS radio Sunday, Adams declined to state a preference and instead focused on issues he wants the Democratic ticket to address. “Everyone in the country should know exactly what the party is going to focus on, including border security and safety, and again, affordability, public safety, and really working for working-class people who believe the everyday cost of living is just seem to have elude them,” Adams said. “I think if we’re clear on that message, we’re going to be successful in November.” Jacobs on Sunday said he wanted to discuss the future ticket with party delegates before issuing a statement in the coming days.","summary":"\"The winds are not just blowing toward Vice President Kamala Harris.

Rep. John Garamendi, D-Calif., tells “NewsNation Prime” that Biden’s endorsement of his running mate, Vice President Kamala Harris, has “slammed the door” for other Democratic hopefuls like California Gov. Gavin Newsom. Newsom has already endorsed Harris, calling her “tough,” “fearless” and “tenacious” in a post on X, formerly known as Twitter. “With our democracy at stake and our future on the line, no one is better to prosecute the case against Donald Trump’s dark vision and guide our country in a healthier direction than America’s Vice President,” the post read in part. Though plenty of politicians want a seat in the Oval Office, Garamendi explained they will just have to wait until the next election cycle to get a shot. “He’ll be back on the field as a presidential candidate,” Garamendi said. “But he’s not going to take on Harris.” Some Democratic donors and officials are reaching out to West Virginia Sen. Joe Manchin to consider standing for the presidential nomination, a source familiar confirmed to NewsNation. Manchin is reportedly considering registering as a Democrat once again to join the race. Newsom could, however, join Harris. If Harris secures the nomination, he’s one of the front-runners to become part of the new Democratic ticket. Others include: Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper Arizona Sen. Mark Kelly Maryland Gov. Wes Moore Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer Garamendi thinks the female hopefuls will likely be ruled out if Harris is the nominee, but there are “several that are absolutely excellent vice president candidates.” Though Garamendi is sad that calls for Biden to leave grew loud enough to force his hand, he is ready to support whatever the future holds for the party: “That is now yesterday.” “I think we’ve got a terrific opportunity with Harris,” he added.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\n(NewsNation) — With nearly 4,000 delegates up for grabs during the Democratic National&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Governor Newsom supports Kamala Harris: Described as Strong, Courageous, and Persistent. first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/news/us/governor-newsom-supports-kamala-harris-described-as-strong-courageous-and-persistent/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/rewrite-this-title-Gov-Newsom-endorses-Kamala-Harris-039Tough-Fearless.jpeg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-07-22 00:20:10","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.23},{"id":252300678,"title":"Many Democrats back Harris in 2024 race, but Pelosi, Obama silent","text":"Many Democrats on Sunday (Jul 21) quickly backed Vice President Kamala Harris to run as the party's presidential nominee against Donald Trump after incumbent President Joe Biden's abrupt departure from the race, but some powerful party members, including former House of Representatives speaker Nancy Pelosi, stayed quiet. After weeks of fighting among Democrats on whether Biden, 81, should stay in the race, a rush of support coalescing behind Harris, if she is to be the nominee, is crucial with just over 100 days before the November election. But there are plenty of doubts inside the Democratic Party about whether Harris can beat Trump, the Republican nominee and former president. Some Democrats have suggested that the party should hold a mini-primary before the August convention. Biden himself endorsed Harris on Sunday, in a separate statement following his letter saying that he is stepping down. He was quickly followed by the powerful Congressional Black Caucus, several key donors, various lawmakers and super PACs including Priorities USA and Unite the Country. \"Today I want to offer my full support and endorsement for Kamala to be the nominee of our party this year,\" Biden said on social media platform X. \"Democrats — it's time to come together and beat Trump. Let’s do this.\" The list of Democratic lawmakers endorsing Harris grew as the day progressed. By Sunday evening, the list included California Governor Gavin Newsom, Colorado Governor Jared Polis, North Carolina Governor Roy Cooper, Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro, US Senator Mark Kelly of Arizona, US Senator Patty Murray of Washington state, US Representative James Clyburn of South Carolina, and US Representative Pramila Jayapal of Massachusetts. Dmitri Mehlhorn, an adviser to Reid Hoffman, the LinkedIn founder and a major Democratic donor, called Harris \"the American dream personified,\" noting she is the daughter of immigrants. \"She is also toughness personified, rising from my home town of Oakland California to become the top prosecutor of the state. With Scranton Joe stepping back, I cannot wait to help elect President Harris.\" All 50 Democratic party state chairs will support Harris as the party's new presidential nominee, Reuters reported on Sunday, citing multiple sources. Former President Bill Clinton and Hillary Clinton, who served as secretary of State under President Barack Obama, also endorsed Harris in a statement.","summary":"","url":"https://www.channelnewsasia.com/world/kamala-harris-democratic-presidential-nominee-pelosi-obama-silent-joe-biden-4495081","image":"https://onecms-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/s--pGJFPIJt--/fl_relative,g_south_east,l_mediacorp:cna:watermark:2024-04:reuters_1,w_0.1/f_auto,q_auto/c_fill,g_auto,h_338,w_600/v1/one-cms/core/2024-07-21t203257z_1_lynxmpek6k085_rtroptp_3_usa-election-harri","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-07-22 00:18:36","author":null,"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"SG","sentiment":-0.117},{"id":252300454,"title":"Biden drops out of presidential race, endorses Harris as successor","text":"US President Joe Biden dropped out of the presidential race Sunday as his poor debate performance last month exacerbated concerns about his old age and touched off unrelenting calls to end his reelection campaign. Biden, 81, made the announcement, bowing to mounting pressure from Democratic lawmakers, donors and voters. He officially endorsed Vice President Kamala Harris to become the Democratic Party's nominee to take on former President Donald Trump in the Nov. 5 general election. It is unprecedented in America's modern history that despite dominating monthslong nomination contests, a presidential candidate suspended his campaign just weeks before a national party convention. Since the early 1950s, two Democratic presidents -- Harry Truman and Lyndon Johnson -- have desisted from running for another term during an election year. The Democratic Party has been preparing to hold its national convention in Chicago, Illinois, from Aug. 19-22 to officially nominate its standard-bearer. The Republican Party formally crowned Trump as the GOP nominee during its convention in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, last week. \"It has been the greatest honor of my life to serve as your president,\" Biden said in a statement posted on X, formerly Twitter. \"And while it has been my intention to seek re-election, I believe it is in the best interest of my party and the country for me to stand down and focus entirely on fulfilling my duties as president for the remainder of my term,\" he added. In a separate post, Biden officially expressed his support for Harris. \"My very first decision as the party nominee in 2020 was to pick Kamala Harris as my vice president. And it's been the best decision I've made,\" he said. \"Today, I want to offer my full support and endorsement for Kamala to be the nominee of our party this year. Democrats -- it's time to come together and beat Trump. Let's do this.\" His exit from the race came amid unrelenting pressure on him to step aside following the June 27 presidential debate where he lost his train of thought, misspoke and failed to articulate his views on certain issues while Trump ramped up his criticism of Biden's policy. Dismissing the woeful debate performance as a one-off episode and stressing age as a source of \"wisdom,\" Biden had been trying to squelch concerns about his age through media interviews, a press conference and other public appearances. But the efforts failed to quell calls from Democratic leaders and others for him to bow out. Some party members not only questioned the viability of Biden's candidacy but also voiced concerns over the possibility of its impact on down-ballot races. Harris, 59, vowed to do \"everything\" to bring the Democratic Party together to defeat Trump in the general election. \"I am honored to have the president's endorsement, and my intention is to earn and win this nomination. Over the past year, I have traveled across the country, talking with Americans about the clear choice in this momentous election. And that is what I will continue to do in the days and weeks ahead,\" she said in a statement carried by the New York Times. \"I will do everything in my power to unite the Democratic Party -- and unite our nation -- to defeat Donald Trump and his extreme Project 2025 agenda. We have 107 days until Election Day. Together, we will fight. And together, we will win.\" Despite Biden's endorsement for Harris, uncertainty still lingers over whether she can be officially nominated given that more than 4,600 party delegates are free to vote for any candidate and will determine the ultimate nominee. But in the event of a contested nomination process, Harris -- with the backing of Biden -- is seen as being at an advantage, considering that Biden's campaign could help her with a growing number of Democrats and party supporters starting to coalesce behind her. A former senator from California, Harris, America's first female vice president, is expected to represent a new generation in the election battle against Trump, 78. If formally nominated, she would get an opportunity to try to become the first US woman president. Soon after Biden's announcement, Trump told CNN that he thinks Harris will be easier to defeat than Biden would have been. He also criticized Biden as one that goes \"down as the single worst president by far in the history of our country.\" In a post on Truth Social, Trump continued his criticism against Biden, saying the incumbent president is \"not fit to run for president\" and \"not fit to serve.\" \"He only attained the position of president by lies, fake news, and not leaving his basement,\" he wrote. \"All those around him, including his doctor and the media, knew that he wasn't capable of being president, and he wasn't.\" Biden has been self-isolating due to COVID-19 infection -- a pause that came at a time when questions have persisted over whether he is mentally and physically strong enough to effectively lead the country for another four-year term. On July 15, Trump was officially nominated as the GOP nominee for the presidential election. At the convention, his supporters cast him as a \"resilient\" leader as he has survived an assassination attempt during a recent campaign rally in Pennsylvania. The GOP event underscored his stable political footing despite his conviction in a high-profile hush-money trial in May. In a statement, former President Barack Obama backed Biden's decision to opt out, describing the president as a \"patriot of the highest order.\" \"I also know Joe has never backed down from a fight. For him to look at the political landscape and decide that he should pass the torch to a new nominee is surely one of the toughest in his life,\" he said. \"But I know he wouldn't make this decision unless he believed it was right for America.\" Obama expressed \"extraordinary confidence\" that Democratic Party leaders will be able to \"create a process from which an outstanding nominee emerges,\" while acknowledging the party will be navigating \"uncharted waters\" in the days ahead. In a social media post, House Speaker Mike Johnson called for Biden's resignation. \"If Joe Biden is not fit to run for President, he is not fit to serve as President,\" the Republican speaker wrote on X. \"He must resign the office immediately. November 5 cannot arrive soon enough.\" He also issued a warning against potential US \"adversaries.\" \"Regardless of the chaos in the current White House, our adversaries around the globe should be reminded that the US Congress, the US military, and the American people are fully prepared and committed to defend our interests both at home and abroad,\" he said.

While the announcement may dispel widespread concern surrounding the Democratic nominee’s capacity to lead — especially relative to Republican nominee Donald Trump — the issue that has prompted mass protest against the Democratic incumbent still looms large over the campaign: Biden’s virtually unconditional support for Israel’s war on Gaza. Biden has maintained a chiefly deferential and supportive stance throughout Israel’s bombardment of Gaza. Now, some see his departure as opening the possibility for a reset on U.S. policy toward Israel. Former Biden Department of Education political appointee Tariq Habash — who resigned in January in protest of Biden’s policies on the Gaza war — notes that a significant part of the base is already disillusioned with Biden because of his unwillingness to enforce U.S. law and hold Israel accountable for violations of international humanitarian law. Biden’s decision also comes just two days after the International Court of Justice ruled that Israel’s occupation of Palestine constitutes illegal apartheid. “Whoever replaces the President on the ticket needs to show voters that there will be a substantive shift in policy that ends the dehumanization of Palestinians and supports Palestinian human rights, international law, and peace,” Habash said. “Obviously both Democrats and Republicans have a long way to go,” he added. “This week’s visit from Netanyahu is emblematic of that, as is President Biden’s refusal to hold his red lines, enforce Leahy or Foreign Assistance Act, or achieve a permanent ceasefire or return Palestinian and Israeli hostages.” Many critics had noted that Biden’s stance on Israel’s war revealed concerning signs of his leadership and adaptability far before the fateful June debate. “It was not Biden’s failed debate that showed he is unfit to lead. It was the tens of thousands of bombs he sent to kill Palestinian families,” the U.S. Campaign for Palestinian Rights said in a statement. “Biden’s refusal to adhere to international law or enforce U.S. law has deepened Israel’s illegal military occupation. The International Court of Justice’s latest advisory opinion on Friday asserted that every state has a legal obligation ‘not to render aid or assistance in maintaining the situation’ created by Israel’s denial of Palestinian rights.” No matter who replaces Biden, Riley Livermore — an Air Force major who said the Biden administration was “complicit in genocide” when he resigned in June — said the moment presents a possible inflection point for U.S. policy on Israel’s war. “That being said, Biden isn’t stepping down because of pressure on how brutal his Gaza policy was. From my perspective, the ongoing genocide in Gaza had minimal to no impact on the pressure for him to step down. I’m still disheartened that the Democratic Party doesn’t care about Palestinians and continues to offer unconditional support to Israel,” Livermore told The Intercept, repeating that he resigned due to Biden’s policies on Gaza, not his age. One senior Democratic aide told The Intercept that they were wary of the rushed process to replace the candidate that had little to do with how Biden’s support for a war that’s killed 15,000 children in Gaza may have already irreparably hurt his chances among crucial voting blocs. “The country needs to hear from an anti-war candidate who sees Palestinians as human beings,” they said. “It’s important that our next candidate is chosen through a democratic process at an open convention.” Biden and scores of elected officials and party caucuses have already thrown their support behind Vice President Kamala Harris to lead the Democratic ticket in November. And there have been signs that she may divert from Biden’s hard-line support for Israel’s campaign in Gaza. Late last year, Harris reportedly pushed the White House to be more sympathetic toward Palestinian suffering, and more forceful against Netanyahu to seek a long-term peace. In March, Harris delivered a speech in Selma, Alabama, forcefully calling for an “immediate ceasefire” and urging Israel to do more to increase the flow of aid to Gaza. “No excuses,” she insisted. While the speech seemed to mark a change in the administration’s stance on the war, reports surfaced that National Security Council officials had watered down parts of her speech. “We have to have a goal that we start working on right now, for peace and for an equal measure of security for Israelis and Palestinians,” Harris said later that month. “Palestinians have a right to self-determination; they have a right to dignity, and we’re going to have to work on that.” These reports have not gone unnoticed by people hoping for change in U.S. policy. Livermore said he was hopeful if Harris becomes the next president, she will take the opportunity to drastically change the U.S. posture toward Israel. “Harris has a choice between listening to her own humanity and the overwhelming will of the American people, or listening to donors and special interest groups by continuing to make genocide part of her platform and in doing so, delegitimizing America internationally.” “Leaders like myself, and the other Black faith leaders who signed open letters pressuring Biden to call for a permanent ceasefire in Gaza believe Harris would be much more sympathetic to the Palestinian cause if nominated,” Rev. Michael McBride, a pastor and founder of Black Church PAC said in a statement. “This could help reinvigorate a part of the base that has largely felt conflicted about casting a vote for Biden.” Waleed Shahid, co-founder of the Uncommitted National Movement — which has garnered over 700,000 people nationwide casting protest votes against Biden’s hard-line support for Israel — also noted dissenters’ openness to Harris. “While by no means a champion of the cause, I’ve heard numerous people note that Vice President Harris exhibited a deeply different emotional reaction to the stories of Palestinian suffering than President Biden,” he said in a statement. “While the Vice Presidency is limited, many feel that she would be an improvement from Biden’s severe lack of empathy for Palestinians and his ties to the AIPAC old guard in the party. However, challenging AIPAC’s power within the Democratic Party establishment remains a formidable task regardless of who the nominee is.”","summary":"Kamala Harris is less burdened by Biden's disastrous support for Israel's war, sparking some hope in pro-Palestine advocates\n\n\nThe post Biden Should Have Quit Over Gaza, but His Exit Could Be an Inflection Point appeared first on The Intercept.","url":"https://theintercept.com/2024/07/21/biden-quit-harris-president-gaza/","image":"https://theintercept.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/AP20226455585742.jpg?fit=2469%2C1491","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-07-22 00:13:42","author":"Prem Thakker","authors":["Prem Thakker"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.046},{"id":252300588,"title":"Gov.

Inside the 'last-minute' decision that 'completely blindsided' White House and campaign staff... and who was there when he 'dropped a bomb' READ MORE: Inside the White House coverup of Biden's condition READ MORE: Stay up-to-date with DailyMail.com's political blog By Emily Goodin, Senior White House Correspondent and Nikki Schwab, Chief Campaign Correspondent Published: 00:11 BST, 22 July 2024 | Updated: 01:09 BST, 22 July 2024 e-mail View comments Following weeks of crisis talks and a growing tidal wave of Democrats and allies saying the writing was on the wall, Joe Biden's earth-shattering decision to withdraw from the presidential race was last-minute. The 81-year-old president was isolating with COVID in his Rehoboth Beach, Delaware, home when he and his shrinking inner circle composed a letter saying it was time to step aside. Donors had pulled millions of dollars in funds, the list of Democrats telling him to drop out was growing by the day, and polls suggested that his chance of beating Donald Trump was dwindling after his disastrous debate performance. Jill Biden was there when her husband made the historic call, giving into mounting pressure. The question now is what pushed him to finally make the extraordinary move that blindsided some of his White House staff and most of the people working on his re-election campaign. Jill Biden has been with husband Joe Biden in Rehoboth as he made his decision on the 2024 presidential race - above the couple at their beach home in February On Saturday evening, Biden summoned to his side two men who have been there since his political start: advisers Steve Ricchetti and Mike Donilon. They have been with him through the best of times - his first years as a senator - to the worst of times - the death of his son Beau Biden. Already with the president and the first lady were their closest aides Annie Tomasini and Anthony Bernal, who they refer to as 'family.' Biden asked Ricchetti and Donilon to start drafting a letter and begin the process of how to make a public announcement, DailyMail.com confirmed. And the president also told his family. It suggests that Biden ultimately weighed the evidence against him and made the call that he couldn't move forward for the good of the party. He had insisted that he would only step aside if he was shown polling that proved Kamala Harris would fare better than him against Trump in the general election, or if he developed a 'medical condition.' Read More EXCLUSIVE Inside the White House cover-up before Biden dropped out Was he given statistics showing he was doomed in November? Did he decide he wasn't healthy enough to serve another four years? Or did he make a selfless decision based on the good of the future of the party? At 1:45 pm on Sunday, Biden, still at the beach house in Delaware, began calling his senior staff at the White House and the campaign. He had already spoken with Vice President Kamala Harris and Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer. In each conversation, he dropped his bombshell: He was exiting the presidential race. At 1:46 pm, his campaign account posted a letter from the president announcing his decision even as he was still on the staff call. Most of his staff – both in the White House and at the campaign - were shocked. They learned the news online, getting the alert when the @JoeBiden account posted the president's missive. 'No one had a heads up before the tweet posted,' a campaign staffer told DailyMail.com. 'Which, to me, is an insane way to treat the 1300 people that work for you on the campaign.' Steve Ricchetti, counselor to the president, (left) and Mike Donilon, campaign adviser, (right) were called to Rehoboth Beach to help Biden write the letter on his decision It capped a chaotic 48 hours for the Biden family as they hunkered in behind their patriarch with a small, inner circle of longtime aides supporting them. Some were even reporting back to Jill Biden about those staffers deemed disloyal. Meanwhile, Biden had veered from angry at the pressure from his party to acceptance of the situation. And once his final decision was made on Saturday night, the rest moved quickly. Biden called Harris directly to tell her the news. He also had one-on-one calls with White House chief of staff Jeff Zients and campaign chair Jen O'Malley Dillon, according to reports. He would also speak with his Cabinet, Members of Congress, governors, and supporters. But it all happened so fast many staff were hurt about the way they learned of the news, although they weren't surprised by it. The writing has been on the wall. Almost 40 Democratic lawmakers had called on Biden to exit the race. Major donors were threatening to pull their support. Actor George Clooney wrote an op-ed in the New York Times calling on Biden to step down. And Barack Obama was reportedly working behind the scenes to get Biden to move aside. It 'needed to happen,' a Democratic aide said. 'But he kinda just dropped a bomb. Like it's not surprising but it's shocking.' Another staffer said people were feeling 'a mix of relief, gratefulness, hope.' The campaign held an all-hands on deck call at 5 pm ET to reassure staff they still had their jobs. Campaign Chair Jen O'Malley Dillon acknowledged that it was 'hard for staff who may have gotten the news while they were working or door knocking, but it was important for the president to hear from him in his own words.' President Joe Biden, from left, walks with White House deputy chief of staff Annie Tomasini, White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre, White House deputy chief of staff Bruce Reed and White House communications director Ben LaBolt in April Anthony Bernal, senior adviser to Jill Biden, and Annie Tomasini, deputy chief of staff, exit the White House together in February - he runs the East Wing; she runs the West Wing Publicly, aides have been loyal to Biden. Many have gone on TV and taken to social media to defend the president since his disastrous debate performance against Donald Trump 24 days ago, arguing Biden was the party's nominee and planned to stay the nominee. Since the June 26th debate, staff had been trying to go about business as usual, pushing back at reports Biden would drop out. 'Fanfiction' declared deputy press secretary Andrew Bates said of reports Biden would drop out this weekend, advising Democrats to 'keep the faith.' Even on Sunday morning, the message from the campaign was Biden was in it to win it. Campaign co-chairman Cedric Richmond, said on CBS Face the Nation on Sunday morning: 'I want to be crystal clear. He's made a decision and that decision is to accept the nomination and run for reelection, win reelection.' Officials defended the manner in which the decision was announced. It was made at the 'last minute,' a White House official said. It was actually made in the last 24 hours, with only Biden's family and a small circle of close aides knowing of his decision. And by withholding it from senior staff until the last minute - and not telling junior staff at all - the news didn't leak. It came out on Biden's terms. It all fits with a man said to be frustrated at what he saw as a public pressure campaign to force his hand. Biden has spent the past four days being isolated both physically and politically. He is at the beach house in Delaware, on the Atlantic Ocean as he recovers from COVID, still coughing and hoarse from the virus. First lady Jill Biden has been with him, although staying in a separate room. And, it has been from there the president has watched Democrat after Democrat call for his exit even as he spent the past three weeks trying to reassure the party he was mentally and physically up to a second term. But, despite everything he's done - national TV interviews, local radio interviews, a press conference, and campaign stops - nothing had quelled the tide against him. Joe Biden endorsed Kamala Harris Hunter Biden, Melissa Cohen, Joe Biden and Jill Biden in July - his family has stood by him In the aftermath of the decision, Biden's family was loud and clear in their love and support, praising him for his service to the country. Jill Biden sent him her love on Sunday afternoon, retweeting his letter with two red hearts. Naomi Biden, the Bidens' eldest granddaughter, wrote a long post on X, where she said she was 'proud' of her 'pop,' which is what the grandchildren call President Biden. She noted: 'Our world is better today in so many ways thanks to him. To the Americans who have always had his back, keep the faith. He will always have ours.' And Hunter Biden said in a statement of his father: 'He is unique in public life today, in that there is no distance between Joe Biden the man and Joe Biden the public servant of the last 54 years. I'm so lucky every night I get to tell him I love him, and to thank him. I ask all Americans to join me tonight in doing the same. Thank you, Mr. President. I love you, Dad.'

Our delegates are prepared to take seriously their responsibility in swiftly delivering a candidate to the American people.“ The comment reflected the reality that while Vice President Kamala Harris is emerging as the prohibitive favorite to become the party’s nominee — backed already by Biden and many Democrats — it’s not so simple. And for now, the party isn’t offering many details on what happens next. Harris has to formally secure the nomination from the around 4,700 Democratic convention delegates — including those pledged to Biden, as well as the elected officials, former presidents and other party elders known as superdelegates. She spent part of Sunday calling elected officials and delegates to solidify their support. Biden won Democratic primaries in every state, and Harris was on the ticket as his running mate. His tapping her as his successor while bowing out of the race further strengthens her case, as does the endorsements of party heavyweights like South Carolina Rep. Jim Clyburn. Many other Democratic leaders openly backed the vice president even before Biden left the race, urging him to “pass the torch” to her in the wake of his dismal debate performance against Republican nominee Donald Trump last month. “Folks will be weighing in and they should. I think we’re seeing a lot of coalescing behind the vice president,” said Rahna Epting, executive director of the progressive activist organization MoveOn. “And that’s important because, as we saw throughout the Biden debate fallout, there is momentum that can be built one way or the other, and it is important for us to build momentum toward unity.” Ken Martin, president of the Association of State Democratic Committees, which represents the 57 parties in the states and territories, said Harris was the obvious choice: “Having served alongside President Biden, she is ready on day one as a candidate and as our next president.” She was also endorsed by the executive council of the 1.75-million-member American Federation of Teachers union. But Democratic rules state only that delegates “in all good conscience” vote for the candidate they were elected to represent, with no mechanism for defectors. And some in the party have endorsed an open nominating process. There’s been active debate about how to proceed among lawmakers, major donors and former high-ranking officials of the Biden, Obama and Clinton administrations, a Democrat with deep ties to the Biden administration, said Sunday. The person, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal conversations, argued that Harris would benefit from a competitive mini-primary ahead of the Democratic convention, because it would help her seal her bonafides as a strong candidate and diminish criticism that she’s been undemocratically anointed. That’s a charge the Trump campaign has already sought to use against her, and could loom large in the battle for undecided voters in battleground states. But such a scenario might leave Democrats heading into their national convention without a clear nominee, and perhaps choosing one via a series of floor votes. That could mean top Democratic candidates looking to replace Biden resorting to visiting individual state delegations to lobby — a process unseen since 1960, when Johnson and John F. Kennedy jockeyed for support during that year’s Democratic convention in Los Angeles. If that happened, in addition to Harris, many other leading Democrats who had endorsed Biden in 2024 while harboring their own presidential aspirations for future cycles could vie for the nomination, including California Gov. Gavin Newsom, Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro and California Rep. Ro Khanna. Inside the White House, however, there’s low expectation that Harris will get a serious challenge, according to a person familiar with deliberations who requested anonymity to discuss the private conversations. Whitmer has already said she won’t run, and Newsom has said he would back Harris if she became the nominee. Others who have been mentioned as viable contenders — including Shapiro and North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper — have both endorsed Harris and would also seem unlikely to run in light of Biden’s endorsement of the vice president, and the expected fundraising advantage she would hold over anyone who’d enter the field. Further complicating matters is the fact that the DNC had planned to hold a virtual roll call to choose its nominee ahead of the convention, in order to meet Ohio ballot eligibility rules. That state’s original deadline ballot deadline was Aug. 7, and though the Legislature has since approved a law nullifying that, it doesn’t take effect until Sept. 1. DNC lawyers say that means the party could face legal challenges in Ohio if it fails to name their party’s nominee prior to the state’s original deadline. But the convention rules committee has said it won’t set a date for the virtual roll call — which could take place over several days — before Aug. 1. Some Democrats fear a host of other GOP legal challenges, including New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, who had defended Biden staying in the race by arguing that replacing him might trigger “a presidential election being decided by Clarence Thomas and the Supreme Court” — like what happened during the 2000 presidential election and the disputed recount in Florida. At this week’s conventions rules committee meeting, members could establish virtual roll call rules and a process to nominate Harris. But they could also create a more open process for choosing a nominee, according to a person familiar with the process on condition of anonymity to discuss internal deliberations. Harrison refrained from endorsing Harris in a statement, saying only, “In short order, the American people will hear from the Democratic Party on next steps and the path forward for the nomination process.” A somber Harrison also joined a virtual meeting of the convention credentials committee on Sunday, telling members, “I’m emotional.” “I still support my president,” Harrison said of Biden. “And we will get through this, my friends, as we always do.” ___ Associated Press writer Colleen Long contributed to this report.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nWASHINGTON – Shortly after President Joe Biden announced Sunday that he would&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Democrats assure a smooth transition to replace Biden, leaning towards Harris but uncertainties persist. first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/local-news/democrats-assure-a-smooth-transition-to-replace-biden-leaning-towards-harris-but-uncertainties-persist/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/rewrite-this-title-Democrats-promise-039orderly-process039-to-replace-Biden.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-07-22 00:02:45","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.029},{"id":252300632,"title":"What A Kamala Harris Foreign Policy Could Look Like","text":"Vice President Kamala Harris is expected to stick largely to Joe Biden's foreign policy playbook on key issues such as Ukraine, China and Iran but could strike a tougher tone with Israel over the Gaza war if she replaces the president at the top of the Democratic ticket and wins the U.S. November election. As the apparent frontrunner for the nomination after Biden dropped out of the race and endorsed her on Sunday, Harris would bring on-the-job experience, personal ties forged with world leaders, and a sense of global affairs gained during a Senate term and as Biden's second-in-command. But running against Republican candidate Donald Trump she would also have a major vulnerability - a troubled situation at the U.S.-Mexico border that has bedeviled Biden and become a top campaign issue. Harris was tasked at the start of his term with addressing the root causes of high irregular migration, and Republicans have sought to make her the face of the problem. On a range of global priorities, said analysts, a Harris presidency would resemble a second Biden administration. \"She may be a more energetic player but one thing you shouldn't expect - any immediate big shifts in the substance of Biden's foreign policy,\" said Aaron David Miller, a former Middle East negotiator for Democratic and Republican administrations. Harris has signaled, for instance, that she would not deviate from Biden's staunch support for NATO and would continue backing Ukraine in its fight against Russia. That stands in sharp contrast to a pledge by former president Trump to fundamentally alter the U.S. relationship with the alliance and the doubts he has raised about future weapons supplies to Kyiv. Staying On The Course On China? A lawyer by training and a former California attorney general, Harris struggled in the first half of Biden's term to find her footing, not helped by being saddled early on with a major part of the intractable immigration portfolio amid record crossings at the U.S.-Mexico border. That followed a failed 2020 presidential campaign that was widely considered lackluster. If she becomes the nominee, Democrats will be hoping Harris will be more effective at communicating her foreign policy goals. In the second half of Biden's presidency, Harris - the country's first Black and Asian American vice president - has elevated her profile on issues ranging from China and Russia to Gaza and become a known quantity to many world leaders. At this year's Munich Security Conference she delivered a tough speech slamming Russia for its invasion of Ukraine and pledging \"ironclad\" U.S. respect for NATO's Article 5 requirement for mutual self-defense. On China, Harris has long positioned herself within Washington's bipartisan mainstream on the need for the U.S. to counter China's influence, especially in Asia. She would likely maintain Biden's stance of confronting Beijing when necessary while also seeking areas of cooperation, analysts say. Harris has made several trips aimed at boosting relations in the economically dynamic region, including one to Jakarta in September to fill in for Biden at a summit of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN). During the visit, Harris accused China of trying to coerce smaller neighbors with its territorial claims in the disputed South China Sea. Biden also dispatched Harris on travels to shore up alliances with Japan and South Korea, key allies who have had reason to worry about Trump's commitment to their security. \"She demonstrated to the region that she was enthusiastic to promote the Biden focus on the Indo-Pacific,\" said Murray Hiebert, a senior associate of the Southeast Asia Program at Washington's Center for Strategic and International Studies. While she could not match the \"diplomatic chops\" Biden had developed over decades, \"she did fine,\" he added. However, like her boss, Harris has been prone to the occasional verbal gaffe. On a tour of the Demilitarized Zone between South and North Korea in September 2022 to reassert Washington's support for Seoul, she mistakenly touted a U.S. \"alliance with the Republic of North Korea,\" which aides later corrected. If Harris becomes her party's standard-bearer and can overcome Trump's lead in pre-election opinion polls to win the White House, the Israel-Palestinian conflict would rank high on her agenda, especially if the Gaza war is still raging. Although as vice president she has mostly echoed Biden in firmly backing Israel's right to defend itself after Hamas carried out a deadly cross-border raid on Oct. 7, she has at times stepped out slightly ahead of the president in criticizing Israel's military approach. In March, she bluntly criticized Israel, saying it was not doing enough to ease a \"humanitarian catastrophe\" during its ground offensive in the Palestinian enclave. Later that month, she did not rule out \"consequences\" for Israel if it launched a full-scale invasion of refugee-packed Rafah in southern Gaza. Such language has raised the possibility that Harris, as president, might take at least a stronger rhetorical line with Israel than Biden, analysts say. While her 81-year-old boss has a long history with a succession of Israeli leaders and has even called himself a \"Zionist,\" Harris, 59, lacks his visceral personal connection to the country. She maintains closer ties to Democratic progressives, some of whom have pressed Biden to attach conditions to U.S. weapons shipments to Israel out of concern for high Palestinian civilian casualties in the Gaza conflict. But analysts do not expect there would be a big shift in U.S. policy toward Israel, Washington's closest ally in the Middle East. Halie Soifer, who served as national security adviser to Harris during the then-senator's first two years in Congress, from 2017 to 2018, said Harris' support of Israel has been just as strong as Biden's. \"There really has been no daylight to be found\" between the two, she said. Iran Nuclear Threat Harris could also be expected to hold firm against Israel's regional arch-foe, Iran, whose recent nuclear advances have drawn increased U.S. condemnation. Jonathan Panikoff, formerly the U.S. government's deputy national intelligence officer for the Middle East, said the growing threat of \"weaponization\" of Iran's nuclear program could be an early major challenge for a Harris administration, especially if Tehran decides to test the new U.S. leader. After a series of failed attempts, Biden has shown little interest in returning to negotiations with Tehran over resuming the 2015 international nuclear agreement, which Trump abandoned during his presidency.

Some users suggested the Kamala Harris memes/edits on social media have made her more appealing to young voters. The “It’s Joever” meme appears to have made a sensational return. The phrase signals complete physical and mental defeat, sheer hopelessness. Suggesting it’s not just over—it’s “Joever.” In 2020, an anonymous user mocking the electoral hopes of progressives posted a “prediction” that Joe Biden would lose, posting the very first “It’s Joever,” along with a picture of a sad-looking Biden, standing at a podium. Several X users shared throwbacks to Kamala's 2019 campaign and urged 'bring this tone back for 2024 please'. We take a look at some of today's Twitter memes - from fake mock ups of Kamala's future Time Magazine cover to the bizarre reason people were using ice cream to mock Joe Biden: The irony of the announcement landing on National Ice Cream Day was certainly not lost on the internet, one X user wrote: \"Possibly the most historic national ice cream day we've ever had.\" Even Elon Musk commented on the timing of Biden's announcement coinciding with the national day after branding X a \"meme goldmine\". Kamala Harris, 59, holds a lead over several other potential Democratic candidates. She was part of a successful presidential ticket with Biden, has built years of goodwill with key party demographics, and would likely have access to a significant campaign fund amassed by the Biden reelection effort.

U.S. Sen. Elizabeth Warren said that she will join the President in endorsing Vice President Kamala Harris’ run for the party nomination they all sought in 2020, after giving the 46th President credit for the work he’s done over the last three years and for beating former president Donald Trump in the first place. “(Harris) is a proven fighter who has been a national leader in safeguarding consumers and protecting access to abortion. As a former prosecutor, she can press a forceful case against allowing Donald Trump to regain the White House. We have many talented people in our party, but Vice President Harris is the person who was chosen by the voters to succeed Joe Biden if needed. She can unite our party, take on Donald Trump, and win in November,” Warren said. Massachusetts Gov. Maura Healey, long seen as a Biden campaign surrogate, thanked the President for his lifetime of service and his work in turning the economy around. “President Biden’s decision today not to seek reelection is the ultimate example of putting the country first — something Joe Biden has done over and over again in his unparalleled career. We are all deeply grateful to President Biden for his lifetime of service,” she said. U.S. Rep. Katherine Clark, the House Minority Whip, said Biden’s decision tells of his “steadfast courage” and love of country. “Around the globe, he is admired for his steady, experienced leadership — always honoring America’s crucial role as a facilitator of peace, democracy, and human rights,” she said in a statement. Salem’s U.S. Rep. Seth Moulton said via social media that he’s “proud of our president, who will go down in history as a great statesman.” “Proud to endorse our vice president, who has the energy, courage, and vision to beat Donald Trump. Now let’s come together and get to work,” he said. Joe Biden “saved our Democracy in 2020,” according to U.S. Rep. Lori Trahan, and he’s taking the right step to do the same again now. “President Biden’s decision to pass the baton positions us to defeat Donald Trump again this November and build on the work we’ve done. Together with our strong, proven Vice President Kamala Harris, Democrats will make a clear, effective case to voters why our commitment to improving the lives of every American is the better choice than Donald Trump’s chaotic and extreme Republican Party,” she said. U.S. Rep. Ayana Pressley said of Harris that she’s “all in, let’s go.” Massachusetts Senate President Karen Spilka said Biden’s decision demonstrates what “true leadership looks like.” Boston Mayor Michelle Wu said Harris is “the leader we need to meet this moment.” “Democrats will win in November, and I will do all I can to help. I’m excited to organize and vote for Vice president Harris,” she said. “One of the most consequential presidents of my lifetime just put his country before himself, as he always has. Unity matters now more than ever before – it’s time for Democrats to come together behind Vice President Harris to defeat Donald Trump,” she said. MassGOP Chairwoman Amy Carnevale said that decision to back Harris won’t help Democrats in November. “No matter the nominee, Americans now see through the Democratic Party. From the economy to border security, Democrats have fallen short. Americans want a shift, and we’re confident that no Democrat will measure up to the Republican ticket,” she said.","summary":"\"We have many talented people in our party, but Vice President Harris is the person who was chosen by the voters to succeed Joe Biden if needed.

Vice President Kamala Harris, who Biden endorsed as his replacement on the ballot, is 59. Robert F. Kennedy Jr., 70, is also running a long shot campaign as an independent.Concerns about the president's age were heightened after Biden's poor performance in the first presidential debate in June, during which he appeared frail and struggled to deliver coherent answers. After weeks of Democratic lawmakers and donors calling for Biden to drop out of the race, he announced that he would not run for reelection and endorsed his running mate.Though Harris still needs to secure her party's nomination, she is 22 years younger than Biden and 19 years younger than Trump. While Biden's age was his biggest liability, Harris' relative youthfulness could prove advantageous on the campaign trail, allowing Democrats to flip the script on arguments that Biden was too old to lead and leverage them against Trump.Harris' candidacy also marks a significant departure from the gerontocracy that has long dominated American politics.

With efforts ongoing to bring about a cease-fire between Israel and Hamas, rising concerns about the war spreading to Lebanon and Yemen, and the U.S. in the midst of a dizzying election campaign, Netanyahu’s speech has the potential to cause disarray on both sides of the ocean. The risks only increased with Biden’s decision Sunday to drop out of the race for president, especially since the choice of a replacement Democratic nominee — and the potential next American leader — are still up in the air. A person familiar with Biden’s schedule confirmed Sunday that the president will host Netanyahu at the White House. The official, speaking on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to comment publicly, said the exact timing of the meeting has not been established because Biden is recovering from COVID-19. Netanyahu is scheduled to address Congress on Wednesday. He is also expected to meet with Vice President Kamala Harris, who is seeking the Democratic Party’s presidential nomination. An official in Netanyahu’s office confirmed that the Israeli leader was set to travel to Washington on Monday. The official also spoke on condition of anonymity pending a formal announcement. Netanyahu will deliver his congressional address with an eye on several audiences: his ultranationalist governing partners, the key to his political survival; the Biden administration, which Netanyahu counts on for diplomatic and military support; and Donald Trump’s Republican Party, which could offer Netanyahu a reset in relations if he is reelected in November. His words risk angering any one of those constituencies, which the Israeli leader cannot afford if he hopes to hold on to his tenuous grip on power. “There are a few land mines and pitfalls on this trip,” Eytan Gilboa, an expert on U.S.-Israel relations at Israel’s Bar-Ilan University, said before Biden’s withdrawal. “He is thought of as a political wizard who knows how to escape from traps. I am not sure he still knows how to do that.” It is Netanyahu’s fourth speech to Congress — more than any other world leader. During his address, his far-right governing partners will want to hear his resolve to continue the war and topple Hamas. The Biden administration will look for progress toward the latest U.S.-backed cease-fire proposal and details on a postwar vision. Republicans hope Netanyahu besmirches Biden and bolsters the GOP’s hoped-for perception as Israel’s stalwart supporter. Upon receiving the invitation, Netanyahu said he would “present the truth about our just war against those who seek to destroy us.” The war, which was sparked by Hamas’ Oct. 7 attack on southern Israel, has tested Israel’s ties with its top ally as never before. The Biden administration has stood staunchly beside Israel. But it has grown increasingly alarmed about the conduct of the Israeli military, the continued difficulties of getting humanitarian aid into Gaza, especially after the short-lived U.S. military pier off Gaza coast, as well as Israel’s lack of postwar plans and the harm to civilians in Gaza. Similar concerns will likely persist if Americans elect a new Democratic president. Biden earlier this year froze the delivery of certain bombs over fears they would be used in Israel’s incursion into the southern Gaza city of Rafah, which at the time sheltered more than half of Gaza’s population of 2.3 million. The U.S. abstained from a United Nations Security Council vote in March that called for a cease-fire and the release of hostages but did not link the two. Netanyahu called the decision a “retreat” from a “principled position” by Israel’s ally. Biden has had to walk a fine line of his own. He has faced harsh criticism from progressive Democrats and many Arab Americans. Even Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, the highest-ranking elected U.S. Jewish official, lambasted Netanyahu in March for his handling of the war. Some Democrats will likely demonstrate their anger toward Biden and Netanyahu by skipping Wednesday’s speech. Netanyahu is also likely to be hounded by pro-Palestinian activists during his trip. The last time Netanyahu spoke to Congress in 2015 was at the invitation of the Republican Party. The trip drove Israeli-American politics deep into the partisan divide as Netanyahu railed against then-President Barack Obama’s Iran nuclear deal. Netanyahu has not shied away from making Israel a partisan issue. With his nationalist conservative ideology, he has been perceived as throwing his support behind Republican candidates in the past, rankling Democrats and Israelis who want to keep the U.S.-Israel relationship bipartisan. It’s unclear if he will meet Trump. If there is a meeting, it could expose Netanyahu to accusations that he is once again taking sides. But if he doesn’t meet with Trump, the former president could feel slighted. The speech also offers Netanyahu opportunity. He will be able to show Israelis that despite the tensions with the Biden administration, U.S. support for him remains ironclad. “He wants the Israeli public to believe that he is very much still very welcome in the United States. And this shows that the American people are with him,” said David Makovsky, director of the program on Arab-Israel Relations at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy. For critics of Netanyahu, that embrace is unacceptable and grants legitimacy to a deeply polarizing leader whose public support has plummeted. Netanyahu faces widespread protests and calls to resign over the failures of Oct. 7 and his handling of the war. In a letter to Congress, 500 Israeli writers, scholars and public figures expressed their dismay over the invitation to Netanyahu, saying he will use the platform to advance misguided policies that align with his far-right governing partners. “His only interest is preserving his own power,” they wrote. “Does the United States Congress wish to support such a model of cynical and manipulative leadership in these times?” Israeli media reported that Netanyahu will be joined by rescued hostage Noa Argamani and her father. But for many of the families of hostages held in Gaza, the trip is an affront. “This is not the time for trips,” Ayelet Levy Shachar, whose daughter Naama was kidnapped on Oct. 7, told reporters. “Netanyahu: First a deal, then you can travel.” Copyright 2024 The Associated Press.

There is no middle ground.” On Sunday afternoon, Biden formally announced that he was jumping out of the 2024 presidential race, prompting more Republicans to jump on the bandwagon in questioning his fitness to remain in office. House Speaker Mike Johnson claimed in a statement that “if Joe Biden is not fit to run for President, he is not fit to serve as President.” “He must resign the office immediately. November 5 cannot arrive soon enough,” he charged. Montana Senator Steve Daines said he was “formally calling” on Biden to resign, insisting that if he’s “no longer capable of running for reelection, he is no longer capable of serving as President.” And GOP Rep. Nancy Mace of South Carolina posted, “If Joe Biden does not have the cognitive ability to seek reelection, he does not have the cognitive ability to serve the remainder of his term. Tomorrow I will introduce a resolution calling on Kamala Harris to invoke the 25th amendment and assume the duties of acting President.” Meanwhile, former Democratic congresswoman Tulsi Gabbard, who has since shifted her allegiance to the GOP, contended that Machiavellian forces forced Biden’s decision, claiming, spuriously, on X that Vice President Kamala Harris “is the new figurehead for the deep state and the maidservant of Hillary Clinton, queen of the cabal of warmongers. They will continue their efforts to engulf the world in war and taking away our liberty.” To be sure, Biden didn’t drop out because he copped to being unfit, but, rather, he dropped out in the face of pressure from his own party, which did not believe the 81-year-old president had the public support to beat Trump in November. The internal backlash against a Biden re-election run gained steam after the commander-in-chief’s disastrous debate performance against Trump, the twice-impeached former president who has since been convicted by a New York jury on 34 counts of falsifying business records, been found civilly liable for rape by a second set of Big Apple jurors, and is still facing multiple federal and state charges—although a recent Supreme Court decision has temporarily thrown a wrench into the works—over allegations involving his attempt to overturn the results of the 2020 election. Following an assassination attempt last weekend which led to reports that Trump might soften his tone after a near-death experience, the ex-POTUS took to Truth Social to take a series of ugly swipes at Biden, calling him “crooked” and claiming he “was not fit to run for President, and is certainly not fit to serve — And never was!” “We will suffer greatly because of his presidency, but we will remedy the damage he has done very quickly,” Trump wrote. “MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!” In response to the news that Biden had stepped aside and endorsed Harris, Trump’s most rabid fans quickly flooded the internet on Sunday to express their concurring opinions. A credulous Elon Musk—who recently pledged $45 million a month to get the 45th president reinstalled as the 47th—began posting and reposting on X. “My smartest friends, including those living in the San Francisco Bay Area who have been lifelong Dems, are excited about Trump/Vance,” Musk wrote in one post, without naming names. Conspiracy theorist Laura Loomer jumped into the fray, floating the absurd notion that Trump’s recent shooting, which bloodied his ear but did not do any significant damage, was a plot by anti-Trumpers in positions of power. “And just like that, the media stopped talking about the Trump assassination attempt,” Loomer posted on X. “Do you not see what is happening? This is all planned to cover up the Deep State’s plot to kill Trump under Biden. We need accountability. We can talk about the Dysfunctional Democrat party later.” Others piled on, feigning outrage about Harris’ record while continuing to take disingenuous shots at Biden. Donald Trump Jr., the ex-president’s adult son, posted, “Kamala Harris owns the entire leftwing policy record of Joe Biden. The only difference is that she is even more liberal and less competent than Joe, which is really saying something.” And Lauren Boebert, the congresswoman recently escorted out of a theater performance in her home state of Colorado, claimed, “They set Joe up before the debate even took place. They forced him to do more interviews in the past 3 weeks than he has done in 48 years in office. Locking in the narrative, Joe’s puppet strings were slashed.” Conversely, former Rep. Liz Cheney, a Republican who chaired the House committee investigating Trump’s role in the Jan. 6, 2021, coup attempt, expressed her support for Biden’s decision to put country over party. “The framers of our Constitution knew that our republic would endure only if our presidents have the character and honor to put duty ahead of self interest,” she posted on X. “President Biden deserves our gratitude for his decades of service to our nation and for his courageous decision today.”","summary":"GOP pols and others on the right floated spurious claims about  the president’s fitness to remain in office following his announcement on Sunday that he would step aside","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/biden-republicans-gop-kamala-harris-b2583485.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2024/07/21/21/2162011564.jpg?width=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-07-21 23:52:07","author":"Justin Rohrlich","authors":["Justin Rohrlich"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.52},{"id":252300020,"title":"Kamala Harris expresses gratitude to Joe Biden and gains increasing support in 2024 presidential campaign","text":"Vice President Kamala Harris thanked President Joe Biden for his leadership following the news Sunday that he will not continue his bid for reelection.

Watch the ABC News special, “Biden Stands Down: The Race for the White House,” tonight from 7-9 p.m. ET on ABC and ABC News Live. “His remarkable legacy of accomplishment is unmatched in modern American history, surpassing the legacy of many presidents who have served two terms in office,” she said. Harris garners wave of endorsements Biden endorsed Harris in his statement on his exiting the race, offering his “full support and endorsement” for her to be the Democratic Party’s presidential nominee. At a July 11 press conference, Biden also hinted at his belief in Harris’ ability to lead, saying at the time: “I wouldn’t have picked her unless I thought she was qualified to be president.” In a poll released July 11, asking if Harris were to replace Biden as the nominee, vote choices were 49-46%, Harris-Donald Trump, among all adults (and 49-47%, respectively, among registered voters). Harris’ 49% was slightly better than Biden’s 46%, although she doesn’t have a statistically significant lead over Trump, the poll found. Former President Bill Clinton and former presidential candidate and Secretary of State Hillary Clinton also endorsed Harris on Sunday. “We are honored to join the president in endorsing Vice President Harris and will do whatever we can to support her,” the two said in a statement on X.

His big heart and commitment to his faith and his family. And his love of our country and the American people.” Several notable figures abstain from immediately endorsing Harris Despite the wave of support from some Democratic figures, others did not immediately endorse Harris on Sunday. Former President Barack Obama did not mention Harris in his statement on Biden’s exit. Instead, he focused on his experience in the White House with Biden as his vice president: “Sixteen years ago, when I began my search for a vice president, I knew about Joe’s remarkable career in public service. But what I came to admire even more was his character — his deep empathy and hard-earned resilience; his fundamental decency and belief that everyone counts,” Obama said in a statement. Sen. Cory Booker, D-N.Y., also did not mention Harris in his statement on Biden’s exit. “I cannot overstate the gravity of the noble and history-making decision that President Biden just made. The feeling that I have right now is one of profound gratitude,” Booker said. Texas Rep. Lloyd Doggett, who was the first House Democrat to call on Biden to step aside in the presidential race, back on July 2, applauded Biden’s decision but put the breaks on endorsing Harris. “Once again President Biden comes through for America, putting country over ego in a way that Donald Trump never could,” Doggett said, in part. He added, “While, with President Biden’s endorsement, Vice President Harris is clearly the leading candidate, we should be open to all talented individuals who wish to be considered.” Some donors express excitement Some Democratic donors who previously planned to withhold their campaign contributions told ABC News on Sunday that they are now excited to coalesce their support around Vice President Harris, even if she was not their first pick to replace Joe Biden at the top of the ticket “I don’t think that having some kind of bitter inner party fight over the nomination is going to help. If Biden is endorsing Harris, then I think that basically decides it,” said one donor who initially pledged to contribute more than $1.8 million to Biden before withholding their contribution over concerns about Biden’s viability as the nominee. Reacting to Biden’s decision to drop out of the race and endorse Harris, that same donor said they now plan to resume their pledged contribution to Harris. “I just texted Rufus Gifford,” the donor said, referring to the Biden-Harris campaign finance chair. “I told him I’m all in.” Another donor — who originally said that she planned to withhold her contribution and preferred an open convention — told ABC News that she now fully supports Harris following Biden’s withdrawal and endorsement. “I am convinced that 100% of us will get behind her,” said the donor, who previously held a fundraiser for Biden in her home. “Some people are getting their funds transfer information organized as we speak.” Some of the donors who spoke with ABC News were not enthusiastic about Harris compared to other Democratic politicians — including California Gov. Gavin Newsom and Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer — but described Harris as the inevitable nominee. “I can’t see how any other serious candidate could come out at this point and say, I’m running for the nomination against Harris,” another Democratic donor said.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nVice President Kamala Harris thanked President Joe Biden for his leadership following&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Kamala Harris expresses gratitude to Joe Biden and gains increasing support in 2024 presidential campaign first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/news/us/kamala-harris-expresses-gratitude-to-joe-biden-and-gains-increasing-support-in-2024-presidential-campaign/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/ic_launcher.png","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-07-21 23:51:42","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.318},{"id":252299942,"title":"Trump plan to nix taxes on tips concretely shows he’s pro-working class","text":"Donald Trump’s vow to stopping taxing tips is a modest but incredibly concrete step to showing what Trumponomics really means.

It help workers — not with handouts, but by letting them keep more of what they earn, and by making it a lot easier to fill out their 1040s. Plus, this reform will start helping the day it takes effect The plan’s inspiration is telling, too: He got the idea from a waitress who drew his attention to the amount of her income that she had to fork over to the government. Trump is proving he actually listens to regular people — and is determined to improve their lives, not just talk about it. And it’s a big deal for those who work in service industry (sometimes making as little as $2 in base hourly pay) and survive on tips. It will cost the government an estimated $150 billion to $250 billion over 10 years (assuming no supply-side effects), a miniscule share of the overall budget (but all the more reason for Trump to also rein in spending). When Trump signed the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act in 2017, liberals wailed that he was giving a break to the already-rich (a smear disproven by IRS data that show the middle class benefitted hugely). Democrats have no way for to spin a break exclusively for hospitality workers as a gift to the wealthy. Indeed, unions want Dems to outlaw tipping entirely, so make in easier to “organize” service workers. Lower-income Americans have been hit hardest by Bidenflaton: Credit-card debt is at an all-time high and still climbing, as workers struggle to make ends meet with their paychecks alone. Trump understands that workers should be taking more of those paychecks home.

Grassroots voters will hope to be better served than they were during the initial nomination race, when Democrats put up no serious competition to the 81-year-old president's candidacy despite worries over his age. \"Remarkable leadership shown by Joe Biden. Now it falls to the (Democrats) to show equal leadership by having an open process to determine the best candidate(s) to take on Trump-Vance in November,\" said entrepreneur Andrew Yang, who ran against Biden for the party's nomination in 2020. \"The goal should be simple -- to win,\" he wrote on X. With Biden's endorsement, Vice President Kamala Harris, 59, starts out in the strongest position to replace him and may be able to consolidate support in the coming days -- a coronation that would allow Democrats to turn their fire on Trump. If that doesn't happen then a chaotic -- and potentially damaging -- fight for the votes of almost 4,000 delegates at the Democratic National Convention in Chicago in just four weeks looks more likely. The party's national chairman Jaime Harrison promised a \"transparent and orderly process\" to replace Biden, the first president since Democrat Lyndon B. Johnson in 1968 not to seek a second term. Kamala the prosecutor His campaign began collapsing after his dismal debate performance against Trump last month prompted concerns over his advanced years and mental capacity. Trump, who would be 82 at the end of a second term, appeared more robust -- but opposition from a younger candidate would turn the spotlight on his speeches and interviews, where he often appears incoherent and confuses names. Several rising Democratic stars -- all younger than 60 -- have been floated as Biden alternatives, including governors Josh Shapiro, Gretchen Whitmer and Gavin Newsom. Whitmer immediately appeared to suggest she would not be running and Newsom has previously said he would not challenge Harris, but neither explicitly ruled themselves out. A campaign led by Harris and backed up by a moderate midwestern running mate could present the best chance for Democrats -- helping turn out more women, who historically vote in greater numbers than men and are a weakness for Trump. Harris would also give Democrats a chance to redefine the race at their convention as a clash of cultures between a former prosecutor and a convicted felon. \"While she has largely been in the shadows for the last four years it is time for Kamala the prosecutor... to make her comeback,\" said Sara Sadhwani, an assistant professor of politics at Pomona College in Claremont, California. A new survey from Democratic polling firm Public Policy Polling released Thursday found that Harris -- with the right running mate -- could defeat Trump and Vance in Pennsylvania and Michigan, two of the three \"Blue Wall\" states seen as critical to electing a Democratic president. Clean break? Ryan Waite, a political marketing expert from Brigham Young University-Idaho, told AFP a contested nomination might actually benefit Democrats by depriving Trump of headlines for several months. \"A new Democrat candidate will benefit from a short vetting window and significant earned media impact right before the election,\" he told AFP. \"The story is now who will it be and that will take the air out of the room through their convention.\" Any new nominee other than Harris would represent a clean break and be immune from much of the criticism directed at the Biden administration over high inflation, the border crisis and the chaotic withdrawal from Afghanistan. But while Harris would likely inherit all of the Biden campaign's cash reserves -- about $94 million as of July -- other candidates may have to share the money with down-ballot candidates. They would also have to make the case anew for endorsements from some of the Biden-Harris campaign's most influential backers, such as the United Auto Workers union. Harris herself could also face this problem, of course. Republicans have suggested that they might challenge any late substitutions in the courts but Marc Elias, the Democrats' top election lawyer vowed that the eventual nominee would be on all 50 state ballots. \"There is no basis for any legal challenge. Period,\" he said.

Our delegates are prepared to take seriously their responsibility in swiftly delivering a candidate to the American people.“ The comment reflected the reality that while Vice President Kamala Harris is emerging as the prohibitive favorite to become the party’s nominee — backed already by Biden and many Democrats — it’s not so simple. And for now, the party isn’t offering many details on what happens next. Harris has to formally secure the nomination from the around 4,700 Democratic convention delegates — including those pledged to Biden, as well as the elected officials, former presidents and other party elders known as superdelegates. She spent part of Sunday calling elected officials and delegates to solidify their support. Biden won Democratic primaries in every state, and Harris was on the ticket as his running mate. His tapping her as his successor while bowing out of the race further strengthens her case, as does the endorsements of party heavyweights like South Carolina Rep. Jim Clyburn. Many other Democratic leaders openly backed the vice president even before Biden left the race, urging him to “pass the torch” to her in the wake of his dismal debate performance against Republican nominee Donald Trump last month. “Folks will be weighing in and they should. I think we’re seeing a lot of coalescing behind the vice president,” said Rahna Epting, executive director of the progressive activist organization MoveOn. “And that’s important because, as we saw throughout the Biden debate fallout, there is momentum that can be built one way or the other, and it is important for us to build momentum toward unity.” Ken Martin, president of the Association of State Democratic Committees, which represents the 57 parties in the states and territories, said Harris was the obvious choice: “Having served alongside President Biden, she is ready on day one as a candidate and as our next president.” She was also endorsed by the executive council of the 1.75-million-member American Federation of Teachers union. But Democratic rules state only that delegates “in all good conscience” vote for the candidate they were elected to represent, with no mechanism for defectors. And some in the party have endorsed an open nominating process. There’s been active debate about how to proceed among lawmakers, major donors and former high-ranking officials of the Biden, Obama and Clinton administrations, a Democrat with deep ties to the Biden administration, said Sunday. The person, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal conversations, argued that Harris would benefit from a competitive mini-primary ahead of the Democratic convention, because it would help her seal her bonafides as a strong candidate and diminish criticism that she’s been undemocratically anointed. That’s a charge the Trump campaign has already sought to use against her, and could loom large in the battle for undecided voters in battleground states. But such a scenario might leave Democrats heading into their national convention without a clear nominee, and perhaps choosing one via a series of floor votes. That could mean top Democratic candidates looking to replace Biden resorting to visiting individual state delegations to lobby — a process unseen since 1960, when Johnson and John F. Kennedy jockeyed for support during that year’s Democratic convention in Los Angeles. If that happened, in addition to Harris, many other leading Democrats who had endorsed Biden in 2024 while harboring their own presidential aspirations for future cycles could vie for the nomination, including California Gov. Gavin Newsom, Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro and California Rep. Ro Khanna. Inside the White House, however, there’s low expectation that Harris will get a serious challenge, according to a person familiar with deliberations who requested anonymity to discuss the private conversations. Whitmer has already said she won’t run, and Newsom has said he would back Harris if she became the nominee. Others who have been mentioned as viable contenders — including Shapiro and North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper — have both endorsed Harris and would also seem unlikely to run in light of Biden’s endorsement of the vice president, and the expected fundraising advantage she would hold over anyone who’d enter the field. Further complicating matters is the fact that the DNC had planned to hold a virtual roll call to choose its nominee ahead of the convention, in order to meet Ohio ballot eligibility rules. That state’s original deadline ballot deadline was Aug. 7, and though the Legislature has since approved a law nullifying that, it doesn’t take effect until Sept. 1. DNC lawyers say that means the party could face legal challenges in Ohio if it fails to name their party’s nominee prior to the state’s original deadline. But the convention rules committee has said it won’t set a date for the virtual roll call — which could take place over several days — before Aug. 1. Some Democrats fear a host of other GOP legal challenges, including New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, who had defended Biden staying in the race by arguing that replacing him might trigger “a presidential election being decided by Clarence Thomas and the Supreme Court” — like what happened during the 2000 presidential election and the disputed recount in Florida. At this week’s conventions rules committee meeting, members could establish virtual roll call rules and a process to nominate Harris. But they could also create a more open process for choosing a nominee, according to a person familiar with the process on condition of anonymity to discuss internal deliberations. Harrison refrained from endorsing Harris in a statement, saying only, “In short order, the American people will hear from the Democratic Party on next steps and the path forward for the nomination process.” A somber Harrison also joined a virtual meeting of the convention credentials committee on Sunday, telling members, “I’m emotional.” “I still support my president,” Harrison said of Biden. “And we will get through this, my friends, as we always do.” ___ Associated Press writer Colleen Long contributed to this report.

On Sunday afternoon, Biden suddenly announced he was withdrawing the presidential election after weeks of pressure from within the Democratic party. He reflected on his presidency and how he fully intended to seek reelection. \"And while it has been my intention to seek reelection, I believe it is in the best interest of my party and the country for me to stand down and focus solely on fulfilling my duties as President for the remainder of my term,\" Biden said. Shortly after in a separate post to X, Biden endorsed Harris as the Democratic nominee to replace him on the ticket come November. It didn’t take long for voters to find a connection between Harris’s shot at the White House compared to the similar career of fictional character Selena Meyer from the comedy show VEEP. VEEP, which aired on HBO from 2012 to 2019, follows Meyer – played by Julia Louis-Dreyfus – throughout Washington as she serves as the first woman vice president after a failed presidential bid. In the finale of the second season, Meyer reveals to her team that her former running mate President Stuart Hughes would no longer be running for re-election, teeing her up to be the first woman president. Fans of the show shared the clip on X, pointing out the similarities between the fictional situation and the sudden change in the Democratic ticket. “This show. It’s always this show,” one X user wrote. “Veep is a reality show .. cuz Selina Meyer IS Kamala Harris,” another said. “It is WILD how much Kamala’s journey is turning out to be like Selina’s in VEEP,” a third chimed in. Several went on to claim that VEEP appeared to be predicting the future in a fashion similar to that of The Simpsons, which is notorious for seemingly predicting future events. “This is Dems Simpsons,” one user said. “Other than the Simpsons, no show has predicted real-life events like Veep has,” another wrote. “What’s unfolded in politics the last 8 years is insane and we watched it play out on TV first. Crazy.” Despite the comparisons between Harris and Louis-Dreyfus’ character, the creators of VEEP are not fully convinced the two are similar. Earlier this month, showrunner David Mandel told Vanity Fair that there are comparisons to be made for every political candidate worldwide, not just those who happen to be women. “I understand that people all over the internet are dying to make the narrative somehow that Kamala is Selina,” Mandel said. “I personally choose not to accept it. It’s too simplistic, and I don’t think they’re doing it in a fun way. “I think they’re doing it to try and somehow make her seem less than, and I don’t enjoy it.” SEEKING NOMINATION Harris has confirmed she intends to seek the Democratic nomination for president in the coming weeks. In a statement, the vice president said she was \"honored\" to receive Biden's endorsement as he steps away from the race. “With this selfless and patriotic act, President Biden is doing what he has done throughout his life of service: putting the American people and our country above everything else,\" Harris said. “I am honored to have the President’s endorsement and my intention is to earn and win this nomination. \"Over the past year, I have traveled across the country, talking with Americans about the clear choice in this momentous election. And that is what I will continue to do in the days and weeks ahead.

Most Democrats have already united behind the vice president as the nominee, but others have also said the party needs an open convention. Barack Obama has called for an ‘open contest’ to chose Biden’s replacement, even though Harris maybe the only realistic contender A brokered convention is something the Democrats have not experienced in 70 years, and could sow chaos amid calls for all members to come together to defeat Donald Trump. Biden amassed nearly 4,000 pledged delegates committed to supporting him as millions of voters cast ballots for the incumbent president during the primaries. Biden’s seismic decision opens the door to a wild and a potentially exhausting nominating process next month at the convention with voting until a nominee is chosen by a majority of eligible voting delegates. A brokered convention is a presidential nominating convention where delegates fail to nominate a candidate on the first ballot. It means no candidate gets the votes of more than half of delegates in the first round. Once upon a time, brokered conventions happened regularly because the major parties did not hold primaries to award delegates the way they currently do. It lead to a series of complex negotiations playing out among some party power brokers, typically federal and state leaders including party officials, lawmakers and governors. The voting continues on a round of ballots until a candidate receives a majority of delegates. The last time there was a brokered convention was in 1952. In the end, Democrats were able to nominate Democrat Adlai Stevenson on the third ballot. Republican Dwight D. Eisenhower that year was just nine votes short on the first ballot, prompting some delegates to change their votes to make him the official nominee. The longest brokered convention to date took place 100 years ago in 1924 when Democrats took sixteen days and 103 ballots to nominate diplomat John Davis. It took Franklin Delano Roosevelt four ballots to secure the 1932 Democratic nomination. ‘We really don’t have any standards or benchmarks or known procedures,’ said Leonard Steinhorn, professor at American University, of what a brokered convention would look like in 2024. ‘We’re sort of walking a little bit in the wild right now,’ he said. While the terms brokered convention and contested convention are often used interchangeably, there is a key difference. A contested convention is one where the one candidate has done well but not enough to guarantee nomination on the first ballot, so another candidate tries to convince delegates to abandon the frontrunner. It has been more common in the modern era than a brokered convention, according to Elaine Kamarck from the Brookings Institute. When Biden was in the race, the convention was seen as a more of a public relations event for the party. But his decision to drop out opened the door for a process to choose someone to take the torch he passed on. Political parties have largely tried to avoid both brokered and contested conventions because history shows candidates who need multiple ballots to be nominated are less likely to win the White House. Of the sixty Democratic and Republican nominating conventions from 1868 after the Civil War through 1984, eighteen candidates were nominated on multiple ballots according to Pew. Of those, only seven were elected president, and among those, four were running against other nominees who also faced multiple ballots to receive the nomination. The last time a Democrat vigorously argued for an open convention was late Senator Ted Kennedy in 1980. The senator challenged President Jimmy Carter for the nomination. Ultimately, delegates had to stay faithful based on their state results when voting. But Carter went on to lose the election that fall to Ronald Reagan. Before that, Republican President Gerald Ford went into the 1976 convention with a clear majority of delegates but not a necessary number to lock up the nomination leading to a serious challenge from then-Governor Reagan. He ended up winning on the first ballot but went on to lose the election to Carter. ‘You want a party united behind the person who seems to be the popular choice of the members of that party, of the voters,’ Steinhorn noted. Determining the candidate at the convention would force the party and campaign to scramble to introduce the nominee to the public, raise money and hit the campaign trail before Election Day. What could benefit Democrats if they do hold a brokered convention in 2024 is their opponent is Trump. ‘This is going to be an unusual year because Donald Trump has very, very high negatives,’ said Steinhorn. While Democrats would be playing catchup for November in their messaging and ground game, there could be a key difference. ‘Because Donald Trump is so singularly unpopular as the opposing party nominee, it potentially does give the Democratic Party is small advantage,’ he added.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nPresident Joe Biden has dropped out of the presidential race and has&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Navigating an Open Convention: Potential Pitfalls for Kamala Harris and the Democrats in the 2024 Election first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/news/us/navigating-an-open-convention-potential-pitfalls-for-kamala-harris-and-the-democrats-in-the-2024-election/","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2024/07/22/00/86891119-13596809-Biden_speaking_nearly_four_years_ago_on_the_fourth_day_of_the_De-a-21_1721603227916.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-07-21 23:45:30","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.284},{"id":252299862,"title":"‘The Squad’ Is Coming Around to Kamala Harris for President","text":"Members of “The Squad” appear to be warming up to Vice President Kamala Harris as the Democratic presidential nominee, with several of the progressive lawmakers even issuing formal endorsements after President Joe Biden announced that he would not seek re-election—endorsing Harris himself on his way out the door. Rep. Cori Bush (D-MO), Rep. Ayanna Pressley (D-MA), and Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-MN) have all come out with statements endorsing Harris as “our next president” and the Democratic Party’s best chance at beating Donald Trump in November. “The people’s vote was a vote not only for President Biden, but a vote for Vice President Kamala Harris and her ability to defeat MAGA extremism across the country,” said Bush, the first Squad member to publicly endorse Harris in a statement. In Pressley’s statement, she said “it is clear that Vice President Kamala Harris is the best person to lead our party and our nation forward.” Omar tweeted a thanks to Biden for his service on X and said she was “thrilled to support [Kamala Harris] as our Democratic nominee and remain committed to working alongside her to defeat Donald Trump in November.” However, two Squad members, Rashida Tlaib of Michigan and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York, have yet to endorse Harris. It remains unclear whether they will. Ocasio-Cortez warned liberal voters in an Instagram live session Saturday that some Democrats want Biden and Harris off the ticket.

His rival was riding high at the Republican convention in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. Donald Trump had quite literally dodged a bullet. Well, almost. The bandage on his right ear was a constant reminder of how narrowly the former president had escaped death. We'd later hear from Trump's former doctor that the bullet came within a quarter of an inch of his head. That's about 6 millimetres. Joe Biden, meanwhile, just couldn't catch a break. His disastrous debate performance was deeply disappointing to his backers. To millions of Americans who tuned in that night, it was shocking. For those who've been paying attention Joe Biden's verbal stumbles and jumbled thoughts are part and parcel of his public appearances. In that sense there was some truth in the excuse he stubbornly held onto for so long that it was just \"a bad night\". When all is said and done, Biden's inner circle will have to ask themselves whether they too readily accepted that the president increasingly wasn't quite making sense and chose to shrug it off as just Joe being Joe. How the debate upended the race It was, of course, more than a bad night. It was a terrible night, which has changed the course of history. For weeks, the 81-year-old held on, offering a series of excuses for his performance: He had a cold, he was tired, he was jet-lagged, he didn't prepare properly, his staff over-scheduled him. All this, as some of the most senior party leaders began to signal that they no longer had his back. The former house speaker, party elder Nancy Pelosi, went on MSNBC to suggest the decision about whether to stand aside was Biden's to make, pointedly opening the door to him leaving after he had firmly closed it. Leaks emerged from the inner circles of Pelosi and former president Barack Obama that they had serious doubts he could win and the number of congressional Democrats openly calling on Joe Biden to stand aside started to snowball. The sight of the president gingerly making his way up the stairs of Air Force One after pulling out of campaign events in Nevada when he tested positive for COVID-19 only deepened concerns. Perhaps if he didn't fall ill, Biden would still not have pulled out of the race when he did. The split screen of a sick Joe Biden taken out of public view because of COVID while his rival strutted on stage at the Republican convention to chants of \"fight, fight, fight\" felt like the nail in Joe Biden's political coffin. He retreated to his home at his beloved Rehoboth Beach in Delaware, reportedly stewing and still insisting he was in it to win. But then it all changed and when the news came, it was shocking and surprising and yet neither of those things. Perhaps he'll take the time to write another memoir next year, detailing the backstory of this seismic moment and when exactly and how the fateful decision was made. Some will argue Biden waited too long to make the call, until he was literally forced into isolation by a virus that had defined the 2020 campaign and the start of his presidency. And yet there is an argument that he timed it just right. How the last few weeks help Harris In the weeks since the debate, there's been a slow but noticeable change in Democrats' messaging about Kamala Harris as some senior members of the party have appeared to coalesce around the idea that she might be their best chance when and if Biden dropped out. There are many arguments in favour of Harris leading the Democratic ticket. She is already essentially in training for the job, it's simpler for her to take over the campaign coffers, it avoids a messy open convention where the story is of party disunity, and it means that the Democrats are not accused of tokenism, in appointing a woman of colour as vice-president only to sideline her when she had a shot at the top job. There are signs that Kamala Harris's poll numbers are improving in the weeks since the debate Senators Elizabeth Warren and Amy Klobuchar have thrown their weight behind Harris, so too the powerful African American congressman Jim Clyburn of South Carolina. The Clintons are also all in for Harris, according to a statement the couple released soon after Joe Biden's announcement. And yet Obama has not endorsed Harris. In a statement, the former president spoke instead of \"a process from which an outstanding nominee emerges\". At this stage, Pelosi has also not thrown her considerable weight behind Harris. Unless they change their tune quickly, the inference here may be that they prefer an open convention next month, where Harris vies for the support of delegates alongside anyone else who puts their hand up. Notably, at least two of the possible contenders, Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer and California Governor Gavin Newsom, have released statements reacting to Biden's decision, but did not endorse Harris. The vice-president herself has indicated she doesn't expect to be simply handed the keys. \"My intention is to earn and win this nomination,\" she said in a statement. The next days will determine whether other candidates put their names forward. But Harris, more than three weeks on from the disastrous debate, is in a much stronger position than she was in late May. A brutal few weeks Joe Biden prides himself on being human, as understanding the concerns and ups and downs of ordinary Americans. Watching him do so badly in the debate and then not appear to realise the gravity of the moment was, for many people, painful. It reminded us of watching elderly relatives in decline. Whatever your politics, there was something truly heart-wrenching about the indignity of it all. In dragging it out, Biden may have given his vice-president the best possible chance of being the Democratic nominee and taking on Trump If she succeeds, he will have finally come good on a promise he made in 2020: to be a transitional president. That could be his greatest legacy.","summary":"Whatever your politics, there was something truly heart-wrenching about the indignity of the last few weeks.

I watched the RNC for all four days and came away very emotional (“Don like you’ve never seen him,” July 19). When Trump spoke, I felt that I wanted to cry and cheer at the same time. His opening remarks about the attempted assassination on him, it made me tear up and thank God that he is still here. The rest of the speech was about the unity of all Americans and cooperation between all sides, even if there are disagreements. It struck just the right tone to bring this nation back together. Richard Ketay Newark, NJ The Republican National Convention was inspiring, hopeful and downright patriotic. Former President Donald Trump as a leader stands head and shoulders above his blathering opponent. The message Thursday night was one of hope, for a chance to return this country to its former greatness. I am concerned, however, that Trump’s ascension, the attempted assassination and Biden’s decline have backed the Democrats into a corner of desperation. To hold on to the power they enjoy so much, they might use the nuclear option of replacing President Biden with someone like Michelle Obama. Robert Mangi Garden City The only intelligent thing Trump said Thursday night was: “I shouldn’t be here today.” Meanwhile, Hulk Hogan must have been out of work and needed some chump change for him to have given his speech. Kreg Ramone Manhattan While listening to the so-called Christian conservatives at the RNC, I couldn’t help but wonder if they’re using a different Bible. I can’t find any place in my Bible where it says, “welcome the stranger, unless they come from any of those ‘s - - t hole’ countries.” These Republicans have forgotten Exodus 20:3, “You shall have no other gods before me.” Otherwise, I don’t see how they could continue to worship a false prophet like Trump, who is the antithesis of Jesus Christ. Sharon Austry Fort Worth, Texas Trump’s rambling speech was awful and vindictive, filled with misinformation and lies. He implied the 2020 election was stolen, and then said he had the best economy in the history of the United State and the world. It was like a campaign speech. And he had a stellar group of speakers. Eric Trump was so awful that his father seemed to doze off for a short time. Then a drunk Hulk Hogan dressed perfectly for the occasion. This is the best the Republican Party can do? If Trump wins this election, it will be a sad, sad time for our country. Hank DePerro Manhattan I tuned in to the RNC to listen to Vivek Ramaswamy, Gov. Ron DeSantis and former UN Ambassador Nikki Haley (“Old foes all for Don,” July 17). But, sorry to say, Haley’s speech did not impress me. Ramaswamy and DeSantis spoke very well, and I feel they might have Cabinet positions if the Republicans win in November. On the other hand, Haley’s speech was not convincing. Perhaps losing her father recently impacted her ability to deliver. Anant Nagpur Ottawa, Canada The RNC was a total waste of time. Trump’s claims that immigrants are coming from prisons is, as PBS reports, false. As was his claim that he oversaw the best economy in the history of our country. Sometimes you’d think if Trump was perhaps intoxicated when he gives his speeches. However, that excuses him too much. Trump is simply used to lying and running his mouth without any need to realize that it’s time to start telling the truth. Trump’s speech gave the opposite of a feeling of unity. It makes me and many other Americans terrified of what is to come. Arthur Gutman Great Neck Ramaswamy, Haley and especially DeSantis gave forceful, persuasive and memorable speeches that were so well said they sometimes brought smiles to Trump’s face.

Harris quickly secured crucial endorsements from several influential congressional caucuses and Democratic lawmakers, as well as from party officials in key battleground states that Democrats can’t afford to lose to Donald Trump in November. Meanwhile, some Democratic National Committee delegates are already committing their support to Harris, who is expected to enter the party’s convention in August with a sizeable number of pledges. The president endorsed Harris for the presidency as he announced he was ending his re-election campaign on July 21. The chair of the Democratic National Committee issued a statement shortly thereafter promising a “transparent” process to select the nominee. By that afternoon, Harris’s just-launched campaign and her allies were calling prominent members of Congress and DNC delegates in an effort to secure her nomination before the convention in August. Among her first calls was to Congressional Progressive Caucus chair Pramila Jayapal, who said she is “1000% in for her to be our President.” Harris also secured endorsements from the Congressional Black Caucus and the chairs of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus and Congressional Asian Pacific American Caucus. A group of current and former DNC members also began circulating a letter that by press time had collected more than 60 signatures urging members and voters to support Harris. During an afternoon conference call, Tennessee’s 77 DNC delegates voted unanimously to endorse Harris as the party’s nominee, becoming the first DNC delegates of any state to do so. Memphis Mayor Paul Young, expected among Tennessee’s delegates at the convention, said that Biden’s decision to leave the race “shows that he is willing to continue to do what is in our best interest as a nation, and that is to allow a path for Kamala Harris to become the next president of the United States.” Wisconsin Election Commission chair Ann Jacobs, who is one of Milwaukee’s eight DNC delegates from the key swing state, also announced she is joining all of those delegates to back Harris. More than a dozen delegates from Michigan, another major electoral battleground, have also announced their support for Harris. And Georgia’s Democratic Party chair Nikema Williams said the state “stands firmly behind Vice President Harris.” Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro of Pennsylvania, widely speculated as a potential running mate, also quickly offered his support to Harris’s campaign: “I will do everything I can to help elect Kamala Harris as the 47th president of the United States.” “She has what it takes to defeat Donald Trump and lead our country thoughtfully and with integrity,” said North Carolina Governor Roy Cooper, another speculated pick for Harris’s running mate. “I look forward to campaigning for her as we work to win NC up and down the ticket.” Harris also nabbed a key endorsement from the American Federation of Teachers, the nation’s second largest teacher’s union, within hours of her candidacy. The Human Rights Campaign, the nation’s largest LGBT+ civil rights group, also has endorsed her campaign. Abortion rights groups including Emily’s List and Reproductive Freedom for All have also reportedly been reaching out to delegates to back Harris, as Harris’s campaign looks to shift significant focus towards Republican threats to abortion access in the wake of Roe v Wade’s collapse. Biden’s campaign — now “Harris for President” — and the team and campaign infrastructure are moving forward around Harris, campaign co-chair Jen O’Malley Dillon and campaign manager Julie Chavez Rodriguez told staff on Sunday. Harris will need support from at least 1,969 of the 3,936 Democratic delegates during the August convention to secure her nomination. But other party leaders, including Barack Obama and former House speaker Nancy Pelosi, have not yet endorsed a nominee in the wake of Biden’s departure, an apparent attempt to allow the nomination process to play out and allow candidates to duke it out to earn the party’s nomination rather than a coronation-like event with Harris as a foregone conclusion.","summary":"Prominnent Democratic officials and delegates in key battleground states are already lining up their support","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/kamala-harris-delegates-dnc-endorsements-b2583486.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2024/07/22/00/2162344172.jpg?width=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/TICjWMCO-4VHSaSK0.mp4","publish_date":"2024-07-21 23:35:49","author":"Alex Woodward","authors":["Alex Woodward"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.152},{"id":252299680,"title":"Biden bows out of US Prez race","text":"Washington, July 21: US President Joe Biden ended his reelection campaign on Sunday after fellow Democrats lost faith in his mental acuity and ability to beat Donald Trump, leaving the Presidential race in uncharted territory.

The unprecedented announcement, delivered less than four months before the election, immediately upended a campaign that both political parties view as the most consequential in generations. The president — intent on serving out the remainder of his term in office — quickly endorsed Vice President Kamala Harris to take on Trump and encouraged his party to unite behind her, making her the party’s instant favorite for the nomination at its August convention in Chicago. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin, nominated by Biden in late 2020, praised Biden as “an extraordinary guardian of America’s national security” in a statement Sunday. “I am deeply grateful for his leadership and statesmanship,” Austin said. “He has a secure place in American history as one of our great foreign-policy presidents.” Biden’s Sunday announcement is the latest jolt to a tumultuous campaign for the White House, coming a week after the attempted assassination of Trump at a Pennsylvania rally. A party’s presumptive presidential nominee has never stepped out of the race so close to the election. President Lyndon Johnson, besieged by the Vietnam War, announced in March 1968 that he would not seek another term after just a single state’s primary. Biden’s July decision comes after more than 14 million Democrats cast votes supporting him through the primary process. Harris, in a statement, praised Biden’s “selfless and patriotic act” and said she intends to “earn and win” her party’s nomination. “I will do everything in my power to unite the Democratic Party — and unite our nation — to defeat Donald Trump and his extreme Project 2025 agenda,” she said. Biden’s decision to bow out came after escalating pressure from his Democratic allies to step aside following the June 27 debate, in which the 81-year-old president trailed off, often gave nonsensical answers and failed to call out the former president’s many falsehoods. “It has been the greatest honor of my life to serve as your President. And while it has been my intention to seek reelection, I believe it is in the best interest of my party and the country for me to stand down and to focus solely on fulfilling my duties as President for the remainder of my term,” Biden wrote in a letter posted Sunday to his X account. Nearly 30 minutes after he delivered the news that he was folding his campaign, Biden threw his support behind Harris. “Today I want to offer my full support and endorsement for Kamala to be the nominee of our party this year,” he said in another post on X. “Democrats — it’s time to come together and beat Trump.” There were early signs that the party was moving to coalesce around Harris, who scored the endorsements of the Congressional Black Caucus and former President Bill Clinton and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton even before she had commented on Biden’s decision to quit the race. But notably, former President Barack Obama held off, pledging support behind the eventual party nominee. “We are honored to join the President in endorsing Vice President Harris and will do whatever we can to support her,” former President Bill Clinton and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said in a statement. But Obama, who had privately shared doubts about Biden’s reelection chances, stopped short of endorsing Harris even as he praised Biden for his decision to leave the race. “I have extraordinary confidence that the leaders of our party will be able to create a process from which an outstanding nominee emerges,” he said in a statement. Biden’s decision came as he has been isolating at his Delaware beach house after being diagnosed with COVID-19 last week, huddling with a shrinking circle of close confidants and family members about his political future. Biden said he would address the nation later this week to provide “detail” about his decision. Harris found out about Biden’s plans on Sunday morning and senior campaign and White House staff were notified just minutes before the letter went out, according to people familiar with the matter who commented on the private discussions on condition of anonymity. Biden had been reflecting on his future for the past couple days and the decision was closely held. Now, Democrats have to urgently try to bring coherence to the nominating process in a matter of weeks and convince voters in a stunningly short amount of time that their nominee can handle the job and beat Trump. And for his part, Trump must shift his focus to a new opponent after years of training his attention on Biden. The decision marks a swift and stunning end to Biden’s 52 years in electoral politics, as donors, lawmakers and even aides expressed to him their doubts that he could convince voters that he could plausibly handle the job for another four years. Biden won the vast majority of delegates and every nominating contest but one, which would have made his nomination a formality. Now that he has dropped out, those delegates will be free to support another candidate. Harris, 59, appeared to be the natural successor, in large part because she is the only candidate who can directly tap into the Biden campaign’s war chest, according to federal campaign finance rules. Biden’s campaign formally changed its name to Harris for President, reflecting that she is inheriting his political operation — a sign of the leg up she has in the race for the Democratic nomination. Democratic groups, including the Democratic National Committee, also filed paperwork changing the names of their joint fundraising committees to reflect Harris’ candidacy. The Democratic National Convention is scheduled to be held Aug. 19-22 in Chicago, but the party had announced it would hold a virtual roll call to formally nominate Biden before in-person proceedings begin. It remained to be seen whether other candidates would challenge Harris for the nomination. The Democratic National Committee’s chair, Jaime Harrison, said in a statement that the party would “undertake a transparent and orderly process” to select “a candidate who can defeat Donald Trump in November.” Harris was spending Sunday afternoon calling Democratic elected officials and delegates as she works to lock up the nomination. Harris received her first delegates for the Democratic presidential nomination on Sunday. The Tennessee Democratic Party posted on X that its delegation voted during a meeting Sunday to back Harris after Biden’s departure from the campaign. Trump reacted to the news in a post on his Truth Social site, in which he said Biden “was not fit to run for President, and is certainly not fit to serve.” “We will suffer greatly because of his presidency, but we will remedy the damage he has done very quickly,” he added. “MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!” While Trump and his team had made their preference for facing Biden clear, his campaign had nonetheless ramped up its attacks on Harris as pressure on Biden to step down intensified. Democratic officials, including many who were behind the effort to push Biden from the race, quickly released statements praising Biden’s decision. “His decision of course was not easy, but he once again put his country, his party, and our future first,” said Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y. “Joe, today shows you are a true patriot and great American.” House Democratic leader Hakeem Jeffries of New York praised Biden as “one of the most accomplished and consequential leaders in American history.” Republican House Speaker Mike Johnson said Biden should immediately resign if he is not fit enough to run for office. In a statement, Johnson said, “November 5 cannot arrive soon enough.” In addition to his planned address to the country, Biden still intends to host Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu at the White House this week, according to a person familiar with the president’s schedule who was not authorized to comment publicly. The exact timing of the meeting is still not set in stone as Biden continues to recover from COVID. Netanyahu is scheduled Wednesday to deliver an address to Congress and he is also expected to meet with Vice President Kamala Harris while in Washington. In 2020, Biden pitched himself as a transitional figure who wanted to be a bridge to a new generation of leaders. But once he secured the job he spent decades struggling to attain, he was reluctant to part with it. Biden was once asked whether any other Democrats could beat Trump. “Probably 50 of them,” Biden replied. “No, I’m not the only one who can defeat him, but I will defeat him.” Biden is already the country’s oldest president and had insisted repeatedly that he was up for the challenge of another campaign and another term, telling voters all they had to was “watch me.” And watch him they did. His poor debate performance prompted a cascade of anxiety from Democrats and donors who said publicly what some had said privately for months, that they did not think he was up to the job for four more years. Concerns over Biden’s age have dogged him since he announced he was running for reelection, though Trump is just three years younger at 78. Most Americans view the president as too old for a second term, according to an August 2023 poll from The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research. A majority also doubt his mental capability to be president, though that is also a weakness for Trump. Biden often remarked that he was not as young as he used to be, doesn’t walk as easily or speak as smoothly, but that he had wisdom and decades of experience, which were worth a whole lot. “I give you my word as a Biden. I would not be running again if I didn’t believe with all my heart and soul I can do this job,” he told supporters at a rally in North Carolina a day after the debate. “Because, quite frankly, the stakes are too high.” But voters had other problems with him, too — he has been deeply unpopular as a leader even as his administration steered the nation through recovery from a global pandemic, presided over a booming economy and passed major pieces of bipartisan legislation that will impact the nation for years to come. A majority of Americans disapprove of the way he’s handling his job, and he’s faced persistently low approval ratings on key issues including the economy and immigration. Biden’s motivation for running was deeply intertwined with Trump. He had retired from public service following eight years serving as vice president under Obama and the death of his son Beau but decided to run after Trump’s comments following a “Unite the Right” rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, in 2017, when white supremacists descended on the city to protest the removal of its Confederate memorials.

Chris Coons (D-DE) praised President Joe Biden’s “brave” decision to drop out of the 2024 presidential race, appearing very emotional as he spoke. Coons, the co-chairman of the Biden-Harris campaign, made his statement while praising Vice President Kamala Harris, describing her as the best candidate to continue Biden’s work. The president himself has endorsed Harris as his replacement candidate, which was given shortly after he announced he was bowing out of the 2024 race. “I admire, I respect, I love Joe Biden,” Coons said on CBS News. “I have worked my heart out for him on this campaign, and while this was a very hard decision, I deeply respect how it is a continuation of his lifetime of putting our country before himself. Joe Biden is the toughest fighter I’ve ever met.” “Every time he’s been knocked down, he’s always got up again, and the challenge of seeing this moment and of recognizing what was in the best interest of the nation was a significant challenge. I still believe he could have beaten Donald Trump, but I also know that what he has done today is in the best interest of our nation,” he added. Coons continued by stating that former President Donald Trump poses a “unique threat” against the United States. He also contended that the focus now should be on the fall 2024 campaign and preserving Biden’s presidential legacy that he claims Trump could end. Later in the interview, Coons stopped speaking as he appeared visibly upset. He ended up continuing by adding that Biden’s “very difficult decision” to not seek reelection reflects his character. Coons had been one of Biden’s most vocal supporters since the first presidential debate, which saw many people issue calls for the president to drop out of the 2024 race. After George Clooney called for Biden to bow out, Coons joked that he was “more of a Matt Damon guy.” CLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM THE WASHINGTON EXAMINER In the wake of Biden bowing out, Coons has joined Biden in endorsing Harris as the Democratic Party’s 2024 presidential nominee. Trump wrote in his own statement about the news that the June 27 debate between him and Biden was “the big moment” in Biden’s demise, as this was when voters saw him as “an incompetent man who should never have been President.” The former president officially became the Republican Party’s 2024 presidential nominee at the Republican National Convention.","summary":"Sen.

Cher wrote on X that she was “tortured” because she doesn’t believe the Democrats could win without Biden. She said it was time to think “way outside the box” and proposed a split ticket. In recent weeks, several high-profile Hollywood names had begun calling for Biden to exit the race. Just weeks after headlining a record-breaking fundraiser for the president's reelection campaign, George Clooney wrote a New York Times opinion piece calling for Biden to end his bid. Clooney argued that the party should pick a new nominee, saying the process would be “messy” but “wake up” voters in the party’s favor. Others who attended or participated in the starry fundraiser in Los Angeles included Julia Roberts, Streisand, Jimmy Kimmel, former President Barack Obama, Jack Black, Sheryl Lee Ralph, Kathryn Hahn and Jason Bateman. Ralph, on Sunday, posted a photo of herself and Harris writing “President Biden has endorsed Kamala Harris!” Here are some notable celebrity reactions: Barbra Streisand “Joe Biden will go down in history as a man who accomplished significant achievements in his 4 year term. We should be grateful for his upholding of our democracy.” — via a post on X.

Vance, Donald Trump’s running mate, released a statement on X before Biden announced his decision to withdraw from the election. “If Joe Biden ends his reelection campaign, how can he justify remaining President?” Vance questioned. “Deciding not to run for reelection would essentially confirm that President Trump’s concerns about Biden’s mental acuity were valid,” he added. “There is no middle ground.” Vance isn’t the only prominent Republican asking Biden to resign before November. House Speaker Mike Johnson also issued a lengthy statement after the 46th president announced he would not be running for re-election this November. “At this unprecedented juncture in American history, we must be clear about what just happened,” Speaker Jonhson said in his post on X. He went on to explain how the Democratic Party “forced” Biden to quit the race. “Having invalidated the votes of more than 14 million Americans who selected Joe Biden to be the Democrat nominee for president, the self-proclaimed ‘party of democracy’ has proven exactly the opposite,” he continued. Speaker Johnson said that the “party’s prospects are no better now with Vice President Kamala Harris” and insisted “she has known for as long as anyone of his incapacity to serve.” “If Joe Biden is not fit to run for President, he is not fit to serve as President. He must resign the office immediately. November 5 cannot arrive soon enough,” he concluded the statement. It comes as… Other members of the Republican Party have issued similar calls for the president to resign. Before he had even withdrawn from the race, Ohio Republican Senate candidate Bernie Moreno called on Biden to step down. “If Joe Biden is unfit to run, he is unfit to serve. I am formally calling on Joe Biden to resign the Presidency because his continued presence in the situation room is a national security threat,” he wrote in a statement on X. Kansas Senator Roger Marshall has also called for Joe to resign “right now” adding, “if he’s unfit to campaign, he should not have the nuclear codes.” President Joe Biden announced his decision to withdraw from the race just before 2pm EST on Sunday. The president reportedly told his senior team that he changed his mind about staying in the race at 1:45 pm. Shortly after his decision was announced, Biden publicly endorsed Vice President Harris to become the 2024 Democratic nominee. “Democrats – it’s time to come together and beat Trump,” Joe said in the statement. “Let’s do this.” However, some are saying that the Biden/Harris administration as a whole is the issue. Governor of Virginia, Glenn Youngkin, said: “Make no mistake, whether it’s border czar Kamala Harris or someone else, it’s the Biden/Harris Adminstration’s weak leadership and resulting chaos around the world and here at home that is on the ballot this November. “It’s time for our nation to now come together with resolve to secure our borders, structure safe communities, grow an economy that lifts up all Americans and restores peace through strength.” Republican opponent Donald Trump quickly reacted to the news of Biden’s decision, telling CNN in a phone call that Joe is “the worst president in the history of our country.” He also insisted that Kamala will “be easier to defeat.” Trump’s campaign has also been peddling the idea that Biden should resign immediately from his position as president. “While we are rightly considering the implications of the Democrats internal chaos, the real story is the implication that someone is too unhealthy to run but not too unhealthy to serve. That’s absurd,” Trump campaign spokesman, Brian Hughes, said in a statement earlier this week. Donald Trump was declared the official Republican presidential nominee on Thursday. The decision was announced at the Republican National Convention, where Trump was seen looking emotional after the votes were announced. The nomination came just days after an assassination attempt on the 45th president at a rally in Butler, Pennsylvania.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nJD Vance has questioned Joe Biden&#8217;s ability to finish his term and&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: GOP lawmakers, including JD Vance and House Speaker Mike Johnson, join the call for Joe Biden to resign due to concerns about his fitness for office first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/news/gop-lawmakers-including-jd-vance-and-house-speaker-mike-johnson-join-the-call-for-joe-biden-to-resign-due-to-concerns-about-his-fitness-for-office/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Joe-Biden-called-on-to-resign-immediately-by-JD-Vance.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-07-21 23:28:31","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.336},{"id":252299450,"title":"Biden bows to pressure, drops out of 2024 race and swiftly endorses VP Kamala Harris","text":"After almost a month of high-pressure calls for him to make way for a younger alternative, following his disastrous presidential debate performance, President Joe Biden says he will end his bid for a second term. Biden’s announcement effectively upends U.S. presidential politics with just four months to go before the general election, and it comes just weeks before Democratic National Convention starts on August 19, leaving his party very little time to anoint a successor and re-engage their efforts against a comparatively unified Republican Party and the campaign of former President Donald Trump. The 81-year-old 46th President said that he’s proud of his record, but that it has become apparent it’s time to pass the torch. “I believe it is in the best interest of my party and the country for me to stand down and to focus solely on fulfilling my duties as president for the remainder of my term,” Biden said in a statement shared to his social media accounts. In making his announcement, Biden thanked Vice President Kamala Harris for her service and later endorsed her candidacy to replace him at the top of the party ticket. “My very first decision as the party nominee in 2020 was to pick Kamala Harris as my Vice President. And it’s been the best decision I’ve made. Today I want to offer my full support and endorsement for Kamala to be the nominee of our party this year. Democrats — it’s time to come together and beat Trump. Let’s do this,” he wrote. Harris said that Biden’s decision to step aside is a “selfless and patriotic act.” “President Biden is doing what he has done throughout his life of service: putting the American people and our country above everything else. I am honored to have the President’s endorsement and my intention is to earn and win this nomination,” she said in a statement shared by their mutual campaign. Trump was quick to respond to the news, saying that Biden was never fit to hold the Oval Office in the first place. “He only attained the position of President by lies, Fake News, and not leaving his Basement. All those around him, including his Doctor and the Media, knew that he wasn’t capable of being President, and he wasn’t – And now, look what he’s done to our Country, with millions of people coming across our Border, totally unchecked and unvetted, many from prisons, mental institutions, and record numbers of terrorists. We will suffer greatly because of his presidency, but we will remedy the damage he has done very quickly,” he wrote on his Truth Social media platform, capitalization his. “Crooked Joe just got knocked out, so now I’ll have to do it a FOURTH TIME!!!” he added later. Former President Bill Clinton and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, who narrowly lost to Trump in 2016, said they are “honored to join the President in endorsing Vice President Harris and will do whatever we can to support her.” Biden’s decision to step down follows weeks of one liberal lawmaker after another coming out against his continued participation in the race. His debate performance was the start of the avalanche of calls for him to step aside, but the problem compounded following other public performances where the president did not appear as well equipped as he did even just four years ago. What precisely happens next in Democratic politics is anyone’s guess. DNC rules don’t allow Biden to just award delegates pledged to him to another candidate, not even the one sharing the ticket with him. That means Democrats will head into an open convention next month, with more than 4,000 delegates up for grabs for anyone opportunistic enough to seek them. DNC Chairman Jaime Harrison acknowledged the party now has unprecedented work to do and very little time to do it. “This process will be governed by established rules and procedures of the Party. Our delegates are prepared to take seriously their responsibility in swiftly delivering a candidate to the American people,” he wrote. Former President Barack Obama said in a statement that the party “will be navigating uncharted waters in the days ahead. “But I have extraordinary confidence that the leaders of our party will be able to create a process from which an outstanding nominee emerges,” he said. According to Trump’s campaign managers Susie Wiles and Chris LaCivita, Biden’s announcement he can’t run is the same as an admission he can’t continue holding office through January of 2025. “The question then to Kamala Harris is simple: knowing that Joe Biden withdrew from the campaign because of his rapidly deteriorating condition, does Harris believe the people of America are safe and secure with Joe Biden in the White House for six more months,” they said in a statement. One thing is for certain, according to Casey Burgat, the director of the Legislative Affairs program at the Graduate School of Political Management at George Washington University: the Democrats have just opened themselves up to a whole host of new problems. “Biden’s dropping out does raise interesting questions about whether or not the voters’ will was reflected or if party leaders and donors were the one calling the shots. Both are true, but Republicans are sure to hammer the point that the liberal elites ignored everyday voters in an attempt to change the rules of the game once it became clear they couldn’t win fairly,” he said. Republican House Speaker Mike Johnson echoed the call for Biden to resign if he is not fit enough to run for office. In a statement, Johnson said, “November 5 cannot arrive soon enough.” Johnson also on Sunday predicted that Republicans would challenge whether Democrats can legally replace Biden as the nominee after he won a run of primaries across the country. “I think they have got legal hurdles in some of these states, and it’ll be litigated, I would expect, on the ground there and they will have to sort through that. They have got a real problem,” Johnson said on CNN’s ”State of the Union.” Herald wire services contributed.","summary":"“I believe it is in the best interest of my party and the country for me to stand down and to focus solely on fulfilling my duties as president for the remainder of my term,” Biden said in a statement shared to his social media accounts.","url":"https://www.bostonherald.com/2024/07/21/biden-bows-to-pressure-drops-out-of-2024-race-and-swiftly-endorses-vp-kamala-harris/","image":"https://www.bostonherald.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/AP24040529725229_5bff6b.jpg?w=1024","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-07-21 23:28:10","author":"Matthew Medsger","authors":["Matthew Medsger"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.085},{"id":252299784,"title":"Southern California News Group commentaries on Kamala Harris’ unfortunate rise to power","text":"With President Joe Biden’s decision to withdraw from the 2024 presidential campaign and endorsement of Vice President Kamala Harris to succeed him, we present commentaries from our contributors telling it like it is. One is sure to notice a common theme: Kamala Harris is a bad politician with bad ideas and a worse record. In Orange County, Harris still is getting brickbats for her refusal to provide oversight as the county endured its snitch scandal. “The former attorney general’s efforts in Orange County were far from a profile in courage,” assistant public defender Scott Sanders told the OC Weekly recently. “Her unwillingness to stand up to dishonest law enforcement will be her lasting legacy here, and the criminal-justice system will continue to pay the price for years.” Harris also promoted policies that ramped up the power of police and prosecutors to imprison more people, including an Orwellian anti-truancy campaign that finally is getting much-deserved scorn. The left-leaning Guardian recently reported on a video of Harris at the Commonwealth Club in San Francisco in 2010, where she lightheartedly boasted about prosecuting the parents of truants and about using her “huge stick” as a prosecutor. Harris once said Tupac was the best rapper alive, decades after his death. She has often professed her love of venn diagrams, with explanations like: “It’s just something about those three circles, the analysis about where there is the intersection, right?” And she’s been repeatedly mocked for her overuse of her catchphrase: “What can be, unburdened by what has been.” Lest you feel I’m nitpicking, remember that she regularly finds herself in these moments, many of which are scripted. She comes off as insincere, especially when trying to appeal to a younger, more diverse audience. She proved even more capable than Garcetti at failing upward, from San Francisco district attorney to California attorney general to U.S. senator to somehow flipping a bombed presidential campaign into the vice presidency. As San Francisco DA, she was blasted by the courts for failing to disclose serious issues at San Francisco’s crime lab. As California attorney general, Harris made a name for herself fighting the release of Daniel Larsen, who had been exonerated by the Innocence Project. Then there was her presidential campaign. We know how that went. And yet, somehow — well, we know why — she failed up. For some reason Harris supporters think the criticism of her is unfair and people would like her if they just got to know her. But the opposite has proven to be true. The more she appears publicly and makes comments, the deeper her unfavorability plunges. While Harris seemed competent bullying witnesses in Senate hearings, her performances fell apart as soon as she wasn’t the one asking questions. During her bid for the presidential nomination, Harris portrayed herself as a “progressive prosecutor” who championed police accountability, but that’s a fanciful recasting of her record. In 13 years as a “top cop,” Harris wasn’t a reformer, but a tough-on-crime prosecutor with close links to the police unions — and someone who stayed on the sidelines in police-misconduct cases.

Harris’ RealClearPolitics average job approval rating is currently 38%, with an average of 54% of respondents giving her an unfavorable assessment. According to reporting from Reuters, Biden has been frustrated with Harris throughout his term. In fact, one former Biden administration official said Biden’s desire to run for re-election may be connected to the perception that neither Harris nor any other Democrat could beat Donald Trump in a general election. The frustrations, the former official said, are rooted in Harris’ lack of “consistently rising to the occasion.” He’s not wrong.","summary":"Kamala Harris is a bad politician with bad ideas and a worse record.","url":"https://www.ocregister.com/2024/07/21/southern-california-news-group-commentaries-on-kamala-harris-unfortunate-rise-to-power/","image":"https://www.ocregister.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/AP19264671583475.jpg?w=1024","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-07-21 23:25:59","author":"The Editorial Board","authors":["The Editorial Board"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.275},{"id":252299476,"title":"RFK Jr says this is '2-man race' after Biden drops presidential bid","text":"Independent presidential candidate Robert F.

Speaking Sunday at a hastily called press conference from his family's storied compound in Hyannis Port, Massachusetts, Kennedy praised Biden while simultaneously blaming Democratic Party leaders for \"hiding\" his mental decline. \"I want to begin by commending President Biden for a career in public service: a long, long career and representing and serving our country and for his handling of the many difficulties and challenges, personal challenges and tragedies that he suffered during his life with so much admirable conduct and the empathy that he derives from those experiences,\" Kennedy said. Kennedy, who left the party his family once ruled after it blocked his bid to challenge Biden in primaries, said the Democratic National Committee created a mess by covering for Biden. RFK JR INTERVIEW: TRUMP, BIDEN 'BOTH RAVAGED AMERICAN DEMOCRACY AND THE REPUBLIC'\"The reaction of the DNC to that obvious condition was to hide it from the American public and to use their power over the Democratic Party nomination process to make sure that nobody could compete with President Biden in a way that would expose his deficiencies,\" Kennedy argued. Kennedy continued his campaign as an independent, and he has reached double-digits in some polls on a platform that decries \"corporate capture,\" the affordability crisis, and \"forever wars,\" according to his campaign website. Kennedy also called out former President Trump as well as Vice President Harris, who appears poised to head the Democrat ticket. \"President Trump has a connection to the American people, a populist connection,\" said Kennedy. \"But in many ways, it's the same fraudulent connection that we saw with the DNC over the past year, concealing a real purpose of their objective, which was to give us a president that … represents corporate interests rather than the interests of the American public.\" WHAT COMES NEXT FOR DEMOCRATS AFTER BIDEN'S CAMPAIGN SUSPENSION? \"If the Democrats do what I suspect they're going to do, which is to anoint Kamala Harris, a vice president who is monumentally unpopular within her own party … they're doing it because it's the easiest way to hold on to the money,\" Kennedy said. Kennedy said he would consider accepting the Democrat nomination if were it offered to him. \"I would certainly listen to the party elders if they came to me, I would discuss something with them,\" said Kennedy. \"I'm the only presidential candidate who can beat Donald Trump, and if I were them, I would do that, and I would certainly listen to their proposals.\" \"I wouldn't be the front-runner, because by the time I left the Democratic Party, it was really clear that, and this is the only reason I left that day, that the rules have been rigged to prevent me from winning,\" Kennedy said. \"So, I would be in the same position as Dean Phillips today or Marianne Williamson, which is, you know, sidelined.\" Kennedy added, \"I am very content running where I am, and I believe I can win this election.

(Photo by Peter Zay/Anadolu via Getty Images) Anadolu via Getty Images Key Facts Harris said it is her “intention to earn and win this nomination” and that she will “do everything in [her] power to unite the Democratic Party” in the wake of Biden’s announcement. Biden backed Harris almost immediately after dropping his bid, offering his “full support and endorsement for Kamala to be the nominee of our party this year”—a surprise announcement for Biden that followed weeks of backlash from within his own party after a rocky debate performance that exacerbated concerns he is too old to serve another term. Prior to Biden’s announcement, it was widely believed Harris would be the de facto nominee if he were to drop out of the race, since she is the second-most powerful Democrat in the country, has name recognition as VP and is already part of his campaign, which allows her to seamlessly take over his $91 million war chest—and Biden’s endorsement likely means the delegates who were beholden to him will now be inclined to vote for Harris next month. Harris, 59, spent nearly 30 years as a prosecutor in California, where she was the state’s first female, the first African American and the first South Asian American elected as attorney general in 2010, prior to her election to the Senate in 2016. A coalition of top Democrats echoed Biden’s endorsement of Harris on Sunday, including President Bill Clinton and his wife, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton; Congressional Progressive Caucus Chair Pramila Jayapal, D-Wash.; and the Congressional Black Caucus PAC. What Has Biden Said About Harris? Biden called tapping Harris as his VP the “best decision” he’s made in Sunday’s announcement, and he’s praised her on several occasions in the last few weeks. During a speech at a NAACP convention last week, Biden said Harris is “not only a great vice president, she could be president of the United States.” Who Could Serve As Her Vp? Names commonly floated include rising stars in the Democratic party who were on the shortlist of potential Biden replacements: California Gov. Gavin Newsom, Colorado Gov. Jared Polis, Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker, North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper, Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear, Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro and Maryland Gov. Wes Moore. Other potential picks include Sen. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn., Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg and Sen. Raphael Warnock, D-Ga. So far, none have indicated publicly they are interested in the job. What Is Kamala Harris’ Family Background? Harris was born in Oakland, Calif., to Shyamala Gopalan, originally from southern India, and Donald Harris, who is from Jamaica, making Harris the first vice president of Black or South Asian descent. Both her parents are graduates of the University of California, Berkeley, and divorced when Harris and her younger sister, Maya, were children. Gapalan worked as a breast cancer research scientist, and Donald Harris was an economics professor at Stanford University. Harris’ mother died in 2009 at the age of 71; her father is 85. Emhoff and Harris married in 2014, and Harris became stepmother to his two children from a previous marriage: Cole Emhoff, 30, and Ella Emhoff, 25. How Rich Is Harris? We estimate Harris and Emhoff, a successful Los Angeles-based entertainment lawyer, are worth about $8 million. The couple’s net worth is largely made up of the money Emhoff earned as a lawyer (more than $1 million a year), sales from books Harris published before taking office and their real estate assets, including a multi-million dollar home in Los Angeles. How Has Trump Criticized Harris So Far? Trump on Saturday told a crowd at his rally in Grand Rapids, Michigan, “I call her laughing Kamala. Have you seen her laughing? She is crazy . . . she’s nuts.” The pro-Trump super PAC, MAGA Inc., released an ad shortly after Biden’s announcement accusing Harris of helping hide Biden’s “mental decline.” “Kamala knew Joe couldn’t do the job, so she did it,” the ad alleged. The ad is part of a $5 million/week TV commercial campaign in Pennsylvania, Georgia and Arizona, the super PAC tweeted. How Does Harris Poll Against Trump? Similar to Biden, who narrowly trailed Trump in most polls. Trump led Harris by three points and Biden by five in a July 16-18 CBS/YouGov poll of likely voters. An Economist/YouGov July 13-16 poll found Biden would lose to Trump by two points, and Harris would lose by five, while a July 16 Reuters/Ipsos poll found Harris and Biden were both tied with Trump. What Is Her Record As A Senator? In 2016, she became the second Black woman in history to be elected to the Senate. Harris played a high-profile role on the Senate Judiciary Committee questioning Trump’s Supreme Court nominees, including Justice Brett Kavanaugh. She co-sponsored legislation to expand abortion rights, introduced a bill that would have provided a tax credit to middle- and low-income families and co-sponsored legislation in the wake of the police killing of George Floyd that would have made it easier to prosecute police officers accused of misconduct. What Is Her Record As A Prosecutor? Harris served as San Francisco district attorney from 2004-2010 and as California attorney general from 2011-2017. In her 2009 book “Smart On Crime,” Harris endorsed diversion programs for first-time offenders but also called for more police on the streets. Progressives have accused her of not doing enough to investigate police misconduct and have pointed to the nearly 2,000 convictions for marijuana-related offenses that she oversaw during her time as attorney general. Harris’ views on criminal justice have evolved, however. She backed drug decriminalization legislation during her time in the Senate and she declared “nobody should have to go to jail for smoking weed” when Biden pardoned thousands of people convicted of federal marijuana possession in 2022. What Happened In Her 2020 Campaign For President? Harris ran for the Democratic nomination but dropped out before the primaries began, citing a lack of fundraising. She was briefly viewed as a top contender in the race, but she faced a series of setbacks, including low polling numbers, criticism from progressives about her record as a prosecutor and reports of operational problems within her campaign.

Australia’s Foreign Minister Penny Wong also took to social media to thank President Biden. “President Joe Biden has been a great friend of Australia,” she said. “His commitment to our shared pursuit of peace and prosperity has been unrelenting. “Our partnership and our alliance are stronger than ever for his contribution, as are AUKUS and the Quad. We thank him for his leadership.” Opposition Leader Peter Dutton thanked President Biden, particularly for his leadership in launching the AUKUS defence pact. “On behalf of the Coalition and federal opposition, I thank Joe Biden for his service and leadership as the 46th president of the United States,” Mr. Dutton said on social media. “The decision President Biden has taken today is one he believes is in the best interests of his nation, the American people, and the greater good. Mr. Dutton said President Biden had been a leader “resolutely committed to the alliance.” “I thank the president for the support and abiding friendship he has shown to Australia,” he said. Meanwhile, President Biden, who is currently in isolation while he recovers from COVID-19, has endorsed Vice President Kamala Harris to run for president. “My very first decision as the party nominee in 2020 was to pick Kamala Harris as my vice president and it’s been the best decision I’ve made,” Mr. Biden wrote on social media. “Today, I want to offer my full support and endorsement for Kamala to be the nominee of our party this year.” President Biden issued a call to Democrats across the United States, saying it was time to unify to beat Republican candidate and former President Donald Trump. Ms. Harris, in turn, thanked President Biden for what she described as “extraordinary leadership.” “I am honoured to have the president’s endorsement and my intention is to earn and win this nomination,” she said. Ms. Harris echoed President Biden’s sentiments in saying the Democrats needed to unite if they were to beat President Trump. President Trump reacted quickly to the news, saying he never believed President Biden was fit to serve.

His staff knew one minute before the public did","text":"WASHINGTON (AP) — At 1:45 p.m. Sunday, President Joe Biden’s senior staff was notified that he was stepping away from the 2024 race. At 1:46 p.m., that message was made public. It was never Biden’s intention to leave the race: Up until he decided to step aside Sunday, he was all in. His campaign was planning fundraisers and events and setting up travel over the next few weeks. But even as Biden was publicly dug in and insisting he was staying in the race, he was quietly reflecting on the disaster of the past few weeks, on the past three years of his presidency and on the scope of his half-century career in politics. In the end, it was the president’s decision alone, and he made it quietly, from his vacation home in Rehoboth Beach, Delaware, sick with COVID-19, the first lady with him as he talked it through with a small circle of people who have been with him for decades. “This has got to be one of the hardest decisions he’s ever made,” said Sen. Chris Coons, D-Del., the president’s closest ally in Congress, who spoke with him Sunday. “I know he wanted to fight and keep going and show that he could beat Donald Trump again, but as he heard more and more input, I think he was wrestling with what would be the best for the country,” Coons said in an interview with the Associated Press. This story is based on interviews with more than a dozen people familiar with the president’s thinking over the past few weeks, days and hours as he made his decision. They spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity to talk about private discussions. DECIDING TO LEAVE THE RACE It wasn’t until Saturday evening that Biden began to come to the conclusion that he would not run for reelection. He started writing a letter to the American people. Biden had been off the campaign trail for a few days, isolated because of COVID-19, when it all started to deeply sink in — his worsening chances of being able to defeat Donald Trump with so much of his party in open rebellion, seeking to push him out of the race — not to mention the persistent voter concerns about his age that were only exacerbated by the catastrophic debate. Biden was at his beach home with some of his and Jill Biden’s closest aides: chief strategist Mike Donilon, counselor to the president Steve Ricchetti, White House deputy chief of staff Annie Tomasini, and Anthony Bernal, senior adviser to the first lady. By Sunday, his decision crystalized. He spoke multiple times with Vice President Kamala Harris, whom he would endorse. He informed White House chief of staff Jeff Zients, and his longtime aide and campaign chairwoman Jen O’Malley Dillon. A small group of senior advisers from both the campaign and the White House were assembled for the 1:45 p.m. call to relay Biden’s decision, while his campaign staff released the social media announcement one minute later. “It has been the greatest honor of my life to serve as your President. And while it has been my intention to seek reelection, I believe it is in the best interest of my party and the country for me to stand down and to focus solely on fulfilling my duties as President for the remainder of my term,” Biden wrote. Just about a half-hour later came his public vote of support for Harris. It was a carefully choreographed strategy meant to give the president’s initial statement full weight, and to put a period on the moment before launching forward into the next step. “Today I want to offer my full support and endorsement for Kamala to be the nominee of our party this year,” Biden said in another post on X. “Democrats — it’s time to come together and beat Trump.” ABOUT THAT DEBATE It’s not like things had been going great before the June 27 debate. In an August 2023 poll from The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research, fully 77% of U.S. adults said Biden was too old to be effective for four more years. Not only did 89% of Republicans say that, but so did 69% of Democrats. And it hadn’t gotten any better by April, when more than half of U.S. adults thought Biden’s presidency hurt the country on issues like the cost of living and immigration. But Biden had insisted — to himself, to the nation, to his supporters — that he would be able to bring voters around if he got out there, told people about his record, explained it to them. Talked to them. Looked them in the eye. He had a lifetime of experience that told him that if he stuck to it, he’d overcome. His campaign was so confident, in fact, that they arranged to go around the Commission on Presidential Debates to set up a series of faceoffs with Trump under a new set of rules. That produced the June 27 debate that set Biden’s downfall in motion. Biden gave nonsensical answers, trailed off mid-sentence and appeared to stare blankly in front of an audience of 51 million people. Perhaps most distressing to other Democrats, Biden didn’t go after Trump’s myriad falsehoods about his involvement in the violence around the insurrection on Jan. 6, 2021, abortion rights or immigration. Biden and his team blamed the night on so many different things. He had a cold. He was jet-lagged. He needed to get more sleep. That night opened the door for his party to push him out. A SLOW ACCEPTANCE Publicly and privately Biden was fighting to stay in the race. He was working to convince voters that he was up for the task for another four years. He was frustrated by the Democrats coming out publicly against him, but even angrier about the leaks and anonymous sources relaying how even former President Barack Obama and former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi were working to get him to drop out. It looked like he’d won out a couple times; the chorus of naysayers seemed to die down. He had some well-received speeches mixed with so-so TV interviews and a day featuring an extended news conference in which he displayed a nuanced grasp of policy but also committed a few gasp-inducing gaffes. But the doubts didn’t go away. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer eventually invited top Biden staff to a meeting on July 11 to talk about their concerns. It didn’t go well. Senators expressed their concerns, and almost none of them said they had confidence in the president. But even afterwards, Schumer was worried it wasn’t getting to Biden. Following the meeting, Schumer called Democratic House Leader Hakeem Jeffries, former Speaker Nancy Pelosi and former President Obama. Schumer decided that day to request a meeting with Biden. At a July 13 meeting in Rehoboth, Schumer told Biden he was there out of love and affection. And he delivered a personal appeal focused on Biden’s legacy, the country’s future and the impact the top of the ticket could have on congressional races — and how that could potentially affect the Supreme Court. That same day came the attempted assassination of Donald Trump. Schumer told the president he didn’t expect him to make an immediate decision, but he hoped Biden would think about what he said, according to a person familiar with the conversation. Biden responded, “I need another week,” and the two men hugged. SUNDAY’S DECISION It was full steam ahead until Biden pulled the emergency brake. The president had lost his voice, but he was recovering well and his doctor had sent an update to the public shortly before 1 p.m. on his condition. His small circle decided to post the statement on X on Sunday, rather than let it leak out for days before he was prepared to address the nation, which he is expected to do sometime early this week. Much of his campaign was blindsided, and it was clear by how little had changed after he dropped out. For hours after the announcement, Biden’s campaign website reflected that he was still running and KamalaHarris.com still redirected to Biden’s page. Even Harris’ statement announcing her intent to succeed Biden was sent from “Joe Biden for President.” After the public announcement, Zients held a senior staff call, sent out an email and spoke with Biden’s cabinet. The president was also making personal calls. “Team — I wanted to make sure you saw the attached letter from the President,” Zients wrote in the staff email. “I could not be more proud to work for President Joe Biden, Vice President Kamala Harris, and the American people — alongside all of you, the best White House team in history. There’s so much more to do — and as President Biden says, ‘there is nothing America can’t do — when we do it together.’” Vermont Sen. Peter Welch, a Democrat who had called for Biden to bow out, was gardening with his wife when the news broke, and said he was momentarily “stunned.” Senators texted each other questioning if it was really happening. Democratic Connecticut Sen. Richard Blumenthal was at an event in his state, and there was spontaneous applause when it was announced to the crowd that Biden wouldn’t run, he said. There was a sense of excitement and energy in the crowd “that has been completely lacking,” Blumenthal said. “It was also, let’s be blunt, a sense of relief,” he said. “And a sense of reverence for Joe Biden.” By Sunday evening, Biden for President had formally changed to Harris for President. O’Malley Dillon told campaign staff their jobs were safe, because the operation was shifting to a campaign for Harris. ___ Associated Press writer Farnoush Amiri contributed to this report.

He joins a small but honorable fraternity of men who, for various reasons, declined to seek reelection. This club was founded by George Washington, whose refusal to stand for the presidency again in 1796 was particularly important, because he was walking away from a virtually guaranteed victory. Biden, by contrast, was facing the serious prospect of a loss, but his decision is similarly admirable. The president sees Donald Trump as a threat to American democracy, and he must know that he has been trailing Trump for months, even before the debate in June that sealed his fate. Biden tried to recover, but in every public outing, he raised more doubts than he dispelled. Anxious Democrats tried to get the message through to him, in private at first and then in public, that he was losing ground in swing states and that his continued presence in the race could even doom downballot candidates. Many Democrats at the national level believed that Biden was leading his party to a repeat of 2016, in which Trump would again grind out an Electoral College victory while the Republicans would take the House and Senate. Biden would be defeated, and Trump would control the entire government. This time, there would be none of the supposed adults in the room who guided Trump during his tenure. His next administration would be staffed by bottom-feeding opportunists and cranks. The courts are positioned to support this new era of Trumpism: The conservative majority on the Supreme Court has already invited Trump to rule as a king—or worse. Faced with what he sees as a nightmare scenario both for his party and his nation, President Biden decided to end his candidacy. My colleague Franklin Foer (who has written a biography of Biden) noted today that the Biden of the past few weeks was a less than admirable figure: He was a defensive, brittle old man who didn’t want to be told he could no longer lead the party on the field of political battle. Like many Americans, I have had the experience of tussling with an elderly parent who came to understand I was right but needed time to admit it. (My father lived to be 94, and we faced many such issues together.) Biden, I am assuming, has been trying to come to grips with the possibility that he might now be the Democrat least likely to defeat Trump. I do not know—no one can at this point—whether Biden’s replacement will fare any better in November. (Biden has thrown his support behind his vice president, Kamala Harris, as one would expect. Representative Jim Clyburn endorsed her, and the Democrats seem to be coalescing around her.) But at least the Democrats have a fighting chance now. Biden said recently that he couldn’t wait to get back on the trail against Trump, an attempt at bravado that implied he was about to start barnstorming across the fruited plain. I did not believe he was physically capable of doing that kind of campaigning; I doubt many elected Democrats did either. Of course, if the nominee is Harris, the Republicans will go into culture-war overdrive. They will say that as a Californian, she is too liberal. They will say that as a former prosecutor, she is too conservative. They will say that she is too female and too Black. (Well, they won’t say those last two out loud, but get ready for a fusillade of dog whistles that will be amped up to the point that they could shatter granite.) Indeed, the MAGA Republicans are already griping about a Democratic Party “coup,” as if they have serious concerns about democracy in any political party, including their own. But Biden’s decision reflected a determination to put the fate of his country ahead of his personal vanity, a choice Trump is inherently incapable of making. After today the difference between the Democrats and the Republicans could not be clearer. Biden faces challenges of age that are not going to get any easier. His decision to make way for a younger candidate reaffirmed that his party is not about one man. Trump, meanwhile, continues to bellow gibberish at his rallies, raving like the emotionally unstable, would-be dictator that he is. Even after Trump insulted America’s veterans and the nation’s war dead, even after he was found liable for sexual abuse, even after he racked up 34 felony convictions, almost no elected officials in his party called for him to leave the ticket. (As usual, Mitt Romney was seated at a table for one.) Yet millions of Americans, sadly, have come to regard Trump’s pestilential character as merely a curious facet of an otherwise normal candidate. Now that Biden is stepping down, perhaps all the false equivalency can end. Biden is a good man, and he’s been a good and consequential president with a first-term record most of his predecessors would envy. He is capable of serving out his term and should do so. (The calls from Republicans today that he should now resign, coming from opportunistic hypocrites such as Elise Stefanik, are as meaningless as they are predictable.) Trump was a disaster, an incompetent and ignorant president whose selfish decisions, especially about COVID-19, likely cost many thousands of Americans their lives. Biden’s decision is now also a challenge to every voter in the pro-democracy coalition to live by their words. For two years, many Americans lamented the choice between the aging Biden and the dissolute, unbalanced Trump. Their wish has been granted: They will now likely have a choice between a shouty, 78-year-old habitual liar whose life is a record of shame and failure and a 59-year-old woman who has served honorably as a big-state attorney general, a senator, and the vice president of the United States. Harris has her critics, and she will bring her own vulnerabilities to a campaign. Every American should assess her record with judicious skepticism, as they would that of any other politician. But in the end, if the vice president is the eventual nominee, she will be a candidate similar to many others throughout American history who can claim a long record of senior-government experience. (Like Trump, for example, she has been given briefs on nuclear-launch procedures. Unlike Trump, she almost certainly understood them.) Every voter who cares about democracy but has claimed to be paralyzed by the two old men in the race will now have no excuses for indecision. The Democrats have made clear that they intend to field a stable, experienced candidate. The Republicans, a cult of personality in the grip of fevered delusions, will field Trump. Tonight, Americans have the clarity they demanded. Related: When you buy a book using a link in this newsletter, we receive a commission.

The prospect of a return to the White House for the 78-year-old Trump had traditional US allies in Europe bracing for a more abrasive and transactional foreign policy, with the focus away from Ukraine and with tariffs deployed as a geo-economic weapon on China and Europe. Vice President Kamala Harris is the front-runner to take over, although she isn’t that well known in Europe and Asia. Here are reactions from leaders around the globe: Europe and Middle East Keir Starmer, UK Prime Minister “I respect President Biden’s decision and I look forward to us working together during the remainder of his presidency. I know that, as he has done throughout his remarkable career, he will have made his decision based on what he believes is best for the American people.” Olaf Scholz, German Chancellor “My friend @POTUS Joe Biden has achieved a lot: for his country, for Europe, for the world. Thanks to him, transatlantic cooperation is close, NATO is strong and the USA is a good and reliable partner for us. His decision not to run again deserves respect.” Donald Tusk, Polish Prime Minister “Mr. President @JoeBiden, you have many times made difficult decisions that made Poland, America and the world safer, and democracy and freedom stronger,” Tusk said on X. “I know you had the same in mind when you announced your last decision. Perhaps the hardest thing in life.” Volodymyr Zelenskiy, Ukrainian President “Ukraine is grateful to President Biden for his unwavering support for Ukraine’s fight for freedom, which, along with strong bipartisan support in the United States, has been and continues to be critical.” Simon Harris, Irish Prime Minister “Joe Biden, in all the offices he has held, has always been an unwavering voice and passionate worker for peace on the island of Ireland and our country owes him a great debt for this, Harris wrote on X. “On a personal level, President Biden is a proud American with an Irish soul. When he arrived into Belfast, Louth and Mayo last year he himself said it was like coming home.” Pedro Sanchez, Spanish Prime Minister “All my admiration and respect for the brave and dignified decision by President @JoeBiden,” Sanchez said on X. “Thanks to his determination and leadership, the US overcame the economic crisis after the pandemic and the grave assault on the Capitol and been exemplary in its support for Ukraine.” “A grand gesture from a great president who always fought for democracy and freedom.” Petr Fiala, Czech Prime Minister “It is undoubtedly the decision of a statesman who has served his country for decades,” Fiala said on X. “It is a responsible and personally difficult step, but it is all the more valuable. I am keeping my fingers crossed for the USA that a good president emerges from the democratic competition of two strong and equal candidates.” Isaac Herzog, Israeli President “I want to extend my heartfelt thanks to Joe Biden for his friendship and steadfast support for the Israeli people over his decades long career,” Herzog said on X. “As the first US President to visit Israel in wartime, as a recipient of the Israeli Presidential Medal of Honor, and as a true ally of the Jewish people, he is a symbol of the unbreakable bond between our two peoples. I send him, Jill Biden, and all his family, my warmest wishes from Jerusalem.” Americas Justin Trudeau, Canadian Prime Minister “I’ve known President Biden for years. He’s a great man, and everything he does is guided by his love for his country. As President, he is a partner to Canadians — and a true friend. To President Biden and the First Lady: thank you.”","summary":"\"Ukraine is grateful to President Biden for his unwavering support for Ukraine’s fight for freedom, which, along with strong bipartisan support in the United States, has been and continues to be critical.\"","url":"https://fortune.com/2024/07/21/world-leaders-joe-biden-record-presidential-race-withdrawal-starmer-trudeau-zelenskiy/","image":"https://fortune.com/img-assets/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/GettyImages-1247322324-e1721603074592.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-07-21 23:16:35","author":"Ben Sills,Bloomberg","authors":["Ben Sills","Bloomberg"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.292},{"id":252299262,"title":"Dems Mock Trump as ‘Too Old’ to Run—Like He Did to Biden","text":"Democrats seized on Donald Trump's age Sunday—turning Republicans' attack on Joe Biden back on them. “The man is nearly 80-years-old and so the question is, can he serve another four years? I'm not sure he can,” former South Carolina state representative Bakari Sellers told CNN. The attack was unavailable to the party until 1.46pm on Sunday when Biden stepped aside but was waiting in plain sight. On Thursday, Trump became the oldest presidential nominee in U.S. history at the age of 78, beating the previous record holder President Joe Biden by one year. Trump’s campaign messaging focused heavily on Biden’s age, running attack ads using clips of the president looking forgetful or sluggish posing the question of whether he would physically survive a second term. “Donald Trump is too old to be President,” Rep. Casey Weinstein (D-OH) on X, formerly known as Twitter.

The 54-year-old first son was spotted near his home in Los Angeles over the weekend before his dad made the extraordinary decision to step aside and endorse Kamala Harris to take on Donald Trump in the November general election. ‘That unconditional love has been his North Star as a President, and as a parent. He is unique in public life today, in that there is no distance between Joe Biden the man and Joe Biden the public servant of the last 54 years,’ Hunter said in a statement on Sunday night. ‘He is unique in public life today, in that there is no distance between Joe Biden the man and Joe Biden the public servant of the last 54 years. ‘I’m so lucky every night I get to tell him I love him, and to thank him. I ask all American to join me tonight in doing the same. Thank you, Mr. President. I love you, Dad.’ President Biden offered his endorsement to his running mate, Kamala Harris, after his exit. His move throws the presidential race into chaos, but leaves time for Democrats to get their house in order before their August convention. Hunter and his father speak on the phone, and in the weeks since the disastrous debate he has been seen in meetings in the White House and with the president’s inner circle. Joe Biden has supported his troubled son through his many battles, including his addiction to crack cocaine and the trial where he was found guilty of three federal gun charges – for which the president has vowed not to pardon him. He joined the rest of Biden’s family who immediately showed their support for him after he made the stunning announcement he was dropping his re-election bid. Jill Biden sent him her love, retweeting his letter with two red hearts. Naomi Biden, the Bidens’ eldest granddaughter, wrote a long post on X, where she said she was ‘proud’ of her ‘pop,’ which is what the grandchildren call President Biden. Biden, 81, who is suffering from COVID, is at his home in Rehoboth Beach, Delaware, with his wife Jill. They have been holed up there with his closest advisers and they pondered their political future. He had been under tremendous pressure from people in his party to step down after his terrible debate performance against Donald Trump. ‘While it has been my intention to seek reelection, I believe it is in the best interest of my party and the country for me to stand down and to focus solely on fulfilling my duties as President for the remainder of my term,’ he wrote in a letter to the American people. His family, who was an influential factor in his decision, stood by him. ‘I’m nothing but proud today of my Pop, our President, Joe Biden, who has served our country with every bit of his soul and with unmatched distinction. Not only has he been—and will continue to be—the most effective president of our lifetime, but he has likely already cemented himself as the most effective and impactful public servant in our nation’s history,’ Naomi Biden wrote on X. ‘He has been at the center of, and had a material impact on, literally every single major issue that our country and world has faced for 50 years. Our world is better today in so many ways thanks to him. To the Americans who have always had his back, keep the faith. He will always have ours.’ Joe Biden endorsed his Vice President Kamala Harris to replace him as the nominee. The Democrats will nominate their candidate at their convention next month. The Democratic National Convention is set to kick off August 19 through 22 in Chicago where Biden had been set to formally accept the nomination having received 3,896 delegates during the primaries. Because Biden exited the race before officially becoming the nominee – the more than 3,900 pledged delegates get to cast their ballots in an open convention for whichever candidate they want. They may line up behind Harris, who, because of federal law, is the only candidate that can use the money Biden has raised for the 2024 race. The delegates will hold a vote on the convention floor. If a candidate wins the majority of pledged delegates on the first ballot, they become the party nominee. If no candidate gets a majority, then the so-called nearly 740 superdelegates, also known as automatic delegates, get to vote as well. They include a mix of party members and elected officials. Voting continues until a candidate gets a majority of delegates.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nHunter Biden told the United States to thank his father and praised&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Hunter Biden expresses his love for his father and appreciates his dad&#8217;s unwavering support in a statement following his withdrawal. first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/news/us/hunter-biden-expresses-his-love-for-his-father-and-appreciates-his-dads-unwavering-support-in-a-statement-following-his-withdrawal/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/rewrite-this-title-Hunter-Biden-says-I-love-you-dad.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-07-21 23:14:46","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.01},{"id":252299276,"title":"Trump calls for next presidential debate to be held on Fox News","text":"Former President Donald Trump said the next presidential debate should be moderated by Fox News, not \"on Fake News ABC,\" after President Biden dropped out of the 2024 race. \"My debate with Crooked Joe Biden, the Worst President in the history of the United States, was slated to be broadcast on Fake News ABC, the home of George Slopadopolus, sometime in September. Now that Joe has, not surprisingly, has quit the race, I think the Debate, with whomever the Radical Left Democrats choose, should be held on FoxNews, rather than very biased ABC. Thank you!,\" Trump posted to Truth Social late Sunday afternoon. Trump's statement comes after Biden officially dropped out of the 2024 presidential race following weeks of mounting pressure from Democratic allies that he should bow out and pass the mantle to someone better suited to defeat Trump come November. The calls for him to drop out stem from concerns over his mental fitness and 81 years of age, which came under heightened scrutiny after his disastrous debate performance last month. \"It has been the greatest honor of my life to serve as your President. And while it has been my intention to seek re-election, I believe it is in the best interest of my party and the country for me to stand down and to focus solely on fulfilling my duties as President for the remainder of my term,\" Biden said in his letter posted to X Sunday afternoon. WHAT COMES NEXT FOR DEMOCRATS AFTER BIDEN'S CAMPAIGN SUSPENSION? The president endorsed Vice President Kamala Harris for president shortly following his announcement. Harris is the most likely candidate to run in Biden's place, but still needs to become the official nominee at the Democratic National Convention next month.

Today I want to offer my full support and endorsement for Kamala to be the nominee of our party this year. Democrats — it’s time to come together and beat Trump. Let’s do this,\" Biden said. CNN moderated the first presidential debate in June, with ABC News slated to host the second debate in September. Due to Biden now out of the race, Trump is calling for the debate schedule to be modified and have Fox News host the debate. It is unclear who Trump will debate until the DNC certifies its nominee. Trump and his campaign previously accepted two Fox News debates this election cycle, including a presidential debate for Oct. 2, and a vice presidential debate for a date that had not yet been determined.

Watch the ABC News special, \"Biden Stands Down: The Race for the White House,\" tonight from 7-9 p.m. ET on ABC and ABC News Live. \"His remarkable legacy of accomplishment is unmatched in modern American history, surpassing the legacy of many presidents who have served two terms in office,\" she said. Harris garners wave of endorsements Biden endorsed Harris in his statement on his exiting the race, offering his \"full support and endorsement\" for her to be the Democratic Party's presidential nominee. At a July 11 press conference, Biden also hinted at his belief in Harris' ability to lead, saying at the time: \"I wouldn't have picked her unless I thought she was qualified to be president.\" In a poll released July 11, asking if Harris were to replace Biden as the nominee, vote choices were 49-46%, Harris-Donald Trump, among all adults (and 49-47%, respectively, among registered voters). Harris' 49% was slightly better than Biden's 46%, although she doesn't have a statistically significant lead over Trump, the poll found. Former President Bill Clinton and former presidential candidate and Secretary of State Hillary Clinton also endorsed Harris on Sunday. \"We are honored to join the president in endorsing Vice President Harris and will do whatever we can to support her,\" the two said in a statement on X.

RELATED: Vice President Kamala Harris: Everything to know In her statement Sunday, Harris continued, \"It is a profound honor to serve as his vice president, and I am deeply grateful to the president, [first lady] Dr. [Jill] Biden, and the entire Biden family. I first came to know President Biden through his son Beau. We were friends from our days working together as attorneys general of our home states. As we worked together, Beau would tell me stories about his dad. The kind of father -- and the kind of man -- he was. And the qualities Beau revered in his father are the same qualities, the same values, I have seen every single day in Joe's leadership as president: His honesty and integrity. His big heart and commitment to his faith and his family. And his love of our country and the American people.\" Several notable figures abstain from immediately endorsing Harris Despite the wave of support from some Democratic figures, others did not immediately endorse Harris on Sunday. Former President Barack Obama did not mention Harris in his statement on Biden's exit. Instead, he focused on his experience in the White House with Biden as his vice president: \"Sixteen years ago, when I began my search for a vice president, I knew about Joe's remarkable career in public service. But what I came to admire even more was his character -- his deep empathy and hard-earned resilience; his fundamental decency and belief that everyone counts,\" Obama said in a statement. Sen. Cory Booker, D-N.Y., also did not mention Harris in his statement on Biden's exit. \"I cannot overstate the gravity of the noble and history-making decision that President Biden just made. The feeling that I have right now is one of profound gratitude,\" Booker said. Texas Rep. Lloyd Doggett, who was the first House Democrat to call on Biden to step aside in the presidential race, back on July 2, applauded Biden's decision but put the breaks on endorsing Harris. \"Once again President Biden comes through for America, putting country over ego in a way that Donald Trump never could,\" Doggett said, in part. He added, \"While, with President Biden's endorsement, Vice President Harris is clearly the leading candidate, we should be open to all talented individuals who wish to be considered.\" Some donors express excitement Some Democratic donors who previously planned to withhold their campaign contributions told ABC News on Sunday that they are now excited to coalesce their support around Vice President Harris, even if she was not their first pick to replace Joe Biden at the top of the ticket \"I don't think that having some kind of bitter inner party fight over the nomination is going to help. If Biden is endorsing Harris, then I think that basically decides it,\" said one donor who initially pledged to contribute more than $1.8 million to Biden before withholding their contribution over concerns about Biden's viability as the nominee. Reacting to Biden's decision to drop out of the race and endorse Harris, that same donor said they now plan to resume their pledged contribution to Harris. \"I just texted Rufus Gifford,\" the donor said, referring to the Biden-Harris campaign finance chair. \"I told him I'm all in.\" Another donor -- who originally said that she planned to withhold her contribution and preferred an open convention -- told ABC News that she now fully supports Harris following Biden's withdrawal and endorsement. \"I am convinced that 100% of us will get behind her,\" said the donor, who previously held a fundraiser for Biden in her home. \"Some people are getting their funds transfer information organized as we speak.\" Some of the donors who spoke with ABC News were not enthusiastic about Harris compared to other Democratic politicians -- including California Gov. Gavin Newsom and Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer -- but described Harris as the inevitable nominee. \"I can't see how any other serious candidate could come out at this point and say, I'm running for the nomination against Harris,\" another Democratic donor said.","summary":"President Joe Biden, former President Bill Clinton and former presidential candidate and Secretary of State Hillary Clinton all endorsed Harris on Sunday.","url":"https://abc13.com/post/vice-president-kamala-harris-thanks-president-joe-biden/15079011/","image":"https://cdn.abcotvs.com/dip/images/15079041_072124-getty-kamala-harris-wave-img.jpg?w=1600","video":"https://vcl.abcotv.net/video/wls/072124-wls-biden-whats-next-discussion-5p-vid-vid.mp4","publish_date":"2024-07-21 23:10:30","author":"ABCNews,Kiara Alfonseca And Peter Charalambous","authors":["ABCNews","Kiara Alfonseca And Peter Charalambous"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.318}]}
