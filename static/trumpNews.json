Vladimir Zelensky will put US President Donald Trump’s peace plan to a referendum, if Kiev fails to negotiate a better position on Donbass during his upcoming talks with the US leader on Sunday, the Axios news portal said.\n\nThe portal wrote, citing a phone interview with Zelensky, that he plans to agree on a framework agreement with Trump to end the conflict.\n\n\"Zelensky also revealed he's willing to bring that plan up for a referendum,\" Axios wrote. \"While Zelensky emphasized that great progress has been made, Trump's plan still demands painful territorial concessions from Ukraine in the east. Zelensky is still hoping to improve those terms and said he'll need to seek approval of the Ukrainian people if they can't get to a ‘strong’ position on territory.\"\n\nOn December 24, Zelensky shared a 20-point peace plan that Ukraine had allegedly presented to the American side at recent talks in the United States with the press. Among other things, the plan includes the introduction of educational programs in Ukrainian schools that would promote tolerance of various cultures, addresses the territorial issue, highlights Ukraine’s refusal to withdraw troops from Donbass, demands security guarantees similar to NATO’s Article 5, emphasizes the need for Ukraine to have a peacetime army of 800,000 troops, envisages Ukraine’s non-nuclear status, records the status of the Zaporozhye Nuclear Power Plant, calls for ensuring freedom of navigation on the Dnieper River, suggests conducting all-for-all prisoner exchanges, and stipulates holding a presidential election in Ukraine. The plan also touches upon territorial issues and the status of the Zaporozhye Nuclear Power Plant, although no compromise between the US and Ukraine has been achieved on these points.\n\nMeanwhile, Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergey Ryabkov said that Zelensky’s plan, \"if it can ever be called a plan, radically differs from the 27 points Russia has been discussing in its contacts with the American side in recent weeks, beginning from early December.\".","summary":"Vladimir Zelensky plans to agree on a framework agreement with the US leader to end the conflict","url":"https://tass.com/world/2065553","image":"https://tass.com/img/blocks/common/tass_logo_share_eng.png","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-27 01:04:54","author":"Tass","authors":["Tass"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"RU","sentiment":0.188},{"id":389318968,"title":"Friday's Final Word","text":"Closing tabs, closing tabs, closing all the tabs ... \n\n\"Long story short,\" concluded Arthur, \"Trump II has the will prior administrations lacked to enforce the law in the interior, has a large population of removable aliens to choose from (thanks to non-enforcement under Biden), has the detention space to hold them (thanks to the Big…— Byron York (@ByronYork) December 24, 2025\n\n... has the detention space to hold them (thanks to the Big Beautiful Bill Act), and has willing federal and state partners to lend a hand.

Joe Biden would disappear for weeks at a time. Trump? There’s no hiding from him. His White House was a perpetual-motion machine, reaching into every corner of Washington and beyond. Some actions were consequential; others amounted to little more than pokes in woke America’s eye. But they were all loud, and nonstop. This was a president rejecting lame-duck status, demonstrating he intends to wring the life out of every day remaining to him in the Oval Office.\n\nThe volume was so huge—and so wide-reaching—that it’s hard to step back and evaluate the bigger goals. Yet here’s an attempt at just that—a packaging of the bigger themes of this first year, and an evaluation of the highs, the lows and the yet-to-be-determined.\n\nEd: Love him or hate him, or even if you're lukewarm on him, Donald Trump was clearly the most consequential person of 2025. Trump learned a lot from his first term, and has applied the correct lessons in most aspects. \n\nJimmy Kimmel goes on UK television to call America a fascist country as the UK is locking up UK citizens for social media posts.Kimmel is a traitor to his country.pic.twitter.com/OB1Q6FNy4s— C3 (@C_3C_3) December 26, 2025\n\nEd: Jimmy Kimmel couldn't recognize fascism if it bit him in the ass. Yes, this is unintentional irony, but the scores of people locked up in the UK this year social media posts aren't laughing. That gives them something in common from the 95% of TV viewers who don't watch Kimmel in the US. Kimmel postured as a free speech martyr for months, then went where the government is arresting dissenters to cry about tyranny in the US. \n\nAxios: President Trump is expected to host Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in Mar-a-Lago on Sunday to try and reach agreement on the U.S. peace plan, Ukrainian officials say.\n\nWhy it matters: The meeting is a sign of significant progress in the talks. Trump said previously that he'd only meet Zelensky if he felt a deal was close.\n\nWhat they are saying: \"We are not losing a single day. We have agreed on a meeting at the highest level — with President Trump in the near future. A lot can be decided before the New Year,\" Zelensky wrote on X on Friday morning after receiving a briefing from his top negotiator, Rustem Umerov.\n\nEd: Worth noting, but don't read too much into this. If Trump and Zelensky get on the same page for a proposal, that will be good news, but that doesn't mean Putin will accept it. \n\n🚨 WOMAN LOSES IT AFTER SEEING HER STUDENT LOAN TRIPLE - “WHAT TYPE OF CRACK ARE THEY SMOKING??”An American woman is going viral after breaking down the numbers on her Temple University student loan - and the math is insane.She borrowed $40,922 for school.Sallie Mae says… pic.twitter.com/1Iu5MSkMvR— HustleBitch (@HustleBitch_) December 26, 2025\n\nEd: If you get a college degree and still don't understand compound interest, perhaps the issue is more about the crack you've smoked rather than your lender. Not to mention the quality of the education you received. Let's not forget that Barack Obama nationalized the student loan industry, so perhaps the woman here should take it up with The One. \n\nThe Free Press: We all know that the news tends toward bleakness. Wars, terror attacks, violent crime—these are the kinds of stories that tend to make headlines.\n\nYet there are also those moments when the news is, from an objective standpoint, quite funny. The local curiosities, alcohol-fueled wildlife, and embarrassing relatives of prominent figures all lend a bit more color to our lives.\n\nSo with the end of the year approaching, and with Nellie Bowles’s beloved TGIF off until the New Year, we asked some of our journalists to highlight the humorous stories that have given us a little hope—or at least a laugh—in this otherwise grim year.\n\nEd: It's worth reading as a kind of weird review of 2025, but I think only Oliver Wiseman understood the assignment. Olivia Nuzzi doesn't make a single appearance, surprisingly. Oddly, Trump only gets three mentions. \n\nTHERE GOES MY SPRING BREAK PLANS, THANKS A LOT DONALD DRUMPFI HAD A FULL ITINERARY OF GETTING KIDNAPPED AND RANSOMED AND CATCHING AIDS ALL PLANNED OUTAND NOW IT’S RUINED https://t.co/9DqB3GQpxm— Oilfield Rando (@Oilfield_Rando) December 26, 2025\n\nEd: Interesting to see Niger using this diplomatic rebuke while Europe screeches about Trump using the same mechanism. \n\nKira Davis: With the election of the Obama administration, there was a more concerted effort from official government channels to mute “Christmas” at Christmas-time and push the more generic aspects of the winter holiday season. We wouldn’t want to offend all those diverse diversity people with our Christian traditions. How colonial!\n\nThese days, you’ll be roundly ridiculed (at least in the online universe) for suggesting there is a “war on Christmas,” and even for being too enthusiastic about reclaiming the “Merry Christmas!” greeting.\n\nThe truth is, we most certainly have been warring against Christmas in this country for quite some time now…because we war against God. Christmas is the season in which we acknowledge the arrival of God.\n\nEd: We live in rebellion against God. It is no surprise that this has muted into two forms when it comes to Christmas and Easter. First, we try to secularize both, and whatever is left of these religious celebrations is actively suppressed or ignored. \n\nSay it louder“Who are the real colonizers” (Muslims)Without Arab imperialism:- Egyptians would be Coptic- Moroccans would be Berber- Libya and Algeria would be Amazigh- Syria and Lebanon would be Aramaic speaking and partly Phoenician- Iraq would be Mesopotamian-… pic.twitter.com/uPjj5JmLNO— Wall Street Apes (@WallStreetApes) December 26, 2025\n\nEd: I've made this argument a number of times when discussing the attempts to paint Jews as colonizers of \"Palestine.\" The opposite is true; Arabs colonized vast swaths of territory long before the Scandinavians began doing the same thing from northern Europe. In fairness, the Romans got there before the Arabs. But before all of this, the Jews were in Judea, and they remain the only people in the world who live in the same place and worship the same God as they did 3500 years ago. \n\nTim Graham at Newsbusters: Hunter Biden is a shameless liar. It’s just as true today as it was in the midst of his binges on crack and hookers. It’s also true that the elitist media have long shown a deep desire to ignore him entirely, and when they couldn’t, it was a sad family tragedy, so head for the handkerchiefs.\n\nThe Daily Caller reports that Hunter went on “The Shawn Ryan Podcast” to unload more whoppers, and no lie was more shameless than this: “What I can tell you about the laptop is that there is no laptop. That’s bulls--t.” Ryan replied, “There was no f--king laptop?”\n\nHunter implausibly claimed “There is an actual physical laptop that somebody had, but the guy that had, that said he had the laptop, the existence of the search for the laptop came before he was even a twinkle in Rudy Giuliani’s eye.” He started babbling about how Lev Parnas “literally went to Ukraine to get a laptop “four months before John Paul Mac Isaac ever even… existed. And so, what they did is they cobbled together [a] stolen, concocted, fabricated mishmash of digital information, largely, which is, you know, thousands and thousands and thousands of emails…from 25 years. I mean, no laptop could have held all of that.”\n\nEd: That's a weird flex, given that (a) everyone has now conceded that the laptop was genuine, and (b) Hunter's own lawyers had to admit it in order to argue (unsuccessfully) that the material was inadmissible in his criminal case. Graham has taken the proper measure of Hunter. And of the whole Biden clan, for that matter. \n\n.@POTUS: \"What would you like Santa to bring?\"KID: \"Not coal!\"@POTUS: \"You mean 'clean, beautiful coal.'\"🤣🤣🤣 pic.twitter.com/K15IqUMxzA— Rapid Response 47 (@RapidResponse47) December 24, 2025\n\nEd: I missed this one.

Oceans of awe. Sky-loads of ambition. All delivered under the political stewardship of Donald Trump, a man whose ego can be seen from a galaxy far, far away, and whose appetite for attention would dwarf solar systems.\n\nWhen asked why he wanted to climb Everest, George Mallory famously replied: “Because it’s there.” It was meant as a shrug, a summation of human curiosity.\n\nBut there is something revealing about how often that line resurfaces whenever ambition needs no further justification.\n\nThe Moon, like Everest, exists. And existence alone, it seems, can still trigger a blank cheque.\n\nThe other story wears no romance.\n\nIt does not speak of gateways, only of exits that no longer exist. It tells of another vast expenditure by the same nation — not to escape gravity and discover new worlds, but to press the boot of oppression down harder upon a vulnerable neck already pinned beneath it.\n\nBillions of dollars more, this time not for space rockets, but for bombs; not for lunar modules, but for the steady eradication of life in Gaza into something unrecognisable, something spoken of as collateral, something treated as less than human.\n\nThere is no great technological mystery here. There is no moral one, either. We know how to build spaceships. We also know how to level cities.\n\nThe end-of-year habit is to ask what kind of year it has been, and wonder what the next one will bring. But perhaps the more honest question is what kind of species we continue to be?\n\nNASA’s language is immaculate. “Exploration.” “Presence.” “Pathfinding.”\n\nEven “Artemis” itself — a goddess, a huntress, moonlight made myth. It all suggests forward motion, progress, a better version of ourselves unfolding somewhere beyond the atmosphere.\n\nAnd yet the same cheque book that funds the dream of humanity living among the stars is underwriting the deliberate unravelling of humanity on Earth.\n\nThis is not a budgetary contradiction. It is a moral one.\n\nNorman Mailer, watching the Apollo missions in Of a Fire on the Moon, was already uneasy about this split personality.\n\nHe sensed that America’s reach for the heavens was also an escape — a way of avoiding harder reckonings at ground level.\n\nThe Moon, he suggested, was being used as a mirror for national power rather than a window for human humility.\n\nWe are told, often, that these are separate conversations. That science must be insulated from politics. That defence spending is regrettable but necessary. That the Moon is about “all mankind,” while Gaza and Palestine is a deeply complex “problem” requiring diplomatic dexterity.\n\nThe language works hard to keep the worlds apart.\n\nBut the numbers refuse to cooperate. Both the dead, and the money spent to slaughter them. They sit there, blunt and unembarrassed, insisting on comparison.\n\nThere is something deeply unsettling about a civilisation capable of planning a lunar base decades in advance while accepting, in real time, the mass extinguishing of civilian life.\n\nIt suggests a future-facing imagination paired with a present-day moral exhaustion. We can picture ourselves on the Moon, but cannot countenance our responsibility to the children under rubble we helped create.\n\nPerhaps that is the real dichotomy of 2026: not Earth versus space, but aspiration versus empathy.\n\nThe Moon, whether we fly there or not, will still be there. It has survived worse than us.\n\nGaza, by contrast, is running out of time. And history has a way of noticing which projects were urgent, and which were merely the human race flexing its muscles.\n\nAs the year closes, the lights dim, and another round of speeches is prepared about hope, innovation and humanity’s shared destiny, it might be worth asking what kind of species we are exporting into the cosmos. One that builds gateways in space while blowing bridges to smithereens on Earth? One that reaches for the stars while shrinking the meaning of human life below?\n\nThe Moon does not need us yet. The people of Gaza do. And no amount of rocket fire will ever drown out that quieter, heavier truth.\n\nAt the end of the year, when the noise settles, it is usually the silences that judge us most.","summary":"There is something deeply unsettling about a civilisation capable of planning a lunar base decades in advance while accepting, in real time, the mass extinguishing of civilian life","url":"https://www.irishexaminer.com/opinion/columnists/arid-41765201.html","image":"https://www.irishexaminer.com/cms_media/module_img/9821/4910918_6_seoimage1x1_iStock-2210668237.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-27 01:00:00","author":"Colin Sheridan,Irishexaminer.com","authors":["Colin Sheridan","Irishexaminer.com"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"ie","sentiment":-0.293},{"id":389317446,"title":"Irish Examiner view: Enjoy the post-Christmas lull to plan for a lively year","text":"Major among these will be our turn to take over the rotating presidency of the European Union on July 1, following on from Cyprus. While this will be the eighth time that we have fulfilled these duties, the dangers and threats to Europe are more tangible than during our previous stewardships of 1975, 1979, 1984, 1990, 1996, 2004, and 2013.\n\n This is particularly because of the challenges posed by Russia. While we expect to host more than 230 presidency events in Ireland and chair more than 170 EU preparatory bodies, committees and working groups in Brussels, confidence has been rattled by the drone incursion into Irish airspace during the visit of Volodymyr Zelenskyy at the start of the month.\n\n Irish senator, former army captain, and regular defence commentator Tom Clonan, writing in the British press, said: “We’re Europe’s weakest link when it comes to security, defence, and intelligence.” He described Ireland as “completely and utterly defenceless and, I would say, provocatively weak.” \n\nWhile its EU role will be a primary matter for the Republic there are at least two other overseas events which will command attention. The second week of next month marks the deadline for Israel’s response to what has become known as the “Genocide Convention Case” brought to the International Court of Justice by South Africa. \n\nThis deadline was extended from July this year after a request from Jerusalem. Oral hearings are likely to start late in 2026 or early in 2027.\n\n Next autumn will also see the mid-term elections in the United States when all 435 seats in the House of Representatives will be up for grabs and 35 of 100 senate places can be contested. This points to a volatile year for Donald Trump. The United States begins its official withdrawal from the World Health Organisation in January. \n\nThere are major anniversaries to be marked including the 250th year of the Declaration of Independence in July; and 25 years since the September 11 attacks and the start of the war in Afghanistan. August will mark the fifth anniversary of the departure of the last US troops from Kabul as the Taliban seized the capital.\n\n If the political winds are blowing against him, and the problems of Ukraine and Gaza remain intractable, it is easy to see that picking a political and economic row with Europe may seem to be an attractive distraction for Republicans.\n\n Nor is it likely that the White House will be mollified by hosting the 2026 World Cup between June 11 and July 19 with rows already raging about the cost of match tickets. Should Ireland qualify, our fans face bills amounting to thousands of euro to follow our team. \n\nSupporters will be well advised to recall the experience of this summer’s Club World Cup where prices plummeted once it became clear that people were unwilling to stump up. Surge pricing can work both ways.\n\n The New Year is traditionally associated with renewed hope, and the best time to contemplate that can be right now, before reality starts to crowd in on us. Take every opportunity to enjoy it while you can.\n\nUK’s lifting of tap limits makes life easier for fraudsters\n\nAmong the baleful anniversaries waiting to be noted in 2026 is one which falls on June 13. That will be 10 years since the British voted to leave the European Union after its then prime minister, David Cameron, and other EU leaders, miscalculated the mood of the country. The UK polled 52-48 to depart although there were wide regional differences in the result.\n\nThis has some serious consequences for our ambitions for a unified Ireland and one small example of the problems it can raise is exemplified by London’s go-ahead for its banking sector to scrap the contactless card limit, which currently stands at £100 (€114).\n\nIts financial conduct authority says this will allow banks from March to respond to changing consumer demands, inflation, and new technology. Banks will be allowed to set their own restrictions including on cumulative spending and the number of contactless taps you can make before you are asked for verification, usually a pin number.\n\nThere are no limits on payments using digital wallets such as Apple Pay, Samsung Pay, and Google Pay because they usually require some form of biometric authentication such as a fingerprint.\n\nThe lifting of the cap will also prevail in the North because it falls within the same regulatory framework as the rest of the UK, but in the Republic the limit for physical debit and credit cards remains at €50 per transaction. Above that limit, the purchase must be completed with chip and pin. There are no plans for a review of the ceiling.\n\nAlmost nine out of every 10 in-store card payments are now contactless and there has also been widespread adoption of mobile wallets. Setting aside this dangerous over-reliance on network technologies, which increasingly show signs of creaking, the ubiquity of this form of commerce is unlikely to be rolled back. And the prospects of harmonisation with our next-door neighbours are dim.\n\nRaising the limit brings with it the depressing prospect of making life easier for fraudsters with worries that criminals who obtain someone else’s contactless card will be able to rack up more ill-gotten gains. A single transaction limit reduces the scope to buy very expensive items and a cumulative lid presses down on total spend.\n\nEqually, we know from increases in shoplifting and mobile phone robbery that relatively petty minor theft can soon scale up to become a major problem.\n\nAt the start of each year, the Central Bank of Ireland issues a report on illicit credit transfers, card payments, e-money, and direct debits. Around 98% of card payment fraud by value occurs when criminals use a stolen card, account or personal information.\n\nThe total value of fraudulent payments rose by 26% in 2023, increasing to €126m from €100m in 2022. Two thirds of the cases involve cross-border transfers. And while the rate is low at 0.001% of all transactions, this is no consolation to a victim. \n\nThis holiday season and beyond, we should practise an updated fin-tech version of the old Michael Corleone aphorism: Keep your friends close, and your cards closer.","summary":"It’s not the loveliest word in the world, but there’s no room for ambiguity in what has become known as Betwixtmas, that often quiet sojourn between Christmas Day and the celebrations of New Year.","url":"https://www.irishexaminer.com/opinion/ourview/arid-41765819.html","image":"https://www.irishexaminer.com/cms_media/module_img/9823/4911911_7_seoimage1x1_BELGIUM_20Martin_20144262.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-27 00:58:00","author":"Irishexaminer.com,South Africa","authors":["Irishexaminer.com","South Africa"],"language":"en","source_country":"ie","sentiment":-0.034},{"id":389318456,"title":"‘He doesn’t have anything until I approve it’: Donald Trump casts himself as final arbiter of Ukraine peace deal; sceptical of Zelenskyy's plan","text":"US President Donald Trump has said any peace deal to end the war between Ukraine and Russia will ultimately depend on his approval, casting himself as the final decision-maker ahead of talks with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in Florida.Speaking in an exclusive interview with Politico on Friday, Trump appeared unenthusiastic about Zelenskyy’s latest peace proposal, a revised 20-point framework that the Ukrainian leader is expected to present during their meeting on Sunday. The plan includes ideas such as a demilitarised zone and requests for US security guarantees.“He doesn’t have anything until I approve it,” Trump said, referring to Zelenskyy’s proposal. “So we’ll see what he’s got.”Zelenskyy has said the meeting will focus on key unresolved issues, including security guarantees, control of the Russian-occupied Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant and territorial questions surrounding the Donbas region in eastern Ukraine. According to the New York Times, Zelenskyy has described the agenda as broad and said “a lot can be decided before the New Year”.Trump’s remarks underline how dependent Kyiv’s future strategy has become on convincing the US president that Ukraine is prepared to compromise. While Washington has pushed Zelenskyy to soften some of his earlier demands, Russia has largely held to its hardline position and has not publicly responded to the latest proposal, reported Politico.Despite his scepticism, Trump said he expected the talks to be constructive. “I think it’s going to go good with him. I think it’s going to go good with [Vladimir] Putin,” he said, adding that he hopes to speak with the Russian president “soon”.The comments came a day after Zelenskyy held discussions with Trump’s special envoy Steve Witkoff and the president’s son-in-law Jared Kushner, which the Ukrainian leader later described as a “good conversation”. As per the New York Times, Zelenskyy said those talks produced “good ideas” and new thinking on formats and timelines for pushing diplomacy forward.Zelenskyy’s proposal includes the creation of a demilitarised zone in parts of Donbas still under Ukrainian control, but only if Russia withdraws its forces from a corresponding area in Donetsk. Moscow has shown no sign of accepting anything short of full control of the region, highlighting the wide gap between the two sides.Trump also said Russia was under economic pressure. “Their economy is in tough shape, very tough shape,” he told Politico.During the interview, Trump confirmed that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu would also visit him this weekend. “I have Zelenskyy and I have Bibi coming. They’re all coming,” he said. “They respect our country again.” According to an NBC report cited by Politico, Netanyahu is expected to brief Trump on the growing threat from Iran.Trump’s remarks followed US airstrikes against ISIS targets in Nigeria, which he said were delayed by a day for symbolic reasons. “I said, ‘nope, let’s give a Christmas present,’” he told Politico, claiming the strikes had heavily damaged militant camps.As diplomacy continues, Zelenskyy has said Ukraine is ready to show flexibility but warned that if Russia refuses to engage seriously, stronger pressure from the West would be needed to bring the war closer to an end, reported the New York Times.","url":"https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/he-doesnt-have-anything-until-i-approve-it-donald-trump-casts-himself-as-final-arbiter-of-ukraine-peace-deal-sceptical-of-zelenskyys-plan/articleshow/126198376.cms","image":"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/resizemode-4,width-1280,height-720,msid-126198383/126198383.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-27 00:57:00","author":"Toi World Desk","authors":["Toi World Desk"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"in","sentiment":-0.015},{"id":389318102,"title":"Venezuela says it frees 99 people held over 2024 election protests","text":"Venezuela says it has freed 99 people who were detained after protests over the 2024 election, in what it calls its biggest prisoner release this year, The Guardian reported. The government says those released were people “deprived of their liberty for their participation in acts of violence and incitement to hatred following the electoral process of 28 July 2024”. It also says the move shows its “commitment to peace” and its “unrestricted respect for human rights”, at a time when it says the country faces “an imperialist siege and multilateral aggression” from the United States. Civil society groups have responded with care. They say the releases help those freed, but are not enough, because many people are still in prison. Rights groups say there are at least 900 political prisoners in the country. Also read ‘Nobody planning to go in and shoot him’: US officials say Donald Trump ready to talk with Nicolas Maduro One group, Justicia, Encuentro y Perdón, said the selective nature of the releases shows that detention is being used “as an instrument of political persecution”. The group said the step has a “positive impact” on those who left prison, but is “clearly insufficient” while hundreds of others remain in custody. Another group, the Committee for the Freedom of Social Fighters and Political Prisoners, said many of the 99 people remain under conditions such as travel bans, court check-ins and limits on speaking to the media. The groups also said they could not yet confirm that 99 people were released and that the real number may be lower. The releases come after a period of tighter controls on opposition voices. In recent weeks, a political scientist, an activist and union leaders were detained. A 17-year-old, Gabriel José Rodríguez Méndez, was sentenced to 10 years in prison after being found guilty of “terrorism” for taking part in protests. Protests broke out after President Nicolás Maduro declared himself the winner of the 2024 vote. The opposition says its candidate, Edmundo González Urrutia, actually won. He is now in exile in Spain. Opposition leader María Corina Machado is also outside the country. The United States, under US President Donald Trump, has increased pressure on Venezuela. The US has deployed around 15,000 troops and a large naval force near the country and says it is blocking sanctioned oil tankers and seizing vessels.

The Wheel, with 3.7million viewers, and Call The Midwife, with 3.4million, also occupied 2025’s top ten.\n\nAnd, in the biggest shock, BBC Weather clocked up 2.8million – outperforming ITV’s top spot The 1% Club, which placed tenth overall with 2.7million viewers.\n\nAs Christmas Day drew to a close, the figures revealed the BBC took out nine of the ten most-watched programmes in a repeat of last year’s dominance.\n\nThe ratings are no doubt going to be a relief for BBC bosses following a deeply challenging period for the controversy-engulfed broadcaster. It has been rocked by high-profile sexual misconduct scandals, including former newsreader Huw Edwards’ conviction for making indecent images of children, and renewed scrutiny over its historic association with Russell Brand, who denies multiple allegations including rape and sexual assault.\n\nAnd the BBC has faced intense backlash over its Panorama coverage of Donald Trump during the 2021 Capitol Riots.\n\nJust ten days before Christmas, the US President filed a $10billion lawsuit after it was found to have doctored his speech during the episode.\n\nThe strong showing for Strictly also comes after what has been regarded as a challenging year for the fan-favourite show following months of scrutiny and investigations into drug-use and misconduct behind the scenes.\n\nThe festive episode saw hosts Tess Daly and Claudia Winkleman sign off from the programme. Dressed in festive white and cream outfits, Daly, 56, and Winkleman, 53, shared an emotional hug and dance while the celebrity contestants applauded.\n\nBringing the show to a close, Daly told viewers: ‘Thank you again for watching us over the years. It has truly meant the world to us.’\n\nGogglebox star Scarlett Moffatt, 35, and pro partner Vito Coppola, 33, were crowned Christmas champions after earning a perfect score of 40 for their cha cha cha.\n\nAll Saints singer Melanie Blatt, 50, who also performed on the Christmas special, has reportedly taken a major step towards replacing Daly and Winkleman.\n\nThe duo announced their exits in a joint video on Instagram in October, saying the time had come to ‘pass over the baton’.","summary":"The Beeb occupied nine of the top ten spots for the most-watched festive television shows, with even its weather forecast trumping ITV's best-viewed programme.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/tv/article-15415149/BBC-Christmas-ratings-war-ITV-fire-broadcaster-despite-scandals.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/12/27/00/105038013-0-image-a-5_1766796338464.jpg","video":"https://videos.dailymail.co.uk/video/mol/2025/12/26/1343716311538158542/1024x576_MP4_1343716311538158542.mp4","publish_date":"2025-12-27 00:49:44","author":"Editor,Molly Clayton","authors":["Editor","Molly Clayton"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":0.103},{"id":389317512,"title":"Rogue hegemons are sabotaging the global economy","text":"Although 2025 will probably be remembered as the year that US President Donald Trump upended the global trading system, the truth is that both of the world’s hegemons, the United States and China, have gone rogue. Surging US protectionism and resurgent Chinese mercantilism are now twin scourges afflicting the rest of the world, especially developing countries.\n\nWhile some apply the label “G-Zero” to today’s leaderless world, it is more accurate to say that we are dealing with a “G-Negative-Two” world. Instead of providing global public goods, China and the US are inflicting global economic costs, and they are doing so in mutually reinforcing ways.\n\nIn some sense, Chinese mercantilism begat US protectionism. Trump’s long-standing tariff obsession derives from his fury-fueled conviction that trade surpluses abroad have damaged the US economy, especially its manufacturing sector. In that world view, China, with its consistently large trade surpluses, was the provocateur-in-chief, even though in practice more countries have been targeted.\n\nLiberating tariffs\n\nTrump’s “Liberation Day” tariffs in April, and the tumultuous iterations that followed, have made the US one of the world’s most protectionist economies. On average, tariffs on exports of goods to the world’s largest market have jumped from just over 2 per cent to 17 per cent, an eightfold increase. Not only has access to US markets been constrained, but it is also radically more uncertain, because tariffs have become an instrument for indulging the President’s erratic whims and furthering private interests.\n\nIn lawsuits challenging Trump’s justification for such sweeping tariffs, the Supreme Court has signalled that it will not second-guess the executive’s authority to determine what qualifies as a threat to national security. Never mind that the same authority has been (implicitly) invoked to target Brazil for baldly political reasons, and to punish India for contradicting Trump’s claim to have brokered the peace in its border skirmish with Pakistan in May. Restraining such an arbitrary and absurd exercise of presidential authority is surely the Court’s core responsibility. But even if it does rule against Trump, he will have other ways to pursue the same protectionist agenda, and US trading partners will still be operating in a fog of uncertainty.\n\nTo be sure, the direct impact of Trump’s tariffs on other countries has been obscured by other developments in the US economy, notably the AI boom, which has propped up demand and imports. But there have also been indirect effects, and chief among these is Chinese mercantilism.\n\nOf course, mercantilism has been etched in China’s economic DNA for centuries. The Financial Times recently reported that China is making trade impossible because “there is nothing it wants to import, nothing it does not believe it can make better and cheaper.” It was an echo of 1793, when Imperial Britain’s emissary, Lord Macartney, visited China to persuade Emperor Qianlong to open the Chinese market to British goods.\n\nIn response, the emperor boasted: “Our Celestial Empire possesses all things in prolific abundance and lacks no product within its own borders. There is therefore no need to import the manufactures of outside barbarians in exchange for our own produce. But as the tea, silk and porcelain which the Celestial Empire produces, are absolute necessities to European nations and to yourselves, we have permitted, as a signal mark of favour, that foreign hongs [merchant firms] should be established at Canton, so that your wants might be supplied and your country thus participate in our beneficence.”\n\nChinese import aversion\n\nNot only can we discern a similar attitude today, but Chinese mercantilism has been aggravated by Trump’s tariffs. With access to US markets reduced and the Chinese growth model still so dependent on exports, the Chinese juggernaut has turned its focus to conquering markets elsewhere, especially in South-East Asia. Proximate economic necessity has supercharged a deep-seated predilection.\n\nAs Shoumitro Chatterjee and I have documented, China’s exports of low-value-added goods to developing countries have been rising sharply, undermining the competitiveness of these countries’ own domestic industries. Despite rising wages, China still accounts for a large share of global exports, including in areas where it should have ceded space to poorer countries. Moreover, it is becoming increasingly clear that China’s exports are not the result of some natural advantage; rather, they are being sustained by its exchange-rate policy. As Brad Setser of the Council on Foreign Relations and others have argued, the renminbi is undervalued by about 20 per cent.\n\nThus, while the Trump tariffs exacerbate China’s mercantilism, developing countries are opting for another round of protectionism to shield their domestic industries from the Chinese onslaught. Mexico, for example, has just imposed tariffs on goods from China and India. But while other countries are seeking to shield themselves from China, targeting only one country is difficult in today’s world of complex supply chains. Inevitably, protectionism will become a broader phenomenon.\n\nWhat does this tell us about the near-term future? In recent research, Dev Patel, Justin Sandefur, and I find that the heady convergence of developing countries toward Western standards of living stalled in the last decade. Slowing growth in the developing world has coincided with the reversal of globalisation. Exports of low-value-added manufacturing products such as textiles, apparel, and furniture are the engine of development. If it stalls, the poorest people in the poorest parts of the world will be the first victims, and the blame will lie with the world’s two hegemons.\n\nThe US and China have more in common than they would like to believe. Both are hijacking the global economy and limiting trading opportunities for everyone else.\n\nThe writer is a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics.

In the letter, Grenell said he would seek $1 million in damages “for this political stunt.” Redd did not immediately respond to a request for comment. A drummer and vibraphone player, Redd has presided over holiday “Jazz Jams” at the Kennedy Center since 2006, succeeding bassist William “Keter” Betts. In an email Wednesday to The Associated Press, Redd said he pulled out of the concert in the wake of the renaming. “When I saw the name change on the Kennedy Center website and then hours later on the building, I chose to cancel our concert,” Redd said. President John F. Kennedy was assassinated in 1963, and Congress passed a law the following year naming the center as a living memorial to him. According to the White House, Trump’s handpicked board approved the renaming, which scholars have said violates the law. Kennedy niece Kerry Kennedy has vowed to remove Trump’s name from the building once he leaves office, and former House historian Ray Smock is among those who say any changes would have to be approved by Congress. The law explicitly prohibits the board of trustees from making the center into a memorial to anyone else, and from putting another person’s name on the building’s exterior.","url":"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/trump-administration/kennedy-center-chuck-redd-christmas-eve-concert-trump-name-added-rcna251085","image":"https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-1500w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-12/251226-Chuck-Redd-aa-729-2348eb.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-27 00:35:55","author":"The Associated Press","authors":["The Associated Press"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.065},{"id":389318184,"title":"Trump demands DOJ release Epstein names, calls probe a witch hunt hoax","text":"With renewed focus on the Epstein files, US President Donald Trump attacked the Justice Department, demanding it release the names of Democrats he says were linked to Jeffrey Epstein and calling the case a “Democrat inspired hoax.”In a post on Truth Social, Trump reacted to the department’s announcement that more than one million additional documents linked to Epstein had been discovered and would require further review. “Now 1,000,000 more pages on Epstein are found,” Trump wrote, accusing the DOJ of being “forced to spend all of its time on this Democrat inspired Hoax.”“When do they say NO MORE, and work on Election Fraud etc.,” he added. “The Dems are the ones who worked with Epstein, not the Republicans. Release all of their names, embarrass them, and get back to helping our Country!”.preferred-source-banner{ margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom:10px;}Trump framed the renewed focus on Epstein as politically motivated, saying it was designed to distract from what he called “TRUMP & REPUBLICAN SUCCESS.” “Just another Witch Hunt!!!” he wrote.The comments followed a lengthy Christmas Day post in which Trump said he cut ties with Epstein long before it became fashionable, while accusing Democrats and the media of trying to pin the scandal on him. In that post, he described the investigation as a “Radical Left Witch Hunt” and claimed Democrats who once associated with Epstein had “dropped him like a dog” when scrutiny intensified.The renewed controversy comes after Congress last month passed a bipartisan bill, later signed by Trump, requiring the US Department of Justice to release all unclassified records related to Epstein within 30 days. The deadline was December 19.The DOJ released an initial tranche of hundreds of thousands of documents last Friday and has published more in the days since. The materials include references to Trump as well as former President Bill Clinton, among others.Lawmakers from both parties, however, have criticised the department for not releasing all records and questioned the scope of some redactions.On Wednesday, the Justice Department said officials in New York had uncovered more than one million additional documents potentially linked to the Epstein case, warning that reviewing and releasing them could take “a few more weeks.”- EndsPublished By: Aashish VashisthaPublished On: Dec 27, 2025Tune InMust Watch","url":"https://www.indiatoday.in/world/us-news/story/trump-demands-doj-release-epstein-names-calls-probe-a-witch-hunt-hoax-glbs-2842435-2025-12-27","image":"https://akm-img-a-in.tosshub.com/indiatoday/images/story/202512/jeffrey-epstein-donald-trump-245539189-16x9_3.jpeg?VersionId=MsyX6FNp1s1DJMka.nHfs9WkygzNstQQ?size=1280:720","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-27 00:34:29","author":"India Today World Desk","authors":["India Today World Desk"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"in","sentiment":-0.676},{"id":389318092,"title":"Bhagyashree shares her quick 2-step upper and lower body workout routine","text":"Bhagyashree shares her quick 2-step upper and lower body workout routine Lifestyle \n 16 min ago\n\n This is an AI assisted summary.\n\n Bhagyashree's 2-step workout video offers a convenient and efficient way to stay on track during the holidays.

Edgar Hoover Building, which houses the FBI's main headquarters in Washington, D.C., will permanently close.\nThe agency’s main headquarters will move to an already existing building roughly half a mile from the current site.\n\n “After more than 20 years of failed attempts, we finalized a plan to permanently close the FBI’s Hoover headquarters and move the workforce into a safe, modern facility,” Patel wrote on X on Friday, Dec. 26, stating that the agency “accomplished what no one else could” with the cooperation of President Donald Trump and Congress.\n\n “When we arrived, taxpayers were about to be on the hook for nearly $5 billion for a new headquarters that wouldn’t open until 2035,” Patel, 45, claimed, adding that the FBI will now relocate headquarters to “the already-existing Reagan Building, saving billions and allowing the transition to begin immediately with required safety and infrastructure upgrades already underway.”\n\n “This decision puts resources where they belong: defending the homeland, crushing violent crime, and protecting national security. It delivers better tools for today’s FBI workforce at a fraction of the cost,” he wrote.\n\n Patel did not share a specific date for the relocation.\n\n Patel, a former prosecutor and podcaster, previously voiced his displeasure with the J. Edgar Hoover Building, and once declared that he would shut the site down and convert it into a “museum of the Deep State” if ever given the opportunity.\n\n “The FBI’s footprint has gotten too friggin’ big,” he said during an appearance on the Shawn Ryan Show in 2023.\n\n Never miss a story — sign up for PEOPLE's free daily newsletter to stay up-to-date on the best of what PEOPLE has to offer​​, from celebrity news to compelling human interest stories.\n\n “And the biggest problem the FBI [comes] out of its intel shops.

And I’d take the 7,000 people who work in that building and send them across America to go and chase criminals... What do you need 7,000 people there for?”\n\n The J. Edgar Hoover Building has served as the agency’s main headquarters since 1975. \n\n In March, the Trump administration cancelled existing plans to build a new FBI headquarters in Maryland, citing high costs, a lengthy construction schedule and a need for FBI headquarters to remain near the Department of Justice (DOJ). Critics of the decision said the proposed Maryland facility would have featured much-needed, state-of-the-art security features, which they argued could not be achieved by merely updating an older facility.","summary":"The building has served as the agency's main headquarters for 50 years","url":"https://people.com/fbi-director-kash-patel-announces-permanent-closure-j-edgar-hoover-building-11876559","image":"https://people.com/thmb/pbpsfUwBfTgRkr88-I2HG_q31-4=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(739x205:741x207)/kash-patel-j-edgar-hoover-building-122625-351b4262741b4a65b4c0963e75d6b4c1.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-27 00:17:43","author":"Toria Sheffield","authors":["Toria Sheffield"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.205},{"id":389315212,"title":"Trump reveals potential Kennedy Center marble armrests 'unlike anything ever done or seen before'","text":"President Donald Trump teased potential new marble armrests that could be used for seats at the Trump Kennedy Center.

See the impact of his tariffs, in four charts","text":"Since returning to the White House in January, President Donald Trump has overturned decades of U.S. trade policy — building a wall of tariffs around what used to be a wide open economy.\n\nHis double-digit taxes on imports from almost every country have disrupted global commerce and strained the budgets of consumers and businesses worldwide. They have also raised tens of billions of dollars for the U.S. Treasury.\n\nTrump has argued that his steep new import taxes are necessary to bring back wealth that was “stolen” from the U.S. He says they will narrow America’s decades-old trade deficit and bring manufacturing back to the country. But upending the global supply chain has proven costly for households facing rising prices. The taxes are paid by importers who typically attempt to pass along the higher costs to their customers. That includes businesses and ultimately, U.S. households.\n\nAnd the erratic way the president rolled out his tariffs — announcing them, then suspending or altering them before conjuring up new ones — made 2025 one of the most turbulent economic years in recent memory.\n\nHere’s a look at the impact of Trump’s tariffs over the last year, in four charts.\n\nEffective US tariff rate\n\nA key number for the overall impact of tariffs on U.S. consumers and businesses is the “effective” tariff rate — which, unlike headline figures imposed by Trump for specific trade actions, provides an average based on the actual imports coming into the country.\n\nIn 2025, per data from the Yale Budget Lab, the effective U.S. tariff rate peaked in April. But it’s still far higher than the average seen at the start of the year. Before finalizing shifts in consumption, November’s effective tariff rate was nearly 17% — seven times greater than January’s average and the highest seen since 1935.\n\nTariff revenue vs America’s trade deficit\n\nAmong selling points to justify his tariffs, Trump has repeatedly said they would reduce America’s longstanding trade deficit and bring revenue into the Treasury.\n\nTrump’s higher tariffs are certainly raising money. They’ve raked in more than $236 billion this year through November — much more than in years past. But they still account for just a fraction of the federal government’s total revenue. And they haven’t raised nearly enough to justify the president’s claim that tariff revenue could replace federal income taxes — or allow for windfall dividend checks for Americans.\n\nThe U.S. trade deficit, meanwhile, has fallen significantly since the start of the year. The trade gap peaked to a monthly record of $136.4 billion in March, as consumers and businesses hurried to import foreign products before Trump could impose his tariffs on them. The trade gap narrowed to $52.8 billion in September, the latest month for which data is available. But the year-to-date deficit was still running 17% ahead of January-September 2024.\n\nImport shifts with America’s biggest trading partners\n\nTrump’s 2025 tariffs hit nearly every country in the world — including America’s biggest trading partners. But his policies have had the biggest impact on U.S. trade with China, once the biggest source of American imports and now No. 3 behind Canada and Mexico. U.S. tariffs on Chinese imports now come to 47.5%, according to calculations by Chad Bown of the Peterson Institute for International Economics.\n\nThe value of goods coming into the U.S. from China fell nearly 25% during the first three-quarters of the year. Imports from Canada also dropped. But the value of products from Mexico, Vietnam and Taiwan grew year-to-date.\n\nMarket swings\n\nFor investors, the most volatile moments on the stock market this year arrived amid some of the most volatile moments for Trump’s tariffs.\n\nThe S&P 500, an index for the biggest public companies in the U.S., saw its biggest daily and weekly swings in April — and largest monthly losses and gains in March and June, respectively.\n\nNeed a recap of how Trump’s trade actions unfolded in 2025?

Wary of failed guarantees from allies in the past, Ukraine is seeking robust and legally binding deals to prevent further Russian aggression. Zelenskiy said his meeting with Trump aimed to \"refine things\" in the drafts and to discuss potential deals on Ukraine&apos;s economy. He added that he was not ready to say if any ‌deal would be signed during ​his visit, but Ukraine was open to it. Trump said he believed the meeting was going to go well, while he expected to speak to Russian President ‍Vladimir Putin \"soon, as much as I want.\" Territorial issues remain a hurdle to negotiations moving forward. \"As for the sensitive issues: We will discuss both Donbas and the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant.

The proposal gave no details on how the ‌zone would function.

Trump, who has at times expressed frustration with the slow pace of progress in the negotiations, previously ‍suggested that he would meet with Zelenskiy if he felt that a major diplomatic advance was possible. European leaders might join the talks online, according to Zelenskiy. On Friday, he discussed preparations for the Sunday meeting and progress in talks with some European leaders, including NATO chief Mark Rutte and Finnish President Alexander Stubb, who is seen as close to Trump. Russian Deputy Foreign Minister ​Sergei ​Ryabkov said Kyiv&apos;s version of the 20-point plan was radically different from what Russia has ​been discussing with the US, according to Interfax-Russia.

Nearly a decade on from the EU referendum, Paul Nowak said both Leavers and Remainers have moved past old divisions and wanted the botched Tory Brexit deal to be fixed. Mr Nowak said a UK-EU customs union should be on the table, which would allow tariff-free trade in exchange for common standards for traded goods. His comments came after Wes Streeting broke ranks with Keir Starmer by appearing to endorse a customs union deal with the bloc. In an interview with the Mirror , Mr Nowak said: “It doesn't come down to politics - or whether you voted Brexit or you voted Remain. “What it comes down to is having the best possible working relationship with our most important trading partner, and that relationship even more important in light of the uncertainty caused by [Donald] Trump in the White House. Whether it's tariffs or his broader approach to global politics, it's important we have a close working relationship with our European partners.” The TUC General Secretary added: “We've always been clear that the Government should be prepared to look at every option, up to and including a customs union. It’s about ideology for us or about politics. It's about what works best for people working in automotive, in aerospace, in chemicals, where we need to have those supply chains that stretch across it into Europe, and we need frictionless trade with Europe. “It makes a difference to ordinary working people as well. In terms of the prices we're paying in the supermarket, there has undoubtedly been a Brexit effect in terms of the cost of that weekly shop.” The TUC leader dismissed lingering Brexit divisions and said it was common sense to pursue a closer trading relationship. He said: “Everybody knows the Tories left us a botched Brexit deal, and the big job now is making sure we fix that and get the best possible deal that we can. \"That's the right thing to do for working people in this country. It's not about politics, and it's certainly not about re-running the referendum. It's just about saying this is our most important trading partner. We want the best possible relationship with them.” He added: “It’s important economically, important politically, and increasingly in terms of national security as well, because Donald Trump has proved himself to be an unreliable partner. We need to work closely with Europe economically, but also in terms of Ukraine and other issues as well.”","summary":"Nearly a decade on from the EU referendum, TUC General Secretary Paul Nowak said Leavers and Remainers have moved past old divisions and want the botched Tory Brexit deal fixed","url":"https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/politics/hold-ditch-brexit-divisions-forge-36445102","image":"https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/article36457269.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200b/1_US-POLITICS-TRUMP.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-27 00:01:00","author":"Lizzy Buchan","authors":["Lizzy Buchan"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":0.214},{"id":389314212,"title":"Trump’s Christmas missiles strike fear in northern Nigeria","text":"Residents of Sokoto and Kwara on Friday recounted moments of fear and confusion after missile strikes fired by the United States of America hit areas in the two states, triggering panic in the communities.\n\nSaturday PUNCH, however, confirmed from military sources and residents that the strikes recorded no casualties.\n\nMassive explosion was recorded on Thursday night in Jabo town, Tambuwal Local Government Area of Sokoto State, while two separate explosions rocked Offa, Kwara State, a few hours after the Sokoto strike.\n\nOur correspondents gathered that there was another explosion at Tangaza LGA of Sokoto.\n\nTrump announces strikes\n\nUS President Donald Trump announced the strikes in a post on his Truth Social platform on Thursday night.\n\nHe disclosed that US forces conducted deadly strikes against Islamic State terrorists in Northwestern Nigeria.\n\n“Tonight, at my direction as Commander in Chief, the United States launched a powerful and deadly strike against ISIS terrorist scum in Northwest Nigeria, who have been targeting and viciously killing, primarily, innocent Christians, at levels not seen for many years, and even centuries! I have previously warned these terrorists that if they did not stop the slaughtering of Christians, there would be hell to pay, and tonight, there was,” he wrote.\n\nAlthough Trump did not specifically reveal the targeted areas, the US Africa Command, in a post on its X handle, confirmed that the strikes were carried out in Sokoto State.\n\nThe strikes came after Trump in October threatened a US military intervention in Nigeria over what he described as the government’s failure to curb violence targeting Christian communities.\n\nTrump, who declared Nigeria a Country of Particular Concern, threatened to go into Nigeria ‘guns a-blazing’.\n\nNo casualties\n\nSaturday PUNCH gathered that the US missile attacks might not have involved any casualty.\n\nA senior military official told one of our correspondents on Friday that no terrorist was killed.\n\nThe official, who asked not to be named because he was not authorised to speak to the press, said the operation involved shelling believed to have been launched from a naval vessel.\n\n“The US is here; they said they were going after an ISIS target but they fired blank yesterday after their operation. There was no terrorist killed or arrested,” he said.\n\nAnother military source familiar with the operation told our correspondent that several strikes were launched, but most of the individuals and groups targeted were missed.\n\nHe disclosed that the actual damage inflicted remained mostly unknown.\n\nThe source, however, hinted that more strikes were being planned in the coming days.\n\nAlso, a security analyst for East and West Africa, Brant Philip, in a post on X, wrote, “This was likely a symbolic start to official US operations in Nigeria, which began on Christmas Day. The operational results of the strikes are not significant, but much is expected soon, not only in the northwest but in the northeast as well. The coming strikes are also expected to be carried out by an American UAV, probably an MQ-9 Reaper drone.”\n\nAlso speaking on the matter, another security analyst and Chief Executive Officer of Beacon Consulting, Kabiru Adamu, said he learnt that similar strikes occurred in Offa, Kwara State.\n\nHe stated that neither Jabu in Sokoto, nor Offa in Kwara, was known as a base for terrorists.\n\nAdamu, who hails from Tambuwal LGA, where Jabu is located, said residents confirmed that there were no casualties or arrests.\n\n“In the case of Jabu, I spoke with a traditional ruler there. In fact, not a single soul was killed. So, no arrest and no killing,” he added.\n\nHe questioned the choice of locations for the strikes, noting that known strongholds of armed groups were not targeted.\n\nAdamu advised that future counter-terrorism operations should rely on improved intelligence, including better human intelligence networks to identify suspects and their movements.\n\n“In intelligence, you use a combination of elements, human as well as technological. The human ones would help pinpoint exact locations. So, before you even use the intelligence, you need to be able to identify the bad actors, “ he added.\n\nDeath claims\n\nMeanwhile, the New York Times, while quoting the US Africa Command, claimed that multiple terrorists were killed in the strikes.\n\nAFRICOM, in its initial assessment of the strike concluded that “multiple” ISIS terrorists were killed.\n\nAccording to the report, the strike involved more than a dozen Tomahawk cruise missiles fired off a Navy ship in the Gulf of Guinea, hitting insurgents in two ISIS camps in Sokoto State.\n\nAlso, officials of Tangaza LGA in Sokoto State told Saturday PUNCH that the strikes were carried out on suspected hideouts of the Lakurawa group.\n\nAccording to the officials, the operation targeted multiple Lakurawa enclaves and took place between 10pm and 12.15am, affecting Warriya and Alkasim villages in Tangaza LGA.\n\nTangaza, which shares a border with the Niger Republic, has in recent times witnessed repeated attacks attributed to the Lakurawa group, described by security sources as foreign-linked bandits operating across border communities.\n\nThe Lakurawa group is believed to be affiliated with the Islamic State Sahel Province, with operational presence across parts of Mali, Niger, Kebbi and Sokoto states.\n\nThe group has been blamed for many deadly attacks in the region, prompting sustained counter-terrorism operations by Nigerian security forces.\n\nTinubu sanctioned strikes – FG \n\nThe Federal Government confirmed on Friday ongoing security and intelligence cooperation between Nigeria and the US following the strikes.\n\nThe spokesperson for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Kimiebi Ebienfa, said Nigerian authorities remained engaged in “structured security cooperation with international partners, including the United States of America,” to address terrorism and violent extremism in the country.\n\nThe ministry said the collaboration, which led to precision airstrikes on terrorist targets, involved intelligence sharing, strategic coordination and other forms of support in line with international law, respect for Nigeria’s sovereignty and shared security commitments.\n\nSpeaking with CNN, the Minister of Foreign Affairs, Yusuf Tuggar, disclosed that the attacks were sanctioned by President Tinubu, insisting that they were not in violation of Nigeria’s sovereignty or territorial integrity.\n\nHe said, “Terrorists are being targeted, this has always been Nigeria’s approach and this also put to rest any doubt with regards to the Tinubu’s administration resolve to fight terrorism.\n\n“This was coordinated with the US, the same way we have been saying that we are ready, willing and able to collaborate and coordinate with any foreign government that is committed to the fight against terrorism. This is not about religion, it is about Nigerians, innocent civilians and the wider region as a whole.\n\n“Even before the strike was carried out, I had a 19 minutes phone call with the US Secretary of State, Marco Rubio, after which I discussed with President Tinubu and I later spoke again to President Tinubu; he gave the go ahead and Marco Rubio called me once more for five minutes discussion and subsequently, the attacks were carried out.\n\nWhen asked if Nigeria was prepared to allow US ground troops operate in the country, Tuggar said, “These are operational issues that will have to be considered by our military. I’m heading the ministry of foreign affairs and diplomacy and it is something the ministry of defence and some of our security agencies will be in a better position to respond to.”\n\nA top government source confirmed that the US strikes hit Sokoto and Kwara communities.\n\nThe source also confirmed that there was no record of casualties yet.\n\n“But in the coming days, records will be taken to know if anyone died in the airstrikes,” the source added.\n\nSokoto residents recount ‘horrific’ night\n\nMeanwhile, residents of Jabo town and Offa, have recounted the horrifying moments of the explosions.\n\nEyewitnesses described the sound as loud, sudden, and unfamiliar.\n\nThe Sarkin Burmin Jabo and district head of the town, Alhaji Aliyu Garba Jabo, said he was in his palace with his family when the explosion occurred.\n\n“We heard a very loud sound,” he said. “At first, we thought it was a plane crash. People were frightened because it was something we had never experienced before.”\n\nWhen residents later moved towards the area from which the sound originated, they discovered scattered fragments behind a hospital, extending into nearby farmlands.\n\nThe remnants appeared metallic, with aluminum-like pieces visible on the ground.\n\nSecurity officials later cordoned off parts of the area, while soldiers evacuated some of the rubble.\n\nThe anti-bomb squad of the Nigeria Police Force, Sokoto State Command, was subsequently deployed in the scene to begin technical investigations.\n\n“We cannot conclusively say what kind of device it was,” the district head said.\n\n“There are markings and numbers on some of the remnants, and only security agencies can determine where it came from.”\n\nAnother resident, Lukman Maikagara, said immediately the blast happened, residents rushed to the scene to confirm the magnitude of the incident.\n\nHe said the fire which followed the blast lasted for over one hour, which made people scared.\n\nDespite the explosion, no deaths or injuries were recorded.\n\nSaturday PUNCH also gathered that no houses were destroyed, though some farmlands were affected.\n\n“My family farm is among the affected areas,” a farmer, Jabo, said. “But we give thanks to God that no life was lost.”\n\nKwara residents count losses\n\nIn Offa, eyewitnesses told Saturday PUNCH that the first blast occurred around the Eid praying ground area in Offa, where several residential buildings were damaged.\n\nThe second incident was recorded near Solid Worth Hotel, about a five-minute walk from the first location.\n\nAlthough no deaths were officially recorded, several residents sustained injuries, while property worth millions of naira was destroyed, leaving victims stranded and traumatised.\n\nResidents said they were jolted out of their sleep by a loud explosion that shook buildings and sent debris flying in different directions.\n\n“It was like a war scene,” a resident said.\n\n“People were screaming and running in different directions because nobody knew what was happening.”\n\nSources said an undetonated explosive object was later discovered at the second location near Solid Worth Hotel, prompting security agencies to immediately cordon off the affected areas and restrict movement.\n\nA resident said he narrowly escaped death after his room collapsed on him.\n\n“Yesterday around 10pm, I was already sleeping when I just heard a loud noise,” Soliu recounted.\n\n“When I opened my eyes, the wall of my room had collapsed and my roof was blown open, but I managed to crawl out under the rubble.”\n\nSoliu said he sustained injuries during the incident.\n\n“I was injured. A block fell on my chest,” he added.\n\nHe said he returned to the scene the next morning to salvage his belongings but found an unfamiliar object among the debris.\n\n“Some people said it’s part of a missile that was shot by the US yesterday, but I don’t know,” he said.\n\nSoliu said he lost virtually everything he owned.\n\n“The LGA chairman came last night and told us the government was on top of the situation. I have lost the little things I call properties. Everything was destroyed.\n\n“Only a few clothes I was able to pick. I don’t even have money to take myself to a hospital for treatment. My chest is still hurting me, and I have bruises on my leg too,” he lamented.\n\nA furniture maker whose workshop was destroyed, Alaba Awodele, said he received a distress call shortly after the incident.\n\n“I got a call around a few minutes past 10pm that a bomb had been thrown into my shop,” he said.\n\n“I was surprised. Bomb? How come? When I rushed here, I couldn’t believe what I saw. I never imagined that such a thing could happen in Offa.”\n\nAwodele said the explosion destroyed his machines and furniture meant for delivery.\n\n“Even as I am talking to you, I am confused. This thing destroyed some of my machines. The goods I wanted to deliver to someone moving into a new house to celebrate the New Year have been destroyed.\n\n“I don’t even know what to do now,” he said.\n\nSimilarly, Mary Oyagbile, who owns a fashion design shop in the affected building, said the incident wiped out her business.\n\n“I just got calls from my neighbours that they had thrown a bomb into the shop,” she said.\n\n“When I got here, all my machines and my freezer had been destroyed. Only God and the government can help us.”\n\nAnother survivor, Quadri Saka, said he escaped with bruises because he was not inside the house when the explosion occurred.\n\n“I told my mum I wanted to go and buy a recharge card. She was hesitant because it was late,” he said.\n\n“However, as I was returning, I just heard a loud noise. An object scratched my ears, and I found myself on the ground covered in dust.”\n\nSaka said he rushed home after regaining consciousness.\n\n“When I noticed that our house had collapsed and my mum was inside, I rushed in. I saw her on the floor, shaken and terrified. I was able to bring her out through the back of the house. We thank God for saving our lives.”\n\nHe dismissed speculations that helicopters or aircraft flew over the area before the explosion.\n\n“It just happened suddenly,” he said.\n\nCorroborating her son’s account, a visibly shaken Moromoke Saka said she was asleep when the wall collapsed.\n\n“I just heard a loud noise and part of the roof fell down. The wall also fell just inches from where I was lying,” she said.\n\n“I couldn’t move due to shock. I was just shouting ‘Allahu’ and calling my son’s name. Everywhere was dusty. Few minutes later, my son came and dragged me out. I give thanks to God.”\n\nSaturday PUNCH also visited Solid Worth Hotel, the site of the second incident, where operations had been suspended.\n\nAn engineer at the hotel, Surajudeen Adewale, described the incident as terrifying.\n\n“It happened like something from the movies, but we thank God there were no casualties,” he said.\n\nAdewale said a staff member was injured and taken to the hospital but had since been discharged.\n\n“This incident is a collateral damage. It has affected our business; as you can see, we have shut down,” he added.\n\n“Immediately it happened, there was pandemonium because no one knew what was going on.\n\n“I don’t know what to call that object, but security people said it was a missile targeted at a particular location and maybe there was a failure in location,” he said.\n\nHowever, a security official, who spoke to Saturday PUNCH on condition of anonymity because he was not authorised to speak, claimed that what struck some of the buildings in Offa was not a conventional bomb but a component of an armed missile.\n\nAccording to the source, the incident occurred hours after a joint US-Nigeria military operation against terrorist targets in Sokoto State.\n\n“You know there was an airstrike by the United States in collaboration with the Nigerian government against terrorists in Sokoto,” the official said.\n\n“The operation involved more than a dozen Tomahawk cruise missiles launched from a US warship from the Gulf of Guinea.\n\n“What was found in Offa was not a bomb but a component of the bomb of the missile launched,” he added.\n\nThe claim, though yet to be officially confirmed, heightened fear among residents, many of whom struggled to understand how a missile component could travel over 540 kilometres from Sokoto to Offa.\n\nWhen contacted, the Police Public Relations Officer of the Kwara State Command, SP Adetoun Ejire-Adeyemi, confirmed the incident but declined to give details, saying investigations were ongoing.\n\nAs of the time of filing this report, neither the Nigerian military nor the US government had issued an official statement linking the Offa explosion to the airstrikes in Sokoto.\n\nADC, Gumi kick against strikes\n\nThe African Democratic Congress has described the strikes as a damning indictment of President Tinubu’s leadership and a clear reflection of the administration’s incompetence and failure to effectively address Nigeria’s worsening security challenges.\n\nThe ADC, in a statement issued on Friday by its National Publicity Secretary, Bolaji Abdullahi, cautioned that allowing foreign forces to conduct direct military operations within Nigeria was unsustainable and could, over time, undermine the country’s strategic interests.\n\nAlso reacting, the former Governor of Sokoto State and Senator representing Sokoto South, Aminu Waziri Tambuwal, urged residents of the state to remain calm.\n\nTambuwal made the call in a statement posted on his verified X (formerly Twitter) handle, amid growing public concern over the circumstances surrounding the reported military action.\n\nIslamic cleric Sheikh Ahmad Gumi has criticised strikes, describing the attacks as potentially polarising and detrimental to national sovereignty.\n\nIn a post on Facebook on Friday, Gumi argued that annihilating terrorists was an Islamic obligation, citing the Prophet Muhammad’s wish to destroy such groups.\n\nHe stressed that such action should be undertaken by “clean, holy hands” rather than foreign powers whose past, he claimed, included killing innocent civilians.\n\nGumi urged the Federal Government to halt military cooperation with the US and instead seek assistance from “neutral countries” such as China, Turkey, and Pakistan.","summary":"US missile strikes hit Sokoto and Kwara, Nigeria, causing panic among residents.

But it’s not just the data—it’s the vibes. Here are 10 reasons why Republicans should probably start emotionally preparing for a rough 2026, because they’re in for a world of hurt. \n\n1. They are losing elections\n\nWe don’t need to look at polls to see that Republicans are already struggling at the ballot box. GOP candidates were utterly routed in this November’s off-year elections, without a single speck of good news to point to. And it wasn’t just the win-loss record. The margins were brutal.\n\nRepublicans had a legitimately strong gubernatorial candidate in New Jersey—someone who narrowly lost the previous cycle and was supposedly running neck-and-neck with his Democratic opponent in the polls—and Jack Ciattarelli ended up losing to Mikie Sherrill by 14 points. \n\nIn an early December Tennessee special election, Democrats outperformed President Donald Trump’s numbers in the district by 13 points. In Miami, Republicans lost the mayor’s race for the first time in 30 years, by nearly 20 points. Four years ago, they won that same seat 79–12.\n\nDemocrats don’t need anything close to those margins to win back the House and Senate in 2026. Results half as good would still produce a GOP wipeout. As one Georgia Republican put it after his party got trounced in special elections, “Our donors aren’t motivated and our voters aren’t either.”\n\n2. Trump is not all there\n\nWe all know Trump isn’t well. His incoherence keeps getting worse. He can’t walk in a straight line. He struggles with stairs. He shows up at events and press conferences with unexplained bruising on his hands. He’s had multiple MRI scans in a single year. He falls asleep on camera. He misses events without explanation, oscillating between somnambulance and mania. \n\nCNN’s medical expert has described Trump’s current state as “jarring.” He is obese, and deeply defensive about all of it, insisting he’s a paragon of physical and mental health.\n\nThe practical result is that Trump is incapable of campaigning effectively for his party. Worse, when he does try, he actively makes things worse. \n\nHe recently went on a short tour to claim he was the “affordability president,” only to spend his time rehashing grievances and mocking concerns about high prices as a “hoax.” He’s an albatross around the GOP’s neck, either unable or unwilling to do what’s necessary to shift the political conversation onto more favorable ground.\n\n3. Trump is on the ballot\n\nAs 2025’s elections have shown, Trump motivates voters to vote against his party. The individual names on the ballot barely matter. For many voters, the only way to register disapproval of Trump is to vote against Republicans, and they’re doing exactly that. With Trump’s approval ratings now lower than they were during the worst moments of his first term, even during his catastrophic response to the COVID-19 pandemic, Republicans are staring down relentless headwinds.\n\n4. Trump isn’t on the ballot\n\nAt the same time, Trump’s most devoted MAGA cultists simply don’t show up to vote when he isn’t personally on the ballot. We saw this in 2018 and again in 2022. Trump can turn out some of the most disengaged voters in the country, but he’s never turned them into reliable Republican voters. Instead, he’s tied them entirely to himself.\n\nDuring the 2024 presidential campaign, Trump told supporters, “In four years, you don’t have to vote again. We’ll have it fixed so good, you’re not gonna have to vote.” Many people interpreted that as a promise to end elections. But it sounded more like pure narcissism—an admission that without Trump himself on the ballot, his supporters wouldn’t bother showing up at all. And he’s perfectly fine with that. \n\n5. Economic sentiment is in the gutter\n\nThe Democratic Party’s 2024 presidential campaign largely boiled down to one argument: The economy is doing great. And by the numbers, it was—low unemployment, easing post-COVID inflation, and wage growth outpacing inflation. But that’s not how most people felt, especially those who are lower on the economic ladder.\n\nTrump and Republicans capitalized on that disconnect, winning poorer voters for the first time while Democrats carried voters making over $100,000. But instead of locking in those gains by actually delivering for working-class Americans, Trump and the GOP immediately pivoted back to tax cuts for billionaires, while pushing tariffs and mass deportations that are inherently inflationary.\n\nNow prices are rising again, unemployment and underemployment are creeping up, and Trump is insisting everything is fine. He’s repeating former President Joe Biden’s biggest political mistake—telling people they’re wrong about their own lived experience.\n\nThat doesn’t just alienate voters: It enrages them. Nobody likes being gaslit, and that anger helped fuel Democratic victories in 2025. As Democrats make affordability central to their 2026 messaging, Trump is actively making their job easier by denying voters’ reality.\n\n6. The polls are suspect\n\nEven in the polls—where Republicans usually find comfort—the numbers include warning signs. On the generic congressional ballot, GOP support remains stuck in the low- to mid-40s, but only lagging Democrats by a few points. Under normal circumstances, that might look competitive.\n\nBut this year, polling has consistently overstated Republican performance. In election after election, Democrats have outperformed their polling averages, often by wide margins. That gap matters. It suggests Republican support is soft, conditional, or simply not translating into actual votes.\n\nIn other words, the problem isn’t just that Republicans are polling poorly—it’s that even their best-case numbers aren’t materializing on Election Day. When voters do cast ballots, they’re increasingly ignoring individual candidates and using elections as a blunt instrument to register disapproval of the GOP as a whole. And that’s a dangerous place for any party to occupy heading into a midterm year.\n\n7. A historic level of retirements\n\nA record number of members of Congress are heading for the exits. As of now, 29 Republicans and 24 Democrats have announced retirements. But while Democrats are defending open seats in a relatively friendly environment, Republicans are doing the opposite.\n\nAnd it may get worse. Puck News reports that as many as 20 additional Republicans are expected to announce retirements in coming weeks, as defending a shrinking majority—and endlessly defending Trump—starts to look like a losing proposition.\n\n8. Trump has lost young voters\n\nTrump did alarmingly well with young voters in 2024, winning 43% of them. Many of those voters had no real memory of his first term, having been politically formed by social media posts and right-wing podcast culture rather than lived experience.\n\nThat’s changing fast. A recent Pew poll shows that among voters aged 18 to 34 who backed Trump in 2024, his approval rating was at 94% in February. But when that same group was surveyed again in early August, his approval had collapsed to 69%. Once young voters actually see Trump governing, the shine wears off quickly.\n\n9. Trump has lost Latinos\n\nOnce touted as proof that Trump was making durable gains with Latino voters, Miami’s mayoral election results instead revealed how shallow and transactional that support really was. As Trump’s rhetoric hardened, his deportation policies intensified, and the economic fallout of his agenda became clearer, Latino voters recoiled.\n\nThe GOP’s attempt to reduce the most GOP-friendly Latino voters (Cubans, Nicaraguans, and Venezuelans) to culture-war fodder and anti-socialism warnings collapsed once those voters saw Trump’s policies directly threatening their families, livelihoods, and communities. And if that shift is happening among those core GOP constituencies, what do you think it’ll look like among more traditionally Democratic Latino voters who pulled the lever for Trump out of economic desperation?\n\nWhat looked like a political realignment has turned into a backlash—and Miami is likely the template for what’s coming nationally.\n\n10. MAGA is turning on itself\n\nFinally, the movement is starting to eat its own. The opening shots of a MAGA civil war have already been fired, and Trump is powerless to stop it. They can’t even wait until after the midterms to tear each other apart.\n\nAt the same time, Republicans are stuck managing open extremists like Nick Fuentes and outright Nazis who continue to inflame internal divisions and repel swing voters. The coalition that once looked frighteningly unified is now fracturing in public—and 2026 is approaching fast.","summary":"The data and election results are pretty clear: The GOP is in a rough place.

The action has been taken under China's Anti-Foreign Sanctions Law and will come into effect immediately.\n\nAccording to the ministry, the targeted companies include Northrop Grumman Systems Corporation, L3Harris Maritime Services, Boeing in St. Louis, Gibbs & Cox, Advanced Acoustic Concepts, VSE Corporation, Sierra Technical Services, Red Cat Holdings, Teal Drones, ReconCraft, High Point Aerotechnologies, Epirus, Dedrone Holdings, Area-I, Blue Force Technologies, Dive Technologies, Vantor, Intelligent Epitaxy Technology, Rhombus Power and Lazarus Enterprises.\n\nUnder the sanctions, all movable and immovable assets of these companies located in China will be frozen. Chinese organisations and individuals will also be barred from carrying out business, cooperation or any other dealings with the listed entities.\n\nThe measures also extend to 10 senior executives, including Palmer Luckey, founder of Anduril Industries, and top executives from companies such as L3Harris, VSE Corporation and others. As per the ministry, their assets in China will be restricted, and they will face limits on activities related to China.\n\nBeijing said the US arms sales to Taiwan 'seriously violate the one-China principle and the three China-US Joint Communiques, interfere in China's internal affairs, and undermine China's sovereignty and territorial integrity'.

Beijing warned that it will continue to take 'resolute measures' to protect its sovereignty and security.\n\nThe reaction comes after the administration of US President Donald Trump last week approved a major arms package for Taiwan. According to the US State Department, the proposed sales are valued at over USD 10 billion and include medium-range missiles, howitzers and drones.\n\nThe potential sale of eight arms packages to Taiwan, including HIMARS rocket systems, anti-tank missiles, and drones, at an estimated total cost of USD 11.1 billion, Focus Taiwan stated.\n\nFive of the eight arms packages, the M109A7 howitzers, HIMARS rocket systems, TOW 2B anti-tank missiles, anti-armor drones, and FGM-148 Javelin anti-tank missiles, are covered in an NT$1.25 trillion (US$39.85 billion) special defence budget put forth last month by the Taiwan government, pending lawmakers' review, the Taiwanese news outlet said quoting the country's Defence Ministry.\n\nChina has repeatedly opposed US arms sales to Taiwan and warned that such moves threaten regional peace and stability.

The White House has also said Trump kicked Epstein out of his Mar-a-Lago club for being a “creep.” \n\nThe Trump administration released some of the Epstein files on December 19, a deadline that was set by Congress. \n\nThe administration faced swift pushback over the partial release last week, with critics pointing out that several documents were heavily redacted. \n\nCalifornia Governor Gavin Newsom, a Democrat, trolled the the president by posting a video to X that showed pages of redactions cut with footage of Trump and Epstein talking in the 1990s.\n\n“2025: REDACTED,” Newsom captioned the video.\n\nJustice Department officials later admitted that they discovered more than a million more documents “potentially” tied to Epstein’s case, which could take “a few more weeks” to release. \n\n“We have lawyers working around the clock to review and make the legally required redactions to protect victims, and we will release the documents as soon as possible,” the Justice Department said Wednesday in a statement.\n\nDemocrats on the House Oversight Committee also released a new batch of photos from Epstein’s estate on December 12, which included images of Trump and other powerful figures, including former President Bill Clinton.\n\nTrump and Clinton have not been formally accused of any wrongdoing related to Epstein.","summary":"Trump accused Democrats of having ‘worked with Epstein’ and called on the Justice Department to ‘release all of their names’","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/trump-justice-department-epstein-investigation-names-b2890834.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/12/26/2/00/GettyImages-2253190667.jpg?crop=3054,2036,x28.5,y0&trim=0,29,0,28&width=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/Ih2N0yFO-4VHSaSK0.mp4","publish_date":"2025-12-26 23:58:27","author":"Katie Hawkinson","authors":["Katie Hawkinson"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.511},{"id":389310524,"title":"What is happening at TJ Maxx in Rocky Mount?

As of publication, police and mall authorities have not confirmed the claims, leaving the situation unclear.Social media posts trigger alarmMultiple users on X (formerly Twitter) claimed to have heard gunfire inside the shopping centre housing TJ Maxx in Rocky Mount. One post described family members sheltering inside the store during what was alleged to be an unfolding emergency.“My mom and my entire sisters family are barricaded inside closet of TJ MAXX in Rocky Mount, NC. There is a gunman firing!!! PLEASE PRAY FOR THEM!!”Another message appealed for a swift and safe resolution:“Please protect the innocent people barricaded inside the TJ Maxx in Rocky Mount, NC. Please end this situation as quickly as possible and without any innocent victims. In Jesus’ name we pray,”The posts were widely shared, intensifying concern among local residents and online observers.No official confirmation yet on TJ Maxx ‘Active shooter’At the time of writing, neither the Rocky Mount Police Department nor the shopping centre’s management had issued a public statement confirming a shooting or detailing any response. Authorities have not reported injuries, arrests or the discovery of weapons.The store, located at 1480 Jeffreys Road, is a well-known department retailer offering clothing, accessories and home goods, and is typically busy during daytime hours.Separate mall lockdown elsewhere fuels confusionEarlier on Friday (26 December), WDAM 7 reported that Turtle Creek Mall had been placed on lockdown amid a heavy police presence. The incident occurred in Hattiesburg, but officials later said there was no evidence of shots fired.The city’s public information officer, John Arender, stated that police found no shell casings and no victims.Political backdrop in Rocky MountThe uncertainty comes weeks after US President Donald Trump addressed a rally in Rocky Mount, where he focused on economic messaging.“We’re fixing four years of disaster and decline,” Trump said. “We were a dead country, and now we’re talking about the golden age of America — think of it, in 10 months,” he added.TJ Maxx owner outperforms, signaling more frugal US shopperOn 19 November, TJX Cos. posted sales last quarter above estimates and raised its outlook, signaling that US shoppers are turning to cheaper options as the economy shows signs of stress.The discounter, which runs chains including TJ Maxx and Marshalls, said revenue hit $15.1 billion. Analysts on average expected about $14.9 billion. Its comparable sales topped estimates, too, Bloomberg reported.TJX raised its guidance for comparable sales to a gain of 4% this year, up 1 percentage point from a forecast in August. It also boosted its earnings outlook.Last quarter’s results are “exceptional, especially as they build on a very long run of success,” Neil Saunders, managing director of GlobalData, said in a note to clients. TJX’s performance is being aided by strains on consumers, but the retailer also continues to offer compelling assortments, he said.","url":"https://www.livemint.com/news/us-news/what-is-happening-at-tj-maxx-in-rocky-mount-north-carolina-social-medias-viral-claims-gunman-firing-spark-panic-11766792509545.html","image":"https://www.livemint.com/lm-img/img/2025/12/26/1600x900/logo/BLACK-FRIDAY-SHOPPING-161_1766793145823_1766793165246.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-26 23:55:46","author":"Livemint","authors":["Livemint"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"in","sentiment":-0.191},{"id":389316430,"title":"Zelensky To Meet Trump Tomorrow For Talks On Peace Deal","text":"Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said on Friday that he plans to meet US President Donald Trump in Florida on Sunday, as part of efforts to push forward a peace plan aimed at ending the ongoing war between Russia and Ukraine, CNN reported.Speaking to reporters, Zelenskyy said the meeting could help move discussions closer to a settlement, though he cautioned that no final agreement should be expected immediately. He said both sides would focus on completing as many unresolved points as possible.Zelenskyy also added that the 20-point peace plan proposed by US and Ukrainian officials is 90 per cent ready. He added that talks with Trump would centre on long-term security guarantees for Ukraine and the role of its allies in ensuring stability after the war.CNN reported that there was no immediate confirmation from the White House about the proposed meeting. Zelenskyy's comments come amid renewed diplomatic activity, with Kyiv signalling openness to discussions on issues that have stalled previous negotiations.Earlier in the day, Zelenskyy said in a post on X that Ukraine and the US had agreed to hold a high-level meeting soon, adding that significant decisions could be taken before the New Year.Zelenskyy wrote on X after the latest round of discussions between Ukrainian and US negotiators, \"We have agreed on a meeting at the highest level - with President Trump in the near future. A lot can be decided before the New Year.\"These developments followed talks held on Thursday, when the Ukrainian leader met Trump's special envoy Steve Witkoff and the US president's son-in-law Jared Kushner as part of ongoing consultations.Updating on the substance of those discussions, Zelenskyy noted that several documents forming part of a broader framework aimed at ending the conflict and supporting Ukraine's reconstruction were \"nearly ready\" while others were \"fully prepared\".This diplomatic activity comes after Zelenskyy earlier this week presented a 20-point draft peace plan, which he described as the principal framework for ending the war.While the plan envisages Ukraine receiving security guarantees to deter future Russian aggression, there has been no agreement between Ukraine and the US on territorial issues, as Moscow continues to demand that Kyiv cede territory.In addition to territorial questions, the issue of control over the occupied Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant remains unresolved and subject to further discussions.

But the problem with the left goes beyond that. It's not just their values—it's how they let politics dictate every aspect of their lives.\n\nYou've probably also noticed that Democrats let politics make so many decisions for them. I don’t know how they can do it. Everything from where they shop to where they get a cup of coffee becomes a political act.\n\nBut the rot goes even further.\n\nJust look at left-wing influencer Harry Sisson. He just proved how the left can't even enjoy the Christmas holiday without making it a political act against President Donald Trump. Sisson, clearly thinking he was flexing his anti-Trump bona fides, proved he's just a miserable human being.\n\nHe boasted about using custom “F—k Trump\" Christmas wrapping paper and proudly posting it on X. \"Our wrapping paper for Christmas this year. F—k Trump!\"\n\nSisson's post quickly gained traction on X, having accumulated over 2.5 million views as of this writing and bizarrely 40,000 likes. But most of the comments I've seen come from the right, mocking Sisson's unhealthy obsession with Trump. Of course, he's hardly alone. And this is why the left is so unhappy.\n\nEvery aspect of their lives is rooted in politics, particularly the ugly, hateful side. And they never give it a break, not even on Christmas.\n\nI just don’t get it.\n\nAs someone who comments on politics every day for a living, I mostly want to get away from it when I'm not on the clock. The left hasn't learned that letting politics infiltrate every aspect of their lives is making them miserable, hateful people. Or maybe they do realize it, but they have just become too consumed by the darkness to care anymore. I don’t know. All I know is that when Christmas becomes just another opportunity to broadcast your political grievances, you've lost the plot. There's something profoundly sad about someone who can't wrap presents without making sure everyone knows how much they despise the president.\n\nRelated: Woke Professor Smears ‘It’s A Wonderful Life’ As Racist\n\nEven during the crippling Biden years with sky-high inflation, conservatives didn’t let their political grievances with Joe Biden become the theme of their holiday.\n\nWhy? Because conservatives have figured out something liberals refuse to accept: happiness doesn't come from winning every political battle or forcing the world to conform to your vision. It comes from building a life grounded in something that transcends who occupies the Oval Office.\n\nLiberals could learn a lot from that approach. I wouldn’t bet on it though, because they'd have to admit that maybe, just maybe, their worldview is making them miserable. Good luck with that ever happening.","url":"https://pjmedia.com/matt-margolis/2025/12/26/this-is-why-the-left-is-so-miserable-n4947562","image":"https://media.townhall.com/cdn/hodl/pj/images/up/2025/317/10dc82d8-0cb6-44da-8822-f5880f61c872.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-26 23:52:00","author":"Matt Margolis","authors":["Matt Margolis"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.327},{"id":389311296,"title":"Karoline Leavitt Reveals She's Expecting a Baby Girl in May","text":"Karoline Leavitt is the White House Press Secretary to President Donald Trump.

Trump and the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts.\"\n\n In a post shared to Truth Social on Friday, Dec. 26, the president, 79, featured photos of several white pieces of marble, which he said were being considered for armrests for seating at the performing arts institution in Washington, D.C.\n\n \"Potential Marble armrests for the seating at The Trump Kennedy Center,\" Trump wrote alongside the photos. \"Unlike anything ever done or seen before!\"\n\n Shortly after taking office, Trump seized control of the Kennedy Center by purging the appointed members of the board and installing his own appointees. The Trump-friendly board then established Trump as chairman of the arts organization, which was dedicated in 1964 as a \"living memorial\" to assassinated President John F. Kennedy.\n\n “I want to make sure it runs properly,” Trump said at the time. “We don’t need woke at the Kennedy Center, and we don’t need — some of the shows were terrible.

Kennedy Memorial Center for the Performing Arts.\"\n\n White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt announced on the previous day that the board of the historic venue had \"voted unanimously\" to rename the building to the \"Trump-Kennedy Center.\"\n\n The Kennedy Center was established by an act of Congress, and Trump's critics have argued in recent days that only Congress is authorized to formally change its name.\n\n Even so, the Kennedy Center almost immediately updated its logo on the website and social media to read \"The Trump Kennedy Center,\" and the next day, Trump's name was added to the signage on the building's exterior.\n\n In her Dec. 18 statement about the newly named \"Trump Kennedy Center,\" Leavitt claimed that the institution's MAGA-aligned board \"voted unanimously\" to rename the center. However, Democratic Rep. Joyce Beatty, an ex officio member of the Kennedy Center board who has an automatic vote because of her position in Congress, alleged she was silenced while trying to oppose the change.\n\n \"Be clear: I was on that call, and as I tried to push my button to voice my concern, to ask questions and certainly not to vote in support of this, I was muted,\" Beatty said in a video shared via X on Dec. 18. \"Participants were not allowed to voice their concerns who were online, yet it was said at the end it was a unanimous vote.\"\n\n Prominent members of JFK's family — including grandson Jack Schlossberg, grandnephew Joe Kennedy III, and nieces Maria Shriver and Kerry Kennedy — have spoken out against the unusual effort to put Trump's name on another president's memorial.\n\n Schlossberg argued on social media over the summer that the move would go against federal law, citing a congressional act that said, \"no additional memorials or plaques in the nature of memorials shall be designated or installed in the public areas of the John F.

The action has been taken under China's Anti-Foreign Sanctions Law and will come into effect immediately.According to the ministry, the targeted companies include Northrop Grumman Systems Corporation, L3Harris Maritime Services, Boeing in St. Louis, Gibbs & Cox, Advanced Acoustic Concepts, VSE Corporation, Sierra Technical Services, Red Cat Holdings, Teal Drones, ReconCraft, High Point Aerotechnologies, Epirus, Dedrone Holdings, Area-I, Blue Force Technologies, Dive Technologies, Vantor, Intelligent Epitaxy Technology, Rhombus Power and Lazarus Enterprises.Under the sanctions, all movable and immovable assets of these companies located in China will be frozen. Chinese organisations and individuals will also be barred from carrying out business, cooperation or any other dealings with the listed entities.The measures also extend to 10 senior executives, including Palmer Luckey, founder of Anduril Industries, and top executives from companies such as L3Harris, VSE Corporation and others. As per the ministry, their assets in China will be restricted, and they will face limits on activities related to China.Beijing said the US arms sales to Taiwan \"seriously violate the one-China principle and the three China-US Joint Communiques, interfere in China's internal affairs, and undermine China's sovereignty and territorial integrity\". The Foreign Ministry said the move harms China's sovereignty and territorial integrity, Global Times reported.A ministry spokesperson said the Taiwan issue lies at the core of China's national interests and is a red line in China-US relations.\"Anyone who attempts to cross the line and make provocations on the Taiwan question will be met with China's firm response. Any company or individual who engages in arms sales to Taiwan will pay the price for the wrongdoing.

Israel and Somaliland signed a mutual declaration, \"in the spirit of the Abraham Accords,\" which were brokered by President Trump. IS TRUMP CONSIDERING BOLD AFRICA PLAY TO PUSH BACK ON CHINA, RUSSIA AND ISLAMIC TERRORISTS? Sa’ar shared in a statement on X that relations between Somaliland and Israel have grown, \"based on extensive and ongoing dialogue.\" Full diplomatic relations include Israel’s appointment of ambassadors and opening of embassies in the state, according to Sa’ar. Somaliland's President, Dr. Abdirahman Mohamed Abdillahi, said in a statement that the Republic of Somaliland, \"warmly welcomes and deeply appreciates,\" Israel’s decision to recognize the state’s sovereignty. \"This recognition represents a milestone in Somaliland’s longstanding pursuit of international legitimacy, reaffirming its historical, legal and moral entitlement to statehood,\" said Abdillahi in the statement. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs for Somaliland stated this decision was a \"constructive contribution to peace, stability and cooperation,\" in the Horn of Africa and across the Middle East, in a release made on Friday. US DRAMATICALLY ESCALATES SOMALIA AIRSTRIKES AS TRUMP ADMIN TARGETS ISIS, AL QAEDA TERRORISTS \"The Republic of Somaliland hereby expresses its firm intention to accede the Abraham Accords … Somaliland looks forward to engaging with the State of Israel, on the foundation of formal diplomatic relations and mutual recognition,\" said Somaliland’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Shortly after Israel’s decision, South Sudan reportedly became the second country to officially recognize Somaliland, with some now questioning if the U.S. will follow suit. President Donald Trump was reportedly \"looking into\" the recognition of Somaliland in August. The official recognition would land the U.S. a new foothold in the Horn of Africa, through a new air and sea base near the entrance of the Red Sea at Berbera Port. When asked about the state’s recognition and the potential resettlement of Gazans there, Trump told reporters on Aug. 8, \"We’re looking into that right now.\" This would position U.S. defense forces directly across from Yemen and the Houthi fighters, an armed political group prominently known for its attacks against Israel and shipping in the Red Sea, according to reports. Thirty percent of the world’s container ship traffic is reported to pass through its waters en route to or from the Suez Canal, according to previous Fox News reports. YEMEN SEPARATIST FORCES SEIZE KEY OIL REGION, URGE US TO PARTNER AGAINST IRAN-BACKED HOUTHIS Trump is set to meet with Netanyahu on Monday, Dec. 29 at his Mar-a-Lago residence to discuss \"next steps\" in the Gaza peace deal. Despite previous talks, Trump is reportedly, \"not ready\" to embrace Somaliland's independence and was reportedly \"unimpressed\" by their expressed interest in joining the Abraham Accords. Trump told the New York Post that he has to \"study\" Netanyahu's pitch and asked from his golf course, \"Does anyone know what Somaliland is, really?\" \"We’ll study it. I study a lot of things and always make great decisions and they turn out to be correct,\" Trump told the Post. Somalia has been battling Islamist fundamentalist fighters for decades, with the U.S. Africa Command increasing attacks against ISIS and al-Shabab terrorists, according to previous Fox News Digital reporting.

His comments come as the US leader is expected to hold talks with Ukraine’s Vladimir Zelensky this weekend.\n\nIn an interview with Politico on Friday, Trump suggested that “it’s going to go good with Putin,” adding that he expects to speak with him “soon, as much as I want.” He would not elaborate on when the talks would take place, or whether they would be before or after negotiations with Zelensky.\n\nThe last Putin-Trump phone call took place on October 16, when the Russian leader congratulated the US president on helping to mediate a peace agreement in Gaza. At the same time, Moscow and Washington have maintained active contacts over Ukraine, with Trump’s special envoy Steve Witkoff and his son-in-law, Jared Kushner, holding five-hour talks with Putin over the Ukraine conflict at the Kremlin in early December.\n\nThe Trump-Zelensky meeting in Florida on Sunday will focus on territorial issues – particularly regarding Russia’s Donbass – which remain the main stumbling block in talks to end the conflict, according to the Ukrainian leader. Zelensky also said he would bring up the idea of a referendum on territorial concessions to Russia if Moscow agrees to a ceasefire of 60 days or longer.\n\nMoscow, however, has dismissed the referendum idea as a ploy to buy time to rearm and regroup, stressing that Donetsk and Lugansk Regions are inalienable parts of Russia.\n\nEarlier this week, Zelensky unveiled a plan that proposes to freeze the conflict along current front lines in Donetsk, Lugansk, Zaporozhye, and Kherson regions and requires Russian forces to withdraw from several Ukrainian regions. Zelensky has also demanded ”Article 5-like” security guarantees from the US, NATO, and European states.\n\nMoscow insists that a sustainable settlement is only possible if Ukraine renounces its NATO membership aspirations, commits to demilitarization and denazification, and recognizes the new territorial reality on the ground.","summary":"Donald Trump has said he expects to talk with Vladimir Putin ‘soon’ \nRead Full Article at RT.com","url":"https://www.rt.com/news/630069-trump-teases-new-talks-putin/","image":"https://mf.b37mrtl.ru/files/2025.12/article/694f1ba120302735ca13de90.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-26 23:35:46","author":null,"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"ru","sentiment":-0.321},{"id":389316474,"title":"Venezuelans sent to El Salvador call on US after ruling","text":"A group of Venezuelans who were sent to a maximum-security El Salvador prison from the US and then returned to ‍Venezuela have called for America to comply with a ruling that ​would allow them to challenge their deportation in US courts. US Judge James Boasberg ruled this week that President Donald Trump&apos;s administration must urgently arrange for the return of the hundreds of Venezuelans who were deported to El Salvador, saying their expulsion violated their due process rights and that they have the right to challenge their deportation in ‌court. Under the ruling, ​the Trump administration must present a plan to allow their return ‍within two weeks. \"The court ruling now orders that we be granted the opportunity for a fair hearing in accordance with the law in the United States,\" Ysqueibel Peñaloza, a former detainee, said on behalf of some 252 former prisoners. \"We call on the ​governments of the United States and El Salvador ‌to fully comply with the court order. We demand that the authorities of that country create ​the conditions that will allow us to participate in the hearing.\" Peñaloza asked for ‍national and international help in their defence, without specifying what help they needed. The Venezuelans were sent to El Salvador from the US in March ​after ​Trump invoked the 1798 Alien ​Enemy Act - a little-used wartime law - to deport ​people classified as members of the Tren de Aragua gang, without carrying out hearings or usual migration procedures. Many lawyers and family members denied the men in question had any links to gangs and said they were often left in the dark about the location of the detainees. The deportations drew strong criticism from human rights groups and spawned ‍a legal battle with the Trump administration.
