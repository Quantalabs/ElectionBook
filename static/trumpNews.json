A longer lead time would give airlines time to plan alternate routes.\n\nAustralia has complained more vociferously about the lack of notification. Foreign minister Penny Wong said she sought an explanation from Wang when the two met in Johannesburg last Saturday following a gathering of foreign ministers from the Group of 20 nations.\n\nChina’s official Xinhua news agency made no mention of the issue in an initial report on Peters’ meeting earlier in the day with Han.\n\nThe three Chinese ships were south of Tasmania in Australia’s exclusive economic zone and were now moving west, the New Zealand defence force said on Wednesday.\n\nPeters said he also raised China’s missile launch test last September that landed near French Polynesia’s exclusive economic zone, of which “most Pacific Island nations got no warning at all” and New Zealand got “little warning.“\n\nChina was considering the issue of providing earlier notice for future naval drills, he said.\n\nIn his talks in Beijing, Peters said the return of President Donald Trump to the White House came up more than he had expected.\n\nHe didn’t provide any details, but said that both sides agreed that “perhaps we should just wait and see what happens when the dust settles.”\n\nPeters has also voiced concerns that the Cook Islands, an independent country in free association with New Zealand, had signed a comprehensive strategic partnership and other agreements with China, without satisfactorily consulting with New Zealand.\n\nChina “needs to understand the constitutional arrangement” between New Zealand and the Cook Islands, Peters told reporters, adding that New Zealand got more information out of China on the deals than it got out of the Cook Islands.\n\nPeters said last week his country must “reset” its relationship with its Pacific neighbour after its opaque dealings with Beijing.\n\nThe agreement spans education, the economy, infrastructure, fisheries, disaster management and seabed mining. It set off alarm bells in New Zealand due to concerns over China’s growing presence in the Pacific region and potential threats to the country’s national security.\n\nWang said that China respects the traditional relations between New Zealand and the Pacific island countries.\n\nThe Cook Islands is a self-governing nation and maintains free association with Wellington, sharing a head of state and citizenship rights.

Crowds of cheering families and friends gathered in Beitunia for a glimpse of the bus. \n\nIsrael had delayed the release of more than 600 Palestinians since Saturday to protest what it called the cruel treatment of hostages during their handover by Hamas. \n\nThe militant group had called Israel’s delay a \"serious violation\" of the ceasefire and said talks on a second phase were not possible until the Palestinians were freed.\n\nThe release of the bodies was carried out without ceremony, as opposed to past Hamas releases with stage-managed events in front of crowds. Israel, along with the Red Cross and UN officials, had described the ceremonies as humiliating for the hostages.\n\nA number of women and teenagers detained since the militant group's attack on Israel on 7 October 2023, which sparked the conflict in Gaza, were included in the exchange.\n\nA Hamas source said the prisoners and detainees due to be released include 445 men and 24 women and minors arrested in Gaza, as well as 151 prisoners serving life sentences for deadly attacks on Israelis.\n\nOnly around 50 Palestinians will be released into the occupied West Bank and east Jerusalem in this round, while many sentenced to life over deadly attacks on Israelis will be exiled out of the Palestinian territories, taken to Egypt at least temporarily until other countries accept them.\n\nThe handover completes both sides' obligations under the first phase of the ceasefire, during which Hamas returned 33 hostages, including eight bodies, in exchange for nearly 2,000 Palestinian prisoners.\n\nThe family of one hostage in Gaza said it had been notified he was dead and his body was among those to be returned. Tsachi Idan was taken from Kibbutz Nahal Oz. His eldest daughter, Maayan, was killed as militants shot through the door of the safe room. \n\nThe ceasefire's six-week first phase expires this weekend. US president Donald Trump's Middle East envoy, Steve Witkoff, has said he wants the sides to move into negotiations on the second phase, during which all remaining hostages held by Hamas would be released and an end to the war would be negotiated.\n\nTalks on the second phase were supposed to begin in the first week of February.\n\nTens of thousands of Israelis lined highways as the bodies of a mother and her two young sons, killed in captivity in Gaza, were taken for burial on Wednesday. The bodies of Shiri Bibas and her sons, 9-month-old Kfir and 4-year-old Ariel, were handed over earlier this month.\n\nIsrael says the children were killed by their captors in November 2023, while Hamas says the family was killed along with their guards in an Israeli airstrike.\n\nWith people living in tent camps and damaged buildings in Gaza in chilly weather, health officials said another infant had died of hypothermia, bringing the toll to seven in two weeks.\n\nTemperatures have been below 10C (50F) at night and the past few days have been particularly cold.","summary":"Israel also frees hundreds of Palestinian detainees in exchange","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/middle-east/hamas-hands-over-bodies-of-four-hostages-b2705450.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/02/26/10/Israel_Palestinians_49476.jpg?width=1200&height=800&crop=1200:800","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/ChmS3Nog-4VHSaSK0.mp4","publish_date":"2025-02-27 00:38:07","author":"Jane Dalton","authors":["Jane Dalton"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.342},{"id":294730886,"title":"‘Catastrophe’: Why we should ‘sell to Trump’","text":"When three little Chinese ships sailed down the east coast of Australia, few imagined the mighty victory that they were about to achieve. \n\nAfter all, what kind of harm could a lowly frigate, a cruiser and a resupply ship do by themselves?\n\nAs it turns out, quite a lot. \n\nNot in terms of military destruction, but if we measure it in terms of our defensive credibility, it is a catastrophe. \n\nNuclear-armed?\n\nOf the three Chinese ships, the most worrisome is the Renhai-class Cruiser Zunyi, which can be equipped with nuclear-capable land-attack cruise missiles. \n\nFrom where the little “flotilla” was sitting a few days ago off Southern NSW, it could have hypothetically destroyed Canberra and Sydney in under an hour. Brisbane too in a little longer. \n\nAuthorities only became aware of the danger after a commercial airline pilot radioed it in. \n\nOur response has been weak-kneed and slow, and we have had to rely upon the great New Zealand navy to keep up the monitoring. \n\nTo describe this as an embarrassing exposure of our naked defences doesn’t say it. \n\nGunboat diplomacy\n\nOne does not need to be so dramatic to be concerned. The main point being made by Beijing is as much political as it is military. \n\nThat point is easy enough to read: do what we say or you will be destroyed. The manner of the message is also clear. Get out of the Taiwan Strait or we’ll occupy the Tasman Strait.\n\nThis is an age-old tactic of warfare known as “gunboat diplomacy”. When you can sail missiles unmolested to within minutes of a competing nation’s capital, there is not much need to fire them. \n\nYou can just ask whatever you like, then sail away, job done. \n\nSo much for ANZUS\n\nWhere is America in all of this? Donald Trump is otherwise distracted in Europe, Russia and Ukraine.\n\nThe Americans are doing nothing, expecting us to take care of ourselves against the three little boats. Sadly, China just illustrated we are unable to do so. \n\nSure, if this situation were to escalate into a major confrontation, Washington may send us some help.\n\nBut that raises the question of price. \n\nAs President Trump is busy illustrating in Europe, that price is steep and rising, with the US demanding extortionate rights to Ukraine’s mineral wealth in order to not abandon it entirely.\n\nAustralia has a longer and more storied history with the US than does Ukraine, and the Pacific is its more natural sphere of influence, but these may be differences of degree not kind to the transactional Mr Trump. \n\nSo much for AUKUS\n\nOur much-loved deal to buy nuclear submarines some time this century also now looks rather stupid. \n\nThe nuclear boats were designed to sail the far-distant seas of North Asia, yet now they can be pinned down with just three little ships.\n\nThe three Chinese ships carry a formidable array of anti-submarine missiles and can sail around entirely unchallenged for the next 15 years anyway.\n\nSome broad array of land-based anti-ship missiles and drones looks to be an absolute necessity in the near future. \n\nYet even that is pretty useless without the US navy and its nuclear umbrella in the long run. \n\nSell Australia to Trump\n\nThe sheer haplessness of Australian defence forces this week is the most terrifying. \n\nWe have been living in a bubble of iron ore ore revenues and Canberra lies for two decades.\n\nWe had a brief moment of sanity during Covid when China demanded we end our democracy and was rebuffed as we diversified trade. \n\nBut even that warning went unheeded. \n\nSince then, it has been back to business as usual of selling everything not bolted down to China while importing people that won’t fight for this country as well as spending as little as possible on defence.\n\nI can’t see why America would bother honouring ANZUS given this behaviour. It’s not the Americans that are the unreliable ally; it is us. \n\nAnd so, taken for granted for generations and now run by a hard-nosed America First president, the price for America coming to Australia’s aid is likely much higher than we ever imagined. \n\nWe could start paying it by dramatically increasing defence spending. But, alas, that relies on the competence of the same fools that got us here.\n\nA better idea is to get in ahead and sell ourselves to America today, before the price is discounted against Greenland in a moment of national crisis. \n\nGod bless the 51st state.\n\nDavid Llewellyn-Smith is Chief Strategist at the MB Fund and MB Super.

His mum was calling me saying ‘Justin, I don’t know where to send him, I have people pulling me left and right’,” Tatum said.\n\n“I said you know what, I’m gonna come home, and stop my career and come home, and get him together because I don’t want nobody teaching him and giving him bad habits.”\n\nJayson lived with his mother but Tatum began daily work-outs with his son. He also embarked on a 16-year stint as a title-winning high school coach, first at Soldan High and then with his old school, Christian Brothers College (CBC).\n\n“We didn’t know he [Jayson] would get to 6′9 [203cm] but I taught him how to play outside in, instead of inside out,” he said. \n\n“The way I learned was dunking the ball and setting screens. But where I saw the game transitioning to, that’s where he is at right now.” \n\nIn the pursuit of instilling resilience and sanding off any hint of a soft edge, Tatum acknowledges he was always – always – tough on his son.\n\n“I taught him like a drill sergeant,” he said.\n\n”I always made him play two or three years up, I had him playing and practising against my high school players. It was drilled into him [that] he had to have a work ethic, and to dominate. There were no easy days.“\n\nIn Tatum’s mind, hardness was a non-negotiable. He’d learned where the bar for greatness was set when travelling in the NBA off-season with his best friend (and 15-year NBA pro) Larry Hughes, who would play in private pick-up games with other stars to stay fit.\n\n“We got a chance to go to Chicago and work with guys like Michael Jordan, and Antoine Walker. So I got a chance to watch those guys play pick-up and just see their mannerisms and their competitiveness, everything,” Tatum said.\n\n “I was like, my kid, if he wants to be here, he has to approach it different. I can’t just have nice shoes and a jumpshot. I got to fight through this screen, I gotta dive on this floor. It was what I had seen and heard, being around those high-calibre players. Those are the attributes I tried to instil in him.” \n\nThe size of a forward but with the touch of a guard, Jayson became one of the best teenagers in the country, played for the prestigious Duke University and was taken by Boston as the third pick in the 2017 NBA draft.\n\nHe was an instant millionaire – but superstardom came at a cost. Jayson would later do interviews about the complicated relationship with his father, and feeling like he could never please him.\n\n“I felt like he didn’t like me as a kid, because he was so mean to me,” Jayson said in a 2023 interview. “Of course he did, but as a kid I couldn’t separate coach from dad.”\n\nJayson revealed Tatum would publicly abuse him to toughen him up. He also aggressively confronted him at halftime in a game when he wasn’t dominating. Jayson said was he “scared” of his father but acknowledges, too, he benefited from being pushed.\n\n“It was fun coaching him, but it was tough as well. You have probably heard in some interviews we butted heads a lot,” Tatum said.\n\n“But he always calls and says ‘I would not be here if I did not go through that journey with you. No matter what people think, or how it may sound’.”\n\nDid Tatum find it a wrench, being so hard on his boy?\n\n“Probably not then, because I didn’t know what I was, internally, maybe causing,” Tatum says.\n\n“But hearing it since about what I was causing, its like ‘oh man, I coulda eased off a bit’, or whatever. But also, he says if I had have eased off he would have been pissed.\n\n“But as a grown man now … [I was] not really thinking that your 9/10/11-year old son is emotionally fighting through everything to make you happy. Now he is able to express that, and he’s not mad it happened because of the success. But I am like ‘ahh, I coulda done better’.\n\n “But people don’t understand we had a son at 18-years-old. I was still a young man.”\n\nAs Jayson’s NBA career launched, Tatum built a name as a successful high school coach at Soldan and CBC. He’d catch up once a year for lunch in St Louis with his old school friend Jared, who – in 2020 – casually mentioned he’d bought a professional basketball team on the other side of the world.\n\nThe friend is Jared Novelly, whose family own Apex Oil and have a net worth over $2 billion. Novelly – who was last month tapped by Donald Trump to become ambassador to New Zealand – had helped rescue the Illawarra Hawks from potential collapse and in late 2022, invited Tatum to visit Australia to consult, and then help scout players back in the States.\n\nBut a cruise on Sydney Harbour and a visit to some Wollongong beaches later, Novelly asked Tatum to leave St Louis and join the Hawks staff.\n\n“When a billionaire owner wants something, they know how to find a way to entice you,” Tatum said.\n\nWith aspirations to coach at college and NBA level, the 45-year-old agreed to move to Australia as a CV builder, at least. Four months later, Tatum walked into a beachfront hotel and walked out as an NBL head coach.\n\nBecoming part of the Hawks – and the city of Wollongong\n\nThe very first season of the NBL, in 1979, started with 10 teams.

The NBL’s Wikipedia page lists 24 clubs in 45 years who are now “defunct”.\n\nThe Hawks came close to joining the list, several times. After winning their only NBL title in 2000-01, the cash-strapped outfit was almost cut out of a revamped league in 2009 – before a local campaign raised enough money to keep the Hawks afloat.\n\nThe community-run club mostly struggled to balance the books, though, and almost collapsed in 2015.

The season motto is plastered everywhere: “We rise together.”\n\nThe Hawks are a class above an injury-hit Brisbane, and it’s over by the end of the first quarter.

His mum was calling me saying ‘Justin, I don’t know where to send him, I have people pulling me left and right’,” Tatum said.\n\n“I said you know what, I’m gonna come home, and stop my career and come home, and get him together because I don’t want nobody teaching him and giving him bad habits.”\n\nJayson lived with his mother but Tatum began daily work-outs with his son. He also embarked on a 16-year stint as a title-winning high school coach, first at Soldan High and then with his old school, Christian Brothers College (CBC).\n\n“We didn’t know he [Jayson] would get to 6′9 [203cm] but I taught him how to play outside in, instead of inside out,” he said. \n\n“The way I learned was dunking the ball and setting screens. But where I saw the game transitioning to, that’s where he is at right now.” \n\nIn the pursuit of instilling resilience and sanding off any hint of a soft edge, Tatum acknowledges he was always – always – tough on his son.\n\n“I taught him like a drill sergeant,” he said.\n\n”I always made him play two or three years up, I had him playing and practising against my high school players. It was drilled into him [that] he had to have a work ethic, and to dominate. There were no easy days.“\n\nIn Tatum’s mind, hardness was a non-negotiable. He’d learned where the bar for greatness was set when travelling in the NBA off-season with his best friend (and 15-year NBA pro) Larry Hughes, who would play in private pick-up games with other stars to stay fit.\n\n“We got a chance to go to Chicago and work with guys like Michael Jordan, and Antoine Walker. So I got a chance to watch those guys play pick-up and just see their mannerisms and their competitiveness, everything,” Tatum said.\n\n “I was like, my kid, if he wants to be here, he has to approach it different. I can’t just have nice shoes and a jumpshot. I got to fight through this screen, I gotta dive on this floor. It was what I had seen and heard, being around those high-calibre players. Those are the attributes I tried to instil in him.” \n\nThe size of a forward but with the touch of a guard, Jayson became one of the best teenagers in the country, played for the prestigious Duke University and was taken by Boston as the third pick in the 2017 NBA draft.\n\nHe was an instant millionaire – but superstardom came at a cost. Jayson would later do interviews about the complicated relationship with his father, and feeling like he could never please him.\n\n“I felt like he didn’t like me as a kid, because he was so mean to me,” Jayson said in a 2023 interview. “Of course he did, but as a kid I couldn’t separate coach from dad.”\n\nJayson revealed Tatum would publicly abuse him to toughen him up. He also aggressively confronted him at halftime in a game when he wasn’t dominating. Jayson said was he “scared” of his father but acknowledges, too, he benefited from being pushed.\n\n“It was fun coaching him, but it was tough as well. You have probably heard in some interviews we butted heads a lot,” Tatum said.\n\n“But he always calls and says ‘I would not be here if I did not go through that journey with you. No matter what people think, or how it may sound’.”\n\nDid Tatum find it a wrench, being so hard on his boy?\n\n“Probably not then, because I didn’t know what I was, internally, maybe causing,” Tatum says.\n\n“But hearing it since about what I was causing, its like ‘oh man, I coulda eased off a bit’, or whatever. But also, he says if I had have eased off he would have been pissed.\n\n“But as a grown man now … [I was] not really thinking that your 9/10/11-year old son is emotionally fighting through everything to make you happy. Now he is able to express that, and he’s not mad it happened because of the success. But I am like ‘ahh, I coulda done better’.\n\n “But people don’t understand we had a son at 18-years-old. I was still a young man.”\n\nAs Jayson’s NBA career launched, Tatum built a name as a successful high school coach at Soldan and CBC. He’d catch up once a year for lunch in St Louis with his old school friend Jared, who – in 2020 – casually mentioned he’d bought a professional basketball team on the other side of the world.\n\nThe friend is Jared Novelly, whose family own Apex Oil and have a net worth over $2 billion. Novelly – who was last month tapped by Donald Trump to become ambassador to New Zealand – had helped rescue the Illawarra Hawks from potential collapse and in late 2022, invited Tatum to visit Australia to consult, and then help scout players back in the States.\n\nBut a cruise on Sydney Harbour and a visit to some Wollongong beaches later, Novelly asked Tatum to leave St Louis and join the Hawks staff.\n\n“When a billionaire owner wants something, they know how to find a way to entice you,” Tatum said.\n\nWith aspirations to coach at college and NBA level, the 45-year-old agreed to move to Australia as a CV builder, at least. Four months later, Tatum walked into a beachfront hotel and walked out as an NBL head coach.\n\nBecoming part of the Hawks – and the city of Wollongong\n\nThe very first season of the NBL, in 1979, started with 10 teams. Some had familiar names and others with weird ones that have long been forgotten, like the City of Sydney Astronauts, the West Adelaide Bearcats, the Canterbury-Bankstown Bruins and the Glenelg Tigers.\n\nThe Illawarra Hawks were there, and so were the Brisbane Bullets, the Canberra Cannons and the Newcastle Falcons.

The NBL’s Wikipedia page lists 24 clubs in 45 years who are now “defunct”.\n\nThe Hawks came close to joining the list, several times. After winning their only NBL title in 2000-01, the cash-strapped outfit was almost cut out of a revamped league in 2009 – before a local campaign raised enough money to keep the Hawks afloat.\n\nThe community-run club mostly struggled to balance the books, though, and almost collapsed in 2015. It entered voluntary administration and was close to handing in the licence to new NBL owner Larry Kestelman, but new backers were found and the Hawks stayed alive.\n\nEven the star cameo season of future NBA star LaMelo Ball couldn’t stop the club from going into VA again in 2019, but after Ball contemplated buying into the franchise, a new ownership group – led by Novelly – eventually took over in 2020.\n\nThey had defied death again but the NBL rebranded the team “the Hawks” to try and extend the fan base as far as Canberra.\n\nBut under local pressure, the NBL agreed it would restore Illawarra to the name in 2021 – but only if the club could sell 4379 non-ticket memberships, as proof of the town’s connection. The fans, again, dug deep and hit the target.\n\nThe city’s passion for the Hawks is clear on a nondescript Monday night in late January, when a clash with the struggling Brisbane Bullets pulls a near sell-out crowd at WIN Entertainment Centre, just two nights after a sell-out on Saturday.\n\nOf the 15 biggest Hawks crowds in Wollongong, seven have been this season – so far.

Federal health officials notified members of the Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee of the cancelation in an email Wednesday afternoon, said committee member Dr. Paul Offit, the director of the Vaccine Education Center at Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia. The email, Offit said, offered no explanation for the scrapped meeting. A spokesperson for the Department of Health and Human Services, which oversees the FDA, did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The cancelation comes as the United States is in the midst of a particularly severe flu season. So far, there have been 86 deaths in children and 19,000 deaths in adults this season, according to data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The FDA typically convenes the meeting every spring to get recommendations on which strains should be included in the upcoming flu vaccine. The meetings are important because the flu virus changes year to year, and the vaccine must be updated to provide the best protection. Deciding on the strains in the spring gives vaccine manufacturers enough time to produce the shots to be ready for the fall. For the 2024-2025 flu season, drugmakers supplied the U.S. with an estimated 148 million doses of flu shots, according to the CDC. It's unclear what the canceled meeting will mean for Americans who want to get a flu vaccine next season. On Friday, a World Health Organization advisory committee is scheduled to meet on which strains should be included in the next flu vaccines in the Northern Hemisphere. That meeting typically influences the FDA's strain selection. In January, President Donald Trump issued an executive order to begin the process of withdrawing the U.S. from the WHO. Federal health officials were later ordered to stop communicating with the WHO. Stat News reported on Monday that officials from both the FDA and the CDC would participate virtually in the WHO meeting, however. The canceled FDA advisory meeting comes just days after a CDC vaccine advisory committee meeting was abruptly postponed. That meeting included a presentation and vote on a number of vaccines, including the use of the British drugmaker GSK’s meningococcal vaccine, as well as for a new chikungunya vaccine and the recently approved at-home nasal spray for influenza. The canceled meeting in March is likely to add to concerns among scientists that HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr, an anti-vaccine activist, could undermine the vaccine regulatory process in the U.S., possibly leading to a resurgence of preventable diseases. Earlier Wednesday, Texas health officials reported that an unvaccinated child in the state died from the measles, the first death from the virus in a decade. An outbreak in the state has led to at least 124 cases, mostly in children. \"It's a bad day for infectious diseases,\" said Dr. Ofer Levy, director of the precision vaccines program at Boston Children's Hospital who has advised the FDA on vaccines.","summary":"A Food and Drug Administration vaccine advisory committee meeting scheduled for March to select the strains to be included in next season's flu shot has been canceled, a panel member said Wednesday.","url":"https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/fda-cancels-meeting-select-flu-strains-seasons-shots-rcna193931","image":"https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-1500w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-02/250226-california-flu-shot-2024-ac-718p-f90c38.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-02-27 00:33:54","author":"Berkeley Lovelace Jr","authors":["Berkeley Lovelace Jr"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.008},{"id":294735882,"title":"Environmental Protection Agency Will Lose 65% of Staff, Trump Says","text":"WASHINGTON -- During his Cabinet meeting Wednesday, President Donald Trump casually mentioned that Lee Zeldin, the administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, intended to fire 65% of employees, an incision so deep that officials said it would hobble the EPA.\n\nTrump said Zeldin \"thinks he's going to be cutting 65 or so percent of the people from environmental.

He has populated the senior ranks at the EPA with people who have served as lawyers and lobbyists for the oil and chemical industries, many of whom worked in his first administration to weaken climate and pollution protections.\n\nTrump and Zeldin have repeatedly said they intend to ensure the country has clean air and water. Whitehouse said that \"cannot mask the cruel reality that those goals fail if EPA is disabled.\"\n\nIn the past weeks, the Trump administration has fired 388 probationary employees at the agency and put 168 others on administrative leave, most of whom work on protecting poor and minority communities that face disproportionate levels of pollution.\n\nDuring his first term Trump promised to eliminate the EPA \"in almost every form,\" leaving \"only tidbits\" intact at the agency responsible for protecting the air and water from pollution, toxic chemicals and climate change.\n\nThe agency saw severe cuts to its budget and staffing during those years, but it began rebuilding during the Biden administration. It was budgeted to have about 17,000 full-time employees this year, roughly the staffing levels last seen during the Obama administration.\n\nMyron Ebell, a longtime critic of the EPA who led the agency transition team during Trump's first term, said a 65% cut was a start. He said the EPA had largely fulfilled its mission and could be downgraded to an agency that monitors and assists state environmental agencies.\n\n\"It could be an awful lot smaller,\" said Ebell, who does not accept the overwhelming scientific consensus that the planet is warming because of human activity.\n\nThe White House memo was issued by Russell Vought, the director of the White House Office of Management and Budget, along with Charles Ezell, the acting director of the Office of Personnel Management. It said that voters \"registered their verdict on the bloated, corrupt federal bureaucracy\" in the November election.\n\n\"Tax dollars are being siphoned off to fund unproductive and unnecessary programs that benefit radical interest groups, while hurting hard-working American citizens,\" it said. The memo directs agency heads to develop \"agency reorganization plans\" by March 13 and said those plans should seek to achieve \"a significant reduction\" in the number of full-time employees as well as \"a reduced real property footprint.\"\n\nThe EPA was created by President Richard M. Nixon in 1970, the year after the Cuyahoga River in Ohio became so polluted that it caught fire and shocked the nation. The fire helped galvanize a national environmental movement, and Congress passed a series of major laws, including the Clean Water Act and the Clean Air Act.\n\nUnder the Biden administration, the EPA became a focal point for another environmental crisis: climate change. The agency moved to limit the greenhouse gases from automobiles and power plants that scientists say are dangerously heating the planet.\n\nThis article originally appeared in The New York Times.","summary":"WASHINGTON -- During his Cabinet meeting Wednesday, President Donald Trump casually mentioned that Lee Zeldin, the administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, intended to fire 65% of employees, an incision so deep that officials said it would hobble the EPA.","url":"https://www.berkshireeagle.com/nyt/environmental-protection-agency-will-lose-65-of-staff-trump-says/article_3f78a275-2c06-5066-b2ef-23ae29c33fd3.html","image":"https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/berkshireeagle.com/content/tncms/custom/image/2b802cce-8455-11ec-8935-3f9640429655.jpg?resize=600%2C315","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-02-27 00:32:30","author":"Lisa Friedman,Russell Vought","authors":["Lisa Friedman","Russell Vought"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.346},{"id":294730338,"title":"Donald Trump holds first Cabinet meeting with Elon Musk in attendance","text":"US President Donald Trump held the first Cabinet meeting of his second term on Wednesday, covering a wide array of topics, ranging from the country's economy, tariffs on Europe, and the war in Ukraine. Trump also briefly invited tech mogul Elon Musk to take the floor, who sat at the sidelines of the meeting, wearing an 'IT Support' shirt and black 'Make America Great Again' hat. The European Union was formed to 'screw the United States.'Trump announced he will proceed with tariffs of 25% on imports from Canada and Mexico. He announced the stiff tariffs, which had been postponed last month in order to negotiate border security measures, will take effect on April 2. The US president also vowed to slap 25% tariffs on the European Union (EU), claiming the bloc was formed to \"screw the United States.\"It is not the first time Trump has threatened the EU with tariffs. Last week, the Republican president said \"the EU has been very unfair\" to the United States, and plegded to impose tariffs on auto imports, pharmaceuticals and chips. Speaking at the Cabinet meeting, he emphasised that the US felt taken advantage of. \"They (the EU) don't accept our cars, they don't accept essentially our farm products, they use all sorts of reasons why not, and we accept everything of them, and we have about a three hundred billion deficit with the EU,\" Trump said. EU leaders have firmly rejected the tariffs in the past and vowed to fight the tariffs, if they were to be applied. When asked by a reporter what would happen if countries tried to retaliate, Trump said they can try, but claimed they wouldn't succeed. \"We are the pot of gold. We're the one that everybody wants and they can retaliate. But it cannot be a successful retaliation because we just go cold turkey. We don't buy any more. And if that happens, we win,\" Trump responded. Ukraine could 'forget about' joining NATO.Speaking on the war in Ukraine, Trump declined to go into detail what concessions he would ask the two sides to make. However, the US president ruled out Ukraine's aspirations to join NATO.Trump said Kyiv \"could forget about\" joining the military alliance. “I think that’s probably the reason the whole thing started,\" he added, referring to Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine. The US president is expected to host Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy at the White House on Friday, where they will sign a minerals deal, which allows the US access to Ukraine's minerals in return for continued support from Washington. Trump has long complained that the United States spent too much taxpayer money to support Ukraine. “The previous administration put us in a very bad position,\" he said.He believes the deal will serve as a chance for Kyiv to pay back the US, \"we’ve been able to make a deal where we’re going to get the money back and a lot of money in the future.\"When asked to further specify on which concessions would be agreed on, Trump gave the floor to Vice President JD Vance, who pushed back at reporting that said the US president had made concessions in talks with Putin.\"Every single time the president engages in diplomacy, you guys preemptively accuse him of conceding to Russia,\" Vance said. \"He hasn't conceded anything to anyone. He's doing the job of a diplomat. And he is, of course, the diplomat in chief as the president of the United States.\"Musk says that without DOGE, 'America will go bankrupt.'The US president also briefly invited billionaire Elon Musk to speak at the meeting. The billionaire is not a member cabinet, but has a leading role in the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE).\"The overall goal here with the DOGE team is to help address the enormous deficit we simply cannot sustain as a country $2 trillion deficits,\" Musk said. He added that without DOGE, \"America will go bankrupt.\"Musk did admit that in efforts to cut government spending, DOGE may make mistakes. He cited as an example that the department accidentally cancelled USAID's Ebola Prevention programmes. Musk insisted that “there was no interruption” in services before the funding was restored.Since taking office on January 20, Trump temporarily froze all foreign aid, including for efforts to combat the spread of the deadly virus. A USAID official said on Wednesday that no funds for the agency's Ebola repsonse had been released since the funding freeze. The tech mogul also defended his \"pulse check\" emails, in which he requires government workers to justify their prior week’s work under penalty of termination.He said the requirement is \"not a high bar\" to meet. Musk, who believes certain people on the government payroll are dead or fictional, said the emails serve as a way to check whether workers are real, alive and can \"write an email.\"","summary":"Trump said the EU was formed to 'screw the US,' that Kyiv could forget about NATO accession, and praised tech mogul Elon Musk for his DOGE efforts.","url":"https://www.euronews.com/2025/02/27/donald-trump-holds-first-cabinet-meeting-with-elon-musk-in-attendance","image":"https://static.euronews.com/articles/stories/09/08/17/26/1440x810_cmsv2_dd7519c3-9001-5264-af71-4142b89c0eda-9081726.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-02-27 00:32:05","author":"Evelyn Ann-Marie Dom","authors":["Evelyn Ann-Marie Dom"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"fr","sentiment":-0.422},{"id":294734744,"title":"Glastonbury fans predict 'glorious' dance act could finally return for 2025 after hiatus as a result of festival rule","text":"Black Friday\n\nKim Kardashian\n\nVictoria Beckham\n\nHarry Styles\n\nAmanda Holden\n\nBritain's Got Talent\n\nPrivacy Policy\n\nThursday, Feb 27th 2025\n\n5-Day Forecast\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBuffy star Michelle Trachtenberg's teary-eyed boyfriend Jay Cohen speaks for the first time after her death\n\nDon't let Putin start ANOTHER war!

House and Senate Republicans have been at odds over the fiscal plan for weeks. President Donald Trump strongly urged the GOP to pass a \"big, beautiful bill\" that would deliver on a number of his campaign promises, and House Republicans took a crucial step by passing their blueprint on Tuesday night.But Senate Republicans have put forward a competing—and scaled-back version—of the proposal aimed to address certain aspects of Trump's agenda, like border security, before tacking issues like tax cuts.What To KnowHours after the House GOP passed the budget blueprint, which allows lawmakers to start drafting Trump's sweeping agenda, key Senate Republicans, including Murkowski, warned of the damage the new budget could inflict.\"So we're getting an update to all of our numbers, but I have shared with colleagues over here that our assessment of it is that the impact, once again, to Alaska, if we see the kinds of cuts that are being floated over on the House right now, could be devastating to Alaska,\" Murkowski said, per CNN's Manu Raju.While it's unclear to which cuts Murkowski was referring, the House bill includes $4.5 trillion in tax cuts and $2 trillion in spending reductions over the next decade.Murkowski's remarks come as Senate Republicans said they're not prepared to sign off on the bill, and after House Speaker Mike Johnson lauded the spending plan.\"This momentum will grow as we work with our committee chairs and Senate Republicans to determine the best policies within their respective jurisdictions to meet budgetary targets,\" Johnson said on Tuesday in a joint statement with other Republican House leaders. \"We have full confidence in their ability to chart the best path forward.\"Senate Majority Leader John Thune raised concerns, as he called the House blueprint \"a first step in what will be a long process and certainly not an easy one.\"When asked if the Senate should adopt the House's plan, Republican Senator John Kennedy of Louisiana told CNN: \"Short answer? Likely no. Long answer? Hell no.\" Kennedy emphasized that while the House efforts were commendable, \"senators have thoughts of their own.\"GOP Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina struck a more blunt tone, telling reporters before the plan passed the House that it would need a \"major overhaul\" to get past the Senate.\"The tax cuts are not permanent; they don't use current policy [budget baseline]. It would be a major overhaul,\" he said.Republican Representative Ralph Norman of South Carolina said a faction of House Republicans considers the proposed $2 trillion in spending cuts \"non-negotiable.\"\"If they want this passed, they'll need to stick with what we've got,\" Norman warned. \"The House controls the purse strings.\"The push and pull between the two chambers comes as Trump has long said that he will not allow budgetary cuts to Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security, doubling down on Wednesday by saying Medicaid \"will not be touched.\"That could put Republicans in a predicament as they work to figure out how to deliver on Trump's pledge to eliminate taxes on tips and permanently extend the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 without cutting critical social programs relied upon by millions of Americans.What People Are SayingDemocratic Representative Val Hoyle of Oregon said in a news release: \"After running on reducing the federal spending and the deficit, House Republicans have put forward a budget busting bill that will take healthcare away from millions of Americans and food away from hungry people—all so they can give massive tax breaks to their billionaire buddies.\"Republican Representative Claudia Tenney of New York wrote on X Tuesday: \"@HouseGOP took the first step today toward delivering on our promise to the American people: to craft a fiscally responsible budget that reins in out-of-control spending and lowers costs for hardworking families.\"Republican Representative Thomas Massie of Kentucky, the only member of his party to oppose the budget plan, told reporters before the vote: \"If the Republican plan passes—under the rosiest assumptions which aren't even true—we're going to add 328 billion dollars to the deficit this year, we're going to add 295 billion dollars to the deficit the year after that, 242 billion dollars to the deficit after that, under the rosiest assumptions. Why would I vote for that?\"What Happens NextThe Senate needs to pass its own budget blueprint by a simple majority vote before the House begins crafting legislation.","summary":"Hours after the House GOP passed the fiscal plan's blueprint, key Senate Republicans, including Lisa Murkowski, warned of the damage it could inflict.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/republican-warns-new-budget-could-devastating-her-state-2036909","image":"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2596512/lisa-murkowski.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-02-27 00:31:01","author":"Natalie Venegas","authors":["Natalie Venegas"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.154},{"id":294730802,"title":"Trump administration cutting 90% of USAID foreign aid contracts","text":"Washington — The Trump administration said Wednesday it is eliminating more than 90% of the U.S. Agency for International Development’s foreign aid contracts and $60 billion in overall U.S. assistance around the world.\n\nThe documents detail the results of a program-by-program review ordered by President Donald Trump of all the USAID and the State Department for development and aid work overseas.\n\nThe cuts detailed by the administration leave few surviving USAID projects for advocates to try to save in what are ongoing court battles.

space\n\nPODCAST: All the biggest news and insider gossip from the Trump administration – listen to Welcome to MAGAland here\n\nBy NIKKI SCHWAB, CHIEF CAMPAIGN CORRESPONDENT FOR DAILYMAIL.COM AT THE WHITE HOUSE\n\nPublished: 00:27 GMT, 27 February 2025 | Updated: 00:27 GMT, 27 February 2025\n\nPresident Donald Trump on Wednesday signed another DOGE-related executive order that would make federal workers justify their expenses and offload unused real estate. \n\nThe order also tells agency heads and their 'DOGE team lead' to build a 'centralized technological system within the agency to seamlessly record every payment' made to any government contract, grant or loan. \n\nEvery payment will need to be justified in the system, the order said. \n\nAgency heads and their DOGE partners were also instructed to go through every current contracts and grants to make sure they're necessary. \n\nTurning to the federal workforce, the order also instructs the agency heads to 'build a technological system within each agency that centrally records approval for federally funded travel for conferences and other non-essential purposes.'\n\n'Once an agency's system is in place, the Agency Head shall prohibit agency employees from engaging in federally funded travel for conferences or other non-essential purposes unless the travel-approving official has submitted a brief, written justification for the federally funded travel within such system,' the order said. \n\nThe same order implements a 30-day credit card freeze to apply to federal employees unless they're working on 'disaster relief' or 'critical services as determined by the Agency Head.'\n\nFinally the order tackles government real estate with agency heads tasked with letting the General Services Administration know what buildings are under lease and which properties are no longer needed. \n\nPresident Donald Trump on Wednesday signed another DOGE-related executive order that would make federal workers justify their expenses and offload unused real estate\n\nDOGE leader Elon Musk was on hand at President Donald Trump's first Cabinet meeting on Wednesday, with Trump saying he would 'throw out' any Cabinet secretaries not on board with Musk and DOGE's mission \n\nThis is the second DOGE-related executive order that Trump has signed.\n\nHe did so Wednesday behind closed doors after holding his first Cabinet meeting with DOGE leader Elon Musk in tow. \n\nAt the meeting, Trump vowed to 'throw out' any of his Cabinet secretaries who didn't respect Musk. \n\nThe White House had bristled at a CNN report Tuesday that suggested there was daylight between some Cabinet secretaries and Musk's mission after the billionaire sent out an email to all federal employees asking them to detail, 'What did you do last week?'\n\nThose who didn't respond would be terminated, Musk initially said. \n\nSome agency heads instructed workers not to answer since most of their portfolios would be of the classified nature. \n\nEven a senior White House official, who refused to use their name, divulged to CNN: 'A lot of agencies weren't given a heads up, which caused some headaches.' \n\nDuring Tuesday's briefing press secretary Karoline Leavitt insisted that 'nobody was caught off guard.' \n\n'Did anonymous sources say that or did the Cabinet secretaries say that?' she then said, challenging CNN's Jeff Zeleny. \n\nZeleny replied that Cabinet secretaries and other said they were not aware that the Musk email was being sent and asked if there would be any 'give and take' at the Cabinet meeting. \n\n'Is Elon Musk or the president open to any type of dialogue about who is actually in charge of the chain of command of these workers?'

We ask that you convey our concerns to Prime Minister Starmer during his upcoming visit to the United States and we would be happy to discuss them with you at your convenience.'\n\nMark Sabah, UK Director at the Committee for Freedom in Hong Kong Foundation, said: 'People have been warning the government that going ahead with this mega-embassy would be a bad idea.\n\n'It should be highly embarrassing that members of the US Congress feel the need to express their own concerns about it by writing to our government listing all the reasons why the British government should not be going ahead with this.\n\n'It's shameful that everyone can see this is a bad idea - except our own government.'\n\nBeijing have been lobbying the new government over the construction of the embassy. It was raised in talks between President Xi and Sir Keir Starmer last year, and then again between Chinese foreign minister Wang Yi and Mr Lammy in London earlier this month.\n\nThe fate of the mega-embassy will ultimately be signed off by Deputy Prime Minister Angela Rayner.\n\nA FCDO Spokesperson said: 'National security is the first duty of Government. It has been our core priority throughout this process.\n\n'A final decision on this case will be made in due course by Ministers in the Ministry of Housing, Communities, and Local Government.","summary":"Beijing is controversially planning to construct a major new embassy on the 600,000 sq ft site of the former Royal Mint , opposite the Tower of London.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-14440619/Chinas-embassy-London-embolden-Beijing.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/02/26/22/95626119-0-image-m-41_1740607854090.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-02-27 00:26:31","author":"Editor,Kumail Jaffer","authors":["Editor","Kumail Jaffer"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":0.234},{"id":294729912,"title":"Is America Destined for a Future Without Children?","text":"The staff writer Gideon Lewis-Kraus joins Tyler Foggatt to discuss why people around the world are having fewer and fewer children, and how the issue of birth rates has become a rallying cry for the American right.

But breaking with Russian natural gas has been difficult for Austria, which until recently was one of a handful of European countries to keep importing the fuel by pipeline. The efforts to decouple from Russian gas and fortify Austria's energy supply come as OMV, a multinational energy company based in Vienna, has shifted to increasing its own output of natural gas, drilling for oil and experimenting with geothermal energy.

Industry experts say Western companies would need to weigh potential access to oil and gas riches against political risks and other hazards of doing business in Russia. By Stanley Reed.\n\n[Story first moved Sunday, Feb. 23, at 12:09 a.m. ET.]\n\nU.S.-CHINA-TRADE-ASSESS (Washington) -- President Donald Trump's tough talk on China typically centers on tariffs. But a closer look at the decisions he has made since taking office shows that the president is considering a far wider set of economic restrictions on Beijing, ones that could hasten America's split from a critical trading partner. News Analysis by Ana Swanson.\n\nWith photos.\n\nBottom left:\n\nTRUMP-CHINA-SHIPS (Undated) -- The Trump administration has opened a broad new front in its global trade conflict, proposing to affix levies reaching $1.5 million on Chinese-made ships arriving at American ports. Such fees would apply even on vessels made elsewhere if they are operated by carriers whose fleets include Chinese ships -- an approach that risks increasing costs on an array of imported cargo, from raw materials to factory goods.

Goodman.\n\nADDITIONAL BUSINESS STORIES\n\nPOST-OPINION-EDITOR (Undated) -- Jeff Bezos, owner of the The Washington Post, announced a major shift to the newspaper's opinion section Wednesday, saying that it would now advocate for \"personal liberties and free markets\" and not publish opposing viewpoints on those topics. Bezos said that the section's editor, David Shipley, was leaving the paper in response to the change. Bezos' decision to curtail the scope of views on the opinion pages is a major departure from the newspaper's decades-long approach to commentary and criticism. By Benjamin Mullin.\n\nWith photo.

The site, based in Latvia and known for its fearless reporting on Vladimir Putin's regime, had prepared for cyberattacks, legal threats and even poisonings of its reporters. One thing she hadn't anticipated: defunding by the U.S. government.

Now, a former Goldman Sachs analyst and son of a private equity billionaire has ambitions to control some of USAID's roughly $40 billion budget and apply more of a \"pro-market\" approach to supporting development in other countries. Benjamin Black, 40, has been nominated by President Donald Trump to run the U.S. International Development Finance Corp., a little-known agency that invests and lends billions each year to companies and projects overseas. By Matthew Goldstein and Maureen Farrell.\n\nIRS-SERVICES (Undated) -- As millions of Americans file their returns, the Trump administration is calling for the abolition of the IRS and plans to fire as many as 7,000 workers -- all while Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency is seeking access to detailed taxpayer information. It is not surprising that many taxpayers are wondering how this may affect their returns and refunds. Despite the uncertainty, tax experts say individuals shouldn't change their behavior -- the sooner you file, the better. There are also several things that taxpayers can do to try to prevent their return from being entangled in the system and avoid potential delays. By Tara Siegel Bernard.\n\nNVIDIA-EARNINGS (San Francisco) -- When Nvidia lost $600 billion in market value in a single day last month, it was because some investors feared for the future of the artificial intelligence chipmaker. DeepSeek, a Chinese startup, said it had made its AI systems with a small fraction of the AI chips used by other companies and at a small fraction of the cost. On Wednesday, Nvidia showed those fears were overblown. The company, a bellwether for AI, said purchases of its AI chips lifted its total revenue by 78% from a year earlier to $39.33 billion during the three months that ended in January. Profit rose 80% to $22.09 billion.

The dockworkers union, the International Longshoremen's Association, said nearly 99% of its members had supported the contract, which raises hourly wages 62% to $63 over six years and guarantees jobs when employers introduce technology that can move cargo autonomously. The deal was reached after a short strike in October, the first full-scale walkout since 1977, and the intervention of two U.S. presidents.

The proposal would limit the rules to companies with more than 1,000 employees and revenue over 50 million euros ($53 million), which means that about 80% of companies currently covered by the directive would be exempt. The commission is trying to simplify regulations that businesses say impede investment and growth. By Eshe Nelson.\n\nTRUMP-VENEZ-OIL (Undated) -- President Donald Trump said Wednesday that he would revoke a Biden-era policy that allowed more oil to be produced in Venezuela and exported, dealing a blow to the country's government and Chevron, which produces oil there. A spokesperson for Chevron said the company was reviewing the implications of Trump's statement. By Rebecca F. Elliott.\n\nWith photo and related story:\n\n--BP-FOSSIL-FUELS (London) -- BP, the energy giant, on Wednesday said it would increase spending on oil and gas while sharply paring back investments in various forms of clean energy. The move, described as a \"reset,\" appears to be a response to a combination of investor pressure for higher returns and a realization that the so-called energy transition to cleaner fuels is not moving as fast as once expected.

In a note to employees obtained by The New York Times, Paramount's co-chief executives said it is ending its practices of using aspirational hiring goals related to race, ethnicity sex or gender.

At the IRS, 6,700 people with that status are being let go. At the Department of Health and Human Services, reports indicated the total could be 5,200. The Pentagon announced last week that it would terminate 5,400. These workers, who generally have less than one or two years of service in their current positions, are particular targets among civil servants because they have the weakest protections.

He claimed their cancellation would save $2 billion as the Trump administration pushes for widespread federal spending cuts.\"No more paying consultants to do things like make PowerPoint slides and write meeting minutes!\" Collins posted on X Tuesday. His comment was later praised by Elon Musk, President Donald Trump's cost-cutting chief at the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE).Why It MattersThe VA has recently fired 1,400 staff after its first round of layoff terminated 1,000 employees on February 13, sparking anger from lawmakers.The Trump administration's effort to cut jobs is part of a broader push to reshape the federal workforce.What To KnowA reviewed list of the affected VA contracts revealed that the cuts would have impacted essential services, including cancer care and toxic exposure assessments. The findings highlight the unintended consequences of the administration's broad cost-cutting efforts, drawing bipartisan concern from both Republican and Democratic lawmakers.Some contracts slated for elimination directly impact veterans' care, including evaluations for disability ratings, which determine medical coverage and financial compensation for service-related injuries. An inaccurate rating could have long-term effects on a veteran's access to healthcare and benefits.In response, the VA issued a statement clarifying that its contract review is still ongoing and not final.An internal VA email, obtained by The Associated Press, revealed that DOGE targeted contracts broadly labeled as 'consulting,' but included agreements essential for chemotherapy, imaging services, radiation detection calibration, emergency generator testing and pharmacy air quality assessments.Many of the affected contracts were linked to the PACT Act, a bipartisan law passed in 2022 under the Biden administration, designed to expand healthcare access for veterans. Following its passage, over 740,000 veterans enrolled for healthcare benefits, requiring a larger VA workforce to meet demand.What People Are SayingVA press secretary Pete Kasperowicz said in a statement: \"We will not be eliminating any benefits or services to Veterans or VA beneficiaries, and there will be no negative impact to VA health care, benefits, or beneficiaries. We are always going to take care of Veterans at VA. Period.\"Former VA Secretary David Shulkin, who served under Trump during his first term, stressed to the AP that hasty cuts without evaluating consequences could be damaging: \"Slowing down and pausing to see what the consequences are, even if they are unintended consequences, is important to do.\"Rosie Torres, executive director of Burn Pits 360, told the AP: \"With funding suddenly stripped from contractors processing claims, conducting medical screenings and expanding outreach, there are growing concerns veterans will face delays, denials and disruptions in accessing critical services.\"Torres' group advocates for veterans suffering from severe respiratory illnesses and cancers caused by exposure to toxic airborne particles from massive trash-burning fires at overseas military bases.Connecticut Democratic Sen. Richard Blumenthal said in a statement: If carried out, these cuts \"will harm veterans and taxpayers for years to come.\"What Happens NextWhile the specific outlook for the VA is unclear, it is expected that more employees in the federal workforce will be laid off as the Trump administration looks to slash costs.","summary":"The pause affects hundreds of VA contracts, which Secretary Collins described a day earlier as nonessential consulting agreements.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/va-halts-billions-contract-cuts-praised-elon-musk-2036918","image":"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2596530/doug-collins.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-02-27 00:22:31","author":"Gabe Whisnant","authors":["Gabe Whisnant"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.322},{"id":294728452,"title":"Newsom talks LA recovery, job growth at economic forecast event","text":"Gov.

It aims to streamline economic, business and workforce development programs to create more jobs and to do so more quickly.\n\nThe statewide plan was more than three years in the making and reflects ideas taken from 13 regional plans developed by stakeholders in different parts of California.\n\nMaybe pad this with a little background on the state’s economic situation right now?\n\nGiven last month’s wildfires in L.A.

Japan's ruling coalition failed to reach an agreement with a key opposition party Wednesday on the scale of a tax-free income threshold hike, a day after securing support from another opposition group to pass next fiscal year's state budget.\n\nThe move comes as Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba's Liberal Democratic Party and its coalition partner, Komeito, must secure opposition support on a case-by-case basis to pass bills and budgets in parliament after being left with no choice but to govern as a minority following their defeat in October's general election.\n\nU.N. official hopes confabs revive nuclear disarmament momentum\n\nNEW YORK - A senior U.N. disarmament official hopes that upcoming international conferences will help rekindle a desire among major countries to abandon nuclear weapons, despite ongoing uncertainty amid conflicts such as Russia's invasion of Ukraine.\n\nIzumi Nakamitsu, undersecretary general for disarmament affairs, said in a recent interview that she will strive to make the two gatherings related to U.N. treaties -- one banning nuclear weapons and another on non-proliferation -- successful in leading nuclear-armed countries to affirm such weapons should not be used, as a first step toward dismantling their arsenals.\n\nNEW YORK - The state parties to a U.N. treaty on banning nuclear weapons are poised to express their stronger commitment to realizing a world free of such arsenals at a conference in New York next week, according to a draft declaration.\n\nThe participants at the third meeting of the 2021 treaty are also likely to call for swift action to build momentum for nuclear disarmament amid \"rising global instability\" in the wake of Russia's invasion of Ukraine and other major conflicts.\n\nJapan trader Itochu not to join Seven & i management buyout plan\n\nTOKYO -

In Beitunia, crowds of cheering families and supporters gathered to catch a glimpse of the bus carrying their loved ones home.Disputes over ceasefire termsIsrael had delayed the release of over 600 Palestinian prisoners since Saturday, citing concerns over Hamas’ handling of the hostages. The militant group accused Israel of a \"serious violation\" of the ceasefire and warned that negotiations for a second phase would not continue until all Palestinian detainees were freed.Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s office stated that the return of the hostages’ bodies would be carried out discreetly, unlike previous Hamas handovers that were staged as public events. The office also said that Israel received coffins of 'four fallen hostages'Israel, the Red Cross, and UN officials have criticised such displays as degrading for the hostages and their families.Among those released from Israeli custody were 445 men, 21 teenagers, and one woman, all of whom had been detained after Hamas' attack on October 7, 2023. They had been held without charge on suspicion of militant activity. Palestinian officials stated that only around 50 prisoners were sent to the occupied West Bank and East Jerusalem. Others, including dozens sentenced to life over deadly attacks on Israelis, were taken to Egypt, at least temporarily, before being transferred to other countries.This handover completes both sides’ obligations under the first phase of the ceasefire, during which Hamas returned 33 hostages—including eight bodies—in exchange for nearly 2,000 Palestinian prisoners.Ceasefire in perilThe six-week ceasefire, brokered by the US, Egypt, and Qatar, is set to expire this weekend. US President Donald Trump’s Middle East envoy, Steve Witkoff, has urged both sides to move forward with negotiations for a second phase, which would involve the release of all remaining hostages and discussions on ending the war. Talks on this phase were originally scheduled to begin in early February.Meanwhile, Gaza’s humanitarian crisis worsens. With displaced families struggling in makeshift shelters, another infant died of hypothermia on Wednesday, bringing the toll to seven in two weeks.

Thank you for your attention to this matter!\" he said on Wednesday on Truth Social.\n\nIn a social media post on Wednesday, Trump said that the government of Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro has not made improvements in areas such as election reform and immigration enforcement.\n\n\"We are hereby reversing the concessions that Crooked Joe Biden gave to Nicolas Maduro, of Venezuela, on the oil transaction agreement, dated November 26, 2022, and also having to do with Electoral conditions within Venezuela, which have not been met by the Maduro regime,\" Trump said in the post.\n\nIt was part of the Biden administration's effort to ease restrictions on certain financial transactions involving Venezuela, particularly in the oil sector, amid ongoing negotiations between the Maduro government and the Venezuelan opposition to promote free and fair elections in Venezuela. But some sanctions were reimposed after Maduro blocked the Opposition candidate, Maria Corina Machado, from the presidential election.\n\nIn 2022, the Biden administration issued the US energy giant Chevron a licence to expand production in oil-rich Venezuela.\n\nAt the time, the US was taking cautious steps to lower tensions with the Maduro government, partly in the hope of spurring greater collaboration on energy.\n\nThen, in October 2023, officials in Maduro's administration signed a pair of deals called the Barbados Agreement, which affirmed its commitment to a free and fair election carried out under the observation of international election experts.\n\nThough Trump does not explicitly mention Chevron, the Biden administration authorised Chevron to \"resume limited natural resource extraction operations in Venezuela,\" according to the Treasury Department at the time.\n\nTrump said that this authorisation would not be renewed on March 1, as it normally would be, but terminated.\n\nVenezuelan Vice President Delcy Rodriguez criticised what she called Trump's \"damaging and inexplicable decision\".\n\n\"The US government has made a damaging and inexplicable decision by announcing sanctions against the US company Chevron.

House committees can now draft legislation at certain spending levels. \n\nThe Senate’s version of the budget resolution allows Republicans to bypass the filibuster and was adopted 52-48 along party lines, with Sen. Rand Paul (R-KY) being the lone GOP “no” vote.\n\nThe budgets advancing have no effect on the looming government shutdown in March, but they do set the table for what next year will look like.\n\nHere’s what to know moving forward:\n\nHow the budget process works in Congress\n\nThe annual federal budget process typically begins with federal agencies sending requests to the president, who then submits a detailed budget request to Congress for the coming fiscal year, which starts on Oct. 1.\n\nCongress then holds hearings in 12 appropriations subcommittees to ask administration officials about their requests. The legislative branch typically develops its own budget plan, called a “budget resolution.” The twelve subcommittees then negotiate their own spending bills to fund different functions in the federal government such as defense spending and energy.\n\nThe Senate and House, now that they have both passed their version of the budget, will enter negotiations to finalize the legislation. There are some differences between the two texts. \n\nThe House version authorizes between $1.5 trillion and $2 trillion in spending cuts, as well as a $4 trillion debt ceiling increase. Unlike the Senate’s budget resolution, the House version calls for $4.5 trillion in tax cuts in order to renew portions of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which are set to expire at the end of this year. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act is viewed among Republicans as one of the most successful pieces of legislation passed in President Donald Trump first term in office. \n\nCongress is supposed to pass the budget resolution by April 15, which is five and a half months before the Oct. 1 start of the fiscal year, but negotiations between the two chambers often take longer.\n\nIt’s unclear at this time which version Trump prefers. About an hour before the budget resolution landed on the House floor, he told reporters he is “looking at them both” and will pick which version he likes better.\n\n“I know the Senate’s doing very well, and the House is doing very well, but each one of them has things that I like, so we’ll see if we can come together,” Trump said.\n\nBoth chambers must pass a single version of each funding bill. Congress is then tasked with sending the approved funding bills to the president to sign or veto.\n\nLikelihood of a government shutdown next month\n\nBecause this budget would not go into effect until the next fiscal year, Congress still needs to figure out how to continue funding the government through March 14, when the current budget expires. Largely due to infighting among House Republicans in the 118th Congress, the House was unable to pass a new budget and relied on continuing resolutions to continue funding the government on the budget set in years prior. \n\nAt this time, a CR appears to be the most likely path for the government to stay open. Senate Majority Leader John Thune (R-SD) told Senate Republicans on Tuesday that extending the current budget until the Oct. 1 deadline is now the likeliest option.\n\n“I prefer, obviously, always prefer to move bills, individual bills, or at least bundled, packaged. But, you know, we’re running out of time, and so we’ve got a short window to work with,” Thune said on Tuesday.\n\nDemocratic leaders have said they do not want to shut down the government. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) has stated Democrats will not push for a shutdown to fight Trump’s agenda.\n\n“Democrats stand ready to support legislation that will prevent a government shutdown,” Schumer wrote in the letter to his conference. “Congressional Republicans, despite their bluster, know full well that governing requires bipartisan negotiation and cooperation. It is incumbent on responsible Republicans to get serious and work in a bipartisan fashion to avoid a Trump Shutdown.”\n\nHowever, recent shutdown showdowns have had to be saved with Democratic votes. With the GOP’s razor-thin House majority and a number of hard-line conservative members refusing to vote in favor of continuing resolutions, it is likely that Republicans will need Democrats once again if they wish to keep the government open.\n\nRep. Dusty Johnson (R-SD), who is friendly with GOP leadership, told reporters that a shutdown would be on Democrats despite them being in the minority. \n\n“Republicans do not have the votes to keep government open on our own. If the Democrats want to shut it down, they can,” he said.\n\nRep. Pete Aguilar (D-CA), the chairman of the House Democratic Caucus, addressed Johnson’s remarks.\n\n“If Republicans don’t want to govern, they just need to give us a couple votes and we’ll put Hakeem Jeffries in the speaker chair,” he said.","summary":"The House and Senate have passed their respective budgets after a dramatic showing from GOP leadership in the House Tuesday evening, but both still need to be negotiated between the two chambers.

It proposes repealing a law that makes it illegal to sell contraceptives and contraceptive devices in a vending machine at public schools.\"A person may not sell or offer for sale a contraceptive or a contraceptive device,\nwhether or not advertised as a prophylactic, by means of a vending machine or other automatic device at a kindergarten, nursery school, or elementary or secondary school,\" the law currently reads. \"A person who violates this section is guilty of a misdemeanor and on conviction is subject to a fine not exceeding $1,000 for each violation.\"Bill supporters believe it will improve access to contraceptives for teens and allow them to make healthy choices. However, critics have said if it becomes law, the bill will legalize the sale of condoms at preschools.Delegate Kathy Szeliga, a Republican, has been particularly vocal about the bill, deeming it the \"Condoms for Kiddies\" bill. Szeliga also recently proposed a bill that would prevent transgender athletes from competing in girls sports, but the bill didn't make it out of the Ways and Means Committee.What People Are SayingSocial Work Advocates for Social Change said in support of House Bill 380: \"This legislation promotes student health and well-being by enabling accessibility, reducing financial barriers, and protecting privacy and autonomy.\"The testimony added: \"Promoting access to contraceptives is crucial in enabling students to make healthy decisions about their reproductive health.\"Szeliga said after the bill passed the House: \"MD lawmakers have officially lost their minds.

since the start of 2024 iron ore prices have declined by 23 per cent while metallurgical coal prices have declined by 43 per cent.\n\n'We expect the demand for commodities to remain weak, given the outlook for China.'\n\nTreasury last year forecast iron ore prices sinking to just $US60 a tonne by the March quarter of 2025, which would be much lower than existing level of $US106 a tonne.\n\nIron ore, the commodity used to make steel, is Australia's biggest export ahead of coal and liquefied natural gas. \n\nDr Kennedy also noted the collapse of the Chinese property market would hurt Australia, a year on from the demise of high-rise apartment builder Evergrande.\n\nOne of Australia's most powerful bureaucrats has issued a warning about China 's slowing economy (pictured is an Evergrande complex in Beijing)\n\n'We expect growth to ease this year as the structural weaknesses in the Chinese property sector continues alongside weak consumer demand,' he said.\n\nDr Kennedy also warned that US President Donald Trump's trade war, including 10 per cent tariffs on Chinese imports, would hurt Australia's already slow economy.\n\n'The escalation in trade tensions is creating significant global policy uncertainty - this may dampen business investment, including in Australia which will pose risks both to growth and employment,' he said.\n\nMining investment contracted by 10.3 per cent over the year to September and mining giant BHP's shares have plunged by 9.9 per cent during the past year.\n\n'We expect business investment to slow over the coming year as major mining projects reach completion and the momentum in non-dwelling construction slows,' Dr Kennedy said.\n\nImmigration \n\nWhen it came to population growth, Dr Kennedy said immigration levels were still high because too few people were leaving, with unemployment still low at 4.1 per cent.\n\n'Thus far, the reduction in net overseas migration has been driven by declining migrant arrivals, in line with what we expected in our Budget forecasts,' he said.\n\n'However, departures continue to be lower, reflecting our relatively strong labour market.'\n\nTreasury secretary Steven Kennedy told senators in Canberra a slowdown in China, Australia's biggest trading partner, would hit demand for Australia's biggest exports, iron ore and coal\n\nAnthony Albanese claims immigration is not the real cause of Australia's housing crisis\n\nImmigration levels have slowed since reaching record-high levels approaching 550,000 in late 2023.\n\nBut Treasury had underestimated the population surge that continued after that.\n\nIn December, its Mid-Year Economic and Fiscal Outlook was revised to have 340,000 migrants arriving on a net basis into Australia in 2024-25.\n\nThat was a big, upward revision from 260,000 for this financial year forecast in the May Budget.\n\nEven those updated Treasury forecasts could prove to be very wrong with 444,480 migrants arriving in Australia in 2024 on a permanent and long-term basis.\n\nAustralia's population last year grew by 2.1 per cent which was among the highest in the developed world. \n\nShare or comment on this article:\nAustralia's most powerful bureaucrat issues a warning about China everyone should read - and explains why immigration is still high\n\nAdd comment","summary":"Treasury chief Steven Kennedy has issued a fresh warning about China and explained why Australia's immigration levels are still higher than expected.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-14436999/australia-economy.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/02/26/04/95593345-0-image-a-51_1740545270869.jpg","video":"https://videos.dailymail.co.uk/video/mol/2025/02/26/5597207411219317467/1024x576_MP4_5597207411219317467.mp4","publish_date":"2025-02-27 00:13:24","author":"Editor,Stephen Johnson","authors":["Editor","Stephen Johnson"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.353},{"id":294735978,"title":"Donald Trump Needs to Be Uninvited From G7 Summit: Canadian Politician","text":"Jagmeet Singh, leader of Canada's New Democratic Party, said on Wednesday President Donald Trump should be uninvited to an upcoming G7 meeting in Alberta.Newsweek reached out to the White House for comment via email.Why It MattersTrump has repeatedly suggested he wants the U.S. to annex Canada and make it the 51st state since returning to office in January.

The department will also provide up to $1 billion in additional funding, Rollins wrote in an opinion essay published Wednesday in The Wall Street Journal.\n\nThat includes distributing up to $500 million to egg producers to enhance disease prevention measures, $400 million in financial relief to farmers whose flocks are affected by the flu, and $100 million toward research and development for vaccines and therapeutics.\n\nThe Agriculture Department also said it would look to minimize the elimination of flocks affected by the flu and expedite the replacement process.\n\nThe Trump administration has made clear that the skyrocketing price of eggs is a priority. \"Eggs are a disaster,\" President Donald Trump said during a Cabinet meeting Wednesday.\n\nEven as Rollins heralded the efforts, she cautioned that consumers should expect egg prices to continue rising in the lead-up to Easter, as demand typically increases. She said she hoped their cost would decrease by the summer.\n\nThe bird flu outbreak, which began in the United States in early 2022, is a major factor in the high price of eggs, but not the only one. Under existing federal policy, one infected bird can necessitate culling part or all of a flock. And because areas where infected birds once lived must be disinfected and quarantined, and repopulating a flock takes time, production can be halted for months.\n\nThe effect of additional egg imports on supply and prices would depend on the scale. An agency spokesperson, speaking at a news conference, described the measure as temporary and nascent, and declined to give an estimate of how many eggs would be imported.\n\nBruce Babcock, an agricultural economist and professor at the University of California, Riverside, said the United States would need to import a significant number of eggs to bring down prices.\n\n\"If you really want to lower prices and use imports to do it, you need to bring in more like a billion eggs,\" he said.\n\nThe Egg Producers Central Union in Turkey recently announced that it would export 420 million eggs to the United States this year. That is equivalent to the number of eggs produced in the United States in about a day and half, according to the latest estimate from the Agriculture Department.\n\nSourcing from overseas may also prove challenging if foreign countries do not have a surplus of eggs ready to export. Babcock said that \"by the time that another country expands production to export to the U.S., hopefully bird flu will stop its destruction on the market and it won't make sense to import eggs anymore.\"\n\nThe other measures by the department build on steps taken under the Biden administration, which began projects in 2023 to assess biosecurity at poultry facilities, paid producers hundreds of millions of dollars for culling their flocks and explored vaccinating poultry.\n\nThe department spokesperson said Wednesday that the $1 billion in funding would come from the agency's Credit Commodity Corp., a pot of money that the Biden administration also used for combating avian flu.\n\nUnder the projects, wildlife technicians visited farms to identify biosecurity issues such as gaps in fencing or standing water that could attract wild birds and animals. Agriculture Department officials described the projects as highly successful and said that the agency would expand those audits and cover, for the first time, up to 75% of the cost of addressing identified issues.\n\nScientists applauded the additional funding for biosecurity enhancements and vaccine research, but cautioned that any plan should include robust surveillance.\n\nPoultry vaccines are already being used in some countries and many scientists support them. But they have not been used as a large-scale containment measure in the United States, in part because of concerns that vaccination would imperil U.S. exports.\n\nExperts also noted that the overall plan said little about containing avian flu in cattle. The disease has now reached nearly 1,000 herds in 17 states. Most recently, herds have been infected with a new version of the virus that has caused severe symptoms in several individuals and the only bird flu death in the United States.\n\n\"Part of the reason for high egg prices is actually what's happening in dairy cattle,\" said Anice C. Lowen, a flu virus researcher at Emory University.\n\nThis article originally appeared in The New York Times.","summary":"WASHINGTON -- As the price of eggs reaches record highs, the federal government is looking into importing more eggs from other countries and increasing funding for efforts to combat the spread of avian flu, the Agriculture Department said Wednesday.","url":"https://www.berkshireeagle.com/nyt/agriculture-department-looks-to-import-eggs-as-prices-soar/article_356f14e3-ec98-5f5d-b732-615884ea381b.html","image":"https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/berkshireeagle.com/content/tncms/custom/image/2b802cce-8455-11ec-8935-3f9640429655.jpg?resize=600%2C315","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-02-27 00:07:09","author":"Blox Content Management,Linda Qiu","authors":["Blox Content Management","Linda Qiu"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.134},{"id":294725576,"title":"LILLEY: Carney seemingly caught in easy lie about moving HQ to NYC","text":"But the bottom line is, Carney backed moving his company’s head office to the United States at a time when Donald Trump was already threatening Canada’s economy with 25% tariffs.

They also caught the attention of President Joe Biden.\n\nAnd Trump's recent comments on Ukraine's assets were not the first time in his new term that he has mentioned taking over a country's mineral holdings.\n\nThe president has talked about acquiring minerals in Greenland and Canada. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau of Canada told a group of business leaders that Trump's focus on Canada's minerals meant his threats to annex the country were \"a real thing.\"\n\nSeizing mineral wealth overseas has become a core foreign policy goal of Trump's and an impetus for his most imperialistic remarks since taking office. His instincts hark back to the drives of fallen empires, when resource extraction motivated rulers to expand territory.\n\nOn Tuesday, after nearly two weeks of difficult talks, Ukrainian and U.S. officials said they had reached agreement on a framework for sharing revenue from Ukraine's critical minerals.\n\nCritical minerals are nonfuel substances that are essential for energy technologies and at high risk of supply chain disruption, according to the U.S. Energy Department. They are found around the world -- including in Chile and Argentina, the Chinese-controlled Tibetan plateau, and Congo -- and are integral to common technologies (electric car batteries) and specialized ones (missile systems). In 2022, the U.S. Geological Survey released a list of 50 critical minerals that ranges from aluminum to zirconium.\n\nBecause of competition with China, the search for critical minerals has been important to the United States for nearly a decade.\n\nBiden, on the final overseas trip of his presidency, visited a U.S.-supported railway in Angola that would help transport critical minerals from Central Africa to the coast for export.\n\nState Department officials in his administration earlier set up a group of allied nations to discuss creating or reinforcing critical mineral supply chains outside China. And they established a sister forum so that mineral-rich countries could speak to potential client nations and foreign companies about developing mines and processing plants.\n\nUkraine, Greenland and Canada were all part of that. In fact, Ukraine and the United States came close to signing an agreement last fall in which Ukraine would have promised to give the United States a heads-up on potential projects, allowing American companies or those of allied nations enough lead time to bid for contracts. The State Department would also have given Ukraine technical assistance on mapping and writing regulations.\n\nThat has not been Trump's approach.\n\n\"Trump and his aides are talking in a way that is unnecessary,\" said Jose W. Fernandez, who was an architect of the State Department's initiatives on critical minerals in the Biden administration. \"These are countries that want investment. But they want partnerships. They are not looking for a colonial relationship.\"\n\nHe added that these countries were attracted to American financial and commercial partners because they did not like more coercive options, including proposals from China.\n\nIn September, President Volodymyr Zelenskyy of Ukraine began presenting a \"victory plan\" against Russia to allied governments as well as to Trump, who was running for president, that, among other things, offered partnerships on critical minerals.\n\nFernandez was scheduled to sign a memorandum of understanding in October with a deputy prime minister of Ukraine, Yulia Svyrydenko, the State Department said in an email sent to reporters at the time. But on Oct. 29, the day of the scheduled signing, she did not show up in Washington.\n\nSvyrydenko was then supposed to sign the agreement at a Ukraine reconstruction conference in Warsaw, Poland, on Nov. 13, but again did not appear.\n\nBy then Trump had won the election, and Ukrainian officials told U.S. diplomats that they preferred to wait to sign an agreement with the incoming administration, according to two former U.S. officials and a Ukrainian official with knowledge of the events.\n\nUkrainian officials had already been talking with some foreign businesspeople, including Ronald S. Lauder, a cosmetics heir who is a friend of Trump's, about investment opportunities in Ukraine's mineral sector.\n\nEarlier this month, Zelenskyy balked at the terms that Scott Bessent, the Treasury secretary, presented to him in Kyiv. The proposal called for Ukraine to give the United States half of its revenues from natural resources, including minerals, gas and oil, as well as earnings from ports and other infrastructure.\n\nTrump also initially demanded $500 billion for the United States. He said America deserved payment for the billions in weapons and budget aid it gave Ukraine during the Biden administration, even though the amount was a tiny fraction of annual U.S. federal spending. Critics called Trump's terms rapacious, colonialist and mercantilist.\n\nU.S. officials tempered some of the demands while continuing to pressure Svyrydenko and other Ukrainian negotiators to sign a deal. The current draft framework has a vague reference to security guarantees for Ukraine, which Zelenskyy has said are essential for preventing Russia from trying to launch another invasion after any future ceasefire to end the war. Trump said Wednesday that he does not plan to give \"very much\" of a guarantee.\n\n(BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM.)\n\n\"Many countries view their natural resources as central to national sovereignty and economic development potential,\" said Abigail Hunter, executive director of the Center for Critical Minerals Strategy at SAFE, an energy security research group. \"This makes negotiations over critical minerals highly sensitive, with governments wary of foreign control or exploitation.\"\n\n(END OPTIONAL TRIM.)\n\nChina has been on a yearslong push to develop global dominance in extracting and processing critical minerals. At the same time, the United States has had to import substantial amounts of critical minerals for commercial and military use.\n\nA report released this month from the Center for Strategic and International Studies noted that the United States imports 50% to 100% of each of 41 of the 50 critical minerals listed by the U.S. Geological Survey. China is the top producer for 29 of the minerals.\n\n(BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM.)\n\nAnd \"China has repeatedly shown its willingness to weaponize these minerals,\" the report said -- including imposing export controls and bans in the last two years on a range of raw minerals. Furthermore, it said, China now refines 40% to 90% of the globe's supply of rare earth elements, graphite, lithium, cobalt and copper.\n\nThe executive order that Trump signed in 2017 was intended to \"ensure secure and reliable\" supplies of critical minerals. The text ordered the interior secretary to publish a list of them, prompting the U.S. Geological Survey to post an assessment in 2018 and again four years later.\n\nSome foreign leaders tried to work this angle. Ashraf Ghani, then the president of Afghanistan, promoted his country's mineral wealth to Trump so that the U.S. president would keep U.S. troops in the nation, as the government battled a Taliban insurgency. Ghani's bid failed.\n\nBut minerals stayed on Trump's mind.\n\nIn September 2020, he signed an executive order pushing agencies to address the country's \"undue reliance\" on \"foreign adversaries\" for critical minerals, namely China.\n\n(END OPTIONAL TRIM.)\n\nThe disruptions in global supply chains during the coronavirus pandemic heightened anxieties within the U.S. government. Biden issued an executive order in early 2021 that, among other things, told the defense secretary to identify risks to the flow of critical minerals from abroad.\n\nThe next year, Fernandez, then the top economic official at the State Department, oversaw the agency's creation of the Minerals Security Partnership, a group of 15 nations looking to broaden global supply chains for critical minerals. The Trump White House and the Indian government mentioned that group in a joint statement when Trump met this month with Narendra Modi, the prime minister of India, saying their nations, both members of the group, could collaborate on critical minerals.\n\nLast year, the State Department created a sister forum with 15 producer nations, including Ukraine and Greenland, looking for investors to help grow their industries.\n\n\"The bottom line is Ukraine has been pursuing investments for a long time,\" Fernandez said.\n\nSo has Greenland.\n\nThe forum held a meeting in November in Nuuk, Greenland, where companies presented seven projects in the country to about 100 potential investors who called in by video.\n\nIn his first term, Trump became fixated on the idea of buying Greenland after prodding by Lauder, the cosmetics heir.\n\nAnother Trump business ally, Howard Lutnick, the president's commerce secretary, has ties to a mining project in Greenland, via an investment made by his firm, Cantor Fitzgerald, in a New York-based company called Critical Metals Corp., according to securities filings reviewed by The New York Times.\n\n(STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)\n\nSome top Trump aides were looking at the strategic dilemma involving China and critical minerals even before the start of this administration.\n\nLast July, Marco Rubio, then a senator representing Florida, cosponsored a bill to tackle the issue. After he became the secretary of state last month, he wrote in a cable that \"energy dominance\" would be a priority. It is unlikely that Rubio and other Trump officials will talk about using the minerals to help address the climate crisis or speed a clean energy transition, which Biden aides had done.\n\nOn a visit to the Dominican Republic this month, Rubio spoke about the potential for the country's rare earth minerals to be used for weapons systems and other advanced technologies.\n\n\"Having an ally with access to these elements in the hemisphere is very good,\" he said. \"We want to help develop this wealth of the Dominican Republic.\"\n\nThis article originally appeared in The New York Times.","summary":"WASHINGTON -- President Donald Trump's intense interest in Ukraine's minerals seemed to come from out of the blue.","url":"https://www.berkshireeagle.com/nyt/how-trump-and-bidens-focus-on-minerals-became-core-to-u-s-foreign-policy/article_89a34b86-ed27-5321-92b3-b79a2f3a629c.html","image":"https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/berkshireeagle.com/content/tncms/custom/image/2b802cce-8455-11ec-8935-3f9640429655.jpg?resize=600%2C315","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-02-27 00:06:33","author":"Blox Content Management,Edward Wong","authors":["Blox Content Management","Edward Wong"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.105},{"id":294733940,"title":"Immigration agents detain a Chicago adult during school drop-off, officials say","text":"A charter school network on the Southwest Side of Chicago informed parents that an adult was detained Wednesday morning by federal immigration officials outside a school building when dropping children off for class.\n\nU.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials did not immediately confirm the action.\n\nAdvocates say this may be the first time since President Donald Trump’s immigration crackdown started in January that ICE has detained an individual as children were arriving or leaving a Chicago school. The Trump administration last month said it would allow agents to make arrests at schools, churches and hospitals, ending a policy in effect since 2011. Still, Chicago school leaders have pledged not to allow ICE agents inside schools except when they have a proper criminal arrest warrant.\n\nArrests near schools are something parents have feared, even as they have been assured their children would be safe once they are in school, said Andrea Ortiz, director of organizing for the Brighton Park Neighborhood Council.\n\n“It is really terrifying for families and traumatizing for students,” she said.\n\nAcero Schools, the charter school network that informed parents about the situation, said it is providing support for those directly impacted.\n\n“We understand how stressful and upsetting this is to our school communities,” network officials wrote in a message to parents on Wednesday.\n\nIn the communication to parents, Acero officials said at 8:15 a.m., agents from ICE and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives approached an individual in a car outside of Soto High School at 5025 S. St Louis Ave. in Gage Park.\n\nStaff from the school escorted two students from the car into school and no one was hurt, according to the communication to parents. Soto High School is on the same campus as an Acero elementary school, so it is unclear what school the children attended. An individual was detained, according to the Acero letter.\n\nAcero Chief Culture Officer Helena Stangle said in a statement that staff followed protocols. She said Acero has a civil rights resource hub on its website and regularly shares information about “know your rights” sessions that parents can attend.\n\nThe charter school network pledged to parents that it will continue monitoring “activity to ensure the safest environment for all our students.”\n\nAcero has seen a decline in typical attendance rates by as much as 4% since January, though Stangle said in the statement they don’t know if this is fully attributable to the Trump administration’s threats of mass deportation.\n\nOrtiz said it is “comforting to see that school administrators have acted fast and have moved to connect families to resources and secure the safety of their families.” After the initial wave of fear right after Trump’s inauguration, she said families were starting to feel more comfortable sending their children to school.\n\nNow, she worries this incident will “refuel those fears.” Still, Ortiz said she hopes people will understand that the community can be “more powerful than ICE.”\n\nThe “community is committed to ensuring families feel prepared and ready in this fight,” she said.\n\nSarah Karp covers education for WBEZ.

This was rather easy for him to do, since the elephant was standing 10 feet away, dressed all in black, hovering over the head of the table at which the president and the members of his Cabinet sat.\n\n\"Is anybody unhappy with Elon?\" Trump asked. Nervous laughter began to ripple around the room. \"If you are,\" Trump continued, \"we'll throw him out of here.\" The Cabinet members started clapping.\n\nIt was meant as a joke -- but just how funny did the various officials and aides crammed into the Cabinet room really find the situation to be?\n\nDays earlier, Elon Musk had gone over all their heads, ordering millions of federal workers to submit a written explanation of how they spend their days or else face termination.\n\nSome of the Cabinet secretaries and agency heads balked. Employees at the departments of State (led by Marco Rubio, who sat on Trump's right) and Defense (led by Pete Hegseth, who sat on Trump's left) were told not to comply with Musk's order. Same for the departments of Energy, Homeland Security and Justice.\n\nMusk then began to post about the many people who had \"failed even that inane test, urged on in some cases by their managers.\" The White House press secretary was unable or unwilling to explain what was happening or who reported to whom. It seemed as if the first true power struggle of the second Trump administration was underway.\n\nThe president tried to pretend all was well, but he seemed to understand Wednesday that there was trouble in his court. \"ALL CABINET MEMBERS ARE EXTREMELY HAPPY WITH ELON,\" he posted a few hours before the meeting. \"The Media will see that at the Cabinet Meeting this morning!!!\"\n\nThe Cabinet members stared expectantly at Musk as he stood up a few minutes into the meeting and began to hold forth.\n\nAt first, it seemed as if he might have been relegated to a lesser power position in the meeting. He was not given an actual seat at the table; he was put in the row of chairs behind it, alongside other aides who are not at the Cabinet level, such as Stephen Miller and Peter Navarro. But then the president asked the tech mogul to speak first -- \"I'd like to have Elon Musk please say a few words\" -- and Musk spent much of the rest of the meeting standing over the table at which the Cabinet members sat. He spoke far more than anyone else, other than Trump.\n\nMusk explained to the Cabinet members that he had sent that demand to their employees only after clearing it with the president.\n\n\"I said, 'Can we send out an email to everyone just saying what did you get done last week,' and the president said yes,\" he told them. This was a reversal of the way things usually work in Washington -- it used to be that underlings would take the fall even if the boss was to blame. Now the underling was publicly pointing the finger at the boss to mollify the other underlings he had trampled over, while the boss nodded along.\n\nIt was fascinating to watch Musk as he attempted to manage both up and down at the same time. \"President Trump has put together the best Cabinet ever, literally,\" he said. \"I don't think that such a talented team has ever been assembled.\"\n\nThe talented team stared back at him. He was costumed very differently from them. He wore a black MAGA hat and the same \"Tech Support\" T-shirt he had on last week when he sat for a joint interview with the president on Fox News. \"I actually just call myself a humble tech support,\" the world's richest man said, chuckling at this little bit of modesty. A few Cabinet secretaries laughed along politely.\n\nMusk tried to appeal to their sense of pity for the difficult work he has undertaken. \"I'm taking a lot of flak,\" he said, \"and getting a lot of death threats, by the way.\" He wanted them to understand just how crucial his work is. \"If we don't do this,\" he said, slowing down for emphasis, \"America will go bankrupt. That's why it has to be done.\" (A report in The Washington Post published Wednesday found that Musk's business empire is built on $38 billion in government funding.)\n\nThe many heads in the room turned back and forth, looking to Musk one minute and Trump the next. The members of the Cabinet must contend with two billionaire bosses -- both of whom command millions of followers on the social media platforms they own, and who are known for attacking anyone who dares to defy them.\n\nBut before the first Cabinet meeting of the second Trump administration adjourned, the president made sure everyone knew who was actually in charge. A reporter wanted to know how he thought about \"executive control\" and the power of the presidency. \"Is it your view of your authority,\" the reporter asked, \"that you have the power to call up any one or all of the people seated at this table and issue orders that they're bound to follow?\"\n\nTrump lowered his voice somewhat dramatically. \"Oh, yeah,\" he said, \"they'll follow the orders, yes, they will.\"\n\nNobody mistook that one for a joke.\n\nThis article originally appeared in The New York Times.","summary":"WASHINGTON -- About 12 minutes into the first meeting of his new Cabinet, President Donald Trump addressed the elephant in the room.

While there, he praised the president, saying, “We are all truly blessed … to have a leader like President Trump who is a builder.” \n\nUnanue’s comments stirred public uproar, given Trump’s statements directed toward Mexican-Americans and immigration policies. A public boycott of Goya food products followed, echoed by Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Former Housing and Urban Development Secretary Julián Castro. \n\nUnanue declined to retract his comments, saying it was a “suppression of speech.” Soon after, Republican voters launched an “anti-boycott” campaign. Unanue said that the company experienced a 1,000% sales spike as a result.\n\nGoya’s board of directors voted to censure Unanue in January 2021, effectively banning him from speaking to the media, CNN said. The action was taken after the CEO claimed in an interview with Fox Business that the 2020 presidential election was “unverified” and that it was the dawn of a “new world order and great reset” on the day of former President Joe Biden’s inauguration on Jan. 20, 2021. \n\nAt the time, the nine-person board was in favor of removing Unanue from the company entirely, but the regulations of the family-owned business, founded in 1936 by Prudencio Unanue Ortiz — Robert Unanue’s grandfather — would not allow it, as noted by the New York Post.\n\nUnanue repeated those false election claims during an appearance at CPAC 2021. He claimed Trump was “the real, legitimate, and still actual president” and that the Georgia election was “not legitimate.”\n\nUnanue also served as executive producer on the 2023 film “Sound of Freedom,” a thriller based on the life of an anti-trafficking advocate, which further entrenched the Goya leader with far-right supporters. \n\n“Supporting the film has become a cause du jour for the MAGA crowd,” the Los Angeles Times noted at the time. \n\nTrump himself hosted a screening of “Freedom” at his Bedminster golf course that summer. Unanue also spoke in support of Trump at the Republican National Convention last summer. \n\nWhile Unanue did not confirm his departure Monday, he seems geared toward an exit from the company. He said he intends to focus on his philanthropic efforts, namely eliminating the child trafficking.

These require shoemakers to source products only from Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS)-certified factories, whether in India or overseas. However, the certification process for overseas factories did not take off as the government wanted to curb imports and build local manufacturing, leading to a stock shortage in the premium segment, executives said.A government official confirmed that BIS has started the approval process, as was directed by senior officials. China Out of Equation The process for each factory will take two to three months since it undertakes quality audits, the official said.However, factories in China and those owned by the Chinese in other markets are still out of the approval process, said people in the know. BIS is ready to approve factories in Malaysia, Thailand, Vietnam, Bangladesh and elsewhere, industry executives said. The companies have been asked to give the details of their suppliers, said the government official cited above. Chinese suppliers are unlikely to receive any approval, he added.US-headquartered Nike Inc, which is dependent on imports for its India operations, had made multiple representations to the Indian government for BIS approval of its global suppliers with no success, industry executives said. Finally, it raised the issue with the US government ahead of Prime Minister Narendra Modi's meeting with Trump earlier this month, which helped.The industry also lobbied hard, citing a sales slump at the top end of the market despite high demand when the country is trying to improve consumption, executives said. They argued that India does not yet have the capability to manufacture sophisticated premium shoes that require high-end machinery and skills, and that existing capacity is not sufficient to meet domestic demand. While the footwear industry...has shifted some production to India, including by us, for non-leather premium shoes, capabilities are still limited, said Harkirat Singh, managing director of Woodland.118586730Supply TroublesFootwear imports into the country decreased to $299.76 million in calendar 2023 from $920.34 million in 2022. Emails sent to BIS, Nike Inc and Reliance Retail, which sells Armani Exchange and Superdry in India, remained unanswered BIS officials have started visiting overseas shoe factories from this month, the Indian chief executive of a large global brand told ET. We lost over six to eight months of business with practically no stock. BIS has so far inspected one overseas supplier factory of the brand, the CEO said.Shailesh Chaturvedi, chief executive of Arvind Fashions, said its footwear growth was affected because of delay in certification of factories. The company sells brands such as US Polo and Tommy Hilfiger in India. Footwear is a large business for us, and we are looking at strong leadership, Chaturvedi told analysts earlier this month. Now, because of the government regulation..., the import of footwear has come to a standstill. So, in some of our big brands like US Polo and in Tommy Hilfiger, we saw a sharp decline in business. Chaturvedi said this issue should be over in six months, with some of the factories in the process of getting approved and more production in India. So, I would say the worst is behind us... In the last nine months, we did lose business in footwear because of the lack of inventory, but things are looking up, he said.The government has also regulated imports of toys and electronic goods like televisions, air-conditioners, smartphones and lighting products-particularly from China-with higher import duties, import licensing and making BIS approvals mandatory. This has prompted several companies to shift production of these products to India.","summary":"Global brands like Nike, Tommy Hilfiger, and Superdry may soon resume importing premium footwear to India as the government has initiated certification of overseas factories after 18 months.

It was the only license that the administration issued for Venezuela that day.\n\n“The U.S. government has made a damaging and inexplicable decision by announcing sanctions against the U.S. company Chevron,” Venezuelan Vice President Delcy Rodriguez said in a statement posted on Telegram.\n\nShe said “these kinds of failed decisions” had prompted migration out of Venezuela.\n\nThe White House and the U.S. State Department did not immediately respond to requests for further detail on Trump’s comments.\n\nChevron said it was aware of Trump’s post and considering its implications.\n\nChevron exports about 240,000 barrels per day of crude from its Venezuela operations, over a quarter of the country’s entire oil output.\n\nEnding the license means Chevron will no longer be able to export Venezuelan crude. And if Venezuela’s state oil company PDVSA exports oil previously exported by Chevron, U.S. refineries will be unable to buy it due to U.S. sanctions.\n\nSince his return to office in January, Trump has repeatedly said the U.S. does not need Venezuelan oil and left open the possibility of revoking Chevron’s operating license.\n\nDuring his first term, Trump pursued a “maximum pressure” sanctions policy against Maduro’s government, especially targeting Venezuela’s energy business.\n\nAfter initially easing sanctions to encourage fair and democratic elections, Biden in April reinstated broad oil sanctions, saying Maduro failed to keep his electoral promises. But Biden had left the Chevron license intact, along with U.S. authorizations granted to several other foreign oil companies.\n\nTax and royalty payments resulting from Chevron’s license have provided a steady source of revenue to Maduro’s administration since early 2023, a source familiar with Venezuela’s oil industry said. The money has lifted Venezuela’s economy, especially its oil and banking sectors, which expanded last year.\n\nU.S. Energy Secretary Chris Wright said on Wednesday after Trump’s comments that the U.S. is the world’s largest oil producer and “small interruptions from other nations” will not affect global supply.\n\nIn early February, Trump said that Caracas had agreed to receive all Venezuelan migrants in the United States illegally and provide for their transportation back.\n\nThat came a day after U.S. envoy Richard Grenell met with Maduro in Caracas and brought six U.S. detainees back.\n\nTrump said in Wednesday’s post that Maduro had not met “electoral conditions” and that he was not transporting Venezuelans back to the United States at a pace that had been agreed to.\n\nTrump did not detail what he meant by “electoral conditions.” Maduro’s last two election wins were both disputed by Washington, with Venezuela’s opposition saying it won the July 2024 presidential election by a landslide, an assertion backed by the U.S. and other Western countries.\n\nThe oil concession agreement would be terminated as of the March 1 option to renew, Trump added.\n\nIt was not immediately clear what would happen with cargoes of Venezuelan crude currently navigating to U.S. ports or about to depart from Venezuela through the end of the month.\n\nMaduro and his government have always rejected sanctions by the United States and others, saying they are illegitimate measures that amount to an “economic war” designed to cripple Venezuela.\n\nMaduro and his allies have cheered what they say is the country’s resilience despite the measures, though they have historically blamed some economic hardships and shortages on sanctions.\n\nWhen the license was first issued, Chevron was owed about $3 billion by Venezuela. According to the company’s debt recovery plan, explained by sources, by the end of 2024 it should have recouped some $1.7 billion as oil output approached an average of 200,000 barrels per day as expected.\n\nChevron’s automatically renewing license allowed it to expand crude output at joint ventures with PDVSA and send some 240,000 bpd to its own refineries and other customers.\n\nIt was the second blow to Chevron this month.\n\nChevron said earlier in February it will lay off up to 20% of its global staff by the end of 2026 as part of an effort to cut costs and simplify the business. Chevron told its employees that the company was falling behind competitors and struggled to quickly make decisions.","summary":"WASHINGTON,  (Reuters) &#8211; U.S. President Donald Trump today said he was reversing a license given to Chevron CVX.N \n\n\nThe article Trump axes Chevron&#8217;s Venezuela oil licence, citing lack of electoral reforms appeared first on Stabroek News.","url":"https://www.stabroeknews.com/2025/02/26/news/regional/trump-axes-chevrons-venezuela-oil-licence-citing-lack-of-electoral-reforms/","image":"https://s1.stabroeknews.com/images/2025/02/chevron-logo.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-02-26 23:59:28","author":"Staff Editor","authors":["Staff Editor"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gy","sentiment":-0.423},{"id":294724604,"title":"Trump admin cutting more than 90% of USAID’s foreign aid contracts: docs","text":"WASHINGTON (AP) — The Trump administration says it is eliminating more than 90% of the U.S. Agency for International Development’s foreign aid contracts and $60 billion in overall U.S. assistance around the world, according to an internal memo obtained by The Associated Press.\n\nIt details the outcome of a 90-day review ordered by President Donald Trump of all the money provided by USAID and the State Department for development and aid work overseas.\n\nThe move leaves few surviving USAID projects for advocates to try to save in what are ongoing court battles.

The 2009 finding under the Clean Air Act is the legal underpinning of a host of climate regulations for motor vehicles, power plants and other pollution sources.\n\nHere's the latest:\n\n VA halts contract cuts after concerns about health services \n\nThe Department of Veterans Affairs has temporarily suspended billions of dollars in planned contract cuts following concerns that the move would hurt critical veterans health services, lawmakers and veterans service organizations said Wednesday.\n\nThe pause affects hundreds of VA contracts that Secretary Doug Collins described a day earlier as simply consulting deals whose cancellation would save $2 billion as the Trump administration works to slash costs across the federal government.\n\nA partial list of contracts up for cancellation and reviewed by The Associated Press shows the cuts would have affected everything from cancer care to the ability to assess toxic exposure. It underscores how the administration’s approach to broad spending cuts has immediate and potentially unintended consequences.\n\n“We will not be eliminating any benefits or services to Veterans or VA beneficiaries,” VA press secretary Pete Kasperowicz said in a statement.\n\n▶ Read more about the pause to billions in contract cuts\n\n Trump signs executive order seeking more power for Musk’s government efficiency team \n\nTrump has signed an executive order meant to expand the power and reach of his governmental cost-cutting effort led by Elon Musk.\n\nThe lengthy order directs federal agencies to develop new systems for distributing and justifying payments so they could be monitored by Musk’s representatives.\n\nIt also limits federal employee travel and freezes most agency credit cards unless they’re used for disaster relief or supervisors create an exception.\n\nThe order intends a “transformation” in federal spending on contracts, grants and loans. It says it’s meant to make such transactions “transparent” and that government employees “are accountable to the American public.”\n\n Democratic senator asks FAA for documents on SpaceX deal to make sure it wasn’t due to political favoritism \n\nSen. Edward Markey, of Massachusetts, asked Wednesday in a letter to the agency overseeing airplane safety whether a deal to install equipment from SpaceX unit Starlink at several air traffic control facilities was part of a competitive bidding process.\n\nThe senator also asked whether employees at Musk’s satellite company now deployed to FAA facilities had signed “ethics agreements” making sure they weren’t using their access to reward their employer.\n\nThe Associated Press has reported that at least three SpaceX employees have gotten special “ethics waivers” releasing them from normal rules requiring them to recuse themselves from government projects that could help Musk’s company.\n\n“I urge the FAA to be transparent about this agreement and ensure that Musk does not wrongfully steer federal funds to his companies,” Markey wrote.\n\n▶ Read more about the deal\n\n House Democrat urges Trump to rescind order seeking greater control of independent regulators \n\nA top Democrat in the U.S. House is urging Trump to reverse a recent executive order seeking to give the White House direct control of independent federal regulatory agencies such as the Federal Election Commission and the Securities and Exchange Commission.\n\nRep. Joe Morelle from New York, a ranking member of the Committee on House Administration, called Trump’s directive “an unprecedented violation of American rule of law” in the letter sent Wednesday. Morelle said Trump’s order ignores that Congress “specifically designed certain independent regulatory agencies to exist outside of White House control.”\n\nThe order signed Feb. 18 by Trump says the change is needed so the federal government can be “truly accountable to the American people.” It argues the president must be able to supervise and control officials who “wield vast executive power.”\n\n Head of EPA privately urges Trump administration to reconsider finding behind US action against climate change \n\nIn a potential landmark action, the head of the EPA has privately urged the Trump administration to reconsider a scientific finding that has long been the central basis for U.S. action against climate change.\n\nIn a report to the White House, EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin called for a rewrite of the agency’s finding that greenhouse gases endanger public health and welfare. Four people who were briefed on the matter spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity because the recommendation is not public.\n\nThe 2009 finding under the Clean Air Act is the legal underpinning of a host of climate regulations for motor vehicles, power plants and other pollution sources.\n\nA spokesperson for the EPA on Wednesday declined to reveal Zeldin’s recommendation, which was made last week under an executive order from Trump.\n\nThe Washington Post first reported that Zeldin had urged the White House to strike down the endangerment finding.\n\n▶ Read more about Zeldin’s recommendation\n\nAssociated Press reporter Matthew Daly contributed to this report from Washington.\n\n Musk said USAID funds to fight Ebola are flowing. Agency officials say that’s not true \n\nNo U.S. Agency on International Development funds for Ebola response have been released since Trump froze foreign aid Jan. 20, a USAID official said Wednesday.\n\nMusk said during Trump’s first Cabinet meeting that as his team rushes to cut spending, “one of the things we accidentally canceled very briefly was Ebola prevention.”\n\nThe administration has yet to approve any release of USAID funds for the current Ebola outbreak in Uganda, the official said.\n\nThe official spoke on condition of anonymity for fear of retaliation after the administration banned employees from commenting publicly.\n\nUSAID staffers and partner organizations say all payments have stopped even after a judge temporarily blocked the funding freeze.\n\nAssociated Press reporter Ellen Knickmeyer contributed to this report from Washington.\n\n Democratic governors pitch state jobs to federal workers cut by Trump \n\nSome of America’s governors — mostly Democrats — have a message for the wave of fired federal workers: We want you.\n\nThe governors are welcoming former federal staffers who lost their jobs in the Trump administration’s widespread cost-cutting agenda to apply for government jobs in their states. Some places are holding job fairs, while Hawaii’s governor says the state is fast-tracking hiring for these applicants.\n\nThe effort amounts to a small level of resistance against the Republican president and potentially a bit of political maneuvering from the leaders in blue states, eager to be seen as the party helping workers in need. In most cases, the governors are trying to fill up long lists of job openings in their states, and in some the effort involved simply directing people to an online jobs page.\n\n▶ Read more about governors and fired federal workers\n\n Sen. Patty Murray calls Trump and Musk ‘out of touch billionaires’ \n\nSpeaking during a news conference with three fired federal workers, the Democrat from Washington state also said Trump and Musk don’t care if they “burn down something really important.”\n\n“The Trump/Musk firing spree continues to be as surgical as a wrecking ball,” Murray said. “That is no way to treat people who have dedicated themselves to our country, often for years. And many of them, by the way, are veterans. Nearly a third of our federal workforce are veterans, people who are literally put their lives on the line for our country, and now we’re all seeing what Trump and Musk think about that.”\n\nEmily Connor, a grants specialist for the Federal Transit Administration, was fired Feb. 14 along with about 10% of the staff in their regional office, which covers Washington, Oregon and Idaho.\n\n“Whoever’s left is stuck picking up the pieces of what is literally an impossible workload with no transition plan whatsoever,” she said.\n\n EU-US diplomatic talks are called off as political tensions increase \n\nA planned meeting between European Union foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas and U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio was abruptly canceled Wednesday.\n\nBoth sides blamed scheduling challenges, but European officials said they were caught off-guard. Notably, Kallas had previewed her planned talks with Rubio to reporters in Brussels just two days ago.\n\nPolitical tensions have increased between Europe and the United States recently and the cancellation comes after the State Department instructed U.S. diplomats in a memo seen by The Associated Press to step up demands on Europe to protect free speech and end what the Trump administration says are loose migration policies.\n\n Musk said his team’s rush to cut spending mistakenly led to canceling Ebola virus prevention efforts \n\n“We will make mistakes,” Musk said during Trump’s first Cabinet meeting Wednesday.\n\nHe cited as an example that, while hustling to dramatically shrink the U.S. Agency on International Development, “One of the things we accidentally canceled very briefly was Ebola prevention.”\n\nU.S. officials familiar with the matter had said as of last week in court filings, and interviews, that no USAID money was flowing — including for efforts to combat the spread of Ebola.\n\n China will try to influence Musk, a Republican lawmaker says \n\n“I do believe that (the Chinese Communist leaders) will try and leverage any opportunity,” said Rep. John Moolenaar, Republican chairman of the House Select Committee on China, during a Tuesday talk at the Brookings Institution in Washington.\n\nMusk, a close Trump ally, has extensive business connections in China, including a gigafactory to make Tesla vehicles and a battery factory in Shanghai.\n\nMoolenaar went on to say of Musk: “Are people going to be looking for that and make sure that his lane is one that is not influencing China policy? I believe that is the case.” He didn’t elaborate.\n\nRep. Raja Krishnamoorthi, the Democratic ranking member of the committee, said Chinese leaders would try to use Musk to bypass more hawkish voices on China in the Trump administration.\n\n“My hope is that the president is going to be listening to everybody very carefully,” said Krishnamoorthi, who appeared with Moolenaar at the event.\n\n Trump says Ukraine could ‘forget about’ joining NATO as he prepares to host Zelenskyy for talks \n\nTrump also said Wednesday that he hopes to soon speak face to face with Russian President Vladimir Putin in hopes of reaching an agreement to end the war in Ukraine that began when Moscow invaded in February 2022.\n\nThe Republican president declined to detail what concessions he would ask the two sides to make, but he underscored his administration’s position that Ukraine’s aspiration to join NATO, the Western military alliance, is not tenable.\n\n“NATO, you can forget about it,” Trump said. “I think that’s probably the reason the whole thing started.”\n\n During Cabinet meeting, Trump says tariffs are coming, but struggles on specific timelines \n\nThe president had some confusion about his tariff timelines, but he appeared to suggest he’ll impose them broadly.\n\nAsked if he planned to impose his tariffs on Canada and Mexico on March 4 after a 30-day suspension, Trump said the tariffs would start April 2. He appeared to be conflating these taxes on imports with his separate plan to raise import taxes to match the rates charged by other countries, which could target Europe, based off the U.S. president’s statements.\n\nCommerce Secretary Howard Lutnick clarified for Trump on Canada and Mexico that they needed to show progress on stopping illegal immigration and drug smuggling. Trump claims border crossings have dropped because of his own domestic policies, not the actions of America’s two largest trading partners.\n\n“At the end of that 30 days, they have to prove to the president that they satisfied him,” Lutnick said of Canada and Mexico.\n\n Senate confirms Jamieson Greer to be Trump’s top trade negotiator as battles loom \n\nThe Senate has confirmed Jamieson Greer, a veteran of Trump’s first-term economic battles with China, Mexico and Canada, to be America’s top trade negotiator.\n\nAs U.S. trade representative, Greer will work with Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, a billionaire financier, to oversee Trump’s aggressive trade agenda. Greer’s nomination cleared the Senate by a 56-43 vote Wednesday.\n\nEconomists warn that Trump’s planned tariffs will raise prices and risk rekindling inflation while drawing retaliation from other countries.\n\nGreer, a former Air Force lawyer, was chief of staff to Trump’s first-term trade representative, Robert Lighthizer. In that position, Greer was involved in talks with China at a time when the world’s two largest economies were hitting each other’s products with tariffs in the biggest trade brawl since the 1930s.\n\n Robert F. Kennedy Jr. describes major measles outbreak as ‘not unusual’ \n\nThe nation’s top health official was asked about a child who died in Texas’ largest measles outbreak in 30 years.\n\nThe child’s death in West Texas, where officials say at least 124 people have been infected by the deadly virus, is the first U.S. measles death in about a decade.\n\nKennedy was asked about the unvaccinated child’s passing during Trump’s first official meeting with his Cabinet on Wednesday.\n\nKennedy said his agency is “watching” the outbreak, but didn’t provide specifics on how.\n\n Pair of Senate Democrats say layoffs threaten modernization of organ transplant system \n\nSens. Ron Wyden of Oregon and Bernie Sanders of Vermont wrote newly installed Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. on Wednesday, saying he “committed to ensure proper staffing” for the congressionally mandated transplant overhaul during his confirmation hearings.\n\n“You have a duty to fulfill your commitment,” the pair wrote.\n\nAmong thousands of workers purged from U.S. health agencies in recent weeks are some experts specially hired by the Health Resources and Services Administration to implement the 2023 law. Patient groups including the National Kidney Foundation are urging their reinstatement.\n\nThe senators asked Kennedy to respond by next week to questions about the dismissals, how he will ensure improvements to organ donation and transplantation and when they’ll be completed.\n\n Supreme Court seems likely to rule for Ohio woman claiming job bias because she’s straight \n\nThe outcome of the case could remove an additional requirement that some courts apply when members of a majority group, including those who are white and heterosexual, sue for discrimination under federal law.\n\nSupreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh stated a way of resolving the case that seemed to enjoy broad support among his colleagues. “Discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation, whether you are gay or straight, is prohibited. The rules are the same whichever way it goes,” Kavanaugh said.\n\nThe justices heard arguments in an appeal from Marlean Ames, who’s worked for the Ohio Department of Youth Services for more than 20 years. Ames contends she was passed over for a promotion and then demoted because she is heterosexual. Both the job she sought and the one she had held were given to LGBTQ+ people.\n\nTitle VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 bars sex discrimination in the workplace. A trial court and an appeals court ruled against Ames.\n\n▶ Read more about the Supreme Court hearing\n\n Cuts to federal agencies could also mean moving out of the Washington area \n\nThe Trump administration’s memo calling for agencies to prepare for sweeping cuts includes a provision allowing them to consider moving federal offices to cheaper-rent areas.\n\nThat would open the door to a longtime Republican priority of relocating much of the federal bureaucracy from Washington, D.C., to conservative parts of the country.\n\nTrump tried this in his first term, moving the headquarters of the Bureau of Land Management to the mid-sized Colorado city of Grand Junction, about 250 miles west of Denver. About 300 staffers quit or retired rather than make the move, which, of course, may be exactly the outcome the new administration wants.\n\nBiden moved BLM’s headquarters back to Denver in 2021 and its western headquarters remains in Grand Junction.\n\n Justice Department nominee doesn’t commit to not firing attorneys over their political views \n\nHarmeet Dhillon, nominee for the Justice Department’s assistant attorney general for civil rights, said she “cannot commit to any particular personnel decision” when asked if she would vow to not fire or reassign career attorneys in the division over who they voted for or their views on the 2020 election, which Trump has falsely claimed was stolen from him.\n\nBut she said it is her “general practice to not react to people based solely on their political views.”\n\nDhillon, who has represented Trump multiple times in court, also dodged questions asking what she would do if the president asked her to do something she believed was illegal or unconstitutional.\n\n“In all of those years in multiple cases in multiple jurisdictions, the president has never asked me to do anything I found objectionable, immoral, unlawful or illegal, so I really can’t fathom the circumstances you’re describing,” she told the U.S. Senate Committee on the Judiciary during an initial hearing Wednesday.\n\n Trump thinks they’l l sell ‘a lot’ of ‘gold cards’ with a path to citizenship \n\nThe president said he plans to start selling the so-called “gold cards” for $5 million, and they’ll include a path to citizenship.\n\nSecretary of Commerce Howard Lutnik said that would replace the EB-5 program offered to investors who spent about $1 million on a company that employs at least 10 people.\n\n“If we sell a million, that’s $5 trillion dollars,” Trump said, adding he wants to use that money to pay off the country’s debt.\n\n“I think we will sell a lot because I think there’s really a thirst,” Trump said. “No other country can do this because people don’t want to go to other countries. They want to come here. Everybody wants to come here, especially since Nov. 5.”\n\n Justice Department nominee pressed on birthright citizenship \n\nAaron Reitz, nominee for assistant attorney general for the Justice Department’s legal policy office, was pressed multiple times over previous comments that birthright citizenship is “not a thing” during an initial Senate committee hearing Wednesday hearing.\n\n“There are reasonable debates to be had about the meaning and application and scope about what is commonly called birthright citizenship,” he said.\n\nTrump has attempted to eliminate birthright citizenship, upending more than a century of precedent.\n\n Assistant attorney general nominee speaks about DEI, anti-Semitism on college campuses \n\nConservative attorney Harmeet Dhillon, Trump’s nominee for the Justice Department’s assistant attorney general for civil rights, slammed diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives and anti-Semitism on college campuses during an initial Senate hearing Wednesday morning.\n\n“The president and Attorney General Bondi have made clear that diversity, equity and inclusion as it’s been applied to use racial quotas to deny people equal access to education, employment, even potentially housing and other aspects of civil life are inappropriate,” she said. “So we’ll certainly be taking a look at all of those and enforcing the law equally for all Americans.”\n\nWhen urged to “root out” DEI on college campuses and asked if “reverse racism is still racism,” Dhillon responded by saying, “I don’t even use the term ‘reverse racism.’ It’s just racism.”\n\nDhillon also committed to “defending people of faith equally” when asked multiple times about harassment of typically religiously affiliated anti-abortion centers commonly referred to as pregnancy crisis centers.\n\n Trump says a deal on earth minerals with Ukraine can bring the US ‘great wealth’ \n\nThe president suggested that a deal can help make up for all the military aid the Biden administration sent to Ukraine over the years — while potentially generating a lot more revenue.\n\nTrump said Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy is “coming to sign the dealt and it’s a great thing. It’s a great deal for Ukraine too.”\n\n Trump told members of his Cabinet they should be looking to make deep cuts at their agencies \n\nIn one example, the president said Lee Zeldin, head of the Environmental Protection Agency, should cut 65% of employees at the agency.\n\n Trump says, so far, he’s ‘impressed’ with all of his Cabinet \n\nHe noted that only a month has passed since he took the White House anew but, “Right now, I’m impressed with everybody” in his Cabinet.\n\nThe president singled out for praise Secretary of State Marco Rubio. But he talked at length about Musk and his mass federal firings, saying “we’re cutting down government.”\n\n“We’re cutting down the size of government,” Trump said. “We have to.”\n\n Trump says Zelenskyy will visit White House to sign critical minerals deal \n\nTrump made the announcement Wednesday at start of his first Cabinet meeting.\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said the framework of the economic deal with the United States is ready but it doesn’t yet offer U.S. security guarantees Kyiv views as vital for its war against the Russian invasion.\n\nSince returning to office last month, Trump let Ukraine know that he wanted something in return for tens of billions of dollars in U.S. help fending off the Russian forces that launched a full-scale invasion just over three years ago on Feb. 24, 2022.\n\n Assistant attorney general nominee questioned on election integrity \n\nHarmeet Dhillon, a conservative attorney who’s represented Trump and is now his nominee for the Justice Department’s assistant attorney general for civil rights, was questioned over election integrity during a Wednesday morning Senate hearing.\n\nSen. Marsha Blackburn, a Republican from Tennessee, asked Dhillon about her views on voter roll challenges, which Democrats and voting rights advocates have called unfounded attempts to sow distrust in the voting process and disenfranchise voters as states are already required to maintain their rolls.\n\nDhillon responded by applauding Tennessee for “cleaning up your voter rolls” and said she’s “100% in favor of clean voter rolls.”\n\nShe also said requiring proof of citizenship “would be a tremendous boost to voter confidence in the integrity of elections in the states if there is an insurance that only citizens are voting, similarly that they’re only voting once.”\n\n Trump’s convenes the first Cabinet meeting of his second term \n\nTrump convened the meeting along with Musk, who is not a Cabinet member.\n\nMany of Trump’s top picks have been confirmed by the Senate. Musk, a senior adviser who’s leading an effort shrink the federal government, didn’t require confirmation.\n\n“We’re gonna solve a lot of problems,” Trump said at the top of the meeting. \n\nTrump invited Musk to speak first at the meeting, saying his cost-cutting work “seems to be of great interest to everyone.” He said there were many Americans who have “such admiration” for the mass firings and government cuts Musk is leading.\n\nMusk, as he has in the past, described himself as simple “tech support” for the government, saying “it’s ironic, but it’s true.”\n\nCabinet members were asked if they were happy with Musk a few minutes into the meeting. Musk started to answer the question. But Trump interjected and said he might want to let Cabinet members answer, before joking that if anyone disagreed, he might “throw them out.”\n\n Trump posts a video promoting his proposal for redeveloping the Gaza Strip \n\nThe video posted to the president’s Truth Social account late Tuesday shows photographs of what appears to be decimated Gaza streets and neighborhoods replaced with images of beach hotels, dancing women and shops selling gold over a pulsating soundtrack.\n\nTrump’s proposal to develop Gaza’s Mediterranean coast into a Riviera replete with luxury casinos and resorts has met with significant criticism in the Middle East.\n\nThe song lyrics, in English, appear intended to appeal to Palestinians, many thousands of which would be displaced by the plan and are absolutely opposed to it, but there was no immediate way to gauge reaction.\n\n“Donald’s coming to set you free,” the song says.\n\nThe video closes with a photoshopped image of Trump and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu reclining poolside and sipping brightly colored drinks.\n\n Trump administration sets stage for large-scale federal worker layoffs in new memo \n\nFederal agencies must develop plans to eliminate employee positions, according to a memo distributed by Trump’s administration that sets in motion what could become a sweeping realignment of American government.\n\nThe memo expands the Republican president’s effort to downsize the federal workforce, which he’s described as bloated and impediment to his agenda. Thousands of probationary employees have already been fired, and now his administration is turning its attention to career officials with civil service protection.\n\nAgencies are directed to submit by March 13 their plans for what is known as a reduction in force, which would not only lay off employees but eliminate the position altogether. The result could be extensive changes in how government functions.\n\n▶ Read more about the government layoffs\n\n US sanctions Iranian drone procurement firms in China and Hong Kong \n\nThe Treasury Department’s Office of Foreign Assets sanctioned the six companies which are accused of helping procure drone parts for sanctioned Iranian firm Pishtazan Kavosh Gostar Boshra and its subsidiary Narin Sepehr Mobin Isatis.\n\nTreasury says the entities sanctioned Wednesday operate as front companies for the benefit of the Iranian firms.\n\n“Iran continues to try to find new ways to procure the key components it needs to bolster its UAV weapons program through new front companies and third-country suppliers,” Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said in a statement.\n\nTrump earlier this month issued a memorandum which calls for the U.S. to “drive Iran’s export of oil to zero.” It also states Iran “can never be allowed to acquire or develop nuclear weapons.”\n\n Not known for political coverage, Wired takes a leading role in tracking Musk’s team \n\nShortly after becoming Wired’s global editorial director in 2023, Katie Drummond acted on an early morning idea. With a presidential election coming, the tech-focused news outlet needed a team to report on technology’s intersection with politics.\n\nShe couldn’t have predicted how much the decision would pay off.\n\nWired has attracted broad attention for its aggressive coverage of the Trump administration, particularly Musk’s efforts at reducing federal employment. It has identified and traced the backgrounds of Musk’s young team and how they are burrowing their way into government operations.\n\n“I think we were very well positioned to jump on that coverage,” Drummond said.\n\n▶ Read more about Wired and Musk\n\n UK prime minister heads to Washington with defense spending pledge to help sway Trump over Ukraine \n\nBritish Prime Minister Keir Starmer’s trip Wednesday comes after announcing a big increase in the British defense budget, an investment he hopes will help persuade Trump to maintain support for Ukraine as Washington pushes to end the war.\n\nThough Starmer is likely to tout the trans-Atlantic “special relationship” that’s endured since World War II, he faces an uncertain reception. Trump has upended decades of U.S. foreign policy during his first weeks in office.\n\nUkraine and its European allies are scrambling to respond after the Trump administration engaged directly with Moscow on ending the war in Ukraine. Starmer’s visit to the White House on Thursday is part of European efforts — following a trip to Washington by French President Emmanuel Macron earlier this week — to ensure Kyiv gets a voice in negotiations, and that the U.S. still backs Europe in dealing with an aggressive Russia on its doorstep.\n\n▶ Read more about British Prime Minister Keir Starmer\n\n The Trump administration announces a plan to combat surging egg prices \n\nAgriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins rolled out the five-part plan Wednesday but acknowledged it could take some time before consumers see an effect at the checkout counter.\n\nThe plan calls for $500 million investment to help farmers bolster biosecurity measures, $400 million in aid for farmers whose flocks have been impacted by avian flu, $100 million to research and potentially develop vaccines and therapeutics for U.S. chicken flocks and explore rolling back what the administration sees as restrictive animal welfare rules in some states.\n\nThe administration is also in talks to import about 70 million to 100 million eggs from other countries in the coming months, Rollins said.\n\nRollins said the administration is anticipating egg prices could still further climb heading toward the Easter holiday, a time when demand has been historically high.\n\n Cabinet picks with hearings Wednesday would have influence over access to reproductive health care \n\nThree of Trump’s Cabinet picks — Dean John Sauer, the nominee for Solicitor General; Harmeet Dhillon, nominee for the Justice Department’s assistant attorney general for civil rights; and Aaron Reitz, nominee for assistant Attorney General for the Justice Department’s legal policy office — face initial hearings Wednesday and, if confirmed, would have influence over reproductive health care access nationwide.\n\nAll three also have long anti-abortion histories.\n\nSauer has been involved in several significant anti-abortion cases, including challenging a St. Louis reproductive equity fund and has argued against the FDA approval of the abortion pill mifepristone.\n\nDhillon has called herself a “lawyer for the pro-life movement” in 2022 and has represented anti-abortion groups. She said last year that laws that protect abortion providers from prosecution for treating out-of-state patients are unconstitutional.\n\nReitz has repeatedly called himself pro-life and said life begins at conception. His legal career has included challenging medication abortion access, and he’s served as a fellow for the anti-abortion coalition Alliance Defending Freedom, which was behind attempts to undo FDA approval of mifepristone.\n\n Musk will attend Trump’s first Cabinet meeting Wednesday \n\nMusk’s attendance highlights his influence over the administration.\n\n“Elon is working with the Cabinet secretaries and their staff every single day to identify waste and fraud and abuse at these respective agencies,” White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters. “All of the Cabinet secretaries take the advice and direction of DOGE.”\n\nLeavitt said members of Trump’s Cabinet would provide updates on their work at the meeting, which is scheduled for 11 a.m. ET.\n\n Emergency fundraisers offer a lifeline to groups who’ve lost foreign aid \n\nThough they know they can never replace all the money lost due to the Trump administration’s freeze on foreign assistance, nonprofits are fundraising to help organizations struggling with the cuts.\n\nUnlock Aid, which advocates for U.S. Agency for International Development reforms, started the Foreign Aid Bridge Fund last week. It will take donations and make grants to groups around the world to try to avert some of the worst impacts of the policy change.\n\nOther groups including Founders Pledge and The Life You Can Save have also launched fundraising campaigns. The Network for Empowered Aid Response, a coalition of civil society organizations from developing countries, has opened a fund, though it’s not accepting donations from individuals. GlobalGiving, a nonprofit that fundraises for grassroots international organizations, was one of the first to launch a campaign to support impacted groups.\n\n▶ Read more about fundraisers for foreign aid\n\n What’s going on with the Kennedy Center under Trump? \n\nUntil a few weeks ago, the biggest news to come out of the Kennedy Center in Washington, D.C., was its annual celebration of notable American artists.\n\nThat has changed since Trump's return\n\nIn the first month of his second term, the president has ousted the arts institution’s leadership, filled the board of trustees with his supporters and announced he had been elected the board’s chair — unanimously. Some artists have responded by canceling appearances.\n\nIn a statement this month to The Wall Street Journal, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said: “The Kennedy Center learned the hard way that if you go woke, you will go broke. Trump and the members of his newly appointed board are devoted to rebuilding the Kennedy Center into a thriving and highly respected institution where all Americans, and visitors from around the world, can enjoy the arts with respect to America’s great history and traditions.”\n\n▶ Read more about the Kennedy Center under Trump’s leadership","summary":"Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Lee Zeldin has privately urged President Donald Trump’s administration to reconsider a scientific finding that has long been the central basis for U.S. action against climate change","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/donald-trump-elon-musk-cabinet-lee-zeldin-doug-collins-b2705500.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/02/26/14/Philanthropy_Foreign_Aid_Freeze_47563.jpg?width=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-02-26 23:48:21","author":"The Associated Press","authors":["The Associated Press"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.258}]}
