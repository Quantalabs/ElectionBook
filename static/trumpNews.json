Trump, in an executive order signed Thursday, directed Attorney General Pam Bondi to investigate allegations that Republicans have raised that ActBlue allows illegal campaign donations. Also Read | Pahalgam Terror Attack: Indus Waters Treaty Kept at Abeyance, India Informs Pakistan. Democrats, who had anticipated they would be targeted, condemned the move Thursday and ActBlue called it an “oppressive use of power” by the White House. “The Trump Administration's and GOP's targeting of ActBlue is part of their brazen attack on democracy in America. Today's escalation by the White House is blatantly unlawful and needs to be seen for what it is: Donald Trump's latest front in his campaign to stamp out all political, electoral and ideological opposition,\" ActBlue said in a statement.

ActBlue said it would pursue “all legal avenues to protect and defend itself.” \"ActBlue will continue its mission and work undeterred and uninterrupted, providing a safe, secure fundraising platform for the millions of grassroots donors who rely on us.” Trump's order directs Bondi, in consultation with the Treasury Department, to investigate allegations that online fundraising platforms, and specifically ActBlue, have been used by some to “make straw' or dummy' contributions or foreign contributions to political candidates and committees.” The findings of the investigation will be reported back with 180 days, according to the order. Since taking office, Trump has sought to use the powers of the government to retaliate against his opponents, including ordering security clearances to be stripped and punishing law firms linked to prosecutors who have investigated him or who have ties to his adversaries. ActBlue, which Democratic campaigns have used for two decades, had helped power an outpouring of small-dollar donations to candidates and causes. It was so successful that Republicans eventually created a counterpart, WinRed — which Trump did not target in the order. Republican National Committee Chair Michael Whatley applauded the investigation, saying in a statement, “The Democrats' Dark Money scam has gone on long enough.\" Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee Chair Suzan DelBene, Democratic National Committee Chair Ken Martin, Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee Chair Kirsten Gillibrand and Democratic Governors Association Chair Laura Kelly denounced the executive order in a joint statement. “Donald Trump's memorandum targeting ActBlue is designed to undermine democratic participation — and it's no wonder why,” the statement said. “He knows Americans are already fed up with his chaotic agenda that is driving the economy off a cliff, so he's trying to block lawful grassroots donations from supporters giving just USD 5 or USD 10 to candidates who oppose him while further empowering the corrupt billionaires who already control his administration.” (AP) (This is an unedited and auto-generated story from Syndicated News feed, LatestLY Staff may not have modified or edited the content body)","summary":"Get latest articles and stories on World at LatestLY.

potential UK-US trade deal when she sits down with Treasury secretary Scott Bessent after a series of talks with other finance ministers at the International Monetary Fund’s spring meetings earlier this week.\n\nThe Government hopes that a deal with the US will mitigate the impact of the tariffs imposed by President Donald Trump at the start of April that rocked financial markets and sparked fears of a global downturn.\n\nMr Trump’s announcement saw Britain hit with 10% tariffs on all exports to the US, as well as a 25% levy on cars, steel and aluminium.\n\nThe Chancellor told the BBC she “understands what president Trump wants to address” when speaking about tariffs.\n\n“We’re all grappling with this issue of tariffs but I think that there is an understanding why president Trump wants to address some of the global imbalances there are in the system,” she told the broadcaster.\n\nMs Reeves has said there is “a deal to be done” with Washington, despite suggestions from senior US officials that Mr Trump regards the 10% tariff as a “baseline” he is unlikely to go below.\n\nBut she has also ruled out several concessions the US is thought to be looking for as the price of a deal.\n\nThese include reductions in food standards rules that limit imports of American agricultural goods and changes to online safety legislation that some US politicians believe limit freedom of speech.\n\nA deal could, however, involve a reduction in tariffs on US cars in exchange for a cut in tariffs on British-made vehicles, with Ms Reeves declining to rule out such a move on Wednesday.\n\nSo far, the Chancellor has used her visit to the IMF to champion free trade, telling a panel event on Thursday evening she wanted to see both tariff and non-tariff barriers reduced.\n\nBut she added that developed economies could not afford to be “agnostic or naive” about where goods were produced at a time when “resilience and security matter more than they have done for a long time”.\n\nAt the same event, IMF managing director Kristalina Georgieva praised the Chancellor’s efforts to “lift up growth in the UK”.\n\nMs Georgieva said: “She is tackling very tough issues, getting reprioritisation of spending, getting the regulatory environment to be more rational and then taking on the battle to get it done, and it’s really impressive.”\n\nMs Reeves told the BBC that conversations at G20 meetings this week had been difficult.\n\n“Obviously there are strains,” she said.\n\n“We are all following what’s happening in our domestic bond markets, in our equity markets, and we all know that that uncertainty is bad for investment in the UK economy.”","summary":"Rachel Reeves will conclude her trip to the IMF’s spring meetings with talks on a potential US-UK

action against it.\n\nTrump’s memorandum directs Attorney General Pam Bondi to “investigate allegations regarding the unlawful use of online fundraising platforms to make 'straw' or 'dummy' contributions or foreign contributions to political candidates and committees, and to take appropriate action to enforce the law.”\n\nDonors have given more than $400 million to Democratic candidates through ActBlue over the first three months of the year, according to the Associated Press.\n\nThe memorandum names ActBlue as an online fundraising platform that is used \"to improperly influence American elections.\"\n\nAn ActBlue spokesperson branded the move by the White House as a \"brazen attack on democracy in America.\"\n\n\"Today’s escalation by the White House is blatantly unlawful and needs to be seen for what it is: Donald Trump’s latest front in his campaign to stamp out all political, electoral and ideological opposition,” the group stated.\n\n“This Administration continues

Americans to participate in our democracy and ActBlue will continue its mission undeterred and uninterrupted, providing a safe, secure fundraising platform for the millions of grassroots donors who rely on us,” the group said in a statement.\n\nActBlue has faced accusations and criticism from Republicans and prominent MAGA figures over how it verifies donations. Elon Musk last month blamed ActBlue without evidence for orchestrating and funding the Tesla protests that have ignited across the U.S. He named ActBlue “funders,” including liberal philanthropist George Soros and billionaire foe Reid Hoffman.\n\n“Something stinks about ActBlue,” Musk also said in a post on X in March as other GOP lawmakers piled on.\n\nCharlie Kirk, a key Trump ally who founded the conservative group Turning Point USA, called for the FBI to investigate ActBlue.\n\n“I think the FBI’s going to do something on ActBlue soon,” Kirk said at a political event last month in Wisconsin.\n\nCalifornia Republican Rep. Darrell Issa also asked the Treasury to investigate allegations that the group processed payments to “terror-linked organizations,” the Associated Press reported.\n\nSeparately, fellow Republican Rep. Andy Biggs of Arizona sent a letter to the FBI last month claiming that ActBlue is being used to “to skirt the integrity of federal campaign finance laws” by allowing foreign nationals to contribute to campaigns, among other allegations of criminal wrongdoing, the agency reported.\n\nActBlue’s spokesperson Megan Hughes dismissed the claims. “ActBlue has always dealt with attacks and baseless claims from the Right that are designed to undermine the power of the small-dollar donors who rely on our platform,” Hughes said in a statement at the time.\n\nLast year Rep. Bryan Steil of Wisconsin, a Republican who oversees the House Administration Committee, wrote to ActBlue in October demanding it hand over documents about how it verifies donors in light of ‘potential vulnerabilities that foreign actors may exploit to illegally participate in the U.S. political process.’”\n\nActBlue complied and Steil later acknowledged the company had “implemented updated policies to ‘automatically reject donations that use foreign prepaid/gift cards, domestic gift cards, are from high-risk/sanctioned countries and have the highest level of risk as determined,’” Politico noted.","url":"https://uk.news.yahoo.com/trump-targets-popular-democrat-fundraising-162323478.html","image":"https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_independent_577/21ca4edb3ee8c512442a318fae46f10e","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-25 00:37:53","author":"Rhian Lubin","authors":["Rhian Lubin"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.222},{"id":314546118,"title":"What Canadians really care about (beyond Trump)","text":"The Canadian general election is fast approaching, and while the US-Canada relationship - and President Donald Trump - have overshadowed the short campaign, Canadians also have other concerns. \n\nFrom the cost of living and healthcare to Indigenous rights and climate change - the BBC travelled across the country to learn what really matters to voters.\n\nVideo by Eloise Alanna","url":"https://www.bbc.com/news/videos/c8x8ylnjr77o","image":"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/37da/live/740eefd0-1fab-11f0-9c65-a5c3dc449bf3.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-25 00:36:03","author":"Eloise Alanna","authors":["Eloise Alanna"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":0.287},{"id":314547366,"title":"Court Prohibits President Trump from Withholding Federal Funds from Sanctuary Cities with Limited Immigration Cooperation","text":"SAN FRANCISCO — A federal judge in California barred the Trump administration from denying or conditioning the use of federal funds to “sanctuary” jurisdictions on Thursday, saying that portions of President Donald Trump’s executive orders were unconstitutional.\n\nU.S. District Judge William Orrick issued the injunction sought by San Francisco and more than a dozen other municipalities that limit cooperation with federal immigration efforts.\n\nOrrick wrote that defendants are prohibited “from directly or indirectly taking any action to withhold, freeze, or condition federal funds,” and the administration must provide written notice of his order to all federal departments and agencies by Monday.\n\nOne executive order issued by Trump directs Attorney General Pam Bondi and Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem to withhold federal money from sanctuary jurisdictions. The second order directs every federal agency to ensure that payments to state and local governments do not “abet so-called ‘sanctuary’ policies that seek to shield illegal aliens from deportation.”\n\nAt a hearing Wednesday, Justice Department lawyers argued that it was much too early for the judge to grant an injunction when the government had not taken any action to withhold specific amounts or to lay out conditions on specific grants.\n\nBut Orrick, who was nominated by President Barack Obama, said this was essentially what government lawyers argued during Trump’s first term when the Republican issued a similar order.\n\n“Their well-founded fear of enforcement is even stronger than it was in 2017,” Orrick wrote, citing the executive orders as well as directives from Bondi, other federal agencies and Justice Department lawsuits filed against Chicago and New York.\n\nSan Francisco successfully challenged the 2017 Trump order, and the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals agreed with the lower court that the president exceeded his authority when he signed an executive order threatening to cut funding for “sanctuary cities.”\n\nPlaintiffs were pleased with the judge’s order.\n\n“At a time when we continue to see tremendous federal overreach, the Court’s ruling affirms that local governments can serve their mission and maintain trust with the communities they care for,” said Tony LoPresti, counsel for Santa Clara County, in a statement.\n\nIt’s unclear if federal agencies will abide by the order. On Thursday, U.S. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy issued a reminder to recipients of federal transportation funding that they are expected to follow federal law, including on immigration enforcement, or face potential consequences.\n\nThe department did not immediately respond to an email seeking comment.\n\nThere is no strict definition for sanctuary policies or sanctuary cities, but the terms generally describe limited cooperation with Immigration and Customs Enforcement.

In a new interview with Piers Morgan, Maher slammed the comedian’s essay, which he said compared his recent meeting with Trump to a meeting with Hitler, calling the scorching take “insulting to six million dead Jews.”\n\n “To use the Hitler thing — first of all, it’s kind of insulting to six million dead Jews,” Maher told Morgan on his podcast. “It’s an argument you kind of lost just to start it. Look, maybe it’s not completely logically fair, but Hitler has really kind of got to stay in his own place.”\n\n Maher added: “He is the GOAT of evil. We’re just going to have to leave it like that.”\n\n In his New York Times essay, David spoke about a fake meeting with Hitler saying that it “seemed so human” and a “completely different animal” than what we know of him. “‘I must say, mein Führer, I’m so thankful I came. Although we disagree on many issues, it doesn’t mean that we have to hate each other,'” David imagined himself telling Hitler. “And with that, I gave him a Nazi salute and walked out into the night.”\n\n At the time, a New York Times editor clarified that the piece was “not equating Trump with Hitler” but more about “seeing people for who they really are.” Speaking to Morgan, Maher said the essay was not “my favorite moment of our friendship.”\n\n “The minute you play the ‘Hitler’ card, you’ve lost the argument,” Maher said. “Hitler, Nazis — nobody has been harder, and more prescient I must say, about Donald Trump than me. I don’t need to be lectured on who Donald Trump is. Just the fact that I met him in person didn’t change that. The fact that I reported honestly is not a sin either.”\n\n Maher joked that he and David “might be friends again” and that he can “take it when people disagree with me.”\n\n “That’s not exactly the way I would’ve done it,” he said. “Again, the irony: let’s go back to what my original thing was. There’s got to be a better way than hurling insults and not talking to people. If I can talk to Trump, I can talk to Larry David too.”\n\n Maher revealed last week that he had met with Trump, a man he has long criticized, during an episode of his late night show, Real Time. “Everything I’ve ever not liked about him was — I swear to God — absent, at least on this night with this guy,” Maher said of his Trump meeting.","summary":"“I don’t need to be lectured on who Donald Trump is,” Maher said","url":"https://www.rollingstone.com/tv-movies/tv-movie-news/bill-maher-larry-david-trump-dinner-essay-hitler-1235324732/","image":"https://www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/bill-maher-larry-david.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-25 00:33:12","author":"Tomás Mier","authors":["Tomás Mier"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.047},{"id":314547290,"title":"Ex-Packers Clay Matthews trolls Bears with fake Donald Trump quote to kick off NFL Draft","text":"The 2025 NFL Draft is underway as teams around the league make picks to acquire potential future superstars for their teams.

Zelensky, who cut short a trip to South Africa to respond to the latest attack, said Russia used a North Korean ballistic missile in the strike, which killed at least 12 people and wounded 90 more.“I am not happy with the Russian strikes,” Trump said on social media. “Not necessary, and very bad timing. Vladimir, STOP!”Trump, who has often drawn criticism for his perceived leniency toward Moscow and hostility toward Zelensky, is pushing for a ceasefire deal. His remarks came shortly after Zelensky questioned whether Western countries were doing enough to curb Russian aggression.“I don't see any strong pressure on Russia or any new sanctions packages against Russia's aggression,” Zelensky said during a press conference in South Africa.Zelensky also reiterated that Ukraine is only able to act within the limits of its Constitution, responding to Trump’s recent criticisms over Kyiv's refusal to recognize Russia’s annexation of Crimea.“We do everything that our partners have proposed, only what contradicts our legislation and the Constitution we cannot do,” he said.Russia annexed the Black Sea peninsula of Crimea in 2014 and launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, initially aiming for a quick victory. Instead, it has been mired in a bloody conflict with massive casualties on both sides.Despite repeated U.S.-led efforts to broker a ceasefire, the conflict has intensified in recent weeks. The latest wave of Russian airstrikes — including over 70 missiles and 145 drones — targeted several Ukrainian cities, with Kyiv bearing the brunt of the damage.\"As of 5:30 p.m., the death toll in Kyiv's Sviatoshinsky district has risen to 12,\" Ukraine's state emergency services said Thursday.An AFP journalist on the ground saw rescue crews retrieving victims from the rubble in western Kyiv. “People were being pulled out of the rubble,” said Olena Davydiuk, a 33-year-old lawyer. “I saw windows breaking and doors falling out of their hinges.”Russia claimed the strikes targeted defense industry sites, including facilities producing “rocket fuel and gunpowder.”Meanwhile, Trump’s envoy, Steve Witkoff, is scheduled to travel to Russia this week for another round of negotiations with Putin on a possible ceasefire agreement. However, prospects remain uncertain amid renewed violence and competing narratives on territorial concessions, particularly regarding Crimea.On Wednesday, Trump accused Zelensky of hampering peace talks by refusing to acknowledge Russia’s claims over the peninsula.“Stopping the war, stopping taking the whole country -- pretty big concession,” Trump told reporters when asked what Moscow had offered during negotiations.The renewed violence and Trump’s latest remarks highlight the fragile and complex nature of international efforts to end the nearly three-year war, even as Western leaders face increasing pressure to take firmer action against Moscow.","summary":"","url":"https://tribune.net.ph/2025/04/25/trump-calls-on-putin-to-halt-ukraine-strikes-after-deadly-attack-on-kyiv","image":"https://media.assettype.com/tribune/2024-11-11/v2ug87vj/00036LX2C9.jpg?w=1200&h=675&auto=format%2Ccompress&fit=max&enlarge=true","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-25 00:27:36","author":"Agence France-Presse","authors":["Agence France-Presse"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"ph","sentiment":-0.377},{"id":314548656,"title":"Serbian president hopes to bring together leaders of Russia, US, France, Germany, Italy","text":"BELGRADE, April 25. /TASS/.

The office confirmed it hired Lowell, who has represented high-profile political figures on both sides of the aisle, including Hunter Biden, Jared Kushner, Ivanka Trump, former Sen. Bob Mendez and Bill Clinton. It is unclear whether taxpayer dollars are going towards James' defense, as the attorney general's office stopped answering questions once Fox News Digital began asking about how Lowell would be compensated. Lowell will represent James as a private citizen, not as part of Winston & Strawn LLP, where he is a partner. HUNTER BIDEN HIRES ALEX MURDAUGH'S LAWYER IN LATEST COURT CASE; ABBE LOWELL OUT U.S. Federal Housing Director William Pulte is requesting the Department of Justice investigate James and consider prosecuting her for allegedly falsifying bank documents and records in order to garner more favorable loans. Lowell, who hung up on Fox News Digital when reached by phone, sent a letter to the DOJ Thursday urging them to reject Pulte's request for prosecution. Local reporting from the Times Union said the attorney general's office indicated the decision to hire Lowell to defend James was, in part, based on their allegation that the Trump administration is pushing a politically motivated criminal referral in response to James bringing a civil case against Donald Trump last year for allegedly inflating asset values to obtain favorable loans. Lowell, in his letter to the DOJ that was directed to U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi, referred to Pulte's criminal referral as \"the latest act of improper political retribution\" from Trump. NEW YORK ATTORNEY GENERAL CLAIMS DOJ'S MORTGAGE FRAUD ACCUSATIONS ARE ‘BASELESS’ \"The stunning hypocrisy of President Trump’s complaint that the Justice Department had been ‘politicized’ and ‘weaponized’ against him is laid bare as he and others in his administration are now asking you to undertake the very same practice,\" Mr. Lowell wrote. In his letter, Lowell points to instances where Trump has called for revenge, and instances where the president has personally attacked James. Lowell also went after the allegations, including that James listed a home in Virginia as her primary residence while serving as a state official in New York. According to Lowell, James had no intention of using the property as a primary residence and her indication of this in a power-of-attorney letter was a mistake. Lowell pointed out there were other documents where James indicated to her lender that the Virginia home would not be her primary residence.

Tens of thousands went there on Thursday to mourn the victims of World War I-era mass murders of ethnic Armenians by the Ottoman Empire.\n\nBut this time, the annual Genocide Remembrance Day was marked not only with grief, but also with some discontent that the Armenian government has stopped vociferously pushing for countries to recognise the massacres as a genocide, amid progress in relations with Azerbaijan and Turkey.\n\nAccording to Yerevan, up to 1.5 million people died between 1915 and 1916, when the Ottoman authorities, struggling on the battlefield, carried out repressions against the Christian Armenian minority, whom it viewed as pro-Russian traitors.\n\nThey were either killed or sent on deadly marches into the Syrian desert, deprived of food and water.\n\nTurkey does not recognise this as genocide and denies the murders were systemic. It estimates Armenian deaths at 300,000-500,000 and claims that as many Turks died in civil strife after many Armenians sided with invading Russian forces.\n\nArmenia and its influential global diaspora have long advocated for international recognition and to date, 34 countries, including the United States, France, Germany, Brazil, and Russia, have officially recognised the killings as genocide.\n\nUS President Donald Trump on Thursday, however, stopped short of using the term \"genocide\", saying instead that the American people \"honor the memories of those wonderful souls who suffered in one of the worst disasters of the 20th century.\"\n\n- Strained relations -\n\n\"What our government is even thinking?\" said 72-year-old Aram Hayrapetyan, as he slowly climbed the hill up to the memorial in a solemn procession.\n\n\"How can we trust Turkey, which openly supported Azerbaijan during the Karabakh war and still refuses to recognise the genocide?\"\n\nRelations between Ankara and Yerevan have been strained for decades over the massacres, which Armenia calls a genocide, and the Karabakh conflict, but Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan has recently been pushing for a reset. \n\n\"We must not abandon the fight for international recognition -- for justice, and to ensure such a thing never happens again,\" added Hayrapetyan, who used to come to Tsitsernakaberd every year along with his wife, who recently died.\n\n\"She's gone, so I'm here for two today, and I'll keep coming as long as I have strength in my legs,\" he told AFP.\n\nThis year, the unusual absence of any major official events in Yerevan on Genocide Remembrance Day left many disheartened, especially after Pashinyan recently told Turkish media that seeking genocide recognition was no longer a priority for Armenia.\n\n\"We must be strong to make sure their blood wasn't spilled in vain and to keep the memory of them,\" said Mher Madoyan, a 76-year-old economist with powder-white thick hair.\n\n- Fragile rapprochement -\n\nOver the past four decades, Armenia and its neighbour, Turkic-speaking majority-Muslim Azerbaijan, backed by Ankara, fought two wars over the mountainous region of Karabakh amid a power vacuum left by the Soviet Union's collapse.\n\nKarabakh was internationally recognised as part of Azerbaijan but was predominantly populated by Armenians.\n\nIn a swift offensive in September 2023, Baku regained full control of the region, prompting the exodus of more than 100,000 ethnic Armenians.\n\nLast month, the two former Soviet republics agreed on the text of a long-anticipated peace treaty aimed at ending decades of hostilities, which could also pave the way for normalisation between Armenia and Turkey, which currently have no diplomatic relations.\n\nBut some remain sceptical.\n\n\"Of course, it would be nice to sign a peace agreement between Armenia and Azerbaijan, but I don't trust it,\" said Marine Balayan, a 65-year-old woman who laid flowers at the memorial.\n\n\"I am dubious, even after they sign it, that they won't go against our country again,\" she said.\n\nAram Petrosyan, a 46-year-old lawyer, told AFP: \"Every day, the Azerbaijanis put more and more humiliating demands on the table. Therefore, I don't think it is realistic to sign a peace agreement now.\"\n\nOn Wednesday night, an Azerbaijani and a Turkish flag were burned as thousands sang patriotic songs accompanied by drumbeats in central Yerevan at a traditional torchlight procession on the eve of the Remembrance Day.\n\nThe burning of the flags was later denounced by the prime minister's office.\n\n\"This is the fire of the souls of the one and a half million Armenians who died in the genocidal hell,\" said Gegham Manukyan, a lawmaker from nationalist party Dashnaktsutyun.\n\nstr-im-asy/am/giv/jgc/rjm","url":"https://uk.news.yahoo.com/grief-discontent-armenia-marks-wwi-180124026.html","image":"https://media.zenfs.com/en/afp.co.uk/8916dabd5f48ecae35215a432ee42578","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-25 00:16:59","author":"Mariam Harutyunyan","authors":["Mariam Harutyunyan"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.465},{"id":314545886,"title":"Rattled Hegseth Is Screaming at Staffers About Polygraph Tests","text":"A flailing Pete Hegseth has taken to threatening colleagues with polygraph tests in an effort to get to the bottom of leaks from his department. \n\nAnd he isn’t being particularly polite about it, either.\n\n“I’ll hook you up to a f---ing polygraph!” Hegseth yelled at Adm.

Large swathes of the deep-sea floor contain nodules of the critical minerals cobalt, copper, manganese and nickel.\"This is an exciting opportunity for the U.S.,\" Gerard Baron, CEO of The Metals Company, told Newsweek. \"It's an amazing way of catching up from what is a very distant second place to China when it comes to critical minerals.\"The Canada-based company is seeking U.S. permits to mine the sea floor after expressing frustration with an international process on mining. A United Nations body, the International Seabed Authority, has been debating a set of standards for deep-sea mining intended to minimize harm to marine environments.Brazilian oceanographer Leticia Carvalho has been Secretary General of the Seabed Authority since January. At a Washington D.C. conference on critical minerals this month, Carvalho emphasized that her organization is the only body legally authorized to regulate activity beyond national boundaries and that there was clear agreement among partner nations.\"No exploitation may commence until a regulatory framework is in place,\" she said.Baron said his company has spent millions of dollars on environmental assessments of their mining but has not seen progress on mining standards from the Seabed Authority.\"The system has been overtaken by environmental activists,\" Baron complained.The U.S. has never ratified the U.N. Convention on the Law of the Sea, and legislation from the 1990s established a national permitting framework for seabed mining.Trump's order calls on U.S. agencies to expedite seabed mineral permits \"in areas beyond national jurisdiction,\" essentially ignoring the international process and mining unilaterally.The order drew immediate condemnation from ocean conservation groups who say deep sea mining risks a fragile and barely explored environment.\"Areas of the U.S. seafloor where test mining took place over 50 years ago still haven't fully recovered,\" Jeff Watters, Ocean Conservancy's vice president for external affairs, said in a statement. \"The harm caused by deep-sea mining isn't restricted to the ocean floor: it will impact the entire water column, top to bottom, and everyone and everything relying on it.\"Duncan Currie, international legal advisor to the Deep Sea Conservation Coalition, which represents more than 100 groups, warned that unilaterally mining in international waters would risk upsetting other fragile agreements on shipping and fishing on the high seas.\"To be taking a bulldozer through the Law of the Sea Convention would really be treated with enormous alarm by any country that has a need to rely on the ocean,\" Currie told Newsweek.Currie also questioned the economic rationale for seafloor mining.\"It's a very shallow analysis of the issue,\" he said. The main bottleneck to critical mineral supplies, he said, is the lack of a refining and processing infrastructure for the minerals, and pulling rocks from the depths will not change that.Victor Vescovo, CEO of the investment company Caledon Capital, is a deep ocean explorer and one of the very few people to have visited the Challenger Deep, the deepest spot on Earth. Vescovo said he has deep doubts about the mining companies' claims about their ability to operate profitably under such difficult conditions.\"I've operated heavy equipment below 4000 meters as much as anyone, and they are completely underestimating the absolute hellish and brutal nature of operating at those depths,\" Vescovo told Newsweek. \"It's deeper than the Titanic. Nothing could be harder, except maybe going into space.\"Minerals extracted from the seabed would not make a significant difference in the global supply, he argued, and many of the crucial rare earth minerals in shortest supply are not found in the deep-sea nodules.\"They treat deep sea mining as a cornucopia of critical metals, like it's the solution to all of our metals problems,\" he said. \"It is nothing of the kind.\"Vescovo said deep sea expeditions frequently find previously unknown species, many with unique biochemistry and other properties that could yield important scientific and medical breakthroughs.Mining not only produces deep scars on the sea floor and a plume of sediment in the water column, he said, it also removes the hard substrate that many organisms need as an anchor on the abyssal plain.Baron, of The Metals Company, countered that damage from mining the sea floor must be balanced against the impacts of terrestrial mining. New mining and processing of nickel, for example, is now largely taking place in Indonesian rainforests, where it has become a leading cause of deforestation.\"We should carry out extractive industry in parts of the planet where there is the least life,\" Baron said, \"not the most life.\"","summary":"The order seeks swift permits for mining nickel, cobalt and other minerals from the sea floor.

The second order directs every federal agency to ensure that payments to state and local governments do not \"abet so-called 'sanctuary' policies that seek to shield illegal aliens from deportation.\"\n\nAt a hearing Wednesday, Justice Department lawyers argued that it was much too early for the judge to grant an injunction when the government had not taken any action to withhold specific amounts or to lay out conditions on specific grants.\n\nBut Orrick, who was nominated by President Barack Obama, said this was essentially what government lawyers argued during Trump's first term when the Republican issued a similar order.\n\n\"Their well-founded fear of enforcement is even stronger than it was in 2017,\" Orrick wrote, citing the executive orders as well as directives from Bondi, other federal agencies and Justice Department lawsuits filed against Chicago and New York.\n\nSan Francisco successfully challenged the 2017 Trump order, and the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals agreed with the lower court that the president exceeded his authority when he signed an executive order threatening to cut funding for \"sanctuary cities.\"\n\nPlaintiffs were pleased with the judge's order.\n\n\"At a time when we continue to see tremendous federal overreach, the Court's ruling affirms that local governments can serve their mission and maintain trust with the communities they care for,\" said Tony LoPresti, counsel for Santa Clara County, in a statement.\n\nIt's unclear if federal agencies will abide by the order.

Lateefah Simon aired concerns about how they could weather the administration’s erratic moves — implementing tariffs, cutting tariffs, delaying tariffs, raising tariffs.\n\nSimon, a civil rights advocate who has represented California’s 12th congressional district since January, offered a blistering rebuke of President Donald Trump’s trade policies on key allies, saying he has created a “no-win situation” for the U.S. and global economy, which threatens to have devastating effects on the region’s job market, housing development and health care services. Already, shipments of equipment to UCSF Benioff Children’s Hospital in Oakland have been delayed, according to Adam Masters, a business representative from SMART, SMW Local Union No. 104.\n\n“There’s a real potentiality of workers losing their jobs, but we cannot have a poorer, sicker California,” Simon said, comparing her district’s largest city to a patient in a hospital. “If there were no tariffs, Oakland would be in the emergency room. Hospice is terminal, but we’re in ICU. We have to convince businesses to stay here.”\n\nThe Port of Oakland handles 99% of all shipments into Northern California. The most important of these trading partners is China, which represents 48% of all imports and 7% of all exports at the port.\n\nChina currently faces a 145% tariff on U.S. imports as a trade war between the world’s two largest economies has escalated over the past two months. Trump asserted this past week that the two countries were in active negotiations to create a new trade deal. Chinese officials, however, have repudiated the president’s claims about negotiations and called for an end to unilateral tariffs.\n\nThe port’s two largest receivers of goods, Japan and South Korea, were among the first countries to enter discussions with Trump to lower tariffs. Japan is responsible for 15% of all exports from the Port of Oakland, while South Korea adds an additional 11% of exports. Japan faces a 24% tariff on its goods while South Korea faces a 25% tariff.\n\nPrior to Thursday’s meeting, the Port of Oakland announced a 6.3% year-over-year increase in container volume, representing a total of imports and exports, buoyed in the first quarter of 2025 as businesses rushed to push through goods before further tariffs were enacted. The port reported a 7.2% rise in shipping volume in March compared to the same time period last year. But the increased trade is expected to be short-lived as port officials estimate a 10% contraction in trade volume for the rest of the year.\n\nPort of Oakland Executive Director Kristi McKenney said that without clear answers about the desired outcomes of Trump’s economic policies, many are left in limbo about the best move forward.\n\n“What we don’t want is chaos. We want clarity around where we’re going,” McKenney said. “It’s terribly important that, as we move forward, we have an understanding so that these tariffs don’t have all those negative impacts and can be used for an ultimate common good outcome.”\n\nIn recent months, the whipsaw of tariffs has challenged Bay Area business owners who rely on stable costs and international trade. Stephanie Tran, president of Oakland’s Chinatown Chamber of Commerce, who also runs her own small business, Town Print Shop, said tariffs are a looming threat to many companies still recovering from the pandemic.\n\n“Our small mom-and-pop businesses are going to be forced to either absorb those costs, increase prices or even pull goods off the shelf,” Tran said. “It’s really, really important at this time for the community to continue to support small businesses, because small businesses are the heart of our community.”\n\nPort of Oakland Maritime Director Bryan Brandes said he was “encouraged” about the rise in cargo volume in the first quarter of 2025, but said the port would continue to monitor international trade relations while it focuses on its facilities and community partners.\n\n“We’re mindful of evolving trade policy discussions and potential tariff actions that will affect the broader market,” Brandes said in a statement. “We remain committed to providing reliable service, maintaining strong infrastructure, and working closely with our partners to navigate whatever lies ahead.”","summary":"The Port of Oakland, a vital bridge between the U.S. and its largest trading partners, especially China, faces a rapidly changing landscape of tariffs and stiff winds from an unpredictable Trump administration.

But he wasn’t happy about everything in the article, Carter told MSNBC’s Joe Scarborough Thursday. \n\n“There were a few things he didn’t like about it, including the fact that I said it looked like his hands were too small for his body,” Carter said. “He didn’t like it at all — he liked the cover, but he didn’t like anything else.”\n\nSo he “has his staff buy up every copy they could find in the newsstands in New York,” Carter added.\n\nCarter’s profile offered several details about Trump’s appearance: “6-foot-2-inch frame, is trim but well-nourished. The hands small and neatly groomed. The suit is blue and stylish – maybe a little too flared in the leg for someone who lives east of the Hudson,” he wrote.\n\n“About the only thing that gives away this striver from an outer borough are his cufflinks: huge mollusks of gold and stone the size of half-dollars,” the profile continues.\n\nThe detail about Trump’s hands didn’t go unnoticed. Secretary of State Marco Rubio used the detail to hit at Trump when he ran against him in the 2016 Republican primary: “You know what they say about guys with small hands – you can’t trust ‘em.”\n\nThat’s not all people say about guys with small hands.\n\nCarter explained that his profile triggered something of a butterfly effect.\n\nGQ’s owner “thought this guy is a star… because the sales of that issue of GQ were so strong,” Carter explained. “So he ordered up a book, which became The Art of the Deal.”\n\nThe Art of the Deal, released in 1987, was Trump’s first book. The business advice book, written with journalist Tony Schwartz, helped Trump’s popularity skyrocket.\n\nSchwartz, now a dedicated Trump critic, called ghost-writing the book his \"greatest regret in life, without question,” and said the book about Trump’s skill at making deals should be called fiction. Both Schwartz and the book's original publisher, Howard Kaminsky, have said that Trump wrote nothing in the book. He didn’t write as much as a “postcard for us,” according to Kaminsky.\n\nCarter told Scarborough he moved out of the country for most of the Republican president’s first term. Carter, once a friend of Trump’s, has since become a staunch critic of his over the last ten years.\n\n“Having that ocean as a sort of buffer is like having a mattress when you're in a gangland gunfight war,” Carter said. “This is the darkest time I think since the 1950s,” he added.","summary":"The journalist wrote that Trump had ‘hands small and neatly groomed’ in his 1984 profile","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/trump-graydon-carter-small-hands-profile-b2739111.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/04/24/20/55/Screenshot-2025-04-24-at-4-37-38-PM.png?trim=0,50,0,48&width=1200&height=800&crop=1200:800","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/r7f5oUcP-4VHSaSK0.mp4","publish_date":"2025-04-24 23:52:51","author":"Katie Hawkinson","authors":["Katie Hawkinson"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.195},{"id":314545576,"title":"Alphabet expects 'slight headwind' to ads business this year, executives say","text":"President Donald Trump's trade policies will have a negative impact on Google parent Alphabet's core advertising business, an executive from the company said Thursday.\n\nAlphabet, which reported stronger-than-expected revenue in its first quarter of the year, faces an online ads market that's on edge due to concerns about how Trump's tariffs will affect the economy and business spending. While the word \"tariff\" was never mentioned on Alphabet's investor call Thursday, \"macro\" was mentioned several times as investors peppered company executives with questions about forward looking economic impacts amid new trade policies.\n\nSeveral strategists increased their odds of a recession after Trump on April 2 announced tariffs for imports of goods into the U.S. from dozens of countries. On April 9, Trump lowered tariffs on many countries to 10% for three months.\n\nAlphabet will likely be impacted by materials needed for technical infrastructure like data centers that it uses to power efforts in artificial intelligence. It could also see second-hand effects on advertising pull-back from budget constraints.\n\nIn Thursday's investor call, Alphabet executives said it's too early to tell just how much it will be impacted, but they said that there would likely be headwinds to its advertising business, particularly from the Asia–Pacific region of the world, or APAC.\n\n\"Any other factors you're seeing in advertising verticals or regions or categories that could be showing any signs of weakness?\" asked Brian Nowak of Morgan Stanley.\n\n\"We wouldn't want to speculate about potential impacts beyond noting that the changes to the de minimis exemption will obviously cause a slight headwind to our ads business in 2025, primarily from APAC-based retailers,\" said Philipp Schindler, Google's chief business officer.\n\nEarlier this month, Trump signed an executive order that will impose a duty representing 30% of the value or $25 per item on shipments worth less than $800 that enter the U.S., starting May 2. The duty jumps to $50 per item on June 1. In February, Trump undid a loophole that since the 1930s had allowed such packages to be imported duty-free. The change brought logistical challenges that resulted in a delay of the implementation of the policy.\n\nRetail, which Schindler said was among the top contributors to its advertising growth in the first quarter, represents at least 21% of Google ad revenue, according to estimates by Oppenheimer & Co. Chinese discount e-commerce apps Temu and Shein, which have been big advertisers in the U.S. in recent years, are of notable concern, and Temu has already pulled way back on spending.\n\n\"We're obviously not immune to the macro environment,\" Schindler added.\n\n\"Are they starting to react to some of these macro jitters that were we're all experiencing?\" asked Ross Sandler from Barclays about brands that advertise on YouTube.\n\nSchindler said \"it's still too early in the second quarter to have a more specific view of things.\" He added that Google has \"a lot of experience in managing through uncertain times.\"\n\n\"If macro weakens and we see more of a slowdown, would you expect to find additional opportunities to cut back more on costs?\" asked Doug Anmuth from JPMorgan.\n\nAlphabet CFO Anat Ashkenazi said the company is still looking at spending $75 billion in capital expenditures in 2025 but stipulated \"the investment level may fluctuate from quarter to quarter due to the impact of changes in the timing of deliveries and construction schedules.\" \n\nExpenditures will go toward technical infrastructure, primarily for servers, followed by data centers and networking, executives said in February.\n\nThe company is still focused on \"driving efficiency and productivity throughout the organization,\" Ashkenazi said on Thursday's call, pointing to her 2024 comments, where she said the organization can \"always push a little further\" when it comes to cost cutting, which has included cuts to headcount and real estate.\n\nAlphabet CEO Sundar Pichai also mentioned \"efficiency\" as a means of trying to keep a lean-enough company to weather potential macro storms.\n\n\"If the macro environment were to change and become more downwardly volatile, how should investors think about the investments that are must-make this year, almost fixed in nature, versus where there might be more flexibility?\" asked Eric Sheridan from Goldman Sachs.\n\nPichai responded that the company plans to continue consolidating teams and cutting back on costs elsewhere, which he said \"should help us have a more resilient organization, irrespective of macroeconomic conditions.\"\n\nWATCH: Google earnings: What investors are looking for","summary":"The comments come as Alphabet and other tech companies prepare to pay up due to the Trump administration's trade policies.","url":"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/04/24/alphabet-expects-slight-headwind-to-ads-business-in-2025-execs-say.html","image":"https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/108136403-1745527689388-gettyimages-2200345065-radecka-meetingw250213_nphwC.jpeg?v=1745527752","video":"https://pdl-iphone-cnbc-com.akamaized.net/VCPS/Y2025/M04D24/7000373836/1745510764-39506514797-hd_L.mp4","publish_date":"2025-04-24 23:50:49","author":"Jennifer Elias","authors":["Jennifer Elias"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.304},{"id":314550232,"title":"Proposal for passenger rail to Bangor loses steam in committee","text":"A renewed effort to restore passenger rail service from Portland to Bangor was soundly rejected Thursday by the Legislature’s transportation committee, following a similar failed attempt last year.\n\nThe committee voted 9-1 against LD 487, recommending that it “ought not to pass” when the bill goes before the House and Senate in the coming weeks.\n\nThe bill would direct the Northern New England Passenger Rail Authority (NNEPRA), operator of the Amtrak Downeaster, to apply for at least $500,000 in federal funding to develop a proposal for passenger service between Portland and Orono, just north of Bangor.\n\nThe bill’s opponents, including NNEPRA and the Maine Department of Transportation, say passenger service to Bangor would be too slow, attract too few riders and cost too much to establish and operate. Its supporters dispute all of those points and say the expansion is a practical and necessary investment that would share the environmental and economic benefits of passenger service with more rural parts of Maine.\n\nCommittee members responded to guidance from Maine rail officials, who said that the project likely wouldn’t qualify for federal funding and warned that railroad grants are in jeopardy under President Donald Trump.\n\n“There is a great deal of uncertainty at this time,” said Patricia Quinn, NNEPRA’s executive director.\n\nRep. Lydia Crafts, D-Newcastle, committee co-chair, said pursuing passenger service to Bangor now would be a “distraction” from the state’s current passenger rail goals, which include moving Portland’s train station and adding a train station in West Falmouth.\n\nRep. Karen Montell, D-Gardiner, was the only committee member to support LD 487, saying that it would fund a study to show passenger service is warranted from Portland to Bangor. Several work session participants said the bill wouldn’t fund such a study.\n\nRep. Tavis Hasenfus, D-Readfield, proposed LD 487 after a similar bill, pitched by Sen. Joe Baldacci, D-Bangor, was narrowly defeated last year. The Senate approved LD 860, 23-11, but the House voted it down, 80-64. Baldacci is co-sponsor of the current bill.\n\nRail advocates still hope LD 487 can overcome cost and ridership concerns to win Legislative support, similar to the effort that brought the Downeaster to southern Maine nearly 24 years ago.\n\nThe Maine Rail Group has commissioned a new feasibility study by the national Rail Passengers Association, which members say will show the ridership potential of extending passenger service to Bangor. The study will be completed by mid-May.\n\n“We believe that it will provide valuable information about extending Amtrak passenger service to Orono through Lewiston, Waterville and Bangor,” the group said in an emailed statement. “It should be available to all legislators in time for votes during the current session.”\n\nThe bill would provide $40,000 to prepare an application to the Federal Railroad Administration of the U.S. Department of Transportation.\n\nThe funds would be used to develop a proposal for passenger service from Portland through Auburn, Lewiston, Waterville and Bangor to Orono on the CSX Corp. freight line. Other stations would be added as passenger service developed.\n\nProponents of the new bill say opposition last year was based on recommendations from an advisory group and a “propensity study” that didn’t consider Lewiston when factoring traveler interest. That’s because the previous bill initially considered a different route that passed through Brunswick and would have bypassed Lewiston.\n\nExcluding Maine’s second-largest city was a mistake, expansion supporters say, noting the importance of connecting the state’s three largest municipalities: Portland (population 69,104), Lewiston (38,404) and Bangor (31,628).\n\nBruce White, a former legislator who served on the transportation committee last year, testified in favor of the legislation on March 6.\n\n“This is a new proposal,” White told the committee. “This route has never been studied before. Those supporting this bill are confident that this study will show ridership sufficient to qualify for federal implementation funding.”\n\nSupporters say it’s unfair to deny passenger service to central and northern Maine, especially after investing more than $50 million ($89.7 million today, when adjusted for inflation) to bring the Downeaster from Boston to Portland in December 2001 — and continuing to spend $17 million annually to subsidize the service that now extends to Brunswick.\n\nThey also point out that CSX Transportation, which operates on 481 miles of track and maintains 269 public grade crossings in Maine, has made rail improvements in the last two years allowing freight train speeds to increase to 40 mph, up from 10-25 mph. The improved tracks would allow passenger trains to travel up to 60 mph, according to Federal Railroad Administration standards.\n\nNate Moulton, director of freight operations at Maine Department of Transportation, said a study completed in February 2023 estimated that it would cost $375 million to $538 million in equipment and track improvements to expand passenger service to Bangor, depending on which lines were used.\n\nMoulton also said the current Downeaster service covers about 50% of its costs with passenger fares and requires an annual public subsidy of about $16 million.\n\nHe noted that passenger service to Bangor would parallel interstates 95 and 295, where commuters can travel up to 70 mph in personal vehicles or buses. He referred to an MDOT pilot commuter bus service that started last year between Lewiston-Auburn and Portland.","summary":"The Legislature's transportation committee says LD 487 'ought not to pass,' especially without assured funding from the Trump administration.","url":"https://www.centralmaine.com/2025/04/24/proposal-for-passenger-rail-to-bangor-loses-steam-in-committee/","image":"https://www.centralmaine.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/04/26021511_SJ.CITrailtrail.082021-1-1745539254.jpg?w=1024","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-24 23:50:10","author":"Kelley Bouchard","authors":["Kelley Bouchard"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.287},{"id":314544950,"title":"Aussie sleep apnoea firm Resmed locks in Trump tariff exemption","text":"Australian sleep health giant Resmed has locked down an exemption from Donald Trump’s sweeping trade tariffs.\n\nResmed produces sleep apnoea machines and accompanying technology in Singapore and Australia, and the $49bn company confirmed this week its existing tariff exemption will continue in the US.\n\nResmed was founded in Sydney in 1989, is now based in California, but is listed on both the ASX and Nasdaq.\n\nThe company is the fourth largest healthcare firm on the ASX.

But the legal disputes playing out across the country are far from over, and administration attorneys pushed back, asking the federal appellate courts and the US Supreme Court to overturn some of the unfavourable decisions.

DEI Judges blocked the administration from enforcing its diversity, equity and inclusion crackdown in education in at least two lawsuits Thursday. The decisions came ahead of a Friday deadline that the Education Department set for states to sign a form certifying they would not use “illegal DEI practices.” A federal judge in New Hampshire blocked a series of directives from the Education Department, including a memo ordering an end to any practice that differentiates people based on their race, and another asking for assurances that schools don't use DEI practices deemed discriminatory. Judges in Maryland and Washington, D.C., also halted portions of the department's anti-DEI efforts. Elections A federal judge blocked the Trump administration from immediately enacting certain changes to how federal elections are run, including adding a proof-of-citizenship requirement to the federal voter registration form. Still, the judge allowed other parts of Trump's sweeping executive order on US elections — including a directive to tighten mail ballot deadlines — to go forward for now. US District Judge Colleen Kollar-Kotelly in Washington sided with voting rights groups and Democrats, saying that the Constitution gives the power to regulate federal elections to states and Congress — not the president. She noted federal lawmakers are currently working on their own legislation to require proof of citizenship to vote. Immigration The Trump administration is appealing a judge's order barring it from deporting people from Colorado under a rarely used 1798 law. Attorneys for the administration filed the appeal in the 10th US Circuit Court, arguing that Denver-based US District Judge Charlotte N. Sweeney lacks jurisdiction and that it is legally sound to invoke the Alien Enemies Act against the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua. In another case out of Maryland, the Trump administration was ordered to facilitate the return of a man who was deported to El Salvador last month despite having a pending asylum application. US District Judge Stephanie Gallagher in Maryland said the government violated a 2019 settlement agreement when it deported the 20-year-old man, a Venezuelan native identified only as Cristian in court papers. Gallagher cited another federal judge's order for the government to facilitate the return of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, who had been living in Maryland and was accidentally deported the same day as Cristian. In a Texas lawsuit, a court document from an Immigration and Customs Enforcement official was unsealed, revealing that migrants subject to removal under the Alien Enemies Act are only getting about 12 hours to decide if they want to contest their planned deportation to a prison in El Salvador. Earlier this week, government attorneys in a different Alien Enemies Act lawsuit told a judge in Colorado that migrants were being given 24 hours to make the decision. The American Civil Liberties Union says the time period violates a Supreme Court order that allowed the Trump administration to continue deportations but required the government give detainees a “reasonable time” to argue to a judge that they should not be removed. Yet another federal judge based in San Francisco barred the Trump administration from denying federal funds to “sanctuary” cities that limit immigration cooperation. US Judge William Orrick said the temporary ban is appropriate because the executive orders are unconstitutional, just like they were in 2017 when Trump announced a similar order. Orrick said the administration can't freeze any federal funds in San Francisco and more than a dozen other municipalities until the lawsuit brought by those cities is resolved. Transgender rights The Trump administration asked the Supreme Court on Thursday to allow enforcement of a ban on transgender people in the military, while lawsuits over the ban move forward in court. The high court filing follows a brief order from a federal appeals court that kept in place a court order blocking the policy nationwide. Trump signed an executive order a week into his term that claims the sexual identity of transgender service members “conflicts with a soldier's commitment to an honorable, truthful, and disciplined lifestyle, even in one's personal life” and is harmful to military readiness. In response, Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth issued a policy that presumptively disqualifies transgender people from military service. But in March, US District Court Judge Benjamin Settle in Tacoma, Washington, ruled for several long-serving transgender military members who say the ban is insulting and discriminatory.

BALDOR\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) — Houthi rebels in Yemen have shot down seven U.S. Reaper drones in less than six weeks, a loss of aircraft worth more than $200 million in what is becoming the most dramatic cost to the Pentagon of the military campaign against the Iran-backed militants.\n\nAccording to defense officials, three of the drones were shot down in the past week — suggesting the militants’ targeting of the unmanned aircraft flying over Yemen has improved. The drones were doing attack runs or conducting surveillance, and they crashed both into the water and onto land, said the officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss military operations.\n\nThe U.S. has increased its attacks on the Houthis, launching daily strikes since March 15, when President Donald Trump ordered a new, expanded campaign. He promised to use “overwhelming lethal force” until the Houthis cease their attacks on shipping along a vital maritime corridor. The U.S. has done more than 750 strikes on the Houthis since that new effort began.\n\nAnother defense official said that although hostile fire is likely the cause of the drone losses, the incidents are still under investigation. The official noted that the increase in U.S. strikes can add to the risk to aircraft, but said the U.S. will take every measure possible to protect troops, equipment and interests in the region. The official spoke on condition of anonymity to comment on sensitive military issues.\n\nThe sophisticated drones, built by General Atomics, cost about $30 million each, and generally fly at altitudes of more than 40,000 feet (12,100 meters). Houthis leaders have consistently touted the strikes in public statements. One of the defense officials said the U.S. lost Reaper drones on March 31 and on April 3, 9, 13, 18, 19 and 22.\n\nU.S. senators, meanwhile, are raising concerns about civilian casualties caused by the American strikes in Yemen. Democratic Sens. Chris Van Hollen of Maryland, Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Tim Kaine of Virginia wrote to Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth on Thursday questioning whether the Trump administration is “abandoning the measures necessary to meet its obligations to reducing civilian harm.”\n\nSpecifically, they questioned reports that U.S. strikes at the Ras Isa fuel terminal in Yemen last week potentially killed more than 70 civilians.\n\n“Military leaders agree that ingraining civilian harm mitigation practices within U.S operations leads to better outcomes and that civilian casualties actually undermine the mission that the military has been sent in to do,” their letter said.\n\nIn addition to downing the drones, the Houthis have been persistently firing missiles and one-way attack drones at U.S. military ships in the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden. They haven’t hit any.\n\nThe U.S. has been using an array of warships, fighter jets, bombers and drones to strike the Houthis, and aircraft can now launch from two Navy carriers in the region.\n\nHegseth decided in March to beef up the Navy warship presence in the Middle East, ordering the USS Harry S. Truman to extend its deployment there, as the USS Carl Vinson steamed toward the area.\n\nThe Truman, along with two of the destroyers and a cruiser in its strike group, is now in the Red Sea. And the Vinson, along with two destroyers and a cruiser, is in the Gulf of Aden.\n\nThe third destroyer assigned to the Truman is in the Mediterranean Sea. And two other U.S. Navy destroyers are in the Red Sea, but aren’t part of the Truman’s group.\n\nHegseth is weighing whether to grant a request by U.S. Central Command to once again extend the Truman’s deployment. A decision to do that could keep the Truman and at least some of its strike group in the region for several more weeks.\n\nIt has been rare in recent years for the U.S. to have two aircraft carriers in the Middle East at the same time. Navy leaders have generally been opposed to the idea because it disrupts ship maintenance schedules and delays time at home for sailors strained by the unusually high combat tempo.\n\nLast year, the Biden administration ordered the USS Dwight D. Eisenhower aircraft carrier to remain in the Red Sea for an extended time, as U.S. warships waged the most intense running sea battle since World War II.\n\nPrior to that it had been years since the U.S. had committed that much warship power to the Middle East.\n\nThe Houthis have been waging persistent missile and drone attacks against commercial and military ships in the region in what the group’s leadership has described as an effort to end the Israeli war against Hamas in the Gaza Strip.\n\nFrom November 2023 until this January, the Houthis targeted more than 100 merchant vessels with missiles and drones, sinking two of them and killing four sailors. That has greatly reduced the flow of trade through the Red Sea corridor, which typically sees $1 trillion of goods move through it annually.","summary":"Three of the drones were shot down in the past week.","url":"https://www.ocregister.com/2025/04/24/houthis-shoot-down-drones/","image":"https://www.ocregister.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/APTOPIX_Yemen_Mideast_Wars_51193_2b5c94-1.jpg?w=1024&h=683","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-24 23:42:22","author":"Associated Press","authors":["Associated Press"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.084},{"id":314549940,"title":"GOP talking points 'come from the Kremlin': Ex-security advisor warns of collapse into authoritarianism","text":"An American writer and commentator is warning the Republican Party is collapsing into authoritarianism — and dragging the nation with it.\n\n“There's been this shift in the American right over the last decade.

migrant deported to El Salvador","text":"A federal judge has ordered the administration of President Donald Trump to facilitate the return of a second man sent to a prison in El Salvador back to the United States, saying his deportation violated a court settlement.\n\nLate Wednesday, U.S. District Judge Stephanie Gallagher in Baltimore said the settlement agreement that she approved in November on behalf of thousands of migrants required immigration authorities to process the asylum application by the 20-year-old Venezuelan man, identified only as Cristian, before deporting him.\n\nThe ruling could set up another showdown between the Trump administration and federal courts over immigration enforcement. The administration has also been ordered to facilitate the return of a Salvadoran man, Kilmar Abrego Garcia, who it acknowledged was deported in error, but a judge has said that the government is doing little to comply.\n\nThe administration claims that Abrego Garcia, Cristian and more than 250 other people who were sent to a Salvadoran prison beginning last month are gang members and that it has the power to remove them under the Alien Enemies Act, a wartime law adopted in 1798.\n\nGallagher considered only whether Cristian’s deportation violated the settlement and not whether the law was properly invoked, which is at issue in Abrego Garcia’s and other migrants’ cases. The settlement applies to thousands of migrants who came to the United States unaccompanied as children and have applied for asylum.\n\n“A core purpose of the Settlement Agreement would be nullified if Class Members with pending asylum applications could be summarily removed from the United States and thus rendered ineligible for asylum,” wrote Gallagher, a Trump appointee.\n\nThe White House, the Department of Homeland Security and lawyers who represent the plaintiffs did not immediately respond to requests for comment today.\n\nCristian is a class member in the 2019 lawsuit, which claimed that immigration authorities were deporting migrants before they received a final determination on their applications for asylum.\n\nAsylum is a form of humanitarian protection extended to people who are in the U.S. illegally but would likely face persecution if sent back to their home countries.\n\nThe Trump administration argued that deporting Cristian did not violate the settlement agreement because he had been deemed an “alien enemy” under the wartime law, making him ineligible for asylum.\n\nGallagher on Wednesday said the settlement applies to anyone with a pending asylum application, and not only those who are eligible for asylum.\n\nThe judge ordered the Trump administration to make “a good faith request” to the government of El Salvador, seeking Cristian’s release to U.S. custody so he could return to the United States. She also ordered the administration not to deport other migrants covered by the settlement.\n\nEl Salvador President Nayib Bukele on Sunday proposed sending 252 Venezuelans deported from the U.S. and

Time host's comments on dining with President Donald Trump.\n\n \"Nobody has been harder and more prescient, I must say, about Donald Trump than me. I don't need to be lectured on who Donald Trump is,\" Maher said Thursday on Piers Morgan Uncensored. \"Just the fact that I met him in person didn't change that. And the fact that I reported honestly is not a sin either.\"\n\n Maher said he and the Curb Your Enthusiasm creator had previously been friends, although \"this wasn't my favorite moment of our friendship.\"\n\n He also said David's reference to the Holocaust was out of line.\n\n \"To use the Hitler thing,\" Maher started. \"I, first of all, I just think it's kind of insulting to 6 million dead Jews. That should kind of be in its own place in history.\" He added that, \"Hitler has really kinda got to stay in his own place. He is the GOAT of evil, and we're just gonna have to, I think, leave it like that.\"\n\n He said he didn't think it was appropriate. His publicist let him know about the essay after it had been published.\n\n Still, Maher said he held out hope that he and David would be on good terms again and remarked that he's open to talking to the comedian.\n\n \"I don't want to make this constantly personal with me and Larry,\" he said. \"I mean, we might be friends again. I don't know.\"\n\n David's column, published Monday in The New York Times, described someone who met with a powerful man they had criticized and found that he was more relatable than expected and even able to joke. He noted that if others were able to see this side of him, they would feel differently about him.\n\n \"Two hours later, the dinner was over, and the Führer escorted me to the door, 'I am so glad to have met you. I hope I'm no longer the monster you thought I was,'\" David wrote. \"'I must say, mein Führer, I'm so thankful I came. Although we disagree on many issues, it doesn't mean that we have to hate each other.' And with that, I gave him a Nazi salute and walked out into the night.\"\n\n Sign up for Entertainment Weekly's free daily newsletter to get breaking TV news, exclusive first looks, recaps, reviews, interviews with your favorite stars, and more.\n\n David told the newspaper that he respects Maher and his words were about the importance of not losing sight of who people really are.\n\n The essay came three weeks after Maher, a frequent critic of Trump, had met with the president at the White House. Maher said afterward on his HBO series and Club Random podcast that Trump had not been as he expected but more \"gracious and measured\" during their encounter. He was more relatable, too, Maher said.\n\n Entertainment Weekly has reached out to reps for David.\n\n Watch the full interview above.","url":"https://ew.com/bill-maher-responds-to-larry-david-hitler-essay-mocking-his-trump-dinner-11721773","image":"https://ew.com/thmb/lcqE692-P7xZtdBXmgiEjyzlF38=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/bill-maher-larry-david-042425-0caf05fd99c641efbd0fe088dd9c740e.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-24 23:38:16","author":"Raechal Shewfelt","authors":["Raechal Shewfelt"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.224},{"id":314542026,"title":"US Judge Partly Blocks Trump Order Reforming Elections","text":"A US judge on Thursday partially blocked an executive order by President Donald Trump aimed at sweeping election reforms, the latest legal setback in enacting his agenda.Judge Colleen Kollar-Kotelly specifically prevented the Trump administration from requiring voters to provide proof of US citizenship when registering to vote at the state level.The executive order, signed at the end of March, set its sights on restricting mail-in voting, which Trump has criticized for years.The order faced legal challenges as soon as it was signed, with the Democratic Party itself launching court proceedings against it.(function(v,d,o,ai){ai=d.createElement(\"script\");ai.defer=true;ai.async=true;ai.src=v.location.protocol+o;d.head.appendChild(ai);})(window, document, \"//a.vdo.ai/core/v-ndtv/vdo.ai.js\");Kollar-Kotelly justified enacting a preliminary injunction against Trump's order by arguing that on further review of \"the merits, the plaintiffs are substantially likely to prevail.\"\"Our Constitution entrusts Congress and the States -- not the President -- with the authority to regulate federal elections,\" she wrote in her 120-page decision.Kollar-Kotelly declined to block another significant part of the executive order, which required states to impose a deadline for mail-in ballots coinciding with the close of polls on Election Day.Though US citizenship is required to vote in federal elections, not all states require voters to bring documents attesting to their citizenship status, opting instead for other verification methods.States that failed to comply with the executive order were threatened with having their federal election funding cut off.Richard Hasen, a law professor at the University of California, Los Angeles has described the executive order as \"dangerous\" because it could \"potentially disenfranchise millions of voters.\"In a March post on his Election Law blog, Hasen called Trump's directive \"an executive power grab,\" and noted that \"federal elections are largely the responsibility of the states, with Congress setting rules for the conduct of elections.\"Trump has never conceded defeat in the 2020 presidential election against Joe Biden, and has repeatedly and baselessly claimed widespread voter fraud.Since his return to the White House on January 20, the 78-year-old Republican has issued dozens of executive orders, many of which have faced legal challenges.As recently as Thursday, a judge blocked the Trump administration from withholding federal funds from so-called \"sanctuary cities\" that offer protective measures for migrants.(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)","summary":"A US judge on Thursday partially blocked an executive order by President Donald Trump aimed at sweeping election reforms, the latest legal setback in enacting his agenda.","url":"https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/us-judge-partly-blocks-donald-trump-order-reforming-elections-8249938","image":"https://c.ndtvimg.com/2025-02/h342r7i8_donald-trump-afp_625x300_26_February_25.jpeg?im=FeatureCrop,algorithm=dnn,width=1200,height=738","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-24 23:35:58","author":"Agence France-Presse","authors":["Agence France-Presse"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"in","sentiment":-0.541},{"id":314543892,"title":"European Union rep confirms updates to trade agreement with Mexico","text":"The trade agreement between the European Union and Mexico will be updated to include an energy chapter, the EU’s Executive Vice President for the Clean, Fair, and Competitive Transition, Teresa Ribera, announced on Wednesday.\n\nThe new chapter of Europe’s trade deal with Mexico is expected to focus on the transition to clean and renewable energy, as well as energy and agri-food sustainability, Ribera said during her visit to Mexico.\n\n“In recent months, we have reached an agreement to modernize a global agreement that over the last 25 years has brought very important benefits to our societies and our economy,” Ribera stated during a Wednesday press conference.\n\nThe agreement, which has enhanced trade relations between the two powers, was signed in 1997 and entered into force in 2000. The EU has since become the second-largest investor in Mexico and its third-largest trade partner globally.\n\nRibera discussed the geopolitical pressures being faced by several countries worldwide due to the United States trade war and the imposition of tariffs by U.S. President Donald Trump.\n\n“It is very difficult to predict what could happen because circumstances show that reality can change very quickly,” said Ribera.\n\nThe new energy chapter \n\nMexico’s President Claudia Sheinbaum announced on Jan. 23 that the energy sector had been excluded from the EU-Mexico trade agreement.\n\nHowever, during her visit, Ribera said that energy policies had been discussed in general terms, although it is not clear to what extent it is reflected in the agreement.\n\n“There is close and intense cooperation on energy matters between the EU and Mexico,” said Ribera.\n\nUnofficial sources said that the agreement is expected to be approved by the end of the year, pending the standard bureaucratic process for legislation in the EU, and an updated treaty has already been drafted, the Mexican newspaper La Jornada reported.\n\n“Nothing is stopping the signing beyond the usual bureaucratic processes that we all must comply with, in our case, with a certain degree of complexity,” Ribera explained.\n\nRibera emphasized the importance of international cooperation to support a green transition, stressing that the U.S. withdrawal from the Paris Agreement will not halt progress.\n\n“The world has 192 countries, and if the United States leaves the agreement, the rest of us must continue,” she added.\n\nWith reports from La Jornada and El Sol de México","summary":"As U.S. trade relations remain on shaky ground, EU Vice President Teresa Ribera is shoring up diplomatic ties with a tour of Mexico.\n\n\nThe post European Union rep confirms updates to trade agreement with Mexico appeared first on Mexico News Daily","url":"https://mexiconewsdaily.com/business/european-union-trade-agreement-mexico/","image":"https://mexiconewsdaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/53787249222_3677ca10d5_b.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-24 23:34:44","author":"MND Staff","authors":["MND Staff"],"language":"en","source_country":"mx","sentiment":-0.058},{"id":314548524,"title":"Hegseth had 'dirty' internet line in his office to use Signal, sources say","text":"US Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth had an internet connection that bypassed the Pentagon's security protocols set up in his office to use the Signal messaging app on a personal computer, two sources have told The Associated Press (AP).\n\nThe existence of the unsecured internet connection is the latest revelation about Mr Hegseth's use of the unclassified app.\n\nKnown as a \"dirty\" internet line by the IT industry, it connects directly to the public internet where the user's information and the websites accessed do not have the same security filters or protocols that the Pentagon's secured connections maintain.\n\nOther Pentagon offices have used them, particularly if there's a need to monitor information or websites that would otherwise be blocked.\n\nBut the biggest advantage of using such a line is that the user would not show up as one of the many IP addresses assigned to the Department of Defense — essentially the user is masked, according to a senior US official familiar with military network security.\n\nHowever, it also can expose users to hacking and surveillance.\n\nA \"dirty\" line also may lack the record keeping compliance required by federal law, the official said.\n\nAll three sources spoke to AP on condition of anonymity to discuss a sensitive matter.\n\nLine set up to use Signal\n\nThe two people familiar with the line said Mr Hegseth had it set up in his office to use the Signal app.\n\nLast month, a reporter from The Atlantic published their account of being added to a group chat on the messaging app Signal and watching live as details about an imminent United States attack on Houthi rebels in Yemen were dropped into the thread by a user calling themselves Pete Hegseth. \n\nHe shared the details of the Houthi attacks in two chats, one included his wife and brother, while the other included President Donald Trump’s top national security officials.\n\nAsked about Mr Hegseth’s use of Signal in his office, which was first reported by The Washington Post, chief Pentagon spokesperson Sean Parnell said the defence secretary's “use of communications systems and channels is classified”.\n\n“However, we can confirm that the Secretary has never used and does not currently use Signal on his government computer,\" Mr Parnell said in a statement.\n\nInitially, Mr Hegseth was going to the back area of his office where he could access wi-fi to use his devices, one of the sources said.\n\nHe later requested a line at his desk where he could use his own computer.\n\nThe source told AP at times there were three computers around his desk — a personal computer; another for classified information; and a third for sensitive defence information.\n\nBecause electronic devices are vulnerable to spying, no-one is supposed to have them inside the defence secretary's office.\n\nImportant offices at the Pentagon have a cabinet or drawer where staff or visitors are required to leave devices.\n\nCalls continue for Hegseth to be fired\n\nAfter multiple uses of Signal to share highly sensitive military information and his family's presence at high-level meetings there are calls for him to be removed.\n\nDemocrats Chuck Schumer and Pete Buttigieg renewed the calls on Sunday last week.\n\n\"The details keep coming out. We keep learning how Pete Hegseth put lives at risk. But Trump is still too weak to fire him. Pete Hegseth must be fired,\" Mr Schumer posted to social media platform X.\n\nMr Buttigieg wrote: \"The Secretary is unfit to lead.\"\n\nThe National Security Agency issued a warning this year about concerns that foreign hackers could try to target government officials using Signal.\n\nThat was before the Houthi attack plans were shared with a journalist and Mr Hegseth's family.\n\nGoogle has also previously advised caution about Russia-aligned hackers targeting Signal users.\n\nMr Hegseth's Signal use is under investigation by the Department of Defense's acting inspector-general at the request of the bipartisan leadership of the Senate Armed Services Committee.\n\nHe has vehemently denied he posted \"war plans\" or classified information.\n\nBut the information he did post in chats would have been classified and could have put service members at risk, multiple current and former military and defence officials have said.","summary":"The unsecured internet connection is the latest revelation about Mr Hegseth's use of the app and raises the possibility that sensitive defence information could have been hacked. ","url":"https://www.abc.net.au/news/2025-04-25/hegseth-had-unsecured-internet-line-to-use-signal/105215350","image":"https://live-production.wcms.abc-cdn.net.au/bf9a9f73910366e9ce56d24fa71fb3c9?impolicy=wcms_crop_resize&cropH=2813&cropW=5000&xPos=0&yPos=262&width=862&height=485","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-24 23:32:27","author":"ABC News","authors":["ABC News"],"language":"en","source_country":"AU","sentiment":-0.271},{"id":314549474,"title":"Asylum dispute: Federal judge orders deported migrant returned","text":"to top close Video This video is playing in picture-in-picture.\n\nSpecial Report April 24, 2025 02:29 \n\n Asylum dispute: Federal judge orders deported migrant returned \n Fox News correspondent David Spunt breaks down the legal challenges to President Donald Trump's deportations and his executive order for sanctuary cities on 'Special Report.'\n Tags POLITICSSHOWSWHAT TO WATCH | VIDEOSLATEST NEWS | VIDEOSON AIRSPECIAL REPORTFEDERAL COURTSDEPORTATIONDONALD TRUMPENFORCEMENTSANCTUARY CITIESLAW","summary":"Fox News correspondent David Spunt breaks down the legal challenges to President Donald Trump&apos;s deportations and his executive order for sanctuary cities on &apos;Special Report.&apos;","url":"https://www.foxnews.com/video/6371903369112","image":"https://a57.foxnews.com/cf-images.us-east-1.prod.boltdns.net/v1/static/694940094001/c3ffa889-49b2-45f3-b27a-d0959c51b769/4e5a4d3f-9630-48bb-8871-2ad41707bb54/1280x720/match/1024/512/image.jpg?ve=1&tl=1","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-24 23:31:26","author":null,"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.124},{"id":314549476,"title":"Trump expresses displeasure with Russia after recent strikes on Ukraine","text":"to top close Video This video is playing in picture-in-picture.\n\nSpecial Report April 24, 2025 03:18 \n\n Trump expresses displeasure with Russia after recent strikes on Ukraine \n Fox News senior national correspondent Rich Edson discusses President Donald Trump’s efforts to cut a peace deal between Russia and Ukraine on ‘Special Report.’\n Tags POLITICSSHOWSWHAT TO WATCH | VIDEOSLATEST NEWS | VIDEOSON AIRSPECIAL REPORTDONALD TRUMPUKRAINE","summary":"Fox News senior national correspondent Rich Edson discusses President Donald Trump’s efforts to cut a peace deal between Russia and Ukraine on ‘Special Report.’","url":"https://www.foxnews.com/video/6371903360112","image":"https://a57.foxnews.com/cf-images.us-east-1.prod.boltdns.net/v1/static/694940094001/4447b56c-8492-4a94-a6f2-07a0254a0347/c8c34bf8-180a-48ea-89aa-b4338aa17f4d/1280x720/match/1024/512/image.jpg?ve=1&tl=1","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-24 23:30:46","author":null,"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.153},{"id":314539356,"title":"Letters: Research funding should not be a cudgel for Trump","text":"Research funding\nshould not be cudgel\n\nRe: “Harvard sues Trump administration to stop the freeze of more than $2 billion in grants” (April 22).\n\nYou reported that Harvard University is suing the Trump administration after a freeze on more than $2 billion in federal research grants. This is alarming because it suggests federal funding may now be conditioned on compliance with political demands, rather than academic merit or public benefit.\n\nAs a public health student, I am deeply concerned about the implications of using research funding as leverage. Much of this funding supports scientific and medical advancements that impact communities far beyond Harvard’s campus.\n\nWhat people don’t realize is that this sets a precedent that any university that challenges government policy could face similar consequences.\n\nOne thing that would make a difference is a bipartisan agreement that federal research funding should never be weaponized to influence university policies or suppress student expression. This ensures that scientific progress and intellectual freedom remain above political agendas.\n\nPope Francis recalled\nas friend to animals\n\nAnimals everywhere have lost a true champion with the passing of Pope Francis. Consider this excerpt from his 2015 “Encyclical on Climate Change & Inequality“:\n\n“It follows that our indifference or cruelty towards fellow creatures of this world sooner or later affects the treatment we mete out to other human beings. We have only one heart, and the same wretchedness which leads us to mistreat an animal will not be long in showing itself in our relationships with other people. Every act of cruelty toward any creature is contrary to human dignity.” All you rodeo fans, take heed.\n\nRest in peace, Pope Francis, and heartfelt thanks. May your tribe increase.\n\nProp. 13’s legacy still\nhurts our schools\n\nRe: “Teachers union hints at possible strike” (Page B1, April 10).\n\nThe looming teacher strike in Fremont isn’t just about salaries but a symptom of decades-long failures to prioritize public education. We wouldn’t be in this position if Proposition 13 hadn’t gutted school funding overnight back in 1978.\n\nTeachers are now forced to fight for basics: competitive wages, affordable health care and smaller classes, which should already be the bare minimum. How is it acceptable that in one of the wealthiest states in the nation, educators have to pay for medical and dental expenses out of pocket?\n\nDistrict leaders are claiming financial limitations, which are the direct legacy of Proposition 13’s corporate tax loopholes that cost California between $8 billion and $12 billion per year in lost revenue. Until we reform Proposition 13, our students and teachers will keep paying the price.\n\nJules Pizano\n\nAd dollars could be\nmuch better spent\n\nI’m curious if the taxpayer-funded $200 million ad campaign featuring Kristi Noem heaping lavish praise on Donald Trump and the countless and endless PG&E ads glorifying the wonderful work the monopoly is doing — as they rack up billion-dollar profits — could be put to better uses.\n\nHow about rehiring some crucial federal employees, or maintaining or lowering the constantly rising utility bills of Californians? With little resistance from the cult-led federal government and state regulatory agencies, I guess I just have to sit back and enjoy the artistry of the ads featuring the dog-shooter and all the earnest PG&E executives so concerned with the feelings of the common people and their pain.\n\nRobert Mariotti\n\nMusk’s money no license\nto ruin government\n\nIf Elon Musk divided one of his billions evenly among 40 21-year-olds, then told the young adults that each could spend the money as they wished as long as they limited themselves to an average of $1,000 in expenditures per day, some would likely not outlast their gift, since each would need nearly 70 years to spend it.\n\nWhile part of me does not begrudge Elon Musk his billions, that kind of wealth does not entitle him to deplete the staffs at national parks, deny U.S. farmers the ability to provide vulnerable Africans with much-needed food, nor dismiss well-intentioned federal employees, those who don’t have even $100 to spend as they wish at the end of most days.\n\nDouglas A.

Let’s check in when they’re 60,” Dunham told Rushfield during the Wednesday broadcast. “Let’s check in when they’re not at Sex and the City age, they’ve taken even another leap. Part of the goal of the show was always to lean into what was unexpected, so we want to be unexpected if we come together again.”\n\nDunham also argued that it’s “almost impossible” to imagine Girls taking place in the present day as a core of the show’s thematic arc relied on the political and cultural tone-deafness of its lead characters—four white girls with rich parents living in gentrified Brooklyn. \n\n“I feel like in a world after Me Too, in a world after the summer of 2020 uprisings and the conversation that existed in America around race, the conversations that are happening around gender, that so much of the confusion and ignorance that the characters exhibited—which was a part of their story—would be almost impossible for people who lived in Brooklyn and were plugged into the world to really exhibit,” Dunham said. \n\nAlthough the comedy-drama is currently in the midst of a cultural victory lap, at the time of its release, it consistently was at the epicenter of backlash (which inspired even more backlash to the backlash) exacerbated by the controversy surrounding Dunham in real life. Vulture even published a 1,500 word list of all the show’s controversies in 2017, ranging from the inherent privilege of its characters and its predominant white cast to Dunham’s body—which perhaps spurred some of the most deafening discourse on the show. \n\n“It’s hard to imagine the show having more blowback than the show had because it had probably the maximum amount of blowback that a show with that number of viewers can experience,” Dunham recalled of the criticism around Girls. “It was like 800 times the blowback of the viewership. I feel like we had blowback from people who weren’t even watching the show; they were just wanting to join in a little bit of an internet party.” \n\nDunham said one thing that she was able to pinpoint from Girls’ online hate train in the early 2010s, however, was the beginning of the MAGA movement before it had fully formed under President Donald Trump. \n\n“It’s fascinating because when MAGA culture really started to emerge clearly, I remember certain friends of mine being so shocked by the way that certain people spoke or thought,” Dunham said. “It was a surprise to them, and having been online in the early days of Girls, it wasn’t a surprise to me because there were those voices, they just hadn’t created a larger umbrella of identification over themselves.”\n\nShe added, “So, they were always there and I always knew they were thinking very differently than our audience was, and never the twain shall meet. But I didn’t have a word for what they were.”","summary":"Dimitrios Kambouris/WireImageLena Dunham is considering a reboot of her cult hit show Girls, which has enjoyed a Gen Z renaissance in recent years.\n\nSpeaking to journalist Richard Rushfield on The Ankler’s Substack Live, The Rushfield Lunch, Dunham weighed in on a possible Girls revival and how the HBO hit, a millennial period piece chronicling the lives of four young women in New York City, has aged in a post-Obama zeitgeist. \n\n“We haven’t had a conversation about a reunion only because we always said when the show ended that if we were going to go back, it would have to be at such a different phase in their lives.
