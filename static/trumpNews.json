Their release is to be followed later by the handover of bodies of the remaining 28 deceased hostages. \n\nTRUMP DUE TO ADDRESS THE KNESSET \n\nUnder the ceasefire agreement, Hamas is due by noon on Monday to release the remaining hostages, taken captive on October 7, 2023, when the group’s militants launched the surprise attack on Israel that ignited the war. \n\nIsrael’s hostages coordinator Gal Hirsch on Thursday said a task force would be formed to help find the remains of any dead hostages that Hamas could not locate. \n\nTrump is due to arrive in Israel on Monday to address the Knesset, the parliament, before traveling to Sharm El Sheikh in Egypt for a world leaders’ summit on ending the Gaza war. \n\nTrump’s envoy Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner addressed a rally in Tel Aviv on Saturday, which many Israelis hoped would be the final one urging the release of hostages and end to the war. \n\nThe United States, along with Egypt, Qatar and Turkey, mediated what has been described as a first phase agreement between Israel and Hamas for a ceasefire and the release of hostages by Hamas and prisoners and detainees by Israel. \n\n“For two years we (have been) waiting for this day for this moment... All of us feel happy for the family, for the hostages, that finally .. we will see them,” said demonstrator Dalia Yosef, thanking Trump. \n\nGAZANS RETURNING TO NORTH FIND DEVASTATION\n\nThe Israel Prison Service said it had transferred some Palestinian prisoners to other facilities ahead of their expected release. The Israeli Ministry of Justice has released the names of 250 Palestinians, convicted of murder and other serious crimes, who are to be freed under the deal. \n\nThe list does not include senior Hamas commanders that the Islamist militant group had sought to free, or prominent figures from other factions such as Marwan Al Barghouti or Ahmed Saadat. \n\nAlthough that was not expected to derail the agreement, Hamas’ prisoners information office said that talks with Israeli mediators over the list of prisoners to be freed were ongoing. \n\nIsrael is also to release 1,700 Palestinians who have been detained in Gaza since October 7, 2023 and 22 Palestinian minors, along with the bodies of 360 militants. Israeli government spokesperson Bedrosian said the prisoners would be released once the living hostages reach Israeli territory. \n\nIsraeli Defense Minister Israel Katz said that once the hostages were returned, the military would destroy underground tunnels in Gaza built by Hamas. \n\nPalestinians returning to northern Gaza have described widespread devastation. Rescue workers warned there could be unexploded ordnance and bombs in the area. \n\nAmjad Al Shawa, who heads a Palestinian organisation coordinating with aid groups, estimated 300,000 tents were needed to temporarily house 1.5 million displaced Gazans. \n\n“We couldn’t believe the destruction we have seen,” Rami Mohammad-Ali, 37, said by phone after walking 15 km (9.5 miles) with his son from Deir Al Balah to Gaza City. \n\n“We are joyful to return to Gaza (City) but at the same time we have bitter feelings about the destruction,” he said, describing seeing human remains scattered along roads.","summary":"CAIRO/JERUSALEM: A ceasefire between Israel and Hamas held in Gaza for a third day on Sunday ahead of the expected release of Israeli hostages and Palestinian prisoners and an address by US President Donald Trump to Israel’s parliament. \n\n\n\nThousands of Palestinians continued to travel north towards Gaza City, the focus of Israeli attacks over the past two months, hopeful the ceasefire would bring an end to the war. \n\n\n\n“There is a lot of joy among the people,” said Abdou Abu Seada, adding that the joy was tempered by exhaustion after two years of war that has destroyed much of Gaza. \n\n\n\nGovernment spokesperson Shosh Bedrosian said that Israel expected the hostages to start being released early Monday morning with the 20 living hostages to be released together. \n\n\n\nIn the event that hostages were released earlier, Israel was ready to receive them, she said.

He spoke out after Beijing unveiled curbs on the export of rare earths earlier in the week.While Chinese markets will get their first chance to respond on Monday, any following of the U.S. selloff may be tempered by weekend signals from the White House that it’s open to a deal and Trump declaring the U.S. wanted to help, not hurt China.","summary":"After Beijing unveiled curbs on the export of rare earths earlier in the week, U.S. President Donald Trump said he would put an additional 100% tariff on China from Nov. 1.","url":"https://www.japantimes.co.jp/business/2025/10/13/markets/china-markets-us-trade-war/","image":"https://www.japantimes.co.jp/japantimes/uploads/images/2025/10/13/499272.jpg?v=3.1","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-10-13 00:20:00","author":"Dave Sebastian,Tian Chen,Web Master","authors":["Dave Sebastian","Tian Chen","Web Master"],"language":"en","source_country":"JP","sentiment":-0.383},{"id":368656248,"title":"Trump may be winning on the world stage, but success at home is elusive","text":"When Donald Trump was first elected president, foreign policy seemed like the zone of greatest danger, the place where a political novice promising to remake the world order was most likely to blunder into true catastrophe.\n\nInstead, Trump’s first-term foreign policy was broadly successful, with more stability, fewer dramatic stumbles and more breakthroughs than his domestic policy efforts. And it was much more successful than the rolling crises and debacles of the Joe Biden presidency, a contrast that was one of the underrated cases for Trump’s restoration.\n\nNow, with the provisional deal to end the war in the Gaza Strip, the pattern of Trump 1.0 is reasserting itself. As a domestic leader, the president is powerful but unpopular, with a scant legislative agenda and an increasingly vendetta-driven public image. But on the world stage, he is currently much more successful (allowing, yes, for strong scepticism about the administration’s China strategy).\n\nIf peace in Ukraine remains elusive, Trump has induced Europe to bear more of the burden without yielding to the Russians, as many critics feared. The Iranian nuclear program and terror networks have been hammered without major blowback. And now, there is the possibility of a real breakthrough in Israel and Palestine, an achievement that’s clearly the result of the White House’s strong-arming diplomatic efforts.","summary":"Domestically, the president is powerful but unpopular, with a scant legislative agenda and a vendetta-driven public image.","url":"https://www.theage.com.au/world/north-america/trump-may-be-winning-on-the-world-stage-but-success-at-home-is-elusive-20251013-p5n206.html","image":"https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.2304%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.776846%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_34/t_crop_custom/q_86%2Cf_auto/4e5264b00290f6202eff6fc1d72b4f8efcd54b66","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-10-13 00:15:00","author":"Ross Douthat","authors":["Ross Douthat"],"language":"en","source_country":"au","sentiment":0.321},{"id":368656314,"title":"Chrissy Teigen talks about 'polarizing' friendship with Meghan Markle and why their kids don't have playdates","text":"Home and Garden\n\nKim Kardashian\n\nVictoria Beckham\n\nHarry Styles\n\nAmanda Holden\n\nPrivacy Policy\n\nMonday, Oct 13th 2025\n\n5-Day Forecast\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTrump arrives for his day of destiny: This has 'never happened before', he says as he flies in to see Israeli hostages released by Hamas under his peace deal\n\nDiane Keaton's final moments laid bare in chilling 911 call\n\nRachel Reeves could impose a surprise 'one off' tax on wealth in Budget next month\n\nWorried you're drinking too much?

Rare earth elements are a group of 17 elements sharing similar chemical traits. These elements have high-tech applications, particularly in the form of rare earth magnets, due to their unique magnetic and electrical properties.Live EventsThe programme will complement the government’s efforts to boost domestic production of rare earth magnets. ET had earlier reported that a key inter-ministerial panel had approved a Rs 7,300 crore incentive scheme to promote the production of rare earth magnets, with a target of 6,000 tonnes over the next five years. Under the National Critical Minerals Mission, the government has earmarked `500 crore to “guard against supply disruptions and ensure mineral availability for domestic use.” Sector experts said China’s restrictions on rare earth magnet exports persist despite early signs of relaxation. Meanwhile, US President Donald Trump recently threatened an additional 100% tariff on imports from China in retaliation to the latter’s new export controls on rare earths. Industry experts maintain that while stockpiling is crucial to the NCMM’s success, India’s limited technological capacity to extract rare earths from domestic reserves remains a key challenge as most supplies are currently imported.Add as a Reliable and Trusted News Source Add Now!\n India is estimated to hold 7.23 million tonnes of rare earth oxide locked in 13.15 million tonnes of monazite, found in coastal and inland deposits across Andhra Pradesh, Odisha, Tamil Nadu, Kerala, West Bengal, Jharkhand, Gujarat and Maharashtra. The ministry of mines has, so far, conducted five tranches of auctions, putting 55 critical and strategic mineral blocks under the hammer, of which 34 have been successfully awarded.

Email tips@dailymail.co.uk \nBy MILLY VEITCH, SHOWBUSINESS REPORTER \n Published:00:48 BST, 13 October 2025 |Updated:00:58 BST, 13 October 2025 \n\nLorraine Kelly has broken her silence on ITV's decision to brutally slash her daytime show, insisting that despite the 'heartbreaking' cuts, she won't be quitting her programme anytime soon.\nThe TV presenter, 65, saw her titular morning show facing the brunt of the cuts announced in May, with Good Morning Britain now taking her 9-10am slot for 22 weeks of the year.\nFor the remaining 30 weeks of the year, will present five days a week, meaning her Friday stand-in presenters Ranvir Singh and Christine Lampard are no longer needed for the show.\nWhile the show's running time has also been slashed in half, now airing for just 30 minutes from 9:30am to 10am.\nIn the months since ITV's announcement was made, speculation has run rife that Lorraine will walk away from the show.\nHowever, speaking out on the cuts for the first time in five months, the Scottish star vowed to remain on the show for as long as possible, 'until people get fed up'.\n\nLorraine Kelly has broken her silence on ITV's decision to slash her daytime show, insisting that despite the 'heartbreaking' cuts, she wasn't going to quit anytime soon (seen Feb)\n\nSpeaking out on the cuts for the first time in five months, the Scottish star, 65, vowed to remain on the show for as long as possible, 'until people get fed up' (seen in July)\nShe told The Mirror she'd had an 'inkling' that there would be changes coming, but that the show had been 'trying really hard' to make up for the lack of budget by 'punching way above our weight for the quality of guests that we get on'.\nAdmitting she had been 'angry' over the decision, Lorraine insisted that her ire was on behalf of her team, who saw their jobs also slashed.\nReports previously suggested that out of ITV's daytime staff of around 450 employees, up to 220 jobs are at risk.\nShe claimed she had been 'fine' with the news that her shows would be shorter and on less frequently, as her main priority had been to 'save as many jobs as possible'.\nWhile she said many of those who lost their jobs have since been assigned to other programmes, Lorraine confessed it had been 'heartbreaking' to lose team members that she'd 'grown up with' and worked alongside for more than 20 years.\nShe said: 'It’s been difficult with the cuts, it’s been hard. I’m a lot happier about it now but it was honestly and genuinely all about the team. I wasn't annoyed or angry about this for me... it was about the team.' \nBut despite her heartbreak over the changes - and a number of predictions that she is set to quit for good next year - she insisted that the cuts have not convinced her to retire.\nCiting the likes of Loose Women panellists Janet Street Porter and Gloria Hunniford as 'astonishing women who are just getting into their stride in their 70s and 80s', Lorraine insisted that she would be following in their stead.\n\nAdmitting she had been 'angry' over the decision, Lorraine insisted that her ire was on behalf of her team, who saw their jobs also slashed\n\nIn answer to the reports that she will be making her exit when her year-long contract comes to an end, she denied: 'Absolutely not. I am going to be toddling off that show in my Zimmer frame and even then, I’ll be coming in.\n'I don’t see me going anywhere until people get fed up, you know? Until people say, I’ve had enough of that one.'\nDaily Mail previously revealed Lorraine was given the chance by ITV bosses to merge her daytime show with GMB to present the last 30 minutes of their broadcast, but she declined.\nShe had been pulled into a meeting prior to the channel's budget cuts announcement where she was offered the new proposal, which was considered an 'easy fix' after the same format was adopted during the pandemic.\nBut sources revealed that she was 'insulted' by the suggestion and told bigwigs it wasn't a possibility, resulting in the reduced runtime of her show from an hour to 30 minutes.\nDaily Mail understood that Lorraine, who has presented her show for the past 14 years, was prepared to 'walk away' but agreed to continue hosting the series until the end of 2026.\nA new role titled 'Head of Lorraine' was created to oversee the changes, but the contract is only for a 12-month period.\nIt was previously reported that staff are fearing Lorraine may decide to throw in the towel after the cuts were announced, with a source telling The Mirror: 'There are genuine fears among staff that Lorraine may decide to walk if the quality of the show they are putting out declines.\n\nCiting the likes of Loose Women panellists Janet Street Porter and Gloria Hunniford (seen) as 'astonishing women who are just getting into their stride in their 70s and 80s', Lorraine insisted that she would be following in their stead\n\n'It's hard to see how standards won't fall….and there are questions over whether Lorraine will want to be associated with that. Lorraine and her team are perfectionists - it's why the show is loved by so many.'\n\n Lorraine, Loose Women and This Morning to share new studio space amid budget cuts \nChanging viewing habits, including an increased reliance on streaming services, have forced ITV to make some difficult decisions in a bid to remain profitable and keep some of the UK's most beloved shows on air.\nMeanwhile ITV's big-hitting daytime shows will soon be moving to a new shared studio space.\nLorraine, This Morning and Loose Women will relocate in January to the basement studio of London's The H Club Studio, a former private members' club in Covent Garden.\nAlmost 900 hours of live daily programming a year will be produced at the new studio, which features a 360-degree set with LED walls to project the backgrounds for the different shows.\nInstead of separate spaces, the three series, which air back-to-back on weekdays on ITV, will use one gallery, with a quick turn around plan of the space between shows.\nThe space, which is across two floors, will also be open to other ITV shows outside of the daytime schedule.\n\nLorraine, This Morning and Loose Women will relocate in January to the basement studio of London's The H Club Studio, a former private members' club in Covent Garden (seen) \nManaging Director at ITV Studios Daytime Emma Gormley said: 'As we work towards more cutting edge and efficient ways to produce Daytime shows in 2026.\n'This move to The H Club studio offers state of the art technology that we can use across our programmes to create shows that are distinctive - with a look and feel that are familiar to and loved by our viewers.\n'In a time of transformation for the entire industry, I want to thank all our Daytime teams for their dedication and skill in producing high-quality, compelling live shows every day throughout this period.'\nThe move was announced as part of a wider shake-up to the ITV schedule, which will see Lorraine, This Morning and Loose Women produced by one team.\nChristine LampardLoose WomenLorraine Kelly\n\nShare or comment on this article: \nLorraine Kelly breaks her silence on brutal ITV cuts as she brands overhaul of her daytime show 'heartbreaking' and 'tough' but insists she will NOT quit: 'I don't see me going anywhere'\n\nAdd comment\n\nComments 22\n\n Share what you think\n\nWorst rated\n\nThe comments below have not been moderated.\n\nThe views expressed in the contents above are those of our users and do not necessarily reflect the views of MailOnline.\n\nAdd your comment\n\nEnter your comment\n\nBy posting your comment you agree to our house rules.\n\nSubmit Comment\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual.\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual\n\nWe will automatically post your comment and a link to the news story to your Facebook timeline at the same time it is posted on MailOnline.

Email tips@dailymail.com \nBy ASHLEIGH GRAY \n Published:00:49 BST, 13 October 2025 |Updated:00:57 BST, 13 October 2025 \n\nJohn Legend weighed in on President Donald Trump's failed ambitions to win a Nobel Peace Prize, despite his peace deal in the Middle East between Israel and Gaza.\nThe 79-year-old second-term Commander-in-Chief lost this year's nomination to Venezuelan opposition leader Maria Corina Machado. \nAnd on Sunday, the 46-year-old singer had words of advice for Trump if he'd like to campaign for the honor in 2026: 'Stop declaring war on the American people, stop sending the military intro our cities simply because they're run by Democrats.'\n'He'd have to stop all this authoritarian dictator sh*t, all the fascist sh*t, all the inhumane sh*t he’s been trying to do,' Legend added. \nThe Save Room music artist mentioned his personal connection to the award, after having performed at 2017's Nobel ceremony. \nLegend, born John Roger Stephens, used Instagram to record a straightforward statement directed at the politician on Saturday.\n\nJohn Legend, 46, weighed in on President Donald Trump's failed ambitions to win a Nobel Peace Prize, stating he'd have to 'stop all this authoritarian dictator sh*t' first\n\nLegend shared a video trolling Trump's bid for the coveted prize on Sunday, captioned: 'Trump for Peace Prize 2026!'\n\nThe 79-year-old second-term Commander-in-Chief lost this year's nomination to Venezuelan opposition leader Maria Corina Machado; pictured October 9\nHe captioned the video post, shared with his nearly 16 million followers: 'Trump for Peace Prize 2026!' \nThe Voice coach has long been an outspoken critic of Trump's, declaring him a racist in past remarks.\nBut on Sunday he took a softer, though snarky, approach to his differences with the former reality TV show host. \n\n Homeland Security fires back after Chappell Roan's anti-ICE outburst at LA concert \nLegend rattled off previous winners of the Nobel Peace Prize, noting that it's often been gifted to human rights activists and world leaders who had negotiated a big peace agreement.\nHe also acknowledged that the president has 'made a step in the right direction' with the recent ceasefire he helped negotiate between Palestine and Israel. \n'We all want to see peace in Gaza, in the West Bank,' he declared in the video. 'And President Trump has been instrumental in bringing about this new peace deal.'\nAnd he added, 'Let's all pray that this deal is actually lasting, that it's long-term. The people of Gaza have had their lives and their communities destroyed for the past two years.'\n'If this peace is really lasting, we just might see Donald Trump get that peace prize that he really, really wants,' the musician said. \n\nThe singer had words of advice for Trump if he'd like to campaign for the honor in 2026: 'Stop declaring war on the American people, stop sending the military intro our cities simply because they're run by Democrats'\n\n'He'd have to stop all this authoritarian dictator sh*t, all the fascist sh*t, all the inhumane sh*t he’s been trying to do,' Legend added\n\nLegend and wife Chrissy Teigen have been candid about their anti-Trump stance; pictured in October 2024\n\nIn February Legend defended DEI and labeled Trump a 'white supremacist' while speaking at The Fifteen Percent Pledge's 15th Street Block Party in Hollywood\n\nThe Voice coach has long been an outspoken critic of Trump's, declaring him a racist in past remarks; pictured October 7\n\nWhile explaining that he too wants to see Trump win the award, he outlined what behavioral changes the Leader of the Free World will have to make.\n'Believe it or not, I want you to do this. I want this peace prize for you so badly. I want this for us, for all of us. Hear me out, y'all. \n'If Trump is able to actually earn the peace prize, it probably won't be enough that he's helped bring peace to the Middle East,' he prefaced before listing his latest gripes with the Trump administration.\n'Let's look at what else he would have to do: He'd have to stop sending Black Hawk helicopters to terrorize people while they sleep in their apartment buildings in Chicago,' he said, referencing the recent incident in Illinois.\n'Yes, the so-called \"Peace President\" who's ending wars around the world would also have to stop declaring war on the American people,' he emphasized. 'Stop sending the military into our cities simply because they're run by Democrats.'\nAnd pointing to the widespread ICE raids, he added, 'Stop sending masked, unaccountable ICE agents to torment immigrant communities. Stop ordering the prosecution of his political opponents on flimsy charges.'\nLegend said that in order for Trump to win the prize, he would also have to 'stop bombing boats in the Caribbean, stop executing people without proving that they've done anything wrong.'\nHe'd have to stop all this authoritarian, dictator sh*t, all the fascist sh*t, all the inhumane shit he's been trying to do.' \nToward the end of the clip, Legend stated: 'We should all really, really want Donald J. Trump to earn a Nobel Peace Prize, right?'\nThe day prior, Nobel Peace Prize winner Maria explained why she chose to dedicate the award to Trump following her shock win.\nMachado, who leads the opposition to Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro, was announced as this year's winner 'for her tireless work promoting democratic rights for the people of Venezuela,' the committee announced.\nHer victory came as a surprise to many who believed that that Trump would be honored with the award.\nShortly after her win Machado took to X where she explained that many people across the world are relying on the president, 'to achieve Freedom and democracy'.\n\nNobel Peace Prize winner Maria explained in a recent interview why she dedicated her award to Trump \n\nMachado praised Trump as a 'clear and courageous leader' and argued that he's ended numerous wars during his presidency \n\n'I dedicate this prize to the suffering people of Venezuela and to President Trump for his decisive support of our cause!' Machado wrote.\nOn Saturday she further explained the dedication during an interview with Rachel Campos-Duffy on Fox News where she heaped praise on the president.\n'Not only has he been involved in only a few months in solving eight wars, but his actions have been decisive to have Venezuela now at a threshold of freedom after 26 years of tyranny,' she said.\nShe praised Trump as being a 'clear and courageous' leader, arguing that he's been an advocate for dismantling criminal structures in Venezuela.\nJohn LegendDonald TrumpDemocratsIsrael\n\nShare or comment on this article: \nJohn Legend trolls Donald Trump over Nobel Peace Prize bid: 'Stop all this authoritarian dictator s***!'\n\nAdd comment\n\nComments 40\n\n Share what you think\n\nWorst rated\n\nThe comments below have not been moderated.\n\nThe views expressed in the contents above are those of our users and do not necessarily reflect the views of MailOnline.\n\nAdd your comment\n\nEnter your comment\n\nBy posting your comment you agree to our house rules.\n\nSubmit Comment\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual.\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual\n\nWe will automatically post your comment and a link to the news story to your Facebook timeline at the same time it is posted on MailOnline.

State Secretary Minister Prasetyo Hadi stated that President Prabowo received a sudden invitation to attend the Gaza Peace High-Level Conference on Saturday, October 11, 2025.\"The invitation sincerely requested the presence of Mr. President Prabowo because it is part of the ongoing negotiations which hopefully, by God's will, can bring peace to Palestine, especially in Gaza,\" said Prasetyo after a meeting at Prabowo's residence on Jalan Kertanegara IV, South Jakarta, October 12, 2025.Prasetyo stated that President Prabowo emphasized the importance of maintaining good relations for all parties. Therefore, the President decided to attend the invitation. However, Prasetyo mentioned that the government had not received information on whether there would be any agreements to be signed at the upcoming conference.It is known that the President of the United States, Donald Trump, and the President of Egypt, Abdel Fattah El Sisi, will lead the meeting to discuss proposals to end the war in Israel and Gaza. The meeting will take place in Sharm el-Sheikh on Monday, October 12, 2025.According to El Sisi, as reported by Al Jazeera, the meeting will involve leaders from 20 countries. \"The goal is to end the war in the Gaza Strip, enhance efforts to achieve peace and stability in the Middle East, and initiate a new era of regional security and stability,\" according to a statement on Saturday, October 11, 2025.United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres and UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer stated that they will be attending.

I might say, ‘look, if this war is not going to get settled, I’m going to send them Tomahawks,’” Trump told reporters aboard Air Force One on his way to the Middle East. The US president said Ukrainian counterpart Volodymyr Zelenskyy had asked for Tomahawks in a call on Saturday when they were discussing a fresh supply of weapons for Kyiv. “Tomahawks are a new step of aggression,” added Trump. “Do they [Russian forces] want to have Tomahawks going in their direction? I don’t think so.” Trump has been mulling potential supplies of the long-range missiles to Kyiv via European allies ever since his meeting with Putin in Alaska in August failed to produce a peace deal. Putin has previously warned against supplying Kyiv with Tomahawks, saying it would be a major escalation and affect relations between Washington and Moscow. Trump said last week that he has “sort of made a decision” on whether to send Tomahawks to Ukraine, without elaborating.\n\nZelenskyy said “we will see” when asked on Fox News whether Trump had approved the supply of Tomahawks. After his call with the US president, Zelenskyy told the Sunday Briefing: “We work on it … And I’m waiting for president to yes. Of course we count on such decisions, but we will see. We will see.” He said Friday that he was in talks with US officials about the possible provision of various long-range precision-strike weapons, including Tomahawks and more ATACMS tactical ballistic missiles. A senior Ukrainian delegation is set to visit the US this week.\n\nMoscow expressed “extreme concern” over the US potentially providing Tomahawk cruise missiles to Ukraine. Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said in remarks published on Sunday that “the topic of Tomahawks is of extreme concern”. “Now is really a very dramatic moment in terms of the fact that tensions are escalating from all sides,” he told Russian state media. Belarus president Alexander Lukashenko, a close ally of Putin, also said in comments released on Sunday that he doubted the US would provide Ukraine with Tomahawk cruise missiles. “I think we need to calm down in this regard. Our friend Donald … sometimes he takes a more forceful approach, and then, his tactic is to let go a little and step back. Therefore, we shouldn’t take this literally, as if it’s going to fly tomorrow,” Lukashenko told Russian state media.\n\nRussia attacked Ukraine’s power grid, part of a campaign to cripple Ukrainian energy infrastructure before winter. Kyiv regional Governor Mykola Kalashnyk said two employees of Ukraine’s largest private energy company, DTEK, were wounded in Russian strikes on a substation. Ukraine’s energy ministry said that infrastructure was also targeted in the regions of Donetsk, Odesa and Chernihiv. \n “Russia continues its aerial terror against our cities and communities, intensifying strikes on our energy infrastructure,” Zelenskyy wrote on X, saying that Russia had launched “more than 3,100 drones, 92 missiles, and around 1,360 glide bombs” over the past week. Ukraine’s energy sector has been a key battleground since Russia launched its fullscale invasion more than three years ago.\n\nZelenskyy called for tighter secondary sanctions on buyers of Russian oil. “Sanctions, tariffs, and joint actions against the buyers of Russian oil – those who finance this war – must all remain on the table,” he wrote, adding he had a “very productive” phone call with Trump, in which they discussed strengthening Ukraine’s “air defence, resilience, and long-range capabilities,” along with “details related to the energy sector”. Their discussion followed an earlier conversation on Saturday, Zelenskyy said, during which the leaders agreed on Sunday’s topics.\n\nA Ukrainian counteroffensive had made gains in southern Zaporizhzhia region as well as in Donetsk region, Zelenskyy said. Donetsk is the focal point of the conflict and where Kyiv has been reporting successes.","summary":"US president says he may warn Russian counterpart ‘look, if this war is not going to get settled, I’m going to send them Tomahawks’.

Our friend Donald … sometimes he takes a more forceful approach, and then, his tactic is to let go a little and step back. Therefore, we shouldn’t take this literally, as if it’s going to fly tomorrow,” Lukashenko told Russian state media.\n\nRussia attacked Ukraine’s power grid, part of a campaign to cripple Ukrainian energy infrastructure before winter. Kyiv regional Governor Mykola Kalashnyk said two employees of Ukraine’s largest private energy company, DTEK, were wounded in Russian strikes on a substation. Ukraine’s energy ministry said that infrastructure was also targeted in the regions of Donetsk, Odesa and Chernihiv. “Russia continues its aerial terror against our cities and communities, intensifying strikes on our energy infrastructure,” Zelenskyy wrote on X, saying that Russia had launched “more than 3,100 drones, 92 missiles, and around 1,360 glide bombs” over the past week. Ukraine’s energy sector has been a key battleground since Russia launched its fullscale invasion more than three years ago.\n\nZelenskyy called for tighter secondary sanctions on buyers of Russian oil. “Sanctions, tariffs, and joint actions against the buyers of Russian oil – those who finance this war – must all remain on the table,” he wrote, adding he had a “very productive” phone call with Trump, in which they discussed strengthening Ukraine’s “air defence, resilience, and long-range capabilities,” along with “details related to the energy sector”. Their discussion followed an earlier conversation on Saturday, Zelenskyy said, during which the leaders agreed on Sunday’s topics.\n\nA Ukrainian counteroffensive had made gains in southern Zaporizhzhia region as well as in Donetsk region, Zelenskyy said. Donetsk is the focal point of the conflict and where Kyiv has been reporting successes.","url":"https://uk.news.yahoo.com/ukraine-war-briefing-moscow-voices-235613610.html","image":"https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/kh74reuTBmJIP7SvKYPmYA--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTI0MDA7aD0xNDg4O2NmPXdlYnA-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/theguardian_763/b6f5986248051f921e468905d9c72c48","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-10-12 23:56:13","author":null,"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.061},{"id":368654834,"title":"LG Energy Solution Q3 profit likely up 34% on US EV sales rush","text":"SEOUL :Battery maker LG Energy Solution (LGES) said on Monday its third-quarter operating profit likely rose 34 per cent as U.S. consumers rushed to buy electric vehicles to take advantage of government incentives that expired on September 30.\n\nThe South Korean company, which supplies EV batteries to General Motors and Tesla, estimated its operating profit was 601 billion won ($420 million) during the July to September period, up from 448 billion won in profit a year earlier. \n\nThe preliminary figure beat a 528 billion won profit forecast compiled by LSEG SmartEstimate that was weighted toward analysts who are more consistently accurate. \n\nIts profit may have been boosted by the surge in U.S. EV sales ahead of the end of a $7,500 federal tax credit in September, analysts said. \n\nLGES warned in July of a further slowdown in EV demand by early next year due to the elimination of the tax credits as well as U.S. import tariffs imposed by President Donald Trump's administration. \n\nLGES shares were up 1.5 per cent in a wider market that was down 1.4 per cent. \n\nThe company would have made a 236 billion won operating profit excluding U.S. battery manufacturing incentives it received under the U.S. Inflation Reduction Act, the company said in a regulatory filing.\n\nLGES will release detailed earnings on October 30. \n\nENERGY STORAGE, GEORGIA RAID\n\nLGES has tried to boost production of batteries for energy storage systems (ESS) to offset sluggish EV demand and improve profits in the second half of this year. \n\nThe company has signed a $4.3 billion deal to supply Tesla with energy storage system batteries, as the U.S. automaker looks to reduce reliance on Chinese imports due to tariffs. \n\nIn September, LGES suffered a setback with its joint battery factory with Hyundai Motor in the United States. Construction has been suspended in the wake of an immigration raid on the Georgia facility in early September that led to the arrest of hundreds of South Korean workers. \n\nHyundai Motor CEO Jose Munoz said last month the factory was facing a minimum startup delay of two to three months after the raid. \n\nLGES said early this month that it would gradually resume U.S. business trips for its employees and subcontractors, a day after the Trump administration agreed to allow South Koreans to work on equipment at U.S. sites under existing temporary visas.\n\n($1 = 1,429.9300 won)","summary":"","url":"https://www.channelnewsasia.com/business/lg-energy-solution-q3-profit-likely-up-34-us-ev-sales-rush-5397671","image":"https://dam.mediacorp.sg/image/upload/s--7Ym0vbpt--/c_fill,g_auto,h_338,w_600/fl_relative,g_south_east,l_mediacorp:cna:watermark:2024-04:reuters_1,w_0.1/f_auto,q_auto/v1/one-cms/core/2025-10-12T235437Z_1_LYNXNPEL9B0C9_RTROPTP_3_USA-SOUTHKOREA-MIGRATION-LG","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-10-12 23:54:37","author":null,"language":"en","source_country":"sg","sentiment":-0.776},{"id":368655054,"title":"Citadel’s move from Chicago ‘not hard,’ billionaire Ken Griffin says, citing crime and taxes","text":"Billionaire Ken Griffin said his hedge fund’s Chicago footprint will shrink to just two floors as crime, taxes and other challenges push employees to relocate to Miami and New York.\n\n“Chicago, you know, over the last, unfortunately, over the last six or seven years, has been engulfed in a series of problems,” Griffin said at the Citadel Securities Future of Global Markets conference in New York on Oct. 6. \n\nThe Windy City, which served as Citadel’s headquarters for more than 30 years, has seen much of the company’s workforce and operations shift south to Miami in recent years.\n\nGriffin, who is worth $50 billion according to Forbes, relocated his company’s global headquarters to Florida in 2022.\n\n“Asking people to leave Chicago for New York or Miami has not been hard.

Phase One of his proposal called for a ceasefire, Israeli military to withdraw to specific boundaries, and the release of Israeli hostages and Palestinian prisoners. Early Monday, Hamas is expected to release the surviving 20 hostages.\n\nSome of Trump’s supporters have called him the “peace president” for his international mediation efforts since taking office in January. Trump’s Israel-Hamas proposal marks the most substantial effort yet toward a lasting agreement, after earlier deals yielded only temporary cease-fires. The president has been applauded by Israelis and Palestinians on the matter, as well as world leaders.\n\nPresident Donald Trump walks up the stairs of Air Force One as he boards upon his arrival at Joint Base Andrews, Maryland, on October 12. (AP Photo/Luis M. Alvarez)\n\nWhat To Know\n\nOn Monday afternoon, world leaders will convene in Egypt’s Sinai Peninsula for an international summit titled “Sharm El-Sheikh Peace Summit,” the Egyptian president announced earlier this week.\n\nEl-Sisi noted that Trump and he will jointly chair the summit. The summit seeks to “end the war in the Gaza Strip, strengthen efforts to achieve peace and stability in the Middle East, and usher in a new era of regional security and stability,” the president’s website states.\n\nSince Hamas’ October 7 2023, attack on Israel, killing around 1,200 people and taking 251 hostages, Israel’s ground and air offensives in Gaza have displaced more than 2 million people and killed more than 67,600 Palestinians, according to the Associated Press.\n\nThe Egyptian president’s statement continued, explaining that “this summit comes in light of US President Donald Trump’s vision for achieving peace in the region and his relentless pursuit of ending conflicts around the world.”\n\nTrump will arrive in Egypt after speaking with the families of the soon-to-be released hostages on Monday morning, as well as addressing the Knesset.\n\nWho Is Expected to Attend?\n\nLeaders from around the world are expected to attend the summit, according to Egypt’s State Information Service, including: French President Emmanuel Macron; Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez, Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, Jordan’s King Abdullah II, Prime Minister of Kuwait Sheikh Ahmad Al-Abdullah Al-Ahmad Al-Sabah, Emir of Qatar Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani, and King of Bahrain Hamad bin Isa Al Khalifa, among others.\n\nSome leaders, including, United Kingdom Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer and the President of Azerbaijan, Ilham Aliyev, posted their arrivals to Egypt on social media, while other leaders have kept their movement more discrete. Some leaders have posted their appreciation for being invited to the historic summit online, such as Cypriot President Nikos Christodoulides.\n\nOther guests include United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Sultanate of Oman, the Secretary-General of the League of Arab States, the President of the European Council, the Minister of State for External Affairs of India, and the Ambassador of Japan to Cairo, according to Egypt’s State Information Service. \n\nEgypt invited Iran, but Tehran declined to send a representative, citing previous Israeli attacks on the country.\n\nWhat People Are Saying\n\nForeign Minister of Iran, Seyed Abbas Araghchi, said in a Sunday X post: “Iran is grateful for President El-Sisi’s invitation to attend the Sharm El-Sheikh Summit. While favoring diplomatic engagement, neither President Pezeshkian nor I can engage with counterparts who have attacked the Iranian People and continue to threaten and sanction us. Having said that, Iran welcomes any initiative that ends Israel’s Genocide in Gaza and ensures the expulsion of occupation forces. Palestinians are fully entitled to secure their fundamental right of self-determination, and all States remain obliged, more than ever, to assist them in their lawful & legitimate cause.”\n\nUK Prime Minister Keir Starmer wrote in an X post Sunday night: “I’m in Egypt, where I’ll meet with international leaders to mark the first, crucial step towards peace in the Middle East. The UK stands ready to support rebuilding Gaza and we will work with partners to secure a stable future for the region.”\n\nCypriot President Nikos Christodoulides wrote in an X post on Sunday: “I consider, taking into account also the fact that a limited number of states have been invited, the invitation as r...","summary":"President Donald Trump is set to co-chair a historic peace summit in Egypt following his visit to Israel on Monday.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/trump-to-co-chair-peace-summit-in-egypt-who-will-attend-10867644","image":"https://assets.newsweek.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/AP25285801987489.jpg?w=1600&h=900&q=88","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-10-12 23:41:12","author":"Mandy Taheri","authors":["Mandy Taheri"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.167},{"id":368657320,"title":"Trump starts week in Middle East, overseeing historic peace agreement","text":"President Donald Trump will spend the first part of the week in the Middle East to oversee a historic peace deal between Israel and Hamas, a landmark agreement expected to end the two-year war in Gaza and bring home the remaining hostages.

HAMAS ACCEPTS TRUMP PEACE PLAN ENDING 2 YEARS OF WAR IN GAZA, RETURNING HOSTAGES \"The war is over,\" Trump told reporters at Joint Base Andrews before boarding a nearly 12-hour flight to Israel. After landing in Tel Aviv, Trump is expected to meet with families of hostages and then give an address at the Knesset, Israel’s parliament, in Jerusalem. Trump will then travel to Egypt to attend an international summit in the seaside city of Sharm el-Sheikh on Monday to finalize an agreement aimed at ending the war in Gaza. More than 20 world leaders, including Trump, are expected to attend, an Egyptian presidential spokesperson said, according to Reuters. After a handful of hours in Israel and Egypt, Trump will board Air Force One and return to the White House in the early morning hours on Tuesday in order to honor the late Charlie Kirk with the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the nation’s highest civilian award. TRUMP PLANS WHIRLWIND TRIP TO ISRAEL AND EGYPT BEFORE RUSHING BACK TO WHITE HOUSE FOR CHARLIE KIRK HONOR \"It's a very quick trip, but I'll be making two major stops, and then I'll be on the plane trying to get back in time for Charlie,\" Trump told reporters at the White House on Friday. \"They're going to have a great celebration at the White House in the East Room,\" he added. The award ceremony coincides with what would have been Kirk’s 32nd birthday on Oct. 14. Kirk, the charismatic founder of Turning Point USA (TPUSA), gained recognition for his signature political debates on college campuses. He was assassinated on Sept. 10, during an outdoor event at Utah Valley University.

Prime Minister Keir Starmer as he prepares to join world leaders at a summit on Gaza co-chaired by Trump on Monday.\nIsrael’s deputy foreign minister Sharren Haskel also rejected Phillipson’s claim, hitting out at Britain’s recognition of Palestinian statehood, which she said risked emboldening Hamas.\nSpeaking to broadcasters earlier on Sunday, Phillipson, who is also running for the Labour deputy leadership, was questioned on the scope of Britain’s involvement in securing peace.\n“We have played a key role behind the scenes in shaping this, it’s right that we do so because it’s in all of our interests, including our own national interest, that we move to a lasting peace in the region,” she said.\n\nAsked what this contribution involved, she told Sky News’ Sunday Morning With Trevor Phillips: “These are complex matters of diplomacy that we are involved in.\n“But we do welcome and recognise the critical role that the American government played in getting us to this point.”\nOn Sunday afternoon, Haskel criticised the decision to recognise Palestinian statehood and accused Britain of diminishing the prospect of peace by emboldening Hamas.\n“The Government of the UK, [French President Emmanuel] Macron’s plan, the whole conversation about declaring a Palestinian state – we disagree with you,” she said.\nAsked about Phillipson’s characterisation of the UK’s efforts, the minister said: “Well, I have to contradict her words, unfortunately.\n“Unfortunately, with the declaration of the Palestinian state during a very sensitive time two months ago when the teams were already around the table negotiating, when we truly believe we are able to reach a deal, the message that the UK government sent Hamas was the message that the longer they continue this war, they will be rewarded.”\nThe UK joined countries including France, Australia and Canada last month in confirming recognition of Palestinian statehood in a historic, if largely symbolic, move leaders said was intended to safeguard the prospect of a two-state solution.\nStarmer will attend the “signing ceremony” for the Gaza peace plan in Sharm el-Sheikh in Egypt on Monday, where he is expected to heap

to ‘Calm Down’ or Cease to Exist","text":"Belarusian dictator and Kremlin puppet Alexander Lukashenko on Sunday warned that Ukraine may “disappear as a state,” he said in an online interview with Kremlin blogger Pavel Zarubin, saying that Zelensky needs to lead his country away from its desire to join the West, and “calm down” in terms of his requests to receive US long-range Tomahawk missiles.\n\nZelensky “needs to sit down and negotiate” and “act urgently” to bend to Kremlin demands, he said.\n\nThe Ukrainian president has had two talks in two days with US President Donald Trump, as Kremlin has been on edge about the potential of Kyiv receiving Tomahawks.\n\nIn his chat with the Kremlin propagandist, Lukashenko said he used to “blame European leaders and Europe for their inability to reach an agreement”, but in recent days, he has been supposedly receiving “a ton of information” that “the problem is not with the United States, which is very keen to move forward here, nor with Russia, which is ready to move forward, nor with European leaders, but rather with Volodymyr Zelensky”.\n\nThe self-describe Belarusian president said in his interview that he believes that “strong pressure” could be exerted on Zelensky by Moscow and others, and then “appropriate decisions will be made under this pressure”.\n\n“But actions must be taken urgently. Russia is advancing on the front line, and I say this responsibly, because I observe this every day, and it could lead to the disappearance of Ukraine as a state,” he said.\n\nHe added that Kyiv’s allies “see themselves in Ukraine’s west” and “are ready to take part of Ukraine, as was the case before the start of the Great Patriotic War”, referencing the Soviet term for World War II and alluding to Moscow’s propagandist talking points that its unprovoked invasion in 2022 was somehow the result of a “Nazi” conspiracy.\n\n“Therefore, the scenario is very serious,” he continued. “I would like Ukraine’s president to listen to my suggestions and understand that no one will bring happiness to Ukraine except the Slavic states, so it is necessary to sit down and negotiate.”\n\nHis assertions misrepresented the history of peace talks, as Kyiv has repeatedly made itself available for negotiations, but even Trump has made it clear that Moscow has been disingenuous about its desire to bring peace.\n\nCommenting on the possibility of the United States providing Ukraine with Tomahawk long-range missiles, Lukashenko said that “we need to calm down in this regard”.\n\n“Our friend [US President] Donald [Trump] has a certain tactic for dealing with the most pressing issues. That is why he sometimes puts pressure on the relevant authorities and people, sometimes acts more harshly, and then eases up a little and steps back. So we should not take it at face value that tomorrow it will all be launched,” Lukashenko added.","summary":"“Russia is advancing on the front line, and I say this responsibly… it could lead to the disappearance of Ukraine as a state,” the Belarusian dictator said.","url":"https://www.kyivpost.com/post/61939","image":"https://static.kyivpost.com/storage/2025/09/05/852686c30dca8ac1d93442fcf8a41a52.jpg?w=1200&q=90&f=jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-10-12 23:36:22","author":"Kyiv Post","authors":["Kyiv Post"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"ua","sentiment":-0.037},{"id":368650968,"title":"Gaza hostage release live updates: Hamas set to free Israeli hostages from October 7 attacks following Trump peace deal negotiations; US president travels to Middle East","text":"The actual release time remains unclear.

Trump rightly calls that a threat to throttle the entire global economy.\n\nYet China only has this power because we allow it.\n\nThe United States and its allies have ample supplies of everything China seems to monopolize; it’s simply a matter of restoring a US mining industry that actually led the world as recently as the early 1990s.\n\nThis does not require tossing environmental standards overboard, but rather cutting layers of red tape that only serve the green-extremist goal of shutting down new US mining — which ends up doing greater global environmental harm, since nations like China impose far fewer restrictions, and can’t be bothered to use the modern tech that minimizes environmental impacts.\n\nOn Monday, the Committee To Unleash Prosperity is releasing a landmark study laying out America’s vast mining potential: roughly $12 trillion in recoverable mineral resources, including hundreds of billions of dollars of critical and rare-earth minerals in in the mountains of Colorado, Montana, the Dakotas and Utah.\n\nMain study author Ned Mamula, a top geoscientist with decades of experience in these issues, just got confirmed last week as head of the US Geological Survey in the Interior Department, where he’ll no doubt spearhead part of Team Trump’s efforts to revive this vital industry.\n\nBut Congress needs to get in the act, too, undoing decades of restrictions that, for example, extend mine permitting up to a decade, three times what it takes in Canada. The nation also needs to reform a system that lets frivolous environmental lawsuits delay new projects.\n\nThanks to such barriers, few companies even try to find, let alone exploit, US mineral resources. But if we’re not to be at Beijing’s (and, to a lesser extent, Moscow’s) mercy, that’s got to change.\n\nMining this stuff at home will yield prices higher than importing it, but not prohibitively (raw materials costs are a minor part of any modern product’s final price) — and would mean restoring a huge domestic industry full of well-paid working-class jobs.\n\nAnd it would guarantee reliable access to minerals crucial to manufacturing industries old and new, including key defense needs.\n\nTurning this around won’t be easy: Not just domestic greens, but wealthy foreign interests, are guaranteed to spew out propaganda painting it as environmental rape.\n\nBut it’s vital to our economy and national security; anything else is unilateral surrender to the enemies of the West.","summary":"China only has this power because we allow it.","url":"https://nypost.com/2025/10/12/opinion/unleash-us-mining-now-to-face-down-chinas-deadly-trade-threats/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/10/2025-second-day-us-presidents-111706838-e1760308855107.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-10-12 23:30:34","author":"Post Editorial Board","authors":["Post Editorial Board"],"language":"en","source_country":"zm","sentiment":-0.184},{"id":368655956,"title":"Welcome To St. eter's Basilica, Notice There's No 'P' in It?

Maxwell, who was handed down a 20-year sentence in 2022, has the fourth-longest remaining sentence out of the prison’s 600 inmates.\n\nIt was not known who Maxwell met with in the chapel that day, though some of her fellow inmates heard rumors that the lockdown was meant to accommodate important visitors, according to the report. \n\nLater that day, one inmate said they saw Maxwell return to her dormitory with a smile on her face. When asked about her mysterious meeting, Maxwell said it went well, but didn’t share any other information, according to the report. \n\nMeanwhile, less than a week later, the Justice Department released a transcript of an interview Maxwell had with senior official Todd Blanche weeks earlier in July. \n\nDuring the interview with Blanche, Maxwell said she had never seen President Donald Trump doing anything inappropriate or illegal with Epstein when they were friends. Soon after, she was transferred to Federal Prison Camp Bryan. \n\nAt the time, Maxwell’s lawyer, David Markus, wrote on X that the transfer was for safety reasons and came after she “faced serious danger in Tallahassee.” It was not immediately clear what kinds of safety concerns she had faced at the higher-security prison. \n\nIn addition to causing some minor inconveniences for the other inmates, Maxwell was also greeted with a wave of hostility from some. According to the report, fellow prisoners taunted her, calling her a pedophile and a “chomo” – a prison slur for child molester.\n\nDuring one incident, Maxwell had politely asked an inmate to leave her room, prompting the other woman to begin screaming at Maxwell that she didn’t belong there. The inmate was then transferred to another dormitory, the report says.\n\nSoon after, the warden organized a “town hall” and warned that if inmates made threats to Maxwell, put her in danger or talked to the press about her, they would be taken to a harsher facility, sources told The Journal. \n\nMeanwhile, inmates told The Journal that Maxwell mostly kept to herself, especially as there was a media frenzy soon after her transfer. Still, she reportedly received preferential treatment, as guards would bring her meals to her dormitory or escort her to the recreation area for late-night workouts. Maxwell was also allowed to shower after other inmates were confined to their bunks, according to the report. \n\nSoon after her arrival, the prison also stationed armed special operations response teams, known as SORT, at the camp’s entrance and rear gate, and kept them there around the clock. \n\nAccording to the inmates, once prison officials added a black tarp to block the view out of the camp, Maxwell went outside more. \n\nWith that addition, she also began getting her hair cut and colored at the prison-run salon, and visiting the cafeteria, though she would give away her vegetarian meals, claiming she couldn’t eat the food, one inmate told The Journal. \n\nHer lawyer, Markus, declined to comment on the report to the Journal. A spokesperson for the Justice Department, which oversees the Bureau of Prisons, also declined to comment. \n\nNews of Maxwell’s mysterious meeting comes as the Supreme Court on Monday denied her appeal after asking the nation’s highest court to review her case.\n\nAfter the ruling, Trump was asked if he would consider pardoning Maxwell, to which he replied: “I’d have to take a look at it.” \n\nHe then said he would have to “speak to the DOJ” and stressed that he did not know “anything” about the matter, despite the case dominating headlines for months after a bipartisan effort to force the release of case files from the Justice Department’s attempt to prosecute Epstein.","summary":"Maxwell had a mysterious meeting in the prison’s chapel that prevented other inmates from getting their outdoor time, per the report","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/ghislaine-maxwell-texas-prison-camp-report-b2844071.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/08/06/23/53/Ghislaine-MaxwellByran-prison.jpeg?crop=747,498,x1.5,y0&trim=0,1,0,1&width=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/mMYfawAf-OhrQWqOm.mp4","publish_date":"2025-10-12 23:29:58","author":"Isabel Keane","authors":["Isabel Keane"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.537},{"id":368652306,"title":"Warden at Maxwell’s cushy Texas prison camp warned other inmates not to bully her - or risk being moved to harsher facility, report says","text":"Ghislaine Maxwell’s unexpected arrival at a cushy Texas prison this August has left other inmates unsettled, with some claiming it seems that she receives preferential treatment, according to a report.\n\nMaxwell’s arrival at Bryan Federal Prison Camp, a minimum-security facility known for its relatively relaxed environment, has drastically disrupted the daily lives of her fellow inmates, The Wall Street Journal reports. \n\nOn a weekend in mid-August, not long after her arrival, inmates at the prison were forced to stay indoors during their usual outdoor time as Maxwell met with several visitors in the prison camp’s chapel, people familiar with the matter told The Journal.\n\nThe arrival of the 63-year-old former associate of Jeffrey Epstein, convicted of trafficking underage girls for the deceased financier, has led to more frequent lockdowns, more armed guards on campus and other changes at the prison, according to the report.\n\nCurrent and former inmates at the usually docile prison — also the home of Theranos founder Elizabeth Holmes and Real Housewives of Salt Lake City star Jen Shah — said it seemed that Maxwell has been receiving better treatment than other inmates.\n\nA majority of the inmates held there have committed white-collar crimes and face shorter sentences, or have served a larger portion of a longer sentence and are considered a low flight risk.\n\nBecause of this, Federal Prison Camp Bryan is known as being relatively low-security, without any towering fences, barbed wire or high-security cells found at more strict facilities.\n\nThe Bureau of Prisons typically prohibits sex offenders from serving time in such prisons, though they can be admitted with a special waiver, according to the report.

That when the hostages cross back into Israel it will usher in a new era – and that finally this nightmare that began with the largest slaughter of Jews since the Holocaust and led, unfathomably, to an explosion in anti-Semitism across the world, is coming to an end.\n\n‘Cautiously happy’ is how 37-year-old Inbar Goldstein summed up the mood to the Daily Mail in Hostages Square yesterday.\n\nHer 19-year-old niece, Agam Goldstein-Almog, was freed from captivity nearly two months after the terror attack having seen her father and sister killed in her kibbutz.\n\n‘We are headed towards different kinds of tears – happy tears, sad, worried, frightened tears,’ she said.\n\n‘It kind of feels like we had small endings during the past two years, so now it’s kind of the grand finale hopefully.’\n\nWhile 20 living hostages are expected to be returned from 6am local time today, there are concerns some of the 28 dead may not be found.\n\n‘Only when they are returned, only then will we have certainty and be able to move on with our lives,’ said Udi Goren, who is waiting for the return of his cousin Tal Haimi’s body.\n\n‘Until then we are stuck on October 7.’\n\nHundreds of notes hang from a tent in Hostages Square written for those freed to read when they come home. \n\nGilad Katz, 40, visited with his nine-year-old daughter Lia and she left a message saying she ‘hopes that they will come back happy’.\n\nMr Katz said it felt ‘important’ to bring his child, telling us: ‘For the last two years, we’ve all been looking forward to this moment. Looking forward to seeing everyone come home and to bring some level of closure for all the families.’\n\nAnother note summed up the feelings of many with the words: ‘Welcome home – I’m so sorry Israel left you there so long.’\n\nMelancholic piano music drifted through the square on a calm Mediterranean breeze as Israelis heeded the call of Idit Ohel to play the instruments in honour of her son, Alon, a talented pianist who is due back today.\n\nAs well as poignant reflections on the pain of the last two years, there is also unbridled joy from those who have done so much to free the hostages. \n\nMenachem Rosenberg, who volunteered with the Hostages Forum travelling the world to campaign with them, was seen posing with a Donald Trump impersonator.\n\n‘There’s this term in Hebrew – Asak. It’s end of course vibes,’ he joked. ‘Wow.

I said, I’ll have to wait till I get back. I am doing another one. Because I am good at solving wars,” Trump told reporters aboard Air Force One.“Think about India, Pakistan. Think about some of the wars that were going on for years. We had one going for 31, one going for 32, one going for 37 years, with millions of people being killed in every country, and I got every one of those done, for the most part, within a day. It’s pretty good…,” he added.Trump also spoke about the Nobel Peace prize, stating, “It’s an honour to do it. I saved millions of lives. In all fairness to the Nobel committee, it was for 2024. This was picked for 2024. But there are those who say you could make an exception because a lot of things happened during 2025 that are done and complete and great. But I did not do this for the Nobel. I did this for saving lives.”He further claimed that he resolved some conflicts using economic measures, including trade and tariffs.“I settled a few of the wars just based on tariffs. For example, between India and Pakistan, I said, if you guys want to fight a war and you have nuclear weapons, I am going to put big tariffs on you both, like 100 per cent, 150 per cent, and 200 per cent. I said I am putting tariffs. I had that thing settled in 24 hours. If I didn’t have tariffs, you could have never settled that war,” Trump added.However, New Delhi has consistently rejected the notion that the United States intervened in Operation Sindoor or the resulting ceasefire with Pakistan. Since the ceasefire was announced following Operation Sindoor in May 2025, Trump has repeatedly asserted that he was instrumental in halting the India‑Pakistan conflict - often attributing this to his use of trade and tariffs as leverage.India maintains that the decision to pause hostilities was reached via direct talks between the two sides’ military leadership, without third-party mediation. Prime Minister Narendra Modi has categorically stated in Parliament that no country asked India to halt its counter‑terror operation. The ministry of external affairs has affirmed that trade or tariff negotiations with the US had nothing to do with Operation Sindoor. The conflict was triggered after a dastardly terror attack on April 22 in Jammu and Kashmir’s Pahalgam, which claimed 26 lives, mostly tourists. Backed by groups believed to be from across the border. In response, on May 7, India launched Operation Sindoor, striking multiple terrorist camps in Pakistan‑occupied Kashmir (PoK) and Pakistan. A ceasefire was announced on May 10, after direct dialogue between the directors general of military operations (DGMOs) of both countries, on request of Pakistani DGMO.The remarks come as Trump embarks on a Middle East trip, to mark the Gaza ceasefire and hostage release deal. He will also co-chair the Gaza peace saummit along with his Egyptian counterpart President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi.","summary":"US President Trump claimed he resolved numerous long-standing global conflicts, including India-Pakistan disputes, by leveraging economic measures like tariffs.

Meanwhile, US President Donald Trump has warned Russian President Vladimir Putin, saying that he would send long-range Tomahawk missiles to Ukraine if the war is not settled. Trump's warning has raised concerns about further escalation in the Russia-Ukraine conflict. During a conversation with reporters aboard Air Force One, Trump hinted at the possibility of sending Tomahawk missiles to Ukraine if the conflict is not resolved soon. \"I might say, 'Look: if this war is not going to get settled, I'm going to send them Tomahawks,'\" Trump said. He emphasized the potency of the Tomahawk missile, describing it as an \"incredible weapon, very offensive.\" Trump also mentioned that he had discussed the possibility of sending Tomahawks with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy during their phone call.In the meantime, Russia has expressed extreme concern over the deployment of Tomahawk missiles to Ukraine. Putin has previously warned that such a move would seriously damage relations between Moscow and Washington. \"Do they want to have Tomahawks going in that direction? I don't think so,\" Trump said, pressing on Russia's concerns.On the other hand, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy described his conversation with Trump as a very productive one. Zelenskyy emphasised the need for strengthening Ukraine's air defence, resilience, and long-range capabilities. He also discussed details related to the energy sector, which has been severely impacted by Russia's attacks on Ukraine's power grid.Donald Trump's recent comments were seen as another major shift in his stance on the Ukraine conflict. Last month, Trump expressed confidence that Ukraine could win back all the territory lost to Russia, a departure from his previous calls for Kyiv to make concessions to end the war. However, Trump has so far resisted Zelenskyy's requests for Tomahawk missiles.Meanwhile, the possible deployment of Tomahawk missiles to Ukraine has raised concerns in Russia and fears of a more intense war. The experts suggested that the missiles would enable Ukraine to strike deeper into Russian territory, putting pressure on Putin to engage in peace talks. However, it could also escalate the conflict and lead to further retaliation from Russia.","summary":"US President Trump considers sending Tomahawk missiles to Ukraine if the conflict isn&#39;t resolved soon, raising concerns about possible escalation and Russian retaliation.","url":"https://www.republicworld.com/world-news/trump-warns-putin-threatens-to-send-tomahawk-missiles-to-ukraine-if-conflict-isn-t-resolved","image":"https://img.republicworld.com/all_images/trump-warns-putin-threatens-to-send-tomahawk-missiles-to-ukraine-if-conflict-isn-t-resolved-1760310649702-16_9.webp","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-10-12 23:10:55","author":"Abhishek Tiwari","authors":["Abhishek Tiwari"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"in","sentiment":-0.287},{"id":368648882,"title":"Inside the alcohol industry’s global campaign to delay Ireland’s world-first health labels","text":"We need your help now\n\nSupport from readers like you keeps The Journal open.\n\nYou are visiting us because we have something you value.

The message would simply read: “There is a direct link between alcohol and fatal cancers.”\n\nAfter years of wrangling with Brussels, the plan finally received EU clearance in 2023 and was due to take effect in 2026.\n\nBut in July this year, the Government quietly postponed the measure until 2028 – a full decade after it was first announced.\n\nNow, documents obtained under the Freedom of Information (FOI) Act reveal exactly how that delay was won.\n\nThey show a concerted lobbying campaign by some of the world’s largest alcohol producers, drawing in senior Irish ministers, EU trade officials and even White House advisors.\n\nIndustry correspondence, briefing notes and US lobbying disclosures – compiled as part of a collaborative investigation by The Journal Investigates, Belgian newspaper De Tijd and Dutch platform Follow The Money – reveal a transatlantic strategy to thwart Ireland’s public health plans.\n\nThat included weaponising trade threats, leveraging Brussels bureaucracy and using scientific conclusions that have been criticised to downplay alcohol’s cancer risks.\n\nCancer warning labels on all alcoholic drinks sold in the State have been deferred to 2028.Alamy Stock Photo\n\nAlamy Stock Photo\n\nInvestigations like this don’t happen without your support… Impactful investigative reporting is powered by people like you.\n\nSupport The Journal Investigates\n\nUS urged Ireland to pull cancer labels\n\nThe alcohol industry’s lobbying intensified on both sides of the Atlantic this year, internal government documents obtained under FOI reveal.\n\nAccording to the US Congressional lobbying register, beer giant Heineken and European brewer AB InBev – makers of Budweiser, Corona and a number of well known brands – both held meetings with the US Trade Representative (USTR).\n\nThe documents state these meetings concerned “issues relating to tariffs on imported goods”. It is unclear, due to the limited information available on the register, whether Irish legislative issues were discussed.\n\nThe register shows law firm Squire Patton Boggs, representing Heineken, met in early 2025 with USTR officials, as well as officials at the White House, to discuss “general trade issues impacting the beer industry”.\n\nAgain, it is unclear, due to the limited information on the records, whether this included issues on Ireland’s upcoming alcohol legislation implementation.\n\nA USTR report released earlier this year reveals that the US government previously pressed Ireland to abandon the health warning labels after consulting with alcohol producers.\n\nThe report states it raised “procedural concerns” about the regulation in March 2024 to the World Trade Organization Technical Barriers to Trade Committee, describing it as a “barrier to trade”.\n\nIt adds that the US industry has “raised concerns that unique labeling [sic] requirements for the Irish market… would be costly and [might] disrupt U.S. exports within the EU single market”.\n\nAs far back as 2018, when Ireland’s proposals were first announced, Heineken outlined its opposition to then Health Minister Simon Harris.\n\nIn a letter sent to Harris, Heineken expressed its worry that the law would “seriously damage” the reputation of its beer brand.\n\nIts corporate affairs director warned that the measure would also make Ireland “less attractive for investment from large global players” and “impact production [and] innovation” of the company in Ireland.\n\nIn a statement to our team, Heineken said it takes responsible alcohol consumption “seriously” and provides “easily accessible and transparent” information to customers.\n\n“In addition to the information on our packaging, our products also include a QR code that allows consumers to access additional information about alcohol and health,” a spokesperson said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n“This information aligns with the conclusions of a comprehensive review of scientific studies on alcohol and health, published last December by the US National Academy of Science, Engineering, and Medicine.”\n\nThe beer giant added that it is an active member of key industry bodies, including Drinks Ireland, and engages with various “stakeholders” both nationally and at an EU level, to ensure that policy is developed in a “balanced and well-informed manner”.\n\nDespite numerous requests for comment, AB InBev failed to respond.\n\nUS President Donald Trump announces Reciprocal Tariffs in the garden of the White House in April 2025.Alamy Stock Photo\n\nAlamy Stock Photo\n\nClosed door meeting with the Taoiseach\n\nOn home shores, in the first months of 2025, there were seven closed-door meetings between Big Alcohol reps and the Irish government.\n\nThese meetings mostly surrounded trade tariff fears, however the issue of alcohol labelling was also a talking point.\n\nIn April, Drinks Ireland – the industry trade group representing international brands such as Guinness and Heineken – secured a face-to-face meeting with the Taoiseach.\n\nAccording to internal meeting notes obtained by our investigation team, the group stressed the hardship faced by the sector because of the Trump tariffs, and were “seeking delay” in the rollout of the health warnings.\n\nIn making their case, Drinks Ireland invoked the fact that the cancer warnings were opposed by the Trump administration. \n\nWhen contacted, Drinks Ireland did not directly comment on its meeting with the Taoiseach, or communications with government departments.\n\nHowever, a spokesperson for the group said the proposed legislation was “cited internationally as a non-tariff barrier to trade at a time when Irish businesses need a fair, supportive and positive trading relationship with their markets”.\n\nAsked about the April meeting, a spokesperson for the Taoiseach said it was “one of many undertaken by the Taoiseach and other Ministers” with different business groups and investors in relation to “trade developments”.\n\nWe also asked the Department of Health about the government’s decision to postpone the first-of-its-kind legislation.\n\nA spokesperson said: “The Regulations were previously designed to come into operation in 2026. In accordance with the Government Decision, the Regulations will now come into operation in 2028.”\n\nTaoiseach Micheál Martin met with industry group Drinks Ireland three months before cancer warning labels on alcoholic drinks were postponed.rollingnew.ie\n\nrollingnew.ie\n\nWarnings described as ‘fearmongering’\n\nThe tactics used by the alcohol industry to resist the cancer warning labels went far beyond economic arguments, documents reveal.\n\nWhen first announced, Ireland’s proposals went further than EU labelling, which meant Brussels would have to sign off on the legislation.\n\nFearing the Irish position would set a European precedent, ‘Big Alcohol’ lobbied the EU hard.\n\nIn 2022, Drinks Ireland submitted a position paper with the European Commission, which stated the proposed Irish health warnings were “fearmongering” and “misinformation”.\n\nThe group commissioned a report from Gradient, a US consultancy which has been criticised in the past over reports disputing research on health risks associated with controversial industries such as asbestos and fossil fuels.\n\nIts lead toxicologist, Dr Julie Goodman, previously authored work claiming there were reduced health risks associated with“ light” cigarettes produced by Philip Morris, and argued that there was a “safe dose” of asbestos.\n\nIn the commissioned report, Goodman argued there was “no consistent association” between moderate drinking and cancer risk, except in a few cases where the risks were “very small”.\n\nGoodman’s conclusion was criticised by Dr Carina Ferreira-Borges, a senior policy expert at the World Health Organization (WHO) Europe, who described Goodman’s claims as “very misleading”.\n\nThere is “indisputable evidence” that alcohol, even in moderation, can cause several types of cancer, said Ferreira-Borges.\n\nWHO research shows that one third of alcohol-related breast cancer cases occur in women who drink no more than two small glasses of wine a day.\n\nHealth policy specialist Dr Luc Hagenaars of Amsterdam University Medical Center said that Goodman’s paper for Drinks Ireland was a “well-known strategy” in the lobbying playbook of industry more broadly.\n\nThe Journal Investigates is dedicated to lifting the lid on how Ireland works.

But the harm is clear.\n\nAccording to WHO, Ireland has among the highest alcohol consumption rates in Europe, with more than 5,000 deaths per year attributable to drink, from liver disease to road accidents.\n\nWHO unequivocally states that, relating to cancer, there is no safe level of alcohol consumption.\n\n“This isn’t just a delay; we fear it could lead to the proposal being derailed altogether,” said Sheila Gilheany, director of Alcohol Action Ireland.\n\n“To get an EU-wide label would take forever. There’s currently no plan on the table for such warning labels. And if there were, it would probably be very much watered down.”\n\nWhen Ireland first proposed its law, it fitted well with Brussels flagship Beating Cancer Plan.\n\nIn early drafts, the European Parliament called for sports sponsorship bans and mandatory health warnings. But after heavy lobbying, those commitments were watered down.\n\nToday, the Commission talks vaguely of “evidence gathering”, but specific deadlines for cancer warnings have disappeared from its roadmap.\n\nInstead, officials are leaning towards QR codes, digital images scanned by mobile devices which link to online nutritional and health information.\n\nBut research shows that almost nobody scans them. In one 14-country study, only 0.26% of shoppers actually used a code on packaging.\n\n“People don’t engage with QR codes, unless they have an incentive,” said Dr Ferreira-Borges. “It’s unrealistic to expect consumers to scan a label in the supermarket and look up health information online.”\n\nReporter: Patricia Devlin • Editor (Ireland): Maria Delaney • Social Media: Cliodhna Travers\n\nThis investigation is part of a collaboration with The Journal Investigates, Belgian newspaper De Tijd and Dutch platform Follow The Money.

This is not something that we’re looking forward to, but the Democrats have dealt us a pretty difficult set of cards.”\nLabour unions have already filed a lawsuit to stop the aggressive move by US President Donald Trump’s budget office, which goes far beyond what usually happens in a government shutdown, further inflaming tensions between the Republicans who control Congress and the Democratic minority.\nThe shutdown began on October 1 after Democrats rejected a short-term funding fix and demanded that the bill include an extension of federal subsidies for health insurance under the Affordable Care Act.\nThe expiration of those subsidies at the end of the year will result in monthly cost increases for millions.\n\nTrump and Republican leaders have said they are open to negotiations on the health subsidies but insist the government must reopen first.\nFor now, negotiations are virtually nonexistent. Dug in as ever, House leaders from both parties pointed fingers at each other in rival Sunday appearances on Fox News Sunday.\n“We have repeatedly made clear that we will sit down with anyone, anytime, any place,” said House Democratic leader Hakeem Jeffries of New York.\n“Republicans control the House, the Senate and the presidency. It’s unfortunate they’ve taken a my-way-or-the-highway approach.”\nHouse Speaker Mike Johnson blamed Democrats and said they “seem not to care” about the pain the shutdown is inflicting.\n“They’re trying their best to distract the American people from the simple fact that they’ve chosen a partisan fight so that they can prove to their Marxist rising base in the Democratic Party that they’re willing to fight Trump and Republicans,” he said.\nProgressive activists, meanwhile, expressed new support for the Democratic Party’s position in the shutdown fight.\n\nEzra Levin, co-founder of the leading progressive protest group Indivisible, said he is “feeling good about the strength of the Dem position”.\nHe pointed to fractures in the Republican Party, noting that Georgia congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene publicly warned last week that healthcare insurance premiums would skyrocket for average Americans – including her own adult children – if nothing is done.\n“Trump and GOP (the Republican Party) are rightfully taking the blame for the shutdown and for looming premium increases,” Levin said. “Their chickens are coming home to roost.”\nAnd yet the Republican administration and its congressional allies are showing no signs of caving to Democratic demands or backing away from threats to use the opportunity to pursue deeper cuts to the federal workforce.\nThousands of employees at the departments of Education, Treasury, Homeland Security and Health and Human Services, as well as the Environmental Protection Agency, are set to receive termination notices, according to spokespeople for the agencies and union representatives for federal workers.\n“You hear a lot of Senate Democrats say, well, how can Donald Trump possibly lay off all of these federal workers?” Vance said. “Well, the Democrats have given us a choice between giving low-income women their food benefits and paying our troops on the one hand, and, on the other hand, paying federal bureaucrats.”\nDemocrats say the firings are illegal and unnecessary.\n“They do not have to do this,” said Democratic Senator Mark Kelly of Arizona on CNN’s State of the Union. “They do not have to punish people that shouldn’t find themselves in this position.”","summary":"US Vice-President J.D.

The Communists were effectively wiped out, failing to cross the 5% threshold needed for seats in the Chamber of Deputies. \n\nNearly two dozen other parties joined them in electoral oblivion. \n\nIn the end, there was no grand surprise. The elections played out largely as pollsters had predicted. \n\nFor many Czechs, that was a relief: The feared surge of far-left and far-right extremism never came. \n\nYet beneath this surface, the results tell a more troubling story. \n\nThey produced no decisive winner. The party that gained the largest vote share, ANO, is not so much an outfit animated by some lofty ideology as a vehicle for one man’s ambitions. \n\nAndrej Babiš, a Slovak-born billionaire who served as prime minister from 2017 to 2021, calls himself a Czech-first nationalist. \n\nHis rivals decry him as a soft-on-Russia populist whose comeback will undermine Czech support for Ukraine. \n\nThis is an oversimplification. Babiš’s politics are not doctrinal; they are transactional.\n\nDuring Donald Trump’s first presidency, Babiš sported a red baseball cap modeled on MAGA emblazed with the slogan “Strong Czechia.” \n\nHe relished being called the “Czech Trump” and boasted about meeting the man on multiple occasions. \n\nAfter Trump’s 2020 defeat, however, Babiš swiftly discarded the MAGA imagery. \n\nUnlike, say, Hungary’s Viktor Orbán, Babiš isn’t a card-carrying populist conservative. \n\nHe was left-leaning liberal when it was fashionable. \n\nOn the campaign trail, he even rejected Trump’s call for NATO nations to raise defense spending to 5% of gross domestic product.\n\nBabiš’s real instinct is for grievance politics. \n\nHe saw how inflation, tax hikes, energy costs and austerity are squeezing ordinary Czechs as their government pours money into helping Ukraine. \n\nBy asking why Czechs were paying for someone else’s war, he tapped into an unspoken resentment. \n\nBrussels may sneer, but the message resonated across small towns and rural regions.\n\nHis promises were broad: more cash for pensioners, tax cuts, higher wages, reduced energy tariffs. \n\nStill, even with all the giveaways, Babiš fell short of an outright majority. \n\nHis party secured 80 of 200 seats — 21 short of the number required to form a majority government. \n\nCzech politics is now splintered among competing factions.\n\nBabiš must somehow build a working majority. His likeliest partners are two right-wing parties: Motorists for Themselves and Freedom and Direct Democracy (SPD). \n\nMotorists, a newcomer forged in opposition to Europe’s green agenda and cycle lanes, won 13 seats. \n\nSPD, led by the Japan-born Tomio Okamura, is virulently anti-European Union, anti-migrant and anti-NATO. These positions terrify Czech moderates and businesspeople.\n\nComplicating things further, Babiš still faces a long-running fraud trial over EU farm subsidies, and conflict-of-interest laws may force him to relinquish control of his sprawling business empire. \n\nBut those who know him are certain he’ll find a way to keep his business and run the country — if not directly as prime minister, then as puppet master to a hand-picked proxy.\n\nBut what of Ukraine? Despite campaign bluster, Babiš is unlikely to abandon Kyiv. \n\nCzech arms factories have prospered from supplying Ukraine, and public sympathy for Ukrainians — hundreds of thousands of whom have sought refuge in Czechia, which houses the most Ukrainian refugees per capita in the EU — remains formidable. \n\nIn the campaign’s final days, Babiš was forced to dilute his Ukraine rhetoric. \n\nHe may make occasional noises, but there will be little real change in policy. \n\nThat’s good news for the West, especially Ukraine and the United States.\n\nThe elections’ deeper lesson is something Americans know all too well. \n\nThe Czech electorate turned away from politicians who promised stability and progress but delivered economic hardship and cultural condescension. \n\nBabiš’s comeback is another reminder voters everywhere are turning not to ideology but to whoever seems to listen.\n\nBut governing is a different game from campaigning. \n\nWith no clear majority and no easy allies, Babiš will have to temper his populist rhetoric with responsible governance. \n\nCzech democracy has weathered another test, but tougher trials lie ahead. \n\nThirty-five years after the Velvet Revolution peacefully ended Communist rule, the most urgent question in Czechia is whether the country’s politics can still deliver — besides a government — a sense of common purpose to unite a fractured nation. \n\nHow Babiš meets that challenge, as he struggles to form a coalition in the weeks ahead, should concern more than just Czechs and Europeans. \n\nWashington ought to be watching too.","summary":"When citizens of the Czech Republic voted in their country’s crucial parliamentary elections last weekend, they were deciding more than their own democracy’s future.

Elsewhere, a Chicago alderperson was roughed up and handcuffed when she asked ICE agents whether they had a warrant to make arrests at a community clinic.\nNow that a Customs and Border Protection agent has shot a woman in another part of the city, everyone holds their breath when black SUVs pass. Children I know are afraid to go out, even though they are not undocumented.\nChicago is just the most recent Democratic-run city to experience this state-initiated violence. For all the media coverage of National Guard deployments, it is worth underscoring how much terror immigration agents alone can incite. Los Angeles, Washington, and Portland have had similar experiences. Other cities will soon join the list.\nThe militarisation of American cities – apparently selected because of their partisan divergence from the White House – represents a failure of federalism, the constitutional arrangement by which America’s national and subnational governments are supposed to be distinct. The point of creating two constitutionally separate layers of government was to create a healthy diversity of political environments, which in turn helps foster democracy.\nOf course, there have long been tensions between the federal government and the states, most recently during the Civil Rights Movement of the 1950s and 1960s.\nBut whereas federal deployments in that era were intended to safeguard rights, federal forces today are being unleashed to spread fear and inflict losses on citizens and non-citizens alike.\nNor is this the only way that federal-state relations are eroding. In recent days, the Donald Trump administration has withheld funds for transport repairs in New York City and Chicago.\nWhile the government claims that such funds might be used for “DEI principles” (building roads in majority Black neighbourhoods, perhaps, is now a sign of discrimination?), the real motive is obvious: To turn every level of federal power into an instrument of political repression against non-aligned states.\nThis breakdown of American federalism should concern everyone. When a large and diverse country like the US starts to experience geographic fissures, and when large slices of the public start to believe (perhaps reasonably) that their relationship with the centre is all “take” and no “give,” a sense of fear and foreboding is justified.\nAmericans are already more likely than not to believe that their national political system is irretrievably broken, and this administration’s actions are only deepening these sentiments.\nBut the breakdown of American federalism flows from another structural failure of American constitutionalism: the effective collapse of the separation of powers. Partisan-aligned majorities in Congress and in the Supreme Court have increasingly abdicated their constitutional responsibilities.\nWhile the unwillingness of legislators, mostly Republican, to oppose the administration, even when it acts plainly unlawfully or in profoundly harmful ways, is a familiar issue, the Supreme Court’s responsibility for the collapse of the separation of powers (and hence also federalism) is less well understood.\nUntil recently, the Court, led by Chief Justice John Roberts, was fully committed to protecting the states from federal overreach. That is why it invalidated the Affordable Care Act’s mandatory expansion of Medicaid in 2012.\nBut now, the Court is largely ignoring federalism and making dramatic changes to the separation of powers. The result is a central government that looks very different from the Congress-centred model envisioned by America’s founders.\nThe Court’s recent interventions have not only shielded the executive branch from the force of legal constraints that might act as a check on state violence, but also permitted its misuse of fiscal powers. The Court’s 2024 decision on presidential immunity, most notably, has dramatically limited the force of criminal prohibitions on presidential power.\nAs I explain in a forthcoming academic study, while the immunity decision formally applies only to the president, it functionally applies to many other executive branch officials.\nFor example, it bars the use of evidence of presidential communications from any prosecution, and it eliminates subordinates’ long-standing ability to object to orders that may violate a criminal statute.\nThese risks are not hypothetical. The Trump administration has cited the Court’s immunity decision endlessly in briefs touching on a wide variety of cases. In this justice department’s hands, the ruling is not an articulation of constitutional doctrine but a permission slip to “do as we please”.\nSecond, over the last eight months, the Court has issued those permission slips. It has granted some 21 of the 23 Trump administration requests for emergency relief, setting aside lower court orders in cases involving refusals to spend money (albeit in non-federalism domains) or to fire personnel (which involves not spending money). In doing so, the justices have granted the executive branch broad permission to wield fiscal resources as a club against political and ideological foes.\nThese decisions have unraveled the separation of powers in vital areas; and now, the Court’s licensing of untrammeled presidential power, regardless of law, is hitting the states hard.\nThe executive is operating with little to no regard for Congress’s decisions about what is criminal, or about how money should be spent. The states find themselves on the front lines, because they are often staging grounds for Trump’s political foes as well as essential partners in a host of health, education, security, and regulatory programmes.\nPerhaps Trump would have pursued these policies even without Supreme Court prompting. But I am skeptical. The Court’s general “have-at-it” approach is one of the big differences between Trump’s first term and this one.\nAnd the effects of this breakdown will continue to trickle down in the form of smoke grenades, masked men in unmarked cars yanking people off the streets, and a miasma of fear and anger that is unlikely to dissipate any time soon.\n\nAziz Huq is professor of law at the University of Chicago.\nThe views expressed are those of the writer and do not necessarily reflect those of FMT.","summary":"The Supreme Court’s recent interventions have not only shielded the executive branch from the force of legal constraints that might act as a check on state violence, but also permitted its misuse of fiscal powers.","url":"https://www.freemalaysiatoday.com/category/opinion/2025/10/13/how-the-supreme-court-unleashed-trumps-war-on-the-states","image":"https://www.freemalaysiatoday.com/cdn-cgi/image/quality=75,format=auto,fit=scale-down,dpr=1,width=1600,height=1000/https://media.freemalaysiatoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/8fb97632-us-supreme-court-epaimages-121025.webp","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-10-12 23:00:13","author":"Aziz Huq","authors":["Aziz Huq"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"my","sentiment":-0.055},{"id":368657946,"title":"Japan may soon get its first female leader. Why hasn’t the US?","text":"Survey Says is a weekly series rounding up the most important polling trends or data points you need to know about, plus a vibe check on a trend that’s driving politics or culture.\n\nJapan is expected to soon break ground that the United States has so far left intact. By mid-October, the East Asian country could be led by a woman.\n\nSanae Takaichi was elected on Oct. 4 to lead the Liberal Democratic Party, the right-wing governing party of Japan’s coalition government. For Takaichi to replace current Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba, who is resigning, she will need to win a vote in the country’s legislature. That is expected to happen, but some hurdles remain.\n\nIf Takaichi becomes the next prime minister, Japan would become the 50th democracy led by a woman since the end of World War II. Meanwhile, the U.S. would then become one of only 20 that has kept women out of national leadership.\n\nDaily Kos reviewed data from the Council on Foreign Relations on the history of elected or appointed female heads of state and government, among United Nations member nations, since the beginning of 1946. Daily Kos updated CFR’s data, which dated to Aug. 7, to be current as of this past Tuesday. Our analysis focuses only on nations that rank as a “flawed democracy” or better on the Economist Intelligence Group’s 2024 democracy index.\n\nThe U.S. position is even more stark among its economic peers, according to Daily Kos’ analysis.\n\nSince the end of World War II, 35 high-income democracies—defined by the World Bank as those with a gross national income of at least $13,935 per capita—have had a female head of state or government. If Takaichi ascends to the role of prime minister, Japan would become the 36th, leaving the U.S. as one of just eight led exclusively by men since 1946.\n\nBut what exactly is holding the U.S. back? \n\nSexism is no doubt a big reason. Forty percent of voters say they personally know someone who wouldn’t vote for a female presidential candidate, and 18% openly admit they themselves aren’t open to casting their presidential vote for a qualified woman. Nearly 80% of Americans blame gender discrimination for why there have been fewer women than men in higher office. \n\nSociety also encourages men more than women to seek higher office. And even when women do run, their candidacies face harsher media coverage. One analysis of the 2020 Democratic presidential primary discovered that female candidates suffered more gendered and even racialized media coverage than their male counterparts did, with coverage often criticizing the women for lacking “warmth.” Kamala Harris, last year’s Democratic nominee for president, faced the same misogynistic bias.\n\nBut sexism isn’t unique to America. As of early August, only 26 of 193 U.N. member nations had a female head of state or government, according to CFR. And only six had a national legislature composed of at least 50% women.\n\nIn some ways, the U.S. has actually been more inclusive than other democracies. A 2025 report by U.N. Women, the United Nations’ agency that promotes global gender equality, found the U.S. with a higher share of women in top governmental positions (40%) than Japan had (10%). The U.S. was also ahead of New Zealand (35%), Poland (35%), Denmark (30%), and other democracies that have had a female head of state or government.\n\nAnother key reason why America’s glass ceiling is intact is our electoral process itself.\n\nMany countries that have had female leaders use a parliamentary system, unlike the U.S., which has a presidential system. Under a typical parliamentary system, the head of government is usually the leader of the largest party in the government’s lower house, which is directly elected by voters. \n\nConsider Canada. In 1993, Kim Campbell became the nation’s first—and so far only—female prime minister. But Canadians didn’t directly elect her to the role in the way Americans elect their president. Instead, she won a much smaller vote at her party’s leadership convention, and because her Progressive Conservative Party was the governing party of Canada, she became prime minister. This is a somewhat similar process to how Takaichi is set to become Japan’s first female prime minister.\n\nHowever, America chooses its head of government via voting in a presidential election. This likely introduces a distinct level of scrutiny for candidates that isn’t faced in many other democracies that have had a female leader. \n\nAnd unlike in many other countries, if President Donald Trump were to pass away or resign or be removed from office, the Republican Party would not get together and vote on his replacement. Instead, Vice President JD Vance would immediately be sworn in. (God help us.)\n\nIf the U.S. had a parliamentary system, our head of government might be chosen by the House of Representatives, which would surely be much larger. For instance, the U.K.’s House of Commons has 650 seats for a national population of about 69.3 million—or one seat for every 107,000 people or so. Give the U.S. that same ratio, and the House would have over 3,200 seats. It currently has 435. \n\nA parliamentary system in the U.S. would no doubt mean more parties—and very possibly a female head of government. In fact, if the leader of the House functioned as the U.S. president, Nancy Pelosi would’ve broken the glass ceiling in 2007.\n\nNevertheless, another quirk of our current system has already stood in the way of the nation getting a female leader: the Electoral College. If the nation elected its president by a simple national popular vote, Hillary Clinton would have become president. In 2016, she beat Trump in the popular vote by over 2.8 million votes.\n\nDespite all of this, the U.S. is trending in the right direction. The number of women serving in Congress has rapidly increased over the past 30 years. And it’s very likely the momentum will eventually, maybe even in three short years, propel a woman into the Oval Office.\n\nAny updates?\n\n Pennsylvania Democrats may soon tap a better man than Democratic Sen. John Fetterman. Since taking office, Fetterman has undergone a startling political shift, drifting to the right of the voters who pushed him into office—and new polling suggests he will face hard headwinds in his 2028 Democratic primary, should he choose to run again. A recent Quinnipiac University poll finds that just 33% of state Democrats approve of the job he’s doing, while 54% disapprove. And while Republicans widely approve of the Democratic senator—62% approve, 21% disapprove—Keystone State Republicans can’t vote in Democratic primaries. And if Fetterman were to endeavor an independent run at retaining his seat, it’s unlikely Republican voters will back him over an actual Republican.\n\n As Trump needlessly deploys troops to Democrat-run cities, most of the American public doesn’t want the National Guard involved in controlling local crime. Fifty-three percent think local police departments would better address crime in their states, while just 6% think the National Guard would, according to YouGov. Another 28% think local police and the National Guard would do equally well.\n\n Conservative misinformation, is there anything it can’t do? Just under half of Republicans (42%) falsely believe that undocumented immigrants are eligible to receive Medicaid, according to new YouGov polling. Only 29% of Republicans know undocumented immigrants are ineligible.\n\n We already know Americans hate Trump’s tariffs, but new data finds that it’s changing their shopping habits. About 1 in 3 Americans who recently shopped secondhand say they’re doing so because of the tariffs, according to Morning Consult. Ironically for Trump, secondhand shopping is one way to combat the climate crisis, which he claims is a con job and a hoax.\n\nThe United States might soon lose its measles-free status, according to a United Nations agency on public health, as outbreaks continue to spread across the nation.\n\nAt least 1,563 measles cases have been reported so far in 2025, according to Centers for Disease Control and Prevention data published on Wednesday. That makes for the most yearly cases since 1992, which was soon after major health organizations first started recommending a second dose of the vaccine to all children.\n\nBetween 2023 and 2024, the weekly average number of cases was just 3.3. In 2025, it’s 39.0.\n\nMeasles causes a blotchy rash and a high fever, along with a cough, a runny nose, and other symptoms. It is highly contagious and bears the most threat to children and those with compromised immune systems. Measles vaccination is estimated to have saved over 93 million lives across the world between 1974 and 2024.\n\nBut now vaccination rates are falling, cases have climbed this year, and at least three people have died.\n\nHealth and Human Services Secretary Robert F.

Israeli airstrikes and ground assaults have since devastated Gaza, killing more than 67,000 Palestinians, the enclave's health officials say.\n\nAdvertisement · Scroll to continue\n\n\"The war is over,\" Trump told reporters aboard Air Force One as he began his flight from Washington to Israel. Asked about prospects for the region, he said: \"I think it's going to normalize.\"\n\nThe U.N. said humanitarian aid was ramping up, with cooking gas entering for the first time since March and expanded food and medical deliveries.\n\nA LASTING PEACE SEEMS DISTANT\n\nThe truce and the exchange of both hostages and prisoners offered a glimmer of hope, but despite Trump's optimism, the loss of life, devastation and trauma underscored how distant a lasting peace remains. Progress now hinges on global commitments that could be taken up by a summit later on Monday of more than 20 world leaders led by Trump in Egypt's Sharm el-Sheikh resort.\n\nAdvertisement · Scroll to continue\n\nPalestinian President Mahmoud Abbas will attend the summit in Egypt, an Axios reporter said on Sunday, citing a senior Palestinian official. No Israeli officials will attend, Israeli government spokesperson Shosh Bedrosian said.\n\nBedrosian said Israel expected the remaining hostages to begin returning early on Monday with the 20 living hostages to be released together, followed by the handover of bodies of the remaining 28 dead hostages.\n\nShe said 1,700 Palestinians detained since October 7, 2023, along with 22 minors and the bodies of 360 militants, would be released only after Israeli hostages were safely returned.\n\nOn the ground, Palestinians returning to northern Gaza described scenes of staggering destruction.\n\n\"We couldn't believe the devastation,\" said Rami Mohammad-Ali, 37, who walked 15 kilometers (9 miles) with his son from Deir Al Balah to Gaza City. \"We are joyful to return, but bitter about the destruction,\" he added, recounting the sight of human remains scattered along the roads.\n\nAd Break Coming Up \n\n NEXT StayNext\n\nOffEnglish \n\n 180p288p360p480p540p576p720pHD1080pHDAuto (180p) \n\nAbout ConnatixV2092678056 \nAbout ConnatixV2092678056 \n\nContinue watchingafter the adVisit Advertiser websiteGO TO PAGE\n\nISRAELIS BOO NETANYAHU, CHEER TRUMP\n\nMultitudes who gathered late on Saturday at Tel Aviv's Hostages Square cheered and waved placards in praise of Trump during a speech by his special envoy Steve Witkoff but booed loudly when Witkoff sought to thank Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu for his role in the ceasefire effort.\n\nTrump will become only the fourth U.S. president to address the Knesset, following Jimmy Carter in 1979, Bill Clinton in 1994 and George W. Bush in 2008.\n\nIn a letter last week inviting Trump to deliver a formal address, Knesset Speaker Amir Ohana wrote: \"The people of Israel regard you as the greatest friend and ally of the Jewish nation in modern history.\"\n\nIsraeli critics of Netanyahu, including hostages' families, accuse him of deliberately prolonging the conflict to placate his far-right government coalition partners, whose backing is crucial to his political survival. The International Criminal Court last year issued arrest warrants for Netanyahu for alleged war crimes and crimes against humanity, which Israel denies.\n\n\"Tomorrow is the beginning of a new path. A path of building, a path of healing, and I hope – a path of uniting hearts,\" Netanyahu said in a televised statement on Sunday.\n\nThe U.S., along with Egypt, Qatar and Turkey, mediated what has been described as a first phase agreement between Israel and Hamas. The next phase of Trump's plan calls for an international body - a \"Board of Peace\" led by Trump and joined by former British Prime Minister Tony Blair - to play a role in Gaza's post-war administration.\n\nMuch could still go wrong. Further steps in Trump's 20-point plan have yet to be agreed. Those include how Gaza is to be ruled when fighting ends, and the ultimate fate of Hamas, which has rejected Israel's demands that it disarm.\n\nThe Hamas-run Interior Ministry said it would deploy security forces in areas where the Israeli army withdrew. It was unclear whether armed militants would return to the streets in significant numbers, which Israel would see as a provocation.\n\nTENSE NEGOTIATIONS OVER RELEASE OF PALESTINIAN PRISONERS\n\nIsrael and Hamas were locked in tense, albeit indirect, negotiations over the list of Palestinian prisoners to be freed. Sources close to Hamas said Israel had backtracked on a previously agreed list that included senior militant leaders, raising fears of a breakdown in the fragile deal.\n\nThe Israeli Justice Ministry released the names of 250 Palestinians convicted of murder and other serious crimes due to be released. The list excluded high-profile figures such as senior Hamas commanders as well as Marwan Barghouti and Ahmed Saadat - key demands from Hamas. Talks over the final list were ongoing, said the Hamas prisoners information office.\n\nDefence Minister Israel Katz warned that once the hostages were back the military would proceed to destroy Hamas' underground tunnel network in Gaza.\n\nPalestinian analyst Akram Attallah told Reuters in Cairo the Trump plan had been crafted to favour Israel, allowing it to dictate terms and shift blame.\n\n\"If they choose to backtrack, they can find excuses and blame Hamas. Meanwhile, Hamas, the weaker party, loses all leverage once it hands over the hostages,\" Attallah said.\n\nReporting by Alexander Cornwell in Jerusalem, Nidal al-Mughrabi in Cairo and Howard Goller in New York; Additional reporting by Steve Holland in Washington and Michelle Nichols at the United Nations; Writing by Howard Goller; Editing by Edmund Klamann\n\nPurchase Licensing Rights\n\nAlexander CornwellThomson ReutersAlexander has over a decade of international reporting experience.

This occurs during a crucial period, with Israel and Hamas just starting to execute the opening stage of the Trump accord designed to permanently conclude the conflict sparked by the Oct. 7, 2023, assault on Israel by Hamas-led fighters. Trump believes there exists a narrow window to transform the Middle East and repair the fractured relationships between Israel and its Arab neighbours. The Republican president maintains this moment has been enabled by his administration's support of Israel's destruction of Iranian proxies, including Hamas in Gaza and Hezbollah in Lebanon. \"Very excited about this moment in time,\" Trump also told reporters before Air Force One departed. He noted that numerous people in both Israel and Arab nations were \"cheering\" the accord, stating that \"everybody's amazed and their thrilled and we're going to have an amazing time.\" The White House has announced that momentum is building as Arab and Muslim states show a renewed focus on resolving the long-standing Israeli-Palestinian conflict, and in some instances, strengthening ties with the United States.
