Trucks' made in other parts of the World.'\n\nThe trucking announcement was followed up almost immediately with a 50 percent tariff 'on all Kitchen Cabinets, Bathroom Vanities, and associated products.'\n\nThat was accompanied by 'a 30% Tariff on Upholstered Furniture.\n\n'The reason for this is the large scale 'FLOODING' of these products into the United States by other outside Countries. It is a very unfair practice,' Trump said.\n\nFinally, he unveiled a mammoth '100% Tariff on any branded or patented Pharmaceutical Product.'\n\nThe final announcement was met with a caveat that businesses 'BUILDING their Pharmaceutical Manufacturing Plant in America' would be excluded. \n\nIn order to qualify for the exclusion, a business must be '''breaking ground'' and/or ''under construction''' on their American operations.\n\nThe new tariffs will all come into effect beginning on October 1st.\n\nTrump said his trucking tariff would protect 'our Great Large Truck Company Manufacturers, such as Peterbilt, Kenworth, Freightliner, Mack Trucks, and others' from 'the onslaught of outside interruptions.'\n\nTrump said it was crucial for 'our Truckers to be financially healthy and strong, for many reasons, but above all else, for National Security purposes!' \n\nSo far, neither the White House nor the Commerce Department, which led the trade investigations into these products, has released further details on the proposals or their implementation.\n\nTrump's tariff announcements come just months after he implemented a deal to slash tariffs on Japanese imports to 15 percent, including vehicles and auto parts. \n\nThe deal, which infuriated U.S. automakers, will allow Japanese-built cars to face lower tariffs than the parts U.S. automakers import to build their own.\n\nThe deal is a major retreat from months of threats to impose a punishing 25 percent levy on automakers like Toyota, Honda, Subaru, Mazda, and Nissan, the Daily Mail previously reported.\n\nThat change has sparked widespread outrage among major U.S. car companies. Representatives for the Detroit Big Three - General Motors, Ford, and Chrysler - said the lower tariff rate gives their foreign rivals an unfair edge.\n\nMatt Blunt, head of the American Automotive Policy Council, which represents the three automakers, called the agreement a 'bad deal for U.S. industry and U.S. auto workers,' in a statement to DailyMail.com.\n\nHe added that automakers are still analyzing the impacts, but criticized 'lower tariff for Japanese imports with virtually no U.S. content than the tariff imposed on North American built vehicles.'\n\nIn addition to the tax on Japanese imports, the White House imposed new steel and aluminum tariffs up to 50 percent on foreign nations in June. \n\nA top aluminum manufacturing CEO has since admitted that Trump's plan could actually hurt American companies while foreign competitors gain an unfair advantage.\n\nThe CEO of U.S Metal Powders, an aluminum powder processing factory based in rural Carbon County, Pennsylvania, told the Daily Mail that Trump's plan may have backfired.\n\nCEO Eric Degenfelder said that Trump's new 50 percent tariffs are leaving U.S. domestic manufacturers at a severe disadvantage.\n\nThe tariffs started driving up aluminum prices in the U.S. from about $1.25 to $1.80 'in a matter of a few months,' he said.\n\nDegenfelder said Trump's tariffs are boosting foreign competitors because customers are 'buying cheap aluminum in another region and then making aluminum powder and importing it to the U.S.","summary":"In a Truth Social post on Thursday night, Trump vowed to 'protect our Great Heavy Truck Manufacturers from unfair outside competition.'","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-15135335/trump-new-tariffs-trucking-industry.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/09/26/01/102463907-0-image-m-93_1758846363811.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-09-26 00:26:16","author":"Editor,Samantha Rutt","authors":["Editor","Samantha Rutt"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":0.004},{"id":363539748,"title":"Former FBI head James Comey calls Trump a 'tyrant' following his indictment for lying to Congress while declaring his innocence","text":"Former FBI Director James Comey called Trump 'a tyrant' and refused to back down after he was indicted by the Department of Justice on one count of making false statements and one count of obstruction.\n\nComey has been a staunch critic of Donald Trump's administration since the president fired him in 2017.\n\nAttorney General Pam Bondi confirmed the charges in a post to social media Thursday evening. \n\n'No one is above the law. Today's indictment reflects this Department of Justice's commitment to holding those who abuse positions of power accountable for misleading the American people. We will follow the facts in this case.' \n\nDonald Trump celebrated the indictment on Truth Social: 'JUSTICE IN AMERICA! One of the worst human beings this Country has ever been exposed to is James Comey, the former Corrupt Head of the FBI. Today he was indicted by a Grand Jury on two felony counts for various illegal and unlawful acts. He has been so bad for our Country, for so long, and is now at the beginning of being held responsible for his crimes against our Nation. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!' \n\nComey released a statement of his own in an Instagram video, saying: 'My family and I have known for years that there are costs to standing up to Donald Trump. But we couldn't imagine ourselves living any other way. We will not live on our knees and you shouldn't either.'\n\n'Somebody that I love dearly recently said that fear is the tool of a tyrant and she's right but I'm not afraid and I hope you're not either. I hope instead you're engaged, you're paying attention and you will vote like your beloved country depends on it, which it does.'\n\n'My heart is broken for the Department of Justice but I have great confidence in the federal judicial system. I'm innocent, so let's have a trial and keep the faith,' added Comey, who CNN reported is expected to surrender on Friday. \n\nThe indictment makes Comey the first former senior government official to face prosecution in connection with one of TrumpÂ´s chief grievances: the long-concluded investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election. \n\nTrump and his supporters have long derided that investigation as a 'hoax' and a 'witch hunt' despite multiple government reviews showing Moscow interfered on behalf of the RepublicanÂ´s campaign.\n\nThe criminal case is likely to deepen concerns that the Justice Department under Bondi, a Trump loyalist, is being weaponized in pursuit of investigations and now prosecutions of public figures the president regards as his political enemies. \n\nIt was filed as the White House has taken steps to exert influence in unprecedented ways on the operations of the Justice Department, blurring the line between law and politics for an agency where independence in prosecutorial decision-making is a foundational principle.\n\nComey was fired months into TrumpÂ´s first administration and has long been a top target for Trump supporters seeking retribution. \n\nHe was singled out by name in a Saturday social media post in which Trump complained directly to Bondi that she had not yet brought charges against him.\n\nThe following evening, Trump said in a Truth Social post aimed at the attorney general that department investigations had not resulted in prosecutions. \n\nHe said he would nominate Lindsey Halligan, a White House aide, to serve as U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia. \n\nShe has been one of Trump's personal lawyers and does not have experience as a federal prosecutor.\n\n'We canÂ´t delay any longer, itÂ´s killing our reputation and credibility,' Trump wrote, referencing the fact that he himself had been indicted and impeached multiple times. 'JUSTICE MUST BE SERVED, NOW!!!'\n\nThe office that filed the case against Comey, the Eastern District of Virginia, was thrown into turmoil last week following the resignation of chief prosecutor Erik Siebert under pressure to bring charges against another Trump target, New York Attorney General Letitia James, in a mortgage fraud investigation.\n\nHalligan had rushed to present the case to a grand jury this week. Prosecutors were evaluating whether Comey lied to Congress during testimony on Sept. 30, 2020, and they had until Tuesday to bring a case before the five-year statute of limitations expired. \n\nThe push to move forward came even as prosecutors in the office had detailed in a memo concerns about the pursuit of an indictment.\n\nTrump has for years railed against both a finding by U.S. intelligence agencies that Russia preferred him to Democrat Hillary Clinton in the 2016 election and the criminal investigation that tried to determine whether his campaign had conspired with Moscow to sway the outcome of that race. \n\nProsecutors led by special counsel Robert Mueller did not establish that Trump or his associates criminally colluded with Russia, but they did find that TrumpÂ´s campaign had welcomed MoscowÂ´s assistance.\n\nTrump has seized on the fact that MuellerÂ´s investigation did not find that the Trump campaign and the Kremlin colluded, and that there were significant errors and omissions made by the FBI in wiretap applications, to claim vindication. \n\nA yearslong investigation into potential misconduct during the Russia investigation, was conducted by a different special counsel, John Durham. \n\nThat produced three criminal cases, including against an FBI lawyer, but not against senior government officials.\n\nThe criminal case against Comey does not concern the substance of the Russia investigation. \n\nRather, it accuses him of having lied to a Senate committee in his 2020 appearance when he said he never authorized anyone to serve as an anonymous source to a reporter about the investigation.\n\nTrumpÂ´s administration is trying to cast the Russia investigation as the outgrowth of an effort under Democratic President Barack Obama to overhype MoscowÂ´s interference in the election and to undermine the legitimacy of TrumpÂ´s victory.\n\nAdministration officials, including CIA Director John Ratcliffe and Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard, have declassified a series of documents meant to chip away at the strength of an Obama-era intelligence assessment published in January 2017 that said Moscow had engaged in a broad campaign of interference at the direction of Russian President Vladimir Putin.\n\nComey has for years been a prime Trump antagonist. Comey was a senior Justice Department official in Republican President George W. BushÂ´s administration, was picked by Obama to lead the FBI in 2013 and was director when the bureau opened the Russia investigation.\n\nComeyÂ´s relationship with Trump was strained from the start and was exacerbated when Comey resisted a request by Trump at a private White House dinner to pledge personal loyalty to the president. That overture so unnerved the FBI director that he documented it in a contemporaneous memorandum.\n\nTrump fired Comey in May 2017, an action later investigated by Mueller for potential obstruction of justice.\n\nAfter being let go, Comey authorized a close friend to share with a reporter the substance of an unclassified memo that documented an Oval Office request from Trump to shut down an FBI investigation into his first national security adviser, Michael Flynn. \n\nTrump and his allies later branded Comey a leaker, with the president even accusing him of treason. \n\nComey himself has called Trump 'ego driven' and likened him to a mafia don.\n\nThe Justice Department, during TrumpÂ´s first term, declined to prosecute Comey over his handling of his memos. \n\nThe departmentÂ´s inspector general did issue a harshly critical report in 2019 that said Comey violated FBI policies, including by failing to return the documents to the FBI after he was dismissed and for sharing them with his personal lawyers without FBI permission.\n\nEarlier this year, the department fired ComeyÂ´s daughter, Maurene Comey, from her job as a prosecutor in the Southern District of New York. \n\nShe has since sued, saying the termination was carried out without any explanation and was done for political reasons.","summary":"Comey has been a staunch critic of Donald Trump 's administration since the president fired him.

But the additional tariffs risk intensifying inflation that is already elevated, as well as slowing economic growth, as employers getting acclimated to Trumpâs previous import taxes grapple with new levels of uncertainty.\n\nTrump said on Truth Social that the pharmaceutical tariffs would not apply to companies that are building manufacturing plants in the United States, which he defined as either âbreaking groundâ or being âunder construction.â It was unclear how the tariffs would apply to companies that already have factories in the U.S.\n\nIn 2024, America imported nearly $233 billion in pharmaceutical and medicinal products, according to the Census Bureau. The prospect of prices doubling for some medicines could send shockwaves to voters as health care expenses, as well as the costs of Medicare and Medicaid, potentially increase.\n\nTrump said that foreign manufacturers of furniture and cabinetry were flooding the United States with their products and that tariffs must be applied âfor National Security and other reasons.â The new tariffs on cabinetry could further increase the costs for homebuilders at a time when many people seeking to buy a house feel priced out by the mix of housing shortages and high mortgage rates.\n\nTrump said that foreign-made heavy trucks and parts are hurting domestic producers.\n\nâLarge Truck Company Manufacturers, such as Peterbilt, Kenworth, Freightliner, Mack Trucks, and others, will be protected from the onslaught of outside interruptions,â Trump posted.\n\nTrump has long maintained that tariffs are the key to forcing companies to invest more in domestic factories. He has dismissed fears that importers would simply pass along much of the cost of the taxes to consumers and businesses in the form of higher prices.\n\nThe president continues to claim that inflation is no longer a challenge for the U.S. economy, despite evidence to the contrary. The consumer price index has increased 2.9% over the past 12 months, up from an annual pace of 2.3% in April, when Trump first launched a sweeping set of import taxes.\n\nNor is there evidence that the tariffs are creating factory jobs or more construction of manufacturing facilities. Since April, the Bureau of Labor Statistics has reported that manufacturers cut 42,000 jobs and builders have downsized by 8,000.\n\nâThereâs no inflation,â Trump told reporters Thursday. âWeâre having unbelievable success.â","summary":"WASHINGTON (AP) â President Donald Trump said Thursday that he will put import taxes of 100% on pharmaceutical drugs, 50%&#8230; Continue reading Trump To Put Import Taxes on Pharmaceutical Drugs, Kitchen Cabinets, Furniture and Heavy Trucks\n\n\nThe post Trump To Put Import Taxes on Pharmaceutical Drugs, Kitchen Cabinets, Furniture and Heavy Trucks appeared first on The National Herald.","url":"https://www.thenationalherald.com/trump-to-put-import-taxes-on-pharmaceutical-drugs-kitchen-cabinets-furniture-and-heavy-trucks/","image":"https://www.thenationalherald.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/TRUMP70-scaled.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-09-26 00:10:34","author":"Antonis","authors":["Antonis"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.172},{"id":363534740,"title":"With Jack Ciattarelli tied with Mikie Sherrill in NJ gov race, national GOP needs to step up","text":"New Jersey voters just got great news: Though their state leans blue, the race for governor this year wonât be a cakewalk for the Democrat, Rep.

According to CNN, a statue titled Best Friends Forever of the US President and Jeffrey Epstein holding hands was installed on Tuesday, with the backdrop of the United States Capitol. The CNN reported that the National Park Service, on Wednesday, September 24, 2025, removed a statue which reportedly had a plaque titled, In Honor of Friendship Month and reads:âWe celebrate the long-lasting bond between President Donald J. Trump and his âclosest friend,â Jeffrey Epstein.âAfter the statue of the US President and Jeffrey Epstein holding hands was erected on the National Mall, American blogger and columnist Perez Hilton took to his blog on September 24 to share his views.âTrump has declared he doesnât want anyone to bring up Epstein anymore, for reasons only he knows. Probably a âwonderful secret.â But itâs not surprising the statue didnât get to stay, considering,â Perez Hilton quipped in his blog post. The media personality further questioned the removal of the statue and seemingly linked it to the infamous Epstein files. âNo word where the piece was moved â maybe into the same place where all the Epstein evidence and the Smithsonianâs exhibits on slavery are, somewhere far from the eyes of the publicâ¦â, Perez Hilton explained. Meanwhile, according to CNN, an organiser from The Secret Handshake group, which reportedly placed the statue, acknowledged that the groupâs security guards were present when the statue was dismantled. While the Department of the Interior claimed the statue violated its permit, the organiser told CNN that the statue was expected to be up for a week as its permit allowed it to be there until 8 p.m. Sunday. Perez Hilton questions âfree speechâ after the âfriendshipâ statue of Trump and Epstein gets removed In his Wednesday blog post, Perez Hilton called out Donald Trump for getting the statue removed. âWow! Donald Trump is really cracking down on free speech this month!â said Perez.The media personality also mentioned the return of Jimmy Kimmel to television after he was suspended âindefinitelyâ for his comments on the assassination of Charlie Kirk. According to Hilton, during his opening monologue, Kimmel cited the Presidentâs inability to âtake a jokeâ as well as stressed âfree speechâ concerns.âItâs serious as the President is going after journalists as hard as late-night comedians.

There were, as far as I can tell, four other Jewish donors in the top 25.\n\nYet you may notice that paranoid Israel-haters on the right are fixated on billionaires like Larry Ellison and Bill Ackman, a longtime Democrat who defected to Republicans in part because of the leftâs embrace of Hamas apologists â and not Elon Musk or Vivek Ramaswamy or Peter Thiel or many others.\n\nCarlson, for instance, blamed Fox News personality and radio host Mark Levin for convincing Trump to bomb Iranian nuclear sites.\n\nIndeed, the podcaster assured his credulous audience that Levin was leading the United States into World War III at the behest of foreigners.\n\nWe expect this kind of aspersion from the progressive left, not alleged conservatives.\n\nOne can say many things about Donald Trump, but the notion that his positions can be bought by campaign funds stretches credulity.\n\nBesides, no one needs to buy Trumpâs support for Israel, considering heâs been an on-the-record vocal champion of the Jewish state for nearly 40 years.\n\nWhen Trump this week met on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly with French president Emmanuel Macron â who had just rewarded Hamas with unilateral recognition of an imaginary Palestinian state â he made his position known.\n\nâWell, I have to say that Iâm on the side of Israel,â Trump said. âIâve been on the side of Israel really my whole life.â\n\nIt is difficult to argue that any president has been a better friend.\n\nTrump was offering pro-Israel statements years before he was in political office; years before he had any donors; and years before Benjamin Netanyahu, the boogeyman of Jew-baiters, was Israelâs prime minister.\n\nIt is also objectively false that American Jews are an ideological monolith.\n\nIâve spent 20 years publicly disagreeing with numerous Jewish American organizations and individuals, and I can assure you we donât have secret meetings to plot control of the world.\n\nIâve never met a Jewish billionaire.\n\nJews, though, are the only ethnic group that is collectively smeared as Fifth Columnists for advocating for causes they believe in.\n\nOne of the popular issues among many American Jews is championing the long-standing US allyship with Israel â a wholly moral, constructive and defensible position that many individuals and groups openly advocate.\n\nThe insinuation that itâs nefarious to do so is only peddled by bigots unwilling or unable to debate the issue in good faith.\n\nItâs clear that the stigma associated with spreading ugly tropes about Jews is disappearing. Itâs been that way in the conspiratorial swamp of social media and podcasting for a while.\n\nNow it is being normalized in the real world.\n\nDavid Harsanyi is a senior writer at the Washington Examiner.

They're going to be talking about the newest weapons.\"\n\nIt's unclear if the order was for all general and flag officers â those with the rank of one star or higher â or just those in certain command or leadership roles.\n\nThe meeting comes as the Trump administration has fired a slew of high-profile general and flag officers since taking office in January, in many instances due to Hegseth's campaign against diversity-related issues, but often also for unspecified reasons.\n\nHegseth also ordered the Defence Department in May to cut the number of four-star generals and admirals by at least twenty per cent.\n\nThe officers who have been fired thus far include former Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen. CQ Brown; Adm. Lisa Franchetti, former Chief of Naval Operations; Adm. Linda Fagan, former Commandant of the Coast Guard; Gen. James Slife, former vice chief of the Air Force; Lt. Gen. Jeffrey Kruse, former head of the US Defence Intelligence Agency; Vice Adm. Nancy Lacore, former chief of the Navy Reserve; and Rear Adm. Milton Sands, former head of Naval Special Warfare Command.\n\nBefore taking on the role of defence secretary, Hegseth repeatedly voiced disdain for much of the military's currently serving general and flag officer corps.\n\nIn a podcast appearance last summer, Hegseth said a third of the military's senior officers were \"actively complicit\" in what he argued is a move towards politicisation of the military.\n\nIn a second podcast, he said senior officers were \"playing by all the wrong rules\" to cater to \"ideologues in Washington, DC.\"\n\nREAD MORE: Micki thought he'd lost $150k.

His suspected assassin, 22-year-old Tyler Robinson, is facing seven counts over the shooting, including a capital murder charge.\n\nThe activist, who died aged 31, co-founded the organisation, Turning Point USA, back in 2012. The body is a not-for-profit that advocates for conservative causes.\n\nHe was also recognised as a prominent figure involved in the MAGA movement and was a friend of President Donald Trump.\n\nSouth Bunbury has also issued a public statement on the club's Facebook page condemning Ms Waite's fancy dress outfit.\n\n'We have today become aware of an image circulating that depicts our Club President dressed as Charlie Kirk, a well-known American political commentator, as part of a themed event held earlier this week,' a spokesperson said.\n\n'The theme of the event was 'Famous Dead Person,' and the portrayal was intended to reflect that theme in a theatrical and humorous way. However, in light of Mr. Kirk's recent and tragic death, we acknowledge that this depiction was inappropriate and may be viewed as insensitive.\n\n'We wish to make it clear that the choice of costume was not intended to make any political statement or commentary. Nonetheless, we recognise that the timing and nature of the portrayal were regrettable.'\n\nThe club also revealed that they have been in contact with league officials regarding the matter.\n\n'We offer our sincere apologies to anyone who may have been offended or distressed by the image.

It was announced that this year's Ryder Cup would take place at Bethpage Black, famously recommended \"only for highly skilled golfers,\" on Sept. 17, 2013. Originally, this was supposed to be the 2024 Ryder Cup, but the pandemic postponed the 2020 Ryder Cup, pushing back each of the following events. This was actually the second time the Ryder Cup had been delayed, the first being in 2001 due to the Sept. 11 terror attacks. Thus, the Ryder Cup, which originally was planned to take place in odd-numbered years, has reverted to its old ways. CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM Now, after nearly 12 years since the announcement, golfers will finally tee off shortly after 7 a.m. ET on Friday. NBC, USA and Peacock will be streaming the events. The Ryder Cup began in 1927, originally as a competition between the United States and Great Britain and Ireland. But the Americans dominated, and Jack Nicklaus was part of expanding the overseas team to include all of Europe beginning in 1979, changing the tournament forever. The change brought in legends like Seve Ballesteros, Bernhard Langer and Sandy Lyle, and Europe became a legitimate force. Since the expansion, there have been 22 Ryder Cups, and Europe has a 12-9-1 record in that span â and that includes USA winning the first three Ryder Cups since the European expansion. The biennial match-play tournament is a three-day event with five different sessions. Friday and Saturday see four fourball matches and four alternate-shot matches, split between the morning and afternoon. On Sunday, all 24 players go one-on-one in singles matches. TRUMP'S RYDER CUP PRESEBCE âEXTREMELY IMPORTANTâ AFTER âTOUGH FEW WEEKS,â SCOTTIE SCHEFFLER SAYS A total of 28 points are up for grabs, so a team needs 14.5 points in order to win the Ryder Cup. However, since Team Europe won the last event, a tie would result in them retaining the trophy until 2027. Team USA, captained by Keegan Bradley, consists of Scottie Scheffler, J.J. Spaun, Xander Schauffele, Russell Henley, Harris English, Bryson DeChambeau, Justin Thomas, Collin Morikawa, Cameron Young, Ben Griffin, Patrick Cantlay and Sam Burns. Bradley had the opportunity to select himself, but ultimately chose not to. Luke Donald is bringing back just about his entire winning team from 2023. The only difference is Rasmus Hojgaard taking the place of his twin brother, Nicolai. Hojgaard will join Rory McIlroy, Robert MacIntyre, Tommy Fleetwood, Justin Rose, Tyrrell Hatton, Shane Lowry, Sepp Straka, Ludvig Aberg, Viktor Hovland, Matt Fitzpatrick and Jon Rahm.

Nope, I will not allow it. It&apos;s not going to happen,\" Trump told reporters in the Oval Office. \"There&apos;s been enough. It&apos;s time to stop now,\" he said. Trump made the comments as Netanyahu was arriving in New York to deliver an address to the United Nations on Friday. Netanyahu&apos;s office did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Trump&apos;s remarks. Netanyahu recently said that, under his administration, Israel had \"doubled Jewish settlement\" in the West Bank and promised that \"we will continue on this course\". Israel&apos;s far-right national security minister, Itamar Ben-Gvir, recently suggested annexing the West Bank as a response to several Western nations recently recognising a Palestinian state . \"The recognition by the UK, Canada, and Australia of a Palestinian state as a prize for the murderous [Hamas] terrorists requires immediate countermeasures,\" he said as reported by the Times of Israel. He called for \"the immediate application of sovereignty in Judea and Samaria\", the Biblical terms for the West Bank. Israeli settlements have grown in size and number since Israel captured the West Bank in a 1967 war. They stretch deep into the territory with a system of roads and other infrastructure under Israeli control , further slicing up the land. A widely condemned Israeli settlement plan known as the E1 project , which would bisect the occupied West Bank and cut it off from East Jerusalem, received final approval in August. It will cut across land that the Palestinians seek for a state. Trump met leaders and officials from Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Qatar, Egypt, Jordan, TÃ¼rkiye, Indonesia and Pakistan on Tuesday to discuss the nearly two-year-long war in Gaza between Israel and Palestinian militant group Hamas. Arab and Muslim countries warned him about the grave consequences of any annexation of the West Bank â a message the US president \"understands very well\", according to Saudi Arabia&apos;s foreign minister, Prince Faisal bin Farhan Al-Saud. About 700,000 Israeli settlers live among 2.7 million Palestinians in the West Bank and East Jerusalem, which Israel annexed in a move not recognised by most countries. Israel refuses to cede control of the West Bank, a position it says has been reinforced since the Hamas-led militant attack on its territory , launched from Gaza on 7 October 2023, in which around 1,200 people were killed and more than 250 taken hostage. Since then, Israel&apos;s retaliatory offensive on Gaza has killed more than 65,500 Palestinians , according to Gaza Health Ministry figures. Addressing the UN General Assembly on Thursday, Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas condemned Israel&apos;s military offensive in Gaza while saying Palestinians \"reject\" the October 7 attack on Israel and pledging that the militant group would have no role in governing Gaza after the war ends.

If I could, Iâd make it a hundred percent MAGA related.â\n\nIf I could make it one hundred percent MAGA, I would,â he said. âBut itâs not going to work out that way unfortunately. No, everyone's going to be treated fairly.\"\n\nThen-President Joe Biden signed legislation last year calling for Chinaâs ByteDance to sell TikTokâs assets to an American company by early this year or face a nationwide ban. Trump, during his first term, attempted to ban the company from operating in the U.S. via executive action, but the effort was abandoned after a court challenge. \n\nUnder the terms of the deal, a new joint-venture company will oversee TikTokâs U.S. business, with ByteDance retaining less than a 20 percent stake. Tech giant Oracle, investment firm Silver Lake Partners, and the MGX investment fund will reportedly control around 45 percent.\n\nFurther details of the investors and specific businesses are set to follow, though Dell CEO Michael Dell, Oracleâs Larry Ellison and media mogul Rupert Murdoch have all been mentioned previously.\n\nâTheyâre very well known people,â Trump told Fox News Sunday. âLarry Ellison [of Oracle] is one of them. Heâs involved, heâs a great guy. Michael Dell is involved... Rupert is probably gonna be in the group. I think theyâre going to be in the group. Couple of others, really great people, very prominent people.â\n\nEllison and Dell are both business leaders who've made their support for the president and his party known previously. The Oracle co-founder was featured at a Starlink presentation at the White House alongside Elon Musk at the beginning of this year, while Dell participated in a CEO roundtable hosted by the president in June. \n\nA source with knowledge of the situation confirmed to The Independent that the Murdochs were involved in conversations with the White House on the issue, despite the tumultuous relationship between the patriarch and the president.\n\nMurdoch senior has been a past supporter of Trump through his media companies, though he is now being sued for $10 billion by the president, after the Wall Street Journal, which is owned by News Corp, published a story accusing Trump of sending Jeffrey Epstein a âbawdyâ birthday card â a claim the president has vehemently denied.\n\nThe pair was pictured attending a U.K. state dinner in honor of Trump at Windsor Castle, hosted by King Charles.\n\nNo representatives from ByteDance were present in the Oval Office Thursday for the signing, and the company hasnât acknowledged that a transaction is taking place, CNBC reports. The Chinese embassy in Washington also did not immediately respond to a request for comment fromThe Associated Press to confirm that China has signed off on the proposed framework deal.\n\nNews of the new deal comes after a report from the Pew Research Center, published Thursday, found that around 43 percent of U.S. adults under the age of 30 say they regularly get news from TikTok, higher than any other social media app including YouTube, Facebook and Instagram.\n\nMany U.S. lawmakers have argued that the app posed a national security threat for a variety of reasons. Lawmakers are uncomfortable with ByteDanceâs alleged connections to the Chinese Communist Party and laws in China they say would have required the company to hand over Americansâ personal information or other data to Chinese officials if asked. \n\nIn his comments to reporters, Trump said that the only kickbacks the U.S. government would receive from the deal amounted to âtaxesâ paid by the new U.S. commercial entity in charge of the app.\n\nStill, others on Capitol Hill have expressed distrust in the appâs algorithm, either due to the spread of misinformation or political messages that clash with official U.S. policy â including content critical of Israelâs siege of Gaza.\n\nIn January, Trump boasted that his actions had âsavedâ the app for its millions of American users, many of whom were unhappy with news of the ban. The president also said at the time that âweâre going to make a lot of moneyâ with the deal, presumably referring to American buyers. The appâs owners, meanwhile, thanked the Republican president with a message sent to all U.S-based users.\n\nSome progressives, in the months since January and even the 2024 election, have grumbled that the legislation was a trap for Democrats and put centrist members of the party, including then-President Joe Biden, on the wrong side of an unpopular ban.\n\nReacting to a post from Pod Save America host Dan Pfeiffer assuming that the eventual American board members of TikTok would likely be pulled from a list of pro-Trump billionaire donors, Rep.

Comey faces charges of making false statements and obstruction of justice. The indictment follows Trumpâs public call earlier this week for Attorney General Pam Bondi to pursue charges against Comey and other officials. \"No one is above the law,\" Bondi said on X after the indictment was announced, without naming Comey. \"Today's indictment reflects this Department of Justice's commitment to holding those who abuse positions of power accountable for misleading the American people. We will follow the facts in this case.\" The indictment was filed by Lindsey Halligan, a former personal lawyer to Trump who was appointed US attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia just days earlier. Halligan has no prior prosecutorial experience. She replaced Erik Siebert, who resigned last week after reportedly telling Justice Department leaders there was insufficient evidence to charge Comey or New York Attorney General Letitia James. James and other Democratic officials have been accused by Trump allies, including Federal Housing Finance Agency director Bill Pulte, of falsifying mortgage documents. Comey was dismissed by Trump in 2017 during an investigation into possible collusion between Trumpâs campaign and Russia during the 2016 election. His indictment comes amid a broader crackdown on critics, including former national security advisor John Bolton, whose home and office were raided in August as part of a classified documents probe. Bolton has angered Trump with his memoir, The Room Where it Happened, and frequent public criticism of the president, calling him \"unfit to be president.\" Since returning to office in January, Trump has taken punitive steps against perceived opponents, including stripping former officials of security clearances, targeting law firms that handled past cases against him, and cutting federal funding to certain universities. Trump himself has faced multiple investigations. The FBI raided his Mar-a-Lago residence in 2022 over classified documents, and Special Counsel Jack Smith charged him with trying to overturn the 2020 election results. Neither case went to trial, and Smith dropped both after Trumpâs victory in the 2024 election, citing Justice Department policy against prosecuting a sitting president.","summary":"","url":"https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/former-fbi-director-james-comey-indicted-donald-trump-appointed-prosecutor-files-charges-of-false-statements-obstruction/articleshow/124138003.cms","image":"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/resizemode-4,width-1280,height-720,msid-124138023/124138023.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-09-25 23:46:27","author":"Toi World Desk","authors":["Toi World Desk"],"language":"en","source_country":"in","sentiment":-0.261},{"id":363536808,"title":"James Comey indicted days after Trump demanded DOJ move 'now'","text":"Former FBI Director James Comey has been indicted on charges of making a false statement and obstruction related to his testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee in 2020, just days after President Donald Trump issued a public demand for his Justice Department to act \"now\" to bring prosecutions against Comey and other political foes.\n\nA statement released by the U.S. Attorneyâs Office for the Eastern District of Virginia said that if convicted, Comey faces up to five years in prison. \"Actual sentences for federal crimes are typically less than the maximum penalties,\" the statement said.\n\nThe charges follow Trump's ousting of the U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia, Erik Siebert, who according to sources had expressed doubts internally about bringing cases against Comey, as well as New York Attorney General Letitia James, after Trump appointed him to lead the office. \n\nTrump then immediately moved to install Lindsey Halligan, a White House aide and his former defense attorney, to lead the office, despite her having no prior prosecutorial experience. \n\nEarlier this week, federal prosecutors in Virginia informed Halligan that they could not establish probable cause to charge Comey, ABC News first reported. Despite the lack of clear evidence and ethical concerns about bringing a case without clear probable cause, Halligan sought an indictment from the grand jury, sources said. \n\nAn attorney for Comey did not immediately respond to a request for comment from ABC News.\n\nIn a series of social media posts over the weekend, Trump said Halligan was being appointed to the office to \"get things moving,\" after attacking Siebert for his resistance to bring what Trump described as a \"GREAT CASE.\"\n\n\"Pam Bondi is doing a GREAT job as Attorney General of the United States.

General Assembly this week to discuss strategy on ending the Israel-Hamas war in Gaza.\n\nTies have improved between the U.S. and Pakistan as Trumpâs relationship with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, one of the Republican presidentâs closest with a world leader during his first term, has become strained over Indiaâs increased purchases of discounted Russian oil after Moscow invaded Ukraine in February 2022. India and Pakistan are neighbors and fierce rivals.\n\nTrump has dramatically raised tariffs on India for those oil purchases in an effort to put indirect economic pressure on Moscow.\n\nMeanwhile, the U.S. and Pakistan reached a trade agreement in July that is expected to allow Washington to help develop Pakistanâs largely untapped oil reserves and lower tariffs for Islamabad.\n\nSharif arrived at the White House shortly before 5 p.m. as Trump was signing executive orders and talking with reporters. The meeting between the two leaders was closed to the media, with Pakistanâs delegation leaving the White House at 6:18 p.m.\n\nSharif has gained favor with Trump since publicly endorsing the American leader for a Nobel Peace Prize for his administrationâs efforts this year at reducing tensions between Pakistan and India. India and Pakistan agreed to a ceasefire in May after U.S.-led talks to end the most serious military confrontation between the nuclear-armed rivals in decades.\n\nUnlike Sharif, Modi has declined to indulge Trumpâs attempt to claim credit for brokering the ceasefire.\n\nThat deal followed weeks of clashes, missile and drone strikes across their borders. The clashes were triggered by a massacre of tourists that India blames on Pakistan, which denies the charge.\n\nPakistan did split with Trump on his decision to carry out U.S. strikes in June on three Iranian nuclear facilities. Pakistan said the attack âconstituted a serious violation of international lawâ as well as on the stature of the International Atomic Energy Agency.\n\nModi was recently photographed with Russian President Vladimir Putin and Chinese President Xi Jinping during a security summit in Tianjin, in northern China. That led to a social media jab from Trump.\n\nâLooks like weâve lost India and Russia to deepest, darkest, China,â Trump wrote. âMay they have a long and prosperous future together!â\n\nBut Trump has taken a warmer tack with Modi recently.\n\nLast week, Trump offered hope that trade issues with India could be resolved.\n\nâI am pleased to announce that India, and the United States of America, are continuing negotiations to address the Trade Barriers between our two Nations,â Trump said in a post on Truth Social.\n\nâI look forward to speaking with my very good friend, Prime Minister Modi, in the upcoming weeks. I feel certain that there will be no difficulty in coming to a successful conclusion for both of our Great Countries!â\n\nTrump hit India with tariffs up to 50% last month after imposing an additional 25% tariff on the country related to its purchases of Russian oil, which helps Moscow pay for its war in Ukraine.\n\nTrump hosted Modi for White House talks in February.","summary":"The U.S. and Pakistan reached an agreement to develop Pakistan's oil reserves and lower tariffs.","url":"https://www.twincities.com/2025/09/25/united-states-pakistan/","image":"https://www.twincities.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Trump_US_Pakistan_77871.jpg?w=1600&resize=1600,900","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-09-25 23:43:20","author":"Associated Press","authors":["Associated Press"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.062},{"id":363534732,"title":"Michael Che reveals Kanye West apologized for his âSNLâ rant","text":"Michael Che is opening up about his backstage confrontation with Kanye West.\n\nThe comedian, 42, got candid about the rapperâs Donald Trump rant that happened on a âSaturday Night Liveâ episode in 2018.\n\nDuring the closing credits, West, who now goes by Ye, 48, gave an impromptu rant about why he wears a Make America Great Again hat and how the liberal media criticizes Donald Trump while also accusing Black comedians of making jokes about Bill Cosby.\n\nAt the end of his speech, the rapper alleged that the cast and crew bullied him backstage.\n\nâWhen that happened, and he made it seem like we was bullying him, I was like, âWhy would you say that?â Like, what happened that you felt that way?â Che recalled of his conversation with Ye while on SiriusXMâs âThe Bonfireâ on Thursday.\n\nTheir tense exchange was featured in the unauthorized Ye documentary, âIn Whose Name.â\n\nThe documentary showed Che asking Ye, âWhy you gotta call me out on the fâkinâ [stage] if I donât got a chance to say anything for myself?

I had no place to really go.â\n\nâHeâs coming out the elevator bay, and as soon as he sees me, he goes, âI owe you an apology,'â he noted. âAnd I hadnât seen him in years. I didnât even know if he remembered that that happened because he was saying so much. And he was like, âI owe you an apology.â And we talked and I never brought it up again.â\n\nBefore his rant, which was caught by Chris Rock, Che felt like something was off with Ye.\n\nâIt didnât seem like he was his normal self,â he admitted. âBecause heâd been at the show a million times. So it seemed like he was kind of not behaving like himself. So we were just like, âWhatâs going on?â We were trying very hard.â\n\nThe Post reached out to Yeâs rep for comment. \n\nâIn Whose Name?â offers an inside look at West during the past several years of his life, where things have taken a tumultuous turn for the A-lister.\n\nDirected by first-time filmmaker Nico Ballesteros, the unauthorized doc follows the artist across six years and 3,000 hours of footage. The final cut was ultimately edited down to 106 minutes.\n\nThe filming began in 2018 and ended in 2024, and was mostly shot on iPhones.\n\nâIn Whose Name?â shared Yeâs battle with bipolar disorder, the breakdown of his marriage to Kim Kardashian and the fallout from his antisemitic remarks about going âdeath con 3â on Jewish people in 2022.\n\nAt one point, Kardashianâs mom, Kris Jenner, and Ye got into a heated conversation about the rapper not taking his medication.\n\nâYâall demasculated me and made me feel like a piece of sât.

Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., broadcast mixed signals on Thursday with his message to one of the TV providers preempting \"Jimmy Kimmel Live!\" Nexstar Media Group announced Wednesday it would continue to preempt late-night host Jimmy Kimmel from its ABC affiliate stations after Disney lifted his suspension following his controversial comments about the Charlie Kirk assassination. Nexstar's station in Burlington, Vt., is among those not airing Kimmel. \"Decisions about what Americans watch shouldn't be dictated by political pressure,\" Sanders wrote on X. \"Nexstar must immediately restore Jimmy Kimmel to viewers in Vermont and across the U.S. Broadcasters should not cave in to an authoritarian-type president who canât accept criticism.\" JIMMY KIMMEL'S LATE-NIGHT EVOLUTION FROM APOLITICAL FUNNYMAN TO DEM ACTIVIST Critics quickly accused Sanders of not living by his own words. \"Government officials bullying media companies is wrong and thatâs why a U.S. Senator is here to bully media companies,\" conservative X personality Sunny reacted. DEMOCRATIC SENATORS PROBE NEXSTAR, SINCLAIR OVER JIMMY KIMMEL, WARN BENCHING COULD RUN âAFOUL OF FEDERAL LAWâ \"Youâre applying political pressure, Bernie,\" Red State writer Bonchie told the senator. Included in his X post was a letter Sanders sent to Nexstar CEO Perry Sook decrying how his constituents were unable to see Kimmel's monologue on television Tuesday night and had to watch it online instead. \"Decisions about what Vermonters and the American people can and cannot watch on television should not be dictated by political pressure from President Donald Trump, his hand-picked Federal Communications Commission Chair (Brendan Carr), or any other government official, regardless of their ideology,\" Sanders told Sook. \"The role of a broadcaster is to serve the public interest - not politicians who seek to silence and censor criticis and comedians who they do not like.\" Sanders went on to call the move \"un-American\" and a \"dangerous precedent for censorship of the media and political speech.\" He also suggested that Nexstar's battle with Kimmel is tied to the company's forthcoming $6 billion merger with Tegna. Neither representatives for Sanders nor Nexstar responded to Fox News Digital's requests for comment. THESE MAJOR MARKETS WON'T BE AIRING ABC'S âJIMMY KIMMEL LIVE!â FOR NOW Nexstar and Sinclair Broadcast Group are continuing to preempt \"Jimmy Kimmel Live!\" on their ABC stations, totaling more than 60 around the country, roughly a fifth of all ABC stations. Kimmel drew intense backlash after he falsely insinuated that Tyler Robinson, the 22-year-old suspect in the Kirk assassination, was part of the \"MAGA gang\" despite reports he had a left-wing ideology, which was reaffirmed in the indictment filed the next day. \"We hit some new lows over the weekend with the MAGA gang desperately trying to characterize this kid who murdered Charlie Kirk as anything other than one of them and doing everything they can to score political points from it,\" Kimmel told his audience last week. ROSEANNE BARR BLASTS âDOUBLE STANDARDâ AS JIMMY KIMMEL RETURNS TO LATE-NIGHT SHOW AFTER SUSPENSION After being sidelined by Disney, Kimmel returned to his show on Tuesday to give an emotional monologue, though stopping short of offering an explicit apology. Fox News Digital previously reported that Nexstar and Sinclair wanted a \"sincere\" apology before allowing his show to air. \"It was never my intention to make light of the murder of a young man,\" Kimmel said as he tearfully choked up. \"Nor was it my intention to blame a specific group for the actions of what was obviously a deeply disturbed individualâ¦ I don't think the murderer who shot Charlie Kirk represents anyone. This was a sick person who believed violence was the solution. And it isn't. Ever.\" The following day, Nexstar and Sinclair decided to continue preempting Kimmel's show. Kirk's supporters panned Kimmel's walk-back attempt, many of them calling out the ABC host for not owning up to the falsehood. \"Kimmel is an unrepentant liar who tried to blame Charlieâs assassination on the part of the country that just spent the last 2 weeks praying and holding vigils,\" Turning Point USA spokesman Andrew Kolvet reacted. \"What heâs really saying is that he still thinks itâs fair game to slander conservatives. He would rather advance his own political and cultural agenda than confront the truth. The truth is that his own side has been fanning the flames of political assassinations for years. The truth is that someone on the left picked up a gun and murdered someone on the right who advocated for peaceful debate. Itâs critical that liars admit they lied. There can be no restoration without that. Anything short of that is a fake and scripted cry line designed to endear him to his fans, not to make right the wrong he committed.\" \"Itâs critical that liars admit they lied.

But the additional tariffs risk intensifying inflation that is already elevated, as well as slowing economic growth, as employers getting acclimated to Trumpâs previous import taxes grapple with new levels of uncertainty.\n\nâWe have begun to see goods prices showing through into higher inflation,â Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell warned in a recent news conference, adding that higher costs for goods account for âmostâ or potentially âallâ of the increase in inflation levels this year.\n\nTrump said on Truth Social that the pharmaceutical tariffs would not apply to companies that are building manufacturing plants in the United States, which he defined as either âbreaking groundâ or being âunder construction.â It was unclear how the tariffs would apply to companies that already have factories in the U.S.\n\nIn 2024, America imported nearly $233 billion in pharmaceutical and medicinal products, according to the Census Bureau. The prospect of prices doubling for some medicines could send shock waves to voters as health care expenses, as well as the costs of Medicare and Medicaid, potentially increase.\n\nTrump said that foreign manufacturers of furniture and cabinetry were flooding the United States with their products and that tariffs must be applied âfor National Security and other reasons.â The new tariffs on cabinetry could further increase the costs for homebuilders at a time when many people seeking to buy a house feel priced out by the mix of housing shortages and high mortgage rates.\n\nTrump said that foreign-made heavy trucks and parts are hurting domestic producers.\n\nâLarge Truck Company Manufacturers, such as Peterbilt, Kenworth, Freightliner, Mack Trucks, and others, will be protected from the onslaught of outside interruptions,â Trump posted.\n\nTrump has long maintained that tariffs are the key to forcing companies to invest more in domestic factories. He has dismissed fears that importers would simply pass along much of the cost of the taxes to consumers and businesses in the form of higher prices.\n\nThe president continues to claim that inflation is no longer a challenge for the U.S. economy, despite evidence to the contrary. The consumer price index has increased 2.9% over the past 12 months, up from an annual pace of 2.3% in April, when Trump first launched a sweeping set of import taxes.\n\nNor is there evidence that the tariffs are creating factory jobs or more construction of manufacturing facilities. Since April, the Bureau of Labor Statistics has reported that manufacturers cut 42,000 jobs and builders have downsized by 8,000.\n\nâThereâs no inflation,â Trump told reporters Thursday. âWeâre having unbelievable success.â","summary":"Pharmaceutical tariffs would not apply to companies building manufacturing plants in the U.S., Trump said.","url":"https://www.twincities.com/2025/09/25/trump-tariffs-cabinets-furniture-trucks/","image":"https://www.twincities.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Trump_US_Turkey_20183.jpg?w=1024&h=682","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-09-25 23:34:20","author":"Associated Press","authors":["Associated Press"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.154},{"id":363528360,"title":"Trump to put import taxes on kitchen cabinets, furniture and heavy trucks starting next week","text":"By Josh Boak, Associated Press\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) â President Donald Trump said Thursday that he will put import taxes of 50% on kitchen cabinets and bathroom vanities, 30% on upholstered furniture and 25% on heavy trucks starting on Oct. 1.\n\nTrump said on his social media site that foreign manufacturers of furniture and cabinetry were flooding the United States with their products and that tariffs must be applied âfor National Security and other reasons.â\n\nTrump said that foreign-made heavy trucks and parts are hurting domestic producers.","summary":"Trump said that foreign-made heavy trucks and parts are hurting domestic producers.","url":"https://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/2025/09/25/trump-tariffs-cabinets-furniture-trucks/","image":"https://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Trump_US_Turkey_20183.jpg?w=150&strip=all","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-09-25 23:34:20","author":"Associated Press,Gqlshare","authors":["Associated Press","Gqlshare"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.072},{"id":363529366,"title":"China launches trade investigation into Mexicoâs planned tariff hike","text":"Chinaâs Commerce Ministry has initiated a trade investigation into the higher tariffs and other restrictive measures Mexico plans to impose on Chinese products, primarily automobiles, auto parts, textiles and toys.\n\nThe ministry said in a statement that the tariffs will harm Chinese companies and undermine investor confidence in Mexico. It warns that they could also threaten the security of the Mexican business environment. \n\nThe investigation, which may last up to six months, will examine both tariffs and other trade and investment restrictions.\n\nâChina believes that faced with the abuse of tariffs by the United States, all countries should jointly oppose unilateralism and protectionism in any form,â a spokesperson from Chinaâs Commerce Ministry said. âNo party should sacrifice the interests of third countries under the coercion of another.â \n\nThe ministry also initiated anti-dumping investigations into pecan imports from Mexico and the United States, an apparent threat at retaliation.\n\nLast week, Mexico announced plans to raise duties to up to 50% on cars and other products made in China and other Asian countries with which it does not have a free trade agreement. \n\nThe move follows mounting pressure from U.S. President Donald Trump to introduce tariffs on China, although President Claudia Sheinbaum has said that the proposed tariffs neither target China nor are the result of U.S. pressure. \n\nEarlier this month, Beijing issued a stern warning urging Mexico to reconsider. \n\nChina, which the government says is the largest exporter to Mexico without a trade agreement, would be severely affected by the proposed tariffs. This is especially true for its automotive sector, whose sales to Mexico grew nearly 10% in 2024.\n\nTrade between Mexico and China exceeded US $137 billion in 2024. In the absence of a trade agreement, the countriesâ bilateral trade relationship is governed by the framework established by the World Trade Organization (WTO) and specific provisions of Mexicoâs Â¿f Economy Ministry.\n\nWith reports from Bloomberg, El Economista and El Financiero","summary":"In pushing back against Mexico's planned tariff hike, China has accused Mexico of bowing to Trump â but President Sheinbaum says that's not true.\n\n\nThe post China launches trade investigation into Mexicoâs planned tariff hike appeared first on Mexico News Daily","url":"https://mexiconewsdaily.com/news/china-launches-trade-investigation/","image":"https://mexiconewsdaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/meric-dagli-45pSpeUe7lo-unsplash.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-09-25 23:34:02","author":"MND Staff","authors":["MND Staff"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"mx","sentiment":-0.16},{"id":363524940,"title":"â100 percent MAGAâ: Huge change to app","text":"Deals of the Week\n1:31AMFriday, September 26th, 2025\n\nIn the know quiz\n\nSet your local weather \n\nBreaking News\n\nCourts & Law\n\nCourts & Law\n\nCourts & Law\n\nCourts & Law\n\nSouth Australia\n\nWestern Australia\n\nNorthern Territory\n\nBreaking News\n\nNorth America\n\nUS Politics\n\nSouth America\n\nMiddle East\n\nUK Politics\n\nHealth Problems\nMental Health\n\nInspiration\nWeight Loss\n\nSchool Life\n\nRestaurants & Bars\nFood Warnings\n\nRelationships\n\nThe Sealed Section\n\nFamily & Friends\n\nFashion Shows\n\nFashion Trends\n\nFace & Body\nCosmetic Surgery\n\nTrue Stories\n\nLifestyle Videos\n\nTravel Ideas\n\nShort Breaks\n\nFood & Drinks\n\nDestinations\n\nNorth America\n\nNew Zealand\n\nMiddle East\nCentral America\nSouth America\n\nTravel Advice\n\nTips & Tricks\n\nAccommodation\n\nAustralian Holidays\n\nNorthern Territory\n\nSouth Australia\n\nWestern Australia\n\nTravel Videos\nEntertainment\n\nCelebrity Life\n\nHook Ups & Break ups\nCelebrity Photos\nCelebrity Kids\nCelebrity Deaths\n\nCelebrity Style\n\nMorning Shows\nCurrent Affairs\n\nUpcoming Movies\n\nMovies Reviews\n\nMusic Festivals\n\nBooks & Magazines\n\nGolden Globes\n\nEntertainment Videos\n\nSocial Media\n\nMobile Phones\n\nHome Entertainment\n\nArchaeology\n\nEnvironment\n\nClimate Change\nSustainability\nNatural Wonders\n\nMotoring News\n\nOn the Road\n\nTechnology Videos\n\nCost of Living\n\nHow to Save\n\nSalary Secrets\nPersonal Finance\n\nSuperannuation\n\nAustralian Culture\nPower & Influence\n\nInside Parliament\n\nGig Economy\n\nBreaking News\n\nManufacturing\n\nOther Industries\n\nAustralian Economy\nWorld Economy\nInterest Rates\nFederal Budget\n\nAustralian Markets\nWorld Markets\nAustralian Dollar\nCryptocurrency\n\nReal Estate\n\nSydney & NSW\nMelbourne & VIC\nAdelaide & SA\n\nCricket Live Scores\n\nV8 Supercars\n\nSports Life\n\nAmerican Sports\n\nParalympics\n\nHorse Racing\n\nExpert Opinion\n\nMore Sports\n\nSport Videos\n\nSales & Deals\n\nHome & Appliances\n\nHealth & Wellbeing\n\nNorth America\nUs Politics\n\nUS politics live: Donald Trump approves huge change to TikTok that could affect the appâs algorithm for users\nThe millions of people who use TikTok could see changes to their algorithm as a result of a new deal announced by Donald Trump.\nBenedict Brook in the US and Samuel Clench\n\nless than 2 min read\nSeptember 26, 2025 - 8:28AM\n\nShare via Email\n\nShare on Facebook\n\nShare on Whatsapp\n\nCopied URL to clipboard\n\nAlbanese furious at reporter's Trump question\n\nAlbanese furious at reporter's Trump question\n\n#auspol #trump #un #unitednations\n\nAnthony Albanese has hit out at a reporter over a...\n\nSep 26, 2025\n\n'100 per cent MAGA': Trump asked about TikTok's algorithm\n\nSep 25, 2025\n\nTrump approves plan to 'save' TikTok\n\nOdd route taken by Netanyahu to US raises questions\n\nHundreds of US military officers ordered to DC for rare meeting\n\n'Stop': Trump's blunt demand of world leader\n\nMore Highlights\n\nWelcome to our coverage of politics in the United States.\nDonald Trump has formally approved a restructuring of TikTok, which will see a group of American investors hold a majority stake in the company.\nIts Chinese parent company ByteDance, and its affiliates, will only own a bit under 20 per cent.

I couldnât even get through my first sentence of the day, in that previous post, without a typo, which doesnât exactly bode well. But we trundle on.\n\nWhile speaking to reporters in the Oval Office, Donald Trump was asked whether the restructuring of TikTok, which will see some of his own quite wealthy allies control its algorithm, might lead to the app becoming more pro-MAGA.\n\nâNow that Americans will have operational control, do you want to see the algorithm suggest more MAGA-related content?â a reporter asked.\n\nâI always love MAGA-releated.

D.C. abolished capital punishment back in 1981, though, so the legality of all this is tricky.\n\nThis happened during his aforementioned Oval Office appearance, where he signed a few executive orders in front of the media. The routine is: a staffer hands Mr Trump and order, and explains what it is to him. Then he signs it, and holds it up for the photographers. Rinse and repeat.\n\nâOK, you understand?â the President said after the stafferâs explanation.\n\nâDeath penalty in Washington. You kill somebody, or if you kill a police officer, law enforcement officer, death penalty.\n\nSep 25, 2025\n\n HIGHLIGHT \n\nTrump approves plan to 'save' TikTok\n\nSamuel Clench\n\nGood morning! Weâve made it to Friday with the world largely intact.\n\nDonald Trump has formally approved a restructuring of TikTok, which will see a group of American investors hold a majority stake in the company. Its Chinese parent company ByteDance, and its affiliates, will only own a bit under 20 per cent. Operations will now be overseen by a board based in America, as well, further diminishing Chinaâs power over the app.\n\nAmericaâs Congress passed a law banning TikTok back in January, before Donald Trump took office, but he then delayed its implementation multiple times while the divestiture was being negotiated.

At this point, flying north west over Spain and France would have made sense. But instead, the plane changed direction to the south west avoiding the territories of France, Spain and Portugal altogether.\n\nIt passed through the narrow Straits of Gibraltar that separates Europe and Africa, narrowly avoiding not just Spanish but also British and Moroccan territory too.\n\nSep 25, 2025\n\n HIGHLIGHT \n\nHundreds of US military officers ordered to DC for rare meeting\n\nBenedict Brook\n\nUS Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth has summoned potentially hundreds of senior military officers from around the world to Washington DC next week for a meeting, the reason of which has yet to be disclosed.\n\nThe Washington Post has reported on the diktat which is said to be extremely rare.\n\nWhile senior military officers head to Washington several times year, it is uncommon for so many to arrive at once.\n\nâThe Secretary of War will be addressing his senior military leaders early next week,â Pentagon spokesperson Sean Parnell said. \n\nSep 25, 2025\n\n HIGHLIGHT \n\n'Stop': Trump's blunt demand of world leader\n\nBenedict Brook\n\nDonald Trump has bluntly told his Turkish counterpart to âstop buying any oil from Russiaâ when he met home at the White House.\n\nRecep Tayyip Erdogan is in Washington DC to meet with Mr Trump. Turkey is a key member of NATO but also sees itself as a bridge to Russia.\n\nIn recent weeks while Mr Trump has hardened his stance on Russia, he has said he will only put more sanctions on Moscow if European and NATO countries stop buying oil from iota indirectly funding its war on Ukraine.\n\nEurope no buys vastly less oil and gas from Russia since Vladimir Putin invaded Ukraine. But there are some holdouts, including Turkey.\n\nSep 25, 2025\n\nTrump: 'Close to a deal' on Gaza\n\nBenedict Brook\n\nDonald Trump has said he is âclose to a dealâ on ending the war on Gaza. \n\nHe spoke about the conflict in a meeting with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan in the White House on Thursday, US time.\n\nUS President Donald Trump, right, speaks during a meeting with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan in the Oval Office of the White House, Thursday, Sept. 25, 2025, in Washington. (AP Photo/Evan Vucci)\n\nDuring his United Nations speech on Monday, Mr Trump called for the war in Gaza to end âimmediatelyâ and for the around 20 living hostages, and perhaps double the amount of bodies of hostages, to be released. \n\nHe also met a collection of Arab leaders and presented a possible peace plan.\n\nSep 25, 2025\n\n HIGHLIGHT \n\nTrump says he's 'allowed' to intervene in court cases\n\nBenedict Brook\n\nDonald Trump has said heâd âbe allowed to get involvedâ in a government prosecution of one of his foes, but chooses not to.\n\nItâs another sign of the blurring of boundaries between President Trumpâs desires and what is supposed to be distance between him and government departments so they are not clouded by accusations of bias.\n\nDonald Trump really doesnât like former FBI director James Comey.(AP Photo/Andrew Harnik, File)\n\nThe Department of Justice, for instance, is supposed to decide for itself who to prosecute based on the evidence at hand â not cave to demands from the president of the time.\n\nBut Mr Trump has increasingly called on people he doesnât like or who have investigated him to be investigated themselves. \n\nSep 25, 2025\n\n HIGHLIGHT \n\nTrump won't let Israel annex occupied West Bank\n\nBenedict Brook\n\nDonald Trump has reportedly told Arab leaders he wonât let Israel annex the West Bank.\n\nIsrael already militarily occupies the West Bank, a predominantly Palestinian populated region between Israel and Jordan. The Palestinian Authority has some control over parts of the West Bank although this is at the behest of Israel.\n\nIsrael has consistently added settlements in the West Bank for Jewish people to move into many of whom believe they have a right to the land.\n\nThe government of Israel President Benjamin Netanyahu include far right wing ministers who have called for Israel to absorb the West Bank completely. But Palestinians see the West Bank, Gaza and east Jerusalem as the core of a Palestinian state\n\nSep 25, 2025\n\n HIGHLIGHT \n\nVP brushes off government pressure to sack Kimmel\n\nSamuel Clench\n\nAnother few quotes from Vice President J.D.

Ryan Easley, 37, sadly lost his life on Saturday after being attacked by a tiger at his Growler Pines Tiger Preserve, as stated in a Facebook post. TMZ reports that Easley suffered bites to the neck and shoulder area from the tiger before being violently shaken. Since the horrifying incident, the tiger has been confined to a single cage and will not be permitted to leave until an investigation into the attack is completed.

We all take risks in what we do and we don't need further laws to ban tigers because of this because you can get killed doing just about anything.\" Maldonado-Passage, currently serving a 21-year sentence for plotting to murder Big Cat Rescue founder Carole Baskin, also hit out at PETA, the animal rights organisation, for alleging that the tigers were crammed into small cages, branding the claims as \"total b---t. \"In the early years when I knew Ryan, he wanted to be the one with the most tigers in the ring at one time,\" Maldonado-Passage penned, expressing his fears that his associate \"was going to get killed because some of his cats were crazy in the head but it was about having the most performing at one time at all costs. \"Regardless of whether you agree with how another runs their business, a loss is always something no one wants to see. So with all my respect as a human RIP Ryan Easley. You died doing what you loved,\" he concluded. PETA condemned Easley's facility, labelling it a \"roadside zoo\" and accusing the company of transporting tigers \"around the country\" while forcing animals \"to perform in cruel circuses. \"It's never safe for humans to interact directly with apex predators, and it's never a surprise when a human is attacked by a stressed big cat who has been caged, whipped, and denied everything natural and important to them,\" stated Debbie Matzler, PETA Foundation Senior Director of Captive Wildlife. \"PETA is calling for the remaining wild animal exhibitors who aren't dead or in federal prison to get out of the business now and send the animals to accredited sanctuaries where they can finally live in peace,\" she concluded. Similarly, Humane World for Animals, formerly known as the Humane Society of the United States, disclosed in a Sunday statement that one of their investigators had spent weeks undercover with ShowMe Tigers, witnessing the creatures being forced to perform tricks. \"Ryan Easley's death was a sad and preventable tragedy,\" the organisation stated. Easley's preserve functions as a private facility where visitors can book tours to view tigers and witness demonstrations on how the animals are trained and cared for, according to its website. Following the tragic incident, all tours and encounters have been suspended until further notice.","summary":"Joe Exotic has paid tribute to his associate Ryan Easley, who was mauled to death by a tiger at his Growler Pines Tiger Preserve in Oklahoma, saying 'no one can blame the tiger'","url":"https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/world-news/joe-exotics-emotional-tribute-associate-35968160","image":"https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/article35968159.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200b/2_FILES-US-ENTERTAINMENT-TELEVISION-NETFLIX-TIGERKING.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-09-25 23:30:11","author":"Maria Villarroel,Paige Ingram","authors":["Maria Villarroel","Paige Ingram"],"language":"en","source_country":"GB","sentiment":-0.167},{"id":363530952,"title":"Musk and Trump unite again as relationship warms, this time for Grok to help manage federal properties","text":"President Donald Trump and Elon Musk are seemingly back on track to rekindle their relationship, after the administration announced it would be using the billionaireâs AI chatbot Grok for the management of federal properties.\n\nIn a press release Thursday, the U.S. General Services Administration announced a major partnership with Muskâs xAI â âGrok for Governmentâ â making the companyâs AI models accessible to federal agencies for $0.42 per organization. \n\nThe âunique offerâ will stretch for 18 months until March 2027 and is the longest term for such an agreement, the GSA said. The deal includes access to Grok 4 and Grok 4 Fast, xAIâs advanced reasoning models. \n\nIt comes just less than four months after the explosive bust up between Trump and Musk in June, which culminated in a fiery online exchange, with both men slinging insults at each other from their respective social media platforms, Truth Social and X.\n\nBut the pair was recently pictured chatting and shaking hands at the funeral of MAGA commentator Charlie Kirk in Arizona. Trump later did not appear particularly moved by the meeting, but told reporters it was âniceâ Musk had attended.\n\nOn Thursday, any real animosity appeared to be in the past, with Musk declaring: âThanks to President Trump and his administration, xAIâs frontier AI is now unlocked for every federal agency empowering the U.S. Government to innovate faster and accomplish its mission more effectively than ever before,â \n\nâWe look forward to continuing to work with President Trump and his team to rapidly deploy AI throughout the government for the benefit of the country.â\n\nxAI cofounder Ross Nordeen added âWe will work hand in glove with the entire government to not only deploy AI, but to deeply understand the needs of our government to make America the world leader in advanced use of AI.â\n\nThe company will also deliver introductory training programs, custom enablement over time, and work with agencies to facilitate secure integration, the GSA press release said.\n\nâWidespread access to advanced AI models is essential to building the efficient, accountable government that taxpayers deserve â and to fulfilling President Trumpâs promise that America will win the global AI race,â said Federal Acquisition Service Commissioner Josh Gruenbaum. âWe value xAI for partnering with GSA â and dedicating engineersâto accelerate the adoption of Grok to transform government operations.â\n\nSpeaking to Fox News Digital, Gruenbaum added that xAI \"stood out\" as a strong partner that offers \"world class technical talentâ in the AI race between the U.S. and China.\n\n\"This technology could be as transformative as the internet, maybe more,\" Gruenbaum said. \"Right now, weâre in the human-augmentation phase, but soon agents will be able to handle tasks more independently.â\n\nThe agreement between xAI and the government is effective immediately, and federal agencies can begin leveraging the benefits of Grok AI models through GSAâs established procurement channels, the GSA said.","summary":"It comes just less than four months after the explosive bust up between Trump and Musk in June, which culminated in a fiery online exchange","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/trump-musk-relationship-grok-ai-b2833983.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/09/22/15/35/Charlie-Kirk-Memorial-05ifiye4.jpeg?width=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/k9bb89cY-4VHSaSK0.mp4","publish_date":"2025-09-25 23:28:24","author":"Mike Bedigan","authors":["Mike Bedigan"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.063},{"id":363539564,"title":"'Utter bulldust': Aussie billionaire hammers Trump over climate change","text":"Australian billionaire Andrew \"Twiggy\" Forrest has slammed Donald Trump's \"bulldust\" on climate change, ï»¿insinuating the US president is too sheltered to understand the reality of it.\n\n\"Across America, people are not venting what they tell me in private, and it's just so sad,\" Forrest told Today.\n\n\"You've got to be able to speak truth to power.

DURING THE CAMPAIGN THEY HAD A HAT -- A BEST SELLING HAT -- 'NEWSOM WAS RIGHT ABOUT EVERYTHING,'\" he wrote. \"AND I DONâT SAY THAT IN A BRAGGADOCIOS WAY, BUT ITâS TRUE.

The steak brand's trademark was discontinued in 2014. \n\nTrump also offered a \"university\" under the name \"Trump University\" beginning in 2004. It wasn't an accredited university, offered no college credits, degrees, or grades, and was investigated by the New York Attorney General's Office and later sued by the AG for illegal business practices in 2013. \n\nThe right-leaning National Review called the university a \"massive scam,\" and two class action lawsuits were filed by former students who claimed Trump's organization defrauded them through misleading marketing. \n\nTrump went on to settle all three lawsuits in November 2016 amid his first presidential run.","summary":"California Governor Gavin Newsom has been adopting President Trumpâs posting style to mock him for weeks","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/newsom-trump-wine-vodka-b2833967.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/09/20/21/46/SEI264370772.jpg?width=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/uL9Wx7gM-OhrQWqOm.mp4","publish_date":"2025-09-25 23:27:53","author":"Graig Graziosi","authors":["Graig Graziosi"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.122},{"id":363529324,"title":"U.S. Fighter Jets Track Russian Warplanes Near Alaska as NATO Tensions Rise: What to Know","text":"NATO allies have been debating how to deal with multiple Russian incursions into member countriesâ airspace this month. \n\nOn Tuesday, President Donald Trump called for NATO countries to shoot down Russian planes that violate their airspace.\n\nNATO Secretary General Mark Rutte backed Trumpâs comments on Thursday, saying countries in the military alliance should shoot down Russian planes entering their airspace if other options have been exhausted and it is deemed necessary.\n\nThe remarks come after three Russian jets entered Estoniaâs airspace for a total of 12 minutes last week without permission, according to the Estonian government.

First, an escalator stopped working just as he and Melania Trump stepped onto it to carry them upstairs. Then during his speech, the teleprompter cut out.

Technical malfunctions happen all the time! Well, turns out one person at Fox News is FUMING over it. And for revenge, he wants to âbombâ the whole building!\n\nDuring Tuesdayâs episode of The Five, Jesse Watters went off about the malfunctioning technology, claiming the UN âsabotagedâ the President with the escalator incident:\n\nâAnd they couldâve hurt the first lady. Trump wouldâve fallen and gotten back up â¦ And then they sabotaged the teleprompter. I mean this is an insurrection and what we need to do is either leave the UN, or we need to bomb it.â\n\nThe sentiment silenced the room as his co-hosts took a moment to reactâ¦ before ultimately breaking out in laughter. Co-host Greg Gutfeld remarked, âInteresting.â But Watters wasnât done thereâ¦ He proposed another plan of attack to reduce âfalloutâ in the crowded city:\n\nâIt is in New York though, right? Could be some fallout there. Maybe gas it?â\n\nOthers in the room werenât quite on board as one quipped, âNo,â while Dana Perino remarked off camera:\n\nâLetâs not do that.â\n\nContributor Emily Compagno nervously added:\n\nâOh my goodness. Heâs kidding, heâs kidding.â\n\nHowever, Watters persisted:\n\nâBut we need to destroy it. Can we demolish the building? Have everybody leave, and then weâll demolish the building.â\n\nHe then suggested the location be used for ânice skyrisesâ to hold âexpensive condominiumsâ instead. He concluded:\n\nâThis is absolutely unacceptable and I hope they get to the bottom of it, and I hope they really injure â emotionally â the people that did it.â\n\nWatch the clip (below):\n\nFox News host Jesse Watters suggested bombing and gassing the United Nations over escalator and teleprompter issues pic.twitter.com/uvJImMG17w\nâ PatriotTakes ???????? (@patriottakes) September 23, 2025\n\nBut Watters wasnât the only one furious over the escalator not working.\n\nFollowing his speech, Trump took to Truth Social to criticize the âtriple sabotage,â which also apparently included a sound system mishap:\n\nâA REAL DISGRACE took place at the United Nations yesterday â Not one, not two, but three very sinister events! This wasnât a coincidence, this was triple sabotage at the UN. They ought to be ashamed of themselves â¦ No wonder the United Nations hasnât been able to do the job that they were put in existence to do.â\n\nBy Wednesday, Trump called for the arrest of those responsible for the mishaps. He wrote on the site:\n\nâItâs amazing that Melania and I didnât fall forward onto the sharp edges of these steel steps, face first. It was only that we were each holding the handrail tightly or, it would have been a disaster.â\n\nWattersâ co-workers made clear he was joking about his comments. No one was there to say that about Trumpâs post. The President of the United States was calling for the jailing of UN workers he believed tried to make him look bad.\n\nBut get thisâ¦ UN spokesperson Stephane Dujarric has since claimed that it was likely Trumpâs own people who accidentally turned off the escalator! After an internal probe, they now know a safety mechanism was triggered, and thatâs why the escalator stopped suddenly. Apparently a videographer from Trumpâs camp ran ahead, and they believe heâs the one who triggered the emergency stop:\n\nâThe safety mechanism is designed to prevent people or objects accidentally being caught and stuck in or pulled into the gearing. The videographer may have inadvertently triggered the safety function.â\n\nRead more (below):\n\n????UN conducted probe into Trump escalator situation\nâA subsequent investigation, including a readout of the machine's central processing unit, indicated that the escalator had stopped after a built-in safety mechanism on the comb step was triggered at the top of the escalator.â pic.twitter.com/inHeHPbo00\nâ Farnoush Amiri (@FarnoushAmiri) September 24, 2025\n\nAnd as far as the teleprompter situation goes, an anonymous UN figure claimed that it was the White Houseâs people operating the systemâ¦ Not the UN. Apparently everyone is expected to bring their own teleprompter team. The White House told NPR they werenât given as much time as expected to set up the teleprompter before Trumpâs speech â and were left âtrying to set the teleprompter up as the President was speaking.â\n\nIn the wake of the controversy, several figures have taken to X (Twitter) to sound off with their reactions.

It added that the meeting was held in a pleasant atmosphere.\n\nPhotos released after the meeting showed both PM Shehbaz and Field Marshal Munir exchanging views with Trump. Trump was also all smiles as he flashed his signature thumbs up sign during a group photo.\n\nThe meeting, which was closed to the press, was originally slated to begin at 4:30pm Washington time (1:30am PST) but was delayed by approximately 30 minutes as the US president spoke to reporters after signing executive orders. The meeting itself lasted approximately one hour and 20 minutes.\n\nPhotos from the White House press pool before it began showed PM Shehbaz and Field Marshal Munir waiting patiently on the Oval Officeâs gold-gilded furniture as, across the room, the US president wrapped up his previous engagement.\n\nThe army chief could also be seen speaking to White House staffers as media personnel packed up their equipment. When US Secretary of State Rubio entered the room, he could be seen enthusiastically greeting both leaders.\n\nThe visit, the first formal bilateral interaction between the two leaders, comes six years after former premier Imran Khan met Trump during the latterâs first term in July 2019.\n\nSpeaking to reporters before the meeting, Trump said that a âgreat leaderâ was coming to the White House.\n\nâWeâve got the prime minister of Pakistan coming and the field marshal â¦ [heâs] a great, great guy and so is the prime minister, both,â he told reporters.\n\nPresident Trump was also conscious of the delay, telling the media: âThey are coming and they may be in this room right now. I donât know because we are late.â\n\nThe meeting itself, however, was closed to the press â a break from Trumpâs usual modus operandi, as he is known for inviting select cameras and reporters into the Oval Office for photo-ops.\n\nRadio Pakistan reported earlier that the two were âexpected to discuss matters of mutual interest as well as regional and global situationâ.\n\nThe development comes as the premier is in the US for the 80th session of the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA) in New York. During his whirlwind tour, PM Shehbaz has attended UNGA sessions, a key multilateral summit of the Muslim bloc, as well as side meetings with the heads of international financial institutions in New York.\n\nThe premier will now make his way back to New York, as he is due to address the UN General Assembly on Friday.\n\nâPak-US ties gradually warming upâ\n\nEarlier, at a media briefing in New York, a senior State Department official told Dawn that ties between Washington and Islamabad were âgradually warming upâ in Trumpâs second term.\n\nFor years, the United States had viewed India as a counterweight to Chinaâs growing influence in Asia, while Pakistan was seen as a close Chinese ally.\n\nSince Trump returned to office in January 2025, US relations with India have come under strain over visa hurdles for Indians, steep tariffs imposed by Washington on Indian goods, and the presidentâs repeated claim that he personally brokered an India-Pakistan ceasefire in May following cross-border hostilities.\n\nThe senior official emphasised that US relations with Pakistan were not tied to its partnership with India.\n\nâWe have an independent relationship with Pakistan,â he said, recalling recent American investments worth hundreds of millions of dollars in Pakistanâs mineral sector, and noting continued US interest in petroleum exploration.\n\nResponding to a question, the official added that Washington was still reviewing the recently concluded defence deal between Pakistan and Saudi Arabia.\n\nOn July 31, the two countries announced a trade agreement under which the US imposed a 19 per cent tariff on Pakistani goods. Trump has yet to finalise a similar deal with India. Analysts note that in response to tensions with Washington, New Delhi has begun recalibrating its ties with China as a hedge.\n\nEarlier this year, Trump welcomed Field Marshal Munir to the White House â the first time a US president hosted Pakistanâs military leader without senior civilian officials present, underscoring the militaryâs central role in bilateral relations.\n\nâWeâre working through a number of issues when it comes to counterterrorism, when it comes to economic and trade ties,â the senior State Department official said when asked about Pakistan.\n\nâAnd so the president remains focused on advancing US interests in the region, that includes through engaging with Pakistan and their government leaders.â\n\nOn India, the official said Trump believed in being frank about frustrations in the relationship but still considered it strong. Washington, he added, continued to see New Delhi as âa good friend and partnerâ whose ties with the US would âdefine the 21st centuryâ.\n\nIslamabad has publicly backed Trump for the Nobel Peace Prize for his efforts to defuse tensions with India, even as it has condemned Israeli bombardments in Gaza, Qatar and Iran.\n\nPrime Minister Sharif also joined Trump on Tuesday in a meeting with leaders of several Muslim-majority countries, where the US president discussed Israelâs assault on Gaza and shared American peace proposals on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly.\n\nPM Shehbaz meets Bangladeshâs Yunus\n\nPrior to the meeting with Trump, PM Shehbaz also met Bangladeshâs chief adviser, Muhammad Yunus, in New York, according to state broadcaster Radio Pakistan.\n\nIn this meeting, the premier reaffirmed Pakistanâs commitment to strengthening âconstructive and forward-looking tiesâ with Bangladesh, rooted in mutual respect, trust and shared aspirations of regional peace and prosperity, the Radio Pakistan report said.\n\nThe two leaders reviewed the current state of Pakistan-Bangladesh bilateral relations, discussing ways to strengthen cooperation in areas including trade, regional connectivity and people-to-people exchanges, it added.\n\nFor his part, Yunus appreciated Pakistanâs initiative to deepen engagement and highlighted the importance of enhancing bilateral trade and cultural linkage, it said.\n\nAdditional input from Reuters","summary":"US President Donald Trump hosted Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and Chief of Army Staff (COAS) Field Marshal Asim Munir at the Oval Office in Washington, DC during the early hours of Friday morning.\n\n\nUS Vice President JD Vance and Secretary of State Marco Rubio were also present, a statement issued by the Prime Ministerâs Office (PMO) after the meeting said.

Trump has repeatedly signed orders that have allowed TikTok to keep operating in the U.S. as his administration tries to reach an agreement for the sale of the company.\n\nThe executive order itself is a declaration by the president that the proposed deal meets the security concerns laid out in that law. And it gives all negotiating parties an additional 120-day reprieve in order to finalize it.\n\nYoung people especially âreally wanted this to happen,â Trump said.\n\nAny major change to the popular video platform could have a huge impact on how Americans â particularly young adults and teenagers â consume information online.\n\nAbout 43% of U.S. adults under the age of 30 say they regularly get news from TikTok, higher than any other social media app including YouTube, Facebook and Instagram, according to a Pew Research Center report published Thursday.\n\nAsked if heâd want a U.S.-owned TikTok algorithm to suggest more content promoting his Make America Great Again movement, Trump said heâd make it â100% MAGAâ if he felt he could, but he intends for âevery philosophy, every policyâ to be âtreated right.â\n\nVance said the deal ensures that âAmerican investors will actually control the algorithmâ that determines the content seen on the social media app. He said more information about the deal will be revealed in the coming weeks.\n\n Who will control the new TikTok venture ? \n\nUnder the terms of the deal that have so far been revealed by the White House, the app will be spun off into a new U.S. joint venture owned by a consortium of American investors â including tech giant Oracle and investment firm Silver Lake Partners.\n\nThough the details have yet to be finalized, the investment groupâs controlling stake in the new venture would be around 80%. While ByteDance is expected to have a stake in the new venture, it would be less than 20% â a portion of the ownership reserved for foreign investors. The board running the new platform would be controlled by U.S. investors. ByteDance will be represented by one person on the board, but that individual will be excluded from any security-related matters.\n\nTikTokâs new owners include many whose business or political interests are tied to Trump, including Oracle co-founder Larry Ellison and Rupert Murdoch, raising questions about whether political influence will be exerted into the platform.\n\nAlthough he stepped down as Oracleâs CEO more than a decade ago, Ellison remains heavily involved as chairman and chief technology officer. Now 81, he could be in line to become a behind-the-scenes media power player, having already helped finance Skydanceâs recently completed merger with Paramount, a deal engineered by his son, David.\n\nTrump said Dell founder Michael Dell will also be an investor in the new venture.\n\nTikTok users could now âget the editorial policies of the people who now have control of the company,â said David Greene, civil liberties director of the Electronic Frontier Foundation. âIt wonât be 100% MAGA. The question is how it will treat criticism of him and people he likes.\"\n\n What we know about the algorithm powering t he platform \n\nThe recommendation algorithm that has steered millions of users into an endless stream of video shorts has been central in the security debate over TikTok. China previously maintained the algorithm must remain under Chinese control by law. But a U.S. regulation that Congress passed with bipartisan support said any divestment of TikTok must mean the platform cut ties with ByteDance.\n\nAmerican officials previously warned the algorithm â which is a complex system of rules and calculations that platforms use to deliver content to your feed â is vulnerable to manipulation by Chinese authorities, but no evidence has ever been presented by U.S. officials showing that China has attempted to do so.\n\nTrump's order says that a licensed copy of ByteDance's algorithm â \"retrained\" solely with U.S. data â will power the new U.S. version of the app. The joint venture will control and monitor the code and all content-moderation decisions. Administration officials say the retraining will nullify any risk of Chinese interference and influence.\n\nIt's not clear if the U.S. version of TikTok would be a different experience than what users in the rest of the world are used to. Any noticeable changes made to a social media platformâs service raises the risk of alienating its audience, said Jasmine Enberg, an analyst for the research firm eMarketer.\n\nIn a prime example of how a change of control can reshape a once-popular social media platform, billionaire Elon Musk triggered an almost immediate backlash after he completed his takeover of Twitter nearly three years ago.\n\nBut Musk made extremely visible changes, including changing its name to X, pulling back on its content moderation and adding exclusive features for paid subscribers. The changes that gradually occur while different data is fed into the U.S. copy of TikTokâs algorithm could be unnoticeable to most of its audience.\n\nâSocial media is just as much about the culture as it is the technology, and how users will take to new ownership and potentially a new version of the app is still an open question,â Enberg said.\n\n What motivated China to make this deal \n\nBeijing once called the demand that TikTok be spun off from its Chinese parent company an act of ârobbery,â but Chinese officials changed their tune as the U.S.-China trade war progressed.\n\nA TikTok deal would allow China to keep the ball rolling on trade negotiations, said Sun Yun, director of the China program at the Washington-based think tank Stimson Center. âTikTok alone does not compare with the importance of amicable U.S.-China relations.â\n\nDimitar Gueorguiev, associate professor of political science at Syracuse University, argues that Beijing is more interested in retaining access to U.S. technology and services, at least in the short term, so it can build up self-sufficiency in semiconductor, artificial intelligence and advanced manufacturing.\n\nâThat is the front line of technological competition,â Gueorguiev said. âTikTok, by contrast, is a maturing consumer app with diminishing strategic weight.â","summary":"President Donald Trump has signed an executive order declaring that a proposed deal allowing TikTok to continue operating in the United States will be a qualified sale that meets national security concerns laid out by the law","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/tiktok-donald-trump-bytedance-china-jd-vance-b2834013.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/09/26/00/Trump_24983.jpg?width=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-09-25 23:19:32","author":"Associated Press","authors":["Associated Press"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.021},{"id":363540798,"title":"Former FBI Director James Comey Indicted on 2 Counts","text":"Former FBI Director James Comey has been indicted on one count of making false statements and one count of obstruction of justice.\n\nThe charges were brought after the Trump administration replaced the U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia, Erik Siebert, with White House aide Lindsey Halligan, who sought an immediate indictment from the grand jury before the statute of limitations could expire next Tuesday.\n\nWithout mentioning Comey by name, Attorney General Pam Bondi declared in a post on X that the indictment serves to prove âno one is above the law.â\n\nâNo one is above the law.

Prosecutors were evaluating whether Comey lied to Congress during testimony on Sept. 30, 2020, and they had until Tuesday to bring a case before the five-year statute of limitations expired. The push to move forward came even as prosecutors in the office had detailed in a memo concerns about the pursuit of an indictment.\n\nTrump has for years railed against both a finding by U.S. intelligence agencies that Russia preferred him to Democrat Hillary Clinton in the 2016 election and the criminal investigation that tried to determine whether his campaign had conspired with Moscow to sway the outcome of that race. Prosecutors led by special counsel Robert Mueller did not establish that Trump or his associates criminally colluded with Russia, but they did find that Trumpâs campaign had welcomed Moscowâs assistance.\n\nTrump has seized on the fact that Muellerâs investigation did not find that the Trump campaign and the Kremlin colluded, and that there were significant errors and omissions made by the FBI in wiretap applications, to claim vindication. A yearslong investigation into potential misconduct during the Russia investigation, was conducted by a different special counsel, John Durham. That produced three criminal cases, including against an FBI lawyer, but not against senior government officials.\n\nThe criminal case against Comey does not concern the substance of the Russia investigation. Rather, it accuses him of having lied to a Senate committee in his 2020 appearance when he said he never authorized anyone to serve as an anonymous source to a reporter about the investigation.\n\nTrumpâs administration is trying to cast the Russia investigation as the outgrowth of an effort under Democratic President Barack Obama to overhype Moscowâs interference in the election and to undermine the legitimacy of Trumpâs victory.\n\nAdministration officials, including CIA Director John Ratcliffe and Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard, have declassified a series of documents meant to chip away at the strength of an Obama-era intelligence assessment published in January 2017 that said Moscow had engaged in a broad campaign of interference at the direction of Russian President Vladimir Putin.\n\nComey has for years been a prime Trump antagonist. Comey was a senior Justice Department official in Republican President George W. Bushâs administration, was picked by Obama to lead the FBI in 2013 and was director when the bureau opened the Russia investigation.\n\nComeyâs relationship with Trump was strained from the start and was exacerbated when Comey resisted a request by Trump at a private White House dinner to pledge personal loyalty to the president. That overture so unnerved the FBI director that he documented it in a contemporaneous memorandum.\n\nTrump fired Comey in May 2017, an action later investigated by Mueller for potential obstruction of justice.\n\nAfter being let go, Comey authorized a close friend to share with a reporter the substance of an unclassified memo that documented an Oval Office request from Trump to shut down an FBI investigation into his first national security adviser, Michael Flynn. Trump and his allies later branded Comey a leaker, with the president even accusing him of treason. Comey himself has called Trump âego drivenâ and likened him to a mafia don.\n\nThe Justice Department, during Trumpâs first term, declined to prosecute Comey over his handling of his memos. The departmentâs inspector general did issue a harshly critical report in 2019 that said Comey violated FBI policies, including by failing to return the documents to the FBI after he was dismissed and for sharing them with his personal lawyers without FBI permission.\n\nEarlier this year, the department fired Comeyâs daughter, Maurene Comey, from her job as a prosecutor in the Southern District of New York. She has since sued, saying the termination was carried out without any explanation and was done for political reasons.\n\nÂ© Copyright 2025 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

Trump highlighted his recent discussions with Chinese President Xi Jinping on September 20, during which the TikTok deal was a key topic. âThis is interesting because I had a very good talk with President Xi, a lot of respect for him. Hopefully, he has a lot of respect for me, too. We talked about TikTok, and he gave us the go-ahead,â he said.Trump further assured that the app, now to be run by American investors and companies, would address key concerns related to security and safety. âYou know, itâs run by American investors and American companies, great ones, great investors, the biggest. The young people really wanted this to happen,â he added.He pointed out that the involvement of major figures like the Chief Technology Officer of Oracle, Larry Ellison, and Oracle would play a central role in ensuring the platformâs security. âWe have American investors taking it over, running it, highly sophisticated, including Larry Ellison and Oracle, I guess, is going to play a very big role in terms of security, safety, and everything else,â Trump explained.Oracle Corporation is an American multinational technology company headquartered in Austin, Texas.Last week, Trump announced that Chinese President Xi Jinping had approved the TikTok deal for the video-sharing platform to continue operating in the US.Speaking with the reporters at the Oval Office, President Trump said, âI had a good call with President Xi. He approved the TikTok deal. We look forward to getting the deal closed. We have to get it signed; it could be a formality. The TikTok deal is on its way, and the investors are getting ready.âTrump mentioned that the US will have âtight controlâ over the app, emphasising that this is a âvery good dealâ for Washington.Trump and Xi Jinping had a telephonic conversation on September 20, during which they discussed various issues, including the Chinese app TikTok, which faces a threat of being banned after the former US President Joe Bidenâs administration passed legislation to force the platform to divest itself of its ownership by the Chinese internet company ByteDance.Shortly after Trumpâs conversation with Xi Jinping, ByteDance issued a statement that the company will advance with the related work that allows TikTok to continue functioning in the US.ByteDance statement on TikTok: We thank President Xi Jinping and President Donald Trump for their attention to TikTok. ByteDance will advance related work in accordance with the requirements of Chinese law, allowing TikTok U.S. to continue serving American users well,â the statement read.The legislation, which was passed in April 2024, aimed to ban the app from January 19, 2025, but the Trump government has not yet enforced it.The US is eager to strike a deal with China that allows US investors to have more control of TikTok.âAccording to The Wall Street Journal and The New York Times, which quoted people familiar with the deal, the proposed agreement between Beijing and Washington is set to see a group of American investors control 80 per cent of TikTok, while the remaining 20 per cent will be controlled by Chinese firms, including ByteDance.

But details of the proposed deal still havenât been revealed, and there are plenty of hoops to jump through before itâs finalized.\n\nâThis is going to be American-operated all the way,â Trump said Thursday. âAnd great respect [sic] for President Xi, and I very much appreciate that he approved the deal. Because to get it done properly, we really needed the support of China and the approval of China.â\n\nTrump has claimed that Chinaâs President, Xi Jinping, has approved the deal, but it still needs formal approval from China, according to the Washington Post. And the Wall Street Journal reports that the group of new investors who are supposed to take over TikTok has yet to be finalized, and legal details havenât been ironed out.\n\nWho are these new investors? According to Trump on Thursday, Larry Ellison, Michael Dell, and Rupert Murdoch are among the âfour or five absolutely world-class investorsâ involved. Trump recently sued Murdoch for defamation over a Wall Street Journal article about a birthday book made for Jeffrey Epstein and signed by Trump in 2003.\n\nCNBC reported earlier Thursday that a new entity operated by Oracle, Silver Lake, and the Abu Dhabi-based MGX investment fund will control about 45% of TikTok. Thirty-five percent will be controlled by ByteDance investors and new holders, according to the business channel. And ByteDance will reportedly control 19.9%, the limit dictated by the law passed last year to force the Chinese company to divest or face a total ban in the U.S.\n\nTrump tried to ban TikTok during his first term in 2020 through an executive order, but that was stymied by the courts and ultimately dropped early in Joe Bidenâs first term. But a bipartisan group of lawmakers revived the effort to ban TikTok on national security grounds in 2023, and that law was passed in 2024 and signed into law by Biden.\n\nPresident Trump pulled a complete 180 in March 2024 during the lead-up to the presidential election, insisting that he no longer wanted TikTok to be banned. And Trump has now delayed enforcing the law five times since he came into office in January. His repeated delays are almost certainly unlawful according to most experts, but Congress hasnât acted.\n\nOne area where Congress may act, according to the Washington Post, is by questioning whether the proposed deal actually follows the letter of the law. ByteDance investors will still hold a significant stake in the company, and ByteDance will apparently keep control of the TikTok algorithm in some way, though there are still questions about how all of that may shake out.\n\nA reporter asked Trump in the Oval Office whether he wanted to see the new TikTok algorithm suggest more MAGA-related content.\n\nâIf I could, Iâd make it 100% MAGA-related,â Trump said to laughter from his underlings. âItâs actually a good question, but I wouldâ¦ If I could make it 100% MAGA, I would. But itâs not going to work out that way, unfortunately.â\n\nBut Trump then suggested other non-MAGA-aligned groups would still be allowed to exist on TikTok. âNo, everyoneâs going to be treated fairly. Every group, every philosophy, every policy will be treated very fairly,â said Trump.\n\nTrump may insist that everyone will get a fair shake on the new TikTok, but about 30 minutes later, in the same Oval Office presentation, Trump signed a presidential memo targeting left-wing and anti-fascist groups for prosecution.\n\nâThese are anarchists and agitators, professional anarchists and agitators, and they get hired by wealthy people, some of whom I know, I guessâ¦ probably know,â Trump said. âYou wouldnât know at dinner with them. Everythingâs nice, and then you find out that they funded millions of dollars to these lunatics.â\n\nFBI Director Kash Patel, Attorney General Pam Bondi, and senior advisor Stephen Miller were all on hand to make threats against left-wing groups, claiming that theyâre âdomestic terrorists.â\n\nPresident Trump also claimed last week that TV stations that criticize him should get their broadcast licenses taken away.\n\nCBS cancelled Stephen Colbertâs show under pressure, and ABC suspended Jimmy Kimmel last week before reinstating him on Tuesday. FCC Chairman Brendan Carr made mob-like threats against ABC, and it remains to be seen how many more critics the Trump regime can successfully silence. Trump has previously tweeted that Jimmy Fallon and Seth Meyers are ânext.â\n\nThe president doesnât like even the mildest forms of criticism, and the U.S. government has no problem demanding that media platforms censor people who oppose Trump. So it will be interesting to see what happens to TikTokâs algorithm after any deal is completed. Itâs hard to imagine a world where Trump allows anti-Trump content to thrive on social media.\n\nBut first, the TikTok deal has to be finalized. And despite Trumpâs repeated insistence that everything is done, it seems like there are quite a few more hurdles before this one crosses the finish line.","summary":"Details of the proposed deal haven't been released.","url":"https://gizmodo.com/if-i-could-make-it-100-maga-i-would-trump-gives-green-light-to-tiktok-deal-2000663986","image":"https://gizmodo.com/app/uploads/2025/09/trump-tiktok-sept.-25-2025-1200x675.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-09-25 23:12:51","author":"Matt Novak","authors":["Matt Novak"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.202},{"id":363537366,"title":"Ex-FBI Director James Comey charged with making false statement, obstruction, AP source says (World)","text":"James Comey was charged Thursday with making a false statement and obstruction in a criminal case filed days after President Donald Trump appeared to urge his attorney general to prosecute the former FBI director and other perceived political enemies.\n\nThe indictment makes Comey the first former senior government official to face prosecution in connection with one of Trumpâs chief grievances: the long-concluded investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election.

Rather, it accuses him of having lied to a Senate committee in his 2020 appearance when he said he never authorized anyone to serve as an anonymous source to a reporter about the investigation.\n\nTrumpâs administration is trying to cast the Russia investigation as the outgrowth of an effort under Democratic President Barack Obama to overhype Moscowâs interference in the election and to undermine the legitimacy of Trumpâs victory.\n\nAdministration officials, including CIA Director John Ratcliffe and Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard, have declassified a series of documents meant to chip away at the strength of an Obama-era intelligence assessment published in January 2017 that said Moscow had engaged in a broad campaign of interference at the direction of Russian President Vladimir Putin.\n\nComey has for years been a prime Trump antagonist. Comey was a senior Justice Department official in Republican President George W. Bushâs administration, was picked by Obama to lead the FBI in 2013 and was director when the bureau opened the Russia investigation.\n\nComeyâs relationship with Trump was strained from the start and was exacerbated when Comey resisted a request by Trump at a private White House dinner to pledge personal loyalty to the president. That overture so unnerved the FBI director that he documented it in a contemporaneous memorandum.\n\nTrump fired Comey in May 2017, an action later investigated by Mueller for potential obstruction of justice.\n\nAfter being let go, Comey authorized a close friend to share with a reporter the substance of an unclassified memo that documented an Oval Office request from Trump to shut down an FBI investigation into his first national security adviser, Michael Flynn. Trump and his allies later branded Comey a leaker, with the president even accusing him of treason. Comey himself has called Trump âego drivenâ and likened him to a mafia don.\n\nThe Justice Department, during Trumpâs first term, declined to prosecute Comey over his handling of his memos. The departmentâs inspector general did issue a harshly critical report in 2019 that said Comey violated FBI policies, including by failing to return the documents to the FBI after he was dismissed and for sharing them with his personal lawyers without FBI permission.\n\nEarlier this year, the department fired Comeyâs daughter, Maurene Comey, from her job as a prosecutor in the Southern District of New York. She has since sued, saying the termination was carried out without any explanation and was done for political reasons.","summary":"James Comey was charged Thursday with making a false statement and obstruction in a criminal case filed days after President Donald Trump appeared to urge his attorney general to prosecute the former FBI director and other perceived political enemies.\n\nThe indictment makes Comey the first former s...","url":"https://www.castanet.net/news/World/574516/Ex-FBI-Director-James-Comey-charged-with-making-false-statement-obstruction-AP-source-says","image":"https://www.castanet.net/content/2025/9/47fa1eb627c1ea83f4e533d82230cb2e49980ae05d3d70fda75778bb6763488f.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-09-25 23:12:00","author":"Eric Tucker And","authors":["Eric Tucker And"],"language":"en","source_country":"ca","sentiment":-0.474},{"id":363538822,"title":"Chilling footage shows man shoot ex-wife hours after she lodged restraining order","text":"A chilling video has emerged showing a man hunting down his ex-wife through a hospital in south-central Turkey before shooting her in the head. The footage, obtained by NewsX, reveals the terrifying moment 44 year old Atilla Ayintapli fires at his former spouse, Eser Karaca, 42, at the private hospital where she was employed as a medical secretary. The mother of two had filed a restraining order against him just hours earlier. In the CCTV clip from May, Ayintapli is seen entering the office space brandishing a large shotgun. Upon spotting him, Karaca attempts to escape to an adjacent room with a colleague, but he pursues them while horrified onlookers flee in the opposite direction.

But Ayintapli wasn't finished, firing twice more at Karaca's lifeless body, reports the Mirror US . In the aftermath of the brutal incident, Ayintapli fled the scene while Karaca's distraught colleagues rushed over, screaming and crying at the horrific sight. Despite being rushed to the emergency room in the very hospital where she worked, Karaca tragically died from her injuries. According to authorities, the woman had lodged a fourth restraining order on the morning of the shooting after he had been stalking her in an attempt to reconcile despite past abuse. However, her ex-husband shot her just before the order could be served. Turkish police swiftly apprehended Ayintapli and arrested him shortly afterwards. He is facing charges for the murder of Karaca as well as threatening her colleague with a weapon. During questioning, he admitted to killing his ex-wife and was subsequently taken to court. Prosecutors are pushing for a life sentence following the indictment. He is currently awaiting trial. Femicides, the act of murdering women and girls due to their gender, has become an escalating problem in Turkey. In a shocking ruling back in August, Turkey's highest court decreed that a man can receive a reduced sentence for murdering a woman if she \"provoked him by refusing to have sex.\" The verdict has sparked fury, with campaigners and legal experts cautioning that the ruling could establish a perilous precedent, highlighting systemic problems in Turkey's judicial approach to femicide.

And we just have to acknowledge that. I think the first step in dealing with any pathology is to acknowledge you have a problem.\"\n\nThe Trump administration has long claimed that no one has a right to seek asylum in the United States; nor is it a right to immigrate to the U.S., to receive an immigration trial or refugee status in the country of an individual's choice, officials have said.\n\nDuring his address at the U.N. General Assembly earlier this week, Trump said countries \"are going to hell\" because of their asylum policies.\n\n\"Sometimes we see people who leave one country and traverse maybe a dozen countries to get to another country, right?\" Landau said. \"That makes it look like this is no longer trying to avoid imminent injury or death, and it makes it look like it's just a substitute for migration.\"\n\nLandau spoke to a room full of diplomats and foreign dignitaries, urging them to embrace \"sovereignty\" and to embrace asylum as a temporary status, and said that migrants should be encouraged to return home as soon as they can.\n\n\"We get to decide who comes in and under what circumstances and how long,\" Landau said. \"That is the quintessential element of sovereignty.\"\n\n\"Saying the process is susceptible to abuse is not xenophobic; it is not being a mean or bad person,\" he said. \"For us, these are kind of common-sense principles, and I think are valuable to prevent the people who are asylum seekers from being subject to abuse, and for somebody from abusing the system.\"\n\nHe pointedly called out international aid organizations and NGOs for allegedly \"promoting\" mass migration.\n\n\"I think we have perceived that there is a whole network of NGOs and multilateral institutions that are really promoting people to be migrating, to be giving them a script. And if you say this, then you're going to be entitled to an asylum hearing,\" he said, adding that he was not \"accusing anybody of anything.\"\n\nEarlier this year, the Trump administration prioritized the expedited resettlement of white South African refugees in the U.S., even as it has turned away refugees from countries including Afghanistan and Haiti under an executive order signed by Trump in February.\n\nFilippo Grandi, the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees, urged Landau to work with the U.N. to find solutions to \"preserve asylum.\"\n\n\"Asylum is a very ancient concept. It is not something we have invented in the past 80 years,\" Grandi said during the event, which he attended as an audience member.
