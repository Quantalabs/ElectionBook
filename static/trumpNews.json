It's a big thing in this country. We're also signing agreements in various locations to unlock rare earths and minerals, and lots of other things all over the world, but in particular, Ukraine,\" he said.\nAccording to the World Economic Forum, while China may not have the largest reserves of rare earth minerals, it dominates the refining process, making it the world's largest importer of critical minerals, which it processes and supplies globally. The United States, India, and Germany follow China as major importers, while the United States, Chile, Switzerland, and Australia have recorded significant increases in exports of raw, semi-processed, or processed critical minerals.\nReferring to his recent phone conversations with Russian President Vladimir Putin on Tuesday and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy on Wednesday, Trump expressed hope for an end to the ongoing conflict.\n\"We're doing very well with regard to Ukraine and Russia, and one of the things we are doing is signing a deal very shortly with respect to rare earth with Ukraine. They have tremendous value in rare earth minerals. We appreciate that. We spoke yesterday with President Putin and President Zelenskyy, and we would love to see this come to an end. I think we're doing pretty well in that regard. Hopefully, we can save thousands of people a week from dying. They're dying so unnecessarily, and I believe we'll get it done. We'll see what happens, but I believe we'll get it done,\" he said.\nAt a press briefing on Wednesday, White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt stated that the administration had \"moved beyond the economic minerals deal.\"\nLeavitt explained, \"It means the minerals deal was that first set of framework that you all saw in that very public meeting with President Zelenskyy and President Trump in the Oval Office. We are now focused on a long-term peace agreement.\"\nEarlier, Trump also signed a proclamation honouring the 250th anniversary of Patrick Henry's famous speech to the Second Virginia Convention.\n\"I just want to announce that I signed a proclamation a few moments ago honouring the 250th anniversary of Patrick Henry's famous speech to the Second Virginia Convention, in which he declared the very well-known, very famous words: 'Give me liberty or give me death,'\" he said.

Get your first month for just $1. Limited time offer.\n\nThe president of World Athletics and himself a double 1500 metres Olympic champion on the track, Coe said he was delighted that Coventry, who won two Olympic golds in the pool, would lead the body.\n\n“She’s the first woman, it’s a very historic moment,” Coe said. \n\n“I’m absolutely delighted for Kirsty. We’ve got an athlete at the head of the organisation, that’s a good thing.\n\n“We chatted actually about that only a couple of weeks ago and agreed that that would be the preferred outcome and that’s what’s happened.\n\n“So I’ve congratulated her and she’s got a huge job but she will have the confidence of the athletes and that’s very important.” \n\nOutgoing IOC president Bach was rumoured to have strongly supported Coventry’s campaign.\n\nReasons behind Coe’s brutal snub\n\nAlthough Coe was once close to Bach, relations between the two men have soured due to the Briton’s stance on issues such as banning Russians from track and field following the invasion of Ukraine.\n\nCoe had also campaigned for a more open IOC than the top-down organisation presided over by Bach.\n\nAsked how he viewed the result, Coe said: “It’s very difficult to make any interpretation at the moment. I think what is pretty clear is that the athletes and the women members in particular supported her very strongly in the first round.” \n\nCoe had complained last week that the IOC election process needed overhauling. \n\n“I have a very clear view, which I think I’ve expressed, about what the challenges are and what the movement needs to address. But Kirsty will, I’m sure, want to deal with the same issues.”\n\nFox Sports News reporter Alex Thomas said Coe “put some IOC noses out of joint” with his “slightly more radical agenda”.\n\n“I think Sebastian Coe did ruffle a few feathers last year when he gave cash prizes to the gold medal winners in the track and field events at the Olympics,” Thomas said.\n\n“Athletes at the Olympic do not get paid to compete at the Olympics, they do not get prize money. That’s been a bone of contention for some years. The IOC don’t like people trying to change them from the outside. \n\n“I wouldn’t say Kirsty Coventry becoming IOC president was a complete shock. It was known that secretly Thomas Bach was pushing her candidacy. \n\n“I think what is surprising is any organisation like the IOC and FIFA, these entrenched organisations famously filled with old men in blazers, have suddenly elected a woman in her 40s from Africa. It truly is groundbreaking. It is shattering the glass ceiling and a historic moment.”\n\nTrump looms large, Putin’s request to new IOC boss\n\nCoventry has plenty of challenges ahead of her in an eight-year tenure encompassing the LA 2028 and Brisbane 2032 Olympics, as well as the Winter Games.\n\n“Dealing with Donald Trump and the LA Games is just one of several challenges ahead of her,” Thomas said. \n\n“She’s also talked about possible reform of the World Anti Doping Agency. Also how do you reintegrate Russia back into the Olympic movement, they’ve been competing under a neutral flag for years because of the Ukraine conflict. \n\n“Also like all the candidates, she’s taking a much stronger stance on transgender athletes in women’s sport.”\n\nCoventry said “communication will be key” with US President Donald Trump in the lead up to the 2028 LA Olympics.\n\nCoventry said: “I have been dealing with difficult men in high positions since I was 20 years old.”\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin congratulated Coventry on Thursday, after officials in Moscow urged her to welcome Russia back to the Olympic fold.\n\nIn a note addressed to Coventry, Putin said her election as IOC president was “proof of your high authority in the sporting world and recognition of your outstanding personal achievements,” adding he was sure she should would achieve “success” in the role.\n\nRussia dogged outgoing IOC president Thomas Bach’s tenure first with the doping scandal at the 2014 Sochi Winter Games and then Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine.\n\nResult not ‘women versus men’\n\nBach said the election of Coventry as his successor should not be reduced to a gender battle of “women versus men”.\n\nBach played down the importance of the 41-year-old from Zimbabwe becoming the first woman to be elected head of international sport’s wealthiest organisation, defeating six other candidates, all men.\n\n“I don’t think we should reduce this election to the fact that there were six men and one woman. I don’t think it was a vote on women versus men or vice versa,” he said.\n\nThe German said the victory in the very first round of voting gave Coventry “a very strong mandate” and was “a great signal of unity”, adding: “She can count on the support of the membership.” \n\nBach insisted he had “no preferred candidate” but recalled that he had said during last year’s Paris Olympics it was time for a new leader who reflected a new era.\n\nHe will remain in office until June to oversee the handover to Coventry, a process he said would start on Friday when he will have breakfast with her to discuss the transition.\n\nCoventry garnered 21 more votes than second-placed Juan Antonio Samaranch Junior while Coe finished third in voting.","summary":"There is a new world order after a new boss of Olympics was elected in a shock result as Vladimir Putin issued a desperate plea.","url":"https://www.news.com.au/sport/olympics/putins-plea-to-new-olympics-boss-icon-brutally-snubbed-in-shock-olympics-vote/news-story/eb5bf9f3a5bd4343a7215a11486fd3b7?from=rss-basic","image":"https://content.api.news/v3/images/bin/ca1d13e2512cbacddc35abc64378993d","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-03-21 00:51:23","author":"Matthew Sullivan","authors":["Matthew Sullivan"],"language":"en","source_country":"au","sentiment":0.049},{"id":302432142,"title":"World News | Trump Signs Executive Order to Shut Down Department of Education, Says Essential Programs Will Be Preserved","text":"Washington DC [US], March 21 (ANI): US President Donald Trump on Thursday signed an executive order to begin the process of shutting down the Department of Education, stating that while essential programs like Pell Grants and Title I funding for children with disabilities would be preserved and reassigned to other agencies, the overall department had failed to improve education despite massive spending increases over the past four decades.\n\"Today we take a very historic action that was 45 years in the making.

We're not doing well with the education in this country and we haven't for a long time.

As per the White House, the US Department of Education has spent USD 3 plus trillion since 1979. Since then, per-pupil spending has increased by more than 245 per cent-- with virtually nothing to show for it.\nhttps://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1902802362730745977\nWhite House data shows that Math and reading scores for 13-year-olds are at the lowest level in decades. Six in ten fourth graders and nearly three-quarters of eighth graders are not proficient in math. Seven in ten fourth and eighth graders are not proficient in reading, while 40 per cent of fourth-grade students don't even meet basic reading levels. Standardized test scores have remained flat for decades. US students rank 28 out of 37 OECD member countries in math.\n\"History has proven them right. After 45 years the United States spends more money on education by far than any other country and spends likewise by far more money per pupil than any country and it's not even close but yet we rank near the bottom of the list in terms of success. We are at the bottom of the list and we've been there for a long time. 70 per cent of eighth graders are not proficient in either reading or math. 40 per cent of fourth graders lack even basic reading skills. Our Public elementary and middle schools score worse in reading today than when the department opened by a lot,\" he said.\n\"In Baltimore, 40% of the high schools have zero students who can do basic mathematics- not even the very simplest of mathematics. They're talking about like adding a few numbers together,\" he added. Trump said that despite these failures, the department's spending boomed by 600 per cent in a short while.\n\"Despite these breathtaking failures the Department's discretionary budget has exploded by 600 per cent in a very short period,\" he said\nTrump said that he was laying off the staff by half and defunding the department.\n\"My administration has initiated a reduction in force. We've cut the number of bureaucrats in half,\" he said.\nTrump said that the funds used to support students with disabilities and scholarships will be preserved and these duties will be provided to other institutions.\n\"The Department's useful functions- Pell Grants, Title One funding resources for children with disabilities and special needs will be preserved. Pell Grant is supposed to be a very good program, Title One funding and resources for children with special disabilities and special needs- are going to be preserved in full and redistributed to various other agencies and departments that will take very good care of them,\" he said.\n\"But beyond these core necessities, my administration will take all lawful steps to shut down the department as quickly as possible- it's doing us no good. We want to return our students to the States. We want education to come back to the States and they're going to do a phenomenal job. It's a commonsense thing to do and it's going to work,\" he said.\nHe said under a new system, sans the Education Department, schools could compete with countries in Europe and China, which he said were out-competing the US.\n\"If you look at Denmark, Norway, Sweden- I give them a lot of credit. China's the top 10 so we can't now say that bigness is making it impossible to educate because China is very big but you have countries that do a very good job in education. I think they have a chance to do well but we're going to be returning education very simply back to the states where it belongs. Governors and others in the state want it so badly they want to take their children back and teach their children individually. Probably the cost will be half and the education will be maybe many times better so we look forward to this,\" he said.\nTowards, the end, Trump made what he called a 'personal statement', where he said that his administration would 'take care' of all the teachers, even those who opposed this order.\n\"I want to just make one little personal statement- teachers to me are among the most important people in this country and we're going to take care of our teachers. I don't care if they're in the union or not. That doesn't matter but we're going to take care of our teachers. I believe the states will take better care of them,\" he said, adding, \"We want to have our children well educated. we want them to love going to school.\" (ANI) (This is an unedited and auto-generated story from Syndicated News feed, LatestLY Staff may not have modified or edited the content body)","summary":"Get latest articles and stories on World at LatestLY.

He will succeed outgoing Superintendent Barbara Malkas, who is retiring June 30.\n\nMayor Jennifer Macksey said the search committee that chose Callahan and the School Committee agreed: Of the five candidates for the job, including a superintendent, three assistant superintendents, and a principal, “Callahan significantly outshone the others.”\n\nCallahan, who also was also in the running to be superintendent at the Central Berkshire Regional School District, withdrew that application in order to “finish what I started” in North Adams, where he began in 1998 as a substitute teacher at Drury High School.\n\nIn the decades since, he’s been involved in major initiatives, including early college programming, internship opportunities, curriculum changes and consequential grants. \n\nHe has been an English teacher, director of curriculum and instruction, assistant principal and principal at Drury High School; director of technology for the district; and his most recent role as assistant superintendent. He has a bachelor’s degree in English literature from Hamilton College, a master’s in education from Cambidge College, as well as a doctorate of education from Russell Sage College.\n\nCallahan said his three main priorities are high academic expectations, supporting students socially, mentally and academically, and equity of access and outcome. He cited recent surveys of the school community, including students and teachers, saying their priorities of curricular rigor and student support aligned with his.\n\nHis salary was unavailable as it remained under negotiation, but Malkas began her most recent three-year contract in 2022 earning $148,129, which included built-in annual step increases.\n\nBUDGET AND BUILDING\n\nCallahan’s job will include overseeing the building of a new school and navigating any changes to federal dollars coming to the district due to action taken by President Donald Trump's administration.\n\nAlthough he believes the school budget will allow the district to maintain “many of the positions we have,” he acknowledged concerns about a possible federal funding crisis. Already in danger of being lost to U.S. Department of Education cuts are the summer sessions of the 21st Century After School Program.\n\nIn response to money uncertainty, Callahan said the district will continue to pursue competitive grants. It may need to make difficult decisions regarding after-school programs as well.\n\n“Them reality of the potential budget crisis is that we’d have to streamline what we’re doing, and focus on school day activities,” he said.\n\nThe closure of Greylock Elementary, and the consolidation of pre-K through grade 6 elementary elementary schools into Colegrove Park Elementary (grades 3-6) and Brayton Elementary (pre-K through grade 2) has weighed on teachers and others, Callahan says. He attributed any lingering bitterness to how the consolidation plan shifted from its original iteration.\n\n“The model was, Greylock is going to combine with Brayton as a pre-K through 6 school, and Colegrove is going to remain the same until the new building was built. What we didn’t realize is how much that actually ended up leading to some resentment,” Callahan said. “The teachers thought that’s where things were headed… they really felt a sense of loss when they got split up, and when they broke off.”\n\nHe said speaking with teachers, students, parents and others about subjects like this is essential, and advocated for more professional development in order for teachers to get to know and grow with each other.\n\nSOCIAL ISSUES\n\nCallahan said the decision to prohibit the use of cellphones at the high school has led to a 62 percent reduction in disciplinary incidents from fall 2023 to the fall 2024.\n\nHe also expressed concern that the use of devices by elementary school students — and their parents — may be inhibiting the development of social skills, and that they are “manifesting as if they haven’t engaged with humans that often.”\n\nAs for how he will handle threats to marginalized communities, such as LGBTQIA+ students, Callahan recognized a national culture war playing out in schools.\n\n“When one set of values is aligned with bigotry and exclusion,\" he said, \"those are not values I would support.”","summary":"Timothy Callahan took questions for roughly 90 minutes from the School Committee on Thursday night.

He pointed out that over 50,000 Palestinians have been martyred, thousands remain buried under rubble, and 90 percent of Gaza has been reduced to ruins. “The International Court of Justice has declared these actions as genocide, yet the US shamelessly continues to stand by Israel. Donald Trump is openly calling for the depopulation of Gaza,” he added.\n\nExpressing disappointment over the silence of Muslim leaders, he noted that while platforms are being provided for negotiations between Russia and Ukraine, the governments of Islamic countries remain indifferent to one of the most pressing humanitarian crises. “The entire Muslim Ummah looks to Pakistan for leadership. As a nuclear power with a professional army, Pakistan should have played a proactive role in addressing the Palestine issue.

However, the government must not dare to take such a step,” he cautioned. “The entire nation is united in its stance that Palestine is the only legitimate state, while Israel remains an illegal occupying entity. Quaid-e-Azam laid down Pakistan’s policy on this matter, and any deviation from it will not be tolerated.”\n\nRehman also criticized the government’s economic policies, rejecting the recent hike in petroleum levy and labelling it as unjust. He announced that JI would launch a protest movement after Eid against high electricity and gas prices, as well as unfair taxation.\n\nTouching upon national security concerns, he expressed alarm over the deteriorating security situation in Balochistan and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. “JI has formed a committee to draft a national policy for Balochistan, and next month, we will convene a conference in Islamabad with all relevant stakeholders to discuss the province’s issues,” he revealed.\n\nHe also called for meaningful dialogue between Pakistan and Afghanistan, warning that continued hostilities would only benefit their common enemies. “Afghan soil must not be used for terrorist activities against Pakistan.

On Thursday, despite the uproar on social media, Trump proceeded with the divisive action to scale back the Department of Education. A social media user commented with alarm: \"Kids brought into the White House to provide a ringing chorus as Trump abolishes the US Department of Education,\" and remarked, \"The frenetic race to turn the United States into North Korea is advancing with every day that goes by.\" Another expressed their concern: \"Donald Trump is using kids as a prop as he proudly signs an unconstitutional executive order abolishing the Department of Education. Our kids deserve better.\" While it is ultimately up to Congress to fully eliminate the federal department, Trump's executive move sets the stage for potential Congressional action to dissolve it. A Senate vote would be the next crucial step. The signing ceremony took place in the East Room of the White House, which had been transformed to mimic a classroom setting, complete with children seated at desks, reports the Mirror US . A group of children participated in a symbolic gesture by signing their own 'executive orders' and received pens. According to reports, the order instructs Education Secretary Linda McMahon to drastically scale back the department, potentially leading to its complete shutdown. The president's directive to the former WWE chief requires her to take \"all necessary steps to facilitate the closure ... and return education authority to the states.\" This move comes just a week after some department employees were reportedly ousted from their offices. Trump's decision will significantly downsize the department, but it will continue to oversee federal student loans and Pell grants, as confirmed by White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt on Thursday. She stated that essential department duties, including civil rights enforcement, will remain, but did not specify how they will be carried out. \"The great responsibility of educating our nation's students will return to the states,\" Leavitt told reporters. However, public school advocates argue that eliminating the department would put disadvantaged children at a greater disadvantage in an already unequal American education system. \"This is a dark day for the millions of American children who depend on federal funding for a quality education, including those in poor and rural communities with parents who voted for Trump,\" said NAACP President Derrick Johnson. Democrats have pledged to contest the order in both the courts and Congress, urging Republicans to join their opposition. Trump's order is \"dangerous and illegal\" and will disproportionately affect low-income students, students of colour, and those with disabilities, according to Rep. Bobby Scott of Virginia, the leading Democrat on the House Committee on Education and the Workforce. The department was \"was founded in part to guarantee the enforcement of students' civil rights,\" Scott stated. He further added that \"Champions of public school segregation objected, and campaigned for a return to 'states' rights.'\". However, supporters of Trump's vision for education have welcomed the order. \"No more bloated bureaucracy dictating what kids learn or stifling innovation with red tape,\" Tiffany Justice, co-founder of Moms for Liberty, shared on social media. \"States, communities, and parents can take the reins - tailoring education to what actually works for their kids.\"","summary":"President Donald Trump's decision to sign an executive order gutting the Department of Education has sparked outrage and drawn eerie comparisons to North Korean tactics","url":"https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/uk-world-news/donald-trumps-behaviour-chilling-echoes-34903873","image":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/article34903869.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200b/0_US-POLITICS-TRUMP-EDUCATION.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-03-21 00:39:14","author":"Jack Hobbs,Phoebe Tonks","authors":["Jack Hobbs","Phoebe Tonks"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":0.036},{"id":302433796,"title":"Trump demands Supreme Court step in after federal judges block his agenda: 'These people are Lunatics'","text":"President Donald Trump on Thursday called on the Supreme Court to reverse injunctions placed on his administration's efforts to carry out mass deportations and other moves to downsize the scope of government.

The order, the latest in a series of similar actions targeting law firms whose lawyers have provided legal work that Trump disagrees with, threatened to suspend active security clearances of attorneys at Paul, Weiss and to terminate any federal contracts the firm has. It singled out the work of Mark Pomerantz, who previously worked at the firm and who oversaw an investigation by the Manhattan District Attorney's office into Trump's finances before Trump became president. To avoid those consequences, the White House said Paul, Weiss had agreed to “take on a wide range of pro bono matters that represent the full spectrum of political viewpoints of our society,” to disavow the use of diversity, equity and inclusion considerations in its hiring and promotion decisions and to dedicate the equivalent of USD 40 million in free legal services to support Trump administration policies on issues including assistance for veterans and countering anti-Semitism.

The server noted that upon his arrival at the SpaceX facility, three different security guards refused to accept the documents, and one told him he was trespassing. He \"placed the documents on the ground,\" and left while the guards photographed him and his car.\n\nThe summons pertains to a case concerning Musk's eventual purchase of Twitter, now known as X, for $44 billion in 2022. Prior to the acquisition, Musk built up a position in the company of greater than 5%, which would've required disclosing his holdings to the public within 10 calendar days of reaching that threshold.\n\nAccording to the SEC's civil complaint, filed in U.S. District Court in Washington, D.C., in January, Musk was more than 10 days late in reporting that material information, \"allowing him to underpay by at least $150 million for shares he purchased after his financial beneficial ownership report was due.\"\n\nOnce he took over Twitter, Musk used the platform to promote then-candidate and now President Donald Trump, and other Republican candidates and causes.

Geremy Jasper’s long-in-the-works follow-up to 2017’s misfit-rapper saga Patti Cake$ is a musical crossed with a fable crossed with a post-apocalyptic sci-fi thriller, and has all the stuff of a passion project. Whether that passion translates to the audience is the question.\n\nO’DESSA: STREAM IT OR SKIP IT?\n\nThe Gist: Some opening text tells us that the world has been “poisoned” and most of the survivors live in a place called Satylite City, ruled by an egomaniacal entertainer named Plutonovich (Murray Bartlett), who’s like Max Headroom meets Donald Trump meets Zod (as in “kneel before”) meets whatever Stanley Tucci was in The Hunger Games. O’Dessa (Sadie Sink, Stranger Things) doesn’t live there, though. She and her ailing mama (Bree Elrod) dwell on a dried-out husk of earth o’er yonder. She sings to a scarecrow of her father (Pokey LaFarge), a traveling troubadour with a magic guitar who sang to “comfort the disturbed and disturb the comfortable.” She got the gift of singin’ and strummin’ from him, as well as a story about how she’s the seventh son who’ll save the world with a song. That guitar, shipped back in a coffin after he died, is buried out in the yard, because Mama didn’t want O’Dessa to take it and wander far from the fam like her old man did. But Mama has a cough, the type that kills people in movies when the plot needs it to. And so O’Dessa buries her mother, cuts her hair into a pompadour with a dangling curl, digs up the six-string and gets to walkin’.\n\nDestiny awaits in Satylite City, but it’s waylaid when a batch of friendly singing hobos led by a preacher steal O’Dessa’s heirloom instrument and leave us wondering if she can save the world playing air guitar. Probably not, so she quests to find it, and it doesn’t take very long at all. Satylite is a big place but whaddaya know, it’s hanging right in that there pawn shop. Not that she has the money to get it back, or the skills to charm the battleaxe behind the counter, who, like so many people in these parts, stares lobotomically at Plutonovich on the teevee. So she scraps together a gee-tar out of found objects and heads to a club to play for an audience and hopefully win a little scratch. \n\nNone of it, though, will they have: She gets booed off the stage. They will, however, have plenty of Euri Dervish (Kelvin Harrison Jr.), who owns the drag-queen catwalk thanks to his big-show presentation and even bigger voice. We learn that Euri is the sad, exploited puppet of Neon Dion (Regina Hall), a thoroughly terrifying individual in wicked S&M leather and electrified brass knuckles, and wearing teensy bangs with no eyebrows, leaving so much… space up there between the eyes and hairline. She pimps out Euri for cash. But Euri and O’Dessa fall in lurve, enough so it’s like, hey, what about the guitar? We still worried about that? What if someone else buys it? Can she put it on layaway or steal it or something? Folk tend not to think about practicalities when they’re getting some, especially when it’s fresh, but O’Dessa will have to dig in and focus eventually, if she wants to bring her axe of destiny to Plutonovich’s scary Onederland island and fulfill her chosen-one prophecy.\n\nWhat Movies Will It Remind You Of?: Jasper’s aesthetic is somewhere between The Hunger Games and Blade Runner, with a neon fetish (and nonbinary presentation of characters) that made me recall how great I Saw the TV Glow was. \n\nPerformance Worth Watching: Sink and Harrison seem a little hung out to dry thanks to some flimsy material, leaving Hall – in her nutty, nutty garb – as the most memorable among the thinly rendered characters here.\n\nMemorable Dialogue: Hall hisses this nasty little threat to O’Dessa: “If I ever see you near my piggybank again, I will shuck open your guts and yank the pearl from your rotten greezy little oyster.”\n\nSex and Skin: Poistcoital cuddles only.\n\nOur Take: One express ticket to Poughkeepsie, please. And please hurry. No no it’s fine, keep the change, I gotta go. Which is to say O’Dessa didn’t work for me, despite Jasper’s obvious ambition. He overstuffs every frame with oodles and scads of detail, but didn’t dedicate enough time and effort to crafting an original story with depth and nuance. The characters are far from fleshed out, and they never truly explore the crazy world in which they live, and that spikes the audience’s curiosity. Tonally, it’s humorless in blatant spite of all the crazy visuals, and doesn’t lean into its earnestness; it’s just blah, resulting in a hollow parable that feels cobbled together out of too many ideas and influences dropped on a rickety narrative foundation.\n\nSo the film’s a weird conglomeration of cinematographic vision with overly familiar dystopian chosen-one tropes. The songs are nice enough – Sink has quite the pretty voice – but unmemorable, and couched within underwhelming choreography (perhaps a result of budgetary limitations). And thematically, a lot of ripe, delicious fruit is left to rot on the vine; despite his big dumb reality show that’s like American Idol meets The PTL Club, Plutonovich is just a generic obnoxoid, and the screenplay shows no interest in digging into the cult-of-personality madman-leader story elements that might bring to mind certain People In Charge Around Here. O’Dessa has so much going on, yet feels naggingly irrelevant and insubstantial on all fronts. It’s likely destined to find long-term traction as a cult film, but it never worked for me in the slightest. It inspires admiration and ridicule in equal measure.\n\nOur Call: It’s simple: Style trumps substance in this one. SKIP IT.\n\nJohn Serba is a freelance writer and film critic based in Grand Rapids, Michigan.","summary":"You'll either love it or hate it.","url":"https://decider.com/2025/03/20/odessa-hulu-movie-review/","image":"https://decider.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/sadie-sink-singing-odessa.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/INwYSqYs-GRWosdtJ.mp4","publish_date":"2025-03-21 00:30:00","author":"John Serba,mliss1578","authors":["John Serba","mliss1578"],"language":"en","category":"entertainment","source_country":"zm","sentiment":0.294},{"id":302433592,"title":"White House rescinds executive order targeting prominent law firm - The Associated Press","text":"WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump on Thursday rescinded an executive order targeting a prominent international law firm after it pledged to review its hiring practices and to provide tens of millions of dollars in free legal services to support certain White House initiatives.\n\nThe move follows a meeting between Trump and Brad Karp, the chairman of the law firm Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Garrison & Wharton, over the White House order issued last week. \n\nThe order, the latest in a series of similar actions targeting law firms whose lawyers have provided legal work that Trump disagrees with, threatened to suspend active security clearances of attorneys at Paul, Weiss and to terminate any federal contracts the firm has.

Trump repeatedly vowed on the 2024 campaign trail to shut down the federal agency and give school power back to the states. The Education Department, however, was created by Congress in 1979 and cannot be unilaterally shuttered by executive action. It can only officially be dismantled by an act of Congress. Republicans maintain slim majorities in both the House and Senate. Soon after Trump signed the executive order in the East Room, Sen. Bill Cassidy, R-La., announced in a post on X that he would submit legislation to accomplish the president’s goal. Secretary of Education Linda McMahon acknowledged the agency will face some hurdles in the months ahead but promised to work with Congress to get the job done. \"We've spent almost $3 trillion. We've seen our scores continue to decline. We're doing something wrong. We need to change,\" she said in an interview Thursday on \"Special Report.\" \"I want Congress to be a partner in this, and I believe they will be because both sides of the aisle know that what is happening to education in our country cannot be allowed to stand because we are failing our students.\" DEM AGS SUE OVER TRUMP ADMINISTRATION'S DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION LAYOFFS Data from the National Assessment of Education Progress, commonly known as the Nation’s Report Card, shows math proficiency at 39% for 4th graders and 28% for 8th graders. Reading proficiency isn’t much better, at 31% and 30% respectively. Democratic lawmakers released statements shortly after Trump’s executive order signing, condemning his decision. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said the move will only hurt students. \"This horrible decision by Donald Trump will be felt by teachers, parents, school leaders, and in the quality of education our children receive.

A forced Minnesota hunting season could follow.\n\nThe ESA aimed to protect the apex predator from hunters, crafting a safe environment to allow its recovery after being hunted to near extinction in the lower 48 states.\n\nGray wolves’ status on the ESA has been strenuously challenged in recent years with 2025 as no exception.\n\nCertain federal legislation threatens to strip gray wolves of their federally protected status while Minnesota legislation, if passed, would force a hunting season if federal protection is lost.\n\nWith these rapid changes that could impact the Minnesota gray wolf population, some questions beg to be answered: what is the gray wolf’s role in the Northland; what is the driving factor behind the legislation; and when would changes take place, if at all?\n\nRapid change\n\nThe Minnesotan gray wolf has been listed as a threatened, rather than an endangered, species since 1978 — a unique status among the lower 48 states only held by Minnesota until 2011.\n\nThe Minnesota Department of Natural Resources has held the preservation of the gray wolf paramount with many years of wolf management plans detailing its effort.\n\nBecause of this, Minnesota bolsters the largest mainland gray wolf population today at around 2,500 to 3,500 with small packs scattered throughout the northeast. The estimated population has remained steady since the mid-1990s.\n\n“Wolves are a native species in Minnesota; we’ve always had wolves here,” said DNR Large Carnivore Expert Dan Stark. “The wolf was listed and that was intended to help recover the species so that they were no longer endangered. It’s been a successful recovery and wolf populations have come back.\n\n“It’s a species that a lot of Minnesotans appreciate and want to have on the landscape and it’s important, from a conservation standpoint, to maintain a healthy population.”\n\nThe DNR says a healthy wolf population is between 2,200 and 3,000 with hunting permittable at a threshold above 1,600.\n\n“It’s not a management objective; we’re not intending to manage the population down to that level (of 1,600 wolves),” Stark said, “but if it was ever at or approaching that level, we’d want to make sure that we understand what’s influencing that to change management, to turn it around.”\n\nSince the ESA, Minnesota has only offered one wolf hunting stint, three years between 2012 and 2014. This resulted in 923 total wolves killed by hunters and trappers.\n\nAfterward, the state has not offered another season despite a federal delisting by President Donald Trump at the end of his first term in 2020 — this was later overturned by a federal judge in 2022.\n\nThis narrative could rapidly change.\n\nThe Pet and Livestock Protection Act of 2025 aims to remove wolves from the ESA by way of Trump’s 2020 ruling and disallow judicial review — meaning a federal court cannot overturn the bill — which would leave wolf management up to each state.\n\nIf this happens, the Minnesota DNR would contemplate and facilitate a hunting season yearly based on years worth of data.\n\nHowever, congruent state legislation, Requiring an Open Season for Wolves, aims to join neighboring Wisconsin in forcing an annual wolf hunting season if the animal is federally delisted.\n\n“Let’s have a season that’s managed properly,” Minnesota Sen. Nathan Wesenberg, District 10, R-Little Falls, said in favor of the bill during a February Hunters for Hunters meeting in Bemidji. “We take that money and put it back into management; we can do it the right way, rather than people just going around shooting wolves because that’s going to happen.”\n\nA symbiotic relationship\n\nInfluencing such politics, groups like Hunters For Hunters have formed to lead in the discussion of a wolf hunting season in Minnesota. HFH has held various meetings throughout the state, including a February meeting in Bemidji honing in on wolf legislative concerns.\n\nHFH is a group comprised mainly of hunters and landowners who feel the wolf population is “out of control,” as spokesperson Steve Porter put it at the meeting.\n\nThis perception bleeds into a few different things. One is the relationship between gray wolves and the environment — namely the white-tailed deer, a wolf’s main source of protein.\n\nHFH worries the wolf population negatively affects the white-tailed deer population which then affects a hunter’s ability to find deer.\n\nAccording to the DNR, a gray wolf in the Northland downs an estimated 15-20 white-tailed deer per year, mainly fawns. This adds up to around 37,500 to 70,000 deer per year which hardly chips at the deer population estimated from 800,000 to 1 million within the last decade.\n\nOf course, various things like weather alter this tally.\n\nGray wolves are better equipped to traverse through deep snow than white-tails. Wolves are native to the Northland while white-tailed deer are not — they traveled further north as the environment began to change and eventually outnumbered native deer species such as elk, caribou and moose over time.\n\nThus, during long, harsh winters, white-tailed deer become more susceptible to the hunt; wolves likely kill more deer during these winters than the average of 37,500 to 70,000, the DNR estimate.\n\nMilder winters like the previous two seasons give deer populations a chance to balance out, however.\n\nIn comparison, Minnesota’s most abundant predator, the coyote, is known to kill white-tails, mainly fawns, yet no clear estimate is available for how many per year. Conversely, Minnesota’s second most common predator, the black bear, is an omnivore that does not have a meat-reliant diet. Therefore, it is estimated that a black bear kills an average of just 1.4 deer per year, again mainly fawns, for a total of around 18,200 to 25,200. Finally, car accidents result in an average of 35,000 to 36,000 deer deaths in Minnesota per year.\n\nWolves may be the deer’s No. 1 natural predator but humans fell more deer per year during the deer hunting season. For example, the 2024 deer hunting yield clocked in at just over 170,000 for reported successful hunts.\n\nThese facts suggest a symbiotic relationship between wolves and the Northland ecosystem as no correlation has been drawn to suggest wolves negatively impact the white-tailed deer population or the ecosystem as a whole, according to the DNR.\n\nWolf depredation program\n\nAnother HFH justification for a hunting season is for livestock killed by wolves, which does happen throughout the year to ranches and farms in the Northland.\n\nCurrent law does not allow anyone to kill a wolf unless it directly threatens human life, meaning no landowner can kill a wolf to protect livestock.\n\nThus, the state offers a wolf depredation program to compensate landowners for lost livestock due to wolf kills.\n\nThe program is busy each year.\n\nBetween 2018 and 2022, Minnesota paid out $621,022 with 2018 as the most costly year at $165,912. Initially, the funds were strictly used for livestock losses due to wolves with a budget of $175,000 per year from the state’s general fund. However, in 2020, part of the funds began being allocated to the University of Minnesota Extension office for staff time spent assigning monetary value to lost animals.\n\nBeltrami County residents were awarded $55,930 in this time frame, the third most in the state behind Kittson and Pine Counties. Clearwater County, Beltrami’s western neighbor, was fourth in received payments at $47,000.\n\nFederal trappers kill an average of 200 wolves in Minnesota each year due to these reports and in 2024, there were 252 claims with 136 confirmed.\n\nDespite the program’s implementation, HFH believes it could be better.\n\nSen. Wesenberg offered a legislative change for the program during the HFH meeting in Bemidji, Modifying the Wolf Depredation Compensation Program. It increases funding to the wolf depredation program and considers compensation for house pets lost due to wolves.\n\nHe also offered a new legislative idea which has yet to be drafted into a House file.\n\nThis idea gives the ability of each county sheriff to investigate a livestock kill to determine if a wolf was involved and if the landowner should receive compensation.\n\nThis change is tied to a case in Clearwater County that saw a landowner lose livestock. The sheriff investigated and corroborated the landowner’s claim, suggesting the state award the landowner compensation for lost livestock due to wolves. The claim was rejected, according to HFH members.\n\nThe depredation program has strict steps that must be followed for each claim and if the steps are not followed, the claim can be rejected. This includes reporting the incident within 48 hours followed by the investigation from a DNR conservation officer or USDA trapper.\n\nIt was unclear if the case presented by HFH followed the state’s protocol and if the landowner followed the DNR’s non-lethal preventative wolf measures to keep livestock safe.\n\nEither way, Wesenberg and HFH hope legislative changes, combined with a hunting season, would lower the amount spent on depredation problems as they would likely become less frequent.\n\nLegislative timeline\n\nWhether Minnesota is ready for a wolf hunting season or not, legislation could force it sooner rather than later.\n\nThe Pet and Livestock Protection Act of 2025 aims to reissue a 2020 Trump-era delisting rule of the gray wolf at the federal level, giving each state a chance to craft their wolf plan. This bill is currently being reviewed by the House Committee on Natural Resources and could be ready to move through the legislature later this year.\n\nThe two Minnesota bills discussed by Wesenberg, Requiring an Open Season for Wolves and Modifying the Wolf Depredation Compensation Program, could be passed before May 19, the end of the 2025 Minnesota legislative session.\n\nAll of these moving pieces in both the state and federal legislature create a blurred outlook on wolf hunting in the state.\n\nPerhaps no legislation passes or it all passes. Either way, hunting groups and conservationists will continue to question the best course of action for the Northland gray wolf.","summary":"Gray wolves protected stay on the Endangered Species Act of 1973 may be coming to a permanent end.

In a statement to CNN, a university spokesperson said, “We expect the legal system to adjudicate this case fairly.”\n\nIn an earlier letter obtained by CNN, Georgetown University Interim President Robert Groves told its Board of Directors that Khan Suri had been detained by DHS and his visa had been revoked.\n\nKhan Suri’s detention comes as President Donald Trump continues to crack down on students who engage in pro-Palestinian protests.\n\nIt’s the latest case in a series of arrests and deportation proceedings the Trump administration has brought against people associated with US colleges and universities, sending shockwaves across the academic community and raising concerns about the protection of free speech.\n\nKhan Suri is married with children, but his family has not been given any information about his detention, his sister, Khushnuma Khan, told CNN. That includes their parents who live in the north Indian state of Uttar Pradesh, Khan said.\n\n“We know only as much as anyone else, which is what is reported in the media. We are currently confused about how and why this is happening to him,” she said.\n\nKhan Suri’s petition, filed earlier this week, alleged that his “targeted, retaliatory” detainment is tied to a broader effort by the Trump administration to allegedly revoke the visas of individuals “purportedly based on their participation in Palestine-related speech.”\n\nSuch an approach is unconstitutional, his lawyers allege.\n\nKhan Suri’s sister added, “My brother’s wife is from Gaza. So maybe that is why this is happening.”\n\nKhan Suri’s wife, Mapheze Saleh, is Palestinian, the petition notes, and a former employee of the Qatari-based news network Al Jazeera who had been “smeared” by an online group that “spreads misinformation and seeks to discredit American Muslims,” according to court filing.\n\nA court declaration filed on Thursday by Saleh said she posted on social media to show her support of the people of Gaza after the start of the Israel-Gaza war. In February, Saleh says she started to feel unsafe, as online websites falsely accused her of having ties to Hamas, according to her declaration.\n\nDHS spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin said in a Wednesday post on X that Khan Suri was “actively spreading Hamas propaganda and promoting antisemitism on social media. Khan Suri has close connections to a known or suspected terrorist, who is a senior advisor to Hamas.”\n\nThe State Department and DHS declined CNN’s requests for additional comment, and at an event in Florida Thursday, DHS Secretary Kristi Noem did not answer questions asked by reporters about Khan Suri.\n\nMcLaughlin also said that Secretary of State Marco Rubio issued a determination on Saturday that “[Khan] Suri’s activities and presence in the United States rendered him deportable” under an obscure legal statute that gives the secretary of state authority to act if he or she believes a non-citizen would have potentially serious adverse foreign policy consequences for the United States.\n\n“I will say that seeing our government abduct and jail another innocent person is beyond contemptible,” Ahmad said in an email to CNN earlier this week. “And if an accomplished scholar who focuses on conflict resolution is whom the government decides is bad for foreign policy, then perhaps the problem is with the government, not the scholar.”\n\nAhmad wrote in a court filing that Khan Suri was targeted because of his wife’s “identity as a Palestinian and her constitutionally protected speech,” the Associated Press reported. She is an American citizen, according to the filing.\n\nDHS provided no evidence that Khan Suri has committed any crimes and his detention violates his free speech and due process rights, Ahmad wrote in the court filing.\n\nThe postdoctoral fellow “cares deeply” about human rights and peace, another attorney for Khan Suri said.\n\n“Dr. Khan Suri is a loving husband and father of young children. He was a distinguished faculty member of the prestigious Georgetown University, who specializes in peace and conflict studies, someone who cares deeply about human rights, dignity, peace, and safety for all people,” Nermeen Arastu, an attorney on Khan Suri’s legal team and associate professor of immigration law at CUNY School of Law told CNN.\n\nWhen DHS officers came for Khan Suri they were “brandishing weapons” and wore black masks covering their faces, Arastu said.\n\n“ICE agents came in the night, took him captive, taking him from his wife and children, and hauled him away to an unknown location before transferring him to an ICE detention facility in Louisiana, far from his family and attorneys,” she added. “This is every family’s worst nightmare. And let’s be clear, this happened to him simply because President Trump wants to silence anyone he suspects to hold a political opinion contrary to his.”\n\nMahmoud Khalil, a Columbia University graduate and Palestinian activist, was arrested earlier this month after the Trump administration accused Khalil – without providing evidence – of being a terrorist sympathizer and supporting Hamas. Khalil faces possible deportation until his case is heard. Khalil was arrested under the same statute used to detain Khan Suri.\n\nAccording to Khan Suri’s bio page on the university’s website, he is a fellow at the Alwaleed Bin Talal Center for Muslim-Christian Understanding at Georgetown’s school of foreign service. He was teaching a class this spring on majoritarianism and minority rights in South Asia.\n\n(Copyright (c) 2024 CNN. All Rights Reserved.

Pubkey, which opened in 2022 near New York University’s Manhattan campus, has a notably casual atmosphere: a subterranean dive bar-slash-podcast recording studio, with a pub grub menu designed by an Eleven Madison Park alum, where anyone could hang out – so long as they paid with cryptocurrency. (When Eater visited in 2022, they observed “a variety of regional styles” of hot dogs on the menu, as well as a stuffed raccoon next to “a television that appeared to be playing A Christmas Story”.) But unlike its competitors, Pubkey has a unique link to the White House: Donald Trump made a high-profile visit during the 2024 campaign and used $998.70 worth of bitcoin to buy smash burgers for the entire bar, becoming the first president to conduct a bitcoin transaction – a symbolic embrace of the crypto community. \nWhen reached for comment, Pubkey owner Thomas Pacchia confirmed that they would be opening a DC location in the coming months, but declined to specify the location. “The DC location will have podcast studios, event space, all that stuff,” he told The Verge. Although he acknowledged the negative publicity surrounding Trump’s visit, Pacchia added that Democrats such as Rep. Ritchie Torres and Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand had visited Pubkey as well and hoped the new location would draw a bipartisan crowd. “Anybody that wants to come and talk about Bitcoin is welcome. Literally, anyone.”\nThe bar it will reportedly replace has diametrically opposed vibes. Located close to DC’s power lobbying firms, Hill Country, a bar whose decor could not scream “TEXAS” any louder, has long been known as a DC nightlife spot particularly beloved by Republican staffers looking for live country music, a good smoked brisket, and decently priced well liquor. It’s also a place where one could witness high-powered GOP lawmakers letting loose: Rep. George Santos was once spotted singing “I Will Survive” on a Wednesday karaoke night in 2023, while under a federal and Congressional investigation for fraud and lying about his background. (This reporter has personally attended several live karaoke nights and at least one company holiday party at Hill Country over the past several years.) \nPubkey’s arrival in Washington comes at a notable time in crypto’s history, whether it displaces the Republican bar or not. Once considered an unserious group of libertarians by lawmakers, the cryptocurrency community now has massive influence with the Trump administration, thanks to key crypto players such as David Sacks and Elon Musk supporting Trump’s reelection. Trump himself has embraced cryptocurrency more than previous presidents, launching his own memecoin, appointing Sacks as a “crypto czar” and announcing a potential cryptocurrency strategic reserve. (The rise of crypto has inadvertently stoked competition between the nativist MAGA right and the global economy-focused tech right, a tension so palpable that Vice President J.D. Vance recently had to call for a truce between the two.) With the upcoming opening of Pubkey, it appears that in the nation’s capital, the crypto faction is literally gaining ground.","summary":"In a true sign of a vibe shift in Washington, a DC bar beloved by Republican staffers announced that it was shuttering its doors &#226;&#128;&#147; and will reportedly be replaced by a bar that only accepts cryptocurrency as payment.

Our focus and our job is to make our case in the US, as we have been doing,” he said.\n\n“A lot of people around the country, not just parents, but including parents, they want to make sure that they’re appropriate protections for people online. The tech giants won’t always like that.”\n\nThe association also complained about proposed local content quotas for American streaming services, which would force the likes of Netflix to fund Australian productions.\n\n“Australia’s online video streaming market is estimated to generate up to $2.3 billion ($3.7 billion) of annual revenue, with the majority of it earned from US companies,” the CCIA submission said.\n\n“If the Australian government pursues the 20 per cent expenditure mandate it has floated in the past year, that would put this revenue at risk.”\n\nThe Government announced quota plans more than two years ago, but has backed away from the idea in the time since.\n\nGreens communication spokeswoman Sarah Hanson-Young said Australia “will not be bullied by Trump’s tech oligarchs”.\n\n“As a sovereign and independent country, Australia has the right to make laws that represent our values as a fair society and protect our citizens online. We will not allow tech billionaires to undermine measures that keep our communities safe and cohesive,” she said.\n\nOpposition foreign affairs spokesman David Coleman also criticised the US tech giants for trying to interfere in Australia’s law-making, saying big tech “doesn’t get to decide what Australia does”.\n\n“We decide what the laws of Australia are,” Mr Coleman told Sky News.\n\n“We are a sovereign nation. Mark Zuckerberg can say whatever he wants.

UMS, a network of eight public universities in Maine, was subject to a temporary pause in funding from the USDA last week during an ongoing battle between the state and the federal government over trans inclusion in women's and girls sports. The funding was reinstated just days later. The USDA now claims the UMS is in full compliance with Trump's executive order. TRUMP ADMIN RESPONDS TO MAINE'S RELUCTANCE TO BAN TRANS ATHLETES FROM GIRLS SPORTS \"After the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) initiated a Title IX compliance review regarding federal funding, the University of Maine System (UMaine) has clearly communicated its compliance with Title IX’s requirement to protect equal opportunities for women and girls to compete in safe and fair sports, as articulated in President Donald J. Trump’s Executive Order,\" the USDA said in its announcement. \"Any false claim by the UMaine can, and will, result in onerous and even potentially criminal financial liability.\" UMS Chancellor Dannel Malloy provided a statement to Fox News Digital, saying the system is \"relieved\" to have come to an understanding with the USDA. \"The University of Maine System has always maintained its compliance with state and federal laws and with NCAA rules, which the U.S. Department of Agriculture also affirmed in a press release today,\" said Chancellor Malloy. \"We are relieved to put the Department’s Title IX compliance review behind us so the land-grant University of Maine and our statewide partners can continue to leverage USDA and other essential federal funds to strengthen and grow our natural resource economy and dependent rural communities through world-class education, research and extension.\" MAINE RESPONDS TO TRUMP ADMIN'S DECLARATION STATE VIOLATED TITLE IX BY ALLOWING TRANSGENDERS IN GIRLS SPORTS In fiscal year 2024 alone, the USDA awarded $29.78 million in funding to UMS for research, the system said. The USDA claims it has provided over $100 million to the UMS in recent years in a letter addressed to the system. The NCAA also amended its gender eligibility policy to prohibit any athlete born biologically male from competing in women's sports. Trump initially vowed to cut funding to Maine specifically if it continued to allow trans athletes to compete in girls sports during a meeting of GOP governors at the White House Feb. 20. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP The next day, Gov. Janet Mills' office responded with a statement threatening legal action against the Trump administration if it withheld federal funding from the state. Then Trump and Mills verbally sparred in a widely publicized argument at the White House during a bipartisan meeting of governors. Just hours after that interaction, the U.S. Department of Education announced it would investigate the state for allowing transgender athletes to compete in girls sports and for potential Title IX violations. The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services has already determined that the state and its Department of Education violated Title IX by allowing transgender athletes to compete and warned that it will make a referral to the U.S. Department of Justice if the state does not provide a written agreement to comply with Trump's executive order. \"What HHS is asking of the Maine Department of Education, the Maine Principals’ Association (MPA) and Greely High School is simple — protect female athletes’ rights. Girls deserve girls-only sports without male competitors. And if Maine won’t come to the table to voluntarily comply with Title IX, HHS will enforce Title IX to the fullest extent permitted by the law,\" OCR acting Director Anthony Archeval said in a statement to Fox News Digital.

He revealed to her that their two children were spending time with none other than the president’s former daughter-in-law, Don Jr’s ex. \n\nThe Daily Mail broke the story of the Woods-Trump shock romance last week.\n\nNordegren, a 45-year-old Swedish model, was married to the 15-time major champion for six years until his affairs with multiple women were uncovered in 2009, leading to the spectacular implosion of their relationship.\n\nThe awkward phone call, which lasted only a few minutes, was very civil in nature.\n\n‘It was a pleasant, almost friendly conversation,’ the insider says. ‘Tiger and Elin are supportive of each other.’\n\nWhile Nordegren is not political, our source says she saw the inherent humor of Woods dating the mother to five of the president’s grandchildren. \n\n‘Her response at first was like “Seriously? A Trump? For real?”,’ the insider says. ‘She was more amused than anything. But she really quickly just accepted it.’ \n\n‘They’re not the type to give each other their “blessing” per se, but they keep each other in the loop with anyone who is going to spend any amount of time around the kids.’ \n\n‘Elin isn’t one to react to things emotionally,’ said the friend, who knows both Woods and Nordegren. ‘So she just processed the information and wished them well.’ \n\nDuring the phone call Woods told Nordegren — the mother of his children Sam, 17, and Charlie, 16 — that the romance was not, at that time, serious.\n\nBut he did say Trump was spending more time around the family. \n\n‘She likes the kids; they like her,’ says the insider. ‘So there was really no reason for any drama with Elin. It was more of a call so she didn’t learn about it in the news.’ \n\nThe source added that golf’s new power couple love ‘hanging out’ but weren’t planning to make lots of public appearances together.\n\nBut last month they were spotted together at the PGA Tour’s Genesis Invitational at Torrey Pines in California.\n\nIn February, Vanessa took her 17-year-old daughter Kai to watch a round of the TGL, the golf league created by Woods and Rory McIlroy.\n\nMeanwhile, President Trump met up with Woods for a round of golf last month.\n\nWoods and Vanessa live just 20 minutes apart from each other in the wealthy southern Florida enclave of Palm Beach and were spotted together at a golf tournament last month. \n\n‘I don’t think Elin was flabbergasted,’ says the pal. ‘He’s told her about several girlfriends since they divorced. The only surprise this time was who the girlfriend was.’ \n\nVanessa was married to Donald Trump Jr, 47, from 2005 to 2018. They have five children together, including Kai, who attends the $38,595-a-year The Benjamin School with Woods’ kids. \n\nKai, the eldest granddaughter of President Trump, is a talented golfer who plans to attend the University of Miami after graduation.\n\nThe Trump family was not a stranger to Woods’ ex, who is often seen around The Benjamin School.\n\n‘The school really requires parental involvement,’ says the Woods pal.\n\n‘So their paths crossed a lot, they had a lot of people in their circles. It’s a community where they saw each other frequently. So Elin also knew exactly who Vanessa was.’ \n\nNordegren is not the only one who has accepted the romance. Don Jr, who is now dating Palm Beach socialite Bettina Anderson, is reportedly ‘cool’ with his ex-wife’s new relationship. \n\n‘He pretty much signs off on it,’ says the Woods pal, ‘but it’s not like anyone will be double dating soon.’ \n\nNordegren was married to Woods from 2004 until their divorce in 2010, a year after is infidelities became public and sparked a relentless media circus.\n\nThe scandal went nuclear on Black Friday of 2009, just days after the tabloids broke the news of his affair with a cocktail waitress. \n\nAfter an argument inside the family home, Woods ran barefoot to his black Cadillac Escalade and tried to escape the home. \n\nNordegren chased after the vehicle, smashing the rear window with one of his golf clubs. \n\nWoods begged his wife for forgiveness, and even entered rehab for sex addiction. But his pleas were unsuccessful and Nordegren filed for divorce in 2010. \n\nShe received a reported $100 million divorce settlement. \n\nBut friends say that Nordegren has largely forgiven her ex-husband for his philandering ways and supports him dating anyone he wants. \n\n‘She’s not political and from what I know she wouldn’t be a Trump supporter,’ says the friend, ‘but I don’t think that really factors into her feelings. She just wants to make sure that the kids are around good people.’ \n\nWoods was preparing for his latest golf comeback and had set his sights on competing in The Masters in August.\n\nBut his career suffered a major setback when he revealed two weeks ago he had ruptured his Achilles tendon and was undergoing surgery.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nRevealing a new lover to an ex is awkward for anyone —&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Tiger Woods&#8217; Embarrassing Phone Conversation with Ex-Wife Regarding His New Girlfriend Vanessa Trump and Her Surprising Response first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/news/us/tiger-woods-embarrassing-phone-conversation-with-ex-wife-regarding-his-new-girlfriend-vanessa-trump-and-her-surprising-response/","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/03/20/12/96392015-14516227-image-a-21_1742474314242.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-03-21 00:17:52","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.157},{"id":302428116,"title":"Donald Trump Just Tied His Own Approval Rating Record","text":"President Donald Trump has made history for being only the second president—after himself during his first term—to have a negative approval rating just two months into his presidency, registering negative ratings on issues including the economy, foreign policy and more.Newsweek reached out on Thursday evening for comment by email.Why It MattersTrump entered the White House on a wave of enthusiasm among Republicans, with lawmakers insisting the president had a mandate from voters to pursue his agenda after the party won the White House and majorities in both houses of Congress.What To KnowFresh polls from Fox News, Reuters/Ipsos, NBC, Quinnipiac and more were released this week, covering Trump's overall approval as well as his approval on individual issues—broken down additionally among Democrats and Republicans—and the response has been overall negative.Trump had scored major points early on with approval for how he handled his transition back to the White House, achieving a -0.3 approval just before his second inauguration when looking at the aggregate from 538. He also has strong approval in some polls on immigration and his handling of border security.However, in the latest polls that have come out, he has scored a negative approval rating in most polls—and virtually every major poll: Fox News reported a 49 percent approval, while the Economist/YouGov reported 47 percent approval, Reuters/Ipsos reported 44 percent approval, NBC reported 47 percent approval, and Quinnipiac at 42 percent approval.Newsweek's average of the 10 recent polls found that Trump has an approval rating of 47 percent, with disapproval at 49 percent.Gallup found that Trump had a 47 percent approval as he started his second term, which beat his 45 percent approval after his first inauguration, but it still ranks Trump as the only president—twice now—to have a negative approval so early in his administrations going back to 1937, according to CNN.According to the pollster, even presidents like Ronald Regan and George H.W. Bush who entered with borderline positive approval ratings—both scoring 51 percent shortly after inauguration day—had very small negative ratings at 13 percent and 6 percent each while the bulk of America remained undecided.Trump's disapproval rating shortly after his first inauguration was 45 percent, while he scored 48 percent disapproval just after his second inauguration. Very few people polled had no opinion of Trump going into either of his administrations.When it comes to the issues, Trump has more disapproval than approval on foreign policy, the economy and inflation—issues that some pointed to as the backbone of his popularity going into the 2024 election and key issues that the public voted for him to solve.The latest Fox News poll, carried out from March 14 to 17, found that 56 percent of respondents disapproved of how Trump has handled the economy so far. His disapproval on inflation is even greater at 58 percent.AtlasIntel, touted by some as the most accurate polling company in the 2024 election, found Trump to have 47 percent approval compared to 52 percent disapproval, having polled 2,550 respondents with a margin of error plus or minus two percentage points. Earlier polls by AtlasIntel found Trump at 50 percent in January and February.What People Are SayingCNN's Chief Data Analyst Harry Enten wrote on X, formerly Twitter: \"Nein nein nein... The American folks are saying 'oy vey... ay caramba!'\"... Trump becomes only the 2nd president (tying himself) to have net negative approval two months into a term. He is underwater on all major issues (economy, foreign policy, etc.), except immigration.Pollster Nate Silver, the founder of 538, wrote on X earlier this month: \"Just a net ~1 point swing. But Trump's approval ratings turned net negative in our tracker for the first time. The economy/market stuff may have an impact even if other things don't. Or it could be a fluke. Worth watching at least.\"Representative Mike Simpson of Idaho, a Republican, wrote on X: \"The media has worked tirelessly to paint [POTUS] and his policies in a negative light. Don't be fooled.

The media pounced on it as an example of Donald Trump's anti-DEI policies running amok. Several ESPN personalities, for example, immediately attacked the removal, assuming ill intent by the Trump Administration. Jeff Passan said the people who removed the Robinson article were \"ghouls,\" Mina Kimes claimed that the DoD was attempting to \"erase\" Robinson from history and Stephen A. Smith said the removal was not \"an honest mistake at all.\" Now, OutKick has learned how it happened. According to a Department of Defense official with knowledge of the situation, on February 27 a group of DoD employees were instructed to flag any pages that were considered to be DEI content. Those employees were given roughly one week to examine thousands of documents. Due to the condensed timeline, several mistakes were made throughout the process, which included flagging the Jackie Robinson article, among others, as DEI. Sean Parnell, United States Assistant to the Secretary of Defense for Public Affairs, confirmed as much in a statement released Thursday. \"Over the past few weeks, we've taken action to identify and archive DEI content from our websites and social media platforms,\" Parnell said. \"Without question, this task was an arduous but incredibly important undertaking. We enforced an aggressive timeline for our DoD services and agencies to comb through a vast array of content, while ensuring that our force remains ready and lethal.\" Once the articles were flagged, \"DEI\" was added to the URL so that automated software could later expunge all marked pages. According to the Department of Defense source, there was little oversight of the people conducting the review, which contributed to the mistakes. While Parnell claimed that \"AI tools\" were the primary contributing factor to the mistakes, the Department official noted that the original source of flagging came from Department employees. \"Every now and then, because of the reality of AI tools and other software, some important content was incorrectly pulled offline to be reviewed,\" Parnell said. The Department official said that the Robinson article was mistakenly removed, but Parnell hinted that some of the other content that was pulled might not have been the result of an error. \"When content is either mistakenly removed, or if it's maliciously removed, we continue to work quickly to restore it,\" Parnell said. The Robinson article, along with many others, have since been restored to the Department of Defense website.","summary":"The Department of Defense says it mistakenly removed a page on Jackie Robinson as part of a DEI purge and OutKick received details on how it happened.","url":"https://www.outkick.com/analysis/department-defense-dei-jackie-robinson-mistake-questions","image":"https://static.outkick.com/www.outkick.com/content/uploads/2025/03/pentagon-jackie-robinson.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-03-21 00:09:21","author":"Dan Zaksheske","authors":["Dan Zaksheske"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.287},{"id":302428564,"title":"Keir Starmer will deploy troops as Putin would 'breach' any ceasefire without them, Prime Minister warns","text":"Keir Starmer will deploy troops as Putin would 'breach' any ceasefire without them, Prime Minister warns\n\nLISTEN: Trump, Zelensky, the rise of Europe’s Far Right and what’s next for NATO – listen to Alas Vine & Hitchens wherever you get your podcasts..\n\nBy MARK NICOL and JASON GROVES\n\nPublished: 23:54 GMT, 20 March 2025 | Updated: 00:09 GMT, 21 March 2025\n\nVladimir Putin will ignore any peace deal unless it is backed up by significant military force, Sir Keir Starmer warned last night.\n\nThe Prime Minister was speaking after joining talks to decide the make-up of a UK-led reassurance force that will deploy to Ukraine after a ceasefire.\n\nBritain and France are expected to provide the bulk of a 20,000-strong force that would protect the country's major cities and infrastructure.\n\nMeanwhile, Ukrainian troops and a vast force of drones would be used to defend the 600-mile frontline from any Russian attacks.\n\nSir Keir said: 'What's happening here is turning political intention into reality, the concept into plans.\n\n'It is vitally important we do that work because we know one thing for certain, which is a deal without anything behind it is something that Putin will breach.\n\n'We know that because it happened before. I'm absolutely clear in my mind it will happen again.'\n\nThe PM, on a visit to the UK's Permanent Joint Headquarters at Northwood in north-west London, was referring to agreements between Russia and Ukraine following the Kremlin's invasion of Crimea in 2014 and in 2019.\n\nVladimir Putin will ignore any peace deal unless it is backed up by significant military force, Sir Keir Starmer warned last night\n\nThe Prime Minister was speaking after joining talks to decide the make-up of a UK-led reassurance force that will deploy to Ukraine after a ceasefire. Pictured: Keir Starmer meets with BAE system apprentices as he looks at a submarine model on March 20\n\nOn both occasions, Moscow signed up to full and comprehensive ceasefires – known as the Minsk agreements – covering Ukrainian troops and Russian-backed separatists in Ukraine's eastern provinces. \n\nNeither agreement included any detrimental consequences for Russia should its supporters continue fighting and, in effect, the 2019 arrangement could be seen as setting conditions for Putin's invasion of Ukraine three years later.\n\nSir Keir continued: 'We hope there will be a deal but what I do know is if there is a deal, the time for planning is now. It's not after a deal is reached.\n\n'Last weekend and two weekends before that, we had groupings of international political leaders coming together to provide the political alignment and the collective agreement that we need to work together to ensure that any deal that is put in place is defended.'\n\nHe added that he was aware the deal may be 'in stages' with a temporary ceasefire eventually followed by a permanent ceasefire. \n\nMilitary planners have been told to prepare for troops to deploy within days of a settled truce rather than weeks, so the momentum towards a lasting peace can be maintained.\n\nBritish Army units are expected to be sent to central and eastern Ukraine while a Royal Navy force will patrol the Black Sea.\n\nThe Royal Air Force will likely deploy to neighbouring countries such as Romania to take part in aerial protection over Ukraine.\n\nSir Keir said the plans under discussion were focusing on 'keeping the skies safe, the seas safe and the borders safe and secure in Ukraine and working with Ukrainians'.\n\nMeanwhile, Foreign Secretary David Lammy urged Putin to agree an unconditional ceasefire just like Ukraine.\n\nHe also insisted Russia should not be given a 'veto' over the presence of European peacekeepers.\n\nMr Lammy said: 'That's the plan on the table, let's get on with it. What are we waiting for? What we certainly can't do is give Putin a veto over the security architecture that will govern the peace.'\n\nWhile the US has talked up the chances of securing peace within weeks, Volodymyr Zelensky said it could be achieved 'this year'.\n\nThe Ukrainian president attended a European Union summit in Norway where he urged leaders to continue sanctions against Russia at least until a ceasefire is agreed.\n\nHe also requested £4.2billion in funding to pay for ammunition and artillery. Mr Zelensky has ruled out any Ukrainian cities close to the frontline being divided in the style of Berlin at the end of the Second World War.\n\nHowever, Russia continued its bombardment of Ukraine yesterday, launching nearly 200 Iranian Shahed drones. \n\nA separate attack on the Kirovohrad region left ten people wounded, including four children. The UK's Ministry of Defence estimates 200,000 to 250,000 Russian troops have been killed since the war began in February 2022.\n\nThat is the largest death toll of Kremlin forces since Germany's invasion of Russia in 1941.\n\nThe MoD added: 'President Putin and the Russian military leadership highly likely prioritise their conflict objectives over the lives of Russian soldiers.'\n\nThe UK research also showed Russia has incurred an estimated 900,000 casualties, most recruited from impoverished regions and ethnic minorities.\n\nBuy British, MoD told as we're cut out of EU plans \n\nKeir Starmer has ordered defence chiefs to 'buy British' after UK arms firms were locked out of a massive EU procurement drive.\n\nThe Prime Minister said he wanted rising Government spending on the military to translate directly into orders and jobs for the British defence industry.\n\nKaja Kallas, the EU's chief diplomat (pictured), suggested the bar on UK firms could be eased if Britain signs an agreement\n\nSpeaking as he prepared to launch construction work on the next generation of nuclear submarines at Barrow in Cumbria, the PM said: 'We want to buy British so that this is felt in jobs across the country.\n\n'As we ramp up defence spending I want to ensure that is in British jobs, with British skills, British small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) and our communities.'\n\nSir Keir has committed to raise spending at the Ministry of Defence from 2.3 per cent of GDP to 2.5 per cent by 2027 – a real terms increase of £6billion – along with an aspiration to hit 3 per cent in the early 2030s. But he said this would also require investment to build up the industry.\n\nHe added: 'I am determined that what we are doing internationally has to be linked to our economic security back here. \n\nHence all the work we are doing to make sure that where we are spending more on defence... that is measured in good, well-paid, skilled jobs in the UK.'\n\nHis intervention came amid growing anger over the EU's decision to lock British firms out of a £125billion procurement drive.\n\nThe EU agreed this week to take a 'Buy European' approach as it bolsters its defences against Russia.\n\nNo 10 played down the row yesterday, saying British firms could continue to work for EU countries on a bilateral basis. Ministers are expected to seek an exemption for the UK as part of talks on a new 'security pact' with the EU.\n\nKaja Kallas, the EU's chief diplomat, suggested the bar on UK firms could be eased if Britain signs an agreement. \n\nMeanwhile, former MI6 chief Sir John Sawers has raised fears for the future of the Five Eyes intelligence alliance, suggesting it may not survive Donald Trump.\n\nSir John said Britain needed to be careful about information shared in the partnership – between Australia, Canada, New Zealand, the UK and the US – due to the President's 'concept of unified executive authority where everything... is visible to and controlled from the top'.\n\nUkraineRussiaKeir Starmer\n\nShare or comment on this article:\nKeir Starmer will deploy troops as Putin would 'breach' any ceasefire without them, Prime Minister warns\n\nAdd comment","summary":"The Prime Minister was speaking after joining talks to decide the make-up of a UK-led reassurance force that will deploy to Ukraine after a ceasefire.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-14521565/Keir-Starmer-deploy-troops-Putin-breach-ceasefire.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/03/20/23/96415653-0-image-m-28_1742514770478.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-03-21 00:09:11","author":"Editor,Jason Groves,Mark Nicol","authors":["Editor","Jason Groves","Mark Nicol"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.259},{"id":302429490,"title":"Enhancing Educational Outcomes Through Empowerment of Parents, States, and Communities – The White House","text":"Under the authority granted to me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, and to empower parents, educators, and communities in ensuring the success of students, I hereby decree:\n\nSection 1. Purpose and Policy. The promising future of our Nation relies on empowered families, engaged communities, and high-quality educational opportunities for every child. Unfortunately, the attempt to control American education through Federal programs and funding — along with the unaccountable bureaucracy that supports them — has clearly failed our children, educators, and families.\n\nDuring the COVID-19 pandemic, taxpayers invested approximately $200 billion at the Federal level for schools, in addition to the more than $60 billion allocated annually for Federal school funding. This funding is primarily distributed by one of the newest Cabinet agencies, the Department of Education, which has been in existence for less than one fifth of our Nation’s timeline. Established in 1979 at President Jimmy Carter’s request, the Department received the first-ever Presidential endorsement from the nation’s largest teachers’ union shortly after he pledged his support for a separate Department of Education. Since then, the Department has solidified the education bureaucracy and sought to persuade the American public that Federal oversight of education is beneficial. While the Department of Education does not educate students directly, it operates a public relations office staffed with over 80 employees at an annual cost exceeding $10 million.\n\nDismantling the Department of Education would allow children and their families to move beyond a failing system. Currently, American reading and math scores are at historically low levels. This year, the National Assessment of Educational Progress revealed that 70 percent of 8th graders fell below the proficient level in reading, and 72 percent did the same in math. The Federal education bureaucracy is ineffective.\n\nAbolishing the Department of Education would significantly enhance the management of programs in higher education. The Department currently oversees a student loan debt portfolio exceeding $1.6 trillion, making the Federal student aid program comparable in size to one of the Nation’s largest banks, Wells Fargo. Unlike Wells Fargo, which employs over 200,000 staff, the Department of Education has fewer than 1,500 employees in its Office of Federal Student Aid. The Department of Education is not a bank and should transfer these bank-like functions to an organization equipped to serve America’s students effectively.\n\nIn the end, the fundamental functions of the Department of Education can and should be transferred back to the States.\n\nSec. 2. Dissolution of the Department of Education and Reassigning Authority to the States. (a) The Secretary of Education shall take all necessary actions, to the greatest extent appropriate and permissible by law, to facilitate the closure of the Department of Education and return educational authority to the States and local communities, ensuring the effective and continuous provision of essential services, programs, and benefits that Americans depend on.\n\n(b) In alignment with the Department of Education’s authorities, the Secretary of Education shall ensure that the distribution of any Federal Department of Education funds conforms to strict compliance with Federal law and Administration policy, which includes the stipulation that any program or activity receiving Federal assistance must cease any illegal discrimination disguised under the terms “diversity, equity, and inclusion” or comparable terminology promoting gender ideology.\n\nSec. 3. General Provisions. (a) This order shall not be construed to impair or otherwise affect:\n\n(i) the authority granted by law to any executive department or agency, or their heads; or\n\n(ii) the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget related to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals.\n\n(b) This order shall be enforced in accordance with applicable law and subject to the availability of funds.\n\n(c) This order is not designed to, and does not, create any rights or benefits, substantive or procedural, that may be enforced at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other individual.\n\nDONALD J.

I think every young person dreams about a phone call like that,” the “West Side Story” actress gushed. “This one is certainly extra special as a huge Disney fan.”\n\nZegler added, “To get to bring [Snow White] to life in such a unique way and such a special way, it’s just a beautiful opportunity, and I’m very honored.”\n\nAsked about the “modern spin” she put on the character, the Golden Globe winner replied, “It’s all about bridging a classic to a modern age to bring it to these beautiful young people.\n\n“Her superpower remains her heart, you know, that’s always been the core of this story. That’s always been the core of the Disney Company.”\n\nThe film, she said, is intended for both children and the “inner child in all of us.”\n\nZegler’s comments, made just one day before the film’s release, struck a starkly different tone than remarks she previously made about the original, which she’s labeled dated and “weird.” \n\n“The original cartoon came out in 1937 and very evidently so,” she said in an interview with “Extra” at the 2022 D23 Expo. \n\n“There’s a big focus on her love story with the guy who literally stalks her. Weird, weird,” she added of the animated film. “So we didn’t do that this time.”\n\nZegler went on to share that the remake would take “a different approach” to Snow White’s tale and is “really not about the love story at all.”\n\nIn 2022, the actress also told Entertainment Weekly that she was “scared of the original cartoon” and only “watched it once and then never picked it up again” until she was cast in the 2025 live-action version.\n\nZegler’s opinion of the original film wasn’t all she’s been slammed for, however. Her attacks on Donald Trump supporters and support for Palestine have drawn the ire from more conservative corners of the internet. Her views on the Israel-Hamas war also oppose those of her “Snow White” co-star, Israeli actress Gal Gadot, 39, who plays the Evil Queen. \n\nThe many controversies surrounding Zegler, Gadot and the film in general led Disney to scale back its premiere, much to the chagrin of some of its cast.\n\nWhile both Gadot and Zegler attended the event, they did not do a Q&A or any press interviews.\n\n“Snow White” hits theaters on Friday, March 21.","summary":"The fairest role of them all?","url":"https://nypost.com/2025/03/20/entertainment/rachel-zegler-calls-snow-white-role-honor-of-a-lifetime-after-backlash/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/03/100780057.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/HSZLpzpk-RyIcpnTz.mp4","publish_date":"2025-03-21 00:06:48","author":"Sean Mandell","authors":["Sean Mandell"],"language":"en","source_country":"zm","sentiment":0.187},{"id":302432156,"title":"World News | Pakistan High Commission in Delhi Celebrates National Day with Iftar Event","text":"New Delhi [India], March 21 (ANI): The Pakistan High Commission in New Delhi marked its National Day with an Iftar gathering, attended by dignitaries, diplomats, and prominent personalities.\nAmong the notable attendees was former Union Minister Mani Shankar Aiyar, who participated in the event as a guest.

Ramzan, the holiest month in the Islamic calendar, holds profound spiritual significance for Muslims worldwide. Observed in the ninth month of the Hijri calendar, it is a period of deep devotion, self-restraint, and reflection. One of the five pillars of Islam, fasting--referred to as Roza--requires abstaining from food, drink, and other physical needs from dawn to sunset. The month is also a time for prayer, charity, and strengthening communal bonds, with Iftar serving as an important moment for breaking the day's fast in a spirit of togetherness.

At the same time, India has asserted that national security remains paramount and has reiterated its resolve to take decisive measures against any threats to its sovereignty and territorial integrity.

Our own native supply would substantially reduce our carbon footprint and emissions and substantially lower the cost of energy to consumers.\n\nThe last government, in 2019, despite being almost totally dependent on imports through subsea pipes, made a grossly irresponsible decision to stop issuing oil and gas exploration off our coast. The result is that today Ireland’s energy security and supply are on a precarious knife edge.\n\nThe situation was exacerbated in 2023 by the inexplicable decision by then energy minister Eamon Ryan to refuse a licence for further appraisal work at Barryroe, forcing the company into liquidation, despite many billions having been spent on the project over the previous decade.\n\nCommon sense, environmental and economic sense, should guide the current Government, unburdened by dogma and ideology, to urgently address the current critical situation by pragmatically reopening the Barryroe file, in the national interest.\n\n John Leahy, Wilton, Cork\n\nEurope must rely on its own defences\n\nDonald Trump’s idea of a ceasefire is to let Russia keep the 20% of Ukraine it occupies plus Crimea, and the US to get access to Ukraine’s valuable minerals.

However, if they request a more extensive reform package, elections will be scheduled for June next year. \"We have no reason to change the election dates,\" he added, stressing that the process will be conducted freely and fairly.

His reasoning is that the department is wasteful and is “doing no good.”\n\n“We’re going to be returning education, very simply, back to the states, where it belongs,” said Trump.\n\nBut the move was met with sharp criticism across the country, and South Florida was no exception.\n\nSpeaking with 7News, U.S. Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz, D-Fla., did not mince words.\n\n“[It would be] the worst possible decision for our children,” she said.\n\nThe congresswoman said the order puts much needed federal funding at risk.\n\n“First of all, it’s unlawful. Second of all, it would really devastate the lives of children like this who are vulnerable,” she said.\n\nAmong other things, the Department of Education distributes funding to schools across the country in low-income areas and supports programs to help ensure all students have what they need to receive an equitable education.\n\n“Funding is critical to the success of our students,” said Miami-Dade County Public Schools Superintendent Dr. Jose L. Dotres.\n\nThe superintendent said most of the schools in the county receive significant funding from the department, and he’s waiting to see what closing the agency would mean.\n\n“I do not know what the impact will be. One thing I do assure you is, we will continue to advocate, under whatever structure it is, for the needs of our students here locally,” he said.\n\nUnited Teachers of Dade President Karla Hernández-Mats also weighed in on the topic, Thursday afternoon.\n\n“We are concerned. We know that the funds we have for this year are already set, but what’s happening is a domino effect that will impact longitudinally what is going to happen in the access that our kids are going to have to really high-level programs,” she said.\n\nDespite concerns over the future of federal funding, a White House fact sheet explains that along with the closure, the administration will continue “to ensure the effective and uninterrupted delivery of services, programs and benefits on which Americans rely.”\n\nBut Wasserman Schultz isn’t buying it.\n\n“Donald Trump will hurt children, and he’s going to break the law by closing the department, and I know that I’m going to fight him tooth and nail, and it will be fought in the courts, and he’ll lose,” he said.\n\nCompletely dismantling the department cannot be done with an executive order alone. It would also take an act of Congress.\n\nCopyright 2024 Sunbeam Television Corp. All rights reserved.

in the academic world that freedom of research and speech is being challenged two months into US President Donald Trump's new term.\n\nSuri's lawyer demanded his release and denounced the arrest as a \"targeted, retaliatory detention\" that was intended \"to silence, or at the very least restrict and chill, his speech\" as well as that of others who \"express support for Palestinian rights.\"\n\nEarly Thursday evening Judge Patricia Tolliver Giles of the Eastern District of Virginia Court ordered Suri \"shall not be removed from the United States unless and until the court issues a contrary order.\"\n\nThe American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), which has also filed an emergency motion to stop the deportation, said Suri was being held at an immigration detention center in Louisiana.\n\n\"Ripping someone from their home and family, stripping them of their immigration status, and detaining them solely based on political viewpoint is a clear attempt by President Trump to silence dissent,\" said ACLU immigrant rights attorney Sophia Gregg. \n\n\"That is patently unconstitutional.\" \n\nOn Wednesday, the French government condemned the expulsion of a French space scientist meant to attend a conference in Houston, after officials searched his smartphone and found what they called \"hateful\" messages against US policy.\n\n\"Dr Khan Suri is an Indian national who was duly granted a visa to enter the United States to continue his doctoral research on peacebuilding in Iraq and Afghanistan,\" Georgetown University said in a statement.\n\n\"We are not aware of him engaging in any illegal activity, and we have not received a reason for his detention.\"\n\nNeither Secretary of State Marco Rubio \"nor any other government official has alleged that Mr Suri has committed any crime or, indeed, broke any law whatsoever,\" his lawyer said in the court filing.\n\nThe filing accused the US government of having detained Suri \"based on his family connection and constitutionally protected free speech.\"\n\n- Fellow arrested -\n\nSuri -- a fellow at Georgetown's Alwaleed Bin Talal Center for Muslim-Christian Understanding, according to the university website -- was arrested Monday at his home in Arlington, Virginia, according to Politico, which first reported on the story. \n\nTricia McLaughlin, a spokeswoman for the Department of Homeland Security, said on X that Suri was \"a foreign exchange student at Georgetown University actively spreading Hamas propaganda and promoting anti-Semitism on social media.\"\n\nMcLaughlin accused him of having \"close connections to a known or suspected terrorist, who is a senior advisor to Hamas.\"\n\nThe State Department decided the researcher was subject to deportation under a provision of immigration law that allows for expulsion if the visa holder's presence in the United States is determined to threaten US foreign policy, she added.\n\nHamas is a US-designated terror organization.\n\nGeorgetown University said it backs its \"community members' rights to free and open inquiry, deliberation and debate, even if the underlying ideas may be difficult, controversial or objectionable.\"\n\nCiting a petition filed by Suri's lawyer, Politico reported that Suri's wife is a US citizen of Palestinian descent, and that the couple believes they are being targeted because the government suspects they oppose US policy on Israel.\n\nube/sst/md/bfm/st","summary":"A US judge ordered Thursday that an Indian researcher at a top American university not be removed from the country, following his arrest

language online, according to polling.\n\nAmnesty International UK said a “toxic ‘bro’ culture is driving many young women away from social media altogether”, as it published findings from its recent survey.\n\nIts polling of more than 3,000 members of Gen Z – those aged 16 to 25 – in the UK last month saw controversial influencer Andrew Tate cited by half of the male respondents as most responsible for the spread of misogyny.\n\nAmong women, 58% attributed responsibility to Mr Trump.\n\nOverall 61% of Gen Z respondents said they feel misogynistic and divisive language on social media has grown because of statements or actions by political leaders.\n\nAsked which high-profile social media users bore responsibility for the spread of online misogyny, more than half (54%) of respondents said Tate, 48% cited Mr Trump, just over a third (35%) said tech billionaire Elon Musk – who is unelected but plays a key role in Mr Trump’s administration – and 23% said Reform UK MP Nigel Farage.\n\nMore than a third (37%) of all respondents said seeing misogynistic content on social media has affected their mental health – with women more likely than men to say this was the case (44% compared with 28%).\n\nA fifth of Gen Z women reported having left or avoided certain platforms after experiencing online misogynistic behaviour – with 40% of those mentioning X (formerly Twitter), 30% TikTok and 30% Instagram.\n\nThe findings come in the same week as former England manager Sir Gareth Southgate said “callous, manipulative and toxic influencers” trick young men into thinking women are against them.\n\nDelivering the 46th Richard Dimbleby Lecture at the University of London, Sir Gareth warned of young men “withdrawing into the online world, reluctant to talk or express their emotions” as “real-world communities and mentorship declines”.\n\nHe said a “void” in their search for direction is often now being filled by some influencers who “willingly trick young men into believing that success is measured by money or dominance”.\n\nThe Amnesty polling found young men were less likely than women to think online misogyny reflects real societal attitudes (51% of men compared with 71% of women).\n\nChiara Capraro, from Amnesty International UK, said: “This polling paints a deeply troubling picture of the digital world young people are forced to

In the Oval Office, at least, he has lived up to his promise with a blingy makeover.\nThe Republican has decked out the inner sanctum of the US presidency with gilded trophies and gold-plated, Trump-branded coasters, and filled almost every available inch of wall space with portraits of his predecessors.\nAlmost every day seems to bring something new. This week Trump unveiled a copy of the Declaration of Independence – the historic document triggering America’s freedom from the British monarchy 250 years ago.\nFar more than during his first term, it is as if the 78-year-old former reality television star and billionaire property mogul is creating something that is part-studio and part-exclusive real estate.\n“President Trump is very good at playing the role of Donald Trump,” Peter Loge, director of George Washington University’s School of Media, said.\n“The show is the point. Part of the show is the bling. It would be surprising if Trump did not remake the Oval Office into a TV set that reflected his brand.”\n\nBut there is also a serious political message behind Trump’s frenetic redecoration.\nThe Oval Office is the most potent symbol of American power, a backdrop to his frequent news conferences and televised meetings with foreign dignitaries – including a recent meltdown between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.\nIt was, therefore, no coincidence when the gallery of presidential portraits got a new addition: the 19th-century president James Polk.\nUnder Polk, the 11th US president, the United States saw its biggest period of territorial expansion by taking in huge swathes of the west coast, the southwest and Texas.\nIt was a clear piece of political symbolism at a time that Trump is alarming allies by openly talking about annexing Greenland, reclaiming the Panama Canal and taking over Gaza.\nEach president picks most of their decor from similar sources including the White House art collection, but they still manage to stamp a very personal touch on the Oval.\nThe difference from Trump’s Democratic predecessor Joe Biden could hardly be greater – as the 47th president himself is well aware.\n“Do you think Joe Biden would do this? I don’t think so,” Trump said Tuesday as he pulled back light-protecting drapes on the Declaration of Independence in an interview with Fox News Channel’s The Ingraham Angle.\nTrump also pointed out gold cherubs newly installed above the doorways. “They say angels bring good luck,” he said.\n\nBiden’s Oval was a relative model of restraint with five portraits around the famed fireplace, including wartime president Franklin D. Roosevelt’s directly above the hearth.\nTrump has nine – and that does not count others near his desk, including Republican icon Ronald Reagan’s.\nWhile Biden had a sprawling Swedish ivy plant that reputedly dated back to John F. Kennedy on the mantelpiece, Trump has seven ornate gilded vessels, some of which are more than 200 years old.\nAnd while both Trump and Biden had a bust of civil rights leader Martin Luther King on display, Trump has brought back the bust of Britain’s World War II prime minister Winston Churchill that he had during his first term.\nThe ostentatious display should probably not come as a surprise for a man who announced his first presidential run by descending on a golden escalator at Trump Tower in New York.\nThe billionaire has long branded everything he can with his name, from buildings to bibles.\nAnd Trump’s makeover rarely shies away from promoting both his own brand and an image of strength that has been central to his political career.\nRecently, one item that has been on permanent display is a large map identifying the “Gulf of America”, which the Trump administration has renamed from the Gulf of Mexico.\n\nTrump is even planning to pave over the famed Rose Garden that the Oval Office overlooks, to give it the patio-like feel of his Mar-a-Lago residence in Florida.\n“The grass just doesn’t work,” Trump told Fox, adding that it gets “soaking wet”.\nOne of Trump’s proudest touches, though, is a very unconventional portrait that hangs near those of his illustrious forebears.\nRight outside the Oval Office in a gold frame hangs a photo of Trump – his 2023 mugshot, as featured on the cover of a tabloid newspaper, from when he was booked in Georgia for alleged attempts to interfere with the 2020 election.","summary":"US president has decked out office with gilded trophies and gold-plated, Trump-branded coasters, and filled walls with gold-framed portraits.","url":"https://www.scmp.com/news/world/united-states-canada/article/3303239/trump-brings-bling-gold-plated-oval-office-makeover","image":"https://cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2025/03/21/ceee7bf8-dee2-436c-8049-b4754e20c773_d6fbf005.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-03-20 23:56:55","author":"Agence France-Presse","authors":["Agence France-Presse"],"language":"en","source_country":"cn","sentiment":0.299},{"id":302426160,"title":"Georgetown researcher arrest escalates Trump speech crackdown, scholars say","text":"Washington, DC – Nader Hashemi, a professor of Middle East and Islamic politics at Georgetown University, has been a vocal critic of efforts to silence pro-Palestine protesters and academics amid Israel’s war in Gaza.\n\nThose efforts reached new heights under the administration of President Donald Trump, which last week took the extraordinary measure of detaining and seeking to deport Columbia University student Mahmoud Khalil, a permanent resident married to a US citizen.\n\nThen, immigration authorities came for one of Hashemi’s own students. Earlier this week, agents detained Badar Khan Suri, a postdoctoral fellow at Georgetown’s Prince Alwaleed bin Talal Center for Muslim-Christian Understanding, which Hashemi directs.\n\n“It’s shocking, and it sort of confirms our worst fears that authoritarian repression on American universities is expanding under the Trump administration,” said Hashemi.\n\nCivil liberties groups and rights observers have decried — and challenged — Khalil’s attempted deportation, which Hashemi and other observers describe as an extension of the anti-Palestinian bias in the US government.\n\nThat has often involved conflating anti-Jewish sentiment and support for Hamas, which the US categorises as a “terrorist organisation”, with statements criticising Israeli military action or support for Palestinians, they say.\n\nBut Hashemi and his colleagues see the targeting of Suri, who is in the US on a student visa, as going a step further, given that he was detained not for public protests but for his alleged personal views.\n\nKhaled Elgindy, a visiting scholar at Georgetown who focuses on Palestinian-Israel affairs, said the Trump administration’s enforcement efforts appear to be entering “a different realm with this case”, extending beyond student visa holders and US residents sanctioned for their protest activity.\n\n“This person seems to have been targeted, not for his activism,” he said, “but simply for being suspected of holding certain views.”\n\n‘Adverse foreign policy consequences’\n\nFor its part, the US Department of Homeland Security on Wednesday confirmed that Secretary of State Marco Rubio had approved Suri’s deportation.\n\nSpokesperson Tricia McLaughlin said Rubio made the determination by citing the same law used to justify the attempted deportation of Khalil.\n\nIt is a provision of the 1952 Immigration and Nationality Act that gives the secretary of state power to remove any non-citizen whose presence in the US is deemed to have “adverse foreign policy consequences”.\n\nMcLaughlin accused Suri of “actively spreading Hamas propaganda and promoting antisemitism on social media”, without providing further details. The Department of Homeland Security did not respond to a request for further information from Al Jazeera.\n\nShe also said Suri “has close connections to a known or suspected terrorist, who is a senior adviser to Hamas”.\n\nOn Wednesday, Suri’s wife, Mapheze Saleh, confirmed to Al Jazeera that she is a US citizen. Meanwhile, Ahmed Yousef, a former adviser to assassinated Hamas political leader Ismail Haniyeh, confirmed to The New York Times that Suri was his son-in-law.\n\nYousef told the newspaper he had left his position in the political wing of Hamas over a decade ago and has publicly criticised the group’s decision to attack Israel on October 7, 2023. He said that Suri was not involved in “political activism”, much less support for Hamas.\n\nSuri has roundly rejected the allegations against him, his lawyer, Hassan Ahmad, told US media. His legal team, which includes the Virginia office of the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), has filed a petition at the US District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia seeking his release.\n\nHe remained at a US Immigration and Customs Enforcement detention centre in Louisiana on Thursday.\n\nIn a statement on Wednesday, Georgetown University also said it supports its community members “rights to free and open deliberation and debate, even if the underlying ideas may be difficult, controversial or objectionable”.\n\nMeanwhile, the Alwaleed Center issued a passionate defence of Suri on Thursday, saying he has become the victim of a “campaign by the Trump Administration to destroy higher education in the United States and punish their political opponents”.\n\n‘Direct threat to learning’\n\nBoth Suri and his wife Saleh had previously been singled out by “Campus Watch”, a project out of the Middle East Forum that says it “reviews and critiques Middle East studies in North American universities”.\n\nCritics have accused the project of being a tool to silence criticism of Israel in higher education.\n\nHashemi, meanwhile, described Suri as a “very respected and serious academic”.\n\n“In many ways, [Suri] was the exact opposite to Mahmoud Khalil, in the sense that he was not an organiser or a leader. He was simply a researcher and postdoctoral fellow at our centre,” Hashemi said, “who was just working on themes of minority rights, majoritarianism and the problem of authoritarianism.”\n\nElgindy, meanwhile, said the Trump administration continues to embrace a “dangerous conflation” when it comes to complex discussions of Palestinian rights and resistance.\n\n“Really any expression of solidarity with Palestinians or criticism of Israel is deemed in and of itself, to be both anti-Semitic and inherently supportive of terrorism and Hamas,” he said.\n\nElgindy described a “genuine atmosphere of fear” when it comes to open academic debate on the complex realities that define the Israel-Palestine conflict.\n\n“It really cuts to the heart of academic freedom — if people have to censor themselves, if students are afraid to ask certain questions or raise certain points because maybe someone in the class is recording and is going to share with some of these extremist groups out there that have been doxxing students,” he said.\n\n“The intent is to chill debate and to make people second guess whether they should express certain views at all.”\n\nA ‘blatant attack’\n\nOn Thursday, Congressman Don Beyer, who represents northern Virginia, also weighed in on Suri’s detainment, calling it a violation of his right to “due process” and a “blatant attack on the First Amendment”, referring to the US Constitution’s protections for freedom of speech.\n\nHis statement offered a preview of the principles likely to be raised in federal courts.\n\nThe Trump administration has taken the broad position that those constitutional rights are not extended to temporary visa holders or even US permanent residents.\n\nBut courts have largely upheld the right of immigrants to enjoy free speech, the freedom of assembly and other basic liberties.\n\nBeyer called for a judge to swiftly make a ruling on Suri’s challenge to his imminent deportation, pointing to “the administration’s track record of attempting to deny constitutional rights in ways that are difficult to undo before judicial remedies can be provided”.\n\nEarlier this week my constituent, Badar Khan Suri, a Georgetown postdoctoral fellow, was detained outside his Rosslyn home. He remains in detention despite not being accused of a crime, a clear violation of his constitutional rights. He must be released.https://t.co/PTQvM0ys2k pic.twitter.com/aUpPVFuQ0k\n— Rep. Don Beyer (@RepDonBeyer) March 20, 2025\n\nLate Thursday, a federal judge barred the Trump administration from immediately deporting Suri. His lawyers told Reuters news agency he was awaiting a date for a hearing in immigration court.\n\nBoth Hashemi and Elgindy, meanwhile, pointed to the need for the academic community to take a firm stand against Trump’s actions, while acknowledging the difficult landscape educators and administrators face.\n\nBeyond the risks to professors on temporary work visas, Trump has also pledged to cut federal funds to institutions that do not take severe enough measures against protesters and “agitators”.\n\nHis administration has already cut $400m in grants and contracts for Columbia University.\n\n“I think the worst is yet to come,” Hashemi said. “Unless the people stand up and push back.”","summary":"Georgetown fellow Badar Khan Suri, an Indian citizen, was targeted over his personal views on Palestine, supporters say.","url":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/3/20/georgetown-researcher-arrest-escalates-trump-speech-crackdown-scholars-say?traffic_source=rss","image":"https://www.aljazeera.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/AP25079425838555-1742500366.jpg?resize=1920%2C1440","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-03-20 23:56:08","author":"Apps Support,Joseph Stepansky","authors":["Apps Support","Joseph Stepansky"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"QA","sentiment":-0.032},{"id":302427350,"title":"Donald Trump Has Issued An Executive Order To Close The Department Of Education.

More and scope of the Education Department alongside school children signing their own versions, during a ceremony in the East Room of the White House on March 20, 2025 in Washington, DC. The order instructs Education Secretary Linda McMahon, former head of the Small Business Administration and co-founder of the World Wrestling Entertainment, to shrink the $100 billion department, which cannot be dissolved without Congressional approval. (Photo by Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images)\nGetty Images\n\nToday President Donald Trump issued his anticipated executive order to close the U.S. Department of Education. But the order is short on specifics; what can President Trump and Secretary of Education Linda McMahon actually legally do?\n\nThe Department of Education was created in 1979, but many of its signature responsibilities actually pre-date the department itself. While the department may administer these programs, it did not create them.\n\nTitle I, which provides federal funding to help bolster local education resources for low-income families, was established as part of the original Elementary and Secondary Education Act in 1965. The Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) was originally passed as the Education for All Handicapped Children Act in 1975.\n\nThose two programs account for over $30 billion in funding from the department to local school districts. Established by Congress, these are programs that in theory cannot be simply ended by a President.\n\nAfter citing rationale for closing the department, the critical portion of the executive order is this\n\nMORE FOR YOU\n\nUkraine Triple Taps Russia’s Engels Bomber Base\n\nTrump’s Presidency And Student Loans: Today’s Education Department Announcement Explained\n\nNYT ‘Strands’ Today: Hints, Spangram And Answers For Thursday, March 20th\n\nThe Secretary of Education shall, to the maximum extent appropriate and permitted by law, take all necessary steps to facilitate the closure of the Department of Education and return authority over education to the States and local communities while ensuring the effective and uninterrupted delivery of services, programs, and benefits on which Americans rely.\n\n“The maximum extent appropriate and permitted by law” is the crux of the matter. The department cannot be dissolved without an act of Congress, though the administration could continue to hollow out the department by firing more staff. As CNN reported, White House press secretary said ahead of the signing that the order would move to “greatly minimize the agency,” and that certain “critical functions” would remain under the department umbrella.\n\n“Critical functions” could be any of the grant programs that were created by Congress. Project 2025 proposed turning Title I and IDEA funds into block grants to the states to use as they wish, with Title I funding to be reduced to zero in ten years. And Trump has also said that he would cut off funding to schools that did not comply with certain of his requirements.\n\nOther functions of the department have already been hit by personnel cuts, including the Office of Civil Rights (as reported by CNN) and the National Center for Educational Statistics (as reported by ABC News). The NCES collects and compiles data about U.S, education, including the National Assessment of Educational Progress, the source of data that the executive order cites in its rationale for the closing of the department.\n\nSchool funding expert Bruce Baker, writing for the Albert Shanker Institute, estimates that eliminating federal aid would lead to major drops in student achievement, a sort of federally-induced learning loss. The effect of turning them to block grants would depend on how the state used the money; Baker notes the irony that state grants would be based on need, but the state would not be under any obligation to give the money to districts where that need exists. Baker predicts the block grants would exacerbate the achievement gaps in most states.\n\nIn the end, the executive order doesn’t tell us much that we didn’t know--Trump intends to end the department, somehow, while maintaining some of the programs, in some form.\n\nEducation Reform Now, an education reform advocacy group, has created a simple explainer for breaking down the areas of authority over the department and its program and showing what legal limits Trump and McMahon will face.

Israel ‘s Prime Minister presented Fetterman with the bizarre gift during an awkward exchange in his office in Jerusalem. In an apparent move to double down on his support for Israel, Fetterman presented Netanyahu with a framed article from a Philadelphia newspaper that memorialized the PM’s brother, an Israeli soldier who was killed in 1976 during an Israeli raid in Uganda.\n\nIn return, the Israeli leader offered Fetterman a gift of his own, jokingly asking: ‘What can I give a man who has everything? How about giving him a beeper?’ ‘This is a silver-plated beeper. The real beeper is, like, one-tenth the weight,’ Netanyahu said as he handed the pager to the laughing senator. ‘It’s nothing, but it changes history.’ The gift is an apparent reference to the Israel’s operation in Lebanon last September that saw the military detonate pagers that were used by members of Hezbollah. The explosive attack left 42 people dead and thousands injured.\n\nNetanyahu presented a golden pager to President Donald Trump in February when the pair met at the White House , but some have questioned why he would give this symbolic gift to a junior member of the senate . Fetterman, however, has repeatedly voiced his support for Israel, despite his Democratic Party being highly critical of the offensive in Gaza . Video of the exchange, posted online yesterday, shows how Fetterman laughed as Netanyahu presented him with the gift.\n\nHe appeared to admire the device before saying, ‘When that story broke, I was like, ‘Oh, I love it, I love it.’ And now, it’s like, thank you for this.’ ‘Thank you,’ he said again as he shook the prime minister’s hand. Fetterman on Tuesday doubled down his support for Israel after it shattered the tenuous ceasefire with Hamas by bombarding Gaza with air strikes. ‘Hamas does not want peace. I unapologetically, 100% stand with Israel, and demand the release of all remaining hostages,’ he tweeted, noting that he was ‘sending this from Israel’.\n\nBut his message and display of support for Netanyhu’s troops has prompted backlash from liberals who have branded him the ‘most despicable scum in Congress’. ‘I can’t believe this man once conned progressives into campaigning for him and defending him,’ one X user said of Fetterman. ‘Forget pro Israel, he’s pro Netanyahu, who just massacred over 100 kids to avoid going to court for his trial. Sick stuff.’ ‘This despicable ghoul is a US senator. What a joke!’ echoed another. ‘OMG. To be this cruel and this tacky all at the same time,’ one user penned. Another wrote: ‘Who doesn’t enjoy a gift from a criminal thug murderer?’\n\n‘Proud of their terrorism. Sickos of the highest degree,’ said another. One added: ‘Absolutely no way this is real… right???’ ‘Why is the senator from Pennsylvania hanging out in Israel? And who’s paying for it?’ another asked. Fetterman has broken with his party’s liberal wing several times, including maintaining his staunch support for Israel and supporting the Laken Riley Act focused on illegal immigrants.\n\nThe outspoken senator also made headlines earlier this month when he criticized his party’s response to Trump’s address to Congress . Democrats faced backlash for several stunts and protests during the address, including refusing to stand and clap for a young cancer survivor who was honored by Trump, while one congressman was even booted from the chamber for his antics. ‘I don’t think that was the best look for our party last night,’ Fetterman said when asked by Fox News for his reaction to how Democrats behaved during the speech.\n\nFetterman also took to X to share a more hostile take on his party’s performance, which be branded a ‘sad cavalcade of self owns and unhinged petulance.’ ‘It only makes Trump look more presidential and restrained,’ he said as he shared a Politico article that mocked Democrats who held up protest signs during the speech as ‘giving bingo.’ ‘We’re becoming the metaphorical car alarms that nobody pays attention to — and it may not be the winning message,’ Fetterman posted.\n\nDespite suffering health issues during his run for the senate in 2022, including having a stroke that impaired his speech , and his apparent break from his party, Fetterman has been floated by some as a potential Democratic presidential candidate in 2028. Fetterman was floated as a potential candidate as Democrats begin their search for a standard bearer to lead them into the 2028 election, following Kamala Harris’ resounding defeat in November. Comedian Bill Maher even called for him to run , saying ‘Democrats need to find their Trump.’\n\nFetterman was previously asked about his White House ambitions in December 2023, to which he told Politico that he was ‘not thinking about 2028’. Despite losing in a landslide to Trump, Harris surprisingly topped a post-election poll among Democrats, where she led the field with 41 per cent of the vote, according to a Puck News/Echelon Insights survey. The rest of the pack combined – 13 Democratic politicians who all scored in the single digits – garnered 43 per cent, with 16 per cent of those surveyed saying they were ‘unsure’ to the question of who they would vote for if a party primary were held now.\n\nWant more stories like this from the Daily Mail?

-\n\nHowever, that push could be complicated by splits emerging within the group pressing for joint borrowing. \n\nEastern countries such as Poland and the Baltics have already massively ramped up their military spending -- far outstripping NATO's two-percent target on defence.\n\nThey are laser-focused on the menace posed by Russian President Vladimir Putin and want to make sure that any funding goes towards making Europe stronger in the face of Moscow. \n\n\"We have to rearm ourselves, because otherwise we will be the next victim of Russian aggression,\" said Lithuanian President Gitanas Nauseda. \n\nBut nations further to the West -- such as Spain and Italy -- have long dragged their heels on defence and are less convinced that the Kremlin is an imminent threat. \n\n\"It is important to take into account that the challenges that we face in the southern neighbourhood are a bit different to the ones that the eastern flank face,\" said Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez. \n\nHe pointed to broader needs to \"strengthen border controls\", fight terrorism and tackle cyber threats.\n\n\"These are the things that, of course, we have to take into account,\" he said.\n\nWhile the push for a Covid-style joint borrowing programme faces hurdles, others are floating new proposals.\n\nItaly has put forward a common guarantee scheme that would seek to raise some 200 billion euros in private finance without raising debt levels. \n\nbur-del/raz/ec/fox","summary":"EU leaders on Thursday broadly welcomed a blueprint from Brussels to help ramp up defence spending to face Russia -- but a raft of countries pressed to go further and deploy joint borrowing.","url":"https://www.guampdn.com/news/national/as-russia-looms-eu-defence-plans-fail-to-quell-joint-borrowing-calls/article_6cee0c74-cb7d-5485-8ea6-892a8de41d7f.html","image":"https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/guampdn.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/5/1d/51dec577-dc96-57e5-82c2-d5550d0bcbe8/67dc3fb5bbc8c.image.jpg?crop=341%2C341%2C85%2C0&resize=200%2C200&order=crop%2Cresize","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-03-20 23:53:50","author":"Ludovic Marin,Max Delany AFP","authors":["Ludovic Marin","Max Delany AFP"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gu","sentiment":-0.001},{"id":302427840,"title":"Trump pressures courts after reprimand on deportations","text":"US President Donald Trump demanded Thursday that courts stop blocking his agenda, edging closer to a constitutional showdown after a judge suggested the administration ignored an order to block summary deportations.\n\nA federal judge, in a strongly worded order, gave the Justice Department until Tuesday to explain why it went ahead with flights to prison in El Salvador of Venezuelan migrants, some of whom say they committed no crime and were targeted only for their tattoos.\n\nTrump, in a scathing attack on the judiciary that would have been unthinkable coming from most presidents, demanded that the Supreme Court intervene.\n\n\"It is our goal to MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN, and such a high aspiration can never be done if Radical and Highly Partisan Judges are allowed to stand in the way of JUSTICE,\" Trump wrote in a Truth Social post aimed at Chief Justice John Roberts.\n\n\"STOP NATIONWIDE INJUNCTIONS NOW, BEFORE IT IS TOO LATE,\" Trump wrote in all capital letters.\n\n\"If Justice Roberts and the United States Supreme Court do not fix this toxic and unprecedented situation IMMEDIATELY, our Country is in very serious trouble!\"\n\nRoberts, who was nominated by Republican George W. Bush, a day earlier issued a rare rebuke by the country's top justice to remarks of the president after Trump called for the impeachment of the judge who ruled on the immigration case.\n\n\"For more than two centuries, it has been established that impeachment is not an appropriate response to disagreement concerning a judicial decision,\" Roberts said in a brief statement. \n\n\"The normal appellate review process exists for that purpose.\"\n\nJames Boasberg, the chief judge of the US District Court in Washington, on Saturday had issued an emergency order against the deportation of Venezuelans as they sought legal recourse.\n\nHe said that two flights in the air needed to turn around. El Salvador's President Nayyib Bukele, who has offered to take in prisoners on the cheap in Latin America's largest prison, responded on social media: \"Oopsie... Too late.\"\n\n- 'Woefully insufficient' -\n\nIn a new order on Thursday, Boasberg said that an acting field office director of the Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency explained that the Trump administration was considering justifying its actions by saying the issue was a matter of \"state secrets.\"\n\n\"This is woefully insufficient,\" Boasberg wrote, saying that \"the Government again evaded its obligations.\"\n\nHe said that a regional official in charge of immigration enforcement was not in a position to attest to cabinet-level arguments against a federal court.\n\nHe gave the Trump administration until Tuesday to explain why it did not violate his restraining order.\n\nOfficials said that 237 Venezuelans were flown to El Salvador, some of them as Trump invoked the rarely used 1798 Alien Enemies Act to remove alleged members of Tren de Aragua, a Venezuelan gang. \n\nSecretary of State Marco Rubio said Monday that he had confidence that the deported Venezuelans were gang members but that even if not, they were illegally in the United States. \n\nA lawyer for one of the men, Jerce Reyes Barrios, said that he was a professional soccer player in Venezuela with no criminal record who applied through legal channels for asylum in the United States after demonstrating against Nicolas Maduro, the leftist president whose legitimacy is rejected by Washington and the opposition. \n\nThe lawyer, Linette Tobin, said that US authorities accused him of gang membership based on a tattoo that in fact was associated with his fandom for Real Madrid.\n\nRepresentative Jamie Raskin, the top Democrat on the House Judiciary Committee, said that Trump was \"refusing to accept that we are still a nation of laws and not royal edicts.\"\n\n\"Amazingly, Trump believes that his election means that he can do whatever he wants even in violation of the Constitution,\" he said.","summary":"US President Donald Trump demanded Thursday that courts stop blocking his agenda, edging closer to a constitutional showdown after a judge suggested the administration ignored an order to block summary deportations.","url":"https://www.guampdn.com/news/national/trump-pressures-courts-after-reprimand-on-deportations/article_383dada8-14f8-515d-b8c0-49836689c38d.html","image":"https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/guampdn.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/8/96/8964f7b4-2a1b-5d0f-b574-261ad599a48d/67dcb01b3adb9.image.jpg?crop=341%2C341%2C85%2C0&resize=200%2C200&order=crop%2Cresize","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-03-20 23:53:27","author":"Republican George W,Shaun TANDON AFP","authors":["Republican George W","Shaun TANDON AFP"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gu","sentiment":-0.414}]}
