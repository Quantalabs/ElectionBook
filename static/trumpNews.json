Not the Kremlin's blood-soaked dictator, Putin, but his pal, the US President Donald Trump, who blithely declared on Monday: 'I was told they made a mistake.'\n\nA mistake? Let's consider what happened in Sumy on Palm Sunday.\n\nOn that sun-drenched start to Easter Week, a Russian Iskander-M ballistic missile slammed into the centre of the Ukrainian city, which has a population similar in size to that of Southampton or Cincinnati in the United States.\n\nResult: carnage. Dozens of dead and wounded civilians, including children. Horrific images of pavements strewnwith casualties.\n\nMinutes later, another Iskander-M missile landed on, or near, the same spot. Certainly in time to finish off survivors of the first impact and kill or maim the local emergency services' responders who had reached the scene.\n\nFor the record, Iskander-Ms are accurate to within seven metres of their aiming point. Each carries a massive warhead, around 700kg of high explosive.\n\nA Russian 'mistake' Mr Trump? If so, I've seen a few like it since the start of Putin's full-scale invasion of Ukraine. \n\nThere was the ghastly kilometre of the E-40 highway west of Kyiv on April Fool's Day 2022. As the mist lifted, it revealed to us a trail of bloated and burned corpses – of civilians who a month earlier had been gunned down by Russian forces as they tried to flee the Ukrainian capital in their cars.\n\nIn nearby Bucha, I watched as the rotting bodies of executed residents were exhumed from a mass grave. More than 400 were murdered in the Kyiv satellite town during the brief Russian occupation.\n\nI'd just arrived in Kyiv earlier this month when news came through of a hotel in Dnipro where I've often stayed on the way to the Donbas front line.\n\nThe Bartolomeo, next to the Dnieper River, had been hit in a Shahed drone attack on the city. I remember watching a joyous wedding take place there last summer. Now it was on fire.\n\nA mistake – like the destruction of the pizza restaurants I once patronised in Kramatorsk and Pokrovsk or the turreted hotel in Sloviansk that was called 'Camelot'. All reduced to rubble by Russian missiles, often with mass civilian casualties.\n\nMistake, after mistake, after mistake.\n\nOf course what happened in Sumy was not a 'mistake' but yet another terror attack, designed to crush the morale of the Ukrainian population. \n\nIt is all of a piece with the nightly Shahed blitzes, the winter targeting of the energy infrastructure, the hunting of civilians by Russian FPV kamikaze drones in the streets of Kherson and the recent fatal strike on a children's playground in President Zelensky's home city of Kryvyi Rih.\n\nIn his desire to cut a self-aggrandising 'peace' deal with Russia – never mind what the Ukrainians think of the Putin-dictated terms – Trump has become an apologist for murder.\n\nAn atrocity is likened by him to an error of judgment, a slip of the pen. A wrong answer. He is making excuses for Putin.\n\nHow do we categorise murder on an even greater scale? Was the Holocaust simply a 'big mistake'?\n\nThis Holy Week, furious Ukrainians have taken to social media to make such comparisons and lambast Trump.\n\n'Maybe the September 11, 2001 attack on the Twin Towers by Al Qaeda extremists was also a mistake?' asked one woman. 'Not a terrorist act, but a mistake?'\n\nAnother wrote: 'They were wrong. Twice. What unfortunate mistakes! God, how pathetic this is [that] people have entrusted the management of a great country to a pathetic slug. This is truly a mistake.'\n\nEven before his Sumy utterances, Trump's standing among Ukrainians was plunging fast.\n\nThere was shock when he opened ceasefire negotiations with Russia without Ukraine being at the table.\n\nThis turned to anger and disbelief following the extraordinary televised dressing down Trump and his Vice-President JD Vance gave Zelensky at the White House in February. Soon afterwards, Trump paused US military aid and intelligence sharing.\n\nDuring my recent visit, I noticed how disaffection was showing even on one of Kyiv's most striking landmarks – a little green car on display in St Michael's Square.\n\nIt used to belong to the Samolylenko family from Bucha. The last journey they made in it was on March 14th, 2022, when they attempted to flee the killing zone, only to be stopped by a hail of Russian bullets.\n\nOne can still see the holes where at least seven rounds passed through the driver's door, severely wounding Mr Samolyenko. Others penetrated the rear passenger compartment, almost killing a female relative.\n\nAfter the invaders withdrew from the Kyiv region, the city fathers began to collect the wrecks of Putin's failed armoured thrust. Two dozen burned-out tanks were arranged into a kind of atrocity exhibition on the cobbles of St Michael's Square.\n\nIncongruous among the otherwise military exhibits, was – and is – the Samolyenko's lime green saloon.\n\nAt first, only bullet holes marred its paintwork. But over the years, passers-by began to decorate the bodywork in a different manner.\n\nDoves of peace and blue and yellow flags appeared.\n\nMostly, though, the additions were graffiti which expressed civilian Ukraine's defiance. The most common comment can be translated as 'Putin is a ****head'.\n\nThe number of ruined tanks on display has steadily shrunk since 2022 – perhaps to be melted down into new ones. But the little car remains. And in recent weeks a new kind of graffiti has appeared on its now iconic bodywork.\n\nOn the driver's door, an unknown hand has scrawled in black marker pen: 'Elon Musk Dumb Ass'.\n\nBelow that, and just above where the burst of bullets struck, someone else has written, in larger, capital letters, the unequivocal message: F*** TRUMP. \n\nSuch new emotions are expressed in a number of ways here. Recently, I took a Facetime call from a Ukrainian friend serving in a unit on the crucial Pokrovsk front. He was travelling in the back of a lurching military SUV.\n\nAfter exchanging greetings, he asked me: 'Notice anything about my appearance?'\n\nI squinted at the phone screen and shrugged. He seemed to be wearing the same body armour and camouflage he always wore.\n\n'I've taken off the American flag,' he said. And so he had.\n\nA half Stars and Stripes-half Ukraine flag had been Velcroed to his body armour since I first met him in Donbas in spring 2023. Now it was gone.\n\nHe had loved America. No more.\n\n'Bring me a British flag when you come next time to replace it,' he said. 'I know we can still trust you guys.'\n\nOthers here don't want to hear about Trump, even though he has their futures in his hands. It's simply too frightening and depressing.\n\n'Honey, look what Trump...' began my friend Oleks to his wife, as he scrolled through the latest presidential pronouncements on social media last week.\n\n'Stop right there!' she shrieked. 'I don't want to know what that man's just said.'\n\nAnd so the conversation ended.\n\nThey have two daughters, one an early teenager, the other nine, and live on the eighth floor of a block of flats – far above the building's basement air raid shelter.\n\nOleks says the nine-year-old spends, on average, four nights a week sleeping in their apartment's enamel bath tub.\n\nThe bathroom doesn't have windows so it's the 'safest' place.\n\nThe girl is very scared. But the Russian blitz – the nightly mistakes according to Trump – has become an integral part of her young life.\n\n'One night she had a sleepover with some school friends and then there was an air raid alert,' Oleks recalled.\n\n'We moved them out into the corridor. I could hear them talking amongst themselves.\n\n'They were looking at their smart phones and discussing what they were seeing on the official Ukraine air raid app.\n\n'They were assessing whether the raid was a ballistic missile or a Shahed drone attack. Imagine! These girls are nine years old.'\n\nPerhaps he should reassure them it's all simply a 'mistake' rather than attempted murder.\n\nWith friends like Trump, Putin can make as many mistakes as he likes.","summary":"US President Donald Trump blithely declared on Monday: 'I was told they made a mistake.'

That is why they have been tarred with the brush of antisemitism by the Trump White House, and accused of hosting students “hostile to American values” and “supportive of terrorism”.\n\nThe Harvard administration is fighting back and has refused to give up its freedom. Other US schools should emulate its example, and resist the totalitarian attacks of the Trump government. For decades, America’s top schools have attracted the best minds globally; but with these chilling developments, American universities may lose their attractiveness, as international students head for less suffocating climes. According to Al Jazeera, around 1,500 foreign students and faculty members have had their visas revoked by the Trump government. Antisemitism is a fig leaf, and what the US government really wants to do is target academic freedom and support for Palestine on campuses. The fact is that student activism has a long history in America, as students were at the forefront of the anti-Vietnam War movement in the 1960s. Now, as the US bankrolls and supports another unjust war, the administration is keen to stamp out all dissent on campus, in the process harming the reputation of American higher education for years to come.\n\nPublished in Dawn, April 19th, 2025","summary":"AMONGST the ‘enemies of the people’ in Trumpian America are elite universities seen as the bastions of liberal thought and academic excellence.

Tesla had already fallen 7pc the day before, and Meta, Microsoft, and Alphabet were not far behind. In just three days, nearly $2 trillion in market value was wiped from America’s largest tech firms.\n\nThe crash wasn’t triggered by a product flop or a bad earnings report. President Donald Trump had just announced sweeping new tariffs, 10pc on all imports, with steep penalties for key trading partners, including China, India and Vietnam. For Big Tech, which relies on deeply interwoven global supply chains, the blow was immediate and brutal. The markets did not just react; they imploded.\n\nPrevious tariff announcements have rattled Wall Street, but this one is different. The scope, timing and targets threaten to fundamentally reshape how global tech operates. This wasn’t just an economic hiccup; it was a structural tremor. Apple’s iPhone, which depends on Chinese and Vietnamese factories, is now caught between rising input costs and collapsing margins. Analysts warn a flagship iPhone could soon cost more than $2,300. And Apple is just one node in a vast ecosystem.\n\nMeta, Google and Amazon also lean heavily on Asian manufacturing for hardware, including VR devices, server racks, even cloud infrastructure. Tesla’s electric vehicles rely on components from India and China. And in the world of AI, where cutting-edge development depends on GPUs and servers often sourced from the same region, the consequences are especially severe. Tariffs on key computing parts are expected to raise development costs by more than a third, a surge that could cripple smaller labs and delay innovation at even the largest ones.\n\nIronically, while the tariffs are meant to curb China’s tech rise, they may be undercutting America’s own dominance. Big Tech’s strength has long rested on low trade barriers, cheap offshore production and frictionless global logistics. That model is now being dismantled in real time. Investors are no longer just reacting to earnings; they’re questioning the future of an entire industry’s structure.\n\n The deeper damage may hit Pakistan’s fledgling AI and tech development ecosystem.\n\nAt a time when the US is racing against China for dominance in AI, the tariffs may be inflicting damage on America’s own momentum. AI development is built on GPUs, servers and high-performance computing systems, many of which are assembled or sourced from Asia. While some advanced semiconductors have been given temporary exemptions, the broader ecosystem has not. Tariffs on GPUs alone are expected to spike development costs by as much as 35pc, which could cripple smaller AI startups and dramatically slow progress at larger labs.\n\nThe irony here is painful: in trying to weaken China’s tech rise, the US may end up kneecapping its own, and the market knows it. The $2 trillion erased was most likely a warning shot. Investors are not just worried about short-term earnings; they are rethinking the long-term profitability of Big Tech’s legacy business models. \n\nThe consequences are not contained within the US or China. In developing countries like Pakistan, which import nearly all their consumer tech and depend on global platforms to build digital capacity, the knock-on effects will be swift and severe. When Apple raises prices, when GPUs and cloud infrastructure become harder to source, the tremors reach straight into Pakistani homes, startups, classrooms, and servers.\n\nAlready saddled with local import duties and regulatory bottlenecks, Pakistani consumers face even steeper prices for smartphones, laptops and digital tools. But the deeper damage may hit the country’s fledgling AI and tech development ecosystem. Many local developers and researchers depend on access to global platforms, open-source models and affordable compute. As costs soar, those doors begin to close.\n\nThis creates a dangerous paradox: just as Pakistan attempts to digitise its economy, integrate AI into sectors like healthcare and education and foster homegrown innovation, the tools to do so become more expensive and less accessible. What follows is not just a tech slowdown, but the risk of falling into deeper digital dependency, reliant on imported AI services and locked out of the development loop.\n\nPakistan, of course, is not a player in the tech trade war. But it is caught in its crossfire. Tariff-driven supply chain shock may feel distant to some, but its results will show up in Pakistan’s stalled cloud deployments, paused AI experiments and shrinking startup runway. And as global companies restructure operations, smaller markets risk being deprioritised entirely.\n\nYet amidst the disruption, there is a sliver of opportunity. As tech giants look to de-risk from China and diversify their operations, Pakistan could insert itself not by mimicking China’s production scale, but by offering value in other ways. With a young, tech-savvy population and competitive labour costs, Pakistan can position itself as a digital services and backend talent hub for overstretched AI labs and global startups. But this won’t happen by default.\n\nTo seize this rather narrow window of opportunity, Pakistan needs to invest urgently and seriously in its human capital. That means prioritising technical education, scaling AI training programmes and subsidising access to computing infrastructure for universities, startups and freelancers alike. Without these fundamentals, the country risks becoming a spectator to a race it should be trying to run in. \n\nOf course, all of this would require actual digital policymaking; something far more ambitious and conducive than criminalising misinformation through the Prevention of Electronic Crimes Act and suspending X. If we want to be a part of the global tech shift, we will have to do away with predatory laws and vague digital agendas. We need policies that enable infrastructure, promote learning and encourage innovation. As opposed to treating the internet as a threat to be contained, we need to look at it as a platform to be built upon.\n\nDisruption is destabilising, but it also clears the way for new alignments. If the global tech order is being reshuffled, countries like Pakistan may have a chance to find new footing. The window may be narrow, but the cost of inaction is far wider. \n\nThe writer is the founder of Media Matters for Democracy.\n\nPublished in Dawn, April 19th, 2025","summary":"ON the morning of April 5, 2025, traders at the New York Stock Exchange were glued to their screens as Apple’s stock nosedived nearly five per cent in an hour.

But it hasn't,\" the website said.\n\nThe lab-leak theory, once dismissed as a conspiracy theory, has recently gained mainstream traction in the United States.\n\nEven as the debate remains unresolved -- scientifically and politically -- US agencies such as the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Department of Energy have come out in support of the theory, albeit with varying levels of confidence.\n\nEarlier this year, the Central Intelligence Agency shifted its official stance on the virus's origin, saying that it was \"more likely\" leaked from a Chinese lab than transmission from animals.\n\nThe assessment drew criticism from China, which said it was \"extremely unlikely\" Covid-19 came from a laboratory.\n\nBeijing also urged the United States to \"stop politicizing and instrumentalizing the issue of origin-tracing.\"\n\nThe United States and China are currently locked in a major trade war, with Washington announcing Thursday new port fees for Chinese-linked ships and increased tariffs for Chinese goods.\n\n- 'Terrible shame' -\n\n\"I welcome all efforts to dig deeper,\" said Jamie Metzl, a senior fellow at the Atlantic Council in response to the revamped White House website.\n\n\"But it would be a terrible shame if such efforts distracted from essential work to help prevent further infections and treat people suffering from Covid-19 and long Covid,\" he told NPR.\n\nThe new site, which apparently seeks to redefine the political narrative about Covid-19, also criticized the mask and social distancing mandates introduced at the start of the pandemic in 2020. There is also a map of Wuhan that is animated to throb.\n\nUnder a section titled \"Covid-19 misinformation,\" it also accused public health officials under the previous administration of demonizing \"alternative treatments\" and colluding with social media companies to censor dissenting views about the pandemic -- a charge frequently echoed by US conservatives.\n\nThe Biden administration has previously rejected the charge that it was suppressing or censoring conservative perspectives.\n\nThe website revamp comes after layoffs began earlier this month at major US health agencies, as the Trump administration embarks on a sweeping and scientifically contested restructuring that will cut 10,000 jobs.\n\nHealth secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr -- who has alarmed health experts with his rhetoric downplaying the importance of vaccines -- said the layoffs were part of a major reform of his department, aiming to refocus efforts on chronic disease prevention.\n\nMore than one million people died of Covid-19 and related illnesses in the United States, and millions more fell victim to the disease around the world.","url":"https://uk.news.yahoo.com/white-house-blames-china-covid-194923086.html","image":"https://media.zenfs.com/en/afp.co.uk/4e05f29dd196b526763f91cf1fbc35dd","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-19 00:35:11","author":"Anuj Chopra","authors":["Anuj Chopra"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.101},{"id":312596088,"title":"ANDREW NEIL: Farage beware! No politician aspiring to win power should want to align themselves with Trump's dumpster fire","text":"Three months of chaos and confusion emanating from the Oval Office have not been good for Donald Trump's popularity.\n\nHe entered the White House on January 20 with an average approval rating of +6 per cent. That has since slumped into negative territory, with his average approval rating now -4 per cent – a 10-point shift against him.\n\nThe most recent polls suggest it's getting worse. This week, YouGov had his approval rating down 14 points since Inauguration Day, with even 20 per cent of his own voters disapproving of how he's handling the economy.\n\nTrump, of course, can persevere with unpopular policies if he is so minded because he will never have to face the voters again (despite his mad musings about running for an unconstitutional third term). But he is doing no favours to those in other countries who donned the Trump mantle in the hope it would sweep them to power too.\n\nNigel Farage and his Reform Party should take urgent note.\n\nOne of the unforeseen aspects of Trump's presidency is that he has proved a boon to struggling Left-wing governments in foreign countries. On the eve of Trump's return to power, Canada's Liberal government was more than 20 points behind the Conservative opposition and heading for a thumping defeat – so much so that Justin Trudeau, Prime Minister and poster child for all that is woke, resigned.\n\nThen along came Trump, penalising Canadian exports with high tariffs for no good reason, demeaning Canada by proposing, absurdly, that it becomes the 51st American state, disrespecting its leader by referring to its PM as a 'governor' and claiming, wrongly, that the US subsidised Canada to the tune of $200billion a year. \n\nThe Canadian Conservative lead in the polls soon vanished like snow in the summer. The latest JL Partners poll for the Daily Mail shows Liberals and Conservatives nip and tuck, with the Liberals favourites to hold on to power because they're nine points ahead in the parliamentary seat-rich province of Ontario.\n\nPierre Poilievre, the Right-wing Conservative leader who, until a few months ago, was mentally measuring up the curtains for the PM's official residence in Ottawa, now faces an uphill struggle come the general election on April 28.\n\nMark Carney, of Bank of England fame – but virtually unknown in Canada, where only 5 per cent had heard of him before he replaced Trudeau as PM – has presided over a surge in Liberal support from its record low only two months ago.\n\nAlmost six out of ten Canadians still think their country is going in the wrong direction. They like many of Poilievre's policies. But his slogan 'Canada First' is too much an echo of Trump for voters whose top demand is a PM who will 'stand up to Trump'.\n\nPoilievre is now smeared as 'Maple Syrup MAGA'. What should have been a watershed 'change' election for Canada, marking a distinct move to the Right, looks like returning a tired Liberal government under new leadership.\n\nSuch has been the Trump effect.\n\nAssociation with Trump has been almost as toxic in Australia, which goes to the polls on May 3. Only a month ago, the Conservative opposition led by Peter Dutton was tied, with an unpopular Labour government led by Prime Minister Anthony Albanese.\n\nThen, unwittingly, Trump worked his electoral 'magic' Down Under too.\n\nWhen Trump was re-elected last November, only 40 per cent of Australians thought he would be bad for Australia. That's now risen to 68 per cent, not good news for Dutton, perceived to be aligned with Trump even if, in reality, he's a dull cove. The two men have little in common.\n\nBut Dutton's 'Make Australia Great Again' slogan allowed critics to claim his campaign was just a cut-and-paste of Trump's MAGA movement.\n\nHis net approval rating has slumped to -18 per cent and, with trust in America among Australians at a 20-year low, Albanese has staged a recovery: his Labour Party is now seven points ahead of Dutton's Conservatives.\n\nOnce again, the baleful 'Trump effect' could thwart what should have been a Rightward 'change' election.\n\nThere is no end of a lesson in all this for Farage. His Reform Party is riding high, poised to make significant gains in local elections in May, when it is contesting nearly all seats, and favourite to win the by-election on the same day at Runcorn and Helsby.\n\nSince this is Labour's 16th safest seat, which it won last July with a majority of almost 15,000, that would indeed be a famous Reform victory.\n\nIt would confirm Reform as the indisputable insurgent of British politics, with the power to make the political weather.\n\nIt would consolidate Reform's credentials as the main threat to Labour, whose northern Red Wall seats are under siege from Reform, and provoke a crisis in the Tory Party, relegated to third place in most polls and with a leader in Kemi Badenoch whose fine qualities have not helped her cut through to the wider public.\n\nSo the prize for Reform is huge – and it's not clear Trump is any help in winning it. As in Australia, almost 70 per cent of British voters think the President is bad for Britain and Farage is far closer to Trump than Poilievre or Dutton.\n\nThere are signs that Farage has already clocked that Trump could be something of a liability.\n\nThe Reform leader has wisely not endorsed Trump's tariffs and seems to have cut back on trips to America. His messaging in the current elections – 'Britain is broken' and 'fix the council, fix the country' – is more geared to current British sensibilities than any MAGA pitch.\n\nFarage needs to keep it that way, for there is almost certainly worse to come on the Trump front. His tariff tsunami is already slowing the US economy and has raised the chances of recession in America, which would drag us all down. Indeed, a recession could be catastrophic for both the US and the global economy.\n\nAll the sound and fury about tariffs has obscured something much more important: America is sitting on a fiscal knife-edge.\n\nDespite several years of strong growth, it is still running a federal budget deficit of 6 to 7 per cent – and is forecast to do so as far as the eye can see.\n\nTrump is set to make it worse with massive unfunded tax cuts (shades of Liz Truss). The bond markets, where governments go to borrow, are already jittery about Trump's chaotic management of tariffs, a budget deficit which defies cutting and a ballooning national debt (over 120 per cent of Gross Domestic Product and rising).\n\nThe dollar is sliding fast (down nine per cent since mid-January) and lenders are demanding a higher return to take on US debt.\n\nYet investors are still dumping US assets. They believe Trump is making them too risky. Even as he promises trade deals, a lot of tariffs will stay in place, pushing up prices in America and making it harder for the US Federal Reserve to cut interest rates.\n\nTrump's uncouth attacks on Fed Chairman Jerome Powell for not cutting rates (after his own tariff policy made it harder for him to do so!) only serve to make markets even more skittish about America.\n\nTrump has indicated he'd like to fire Powell even though he doesn't have the power to do so. Any attempt would have to be resolved by the Supreme Court, which takes time. Meanwhile, an unprecedented crisis of confidence in the US financial system would be unfolding.\n\nIf the US does slip into recession, it would add massively to America's fiscal incontinence. Tax revenues would plummet and spending on unemployment benefits and other welfare would rise – adding fuel to a budget deficit and national debt already simmering dangerously.\n\nNo foreign politician aspiring to lead their own country would want to be associated with the man responsible for such a dumpster fire.\n\nIf Farage is in any doubt he need only look at events in Canada and Australia for the route not to take.","summary":"He entered the White House on January 20 with an average approval rating of +6 per cent.

The controversy intensified after screenshots circulated online showing Abrego Garcia’s wife, Jennifer Vasquez Sura, reportedly using heart emojis to conceal the tattoos in a TikTok post linked to her emotional appeal—and a GoFundMe campaign that has already raised over $238,000.\nHmm… I wonder why Kilmar Abrego Garcia’s wife is hiding his knuckle tattoos with emojis now? 🤔 pic.twitter.com/EuqewILt4m\n— Robby Starbuck (@robbystarbuck) April 18, 2025\nThe video, captioned “No matter how many hours, days, weeks pass, I miss you like day ONE! 💔 #KILMAR,” has garnered over 21,000 likes and stirred intense debate online. One user questioned the symbolism behind the tattoo concealment, while another suggested it hinted at deeper issues, writing, “I wonder if she’s been threatened and that is why she isn’t being honest about all the harm her husband has done to her.”\nThe issue quickly escalated to the national political stage when President Donald Trump weighed in on his social media platform Truth Social, citing the tattoos as evidence of Abrego Garcia’s alleged ties to MS-13, a notorious criminal gang. “This is the hand of the man Democrats want back in the U.S.,” Trump wrote. “He’s got MS-13 tattooed on his knuckles, and two courts have found he was a member of the gang. I was elected to take bad people out of the United States.”\nThis is the hand of the man that the Democrats feel should be brought back to the United States, because he is such “a fine and innocent person.” They said he is not a member of MS-13, even though he’s got MS-13 tattooed onto his knuckles, and two Highly Respected Courts found… pic.twitter.com/4bcCJ1q3p3\n— Donald J. Trump Posts From His Truth Social (@TrumpDailyPosts) April 18, 2025\nTrump also referenced past legal findings, claiming that Abrego Garcia had a history of domestic violence and gang affiliation. His post revived the polarizing debate on immigration enforcement, particularly regarding the deportation of individuals with contested legal histories.\nIn contrast, Senator Chris Van Hollen defended his visit to El Salvador, where he met Abrego Garcia in person. Speaking to the press on Friday, Van Hollen said, “This is about upholding constitutional protections for all individuals, regardless of immigration status. Kilmar Abrego Garcia experienced trauma while in detention, and there are legitimate concerns about the legal process that led to his deportation.”\nMust Read: Elon Musk And Giorgia Meloni Reunite In Washington, Spark Social Media Frenzy","summary":"The image, which shows distinct lettering across Abrego Garcia’s knuckles, triggered a wave of social media speculation, with some users alleging gang affiliations.","url":"https://www.newsx.com/north-america/tattoos-tiktoks-and-controversy-the-deportation-case-of-kilmar-abrego-garcia-sparks-political-firestorm/","image":"https://www.newsx.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/TRUMP-5.webp","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-19 00:28:10","author":"Swastika Sruti","authors":["Swastika Sruti"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"in","sentiment":-0.004},{"id":312593356,"title":"Opposition Leader Peter Dutton’s ‘dud’ campaign week","text":"After every federal election, there’s a campaign week that is looked back on as the decider.\n\nA week where the puzzle pieces start to come together and one camp is forced to ask “do we need to change tack?”\n\nFor Peter Dutton, week three needed to be a winner. Instead, it was an absolute dud.\n\nA “mistake” on Russian planes in Indonesia. A delayed admission on housing deposits for his kids. A muddled “aspiration” on tax reforms.\n\nInside the trail, there’s a feeling the Coalition’s petrol-drenched campaign is quickly circling the drain at the bowser.\n\nIn the second leaders' debate between Anthony Albanese and Peter Dutton, Donald Trump and tariffs became a hot topic of discussion.\n\nBut with less than two weeks before polling day, does the party really have enough time to turn things around?\n\nDutton’s ‘pollie-speak’ betrays him\n\nMr Dutton’s week started out strong – with a solid campaign launch at the Liverpool Catholic Church on Sunday.\n\nWe got a much-needed glimpse into the Opposition Leader’s softer side in a video about his family, where he admitted to inheriting his father’s “emotional gene”.\n\n“I think I’ve worked pretty hard at the years to hide it. It doesn’t really get rewarded in our business, so better off not to show the vulnerabilities,” the former Queensland police officer stated.\n\nNewspoll then dropped on Sunday night, showing Mr Dutton was falling further out of favour with Australians. It was time to desperately switch gears.\n\nThe Opposition leader tried to keep the family sentiment going, bringing his son Harry out onto the campaign for the start of the week.\n\nUnfortunately, 24 years in politics proved hard to shake.\n\nInstead of bringing the kids out to support the campaign, Mr Dutton was too eager to use them for the campaign.\n\n“I am saving up for a house and so is my sister, Beck, and a lot of my mates, but as you probably heard, it’s almost impossible to get in – in the current state,” Harry said, in a bid to spruik his dad’s housing policies.\n\n“So I mean we’re saving like mad, but it doesn’t look like we’ll get there in the near future. But we’d love that to change.”\n\nIt doubled down on Mr Dutton voicing his concern about his 23-year-old daughter Rebecca at Sunday’s Liberal launch – where he said she was: “Madly saving as a childcare worker on a pretty low income”.\n\nFor the next 24 hours, Mr Dutton dodged questions about why he wasn’t helping out his kids with a housing deposit before finally admitting he would. The question overshadowed two whole days of campaigning at a pivotal point.\n\nThen came the Indonesia-Russia fiasco.\n\nAgain, Mr Dutton’s extended run in politics burnt him.\n\nReports came out that Russia had asked to store “long-range” aircraft in Papua, sending Canberra into a spin.\n\nMr Dutton was too hungry for the opportunity to bash the PM and Penny Wong, incorrectly attributing confirmations from the Indonesia President.\n\nThe next day, Mr Dutton was in full “pollie-speak” mode, denying he was wrong and fobbing off questions about the misstep.\n\nFinally on Wednesday night during the second leader’s debate, he admitted it was a “mistake”.\n\nThe thing is, Australians are a somewhat forgiving bunch. Make a mistake, quickly own up to it and you might get away with it.\n\nBut a mistake, followed up by two days of denial, suddenly starts feeling a lot like a lie to voters.\n\nMr Dutton ended the campaign week on Thursday declaring he had an “aspiration” – not a policy – to end tax bracket creep, which certainly seems like a last-ditch effort to claw some voters.\n\nI think most would agree its come all a bit too late, leaving voters to ponder over the Easter weekend whether Mr Dutton is truly ready to be PM.\n\nDutton’s canned campaign\n\nMaybe it’s just the fact that the Opposition Leader had been doing this for too long.\n\nEach day on week 3 of the campaign trail has been largely the same. A visit to some kind of construction or housing site to spruik the party line, a visit to a petrol site and an afternoon pic opp of packing boxes of some kind alongside well-vetted voters.\n\nA press conference per day, where journalists are allowed one question per day. No follows are up allowed, with Mr Dutton dodging questions left, right and centre.\n\nIt makes for a very dry, scripted campaign with little authenticity.\n\nIn the age of TikTok, new-age podcasts and milennials taking over the boomer population, an old-fashioned campaign does not seem to be cutting through.\n\nFinal weeks critical for Dutton\n\nThere are now just 13 days left before Aussies hit the polls, leaving little time for a campaign surge.\n\nAll the Coalition can hope for now is for some major gaffes from the PM for Mr Dutton’s experience to shine – rather than hinder his play for PM.\n\nMr Dutton now needs to give the point scoring a rest, and fall back on what Aussie voters are desperate for right now – clarity, authenticity and a plan forward.","summary":"Opposition Leader Peter Dutton needed this week to be his best of the campaign.

Later in the day, the ACLU filed emergency petitions with both the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals and the US Supreme Court itself to halt the deportations, even as one of the judges said it raised legitimate concerns but he could not issue an order.

The group has already sued to block deportations under the Alien Enemies Act of 1798 of two Venezuelans held in the Bluebonnet Detention Center and is asking a judge to issue an order barring removals of any immigrants in the region under the law. In an emergency filing early Friday, the ACLU warned that immigration authorities were accusing other Venezuelan men held there of being members of the Tren de Aragua gang, which would make them subject to President Donald Trump's use of the act.

The act has only been invoked three previous times in US history, most recently during World War II to hold Japanese-American civilians in internment camps. The Trump administration contended it gave them power to swiftly remove immigrants they identified as members of the gang, regardless of their immigration status. The ACLU and the group Democracy Forward immediately sued to halt deportations under the act. The US Supreme Court allowed deportations to resume, but ruled unanimously they could proceed only if those about to be removed had a chance to argue their case in court and were given “a reasonable time” to contest their pending removals. Federal judges in Colorado, New York and southern Texas promptly issued orders barring removal of detainees under the AEA until the administration provides a process for them to make claims in court. But there's been no such order issued in the area of Texas that covers Bluebonnet, which is located 24 miles north of Abilene in the far northern end of the state. District Judge James Wesley Hendrix, a Trump appointee, this week declined to bar the administration from removing the two men identified in the ACLU lawsuit because Immigration and Customs Enforcement filed sworn declarations that they would not be immediately deported. He also balked at issuing a broader order prohibiting removal of all Venezuelans in the area under the act because he said removals hadn't started yet. But the ACLU's Friday filing includes sworn declarations from three separate immigration lawyers who said their clients in Bluebonnet were given paperwork indicating they were members of Tren de Aragua and could be deported by Saturday. In one case, immigration lawyer Karene Brown said her client, identified by initials, was told to sign papers in English even though the client only spoke Spanish. “ICE informed F.G.M. that these papers were coming from the President, and that he will be deported even if he did not sign it,” Brown wrote. ACLU attorney Lee Gelernt said in a Friday evening hearing before District Judge James E Boasberg in Washington, DC, that the administration initially moved Venezuelans to its south Texas immigration facility for deportation. But, since a judge banned deportations in that area, it has funnelled them to the Bluebonnet facility, where no such order exists. He said witnesses reported the men were being loaded on buses Friday evening to be taken to the airport. With Hendrix not agreeing to the ACLU's request for an emergency order, the group turned to Boasberg, who initially halted deportations in March. The Supreme Court ruled the orders against deportation could only come from judges in jurisdictions where immigrants were held, which Boasberg said made him powerless Friday. “I'm sympathetic to everything you're saying,” Boasberg told Gelernt. “I just don't think I have the power to do anything about it.” Boasberg this week found there's probable cause that the Trump administration committed criminal contempt by disobeying his initial deportation ban. He was concerned that the paper that ICE was giving those held did not make clear they had a right to challenge their removal in court, which he believed the Supreme Court mandated. Drew Ensign, an attorney for the Justice Department, disagreed, saying that people slated for deportation would have a “minimum” of 24 hours to challenge their removal in court. He said no flights were scheduled for Friday night and he was unaware of any Saturday but the Department of Homeland Security said it reserved the right to remove people then. ICE said it would not comment on the litigation. Also Friday, a Massachusetts judge made permanent his temporary ban on the administration deporting immigrants who have exhausted their appeals to countries other than their home countries unless they are informed of their destination and given a chance to object if they'd face torture or death there. Some countries, like Venezuela, do not accept deportations from the United States, which has led the Trump administration to strike agreements with other countries like Panama to house them.

Laurel Libby Friday in her lawsuit to have her censure in the state legislature overturned. Libby was censured Feb. 15 for a social media post that identified a transgender athlete who won a girls state pole vault title. The judge who made the ruling is Rhode Island U.S. District Court Judge Melissa DuBose, who was appointed by former President Joe Biden just before he left office in January. DuBose denied Libby's motion for a preliminary injunction Friday, ruling the process House Speaker Ryan Fecteau used to impose the sanction reflected the will of the majority of Maine House members. CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM DuBose presided over the case after every district judge in Maine refused to take it. Judges John C. Nivison, John A. Woodcock, Lance E. Walker, Karen F. Wolf, Stacey D. Neumann and Nancy Torresen signed recusal orders shortly after the case was initially filed. No reason was given. So, the case went to DuBose in Rhode Island. MAINE GIRL INVOLVED IN TRANS ATHLETE BATTLE REVEALS HOW STATE'S POLICIES HURT HER CHILDHOOD AND SPORTS CAREER Libby is \"disappointed\" by the ruling but plans to appeal it and will take the case to the court of appeals and, potentially, the U.S. Supreme Court. \"I certainly won't leave any stone unturned in getting my constituents their voice and vote back,\" Libby told Fox News Digital. Libby represents 9,000 constituents in Maine's 90th district and has not been able to speak or vote on their behalf in the state legislature for 62 days. That cost her a chance to vote on the state's biannual budget and propose a bill to expand access to mental health resources for residents. With her censure remaining in place, it will prevent Libby from voting on or speaking on the House floor about a bill that would add trans inclusion in girls sports to the state constitution. Her colleagues will be voting on the Democratic majority's bill after it passed with a slim simple majority in the House Thursday but will need a two-thirds majority in both chambers before it can go before voters. If passed, it would codify in the state's constitution the Maine Human Rights Act (MHRA), which protects the rights of transgender athletes to compete for sports teams of the opposite sex. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP \"I will not be able to vote on that,\" Libby said. Libby's social media post that prompted the censure thrust the entire state into an active legal battle with President Donald Trump's administration over the issue of trans athletes in girls sports. The U.S. Department of Justice filed a lawsuit against the state for its ongoing defiance of Trump's \"Keeping Men Out of Women's Sports\" executive order. Maine has faced federal pressure in the last two months over its refusal to comply, including two federal investigations, a funding freeze by the U.S. Department of Agriculture and now a lawsuit. The Democratic leadership in the state, led by Gov. Janet Mills, has fought back, filing their own lawsuit against Trump over the funding freeze. Another federal judge has already ruled the USDA must unfreeze the funding. \"I’m happy to go to court and litigate the issues that are being raised in this court complaint,\" Mills told reporters Thursday. A survey by the American Parents Coalition found that out of about 600 registered Maine voters, 63% said school sports participation should be based on biological sex, and 66% agreed it is \"only fair to restrict women’s sports to biological women.\" The poll also found that 60% of residents would support a ballot measure limiting participation in women’s and girls sports to biological females. This included 64% of independents and 66% of parents with kids under age 18.

I had with me some of the biggest UK financial services firms, so HSBC, the London Stock Exchange Group, Standard Chartered, Prudential.\n\n'Those sorts of arrangements are clearly in the UK national interest and that's how I will approach trade talks or financial dialogues with any country in the world.' \n\nSince Labour took office, Ms Reeves alongside Ed Miliband, David Lammy and Douglas Alexander have all visited China.\n\nSir Keir became the first Prime Minister in years to hold a phone call with Chinese premier Xi Jinping shortly after he took office and it is understood a visit by the Labour leader could be on the cards in the future.\n\nA meeting between the two countries in January in Beijing, where it was agreed that Ms Reeves will host He Lifeng, the Chinese vice-premier, in London.\n\nAttempts by Shein to float on the UK stock market have led to controversy, amid allegations the use of forced labour in its supply chain, which the company denies.\n\nThe Chancellor said it is for the Financial Conduct Authority to decide, but added that she did want to welcome new listings onto the London Stock Exchange\n\nAsked whether she would back a float if signed off by regulators, Ms Reeves added: 'We have lost business and we have lost companies in recent years and we're working closely with the London Stock Exchange to make the UK a more vibrant place to list.'\n\nMs Reeves also said she would happily ride in a Chinese-made electric car, despite concerns about the risk of spying from Beijing.\n\nShe pointed out that London taxis are currently produced in Britain by a Chinese company. \n\nMs Reeves did clarify however that Chinese investment would be blocked from areas of critical national infrastructure.\n\nEarlier this week the Chinese embassy criticised MPs for their 'arrogance and twisted mindset' over the move.\n\nAnother potential problem is plans by China for a new 'super embassy' near the Tower of London. President XI has lobbied for planning approval, however concerns about national security have but the project in doubt. \n\nNext week, the Chancellor will be in Washington to meet G20 finance ministers and will have a face-to-face meeting with US trade secretary Scott Bessent. \n\nMs Reeves said she was still pushing the US to remove the 10 per cent blanket tariff on UK goods imports in the deal, despite speculation to the contrary.","summary":"It would be 'very foolish' for Britain to disengage with China, Rachel Reeves has said as she attempts to draw a line in the sand with the US over their treatment of Beijing.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-14627033/Rachel-Reeves-calls-Britain-forge-closer-ties-Beijing.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/04/19/01/97449209-0-image-m-113_1745021413353.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-19 00:14:22","author":"Editor,Tom Lawrence","authors":["Editor","Tom Lawrence"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.126},{"id":312596186,"title":"Ford halts shipments of vehicles to China amid Trump tariffs","text":"Ford Motor said on Friday (Apr 18) it has halted shipments of its SUVs, pick-up trucks and sports cars to China, as it starts to face the heat from retaliatory tariffs that have seen vehicles face taxes as high as 150 per cent.\n\n\"We have adjusted exports from the US to China in light of the current tariffs,\" Ford said in a statement.\n\nThe car maker earlier this week halted shipments of its F-150 Raptors, Mustangs and Michigan-built Bronco SUVs as well as Kentucky-made Lincoln Navigators to China.\n\nIt operates a number of manufacturing joint ventures in China with Chinese companies, producing vehicles under both the Ford and Lincoln brands.\n\nThe development comes as US car makers scramble to find ways to tackle President Donald Trump's on-again, off-again tariffs, which are expected to dent profits of carmakers and parts suppliers likewise.\n\nThe Wall Street Journal was first to report on the halt, citing people familiar with the matter.\n\nFord's exports of US-built engines and transmissions to China are expected to continue despite the pause on exports of assembled vehicles.\n\nIts Lincoln Nautilus model, which is manufactured in China, is also expected to have continued shipments, despite heavy tariffs.\n\nFord is among the best-placed automakers to weather tariffs, as it produces about 80 per cent of its US-sold vehicles domestically.\n\nStill, the automaker is expected to raise prices of its new vehicles if tariffs continue, according to an internal memo sent to dealers that was seen by Reuters.\n\nAn analysis by the Center for Automotive Research published earlier this month said that Trump's 25 per cent tariffs on automotive imports will escalate costs for automakers by about US$108 billion in 2025.\n\nOverall, Ford sold 442,000 vehicles - made in the US and elsewhere - in China in 2024, comprising 1.6 per cent of the market, according to the car maker's latest annual report.\n\nFord's Chinese ventures resulted in 2024 operating profits of around US$900 million, vice chairman John Lawler said this week at a financial conference.\n\nTrump earlier this week floated the idea that he was considering a modification to the auto-related tariffs, indicating he might allow exemptions on existing levies.","summary":"","url":"https://www.channelnewsasia.com/business/ford-halts-shipments-vehicles-china-amid-trump-tariffs-5074836","image":"https://dam.mediacorp.sg/image/upload/s--TnQ8MFfw--/fl_relative,g_south_east,l_mediacorp:cna:watermark:2024-04:reuters_1,w_0.1/f_auto,q_auto/c_fill,g_auto,h_338,w_600/v1/one-cms/core/2025-04-16t141716z_1_lynxmpel3f0oj_rtroptp_3_ford-recall.jpg?itok=thjhof","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-19 00:14:00","author":null,"language":"en","source_country":"sg","sentiment":-0.199},{"id":312593246,"title":"World News | Pakistan Sets April 30 Deadline for Undocumented Afghans to Leave","text":"Islamabad [Pakistan], April 19 (ANI): The Pakistan government has set April 30 as the deadline for all foreign nationals residing in the country without valid visas to leave, with the move particularly targeting undocumented Afghan nationals, The Express Tribune reported.

On one side, younger, more defiant members are pushing for generational change and a harder line. On the other? Moderates and institutionalists who seem pretty comfortable clinging to the status quo.\n\nThe split has been on full display in the party’s response to the wrongful deportation of Maryland father Kilmar Abrego Garcia, who was sent to a notoriously brutal prison in El Salvador without due process.\n\nDemocrats like Maryland Sen. Chris Van Hollen have been on the front lines, demanding accountability and treating the case like the crisis it is. Others, such as California Gov. Gavin Newsom, are dismissing the party’s focus on Garcia as a “distraction,” urging Democrats to hit Trump on tariffs and trade instead.\n\n“This is the distraction of the day. The art of distraction,” Newsom said. “And here, we zig and zag. This is the debate they want. This is their 80-20 issue, as they’ve described it.”\n\nNewsom’s right that opinion polls show Trump slightly more vulnerable on the economy than on immigration. A new Civiqs poll for Daily Kos found that 54% of registered voters disapprove of how Trump is handling the economy, while 51% disapprove of his immigration record. So yes, there’s a small strategic window on economic issues.\n\nBut writing off a human rights violation as a mere “distraction” isn’t just morally bankrupt—it’s politically stupid. \n\nNewsom is probably betting that the general electorate has shifted so far right on immigration that nobody cares that a father of two was wrongly deported from Maryland to a vicious Salvadoran prison. But that’s just not true. \n\nCiviqs found that 63% of registered voters oppose deporting immigrants who are in the U.S. legally, while just 27% support it. And if you want to look at things from a craven electability angle, the numbers among independent voters are almost the same: 28% support, 62% oppose.\n\nThe strategic divide among Democrats is happening at the same time the party is being rocked by a generational power struggle: a calcified leadership reluctant to change versus a new wave of leaders ready to torch the playbook.\n\nThis tension, simmering for years, is now boiling over. Some in leadership are trying to muzzle outspoken members, advising them to cool down their rhetoric and stop making the party look too combative. In other words: Don’t rock the boat, don’t poke the bear, and definitely don’t do anything that might upset the delicate optics.\n\nBut that caution-first mindset doesn’t match the moment—or the mood of the electorate. Voters aren’t asking for calm. They’re asking for courage.\n\nDemocratic National Committee Vice Chair David Hogg seems to have gotten the memo. He recently made waves by announcing a $20 million campaign to primary older Democratic incumbents in deep-blue districts, seeming to shake up Congress’s gerontocracy and inject new blood into the party’s leadership pipeline. \n\nUnsurprisingly, the old guard isn’t thrilled—but the base might be. \n\nA new poll from Change Research found that 90% of Democrats and Democratic-leaning voters preferred a moderate fighter over a quiet progressive, and a staggering 95% said they’d choose a progressive fighter over a quiet moderate. The numbers held steady across age, race, and ethnicity.\n\nThe message couldn’t be clearer. Democrats want spine. They want fight. And they’ll reward it. \n\nJust look at the crowds that New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders have drawn on their “Fighting Oligarchy” tour, or the money they’ve hauled in while doing it. The grassroots energy is there, but only if the party is willing to match it. \n\nToo many Democrats still believe they can win by being slightly less offensive than Republicans. But they won’t beat a fascist movement by politely disagreeing with it. They’ll have to fight—and show voters they’re not afraid to. \n\nIf the leadership won’t step up, the base will find people who will.","summary":"The Democratic Party faces a growing rift over how to take on President Donald Trump.

US tariff saga is a clear example of how political decisions can rattle the economy in an instant, according to Himanshu Rai, director, IIM Indore. Businesses, investors and even governments are on edge; they can't make long-term plans because everything seems so unpredictable. B-school students must be ready to handle uncertainty. They must learn and enhance the skills that enable them to plan for different possible scenarios and make quick, smart decisions even when things change unexpectedly, said Rai. The situation also shows that business leaders need to manage not just markets, but also relationships with governments and public opinion. Rai said that MBA students need to pay attention to how companies are responding.Drawing parallels to pandemic Some companies are lobbying the government, some are changing their suppliers and others are focusing more on automation or diversifying their businesses, he said. These different reactions are a great way to study how businesses handle tough times and plan for risks. The level of uncertainty is a throwback to the days of the Covid-19 pandemic, according to some. The learning process started during Covid when many assumptions we had made came apart. A few things are relevant to the present context as well, said Rishikesha T Krishnan, director, IIM-Bangalore.The first, he said, is scenario planning and the need to think through different eventualities as a regular process. The second is to be aware of the biases identified by psychologist Daniel Kahneman and others and to take precautions to avoid these from clouding one's judgement. The third is to read weak signals and manage risk better, said Krishnan. These are already part of our courses but need further underlining and strengthening. Case StudiesThe current scenario can provide fodder for multiple case studies and will be introduced in classroom discussions in courses such as macroeconomics, international business and geopolitics, according to B-schools. This could range from how companies adjust their supply chains when faced with sudden changes (operations management), trade theories on protectionism and the immediate impact of tariff shocks on global markets (global economics) and how businesses engage in cross-border negotiations (international business). Strategic management courses can use the tariff saga to teach students how companies recalibrate their competitive positioning when the rules of the game change overnight. Things are happening in such a disorganised manner and creating such uncertainty that it's showing signs of a brinkmanship episode gone wrong, said Rohit Prasad, professor of economics and public policy at MDI Gurgaon. Students should understand how to conduct themselves in such episodes because brinkmanship is a reality even in business. They should try to wait things out and look for opportunities within the chaos. The situation also lends itself to many case studies, he said, from how a particular company could pivot towards traceability solutions, how the government is dealing with the situation and how business and government are communicating.Shifting LandscapeSantanu Gupta, professor of economics, XLRI, Xavier School of Management, Jamshedpur, said academics are taking immense interest in the current economic and political scenario. We are asked questions every day, and the challenge is this: whatever is our advice to students today must be in sync with whatever we say tomorrow, when the situation may be diametrically opposite, he said.When the scenario is so unpredictable, the advice to students is to be calm and not take any decisions in haste, said Gupta. He said he is starting an economics course with students for the one-year programme, and this is one of the first things he would take up. We, in economics, prefer to bring up lessons from history, and stakeholders affected by the imposition of tariffs, he said. The current situation lends itself to case studies for classroom discussion in multiple courses, said Prafulla Agnihotri, director, IIM Sirmaur. In international business, for example, a case of a firm exporting its products to the US can be discussed, and students, as managers of that firm, can be asked to deal with the situation. In macroeconomics, the same scenario can be used to explain the concepts of tariffs as barriers to international trade, he said.","summary":"Amidst Trump's disruptive tariff policies causing global economic instability, Indian B-schools are leveraging the chaos as a valuable learning opportunity.

More will undoubtedly follow as the Trump administration’s immigration clampdown continues apace.\n\nIt is little wonder that travel to the US has begun to decline, given the aggressive targeting of alleged illegal immigration precipitated in the fledgling months of Trump’s second term.\n\nEven students heading on the traditional Irish J1 visa summer in the States have been warned by the Union of Students in Ireland that taking part in anything which could be construed as “activism” while living there is now fraught with peril. Suddenly travelling to America has become much more complicated.\n\nMany nations — Germany, the UK, and Canada being amongst the most prominent — have responded to the recent spate of stories from the American border with updated travel advice for their citizens, flagging for example the White House’s recent executive order asserting that it recognises “two sexes, male and female”, a statement that could pose issues for transgender or non-binary travellers.\n\nNotwithstanding the drop-off in Irish passenger numbers, the Department of Foreign Affairs has not as yet issued updated advice for travellers to the US, although a spokesperson noted that all such advice is “reviewed regularly and updated”. Asked specifically about travel to the US, they said: \n\n As in all cases of international travel, it’s important that Irish citizens are aware of the local context, and that local laws apply to you as a visitor and it is your responsibility to follow them.\n\n“It’s important to be aware that some activities that would not be problematic at home may be seen as improper, hostile, or even illegal in another country,” they added.\n\nThe US government’s international trade administration runs a monthly tally of overseas visitors to the US. In March 2025, just over a month into the second coming of Donald Trump, tourists visiting America from the top-20 countries by that metric fell by 10%.\n\nThe drop in US-bound travellers from European countries was particularly stark. The influx of German tourists fell by 28% year-on-year. Spain’s figures fell by 25%. Even the UK fell by 14.3%.\n\nIreland was no exception. In March, 38,852 people left these shores for the US, a drop of 27% from the same month in 2024. That’s roughly 15,000 people choosing to stay home from a relatively small country population-wise rather than visit the US.\n\nIt is also likely not a coincidence — in February the same metric showed visitors into America from Ireland down by 3.2%.\n\nLast December, the figure was up 5.1% year-on-year. Irish people have clearly decided to stay home, at least for the time being.\n\n“It’s a definite trend,” said Irish Travel Agents Association president Angela Walsh, adding that the drop off in travellers has been easily noticed.\n\n“It’s a confidence issue. Because the whole thing is relatively new and at present information is piecemeal I think that people, in the absence of facts, are creating their own narrative.\n\n“That narrative [of US inhospitability] is reflecting the lack of confidence, and it’s become self-perpetuating. And now people are thinking ‘I’m not going to go unless I have to’. The trend is attributable to a lack of facts.”\n\nShe doesn’t think that a lack of faith in the American visa system is necessarily driving the average Irish traveller’s new hesitancy.\n\n“I think people are just more nervous in general, more cautious,” she says, adding that people in her line of work are now “being asked questions they wouldn’t have been asked before”.\n\nMost of the travel scare-stories emanating from America since January have involved either working visas or green cards (which bequeath the right to live and work in America permanently), with a common denominator often tending to be a blip, typo, or an empty field in a visa application, or a historic minor misdemeanour — what hitherto might have been seen as a minor obstacle now blown up into a full-scale issue.\n\nDespite the negative press, in some ways little has changed in recent times — the US customs and immigration authorities have always been vested with robust powers, and inviting their suspicion would never have been a particularly wise choice — not 30 years ago, not today.\n\nHowever, that the Trump administration is leaning into those powers is undeniable.\n\nCan they affect those who are merely tourists and visitors? In short, yes they can, but that doesn’t mean that they are likely to. Or at least, not yet.\n\nAll foreign nationals entering the United States are required to do so on a visa or permission of some description, to be applied for in advance. The tourist variant is known as Esta (electronic system for travel authorisation), which typically remains valid for a period of two years from issue.\n\n“The people who use ESTA, they go through the same process as anyone else,” says Jim O’Malley, a New York-based, Limerick-born immigration lawyer.\n\n“What’s been happening is that Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) is enforcing ideological parameters and if they feel or deem that a person is somewhat ideologically not in line, or repulsive, then they have the authority now to stop them from travelling.\n\n“They always have had unfettered authority really, on the issue of entry to the United States. That historically was handled with civility and realism. Unfortunately, those norms seem to be evaporating quickly.”\n\nSo would, say, a random historic tweet, speaking mockingly or critically about Trump, be enough to see entry barred?\n\n“Yes, and we’re seeing that on the ground now. The issue of non-US citizens entering America is broadly seen as foreign policy here, and that is mostly under the control of the administration.\n\n“And this issue appears to be really important to this administration, although it doesn’t appear to achieve much in terms of furthering American interests or the wellbeing of its citizens,” Mr O’Malley said.\n\nHe underlines however that “we’re talking about extreme situations here”.\n\n“I don’t know how many hundreds of thousands of people go through every day. The vast majority will be admitted in and have a nice day. 99.9% will not have a problem, but the 0.1% who do, it becomes an anomaly, and it gets massive attention.\n\n What’s more concerning is people who are returning from a temporary departure who have put down roots in the US. The same thing can happen to them. These are pople who to all intents and purposes are American-based, who have homes and mortgages. That’s a bit shocking.\n\nOne common fear among travellers to the US amid the ideological trappings of its new government is the thought of their phone being confiscated at customs. Yes, it is a thing, and yes, the American customs and border patrol (CBP) very much have the power to do so, and to ask you to unlock it for them.\n\n“If you’re coming as a visitor on Esta, or as a visa holder, you have limited privacy rights as far as your electronic devices go,” said Irishwoman practicing immigration law in Chicago. Fiona McEntee. So a traveller can refuse access to their phone, but can also expect to be refused entry if they do.\n\nWhat are they looking for? In prior times, the thinking would have been to identify content indicating that the terms of a travel visa were being breached if someone was obviously working in the US. Things are a little different now.\n\n“WhatsApp and photographs are big things,” says McEntee. “Irish people love their memes, their jokes, but you have to factor in that CBP could see it, and there’s this idea of dissent against the administration.\n\n“They have all the discretion and all the power. This administration is flexing their muscles in terms of people who disagree with them, and it’s being ramped up,” she said.\n\n“Just be mindful what’s on your phone. People have had issues with WhatsApp in the past.”\n\nIdeology aside, it’s valid to wonder what consideration is being given to US tourism amid the current climate, with merchant banking group Goldman Sachs claiming this week that America could be set to lose $90bn — albeit in a worst case scenario — in lost tourism dollars in 2025 alone, as travellers choose to stay away.\n\n“It’s a head-scratcher,” said McEntee. \n\n\"There are a lot of things from tourism that are beneficial to the US, but that doesn’t seem to come into it. Also international students, who contribute billions and subsidise American tuition via their fees.\n\n“But this administration just wants to do what it wants to do. It is adamant about certain narratives being put forward and consequences don’t seem to matter.\n\n People are having adverse feelings about coming here now, and that just makes me sad. America is supposed to be multicultural.\n\n“On the other hand, there will always be people who will come, for business, for a holiday. They just need to take precautions and to be aware of the things that could cause them trouble.”\n\nTravellers to the US don’t want any bother, but the US administration doesn’t seem to care, said Mr O’Malley.\n\n“I can understand why people wouldn’t want the discomfort and uncertainty, regardless of right or wrong.\n\n“If someone wants to see the Grand Canyon, they don’t want to be troubled with the remote possibility that they would be rejected.\n\n“Has the administration factored that in? I don’t think they care too much about tourism from Europe, to be honest.”\n\nSo will that put people off going?\n\n“I think people who have been holding off will book eventually,” said Ms Walsh\n\n“It’s such a personal choice for everyone.\n\n“But the biggest thing driving the current nervousness is the instability.\n\n I can understand the reluctance — people are thinking ‘why should we go there when we can just go to Spain or Portugal?’.\n\n\"And if someone was feeling a doubt about their visa, I’d encourage them not to go.”\n\nShe then chooses her words carefully.\n\n“What I would say is, this doubt, the lack of stability, the negative narrative — it’s not creating a very attractive overall picture.\n\n“You put all those together and you’d want to have a very good reason to go.”\n\nIn terms of tourism inbound to Ireland however, Walsh thinks the current situation “could stand in our favour”.\n\n“It’s very stable here. The experiential trip to Europe is big on the American list. I don’t see that decreasing.”","summary":"Do Irish tourists still have an American dream?

I don't know how else I would meet people if I wasn't doing that.'\n\nThe DJ and TV star is thought to have enjoyed ' a string of dates with Adam Butler' before the businessman joined her in the tropical location while on a work trip\n'When I was younger, there was the option to go out, but now I live in the country, it's not like I'm able to just go to the pub,' she added. \n'Even if I went to my local, they're all my neighbours who I know anyway, so that's of no value to me.'\nDetailing how her only chance of meeting potential matches 'in real life' is online, she hinted that she has come across some celebrity suitors on exclusive dating app Raya.\n'I'm still on my Raya dating app, I've gone on quite a few dates with different people, I've seen so many celebrities [on Raya], but you aren't allowed to say who is on there,' she teased.\nThe former Big Breakfast host noted that while it's 'really fun' to use the app, she has awkwardly often found herself paired with one of her mates.\nShe said she hasn't really been active on Raya over the winter months, but with summer fast approaching, she plans to change that, quipping: 'Watch this space.'\nThe performer said being a single mother to her daughter Betsy, 14 - who she shares with ex-husband Lee Mead - makes it harder to meet new people as she can't go out at night.\nEven when she is out DJing, Denise said she is 'in and out' of the venue and 'doesn't hang around', lessening her chance of sparking up a romance with anyone there.\nShe is seemingly keen to get back into the dating pool again after revealing she wasn't 'fussed' about being in a relationship last year.\n\nThe presenter has been single since splitting from Jimmy Barba (pictured) in October 2023 and joined exclusive dating app Raya last year in the hopes of finding love again \n\n Denise Van Outen, 50, says she's reliant on dating apps to meet men \nWhile she has been on a few dates, she said she wasn't putting pressure on herself to find a new partner because she's very content with her own company these days.\nReferencing the end of her engagement to Eddie Boxshall, who she split from in January 2022 after discovering he had been unfaithful, she told Fabulous magazine: 'I'm not fussed either way now.\n'I'm really good friends with Tamzin Outhwaite and we were saying: ''Isn't it nice to actually just be loving life and not feel pressured to have to be in a relationship or be with someone?'' I've learned to be on my own and be content.\n'This industry can feel pressurised, and then when things go wrong, it's so public. You worry that people see you as a failure.\n'I wonder if people say: ''Why can't she hold down a relationship? History keeps repeating itself'', but I'm not chasing it now.'\nShe added that her relationship with Eddie only got cut short because of what she discovered he had done, admitting that was the 'sad part' of the break-up.\nDenise said she was 'back to square one' but was trying to keep a 'positive outlook' and 'have an open heart'.\nAfter her devastating split from Eddie, Denise found love again with Jimmy Barba in July 2022, but they split after 18 months together.\n\nShe ended her engagement to Eddie Boxshall (seen together) in January 2022 after discovering he had been unfaithful\nDenise went public with property developer Jimmy, 55, that summer after her split from her love rat ex Eddie, who she was with for seven years.\nShe ended her relationship with the commodities trader in January 2022 after discovering unfaithful messages.\nEddie moved out of Denise's home following their shock split and was thought to be staying with friends.\nSix months later, she went public with Jimmy, who she met through All Saints singer Shaznay Lewis, at the Grand Prix Ball and the pair enjoyed their first holiday together after jetting to Marbella.\n\nA look back at Denise Van Outen's love life\n\nJay Kay (1998-2001) \nDenise, who narrates The Only Way Is Essex, dated Jamiroquai lead singer Jay Kay, 52, for three years from 1998 to 2001. \nThe TV personality, 47, enjoyed a highly-publicised relationship with the Jamiroquai bandmember, 52, before they 'painfully' called it quits back in 2001.\nDenise even wrote about him in her new autobiography A Bit Of Me, and he claimed they called off their plans to marry due to 'conflicting' jobs at the time.\n\nThe ex files: The star, who narrates The Only Way Is Essex, dated Jamiroquai lead singer Jay Kay, 52, for three years from 1998 to 2001 (pictured in 1998)\nNick Moran (2001)\nAfter Jay, there was a brief rebound fling with Lock, Stock And Two Smoking Barrels actor Nick Moran. \nOne onlooker observed of one of their date nights: 'They were like a pair of magnets - stuck together all night.

In fact, the White House came under fire this year for using the historic children’s event to generate extra cash. They sought corporate sponsorships for the event rather than relying on the typical peeps—the American Egg Board, which provides tens of thousands of eggs for the occasion. \n\nThe jamboree also comes at an awkward time for the American public. Although eggs will shower the White House lawn, they’ll be missing from most people’s fridges as cartons reach a new record-high of $6.23 per dozen.\n\nPresident Donald Trump used an outside event company called Harbinger to solicit the sponsors. It advertised a corporate partnership ranging from $75,000 to $200,000, promising logo and branding opportunities, reported CNN. The White House Easter Egg Roll, which began in 1878, has long been privately funded. But now, Harbinger gets to rake in the big bucks for the White House Historical Association. Critics from both parties clucked their disapproval, noting that the solicitation brushes off decades-long precedent.\n\nMeta is not the only corporation reaping the rewards of its new alliance. Other tech companies like Jeff Bezos’ Amazon and YouTube (owned by Google) will also play a role in the event. \n\nNon-tech sponsors include The Toy Association, the the National Confectioners Association, the International Fresh Produce Association, and Signature Brands, LLC, the parent company of Betty Crocker.\n\nIn March, when asked about the spring festivities, a former official involved in planning the event told CNN that it has become “an enterprise.” \n\n“This is not your grandmother’s Easter Egg Roll where people lined up outside the gate and go and roll an egg and get a little gift bag and walk out,” they added. \n\nThe highest-paying sponsors get the best perks: “Naming rights for key areas or elements,” “Custom-branded baskets, snacks/beverages, or souvenirs,” “sponsor logos featured on event signage,” and—oh, goody—a special “invite-only brunch hosted inside the White House by FLOTUS,” among others.\n\nAs major tech conglomerates flash their corporate power amidst the wholesome family fun, the government seeks to curb them only blocks away. The Federal Trade Commission is prosecuting an antitrust case that alleges Meta “cemented” its monopoly after acquiring the apps Instagram and WhatsApp.\n\nIf the FTC wins, the social media giant might be forced to sell both apps and concede some of its mounting power.\n\nMeta CEO Mark Zuckerberg testified in court for more than 10 hours this week, attempting to butter up his pal Trump. Zuckerberg has visited Mar-a-Lago and the White House multiple times and has held multiple meetings with White House officials, including chief of staff Susie Wiles. In a statement before the trial began, he seemed fairly confident that Meta would prevail. \n\nOthers, who don’t want it resurrected, believe that Easter miracles should be saved for someone else. \n\nMassive tech oligarchs like Zuckerberg rushed to cozy up to Trump after his November win. The president has especially formed close ties with Amazon owner Jeff Bezos and “First Buddy” Elon Musk, who owns X. \n\nAll three tech giants have signaled their MAGA loyalty by scrubbing their websites of statements or phrases related to diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI). Bezos pulled the trigger in December, slashing any mention of LGBTQ+ rights, the word “transgender,” and a commitment to “equity for Black people” from his website. \n\nZuckerberg, who donated $1 million to Trump before his inauguration, followed suit in January, rolling back fact-checking on his platforms and replacing it with a system similar to Musk’s X. He cited Trump’s win as “a cultural tipping point.”\n\nAnd Musk, of course, is in many ways Trump’s right-hand man, leading the charge to slash the federal government and annihilate any mention of DEI across the country. \n\nThe Meta case comes to a head only months after former President Joe Biden issued an eerie warning in his concession speech, taking aim at the “tech-industrial complex” and using his farewell to suggest “the potential for the disastrous rise of misplaced power.”\n\nHe added that “Americans are being buried under an avalanche of misinformation and disinformation enabling the abuse of power. The free press is crumbling. Errors are disappearing. Social media is giving up on fact-checking. The truth is smothered by lies told for power and for profit.”","summary":"Win McNamee / Win McNamee/Getty ImagesOn Monday Meta will join a strange crew of sponsors hopping to the White House for its annual Easter Egg Roll, which ironically takes place only blocks from the courthouse that will decide the company’s fate. \n\nFirst Lady Melania Trump on Friday announced how eggcited she is for the partnership, which includes Meta’s “AI-Powered Experience and Photo Opportunity.” But critics say it’s not all it’s cracked up to be.

As of Friday, the administration has not taken active steps to do so.\n\nWhen asked by Karl about the order, Homan claimed the Trump administration does not have the right or ability to bring Abrego Garcia back to the U.S. and argued Abrego Garcia is under the authority of the El Salvador government.\n\n\"I understand that 'facilitate,' but he's also in the custody -- he's a citizen and a national of the country of El Salvador. El Salvador would certainly have to cooperate in that,\" Homan said.\n\n\"But again, I'm out of the loop on that. I'm not an attorney. I'm not litigating this case. We'll do whatever the law says we have to do, but I think and I stand by the fact [that] I think we did the right thing here,\" he said.\n\nHoman also joined Trump and other Republicans in their criticism of Sen. Chris Van Hollen, D-Md., who traveled to El Salvador this week and met with Abrego Garcia.\n\n\"You know, what bothers me more than that is a U.S. senator traveled to El Salvador on taxpayer dime to meet with an MS-13 gang member, [a] public safety threat, terrorist,\" Homan said, without providing evidence that Van Hollen is using taxpayer money for the trip.\n\nWhen ABC News reached out to Van Hollen's office for comment on how the trip was funded, his office replied, \"the Senator traveled in his official capacity with bipartisan approval to follow up on the case of a constituent and conduct oversight of U.S. foreign assistance programs. He did fly commercial.\"\n\nAbrego Garcia has never been convicted of a crime in the U.S., and his wife, Jennifer Vasquez, told ABC News on Wednesday that her husband has \"never been convicted for anything.\"\n\nHoman accused the senator of not taking time to meet with victims of MS-13 gang members in his state and inaction under the Biden administration to address border concerns.\n\n\"What concerns me is Van Hollen never went to the border the last four years under Joe Biden. ... What shocks me is he's remained silent on the travesty that happened on the southern border. Many people died, thousands of people died,\" he said.\n\nUpon returning to the U.S., Van Hollen told reporters his trip was about more than Abrego Garcia's case.\n\n\"This case is not only about one man, as important as that is,\" Van Hollen said. \"It is about protecting fundamental freedoms and the fundamental principle in the Constitution for due process that protects everybody who resides in America.\"","summary":"Border czar Tom Homan spoke with \"This Week\" co-anchor Jonathan Karl about the wrongful deportation of Kilmer Abrego Garcia.","url":"https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/border-czar-tom-homan-argues-us-justified-removing/story?id=120948871","image":"https://i.abcnewsfe.com/a/443bc4cb-f466-492c-b128-ae735bca65b4/tom-homan-1-abc-gmh-240418_1745000580729_hpMain_16x9.jpg?w=1600","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-18 23:46:41","author":"Ivan Pereira","authors":["Ivan Pereira"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.313},{"id":312590470,"title":"Jim Acosta takes shot at Trump supporters, says only half the country cares about the truth","text":"Liberal ex-CNN anchor Jim Acosta took a shot at Donald Trump supporters in an interview published Friday, suggesting that half of the country was uninterested in the truth.\n\nSpeaking with The Washingtonian shortly after his exit earlier this year from CNN and launching his new Substack video outlet, Acosta said news outlets should put more emphasis on fact-checking Trump in his second administration.\n\n“I think it does make a difference,” he said. “Half the country still wants to hear the truth.”\n\nAcosta said he used to tell college students that they shouldn’t go into journalism because of how much time they lose, but how he’s pleading for “reinforcements.”\n\n“When I go talk to college students, I used to say, ‘Don’t go into this business. You’re going to lose your weekends and your holidays, and your mother’s going to say, You don’t call me anymore.’ And now I tell them, ‘Please come into this business, because we need reinforcements,'” he told The Washingtonian.\n\nAcosta didn’t trouble to hide his feelings about Trump while at CNN. \n\nAs a White House correspondent, he often sparred with Trump and his press secretaries in melodramatic fashion and editorialized during his reporting, such as scolding Kim Kardashian for being at the White House to discuss criminal justice reform, complaining about the term “Wuhan coronavirus” being xenophobic, and reciting the poem from the Statue of Liberty.\n\nHe was moved off the White House beat and onto an anchor job as President Joe Biden took office in 2021. \n\nShortly after Trump’s return to office this year, he was offered an assuredly low-rated midnight slot and turned it down, leaving CNN in January.\n\nIn a “town hall” he held with a series of liberal media figures this week, including former CNN colleague Don Lemon, Acosta referred to the “show” Trump and his team put on every day as “sh—y.”\n\n“We have to teach Americans, teach people to be more media-literate. What Donald Trump does is a show,” Lemon said. “Every single day you have to realize from morning until the end, ’til midnight, it’s a show that is produced like a television show.

He stood next to Abrego Garcia’s wife, Jennifer Vasquez Sura, who wiped away tears as Van Hollen shared some of her husband’s comments about missing his family.\nThe senator, however, emphasised repeatedly to reporters that the case transcends the question of Abrego Garcia’s immigration status.\n“It’s about protecting the constitutional rights of everybody who resides in the United States,” Van Hollen said.\n“It’s very clear that the president, Trump administration are blatantly, flagrantly, disagreeing with, defying the order from the Supreme Court.”\n\nThe case has become a focal point in the immigration debate. Democrats accuse US President Donald Trump of overstepping his executive authority and Republicans are criticising Democrats for defending a man Trump and White House officials claim is an MS-13 gang member, despite the fact he has not been charged with any gang-related crimes.\nMore Democrats have said they will fly to El Salvador to push for Abrego Garcia’s release, but the partisan pressure has not yielded any results.\nTrump and El Salvador’s President Nayib Bukele have dug in on keeping him out of the United States, even as officials in Trump’s Republican administration have described his deportation as a mistake, and the US Supreme Court has called on the administration to facilitate his return.\nWhite House press secretary Karoline Leavitt has said that Abrego Garcia will “never live in the United States of America again”.\nBukele posted images of Van Hollen’s meeting with Abrego Garcia on Thursday and said that the prisoner “gets the honour of staying in El Salvador’s custody”.\nVan Hollen said a Salvadoran government official placed other beverages on the table with salt or sugar on the rim, to make it look like they were drinking margaritas.\nVan Hollen said neither he nor Abrego Garcia drank from the glasses, which in the photo Bukele posted were garnished with cherries.\nThe fight over Abrego Garcia is the latest partisan flashpoint as Democrats have struggled to break through and push back during the opening few months of Trump’s second time in office.\n\nA federal appeal court said on Thursday in a blistering order that the Trump administration’s claim that it cannot do anything to free Abrego Garcia from the prison in El Salvador and return him to the United States “should be shocking”.\nBut Republicans appear to have only become more determined to keep Abrego Garcia out of the country. They have sharply criticised Van Hollen’s trip and claimed that Abrego Garcia has ties to the MS-13 gang.\nHis lawyers say the government has provided no evidence of gang involvement and he has never been charged with any crime related to such activity.\nDemocrats “have time and again prioritised politics over the safety and security of Americans”, Republican Senator John Cornyn of Texas said in a statement on Friday. “It is utterly divorced from reality.”\nThe Democratic senator posted a photo of his meeting with Abrego Garcia on Thursday evening but did not say anything else much except that he had called Abrego Garcia’s wife “to pass on a message of love” and would provide a full update upon his return.\nAfter days of denying that he knew much about Abrego Garcia, Trump on Friday said he knew Abrego Garcia’s prison record was “unbelievably bad” and called him an “illegal alien” and a “foreign terrorist”.\nThe president also responded on Friday with a social media post saying Van Hollen “looked like a fool yesterday standing in El Salvador begging for attention”.\nSeveral House Republicans have visited the notorious gang prison in support of the Trump administration’s efforts.\nCongressman Riley Moore, a West Virginia Republican, posted on Tuesday evening that that he had visited the prison where Abrego Garcia is being held. “I leave now even more determined to support President Trump’s efforts to secure our homeland,” Moore wrote on social media.\n\nUS Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials acknowledged in a court filing earlier this month that Abrego Garcia’s deportation was an “administrative error”.\nThe government’s acknowledgement sparked immediate uproar from immigration advocates, but White House officials have dug in on the allegation that he is a gang member.\nThe fight has also played out in contentious court filings, with repeated refusals from the government to tell a judge what it plans to do, if anything, to repatriate him.\nThe three-judge panel from the 4th US Circuit Court of Appeals unanimously refused on Thursday to suspend the judge’s decision to order sworn testimony by Trump administration officials and said the judiciary will be hurt by the “constant intimations of its illegitimacy” while the executive branch “will lose much from a public perception of its lawlessness”.\nJudge J. Harvie Wilkinson III, nominated by US President Ronald Reagan, a Republican, wrote that he and his two colleagues “cling to the hope that it is not naive to believe our good brethren in the Executive Branch perceive the rule of law as vital to the American ethos”.\nSince March, El Salvador has accepted from the US more than 200 Venezuelan immigrants – whom Trump administration officials have accused of gang activity and violent crimes – and placed them inside the country’s maximum-security gang prison just outside San Salvador.","summary":"The update came from Senator Chris Van Hollen after he met Kilmar Abrego Garcia, the man at the centre of a debate on rights and immigration.","url":"https://www.scmp.com/news/world/united-states-canada/article/3307138/man-wrongly-deported-us-says-hes-been-moved-el-salvador-mega-prison","image":"https://cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2025/04/19/d84062ba-6343-47f3-b23b-5e5ea6b7f73c_b544d55a.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-18 23:31:58","author":"Associated Press","authors":["Associated Press"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"cn","sentiment":-0.33},{"id":312588732,"title":"Letters: Kamala Harris and others will be judged by courage","text":"Harris and others will\nbe judged by courage\n\nRe: “Harris remains coy about political future” (Page A1, April 14).\n\nKamala Harris may be coy about her next political move, but she is clear when she says, “There is a sense of fear that is taking hold in our country.

The girls were positively shell shocked.\"Insiders revealed the original deal was for Michelle to keep their their film business, Higher Ground Productions, along with their home in Chicago and the Martha's Vineyard estate. \n\nBarack was set to get the D.C. mansion, while the two were to split their stock portfolio, which is worth about $22.5million.\n\nBut Michelle is now miffed that Barack is trying to angle his way into her five-year-old production company, especially since she considers it her baby.\n\n\"She doesn’t want Barack anywhere near it,\" the source spilled. \"The notion of him profiting from her sweat and vision galled her, and she’s apparently willing to go to war over it.\"In retaliation for keeping him out of the company, Barack turned around and withdrew his offer of the Martha's Vineyard property. \n\nThe source said: \"When Michelle raised a stink over the Higher Ground profits, he dug in his heels and Nixed the idea of her having it.\"\n\nRumors have been flying that the pair is heading for divorce after Barack attended Jimmy Carter's funeral and Donald Trump's inauguration by himself, while Michelle was vacationing in Hawaii.\n\nOne insider previously told RadarOnline.com Michelle had \"no interest\" in going to the U.S. capital, and since leaving the White House in 2017 has been focusing on rediscovering and redefining herself with her newfound freedoms.A source who once worked with Barack and Michelle claimed their marriage was struggling.\n\nThe insider claimed: \"They don't pretend that they have this Camelot relationship.

The employees asked to remain anonymous because they were not authorized to reveal the meeting details.\n\nAn EEOC spokesman declined to comment on the meeting, saying that “per federal law, we cannot discuss investigatory practices.”\n\nThe decision is the latest step by the EEOC to back away from defending the rights of transgender and nonbinary workers in a major shift in civil rights enforcement under the Trump administration. In February, the EEOC moved to drop seven of its own pending lawsuits alleging discrimination against transgender and nonbinary people.\n\nEEOC Acting Chair Andrea Lucas, a Republican, has said one of her priorities will be implementing Trump’s executive order on gender and “defending the biological and binary reality of sex and related rights.” She had previously ordered that any worker discrimination charge that “implicates” Trump’s executive order on gender should be elevated to headquarters for review.\n\nThis latest decision to bury gender identity-related complaints leaves transgender and nonbinary people experiencing discrimination at work with limited recourse. U.S. workers must file discrimination complaints through the EEOC in most cases before they can seek other legal avenues.\n\nGiving gender identity-related cases the lowest priority essentially pre-determines that they are meritless, said Chai Feldblum, who was an EEOC commissioner from 2010-2019.\n\n“If they say they are bringing it to a central location to give them due consideration, they at least have the facade of doing something,” Feldblum said of Lucas’ previous directive on gender identity cases. “If they are sweeping them out the door as “C” charges, they are not doing their job.”\n\nThe EEOC has said that it will still issue “right to sue” notices in gender-identity related cases upon request, meaning workers can decide to pursue a lawsuit on their own. The agency will also honor requests for mediation, according to the employees who attended Wednesday’s meeting. But if mediation fails, the EEOC will take no further action on the case, the employees said.\n\nThe EEOC’s new approach to gender-identity related discrimination has raised a debate over whether the agency is acting in violation of the Supreme Court’s 2020 ruling in Bostock v. Clayton County, a landmark case that established that Title VII of the Civil Rights Act prohibits workplace discrimination based on gender identity.\n\nCivil rights activists have accused the EEOC of illegally defying the Supreme Court and abdicating its duty to enforce anti-discrimination laws by abandoning gender-identity related lawsuits.

The medical giant also has offices at Willis Tower.\n\nAbbott plans for those investments to “go live” by the end of the year. It expects to hire about 200 people in Illinois and 100 in Dallas over the next few years to support the expansion, according to the company.\n\nAbbott has 89 manufacturing sites around the world, with the highest concentration of sites, 35, in the U.S. \n\nIn the past five years, Abbott has invested nearly $5 billion in domestic manufacturing and equipment, plus another $10.7 billion in research and development.\n\nAbbott chairman and CEO Robert Ford said in the call that the investments are related to its U.S. transfusion diagnostics business, which is responsible for screening the U.S. blood supply.\n\nKing did not respond to questions about how Trump’s shifting tariff policies relate to its U.S. expansion.\n\nLast week, Trump ordered tariffs on China of 145%. He’s also imposed 25% tariffs on steel and aluminum; 25% tariffs on products from Mexico and Canada not subject to the U.S. free-trade agreement; 25% tariffs on auto imports, as well as parts, which kick in next month and a 10% baseline tariff on nearly all imports. Trump is also exploring tariffs on medicine and pharmaceutical ingredients. \n\nTariffs are taxes put on goods that are imported from a foreign country. They’re often used by political leaders to signal their disdain for another country’s policies — or as a tool to promote domestic industries and production.\n\nFord said during the investor call that tariffs will impact all of its manufacturing sites across the world, but the company is “well positioned to implement mitigations to help manage the impact of the tariffs.”\n\n“We estimate the tariff impact in 2025 to be a few hundred million dollars. That’s a half year impact because I don’t see any impact in Q2. And then we start to kind of see the impact happening in Q3,” Ford said.\n\n“One thing we have learned from tariffs is they don’t go away. So whatever comes, it stays and it stays for a while. I look at the tariffs that went in place in 2017, they’re still there. So we need to think about how do you mitigate this more in a long-term sustainable way,” he said. “So yes, you can use a balance sheet and you can build some inventory — and we’ll probably do some of that. But if your entire strategy is building inventory, you guess what’s going to happen in 2026, or whenever that inventory runs out. So we’re really looking at the manufacturing network and optimizing it.”","url":"https://chicago.suntimes.com/money/2025/04/18/abbott-laboratories-investing-500m-manufacturing-add-200-jobs-illinois","image":"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/e6d0ba1/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3000x1713+0+104/resize/1461x834!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F97%2F9d%2F61fd79d545b2958faa0f5233ebfa%2Fwatc","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-18 23:27:30","author":"Abby Miller","authors":["Abby Miller"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.123},{"id":312593126,"title":"Dem Sen Reveals El Salvador’s Goons Faked Margaritas With Deported Dad","text":"Sen.

Bukele claimed that, far from coming to harm, Abrego Garcia was now in a “tropical paradise” and “sipping margaritas.”\n\nAfter addressing more pressing concerns like Abrego Garcia’s wellbeing and legal battle, Van Hollen took some time out of his press conference—while flanked on all sides by Abrego Garcia’s loved ones—to address the staged photos, telling reporters how the margarita photo op came to be.\n\n“As we were talking, one of the government people came over and deposited two other glasses on the table, with ice and I don’t know if it was salt or sugar round the top, but they look like margaritas,” the senator began. “Let me just be very clear: neither of us touched the drinks that were in front of us, and if you want to play a little Sherlock Holmes, I’ll tell you how you can know that.”\n\nHe continued, “If you look at the picture I sent out from the beginning of our meeting, you’ll see there are no glasses on the table, so you’ll see in later videos they are on the table. But they made a little mistake: if you sip out of one of those glasses, some of whatever it was, salt or sugar, would disappear—you would see a gap. There’s no gap. Nobody drank any margaritas or sugar water or whatever it is.”\n\nThe point of highlighting this, Van Hollen explained, was that it illustrated the lengths Bukele will go to to “deceive people about what’s going on,” as well as just how far President Donald Trump will go, because when asked about the meeting, he just “went along for the ride,” calling Van Hollen a “fool” for “begging for attention from the Fake News Media.”\n\nVan Hollen continued, telling reporters that despite the fact the Trump administration has “been lying about this case from the beginning” and “trying to change the subject,” ultimately this is about “adhering to the Constitution, to the right of due process, and that’s why we say bring Kilmar home so he can be afforded his rights under the Constitution.”","summary":"Senator Chris Van Hollen/TwitterSen.

Everyone else, not so much. The ever-changing news reports whirl stock market outlooks about, thereby keeping investors unsure and concerned. Beneath the stock market volatility are multiple uncertainties.\n\nU.S. stock market uncertainty\n\nBeyond \"normal\" risks, conditions are unstable due to disruptive, human-caused actions. The widespread, abnormal shifts are undermining investors’ understanding and expectations. Thus, the stock market tosses about, producing confusion, worry and contradictory advice.\n\nU.S. economy uncertainty\n\nAmong those willing to undertake an economic outlook, there is little agreement. Some say there are no signs of a recession, some say there are signs, and some say the recession is already here. Since the economy’s strength underlies the health and growth of businesses, this uncertainty puts all stock market outlooks on a shaky foundation.\n\nU.S. alliances uncertainty\n\nOver the decades, countries have sought alliances with others primarily for security, economic, and mutual support reasons. Importantly, these alliances respected each other's history, governance, and culture. Additionally, these relationships developed provisions for citizens' desires to take advantage of safe foreign travel, education, employment, volunteer, and retirement opportunities.\n\nThese stable alliances are being tested now by the new, non-negotiated tariffs and other government actions that weaken or overturn previous agreements and understandings. Because such adverse actions have not been taken in recent history, the end results are uncertain.\n\nMORE FOR YOU\n\nAnonymous Hackers Expose Putin’s Secret Data—Publish Trump File\n\nApple iPhone 17 Pro: Latest Leaks Claim To Show Updated Design\n\nGoogle Confirms Gmail Update—Stop Using Your Password Now\n\nU.S. government uncertainties\n\nThere is much discussion about the actions and changes being decided and approved within the White House. Traditionally, the U.S. Congress formulates, discusses/debates, and decides issues having to do with the economy, commerce, country alliances, foreign trade, tariffs, agency creation/funding, overall spending allocation, and the military. The White House then approves or vetoes the actions.\n\nNow, however, the White House has taken over those Congressional duties. Moreover, it has altered or reversed previous Congressional actions. Additionally, it now is significantly decreasing the human resources at many agencies and departments without agency and/or Congressional approval.\n\nAdd to the uncertainties accompanying these nontraditional actions the question as to whether they are proper. Some have been judged in court to be improper. Therefore, there are the additional uncertainties as to which decisions will remain, what will be their results, and how the employee shrinkage will affect government operations.\n\nPresidential authority uncertainties\n\nPresident Donald Trump has made proposals that are unique:\n\nMaking Canada the 51st U.S. state\n\nTaking over Greenland\n\nAcquiring Gaza, deporting inhabitants and building a casino resort\n\nWill any of these singular, significant actions be pursued? If so, what will be the consequences?\n\nUncertainties are worse than risks\n\nWith risks (e.g., whether the Federal Reserve will lower the interest rate), there is usually a range of possibilities based on known factors. However, uncertainties have widespread possible outcomes (e.g., whether the 10% general tariff level will remain in effect, at that level, and apply to all countries). Then there are the uncertainties as to the resulting effects of the tariffs, as well as other countries' reactions. All these unknowns produce a wide range of possibilities.\n\nThe bottom line: Investors face uncertain and possibly unexpected results\n\nSo, what is an investor to do? There are three basic options:\n\nStay the course - The logic here is that eventually changes will be incorporated so that the uncertainties shrink, and investors can regain confidence\n\nIncrease allocation to cash - The reasoning here is that the uncertainties likely will produce buying opportunities, so having some cash on hand can provide both protection and opportunity\n\nGo to 100% cash - This proposition removes uncertainty from the investment portfolio, thereby producing a state of mind focused solely on deciding when to start buying\n\nFollow me on LinkedIn.\nEditorial StandardsForbes Accolades","summary":"Beneath the stock market volatility are multiple uncertainties.","url":"https://www.forbes.com/sites/johntobey/2025/04/18/uncertainties-are-churning-us-stock-market-outlooks/","image":"https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/6802d61b692bfde1b4e526e8/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-18 23:25:32","author":"Contributor,John S.

Not so fast, says senator who visited Abrego Garcia in El Salvador","text":"By MEG KINNARD, Associated Press\n\nThere was the pool furniture in the background. There were the tropical drinks, which looked to be margaritas garnished with cherries.

During the visit, she posted a video on X (formerly Twitter), capturing a candid moment with Musk. “Happy to see my friend @elonmusk back in Washington,” her caption read — but it was Musk’s facial expression in the clip that caught the internet’s attention.\nContenta di rivedere a Washington il mio amico @elonmusk pic.twitter.com/phKTwTcXyz\n— Giorgia Meloni (@GiorgiaMeloni) April 18, 2025\nSocial media users were quick to weigh in, with many suggesting Musk appeared visibly flustered or “blushing” as he greeted the Italian leader. Comments ranged from playful speculation to outright matchmaking. “Is it just us, or does Elon look smitten?” one user posted. Another added, “Elon has a crush on her. Pretty obvious.”\nThe renewed buzz about their rapport comes months after similar rumors made rounds during the 2024 Atlantic Council Global Citizen Awards in New York, where Musk had presented an award to Meloni. At the time, a viral photo of the two sparked speculation about a possible romantic link — something Musk firmly denied. “We are not dating,” he had clarified on X shortly after the event.\nDo you think They’ll date? 🤣 pic.twitter.com/XXs1U45kjb\n— Tesla Owners Silicon Valley (@teslaownersSV) September 24, 2024\nOn the political front, the meeting between Meloni and Trump was focused on energy cooperation and trade.

After initially rejecting his request to meet Ábrego García and preventing him from traveling to the prison where he was being held, president Nayib Bukele’s government on Thursday facilitated a meeting at Van Hollen’s hotel.\n\n“His conversation with me was the first communication he’d had with anybody outside of prison since he was abducted. He said he felt very sad about being in a prison because he had not committed any crimes,” Van Hollen said at a press conference at Dulles international airport outside Washington DC.\n\nHe recounted speaking to Ábrego García about his wellbeing, and informing him of the controversy caused by his arrest and Donald Trump’s refusal to let him back into the United States, in spite of a supreme court ruling saying the president should “facilitate” his return.\n\nThe senator said Ábrego García told him about how he had been arrested by federal agents after a traffic stop while driving with his five-year-old son, who has autism. He was taken to Baltimore, then Texas, where he was shackled and placed with other deportees on an aircraft where they could not see out the windows. The plane flew to El Salvador, where, Ábrego García said, he was taken to the Terrorism Confinement Center (Cecot) and put in a cell with about 25 other people.\n\n“He said he was not afraid of the other prisoners in his immediate cell, but that he was traumatized by being at Cecot and fearful of many of the prisoners in other cell blocks who called out to him, and taunted him in various ways,” Van Hollen said, adding that Ábrego García otherwise appeared to be in sound health.\n\nJust more than a week ago, Ábrego García was moved to another prison in the city of Santa Ana, where conditions are better, but he still has no contact with the outside world, Van Hollen said. He has also not been told whether he is being charged with a crime, or how long he will be detained.\n\n“They haven’t told him anything about why he was sent or how long he would be there,” the senator said.\n\nVan Hollen described himself as motivated to make the trip both out of a desire to relay Ábrego García’s condition to his family, and outrage that the Trump administration had deported him despite a judge granting him protection from removal, over a “well-founded fear of future persecution” from gangs in El Salvador, and was now refusing to bring him back.\n\n“This case is not only about one man, as important as that is. It is about protecting fundamental freedoms and the fundamental principle in the constitution for due process, that protects everybody who resides in America,” Van Hollen said. “This should not be an issue for Republicans or Democrats. This is an issue for every American who cares about our constitution.”\n\nOn Thursday, the federal appeals judge James Wilkinson, an appointee of Republican president Ronald Reagan, wrote an opinion blasting the administration’s conduct in the case as litigation over Ábrego García’s deportation continued.\n\n“The government is asserting a right to stash away residents of this country in foreign prisons without the semblance of due process that is the foundation of our constitutional order,” he wrote.\n\nThe Trump administration has countered the criticism by claiming that Ábrego García was a member of the MS-13 criminal gang, with the White House posting on social media that he was “NOT coming back”.\n\nTrump administration officials also seized on a claim from Bukele that Van Hollen and Ábrego García drank margaritas during their meeting, which the senator took pains to refute, saying the drinks had been placed on their table by a Salvadoran government employee.\n\nRelated: Denied, detained, deported: the most high-profile cases in Trump’s immigration crackdown\n\n“Let me just be very clear: neither of us touched the drinks that were in front of us,” he said, adding that the glass placed in front of Ábrego García contained less liquid, as if trying to create the impression that he had drunk from it.\n\n“But this is a lesson into the lengths that president Bukele will do to deceive people about what’s going on. And it also shows the lengths that the Trump administration, or the president, will go to, because when he was asked about a reporter about this, he just went along for the ride.”\n\nVan Hollen was joined at the airport by Ábrego García’s wife, Jennifer Vasquez Sura, who brushed away tears as the senator described meeting her husband. At the White House earlier in the day, Trump had read from a domestic violence protective order Vasquez filed in 2021, which she has said stemmed from a rough patch in their marriage that they later worked through.\n\n“When I asked him, what was the one thing he would ask for in addition to his freedom, he said he wanted to talk to his wife,” Van Hollen said of his meeting with Ábrego García. “I told him I would work very hard to make that happen.”","url":"https://uk.news.yahoo.com/kilmar-brego-garc-traumatized-threats-232022054.html","image":"https://media.zenfs.com/en/theguardian_763/236baabb57da545a7bfde7a17df20bee","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-18 23:20:22","author":"Chris Stein","authors":["Chris Stein"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.559},{"id":312588100,"title":"Donald Trump says US may 'take a pass' on Ukraine peace talks if they are too hard","text":"Donald Trump has suggested that the US might \"take a pass\" on Ukraine peace talks if they prove too challenging, although he also mentioned there is a \"good chance\" of success. This threat to withdraw from diplomatic efforts comes as the US' previous 30-day deal to stop Russian attacks on energy infrastructure also came to an end. Marco Rubio, Trump's Secretary of State, hinted that Washington could \"move on\" if there isn't any progress in the coming days, following a meeting in Paris with delegations from the UK, EU , and Ukraine. On Friday, when asked about Rubio's comments, Trump went further and said he might to 'pass' on peace talks. Downing Street confirmed that Sir Keir Starmer spoke with the US president during a phone call on Friday about Ukraine, but no further details were provided. Foreign Secretary David Lammy highlighted that the discussions emphasised the \"shared commitment to global security.\" Speaking to journalists at the White House on Friday, Mr Trump agreed with Rubio's sentiment, stating: \"Marco is right in saying... we want to see it end\". Trump showed that his administration is growing tired of the negotiations, stating: \"If for some reason one of the two parties makes it very difficult, we're going to say you're fools, you're foolish, and we're just going to take a pass.\" However, he still expressed optimism, adding that he believes there is \"a good chance of solving the problem\". When questioned whether Russian President Vladimir Putin was stalling the negotiations, Mr Trump responded: \"I hope not.\" These comments came as the US and Ukraine finally signed a memorandum, marking an initial move towards reviving a stalled minerals deal. The Paris talks marked the first significant level dialogue between British, French, and White House officials since Sir Keir and French President Emmanuel Macron made separate visits to Washington in February. Upon departing from Paris, Mr Rubio informed journalists that the US administration is eager to determine \"very soon, and I'm talking about a matter of days, not a matter of weeks\" whether the war can be brought to an end. \"If it can, we're prepared to do whatever we can to facilitate that and make sure that it... ends in a durable and just way. If it's not possible, if we're so far apart that this is not going to happen, then I think the president's probably at a point where he's going to say, well, we're done.\" He added: \"We need to figure out here now, within a matter of days, whether this is doable in the short term, because if it's not, then I think we're just going to move on.\" Efforts towards a potential peace have stumbled since Moscow turned down a ceasefire agreement last month that had been reached by the US and Ukraine. In the meantime, the UK and France are attempting to form a coalition of nations ready to uphold a truce should one be established. Following the discussions in Paris, Mr Lammy said: \"Unity is our strength. Today's meetings with France, the US, Ukraine and Germany underscore our shared commitment to global security.\" He also stated: \"We are working hard with allies to secure a lasting peace in Ukraine. Russia must agree to an immediate, full and unconditional ceasefire as Ukraine has done.\" Ukraine's economy minister, Yulia Svyrydenko, announced on X that a memorandum of intent has been signed with the US, marking a step towards an economic partnership agreement between the two countries. This move paves the way for an agreement that would provide the US with access to Ukraine's mineral resources. Ms Svyrydenko also mentioned that a final deal would include an investment fund dedicated to the reconstruction of Ukraine. US officials have expressed optimism that an agreement could be finalised by the end of next week.","summary":"President Trump said the US could 'pass' on peace in Ukraine if it become too difficult","url":"https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/uk-world-news/donald-trump-says-take-pass-35083202","image":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/article35083199.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200b/0_US-President-Donald-Trump-spoke-to-Sir-Keir-Starmer-on-Friday-Alex-BrandonAP.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-18 23:18:23","author":"Helen Corbett,William Morgan","authors":["Helen Corbett","William Morgan"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.376},{"id":312588854,"title":"Nintendo maintains Switch 2 price amid Trump tariff turmoil, sets new pre-order date","text":"Nintendo has set a new pre-order date for the Switch 2 after delaying it amid President Donald Trump's escalating tariff war.\n\nThe video above is from a related story.\n\nThe new pre-order date, which will begin on April 24, 2025, was announced on Nintendo's website on Friday, a little over two weeks after the original pre-order date of April 9.\n\nNintendo delayed the original pre-order date to assess the impact of Trump's tariffs and evolving market conditions.\n\nProduction for the Switch console was partially shifted out of China to Vietnam, a spokeswoman told Reuters back in 2019.

[Trump’s] just manifestly promising here to violate the First Amendment because you can't just selectively pick the people you want to take a benefit away from, or impose a burden on, on the basis of their political views or whether they like you,” Conway said. “It is manifestly violative of the law and … if he does this, he's going to lose again and again and again. And at the end of the day, he's not going to help himself. But, you know, he may do it anyway because of his inner rage at institutions that he thinks are better than him.”\n\nConway added that Trump’s ivy league ire may stem from more than just enmity at schools' alleged progressive bent.\n\n“Maybe it has something to do with the fact that he had to, pay someone to take the SAT to get into an Ivy league school.

But it’s just one of many antitrust battles against big tech","text":"Tech giant Google has just suffered another legal blow in the United States, losing a landmark antitrust case. This follows on from the company’s loss in a similar case last year. \n\nSocial media giant Meta is also currently embroiled in a landmark legal battle in the US that could change not only how it operates, but how millions of people around the world communicate.\n\nHearings in the Meta case commenced earlier this week in a court in Washington DC, after Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg failed to settle the case for US$450 million. Brought by the US Federal Trade Commission (FTC), the suit alleges Meta broke antitrust laws and illegally secured a monopoly over social media platforms. \n\nAlong with Google and Meta, Amazon and Apple are also currently facing significant antitrust challenges in the US. \n\nAll of these actions are continuing despite major changes in both the FTC and the US Department of Justice as a result of the election of Donald Trump.\n\nCollectively, these cases represent a substantial regulatory push to examine and potentially curb the market power of big tech. So what are all of these cases about exactly? What are the next steps in each of them? And what might they mean for consumers?\n\nThe cases against Google\n\nThe case Google just lost was related to online advertising. \n\nThe US Department of Justice alleged Google had behaved anticompetitively to monopolise the complex digital advertising technology market. This market facilitates the buying and selling of online ads.\n\nThe US district judge, Leonie Brinkema, agreed Google has a monopoly over the tools used by online publishers to host ad space, and the software that facilitates transactions between online publishers and advertisers.\n\nIn her ruling, Judge Brinkema said Google had “wilfully engaged in a series of anticompetitive acts” which ultimately resulted in it obtaining “monopoly power in the open-web display publisher ad server market”. \n\nGoogle has said it will appeal the decision. The Department of Justice will ask the court to require Google to divest parts of its ad tech business when the remedies phase of this trial starts later this month.\n\nThe second case involving Google is related to internet search. \n\nThe Department of Justice argued Google used exclusionary agreements, such as paying Apple billions annually to be the default search engine on iPhones, to lock out competitors. \n\nIn August 2024, a federal judge ruled Google acted illegally to maintain its search monopoly. \n\nThe case has now moved to the remedies phase. A crucial remedies trial is scheduled to begin next week. During this, the court will hear arguments on what actions should be taken against Google. Potential remedies could be significant, with regulators previously suggesting measures such as restrictions on Google’s Android operating system or even forcing the sale of its Chrome browser. \n\nGoogle has stated its intention to appeal this ruling as well.\n\nThe case against Meta\n\nThe FTC’s case against Meta alleges the tech giant illegally maintained a monopoly in the market for “personal social networking services”.\n\nThe core of the FTC’s argument is that Meta employed a “buy-or-bury” strategy to eliminate competitive threats. \n\nThis allegedly involved acquiring nascent rivals, most notably Instagram in 2012 and WhatsApp in 2014, specifically to neutralise them before they could challenge Facebook’s dominance. \n\nThe FTC points to internal communications as evidence of anticompetitive intent. These include Mark Zuckerberg’s statement, “It is better to buy than compete”. They also include an internal memo which showed Zuckerberg considered spinning off Instagram in 2018 over concerns about antitrust scrutiny. \n\nThe commission argues Meta’s actions stifled innovation and harmed consumers by limiting choices. It’s seeking to force Meta to divest, or sell off, both Instagram and WhatsApp.\n\nMeta vigorously defends its actions. It argues it does not hold a monopoly, facing fierce competition from platforms such as TikTok, YouTube and X (formerly Twitter). \n\nThe company contends the acquisitions of Instagram and WhatsApp were pro-competitive, allowing Meta to invest billions to improve and scale the apps, ultimately benefiting users. A key defence point is that the FTC itself reviewed and approved both deals over a decade ago.\n\nThe trial is expected to last eight weeks.\n\nThe cases against Apple and Amazon\n\nIn March 2024, the Department of Justice, along with several states, sued Apple, alleging it illegally maintains a monopoly in the smartphone market.\n\nThe lawsuit claims Apple uses its control over the iPhone ecosystem to stifle competition and innovation by, for example, degrading messaging quality between iPhones and Android devices and limiting the functionality of third-party digital wallets and smartwatches. \n\nApple filed a motion to dismiss the case in August 2024. The litigation is in its early stages and is expected to continue for several years.\n\nIn September 2023, the FTC, joined by numerous states, also sued Amazon.\n\nThe lawsuit alleges the tech giant unlawfully maintains monopoly power in both the market for “online superstores” (where consumers shop) and “online marketplace services” (for third-party sellers). \n\nThe FTC claims Amazon uses interlocking anticompetitive tactics. These include punishing sellers for offering lower prices elsewhere, coercing sellers into using its services, degrading search results with excessive ads, and charging exorbitant seller fees.\n\nIn late 2024, the presiding judge largely denied Amazon’s attempt to dismiss the core federal claims, allowing the case to proceed. \n\nA trial is currently scheduled for October 2026.\n\nMajor structural changes could come\n\nTaken together, these lawsuits represent the most significant antitrust enforcement push against major technology firms in the US in decades. They signal a fundamental re-examination of how competition laws apply to fast-evolving digital platforms and ecosystems.\n\nThe outcomes could potentially lead to major structural changes. These changes could include the forced breakup of companies such as Meta, or significant behavioural remedies restricting how these firms operate. \n\nRegardless of the specific results, the decisions in these cases will likely set crucial legal precedents. In turn, these will profoundly shape the future competitive landscape for technology. They will also likely influence regulation globally, and impact innovation and investment across the digital economy. \n\nWhat the cases do not reflect is the change in independence of regulatory bodies in the US, where consistency with White House policy is now paramount. The outcomes will surely test the relationship between Trump and the “tech bros” who’ve, quite literally, been at his side recently.","summary":"The cases against Google, Meta, Apple and Amazon could profoundly shape the future of global technology.","url":"https://theconversation.com/google-loses-online-ad-monopoly-case-but-its-just-one-of-many-antitrust-battles-against-big-tech-254602","image":"https://images.theconversation.com/files/662673/original/file-20250418-56-ojadv9.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&rect=0%2C214%2C5300%2C2650&q=45&auto=format&w=1356&h=668&fit=crop","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-18 23:09:18","author":"Rob Nicholls,Senior Research Associate in Media and Communications,University of Sydney","authors":["Rob Nicholls","Senior Research Associate in Media and Communications","University of Sydney"],"language":"en","source_country":"AU","sentiment":-0.336},{"id":312597928,"title":"Pandemic Truthers Take Over HHS Covid Site","text":"As of Friday, Covid.gov, the Department of Health and Human Services COVID-19 resource launched in 2022, is no longer providing information and resources about Covid—and Covidtests.gov, the website used to order free Covid tests from the government, isn’t, either.\n\nBoth now redirect to a White House page promoting the “lab leak theory,” which contends that the virus originated from China’s Wuhan Institute of Virology.

It criticizes much of the federal government’s Covid response, and that of the state of New York, beginning with a 2020 research paper titled “The proximal origin of SARS-CoV-2” that was published by the National Institutes of Health under Dr. Anthony Fauci, a target of the MAGA base.\n\nAs you continue scrolling, the page runs through various conservative talking points about the ineffectiveness of pandemic measures like masking, social distancing, and lockdowns. It also claims that “the federal government demonized alternative treatments and disfavored narratives, such as the lab leak theory, in a shameful effort to coerce and control the American people’s health decisions.” Beyond just policy critique, the new site centers blame on the HHS, NIH, the World Health Organization, and, of course, China. \n\nSupport for the lab leak theory has continued to grow over the last few years, as reported by ProPublica and as expounded in government analyses and by intelligence agencies, though many scientists believe research points to the virus originating in a market selling live animals. Regardless, Covid remains prevalent in the US and across the world—and the erasure of guidance by the federal government hangs Americans out to dry.","summary":"As of Friday, Covid.gov, the Department of Health and Human Services COVID-19 resource launched in 2022, is no longer providing information and resources about Covid—and Covidtests.gov, the website used to order free Covid tests from the government, isn’t, either.
